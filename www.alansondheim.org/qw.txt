I Engineer, Take Hir (Image)

(phenomenology of the avatar)


Modeling proceeds from the assumption that representation possesses the 
residue of organism, that something remains of interest after the modeling 
session occurs.

Modeling proceeds from the presence bodies, real and virtual, its position 
relative to the _you,_ a position occasioned from your establishment of a 
structure. Thus it is _only_ the presence of the body, _this_ presence of 
_this_ body: an ontological issue.

What emerges? - a psycho-sexual pathology, a characterology rendered imm- 
anent and inauthentic by an atmosphere of fiction and hysteric reduction? 
Something akin to schizophrenia, perhaps, the overdetermination of 
personality, fabric, animation, engineering, structure. Thus a situation 
in which the spectator is read, held in abeyance: it is the gaze of the 
avatar towards the spectator, not the other way around.

From this moment on, the completion of the image and its presentation, all 
of the usual is in evidence - male and female gaze, punctum, power and 
strategy. But these are not necessarily inherent in the modeling session 
itself, which contains its own modes of representations, its own engin- 
eerings, continually playing off the deployment of power and sexuality 
within a situational as-if, a situation set-aside as the dream is always 
elsewhere.

And so one's body is an immanent form of exchange; for both avatar and 
modeler - or procurer - it is a rite of passage. Were it not for the 
inertia of sexuality, the weight of the caress of light, hir body would 
become invisible, totalized: nothing and everything simultaneously. Its 
visibility for you would be its invisibility for hirself, of course, of 
course ...

And

One is always concerned about the revelation, appearance, of the sexual 
organs, which transform the avatar into a map, an area of striations 
governed by the logics of gesture (non-distributive, non-Boolean) and 
transversals. For here is where secrecy lies; here is where the gift 
results in an annihilation akin to orgasm, an circumscription of the 
flesh. At a certain point - at every point - the flesh is emptied of 
tissue, content; it is all structure, polygons. At a certain point, 
there's nothing left to give; at a certain moment in pornography, a 
_pornographic moment,_ the horizon of death meets the totalization of 
organs, and so on. Thus I am reduced, and this annihilation is my comfort; 
I am become avatar and the session is close to an end. I lose myself in 
the absence substance and its anguish, the medieval substance of light, 
just as Flaubert loses hirself in buzzing materiality and simulacra: 
St-Antoine before rescue by the Signifier Of The Sun. Now the avatar is 
not the signifier of the body and this absolute reduction is reversed only 
by the occasion of time, the closure of the modeling software, and the 
psycho-sexualized denouement of the subsequent events in the virtual world 
with its secrets.

Compare this to modeling for a painter. Here one remains, hour after hour, 
in a useless position (useless passion); the pose (which originally had 
_content_) becomes a frozen signifier reverberating against the stillness 
of the flesh. Nothing pleasant in this news from nowhere -

With avatars, the pose and its accouterments are _everything,_ and 
everything prepares for them. I make a pose and the avatar holds it; _I 
release it;_ the body moves through the image. The image is imaginary; the 
body is always on the way to somewhere. (And when I make this avatar, make 
you, I love or hate you for it; I am never neutral...)

When I model hir, I desire hir, desire the avatar and hir inconceivable 
performance, desire this which targets my body, re-possesses it; if s/he 
is clothed, hir body fulfills the function of clothing; if s/he is naked, 
everything is gone, devoured, _spent._

(Is there not a void, rupture, between technology and body, between 
superstructure and base, through which desire flows, a mediation which 
transform body into fantasy? What I desire is an extension of the world, 
its caress; what I desire is loss, and its desire.) 

This is a form of giving, this devouring. The avatar body is the _anorec- 
tic body,_ the body as absolute signifier, impenetrable; this is the body 
of exchange, the body of late capital in which commodification and the 
fetish become one and the Same. The pure commodity - the cohesive body - 
avatar body - gathers light, reproduces it as a form of abjection. 
Abjection, since light and body are no longer being and not-being, self 
and not-self, neither one thing nor another (the absent entity which 
exists in the temporal interstice of the shutter/ shudder); the avatar 
becomes a re-presentation, simultaneously short-circuiting the modeler 
(user, engineer, master, baiter) and the everyday. Orgasm flows into the 
light; the self coagulates (a promise of coagulation) against the grain of 
the negative - the avatar develops, is fixed, annihilated. Engineering and 
modeling are the inverted double of the body of the shaman, and the shaman 
is androgynous.

Thus engineering and avatar mediate between the real (evidence in the 
"scientific" sense) and the imaginary (the eccentric space of the erotic): 
an entity embedded into substance, or an entity promising substance and 
embedding - an entity existing only in the virtual, as hard as any other 
tissue.

What I am is what I have; what I have is what s/he is; what s/he is, is
what I am; what I am belongs to hir (plateau of skin, flesh of screen of
flesh). What is ceased (embedded) remains in shadow; what is evident
in the light is evidence and light is everywhere. Light embeds and re-
produces; light presences, rewrytes hir again and again.

Back from the engineering, the screen, the model modeler - which provide 
the occasion (fulfilled by the event and its descriptions) - there is that 
necessary distrust, that focus of excitement, excitation: what can we do 
together? What is the _license_ of the image? (What is the arrangement of 
my, hir, desire? Hir occasion?) My avatar is arranged, rearranged in 
(every conceivable (thus appearing that inversion in which my existence is 
presence and loss)) position; it is the heraldic body, emblematic (of its 
presence, the presence of substance, father-mother). Clearly hir body is 
an opening towards the light; hir body apparent, appears, a parent; s/he 
open hir body for me, avatar for you.

I am restrained. In this fashion I hardly know hir, 1 on 1 side of the 
screen, 2 on the other. The light becomes a familiar caress (it is not 
daylight; it is litigation, the negotiation of the Law in this software, 
in this viewer, this hardware wetware); I confess everything. What you 
want is what you get. What I engineer is the inverted double, and I 
perform for hir. Like a service, I perform for hir, perform for myself, 
perform hir. I cannot (to be frank) look in a mirror; I avoid hir eyes. I 
perform for dead files which bring hir flesh to life; s/he brings me to 
life, the restoration which is the presence of flesh. The memory of flesh. 
The memory of non-existent flesh. Flesh is its disembodiment. S/he is the 
story which surrounds me. S/he are the beginning of narrative.

What s/he pulls out of me is an object. An avatar. That avatar is an 
image, is substance. That avatar cures; s/he is shamanic, mediating the 
real against itself. There is nothing spiritual here, in this shamanism; 
there is only the presence of desire, arousal, speech, narrative, pathos, 
vehemence, intention, the circulating of the real, the collapse of 
fantasm, theory, language, against the reality of the flesh and its 
excitation. Which becomes a totality, transforms avatar, hir body into 
liquidity, the return of the caress.

If I perform for hir, s/he are the proof. If I perform hir. (S/he does me, 
does me in.) I was this way, that way. I become hir, hir body, hir organs, 
absent, mathetic production (the penetration of simultaneity, the absence 
of time). I don't think, didn't think. That slow and deliberate movement. 
I offer hir, me. Service. My arms, legs, torso, thighs everywhere. What I 
did was slow, unlike me, then frozen. The thing flows; _it_ flows; the 
avatar is impotent, insistent; what is the time of the virtual? Time 
smears the image (which is completed by perception; it completes me). 
Nothing occurs in the engineering; the engineering is all that occurs. 
Nothing moves, or is movement a representation?; clocked, the appearance 
of movement. (Hey Barthes, maybe the punctum occurs _elsewhere,_ the real 
inversion of real flesh occasioned by the avatar - hir image only 
residue?) Arrangements, the absence of light, our gifts to each other. My 
acknowledgment of 'my' avatar, is never returned, and that is hir power 
and the flesh of hir power.

And this anorectic state is the perfect body; the residue is present or 
absent, here or there, digital. The shudder of the session from the very 
beginning is given purity as the horizon, the endless perfection of 
withdrawal. Such withdrawal tends towards denouement, abjection, towards 
that horizon which returns the everyday as absolute. Thus the everyday 
guarantees abjection; I engineer hir in an hysteric state in which time 
stops. My body and hir body - of the anorectic - are carved, carved out; 
in body, I gladly spend myself towards the safety and solitude of death. 
In both I am hole again.

Carnival, plateau, perforations of the body. Everywhere illuminations. I 
desire hir, desire the endless peregrinations of hir engineering, hir 
engine, I desire hir presence within me.

So this is a case of theft and desire, like sado-masochism, this is the 
desire of the illicit granted by negotiation opening up a forbidden 
interiority in which presence is lost and gained. Just as I am always for 
work, you are always for production. And this world, lost of late, lost of 
capital, is all the capital I have to spend. (So take it fast...the loss 
of limbs...irreparable loss...the _fade_ of sexuality...thinking...return 
of the engine...avatar caress...others...theirs.....bringing them to 
light...bringing them up...engineering...making it hole again...)

Azure Carter, voice
Foofwa d'Imobilite, voice
Alan Sondheim, violin, voice, Khmer tro sau
http://www.khmerculturalcenter.org/phlengkar/kcc_trosau.htm

The Cambodian tro sau is related to the Chinese erhu; it has two strings 
tuned a fifth apart, and the bow hair goes between then. The upper side of 
the hair plays one string; the lower side plays the other. There is no 
fingerboard; the strings are stopped by touch alone.

So these are experiments in voice and bowed instrument - there's a lot
of room for improvement, but the results are interesting.

My own music is awkward, unbalanced, resonant between the organic and the 
instrumental body; it tends towards a broken or wounded mastery. My hands 
attempt what, for me, is impossible - there's always _this gesture_ that 
falls short, flat, irresolute, noisy. And at times it's as if the piece is 
in a hurry to end, before the refrain or timbre gives out. And from this 
comes a mis/shaping, mis/recognition that opens territories of future 
compression and release. Rather to move on than hold on; rather to move 
than die.



beings of nothingness

o words beneath the sheets, improvisational music beneath the sheets, 
improvisation & all the while the continued turmoil of the sounds in 
shame, shame at improvisation, beings of nothingness and unable to make 
anything of that beyond that emptiness, that time when the instrument 
silence, are utterly silenced, dully and murmuring, whispering what a 
shame THIS ONE cannot play, THAT ONE cannot play in tune ...

o limits of music improvisation, of textual comprehension - i worked at

prim, construct, choreography, improvisation, projection, even theory 
taking a backs-eat as improvisation insists on Jennifer where my own 
playing is improvisational; i will pick a scale to begin with; like a 
cyclone, the music is improvisational, working out a language and screen 
to accompany them, the whole thing an improvisation of the improvisation. 
improvisations last from seventeen to thirty minutes. the left-hand is 
contingent, improvisational, a cumulative character with each chapter soft 
and sweet, a solo improvisation, and you might be aware of this as an 
improvisation. i am for fast improvisation as well. i use two other 
keyboards by the way - both improvisations & all the while the continued 
turmoil of the videos in us as we stop masturbating, he's not even getting 
a improvisation, but isn't with it, i don't want to reshoot it as a master 
improvisation which allows mise-en-abysma clearly-cleaning polka

the limits of music improvisation, of textual comprehension - I worked at 
it, but by _body twitches,_ derailed muscle-memory, improvisation or

dance, jazz, improvisation, sports - just about anything in improvisation, 
for example, what occurs, occurs in an expanded time within the real-time

of improvisation, the abject asserts itself. but what is in improvisation

new! - 5 Hausa raft-zither solos

1: on the large zither, preparatory to the others.
2-4: large raft zither solos with an amazing range of effects,
including harmonics, guzheng-like finger movements, and so forth.
5-6: small raft zither, with a range of different effects,
including guzheng movements and grass-string-bending.
slight echo added. recorded with zoom recorder.
amplification of the zithers through contact mics into a small
portable amplifier.
otherwise none of the sounds were modified.
very happy with the direction of these pieces, something new for me!

READING.TXT

I've been going through old text archives tonight and found the following: 
http://www.alansondheim.org/READING.TXT [July 1995] It's somewhat 
embarrassing, groping, tawdry, more literal than I'd like, blind-folded, 
cauterized, decrepit, awkward, centered somewhat around the event of 
Michael Current's death, stylistically poor, owing too much to various NY 
schools, gone down the hatch, occasional bursts of something, occasional 
John Giornoesque-manque, lurid, murderous story-telling, Ballardic, 
oceanic for obscure reasons, despairing, suicidal, neurotic, eurocentric - 
in other words check it out. And I forget what READING it was used for - 
where the words died in the air, what futility led me to think these 
things could be pronounced in an interesting way...

Then there are these two old course descriptions, might be of interest -

NEW COURSE AT THE NEW SCHOOL, NYC:


*BEFORE AND AFTER THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY*
                                               
With public attention drawn to the 'information highway,' camcorders,
multimedia, and a host of other information technologies, it is
apparent that a revolution in communications is underawy. We will
examine this transformation, using postmodernism and contemporary
media theory. In so doing, we will focus on both past and future,
from the history of television and radio to the 'transparent' virtual
reality world of the next millennium. 

This course is a must for anyone interested in contemporary modes of
entertainment or communication. Everything from a brief non-technical
overview of the technologies involved, to the actual content of these
modes, will be presented, including the new forms of subjectivity and
personal communications (such as computer bulletin boards) that are
emerging. Issues of space and time in virtual reality will also be
considered.

Topics include digital vs. analog communications, the internet, the
'new information order,' gender and communications, postmodern
geography and telecommunications, computer bulletin boards, camcorder
aesthetics (including issues of privacy, sexuality, oral history, and
personal expression), multi-media at home and business, the emergence
of new `languages' of expression, ELECTRONIC SUBJECTIVITY,and an 
overview of recent (1895-the present) communications history.

o julu twine of the leaving world

http://www.alansondheim.org/o.mp4 leaving the world, the long slow music 
digitized, hands removed from things, fleeing away, carrying emptiness 
which has always existed, the exhaustion of the world left behind -
no virtual, no virtual beyond, the labor lost once the thing sets into 
motion, but the labor of capital, ceaselessly drawing and redrawing, 
ceaselessly withdrawing, the vacancy filled by illumination, they have 
never been mine, they will never be mine, there and already probably 
disappearing, somewhere off world and worlds, sometimes returning to 
inventory and the production of accountancy, enumeration, sometimes 
unraveled, forgotten...

the frame, after the last frame, the frame

tiny interior of the womb of hir dancing
all of these need nothing but image and sound, flesh and voice
none need compensators, linguistic anchors
states of minds, operators across virtual bodies
try and again i make the situation of my life
a slip would ruin everything, there are no slips
severing the links of memberment
joining the links of dismemberment, prims have no memory
when was someone here, when did someone do this
when has someone left, why are we always in mourning
s-he cannot move a frame more, nor would s-he
s-he has always already disappeared, s-he already taken out
as if to something, some event, s-he has gone, left us
there was nothing on the other side of the hill
there was no other side, there was no hill
s-he did not know that i did not know that, you did not know that
what we know we do not know
what we know is nothing, and we do not know nothing
the frame after these frames, o loss
not knowing loss, our mouths open to skies
no words, nothing emergent
frame, no glimmer of light, a dark matter
darker matter, frameless

dead origin

 For the thinking of the educated man of our time land surveying is a 
 _dead origin._ (Suzanne Bachelard, Phenomenology and Mathematical
 Physics)

the dead origin, the arbitrary dead-point of orthogonal or otherwise 
disjoint vectors, Weyl's ego-vestige, yet an irradiation of emptiness 
whose ratio to mass-length tends towards zero - there's a joy here, in 
absence, in a wilderness of the discrete and infinitely small, as if 
nothing remained.

the dead origin is a _closed set_; what opens - tendrils - opens from 
without, but so close, so intimate! implanted life is that edge of the 
urge at lip or nub, an urge generated by the universal constitution of 
biochemistry in this particular cosmos.

the dead origin is the memory of memory, memory which grows, striations, 
among the tendrils, primordial coding of what would be constituted as 
events, histories, origins.

'i could go on, but why bother? nothing touches the detumescent, nothing 
reaches beyond this anti-punctum, manque or the loss of idea. i shall 
inhabit the future anterior of the subjunctive, having already received 
your reply.'

PipaBiwa and Slover

Listen to the pipa:

Listening to biwa recently; it relates to the pipa and oud. So thinking 
through biwa through pipa, and for once pipa pieces that can hold their 
own without falling back into Chinese traditional sounds. So it relates to 
the old pipa tradition - a somewhat different instrument, played with a 
large pick, held horizontally. But then it's reversed again, I'm not using 
picks at all, opting for nylon-wound pipa ADE, and nylon a, instead of 
metal; my nails remain intact. So then the nail techniques are from 
everywhere, including cura cumbus, saz, classical guitar, all oddly picked 
themselves. So then the music has a lot of rat-a-tat and puncta combined 
with banjo and ukulele techniques thinking through martial pipa but more 
likely tales of the Heike.

Then there's the din software, described by James Morris (thanks!), which 
I installed in Ubuntu, not without difficulty; it's used as you might 
suppose for a drone piece that's only 160k mp3, since it's going into a 
Second Life installation; it's somewhat interesting. You can 'play' the 
software in interesting ways, and its quirkiness - which reminds me of 
AudioMulch - is fascinating.

Avatar Absence Erasure Performance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

thus at the limits of explanation,

the _draw distance_ is beyond the avatar, stutters, operates within range, 
stumbles, moves, redefines position, filters objects in the whole wide 
world, strobes backgrounds, flashes objects, drains seas, cauterizes 
skins, retrieves supplements, performs in the absence of performances, 
dancing the virtual. the inherent plasticity of virtual worlds, sheaves 
cutting through psychologically apparent phenomena, is evident in deep 
phenomenological illegibility. the sense of logos, encoded, recuperable, 
aristotelian or quantum, is fundamentally shattered. what might have been 
considered primordial turns on confusion. ultimately nothing gets through 
the ground which may be abandoned. what occurs is a form of shepherding or 
collusion of affect; it's just those ways. beyond all of this, one would 
need access to the database itself, as if decoding were possible, and as 
if that possibility turned further into a clarity of mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the texture-object: INVISIBILITY PRIM PUBLIC v1.1a by Beatfox Xevious:
"SL has a few special system textures that are only accessible by UUID key 
and that possess properties which no other textures do.  Namely, a prim 
using one of these textures is capable of rendering whatever avatar 
textures and textures containing alpha channels are inside or behind it 
completely invisible.  Normal textures that do not contain alpha channels 
will remain untouched."

red-eared slider turtle romp

screwed up pal version of 1/4 turtle romp sped up 700 % anyway
this goes on daily here with considerably more deliberation and
less speed; her thoughtful pauses give cause for metaphysics.
meanwhile i ponder on pixel aspect ratio and how consumer soft-
ware can screw things up so badly. think of this as a test video
with benefits. enjoy.

per-form
because of the absence so the muscle appears
and not so intelligent because of the muscle
which does one thing well, to move another to
move not love an other thing. you have the whole

you do that one thing well.

now

encapsulation of phenomenological presence: always already behind but the 
command is instantaneous (paralleling loop quantum geometry to the extent 
that between nows, there is no time). (paralleling a certain positioning 
within which there never has been time, within the inaccessible singular- 
ity of now, thinking of husserl of course.)

so that we can say, at least on a human scale, the digital represents very 
little, if anything: only the gaps, sutured by our senses, as if the world 
were continuous. for us, it is the suturing the constitutes the appearance 
of the digital; the appearance is neither this nor that.

strings or loops or points or wheeler's foam: it always breaks down some- 
where. and here, it breaks down, invisibly, only in the performative which 
hangs somewhere temporally invisible.

it's of interest, psychologically, to note that the 'now' is always a 
deferral, a reading occurring after the fact, but collapsed into an/other 
fact, or rather facticity; further, that such readings are the occasional, 
among organisms, of gatherings, collocations, collectivities: for neither 
one nor the other reads each now individually, as if each were fecund with 
its own history, accessed through the dialectic of historiographies.

for who among us could count them, and such counting, such duration, would 
always be later, not latent, or rather latent to the enunciation, not to 
the encounter: the encounter itself does not exist.

further, the fact is not a fact _of_ the digital; it has no place among 
truth-tables or other setups.

in fact the now is already dead, as if it were alive, a hermeneutics of 
bluster so to speak, just as the origin is already dead, in and out of 
enunciation: the now, smeared through the very act of accession, loses its 
value as a token, becomes - no matter what the history - an absence within 
the tomb of equivalences.

the digital, in being here, is not here: it is nowhere. thus it is always 
without extrinsic foundation, characterized as well by an intrinsic and 
logic, displayed, again as always, after a fact which can never appear.
