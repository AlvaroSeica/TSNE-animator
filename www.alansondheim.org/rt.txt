http://www.alansondheim.org/quikstudy.mp4 silent

sometimes i feel like the weather
like the weather looks like the weather looks at me
silent i am and i am feeling the looking great eyes
of grain and luster 

and you record and collect what you can and play back
and play up what you can this weather you see not the
gluon or the quark you see the scattering you see not
the boson you see the scattering and you learn to read
you learn to read the scattering carefully you note
the doublets and triplets carefully you note the
solitary sometimes i feel like the weather want to
forget the signifier mark forget the token forget the
bound boundary forget the binding forget incision want
to forget suture forget difference forget differance
forget deferment to the sky to the meridians of sky
to number numerical to decimal decimate sometimes i
feel like the weather unreading unthere sometimes
where the weather is i am sometimes i am unthere

Little Jim

http://www.alansondheim.org/littlejim.mp4

Little Jim wanted to go to the big Ball Game.
Little Jim sat on the Goal Post and was very
happy. We cheered Little Jim. He was called
Little Jim because he played Goal Post Ball
at the Jim and the Jim was small but not as
small as Little Jim who fit inside when Goal
Post Ball was being On, which means when
there were many People around doing Things
that Little Jim was watching. Now You can
watch Little Jim and it is fun for You. And
it would be fun for Little Jim except but 
for he is watching.

Music: philosophical positioning / experimentation music

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1008 (best)

What's clear is that living organisms and their place 
within a phenomenology of the cosmos is in the process 
of being determined, to increasingly fine tolerances, 
by molecular biologies, cosmologies, physics, and 
mathematics. The image-imaginary that results is on 
the order of a structured response undergoing 
increasingly fine tunings as a result. On this level, 
there is little to be said; how one, for example, 
interprets a multiverse is moot/mute and irrelevant 
- what is of value is the potential epistemology of 
universal splittings.

Musico-philosophical positioning

Music experimentation with the prayer of warding off death.

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/mysolace91.mp3

[1. from before; 2. new and descriptive.]

2. What's also clear, in my own sound productions, is that what I give 
you, as gift or token, is an interval of lived-time, real-time, on my 
part; that what you hear is what I was doing, that this doing will 
continue long after I'm dead, until the file is erased. This lived-time is 
well-ordered on recording, and well-ordered on playback; if t0 < t1 < t2 
in the original, then t0 < t1 < t2 in the listening; all listening here is 
copy, and the original exists ontologically elsewhere, in the movement of 
flesh and mind, in the construction of the piece, which is the image of 
the piece. So in relation to my fear of death, which borders on the phobic 
or compulsive (I victimize myself with catastrophic thinking), I create 
these images, image-pieces, one after another; they are indicative, as I 
reiterate here, of _what I have done,_ _what I was thinking and doing,_ 
_what occurred during my intentionality directed in lived-time,_ between 
me and instrument and later post-production in order to produce a copy, 
which is the original which is a copy, as clear and lucid as possible to 
the original. (Of course in the future, these codecs may be played at 
other speeds, or not even recognized as music; that makes little 
difference. I've done what I can; this isn't science but the vagaries of 
creation, as if there were an open field replete with wavering protocols 
and decisions.) And below is a recording of the sung lisu tuned in 
fourths, with strings of equal width which is traditional for the 
instrument; in other words, the tuning is by tension alone, and the lower 
string has a 'whang' to it as a result. I learned as I played in the 
tuning, learned how to control the whang, how to bring it forward in the 
sound, how to handle it delicately enough so that it doesn't interfere or 
appear out of tune. I did this in real-time, lived-time, on the fly, which 
is what you are hearing, so part of what you are hearing is my thinking 
about this, as the rest of the world drops away, and I am able to continue 
living, at least a little longer.

Musico-philosophical detour

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1010 (best)

3. searching for basis on instruments slightly detuned. I am an 
aural-audible wanderer; the sung lisu, smoothly born with a 
long shamisen-like fretless and unmarked neck, needs constant
adjustment in relation to the low string. Playing up-tempo can
only help create the illusion of coherency. The speed of the
world results in simultaneous fragmentation and suturing: make
the breathless mind, and the virtual becomes whole. The sarangi
is in-cohering with the tamburi, but there are way-points that
function momentarily, and the result is a wandering dirge in 
search of a non-existent fundamental ground. What occurs, just
as with the sung lisu, is something oddly reminiscent of daily
life, instead of closure by chord or speed at the end of more
traditional compositions. Think of the world and the nomadic,
and how often notes aren't hit on target, but are approached
as if structure were self-sustaining, although structure is
broken, peculiar, signifying the death of classical mathesis,
opening the maw of abjection, incoherency, tincture and odor
of collapse.

Combination, chora, cooling - philosophico-music experimentation

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1011 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/allsolace.mp3

4. The mysolace experimentation pieces are combined into
a single production. Background is tamburi and electronic
tambura; foreground are the inchoate workings of alignment.
Since the originals were different lengths, the separate
pieces drop out one after another, until one alone emerges
and continues. So there are two backgrounds - the various
drones metaphorically providing an image of string theory,
of microwave background radiation (MBR), of groundwork -
and the backgrounds of string and woodwind instruments in
a constant state of virtual presence tending towards 
emergence. The thickness is lost. The remaining piece 
embodies drone, foreground (ghijak), and brain-waves at
two frequencies. The universe is simultaneously tuning-up
and emitting. What is chaotic is inchoate; what is inchoate
is not necessarily chaotic. In this work the chaotic itself
dissolves as a result of the mp3 (or any other - I have a
.wav that sounds clearer but is much larger) digitization
and compression; randomness underlies everything including
the real-world plucking of a string with all the implied
resonances at war with the physics of materials from 
string to surface to traveling waves to damping phenomena 
to the instrument's and performer's bodies to the weather
itself. And the universe? Simultaneously tuning-down and
emitting, entropic, always thinking in remote corners,
always at a loss.

male, neutral. Endings will be constructed as -she, -he, and

New old saz and flute

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1015 (best)

I finally found an absolutely amazing saz at Music Inn;
it's an Ahmet Tekeli, from Turkey, 1961. It needs some
slight adjusting and needed repair but sounds beautiful;
I recorded a long instrumental piece and a short coda.
Later, I recorded a short melody for tamburi and flute.
The saz is tuned low and sonorous roughly in fifths. Do
listen, at least a bit, at least for the beauty of the
instrument itself.

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/melo3.mp3
 -- saz with six strings --
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/melo2.mp3
 -- violin with azure carter, tamburi --

the saz nut (where the strings leave the pegs and
enter the fingerboard) is so worn down that it's
impossible to hold the strings in place; as a 
result, two were taken out, and six remain. the
effect is that of a leaner, more despairing sound
i think. still the untempered scale works wonders
and the result is like the starts and stops of
everything else in my life.

along with this, there's a violin piece, mainly 
on the high string. - enjoy.


=========================================

dead music

=========================================

i do dead music: music of the dead, music by the dead, music for 
the dead. sometimes someone listens over my shoulder until our 
bones fall off. our bones are bright bracelets but the music goes 
out. sometimes someone does dead music. yes because the dead are 
eternally with us, and my music, at least to me, appears 
stillborn. I'm not sure what you mean like all elements; objects 
have resonances but if they're chaotic enough they'd cancel out. 
Meanwhile for us humans most music dies unrecorded and probably 
unheard except for the musician - because I work the graveyard 
shift. because there's nothing dreamed of in this world, there's 
just the world. because the world does not dream. because it does 
not i do dead music. my saz was made by ahmet tekeli a famous saz 
player. there is a picture of him in Rebecca Bryant, The soul 
danced into the body: Nation and Improvisation in Istanbul. the 
label reads Figure 5. Saz greats in a _meyhane_ (bar/restaurant): 
Left to right, Semsi Yastiman, Kastamonulu Yorgansiz Hakki Baba, 
and Ahmet Tekeli in Kastamonu, 1967 (courtesy of Sinan Yastiman). 
my saz now has violin pegs, six working strings, a bridge 
positioned upon veneer, a somewhat damaged headstock, a poorly- 
painted bowl (black), and cracks. the sound is the sound of the 
dead. on my suroz, the sound is the sound of the dead. do i play 
for myself. i imagine all instruments in flight from the open 
window ascending silently into the sky. i imagine they call for 
me. tonight i walked among them strumming the open strings. they 
say, whatever you do is insufficient, your hands are torn and 
crippled, your mind bedraggled, you think about death and your 
thinking is a dream. i cannot reply unless i dream, and my dreams 
are nightmares of death and close-knit families internally torn 
apart. on the saz i play without error and without tradition, i 
know no songs, i cannot sing anyway. to listen and play dead music 
is to inhabit the ashes of the world. the world unsung has no 
history, no moments. it is the singing of the world that 
transforms sound into speaking, that gives stories the strength of 
continuing the history of death. our history is the history of 
death and there is not, even for a moment, any other history. we 
do not revive the past, we are drawn into its graves, we are 
already accumulation and abyss. among ourselves with think we are 
talking. if you listen to a recording of my saz you can imagine 
fingers in motion, the light weight of the instrument, the 
smoothness of the neck, the roughness of the sound-board from so 
many players. it is all grey, the color of non-existent when the 
first whites and last blacks transform into last blacks, first 
whites. that moment when death seeps through and you realize 
nothing has seeped in all eternity, it has always been what we 
interpret in shuddering as motion and meaning, just as we are 
forgetful and the promise or premise of the fecundity of infinite 
worlds dies before the music has even a chance of becoming-music, 
when it appears to take up residence, reside. besides, you do not 
listen, and if you did, you would have to always listen, have 
always listened. just in order to make an other order, to make an 
other. which you cannot do. which is why i play for myself and it 
is always an appeal and always unappealing. it refuses the 
raggedness of enlightenment when something crackles and you 
believe you are transformed. but the mountain is still a mountain. 
the mountain always was a mountain. the solace of geologic time 
transforms it into flatness. notes are never carved, they appear 
dream-like to inhabit the air. they do not. they are not heard. 
there is possibility of hearing. there is no hearing. there is no 
life, there is either death. there is no history and no death. 
there is none of this. there is no writing. there is no sounding 
and no sounding-out. nothing is heard. all music is dead music. i 
do dead music. i do dead music: music of the dead, music by the 
dead, music for the dead. i do nothing. in figure 5, ahmet stares 
at the camera with an odd expression. he is on the right. he 
appears related to me. i am playing his saz which has been changed 
through history. it is not his image and it is not ahmet and he is 
not looking at anything. every statement precedes with a codicil 
and is followed by a codicil. the codicil is mute. the codicil 
enunciates the end of the universe within an imaginary belonging 
to the text. to the statement. to every statement. the codicil is 
continuous reiteration. it precedes and follows everything. it is 
within everything. it precedes and follows every word. it is 
within every word. it precedes and follows every letter. it is 
within every letter. it is within every sound. it is within the 
sound of the saz. it is within the string and the vibration of the 
string. it is the texture and textile of dreams. it precedes and 
follows dreams. it is within dreams. it is not imaginary. the 
codicil is the music of the dead, music by the dead, music for the 
dead. but we are dead.

seven notes that didn't head towards consonance
oh yes they tried, they yearned, but i refused
it was this that held my mind together
refusing the consonance, keeping them scurrying

it was in that fashion that they never left or arrived
they marched to and fro, they murmured, they pleaded
it was in my fashion to hold keep them in abeyance
after all nothing was ever promised, nothing at all

i was honored tonight by the saz of ahmet tekeli
he gave me permission to play endlessly on and on
without the gift of reciprocity, without beginning
without end, somewhere one had to stop, someplace one
 had to desist

now these seven notes have saved my life
and nothing will ever resolve again
the scissors remain open, the wound never heals
ecstasy never leaves the place, alive or dead

seven notes that didn't head anywhere
seven notes without the gift of ending or beginning
seven notes that didn't head anywhere at all




The Standard National Corpus


The following was written for Scott Kildall's "Imagine 2049" project,
at http://www.imagine2049.com . Scott wrote "Do you want to submit an 
invention for the future? Taking online submissions for the next few days 
only. All of this goes in a time capsule." I was delighted to take part.


The Standard National Corpus


Around 1962 I was at Hebrew University in Jerusalem; the Hebrew language 
was undergoing rapid change as it was continually updated to adapt to 
contemporary life. I remember in particular, when I arrived, the word for 
'airplane' was 'aviron'; it was later formally changed to 'matos' which 
stemmed from Hebrew, not European roots. Today either word is acceptable 
according to Segal/Dagut's English-Hebrew Dictionary. The basic concept 
behind these changes was to create a purified language with as little 
linguistic borrowing as possible. Later, I noticed the same thing in 
Montreal, in the debate over the Quebecois language - whether or not to 
eliminate anglicisms, whether the anglicisms were inherent to Quebecois, 
and so forth (see 'joual' in Wikipedia for exampe). These debates have 
occurred all over the world as nationalisms put up barriers in order to 
create theoretically-pure lexicons reflecting theoretically-pure national 
groups. I propose a formal software program for linguistic purification. 
It would examine the current state of a language, as well as its history 
for at least several centuries. This can be accomplished by collating 
acceptable vocabularies. From this, it should be possible to weed out 
words of 'foreign' origin, especially if they're of recent appearance. The 
definitions of these words could be then be used to create alternative 
words based on the language's 'native' roots and resources.

Once all of this is done, of course, it will be announced to the local 
population who will surely adopt the substitutions; everyone is happiest 
with purity! Furthermore, the updating can be continuous; in this way, 
eternal vigilance is the guarantor of the strength and depth of native 
stock. No GMOs (genetically modified organisms) here!

Finally, of course, this idea of automated purification can be applied to 
any number of different areas - don't worry, we'll stay away from eugenics 
but we will include animal breeding! - ensuring that any nation's natural 
culture and inclinations (as well as borders and tariffs) will continue 
forever!

oud nearing the end of illness

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1020 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/oudflu.mp3

returning to playing again, trying to think, and oddly
this is probably the most unique oud playing i've done;
it really brings out the range of the Shehata instrument.
i wanted to play in close, develop clusters; the result
isn't anything i've heard before. some of the fingering
technique is from my violin or viola playing; the right
hand is on its own. there's almost a gaiety at work,
fractured and coalescing. enjoy.

confession

i realize my music is barking up the wrong tree.
my music is absolutely useless and misshapen.
it's not zen, it's just clumsy.
i'm lucky if i can hit intervals at all.
consider this a wordy piece of silence.
it's an admission of guilt in the production of bad music.
it's an admission of tricks and subterfuge with instruments.
i dream of fires of wood and steel strings singing their
 final songs.
i dream of boats of woods and steel struts carrying
 refugees away from me.
i hear differences where none are and nothing where
 differences are.
i hear innovation where there's nothing but tired 
 repetition and i hear melodic repetition where i'm 
 running out of ideas.
i jump from instrument to instrument as i exhaust my
 limited resources on each one.
i jump from speed to speed to impress and disguise the
 fact i can't hold a note for any length of time.
my instruments are beautiful and deserve better.
you are accurate in your assessment that there's too much
 of my music around, too much craziness, too much 
 exhaustion.
i pretend to focus on technique and exercises when all 
 i'm doing is trying something out with an impressive
 surface devoid of any depth.
my music isn't barking up the wrong tree, it's not even
 music, it's not even noise, or it's noise intended to 
 be music.
the only delight it brings is the usual shortness of the
 pieces but sometimes i err further and produce what 
 appears on the surface like a meditation but in fact is
 just a lengthy poverty of ideas.
my fingers move by themselves in idiotic patterns.
my mind stumbles in idiotic pursuit.
this confession should suffice, please control your
 anger.
there's no reason to listen to anything more.

confessions - more of the same, the end of them

the medium is irrelevant; it's the bad psychology, the
 stolen and repetitive mechanism, the lack of ideas, the
 showy exteriors, the dabbling in body, sex and language.

i realize my texts are barking up the wrong tree.
they're absolutely useless and misshapen.
it's not zen, it's just clumsy plagiarism.

this confession should suffice, please control your
 anger.
there's no reason to read anything of mine again.

for example,

i realize my media works are barking up the wrong tree.
they're absolutely useless and misshapen.
it's not zen, it's just clumsy plagiarism.
i'm lucky if i can program at all; i can't; i borrow
 from everyone; the underlying structures are similar
 and boring; clever camera angles cover up the rest.
consider this a wordy piece of silence.
it's an admission of guilt in the production of bad media
 art.
it's an admission of tricks and subterfuge with scripts.
i dream of virtual fires everywhere
i dream of virtual drownings and theoretical confusion.
i makes differences where none are and nothing where
 differences are.
i see innovation where there's nothing but tired 
 plagiarism and i'm constantly running out of ideas.
i use scripts to hide whatever truths there are; i steal
 everywhere, from everyone; i create the surface lure and
 an inconceivable absence of depth. 
i jump from environment to environment, performance to 
 performance, as i exhaust my limited resources each and
 every time.
i jump from style to style to impress and disguise the
 fact i haven't created anything in depth or any new idea
 that might be useful.
my avatars deserve better.
you are accurate in your assessment that there's too much
 of my media work around, too much craziness, too much 
 exhaustion.
i pretend to focus on philosophy and phenomenology when 
 all i'm doing is creating something with an impressive
 surface that belongs to everyone else, that desperately
 seeks attention, that plays fool-heartedly with language,
 sex, and body, that uses arousal as deflection from any
 real content; everyone sees through me.
my media work isn't barking up the wrong tree, it's not 
 even media work, it's not even really interactive,
 or it's simple interaction intended to disguise my 
 ignorance at any cost.
the only delight it brings is the usual confusion of the
 pieces but sometimes i err further and produce what 
 appears on the surface like a meditation but in fact is
 just a lengthy and stupid poverty of looping movement
 and ideas.
i can work myself to death that way and you'd be lucky
 if i did.
my mind stumbles in idiotic pursuit of intelligence.
this confession should suffice, please control your
 anger.
there's no reason to look at anything of mine again.

that's the end of the confessions; they're as boring 
as anything in my work.



off drone, music in mourning

 -- alan sondheim oud sarangi cura cumbus --

the tamburi drone is off-interval for this, the
result is the death of music, music mourning
music, the slow eyelids fluttering against the
dying of the sound, the yearning for completion
always on the verge of disappearance, vanquished,
gone, please listen, enjoy,



the tunnel

from zero to anything you say / and you go down this tunnel and 
you watch and here they are. further down the stalk or sides, 
quantum tunnelings, phone calls, dilations, screams. you're in a 
dark tunnel and you dream you're in a dark tunnel. you agree to 
meet. you set a time, date, place, central bone-core, flesh 
shreds hanging organelles, dark tunnels, extremely tight, east, 
looks like the very squeeze. an eerie light, and dark the long 
tunnel, opening into tunnels, tendrils lost in one long shadow 
riding the harbor to the long long island, the long tunnel, 
mapping as it entered and left the mountains which seemed quite 
long. ... and tubes, shrouded in the tunnels, an urgent segment 
of frozen space, long, the long dark tunnel, long.

trying to find a tune, something that matches the
strings, coughing throughout (you don't hear it), my
chest is a bit crazed at the moment, hack hack, but
flamenco wilding sustains me ... neither flamenco nor
wilding be ...




stars burn ice-cold and ferocious

wilding angels -
a bit of the old wilding in the neighborhood - any wilderness, 
avatartist are always working, avatartist work everywhere, mind 
filtered out into the membrane of the watery wilderness of long 
ago? through the dim wildernesses of the mind; wilderness (vast, 
spacious), wilderness vast spacious distant continuous and 
remote cliff and cave
 through the dim wildernesses of the mind

wilderness? i do not know. sublimity lies in microscopic worlds. 
"words or mode of being, no wilding.

wilderness (vast, spacious), distant continuous (and) remote
 through the dim wildernesses of the mind,
wandering in a corner is part: finding it, an other. 

i cry lalala into the wilderness! i lie in the wilderness! i cry 
lalala! 
and soft, ploughing under whatever's left, everything turning 
over violent wilderness, peaks and crags. never any moment of 
peace.

hyenas and beasts howled in the wilderness, themselves deafened 
by all noise, scribbling their way across desert remnants of the 
pristine. in the middle of the wilderness, leaning against a 
tree and crooning, your eye - 
and:i:think:i:am:the:boy:crying:wolf:in:the:wilderness:

when you were young could take the wilderness for granted. 
young, atomic,
when you were young you could take the wilderness for granted. 
when you
were young, you could take for granted.

wilderness? i do not know. sublimity lies in microscopic worlds. 
words thrived yhere, making the desert to blossom like 
wilderness with its moan of silt. for a moment it paused in the 
eddies, taking stars burned cold and ferocious.

though that path take me through the wilderness or the desert, 
vast, spacious, distant, continuous and remote cliff and cave. 
continuous and remote, and misunderstood, and flames

walls pond peak stone dong ting lake wilderness spacious distant 
seir elparan wilderness enmishpat kadesh amalekites amorites

encasing come,

iss the proof of the children in the vast desert, moaning.

such an innocent voices crying in the wilderness.
withdrawn from the teeth of the snow-time gorges,
remnant parks and paths,
i cry lalala into the wilderness! i lie in the wilderness! i cry 
lalala!

landscape without signage, some sort of wilderness, dangling, 
indefinite deaths wilding, and mutilated bodies of women and 
children, indefinite domains, inscriptions, fields, particles, 
stones, cliffs, caves, (vast,wildernessst, 
netherworld)scure,netherworld) netherworld) ((and) wildness such 
as no man or woman had seen before.

- and of wilderness and of wild places i would never see
landforms and wilderness, and desert, and stone, you and cliff,
cave, vast, continuous, and remote.

The music and the audience were great! The saxes
were amazing, Azure and I sounded good. But the
recording is terrible, too near the saxes and with
a strange standing-wave aligned with Azure's voice.
In any case you get an idea of an idea of an idea
of what we were doing and the saxes recorded
beautifully. Really bizarre!

before Chris and Jackson came. I was
"tuning up" and "unpacking." Last night
on Channel 11 Facebook was described
as extremely narcissistic so I thought
I should participate with pictures of 
me and Azure and I'm only sorry I don't
have pictures of Chris and Jackson too
or even the group that followed us 
because I was too wrapped up in tuning
and narcissism and unpacking.
