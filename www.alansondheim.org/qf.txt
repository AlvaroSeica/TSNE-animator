Some notes sent to an email list that might be of interest here -


Just some general comments - First, I'm not sure what the distinction is
between linguistic and non-linguistic. Second, related, I tend to see
culture all the way down - i.e. one might think through cultures of
reptiles, etc., and even further, plants like dodder or slime molds might
also be susceptible here. By culture I'm referencing passed on learning
that's not encoded or is only partially coded, and learning that leads to
non-determinist responses. Third, I think that language is always already
within and without bodies, that bodies are inscribed, and that inscription
is basic to organism. Heinz von Foerster said roughly the same thing in
terms of negation and Shahn Majid develops this in the sense of Venn
diagrams that are based on inscribing boundaries between x and ~x. If one
might look at fields and patterns, these meld within inscription. There is
no brute knowing, there is certainly 'muscle knowledge,' but that also is
within languaging as ball- and guitar-players know. Perhaps languaging stops
at the bordering of pain, certainly death, but pain is inscribed as if
within and without the body, simultaneously centered and decentered, and
death is transparent to inscription.

One surely thinks through intelligences, knowings, fields, and it's hard to
pin these things down. One thing comes to mind, probably as untrue as any of
the above - that labor is externally inscribed, and play internally so - one
might walk away from play, change the rules, delete, just as any
superstructure's always wobbly? But labor - I mean one might not even know
all the rules, and this ignorance is at a cost (having been let go from
university once or twice, not to mention other jobs, I'm as sure of this as
I am of my own neurosis which blinds me).

I love playing the cobza; it can sound like a miniature orchestra, even 
with an incredibly short neck. It's the shortness that allows the strings 
to fan out at the other end, so that the double and triple courses may be 
plucked as individual strings. 

The rebab is new, two-stringed from Palestine, and difficult. I've yet to 
find an online picture of this particular style.

Further notes in relation to the email list post -

Well, the internal/external thing is full of holes. But labor embodies a
fundamental exteriority - one is called upon to perform, for capital, for
survival, whereas play 'wobbles,' it's superstructural, not fundamental.
Play is an internal agreement to follow consensual rules; if it becomes a
performance for survival, capital, it's work. These are fuzzy and irreso-
lute ideas, but there's something 'about' coercion in relation to work, and
something 'about' the wobble in relation to play that I want to empha- size.
Things are murkier when rite/ritual are brought into the picture,
sufficiently murky that the distinctin might be useless.

Let's say that labor is a dwelling in an inert world and play a temporary
life within a consensual one. Labor is brute, play is chimera which may or
may not be brute. There's play at the heart of labor as one temporarily
wears or resists a world, and labor at the heart of play. But the latter is
consensual (what _is_ a baseball game), and the former, within its world, is
chosen for one.

More nonsense...

Breaking New Ground ii


all circumstances are extenuating.

"if you want to understand what they're about, perhaps these works 
will open up the vast chasm of comprehension on the edge of falling
apart - I can't think of any better pieces in this regard, and, for
that matter, in the sheer beauty of fractured movement"

works based on choreia, return, withdrawal from broken edges (before 
one is cut) (before the sound loses its grasp) (before one is cut
out (of the world) (of your acquaintance) (your grasp) (your body)
(of your body my own)).

how does one write or circumscribe the body of movement within 
horizons defined by mappings of hyperbolic geometry in the circle?
the edge isn't just asymptotic; from the outside, it's a bad pill.
what looks like chance is a battlefield; what looks determined is
incandescent birth. 

"the battlefield is your last chance of being-alive, just as your
birth is your first-chance of dying."

there are so many things these movements and sounds are not: listing

dance as a draining, symptom as style, medication-technique, how to

they start with dim memories of body, with landscapes that accompany 
us, we're hounded.

we're hounded by death, but we're also hounded by disease, troubles,
fevers, forgetfulness, wrath, rage, ecstasy, visions, poverty, money,
obligations, lovers, ennui, hallucinations, speed, crime, frustration,
cataclysm, heat, cold, hunger, thirst, nightmares, mutilations, panic,
neuroses, economies of attention, economies of the body, excretions, 
garbage, wounds, scars, allergic reactions, insect bites, age, bad 
eyesight, bad hearing, shudderings, shiverings, fear, belongings,
jealousy, loathing, disgust, addictions. 

the playing-field of hounding, playing-field of the hounded.
one hounds, is hounded; the hounded hounds, hounding is hounded.

or like this: playing-field of haunting, of the haunted. one haunts,
is haunted; the haunted haunts, haunting is haunted. "these texts,
they are haunted."

malign-benign. if i write this sentence beneath the symbolic of 
medication, bandaging, radiation treatment, dialysis. if i write this 
sentence gagged and splayed.

if i write this sentence to control you, if i write this sentence 
under your control. the order to work: persevere.

to persevere, endure, maenad-dance of self-devouring, maenad-music of
self-control. how can that be, except to ensure that the beat is 
periodic, that repetition hungers.

the maenad feeds, hungers for repetition, desecrates it (the repeat- 
ing). they passed it on so far down the line that gender-sex and sex-
gender change. they passed it down farther. 

Who were they? Who's haunting us?

Second Life Dance/Demonstration Video

(for festival)

http://www.alansondheim.org/noOne.mp4

This showcases a variety of moves and 'contrary' spaces within the current 
environment I've set up in Odyssey, Second Life. I quite like it; there's 
no message but fast body/pace always veering somewhere, never quite arriv- 
ing, but always alien/ated. Enjoy.


small narrative of demonamuh

there's water rushing pulling
water rushing pulling at the demon
human appears in lonely rituals
no one is around the demon sees her
she climbs up she slides about
the demon is very still she climbs down
she climbs about
then she climbs about
the demon is the maenad
the secret is the demon is the maenad
she has gone somewhere
where has she gone she has gone somewhere
then look about so much rushing pulling
there's a demon's head in the water
then the demon brings it to a close
the water pours across the screen
then the water pours across the screen

@X

give a number X, let's say it's reflexive with itself, and phenomenolog- 
ically this constitutes identity.

not the signifier of identity, but identity per se.

let A + B = X, and let C + D = X. then clearly A + B = C + D - equivalence 
is transitive. but now let us define a sign @ such that
A + B -@ C + D. in other words, let's say that the two additions are 
fundamentally different processes, say for the subject carrying them out. 
so that one might write X(@)A+B -= X(@)C+D - in other words, beneath or 
within @, the additions are dissimilar. now we are dealing in a classical 
realm within which history is preserved.

this is what I was working on as a child.

let's go further; we might abbreviate A + B as V and C + D as W. then V 
and W have different histories, i.e. of abbreviation as well as symbol 
content. we don't need X to say that if W = V then @W -= @V or equival- 
ently, W -@ V. unpacking W or V again adds history: in fact, _every_ 
operation recontextualizes its objects. we are also dealing in a quantum 
realm in which history is altered by the processes of perception.

this is all so simple.

it's a problem of notation.

if notation implies notating, notation is always an entanglement, always 
entangles. notation builds up hierarchically, holarchically; every return 
adds another layer. 

one can think of this in terms of _immersive_ and _definable_ hierarchies 
(something I thought about in my 20s, building on my child's work). a 
definable hierarchy is such that if A + B = X = C + D then A + B = C + D 
and if A + B = V and C + D = W then V = W = X and this is reversible of 
course and we're working with traditional mathesis, propositional logic, 
and the like. on the other hand an immersive hierarchy inhabits time (is 
inhabited by time) and (perhaps) organism, intentionality, consciousness; 
it's a different phenomenology altogether.

the difference is in the differance which lies in @. @ is an opening to 
Lacan and Kristeva, for example, not Sokal: it is what _makes a mess of 
things,_ mathematically and otherwise; on the level of the uncanny, 
presence is involved.

this presence abjures notation, inasmuch as notation is employed. notation 
_escapes._ 

in this sense one might even write @X -= @X or equally X -@ X - identity 
is problematized. what of this? that @X -= @X involves a _split_ and 
_nothing can be done with this split._ every mark is always already being 
marked, and being marked is always already being marked otherwise.

(of course hierarchy and holarchy disappear as well.)

and of course there's more: it's always possible to construct formal 
phenomenologies of immersion and @, phenomenologies of continuous organic 
transformations. but the constructing per se is on the other of @ itself, 
and substitutions have to stop somewhere, in order to avoid indefinite 
regress: either way, mess appears. (and responsibility, since moving away 
from definability means the preposterous strategy of taking organism 
_seriously._)

My publish-on-demand work


My publish-on-demand books from Blue Lion, Fort/Da, Blazevox, and Alt-X - 
Please consider ordering. The Blue Lion is just now coming out (over 500 
pages), and The Accidental Artist appeared a few months ago. These books 
are the soul of my work (such as it is); I'm close to them and I've been 
lucky that the publishers gave me free reign over content.


Azure, Nature, Digital: Blue Lion

Description - two sections: The first, with Sandy Baldwin, is on the 
phenomenology of the analog/digital, and the second is culled from the 
entire Internet Text, presenting literary/codework texts with peripheral 
philosophical content. I'm really happy that Blue Lion gave me the 
opportunity to do this, since it shows how my work hangs together and 
actually 'goes somewhere,' says something. Thanks to Peter Ganick and 
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen.

The Accidental Artist: Fort/Da

http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/the-accidental-artist/4965130
http://stores.lulu.com/publicdomaininc

This is a short and intense collection of writings around Second Life and 
the phenomenology of the virtual - I really love these texts, thanks to 
Robert Cheatham who went over them with me.


Vel: Blazevox

http://www.blazevox.org/bk-as.htm
http://www.blazevox.org/catalog.htm

These texts were produced in relation to West Virginia University's 
Virtual Environments Laboratory, and deal with motion capture, virtual 
modeling, and scanning. But the texts are codework themselves, and 
virtuality is embedded within them. Thanks to Geoffrey Gatza for this 
opportunity.

.echo: Alt-X

http://www.altx.com/ebooks/echo.html
(goes both to download and Print On Demand)

This was the first of the POD books, thanks to Ron Sukenick and Mark 
Amerika. The texts include the entire Nikuko Parable series (Nikuko and 
others appear throughout the other works as well) and other avatar- 
oriented texts.

Please consider purchasing any of the above. Please note that all of these 
publishers have amazing publications (including a great book by Sandy 
Baldwin from Blazevox) and need your support in general. And thanks of 
course.

(Finally, please note I have a paperback, The Wayward, available from 
Salt, which is beautifully typeset and covers a great deal of ground.)

This is the end of the self-promotion material - apologies if I've 
offended anyone.

For a Copenhagen talk, points to touch on -


The evolution of the piece http://www.alansondheim.org/whatremains.mp4 -

Humans are a disaster on the planet, out-of-control primates. My work is 
done against a background of mass-extinctions, pollutions (particularly of 
the ocean) that are catastrophic. We need a new species, new world, 
leaving the natural order, what remains of it, alone as much as possible.

This won't happen.

My photographs rarely have people in them. Dance is another story. With 
dance, the body does miracles, and does them without destruction. Dance 
begins and ends with the horizon of organism, organism all the way 
through.

With scanners, the body is frozen, but with resetting software parameters 
you can create images of a new body, never before seen, never seen again.

With motion capture, behavior is frozen. You can use motion capture in 
indirect ways, making and remaking the body, as if it could do things no 
body could in real life. In What Remains, there are words about remnants, 
and the body is ikonic, wayward, out of control with itself. 

Maya - illusion and its repetition - What remains after the filtering, 
after the protocols, after numeration and denumeration -

Changing software, adding dynamic filters similar to graphics programs 
filters - exactly! That's how the body is transformed. The protocols are 
intact, carrying the filters, but the informal protocols of sensor 
arrangement are altered: sensors might be distributed among more than one 
body, subject to magnetic fields, rearranged on the body - all of this 
mechanical/hardware.

So software: modifying parameters until they're out of control / creating 
behavioral/dynamic filtering. So hardware: Sensor rearrangements/ dance 
choreographies and sound-work untoward in themselves.

What remains after the orbit, after the rockets across softwares and 
hardwares. What remains, as higher ascii, particles cleaned up, text 
rendered taut and distraught. What remains, after the deluge, nothing but 
ashes, like any work, I'll work at a loss, Maya Maya ...

So there's the catastrophic always in the background...

And where does this go? Into live performance, recorded live performance, 
Second Life, almost cartoon-like, but capable of creating the _utterly 
alien,_ a real sense of alterity - that Other which might come to haunt 
us, judge us, appear in our dreamworlds, bring us down, bring _all of it_ 
down...

(kills us all

(distortions in the image: terrorisms, Abu Gharayb, world-wide torture

(on the other hand, there's always a sense of _wonder_ in these worldings:

If you look at the physics of the holographic universe, you find that the 
maximum amount of information any space can contain is proportional to its 
boundary-area. Think of this in terms of the cosmic horizon and its pro- 
jection into the interior (i.e. 'us'). Now think of Second Life or other 
virtual worlds, and their hidden protocols, etc. - this is an extremely 
crude parallel; what's seen (on the surface) is projection from an inter- 
iority, that in terms of the _visuality_ of the screen, is inherently 
scrambled. What goes on, on the surface, reflects commands given, _not_ to 
the surface, but to the database/programming. 

So that Second Life has 'triple physics':

1. The physics of the avatar, and local interactions;
2. The assigned physics of the virtual environment which is 
constructivist;
3. The phenomenology of the physics, which is inert and possibly relates 
to a holographic universe.

All three, in my work, are a form of _negotiated architecture_ - of the 
body, the programming, and the ostensible space-time environment.


note 6:
being alien is not a depiction
note 7:
i don't like being alone with my thoughts anymore
but consider the holographic universe -
consider the horizon, inaccessible, unattainable, 
examined only in bits and pieces as
related to the substructure of SL, 
which is specifiable, 
which must be specifiable _somewhere,_ 
and containing a totality of information 
in a disturbed convoluted form 
fundamentally unknowable, 
but for the work of hacker-cosmologists
opening the slightest window which may or may not
result in legibility -
there a relationship between the two,
the Second Life and the First, distanced across
inconceivable spaces harboring the greatest untoward
objects in the cosmos.
note 8
looking further, noticing something awry with reality -
the reality we're in about, on about -
a kind of loss of simplicity and innocence -
for example the wave-particle duality -
the presence of magnetic fields and action at a distance -
just so in Second Life - it's not quite right -
no matter how the introjections or projections, it's askew -
it sends you into the uncanny -
everything sends you there, first life, Second Life, all of it -
you know things are entangled, you just don't know where -
thinking about it is confusing -
everything's confusing and at a distance -
beyond that distance, everything's unattainable -




cut


there were three cuts in the field. some sort of great scythe, swath a 
meter wide. there were two flocks of birds, mourning doves, pigeons of 
course, starlings, some other birds - sparrows, starlings - two thousand 
or so. in other words "the field was full of birds." pigeons huddled on 
rooftops, i think the pigeon population increased in relation to land 
disturbance. the other birds would go extinct. kestrels had disappeared. 
issuance of voles, field mice, present. foxes disappeared. it's a taut 
selection. development, rabid, is unspeakable, no words for violation 
fabric. this is a becoming of absolutely lost, not information but its 
coherency, inhering in the land. what is being absolutely lost is always 
already virtual, hence uncanny. everywhere you look offline you see death, 
everywhere online, corporation. neither cures the other, both suffocate 
the other. i shoot video with this in mind. i'm aware that tape unlike 
film is indexical at best, one might think the film frame ikonic. what it 
points to, what tape points to, is doubled, equivalence and mapping - and 
death. every frame is a dead frame, every video frame has never been 
alive. from one field to another, aristotelian to quantum, birds and 
grasses to E and B orthogonal.

all less what we can do


we're so incredibly small in relation to the universe, our lives are as 
nothing, our minds work for a limited period, there's nothing outside of 
the planet we can breathe, enormous energies just to get to the local 
satellite, too many trillions of words, exhaustion setting in every day 
around the same time, we comprehend nothing, we're stuck with vision in 
three-dimensions, we're small primates with overly-wrought group dynamics 
and violent urges, we won't last as long as the robin, as stromatolites, 
our minds are sick, poisoned, devastating, distraught, we're lost in the 
cosmos, there isn't any cosmos, we're decentered from ourselves, we're 
self-inscribed, autonomic, we haven't bootstrapped, our energy mapping's 
muddled, we're working desperately at the command of dna-inert, we're 
spewing everywhere in reach, nothing's in reach, we're the harbingers of 
the apocalypse, we've bootstrapped the apocalypse, bootstrapped death of 
the other, we can't tell other from others, our screams are silent, we 
destroy everything around us, we scorch the earth, we invent fictions 
about how we're so important in the universe, we promulgate random tiny 
laws, we enforce penalties, we've got the cosmos locked up in daydreams, 
we've got no idea what's out there, we can't read the simplest truths, we 
abjure relativisms of all sorts, we postulate absolutes, we call ourselves 
fierce iron, we think whatever's written is inerrant, we can't imagine 
emptiness, we populate ourselves with gods, we bootstrap gods, we haven't 
got a clue, we think A = A, we think we've got identity pinned down, we 
think we know the rules, we move furiously until death, we think we've got 
a chance to survive death, we're running before senility, we're running 
around disease, we're running as if disease isn't running as well, we're 
bootstrapping disease, we postulate the finitude of infinitesimals, we 
play around with number systems, we think we're hammering number systems 
into the universe, we're using nails of flesh, body-hammers, pliers of 
tooth and bone, we bite and think we're biting fiercely, we're pulling our 
nails with levers of skin, we're crawling around, we can't face what's out 
there, we can't face our face, we've got theories before us, we've got 
theories of inscription, axiomatic theories, abject theories, we think 
we've got a hold on the truth, we think there's truth, that truth matters, 
that something matters, that there's meaning beyond us, we're bootstrap- 
ping truth, we're bootstrapping meaning, we're furious without it, we've 
got meaning our drug, we're addicted to meaning, we turn out reams of it, 
we're meaning-factories, we're inscribing everywhere, we think we're 
inscribing everywhere, we think we're languaging, we think we understand 
language, that we're the ones with language, that we're spewing sense, 
we're blind to our bodies, we're blind to the world, we're blind to 
inscription, we're blind to bootstrapping, we're blind to existence, we're 
blind to non-existence, we're blind to dimension, we're blind to space and 
blind to time, we're around the aeons of death, we're around the agora of 
ignorance, we're abyss/mal, we don't see any of this, we mouth this, we 
think we're understanding something, we think we're accomplishing some- 
thing, we're ground to dust, we're bootstrapped to dust, we're always 
already gone, we're always already dead, there's no coming back, there's 
no other places, chains of beings, compensations for lives led one way or 
another, our lives lead us, we're bootstrapped to our lives, nothing 
bootstraps us, nothing cares one way or another, we don't care one way or 
another, we're lying to ourselves, we're always lying to ourselves (what 
we can do)

I give away my art all the time. I assume no one will buy it, 
that at this point it's more of a nuisance to people than anything else.

Profits for publish-on-demand go to lulu or whomever, not to the 
publishers, not to me. Scam-spam we buy into, free intellectual property.

My music is up for grabs, why sell it when I can give it away. And who 
would pay for it anyway?

The same for my video; everything I have on YouTube or Ning or my website 
is free. "And who would pay for it anyway?"

It takes money to do this stuff, money to stay in relative (not great) 
health, money to just stay alive. What I put in is free for you.

Of course if you hit delete/kill/abort, then you're getting rid of spam, 
no matter how much spam costs on my end.

I've thought of asking for donations, but for what? Everyone should ask 
for donations, everything falls apart. Better some of us just give up and 
pass out of the scene. No worries, stress will kill us.

With at least 60,000 videos a day on YouTube, who needs mine? With lulu 
publishing, who needs my particular works, and why pay for them when you 
can download them for free from my site, lulu, whatever. Never mind the 
literal thousands of hours that go into writing/scripting/editing these 
texts.

Give away culture for free, it's my choice, isn't it? After all if I were 
any good, I'd have lots of books out, you'd find them at the bookstore. 

Giving away our culture, giving away our lives. Even free jazz guys got 
paid. A little. Almost none at all. In the Albert Ayler box there's a 
recording of a phone call.

Jazz brings imminent pleasure, you pay ten bucks at the door. Maybe. 
Writing brings nothing, YouTube, lulu, whatever else I do, yes there's an 
installation of images at Millennium here in NY, it's all free. Whatever I 
generate, free, whatever I think of, free. It's all about me, and it's not 
about me at all.

And sooner a later a stroke or whatever, and these texts will stop, the 
website will go down for lack of payment, someone will have a few files 
somewhere, they won't play -

Short prolegomenon to philosophy


Who hasn't noticed, in the midst of her dreams, that philosophy is already 
a withdrawal? She begins with the intercession of consciousness, as if 
from a distance; objects dissolve in a manner dissimilar to negation. For 
negation already has its object, and all one begins with is a sense of 
unease, that something might be missing; in this sense, philosophy begins, 
and ends, on the peripheral. The peripheral of what? Think of philosophy 
in this sense, modeled by the parallel transport of a vector in curved 
space; what is thrown off is the slight dissimilarity of fit as the 
circuit is completed. Everything is contained in this dissimilarity, which 
effects neutrality, but is in fact the punctum of the world: what doesn't 
fit isn't differentiable at this place and time, not now, not ever. The 
withdrawal occurs among slopes; dissimilarity is the residue of such.

Dissimilarity implies comparison, more than one term, distinction, non- 
integration. Here dissimilarity is against itself; the substance on one 
set of slopes is equivalent to that on the other, but the suture twists; 
in other words: the withdrawal of philosophy implies a twist. The twist is 
not a knot; it doesn't (necessarily) turn in upon itself. Instead, it is a 
twist in a metric which contains everything conceivable in eidetic reduc- 
tion, and therefore announces presence, which can only be that, or rather 
is fundamentally that, of gravity. With the use of a modified anthropic 
principle in this regard, it's evident that gravity occasions philosophy; 
it is of the order of a first occasion, inclusive of space-time and the 
whole apparatus of the cosmos.

Let us think through the philosophy of a covariant derivative which occa- 
sions both geodesics and the curvature of this space, announcing gravity, 
but philosophically also announcing paths of least resistance. What are 
the geodesics of a landscape of withdrawal? Think of these as tendrils 
tending towards metaphoricity - for how can this alterity be understood 
except as (inauthentic) alignments with the commonplace? Tendrils them- 
selves, in fact the whole structuring implied here, exist as metaphor - 
this implies a form of bootstrapping of comprehension, as it is metaphor 
("withdrawal," "intercession," "dissimilarity") that has brought us here 
in the first place. By which I mean, enabled us to reach this level of 
fictivity.

Think of structure, number, types, as idealities, "as much" ideality as 
anything else present in this wildness/wilderness. Think of the distinc- 
tion, again, between immersive and definable structures - the latter 
time-reversible if chaotic or relatively determinate, and time-irrever- 
sible otherwise. Definability implies clarity, even if that clarity exists 
only within definable tolerances; certainly the objects - eigenvalues or 
quantum numbers for example - are clear as to association. Immersibility 
implies otherwise; what's sought is thought, what's thought is sought, 
embedded in consciousness, embedded in time, fuzzy. Neither position is 
clear even in relation with the other; I tend to think of immersivity as 
associated with the analogic, definability with the digital - but even 
these meet and entangle at the limits, which pervade the whole.

This is the point: that where there is philosophy, there is contamination. 
What is within or among or beyond the withdrawal, is entangled with a 
dissimilarity, that, by its very examination, forms a knot; this is an 
overlay among the twist, inhering or cohering with or within the twist. 
While a knot may be entangled (specifically, a tangled line in three- 
dimensional space) by passing ends through loops (which may take an 
infinite amount of time in monstrous or fractal knots), this unraveling is 
only an erasure of inscription beneath the sign of inscription; in other 
words, it is thought itself, raveling and unraveling, as both operations 
become, themselves, raveled and unraveled, and so forth; there's no end to 
the levels, to the thought of the sought or the sought of the thought.

What goes forth by day goes back by day intermixed with everything and 
everyone, everywhere and everywhen, conceivable; one can continue philoso- 
phy indefinitely, or abandon it, anytime, however philosophy is conceived 
in the midst of the withdrawal of dreams, or the dreams of withdrawal. It 
is that gnawed edge of the curvature of space-time, never aligned in flat, 
Euclidean space, that keeps us going in whatever infinitesimal slice of 
the cosmos we find ourselves in. And we can't go nearer, or farther, than 
any of this, all we can do is continue writing and thinking, uselessly 
inscribing - all the while turning inward, heading towards that horizon of 
no return that might as well be black hole, geodesic, annihilation and 
entanglement.
