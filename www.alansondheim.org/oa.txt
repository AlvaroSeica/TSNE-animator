this is the one of the crenellated towers in the spectrum created
from a comb filter produced by the reading of a nineteenth-century comb
remember it turned three-dimensional with the spectrum
but still retains a relationship to the crystal palace or crystal 
cathedral
remember you forgot to remove the coordinates
http://www.asondheim.org/fetremake.jpg
this began as the fetish.jpg remember it was taken from a digital image 
made in the miami apartment shooting up from the ground with a flash
azure and i wearing robes this one is me and the robe was parted by 
the erection like the tent of abraham was it
that image elsewhere then taken through a floyd-steinberg filter 
that changes it into something like photogravure which was then sent
through photoshop
remember at first everything became messier or relatively confused
but then you applied the neon filter which lit up the edges and after
a while the result then was faded
remember you tried different kinds of fading and this one worked
turning it back into an odd three-dimensionality all the the while
you're feeling ill and feverish with a bad allergic attack and more
think it might be the flu in any case you worked through the difference
fade and then intensified the saturation and upped the curves a bit
resulting in this dream of broken lust something like jelinek 
might have written in a still image from one of her bleaker novels

others and betters if the pain is so intense so furious
we do what we can in this regard of furious pain
the elimination of our species will eliminate one iota of the world's pain
we can do no better we are of the most violent we should know better
destroying everything in our path crawling towards armageddon
animals and plants all the narrows will be open wide and poisoned
our minds are the worlds shit we dig from the earth with furious teeth
with teeth of iron slash flesh from eyes and stomachs in animal fun
how else shall we know what we are made of we alone feel pain
we will survive momentarily no longer that is fine

On Code and Codework


Consider a well-defined entity x, and its complement -x. Then x^-x = N, 
the null set. Consider a second entity y and -y, y^-y = N. Think Nx and 
Ny, the null set relativized to x and y. Consider three separable entities 
x, y, z, and take pairs xy, yz, zx. These are symmetrical yx, zy, xz. Let 
ab stand for a^b. Then xy, yz, zx are equivalent to null. Let x, y, z 
divide a planar region into three regions bordering on each other. Let x@y 
represent a line equidistant from the entities x and y. Then x@y, y@z, z@x 
all meet at a single point. Divide the plain so that all entities are 
grouped in triads; each triad meets in a single point. Divide the plain so 
that these single points are grouped in triads and so forth. What branches 
are available? Is a single point reached? To operate with x and -x such 
that x^-x = N is to operate with discrete entities common to distributive 
aristotelian logic. Now consider a second set, X, Y, etc., mapped onto the 
first; the mapping may be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one. If the 
first, the resulting mapping is reversible. If the second, it is 
reversible but the coding itself is not reversible. If the third, the 
mapping is not reversible; the result is a set of possibilities, not a 
single one. Codes are mappings. There are two types of codes, declarative 
and performative. An example of the former is Morse; it is one-to-one, but 
all that is produced is equivalence. An example of the second is Perl; 
Perl codes procedure. If procedure is coded, then the contents of the 
procedure are doubly coded. If a Perl program parses {A} to produce {B}. 
then the primary coding is the program which constructs and orders 
procedures. The secondary coding is {A} -> {B} which may be considered the 
semantic plane of the code. In Eco's A Theory of Semiotics, only a rule 
'may properly be called a '_code._' and a rule couples items from one 
system with some from another. Eco extends the possibility of code to 'a 
set of possible _behavioral responses_ on the part of the destination. 
This is performativity. In codework, primary and secondary coding are 
entangled. Entanglement may be considered noise in the system. With noise, 
the null set N is blurred across fuzzy sets with parasitic inputs; x^-x 
and x^y may be and usually are ill-defined. It is this ill-definition - 
which functions for example in current definitions of words like 'freedom' 
- that tends towards political economy. Political, because culture and the 
social are at stake in relation to the definition which is always already 
under contestation, and economy, because there are limited resources and 
examples for any particular definition. With codework, meaning itself is 
problematized as a result of entanglement. In Eco, it is the code which 
reaches a destination, not the message. The decoding of the message may or 
may not be equivalent to the source. Noise is always already present and 
is considered within the channel. This is the T-model of the parasite 
described by Serres. Eco states "When a code apportions the elements of a 
conveying system to the elements of a conveyed system, the former becomes 
the expression of the latter, and the latter becomes the content of the 
former. A sign-function arises when an expression is correlated to a 
content, both the correlated elements being the functives of such a 
correlation.' Code is a collocation or system (not necessarily the same) 
of processes; processes are performative; both are temporally-embedded. A 
mapping f(x) = y is not temporally-embedded; thus the mapping of the even 
numbers onto the number system may be considered an ideality which _is,_ 
regardless of temporal processes. The structure is given all-at-once 
within the formula (and its proof); its proof is a carrying-out of the 
truth-value, or a revealing of the truth-value, of the structure. There 
are mappings which are systemic, i.e. structure-dependent, and there are 
mappings which are non-systemic or purely heuristic, such as randomly 
assigning letters in a message to a triple number (page/line/letter- 
position) originating from a particular edition of a particular book. In 
all of these instances, of course, terms like 'system' and 'assign' are 
themselves fuzzy; nevertheless there's a tremendous difference between the 
anecdotal and the structural, and there are practical differences in the 
ensuing codes and their employment. Peter Gardenfors, in Conceptual Space, 
The Geometry of Thought, considers 'conceptual spaces' which are related 
to tessellation of the plane. This reminds one of Peirce's simplest mathe- 
matics, which is also related to Venn diagrams; in all of these, sets of 
entities and concepts in the life-world are mapped into other spaces which 
may or may not reflect thinking processes. Geometry is always bound by its 
spatial representations; there is no reason to think, at all, that the 
mind necessarily works through spatial or any representation for that 
matter. Representation is always coded; Sebeok, in Approaches to Animal 
Communication, 'Semiotics and Ethology,' points out that the 'model 
suggested here entails a communication unit in which a relatively small 
amount of energy or matter in an animal (a) the source, brings about a 
relatively large redistribution of energy or matter in another animal (or 
in another part of the same animal), (b) the destination, and postulates 
(c) a channel through which the participants are capable of establishing 
and sustaining contact. Maturana somewhere talks about such communication 
as the mutual orienting of cognitive domains. Sebeok states that 'Every 
source requires a transmitter which serves to reorganize, by a process 
called encoding, the messages it produces into a form that can be 
understood by the destination. The source and the destination are 
therefore said to fully, or at least partially, share (d) a code, which 
may be defined as that set of transformation rules whereby messages can be 
converted from one representation to another.' As long as one sticks to 
transformation rules, code is always procedural. Sebeok states that 'The 
string generated by an application of a set of such rules is (e) a 
message, which may thus be considered an ordered selection from a 
conventional set of signs.' I think that 'ordered' is problematic as well, 
since there is clearly a qualitative difference between book-ordering as 
described above, and a set of rules based on mathesis. Where does the 
arbitrary come in? One might say - and this is an important principle - 
that the content of a code itself is directly correlated to its 
arbitrariness. In this sense, the measure of a code is related to the 
entropy of information within the process of encoding. The greater the 
degree of the arbitrary, the more difficult to break, the greater the 
entropy and therefore the greater the degree of information within it. 
This is not on the level of the double-level of the code, i.e. the content 
it operates upon, if there is such content (as in the Perl example above), 
but within encoding itself. Every encoding is an encoding of encoding; if 
the encoding is fully realized by the product of the code, then its 
semantic content / information is low. If Morse encodes a message, more 
than likely the message may be decoded based only on the distribution of 
letters. The Morse content is low. If a book is used, the decoding is 
increasingly difficult and the content of the code is high. This is also 
related to issues of redundancy vis-a-vis Shannon and Weaver. Note that a 
message and its destination are irrevocably ruptured; there is no 
guarantee that an equivalence is attained on any level. Code operates more 
often than not on an ontological plane disassociated, or associated by 
intention only, with both its source and its decoding; there is no 
guarantee that the source and the message-at-its-destination have anything 
in common. There is no guarantee of the coherency of the practice of 
coding in a particular case, no guarantee of one-to-one or one-to-many or 
many-to-one, no guarantee of a zero-parasite-demographics - no guarantee 
that the channel, in fact, has not been derailed altogether, as often 
happens with bacteriophages. Bateson, in Bateson and Ruesch, Communica- 
tion, The Social Matrix of Psychiatry, states 'codification must, in the 
nature of the case, be systematic. Whatever objects or events or ideas 
internal to the individual represent certain external objects or events, 
there must be a systematic relationship between the internal and the 
external, otherwise the information would not be useful.' Today one can 
say, 'otherwise the information might not be useful,' since it is 
precisely in the breakdown of systematic relationships that innovation 
emerges.' But meaning may be produced even out of tautology. For example, 
propositional logic may be 'derived' from the Sheffer stroke, 'not both A 
and B'; it can also be derived from its dual, 'neither A nor B.' What can 
we say about these? Only that they represent, as processes or _cullings_ 
of particular bounded universes, an unbinding/unbounding - 'neither A nor 
B' points elsewhere altogether, and 'not both A and B' points either 
elsewhere or towards an underpinning of union. At the heart of this 
reduction of propositional logic, is a tendency towards dispersion, 
towards wandering, the nomadic, even though the symbols within the 
calculus proper are completely mute. The Sheffer stroke and its dual, by 
the way, are related as well to the processes of inscription with which 
this essay began - for what is x^-x, than an _inscription_ of an entity, a 
process of coding (and all coding is inscription of one form or another) 
the real for the purposes of comprehension, a process that produces, not 
only meaning, but _all the meaning there is._ There is no outside to the 
sememe, just as there is no landscape without a viewpoint. In this sense 
we are bounded, and bound to be bounded. I want to acknowledge and take 
responsibility for interpretations here which are necessarily shallow and 
possibly misrepresentations as well; this is true in particular of 
Gardenfors' book which is complex, and which I have just begun. I have 
found the concept of conceptual spaces of use here, as a way of thinking 
through code, process, representation, sememe, Eco's planes of expression 
and content, etc.; but I do not yet understand it within Gardenfors' 
theory. I have also completely neglected what I think is most necessary, a 
detailed typology of codes, taking for example temporality into and out of 
account in various ways. I cannot see how one can proceed without a deep 
reading of Eco's 'Theory of Codes' which is the major section of A Theory 
of Semiotics. In the same book, Eco develops a typology of sign production 
which is quite useful. Other references might be Barthes' S/Z (although I 
constantly find his poeticizing beautiful and problematic), and a quite 
useful early book, Symbol Formation, An Organismic-Developmental Approach 
to Language and the Expression of Thought, Werner and Kaplan, Wiley, 1963. 
Finally, it is clear from all of the above that at best one can sketch a 
_discursive field,_ complete with intensifications themselves representing 
concepts; this is similar to a loosely-structured Wittgensteinian family 
of usages. 'Code,' like 'game,' is always a strategy and a wager from a 
theoretical viewpoint, and like much such viewpoints, everything and 
nothing is at stake. One would hope for a future of usefulness, politics, 
and aesthetics to emerge; the danger, in relation to 'codework' itself, is 
that a style develops, and that the uneasy underpinnings - which at least 
for me are the most interesting aspects of it - eventually disappear, 
absorbed back into issues of genre, etc. Code, like the processes of 
postmodernity, is always in a state of renewal, whether or not the 'type' 
or 'concept' remains, and at stake within this renewal is our interpreta- 
tion of the world itself - our actions and our 'reading' of being and 
beings. Wittgenstein's 'silence' at the end of the Tractatus is code's 
success, not failure; it is the always already of the always already, but 
not its foundation.

Code and Codework ii, coding, encoding, confusion

Coding is a process, aptly named; the field is open or let us consider it 
open, a dispersion in which goals are paramount but may not exist as the 
program wends its way into momentary stasis, occasional completion. It is 
the traditional 'death of the author' given open-source; it is never- 
ending; like a markov chain, it is determined in part by what came before, 
it may move elsewhere, cancel, disappear. Input is remote, disparate; is 
the objective, whether of a command, line, subroutine, routine, program, 
module, language. The objective is the focus on whatever is at-hand, and 
whatever is at-hand, the input, is encoded. Encoding is parasitic on both 
code and object - on code, as a process or operation, and on object, as 
transformable entity, within and without which code is entangled, inhered. 
A code constructs code; an encoder is all input; we have spoken elsewhere 
about the relationship of output to input; what is encoder output is 
already lost in transmission, has fled elsewhere. Perhaps _I code,_ and 
perhaps _it encodes,_ thereby lies all the difference, the distinction 
among con/structures, con/structions. In part codework is self-devouring, 
between or among coding and encoding, part operation and part residue; 
part symptom, the expressivity of disease; and part the struggle, what 
appears as struggle, what is not struggle or is inauthentic struggle, of 
the origin, originary content, to retain its sememe, in spite of all 
filtering, or magnified and not diminished by such filtering. These terms 
and my use of them are of course arbitrary; one might use encoding to 
reference the act of program-creation and coding that which operates on 
input, with all the phenomenology of input already indicated. I choose a 
distinction between these words in order to articulate a distinction 
within the field; otherwise we are off again into unnecessary obscurity. 
As for the _element_ of a code, there is a sign or sign-function, there is 
a process drawn from tables or closed lexicons. As for the _element_ of 
encoding, there is none; an input may, in relation to the encoding 
program, be fit (in the sense of harmonization) or not; in a sense it does 
not matter, as encoding is matterless, codeless, just as coding is 
mattered, albeit the ideality or cyberneticization of matter. Again it is 
a difference which makes all the difference, as in Spencer Brown. One 
might also say that coding is the creation of a detemporalized structure 
by means of temporal operations (on the part of humans or otherwise), and 
that encoding is the detemporalized operation (detemporalized by virtue of 
the black-box) on input, creating a temporal difference between input and 
output, t1 and t2, different in every (parametric) way. But this is 
somewhat sophistry; certainly a program is a detemporalized structure. But 
wait, for the input and output are there to-be-used; they exist most 
likely within the matrix of the human; they are _employed._ The employment 
of a program - and a program may devour itself or other programs - is also 
temporalized, but the program itself, unused, a series of commands and 
other materials, is only a static articulation. Nevertheless, the static 
articulation may be always in the process of constant self- or other- 
revision, and time moves on. Let us say then that coding is the operation 
on code and the production of an articulation, and that encoding is the 
operation on input, within which code is irrelevant - even if code is 
foregrounded, even if code crashes, the input is destroyed, garbage in / 
garbage out on any level. The difference is subtle, but perhaps there. One 
might like encoding then to Husserlian internal time-consciousness, and 
coding to formal and linear (parallel or non, clocked or variable, etc.) 
time. Or the other way around. Or the meeting of the two, as code may be 
input, code may be encoded, code may code. Still, we might say this, that 
encoding is the _disappearance of the code,_ and coding, its _promulga- 
tion._ Entanglement occurs at all levels of operation. DNA encodes, but 
encodes what? Itself, input/output material blind to DNA/RNA? DNA codes or 
encodes DNA as well. Tacit knowledge (Polyani) resolves nothing, but plays 
a role: use a screwdriver long enough, and it disappears from the hand - 
all that remains is the interaction with the screw. Too much is made of 
code, coding, encoding, decoding; not enough is made of the disappearance 
of code - not as universal subtext of capital, but as a necessary corre- 
late to our functioning in the world.

this began as the fetish.jpg remember it was taken from a digital image 
made in the miami apartment shooting up from the ground with a flash
azure and i wearing robes this one is me and the robe was parted by 
the erection like the tent of abraham was it
that image elsewhere then taken through a floyd-steinberg filter 
that changes it into something like photogravure which was then sent
through photoshop
remember at first everything became messier or relatively confused
but then you applied the neon filter which lit up the edges and after
a while the result then was faded
remember you tried different kinds of fading and this one worked
turning it back into an odd three-dimensionality all the the while
you're feeling ill and feverish with a bad allergic attack and more
think it might be the flu in any case you worked through the difference
fade and then intensified the saturation and upped the curves a bit
resulting in this dream of broken lust something like jelinek 
might have written in a still image from one of her bleaker novels

On Code and Codework


Consider a well-defined entity x, and its complement -x. Then x^-x = N, 
the null set. Consider a second entity y and -y, y^-y = N. Think Nx and 
Ny, the null set relativized to x and y. Consider three separable entities 
x, y, z, and take pairs xy, yz, zx. These are symmetrical yx, zy, xz. Let 
ab stand for a^b. Then xy, yz, zx are equivalent to null. Let x, y, z 
divide a planar region into three regions bordering on each other. Let x@y 
represent a line equidistant from the entities x and y. Then x@y, y@z, z@x 
all meet at a single point. Divide the plain so that all entities are 
grouped in triads; each triad meets in a single point. Divide the plain so 
that these single points are grouped in triads and so forth. What branches 
are available? Is a single point reached? To operate with x and -x such 
that x^-x = N is to operate with discrete entities common to distributive 
aristotelian logic. Now consider a second set, X, Y, etc., mapped onto the 
first; the mapping may be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one. If the 
first, the resulting mapping is reversible. If the second, it is 
reversible but the coding itself is not reversible. If the third, the 
mapping is not reversible; the result is a set of possibilities, not a 
single one. Codes are mappings. There are two types of codes, declarative 
and performative. An example of the former is Morse; it is one-to-one, but 
all that is produced is equivalence. An example of the second is Perl; 
Perl codes procedure. If procedure is coded, then the contents of the 
procedure are doubly coded. If a Perl program parses {A} to produce {B}. 
then the primary coding is the program which constructs and orders 
procedures. The secondary coding is {A} -> {B} which may be considered the 
semantic plane of the code. In Eco's A Theory of Semiotics, only a rule 
'may properly be called a '_code._' and a rule couples items from one 
system with some from another. Eco extends the possibility of code to 'a 
set of possible _behavioral responses_ on the part of the destination. 
This is performativity. In codework, primary and secondary coding are 
entangled. Entanglement may be considered noise in the system. With noise, 
the null set N is blurred across fuzzy sets with parasitic inputs; x^-x 
and x^y may be and usually are ill-defined. It is this ill-definition - 
which functions for example in current definitions of words like 'freedom' 
- that tends towards political economy. Political, because culture and the 
social are at stake in relation to the definition which is always already 
under contestation, and economy, because there are limited resources and 
examples for any particular definition. With codework, meaning itself is 
problematized as a result of entanglement. In Eco, it is the code which 
reaches a destination, not the message. The decoding of the message may or 
may not be equivalent to the source. Noise is always already present and 
is considered within the channel. This is the T-model of the parasite 
described by Serres. Eco states "When a code apportions the elements of a 
conveying system to the elements of a conveyed system, the former becomes 
the expression of the latter, and the latter becomes the content of the 
former. A sign-function arises when an expression is correlated to a 
content, both the correlated elements being the functives of such a 
correlation.' Code is a collocation or system (not necessarily the same) 
of processes; processes are performative; both are temporally-embedded. A 
mapping f(x) = y is not temporally-embedded; thus the mapping of the even 
numbers onto the number system may be considered an ideality which _is,_ 
regardless of temporal processes. The structure is given all-at-once 
within the formula (and its proof); its proof is a carrying-out of the 
truth-value, or a revealing of the truth-value, of the structure. There 
are mappings which are systemic, i.e. structure-dependent, and there are 
mappings which are non-systemic or purely heuristic, such as randomly 
assigning letters in a message to a triple number (page/line/letter- 
position) originating from a particular edition of a particular book. In 
all of these instances, of course, terms like 'system' and 'assign' are 
themselves fuzzy; nevertheless there's a tremendous difference between the 
anecdotal and the structural, and there are practical differences in the 
ensuing codes and their employment. Peter Gardenfors, in Conceptual Space, 
The Geometry of Thought, considers 'conceptual spaces' which are related 
to tessellation of the plane. This reminds one of Peirce's simplest mathe- 
matics, which is also related to Venn diagrams; in all of these, sets of 
entities and concepts in the life-world are mapped into other spaces which 
may or may not reflect thinking processes. Geometry is always bound by its 
spatial representations; there is no reason to think, at all, that the 
mind necessarily works through spatial or any representation for that 
matter. Representation is always coded; Sebeok, in Approaches to Animal 
Communication, 'Semiotics and Ethology,' points out that the 'model 
suggested here entails a communication unit in which a relatively small 
amount of energy or matter in an animal (a) the source, brings about a 
relatively large redistribution of energy or matter in another animal (or 
in another part of the same animal), (b) the destination, and postulates 
(c) a channel through which the participants are capable of establishing 
and sustaining contact. Maturana somewhere talks about such communication 
as the mutual orienting of cognitive domains. Sebeok states that 'Every 
source requires a transmitter which serves to reorganize, by a process 
called encoding, the messages it produces into a form that can be 
understood by the destination. The source and the destination are 
therefore said to fully, or at least partially, share (d) a code, which 
may be defined as that set of transformation rules whereby messages can be 
converted from one representation to another.' As long as one sticks to 
transformation rules, code is always procedural. Sebeok states that 'The 
string generated by an application of a set of such rules is (e) a 
message, which may thus be considered an ordered selection from a 
conventional set of signs.' I think that 'ordered' is problematic as well, 
since there is clearly a qualitative difference between book-ordering as 
described above, and a set of rules based on mathesis. Where does the 
arbitrary come in? One might say - and this is an important principle - 
that the content of a code itself is directly correlated to its 
arbitrariness. In this sense, the measure of a code is related to the 
entropy of information within the process of encoding. The greater the 
degree of the arbitrary, the more difficult to break, the greater the 
entropy and therefore the greater the degree of information within it. 
This is not on the level of the double-level of the code, i.e. the content 
it operates upon, if there is such content (as in the Perl example above), 
but within encoding itself. Every encoding is an encoding of encoding; if 
the encoding is fully realized by the product of the code, then its 
semantic content / information is low. If Morse encodes a message, more 
than likely the message may be decoded based only on the distribution of 
letters. The Morse content is low. If a book is used, the decoding is 
increasingly difficult and the content of the code is high. This is also 
related to issues of redundancy vis-a-vis Shannon and Weaver. Note that a 
message and its destination are irrevocably ruptured; there is no 
guarantee that an equivalence is attained on any level. Code operates more 
often than not on an ontological plane disassociated, or associated by 
intention only, with both its source and its decoding; there is no 
guarantee that the source and the message-at-its-destination have anything 
in common. There is no guarantee of the coherency of the practice of 
coding in a particular case, no guarantee of one-to-one or one-to-many or 
many-to-one, no guarantee of a zero-parasite-demographics - no guarantee 
that the channel, in fact, has not been derailed altogether, as often 
happens with bacteriophages. Bateson, in Bateson and Ruesch, Communica- 
tion, The Social Matrix of Psychiatry, states 'codification must, in the 
nature of the case, be systematic. Whatever objects or events or ideas 
internal to the individual represent certain external objects or events, 
there must be a systematic relationship between the internal and the 
external, otherwise the information would not be useful.' Today one can 
say, 'otherwise the information might not be useful,' since it is 
precisely in the breakdown of systematic relationships that innovation 
emerges.' But meaning may be produced even out of tautology. For example, 
propositional logic may be 'derived' from the Sheffer stroke, 'not both A 
and B'; it can also be derived from its dual, 'neither A nor B.' What can 
we say about these? Only that they represent, as processes or _cullings_ 
of particular bounded universes, an unbinding/unbounding - 'neither A nor 
B' points elsewhere altogether, and 'not both A and B' points either 
elsewhere or towards an underpinning of union. At the heart of this 
reduction of propositional logic, is a tendency towards dispersion, 
towards wandering, the nomadic, even though the symbols within the 
calculus proper are completely mute. The Sheffer stroke and its dual, by 
the way, are related as well to the processes of inscription with which 
this essay began - for what is x^-x, than an _inscription_ of an entity, a 
process of coding (and all coding is inscription of one form or another) 
the real for the purposes of comprehension, a process that produces, not 
only meaning, but _all the meaning there is._ There is no outside to the 
sememe, just as there is no landscape without a viewpoint. In this sense 
we are bounded, and bound to be bounded. I want to acknowledge and take 
responsibility for interpretations here which are necessarily shallow and 
possibly misrepresentations as well; this is true in particular of 
Gardenfors' book which is complex, and which I have just begun. I have 
found the concept of conceptual spaces of use here, as a way of thinking 
through code, process, representation, sememe, Eco's planes of expression 
and content, etc.; but I do not yet understand it within Gardenfors' 
theory. I have also completely neglected what I think is most necessary, a 
detailed typology of codes, taking for example temporality into and out of 
account in various ways. I cannot see how one can proceed without a deep 
reading of Eco's 'Theory of Codes' which is the major section of A Theory 
of Semiotics. In the same book, Eco develops a typology of sign production 
which is quite useful. Other references might be Barthes' S/Z (although I 
constantly find his poeticizing beautiful and problematic), and a quite 
useful early book, Symbol Formation, An Organismic-Developmental Approach 
to Language and the Expression of Thought, Werner and Kaplan, Wiley, 1963. 
Finally, it is clear from all of the above that at best one can sketch a 
_discursive field,_ complete with intensifications themselves representing 
concepts; this is similar to a loosely-structured Wittgensteinian family 
of usages. 'Code,' like 'game,' is always a strategy and a wager from a 
theoretical viewpoint, and like much such viewpoints, everything and 
nothing is at stake. One would hope for a future of usefulness, politics, 
and aesthetics to emerge; the danger, in relation to 'codework' itself, is 
that a style develops, and that the uneasy underpinnings - which at least 
for me are the most interesting aspects of it - eventually disappear, 
absorbed back into issues of genre, etc. Code, like the processes of 
postmodernity, is always in a state of renewal, whether or not the 'type' 
or 'concept' remains, and at stake within this renewal is our interpreta- 
tion of the world itself - our actions and our 'reading' of being and 
beings. Wittgenstein's 'silence' at the end of the Tractatus is code's 
success, not failure; it is the always already of the always already, but 
not its foundation.

Code and Codework ii, coding, encoding, confusion

Coding is a process, aptly named; the field is open or let us consider it 
open, a dispersion in which goals are paramount but may not exist as the 
program wends its way into momentary stasis, occasional completion. It is 
the traditional 'death of the author' given open-source; it is never- 
ending; like a markov chain, it is determined in part by what came before, 
it may move elsewhere, cancel, disappear. Input is remote, disparate; is 
the objective, whether of a command, line, subroutine, routine, program, 
module, language. The objective is the focus on whatever is at-hand, and 
whatever is at-hand, the input, is encoded. Encoding is parasitic on both 
code and object - on code, as a process or operation, and on object, as 
transformable entity, within and without which code is entangled, inhered. 
A code constructs code; an encoder is all input; we have spoken elsewhere 
about the relationship of output to input; what is encoder output is 
already lost in transmission, has fled elsewhere. Perhaps _I code,_ and 
perhaps _it encodes,_ thereby lies all the difference, the distinction 
among con/structures, con/structions. In part codework is self-devouring, 
between or among coding and encoding, part operation and part residue; 
part symptom, the expressivity of disease; and part the struggle, what 
appears as struggle, what is not struggle or is inauthentic struggle, of 
the origin, originary content, to retain its sememe, in spite of all 
filtering, or magnified and not diminished by such filtering. These terms 
and my use of them are of course arbitrary; one might use encoding to 
reference the act of program-creation and coding that which operates on 
input, with all the phenomenology of input already indicated. I choose a 
distinction between these words in order to articulate a distinction 
within the field; otherwise we are off again into unnecessary obscurity. 
As for the _element_ of a code, there is a sign or sign-function, there is 
a process drawn from tables or closed lexicons. As for the _element_ of 
encoding, there is none; an input may, in relation to the encoding 
program, be fit (in the sense of harmonization) or not; in a sense it does 
not matter, as encoding is matterless, codeless, just as coding is 
mattered, albeit the ideality or cyberneticization of matter. Again it is 
a difference which makes all the difference, as in Spencer Brown. One 
might also say that coding is the creation of a detemporalized structure 
by means of temporal operations (on the part of humans or otherwise), and 
that encoding is the detemporalized operation (detemporalized by virtue of 
the black-box) on input, creating a temporal difference between input and 
output, t1 and t2, different in every (parametric) way. But this is 
somewhat sophistry; certainly a program is a detemporalized structure. But 
wait, for the input and output are there to-be-used; they exist most 
likely within the matrix of the human; they are _employed._ The employment 
of a program - and a program may devour itself or other programs - is also 
temporalized, but the program itself, unused, a series of commands and 
other materials, is only a static articulation. Nevertheless, the static 
articulation may be always in the process of constant self- or other- 
revision, and time moves on. Let us say then that coding is the operation 
on code and the production of an articulation, and that encoding is the 
operation on input, within which code is irrelevant - even if code is 
foregrounded, even if code crashes, the input is destroyed, garbage in / 
garbage out on any level. The difference is subtle, but perhaps there. One 
might like encoding then to Husserlian internal time-consciousness, and 
coding to formal and linear (parallel or non, clocked or variable, etc.) 
time. Or the other way around. Or the meeting of the two, as code may be 
input, code may be encoded, code may code. Still, we might say this, that 
encoding is the _disappearance of the code,_ and coding, its _promulga- 
tion._ Entanglement occurs at all levels of operation. DNA encodes, but 
encodes what? Itself, input/output material blind to DNA/RNA? DNA codes or 
encodes DNA as well. Tacit knowledge (Polyani) resolves nothing, but plays 
a role: use a screwdriver long enough, and it disappears from the hand - 
all that remains is the interaction with the screw. Too much is made of 
code, coding, encoding, decoding; not enough is made of the disappearance 
of code - not as universal subtext of capital, but as a necessary corre- 
late to our functioning in the world.

Aphoristic Essay on Analog and Digital Orders


The digital: by 'digital' I mean 'discrete.' By 'digital' I mean 
'systemic,' characterized by systematization, parameterization.

The analog appears continuous; the digital appears discrete, broken.

In everyday life, the digital is the result of an intervention.

An intervention is a mapping. Every mapping, unless a mapping of itself 
('ikonic'), leaves something out.

The intervention requires the setting of a standard raster. A raster is a 
filtering of a quantity, almost always with discrete steps. Think of a 
raster as a 'screening,' creating elements out of a continuous bandwidth, 
then quantifying those elements.

The elements are ordered. The raster sorts the continuous fabric of the 
real into separable categories.

The raster is standardized so that information may be transmitted and 
received through coherent channels, by means of a coherent transmitter and 
receiver.

The standardization of the raster is a _protocol._ The protocol must be 
agreed upon by both sender and receiver.

In everyday life, the establishment of a raster and protocol requires 
energy and communication. Raster and protocol must be communicated.

After raster and protocol are established, the parceled semantic content, 
coded by raster, may be communicated.

Coding and community establishes raster and protocol. Encoding codes an 
object from analog to digital.

From the viewpoint of the digital, the analog is forgotten; the process is 
irreversible.

A digital parcelling is accurate only to the limits of a particular and 
conventionally-established tolerance. The tolerance, more often than not, 
is tied to economy. In general, the greater the capital available, the 
lesser the tolerance.

The analog possesses no tolerance. The analog is _there._

The digital is never _there._ The digital is always process, in-process.

If the digital is indexical, 'pointing towards' a mapping of the contin- 
uum, the analog _is_ that scale. The analog is ikonic, the digital is 
indexical.

The distinction between the digital and its referents or domains is onto- 
logical; the distinction between analog and its domain is epistemological.

At zero tolerance -'no room for error' - and an infinitely-fine raster, 
the digital is equivalent to the analog. The map, in other words, is 
exactly equivalent to the thing itself. 

The thing itself is equivalent to the thing itself; this is identity.

At infinite tolerance - infinite error permitted - and infinitely-coarse 
raster, the digital is equivalent to a kind of _mark._

A mark totalizes 'its' demarcated.

A mark is an _instance._

There are numerous 'real worlds' of nearly-decomposable systems. (Herbert 
Simon) The world of everyday life appears continuous; it is only in 
dreams, for example, one encounters jump-cuts - sudden shifts of place and 
time. This continuous world appears analogic.

The world of symbols and signs - the world of languaging and inscription - 
appears discontinuous, syntactic, and digital, characterized by discrete 
moments and entities.

The filmworld (Christian Metz) appears an entanglement of languaging and 
continuities. Because film is an operable subject (i.e. a subject whose 
discursive field is somewhat definable), the entanglement tends towards 
polarities, interpretations, interpenetrations, etc. Frames are digital; 
the diegesis is analog (continuous story), and digital (semiotics of 
narrative); the psychoanalytics are digital (continuous processing of the 
subject-viewer).

Neurophysiology implies, not only entanglements of digital (neural 
firings) and analog (potentials), but the problematizing of the analog/ 
digital split on ontological/epistemic grounds. The domains are both 
inseparable and problematized; the distinction is useless.

The same is true on the level of 'fundamental' physics, at least as far as 
current research goes; there are quantum processes that involve discrete 
levels, and there are continuums; there is the breakdown of space-time at 
small distances/times, and so forth. If the world is information 'all the 
way down,' the coding at this level is again neither analog nor digital.

In other words, mental and fundamental physical events and processes 
abjure any clear distinction between analog and digital, to the extent 
that the phenomenology of both is inappropriate. If there is a 'book of 
nature,' there is as of yet specific syntactics.

One is always searching for the syntactics, however; it is by means of 
coding and encoding that the universe is grasped.

The analog slips through the fingers. The world slips through the fingers.

Any element of a raster is independent of any other element. Any element 
may be transformed without transforming any other element. Truth values 
within the digital are problematic. The digital is cleanly separable, 
breakable. The digital is clean.

Any element of the analogic real is interconnected and inseparable. The 
transformation of any element alters any other element. Truth values are 
inherent. The application of truth values is digital. The analogic is a 
membrane. The analogic is dirty, inseparable, unbreakable.

The dirty analogic problematizes its symbolic. The clean digital is 
already symbolic.

The digital _object_ is analogic. 

The analogic _representation_ is digital.

Ghosts are embedded within the analogic. Ghosts are excluded from the 
digital. 

Absence or exclusion from the digital is equivalent to non-existence from 
the viewpoint of the digital. Ghosts are existence and existents within 
the analogic.

The digital envelops the act of differentiation; the analog envelops 
integration. The analog smoothes what the digital disrupts.

The digital requires a place to stand. The digital requires an origin. The 
analog of Cartesian coordinates is countermanded by the discrete and 
arbitrary location of the origin.

The digital draws a distinction; the analog erases it.

To draw a distinction is the construct a potential well, within which the 
distinction functions, in spite of the corrosion of the world.

To erase a distinction is to corrode it, to sublimate it to the analogic 
real, the plasmatic world.

The plasmatic world is the heated world in which distinctions last less 
time than the processes required to convey information. The plasmatic 
world, a theoretical construct, is necessarily inoperable. The world of 
the landscape - without a _preferred viewpoint_ - is such a world. 

The cold-world is the world of the permanence and transformations of 
distinctions. The cold-world is a world of potential wells, in which signs 
convey, remain - in which structures remain intact, in which semantic 
content flows through structures.

The digital quantifies the analog.

The digital carries a price-tag.

Coding, by its very nature, is digital, that is to say, discrete.

Never, 'above,' as 'below,' but 'as above,' apparent 'as below.' Metaphor 
and metonymy are always already tropes, within the digital.

The signifier does not _reference_ the signified; it _creates_ it from the 
analogic. The creation of a signifier re-inscribes the signified 
elsewhere; as in Saussure's example, the signifier never operates 'within' 
the real, but within a _chain of signifiers,_ a hermeneutics on the plane 
of the Other, which inauthentically appears to create the 'Originary' 
plane, i.e. Creation.

To create by speech ('and the Lord said') is always already to embody the 
creation as _inscription._ Inscription separates the inscribed and thereby 
created entity from its complement, the inscribed world external to the 
inscribed and created entity.

The totality of inscriptions necessarily forms a _coherent and closed 
system,_ since the system is, after all, created by humans or other 
organisms, and their cultures.

Somewhere von Foerster characterizes organism by _negation._ Negation is 
the first speech act. Negation is the primary speech act, 'not this, not 
that' - 'avoid that - that is dangerous' - 'do not go there.' 

To negate is to inscribe. To negate is to create. The creation of an 
entity is always a carving-away. The creation of an entity implies a 
reduction relative to that entity.

The digital is the carving-away of what is deemed extraneous. The digital 
saws into the extraneous, which is its residue.

The residue is the residue of the analog; the residue is parasitic, noise.

The digital is noiseless, absolute silence.

The analog is absolute noise.

The circle of signifiers washes against mental impressions. The image of 
something is always already a construct (Sartre), rule-bound, but the 
image of the image is analogic.

If something is an analog of something else, both suffer from similar 
noise. Both suffer from similarity.

If something is a representation of something else, both draw structures 
from each other.

The analog is unstructured; the digital is structured.

The analog is communality, use-value. The digital is community, exchange- 
value. Exchange may be direct or indirect, transitive. Exchange may be 
based on apparent equivalence, on agreement, on contract. Exchange binds 
entity to entity. Exchange defines entity. Exchange defines entity in 
relation to (by virtue of) entity.

Analogic use-value is imminent and immanent. Digital exchange-value is 
distanced, defined. Analog is subject; digital is object. The object of 
digital is subject to analog. Exchange replaces use. The subject of analog 
is object to digital. Exchange replaces use.

Digital is always already a presumed contamination of the real. The 
presumption is always already false.

The analog is always already a presumed healing or suturing of the real. 
The presumption is always already false.

Without the digital, communication would be impossible. The ideality of 
the feral world is equivalent to the world under erasure.

To throw away the scaffold is to retain it. To retain everything, releases 
everything.

"Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darueber muss man schweigen." (Wittgen- 
stein) - is already lost.
