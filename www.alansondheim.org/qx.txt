Has anyone had experience writing this (or a related) machine to a PC

notes from the accompanying talk

My avatar behavior is governed by animation files originating with mocap 
equipment. Almost all professional current mocap uses nodes - information 
coming in from specific body areas, assigned body areas, and so forth. I 
remap the mocap body, by distributing nodes among several human bodies; by 
collapsing nodes, by node reassignment on a geometric or random basis, by 
'heaping' nodes and so forth.

I see 'the body' as:

a. An already inscribed, already virtual body.

b. A distributed or social body: Who speaks 'within' 'us' and who answers 
for us, etc. My avatars are social, their movements produced by groups 
instead of individuals: up to four performers for one animation file, one 
animation file expanded into multiple conforming avatars.

c. A dying body: Our bodies are always on the way out and our work, if it 
doesn't revolve around love, sexual arousal, and hatred, is bounded by, 
revolves within, the horizon of death and despair.

d. An absent body (Drew Leder); we rarely track everything. It is the 
privilege of the camera in Second Life to reveal the avatar as simultan- 
eous object and subject, confined and open, teetering.

e. A present body and an abject body - in and out of virtual worlds.

(political bodies, in the face of mass extinctions, social degradation)

I'm interested in errors, leaks, and resistance, and in the recuperation/ 
re-presentation of flesh. My work always begins and ends with the flesh, 
with the flesh-mind, with embodied mind. (Among other tools, exploring the 
limits of mocap.)

NEW WORK 3RD DAY:

(from avatar.txt)

And so one's body is an immanent form of exchange; for both avatar and
modeler - or procurer - it is a rite of passage. Were it not for the
inertia of sexuality, the weight of the caress of light, hir body would
become invisible, totalized: nothing and everything simultaneously. Its
visibility for you would be its invisibility for hirself, of course, of
course... [   ]

When I model hir, I desire hir, desire the avatar and hir inconceivable
performance, desire this which targets my body, re-possesses it; if s/he
is clothed, hir body fulfills the function of clothing; if s/he is naked,
everything is gone, devoured, _spent._  [   ]

Thus engineering and avatar mediate between the real (evidence in the
"scientific" sense) and the imaginary (the eccentric space of the erotic):
an entity embedded into substance, or an entity promising substance and
embedding - an entity existing only in the virtual, as hard as any other
tissue.

What I am is what I have; what I have is what s/he is; what s/he is, is
what I am; what I am belongs to hir (plateau of skin, flesh of screen of
flesh). What is ceased (embedded) remains in shadow; what is evident
in the light is evidence and light is everywhere. Light embeds and re-
produces; light presences, rewrytes hir again and again. [   ]

I am restrained. In this fashion I hardly know hir, 1 on 1 side of the
screen, 2 on the other. The light becomes a familiar caress (it is not
daylight; it is litigation, the negotiation of the Law in this software,
in this viewer, this hardware wetware); I confess everything. What you
want is what you get. What I engineer is the inverted double, and I
perform for hir. Like a service, I perform for hir, perform for myself,
perform hir. I cannot (to be frank) look in a mirror; I avoid hir eyes. I
perform for dead files which bring hir flesh to life; s/he brings me to
life, the restoration which is the presence of flesh. The memory of flesh.
The memory of non-existent flesh. Flesh is its disembodiment. S/he is the
story which surrounds me. S/he are the beginning of narrative.

What s/he pulls out of me is an object. An avatar. That avatar is an
image, is substance. That avatar cures; s/he is shamanic, mediating the
real against itself. There is nothing spiritual here, in this shamanism;
there is only the presence of desire, arousal, speech, narrative, pathos,
vehemence, intention, the circulating of the real, the collapse of
fantasm, theory, language, against the reality of the flesh and its
excitation. Which becomes a totality, transforms avatar, hir body into
liquidity, the return of the caress. [   ]

Carnival, plateau, perforations of the body. Everywhere illuminations. I
desire hir, desire the endless peregrinations of hir engineering, hir
engine, I desire hir presence within me.

(from a question by Lawrence Upton on wryting-l)

I think of inscription itself as virtual; the body is interpenetrated by 
(and penetrates) systems of signs and symbols not always coherent. A sign 
is virtual to the extent that it represents, even if it's ikonic, repre- 
senting itself. It (the sign) participates in abstraction, taking the body 
with it, just as the body physicalizes the sign. I think of tattoos for 
example as such representations - they're deliberately added. But there 
are things like scars, pockmarks, shaving patterns (or not), bruises, 
makeup, etc., all of which entertain the body within readings, within 
virtual worlds - for example scars referencing a history which is partly 
readable, partly deducible, partly absent. On the other hand, the body is 
fundamentally flesh and tissue, _there,_ and the body in pain or severe 
sickness or near death is 'beyond' representation; I think Elaine Scarry 
touched on these points - just as hysterical laughter or crying becomes a 
'beyond' of the events that may have produced it. Virtuality isn't on a 
rocker switch; it's present like a Noh ghost or haunting, and it's part of 
the uncanny of the body. Watching the motion capture figures is a watching 
of inhabitations which are also lost or gone, or evanescent - there is the 
implication of multitudes in each of the bodies / avatars, yet only one 
connected form is actually visible. The body isn't a product, but it's not 
just a background either. I think one designs the body to a great degree - 
costuming, makeup, general appearance, but this is outward; a scar on the 
other hand most often is a mute testimony of something, perhaps serious 
and painful, that has gone (on) before. I think on the other hand, the 
general tendency is to make a separate between 'real' and 'virtual' bodies 
or avatars, and to talk about the designing of the latter. But the latter 
- even the Second Life virtual world avatars - also participate in the 
abject, in 'leakages,' that reference the arousals, histories, love, and 
hatreds of the 'real' fleshly body; avatars appear self-contained, but but 
they're hardly that (I think this kind of tethering between a body and 
'hir' avatar in fact is uncanny, irreducible, a form of impulse or 
intentionality - something a while ago I called 'jectivity' to cover both 
introjection and projection.)

So I think these mocap avatars or figures are 'about' all of this, all 
this intermixing of ontologies, bodies, representations, etc. - they're 
also carrying a kind of 'social' into the body. It was interesting working 
with the dancers and watching them operate together or independently, but 
within the aegis of the group, almost like a musical quartet; to produce a 
_particular_ movement in the avatar image, the dancers had to move, for 
example, in particular ways. On the other hand, when the dancers 
improvised independently or without regard of the (singular image), new 
and innovative movements appeared in the avatar as it responded, in dialog 
with the hardware and software, to often contradictory requests in the 
placement of limbs and movements. It reminds me of the old "Three Faces 
of Eve" concept of schizophrenia - or the multiple intelligences theory of 
the mind - and what ultimately appears in spite of Minsky, Lacan, and a 
number of more recent thinkers, is still a form of unity - one avatar 
twisting, one being, ultimately the fiction of one sign, the collectivity 
of what we still think of as the individual or "I".

Dusk Dance Culmination *

these are all generated from the same mocap session - i forget the
particular scheme. the bvh file is available, as is the soundtrack.
there are two videos - one from poser and one from second life, in a
full environment. i feel my life is entering dusk, the dance faltering,
the world uncomfortably warm, dark, dangerous. stress pushes me to do
these things, but beauty holds me as an afterthought. among the
virtual worlds in multiverses, my creatures live without me.

second life with solo oud score)

life of duskdance with julu twine avatar at columbia i am sim)

http://www.alansondheim.org/duskdance.bvh (you can use this in virtual
worlds as an animation, created at columbia iam mocap studio with several
dancers inhabiting a single avatar through distributed and affine
remapping)

* these four files together constitute a single moment; please watch
these, whether you've seen the others. these are a culmination of the
mocap work, maybe opening new territories in animation and distributed
performance. anyway they're fun to watch.


from the multiverse

think of these as creatures somewhere in the multiverse, externally-
driven in the local, internally-driven elsewhere. think of these as 
externalized harbingers of consciousness, projected from a social  
phenomenology into phantom-concrete rubble of thought itself.

Nothing but Ground

in this manner, ideological rhetoric is swallowed by mechanical surface:

It's not there there's nothing but _surface._
It's that there's nothing but _ground._

Two REQUESTS:

1. Please download EVERYTHING from 
http://www.alansondheim.org/ and
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/
Who knows how long these sites will be up? A dying star, war-time 
em-burst, nuclear terrorism, very little: and THE WORK disappears.
Such work as remains virtual debris or residue: it has NO OTHER
existence than what you can give it, yourself, among your storage
machines, your data-bases, your memories CONCRETE.

2. Please enact EVERYTHING visible or audible, everything legible,
within the hardness of MARBLE or GRANITE, guarantee them at the 
least, a modicum of existence beyond my lifespan (as my health
again turns HARSH). It is my DREAM to have this work, these 
avatars, TRANSFORMED into CONCRETE EXISTENCE, forms of STATUARY,
proclaiming, that these were POTENTIALS at a certain stage of our
existence, these were THINGS in the worlds of imaginations. 

DOWNLOAD and SAVE, DOWNLOAD and HARDEN, RE-PRODUCE: so much to
ask, so great and small the results.

There are 500 million worlds in our galaxy, a great number of which might 
support life. Or 500 billion - this changes daily - as such, at least 
seventy planets for each of us on earth: inconceivable. Life-forms seem to 
have been found within a meteorite, some local and identifiable, and 
others alien to the core. Multiverses range from 10^500 to an infinite 
number of universes, depending on the theory; in some of these, we're 
reproduced more or less exactly - in others, there's no relationship - in 
almost all, no ingress or egress; we're alone but fantastically duplica- 
ted. Ontology disappears, as does epistemology; knowledge and its constit- 
uents devolve in entirely unforeseen ways. Singularities are more of our 
myths; what is happening is slow erosion, as if eternity is just around 
the corner - but corners themselves are duplicated, and there is no more 
of the same, just as sameness itself appears as 10^500, an impossible 
degree. The point of all of this - the x-dimensional space-time of all of 
this - is only that knowledge has collapsed in its own deconstruction; 
given the problematic of proof, at least in this era, there's no reassem- 
blage on the other side of the brane or horizon. It's hard to configure 
art or ideology - any set or fieldings of human cultural values, given 
this landscape; new discoveries from one day to another bypass momentary 
blockages which are temporarily assembled as theory beyond heuristics - 
Badiou's mathematics comes to mind, Lacan, continental thought, philosophy 
itself, just about any scoring or underscoring one might make of a day or 
night when knowledge seems certain, always on the verge of trembling or 
text. I try to situate my work in relation to all of these, discarding 
myth, religion, even geometries and the truth of the image - any image - 
any imaginary - along the way. Buddhism stumbles on reincarnation for me, 
and the paradoxes of the void dissipate in the sizzle of virtual produc- 
tion. One writes always already suspended, from what and from where, or 
what form of connectivities - these are not only the wrong questions to 
ask, they're questions that are deeply meaningless, as is the preposi- 
tional aegis constructed in and out of localized geometries: above, below, 
within, without, before, after, and so forth. The suspension is from 
nothing. There is a degree of production one attempts to do, with all this 
knowledge, anti-knowledge. Even here, I am ignoring mass extinctions, the 
damage humans have done to the planet, local political corruptions, the 
nadir of what appears, from our positions on the bent plane, as universal 
slaughter. Everything can disappear in an instant: 9/11, Katrina, 
Christchurch, Tibet, are names hinting at a damaged symbolic. It's this: 
as time goes on, (phenomenologically) speeds up, nothing is recoverable; 
we're already gone before we've arrived: we're ghosts occasioned by our 
own exponentially-increasing knowledge which is already out of date. We 
can't catch up with ourselves, as ghosts; phantasms fly faster than flesh, 
which drags us down to death, to a stop of all of this. But until then, 
what? That these universes carry us elsewhere, that we become invaders of 
our very selves, marauders of what we've taken for granted? I try to work 
through this storm, this permanent monsoon encompassing all realities, all 
virtualities, no matter how invisible. And we're all, all of us and our 
selves, in the same positionless.

Paradise

http://www.alansondheim.org/paradise.mp4

Paradise is always inner-lit, and avatars are ghosts,
physics holds its breath, our breath is held by physics,
we hold physics accountable, the world is unaccountable,
avatars hold our breath, we breath physics into avatars,
our avatars are inner-lit, our breath is motivated,
our avatars breathe life in us, our lives are avatars,
avatars are unaccountable, they hold our paradise,
our paradise is avatars, our avatars are physical,
our physics is abject and avatars, and holds our breath,
our breath is abject and inner-lit, we breathe our ghosts,
ghosts are our paradise, they hold our breath,
'fleeing physics and ghosts, our breathing harbors death;
'fleeing avatars and paradise, red dust is unaccountable;
'fleeing breath and motivation, our death is absolute.'

a strangely meditative instrument, similar to shamisen, usually 
played with a plectrum or right-hand index finger; what i've heard
is uncanny, slow, beautiful. mine is antique with real snakeskin
that needed repair (i wouldn't buy a new one with snakeskin; the 
animals are endangered). tuned Gcg, fretless, with a shorter neck
than shamisen, coupled with a larger body and delicate bamboo

@ Fukushima

The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon their mistress had expired before;
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need
Of aid from them--she was the universe.

 s/he comes out poised, maximum / minimum burrows in your dreams

http://www.alansondheim.org/broke.mov maquette for augmented reality
 s/he shudder again orgone 

i am sick and tender. i am sick of being sick. i am sick of sweetness. of 
hallucinatory fevers that aren't there. of burning behind my eyes. that 
burn through virtual lands i cannot go thru & into. sick of borders. 
anonymous masked guards that smell of slaughter. so yes it's true i make 
this beauty. i mask this beauty. i hold my breath in the stench of 
slaughter and make this tenderness. i design this sweetness in the horrors 
of quakes and killing fields. i design hallucination in the midst of 
plague. in the midst of sickness i design sickness. in virtual lands i 
design the real. i design the real with the hardness and sickness of the 
real. orgone i shudder again and design this tiredness. i design this 
tiredness and sick.
