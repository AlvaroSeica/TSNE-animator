
(the closing of the work)


    the phenomenology of approach


    = approaching the everglades, the city, illness, language, culture =

a text written in spurts, after the outline, chasing down, encapsulating, 
circumventing. what is an approach? how does approach manifest itself to 
the subject? what is the domain of the approach? what is a domain? what is 
subjectivity? what is its presence and loss?

     0  intermittent text
the text of dispersal. sections are written into and out of the outline. 
the text is governed by the outline. subsequent versions increase the 
quantitative content, refine the tolerance of the investigation. the text 
is an accumulation or collocation of interspersions.

     1	domain limited or unlimited
a limited domain is inscribed with or without fuzzy boundaries. domains 
may be limited in sememe, space, and/or time. example: everglades bounded 
by hydrology, ecosystem. for example (below): everglades younger than 
writing, than human inscription. for example (below): the scribble: 
scribbled note, indecipherable handwriting, noise in the machine. the 
state/meant of the domain is always already a delimitation. (limits are 
closed sets in relation to the rest of the world/s, worlding.)

     2	clues and cues from immemorial past
a clue is an interpretable symptom, according to a scheme based on an 
articulated methodology. a cue is the activation of a scheme based on an 
anomaly or repetitive structure within the domain. the domain in turn may 
be defined by clues and cues.

     3	difference between clues and cues
a clue is based on evidence from the past to the present; a cue is based 
on activation within the present.

     4	relevance theory and approach
clues and cues are such by virtue of relevance; theoretical methodology is 
part of a critical sifting apparatus. relevance is already a complex 
construct, ranging from variegated retinal firings to stratifications of 
attention.

     5	top-down classification schema
this follows for example category theory, chaos/fractal theories; one 
always already begins with pre-theoretic presuppositions. the schemes 
obscure as well as clarify; they override heuristics, average anomalies 
and noise. as with approach, they are always a detour in this regard; they 
counteract the information implosion of nominalism.

     6	wonder, innovation, contradictions
beginning with a sense of awe - everything signs everything, everything 
inscribes. innovation in terms of heuristic projections and introjections 
- contradictions in terms of anomalies, revisions, recuperations, returns.
wonder is a washing, determinate sublime, approach across the edge of the 
cliff, reworking binding and boundary.

     7	deep ecologies, interstitial 
the ecologies become perceptually deeper; gaps are filled in; one lives in 
depth in the glades, aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local 
histories, individual plants and animals. think of messy thickets as 
sheaves; partial separations tend towards partial separations. format 
information formats, format information. the habitus tends towards 
experience.

     8	filling in the habitus
from larger to smaller clues and cues - alligators and wading birds to 
landbirds and invertebrates for example. as one moves down in scale, 
identification becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible.

     9	from anomaly to behaviors
and back again; behavior clusters based on attributes. or from story to 
structure, diachrony to synchrony, anecdote to prediction.

    10	sense of occupation and intimacy
inhabitation based on familiarity, familiality. what is occupation without 
possession, the contract. intimacy forestalls occupation, the experiential 
relegating definition. but in another sense, that of familiar territory, 
'my work,' 'my walk,' 'my singing,' 'my song,' my process, my advance, my 
report and distribution.

    11	familiarity, familiality 
in the first, equivalence scripts and schemata, universals, typifications; 
in the second, identity scripts and experientials, individuations. in 
both, the failure of distributive aristotelian logics, in both the 
gestured and extrapolated indefinite bandwidth. (22)

    12	maternality
chora and matrix - the inchoate beneath the surface of the subject, the 
dominion of striations, vocalizations.

    13	deconstruction of the abject
disarticulation of the abject as such and rearticulation in terms of 
microstructure, skein. the muck and clutter in relation to marl/peat moss 
and biome or flora/fauna regimes. muck and clutter as regimes.

    14	phenomenology of naming
following the notion of rigid designators, beginning with classification, 
classification experience, virtual subjectivity and its relation to 
concrete manifestation.

    15	inarticulate inchoate
maternality: see above. the proffering of languaging or template. the 
inert real. the unspeaking, unspeakable, unspoken.

    16	the mess and its overcoming
entanglement as regime intrusions, conflicting biomes, collapse or 
implosion, niche-construction, problems of scale in space and time.
the mess overcoming.

    17	phenomenology of touch
demarcation of environment on the body - thicket tangle, poisonwood, 
against the skin. differentiation of the mass. eidetic reduction to the 
pressure of being.

    18	reinscription of domain
the domain _as_ continually inscribed in negotiation. linguistic contract 
of the subject. increasingly fuzzy boundary issues. refinement of 
differentiations - typology to decreasing tolerances.

    19	immersive and definable structures
definable is fully reversible; immersive is fuzzy, vectored. both are 
capable of meta-level collocations, i.e. a definable of definable, 
immersive of definable, etc.

    20	clue skeins
clues related theoretically, taxonomically, in terms of typifications, 
taxonomies - heuristic skeins, established on the run. partial skeins, 
tagged skeins, default tag skeins.

    21	the instrumental reason of flows and part-objects
fluid mechanics, turbulence, stases within the flow - non-equilibrium 
thermodynamics. the partitioning, parcelling, clutter, of the world. 
part-objects as modules: modules 'on the part of' the subject, and modules 
'defined as such' within the continually reinscribed domain.

    22	gestural logics and superimpositions
such that partial information (as in land's experiments re: color vision) 
extends across a total domain or spectrum.

    23	delaying conclusions and the settling-in of elements
inconclusivity of discourses which are increasingly refined. elements 
noticed and defined 'settle in' - in the sense of familiarity - always 
with default tags - i.e. elimination by counterexample. retention of _weak 
theory_ - searching for coherency without retention of apparently outmoded 
paradigms.

    24	continuous processing and absorption of anomalies
anomalies as generative of domain boundaries, entities, temporary 
inscriptions, potential of part-objects, etc. the anomaly as the mis-fit 
among the accountable and accounted-for. as unaccountable, uncounted, the 
anomaly generates circumscriptions, circumlocutions; these are involved by 
the subject in a consideration and absorption of the _detour._ every 
anomaly potentially turns everything around, and is turned around by 
everything.

    25	modes of approach in space and time
diachronic/synchronic approaches - space-time slices. diffusion of 
occluded layerings (bay bottoms versus onshore mangrove island 
topography). architectonics of the domain.

    26	horizons of 'natural' and 'unnatural' worlds
and horizons of 'subjective' and 'objective' worlds - in relation to 
heuristics and experiential structures (immersivities). definition is both 
tool and violation; mobile fuzzy domain boundaries participate in the 
natural (i.e. given) order as well as ideological political/economic 
conscious and unconscious considerations.

    27	weakening of perceptual structures and responses
approach is always already self-critical, self-critique; the critique 
itself is withdrawn from the self, sublimated into emergent considerations 
of the domain. the phenomenology of approach implies a weakness of 
language, definition, inscription, boundary, instrumental reason; it 
implies releasement, waiting (not waiting-upon) as well.

    28	releasement and listening
to listen without consideration of the source, the speech, one's answer; 
to avoid pausological structures ('yes, but...'); to speak after (what 
appears to be) the case.

    29	buildings, dwellings, and habitations
domains as fuzzy architectures, the build world, to the extent of the 
delimitation. dwelling, as in residing within the domain, within the 
subjective horizon of the experiential mode in relation to the domain. the 
domain as inhabited by the subject, wor(l)ds becoming 'natural' in the 
sense of familiarity, familiality.

    30	the neighborhood
it is the neighborhood, communality, the constitutes the increasing 
approach of the domain. to the extent of a phenomenology of approach, the 
domain is asymptotic, never fully approached. the neighborhood is a 
confluence of neighborhoods, intersections demographics, zones and zoning 
ordinances, ethnicities - just about any conceivable attribute, fuzzy or 
not (for example, families whose surnames begin with 'Mc'). the neighbor- 
hood is also a maternality, a comfort-zone, an occupation constituted by 
the participant's introjections and projections. neighborhood is created 
by their increasing coherency and stability, a homeostatic domain itself. 
the attainment of homeostasis involves mechanisms for absorbing anomaly, 
to the extent that anomaly becomes subsumed (i.e. this moth is an unknown 
species within the imperial silk family).

    31	intersecting populations and worlds
no domain is pure, no approach can posit an isolated object for long. 
skeins intermesh diachronically and synchronically, across disciplines and 
other semi-rigid boundaries of the classical episteme. domains possess 
symptomatic leakage and staining; there are stigma-zones, exhaustion 
zones, depletion zones, zones of surplus accumulations. what is posited as 
an object both diffuses and expands; becoming invisible, it participates 
within neighborhooding, worlding - becoming visible, it participates in 
skew-orthogonal skeining and the report.

    32	phenomenology of withdrawal
every approach is a withdrawal; what is known is known in recession. the 
decrease of tolerance is asymptotic at best. the greater the knowledge, 
the weaker the theory, heuristics coming more and more into play. there 
are dialectics among reifications, objectifications, subjectivities, 
reports and encapsulations, releases and experience, determinations and 
faltering data, anomaly. the phenomenology of approach embeds withdrawal, 
just as withdrawal implies approach. every introjection, a projection; and 
every projection, an introjection.

    33	the skein (skew-orthogonal)
the grid and its imposition, input-output matrices, markov chains, tensors 
and absorptions of data, local geodesics, fuzzy or clouded enumerations, 
collocations of data.

    34	the skein (askew and local)
the local scribble, local geodesics without embedding, fluid-mechanical or 
cellular automata modeling, closures, accumulations of data, local messes.

    35  increasing audacity and circumscription
one takes increasing chances as danger apparently recedes by virtue of 
knowledge. how to approach a snake or alligator; how to ward off deerflies 
and no-see-ums. an approach is always a detour (thus the sides, top and 
bottom, are in evidence); the domain, no matter how problematic, is both 
skein-connected (to its environs, history, etc., without and with 
observation, to taxonomic schema, ideologies, cultures and civilizations, 
and so forth) - and disconnected (to the extent that it is not 'its' 
intention that one approaches, that one makes the approach, that it is 
within one's horizon - but who knows). a detour may follow one or another 
walk-around, or it maybe be a confluence/manifold of the totality of 
walk-arounds - for example, the semi-totalities of gathering periphyton 
data in space time through selected sites, extrapolated across the glades 
in their entirety. 

    36  the report
for example: the everglades as we know them are younger than writing; this 
residue is older than that. the report is tailored to distribution modes, 
economics, audience, historiographies, symbolic conventions, bibliography 
and reference, dedication and authority, placement within or without 
various series, a particular written language, attendant taxonomic ploys, 
languages, and paradigms. 

    37  the distribution
the distribution of the report enters the field of reports, processes of 
reporting and distributing, checks and counter-checks. the report is 
always already a reification by virtue of peer and other consensus; this 
is the escape or leakage of the phenomenology of approach into profession, 
professionalism, and doxa.

    38  the thinking of it
and the rethinking of it, the arc through and across the report, response, 
distributions, counter-distributions, argument and counter-argument, the 
return to the field, the walking-through the field, and always already 
transformation of the domain and its problematic.

    39  the world of it
the world is all that is the case. but the world and worlding are 
dissimilar and 'the' already breaks down among virtual and real, virtual 
particles and introjections/projections, phantasms and implicate orders. 
nothing remains of encompassment; domains dissolve or problematize, just 
as the 'of it' - already a possessive - is another releasement. 

    40  the knowledge, experiencing of the knowledge
what recedes, becoming, not knowledge, but implicate, implicated, tacit. 
my boundaries, body, disappear, absent themselves, among the thickets. 
worlding wheels on virtual axes; id and ego merge mute. what was real and 
had become symbolic now recedes into the imaginary and real. skin and 
masquerade become one; abjection diffuses among bodies, waters, earths, 
islands, hammocks. enunciation is always a problem increasingly distant as 
one silences, the report long gone, having been written, distributed, 
critiqued, absorbed, discarded. those series or skeins have no place here; 
evanescent, they're already exhausted by consciousness and defuge. the 
leaving that is left is an accompaniment, future inhabitation of memory or 
visitation, minding, mindful. no longer the distance of the approach or 
proximity of withdrawal, but only translucency, transparency on rare 
occasion. imagining the glades, but not without myself diffused, laminar, 
here and there, the skitter.

One falls into it: the text, the river, the Everglades, the alligator-maw.
It's productive, a kind of tacit/muscular intelligence at work, an
approach silencing language, in the guise of increasing (incipient)
structure. Gaining knowledge, gaining footholds, listening.

No one speaking but myself, enunciated, as if from/of the park (as if/from
the position, say, of a woman), but it is a fictivity, an approach itself,
introjection/projection.

Scales have neither beginning nor ending, pointsets and bandwidth; one
begins somewhere, after all. But the beginning is always occluded - always
this differance as you say, a deferring, not to the sign, but to its
absence - an absence spelled out only in the metapsychology of the
subject. ...

From ryan.whyte@UTORONTO.CA Sat May 11 22:31:23 2002

-Is it reductive to say that some of the texts you've produced operate
-across these kinds of formal structures, in which reading 'for plot'
-operates across this reading of the map of topographical/topological
-shifts, as it were? The metaphor strains, but it leads to an interesting
-situation of reading, in which 'formal' difficulties in reading apply
-pressure to a kind of tacit knowledge, "silencing language" -- arguably
-the situation of every reading, but 'more so' in this case; riskier --
-...

One might have a narratology without a reading, I think; the phenomenology 
of approach implies the former to the extent that there is a noticing, 
tending towards the intention to investigate, or at least approach - to 
reorient the mind and body towards (  ) - no matter how suffused (  ) is 
or appears to be. Even walking or a walk-around is a narration. 

One might consider an inordinately rough terrain - and then what happens? 
One's attention is consumed with keeping one's balance - almost nothing 
else is occurring, and any other goals or destinations - the teleology 
itself - may be put on hold, subsumed, reduced to a (default) tag in the 
subject's fuzzy scheme of things...

-Agreed -- but I wonder also if the psychoanalytic models -- projection
-etc --- might also be too reductive of what one might call the ecology of
-ideas, both in your texts and in the reading of them? As if the site were
-not that of fantasy or the ego but something that radically takes apart
-the ego, but 'speaks' nonetheless....

I don't think of the site 'taking apart' or 'speaking' - no such book of 
nature, etc. It's inert, real. Projection can be a diffusion or emission; 
certainly what's occurring in the phenomenology of approach is occurring 
within the subject, within the horizon of the subject - elsewhere, extern- 
ally, there's instrumental reason, etc. So I'm thinking of a broader meta- 
psychology, one of flows/flux/spew/emission as well (my notion of 'defuge' 
is related to this). As far as 'taking apart,' it's not as if the ego were 
assembled. In almost everything one does, it's absent (see Drew Leder); in 
a sense, neither it (nor id) nor the body are present -

[scales]

-And here the psychoanalytic -- at least the Lacanian -- is compelling --
-what is being addressed, what is addressing the subject in or in relation
-to the site (these sentences are difficult to write -- qualification on
-qualification)? The place itself fluctuates with stains, the screen....
[...]

Again, is the subject ever addressed? In the addressing of the subject, 
surely it's always the subject that's addressing, at least in the receiv- 
ing, if nothing else? A dead subject can never be addressed, at least in 
terms of interiority and horizon. The receptor is address.

I wrote a while ago about 'sm's - using sado-masochisms as a crude model 
for couplings and linkages, out of which worlding occurs. One might think 
of couplings and linkages in terms of the phenomenology of approach and 
the skein, embedding, distancing, etc. But that would be another text...

jennifer's dream of goodness

lacewings curled around each other in the doomed thicket.
they came to me and said, there is no competition; cut the cables.
the unseemly monotony of engines formed a distant phalanx.
already live-born young were the order of the day.
eggstrands transformed into protective grills.
poison occupied the tips of incessant life.
the contribution of the viruses was immense and not to be underestimated.
a second-order phalanx formed inside the mutated grills.
microscopic domains organized against the violence of the macro-world.
lacewing circulations, viral turbulence, across the sawgrass surface.
their stems bending slightly, sawgrass forests acquiesced to the power
of the thicket.
shudders went through skins of the mammalian order.
their live-born young died quickly of unknown contusions.
the phalanxes stilled among incessant life.
lacewings curled around each other in the order of the day.

i love my machines :sawgrass slides one way, cuts another. sawgrass
inscribes itself on retinal matrices. it says 'sondheim, there is nothing
to look at.' it says, 'sondheim, you will have nothing to see.' i hide
behind tender matrices of digital format and rastered resolutions
inscribed with rectilinear coordinates. sawgrass says, 'sondheim, this is
your imaginary.' sawgrass says, 'inscribe yourself.':liguus fasciatus
verge everywhere. i live hammock-snails. immobile, untouchable, fragile,
over fifty forms. worlds-creating against polluted waters cleansed by
cattail-marsh. my machines allow me to see beneath every surface. inside
my surface i am dirty dirty dirty. i run in shame from liguus fasciatus,
hammock-snails. i do not touch them / touch myself. i pick my face to
ruin. i cannot bear my face.:i am so poor i love my machines. years ago i
built my machines. i wear machines hide my insecurity / my stupidity / my
unoriginality. i wear machines hide my weakness / my shame / my
embarrassment. my machines say 'sondheim is not a pariah.' i am run by my
machines in this direction. it is winter-season and my machines run me. my
machines take me places. they move my body. they pleasure my mind. my
machines do not say shame shame shame. my machines do not say regret every
day. my machines empty me into them. shame shame we do feel
nothing.:5.5megapixel:

the glades are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a
park with variable boundaries, problematic topography based on hydrology
and human intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glades as
an _inscribed surface_ transforming in space and time - a surface organic
and shifting. the glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life
and migration; they are vectored, and vector is everything.

geology is underfoot; to manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem. 
invisible topographies / geologies manifest by surface organism. the 
indefinite prolonging of comprehension.

glades _as_ a dynamic confluence of subjective horizon and interwoven
biomes - perception of organism, organic perception: to lose oneself 
across or within a breathing sheet of water - laminar/animal flow - broken 
by solution holes, slight ridges; one wanders _anywhere_ among fragility, 
evanescence, limestone accretions, marl, peat, periphyton, surface 
ruptures of hammocks, domes, sloughs, marsh, river, creek, borrow pits, 
dikes, airboat trails, highways 75 and 41, embankments...

scalding water stops the pain for a moment; the hammocks carry blood-lust
in their very atmosphere; thickets are swarms; in dwarf cypress forest or
coastal prairie, one is accompanied by horse-flies, biting midges, wasps,
larger insects from a distance; chills and fevers wake one in night's
thick entanglement; one's body is a mess, suppurating, gouged and gnawed,
split, half-devoured.:deer-flies stinging constantly, the mosquito gouge,
sand midge extract. points of the body, usually ignored as implicit
hinging - elbow, ankle, knuckle - sudden areas of intense pain or scab, as
blood flies near the surface, bone heats up, the insect settles for the
final score. chills and fevers, slight numbing of the body, general
weakness.: :the arms first, then the fevers, the tingling, desire to gnaw
at one's flesh, lacerate onself, cut off the offending bit of flesh or
limb. it makes no difference - one dreams of alligator biting through the
fingers, itch giving way to momentary pain.:knees and shoulders:neck and
fingers
