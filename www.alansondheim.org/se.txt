qin, hotchiku, erhu, sarangi

for Leslie Thornton and meandering among her
suggestions, short pieces which also fulfill
intervals, silences, the hotchiku (a kind of
natural shakuhachi) with voice summoning the
spirits which follow me everywhere, they say
why summon, we are with you always, there is
none without us, and you, are none without -

[ for ELO, Paris ]


we all live within our hallucinations

when we die, we're sliding unawares and there have been
too many deaths and disruptions

holding on and poised above an abyss which opens everywhere

when i say "just over there" what i'm saying is that the
world falls off in every direction

you pick a point or position and walk towards it or force
your body into nodding

and over there, the abyss which means
there's nothing to hold onto

my breathing has become more and more difficult in these
rough terrains and when i sleep the machine prepares me
the catastrophe of the day

i'd want to say more, about how my search for the truth
was always emergent

but near the abyss, the loss, not only of information,
but of its viral carries, ensures it doesn't matter at 
the end

and that matter doesn't matter, that every point of the
abyss falters towards every other, flounders on every 
other

what life does is momentarily bear witness, and just
before blindness, it appears as if the subjunctive gains
the upper hand

oh these are heady days

these are days of death and the compression of death,
days of genocides and impulses

days of annihilation: to the limit!

when the earth turns, irradiating itself towards a bleak
and darkening sun

at least there are days and a succession of bands, 
of light, then dark, then light,
of dark, then light then dark

the body embraces catastrophe: see how the abyss invades
and cauterizes each and every thought!

and in every direction, and among all, and every one!

these are heady days, salvation burning like a star 
on its last coordinates

i'm looking up in every direction, and from each and 
every one, i'm falling

i'm falling for no one, i'm falling for nothing
and i understand, annihilation is the path, not the
means

the journey, and not the goal,
the way and not the end,

that the limit is asymptotic, and whatever one does,
one is coasting

among the others that are our selves or the same,
one is coasting

among the abyss and cessation, among annihilations
in lock-step and ready-made,
one is coasting

the keel of the boat, that too, in every direction,
and the keel is coasting towards the shore

and the shore is an hallucination
and we're living there, and dying, we're dying
in great numbers, 

and we're sliding, unawares

and in spite of or towards this speaking, and among
this speaking,

we're sliding, unawares

Collapse-production

all over hell and back the collapse-production 
of the Centre Pompidu performance, I'm still
picking up the pieces reductio ad absurdam and
what appears in http://www.alansondheim.org/reduc.mp4
is just about the quick fix to the platform,
mobius twists to the spheres, alterations 
through 3d printer technology files, so that
the result is the presence of the American
government shutdown as fascist Republicans 
stop the succeeding of our stalwart Blues to
have equality and justice for all, but never
fear, someone's marching to stop the madness,
oh those fierce Republicans with their guns in
their mouths, come to Chicago and New York and
Nairobi and see what they can do





Lousy


My recent work has been lousy, repetitive, mediocre.
I go over the same grounds again and again as I attempt
to hold onto my sanity in a world of ultra-violence.
Any response I might have to this world is lost in the
symbolic, nothing is left, nothing left behind.
I see our move to Providence as exile from the edginess
of Brooklyn, for me the last locus of alternative
negation. I see myself going over the same musical
grounds, playing alone or with Azure, without the dark
energy of the dominant saxophone. And I see my own good
ideas already on the block and lost. I'm lousy with a 
mind corrosive with self-pity, drive, obsession, and an
easy way out. I watch the body close down: carpal-
tunnel, stretched muscles, tinnitus, insomnia, sweat,
difficult breathing, clumsiness, stress, confusion:
what's left forms the few notes of the shakuhachi. I
take note of everything; I'm drowning in my own 
mediocrity. My end-blow flute-playing is lousy, my 
theory drags out thinkers from before the wars, my 
virtual world work imitates itself and I'm lazy in 
terms of new programming, my writing's pretty much 
ignored for good reason, and I still write from the
outmoded positionings of the murmur and the scream. I'm
exhausted with theory, I haven't read nearly enough, I
take shortcuts, my lousy thinking infects everything,
turning to paranoia at the slightest provocation. 
There - you see - "slightest provocation" - a lousy
trite phrase, because my thinking short-circuits 
itself, comes up with nothing new but a fabricated 
lousy honest that's close to unhinged. I wish for 
something new, some catalyst - students perhaps or a
Festschrift (I dare dream!) - to bring me out of this
study in gray, but I've wished for such all my life,
and this kind of wish is never granted, or granted 
at best in retrospect - and certainly not for the 
kind of lousy work I do. I type and think through the
autonomous nervous system, as if my circuits were 
jolted by some sort of external machinery from the 
gods, content be damned. I write but it writes itself
and in this case, this writing, this thinking, these
virtual worlds, these video, these images, this music,
is lousy, lousy, lousy, lousy, lousy. An epitaph -
stupidly, in spite of himself, he kept trying. The 
rest of us knew enough to ignore the results. He was
his own worst result. He was lousy.

He was lousy because he took the easy way out, as if
there were laurels to collect, choices made for him.
He went with whatever fell the fastest. He kept
waiting for his life and work to turn around, for 
something to turn them around, for him. He thought
practice, not insight, makes perfect. His thought was
lousy too.

Joy of Music

Chris Diasparra, tenor sax
Alan Sondheim, electric saz

saw! say "sax, saz!"!

We hadn't played in a while. This is beautiful,
done on the spur of the moment with Chris' new
sax. Apologies for the slight under-recording;
we just set up and started in.



People and Sleeping

From Al Wilson I learned you have to tune your instruments 
carefully. From Vito Acconci I learned I wasn't an artist and to 
only look at masterpieces. From Laurie Anderson I learned I was 
an artist. From Clark Coolidge I learned that it was okay to go 
as far as possible, and then turn around and find out it's still 
safe. From I.A. Richards I learned I have talent. From Keith 
Waldrop I learned I was a real artist. Because I can't sleep, I 
count my breaths, read, write, shower, cry, masturbate, cuddle, 
type this, script, send email, imagine a great iron sphere, 
imagine four-dimensional projections, think about theory and 
aphorisms, take sleeping pills and melatonin, brush my hair. 
From Kathy Acker I learned never to take my chances with a 
hippy. From Dad I learned I was a wastrel and a nincompoop. From 
Jabes I learned the virtues of condensation. From Foofwa I 
learned the value of mastery and intense preparation. From Darcy 
Lange I learned the virtue of speed. From John Todd I learned 
how to write. From Azure Carter I learned most of all. From -- 
----- I learned betrayal and I won't betray. From Gerald Jones I 
learned the American way of bad dying. Because I can't sleep, 
I've learned the value of lists, the necessity of half-truths, 
the art of being quiet. But people have taught me nothing and I 
am awake in the middle of the night.

Next day: In the middle of the night I am a coward. In the 
middle of the night I rake over old stories, crash-land "on a 
constant basis." I woke and slept and woke and slept today. I 
lost and gained a career. Where are the shakuhachi's high notes? 
Nada, Azure, and I had an amazing Japanese dinner. I continue to 
pursue the recording with Azure's songs. Steve has the master 
for the instrumental. I write this useless paragraph as an 
epitaph to the one above, bringing narrative to a halt as I once 
again try to sleep in the nearby future.



Violaline

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1212 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/violaline.mp3

Modified Lamy violaline, late 19th century.
I've tuned four strings to ee aa - two unisons a fourth
apart; the unisons are played separately, allowing for
major and minor intervals of all sorts, a different
kind of chording. It reflects exactly the disruptions
in our lives as we prepare for leaving Brooklyn for
Providence, all sorts of things given away, the place
turned upside-down. The music is strange, as is the
instrument.





Pill


After I take the pill, I think to myself: 
I am free of the pill. I am not taking it NOW.

I sleep through the pill. Therefore it has no
effect. When I am awake, the pill has 
disappeared. Like me, it has no existence.

My short term memory is confused when I wake;
objects exchange positions and functions. I
know the pill has created this transformation.
The day later returns to normal, but I am 
unsure: Where did the exchange happen and 
when? Am I not disordered NOW?

The NOW is the immediacy of the reaction
which cancels all others. I hate it; I would
rather live without it, another one of my
endless regrets. The NOW contains the seeds
of misery and corrosion, and what happens
subsequently is a hideous version of Marx's
exchange value: How can one value anything,
when the world is flat, nauseous, and lost
in dull confusion?

Ten minutes after taking the pill: Freedom
awaits!

most of the people i see in this town live in this town. 
some of them have come to this town, they are in this

on top screwing me, the crucifix went in and out my
mouth, or in and out of my mouth. he said to her i was
a nuisance and said to me she was a nuisance. she left
her diary open on the table and it said screwing me was
like being with a rat but i was paying the way. i never
understood maoism or marxism in practice. the inerrancy
of any position produces a screwing machine and a 
killing machine. retribution is never an option. listen
and you must salvage the theoretical work in the middle
of all of this. she gave all of us worms and said when
you sleep with hippies you take your chances. i had to
stay with him after the killer junkie went scratching 
at his door. should i have written in the midst of. am
i now in the midst of my life or, duree duree, does 
that depend on how near to the end i might be. what is
called the further end. she wanted to be a cockroach
on my wall and then future culture would have been
different. i remember jerusalem. my life of bad
behavior, the regret of use and abuse. my life of good
behavior, the regret of used and abused. but i was 
always under suspicion, tainted. i have always been
unacceptable but i was paving the way. all of our 
dirty little secrets are all of us all of the time.
this was going to be a story but catapulted. in the 
town there are people and to get from the city to the
town i must not miss a step. the body in translation 
is as near to continuity as any other, as possibility
or potential. the jump cut comes in the text bending
any moment into an other but in the read the bending
entangles and the jump cut smears across semantics or
a form of semantic lounging. i stayed with al and the
junkie left, but not before leaving shit everywhere in
the hall, off to do another killing.

Why Writing on the Move

Why writing on the move?
It's the thinnest mode of transmission, perhaps lower ascii
one of the thinnest of all, given the providence of low
code requirements - that is to say for example that the old
Morse dot-dash translates into letter and then the rest
follows - that is to say, most likely following Eco, a double
encoding.

So that it can occur on the run, so that it moves path-wise
from internals to externals and then to the world and its
noisy semiological theoretics. But the first stage, that of
the writing while, for example, I'm attempting to sleep or
shuddering yet again at the end of a difficult day - the 
first stage, like Speer on his walks, is an anywhere event,
providing of course any pain, physical or otherwise, is 
sufficiently dull or somnolent to permit a field of thought
and thought's operations, entangled, at play.

So that it requires very little apparatus, as if speech
itself would do, in the absence of any other technology
pursuant to speech's preservation, or at least the gist of
speech, minus the acrobatics of emotion or voice or tonal
structure.

I think of this as the bringing-up of speech during the 
move, or the movement of speech, bringing up the world
and its inhabitation.

And something which does not require an occasion, such as
this.

How is PURITY produced? Like the ABSOLUTE it's dependent on 
human aura, cultural-linguistic concerns paralleling word-
games in general. In this instance, PURITY creates a paper
tape representation, which is then fed back into the paper
tape program (ppt) to create a "cleansed" version of the 
same. Obviously this recursion could continue, each version
longer and at greater "distance" from the generator. What 
is the point? That PURITY is inconceivable to the extent 
that it's conceivable, and that it may as well be confused
with the ABSOLUTE: both engender similar forms of violence.

Sweet Garuda

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1217 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/sweetgaruda.mp3

Played on the 'Garuda lute,' an otherwise unidentified 
instrument most likely from Indonesia. It's fretless;
I have three strings on it (fifth/fourth) and the 
melodic work develops as a theme is taken up about 
half-way through. Here I am in Providence, proving to
myself I still can play something, in this case on an
unknown instrument. The melody becomes luscious some-
where near the end, and the full range of the lute is
explored. I should add that there is provision for a
fourth string (the lute needed extensive repair), but
due to the delicate nature of the top, I'm using only
three. Enjoy.



Brooklyn to Providence

We're in the zone between two cities, two states of mind, 
honestly, I don't know what we're doing here. Beginning again 
means proving myself again and I exhaust myself with repetition 
since I have no permanent locus of repute, nothing to build 
on. I watch carefully for signals. I exist on a plane of 
incomprehension. My cough is getting worse and gets worse at 
night. There's no end to it. The truth is, we have no reason to 
be here, no deep connection with a job or institution or field 
that requires our presence. We might as well be otherwise, but 
this is indicative of nothing more than a random step on a 
Turing tape. Otherwise is always otherwise. The plane of the 
event is brute history, not historiography. What gets lost in 
the detail is investment or purpose, and use value appears as a 
chimera of exchange. In other words, there are other words. 
Through this process, psychosis or at least daymares and night 
terrors result. Our books which ordered our lives are diffused 
and separated from themselves. Our skin falls off and I dream 
this. Everything is duplicated in the form of displacement 
processes. The processes are non-linear equations, chaotic, with 
a mute inability to return or recuperate an origin. The result 
is my sickness gets worse and entangled. At times I cannot 
breathe and this is accompanied by frightening color shifts and 
a rattling of the visual field. The field appears to burn as if 
the world charred, as if my fallen skin charred and I do not 
dream this; this is a gift of the real and its horror. I know in 
the depths of my being I do not belong here, I do not belong 
anywhere; I am the aleph and tav of the dance of the knives. The 
core of the problem is the absence of routes from the core, the 
absence of roots within it. If my eyes disappear, I am no more 
blinded than in the uncanny gully of the real which seems almost
the simulacrum of a life. I talk to my avatar and join her in 
the shards of the screen. One cannot have psychosis if one is 
psychosis; one cannot be flesh if one is flesh. Here, where I am 
not and have not been, one cannot be. The other cannot be either 
and none of us can. The shards of her avatar say so.

[I take credit for the lines above. At first... I used quotation 
or pseudonym; the transformation into literary pastiche made it 
acceptable. But then I realized: I am not acceptable; this is 
the solution of equation and its more than imaginary routes. 
From out, there is no way out.]

dressed badly, crazy/psychotic look, about 30, screaming
the following over and over again - the last line sometimes 
repeated -

I'M DUMB
I'M SORRY

elimination dance

for any number of dancers, nude.
they do what they want for as long as they want.
they shit, piss, cum, spit, cry, vomit, sweat,
with any other available internals expelled.
they do this on each other until they're emptied.
when they're emptied the dance ends.

(variation: after the elimination dance -
they devour each other's internals until 
everything's clean and fresh again and 
now they're all part of each other.)



..so we decided we'd turn one room dark and one room light
and put the instruments and humidifier in the dark room
because the light really does pour in and in the bright 
room the wood will dry out and there go more cracks in the
instruments, so we made an alcove near the bed and put as
many of them as we could around it so you can see all of
them as has been traveling with adam and azure and myself
have made it and now the question is who is going to want
to listen to these things here and who's around to play 
with and what do i do so i'm not a total freak here even
though i might have to go running with azure back to new
york since a lot of people here tell me that's the case 
and providence can't hold onto crowds which i do really
understand since i lived here admittedly years ago but for
a good thirteen or so years in a row and towards the end
of that period i was getting tired feeling that i was in
fact totally crazed and getting out was my only option so
i opted for running down to the city which was of course
new york as often as i could sometimes crashing at vito
acconci's place on christopher street and for the rest i 
really forget where i stayed but those were desperate 
times and pretty soon i moved down into the city myself
with my second life and we took a place that tom bowes 
had had and then that was the end for a while of rhode 
island for me and i never looked back but now here i am
in a place downtown on westminster street and i'm trying
to feel not entirely insane even with the medications the
clinic doctor gave me which are all interacting in a kind
of chemical soup so i called my brother and got some good
advice from him about which to cut out before i kicked 
the bucket which is far too early for me especially when 
i end up wandering around the alcove looking at the 
instruments there are starting to play again for the big
gig we've got coming up as part of the 50th anniversary
of esp-disk at jack in brooklyn and i'm wondering how on
earth do i get these down to the city and find parking 
and not stress over the car and focus focus on the 
playing before i make a fool of myself pretending to 
play anything from viola to one sort or another of saz
or cumbus which are still sitting prettily in the 
alcove not realizing they may be about to partake of a
strange and vast journey into musicland with the only
but very major difference that we're going to be going
back to providence, repeatedly returning in one or 
another direction and you know how stressful that can be
which was the case that gravitated me towards the big
city in the first place resulting in a somewhat muddied
art career hanging out with amazing people and finding 
my own way at a place called mcgoos or magoos which i 
think had prostitutes on the second floor but on the 
first was the best art bar eatery ever as far as i was
and still am concerned although now there's a place
called food as part of as220 in providence that isn't
really the same as the old food in soho which was 
always too expensive for me but that i passed by all
the time on the way from here to there or some such 
and now wish i could return for twenty minutes to that
corner just the way it was which is pretty much how 
as220 is except for the restaurant food per se but the
rest of the corner and soho had a mean and hungry look
and i wasn't playing music again at that time having
given it up in the previous decade or some such as i
felt like a fake and it was getting to be too much for
me so i arrived and was busy with photography and 
video and showing and making one mistake after another
which i threaten myself with that i'll keep doing the 
same looking out the windows on westminster and down
the street past as220 to the overpass where the 
highway says towards new york in one direction and 
boston in the other and it doesn't say towards the 
city but after new york there isn't any other in any 
case so i move from the bay window back into the light
side of the place we're in now and cross to the short
hallway on the right where i take another right into
the dark room and there among everything else in the
alcove there are bowed and plucked instruments as well
as some endblown flutes and i found of course there 
was no room for the pump organ there so that has had
to stay in the bright side where it glows and usually
has a shakuhachi and xiao resting on it for company
and i keep thinking to myself these are lean times
and what will go down in the end and will i live
through it and what will become of us in this strange
place i've returned to which is now replete with 
water and fire features downtown where the river used
to be covered over but now is full of light where i
worry i'll be trapped and unable to focus and just
learn to relax and live here with the two rooms and
just about no one to listen to or care about the 
music or media or theory stuff i do or see that stuff
either and have i regressed and turned back into the 
crazed and neurotic person i used to be here which
formed me into that uncomfortable mold or am i adding
layers to it from the position of the home you can't
return to because even that has been torn down or at
the least turned into a house so i'll go into the
dark room now and that will shield the world from me
and shield me from the world until the story drains
out or becomes so repetitive it's lost its way as i
worry day in and night out that i've lost mine

..anything into anything..
..all the greats have passed, de beauvoir, sartre, derrida
too, kristeva fading out.. even the communist party, 
everything replaced by.. anarcho-dada marxism, juche idea..
then again, what i mean is.. the digital erases everything
.book about two hundred letters in length ..fully
erasable ..not a moment to lose ..think of hegel or kant
intense lore: minute detail.. concentration camps..
enumeration.. kim il sung.. reverence of big game hunter
t.r... i twerk, you twerk, they hook up.. maybe three
hundred letters.. black book enumerations, assange
..in every government there are twenty percent who are 
ready and willing to reveal everything ..feel the wires
..lacan for example ..imaginary perl ..symbolic ..no 
comments so for example compactification.. thick stuff.. 
badiou's next, i can feel it.. zizek rewrite barthes.. 
badiou's big message of truth and being.. another sartre
..freedom bound ..think schopenhauer, nietzsche, irigaray
someone else, on the tip of the tongue, they're all true..
number system's a schism.. indo-european thought and the
i.e. corpus ..canon and genre, forget everything you know
about ..this will revolutionize thought itself ..for
example biotek.. flourescence.. two hundred words, 
huge amount.. anyone can do it.. release anything into
the air.. make a virus from lego, biomolecules, agar-agar
will do wonders.. what could darwin have been thinking
..must be somewhere around here ..vaihinger for example
deleuze and guattari ..the resistance ..ironclad ..room
for heroes of a difficult sort, self-generating universe 
..universes! ..something comforting in 200 pp. ..world!
grows, longer, turn around, swallow itself.. domination
for example of freud, newton.. thought thinks thought..
..in the end a difficult stitch ..aphoristic data of
10^100 pages ..don't have to read them ..at your
fingertips ..monuments, there were real monuments in 
those days

we're living in downtown providence next to a club that seems
to have paid off someone in order to break whatever noise
rulings the city might have. or not, but we recorded 77.3 db
in our place with the windows closed, most of it in the bass
or in the upper-mid range of yelling crowds. so i recorded 
cumbus saz against this, playing in the midst of or immersed
in, the rumble which is fairly audible on the track. i like
the result, although i'm not sleeping a lot of nights with 
the windows rattling in the bedroom. in any case it enabled
me to do some experimentation with the saz, particularly with
left-hand fingering; i felt transported in the midst of the
double streams of sound. enjoy.



by not naming, has not happened

years ago i drove up to montreal and i remember it was night and 
when we arrived all the cafes were playing john lennon and we 
felt torn apart, a kind of exile there, we were cut off, the new 
city was singing, we had left the old. now here in providence, 
repetition with another singer, another voice, in the bookshop, 
and another death and with each there's the shortness of the 
span which contracts with every passing. there's nothing to say 
beyond that, beyond exiles, as we're all exiled in this world 
and not in the world to come, which is always and always already 
without us. every death is the death of a world and every world 
is inside one, or another, and every world is private, shared 
and unshared and without translation. and it doesn't matter if 
one dies at forty or seventy-one or ninety-seven, it remains the 
death of a world, and the world's death, and the death of being 
and being's horizon. and we can mourn only so long as we are in 
exile, and when our exile ends, others mourn may in our stead or 
perhaps not at all, and we shall not know, we shall never know.
