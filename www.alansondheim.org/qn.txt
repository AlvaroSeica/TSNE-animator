plato's cave of reflections and mirrors, maybe medusa, the real


inside the body of the avatar-with-attachments
within the invisible body of the avatar
outside the attachments remaining invisible
beyond the shadows of the body have disappeared
below the reflections of attachments are visible
into the water reflections having fallen
above the water reflections coming into play
throughout reflections among the invisible body
out there treating us to reflection's afterthoughts
under the air the water containing recognitions
among the recognitions attachments appearing clearly
beside the attachments no body nothing residing
on the attachments memories of visibility
in the attachments segments of missing body

julu twine out of luck and image
jennifer's attachments' reflections' distortions coming into their own
something about material cultures and absent centers, erasures
something else, julu and jennifer forgot

Two, Uncanny

I have just had enough, with this one I think, of the alien nature of
this configuration - shapes appearing in the sky, underwater, close-
up but not quite, distanced, but not quite, doubly moving extrinsically
as fallen objects and intrinsically as transforming plasma. These haunt
my dreams and nightmares. The phenomenology is hypnagogic, peripheral:
of the dispersed alien vanishing, generating clouds of virtual particles
residing among memories of a distant future.

Ivan Sullivan on acoustic saz, I'm on electric saz, we're in a garden 
at the Flying Saucer here in Brooklyn. There's something driving about 
this, as if it were a tradition, shades of Michael Snow and who knows.

(I want to thank the one person who commented on my files yesterday; I
really did/do need feedback. Ah well, too many bytes under the bridge
makes the boy cry wolve.)

First flooding:: i'm lost and uninitiated. i'm alone and concatenated, 
old among julu, waiting for the world to start. is clotting everything. 
- Your damming is soaked, written, erased the next smearing of your 
thinking skin.

Your binding should be wiped into existence? Consider the following 
again, your lost and uninitiated. i'm alone and concatenated, old among 
julu, waiting for the world to start ...
the doll splits me, binds you, splits and damns you.

i'm lost and uninitiated. i'm alone and concatenated, old among julu, 
waiting for the world to start., then and only then, worlds slow up like 
older things, forgetting origins is sufficient for me.

i'm lost and uninitiated. i'm alone and concatenated, old among julu, 
waiting for the world to start. if the world started, then for how long 
before the end. i rest among animals, waiting for dearths. then and only 
then, worlds slow up like older things, forgetting origins oh and then 
waiting for origins.
and then, nothing.
and then, everything.

and everything is your chemistry here.
worlds slow up like older things, forgetting origins. 

then and only then, worlds slow up like older things, forgetting origins 
calling forth hungry ghosts, making things.
calling forth hungry ghosts making things.

in the detritus, then and only then, worlds slow up like older things, 
forgetting origins, if the world started, then for how long before the 
end, resting among animals, waiting for dearths. and ... ghosts _are,_ 
and then, nothing, the ghosts of drowning flesh.

the hungry ghosts take up space and time

they gnaw at texts devour texts
they corrupt corrode texts, texts are food, texts are lost
hungry ghosts: texts are lost food
hungry ghosts: texts are loss of food

there is never enough of texts inscriptions writings
there is never enough of anything, scrabble-dirt inscriptions

hungry ghosts ourselves, irreal, unknowing to ourselves, forbidding and
among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry ghosts, they gnaw at 
ghosts reborn as mendicants. They are hungry ghosts. They are red dust.
there are hungry ghosts after me, they know
and reborn as mendicants. They are hungry ghosts. They are red dust.
there are hungry ghosts after me, they know
   the rule of hungry ghosts, speed-speed wounded biomes,
emptiness radiates outward between the spokes. now forget the 
spokes, emptiness radiates among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry 
ghosts, they gnaw at emptiness, they are wounded, 
   the rule of hungry ghosts, speed-speed wounded biomes
hungry ghosts without features
hungry ghosts without features
hungry ghosts without features
among hungry ghosts - fucking ghosts - mudra inversions of names - space
ghosts, written by ghosts, written by homing ghosts, hungry ghosts, 
ghosts reborn as mendicants. They are hungry ghosts. They are red dust.
   the rule of hungry ghosts, speed-speed wounded biomes
phenomena of hungry ghosts and emblems
phenomena of hungry ghosts and emblems
phenomena of hungry ghosts and emblems
here are hungry ghosts after me, they know
among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry ghosts, they gnaw at 
hungry ghosts, murmurs almost gathered into words, the inchoate lost in 
Yamantaka carrying prayer-wheels carrying Yamantaka, hungry ghosts reside
Yamantaka carrying prayer-wheels carrying Yamantaka, hungry ghosts reside
Yamantaka carrying prayerwheels carrying Yamantaka, hungry ghosts reside,
calling forth hungry ghosts, making things and

hungry ghosts, starvation and unforgetting.

let us never forget that other economics of the feasible, of starvation.

wall of fire and thirst, wall of starvation,

side, in my stomach. prisoners of starvation. the whole trouble started.

ange, ange,

ange, weapon distribution, religious fanaticisms, starvation, 
desertification - the unsupportive world.

against the exigencies of starvation, geopolitics, militarisms of all.

those close to starvation; those in the midst of wars and famine.

the goal is starvation - our means, these mouths portending rich and poor, 
surplus and starvation, all within a single starvation and misery among 
tyrants worse than promised hell itself.

The whole trouble started bottom; starvation's kept out of it.

starvation mountain. Julu tends me with a kind and tender hand.
line up, leave starvation.

liquids; skeins and flood-plains, woe, woe to desiccation and starvation; 
liquids; starvation; skeins liquids, woe; flood-plains and flood-plains 
woe, desiccation to starvation, woe; and to the rusted machinery rusted 
subject, the subject of knives and starvation, the subject of starvation, 
woe, alas.

with every death from starvation in this country, the statue of liberty. 
with every death from starvation in this country, the statue of liberty. 

witness the extinction of species, starvations, and that i cannot bring 
myself to starvation.

against the avalanches and starvation against the cold and damp.

those close to starvation; those in the midst of wars and famine; those 
producing these equations in dirt-poor factories around the world. 

let us never forget that other economics of the feasible, of starvation,
economics feasible, starvation here, understood absence, 

the walls of fire and thirst, wall of starvation,

mate change, weapon distribution, religious fanaticisms, starvation, 
liquids, starvation, skeins liquids, flood-plains and flood plains,
'the wobbling pivot.' 

and the walls of fire and thirst, wall of starvation,
and the walls of fire and thirst, wall of starvation,

after this: deterioration, gangs, spam, hacks, starvations, local wars,

starvation, woe, alas.



=====================================================================

My sound files are in a new archive - please check it out!

ESP-Disk has given me server space for my sound/music works (solos and
collaborations). I won't have them any longer at - www.alansondheim.org,
but do check out -

http://www.espdisk.com/alansondheim/

The following has the latest at the top - at this point, however, it
depends only on upload order -

http://www.espdisk.com/alansondheim/?M=D

Eventually there will be about 550 or more files up. They're almost all
mp3s. Please enjoy, and let me know if you have questions about individual
works. (There are about 240 up now; it's a long upload.)

When I make newer pieces, I'll announce them with the new URL; they'll be
at the top of the list. Note this work is all for free, but you can still 
support the musicians!

I want to thank everyone at espdisk.com for giving me this space. Needless
to say, ESP-Disk, like every alternative recording company, needs your
support!

Thanks, Alan

old chinese yueqin i found ('moon guitar')

recorded in pennsylvania on my asus because nothing else is here
so the .ogg is neutral, .wav quite interesting w/ changes thru 
audacity - audacity is best served wild and useless -
a play or ploy alleviating depression maybe
i'm surprised this stuff is here 
i give this stuff away for free but if you want
you can send me your spare change and even change you can't spare
in gratitude for the noise i've made for years now
in one year and out the other but you can save these precious
gems and listen whenever the mood or friendship strikes you

the new modern1.mp3

forget the old modern1.mp3, modern2.mp3, modern3.mp3, terrible
here's the new modern1.mp3, modified by hiss reduction, excellent

so this is new - http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/modern1.mp3

i'm losing it. i've played other 1-string instruments before, quite well, 
but not the monochord or marine trumpet. this rebabah with its internal 
resonances feeding back? impossible - hiss reduction takes care of that. 
whatever it takes to make the sound, asence, asense.

and the old modern1.mp3, modern2.mp3, modern3.mp3, all gone, apologies 
for your damaged ears. :-(

Growing up here and having children here:


I grew up here:

All my children are here:

http://www.alansondheim.org/allmychildren.mov


New project here - either Well or Brane here - 

The first refers to something that is low/beneath the surface - but 
reflects the sky, tapping into something hidden here.

The second references an n-dimensional object in string theory that may 
or may not exist here.

Think impossible or inconceivable objects, objects nonetheless that may be 
fundamental to the cosmos - think fundamental ontology here.

Goals:

1. To further explore dance/choreographic/behavioral issues in Second 
Life here.
2. To further explore these within complex negotiated environments here. 
3. To explore media-modified environments with contradictory video/audio 
materials here.
4. To explore narratologies and performances here in these environments.
5. To relate all of this to a developing philosophy of difference and 
contradiction here.

(+growing up here) - (+all my children here) = philosophy of difference 
and contradiction here.

the useless chant of hypnotic y-c you

I wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares, all the time, beat- 
ing myself up. I'm constantly haunted by death, regrets, finality: today 
for example - is this the last class I'll ever get to teach? Since my 
archives are scattered among two universities, I feel like dead man 
walking; I'm already packaged, what I haven't accomplished I'll never 
accomplish. Finality is accompanied by thuds. My current music archive is 
at the resurrected ESP-disk site - a company that disappeared decades ago. 
My fiftieth high-school reunion is, I think, now, and I dread the thought 
of going, choosing to die remembered elsewhere. In my bar mitzvah book - 
yes, we found that going through things at my father's home - among the 
pictures of dance/prance/pray, I put a picture of the explosion of the 
first hydrogen bomb. The paper is yellowed, as if cosmological physics 
suddenly became antiquated. I am waiting for my friends to die. How can I 
speak to Vito Acconci for example of the hurt he caused me; everything is 
already dust. Or my father, whose psychological abuse - which he was in no 
way responsible for - how can he understand at 96, what happened to me - 
how my depressions, unbearably out of control, began in relation to his 
temper and my fears of just being alive? I tried suicide as a kid, mixing 
iodine with milk, which turned out to be an antidote, which is the story 
of my life, and the suicide attempt was hidden and probably not that 
serious anyway - another regret. Now I'm in the midst of yet another panic 
attack, it's almost 5am, I'm teaching the last class ever tomorrow, which 
won't be any better than the others in this course, another sleepless 
night - thinking about Rwanda, the unutterable violence we do to one 
another, the fury of this species. And I hypnotize, mesmerize, myself into 
the granularity of absence, remaining alive, worried constantly about 
Azure and her survival after me, knowing I will never know, that absolute 
finality, that the thud, will create a barrier forever, that I won't even 
recognize the barrier, that I won't be. I worry my collaborators as well 
are disappearing - I'm not surrounded by a kind of critique any long, 
critique that kept me on edge, functioning; now my music is freak-music, 
my writing freak-writing, my Second Life installations freak-stallations, 
stalling for time, for the imminence of immanent death. You don't want to 
be me. My student, who I worry about, writes she can't make class today, 
her bf has to go to the VA hospital, she's missed an appointment with him 
already, he has cancer

What if I had opened the wrong file? I know for a fact - from everything 
I've been told - that Derrida would have wanted to hear this; I've never 
been so sure of anything; it's a given; it would have filled an irrevoc- 
able gap; a hiatus signaling the mathesis-to-come; it would have been an 
insistent completion; where nothing had been recognized; where nothing 
would come in relation - the future anterior; the missile striking down; 
cauterizing - differend and differance; the finality of the differend; of 
course: is not equivalent to death; is identical to death: is that signa- 
ture which always already remains elsewhere inscribed: this work would 
have - in other words - other sounds - sutured the signifier: displacement 
towards materiality under erasure; what is under erasure is always already 
uncanny; within the imaginary; you are listening to the imaginary; the 
imaginary is always the file; always the right file; whatever is opened is 
the right file; the right file is the right file-for: that is; for someone 
- for something - intended: this is the intended file: the open file is 
always the opened file: always the intended file: whatever is; is intended

arriving after its departure; by fundamental hiatus - before your own; and

Jazz Lounge prelims -

Myk, Azure, and myself playing. We're playing tomorrow night at the Jazz 
Lounge -

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh4.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh3.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh2.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh1.mp3

So this was a departure, Myk on acoustic steel-string carbon-fiber guitar 
- I'm no the usual various including kamanche which I probably won't bring 
- but the rest is there - more jazz-oriented maybe - a kind of mellowness 
- maybe the attempt car-bombing - maybe just the teetering of worlds - in 
any case, come tomorrow night if you're in the vicinity - if not, or even 
if you do, have a listen to these. By the way, the poor recording is the 
result of very soft music and very loud outside noise - and our place was 
at maybe 84-85 degrees at the time - Alan


Some recording from Jazz Lounge gig tonight -

Well for one thing the other group didn't show and for another, the 
recording - which I did - turned out largely unusable except for the 
following excerpts which give a fairly good idea of what went on, with the 
exception of Azure's songs - these didn't come out at all. What I think 
happened was that subsonic stage and other floor movements resonated with 
the corner we played in - a kind of wolf-note effect below the range of 
human hearing, but not below the range of recorder compression. The result 
was literally impossible to listen to - lots of thumps and things unheard 
but sensed, taking out the music. After using graphic equalization, hard 
limiting, normalization, hiss reduction and editing, the following is what 
resulted - on it you'll hear Myk Freedman, guitar, and myself, oud and 
cura cumbus in some fairly weird combinations. Everything else had to be 
scrapped. But this stuff's good -

one eternity to another

a message from somewhere, and somewhere sounding the truth
a mask muffling the sounds
harmonics proclaimed from loudspeakers mounted on the tallest masts
in the mist, disembodied sounds, the atmosphere's subtle movements
masses of clouds and the distinct smell of musk, the warm air within
must muffling the sounds, as if chimes murmured the world's bleak end
the most of nothing as comparisons were fruitless, the soundings

the sonde reflecting invisibility, nothing without reception
the sound awaiting its turn on the turning vagaries of winds and clouds
sending and transporting waves, cargoes of particles, unmarked memories
in the sand, everything, inscribed from one eternity to another

they would have replied, sync among worlds, forming worldings
sync sent, the upheaval of universal space
universal spaces struggled, mumbling, unheard, and sank
the sink absorbing what had come before, nothing had come before
nothing was sunk, nothing mumbled, nothing had come before

(the synod 
a bond among them
so fond of thinking, nothing ever unthought, unthinking of nothing
harbors and ponds, the tallest masts by the shores of endless seas
sod and barriers, no one presencing, expecting, no denouement

Homeless and inworld


Lost my place in SL a while ago
Just happened when permissions changed
Distrust land, land gets you nowhere
Carry your stuff with you, wherever you go
There's no place to rest, no place to stretch out
Me, I like to stretch out, talk with anyone around
No one's around in these vacated lands
No one's got permissions, least of all me

Everyone's bellies are full of prims
They don't even have to put them away,
Me, they're just what I got on my back
Look at me, falling from the sky

Empty's the world, the first and the second
They're one and the same, busy hands at work
They take pennies from the little guy
The rich get rich, the poor get you know what

The coffers overflow in first and second lives
All money's virtual, wherever it's kept
I've never seen a coffer, wouldn't know if I did
But if something overflows, you can bet there's money there

Wait, I've got a few more lines to go
Wearing the stuff I own slows me up a bit
Want a glowing prim, just give me food
Or shelter from nothing at all, I'm just tired of falling

(thinking about SL, not in terms of RL or extrapolation -if such be 
possible - a crude, close to useless, outline below)


deliberately mistaken ontologies of life-worlds


"The SL space is almost always treated as a simulacrum of real life - by 
the creators as well! But as an abstracted mathematical topology, it's far 
more than that; others will take it farther in the future, already are. I 
also want to discuss being-in-mathesis, beyond the SL 'standard' represen- 
tation."

SL: [describe] = 2 [split choice]
0:
RL: [explain] = 1 [given]

---------------------------------------

0: neutral
1: obdurate, there is, idiotic real
2: choice / intentionality

0: neitherness, not both A and B, neither A nor B (a priori mathesis)
1: fragility of the good: computer program error, intrinsic
2: error extrinsic, deferment

0: null set
1: universal set
2: split tending towards as-if

1-2: leakages between them
problematic metaphor [0/1/2]: numbers as markers of inscriptions,
 multiplicities, neutralities (the idiotic)

RL: 1: immersive, fundamentally dynamic (potential stases)
 - internal: operated _in_
SL: 2: definable, fundamentally static (real mobility)
 - external operators: operated _on_

Attacking the metaphor: misplaced quantification and ordering among
'plexa,' misplaced mathesis (plexus, from plico, plicatum, to fold,
to knit - Lynd's Class-Book of Etymology, 1861)

Intentionality: 
suturing in RL: cohering subjectivity, harmonic continuity, incoherent 
 and dynamic inscribing
suturing in SL: coherent physics, discordant continuity, coherent
 inscribing (it's inscription that holds it together)

Problematic ontology of SL: mathesis/inscription = what is; the world
 is a world only by virtue of its (visible, sensed) manifestation,
 information clarified and lost, backup of SL
Problematic ontology of RL: virtual particles, information entanglement
 and conservation, no backup 

Off the map i -

Nagarjuna and Madhyamaka - emptiness and dependent origination / 
dependent arising 

Off the map ii -

SL: Think of root originations in server farms, permissions and 
 specificies of address
RL: Think of fundamental ontologies under erasure, feynman diagram
 probabilities: what constitutes dependency under probability 
 distributions -

Off the map iii -

Physical ontology is always abstracted, as-if
 (SL and anti-conventionalist argument)
There is no _fundamental_ physical ontology

Off the map iv -

Mathesis and Badiou's position - relation to surreal numbers

On the map -

Thinking of SL as abstracted, split, chosen, programmed: anything that is 
programmable is possible. Thinking of RL as given, born-into: thought as 
conceiving. Consider SL _not_ as subset of RL - as fulcrum; consider SL 
as the visual counterpart of the space of Mathematica. 

Psychology, psychoanalytics of SL in this case: matrix, borromean knot, 
 meta-level jumping (collocation of constructing, dwelling-in)
The body as entangled projections/introjections (jectivity) independent
 of traditional physical constraint or representation
The locus of the body in the physical body (SL as perceptual organ)

The traditional/narratological function of SL = equivalent to cinematic
 diegesis
The non-traditional functioning of SL (above) = processes of dynamic 
 suturing



                                                            (preliminary)
==========================================================================

deliberately mistaken ontologies of life-worlds

{ SL = Second Life, used somewhat interchangeably for virtual worlds; RL = 
real life, or 'first life,' used somewhat interchangably for physical 
reality. }

"The SL space is almost always treated as a simulacrum of real life - by 
the creators as well! But as an abstracted mathematical topology, it's far 
more than that; others will take it farther in the future, already are. I 
also want to discuss being-in-mathesis, beyond the SL 'standard' represen- 
tation."

RL: [explain] = 1 [given] The real world is given, inert, obdurate, one or 
many - it's still one, presenced. The real world possesses at least four 
fundamental forces, various constants from fine-structure to gravitation- 
al; these things - static or dynamic - are given. Physics is explanatory, 
attempting coherent and agreeable structures in depth. David Finkelstein: 
physics is fucking the real. There is always the potential of deep error.

SL: [describe] = 2 [split choice] The virtual world is described; its 
description is its fundamental ontology. It is split; constants are by 
consensus. There are no basic forces at work; motion is the result of 
redraw, rewrite. The physics is the result of an attempt to construct 
coherent and agreeable structures in depth. David Finkelstein: pure math 
is masturbation. There is always the potential of surface error.

0: Neither description nor explanation, but a postulate of a neutral 
backdrop, perhaps the Madhyamaka backdrop, the problematic of the existent 
in relation to logical falsification. But perhaps here, or perhaps here in 
the sense of a diacritical mark:

0': the psychoanalytics of the subject lies, a psychoanalytics deeply and 
permanently entangled in perceptual modalities. This is the locus of 
peering-out, or not peering-out.

0, 0': neutrality - neutrality appears and disappears.

1: obdurate, there is, idiotic real. The thetic, demonstrative, occurs in 
the 1: which is the real; 1 is not a number, but a condition. 1 is not a 
choice, but within 1, there are always choices, splits: frames of 
reference, wave or particle functions. One is 'like that'; the real has a 
certain style.

2: choice / intentionality. The virtual world is chosen; it is also in- 
tended, intended against the backdrop of 0 and 0'. Now this is important: 
the virtual world lies within a potential well; it has both internal and 
external boundaries: it _runs_ at a designated clock-tine; it is a 
construction within the social; it is, in other words, a fabric.

0, 0': neitherness, not both A and B, neither A nor B (a priori mathesis). 
Neitherness and its dual may be taken as the two fundamental operations of 
the propositional calculus (elementary logic); they're the Sheffer stroke 
and its dual. But they are also expulsions, abjections, avoidances, the 
loci of subjectivities in relation to spewing-forth in real or virtual 
worlds. Neti neti: neither this nor that, neither the one nor the other, 
the one or the two, the one or two and the Other.

1: fragility of the good: computer program error, intrinsic. Within the 1, 
there is, as Leibniz might unfurl himself, the potential for the catas- 
trophic, in the sense of catastrophe theory. And while there are infinite 
errors, there may be, as in chaos theory, only one viable solution - 
surrounded by problematic others, mutations which produce nothing, which 
corrupt. Or not, as some extend themselves. Nonetheless, it is within the 
one that the computer program error appears, as error - as something 
needing correcting, something turning away from the coherently expected 
answer, something which doesn't survive the rituals of debugging. In this 
sense, the physics of the computer program in general parallels the 
physics of the real; both are open to contradiction or falsification in 
their running explanations/processes. These errors are intrinsic to 
programs and theories which are aligned with pre-determined goals, as if 
there were design (not intelligent design to be sure) involved.

2: error extrinsic, deferment. Think of computer program errors which are 
extrinsic - produced results leading elsewhere, the result of choice or 
decision, not necessarily an error, but an extension - one finds a con- 
tinuous deferment, one error leading to novelty, the plateau of novelty, 
the tendency of the plateau towards another error or another extension, 
and so forth. This is the result, the habitus, of intention; this is the 
dwelling of distinctions where, utopia-like, any error may be no error at 
all, and anything at all might be intended, willed, to survive.

0, 0': null set. Thus 0 is the set of all those objects not equal to them- 
selves, but let us consider 0' to be the division between two distinct 
populations, X and not-X: that is, the intersection. However this inter- 
section is impure; it exists in-relation-to-X and not-X; it is the null 
set, but the null set in-relation, and therefore of and within/without the 
subject.

1: universal set. Thus 1 is the universal, cosmological, set - totality, 
however defined; in a sense 2: virtual worlds, are subsets within it. From 
within and without 0, but not within and without 0', which is almost 
something else altogether.

2: split tending towards as-if. Virtual worlds are always split: split 
from the real (guided, protected, within the literally circumscribed, 
circumprogrammed, potential well), and split in terms of decision trees 
(this - and not that - gravitational constant employed, for example.) And 
virtual worlds are always already as-if; there is nothing else to them. 
As-if what? As if they're dynamic, as if the illusions were real. Real 
how? As-if one might turn away from the screen, unplug everything, and 
fly.

1-2: leakages between them. Neither polarities nor entirely independent: 
the body, inscribed, is already virtual; the virtual world, embodied, is 
already real. The bridge between them is the uncanny; both reals are 
imaginary. Leakage is abject - as if there were leakage, as if there were 
virtual/real polarities.

The metaphoric 0,0',1,2: numbers as markers of inscriptions, valuable in 
terms of thinking about multiplicities, neutralities (the idiotic), 
inscriptions. Within 0,0' inscription is primary; everything is inscribed 
but inscribed differently. And inscription is necessarily circumscription, 
the symbolic bounded by the symbolic, the sememe tending towards the 
appearance of closure. (Attacking the metaphor: misplaced quantification 
and ordering among 'plexa,' misplaced mathesis (plexus, from plico, 
plicatum, to fold, to knit - Lynd's Class-Book of Etymology, 1861).)

So we might say:

Real life: 1: immersive, fundamentally dynamic (potential stases) - inter- 
nal: operated _in._ Immersive: inhabited within the space-time manifold, 
such that contradiction or contrary is always a process; in the real, 
nothing contradicts anything. In real life, there is no server roll-back.

Second life: 2: definable, fundamentally static (real mobility) - external 
operators: operated _on._ How definable? Every element has been placed, 
intentionally; every element carries permissions and attributes; every 
element may be removed; every region, every thing, every world, may be 
rolled-back.

==========================================================================

Intentionality and suturing of the subject:

Suturing in real life: cohering subjectivity, harmonic continuity, 
incoherent and dynamic inscribing: what is inscribed, erodes, corrodes, 
decays, disintegrates; the subject, subjectivity of the subject, dies. 
While alive, the body continues, is continuous; there is no teleporting, 
no disappearance. The body physically moves in and out of presence; in 
real life, there are no (space/time) jump cuts. And the body decays; 
existing in a potential well (clothing, shelter, skin), it is always 
subject to collapse, death, detritus. The body ingests, excretes.

Suturing in virtual worlds: coherent physics, discordant continuity, 
coherent inscribing (it's inscription that holds it together). In other 
words, in virtual worlds, one's avatar is present or not present, 'alive' 
or not 'alive' - the inscription is coherent, holding everything together 
- but the virtual body is not always there. Teleporting disrupts contin- 
uity for others, not for the avatar 'owner' or the avatar itself. The body 
need not ingest or excrete (unless it is written into the virtual world 
itself); it need not sleep, does not get sick, and so forth. In virtual 
worlds, the body shape may be mobile, transformable, as well.

Problematic issues of ontology of re life: virtual particles, information 
entanglement and conservation, no backup.

==========================================================================

Problematic issues of ontology of virtual worlds: mathesis/inscription -
what is; the world is a world only by virtue of its (visible, sensed) 
manifestation. In virtual worlds, information may be classified, trans- 
formed, and lost - there is always server roll-back or backup. Backup 
implies an epistemological/ontological split between the (visual, aural, 
etc.) presentation of the data-base, and its physical backup - as both 
medium and data.

==========================================================================

Off the map i:

Nagarjuna and Madhyamaka - emptiness and dependent origination/arising. Is 
there a distinction between the ontic emptiness of real and virtual 
worlds? Between dreams, hallucinations, etc. and a concrete or virtual 
'real'? (Various phenomenologies here.) The nexus/ cohering of depending 
arising seems to be radically different between real and virtual; in the 
former, there are causal chains, plexa, Indra's net, and other entangled 
phenomena, and in the latter, there are entangled phenomena, in the sense 
of hierarchical data-bases, but virtual worlds can be split (similar to 
netsplit in IRC), can split apart, can have objects permanently eliminated 
within them (in one region) without undue affect elsewhere (in another).

Off the map ii -

Real life: Think of fundamental ontologies under erasure, Feynman diagram 
probabilities: what constitutes dependency under probability distributions 
- how entangled information should be (ontologically) constituted - the 
status of dark matter, dark energy, the metaverse, additional dimensions, 
branes, other constructs, etc. etc.. How are these inscribed? Are they 
inscribed at all in daily life?

Second life: Think of root originations in server farms, permissions and 
specificities of address. Are permissions inworld or outworld?

Off the map iii -

There is no _fundamental_ physical ontology in the real world: or ontology 
itself, like causality, may be problematic (certainly in terms of subject- 
ivity and inscription.

In virtual worlds, physical ontology is always abstracted, as-if: the 
situation is conventionalist/constructivist, on one hand, and a classical 
mathematical hierarchy on the other. 

Off the map iv -

Mathesis and Badiou's position - relation to mathematical ontology or 
surreal numbers. Is there entanglement between cosmological origins and 
mathesis? Is mathesis the fundamental operation in virtual worlds?

==========================================================================

On the map -

I'm thinking of virtual worlds as abstracted, split, chosen, programmed: 
anything that is programmable is possible. Think of the real world as 
given, born-into: thought as conceiving. Consider virtual worlds _not_ as 
subsets of real life - as fulcrums; consider virtual worlds as the visual 
counterpart of the space of Mathematica.

Again, the psychology, psychoanalytics of virtual worlds: borromean knot, 
matrix, meta-level jumping (collocation of constructing, dwelling-in). And 
in virtual worlds, the body as entangled projections/introjections (jecti- 
vity) independent of traditional physical constraint or representation The 
locus of the body in the physical body (second life as perceptual organ)

Finally, think of the traditional/narratological function of virtual 
worlds as equivalent to cinematic diegesis (editing, jump-cuts, multiple 
viewpoints, etc.) and the non-traditional functionings of virtual worlds 
(above) as processes of dynamic suturing.

==========================================================================

So we cover, however roughly, the mathematical, epistemological and onto- 
logical groundings of real life and virtual worlds: I want to argue that 
this is a basis for being in virtual worlds, a basis for theorizing them. 
In other words, we need not, necessarily, move through either the social 
or simulacra of real world physics; we can start elsewhere, as Being or 
the problematizing of beings, in a fantasm of mathesis. And that may 
expand our considerations elsewhere - from more than three-dimensional 
manifolds, to spaces without gravitation or with several gravitational 
(positive, negative, neutral) fields, and so forth. There need not be 
objects, weathers, plateaus, height from a planar origin - perhaps only 
flows or diffused light, or nothing at all. Nothing need be taken for 
granted: It's all open.

==========================================================================


25c25: The error-sheet

backdrop, perhaps the Madhyamaka backdrop, the problematic of the existent 
choice, but within 1, there are always choices, splits: frames of loci of 
subjectivities in relation to spewing-forth in real or virtual extrinsic - 
produced results leading elsewhere, the result of choice or decision, not 
necessarily an error, but an extension - one finds a con- from the real 
(guided, protected, within the literally circumscribed, nal: operated 
_in._ Immersive: inhabited within the space-time manifold, specificities 
of address situation conventionalist/constructivist.

it's the first and second halves

it's the first half of this, the dancing, that illustrates
the future of beautiful avatars. or the smooth beauty of plants
grown from what appears to be the very youngest of stemmings.
and it surely matters: stasis, in the midst of histrionics.
http://www.alansondheim.org/alldance.mov (with Fau Ferdinand)

it's the second half of this, the bleeding, that demonstrates
what happens to ungainly avatars. or to the segmented animals
hatched from what appears to be one of the oldest of avatars.
or does it matter; at least there's some action here.

New Video Release:

Okukin

Okukin is a short, 9'23" video created from my recent work in Second Life. 
There is a narrative among objects, slabs, planets, voices, bodies, and 
images, some old, many new. The objects themselves have been created for 
Okukin, which is filmed using the Beta 2 Second Life viewer release, in 
order to take advantage of a number of new features.

The video opens on a scenic pouring-forth which changes in a few seconds 
to planet surfaces and constructions which defy the laws of gravity, 
opening on occasion to untoward vistas. The rest of the video develops 
these vistas through symbolism and spoken or sung narrative that tends 
towards a future anterior. The second video is a short test of emissions 
that wasn't used in the final production, but is of great interest itself. 
Perhaps I am becoming too literal; perhaps I am disappearing in these 
works, which always seem on the verge of emergence, but never quite 
coalesce into Being.

I hope to show this work at the June ELO conference in Providence, and 
elsewhere of course. Participants, witting and unwitting, include Foofwa 
d'Imobilite, Blue Carter, Kira Sedlock, and myself. Thanks to Fau 
Ferdinand as well, for the use of the land in East Odyssey, as well as 
Lizsolo and a number of people who helped with scripting.

example of an unsuccessful machine

as no avatar at all can keep up with its furious pace.
really nothing is happening but clever redraws.
julu twine doesn't know that and i won't tell.
http://www.alansondheim.org/mach17.mp4
mach17 because it's going nowhere at all.
the avatar doesn't think there's anywhere to go anyway.
s/he goes around in the very best circles.
s/he doesn't know that and doesn't know much else.
s/he doesn't know there's nothing to know.
the secret's in the machinery doing nothing.
machinery-doing-nothing isn't the same as absurd machinery.
it's machinery that doesn't affect anything but is just redrawn.
as i always have said rewrite is the name of the game.
both game and name disappear when rewrite disappears.
but s/he doesn't know one effect from another if any at all.
in any case the avatar makes a dizzying spectacle.
the spectacle has amazingly few moire or other optical illusions.
nothing at all seems to happen except for rewrite and redraw.
rewrite and redraw are pretty much the same thing s/he thinks.
they're just inscription starting and ending somewhere else.
or they're just a flicker in hir imagination.
la la la, she doesn't care at all.
