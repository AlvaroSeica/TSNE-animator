Omaha talk, (with examples shown) - this is an accounting for
undergraduates with little or no experience with virtual 
worlds. This might be of interest to you as well, even though 
it covers familiar ground.


Why this focus on the body?

We're increasingly living in virtual social worlds, without
face-to-face encounters.

I'm playing with the body in those spaces.

I'm interested in the sexual or the wounded or the pained body
in those spaces - how are these things represented?

Along with this - how can we extend dance and performance and 
the still image through manipulation of virtual bodies?

And how can virtual bodies be returned to the real world?

Bear in mind that the body is always inscribed, always partly
virtual - we carry the signs of our own histories and 
affiliations with us.

So I began to work with virtual characters in text-based virtual
worlds.

And then I switched over to images of virtual characters in
visual virtual worlds, which are in the process of becoming all
encompassing, 3-d - in two ways at least - augmented reality,
embedding the virtual in the real, and Second Life, embedding 
the real in the virtual.

I started to work with mocap - motion capture - in West Virginia
when I had access to the equipment. Everything depends on access.
I had further and more sophisticated access in Chicago, at 
Columbia College. Between these two places, I was able to work 
with modified motion capture files that would allow me to represent
sexuality, wounding, and pain in ways that involved distorting the
avatar body itself.

What I'm showing here, today, are these distortions, as well as 
some of the products that come from these distortions.

The products include dance and choreography, as well as 3-d print- 
ing of avatars, resulting in small sculptures.

The dance and choreography result in on-line performances in 
virtual worlds, which may be projected in rooms like this one, or
may be visited directly by other avatars in the virtual worlds.

All of this is also turned around: virtual world performance can 
be transformed and used by dancers and performers in the real 
world as well. We have some examples to show you.

Finally, there are mixed-reality performances, which occur between
real and virtual worlds, involving all sorts of embeddings.

What is the result of all of this?

Perhaps a better understanding of what it means to be human, to
'be' our bodies as well as to 'occupy' our bodies. 

And this might lead to a more humane future, where we're more
aware of what it means to be alive - really and virtually - in a
world of diminished resources.

It might also lead to an understanding of the politics of living
in such a world, and our duty to nourish it.

what the word speaks about is absence.
the 'about' divides the word, gnaws away from within.
why this distrust of words.
so much sound in 'that exists.'
it breaks or doesn't break with itself.
true humans know this is a weakness.
that sound and words are weakness.
men and women of action speak with their muscles elsewhere.
there's no need to continue on the path 'about.' 
one might say language devours language, no matter.
ceasing to speak means nothing to true men and women.
action is the only truth.
pressure is the only correspondence among things.

Wittgenstein:

Negation is an operation.
An operation denotes an operation.
Words are probes; some reach very deep; some only to a
little depth.
An operation, of course, does not say anything, only 
its result does; and this depends on its object.

words probe only words and negation annihilates emptiness.
negation is a potential for existence in language.
men and women of action know how false this is!
men and women of action, pay no attention!
words are the markings of the world.
they are the scat of the world.
no matter is found there, no gold, not even dross.

Wittgenstein:

The logical pseudo-functions _are_ operations.
Only operations can vanish!
The negative proposition excludes reality.
How can the all-embracing world-mirroring logic make use of
such special twiddles and manipulations? Only by linking 
all these together to form one _infinitely_ fine network, 
to form the great mirror.

men and women of action know that people can vanish too!
true man and women know it doesn't take a proposition 
to exclude!
the great mirror of language reflects only what issues
forth from mouth and lung.
if logic were all-embracing, one would look for the muscles.
muscles come in pairs, that is how pressure is formed.
pairs are always one woman and one man, Wittgenstein!

language in the background speaks to itself, says nothing!
language does not exist.
the hardness of existence is the chapel.
the hardness of existence is the truth of men and women.
the muscles of men and women, their suffering for a higher
cause.
their higher cause, their higher purpose.
their higher cause and purpose is about nothing.
their muscles transform nothing into action and purpose.
_we_ are the action and purpose of men and women of action
and purpose.
their hands press down upon us.
this is the language of the muscle, has no grammar, has
purpose.
to study the purpose of the muscle, apply the muscle.
to study the language of the mouth, apply the muscle.
i cease existence, i cease to exist.
i am overcome, i cease to overcome, i overcome.
i am overcome, i cease to overcome, i overcome.

[Wittgenstein, from Notebooks 1914-1916 trans. Anscombe.]

on the virtual, on intrusions, on signaling and communality

http://www.alansondheim.org/pizzeria.mp4 Azure shimmies oddly
http://www.alansondheim.org/singing.mp4 odder flute and voice
 in high wind while something exploded in the background, big
 emergency
http://www.alansondheim.org/woodpecker.mp4 downy woodpecker
 perfectly poised preening, performing
http://www.alansondheim.org/descentpain.mp4 i suppose descent
 of a tower from which singing and explosion were heard
http://www.alansondheim.org/ethno.mp4 zoo ethnography of
 humans with syringes and field notebooks among animals and

 wind and flag against sputtering sound from flag, sarangi,

http://www.alansondheim.org/jellyfish.mp4 because of the 
 untoward beauty, in spite of the aquarium, without sound,
 no mimickry

There are small shifts in the everyday behavior of men and
women, in the light, in reflections in the sky, in the 
slightest changes of pitch or echoes that appear to come 
from nowhere. magnified, the world suffers, organisms come
to life, things totter, topple, what is - was, what was - is
fast disappearing, what will be - has already corroded. zoo
animals live - are kept alive; the jellyfish remains mobile,
immobile; the flag might as well be a frond from sigillaria,
leaf from neuropteris; flute and voice are already lost in
the mythical darkness of wind and explosions; for a moment,
Azure moves to the rhythm of the corporate and time unwinds;
for a moment, this bird, this woodpecker, here, signals in a
search for food; and for a moment, descent takes the body 
from the wind, and the hollowed rasp of metal stairs takes
over. It is all already gone. It is all built on and from 
the everyday - look, you'll never guess what happened to me
this morning, who could of thought something like that would
occur in the middle of the night. We live among these 
tremblings, not long enough for the grand cycles to mean 
anything more than the flattened pages of history: we have
to read the world in such a small amount of time, everything
is lost, everything disappearing, where we were born is 
never bearing down, where we are headed is all too familiar,
everything trembles, shudders, everything is otherwise...

Bowing

Bowing or bowing, bowing down, playing music, doubled tautness: Already
I want to add something (to the essay, to the sound, to etiquette), of
the object, the bow (tying the hair, playing music, positioning the
body), which is an alteric object, other in any case (culture, viola
case), what one might call 'that' object (in the sense that science is
'that' procedure, phenomenology, ideology), which produces, by a 
certain and constant swaying (ponytail, body, viola bow), a sound that
seems unnatural, manufactured, elsewhere (swish, the engagement of
strings, perfume), in relation to the bending body (proper position of
the arm, chest, ponytail left and right!), setting up a particular 
rhythm (etiquette, fiddling, swaying), in engagement with etiquette
(string tautness and rosin, hierarchy and context, boys and girls),
these actions already so close to the dance (pocket fiddle, twist, 
noh), the whole a motif for the swinging of language (notes, respect,
glances), mobile lexicon and phonemes (singing, giggling, foxtrot,
whispers, murmurs), oh! I've lost the essay (song, return, crying,
ribbons) in the beautiful movement of the bow (ship, viola music,
curtseying, smiles, sashays, readings, writings, essays, assays)
back and forth and playing (bowing, ponytail, viola bow, swingings,
lefts and rights!, ribbons, giggles, smiles, swayings, backs and
forths! ups and downs!), playings!

My mind isn't right.

I stand in the way of the living. I impede the living. I breathe their 
air. I devour the living.

What I've done is all that I'm capable of doing. This is a poor excuse
for life. I'm capable of nothing. I don't dream but have bad dreams.

I am a literary exercise. I use machines to speak for me. I am a factory. 
I am a dirty factory. I am industrial. I spew poison.

To live with me is hell. To read me is hell. I offer contradiction. Am
impaled on the hinge of contradiction. That way I bide time.

My writing is no excuse. My writing is as useless as I am. I am a mass 
of flesh. I think to myself, this mass, this mess. I am a thick avatar.
Closer to death I stand in the way of the living.

I take strong medicine to sleep. I don't sleep. I write. I forget what
I write. In the morning I read. To read me is hell. To write me is hell.

An abyss defines nothing. An abyss falls into itself. I am a dirty 
factory.

Telegraph

The 19th century telegraph and railroad provided the first habitus
for virtual communities. The railroad objectified time and created
the potential for liaisons at a distance. The telegraph workers used
their spare time to talk to one another - friendships and marriages
resulted. The telegraph used a protocol stack reminiscent of tcp/ip
- the layers ranged from hardware to application, with redundancy
and several layers of coding, including addressable messaging
systems, in-between. The telegraph has its parallels in ascii, in
terms of bandwidth; visual telegraphy never really caught on. The
telegraph communality was celebrated in popular literature and song.
For a long time I've been interested in the apparatus itself as 
well; recently in Omaha, I was able to buy a small station consist-
ing of a sounder and key. Soon I'll have a telegraph between my
table and Azure's desk, about twenty feet away.

Brief Synopsis of the Republican Plaform

http://www.alansondheim.org/platform.mp4

Republicans make me nauseous; their apparent takes on race,
sex, fair play, the environment, the 1% - you name it - are 
corrosive, inherently violent, hypocritical. Anyway as you
know, I can't write about this - I don't have the knowledge
many of my colleagues do. So I express myself sometimes in
song and sometimes in video, and this is video. Mind you,
this is the platform of the bad Republicans, those who 
would control our bodies and minds and take what little
health care we have, away. And I think this Republican
Platform video, like the Platform Sutra itself, is full of
joy, reverence, and contradiction! Onward, good Republicans!




the Instrument of music in ground of the room

for Jackson Moore

the Instrument sits there in the middle of the room.
it sits on the side of the room.
the Instrument is immobile, delicate, obdurate.
it's like a body, the Instrument.
it's like the flesh, it meanders, it returns.
it is the sound of someone and the sound of someone's sound.
it is the sound of community, lineage, wood, stone, steel, silk.
the Instrument plays the flesh and the body, it is out of the way.
it is out of the way because it is in the way, always otherwise.
the Instrument is elsewhere, inaudible, murmuring earth.
it is always virtual and is never virtual, it is tethered.
the Instrument is tethered to coordinates, to practice.
the Instrument is tethered to the motions of the body.
to the motions of the fingers, mouth, lips, tongue, arms, hands.
to the voice, with which it begins, with which it ends.
the Instrument tends towards damage, virtuosity, materiality.
one tends the Instrument, a living being tending an other.
recalling stewardship, the instrument.
the cries of the hardware layer, application layer, no difference.
undifferentiated, the earth recalls itself.
overlooked, its sound carries, radio, television, net, ether.
it breathes the ether, inconceivable, non-existent, no difference.
the Instrument returns the instrumental.
in the corner of the room one huddles, the misery of death,
the misery of tending, the misery of stewardship, the misery of
Instruments, the misery of networks, of protocols, of suites,
the misery of nomads -
- the eternal misery of the earth, the escape from earth, 
the escape from death, the escape from miseries, wandering,
escaping -
buried in the network, all of human culture, abjection keep out!
the Instrument is dirty, my muscles are fatigued, 
pay me for my labor, pay me for my Instrument, my tending, 
pay me for my stewardship - here is the secret -
the Instrument has no parts -
the Instrument has no exchange and therefore no exchange value -
and therefore no protocols, no networks, no television, radio,
no net, no ether - the Instrument falls with a thud -
the nomad falls with a thud - 
- sit there at the side of the room -
- at the corner or vertex of the room -
- somewhere on the ground or floor of the room -
- somewhere slaughter begins, in rooms like this one -
- somewhere nothing remains, oh the animals are all dead -
- the plants are all dead - there are still debates -
- lands to be determined - it's all in the Imaginary -
- it's all there - it stays after us - it dies with us -
- networks and netsplits - cracks and rootkits -
- in the body of the Instrument - in the root-body -
- in the root - in the abjection-root and the death-root -
- in the tending-root and the shepherding root -
- in the temperature root and the humidity root -
- in the root of the sun by night and the moon by day -
- cracks in the sounding board, strings rustling, snapping
or strings snapping, rustling, sounding board memories
or fingerboard wear or the sound of a string loosening,
loosening in the middle of the night, other strings 
resonant in unison, other strings murmuring, whispering
there goes one of us, we shall not see hir like again,
someday it will be our turn, someday we too, loosening,
the memory of the Instrument loosening, so many fingers!
so many hands, notes, songs!, so many songs! one among
many, many among one, these coordinates, I will carry 
this forth, these addressings, direct and indirect, I 
will carve this memory, this Instrument, in stone by the
side of the room, in earth by the sky of the room, in
code by the wall of the room, I will carve, I will
continue to carve, constant I will continue to carve,
in the floor by the side of the sky near the ground of
the wall by the corner of the vertex near the sky of
the side of the wall, near the wall, or the side of the

Tracks from the Eyebeam Sound Summit

I recorded the following tracks at the summit; most of it focuses on my 
playing - which might or might not be of interest. The baritone sax is 
Chris Diasparra. The singing in the summit13 is Seth Dellinger, who floats 
in and out. The occasional thumps elsewhere are from the interior of Mary 
Mattingly's Flock House. I played sarangi with Ben Houge's sounds, as well 
as sounds coming in from others on the OSC network. There are two tracks 
based on Kyle Clyde's giant plate reverb unit. I played sarangi, flute, 
viola, cura cumbus, and garklein recorder. On one track, I walk through 
the space, recording and passing what everyone's doing. Apologies for 
emphasizing my own work; Jackson Moore recorded everything, and others 
recorded their own work as well. I'm amazed at the richness of Chris' 
baritone and Seth's singing; on summit13, my speed's pushed to the limit. 
The whole event was astounding! Thanks to everyone, especially Jackson for 
putting this together! (Apologies also if I've missed credits here; I've
done my best of course.)

The original announcement with URLs and descriptions from Jackson -

	On April 21st, Eyebeam's main exhibition space will be transformed 
into a small village dedicated to creative sound research. Using resources 
as diverse as atmospheric sensors, string instruments, reverberant plates, 
magnetized wires, cell phones, data hubs, and laughter, participants from 
Eyebeam's sound research group will convene to run experiments, share 
original research, develop work in progress, and explore collaborative 
strategies.

Interaction, encounter, and juxtaposition will be emphasized over sound 
isolation.the idea being that sound is transparent enough to permit a 
human ecology that transcends the singular focus of the concert format.

Kyle Clyde will test sound absorbancy, sound bleed, and feedback 
thresholds with her giant plate reverb unit.
http://www.kyleclyde.com/

Bernhard Garnicnig will examine the resonant frequencies and specific 
sonic qualities of networked devices.
http://www.acgunsdcroses.com/2011/volumes

Christine Sun-Kim will experiment with strategies for encoding sounds on 
magnetic wire.
http://christinesunkim.com/

Jackson Moore, John Speck, Russell Baker, and Rob Lee will work on a 
melodic pidgin language.
http://www.thelanguageofmoss.com/listen-to-moss

David Reeder's OSC network will turn a ping pong table in Cambridge into a 
metronome in Chelsea, and much much more.

Mike Clemow will be working over the OSC server with a the roving laptop 
brigade, sampling and interacting with the surrounding space.
http://michaelclemow.com/

Yo Park will lead exercises in laughter, with Andrew Sigler, Cigdem 
Tankut, Gulsen Caulk, Gabriel Levicky, Jayoung Chung, Victor De La Cruz, 
and others.

Alan Sondheim, Azure Carter, and Chris Diasporra will revisit the 
discovery of music: the moment when people first began figuring out how to 
make sound with objects. http://www.alansondheim.org/

Seth Dellinger will develop his phonemic vocal music.
http://www.scribd.com/doc/44190101/Introduction-to-the-Beeayboll-project

Ben Houge will construct his auditory kaleidoscope, and provide sensor 
data from the MIT Media Lab for sonification. 
http://benhouge.com/kaleidoscope.html

Amelia Marzec will demo Re-wired, a wearable device that translates 
ambient sound into haptic feedback. http://www.ameliamarzec.com/rewired/

Brian House will sonify his compendium of rhythms from everyday life.
http://rhythmanalysislab.org/about

Mary Mattingly brings us the sound of place: the Flock House living 
system, and its peripatetic denizens. http://flockhouse.org/

With a special surprise from Hethre Contant's Texas Mockingbirds.

The day will end with a public conversation at 7pm.

My beginning foray into my Anorectic Avatars UnderAcademy discursion:

http://www.alansondheim.org/anav.mp4

http://www.alansondheim.org/anav2.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/anav3.png

http://www.alansondheim.org/anav7.png

[ The above are related to Christine Wilks' work with avatar bodies;
What you're seeing are skins of Julu Twine and environs revealed by
the camera's penetrating gaze. ]

I keep thinking about the THICKNESS of avatars and their LACK THEREOF 
since there's nothing there but faces that give the appearance of 
solidity. If you cut open a HUMAN BEING or other organism, you get 
solid/liquid/gas, something or other, all the way down or in; if you go 
inside an AVATAR as such, you see nothing since most likely the faces just 
face one direction - outward. 
 
So a big difference is that when you cut open a real physical organism, 
you create NEW FACES, since FACES could be defined by WHAT'S VISIBLE. So 
there are FACES ALL THE WAY DOWN.
 
Does this matter? Probably not, but I think of edibility, what one might 
eat, and that seems to apply to the latter but not the former. YOU CAN'T 
EAT A SINGLE FACE THAT FACES JUST ONE DIRECTION OR EVEN A SINGLE FACE THAT 
FACES TWO DIRECTIONS since faces are sections of two-dimensional space 
embedded in three-dimensional space, where they NECESSARILY HAVE ZERO 
VOLUME.
 
Eating and gathering energy in THIS UNIVERSE always implies at least 
THREE-DIMENSIONAL VOLUME, if not more. So what I'm wondering - is what 
could we possibly mean by THE THICKNESS OF AVATARS or THE EDIBILITY OF 
AVATARS, and these are not minor questions or irritations but really 
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE IN THIS UNIVERSE, where 
we gather energy, devour things, expel other things, transform things - 
 
Anyway back to the EDIBILITY OR THICKNESS OF AVATARS - so important 
because without this, they're at best PROJECTIONS OR REPRESENTATIONS OF 
SOMETHING ELSE, and we can't have that.
 
So AVATARS ARE ANORECTIC, they DISHUNGER towards anorexia, they remain at 
zero-thinness or do they?
 
So the question is: WHAT COULD WE MEAN BY THE THICKNESS OF AVATARS, OR THE 
EDIBILITY OF AVATARS, IF ANYTHING?
 
AND CAN WE GIVE EXAMPLES?
 
AND ARE THESE EXAMPLES - OUR VERY FUTURE, WHICH IS AT STAKE?
 



What's Left: The Crisis of Philosophy and Thought in the World


(I've been thinking along these lines for quite a while now, skittering 
from one article or book of physics/cosmology to another. Now a similar 
debate is occurring, from Scientific American to the New York Times and 
across the Net. The issue isn't basically the issue of the role of 
philosophy - it's one of our own, human, disorganization as the universe 
appears increasingly alien and unknowable. Do we release ourselves from 
knowledge and its attendant dream of totalization, or do we proceed with 
the development of grander, perhaps simpler, models which "fit" more and 
more awkwardly with the results coming in from theory and experimentation? 
My own work has always tended towards concepts of fundamental or 
background material, however weak such material might be; now, it tends 
towards a releasing that's somewhat similar to the creation of a bunker or 
village.)

It's a wonder we're organized at all, that there are cultural restraints, 
that one can function in this world - such a miniscule part of the multi- 
verse in the midst of inconceivable catastrophic forces that just happen 
to avoid the planet, disrupt the solar system.

Given the multiverse and an eternity of consequences, the one remaining 
goal of philosophy is to consider the relationship of this inconceivable 
to human consciousness - the relationship of increasingly complex theories 
as well, to a comprehension of one's place in the cosmos.

Everything else has been prepared for and the fundamental structures of 
logic, equivalence and identity for examples - as well as the fundamental 
structures of mathematics in general - point towards a platonism that goes 
hand in hand with the physics of the world and its interpretation.

There is no role for doubt in this as well as no room for belief. The 
haecceity of the world is its demonstration; it remains mute, obdurate. 
What can be said is the entanglement of philosophy with haecceity which 
veers from cognitive science to a traditional phenomenology of the senses. 
On the other hand, it's impossible to draw first principles from this, and 
philosophy remains a mode of description, not explanation, or perhaps 
explanation by fiat, by circumlocution in the literal sense.

All of this is also the condition of anxiety; whatever moorings one might 
desire disappear in the digital shifting of analysis and culture. In other 
words, the appearance of the multiverse is founded on enormous holarchies 
of data reaching far beyond our ability to comprehend directly; we rely on 
interpretations of inferences that allow us to filter the inconceivably 
high input we would require for absorption of the raw. In this sense, 
there's an uncanny parallel with looking on the face of a god which 
necessarily remains ineffable: Everything that exists, everything that 
occurs, does so, for us, only on the basis of interpretation. 

I would argue platonically that any logic would unfold the same in any 
universe, that this is a characteristic of mathematical ontology that 
remains identical from one conceivable unfolding to another. One might 
construct, read, and interpret syllogisms variously; the tetherings are 
radically different for differing systems, but the tetherings themselves 
are dictionaries, acts of interpretation, within which tautologies and 
equivalences rule. The Whorfian hypothesis and its descendents doesn't 
hold for mathematics, but only for mathematical cultures; someone working 
in base twelve will have a different sense of the divisions of the day, 
for example, than someone working in base ten. We have to let it go at 
that.

Further, mathematical ontology is not dynamic: It is the background of 
dynamics, which operates through radical transformations that must be 
coherent anywhere on a fundamental level. Chaos and noise are coherent in 
this sense, as is randomness. Think of mathematics as the indeterminate 
scaffolding of the multiverse; think of physics and cosmology as "that" 
scaffolding that fits.

So the crisis of philosophy might be this: That there is nothing to be 
considered or done that is not part of the human, part and parcel of human 
culture. Fundamental truths are relegated as they always have been, to 
physics and cosmology; the rest is narrative and the fear of death and 
abjection. The rest is human affairs. What is human and human culture is 
founded on unsteady and dynamic principles, as well as cybernetic and 
prosthetic ones; it's here that philosophy operates - for example within 
the realms of inscription, psychoanalytics, marxisms, deconstructions, 
multiculturalisms, etc. So we're talking about philosophy as part and 
parcel of the humanities, adjunct to the world, contingent. We're talking 
about it as a moral guide, and as guidebook to the phenomenology of our 
imaginary of our place in the cosmos.

The manifesto appears in this, for example in Wittgenstein's Tractatus, as 
the last gasp of setting the world aright, bridging human and non-human, 
mysticism and atomic statements, logic and philosophy of language. At the 
end what is unspeakable isn't consigned to silence (think of silence as a 
zero-order language with full redundancy), but to the complex equations 
of mathematical physics for example (think of equations as a multi-ordered 
language with zero redundancy). On a basic level we might even write, 
uselessly and philosophically:

[     ] ---> [1 + 1 = 2] 

or some such: The fundamental silence of philosophy is superseded by any 
non-redundant mathematical equation (which clearly, at least here, may 
nonetheless be tautological). (And to get "something out of nothing" in 
fact applies metaphorically to the expression as well, in which case 
"--->" implies that the former leads to mathesis, quantum field theory, 
and the like.)

There is no agreed-upon model of the universe or multiverse, no consensus 
for particle physics or the physics of space-time near the Planck-lengths. 
And we can agree this is a problem for physics and cosmology. What we are 
given, as lay-level consumers, are a confluence of static and dynamic 
images, each of which has different implications for our appetition of the 
world. Each implies a different worlding, a different grouping of intro- 
jections and projections. As consumers on a popular level of high-level 
theoretical work, we look after our consciousness, our positioning in the 
cosmos. And we find ourselves in a continuous negotiation with the real, 
which means a continuous remodeling of our imagining and imaging the 
world. This remodeling takes its toll on consciousness as well; we live an 
existence of fundamental weakness, chaotic adjustments of a popularized 
theoretical "heap" - provided we care about these issues at all. In this 
sense, one might say that the universe constructs a state of anxiety for 
its inhabitants, as model after model takes center stage and falls by the 
wayside. Could we not conceive, after all, of a cosmos without a steady 
model, whose physics are constantly undergoing differentiation as far as 
analysis goes? Whose physics are always tolerance-based, always incom- 
plete, in somewhat the same way that multiverses might be fundamentally 
out of contact with each other? Badiou's truth is not mine; it's always 
already someone else's, always already radically disappearing into a 
chaotic past. This is true for all of us; philosophy attempts a 
retardation of the physical world, as if the dynamics of theory stops in 
the form of an image for contemplation. And whatever truth is, there is 
nothing farther from the truth.

ii

After all the theologies and religious beliefs in the world, is anything 
this simple? Is it necessary to go farther than this? Phenomenologically 
one might consign cosmological theory to the chaotic domain, which is 
capable of interpretation on a graphical level - a level, however, that 
says nothing about the world, not even its shape in any conceivable sense. 
Religion then provides the coordinates; at one point these included the 
Origin, capitalized and under capital. Somewhere Weyl said that the 
Cartesian ego was all that remained of the ego; it's also all that's left 
of a positioning which of course slides out from under us. I think of 
religion in a sense of set theory - beginning with simple principles, sets 
turn out to have inordinately complex structures. And theological-theor- 
etical constructs are, of course, inherently more complex right from the 
beginning - think of Tibetan deities, Christian scholasticism, etc. These 
are also weak, in the sense that these edifices dissolve if belief 
dissolves. There is always a kernel of willing suspension. Likewise, for 
believers the edifices are strong, inviolate, in the sense that edifices 
are constructed through belief. (Think of the Pirke Avot's injunction to 
"Put a hedge around the Torah.") However beliefs lead anywhere their 
content takes them (anywhere they take their content, in paths of logical 
and illogical consequences), even though the basic psychological and 
molecular mechanisms underlying them might be the same. Beliefs build in a 
sense on surplus and psychic necessity. Internally they appear as vision 
and necessity; externally they are similar in their neurophysiology. All 
of this goes round and round, operates as if cosmology itself is a priori 
circumscribed by another set of principles. There is no point to this, 
except for the solace it supplies. Again, the cracks of thought itself, of 
the philosophical, the religious - to the extent that philosophy and 
religion dominate, creating their own internal imaginary of transcendence 
- appear with an increased urgency and sense of violence - as if violence 
were a guarantee of the truth, or meditation a guarantee, or any other 
hardening of and within practice and its austerity. Here, field of 
cosmology itself is at its weakness; it is always uncertain, always in 
dialog with experimentation, always capable of falsification on a still 
finer tolerance level. But that is the nature of the dynamics of the 
practice of cosmology - NOT the dynamics of the cosmos, or cosmos to the 
infinite degree, something inconceivable to contemplate, without the 
intervention of symbolic systems, and a/the philosophy of contemplation.

(The "grand title" of this piece - "What's Left: The Crisis of Philosophy 
and Thought in the World" - implies a crisis for our time as belief both 
hardens and is cast aside. We live within a jitters of thought, because we 
live within and beyond our inheritance of traditional backgrounding and 
structuring of discourse. To think this is to begin to think otherwise, 
but to do so is also to be stopped in our tracks: What if, for example, 
our very notions of existence are challenged by a mathesis far beyond our 
comprehension? What if fundamental ontologies are dissolving in the wake 
of a theorized holographic universe, whose equations are translated and 
retranslated to the metaphor of everyday holography? Beginning to think 
otherwise means abandoning the metaphor, which always contains a kernel of 
belief; it means absorbing the unknowable without transforming it into 
another spiritual or philosophical discourse. I believe (that word!) that 
this holds for cosmologists as well; the unknowable is always with us, and 
it's not simply an unknowable of the cosmological horizon, but one that 
would apply to any description at any time within the cosmos. Hence the 
jitters: We can no longer proclaim, and what we say is always "just about" 
under erasure. This foregrounds death, and a wall for each of us at the 
end of speculation. How to live with death is another story, a local one, 
that might be found at the heart of the humanities. Of course we all know 
that the grand philosophical narratives - that the Grand Narrative - is 
gone; we just haven't realized how deep the erasure goes.)

Drone Experiments

In the following, I played flute, listening through earphones
to electronic tambura. Only the flute was recorded. The flute
is then played back directly or with studio reverb processing
that created a drone directly from the lower flute register.
The drone works psychologically as a 'necessary' base - here,
the result is strange and discomforting.

Droneless Oud


I played Shehata oud with tambura drone set G, pa-SA-SA-sa.
I played this way for 14 minutes. I set oud into the drone.
I turned the drone off, hence 'droneless oud.'
I played for 4'40" without drone.
The drone remained in my memory and my muscle memory.
The oud never lost its bearing but continued with silent drone.
At the end of the universe this may be one of the very last songs.
The drone has disappeared but it continues in wayward and ragged 
music.
The oud continues its 'philosophy of the disappearing drone.'
It plays the accident and death of the drone set G.
Listeners, do not for a moment think that the drone is forever
gone.
Listeners, do not think for a second that nothing remains.
The oud is free in its mourning of the drone set pa-SA-SA-sa.
The ragged oud sings the life and death of drone.
It sings the life and death of the universe at the end of the
universe.
It sings the last song and this is the last song.
This is the song of the drone set G.
This is the song of the drone set pa-SA-SA-sa.

construction ongoing at 3am in the morning next to our place
it's allowed because the city doesn't own the arena
the state owns the arena and circumvents city laws
we got in the paper complaining but that's all
big steel plates placed in a truck and taken away
the db meter read 80.6 through a triple paned window
the sound was incessant and the camera lost focus for a plant
i rather liked the plant and rather hated the construction
i'm running on empty and no sleep and chris is coming over
we're going to play but i'm close to seeing double
maybe play a sarangi or so focus alan focus
maybe make more stuff from the aliens outside the window
maybe shoot the aliens before focus alan focus
maybe set fires and melt the steel focus alan focus
maybe get some shuteye with the usual daylight sounds
there was a thunderstorm but you couldn't hear the thunder
the thunder was drowned out by the plates
maybe lightning will get them and then focus alan focus
big steel plates and focus alan focus
focus alan focus

viola drone

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/809

30 mg of codeine
the viola drones itself
the reverb shadows the viola
the viola emerges from the shadows

the world gives birth to itself
viola and drone are virtual particles
they disappear before you know it
the sound is the memory of sound

in the space that remains sound murmurs
in the empty space there is no sound
the absence of sound is sound
empty space resonates and swells in space

in time nothing is
the vessel of time resonates
no time and no space
viola and drone above the rafters

the time of the drone is the space of viola
the space of the drone is the time of viola

Droned / Drawn / Drowned


oud, sarangi, and jogia sarangi as drone generator
the original piece is removed, the long reverberation murmur
the long reverberation murmurs secrets and unknown tongues
long bells and perfect spheres and untoward, wayward, harmonics
(in droned oud b, the original piece is cut back)

the instruments generate their own drone, drawn drowned
they speak directly to the cosmos
they speak in long-term, terms of sea anonomes and sponges
so slowly, they speak they
they envelop the universes in vac and origin and denouement
graptolites and trilobites
their phonemes are phoneme, their words inaudible word
of sentences they speak nothing, of phrases and words, nothing
they do not come into valley or canyon, they are canyon
haecceity, long gestures of being, ontology
among comings-forth, they are ellipses, so many and one
and many among many, many among one
waters and worlds, fires and plasma, who know, the gods
 know not, the gods know nothing, the gods no nothing 
 of the gods

star captured by black hole

http://www.alansondheim.org/dronepipa1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/dronepipa2.mp3

the sharp onset of the pipa resonates with swallowed data
when placed in the midst of its own drone-skirt, as it
exhausts itself, placed in the middle of inconceivable 
black holes radiating outwards what had sharp peaks, only
to exhaust themselves with the sharp onset of radiation
coolly churning from the middle of the star emanating data
and you have something fundamental in the inconceivable
processes that murmur beneath the drone-skirt, generated
from the interior of the envelope, as if a language came
forth from unwritten texts within the media of whispered
cries and other languagings meandering swiftly through 
inaudible sounds flowing like rivers around the soft peaks




Recent Books I'm In and Why They're Good


Ok, this is a bad way to begin reviews/announcements of some recent books 
that discuss my work (in the midst of others of course); I'm not sure how 
to do this modestly, or whether modesty would even be an issue. For me 
these books have been important because much of what I've done, I thought 
lost; my career is one of constant falterings, restarts, occasional 
moments when it seems as if things are going to turn out well - then more 
falterings, and so forth. I begin constantly; it's only a matter of time 
before I collapse.

The truth is I also like these books for all sorts of reasons, so here 
goes.

The most recent is also the most expensive, Garry Neill Kennedy's The Last 
Art College: Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, 1968-1978, MIT Press, 
2012, around $70. I taught there several times during this period, as a 
visiting artist or visiting faculty. The school was amazing; it had a 
world-wide reputation with people like Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson, and 
Joseph Beuys coming up. There's a lot on Dan Graham and Ian Murray, who 
was a student and catalyst at the time. The book's over 450 pages long, 
large format, and includes a lot of work and statements by the people who 
came through. NSCAD was a kind of paradise; students and faculty were 
given tremendous latitude in their projects, and everyone was treated as 
as valuable, and an artist. Simone Forti, Gerhard Richter, and Michael 
Snow made books for the NSCAD Press. A lot of the energy and genius of the 
place emanated from David Askevold, who headed the Projects class. 
Krzysztof Wodiczko and Emmett Williams and Charlemagne Palestine were 
there. Dorit Cypris and Sharon Kulik were students, Martha Wilson and 
Kasper Koenig were there. I'm not sure of Martha's affiliation. The school 
had a conceptual bent, but this was translated into thinking about and 
through performance, painting, sculpture, and life. These were formative 
years for me; in particular, I owe a lot to David and Ian. I wouldn't get 
the book for me, however (god, what hubris); the totality of the volume 
really shows what's possible in art education, and why art schools - which 
seem to be on the decline (as is art education in the US at least, another 
matter) - are really important in the world.

Along with this, Peggy Gale edited Artist Talk, 1969-1977, NSCAD Press, 
2004 - transcriptions of talks given at the school. Artists include 
Acconci, Carl Andre, Joseph Beuys, James Lee Byars, Dan Graham, Lawrence 
Wiener, Patterson Ewen, Daniel Buren, and so forth - all males, it should 
be noted (which is one of its faults - Laurie for example also gave a 
talk). I'm in this as well with 43 pages of strangeness.

Even more recently than Kennedy's book, Jason Weiss just edited Always in 
Trouble: An Oral History of ESP-DISK, The Most Outrageous Record Label in 
America, Wesleyan University Press, 2012. Again, I'm part of the "oral." 
This book documents the company, which for all intents and purposes 
introduced the free jazz of Albert Ayler, Pharoah Sanders, and Guiseppi 
Logan; Michael Snow is in this as well. Ayler died years ago; the people 
interviewed include Sunny Murray, Amiri Baraka, Gato Barbieri, William 
Parker, Burton Greene, Logan, Roswell Rudd, Marion Brown, Milford Graves, 
Ishmael Reed, John Tchicai, Gunter Hampel, and Sonny Simmons, among 
others. There's a large section on Bernard Stollman, who founded the 
company. If you're interested in free jazz, new music, experimental music, 
alternative-anything, this book, I think, is a must read, along with 
Valerie Wilmer's As Serious As Your Life: The Story of the New Jazz. And 
the music (forget me here) is unbelievable; both books serve as reasonably 
good guides.

Chris Funkhouser has published two books on electronic writing; the latest 
is New Directions in Digital Poetry, Continuum, 2012. There's a section on 
me, for which I'm grateful. This is the best book I've seen on the subject 
- it follows up on Funkhouser's Prehistoric Digital Poetry: An Archaeology 
of Forms, 1959-1995, Alabama, 2007. I'm in this as well. What Chris has 
done, in both, is present the works of a great number of people, along 
with commentary/theory; the writers/poets/artists include David Daniels, 
Jim Andrews, Philippe Bootz, mIEKAL aND, Laurie Anderson, Brian Kim 
Stefans, Stephanie Strickland, John Cayley, Mez (Mary Anne Breeze), Talan 
Memmott, Caitlin Fisher, Sandy Baldwin, Deena Larsen, and many others. New 
Directions is divided into case studies, Prehistoric focuses on history, 
but both volumes overlap past and present. I love Funkhouser's writing, 
which is clear, energetic, amazingly lucid, and really useful for anyone 
trying to follow the roots and current landscape of an incredibly messy 
area of contemporary - what? literature, programming, poetry, thought, 
culture, interactive work, new media? The books are exciting with numerous 
examples.

The intensity of Maria Damon's art and writing is phenomenal; her 
Postliterary America, From Bagel Shop Jazz to Micropoetics, Iowa, 2011, 
includes a section on my work under "Diaspora"; this is one of the most 
detailed critiques of it I've seen. I really like the book for its longer 
studies - on Lenny Bruce, Bob Kaufman, Adeena Karasick, and Gertrude 
Stein. Damon writes from the trenches; she's always in there with the 
people she discusses. There's a warmth to the work, as well as an urgency 
in the midst of the academy - an urgency, that this kind of outre work 
_matters,_ that it matters as a kind of cultural force, that something of 
value is happening on the outskirts (Benjamin comes to mind; he's also 
referenced). I find when I'm reading, today, I'm reading so much of the 
time in the margins (for example, George MacDonald's No End of No-Story in 
Christopher Rick's anthology of Victorian Verse, Oxford, 1987 - which I 
highly recommend), where the scaffolding of the world seems more at home 
and oddly grounded, than it does in any canon or somewhat well-defined 
genre. It's there, that the classical world trembles, dissolving not in 
the usual classical-romantic pseudo-distinctions, but in the realm of 
something utterly something else. And Damon, to be sure, brings this 
subaltern to light.

Three other mentions, all somewhat older - a book on Gazira Babeli of 
Second Life, edited by Domenico Quaranta, fpeditions 2008 - I have an 
essay in it (among several others, including one by Patrick Lichty), I Met 
my Baby, Out Behind the Gaz-Works. Gaz was my favorite artist in the 
virtual world, and it was his work that started me thinking philosophic- 
ally about its possibilities. If you don't know his work (or Patrick 
Lichty's for that matter), you should! The second book is Wolf Lieser's 
Digital Art, Art Pocket, h.f.ullmann, 2009; I'm only discussed briefly, 
but the volume is really excellent, with articles by Mark Tribe, Tilman 
Baumgartel, Domenico Quaranta, and others. Lots of illustrations and 
excellent texts. People discussed include Marius Watz, Manfred Mohr, Ken 
Goldberg, Harold Cohen, Vic Cosic, Jodi, Eva and Franco Mattes, and Gaz. 
Finally, going way back to 1994, Uncontrollable Bodies, Testimonies of 
Identity and Culture, edited by Rodney Sappington and Tyler Stallings, Bay 
Press, Seattle - this is a great collection of disturbed and disturbing 
texts (including a section of mine), by such writers as Lynne Tillman, 
Trinh T. Minha-ha, Leslie Dick, Dennis Cooper, Vivian Sobchack and Scarlot 
Harlot. My contribution was written when I was at a low point, and it's 
all there in the text. Tyler's coming to visit this week, and I pulled out 
the volume, remembering how good it is. 

I've not included any of my own books or chapbooks or magazine reviews or 
interviews - see how modest I am! But I did want to briefly describe the 
books above, since A. I haven't really talked about them before, and B. 
I'm a part in all of them, although often a minor part, and C. for the 
most part, the editors or authors 'got it right' as far as I'm concerned, 
and D. it's comforting finally to be a part of something, to have some 
sort of acknowledgment. I can recommend all of them 'besides me' - they're 
valuable, and good reading/looking. And thanks for reading, here, this 
far.

- Alan
