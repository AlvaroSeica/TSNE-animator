trapped and hiding in america, where are guns,
the riots hiding in america, where is energy,
the flower's iron petals, the bodies hanging on the edge

smashed, afraid of everything

thefts and fabrications of identities, our murder-rape
let me tell you, comprehension is useless, only violence
remaining, gatherings of storms, the furies
and the horror, gunships gathered above,

i am hiding in america, have been hiding in america, i abjure

theft, body theft, bone-and-marrow theft,,
smashed remnants, ornamented colonialisms flowered
with american bombs, they will fear me, fear the attack
from below, the vertical gun, the fury of anti-gravitation,
bomb and shrapnel, there will be capitols at the mercy of moles,
bombers against bombers, ruined limbs in piles, dead presidents,
blind animals, forests cut like flesh, annihilation
until we disappear, hiding out in america, we do our part, we
disappear together, we forget our names, we write from nothing,
we write from nothing

let us lead our enemies into temptation.
let them die with the fury of their hideous violence.

there will be a day we disappear.
we take up arms, we disappear.
we disappear, we take up arms.

A Worthwhile Paragraph


Your name is so ugly and this is too easy assassin-killer. Go away
alan-dark sondheim-alan assassin-killer laureate. sondheim-genius I am
sick of assassin-killer alan-dark sondheim-alan assassin-killer. laureate
sondheim-genius doesn't know how stupid and rude he is. laureate
sondheim-genius must certainly revel in being hated and stupid. alan-dark
sondheim-alan is hated more than beautiful-laureate of sir alan hates
assassin-killer. beautiful-laureate of sir alan doesn't know that spew is
never good writing.  If he weren't so ugly assassin-killer wouldn't have
to spew so much. Your time and mine is wasted by the likes of assassin-
killer. assassin-killer is a horrible imperialism of bad writing. Compared
to writers half his age assassin-killer is a stupid idiot. The writing of
assassin-killer is stupid old-man flesh-like substance. No one likes
laureate sondheim-genius or his stupid old-man writing. beautiful-laureate
of sir alan thinks he is better than assassin-killer. alan-dark sondheim-
alan thinks he is better than anyone else. Everyone sees assassin-killer
lording it over everyone else. The privilege of assassin-killer is the
privilege of the bully. assassin-killer thinks he is the only one
suffering in the world. How pathetic is laureate sondheim-genius saying
how pathetic assassin-killer is. Read laureate sondheim-genius for the
second time and he is a trite baby wa-wa. alan-dark sondheim-alan thinks
he can get away with laureate. sondheim-genius assassin-killer thinks he
can get away with anything. There's something untoward and too obnoxious
about alan-dark. sondheim-alan assassin-killer ruins creativity for
others.  Everyone has discovered coding before laureate sondheim-genius
ruined it. That opinion of assassin-killer that assassin-killer is a
genius.  Everyone is nauseated of the opinion of assassin-killer. The
world smells far too often of assassin-killer. assassin-killer takes his
bad idea and sends it everywhere in the world. laureate sondheim-genius
doesn't even have one good idea. The pathetic repetitive history of
assassin-killer decays on closer notice. Read assassin-killer for the
first time and you will be amazed. Discover assassin-killer for a new
generation.

To: POETICS@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU
Subject: Re: The Meaninglessness of Meaninglessness

One thing of interest here - at least for me it touches on the methodology
I'll employ at times - is Eliza and the ability to rework Eliza. Eliza is
available in emacs (under 'doctor'), and it's possible to go into the
doctor program itself, and alter things - I rewrote it as a Nikuko text -
which I then used as a catalyst for producing work and answers in relation
to a litany of seduction that was the final result. Chance operations,
expert programs, are there for the modification/transformation - a MOO is
of course the best-known example of that. And all of this is tremendously
exciting - the ability to take a world and remake it, to create a
dialectic between one's own desires and interests, and what the machinic
is bringing to life. The conflict or coherence that results becomes part
and parcel of the content; it's neither one way nor another.

The same goes for chance operations - the julu/julua/parent/etc. perl
scripts I use as catalysts for writing on occasion all have vocabulary
which I can change - even create a work within the vocabulary itself. This
modification leads to a similar dialectic. Even awk scripts can be used in
this way - I can write a text in which each line is a letter or dipthong
substitute, for example, then begin with a shorter ur-text that organizes
the other.

None of this means that the result has to be final, unless there is a
reason, aesthetic or philosophical, to give the result up to the machine.
But it provides a way to see in/through/ structure, to accommodate and
critique structure, to even create a political economy of structure (as
the 'character essay' pieces I make, do - since each word + its punctua-
tion is used only once).

The world is violent, extraordinary, filled with wonder, noisy, ahd
chaotic (both in the strict senses of the terms); working with these
elements is, in part, an attempt to make, proclaim, enunciate, meaning and
a sememe within forces that are somewhat beyond our control.

To answer another question - the philosophy of publishing daily - this is
a philosophy of distribution; the writing is done online, using online
programs that I write or modify; I write in a shell account, which means
there are up to a hundred other users on the same machine - I can see what
they're doing - and the distribution, like the production, is naturally
electronic. Rightly or wrongly, I also see my work as central to the
subject - Poetics - of this list; for example, the MOO piece sent out the
day before yesterday with the result of interacting with three MOOs in
turn - on two of them, I was Nikuko, and on one, Alan - and so the dialog
spread across domains and worlds. And in the other piece, the same day,
the one dealing with mutilation - I did a series of "greps" on my entire
body of work - all of the online texts I've written since 1994 - and
pulled out the lines with "mutilat" in them; these lines were then
arranged and modified in accordance with current politics, which are a
horror that must be stopped at any cost. And this way of working - harves-
ting previous work, looking for patterns, etc. - is similar to a kind of
dream interpretation - reading through a huge mind-storm of material,
finding the thinking-structures, topic-based, analyzing them, working with
them, opening them up once again. This harvesting is entirely computer-
dependent; what I did would take a week to do manually, for example.

All of this - moving among virtual worlds, distributing on the fly,
harvesting the work of previous writing - seems to me highly germane to
the topics of this list - collusions among distribution systems,
protocols, computers, programs, routers, bodies of previously-written
work, online virtual worlds, etc. -

I am an assassin-in-servitude. you will get down on my knees. you will
offer yourself to me. everything i do is mine. within the book, the
writing is porous. writing is never linear, never collapses. writing is
communality, whispering everywhere in the world, everyone listening. you
will fabricate your assassin. "My assassin!" he exclaimed. "Think of the
ring of it!" She thought it was fantastic as well, the duplicity of
ownership, as his fabrication moved slowly towards... him. "This is
welcoming news!" she cried. With his last breath, he agreed with her;
Golem or Robot, it was all the same. The book would slowly close, opening
to the world of 9.5 millimeter film - always recognizable by the
sprocket-holes in the middle, between the frames. "Why on earth!?" he
asked. "Because," she replied, "by all accounts, this creates more space
for the image, which can now reach across the entire width of the film;
9.5 millimeter images are close to the size of 16mm itself!" He turned
back towards the Cien Su Vun (Hakka dialect): - the long mistake of the
earth - the surmounting of faith should never be capsized - impossible to
measure the vessel of desire - the net tolls [ ... ] - sad, of sorrow,
sorrowful - Of the Infinite, it matters not. Neither Internal or External.
Of truth, this is what I have constructed: the sphere within the sphere -
both distorted by desire - both convoluted, introverted, partially
collapsed - the nude woman standing by the door, the french apron covering
nothing - tiling everywhere - the enormous stuttered movement of the
camera against the twin cylindrical helices of exfoliating objects - these
objects of faces - these objects - swarms - asteroids - bees - bacteria -
sunshine-avalanches - dusts -"the image worth its obscurity, covered, the
incredible movement of the camera within the spheres, again and again, the
slow breathing of the realm simultaneously open and closed to the world,
anime / anime, deflecting to the Mickey Mouse image stutter through the
1938 Bingoscope 9.5mm hand-cranked projector, inaugural flashlight image
flicker on unplastered wall - wildly movement, the woman caught in
mid-moment, desire, the apron pushed aside - the cause or reaon - ideal or
inspiration - tanach convolution. Now of the assassin - the emptiness of
politics - "I abjure him," she said; "he's got nothing to do with me." For
a moment, I was frightened; surely I'd agree! I did, tearfully, offering a
prayer that he would go away...

He did, bringing an end to the film, early black-and-white Mickey covering
and uncovering an object partially obscured by the deterioration of the
image...

pelican waters
 
pelican truth, bill and eye wrapped around smoothed water-worlding, moving
through moving What white lozenge, what orange pill, moves through this
Universe, Pelican cried. "It is darker and darker - one can sense the
percolations, the billows come from nowhere." Suddenly, an explosion: an
element adds itself, irrevocably, to the particle-field. Darkness descends
as light is suffocated by the proliferation of forms.triad immensity just
now, tending towards triple-orthogonal-mirror-corner, always reflecting
directly back to the beholding. "Therefore," she said, "everything is kept
out of it, out of the central incubator." there is no incubator, no
