"limit notes revisioned

where a function converges to a limit. what is beyond the limit.
*/the singularity ends not as void, not as voidness of void; it ends
in both interior and exterior, embedded and embedding space. the latter is 
of formal interest only; the former may turn in upon itself, present a 
boundary related to stability boundaries (outside of which is chaos), or 
narrow asymptotically, never reading an end as time forestalls./*

construction of works as edge phenomena
*/two types of edge phenomena: dis/comfiture and formal boundaries./*
fields of symptoms, intermixtures of fields
*/structured formal symptomologies, chaotic symptomologies, the latter in 
direct relation to environmental destruction./*
the result given in relation to apperception
*/perceived and unperceived: within or without the interior/*

koan, satori, etc. in relation to edge -
*/as if there were a zero point or its absence here/*
diogenes laertius in relation to zeno - |    |  || - sputtered discrete
into analog at the limit - 
*/into catastrophe at the limit: what happens when both space and time
collapse utterly? compare this to infinite environmental depletion./*

tools, vlf radio */both e and b fields/*
poser and other motion-capture work */now the level of formal exercise/*
extensions of narratives */being there/*
analog/digital investigations: physics, mathematics */failed here so far/*
police-scanner psychotopography */useless to date/* */environmental 
depletion. catastrophic degradation. increase of scanner noise, decrease 
of coherency./*

- talk about geography and consciousness */psychogeography of extinction. 
infiltration of wounded species./*
- universe and consciousness in relation to 'plasma' */destruction of 
consciousness, destruction of universe. neither creation nor destruction, 
neither void nor emptiness. neither fullness nor identity, equivalence, 
identification./*

sexualities */always, limitless, collapsing, extinguishing./*
heuristics */what to do to survive, last of your species/*
languages bodies */no one hears you anyway. no one sees you./*
pathos, empathy, sympathy, defuge */yes yes but for whom. stories are 
lost, it's gone, it never was, never existed, the one for the many stands 
for the many for the one./*

anomalous vlf signals welded together */as if there were still an earth/*

rule-governed systems in relation to consciousness (going back to older
immersive/definable work). what is the _meaning_ of particular 
explanation? is explanation itself a form of the discrete? */does an 
explanation demand a community? bohm's coherency? does an explanation 
demand a species?/*

the system in relation to the carrying-out of the system */the system is 
the residue of the process. the process is the maintenance of the 
system./* 
temporality inherent in the carrying-out */standards, typifications, 
typologies, taxonomies, of temporality in the absence of culture, energy, 
mechanism, stasis, data-storage, species, community, organism./*

irigaray, fluid mechanics - hertz's mechanics. */substituted flux, nodal 
points. hieroglyphics of production. fluids require external molds to 
which they conform. mechanisms my inherently cohere./*

the_limit_ is the discrete mathematization/formalism itself as on the page 
- the limit background - call it the 'horizon' or phenomenological horizon 
- is the immersive activity. */the requisite of peirce's sheet of 
assertion. who manufactures the sheet? what organism? species? where is 
the sheet located? does it decay in the presence of runaway oxidation?/*

immersive activity is vectored, i.e. past-future, however entangled. an 
issue is genidentity - i.e. that constants, what _passes_ for constants - 
i.e. those formal written elements (which may include time as a variable).
*/constants do not exist in a world heading towards catastrophic break- 
points, feed-forward mechanisms hurrying depletion on one hand, the 
exponentially-increasing (but not forever) approach of the planet's 
carrying-capacity on the other. hold to your sheet of assertion which 
becomes a winding sheet; bury yourself in it. you are the last of your 
kind./*

a second limit - that of the apparatus - i.e. bandwidth or perceptual 
limit (of course not equivalent). how to translate the former into the 
latter - i.e. lowering pitch, etc. */bringing what is external into the 
cognizance of the internal. with what energy? nourishment? what liquid 
guaranteeing the survival of the mind?/*

sexual/linguistic limits - how the body is collapsed/expanded (see leder 
for example) - the body's _jordan surface_ for example, i.e. topology 
rendered _diffused_ - exhortations of the plasma. */malnourishment for 
example. the skin dry, sloughed. stitched splits in the skin. wounds. 
shrapnel./*

_discomforted_ boundaries - */watching the approach of death. the 
discomfiture of the unapproachable. it is our human destination, this 
non-absorption, this void always already present, the drive of 
incoherency, loss of habitat. the closed eyes, disappearance of species, 
of this, the, species, of this language, sheet of assertion. of this 
any./*

- and as I read this, I could not help thinking - here is the limit-symbol 
of the thought, the discrete result, preponderance of diffuse movement- 
motion well within the habitus-inhabitation, here it is. */here is 
nothing. here is the waiting for apocalypse. hunger, thirst, heat, loom. 
here are wars, disease, unimaginable weaponry, terrorisms. here at last is 
prophecy./*

- and that these symbols are themselves deep within a potential well, mo- 
mentarily stable, this is what i am thinking, this is what i was */broken 
from the end-point, the was, what you, i, are, speaking and speaking, well 
into the night, spoken-for, this last gasp, tremor, prediction, against 
which all others are absent, against which disappearing measurement, stop- 
ping clock, relativity's errancy/*

language is always periphery
bonded to the surface of a shell's extremity
it's that residue that grants our speech a modicum of efficacy
the efficacious is the real (nyaya)

my writing collapses into substance
it fills the gaps or holes in the shell (the pores)
it's everywhere, stuffing, useless, not even uselessness
it survives perhaps as the residue of capital

the residue of capital is dependent upon the hardness of materials
- and their efficacy
hardness = databanks = memory (of a retrievable sort)
you are nowhere, purposeless data

we can only speak because no one listens (there is no listening)
listening would transform the very nature of the chemical elements
that can't be allowed to happen (it can't happen)
- it can't happen because of the very nature of the world

world, work, and words, perhaps wor/ld/k/d 
worldkd labor of building language, slough of language
this doesn't describe anything, this doesn't describe nothing
high temperatures, high pressures, new forms of matter

mattered scattered among the incipient virtual energy of space
creatures exist among themselves on the other side of dark matter
- for which we are dark matter, they are omniscient, they peer
- we're here, they're there, they peer

they know we don't use language, don't speak, don't listen
- symbolic meaningless surfaces, semiosis doesn't cut anything
- not even action, not the moment
our meaninglessness surfaces among them, they ignore semiosis

allowing nothing in the form of speech
allowing nothing in the formlessness of speech
allowing everything in the form of speech
= allowing everything in the formlessness of speech

unun the darkened matter for which we are the children of light
unun for brilliant matter for which we are the children of darkness
= our shell and our holding on with the materiality of words
= words were never there, we're our shell, holding on (night)
