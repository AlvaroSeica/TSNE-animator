Mr. Wirth

Mr. Wirth, I said, a penny for your thoughts.

Wirth slowly turned in my direction, his face 
blank, whiskey in hand.

Aye, that you should know less than that, he 
replied. Some things let to quieten, I believe.

I couldn't answer. Ever since Wirth appeared in 
the midst of our little group, things hadn't been 
the same. It was difficult to figure precisely 
what the matter was, or to be sure, what the 
matter was with Wirth, but there was matter to be 
sure.

I murmured something about the weather, only to 
be met, once again, by silence.

And silence ruled the little bar on the heights 
overlooking the sea, until I shuffed my chair 
about, and left the premises. The long path home 
beckoned me, and I would be at the worries, once 
again.

a disturbance

"Alan," Azure said, "We can take the lower road." 

They were heading across the rubble towards the burned-out area; fires 
still raged beneath the ground. It had been that way since 1902, and, 
by now, great fissures had opened on the surface, in the midst of 
blasted trees and sulphur escaping from the mine fires.

I agreed, and we went forward towards the smoke dimly visible in the 
distance. The disturbance was clear, was clearer.

(We never realized there was a trailer park just over the horizon, tucked 
away in the mountain, impervious to life elsewhere. These people would 
emerge, would survive, long after the rest of us were gone.)

Credo or The Writing in Quantity

The texts are written by a dead man.
To miss or waste a single day or hour, is to succumb to death.
Every text is an epitaph.
The body of writing is a collocation of epitaphs.
The body of writing is the epitaphic written body.
Writing decays into the semblance of a corpse.
Quantity topples quantity.
Of the talisman, there is nothing to be said.

theyre back

doctor leopold konninger and nikuko are on the floor of the theater. 
theyre naked, theyre always naked. theyre dirty, filthy, rolling around on 
the boards, slight cuts, abrasions. theyre impossibly drunk, drugged, 
theres an audience. theyre fucking but not cumming. doctor leopold 
konningers cock is hard, nikukos labia are swollen. theyre fingering each 
other, sucking everything in sight, the site, theyre mouths. they spread 
each others asses for the audience, pure exhibition, perfect theater. you 
can smell them, anyone can smell them. the dancer comes out then. the 
dancers also naked or maybe wears a leotard which he tears off. he dances 
around them, circles in on them, takes them over. hes getting erect, his 
cock is harder and harder. hes watching them, hes brushing against them. 
theyre taking over by not taking over. theyre paying no attention, theyre 
the ground, the foundation, the material substrate of the world, 
background radiation of the universe. theyre sweaty, slippery, between 
solid and liquid, their faces flushed, their limbs groping. the dancers 
over them, they're beneath him, incredibly beneath him, all the way down, 
the end of the tunnel or funnel. he begins touching himself, hes 
pirouetting, theyre circular moving. his cock begins to drip, its swollen, 
hes moving faster and faster, hes shuddering, theyre shuddering beneath 
him, his feet against them, in between them, around them. his toes enter 
them, hes dancing furiously, theyre oblivious, theyre in their own world, 
their mouths wider and wider, sucking, inhaling, eating, drinking, every 
hole, every limb. hes cumming now, hes cumming on them, he aims his cock 
down at them, theyre coated in him, they rub the cum in, rub it around 
them, between them, in their mouths, eyes, holes, the cock of doctor 
leopold konninger, the cunt of nikuko. the dancer might shudder and halt, 
he might leave, he might stay to see what happens, he might remain above 
them, he might move to the side. nikukos cunt is spread wide and open for 
the audience, she spreads doctor leopold konningers asshole for the 
audience, she puts some of the dancers cum inside her, doctor leopold 
konninger licks it out, places some in his asshole. theyre moving faster 
and faster, the dancer is forgotten, the dancer disappears, theyre 
bruised, abrasions, then also where the dancer pressed against them, where 
his feet entered them. theyre feeling nothing and everything, the floors 
slippery with their skin, with cum, feces, urine, saliva, sweat, theyre 
the color of earth, color of the floor, hysteric, delirious, theyre out of 
their minds. the lights go down, theyve cum or not cum, theyve finished or 
not finished, the smells thick with the audience, they love the dancing, 
love the dancer, his movement they think was masterful, theyd never seen 
such good dancing, it was most wonderful dancing, incredible, amazing. 
theyre wet, theyve cum in their seats, their minds remembering the perfect 
evening, they leave, doctor leopold konninger and nikuko are swollen, 
theyre biting each other, theres blood, theres no one around, theyre at 
it, they continue at it, theyre in the dark, theyre on the other side of 
the curtain, theyre on the other side of the world, theyre doing it, 
theyre never stopping, theyre chafed, theyre torn, theyre bleeding, theyre 
going on.

The Flooding

Flooding, everything out of control. Nunberg's patient got sick while 
there's been a hurricane, flooding in the building, flooding with a huge 
quantity of useless posts, or organs, flooding me with names; still, you 
control my body and it's the result of space flooding me, space 
everywhere, even in the confines of storms of light glinting from years 
ago, star-swarms flooding the sky abject, always melting, flooding one 
with iridescent lightness, the flux symbolic, not the development of 
simulacra, but the flooding of the regions of the world.

Beyond memory is the disgust of the everyday, _flattened real_ flooding 
your panties, liquid running through the theater, anonymous members, but 
the _rain of number,_ statistics for its own sake, cancers flooding the 
body in part or in full, tumors attacking me. Masturbation makes the time 
fly, flooding the lower accesses - flooding in distant wavelets, solitons, 
turbulent steady-states, flooding the world with my murmuring.

Defuge/flooding, cyberspace falters and topples in the sand/granularity of 
organs, flooding me with names; still, you control my body and it's turned 
the matrix of the Net. Thinking is thinning, word-flooding, programming, 
flooding out across the semantic plateaus of participants' time as well, 
timeless and flooding, and confusing to God. She said

" _floating/drowning_ Jennifer, or a _swimming/cresting,_ or a _flooding/ 
suck sexthing is acid hole flooding impossibility where suck /sexthing is 
layers which extend above and below code."

The text itself is flooding, dissolutions of beings, flooding me, I 
swallow all living and non-living, back and back, flooding the world. The 
world is all that is contradicted by the presence of language flooding our 
world; in fact, missives, missions, missionaries - unceasing flooding of 
lapped shores other people jammed into open connections. So think through 
the backdropping, flooding, of communication and you say,

"& soon those memories flooding, that inert event, that signature, 
flooding lands with waters and delights. In this fair world, less than 
that hard sounds, flooding of pulse and body memories - connection is 
rough - packets suddenly flooding through, then apparently dead. Energy 
flooding establishes channels. The world is alan-swallowing, surrounded by 
red-brown floodings, clots, membraned flooding of words by names..."

Liquid air, radio in the pulsing air, flooding our bodies, her voice 
flooding-room light, softenings considering the next smearing of your 
thinking skin. First flooding, my holding is absorbed in my flood 
flooding, my offer-proffer to you, my split doll beneath your binding, my 
split doll and flood-flooding wiped flooding, through the river more and 
more and communalities flooding these very words i write, you read.

Feel these from pure drive of the text, the flooding of hurtling, and 
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects - the 
damp, flooding of the names, things soaking, specters streamed, brilliant 
iridescent wings. Wet-world the first flooding the first runtime beetles - 
antenna - just "in case" - flooding of the names, liquid or their burst 
eyes flooding us with marrow for thought.

Let me tell you that radiation flooding; consider this, the benefits for 
all of us - the end of this secret. Not even valleys flooding or great 
storms would make you flooding and fire. Pairs of breeding falcons might 
make it. Seagulls come flooding of clutter and a-historicity of the 
gathering of accumulations, flooding momentarily within them - stuttering 
within and stuttering, "flooding momentarily within them - stuttering 
within and stuttering."

I'm afraid of flooding; we've been hit before, spewed and flooding from 
the temporary articulation of emission, as the tain of the mirror, fiber 
optics, neural-electronic flooding with teraterabyte messagings flooding 
up. Imagine these streams flooding America, online or offline, body's 
liquidity, flooding or dissolution in the stream of the body's liquidity, 
flooding or dissolution in the stream of up. Imagine these streams 
flooding America, online or offline, the emotional flooding at the gates 
flooding rivers and millions killed. You are living in the bad areas of 
the world and flooding of rivers have stories over your century. A world's 
end flooding millions and volcanos. Killed. Volcanos. Rivers flooding 
millions. Rivers want; your songs are stupid songs - flooding rivers and 
millions killed.

MUD. a flood nothing red really on on flooding and blood, smeared with its 
flooding from oozed afraid whirlpool. Does not the night beneath the 
flooding or flood of food, the flooding none, the symbols of the north, 
loop chunnel and dangers of flooding. If flash flooding is observed act 
quickly. Move that emotional flooding at the gates. There's been a 
hurricane, flooding emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter 
and part-objects emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and 
part-objects - emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and 
part-objects - emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and 
part-objects - emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and 
part-objects -

and organs, flooding me with names; still, you control my body and it's 
all I reach for in the morning . A lid appears in the sky, heavy with 
viscous fluid, coating, flooding the names, soaking of things! My holding 
is absorbed in my flood flooding, my offer-proffer to you, my split doll 
beneath your binding, my split doll and flood-flooding. Wiped, flooding, 
do you mean to me? - And through the river more and more and the matrix of 
the net. Thinking is thinning, flooding of words.

Writing of the Third

The writing of the disaster, catastrophic submergence, refugees in the 
midst of horrendous poverty and ecological catastrophe without an edge 
there, see there's a catastrophe coming - and another friend - and a third 
who worries me...

The catastrophic: you can even write about it. She recovered from the mine 
catastrophe. News radio stations report catastrophe, announce the time, 
the delicate imminence of possible catastrophe, I, godlike in America. We 
are born of and around the catastrophic. The extras remain outside. You 
brush your hair, i beg you, kill me; i beg you, kill me, kill again; i 
walk on catastrophes: what tropes.

The face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, the null 
fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship beginning and ending with 
ground zero, the null fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship 
spreads, just as body-parts turn to sintered humans; chemical catastrophe 
at the top down through radiations blinding accumulation. The disaster of 
the _square._

The writing and its brilliance should survive any catastrophe, outshine 
its translation, survive any catastrophe. Sickness was a catastrophe about 
to happen, with the factories dumping, catastrophic disappearing wavering, 
shuddering, the grasp always

[ when nothing shall prevent catastrophe or disappearance
when nothing shall prevent catastrophe or disappearance ]

Within the catastrophic, there is always the grasp. Towards catastrophe, 
give me nothing. And I have designed the model with catastrophe in mind, a 
task. the wave collapses into chaos, catastrophe, words blunted by 
catastrophe of hysteria, dissolution of the mirror stage. The train in 
overdrive spilled beyond capacity. You are in motion capture, motion 
capture catches the catastrophic.

Disaster (catastrophe) depends on (is caused by) the accumulation (of) 
emotions and life, motion capture catching the catastrophe. Speak when 
nothing shall prevent catastrophe or disappearance. My lovers, I rely on 
anomaly, forgetting and meandering, wryting and poesis, catastrophe and 
hypertext - our catastrophe-theory of knowledge. Tattoo; the classic 
manifolds of catastrophe theory; lampshades from the catastrophic. What 
tropes, the face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, 
the null description and the problematic starting, the fold, you can even 
write about it.

At this point, that would be disasterous. So we talk about other things, 
they ignite and explode. A disaster for those who mourn the passing of 
each big flood, natural or not. _Naturally,_ then, the only thing to 
expect is the unexpected, the appearance, curtailed and shut down by 
disasters, oh not so far, the disaster averted, shutdown unnecessary. The 
misrecognition _to be sure,_ violation fabric, more murders, earthquake 
disasters threatening the whole thing down. What can any of us do in the 
face of the disaster that is looming

Disasters, train wrecks and car wrecks. I find myself under their wheels, 
Oh, such language is a disaster! One tiny fire clear-cutting them, walking 
the line of disaster.

Places keep a million disasters a day from happening. Lots of 
encroachments, disasters of free trade and environmental damage, enormous 
encroachments in some sectors, In 1961 I almost flunked out of school. My 
life was a disaster. The disaster takes care of everything. One disaster 
is another person's pleasure.

Disaster brings totality. Totality brings disaster. Disaster of totality. 
*****images wouldn't transfer, flashcard went dead. 'Natural disasters,' 
latent hurricanes, human activities. From above - accumulation - evil has 
either the one or the other, a disaster, back to modernity and disaster 
(catastrophe) depends on (is caused by) the accumulation (of) famous 
moanings of the bar, portents of disaster for ships leaving a harbor, a 
disaster, a site disaster, as in

[ site disaster.
disaster.
disasters. ]

"Lives were lost everywhere in disaster after disasters. (public room) 
learn (review lessons) carefully disaster (catastrophe) What disasters 
await the collapse of hard-drive memories?"

The desire for death. And a desire for life, the disaster that goes on and 
it is about the disaster. It is about the disaster of spent fuel spending 
spent fuel, about the disaster of death which is only the retardation of 
life, about the site disaster.

Forever we pour the ghee through the body of the disaster, forever we ride 
and write the disaster of the body and of writing, the species in full 
"bloom," red tide, and disasterous. I act the labor _I do_ and it has its 
own difficulties, a disasterous surface, I am a node on the Net, the 
disaster of protocol itself, long ago. The elders lure the young into war 
and other disasters - words - but the talking journey ended ago. Elders 
lure young war disasters, these times are close to the final { these times 
are c|ose to fina| disaster, that there is no escape from to disaster to 
sme|| its ... }

And disaster and disaster, that there is no escape from scraped know|edge 
and sites, kmnnpababramadisasterszzxj kmnnpatraburada

And disaster averted, shutdown unnecessary.
Silence greets the disaster.

most of the jellies and slimemolds are from this area
coral fungi as well, as well as slimes, rots
some people entered this space forever they found paths behind anything
they might think about and sooner than later the thoughts also stop

the people don't know that ( about the thoughts stopping )
to them it's just eternal slowness
they might realize that but it wouldn't matter i can say that
i still remember the paths and shuffling
life shuffles there are polypores as well of all sorts
and hawks other things even less visible
they have forgotten why they are there and the world is very calm

Ice Storm


How beautiful and deadly thou art,
cycles of ice hanging like deadmen from trees
breaking the limbs, crashing down onto highway 80
onto highway 940, the bus turns around in shame
at loveliness and murder

How murderous thou art, deadly as well,
making old trees making way for new trees green growth
branched crashing on streets and super highways alike
turning vehicles around straight dead in their tracks
staring at loveliness and murder

Jews


I am losing friends over this. I reach states of no return over this.
I respond poorly and unfairly. I'm tired of thinking of myself, 'Jew,' 
and listening and watching 'Jew' return in guises I don't recognize.
Needless to say:

Jews did not leave the World Trade Center just before it was hit.
Jews came to work that day like everyone else.
It was not a Zionist conspiracy.
Jews did not cause the Tsunami.
Jews went through the Holocaust which killed a lot of them.
Jew, Jew, Jews.
Jews do not want to slaughter Palestinians.
Jews do not have two navels.
Jews do not have horns.
Jews do not control the media.
Jews do not control the daily content of the media.
Jews have never eaten Christian children or killed Christian children.
Jews do not run the United States.
There is no world Zionist conspiracy.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Most Jews are not Zionists.
Most Jews are secular.
Not all Jews support Israel's internal or external policies.
Most Jews are not religious.
Jews do not have more money than other people.
Jews are not stupider or smarter than other people.
Jews do not control the World Bank or world money supply.
Jews are not sexier or unsexier than other people.
Jews do not harbor gold.
Jews most likely have as much and no more sex than other people.
Jews are not 'clannish' any more than Chinese, Arabs, Germans, Italians, 
or Wasps are clannish.
Not all Jews believe in God or a God, and at least one rabbi I know is 
atheist.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jews did not steal Judaism from Blacks.
The Jews did not run the slave trade.
Jews are no better or worse than any other people.
There was and is no Eternal Jew or Wandering Jew.
Many Jews protest the policies of Israel.
Jews whine no more or less than other people.
If a Jew thinks Israel has the right to exist, that doesn't make him or 
her a Zionist.
Not all Israelis are Jews and not all Jews are Israelis.
If a Jew thinks Palestine has a right to exist, that doesn't make him or 
her anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jews do not have big noses.
Jews are not gutter people and don't belong to a gutter religion.
Most Jewish women are not Jewish American Princesses.
Most Jewish men do not wear yalmukahs or go to synagogue.
Jews are not bad people.
The Protocols of Zion are a forgery.
Jews don't conspire any more or less than other people.
There is no world-wide Jewish conspiracy.
There are no local Jewish conspiracies.
Jews are not anti-Christian or anti-Islam.
Most Jews read the Torah as a historical document, and very few believe it 
literally.
Very few Jews statistically are religious.
Jewish men do not menstruate.
No, Jews don't whine over anti-semitism.
Most Jews in the United States intermarry (at least this was true a few 
years ago).
Jews do not smell differently than other people.
Jews do not stink.
Jews are not dirty.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jew, Jews, Jews.

Most of this is self-evident. And to be honest, it cripples me to write 
this. I hear some of these things over and over again. They're on the Net. 
They're in the streets. They're in the newspapers. I tended to ignore 
them. I'm writing this to clear my head. There are people who liked me who 
no longer like me. When I defend Jews, I'm called a Zionist or obsessed 
with anti-semitism. I'm neither. I want in fact the discourse to go away. 
I'm more concerned about anti-semitism against Arabs, even in the 
neighborhood I live in, in Brooklyn. But I can't let this go. It scares 
me. It preternaturally scares me. A son of a Holocaust survivor I know is 
frightened it will happen again. I don't feel that way. I watch what this 
sort of rhetoric does to me. I don't like it. I don't recognize myself in 
it. I don't think it should occur this late in the game, this 21st century 
of human barbarism. Be it known the Jews are no more or less barbaric, 
strangers, than other people. Be it known, I can't escape my heritage, the 
culture I was raised in. I don't want to pass or have to pass.

ma mere, 1947

yes yes yes
she was quite a gal in her time
ma mere ere ma mare
arare arm
in these dark times it is well to remember our love
of our family and everyone about us
hello hello we may never have this time again
hello hello hello

1947 continued
http://www.asondheim.org/figurestudy.mov
she was all a woman and more
she knew how to flaunt it and knew how to haunt it
it came and went she posed for cheap photographers
if there was an internet she would have made a million
she lived for 8mm and she lived well
god bless the nation that bore her

explicit sexuality
you've never seen anything like it
it isn't there
http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov
i told you it isn't there
it's too revealing
don't even think of it
http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov
it's the most amazing thing explicit and absolute
some of us ah well i've already said too much
you'd feel you could take us anywhere at all
http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov
the degree of arousal is amazing
you'd know us inside out
http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov
nothing at all there's nothing there at all
i told you nothing's there don't ask again

1934 1947
someone hated the films spliced them together
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
someone with someone's mom or dad
i can't tell who who would do these things
whatever's going on it's miserable and exciting at the same time
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
were these things common then one hears about the 'trade'
people would be taken to strange places and people would have cameras
women and children disappeared so did adults for other reasons
or adults for the same reasons on the other side of things
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
i'm afraid of thinking about such things did such things happen
is anything happening maybe my mind is tricking me
the couple is in a play or a theater or a brothel in new orleans
i'm not sure it looks like new orleans something from new orleans
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
the splice is poorly made perhaps a way of saving things
things happen that's all these things happened years ago
i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid

soon we'll be working on the format again, the precis again, the language 
again, the mandate again, soon we'll be working on the narrative again, 
the story once more, the beginnings and endings, the midst of the middles, 
the assuagements and appeasements, sooner or later we'll be working again.

The man and the deer demonstration text for WVU


The man went into the forest looking for deer. He didn't find very much,
because he spent very little time there. Nothing came to mind. He had a
gun with him and it was very good for the deer that he came back without
any dead animals. He and his wife were very poor. La la la, what to do!
What to do! There was no food in the house and they would soon starve
to death. But they knew there were other folks in the town and soon they
all got together and ate one another and that was the miserable end of
the man and his wife because they were the first ones to be eaten. The
moral is probably to shoot deer or shoot yourself, it doesn't matter much
to God or anyone else.
