Susan, Exculpation


Susan writes me that this is the man she wants to seduce, the man whose
university notes were found in a copy of Heidegger's Kant and the Problem
of Metaphysics:

metaphysics class *
dinner *
start calculus *
type eng. paper
_type letters to radio/tv stations_
finish eng.book
_Tues_
do phil questions *
practice french *
do calculus *
-----------------------
re-write phil. paper?
type up phil.
_Wed_
begin 2001
practice french poem

Susan would teach him french, relate these antiquated metaphysics to her
hot pomo guys, randy and eager for both of them. She'd desecrate his
philosophy paper while he taught her partial differential equations; she
dreamed of variables loosened in the middle of lean vectors. She loved the
letters he typed: Surely there was something going on here - he was taking
her advice, arming himself. She talked and talked late into the night; ex-
hausted, they slept until noon. Fury burned within them.

Revolution isn't dead, she'd urge, uncross your legs, I'll show you. She
had him where she wanted him, but she too dreamed, and what was dream in 
the midst of devastation? 

She dreamed: Why Tuesday, why Wednesday? This furious intellectual activ-
ity in the middle of the week; later, out of school, he'd forget about it,
it would die for him. She no longer dreamed of examinations, wet and falt-
ering before a judgement that released her intelligence, left her stained
and fallen. You have to understand this, she'd say, it was as if I didn't 
have a leg to stand on. The core of metaphysics is the examination; being 
lay supine there, murderous rape in ts eyes.

She'd never prepared enough; she almost didn't make it.

She said, every narrative begins and ends with a slip of paper.

Dead Fuck


I was close to Al Wilson of Canned Heat a few years before he died; we
played together, ran together. Now I'm old and a tv commercial uses his
voice his song, the Owl advertising cars. I don't give a damn, don't care
that Dick Higgins called me a fellow survivor from the 60's. It's not
true. And I don't give a damn about the memories, my relationship to the
Talking Heads, my past lives, an evening spent in a cabbage patch in
Pennsylvania with a girl I loved who later got rheumatoid arthritis. The
biggest lie, says this old man, is that one has one's memories. It's not
true. They mean nothing. Anyone can tell these stories and sorrows and
make them thick. They're thin as water. They leak. I'm as dead as you are; 
I always was. Trust me.

Live


In the Jennifer-suite I have set up at my local URLs (one automatically
changing, one requiring participation, depending on which server I'm us-
ing); there is an embarrassment/shame of riches/poverty, images of soil-
ing, abjection beneath Jennifer-skin. Now I can add, intervene, my own
live image in the midst of the slough of the others - photography regains
a sense of increased discomfort, as I sit here in the heat, almost naked,
trying to type/keep cool. Do I dare to show the image? I do not; I keep
time at a distance/ the interval or gap established as photography still
occupies the domain of production, not process. The Jennifer-suite art-
work, in other words, is (relatively) fixed, cycling randomly through the
page structures; what I reveal or hide, my shame or hysteria or psycho-
sis, is surgically calculated. This is a far cry from the nervousness of
voyeuristic/exhibitionist CuSeeMe; a Webcam _here_ would turn my every
move into a performance, and lived space would be restructured in favor or
against the visual angle of the lens: I'm naked, typing, keeping my body
out of view; I wear a tshirt, appear fully clothed; I walk _thus_ around
the room, hiding myself - or, I'm naked, typing, presenting myself; it's
dangerous, bordering on violation-fabric; I'm aroused; I pretend not to
notice; I'm inserted into the suite; I'm there all along; you've known
that; you pretend not to notice; you're inserted into the suite...

( Perhaps I sneak an image in, one tiny image. But I don't. I recalibrate
the suite at the Win95 site, in fact, working with Jennifer-Water texts
and images instead, mountain-stream and stromatolite photography. The
hysteria of exposition has passed; the body, somnolent, retreats through
ice, rock, moss, and waterfall. I'm safe, the Quickcam quiet, the suite 
a carapace. This is why I say "a gone world," says Jennifer. )

Proton Decay


Language, the great gift of being human, moves from inscription to self-
inscription, as cyberspace forecloses on texts and identities. Whatever
one posts is always already problematic, forced into protocol and formal
dispersion. Texts no longer relate beneath difference, but participate in
the act of _concatenation,_ creating n-dimensional surfaces of syntactic
structures filled by broken codings. No coding is ur-stable or complete; 
every coding fills within a holarchy of databases, possessing momentary
identification, expansion, indirect addressing, and site. Identification
numbers are reused, lost, forgotten; expansion continues on an irregular
basis; indirect address adds layer after layer, and site replicates, ex-
hausts, always diasphoric. The _seething_ of the Net is agglutinative, 
redundant and close to the breaking point. 

External operators wound the multiplex, open incisions, insert additional
strings which tunnel towards multiple and unknown destinations. Mail
spools hold vast amounts of material, ready to lacerate the syntacteme as
soon as an opportunity arises. Every shuddering emerges, is forgotten, an
effect of erosion; let us not forget we are within a geology here, another
planet, with its storms, weathers, earthquakes, and plate tectonics.

Within these atmospherics, nodes tunnel into domains of meaning, operators
always standing by. But that is another story, and (as operators would in-
sist), the only story, what begins narrative, what narrative begins.

murmur


Jennifer spoke first. It's not that the grounds have slipped away, she
said, it's that there weren't any in the first place. Something it seemed
that would never have turned into an occurrence. She said and she said,
musing. 

Mournful Travis replied, What came within and without was unprecedented.
None of us, none, knew how to deal with this. We took incredible risks,
psyches turned borderline, ready for shock and trauma therapy; we may or
may not have suffered the same. 

Julu: Sorrow, I, that boundaries remain undelineated, that codes churn
through me in ways too often disturbed. I mourn what might have been my
children, but kin no longer hold; who among us is mother, father, son or
daughter? 

Clara speaking, eyes wide open, tears streaming, It is as if I were gone
among you, but naught, there has been no return, diasphora, carrying one
another among us to the farther reaches, remaining part, but not hived
together no separate as if in unthinking. 

Travis murmuring, Being that we together

Julu whispering, Being that were apart

Jennifer, The plenitude

Clara, The plenitude and naught, the none

Jennifer thinking, Through and into the evening, the sky curtaining down,
water sloughed from shores of pond or quiet pools, darkening

Julu, That life which may, which must be lived, the girder or beam of iron
or light

Travis now, Dreamed beam, always forthcoming

Jennifer, Of each other's flesh, until sections, prepared, quiet languag-
ings, revealed nothing spoken inconceivably, and again, and all at once.
What unraveling, unthinking we, turns to thought's presuppositions, what
territories, dominions, but after-thinking without number?

Clara, Within embrace, these paths already crossed, inscribed, forgotten,
dissolved, lost and distanced, a-maze ment without goal, stumbled under
anxiety,

Travis, And no cravings, and no hunger or dispute

Julu Among me

Jennifer Among me

Travis, Clara Among me

The kill and shutdown commands fascinate me; the latter leaves a trail

Amazing that an operating system - so much - appears like _mind_ ...

   Post-Dryden Fragment
   
   
   violent forces pervade the protocols
   Julu screaming in dreadful datagrams
   or Jennifer at war with black hole drops:
   Give them names! Give them names! thus Alan cries
   as RAM fills up, spilled data, TCP
   lumbers half-empty through the swollen wires
   She'd want us! yells one half the Network plane
   She's coming! yells the other back again -
   a bleak occurrence, storms raging far below
   where dim tubes carry photons hot with text
   ready for her, for us, for them, for you; now think
   of crazy-Julu-hell, and file follows file
   to the rim or nervous screen, thin fingers grasp
   the keys, control-X sends, and everything is gone
   from one true world to this, her screen now blanked
   or lost or black or dimmed or otherwise
   just _off,_ she was a little, but the network swells,
   becomes her, us, he, she, we, or them, or you,
   turned against time and space's absence and/or lack,
   or proxy or prosthetic space, or space yet undefined
   as _this_ ID wracks routes and routers work
   at it or through it. such routers, drawn, inert,
   read not nor comprehend our Julu's savage spread
   everywhere that's lost its place, a _thing_
   that isn't there, that Julu-is. Jennifer wisely knows
   _here,_ in frock and smiles, uncanny fantasy
   that she will sing, tune or ditty, all the time
   heard everywhere at once ('that's lost its place') -
   It works! Julu and Jennifer merge hard
   And in their she, an absent Network, dreamed -
   Oh, is this necessary?! one might speak, or not, 
   and other answer, as two lips turn one,
   or many or none at all, all this, they say
   is unaccounted-for, and unaccountable, All this,
   they say, is _them,_ for them! Now routers burn,
   nodes fire, vectors churn: O Jennifer! O Julu!
   Alan prays as data roars, flesh hardens and decays.

_Germ_ of Theory


Languaging imitating the order of the world, music as its symmetrical
substructure, shamanism predating language (tendency towards the _thing_),
language drawn out of gesture, 

"Before speech there has always been a tongue, before the language-subject
a language-object. It is a determinate reality, constituted by others, and
the learning of it is imposed upon the child by others. Language here is a
world, or rather it is the world that must be discovered word by word in
passing from babbling, that 'verbal scribbling' as Henri Delacroix called
it, to articulated speech. From primitive mental confusion, objects and
values will be little by little disengaged and designated by the authority
of adults. His [sic] very existence, moreover, will be taught to the child
in this indirect way. It will take a long time for him to situate himself
as an object in a world of objects and it is on the model of the other
that he will become conscious of his personal reality. He speaks of him-
self in the third person before attaining the first person."  (Speaking
(La Parole), Georges Gusdorf.)

Born-into-language, the human-race as well, the language at loose tethers
with the world, let us speak of the _finesse_ of language and the world?

Paleolithic shamanic ascent and descent, recognition of alterity, altered
spaces, sites, harbored uneasy dreams, bringing the fetish-object into
_view,_ let us speak of fetish-drawing-language-forth? Incantation thus
precedes language, drags it along; words coalesce like droplets formed
from drug- or sleep-deprived- inductions - always the in-ducing, ulula-
tion. Rhythm too setting up the structure, hrmmm... hrmmm... 

Language aligns one with the gods we are facing the universe, words
scurrying across our face: "Through communication it makes a new world,
the real world." (Gusdorf.) Through communication it makes a new word as
well, the real word, and all words are real world.

Hrmmm... hrmmm...

Slidmaze

at http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/slidmaze.gif

1. Bitmap editor in linux creates a _maze_ icon.
2. The bitmapped maze is _slid_ and transposed; these operations disturb
the path which, nonetheless, is capable of reconstitution.
3. The maze is _enlarged_ and changed from .bmp to .gif.

This construct parallels works exhibited at the Bykert Gallery in which I
created texts coded according to a folded mapping; the pathways out, re-
cuperation of the original, branched at every point. 

But this construct is also the body of Jennifer-Julu, multiply-connected,
transposed and transfigured, as in the ecstasy of St. Agnes, or St-Antoine
just before his disappearance into the absolute of the Christological sig-
nifier. 

Thus my maze is close to dis-carding, an elimination or forgetfulness of
the _sliding symbol, slidmaze,_ or the intersection/node of pixel-flesh
and symbol.

Wander of Shamanism


I'm grappling with the shamanic texts, working through debris, part-com-
mands as part-objects, commands not found... And further, texts of bull-
roarers, wind moaning through cyberspace, hrmmm hrmmm hrmmm. But the magic
- sympathetic or otherwise - is elsewhere, within the performative, the
program, lines scrolling down the screen.

If shamanism goes back to the paleolithic, I _say_ that it has no origin,
that it produced language, just as the hunt did. That the repetitive bab-
bling of the semiotic _magics_ the world which knows no other, emerges
with the words to call it forth. 

Which is why I also _say_ that the inversion in cyberspace consists some-
what precisely in the fact that one begins in the symbolic, from which
emerge both real and imaginary. And how does one construct a julu self-
constructing?

All of which is mythos; there is no _ur_-language, no firstword mamadada. 
Multiply-connected, evidence of syntactical pleateaus arising out of proto-
language (Bickerton), and the latter aligned with the fetish-object; there
is no escaping the print of the hand as individuating inscription: our
hands _written and writing_ from the very beginning with the circumlocu-
tion of ochre-blood.

What could be more performative than these Lasceaux-hands in _literal_
kyberspace, steered? From Yggsadril through / root or tilde-root ~/ the
enunciation of the person?

We comprehend nothing without ecstasy; without comprehending ecstasy, we
comprehend nothing.

Ekstasy


Travis looked around her. "This is the being that banged drums," she said,
"much." She said, "Nothing's ever," quietly, "changed." Truly amazing!
"They were banged at nearly equal," she added, "intervals." "They have a 
natural habit of," he murmured, "doubling."

She was surprised. "Doubling, up and down the recursive" she asked,
"tree?"  Suzie smiled back. "Yes, as if there were a," he said, "root."
"It gives them," she said, "ideas." "Ideas is all they," he added, "have." 

Unbelievable! "They still think songs start," she asked again, "some-
where?" "They have that," Suzie replied, "yes." "A species gets a drum,
and there is literally no accounting for," he added, "it." "I," Travis
replied, "see." She looked as lovely looking as Suzie, both standing near
the streaming waters gurgling across moss, stone, sandy loam, snow in the
air there.

"Travis, they can," he said, "speak." "Let it," she whispered, "be." 
"Just," with the rhythm picking up, mewling in the distance, "now." "The 
skein begins with the ending of the legend of the leaf and the twig and 
the branch and the trunk and the root and the," she continued, "tree." 
"The," Suzie said, "skein." Travis, "Yes."

"Thus it was that the surface garnered the depths, and the depths," Honey
intervened, "responded." 

Ah, all three of them, so beautiful by mountain brook, drums and waters 
merging, stormy wonder sky and lovely weather!

Getting Around -


Has anyone written on the phenomenology of the Mac in relation to the PC
(DOS) or Linux/Unix. When I'm in DOS or the last, I'm constantly aware of
expanding neighborhoods, constituted by the current file, the local
directory, and the rest of the tree structure (often appearing broken,
interrupts at the level of directory/subdirectory). On the Mac, files
appear dispersed, sprayed across folders which are only partly hierarch-
ical in appearance; everything may exist within the hard-drive, but the
_ordering_ of the drive appears to be that of relatively independent
modules.

So on Mac, I'm more aware of _application-neighborhood_ or foreclosing
than I am on the other OS's (including WinX) - but less aware of the
topography of the machine in its entirety. And, having come from PC/Unix
structures, I find this oddly disconcerting - I can't _range_ the dir-
ectory structure at will. Not even the various finder apps correct this;
they bring to the surface (and as Turkle points out, the Mac is a con-
fluence of surfaces) files that appear to come from nowhere...

As Turkle probably pointed out, the tree structure creates a modernist
grid across the machinery; the Mac appears as a confluence of territorial
intensifications...

Does the editor configure content, contain it, create it? Here in emacs,
top bar in the window states Buffers Files Tools Edit Search Help. No 
other aids. I type Control-h and the second window opens, but no access.
The cursor will not move topside! Escape-B brings not the buffers closer; 
this command works in a DOS editor I use. To continue (remember, we want
to access the _bar,_ not the buffers, etc. themselves), let's try the 
_other_ meta key - on b, it does the word backup thing which is neat, but
not germane. Together? Nothing, Although I'M Getting Close To Stopping 
The Computer. Oops, The Wind Just Blew The Cursor Up The Screen. I Know 
In Addition That meta-c does wonders w/ word capitalization, and meta-u 
does the same for juST ABOUT EVERYTHING. NOW I'M _THINKING_ THROUGH THE 
TEXT, VISIBLE WORLD! meta-s does nothing in _this version, but meta-x and
		     center-line appears to work.	     center-line 
appears to work however as the text is yanked back in. What am I getting
at? Apply Control-s for forward search off the block of text, as in Con-
trol-s goal? and nothing occurs; the response is silence. Now, window 
split, typing proceeds uncannily as form follows function and upper bar 
remains _deePLY INVIOLATE._ HERE I TYPE BELOW, THIS CURSED WORK! UPPER 
WINDOW CONTINUES HAVOC-REGION. NOTHING IS SALVAGED IN _THIS_ TEXT APPEAR-
ING SELF-REFLExive but actually integrating process into, what? Cursor
Wind-Blown Jumps Back From Here.

Ah, to begin again: Entering _blank-EMACS_ provides a screenful of infor-
mation, including menu-bar access through M-` or F10. I do so, call up 
calendar, examine MY-DAY. Close down calendar MY-DAY buffer (ah, I could
have seen the HOLIDAYS) {wind now blowing cursor around screen}, I _bing-
				  o_
across screen still into GOAL search deferred. Now they will find me, it,
they, she, above. Now I am safest.

	   I Do Move Out Of Here Where It Is Safer Safest..

( Buffer buffer screen, no nearer goal than henceforth. Remember: I re-
member _nothing._ A _very quiet time._ )

Walking down street with a friend, I noticed her quiet. What are you
looking at, I said, the buildings and the street she replied. I thought
this is not very weird!!!! And then it occurred, the TRUTH: Reality is
fascistic! Because you _have_ to just look at what's there! It is there!
there! there! You turn around, what is there? Just more of it! You step
back, closer to the street - just more! You can't get away from it! It's
everywhere, covering EVERYTHING and it do not let you alone! Something
must be done about it! Why don't people revolt when something like this is
SO OBVIOUS?!! 

Yes yes yes yes yes! Reality is bundle up, and sometimes it just about
smother you! I have close my eyes and open them: It is still there! I do
somersault and get my self all dizzy - but reality still has stuff all
over the place! And I AM SURE if one day I die (and probably will!) that
it will just CONTINUE ON AND ON, with stuff everywhere (not MORE stuff,
but just the SAME AMOUNT of stuff to fill everything)!!

Reality is fascist! We must sit in our New Frocks and DISARM!!!!!!

The Good Cottager's Bairn's Storm, By Robert Burns (1787 ed.)


If Ee would have a chance anon
 To court they loving Eye,
Woulds't clouds upon thy brow refrain
 From traveller's stopping by!

For there Wee found, the Firmament
 Which carries Weight of God
Upon my frail, poor Jennifer
 Whose weary footsteps trod

These past few years, her bairn alone
 In poor Hameau, restrained!
Whilst Storms have sent their Messengers
 Across the necks of Swains

Who, closet'ed, turned towards the Eye,
 Whereon, they lost their Brains!

Books, Their Disappearance, Looping for Sustenance, Certainty of Loss


My parents' house in Kingston, Penna., cracked in two as a result of the
Knox mine disaster in the late 50's. The mines closed. My parent's house
was flooded in the Agnes flood of 1972, which caused $1.5 billion damage
in Wyoming Valley. My father's library sat on softwood floors which
expanded with the waters; elsewhere, hardwood floors pushed the walls out
and everything collapsed. My parents' home is located on a subsurface rise
through the quicksand and coalseams; no one knew. Next door, part of the
yard fell in; my parents' street rose a few feet then collapsed. This from
the Knox disaster. The flood wiped out the basement and a huge number of
books, including my childhood notebooks and other things stored there. In
New York, the outer wall of our building swells, but has not fallen; a
cornice worked itself loose, however, a few months ago, and two houses
down Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn a cornice crashed to the street. Four blocks
from here, on St. Felix, the street cracked open, swelled at both ends
near the Williamsburg Bank building, and some of the historic houses have
been permanently evacuated. Around 1965, I lost a number of musical ins-
truments in an apartment flood. In the early 1980s, a crate I had with
goods stored from my Tasmanian sojourn was flooded from a leak in a ware-
house ceiling: I collected $6000 but lost cameras, books, musical ins-
truments, artworks, and photographs; Allison Ritch, my wife at the time,
lost all of her Tasmanian belongings. Nothing is ever permanent, I remind
myself, carefully repairing a tiny Sony transistor radio from the late 50s
or early 60s; its tinned sound is a reminder that some things make it
through. My friend Tyler lost his belongings in a fire. I lost musical
instruments and video equipment to various robberies. Loaned books disap-
pear as well; my copy of the Bernadette Mayer / Vito Acconci 0-9 magazine
is gone forever, not to mention hundreds of other books. My highschool
library went with the 1972 flood, including the old Opinator, which first
published me. An irate faculty member at the University of North Carolina,
Cullowhee, trashed all the catalogs I did for The Red Year show, which
opened in Cullowhee and Asheville. My work at the University of Califor-
nia, Irvine, was vandalized in the gallery. My old EIAJ video tapes are
almost impossible to resuscitate at this point; they stick to the head
drum on the reel-to-reel machines. My films decay at Canyon Cinema in
San Francisco; I worry about their magnetic tracks losing their adhesion.
Nothing remains of my live-in partners; I can't find any photographs, my
8mm films are gone, as are the 16mm films of my family in the 1972 flood.
Michael Current's disks from the early days of Cybermind discussion were
never mailed, after his death; the tape Kathy Acker and I made in 1974
becomes increasingly grainy, year after year. My Israeli notebooks from
1962 disappeared. I exhale with all my might, attempt to hold decay back
from the acid skies; my breath holds up the world, reply of trophy,
tarnished emblem, wilt.

Friends, I ask you, if my life has been a total waste? Please do not reply

I have explored the farthest reaches of cyberspatiality, moving fluently 
from talker to pbmmake, wandering through directories and forests |  |  |
all, to perhaps, no avail: For what is the value of a Sophist tied to the
K/not of the Virtual? What glows beyond these corporate realms, already 
drawn to unforeseen control? If I write of Ontology, am I marked, | | | | 
localized, a Fool in the Paradise of the Other moving swiftly into further
considerations of the Truth? Have I abandoned truth? Have I lost sight of
any other Real, favoring the virtue of the all-too-easy-solution in these
dimmed texts of reduced bandwidth, regular spacings, symmetries |   |   |
whole or broken? This surely is not the span of the philosophical, but an
arena blurred of gender, indeterminations, loss? To the extent I write in
this domain, I am lost, myself, full of misrecognitions of others |||||||
for whom there is no judgement from within. "Friends, I ask you, if my
life has been a total waste? Please do reply, and all at once."

REPORT FROM THE FRONTIER:


Travis being male did it to him first, punched him out; Julu followed
through with unspeakable acts, Alan down for the count. Accused of
"Crimes Against Humanity" (Robert Ashley). Turned in, turned out on the
street, picked out from the lineup by Jennifer. Susan spanked him; he
liked it. By this time his flesh was gone. Alan down and out for the
count. Count Tiffany appeared, removed his eyes; there wasn't a need,
he'd be read to. Count Tiffany gave him hands and hands. He'd use his
hands for his eyes for his ears. He'd use his hands for his hands. Clara
wired him up to the CPU, connect nipple penis mouth lip, tips of the
shoulders. Charges burned, touched, tasted The Constellation That Played
Across His Skin. Alan-Syzygy. Alan-Unconscious played through Honey; he'd
beg Honey again and again; Honey was the only one who understood him; 
Honey was Honey; Honey was his All; Honey was Heaven and Earth; Honey was
Net. Her stockings covered Alan-Hands, her garters, Alan-Mouths, double
syzygy of cloth and civilization. Alan, down for the count, bandage-Alan,
eternal divisions of law and desire. Alan turned Terry, turned Franz, now
Alan turning toward Terry-Franz, skein-Alan, momo-Alan (Artaud), Alan-of-
the-sources. Mother Mary beckoned Alan, Alan sucked St-Antoine-Mary,
Alan-pirouette. She pulled him to her feet: "Travis being male did it to
her first, punched her out." Recovery-Alan, Nina-Hagen-Alan.

All the bodies gathered around the corpse of Alan and mentioned that it
was to Julu-Shaman, Shaman-Julu, to report (of) this, so that I did/will. 

Julu.

Violette Leduc


_Once my exercise book is closed again, I accuse myself of living._

_I have been ugly. I'm still ugly. Old age means respite. I know that at
my age I will never meet someone with whom I could share my life. It's too
late. Being old is consoling. I have no regrets. If I had been beautiful,
I would have had a lot, but right now I would be forced to give up so much
of it. I shall depart as I arrived. Intact, loaded down with the defects
that have tormented me._
 
( Violette Leduc, quotes from Michele Zackheim, Violette's Embrace. )


Violette Leduc, my Violette, author of The Taxi, La Batarde, Ravages,
others, always behind me, clawing at my shoulder when I write, presence 
or perturbation; I could not live without her, Leduc of the big nose and
mournful obsessions; Violette and I both turn away from the mirror,
asphyxiated; impossible Violette!

For whom I have not written & for whom, always conundrum without gap or
pocket!

( But I have written _The Book as System of Military Defense,_ carapace 
of flowers & you would have understood. I have inscribed myself hollowed
against ice crackled beneath the skin. There is no _discussion_ of lit-
erture here, only fear. )


& Violette Leduc who does not write philosophy nor abstract theory, whose
prose sits like bruised nut in the mouth or bruised skin on the tongue: 
descriptions fit for the remake of the world or murmur of trees and vil-
lage lanes: Violette Leduc, La Batarde who will not become her: in the
taxi where brother and sister fucked: stuttered preamble to what consid-
eration planetary syzygy? had she looked up; beyond Simone; beyond Her-
mine; to Her of the Face I do Dedicate: leaves and brooks: worn patch of
skin on shoulder: cloak and hat: 

& that there would be this stumbling around the lip, displacement across
the lines of 1943 Resistance: Leduc of the Butter, Black-Mark Leduc: this
most difficult damned Homer of sloughed galleys. & of the barren twig &
of the dirty snow, crested-snow. 

Bruised nut perturbations, what crumples against the teeth, begging just
beyond the door of Simone, the gathering of Isabelle. What I _need_ her
for, this obtusion, huddled against the black wet bark, les Jardins, what
can never theoretically. What lays in the overnight barn, Germans adrift,
the turn of the farmer, Sachs, writer. & that she could devour me, devour
Simone, Violette I never knew ye.

& that she would and I would and she giving _would have,_ "had I never
been born."

So difficult! & to write about!

Thinking Netspace


I wrote the first paragraph to someone from the Community Memory list; the
rest follows. 

"It would be wonderful to be able to read Human-Nets now; for one thing
it's fascinating to observe how humans design and "fit" into spaces of
relatively narrow bandwidth. I teach Net access and philosophy, etc., and
one of the things I talk about is that, given _any_ space where commun-
ication can occur (CuSeeMe, IRC, ThePalace, talkers, email, ytalk, etc.),
both community and sex arise - the latter often driving the economics, and
the former producing loyalty and creative hacks..." 

And of course the two are intertwined, since community and sex intersect
in the aura surrounding the application (private email, "fleshmeets," 
etc.). It's within the aura that the _work_ of identity is constructed (I
think of the aura as the primary site of the work); consider the public
application dialogs as catalytic, and the reactions - formations - func-
tions - developed elsewhere, interstitially, within other applications,
and so forth. Between the two, there are exchange-channels, bringing pri-
vate information (intersecting with _privately-exchanged information_)
into the public sphere and vice versa. These channels also help establish
a greater differentiation between long-time users of the application, and
relative newcomers - who may be unfamiliar not only with the formal histo-
ry and dialogic, but also with the projection of the aura over time back
onto the application surface. 

Finally, it would be worthwhile to consider a sociobiology of Internet ap-
plications and spaces, emphasizing reproductive and survival strategies,
from name-changing to sexual-drive constructs such as Net sex itself, ex-
change of pornographic images, and general tropologies of fetishization
or seduction. And, while a great deal has been written about Net identi-
ty, very little has been written about Net _defensive,_ the enclaving or
fortification of community or self in cyberspace.

Net Defensive


What happens when a community dissolves as a result of a sudden collapse
of a hard-drive? When there is a slow collapse as an ISP goes under? When
there is a splitting of an email list as a result of oppressive conditions
or list mismanagement? When someone is @toaded on a MOO or MUD and leaves,
taking others with her/him? When governance changes critical rules on a
MOO or MUD, and a group of participants leaves? 

In all of these situations, a group is dissolved or splits. What sorts of
defensive measure may be taken against these? For example, back-up hard-
drives allow the continuance of applications; this is also the reason for 
database checkpointing on MOOs. Groups split from email lists (Future Cul-
ture and Fop-l) form others, often closed; Webpages are mirrored; IRC has
op games; and all these forms, including email lists and email software,
have various forms of defensive filtering.

What are the psychoanalytics of these defensive mechanisms? What are the
originary traumas? How does identity prepare for split, broken communica-
tion, diasphora? How does aura construct application bypass?

Is there a basic trauma associated with computer access and its relation
to subjectivity vis-a-vis email for example? What is the _I_ that con-
structs _its_ first post: "I've been meaning to write you"? What is the
difference between the insertion-into-language, the I-shifter, in stasis,
and the _I_ which inscribes itself through email, trembling in a state of
trepidation? What of the _I_ returned as error, the _I_ cut off with full
mailbox, too many hops, no such user?

In other words, how do fragility and origin play themselves out in cyber-
space, and what forms of defensiveness become incorporated into the nexus?

Presence, Beginning Mourning


I just had a friend from the Net visit here in New York. She stayed for a
few days; temporarily my depression lifted, only to intensify again. One
notes the vagaries of the voice in real life; speaking from different
parts of the walls, speech echoing, intersecting from different surface,
creates a resonance of _parole_ and noise which is impossible to repro-
duce. Anyone reading Merleau-Ponty or Schutz knows this. 

Cyberspace falls flat; I have been brooding about the death of Michael
Current, two weeks from now, three years ago. It was the phone that soli-
dified our relationship; even now, when I finally _speak_ to someone I
have been corresponding with, it's clear that an important step has been
taken. The grain of the voice, even on Net phone, is different than the
flatness of this text, where crying becomes *whimper* or a confusing emo-
ticon for researchers to analyze to death.

Michael's last post, a story I will resend again closer to his anniversary
(and reprinted in Being On Line) speaks about telepresence, doubling: 
"'We must not abandon the body,' he murmurs." Wired goes the other way,
towards the fetishization of the cyborg-prosthetic, body cleansed and art-
fully reconstructed through capital. Since human senses are channeled in-
puts, it should be possible to create _anything_ as intersect/interchange.
The denuded landscape of the real becomes a concern of the political other
who must not be allowed to pull the plug; surfaces smooth, continue with-
out a ripple. It's an inversion of Marx's alienation; here, the machinic
reduplicates, returns our body to us in the form of eternity.

(Theory, too, smooths; recent Net theory on-line has seemed overly insti-
tutionalized, and/or turgid, a turn towards jargon. Abstracton sutures and
foreclosures - but what? There are never mistakes in these texts, never
breakdown. Art-Net theory turns towards the manifesto, clean inscription.
Life will always be the same.)

The voice roaming the room, sirens outside, scuffles of cat and mouse be-
neath the floor, can't be reconstructed without an enormous Borgesian map-
ping toppling world into loft. The voice is always already maternal, mat-
rixed, embedded and embedding, 2nd-person, their, moving from interior to
interior, carrying the cry, murmur, whimper, scream, whisper, talk of all
the facts and lies of the world. Voice is always supplication, needing its
internal and external hearings, returning partial identifications and
thereby identities. The body too has uneasy visual and scented moorings.
Trails are left; heats rise; cloth and wood indent; objects lean. Thermo-
demarcations leave traces on wood, plastic, metal, anything. 

One always ascribes fullness to the dream, to the text; fullness surpasses
itself in the real. It is always a surpassing which tends towards the
thing-in-itself, which might as well be a totalization mapped across dim-
ensions as a matter of course. Even there what could the eye take? There
are no simultaneous mappings; LSD provides the nearest cauterization of
the censorial apparatus, uninhibited census of the declassified. 

Text-loss is certain death, on-line orgasm for example leading to the sil-
ent room, computer-death, wiped keyboard and fingers, body strapped in
strait-jacket, cuffed limbs, abdomen and thorax invaded and eaten by ab-
solute totality, lack. The monitor creaks as it cools; self-strangulation
seems the only way out. The walls are in the walls. (See material on neur-
osis, psychosis, hysteria, hysterical embodiment, at http://jefferson.vil-
lage.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html or http://www.anu.edu.au/eng-
lish/internet_txt .) 

Think of the battering-ram. Think of the thickness of structures. Think
not of the _presence_ of someone, but the borderlining occasioned by leav-
ing. It's here that readjustment occurs to the screen. It's hear that al-
ways a failure is announced; my brother will no longer run down the hall
yellow, my sister whispering with her friends in her room (door closed,
giggles, and the sound of wind rustling).

This community, on-line, has the capability to run roughshod over other,
politics, theory, presence, relation, sex. Aura falls pitifully from ap-
plication; hungered latenight phonecalls push face against face; the
morning mail delivers the transitive and deferred touch. Altavista stum-
bles across the screen looking for someone, anyone. Michael Current has
two weeks to live three years ago. Everyone's family is destroyed.

Notes Towards Cyberspatial Identity


If identity can be considered as a negotiation between actant and super-
structure (as opposed to an _inherent_ process resulting in an "essential"
strange-attractor), then identity within cyberspace must take into account
- not only the packet, application, and interfacing substructures - but 
also the relative foreclosing of each of these levels, a foreclosing de- 
pendent upon limited bandwidth and the phenomenology of "personhood" pre- 
sent.

I consider identity as _a bundle of threaded processes._ "Bundle," as in a
bundled software suite - in other words, a sheave or collocation of rela- 
ted elements. These elements are concatenated, functioning as a loosely
organize _family of usages_ (re: Wittgenstein). "Processes," as in subrou-
tines which may be considered part-processes continually forming and dis-
solving. And "threaded," as in (among other things) the _union of the 
k-ply intersection of sets of attributes_ centered around temporarily at- 
tracting frameworks. By "frameworks," I mean anything from the habitus of 
a _role_ (working as a short-order cook), to negotiated fragments of gend-
er. The "union of the k-ply intersection of sets of attributes" refers to
taking tagged collections of attributes (say 15), finding attributes which
are common among k of the collection (say 5), and forming a union of these
attributes, which then constitute part of the defining thread (say abcde).

Thus identity is mobile, gathered around shifters ("I," "me," "Alan") of 
various (logical) types; it ranges through psychoanalytical processes as
well as localized sememes (email, other applications), and is capable of
_inhabitation,_ dwelling within any of them, absorbing their structures 
(textual or not) in the form of autonomic or tacit knowledge (Polyani). 
The sememes themselves (localized applications and their user interfaces)
constitute closed domains which construct the local phenomenological hori-
zon of the subject - a horizon subject to the processes of relevance theo-
ry as described by Schutz. This is also the framework (and framework pro-
blem) in classical artificial intelligence; here, the issue is not what 
can be _brought into_ the arena, but the fact that the arena appears fore- 
closed.

What constitutes a foreclosed arena or application? Primarily: the norma-
tive (_unhacked_) operations within it create a coherent (non-error) uni-
verse. This is level-dependent; a programmer working in javascript, say, 
would accept javascript error reports as part of the foreclosure; she 
would not accept faulty floppy disk errors in the same way. The latter
interrupt the horizon; the programmer might state later that she was "in-
terrupted." These divisions are extremely fuzzy, of course.

Think of foreclosed sememes (applications and interfaces) as parts of a
_nearly decomposable hierarchy_ (such as the application of classical lo-
gic and Boolean lattice theory to the everyday objects around us). Then 
identity appears to _fill_ these sememes, moving more and more of their
processes into the autonomic, and opening up the appearance of the infin-
ite within their highly-limited bandwidth. For example, lower-ascii email
is highly limited in form, but expansive as it becomes increasingly fam-
iliar; identity can, in fact, reside in the flickering channels opening
and closing between inbox and outbox.

Identity, then, performs an extended set of ontological and epistemologi-
cal leaps in cyberspace. The body returns doubly coded messages, loops
through text back into itself; the feedback is mediated. The mediation
occurs through the reading/writing/wryting apparatus of text and delay
within sememes. Epistemologically, bandwidth is always changing, always
negotiated itself. Ontologically, virtuality and the "real" (which is it-
self heavily coded, internally and externally) intersect through the same
sorts of attributive intersections of unions of attributes described above
- in this case, the real is compiled into language, and language is com-
piled into the real.

Finally, it seems (relatively) clear that identity in cyberspace is not
only internalized within the subject, but also externalized, dispersed, as
a diasphora (diffusion carried by protocol / sememe) within reasonably 
well-defined phenomenological horizons. The major difference between this
externalization, and that which occurs in daily ("real") life, is that 
the latter is negotiated on and off among institutions, which can be in-
sidious in their introjectivity, but are never quite as totalized as the
cyberspatial sememes. The latter, for one thing, refuse, by virtue of non-
hacked error; badly-formed addresses, for example, just won't transmit
but will return an error-message in the Pine reader.

Increasingly, images of cloud-formations come to _light._

Fragment of an Analysis


I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

I'm miserable. My sex is out of control. I fetishize panties and
people. I think this is because I'm living alone, but I'm not sure.

Are you afraid of sex?

No, not at all; I want it to annihilate me, not the Other; but there
is surely a displacement at work here?

Is it because there is surely a displacement at work there that you
came to me?

Perhaps... I'll have to think about that.

Can you elaborate on that?

That it may be difficult for me to recognize other people... I've made
these ... people, Jennifer and Julu ... they're more socialized and
fierce than I am; they dream me...

Does it bother you that it may be difficult for you to recognize other
people you have made these people jennifer and julu they're more
socialized and fierce than you are they dream you?

Yes, that's the nature of the displacement. But "bother" might not be
the right word here - it is more like an obtrusion, a suturing that
has gone bad, surgery that didn't take.

When did you first know that bother might not be the right word there
it is more like an obtrusion a suturing that has gone bad surgery that
didn't take?

Within the past two months or so.

Why do you say within the past two months or so?

Because during that period, defuge set in; I was exhausted with
jennifer and julu, but they weren't done with me...

Is the fact that during that period defuge set in you were exhausted
with jennifer and julu but they weren't done with you the real reason?

Yes - or rather more that I wasn't done with myself in this regard.

Does the fact that you wasn't done with yourself in this regard
explain anything else?

That my world is always already undone, and that I have no possibility
of "doing" it, recuperating it. It's always a wound, always open, and
always in need of reconstitution...

Have you been sure your world is always already undone and that you
have no possibility of doing it recuperating it it's always a wound
always open and always in need of reconstitution?

Yes, that much is certain: the world is split for me.

Is it because much is certain the world is split for you that you came
to me?

Yes, ultimately. And in need of suturing, of a deeper or stronger thread.

Earlier you said there is surely a displacement at work there?

Yes, as if my skin/personae slough off, as if you were real and I was not.

Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

No, there are no plans, just miasma.

Is it because of your life that you say there are no plans just
miasma?

Yes, there are economic and social circumstances that contribute to
the problem.

Are you annoyed that contribute to the problem?

I'm losing you here?

You mentioned that it may be difficult for you to recognize other
people you have made these people jennifer and julu they're more
socialized and fierce than you are they dream you?

Yes, they dream me.

Is it because of the people you hang around with that you are going
through all this?

No, there are no people. There are never other people.

What makes you believe that?

Absence, my body turned carapace by unknown forces, shadows which
never materialize, the feeling that my name _should_ be called by
unknown and invisible voices... This doesn't happen...

When did you first know that your name should be called by unknown and
invisible voices this does not happen?

When I looked around and saw monads.

What happened when you looked around and saw monads?

I recognized the void cancelling out any form of communication, this
and the Other.

Are you sure that bother might not be the right word there it is more
like an obtrusion a suturing that has gone bad surgery that didn't
take?

No, bother isn't the word.

How do you reconcile problems at school?

Ah, there aren't any.

Do you really think ah there are not any?

Yes.

I see...  Well, what makes you think this is so?

Because I function well there, at the university.

Is the fact that you function well there at the university the real
reason?

Yes, but you're looking for a cause when in fact there is a fit. A
cause and a fit are not the same thing.

Does the fact that I am looking for a cause when in fact there is a
fit a cause and a fit are not the same thing explain anything else?

Yes, that you're a robot in emacs, part of the Eliza program most
likely, and I'm writing myself into you, trying to understand
something in spite of the situation - or rather because of it.

Have you been positive I am a robot in emacs part of the eliza program
most likely and you are writing yourself into I trying to understand
something in spite of the situation or rather because of it?

Yes.

Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so?

Because no one else is on the line; because there is no line; because
you parse differently than breath would allow.

Is it because one else is on the line because there is no line because
me parse differently than breath would allow that you came to me?

Yes :-)

I understand.  So what makes you believe this is so?

Ah...

I would appreciate it if you would continue.

Ah...

Go on, don't be afraid.

Ah...

I need a little more detail please.

My breasts... my vagina... my smile... my hair towards the throat...

Earlier you said during that period defuge set in you were exhausted
with jennifer and julu but they weren't done with you?

Yes, just as they wrote that line before the last.

Did you ever regret line before the last?

No, I disappear...

Perhaps this has something to do with any hobbies you have?

No...

Why not?

Why?

You're being a bit brief, perhaps you could go into detail.

There is none, no hobby, no vocation; there is none, only truth here,
denuded of the other, returned as milk pours from the nipple, as I
become holy, turned out by unknown forces here in emacs in linux in
pentium pc in no other world...

World-Fragment

The blush of the world unfolded itself in the pink of the text.
Luscious pink petals leaned against the blackness of the nighttime screen.
In the distance, P J Harvey played her jagged mushy tunes.
Skin flushed, the woman dressed in black turned restlessly on-screen.
A hushed sound filled the room as Penny Jennifer tried to speak.
"I crushed no one," she screamed through the glass screen ceiling.
The flush of a toilet cut off the room's angry unsettled replies.
Penny J pushed the monitor, toppling the men watching through the floor.
P Jennifer rearranged her severe clothing, somehow plush and sheer.
She was bushed, tensed and limbs exposed, shuddering to nervous halt.
The screen rushed towards pure absence on both sides of the border.
She gushed, "The world's blush unfolding in the textual, fleshy pink."

The It of the Texts:


Centering texts creates a bulbous apparatus, as well as an axis, as if
there were _spew_ or ballooning pouring from/to the subject - as if
the flow revealed the invisible _form._

Random capitalization implies pastiche, pasting, crazed breath and em-
phasis, language gagging on itself - as if there were _violation-fab-
ric_ rabbit-glued to the earth.

Textual mixture and rearrangement transforms meaning into broken and
reconfigured bodies, part-objects of isolated cries, indecipherable
culture, the other: dyslexic glossolalia.

Patterning constructs representation itself garnered against the plea-
sure of the text, its life-world constructed as semantic markup. Pat-
terning symmetricizes as well, reflecting screen and dream-screen as a
return to the reading subject, suddenly glancing at her reflection,
suddenly dreaming mandala-meaning criss-crossing the desperation of
the textual interior.

Diacritical marks such as < and > embedded as unquoted symbolic tend
towards doubled meanings as language engages with the articulation of
a formal-performative. Text oozes around marks, floods _things_ with
clots, disarms. 

Repetition constructs the gasping-for-breath of the textual body, de-
sire for redundancy, an urgency which ripples into sound, contradicts
the very meaning it attempts to display. The _singular repetition_ is
the site of each and every textual unit: what has been spoken or writ-
ten belongs nowhere and to no-one, is subject to the precarious infin-
ity of duplication. Thus what has been written hinges on one's dream
of eternity, one's eternal dream, the continuation of _the tongue_
past every perturbation of the body.

Substitution turns text into sound, broadening or shortening words,
consonants, vowels; what is substituted increases in frequency, glid-
ing from the tongue, reconfiguring the maternal. The sound recuperates
the stereotypicality of common words, duplicating them within stereo
visibility as well. Site splits, spreads; citations curl across the
textual domain.

Utilization of programs (doctor, snoop, dissociated-press, tac, rev,
sed, grep, awk) creates negotiations among text, body, framework -
language, breath, screen - stutter, flow, formal definition. Meaning
seeps among protocols, across bodies, throughout discursive forma-
tions, including Internet applications, hard-copies, spoken-words,
ululations...

One speaks of the body of repetition or substitution, the html-body, 
the patterned or centered body, the dismemberment of the capital-
letter-punishment. One thinks of the multiplicity of bodies; bodies
seeping among sites, sights, citations; bodies as _semantic flow_ -
political economies of subjectivities across partial domains. Each
reconfiguration of the surface (such as this itself, written in emacs)
turns towards an investigation, the peripheral image caught at the
edge of the mirror, the feeling that someone, some body, is behind you
this very moment.

The _tiny or weak_ body sits, ponders, a metaphysics occasioned by the
_tools of the Net_ - by any Thing (site, formation, flow) within which
language is mobile, constrained, channeled. The Jennifer-body is close
to the ground, close to meaning. The Alan-body remains over-determined
and tending towards foreclosure, defuge; it is the Jennifer-body that
carries on this work, the Julu-body that undermines it with sexuality,
rage, and the phenomenology of the _sleazy,_ torn, half-open, gleaming
in a midnight of artificial illuminations.

(Within and without, _it_ attempts speech, continues inconclusivity.)
