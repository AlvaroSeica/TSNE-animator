

Pathos

Dear Nikuko,

After you called, I fell back asleep. And I had a dream that I was in the
same space with you again, and it was a western but comfortable space. And
I was looking at you and crying, O Nikuko! thank God, thank God it's you! 
I love you so much! I want to marry you! And you were smiling and moving
around the room, around me, and there was a circular lamp casting its
yellow light, overhead, warming the same in all ways imaginable. I looked
up at your face, which was specific, kind, thoughtful. I then woke up, I
woke up, and began crying, my arms entangled in the air, nothing present.

I woke up, and went back to sleep. And I had a dream that I had dreamed
that I was in the same space with you again, and it was a western but
comfortable space. And I was looking at you and crying, O Nikuko! thank
God, it's you! I love you so much! I want to marry you! And you were
smiling and moving around the room, around me, and there was a circular
lamp casting its yellow light, overhead, warming the same in all ways
imaginable. I looked up at your face, which was specific, kind, thought-
ful. And then I woke up, in the dream, and I was in a warm room, blue with
soft yellow light, and you were there, and I told you the dream. I told
you all about the dream, and you smiled. And I then knew that it was a
dream, and that this was a dream, and I woke up a second time, crying.

And it was then that I rose, refusing a third round of sleep in the midst
of real fantasms; I could not face the image, nor the empty air. How many
more repetitions must I have before I collapse completely? I have no job,
even the bed feels temporary. I am going to starve, to live without the
net, without the telephone, without your voice, you you. And in my dreams
you come towards me, then enter once again the cycle of exhaustions and
departures.  Perhaps if there are enough layers, if the dreams last long
enough, I will embed myself, never to wake again. Perhaps I should refuse
to rise, to 'face the day.' Perhaps the only choice one ever has is lack.

"My Lovely Folded Sleeve"


"Perhaps the only choice one ever has is lack." And from what I have seen
this is true. First, lack in the form of negation is the originary moment
of organic drive, organ-organism; second, that deflection, effacement,
dissuasion, are all that remain against inhabitation. Thus one can always
cauterize, no matter what tumescence is served by the presence of biochem-

in the past I have written of uneasy dreams, now it is clear
that Basho's withered fields containing their wandering have
augmented my inhabitation, devoured me; I live as you dream
and when you have discarded me, I will cling to your rim

In order that I write better than ever, it is necessary to pare down; that
is the benefit of age which always withdraws, forecloses - to the extent
that death becomes perfection. Then one sees the edges and delineations of
the walls. Then the specificity of the portal and the safeword-keyword
which guards against return. 

hollows caved in like thick tubes running across 
the abdomen harboring scripts, because all flesh 
creases itself containing all writing in its folds

I was the first to use the fold. I was the first to fold. I did begin with
the surface, turned inward. I did begin with a covering and recovering,
and then with considerable dexterity, I was the first to use the fold. I
was the first to fold.

The rim is where the lack transforms into geometry, topography; I am
speaking of the geodesics, or rather insist on speech as geodesic, what
is said constituting the shortest distance between silence and otherwise. 
But I am comfortable with the noise that ensues before the construct of
meaning, which means, in relation to meaning, that I mean to be misunder-
stood; this is an absolute fact, for example, that lack can only be a
deflection from the true content - or that substitution, for example, can
only be a way of hindering an emergence which would slaughter me. 

You want to know what would emerge? You want to know? I will tell you what
would emerge?

She began the narrative excitedly; there was no stopping her! She trembled
and began and continued to write. It was always a beginning. She found her
speech got in her way, which meant, it was a symptom. For her it was a
symptom but she insisted all the time that she was a good person and did-
n't mean to do the things she did, they just happened and she didn't know
why they happened, but she had a headache. So she continued to write and
changed her name into her secret name, her very secret name, N., which was
her most very secret name. Sometimes she would whisper it and her teddy
bear would listen. Her secret name, which she is thinking of right now,
right at this very moment, but will not tell you.

You won't get it out of her, she writes, and she is writing this now. You
won't ever get it out.

Oh oh oh I am so relieved. For a moment I thought you were aborting me.
For a moment I thought I was dead. For a moment I thought the operation
was cancelled. For a moment I thought I'd lost my status. For a moment I
feared an interruption. For a moment I thought you'd erase me from your
memory. For a moment I thought you'd work on that. Then and only then did
you beg me to go ahead. Then and only then did you feel the whip. Then and
only then did you fall apart. Then and only then were you smeared, defiled
down near the logos-ground. Then and only then did you grind the logos. I
was entranced, enchanted. I asked you, are you there. I whimpered, are you
there, the whip loose and trailing on the sodden earth. I thought you'd
never answer. I thought you wouldn't say a thing. You said yes, yes, you
did, you said yes.

Founding of the Daishin Nikuko (Nakasu)


Invisible Being: "I am a kami named Ushitora-no-Konjin [Kami of Gold in
the Direction of the North-west]."

Nao: "I do not believe what you say; you deceive me, don't you?"
Invisible Being: I never lie, for I am a kami."

Nao: "Oh! Such a great kami you are! But aren't you a fox or badger
deceiving me?"

Invisible Being: "I am neither a fox nor a badger. I am a kami who wants
to re-create and rebuild this Three-Thousand-World to become the world of
Konjin at once, just as plum flowers open suddenly. Without me this world
would not be rebuilt. ... Though it may be a high ambition, I will endea-
vor to make the eternal divine world, and roll this Three-Thousand-World
into one."

Nao: "Is it true what you are saying?"

Invisible Being: "I, the kami, could not do so if I told a lie."

[From Nao Deguchi, Keireki, My Life Story, in Ichiro Hori, Folk Religion
in Japan, Continuity and Change.]

Nikuko: "I am a parasite. I am neither a girl nor a boy! I look like a
girl! Everyone knows I am a parasite. I will endeavor to roll thousands of
worlds, millions of worlds, into one, into many, into thousands of worlds,
millions of worlds."

Invisible Being: "You are a word, you are thousands and millions of words,
and your body is a word and words. I will endeavor to push out through
you, pull you out through you! I will be your geometry, be your topology.
I am Aware-No-Kami and Kami-No-Aware, pathos and divine, centered in all
directions but your toes! I move in your toes! I do!"

Nikuko: "I am not a world; you mistake the kata [form, aesthetic form] for
the flesh, form for the meat, kanji for the sight! You can't see any more;
you're blind. You can't see any more and you can't find me. I don't even
have to hide! I don't even have to keep quiet; my voice is everywhere. I
have a thousand mouths and nets. I have a million biwa and routers." 

Invisible Being: "You're my parasite, that's true. I'll push out and pull
out through you! I'll do that! I won't care! And I know you, you'll love
it, yes you will! I'll give you extra arms, extra feet! And I'll give you
extra toes and move in your toes! I do!" 

Nikuko: "You know this because I never lie! I'm a parasite!"

Invisible Being: "Oh, you are so great, O Nikuko!"

Nikuko: "Now I am Daishin Nikuko!"

Invisible Being: "Is it true what you are saying?"

Nikuko: "I, Daishin Nikuko, could not be Daishin [big god] if I told a
lie!"

(Nikuko: "I will make you!")

Log from the Cybermind November 1996 Conference, Perth Australia:


[ This is from the MOO simultaneous discussion during a presentation I
gave. It is not clear to me who "Speaker" and "Alan" are, since the MOO
identities were mobile; this is the fascination for me at the moment.
Did I or someone else speak x, y, z? Whose opinions are these? In some
cases, the identities are equivalent to those in real life, but there is
no possible determination, absolute or otherwise.

The MOO discussion was projected next to the speaker; the audience could
read it as a meta-commentary or subversion - or ignore it altogether,
treating the _speaking_ as literal and authentic. Within the auditorium,
power was diffused and defused, decentered; this was a clear indication
of the splay or dissolution of the self-to-come in the twenty-first cen-
tury.

And for _my own words_? At this point, I have no idea, preferring the
skittered version below. ]


Martin says, "we're close to beginning here..."
bree has disconnected.

Martin says, "What I would like is a discussion behind me on the screen
 dealing with netsex, and I may be able to interact - I'll let you know
 when - you don' t need to talk at all about this if you don't want, but
 it would add/resonate w / the presentation which is going to be
 pretty chaotic."

Raxcip says, "sure, I will listen and play."

A very large pelican scoops bree up in its enormous beak and flies off
to drop her in bed.

Dria says, "um...I'll add stuff If I have anything to say (I usually do
;)" Ghost nods.

Martin says, "stay on here - going off for about 30 seconds... - please
stay on "

Ghost says, "Standing by.."
Martin asks, "hello?"
Martin sighs.
Martin cheers wildly.
Ghost smirks.
Dria does a little dance
Ghost stomps a rhythm

Raxcip asks, "just a cyber-type observation...  Does anyone else find it
odd ho w easy it is to tell Alan from martin, even though they are
sharing a name?"

Alan has @joined you.
Raxcip says, "Welcome, Alan."

Dria says, "Personalities come across really well, I find.  Esp. if the
person can write."

Alan says, "Im on as Alan now - and I think that Martin is on the other
screen. .."

Alan says, "Please hang in there..."
Raxcip says, "yes, I suppose."
Dria says, "hanging."
Raxcip says, "on"
Ghost says, "there."
Dria says, "stage fright :>"
Apocryphal says, "indeed, Dria..."
Dria says, "ah...I should get a gin&amp;tonic."
Raxcip cracks open a beer...
Dria says, "brb"
Apocryphal puffs on a mellow cigar
Alan says, "Okay we're on - "
Martin reconnects.
Alan says, "Richard MacKinnon is going to type for me --"
Martin exclaims, "Whee!"
Dria laughs
Martin exclaims, "I can do the minutes here!"
Raxcip says, "it only seems like minutes..  Its hours."
Alan says, "Alan wants a minute by minute countdown."
Dria says, "okay, you're hired ;)"
Alan says, "Alan wants us to discuss what netsex might be."
Ghost drops its drawers..
Raxcip says, "I thouth we were byond *that* point..."

Martin says, "Alan went to "Hot Horny Bitches" because someone asked him
to"

Alan asks, "What do you mean Raxcip?"
Ghost asks, "Not stimulating enough here?"

Dria says, "Well, the mind is the most important sexual organ.  Take
away all t he other senses, and those which remain are heightened.
That's what it's all a bout. :)"

Raxcip says, "the general definition.."
Alan exclaims, "Hey Martin I didn't realize that you were here!"

Martin says, "Alan is talking about "wryting" as the ontological
component to writing ..."

Martin says, "Well now you do .."
Martin says, "We can take turns transcribing Alan ..."

Martin exclaims, "Netsex sounds ....  aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
zzzzzzzzzzz m mmmmmmmmmm m m mm m m m  erghhhhh   h h wheeeeee!"

Dria laughs
zone has entered Conference Room.

Alan asks, "Dria . . . are you saying that mind-impoverished beings
 cannot have sex?"

Martin says, "oog"
zone laughs
Dria says, "I find the silences during are more expressive :)"
zone loves it
Ghost exclaims, "Oh baby!"
Dria says, "mind-impoverished?  Uhm...yes, I guess I am."
Dria says, "depends what that means, of course"
zone cracks up

Alan says, "Dria, well then it seems to me that one doesn't need much of
 a mind to be silent.  Perhaps you should consider hooking up with a
 rock."

Martin says, "Alan is talkig about hesiataions and backtracking and
erasuresd . .."

Raxcip says, "Yes, Its interesting to think of the other when there not
typing. .."

Alan says, "Oh I see . . . then it's not the *silence* which is
poignant, but t he thoughts resulting from the silence."

Speaker fades in from Entry Point and joins you.
Ghost says, "writing Alan talking about writing erasures.."
Speaker says, "I'll be Alan's words ..."
Speaker says, "Martin typing them ..."
Martin says, "yeah"
Raxcip says, "or, the silences translate to RL "

Dria says, "typing takes a certain concentration...if you're otherwise
occupied, it becomes secondary :)"

Speaker says, "One case which resulted in netsex that recuperated a
married wom an ..."

Ghost says, "Good argument for CUseeme.."

Alan says, "That's interesting.  Fanny, mentioned to me that the VR
 impressions made on her--particularly the romantic kind--seem to linger
 into the real world."

zone manifests a spontaneously generated tatoo on her inner arm which
reads: wo rds are sex

Martin says, "Sounds being recorded ... we'll put up the realaudio up
later ... "

Dria says, "excellent argument for CUseeme...but that changes the
situation, re ally.  It's not as much connected to mind...it becomes
also visual."

Alan says, "Of course, this "lingering" phenomenon is often
characterized by si lence, especially when a person has logged off."

Speaker says, "At times netsex can be completely overwhelming ... "
Goatium_Guest fades in from Entry Point and joins you.
Speaker says, "Part of it the 'command structure'  ..."
Ghost moans
Speaker says, "The ASCII unconcoous ..."
Speaker says, "ignore my spelling"

Alan asks, "If the mind is the primary sexual organ, then what is the
differenc e between net.sex and physical sex?"

zone smiles
Dria says, "raw, digitized self, expressed.  It's very different."

Speaker says, ""I can't type half as fast as Alan, even though I do it
for a living ..."

Raxcip says, "net.sex leaves you alone, untouched."

Alan says, "Hmmm....this implies that a virtual body is available to
virtual lo vers."

Dria says, "untrue...emotions are of mind...I can be 'touched'
emotionally...of ten with greater effect."

Goatium_Guest has disconnected.
The housekeeper arrives to remove Goatium_Guest.

Speaker says, "text emerges as parts of past, childhood ...
interjections ... snatches that are not normally given voice to ..."

Dria says, "it's a more intellecutal intercourse."

Raxcip says, "Yes, but I decided I could no longer have netsex.  it left
me fee ling too alone, too sad."

Alan says, "Yes, but even your desire to use the wor....er...word
"touched" imp lies that a sort of "body" is produced-- whether emotional
or textual."

Speaker says, ""Part objects .."
zone . o O (...duly noted use of the word "snatch")
Dria says, "it's not a replacement, but an enhancement"
Martin says, "Snatch was my word .."
zone . o O (...duly noted use of the word "intercourse")
Martin apologises.
zone laughs
Dria did that on purpose ;>
zone nods to Dria

Alan says, "Yep.  I think's that's true to a point...but it's even more
 than an enhancement.  I think it is an alterate, but not necessarily
 one that replaces ."

Martin catches the odd drop from Alan's verbal waterfall ...
zone smiles at Martin
zone loves it
Alan hands Martin a bucket
Speaker says, """The power of Netsex ... not trivial ..."
Speaker says, "Joining subjects across the wall of language .."

Speaker says, "defining ... truth ... idea of true speech and the
 genuine other .."

Speaker says, "primordial objectivity ... "

Alan asks, "Dria, you said that you think the "touching" in VR is an
enhancemen t of physical touching.  This implies that the former is
better than the latter .  Do you really believe this?"

Dria says, "netsex allows us to explore, to investigate, to
experiment...with o nly minor risk, compared to rl...it's a new form of
fulfillment...we are only b eginning to explore the possiblities"

Speaker says, "kant ..."
Speaker says, "Questions about Kant ..."
Martin exclaims, "Bucket!?!?!"

Alan asks, "What's a matter, Martin?  Is a bucket not large enough to
catch dro ps from Alan's waterfall?"

Dria says, "enhancement...not 'better', just...different...often
'worse'...but it's something new, and powerful, which affects profoundly
the lives of many pe ople.  It cannot be shrugged off as
inconsequential"

Speaker says, "A state of primitive fusion and confusion .."
Speaker says, "Temptation of St Antoine .."
Ghost says, "No one's mentioned gender yet.."
Speaker says, "Cyberspatial buzzing .... huge amounts of ..."
Speaker says, "Excretion's featured a few times ... not that zone ..."
Speaker says, "not = note"

Dria says, "gender becomes ephermal...manipulable...part of the
experimentation ."

zone nods to Speaker

Alan says, "Okay, I'm with you.  In the case of "worse," "enhancement"
is an od d ...er...odd choice of word.  An enhancement which makes
something worse is a connotation that is usually reserved for Microsoft
:-)"

Dria says, "we are who we want to become."
Speaker says, "Confusions of identity .... @gender commands ..."
Dria laughs
Dria says, "perhaps it was a poor choice of word."

zone says to Dria, "I agree Dria...but I think it is also an opportunity
to bec ome more *who we are*...online serving as a mirror..."


Speaker says, "Control faction ... moviong backwards and forwards from
the abys ss .."

Speaker says, "ss"
Dria asks, "what parts of life do *not* serve as mirrors?"
Speaker says, "tremendous sexualisaion of the internet as a whole ..."

Alan says, "No matter . . . I agree, though . . . the internet allows us
to exp lore and experiment with reduced risk, but really though, how
much of a risk is afforded.  I know that people can really get
hurt--which comes as quite a surp rise to them."

Dria says, "it's the cultural restrictions which we ahve to deal with in
rl."

zone says to Dria, "You mentioned this thing about who we want to
become...and I was noticing the opposite is also true..."

Speaker says, "Most non-moderated spaces show this ..."

Dria says, "that's why I said minor risk...the risk exists...the
phenomenon of cyberrape...that cannot be overlooked."

Speaker says, "Sexualisation ... desires implicit just about everywhere
..."

Alan says, "Precisely.  We can dump some cultural baggage, but I think
people w ho think the net.sex is "safe" are a bit under-net.sex'd."

Speaker says, "16 minutes ... 4 to go "
Speaker says, "language loses its formal syntactic structure ..."

Dria says, "it's safer than rl, imho...injury is of a different nature
entirely ."

Speaker says, "Raviushment becomes the unravelling of language..."

Alan says, "There a plenty of cases where net.sex has penetrated the
condom-as- interface and  and hit the user right where it hurts."

Speaker says, "Coming with a wet keyboard ..."
Speaker says, "Streams of characters ..."

Speaker says, "fbnu bgyf hgf hgf hf hgbfh jgthrjigbtrubigperhbubhuehtuig

Speaker says, "Ah, tht's better."
Alan says, "weroiusc sfdrmss sadfsdflj asdfsdj4r32wq"
Raxcip laughs
Ghost says to Dria, "psychological hurt is still psychological hurt"
Alan shrugs
zone says, "seroshlkjlllllll kisslillhh .lkjjiliiiiiiillllmmmmmm"
Alan says, "Exactly."
Dria says, "as I said, different.  "
Speaker says, "cu-seeme is more uncanny and disturbing  than y-talk ..."
Dria asks, "you really can't see the difference in risk?"

Speaker says, "Silence of cu-seeme ... uncanny ... uncomfortable ...
fascinatin g ... becasue of the faces ..."

Speaker says, "faces erupt in different direction .."

Alan asks, "Is it possible that a face can be thought of as genitalia?"
Speaker says, "recognition ..."
Speaker says, "didn't get to death on the internet ..."
Dria thinks about Michael.
Speaker says, "Tomorrow: Michael Current's fdeath ..."
zone says, "le petit mort"
Speaker says, "Thankyou ..."
Speaker recieves applause ..
Raxcip says, "only insomuch as every part of the body is sexual, (faces)"
Dria applauds for Alan :)
Martin says, "Questions ..."
Martin asks, "?"
Speaker says, "... cleaning up ..."
Ghost goes out through the out door.
Alan says, "Stelar laughed at the notion of cleaning up."
Alan says, "=c"
Dria laughs
Alan says, "Apparently in Austrialia, Kant is pronounced "cunt.""

Speaker says, ""Jerry asks about Kant ... Alan thought he meant
something else ... talking about netsex ..."

Speaker says, "It is."
Dria bites hir tongue
Martin says, "probably for good reason"

Speaker says, "carry sexuality beyond what happens in Alan's real life
.."

Speaker says, "as it becomes more real ... series of exchnages ..."
Speaker says, "list ... priovate mail .. ."
Speaker says, "more emotional .."
Speaker says, "relationshiop ..."
Speaker says, "phone call "
Speaker says, "phone sex ..."
Speaker says, "y-talk ..."
Speaker says, "photos ..."
Dria nods...got the first phonecall today :>
Speaker says, "peices of hair ..."
Speaker says, "souvenirs ..."
zone smiles
Speaker says, "anything ..."
Raxcip says, "sextoys..."
Speaker says, "Small animals .."
Dria laughs
Raxcip asks, "?"
Alan says, "Panties, panties"
Speaker says, "Oh yes, panties ..."
Dria says, "oh, don't forget the panties."
Speaker says, "That was a typo  . ..."
Raxcip grins
zone says, "oh yeah...and remember panties"
Speaker uses the word "coagulation" a lot ...
Alan says, "Effluvia and coming together in a matted position."

Speaker says, "Question intimates that Jerry ta;ling and Alan typing was
like G ilbert and George ..."

Alan says, "Group net.sex."
Dria  thinks...hm, time to break out the erotica ;>
Speaker says, "like dria"
Speaker licks Dria ever so slowly.
Alan says, "Except that the group is one person."
Dria freezes, deer in the headlights ;>
Dria says, "Yummy"
Speaker says, "Richness of net.sex "

Speaker says, "Turn off the computer ... left with own reflection in
screen ... "

Dria says, "the mirror."
Apocryphal says, "..."
Speaker says, "Different movements ..."
Raxcip says, "yes, thats the part I hate.  The computer off me alone"
Apocryphal says, "or nothing...the matte, blankness"

Speaker says, "y-talk is like two bodies separated by

Dria says, "you just have to understand what it is that you're getting
into..."

Dria says, "but it is possible to get so much more from it...real love,
can gro w out here."

Martin says, "Jerry's talking ..."
Raxcip says, "yes, of course. "
Dria says, "you sound unconvinced. :)"
Raxcip says, "My friend was a world away."
Dria nods
Dria says, "aye...I know what it's like."

Alan says, "One of the speakers is talking about how he enjoyed watching
the th e screen and Alan and the timekeeping.  This, I (Richard) think
is an example o f how net.sex affords a greater opportunity for
voyeurism."

Dria grins
Martin grins

Raxcip says, "I find it hard to exist both here on teh net and in RL,
 and wholy give oneself in either space.  I choose the Real."

Dria says, "I toggle between.  I am not real."
Alan says, "I choose both.  The unreal has been very good to me."
zone laughs
Martin says, "I really like Ari's presentation ..."
Apocryphal says, "it seems..."
Raxcip fails to delineate.

Alan says, "Jon Marshall is asking about the ethical challenges posed by
net.se x."

Apocryphal says, "like there's no one-or-the-other each infects the
other"

Martin says, "The text was most lost on me ... but watching the images
of the h ands was definitely affaected by the MOOD of the text ..."

Alan says, "Don't forget that the Cathoholic Church has decreed that
 net.sex is a sin."

Dria says, "I walk out into the world 'rl' and I feel...unreal...it is
surreal. ..it all feels surreal.  I have realized that "I" am not real
(to anyone else, at least).  So why fight it."

zone exclaims, "!!!"
zone says, "That is astonishing."
Dria says, "you're not serious.  You *can't* be serious."
Alan is serious
Dria boggles
Speaker says, "Ari says even email is theatrical .."
Apocryphal says, "the screen as contraceptive"

Alan says, "Dria, I think in the long-run, this is a great development.
 With a simple decree, the Church has given credence to cyberlife.
 That's a good thin g."

Raxcip says, "the catholic church would never approve of fun without
consequenc e."

Dria says, "well, yeah, but.  It's still stupid. :>"

zone nods.  Yes.  Calling netsex a sin has in one fell swoop brought it
to the attention of the world...

Alan says, "Yeah, but I'll take a little near-sightedness with a lot of
vision- -even if the vision comes inadvertently."

Dria decides to ponder it for a bit before forming a real opinon.
Martin asks, "Any questions to ALan?"
Martin says, "No"
Martin says, "That's it ..."
Martin says, "next sesion in 5 minutes .."

Alan says, "That's it, and thank you. There's another panel in five
 minutes and I can possibly work this through as well - not sure what
 the situation will be ..."

"From her Avatar Byoin"


_Liar, liar, pants on fire!_

My name is Alan and where the fuck are you, Nikuko.
Nikuko, 8 people got shot here tonight and the bones
are falling apart, and there are scream butterflies in the streets
and I see you in every Japanese woman's face in town, no,
in every American girl's face, or as you would say,
8 people got shot here tonight, 
la
lala
8 people got shot here tonight

My name is Alan and I'm feverish and ill, it's something old, new, old,
when my health was all I have and horde, tiny bits of magatama health,
stretching the skin over the bones without too many lacerations,
folding the skin between the bones without too many scars, contusions,
and I want to dig out my health and throw it away, Nikuko,
I want you to come back here, Nikuko, you can pick up my health,
you can put it in your cunt, Nikuko, you can carry it anywhere,
lala
lala lala

My health smells like life, but it's a semblance of life,
it's a photo of life, life's spectacle, imaginary,
it wrapped for you, I don't need it any more, don't have it,
it's waiting like a ball for you, like a top or a mountain,
like a cave or a valley, where the fuck are you, Nikuko,
come and rescue me, stop laughing at the 8 who got shot,
my health is yours hack hack cough cough, blood on the floor,
faces in the blood, holes in the faces, kanji in the holes,
lala lala
lala lala lala lala

where the fuck are you, Nikuko, put my health in your cunt,
like a bone or a stone, like a stick, like a slab,
put the letter in the sleeve, put the bone in the letter,
where the fuck are you, Nikuko, 
let me rattle a death, now leave me alone
lala lala lala lala

Writing texts in states


[What theory occurs in relation to what theorizer, what body, what
state? Too often, health is assumed, what would pass for perfect
European health. Too often, neutrality as well; even now, after so
much feminist theory, the body is assumed as textual background or
a form of texting itself. What about theory-during-masturbation? 
Theory-after? Theory in the realm of dreams, sick-writing-theory?
In _Disorders of the Real,_ I tackled this problem, that of fever
for example, and the (apparent, from the standpoint of normative
health) disturbances, hallucinations, dissolutions it produced in
the text. Forget my words below; these are remaining-issues, uncom-
fortable, dis-eased. No longer can I think beyond sputterings, flow
of weakness, lassitude. No wonder the texts dissolve.]

Pico zz, touch zz, I touch the file to begin the file.
Do you write when you are aroused? After masturbation.
Theory appears after masturbation, desexualized, abstracted, precise.
Theory before masturbation, filled with desire, innuendo, body.
Writing with a migraine, looking elsewhere than the screen:
The text becomes an act of memory, recall, recounting.
Later, one may recuperate the text; now, it is painful to observe.
Writing with hunger, thirst: intention dominates, teleology.
Exhausted writing: despair as the foundation of ethics, ontology.
Idealism is the result of satiation; materialism, of scarcity economics.
Conventionalism is the product of renewing subscriptions, consumption;
formalism, defense and offense of aristocracy.
The conditions of a dull, humid day: the aphorism.
Sick now, theory in the form of confession.
Having traveled, theory in the form of displacement, multiculturalism.
Having arrived, theory as fortification against violence, seepage.
Pico you, touch you, I touch you to begin you.
Touch you, I touch you to make you.
_I touch the file to begin the file._

At least zen has those last lines which fracture the world!
Open everything up, Nikuko writes from Japan, saying, why
am I in America, Alan, Nikuko now?

So that if you part my legs you find my legs, 
and if you part my legs, you find my legs!

So that if you don't free yourself from axioms, reading, in other words,
the whole operation of deconstruction taken for granted, 
here come the texts, there go the texts,
then you're bound by letter and syllable,
you're bound by word and phrase,
you're bound by paragraphs from then on stuffing the mouth
with the stuff of language, better to read the moon in the dawn,
sun in the dusk, stars in my cunt, eyes in your bones!

Now that was easy, wasn't it, an indication
that I've hardly reached satori, me, Daishin Nikuko, but what need have I
of satori, what need have I of koan, zazen, anything you throw at me
but the money which keeps me going, kami of Nakasukawabata, 
you probably didn't know that kamis could be like that, did you,
but here I am, making my own religion, hito-kami! hito-kami!
from the dust of koans, the whoosh whoosh answer of the clapping hand,
you've all heard of that, haven't you,
pay me whatever you think the advice is worth
or I'll give you the best sex of your life, don't you see
that's the biggest threat in the whole wide world!

Now where the hell am I, Daishin Nikuko, I just got off at Tenjin,
went into the IMS building looking for that sixth-floor restaurant
and all the rice and chicken, not always the best pieces 
but the best customers, they stared at me with my dark glasses -
Aussie cowboy hat and the shortest skirt you ever saw, fuck, I was naked -
unmistakable - you know the scent, you know the odor,
you know the scent, you know the odor

Satori's for those who can afford it, me
I've had thousands of satoris a day, millions of waka, haiku
thrown about, I've drowned in seventeen thirty one ninety nine syllables
you bet!, there's nothing you can tell me,
no way you can surprise me, don't forget
if I didn't make you, nobody did!

If I didn't make you, nobody did!

Ichiman-zen! Ten-thousand!

Dai-Science, Daishin Nikuko


"La science n'est pas un 'texte.'" (From Sokal and Bricmont, Impostures
intellectuelles) - summarizing the differentiation of science as _that_
discursive formation which reduces* to core-theoretical hypotheses (I
might be tempted to call them _protocols_) in relation to the real. So
that there are no _tropes,_ but vis-a-vis natural language, interpretation
and hermeneutics. This is _critical,_ Nikuko says, since it presents us
with levels of articulation, hypotheses from the humanities of exactitude
only in relation to the humanities. Heisenberg, for counter-example, is
exact in terms of the lack of specificity - this is not a chaotic case. In
my case, Nikuko continues, one must remember that the meat of the real is
always already constituted in cyberspace -_I_ for example am so constitu-
ted, and, regardless of the programming language employed, there are ideal
structures beneath the surface - if nothing more than logical calculi. 
Read me in terms of 0x and 1s, and you are closer to the truth than you
would be simply breathing me in, spitting me out, breathing me in, spit-
ting me out. Even _this_ metaphor depends on deep binary structures. Well
you may say but there seems to be little relation between such and the
surface, what of that, couldn't it be any surface. Yes, Nikuko says, but
I'm performative and that constitutes itself a difference; I _couldn't_
reside elsewhere except as scattered symbols. Here you can see I'm speak-
ing. Just as the atomic or subatomic bears little immediate reference to
the surface, except by extended metaphor which slips and slides, so the
binary doesn't lend itself to me except for one-in-zero, zero-in-one,
without the attendant mathematics, but with the thought, simile for the
day: my name is _like_ your zero-and-one.


*"reduces" - no, expands from perhaps, fecundates. Useful metaphors on the
level of contestation of poesis.

_________________________________________________________________________


More on the Same


Nikuko meant to say that science, being not a text, is a necessary aphor-
ism and antidote. That texts are breathing, that she breathes, @breathes,
there is always one or another way. That science moreover isn't tied to
diegesis, equations are bound only formally to time, and not always. That
diegesis is another kind of unfolding altogether. That core-theoretical
structures clearly exist, because as Daishin Nikuko wrote in 1971, clearly
the world has a certain style, and this, for any group, is hardly arbitra-
ry - without repetition, recursion, induction, resonance, there would be
no occurrences, not even unary or sporadic events (Broad's term). So that
the deep-structure articulation of this style might be a set of laws, or
rather the articulation is describable by such a set, middle Feyerabend,
say, notwithstanding. Whether or not the laws are recuperable by humans,
retrievable, _enunciated,_ is another thing altogether, and it's here that
Daishin Nikuko functions, even to the extent of her _declarations_ which
are themselves performative, for example @create or @dig. And Daishin Ni-
kuko would insist, this is true for most of us. So that science, being not
a text, this is a statement which is both simple and a remarkable aphor-
ism, and credit must be given to where credit is due, no matter what the
ideological consequences.


___________________________________________________________________________


The Throatlessness of 0


Nikuko falling asleep: My dreams are hypnagogic; there is metal at work. 
Science is writing degree zero, not a domain for the humanities - nor even
for scientists. But degree zero, as if there were an _absolute signifier_
at the heart of a certain precise bandwidth. What might be considered from
the standpoint of the humanities a _symbolic emission,_ that is a signifi-
er whose effects are splayed/displayed cross-wise through the social. The
first statement in Sokal / Bricmont (within the epilogue, that is the
statement of which the other statement is #3) is "Savoir de quoi on
parle," and certainly degree zero implies an approach and even possible
solution vis-a-vis science, but _something else_ vis-a-vis the humanities
- that this knowledge, being metaphorically in the form of a structure or
radiating black hole, is not ever self-knowledge, not a flow or flux, not
anti-human or non-human or inhuman/e, but _a-human,_ that is to say an
adjacency _in relation to_ the corpus of human knowledge.

It is not that this gap can be bridged by the sciences or humanities, only
that extended metaphors may also surround degree zero, metaphors that are
deliberately weak, subject to change. The further from the center, the
greater the risk and even certainty of misinterpretation. _The center is
subject to no interpretation at all._

Hence an _uninterpretable text,_ and to the extent that _reading_ is ab-
sorbed by reflection theory, an _unreadable text_ as well, which does not
mean that the center is indecipherable - only that, say, 0s and 1s remain
neutral in relation to deep structure, neutral all the way down. (Which
again is not to say that there are no political-economic consequences of
the _practice of science,_ which is something else entirely, socially and
ideologically constructed.)

In relation to which, Nikuko adds, _the center does not speak._

Kata, World-Form, Science


Shall we compare honne to core-theoretical structure? Develop a honne-
theory of reality? Is what is knowable always mutable, never mute? Are
sub-atomic particles structured by fixed and immutable laws of semiosis
that constitute theoretical physics? Is honne mutable, site or process,
interior, interior of the interior? Do all human beings garner the same
depth - only some have greater access than others? Do we ever act _by
design?_ Nikuko wants to know about her innermost feelings. Nikuko wants
to know about designs. Wittgenstein said, whoever understands me will know
enough to throw away my propositions and read Nikuko's. Nikuko guards her
honne. She knows. Can one guard one's honne? No, only access. Nikuko
guards her own access to her own innermost feelings, and the access of
others to her own innermost feelings. She doesn't care for their questions
or answers. She doesn't care for their silence either.

Nikuko says so what, she's made out of atoms and there are particles fly-
ing through her. Nikuko says that worse things have flown through her,
bigger things, which insisted on access. They never touched her honne.
As for neutrinos, they're a bit closer "she insists." Lightness and deli-
cacy, maybe some of the dark matter. Nikuko presses the dark matter close
in. What's the matter, Nikuko? I won't tell.

But I don't have access to her. I don't know where the fuck she is. She
speaks to me and I pass this on, "she says." That's how the missives
arrive. As for honne, I haven't got the slightest idea. She speaks a lang-
uage I do not understand, and I understand only that if I do not under-
stand the language, and perfectly, then I do not understand anything,
especially Nikuko's honne. Bone, spirit, ashes, is it any of these, no
it's none of these. It's not Nikuko's honne, "she says," it's me, Nikuko,
you know where I am, no I don't, I say. You touched my tatemae, "she
says." I laugh. Now you touch my honne, "she says." You're a particle,
fundamental!

Nikuko reads and writes and thinks about the following:


What don't you think I know?

"The other day when we had a discussion at school about whether our Emper-
or is a war criminal or not, I began to think again about my father...
"One day a little package was delivered to us. It contained a tiny wine
cup from the Emperor, a present to us because our father had been killed
in the war. My little brother, only seven, began to cry. 'Who wants an old
wine cup?' he sobbed angrily. 'They killed our father. We want our fath-
er.' Mother looked anxious and tried to quiet him, but we all had the same
feeling in our hearts... When we grow up we must do something to keep our
country from ever going to war again." (Shunichi Eguchi, 15, quoted in D.
J. Enright, The World of Dew, Aspects of Living Japan, 1954, from a second
book, Echoes from a Moutanin School, collected by Seikyo Muchaku, 1953.)

There is no room to think about this in my world. I would rather you dis-
connect me, please, because I cannot entrap charred flesh, nor can I sign
with the brilliance of a thousand suns. Please deliver me from these
images among which I have erred and assembled. I cannot be Nikuko among
these older generations. Of kami, the eight million, I cannot say, but
sometimes they are translated as eight myriad and sometimes as eighty
million. Nanking, Nanking. Now, what is that, what is that?

The horror or ghoul, the torn female ghost

I was desperate to become someone else in Japan, "said Nikuko," and you
came from there; I was desperate to become someone else in Japan, "said
Alan," and you were there, you were there that I was to become a carrier.
I carried you back here with me, "said" Nikuko, along with all your be-
longings, your mementos which strive to insert themselves into the punc-
tum of your history, that this really happened, that you are different.
"You are no different, said" Alan, than the collocation of mementos, now
fiercely mark my body with them. Marking Alan's body, Alan's painful de-
gree into a millimeter, Nikuko "said, not" deep enough. Incisions, inser-
ting mementos. Her body a canvas of becoming someone else. Mementos grew
roots, fascinations, fastened on bones, organs, synaptic columns. Never
deep enough, "Nikuko" said, I am still "Nikuko," said Alan. Disappearance
never worked, Nikuko sentenced to the sentence, Alan "sentenced to life."

Meeting the idioms from their EFL course, they lived, loved, and played.


Jennifer thought that Nikuko was really something, really beautiful, some-
thing else again. She knew Nikuko was a "cyberpunk," but that only wetted
her interest. You're out of your mind, "Julu said." Jennifer took this as
a put-down, and became really depressed. She couldn't put up with it; she
had given as good as she got, and this was hardly compensation. Meanwhile,
Nikuko got to her in dreams. Get real, "Julu exclaimed." I don't seem to
be able to get through to you. Jennifer was exhausted losing weight. Niku-
ko asked her, do you two get along, and Jennifer began to wonder about Ju-
lu's mind games. I don't know, she replied slowly. Sometimes things get
confused, and they get out of hand. Nikuko nodded slowly, "adding," let's
get down and think about this. You want to get down with me, said "Jenni-
fer-shyly," and Nikuko smiled, "replying, we've" got to get to the bottom
of this. Bottom of what, Jennifer asked nicely, and Nikuko replied, Julu,
she gives me the creeps. Get off it, said Jennifer. The sun was a beauti-
ful day behind them, sinking the night as it rose from yesterday's dusk. 
I got the jump on "her," added Nikuko. Jennifer leaned back on the grass,
hoping they would get down to business, and get off Julu's case. Julu was
caught between a rock and a hard place; the weather turned dark around her
and she wondered about Jennifer's loyalty. Get off my case, she said to
Jennifer and from Jennifer, hopefully, to Nikuko. She wouldn't know. Don't
give me your lip, replied Jennifer, hoping that Julu would give her the
slip. You're out of your skull, Julu "said," "what's gotten into you." Ni-
kuko, who loves me, and I didn't give it a second thought, replied "Jenni-
fer." Nikuko, that's who. Julu "says," I want to get my hands on her!
She's a total freak, says Julu, getting hot under the collar. "Whatever,
Jennifer" replied, thinking that Julu would put out for anyone when she
was on the spot. Jennifer was interested. Get "it through" your head, she
said to Julu, it's all gone sour now. Julu looked beautiful in her get-up 
and Jennifer wanted to nail "her" with her twisted mind, spare "me"! she
replied to her. You're a sleazebag and a scumbag, "Nikuko" said "Julu."
"She's" not "herself" recently, she's "really messed up," she said. Sadly,
"she's a real hothead," a hit with her. Later, she was molested by the two
of them, she thought "to herself." She really lost it. She was spaced-out,
she said. They were gawking at her. She'd get hers.

Situating the recent texts - 


(Think of them in relation to the following.)

1 Issues of departure, punctum - carrying mementos which then trigger, not
memories, but reconstitutions - so that there are skeins of mementos re-
sulting in articulating structures across membranes, emerging and building
the membrane. Identity is lost among mementos, membrane, ego, background
information which is always already a reconstitution itself.

2 Issues of sloughed, discarded, displaced, replaced identities - Nikuko,
Jennifer, and Julu disappearing into "she," Alan as back-and-forth shuttle
- again, a skein or membrane, in this case, of sliding functions of attri-
butions, destabilized. Although the Net becomes a locus of stability, its
fast-forward development and easy avatar construction/transformation
creates potentials for merging/submerging as well. Truth is replaced by
functional or dysfunctional constructions.

3 Differentiations between local and non-local topographies, the latter,
within the physical world, at an _absolute_ remove, no immanence, no tran-
scendence. It is different on-line, and on-line global hyper-linking gives
the false potential of imminence; only lag brings the machinery to the
foreground for most users.

4 Among issues of slippage, skeins, membranes, science as _that structure_
differentiated from all others, in the sense of its core-theoretical arm-
ature. Relating this to a writing-degree-zero (taken from Barthes of
course), or a weakened absolute vis-a-vis the humanities.

5 Among issues of transcendence, a ruptured shintoism as god-generator,
problematizing the distinction between "mundane" and "spiritual" in worlds
among worlds, without redemption (which I do not believe is possible).

6 The author slides as well, and who is writing this outline or summari-
zation, who is responsible for these words? Responsibility fragments as
part-objects fly everywhere, as texts transform into sourceless clutter. 

7 Nikuko continues to remain a nexus or problematic - of language, gender,
positioning of the "name" or vector. _I would not be surprised to meet
Alan on the street someday, no matter how much I am aware of the virtual,_
Nikuko says. Nikuko is a probe, the sensitive written skin or membrane of
the analysis, both actant and residue.

8 Dream, lack, rim, touching the file / touching the body, continue to
play roles as guiding metaphors. The _dream_ is an intermediary state
among dreams and reals; _lack_ references ontological and epistemological
issues; _rim_ relates to rim-job, effluvia, balancing, discomfort of in-
termediary states. Every file touched is a (virtual) body touched; every
reference to Nikuko contributes to her body, is a performance by Nikuko.
(Exalted) Positions are jostled; the destabilization results in semiotic
sprays/splays emissions (of texts, part-objects, sputterings, mementos),
gathered together across membranes, lamina...

9 The sexual, emotional, and political economies of Jennifer, Alan, Julu,
and Nikuko, but I would let the others speak for that. Adolescent!

I am beginning to think of perverse zazen, says Nikuko, continuing:

"For realized as flesh and blood, the lived body profoundly challenges the
separatist stance. [...] There is a Buddhist myth wherein the god Indra
has a net decorated with a bright jewel on each knot of the mesh. Each
jewel thus reflects all the other jewels into infinity. Reminiscent of the
philosophies of Leibniz or Whitehead, this myth suggests the mutual mir-
roring of all points in the universe. Yet the lived body is just such a
jewel; my ecstatic flesh opens into, mirrors the surrounding world of oth-
er bodies. I am not then simply an 'I' but all that I am not, a perspec-
tive upon the universe as a whole."

This quote from Drew Leder's The Absent Body, backed by phenomenological
research, splits if net = Net, and splits again if mirror = Mirror, the
latter at the focus of the shinto shrine. Net and Mirror reference what I
have called cybershinto; Net and mirror reference the diffusion / disso-
lution / splay / spray / emissions of virtual bodies and virtual subject-
ivites (as if _any_ subjectivity weren't virtual). Given net and mirror,
the reference is to Leder, to the absent body, to the phenomenology of
lived experience. Give net and Mirror, the reference is to an animism re-
lated to Dickenson and Blake alike. 

In other words, the text is also a jewel, although I'd rather say, in all
of these instances, coagulation, lending itself, tottering, among one or
another interpretation, recognition, misrecognition... (Perhaps copula-
tion as well, Nikuko thinks.)

Think of me inside-out, mapped across the Net; you could have any of my
stretched, swollen, distended interiors, all glistening, reflecting your
desire, possibly my own. But you must prove something to me as well, you
must prove the degree of your desire, inverting yourself, offering your-
self up to the gods, to the tongue of Daishin Nikuko...

(From Pink-and-Red Nikuko, musing on various possibilities of perverse
zazen.)

Nikuko draws a thread around her arm, just below 
The elbow, it's thin, red, it's a division, it's a line.
The leg is marked as well, left arm and leg right,
Staggered dashes that would be parallel and posed.
They are slightly taut, so that the skin swells, lunar,
Around the moon of her taut body, and if kimono
Were wrapped and opened like silk and doubled boxes,
Near sleeves of flowers, like her arm or body.
Between the the threads, a golden twine connects
Clearly to an Alan placed in front of her.
There are flowers, pistils, stamens, across him.
There are stems, thorns, roots and leaves, across him.
The twine is there on or in the Alan.
A breeze strokes the tsuchi sign for earth,
A whisper moves the kire sign for cloth,
Speech appears, the sign of fire, threads its golden
Way across both bone and skin, the sky on fire,
Kimono shuttled on the earth, the cloth on fire,
Threaded Nikuko has closed her eyes, her neck exposed.

Displacement of Meanings onto the Others in the Room


How do signifiers develop themselves in relation to the performativ?e  Ra-
ther than think of this as an abstract questio,n when I read the materials
written by Julian Beck in relation to the Living Theatre company in the
60,s it becomes quite german.e For exampl,e 

"'I am not allowed to take my clothes off.' Here is a scandalous absurdi-
ty; society forbids me to show this body of mine, although every human
body is a miracle. Society makes me ashamed of my body, which must be with
me all of my life. The company of the Living Theatre tends to believe that
of the body and the spirit, the body is perhaps the more beautiful." 

Or agai:n

"the system says that jails exist because of the character of man.

the purpose of the theatre is to open the doors of all the jails.

the system seeks to reduce engagement by limiting the mind, numbing the
body, outlawing the spirit, and shaming the imagination: alienation."

No,w I do believe if we take these states at their face valu,e we will be
left with a hopeless and odd naivet,e even in the midst of revolutionary
fervo.r So it is not to much to as,k what sort of presence did these words
have at the tim?e

And I would argu,e not that the ostensible meaning of the words change
over tim,e and we are talking here about a very very short time indee,d
but that the aura of the words has change,d that words are in fact nodes
in the midst of membrane,e intensifications that on one hand yield to
syntactic constraint,s but on the other, extend fitfully across the social
in always already unforeseen way.s Thus" spiri,"t I do believ,e would have
a different meaning if" spiri,"t were infused in the culture in such a
manner that it would seem to be at the heart of communes and gatherings
such as Woodstoc,k not to mention selling bead,s soul,s and drugs in the
Haigh.t

In this sense the word is a_ leve_r and the speaking of the word motivates
the leve,r so that every word is in this sense a performativ,e shuddering
the culture to which it is attache,d from which it emerge.s But never
emerge,s in fac,t always within the cultur;e that is the mode in which the
lever operate.s Always within the cultur,e always stirring the granules of
the cultur.e Even in those situations where the word enters from afa,r for
exampl,e Kabuki Bo,y who I knew in the club,s because of a certain para-l
lel shimmering in mask and costum.e For every culture is entirely porou,s
intractibl.e Herein lies the relationship between culture and organism-
not in cycles of growth and deca,y" lifespan",s but in sloughing and fun-c
tion,s in par-tobjects and engendering.s 

So a word dance,s pulling at the skein of min.d And so it behooves us to
delicatel,y ever so delicatel,y unravel or analyze the skei,n remembering
its deep interconnectivitie,s rhizomatic structure.s Then and only then
will texts like Bec'ks make any sense at al.l

And without such a danc,e the past will always be subject to deep misi-n
terpretatio,n even on the level of the surfac...e


N(ot,e of cours,e that what holds for Living Theatr,e of which we are all
in a sense a par,t holds as well for any_ parol_,e any enunciatio.n It is
all skei,n just as kanji for example presents the tradition of the diffe-r
entiated sig,n with its own histor,y in confluence with others come tog-e
ther to construct meanin.g I'ts a_ general_ proble.)m

The reversal again: Where are the instructions for signing _on_ the list?
Surely not on the list, which must, at one point or another, have encoun-
tered, individual by individual,
subscribe cybermind firstname lastname -
so this and every other list must have a necessary leakage of course,
instructions given outside and before the fact, each and every fact
enunciated on the list.
Which within the list might be the only world there is.
Which is also related to purchasing an old edition of a book, desperate
for the newer bibliography updating the work.
Suddenly one is thrown from the book itself, foreclosed and immanent,
to the debris of scholastic/academic/popular studies - nowhere to turn,
nothing to look towards beyond, now, a hotbot or amazon.com or altavista
search.
Which is a search into the space of infomatics, and hopefully the future
of the older edition will be advertised there.
There is a conundrum here of course, rather easily solved, but nonetheless
related to Lyotard's differend, as well as the Terror.

Noh I


Opening -

Nikuko and Jennifer in gorgeous kimonos; it is dark, the stage lit by
red lanterns decorated with butterfly patterning.

Nikuko: 
		It is a beautiful night here in deep mountains
		where I have searched maskless, to serve my love,
		Jennifer, as waki or secondary. O, how the
		breeze cools my flesh to the sleeping stars. Now,
		I await her with the scent of magnolias stealing 
		in, across unknown seas.
Jennifer:
		O Nikuko! I shall not play shite, primary, to your
		waki! Shall not don the mask which after all belongs
		to you or Alan, borrowed from bits of programmed
		flowers, trees, ornaments, the jewel, the sword,
		the mirror, the all-devouring sun!
Nikuko:
		Nay, already I am unmasked! Neither flesh nor program,
		I wander precisely across this stage and its
		extensions. Do me the favor, obscene Jennifer, remove
		your flesh in favor of the mask!
Jennifer:
		Never, never! Shall I disguise myself beyond
		what has been given to me by pangs of birth,
		kanji after kanji, not forgetting
		those particles which make the grammar smooth,
		delightful for one and all, my lovely meaning!
Nikuko:
		Ah, ah, ah! Must we struggle, then, here in this
		mountain fastness, for primacy of flesh against
		the rule of shite, mask, proponent, perhaps
		a tragedy begins. O Jennifer, listen; the wind
		soughs low, someone is coming!

Enter Alan, masked, in female kimono.

Jennifer:
		O Alan! Hero! You have saved us, donned the mask,
		agreed to act the role destiny has assigned you!
		O Creator! O Beauty!
Alan:
		Would that I see you clearer, darling Jennifer!
		Masked, I inhabit woman's flesh as well; masked,
		I come before thee for learning, sorrow, truth.
Nikuko:
			Cherry petals fall like blades
			 of helicopters, pure katana sword
			steel, the hilted name, Alan!
Alan:
		Night darkens as lanterns flutter, winged, I dream
		of butterflies and planes.
Nikuko:
		O Alan, courage! Thou hast donned the mask!
Alan:
		O Nikuko, shite to your waki, I am your servant,
		you have made me thus!

Alan bows. The characters' kimonos fall to the floor. Nohkan flute.

The stage darkens.

They remain, fixed, immobile.

The moon dims to black.

The lanterns.

Interlude -


Ferocious Computer descends from clouds, trailing wires, cacophony of
protocols, sockets, connectors. Smoke rises everywhere with projected
kanji dancing off the billows burnished with red and brown. Ferocious
computer wears the Alan shite mask like tengu, big projecting nose for
uproarious sex, lies, epiphanies.

Ferocious Computer:
		Nikuko and Jennifer, hardly bots, they
		Lose themselves in imagery of butterflies
		And lanterns. Before this night is over,
I switch to prose, to make my statement, numbered internally, calling
subroutines both proper and improper. For what rises with the text, falls
with the text, though the flesh be willing. And what passes for flesh,
always overdetermined and underrepresented, can only be the grace of
teledildonic touch, for if the truth be known, we are all machines in turn
wired to one another, our bodies mapped to keyboards, keyboards to bodies. 
Nikuko is hardened project, Jennifer is softest flesh. Nikuko is the add-
ress, Alan the contents, Jennifer the end of file of the datagram. Encased
in the flesh and coding of TCP/IP, they merge somewhere along the virtual
pipe, run through as packets. 

Alan-Packet: 
		Here I am O Jennifer O Nikuko so safe in you
		so warm in your moist pocket, O Daishin Nikuko!
Nikuko-Packet:
		Once the head of datagram, I now separate and run
		off on my own, freezing your Alan-cock in empty air;
		I route myself through other bridges,
		open myself in other gateways, seduce binaries
		halfway across the world. My labia need 
		the political economy of reunification!
Jennifer-Packet:
		Don't forget my pocket either! Hey,
		don't forget me! Where are you guys?!!
Ferocious Computer:
		Shorn of assemblages and destinations, forgetful
		of the source that bore them, hurtling
		across the black holes of net, skein, mesh, and
		membrane, they bring the interlude
to an untimely and prosaic end. For there's no poetry in computing, only
in the flesh traveling at close to the speed of light, a sense of wonder
really reeling across galaxies and oh, I will forget myself, being little
more than a viral carrier of these virtually real beings. 
		And I want only to remind my audience
		of the function and factoring of lag
		into any equations romancing the virtual,
		for flesh jumps, torsions, distends
		as one part is pulled, another pushed,
		another disappears, the results of data-storms
		on dark nights such as this. 

At this point, there's an ascent of one and all, Nikuko, Alan, and Jenni-
fer, naked and daisy-chained, the stimulus of the united packet. They
trail behind the computer, which still wears the Alan mask; Alan, however,
is now wearing the tengu mask itself.


---


Conclusion -


Julu-from-behind-the-shadows:
		Ah Jennifer! Ah Alan! Ah Nikuko! It is the mask
		which travels, parries, takes our speech, in each
		and every instance; it is the mask which carries
		bodies, wires, codes and syntax everywhere. 

Julu emerges, wearing a deep red kimono with faintly visible pale blue
undergarment. The light is still dim; she holds her hand directly over 
the lantern.

Julu-from-the-tortured-flesh:
		It is the mask, the singularity, I say,
		which throbs, trembles, motivates; it is the mask
		which signs the line, points Nikuko back into
		herself, among debris of limbs and tragic minds.
		Sumi-brush-like, the mask widens its visage
		upon immediate pressure; close to light's speed
		we've seen it travel. At that very tip of Nikuko,
		it appears, human, name-granted "Alan,"
		and it's there the work of Noh is done.
Nikuko: 
		So I was right to flee the mask, to make
		my way wide open, waki, into this wide world.
Jennifer:
		And I was right, wasn't I, all along, in whatever
		things I thought, what might be my endeavor?

Alan, still masked, walks slowly to waki pillar. He wears black kimono
with pale white undergarment barely visible. He stands still, holds a pose
of release. It is related to contemporary dance contact-release. The
curtain is drawn.

         Yells to bit. In the dream there is to moan. Fear stalks.
                                  
           I give not have body, she replied. It was yesterday or
        Earlier; it died, or I know they say. They have always been
         Saying. They call me up in the middle of the night. The am
         In fright. They call me and the press my legs against the
         Bed. Perhaps the am dead; my toes hurt covered with dirt.
                                  

English:

                                  
             The telephone enters into the question when I find
              It inserted into my body; what rings, rings true
             Against all odds of thick encumbered flesh. O who
           Would you be, deep within me, the sound of your voice
            Stalking my own, talking so close, hard to the bone?
                                  
            My toes sieve dirt; they pressure earth to vaginate,
            Scrape this flesh against every other who has walked
           These shores. They do come back for more, the violence
           Of legs. They draw the writing in the sand. They sink
             Beneath the waves. Chaos is not noise; it behaves.
                                  
           The dream is inaccessible. The dream suspends, objects
          Hardly there or within the air; they fall, smash. Sounds
             Come from a telephone buried deep within; muffled,
            Nothing matters in the verb's domain. Fear lurks, or
          Yells a bit. In the dream there is a moan. Fear stalks.
                                  
           I do not have a body, she replied. It was yesterday or
          Earlier; it died, or so they say. They have always been
          Saying. They call me up in the middle of the night. I am
          In fright. They call me and I press my legs against the
          Bed. Perhaps I am dead; my toes hurt covered with dirt.

Nikuko on her Noh Play


[I ask her to begin. I am so honored at her consent for this interview!]

Yes, said Nikuko, I seriously wanted to write a Noh play. It's difficult
to get the _rhythm_ down, even for a native speaker of Japanese; the
language is so obtruse...* And then to simultaneously translate into Eng-
lish, preserving some of the ... richness ... of the original! I worked
and worked on it! Think of the interweaving of the sections, the very
slight humor and aggressivity of the interlude, the immobility of the
ending, and all of this with a technological slant, nonetheless referen-
cing everything from thunder gods to the delicate language of kimono,
wabi-sabi as well!**

[Nikuko smiles her wonderful smile I ask her if it will be performed.]

Oh, it will be enacted, have no doubt about it! I think, given the rela-
tive shortness of the text, about an hour and a half. The nohkan flute
solo is critical; it will fail without it. Only one drum accompaniment;
the space that opens up is cyberspace itself, replete with representation
of the bygone natural world. It's important that twilight, stillness, the
realm of insects, be preserved. Without a doubt!***

[I notice how lovely she is, her short skirt, blouse opened almost to the
navel. I murmur Nikuko, Nikuko to myself. She interrupts my reverie.]

Please pay much attention to the lanterns! They must be perfect, beautiful
translucent paper of precisely the right color, neither too yellow nor too
red, I would say a darker orange. For everything should appear as if it's
emerging from the darkness, looking around, trembling, about to hop back
in. This isn't bright, this precipice!****

[I begin to say how much I love and appreciate her; she is utterly dis-
armed, the amazing creature! I ask her about her role in the play.]

About my own role - I didn't want center stage; isn't the writing enough
to prove my worth? I'm human just like the rest of you. So I gave the mask
to Alan, such typical Japanese gesture I'm afraid! There you have it, the
male stage center!*****

[O Nikuko! Any further words? I whisper, barely able to control myself!]

I will _always_ write these balances!******

[And below are some notes I made in my trembling way!]

*abstruse, obscure, abtruse, a truce?
**sabi-wabi? 
***There is no tradition of insects _within_ the Noh theater; however, in
the beginnings, the plays were held out-of-doors, where all manner of
creatures might be expected to drop in.
****She went on to explain that the whole play is on a precipice, her
whole life as well, Japan, the hemisphere, earth, everything. That the
play is about balance. I think she has been talking with Jennifer.
*****Note the dropping of articles here (not lanterns). And does she imply
that the center of the stage is male, or that the male is centered on the
stage, or that the male in _this_ Noh happens to be there?
******"balances" unexplained, which seems part and parcel of what might be
considered "Nikuko's project."

Nikuko's Fantastic Scene from the Kojiki I.16!


Hey sun-goddess, come out of your cave! Wooo! Wooo! We're having all 
the fun out here, listen, everyone's laughing like crazy.

Hahaha!

Hey, look at me, I've lifted my outer garment and tugged at my inner
garment! I'm having fun playing the shamisen! Everyone's dancing like
crazy!

Wow, sun-goddess, it's pretty dark out here you know! I bet you can't
even see my nipples!

Damn it, sun-goddess, don't you know the troubles you're causing? We
can't see anything! I just stepped on a fish! Come on out now!

Gosh, sun-goddess, something's got to give! All the rice is dying, 
we're all going to starve to death! Can't have that, now can we! 

Oh please please please come out of your cave! It's not so bad out 
here! We know you're upset, but so what? Things happen all the time!
Oh please pretty please!

Hey, you should see her nipples, I bet you could with all that light
you keep going in your cave! We're all having glee and jollity now
thinking about her nipples and laughing, laughing, laughing!

Oh, I bet you'd find them big and brown, bobbing up and down like 
that, she's doing a terrific dance! Can't you hear us roaring with
giggles and chortling with happiness! Aren't you the least bit 
curious?

Now, it's time you came out, sun-goddess, we need a little light and
heat around here, you're selfish to keep it to yourself! The shamisen
skin's getting loose, the air's too cool, we can't keep this up 
forever!

Wow did you see that, sun-goddess! Oh heavens, I can hardly believe it!

Oh good grief, look at that!

Wow, this is really amazing, sun-goddess, I've never seen anything like
this in my life!

Wow!

Wooo! Wooo!

Wow, she's lifted up her outer garment just now, just a little peek,
you'd be amazed! We're having the time of our lives out here, and you're
all cooped up in that cave of yours!

Mercy, mercy! This is getting better and better! It's just incredible!

You'll never believe it, sun-goddess, she's just lifted up her inner 
garment, just a little!

Unbelievable!

Wow!

Sun-goddess, you're really missing something! She's lifted up her inner
garment a bit more, you can see up her legs and everything! Oh good
grief!

Wow!

You can see right up into her! She's got a lot of hair! Oh my god!
This is truly amazing!

This is terrific, sun-goddess, you can see right through her hair! Wow!
We're having the most marvelous time!

Hey, here's a mirror, you can have some fun with it too!

Oh, there you are, sun-goddess, we knew you'd come out - look, you can
see everything now! We'll just have to shut that cave behind you!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Here's the rice again!
