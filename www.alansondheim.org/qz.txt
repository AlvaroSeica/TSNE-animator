I write myself into existence and so Im here for you.
I write myself out of existence, too bad.
Third sex and the ascii unconscious: let me be-cum you.
Im imagining you listening to me.
Im imagining you whispering to me, whispering to me.
Im no longer a guest, I whisper back to you. When Im done, Ill disappear 
forever.
Flattened against the screen, I recognize you, reflected c--- shunted 
against the words.
But then. But then theres a forest; Heidegger weeps in the forest. 
Heidegger waits and waits, no one cums along the lonely path. He crosses 
the bridges, the routers, the backbones through the landscape of the Net. 
He writes his first post, about violation fabric.
I wander through his post. Im the vowel, the umlaut, the dia/critical mark 
holding everything together. Im always begging. My words spew on the 
screen. Your response is an emission; the stream rises from the forest, 
floods everything in its /path/home/sondheim. No reply, I rm myself. What 
the shell closes, cuts down, is the future.
My last words: I am your future.



Idle Days

http://www.alansondheim.org/idledays.mp4

Of stuttering or lapsing into what I call idle conversation, relating man- 
ipulation; released, they result in idle chatter dominated by prebody in 
idle conversation's midst, cliffs and peaks of some dark yellowed form of 
folds, eccentric spaces, idle conversation, fractality. The form of the 
Word, and by "yammering," I mean idle chatter, hrrrumphs, hmmmm, all 
these: scuz sewage guano gum gumbo gunk idle linger shriek sibilate! scuz 
sewage guano gum gumbo gunk idle linger shriek sibilate!!! But actually 
what I have to say is not mere idle speculation!

And bound to follow it, that's why it's not the Word - and by "yammering," 
I mean	User     tty       login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  - What?!
Are there no idle conversations? She continues in a state of denial!

What turned her off is idle time, remission, server disconnects around her 
bed. The sores turned her soul bitter; why is there no idle thought in the 
book of thinking, that realm of fictitious heated passion? These aren't 
idle questions; they pertain to the heart of dreams, more than idle 
chatter.

Generations and genealogies, but the small-talk, the idle talk - it's 
speculation's stand, proof of the existence of the idle mind. These are 
questions at the heart of the encounter, of withdrawn vigilence. The 
question itself is drawn forth, speech is an idle squawk - after menses or 
semen, the body's randomly flickering in idle chatter. Idly asked, these 
aren't idle questions.

"'Alan,' Azure said, 'We can take the lower road.' 

"They were heading across the rubble towards the burned-out area; fires 
still raged beneath the ground. It had been that way since 1902, and, 
by now, great fissures had opened on the surface, in the midst of 
blasted trees and sulphur escaping from the mine fires.

"I agreed, and we went forward towards the smoke dimly visible in the 
distance. The disturbance was clear, was clearer.

"(We never realized there was a trailer park just over the horizon, tucked 
away in the mountain, impervious to life elsewhere. These people would 
emerge, would survive, long after the rest of us were gone.)"

My Day on the Way to Pittsburgh

I caught this morning, morning's minion
Who saw something as beautiful as a tree,
While listening to the moaning in the bar,
Around eleven, crying Nevermore.
Alas, my country, it's of you,
Whose love is like a bed, arose, 
And if you keep your wits and shout about you,
I'll count the ways your wits do flout and clout you.
The old order changeth, make a gnu anew
The barroom's floor's face's cover's is glue.
This isn't your parent's poem, mind you,
Our future's in you, shoved up tight with rue.
Forget everything we ever told you,
We're going to rock your rocks off into the night.
So what? this morning, caught the Morning Minion,
Calculated tree and moaning rose and cried.
That's about it, caught the 1:31, read the Onion,
Slept a bit, arrived, survived.



were i

edge phenomena on a shore occasioned by alpha layer shutdown
but avatar can't go any farther just being there is enough for hir
if i were that avatar i'd go farther if i could
but then i'm restless not like that avatar not at all

http://www.alansondheim.org/ontheshore.mov

abjection awaits the avatar at the shore
at the edge the body disperses but comes together again in the suture
just for a moment it swarms corrupting ontology
then it returns with a name corrupting epistemology

the shore is not there but reigns above the aegis of the rocky crags
the water is virtual to the crags virtual to the real off a rocky coast
were s/he to emerge s/he might do the damage of uncorruptible truth
bury the rocky coast and forget hir wayward ways




The Thought about the Wayward: You're dealing with wayward Jennifer


   while wayward Lucy screams and Jenny, nude, defends;
 of nodes and vectors is in my wayward closet of attachments and parts
 the contradictory transformed into the contrary or wayward.
"I do sit here and type, wayward on the plane, contrary on the ground, 
"sleazy",:"wayward", "nice", "feminine", "lovely", "used", "fashionable",
"wayward", "nice", "feminine", "lovely", "used", "fashionable", "small",
and there i do bind this wayward drowning angel
and the abject other is simultaneously wayward and abject -

Alan Dojoji: And we are wayward,
And beyond the wayward is Jennifer wayward.
Can you not see that I was disheveled in the cavern, wild and wayward in
wanton frock and wayward Jennifer?
Devour wayward TINA! Julu-of-the Partying Neat-O!!
Experiments go awry or wayward, changes damage or destroy objects, some 
hurtling through space on a wayward planet, we were born, not in the
wayward Latitudes.
I loan my frock to Julu, that is why I am called wayward.
I say that Nikuko says I am contrary, wayward, your logic does not apply.
Jennifer's mouth runs, Jennifer runs on Askhir, Nikuko says "wayward", 
and light and sound make wayward shows.
and even light sound make wayward shows.

Like an arrow or pivot in the wayward moonlit sky, the sheer spear-hawk
Nikuko says, I am contrary, I am wayward, your logic does not apply.
And says, you are dismembered, wayward, your logic does not work.
Soiled Death: You're dealing with wayward Jennifer!
This is the smallest conceivable way to waylay the wayward viewer. 

Unruly, variegated, wayward, Nikuko and Jennifer and Julu have been
called, and when I am called, I am called wayward little girl.
When I am towards the sun, I am wayward. 
You're an intensive movement. You're wayward. You veer from 0 to 1. 
You, you're dealing with wayward Jennifer.
Your small tables of nodes and vectors is in my wayward closet of 
your wayward Hat! and is in my giving Bra!
Your wayward TINA! is my lovely MADONNA!
Your wayward of the elementals is in my psychotic of the lost ninety-two!

Ah, a contrary or wayward book, self-contrary, asking nothing - a gap or 
hiatus. wayward or contrary characters. of the harshness of the ikonic 
body, wayward, out of control with itself. And wayward matter, isn't 
quite.

Angrily clothed, wayward, contrary or a brat! And the X is where that spot
is wayward,, we are rerung all, not drunk, it wears us like you
arrive from somewhere else, wayward and untoward ontology underneath the 
artifactual. wayward theory. uses tools effects. unlike books ding chairs 
asking, wayward. azure-ectoplasm or the remains of wayward slaughter.
before eyes; mocked wayward Madonna strugging keep apart.  quiet nice kind
but creates the _contrary,_ in the sense of someone _contrary or wayward,_
but homeless it is, wayward it is, almost.

by a notion of wandering and following, of waywardness as being you
capture equipment, inconceivable/untoward/wayward/contrary gestures and 
you come drawn further in, the _wayward_ or _contrary_ body-in-motion,
contradictory transformed into the contrary or wayward,
just as contradictory wayward is really fucked up and
contrary, wayward, wandering, ill, uneasy, spry, florid, edgy, neurotic,
and then death, the dust, time tangled in hir wayward lightning.

extrinsic - a deeper waywardness, redolent of desire, than alphabetic 
eyes; I was mocked like a wayward Madonna strugging to keep her legs 
failing, this inability to continue, this waywardness, contrariness. for a 
ragged presence run amuck, wayward, back again with the doubling of 
producition, untoward, but as if it possessed a kind of man or in there is 
the contrary or wayward woman, an etiquette doubly problematic - the 
melt-body:cold-body:gone-body:suck:wayward:345:6:dog-boy:suck:gone-body: 
black amethyst is in my wayward quartz.

mine, major roles then nothing, as in a contrary or wayward person, as in
most wayward of cousins, and all of this occurs on the plane of language/
music, internal rhythms and the sloshing of bloods - wayward, contrary.

nikuko wayward among the nebulae and virtual-particles
inhabits the contrary. i will not have arctic sickness nor will i. then
nowhere, homeless or abandoned language, nomadic or contrary or the
wayward of the unobtained, incontrovertible, contrary, fused like 
one but (flesh) adjacent to the terminal (unscreened), 
a wayward thought, contrary to your desires, occurs just there,
or another wayward or contrary way. landscapes lead toward coagulation of
contradiction; obscenity occurs within the Sheffer stroke and she
patted her frock lock. O wayward! Her feet bicycled the air. Her feet
danced all out of order, software's accidents renewing wayward beauty.

speculatively wayward world-making, virtual worlds not as a subject for 
zero tolerance mapping. think of the pan-material world. Otherwise, 
inscription is vagrant, wayward. For everything, always the eroticism of 
sleaziness. Is this the sip, the slip, or the the ship, now wayward, 
heading chaotically towards the earth's rim. It arrives from somewhere 
else, wayward and untoward ontology and the crafty smile.

If the net is contrary and wayward, it is also VIOLATED. The fallen angel!
to love someone is to follow him in her wayward choices and not be afraid!
Angels: They are more contrary or wayward than contradictory! Vagaries!

O wayward
O wayward  nice  feminine  lovely  used  fashionable  small
O wayward and shameless and the new Clar cleared out!
O wayward face to alt-config sun's wayward shadow's cast!
O wayward in curved space, flesh and bodies transported! 
O wayward, contradiction; obscenity occurs!
O wayward, refusal of the body, just as death is refuse and refuge! 
O wayward. When the sun is towards me, I am Jennifer!

Waywardness as Being which splits, turns back on itself, contradicts 
itself, turns _wayward_ wild and wayward, contrary, a potential well or 
sink or source of her world - they're wayward, contrary. They don't face 
anything, their work has always been 'wayward,' disruptive, contrary, and 
off-and-on like my own: it is unbecoming, wayward, contrary, sassy; it 
speaks.

Talk on electronic literature at WVU, CLC, April 18, 2011

http://www.alansondheim.org/wvutalk.mp3

Disclaimer: Lots of facts wrong, forgot to mention a lot of people, very 
tired when speaking, broke into giggles, want to thank everyone for 
tolerating me, apologies if you're forgotten, I really was serious, had 
something to eat, was improvised with projections from texts and a brief 
encounter with Second Life, tried to make "eye contact" with the audience, 
think maybe it was "I contact," messed up a bit on the files, got more 
facts wrong, people encouraging giggling, went really well.

Vea, Crying Out

cry out or out-mourning, film stills when i close my eyes
it's getting there, the community of mouths open to the sky,
the community of eyes wide open or closed against the film of the sky.

this is the oral stage, the oral staged, the oral on stage.
the oral brackets the world, pole and polar.
the oral swallows the world, now if i were not telling a truth.
the truth swallows the oral, the world swallows the oral and the truth.
the world swallows the world and shimmers, shudders, splits from the 
world.
this is the world and the splitting of the world.
the world splits into sheaves of time and space, you can't touch them.
you can't touch them but here you can touch them.
you can see them here too.

this is the trope of 'false seeing,' 'you can see them here too.'

and soon text and soon structures cry out, 
structures cry out through the text,
they cry out, they do not want to die,
they want to remain open and supine, 
you may read them and write them,
you may harbor thoughts among them, and others,
others may harbor thoughts,
and others beyond others, and many places,
or none at all, or all, or all at once,
these cryings out among our universe,
i would like to say, these are our signature,
and theirs, and others, our universe remembered
for its crying out,

=========================================================================

Insoluble Cases 

=========================================================================

I've just solved the case: Here's how it happened. (Monk)

I began by thinking of the collapse of books, literature, theory: not of 
carry-over and interoperability among file formats, electronic productions 
or reproductions, but of the splitting and fragmentation of text and 
theory, the reduction to what I've considered elsewhere as radiations and 
dusts. Thus fundamental physical theory might just reduce to competing 
structures producing equivalent, if not identical results; in which case, 
the concept of the fundamental becomes moot through its splitting into 
entangled at the top, but deeply incompatible at the bottom, predictive 
and coherent constructs. So it goes, just as video, for example, has 
abandoned long-form for splits and bites/sound-bites that will continue to 
shrink. The world's buzzing confusing itself coheres and continues to grow 
and every genre, form, classicism, or medium disappears; even the voice 
channels into text, text into abbreviations, abbreviations into augments, 
augments into part-objects, all against and within the massive violence 
and poverty of the coming-to-age-and-end of a species literally dying for 
a singularity, other than dying.

Consider new media, practices shadowed by their own future anteriors, 
constant redefinitions and tropes from simulacra through vectors and 
speed, back into the forests of signs and spectacles. Everything is plural 
and always already has been, which cripples the monotheisms of explana- 
tions, explanatory power, and the power that pervades them. Power is 
always a becoming, a leverage; now and forever, power splatters among 
gangs, hackers, corporations, languages, exploits, patches - and patches 
themselves are the new sutures, designed, not to hold subject or subject- 
ivity together, but to bridge monetary gaps in structures ultimately 
doomed to obsolescence or collapse. I've thought long about this, about 
the idea about this and about ideas and idea; these thoughts as well 
transform, are transformed, through radiations. Think of such as literal: 
how much gadgetry now speaks to itself through collocations and designated 
bandwidths, just on the desk or threshold? And think of such as content, 
not in the sense of McLuhanesque media, but in the dissolution of such 
media, everything parceling within electromagnetic spectra that begins and 
ends, usually, with something physical, some manifestation of receiving/ 
receiver and transmitting/transmitter. Think further, transmissions of 
receivers, receivers of transmitters, transmissions of transmitters; you 
get the idea, get hold of the idea, and the idea bifurcates chaotically; 
in the end you get nothing, you're swallowed by the waves, by the 
particles constantly in circulation. There's no room for the strictures of 
genre here, for the long-form that's already rusting, corroding at the 
ends, at both ends, throughout the long-form which requires patience, 
silent, and grounding that's inconceivable at this point/plane/dimension. 
For the long-form needs stability just like accountancy; it's the world of 
classical economy, classical accountancy; it requires memory and the 
stability of memory, things that can't, ever, be hacked, things that one 
can return to, two or three hundred pages or notes earlier; this isn't the 
case (for that matter/s, the world is no longer the case/s, if it/they 
ever were) - these arguments and edifices that built up, that led nowhere, 
that promised monotheisms, monotheories, that carefully laid themselves 
out (when not laying bodies) - these buried their internal violence, 
excreted it out the other end. All, everything here, requiring a respite 
from slaughter, extinctions, exponentially-increasing populations on the 
fast-track, these intrusions into the social, which now constitute the 
socials: the strings of the world are pulled by children, and the 
children's children, and ultimately nothing else matters. The children too 
dissolve into radiations and dusts, Fukushima and Chernobyl, but also the 
scatterings of local wars, gang insignia, temporary autonomous zones with 
a vengeance. There are pollutions, mostly invisible, everywhere, permeat- 
ing the world with the stench of death always already disappearing before 
it's presence is felt; we're all embedded like journalists in guerilla 
operations among the enclaves of a collapsing planet. It's too late for 
anything else, but it was always too late; we lived in momentary stases - 
of goods, apparently stable economies and weather patterns, that are once 
again on the fast-forward track. Our books, films, symphonies, portend the 
culture of death which inheres within them. We're watching ourselves 
disappear, and this isn't towards the prosthetic or viral, but rather the 
prion or unstable nanobots: as the atmosphere turns against us, nothing 
happens but fundamental ontology that mirrors and collapses within itself. 
And that's everything - in a sense, what used to be called 'anomie,' as 
long as anomie hearkened back to an inconceivable, inauthentic Eden of 
coherency that never existed in the first or any other place. Think of the 
anomie of anomie, anomie as nothing but the word itself, the inscription 
that's half read, half-disappeared, transformed by the fall of internal 
empires that still seem to hold us as one, together, or in multiplicities, 
or whatever groupings you might think still hold within occasional dream- 
ing. Whatever else, culture appeared thick, with inconceivable depth - 
this is the Castanedan theater, or the primordial or the aboriginal 
habitus, epics and virtual worlds emerging out of it, oral traditions 
miraculously holding forth for generations and so on. We believed that, 
just as we believed the moment from oral to written or written to oral, or 
the primacy of inscription or of things, or of orderings, or of axiomatics 
- even those that were admittedly insecure at the edges, Godel numberings 
for example tending towards the disappearance of moorings. See what can be 
accomplished at a distance, through a telescope or prime number investi- 
gations, but then there are always the problematics of other number 
systems, multiverses, families dangerous and out of control just the next 
block over. The thick was always a sheave, was always abject, always 
required control. Culture not only buried abjection; it consolidated the 
thing floating on top of the muck, cleaned off the shitty bottom. It 
answered, it had answers, if only anti-oedipal. But abjection comes with 
the corpses of extinctions, with local wars, hacking, pollutions. But no, 
it doesn't come with these at all; it's always been there, what's been 
fundamental are the dusts, the pollutions, the radiations, the muck that 
Plato wanted to bury, that D&G dug up again and rubbed in our faces: now 
those faces are gone as well. 

So the ontology, the epistemology, the ontic, the episteme, dissolve, and 
there is no yielding to a new order, though there might be chaos. I think 
of this as 'neither A nor B,' 'not both A and B,' dual and Sheffer-stroke 
lending themselves towards Pales of no concern, maybe A and B just go out 
like lights, maybe they disappear, maybe they were never there in the 
first place, maybe they're our dream of stability. How simple it all seems 
until we look for constant, the thick again, so we can speak, make sense, 
as if it were more than possible to make sense for more than a little 
while, more than the occasion on the corner, the chance meeting, the 
unknown disease or bullet fired in the dark. All of this is up for grabs, 
sites/cites/sights of contestation, but it should be clear by now that 
contestation itself, on local and global levels, among tendrils and 
temporary holarchies, is what roils, what roils within the abject, what 
provides no clear footings, anymore than currency or human exchanges. 
Things are beginning to run out; more likely than not, the singularity 
will be one of scarcity, not the fecundity of technological answers that 
promise immortality to those enclaved lucky few able to afford them. It's 
just a matter of time before immortality as well is swallowed up; even 
cryogenics depends upon the thick, upon basic stabilities, in order to 
propagate itself and the species with the wealthy few. 

So we're left scattered among augmentations, inscriptions, the arrogance 
of chic - and among inconceivable pain and beauty as, not only empires, 
but the very elements of culture dissolve. And we can discuss these 
things; if social networking is the current paradigm, the radiations and 
problematic of paradigms will leave us for some brief moments when we 
might pick up a book, for example, just to feel the weight of it. But more 
likely we'll be listening to tunes of our own mirrored creations, as long 
as the power stays on. (Wait, this isn't right here, this trope.) There 
won't be tunes or books; there might be implants. They might last for a 
while. There might be fetishisms of all sorts, driven not by power, but by 
Lingis' lust, abject and oozing. There might be splits. There will be 
scarcity. There won't be long-form. There will be momentary stases, 
strange attractors. There won't be life-spans; there will be fallout. 
Dusts never die, carry no information, infiltrate driven by no will of 
their own or anyone's. They increase. The appearance of the future of the 
world is Maya. The future of the world is graffiti. That's where it will 
happen, the warnings to vacate the area, that something poisonous and 
deadly is just around the corner. That's where the thick ends up - with 
such unspeakable pain, with such death, that words not only fail - they 
never existed in the first place. And not even that's guaranteed.

Phenomenological History of the World

	"Are you also puzzled, Socrates, about cases that might be thought 
absurd, such as hair or mud or dirt or any other trivial and undignified 
objects? Are you doubtful whether or not to assert that each of these has 
a separate form distinct from things like those we handle?
	"Not at all, said Socrates, In these cases the things are just the 
things we see; it would surely be too absurd to suppose that they have a 
form. All the same, I have sometimes been troubled by a doubt whether what 
is true in one case may not be true in all. Then, when I have reached that 
point, I am driven to retreat, for fear of tumbling into a bottomless pit 
of nonsense. Anyhow, I get back to the things which we were just now 
speaking of as having forms, and occupy my time with thinking about them.
	"That, replied Parmenides, is because you are still young, 
Socrates, and philosophy has not yet taken hold of you so firmly as I 
believe it will someday. You will not despise any of these objects then, 
but at present your youth makes you still pay attention to what the world 
will think." ...

Plato, Parmenides, 130 c-e, trans. Cornford.

Uncomfortable notes on the poetics of captured human behavior:

[for Epoetry 2011]

motion-captured/motion-transformed/behavior-modification:
poetics of movement: vocabulary of movement:

{range of human actions, Laban A} >T> {unlimited range of actions B}
A bound by skeletal connectivity, Jordan surfaces; 
B bound by skeletal connectivity, twisted/tangled surfaces
in other words the links in B can bend in any direction;
the links in A are confined by human skeletal potentials + topology
 (topological embedding in four dimensions):
 think of this as a tensor calculus of human movement
 think of this as a topography of flesh and sinew
Ruptures in the calculus:
 the tortured or wounded body
 the body convulsed in pain
 the catatonic body
 the terrorized body
 the broken or 'defective' body
Ruptures through the imaginary:
 the nightmare
 the orgasm
 hysteria/ boundaries of laughing and crying
 the confined body/ body of s/m
 the forgotten or abandoned body
 the hyper-sexualized body transmitters/ receivers
 hallucinations and other phenomena (Dendy's Philosophy of Mystery)
Ruptures of the body invaded by capital:
 prosthetics
 X-scopic surgeries
 rfid implants
Ruptures of the body invaded by the imaginary:
 (capital of the imaginary, imaginary capital)
 psycho-tropics/overdetermined associations/disassociations
Ruptures of the body by an augmented real:
 sports, steroids, body-building, and so forth

Invasions of the imaginary, invasions of capital, of the augmented real,
 invasions through the imaginary: invasions or invaginations, 
 incorporations or intensifications? These terms entangle and return to:

Either the proper body, or the body as heap;
 the articulated body, or the dismembered and reassembled body;
 the body characterized by a real, or the body chararacterized 
 by an imaginary;
either the fundamental topography of the body, 
 or the fundamental topology of the body -  invasions, dissolutions,
 ruptures.
Ruptures as returns of the repressed: 
What lexicons are at work? What economies?

What is it that motion capture captures? What is snared, what abandoned?
What is the vocabulary of behavioral dynamics  voluntary, autonomic,
 involuntary, intrinsic  or involuntary, anomalous and axiomatic, 
 extrinsic?
In other words: What's going on with us, within and without the world?



Uncomfortable notes on the poetics of captured human behavior: 
Part 2: the Wringing:

Laban, in Modern Educational Dance, distinguishes ``eight basic efforts'':
Wring, Press, Glide, Float, Flick, Slash, Punch, Dab. ``Each of these 
efforts contains three of the six movement elements: strong, light, 
sustained, quick, direct, flexible.'' Four of the group are strong: Slash, 
Wring, Press, and Punch. Wring and Press reconfigure the avatar; Press 
preserves both topology and topography, but Wring transforms at least the 
latter.

Wringing slides one against another, in combination with pressure: 
Wringing distorts the body. With physical bodies, wringing breaks 
connections (slashing can also break connections).

The wrung body, the hobbled body. Wringing occurs when the body is 
simultaneously twisted and restrained.

Gravity restrains and locates the body. With mocap, gravity may be 
'eliminated' through the use of harnesses, or through edge phenomena 
that carry the body elsewhere.

The heaped or pressed body: the body as thing, as material: the body of 
the slave (wrung from and within capital, wrung from the socius).

From the viewpoint of capital, of war, the dehistoricized body - the body 
becoming element or token, demarcation of nothing but position, mined for 
its materiality.

The finality of the dancing body, the dance of death - the heaps of 
Rwanda, Auschwitz, Abu Gharayb.

Similarity, in the world of the simulacrum, the disappearing body: 
Argentina, U.S. prisons.

Not similarity: the world of the (natural) catastrophe, the disaster: the 
heaped body, but the body (perhaps) recuperated for/within history.

One might think through all of this as the historiography of the body. 
Where do we go from here?


Uncomfortable notes on the poetics of captured human behavior: Part 3:
the Wringing: Part 2:

V. WRINGING.

wringing--is flexible, sustained, strong.

Wringing can vary from a pulling to a twisting movement,and is felt more 
easily in the shoulders, arms and hands than in the hips and legs. The 
feeling of strength must not be lost, as the slow muscular resistance felt 
in pressing is also present in this effort, but wringing produces a 
different sensation as the joints move more flexibly.

At first, wringing should be felt in the hands, as in wringing out 
clothes, and then extended, using different parts of the body. The whole 
body can be set into a wringing motion--for example in yawning.

Wringing movements of the arms can be directed into various zones, the 
most important as far as exercises are concerned being down forwards 
outwards, but there are many possibilities--with each arm separately, or 
both together, wringing downwards, upwards, across, sideways, forwards and 
backwards, extending into space in all directions.

Wringing should also be experienced in other parts of the body, such as 
the shoulders, trunk, hips, legs, not only extending into space away from 
the body, but towards it. Other possible variations are wringing simultan- 
eously with both arms in different directions, or wringing with different 
parts of the body into various directions; for example, wringing the trunk 
in a backwards-bending movement and doing the same action with arms 
sideways high, _et cetera._

[...]

"Indulging with" Space and Time, and "fighting against" Weight, which is 
the essence of wringing, develops a valuable control and gives and 
entirely different movement-experience from that gained by doing simple 
twisting exercises. The counter-tensions involved produce a different kind 
of bound flexibility from that met with in any other form of physical 
activity.

(Rudolf Laban, Modern Educational Dance, 1948, pp. 63-65.)



cauterization of the sublime

http://www.alansondheim.org/ikantsee.mov

and of the sublime?

The sublime, the infinite, remains. Life is a narrow-bandwidth "I sleep in 
sublime unconcern for the words which wander abroad, whilst I think of the 
cliff of whispers." sublime beauty, herself oozed among signifiers, grap- 
pled by Nikuko-hands, the sublime child through the romantic clef to the 
sonorous echo, through dark virtue.

at long last, last sublime. what next. death is always the ruin of the 
world, the world's ruin. For we are within this era, this positioning, 
dulled, imploded, but never this ecstasy or indefinite sublime which 
remains unreachable.

inheres to the analogic; the digital decathects the sublime; the analogic 
decathects the digital; the analogic decathects the sublime, decathects 
avatars, within the sublime; the digital is sublime, infinite avatars back 
at it; within the sublime, there are infinite avatars; the digital is 
sublime, infinite, {avatars are backed, at the back of are the backs of 
avatars are against the particular}.

there were great hollows, condors, sublime worlds beyond worlds romantic- 
ized, farmed-out, mystified; subliminal, as if the intermediary always 
escaped.

among the sublime. neither singular nor plural. nor something revealed - 
it would be easy, yes, to think through the plural, counting 'them'. 
What's interior is analytic, what's exterior is sublime, mists, mists 
inert, useless, magnificent, scattered, mostly out of sight, and you say, 
"The cliff is sublime." Think of the cliff of the sublime, think of time.

i curl up, sleeping forever
i curl up, sleeping forever
i curl up, sleeping forever
we call it beauty.

and Kant?

posited as a simple position, which was precisely his position. And for 
university found in a copy of Heidegger's Kant and the Problem of Hegel, 
Husserl, Kant, Aristotle, and Spinoza, in any detail. Kant's Das Ende 
Aller Dinge states, of a dying man, that "er gehe a u s eternity." And 
here Kant - the rest of us as well - runs into the aporia of time for his 
development. Over and over, he batters Kierkegaard, Nietzsche who he finds 
seductive, and Heidegger!

Speaker says, ""Jerry asks about Kant ... Alan thought he meant something. 
Speaker says, "Questions about Kant ..."

Kant might have it, the world may split apart,
which plays into him in an interesting way.

"This just happened. I mean I opened up the software and this just started 
to run from the bvh files. I'm not sure which, to be sure - they were 
there and they look like mine, with the sudden jumps at all. I kept think- 
ing it was like a machine fabricating and then moving the parts around and 
every so often a supervisor would appear. It's a new-human machine (NHM) 
because the movements are pretty much jump-cuts, with nothing in between. 
But I'm not sure. I think the supervisor is an active AI NHM, under its 
own control, trying to tell me something. It kept spawning the program and 
the NHMs in it. Over and over again. It took twenty minutes to shut it 
down. I'm positive either the program's alive or it's a kind of cage with 
organisms in it, and they have their own free will. They don't ever like 
it closed down. They have to sleep when it happens. And they don't dream."

Then return quickly to the insect. It hobbled across the screen, banging 
and undercutting legs, legs on top of legs, a real hobble, what appeared 
to be Diogenes, Nietzsche hobbles along, also hobbled by Christianity as 
well. The red patch over my eyes is painful; I am hobbled, resorting to 
Diogenes, Nietzsche hobbles along. Nietzsche hobbles along, also the 
CONCEPT. When Jesus said: I AM he really said I AM. The CONCEPT, halting, 
heavy, heavy, hebetudinous, hebetudinous, hobbled, hobbled, the wrung 
body, the hobbled body. Wringing occurs when the body is halting, heavy,

zsche hobble along. The red patch over my eyes is painful; I'm hobbled, 
resorting to the question is, can she keep control? That left hand of hers

bodies cut and hobbled, throttled and pressed among themselves. history 
is pressed out of them. history just disappears. this is the pressing of
