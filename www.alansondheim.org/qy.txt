what was augmented is background
what is foregrounded is measured

Movements are drawn from reprogrammed motion capture equipment. Planetary1 
has no 'stars' to establish scale; these could be sub-atomic particle 
clouds for all we know, or a throwback to the Rutherford atom. Planetary2 
sets 'stars'; the image is reminiscent of NASA footage, with one important 
exception: the planets, not the stars, twinkle. However, if you imagine 
the view from a spacecraft, the planetary twinkle indicates fast rotation, 
and the stars glow more or less evenly. If this is 'read as' planetary, 
certainly indexical; if mocap, it's ikonic (?); and if particle clouds, 
symbolic (?). But these categories are blurred here; virtuality doesn't 
help (especially when the virtual implies inscription and/or an 
imaginary). (Come to think of it, virtuality might not imply an imaginary 
- this is also blurred. In any case they're just animations - something 
NASA does best.)

the remnant three-dimensional image i have of the virtual environments 
laboratory at west virginia university, during the period we were making 
transformed motion-capture, and transformed scanning images of every- 
thing from body to mind, from vacuum tube to vajra. i move around the 
point-sets and pretend i'm back in the place (which has since been 
dismantled). i have sad memories which don't translate for anyone else, 
except azure, who appears, wraithe-like, ghost-like, holding somewhat 
still and quiet in the midst of the scanning operation; look carefully, 
you can see her there, sad memories, perhaps that is gary manes in the 
corner, perhaps only noise...

designer's abject revenge

http://www.alansondheim.org/libya.mov (takes a minute to load)

first it appeared wounded or blown apart,
then almost cartoon-like but sutured together
or trying to re-establish itself as life,
whatever that might be, covering up the mesh,
or skeins, or even nodes, it was hard to tell,
there had to be something to it, something
that had the scent of permanency or perhaps
a permanent odor, as blood and bruises 
tend to go the spectral length, running from
one liquid color to another



usa limelite

sometimes the limelite can't follow the dance
but opens internals of the structure of chance;
chaotic behavior kills your purposeful trance;
speed or momentum dissolve in the glance;
better these figures masquerade in the prance
than occupy deserts with morals askance

Story and Transform (for WVU talk)


Once upon a time, Harry rode out with Debbie into the forest. 
They were looking for trolls who wanted good time.
Four sitting on mushrooms and said,
"Hello, fine trolls, this is an even number of days we have." 
At point, forest grew very still, Lou Reed,
two said in union, "How odd." The sky dark enormous loins mountain gave 
birth to crystal

Once upon a time, Harry rode out with Debbie into the forest. 
They were looking for trolls who wanted a good time, upon a time.
Four trolls were sitting on mushrooms and Debbie and Harry said,
"Hello, fine trolls, this is an even number of days we have." 
At this point, the forest grew very still, and Lou and Reed,
two of the trolls, said in union, "How very odd." The sky grew 
dark and the enormous loins of the mountain gave birth to crystal 
springs. The fir trees shook their trunks against the stars,
as if to say, hello, we are with you, even though no one else is.
But the gods heard no one, the gods were Hittite gods, speaking
Luwian, and Lou and Reed had nowhere to turn; it was the Mitanni
who raised their horses. Harry and Debbie were very still, and
disappeared from the story. The four trolls did too. Only the 
gods remain, giving birth, from time to time, to mortals who
forgive them.

sort of big news

gargantua, commedia del'arte, preposterous buffoons, Perillo's X's were 
more than magnificent, the last vestige of the magnificent, of any 
weakness. on a magnificent dark wood table, obscenities' book lay in 
sullen evil's stuff. Jane Barnaby is NO MORE WITH US, her magnificent 
work buried as if there were magnificent osprey; this time, nothing. but 
at the end, the elders tales transform the magnificent dark wood table, 
Jane Barnaby, and the book.

I like to be ridden, realizing that i would be magnificent, an obscure 
object of desire; flying, I'm lost but fascinated. There's something 
magnificent about radio - no, it's not that sort of blond, but a 
magnificent drawing in sand, giving these stellar performers their due, 
their magnificent bodies carrying the inert, useless, magnificent - 
sublime perhaps - but only from the periphery, body of art, sex, and 
life. give them their due, their magnificent bodies carry the hallmarks 
of their trade.

then I sleep and then wake up unbelievably frightened with my chest cold 
and drained unbelievably small - six months for me, and unbelievably up 
and down with unbelievably ecstatic enormous and overwhelming orgasms. 
this morning I realized this work is unbelievably flimsy, fragile, and
entirely, unbelievably, dangerous. i am a spider who always kills its 
mate. i am the yoke, a real stupid nuisance and unbelievably dangerous, 
unbelievably a total mess some sort of jerk and far too fucked up and 
i'm just awful and screwed up she's unbelievably a total mess some sort 
of tremendously needy, i'm just awful and screwed up she's unbelievably, 
unbelievably a total mess some sort of jerk and far too fucked up and 
unbelievably a total mess some sort of jerk and far too fucked up and 
she's unbelievably a total mess some sort of jerk and far too fucked up 
and Mary wiped her face quickly, the day was unbelievably hot.

it's really furious amazing and unbelievably violent - we should say 
this repeatedly: we love the thing. it's grown unbelievably out of the 
box, but the tweaking isn't hard, although inhumane. We're living in one 
of the latest cosmetics, with unbelievably bad school systems, Bibles, 
and churches thrown into uncanny space. It's tiny and saying I think it 
would be terrible if Alan starves to death but he is unbelievably 
rugged, he came down from the mountains, then slept and then woke up 
unbelievably frightened with his chest cold and Nikuko doesn't know and 
she's not about to find out. nikuko's unbelievably flimsy this morning, 
fragile, entirely ontological - nikuko in overwhelming ORGASM 
unbelievably ecstatic enormous and

"it's all one. k!% make 'unbelievably-sexy-body-wanting-you.o' make: 
Nothing to be done for `unbelievably-sexy-body-wanting-you.o'."

o unbelievably ecstatic enormous and overwhelming orgasm - this morning 
I realized this work is unbelievably flimsy, fragile, entirely super- 
ficial, but still, it would be terrible if I starved to death. it's 
unbelievably sad, i sigh to myself, it sounds like it will go on forever 
- but it won't.

Notes from some talks at Dartmouth and forthcoming at WVU -
Some of this is altered from older material.)

========================================================================

Notes on Analog and Digital

Analog breakdown of distribution laws - Land Experiments:
What constitutes illusion? Is it an illusion if the 'real' is 
reconstructed? (Land experiments, also Jeremy's bot)
Analog - Complexity of the violin (The Violin Explained, Beament)
 -- modes of bridge vibration for example
 -- catastrophe theory - where the digital is forced
Thinking of the origins of music, speech, the absent body,
phenomenology, inordinately complex acoustics, 'making music together,'
muscle memory - Not Heidegger, but Husserl's internal time conscious-
ness, Schutz' relevance strata, but not dissolution, falling-apart at
every turn.
Varied consciousnesses of varied strata.
Widely varied time dilations and contractions, body centered.
Free jazz aesthetics. 
Improvisation is possible on computer: within SL for example.
Tacit knowledge and Leder's absent body: relation to speech or playing
an instrument. Somatic difference between improvisation and score.
========================================================================

Tuesday morning - new media class

A. What constitutes the virtual?
B. What constitutes the digital? The discrete? Granularity?
C. What constitutes closure / the abject? (Kristeva, Powers of Horror?)
The abject is what leaks; closure can be augmented by purity, 
potential wells.
D. Fundamental nature of physical reality.
E. The laboratory of Second Life, creation and use of 'concrete' samples.
 Some history: MOOs and MUDs.
 Use of language in SL. (Garrett's work among other people. Gaz.)
E1: Avatars
Personhood: First, Second, Third - the drift of persons and tenses


ON MOCAP 

A. Motion capture - 
Behavior/dynamic filters: Types: where does node addressibility happen?
1. From position of software rewrite: filter as intermediary.
2. Transformations within the external nodes
i. dispersions, scatterings: social dynamic embodied in avatar
ii. reverberations: avatar embodied in social dynamic (choreography)


B. Use of Second Life, OpenSim, Poser, Slac
1. Weather, constructions, scripting.
2. Active textures.
3. Imported mocap.
4. Accessories, attachments, avatar transformations.
5. == Use of available tech: Linux, Blender, Gimp, etc.

C. Demos:
SL or OpenSim Live? Video. Use Mocap documentation.
Mocap demonstration with Poser?

===================================
F. Avatar dispersions as social media.
Mocap Transformations

1. DISPERSED BODY: Sensors are dispersed among 2-3 people, who move 
slowly apart / perform, as much as possible.*

Inversions: 
Graceful avatar for live choreography
Live choreography for coagulated avatar.

1a. Movements are 'linear' - performers slowly moving apart or 
together (occluding).
1b. Movements are 'tensor' - performers bend slowly, creating internal 
body 'twists' (center external to skeleton).
1c. Movements are 'contractive' or 'expansive' - performers open up or
contract in relation to each other.
1d. Movements are 'rotational' - performers slowly rotate / twist 
(center internal to skeleton).

2. SINGULAR BODY: Sensors on one performer.*

2a. Body curls in on itself as much as possible.
2b. Body twists as much as possible.

3. MAPPING: Sensors are 'mapped' according to various transformations
on the body.*

3a. Sensors are positioned 'inwardly' or 'outwardly' on the body.
3b. The body is twisted so that the sensor positions appear normal;
the body is then untwisted.

4. ENTWINED BODIES: Similar to 1, but with bodies entwined during

initial mapping.*
5. FLIGHT SENSING: Any and all of the above, mapping - if possible -
in flight. (This would allow, for example, for a 'normal' mapping 
with a horizontal or upside-down body.)*

*All of these would be performed as 'near' as possible to the 
breaking-point, where the sensor reading breaks down.

Movement:

Movement _for the most part_ would be reasonably graceful, and
relatively slow. The dance/performance will appear to occur _within_
the body as much as possible - the body turning into otherwise
inconceivable positions.

I would also like to try out ideas related to the 'tumbling' body 
(random positioning) with the flight harness, as well as the 'avatar'
body; I can demo these on video.

========================================================================

Tuesday night presentation:

The fundamental nature of physical reality:
Granular, discrete, without or without continuous mathematics
Many problems arise.

1 Virtual reality or mixed reality will be swamped by mass extinctions, 
environmental degradation, local wars, hacking gangs, economic collapse.
  Virtual reality or mixed reality exists in a fragile zone within 
literally catastrophic forces (in the sense of catastrophe theory).
  We move forward as-if.
**In this sense, vr can be considered a _virtual enclave_ or potential 
well within the real. - The fragility of the good.
== Also issues of class based on technical knowledge, available tech,
surplus cash, bandwidth, etc. - including collaborative potential.

2. My own work is centered on decentering, on the somatic, on error. 
At a codework conf. described the difference between programmers and 
artists (which is really non-existent): that the former correct errors, 
the latter embrace them. This is fictitious of course; there are 'band- 
widths' of acceptability, depending on the project. Kludging is an example 
where the two come together. (Most of the world is an example where the 
two come together.)

3. Almost all work in virtual worlds is literal, allegorical, fantasy, 
referential, simulacrum, parallel, mock-up. My work is not; my work exists 
as alien: my spaces have to be negotiated, my avatars may or may not be 
visible, and their behavior:

4. My avatar behavior is governed by animation files originating with 
motion capture equipment. Almost all professional current mocap uses nodes 
- information coming in from specific body areas, assigned body areas, and 
so forth. I remap the mocap body, by distributing nodes among several 
human bodies; by collapsing nodes, by node reassignment on a geometric or 
random basis, by 'heaping' nodes and so forth. 

In the virtual, how, where, does emotion, sexuality, abjection, come into
play? What are the barriers? Where are they? The potential wells? What is
safe and not safe play? Marrying in Second Life.

5. I see the body as:

a. An already inscribed, already virtual body: The body is cultural all 
the way down, into the threshold of pain and death. I should add here that 
_all fauna_ possess culture: it is not unique to humans; even amoeba have 
memory.


when we talk about flesh - we references something uncontainable, soft, vulnerable, carrying history with its scars, always tending towards death, undergoing transformation - something we have a visceral reaction to -in SL there is always the possibility of photographic textures - as if the real has 'made it' to another world - avatar flesh is always a representation, never ikonic - as such it can form, focus, narrate, like any other representation - you can have emotional/psychological reactions to avatars, avatar movement - just as you can to pornography, images of violence - it's almost as if they can carry a certain truth. when however you go beneath the surface of the carapace - there's nothing - as perhaps in buddhism - the interiority - revelation - of the flesh is non-existent - emptied out, exhausted - it's this uneasy area between representations of surface and emptiness, as if corrupted, of interiority - that my work operates - related to my other theoretical concern - how does consciousness apprehend formal systems - 

b. A distributed or social body: Who speaks 'within' 'us' and who answers 
for us, etc. My avatars are social, their movements produced by groups 
instead of individuals: up to four performers for one animation file. - this is a different 'within' - the internal voice - there is voice in SL, other sounds, written chat, attached chat which is read. -

c. A dying body: Our bodies are always _on the way out_ and our work, if 
it doesn't revolve around love, sexual arousal, and hatred, is bounded by, 
revolves within, the horizon of death and despair. the dying avatar - deadatar - the avatar left behind in the MOO or MUD - my current augmented reality work - (so much AR seems to go in this direction, as do performance pieces - the COFFIN - as if in the end death asserts itself always already against the virtual)

d. An absent body (Drew Leder); we rarely track everything. It is the 
privilege of the camera in Second Life to reveal the avatar as simultan- 
eous object and subject: confined and open.

e. A present body (Julia Kristeva) and an _abject_ body - both in and out 
of virtual worlds. What are we afraid of just beneath the surface - what's there?

I am interested in _errors, leaks, and resistance,_ and in the 
re-presentation of _flesh._ 

The work I've done: at Columbia and West Virginia: exploring the 
limitations of mocap. Because my work always begins and ends with the 
flesh, with the flesh-mind, with _embodied mind._

West Virginia University Talk, English 

Language, playing music, and Literature:

Speaking with the absent body, speaking without the body.
Writing involves:
Preparation, a sheet of assertion, conventional symbols and encodings, 
potential well (so that nothing happens to the text as it's being written),
storage, transmission, preparation. It involves stepping-back: WHAT HAVE I 
DONE?

Speech involves:
Improvisations, embedding in time, real-time, somatic issues, gestures,
'aura' beyond symbols, in general 

Electronic literature involves a great deal from both writing and speech!
Think of writing through filters - similar to graphics filters:
Some simple examples:
tr, sed, grep, fold, cut, awk, cp, rev, sort, sort -k a.b
With perl scripts you can do much more (I can give these to you):
eliminate.pl, antiorp.pl, elimx.pl, alan.pl, orp.pl rp.pl, elimy.pl, 
elimz.pl,
elim2.pl, elim3.pl, al3.pl
With awk: all sorts of possibilities:
fil, fill, filter
With extended perl scripts:
.julu, julua, parent
Using talk or chat - 'culling' texts or textual bodies

music (thanks to Aden Evans' instruments!)

nh6.mp3 is a bit odd - made with an Indian sarangi (Bina company),
with the sympathetic strings untuned. I added effects (reverberation
and hiss reduction); I'm anxious to learn it better of course!

the others include piano, gong, hand-drums of various sorts, small
kora, fretless electric bass, etc. i quite like the results, some of
which took me into new territory. nh9 is altered from the straight
gong recording; i find it beautiful!

Enclaves of Theory and Theology

===================================================================

You may lie on my first, by the side of a stream,
And my second compose to the Nymph you adore
But if when you've none of my whole, her esteem
And affection diminish, think of her no more
                                        Jane. [Austen]

(Charade - answer, a banknote.)

[ But a different answer, away from capital, may be given altogether, 
"whole" replaced by the homonym "hole," "lie" curled in meaning, and 
"first" taken elsewhere; this is the application of local theory,
an _ontology_ of capital replaced by the body, the body ultimately 
inaccessible. And then, what happens to capital? ]

===================================================================

Abstract: My bad theory: If anything is basic it's lack. We scramble to 
suture the rest. We can't. We think we do.

===================================================================

I pay no attention to theology; inerrancy or core belief is already dead 
in relation to its imperviousness. Think of god or spirit as token; as 
ulterior, in-evident, there is little to say about them, except of course 
for what might be enacted in their name.

Theory is no longer at an impasse; theory - in the sense, in any sense, of 
speaking the world, is already lost. It's lost in technology, in the 
concrete, which it misplaces and misinterprets - how can one speak of 
codework without understanding code, speak of epistemology without access 
to, and understanding of, the very machines that extend, at least for the 
privileged, the real - whose very definition is characterized by 
withdrawal? The entanglement of theoretical subject and object is best 
served by quantum mechanics from below, now approaching the level of 
ordinary visibility. 

This is occasioned by recent readings into theory, where it is clear that 
the authors were circumlocuting a field they had little knowledge of - in 
this case, codework - but it's also occasioned by an increasing dissatis- 
faction with theory's applications beyond the social in general. It's too 
easy to slip from augmented reality or virtual worlds or virtual reality 
itself, to ontologies or epistemologies, with the receding dream of the 
fundamental guiding one astray. There are several levels involved, all 
crumbling, all entangled - the physical-real, the mathematics of the world 
(however world and mathesis are defined), the current technologies of the 
world (ditto), access to these technologies, theory and its techne - and 
melding or interoperability among all of these. It's theory that 
disappears in the mix - or the rest of us; increasingly, to understand the 
world has come to mean to understand technical vocabularies on all levels 
- from conceptual/theoretical astuteness to access to tools, which depends 
on the grace of institutions and individuals. In my own case, Patrick 
Lichty and Sandy Baldwin directed me towards mocap at their institutions; 
Frances van Scoy extended the invitation to 3-d scanners; Mark Skwarek 
guided me through the beginnings of mocap, and so forth. I walk in and out 
of labs with residencies that range (once) from half a year to (most 
often) 2-3 days. I walk into institutions, into institutional cultures; in 
this regard I'm luckier than most. But the access remains highly limited, 
and what's more important here, the resulting phenomenology is always 
bracketed. I suspect this is the case for most people; it's a matter of 
degree. All I can do - all _anyone_ can do - is write from the outside, 
from the external (within or without a phenomenology of externality), but, 
by grace of these invitations, I have learned, at the least, my limits. 
Theory on the other hand proceeds without limits; its contemporary 
over-reliance on the body, abjection, sexuality, and other issues is to 
some extent a withdrawal to a fictional core that remains inviolate: begin 
and end with the body of the theorist, and the details of codework for 
example will either be bypassed, introjected, or seen as irrelevant. None 
of this would matter, if theory didn't carry the weight it does; we've all 
read descriptions of our own work as if they're written in a foreign 
language, indecipherable with occasional partial legibilities that seem 
inherently wrong. Media (in the sense of writing-about, placing that 
writing, receiving and remediating that writing) does that to one, and 
there's little recourse at the other end. (On the other hand, our own 
descriptions, as cultural workers, often chart out vast philosophical 
terrain, as if materiality - and the bridging between abstract theory and 
materiality - made a difference. I'm guilty of that! In this enclaved 
essay I'm guilty of that!)

When I give a talk now, I try to begin with issues of "the fragility of 
good things" (from catastrophe theory), extinctions, global slaughter 
coupled with populations exponentially increasing - and enclaving, a 
concept borrowed from Mike Davis, emphasizing the secure and violent walls 
placed around the wealthy, around global institutions and bodies, around 
governance in general. Theory itself is enclaved in this regard - as is 
the epistemology/ontology of the real (at variance with theory), dependent 
on Fermilab, the LHC, AR, holographic VR, etc. etc. - pick your level, 
your machine, your theorist. The levels aren't interoperable, nor are they 
well-defined. The result is brilliant production, with either micro-man- 
aged phenomenology, or phenomenology left in the dust. (Brian Greene's The 
Hidden Reality figures here for example.)

It's characteristic of this short essay, that _I don't know what I'm 
talking about, nor can I_ - which is why the weaker the theory, the more 
functional. I keep thinking of the usual question, for example - Why is 
there something rather than nothing - and coming up with the exhaustive 
positioning of physical bootstrapping, the universe bringing itself, 
continuously, into existence, so that the Why - which implies both origins 
and causality - if it doesn't fade away, at least is in need of a coronary 
bypass. The solidity or projection of real or virtual objects stands 
ultimately in relation to physical theory; if holography plays a role in 
our appearing, how many codings occur to construct a virtual world?

The bottom line, not the fundamental one, is the failure of regimes - of 
technology, theory, coding, phenomenology, physical and somatic realities 
- to interconnect, in combination with apparent flows of power among them. 
This power is split and sutured by human claims among humans that don't 
quite interconnect. I'm not talking about the old notion of two cultures, 
but about fragmentation everywhere, suturing within micro-domains (code, 
technology, augmented and diminished realities, theory, daily life). This 
is hard to grasp, when even this description falls apart, is rifted; how 
could it be otherwise? I'm not talking about the old notion of master 
narratives, but about a collocation of narratives, topologically-distinct 
but fuzzy and broken sememes. I'm not talking about a dearth of ontologies 
but about ontologies as local conventions, epistemologies always already 
under contestation. (Which is amazing and liberation; there are just the 
old Sartrean issues of scarcity economics in the midst of Bataille's 
surplus increasingly harbored from above.)

And I'm talking about enclaving brought about by an exponential increase 
in knowledge, coupled by an exponential increase in wealth among a small 
and isolated class - both have utterly transformed the landscape, origin- 
ally one of privilege, network broadcast, and limited access - through a 
period of net neutrality, open sourcing knowledge (but not medical care, 
basic survival safety nets, life on the ground), and a distant horizon of 
universal open channels of information and communication - to one again of 
technological privilege, limited broadcast and access, local control. I 
can see the model changing from the imperial through the appearance of 
democracy, back through neoliberalism to an imperium in everything but 
name. Better managed this time, everything appears better and better 
advertised; it's just a kind blurriness in the details: WELCOME TO THE 
TELECOMS OF THE REAL.

How do I theorize this? It's in my face.
It's inescapable. It's Augmented Virtuality.
It's too close. I can't say anything. It's AV.
