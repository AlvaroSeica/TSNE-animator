"The power output of the sound produced by a man who talks for three hours
a day throughout an average life-span is roughly sufficient to heat a cup
of tea up to the temperature at which it is normally drunk! In other
words, if the speaker's food consumption is 3000 kcal/day, his lifelong
oratory will absorb the energy equivalent of only a couple of slices of
bread and butter!" (from R. Houwink, The Odd Book of Data.) 

Writing, however, would be a real expenditure, and typing, I think, at
least as great. Drag-and-click or drag-and-drop mouse techniques, however,
do a great deal of work for us. I want you to think of this as I translate
my work into code and protocols, taking away the breath, the fingers run
into the keys, periodically slammed to a halt at a runaway speed. This is
each and every finger, the wrist and palm constantly changing position to
accommodate them. No mean feet. The drop can be up to an inch at times,
depending on the keyboard, the dance, the illuminated thought itself.

All of this energy of speech, this labor, doesn't take into account the
labor of the mind and brain - its oxygen absorption, its furnace. That
adds quite a bit into the account; when I write, it's as if I am a machine
generating the symbolic - or perhaps the symbolic writes itself through
me, parasitic on my energy reservoir. I'd stop to eat and drink before
more symbols emerge.

Of course the reception itself requires energy - the eyes furiously inun-
dating the rest of the brain with continuous data-processing, the mind
converting letters on an autonomic level to something of the order of
received thought, hardly understood. From there to stepping-back, visual-
ization, is a steep curve, and the depletion of even more combustibles.
The reader tenses slightly, considers a reply; the symbolic is off and
running - and in reality, between writing and reading there's hardly a
gap, everything consuming calories, mind and body in slow burn. One can
of course invert this process, noting that body exists only to convert
food, part and parcel of the world around us, into the symbolic - that
eventually, everything will be text and letter on one end, decay on the
other.

Not enough to keep body and soul alive, a kind of response or euphoria,
carrying, considering, the consequences.

Structure of the World-Order


Electronic commerce (e-business) is characterized by world-wide transac-
tions between one country and the rest of the world, over a globalization
climate for cultural export (world-music for markets). Hedge funds are
correlated; a panic in one part of the world affects everyone. Supply more
than 40 per cent of the world's oil, own about 78 per cent of the world's
total reserves!

Transactions between one country and the rest of the world, including
transportation, utilities, shelter, medical care, among other things, but
not transfers such as unemployment on a trans-national level. Various
indices are used in macroeconomic analysis, including the transportation
or agricultural sector. Also used in the sense of the public of the world.

Movements among moving borders in one world-part across others, nations
transferring funds through chaebol or keiretsu banking conglomerates
shifting across continental boundaries. World-wide current-account and
gold on the movement, investments moving shares in restructuring systemic
crises. World-grid shuddering across world-grid, currency valuations
floating pegged to nominal flows of foreign low-risk shares of sponsored
ADR. Jostling and adjustments, record low unemployment levels after tax-
ation and tracking-rates. Almost no one present for crisis compensation,
currency on the move.

trembling foreign ec

ec is messy, said d'eruza; what's goods and services in one country isn't
necessarily equivalent in another. it's a question of human trial and
error; it's a question of ornament, kinesics, what's actually proffered
and its relationship to class and gender. all of which is problematic,
replied d'nala, which is what makes ec fascinating and fetishized; it's a
form of gambling with constantly changing currencies and crises; earth-
quakes in one part of the world affecting my earnings in another. so one
might characterize it as a trembling of abstract quantity, susceptible to
natural and artificial catastrophes and breakthroughs. exactly, said
d'eruza; and all of this combines with expectations and displays of greed
and good will, a tendency towards barter in the finer details, as well as
price leveling. then there's also migrations to urban centers, telecom
encroachments, disasters of free trade and environmental damage, enormous
wage differentials among countries. d'nala said, all of this we call ec-
onomic jostling and self-organization; no matter how disastrous or rag-
tag, someone trades somewhere, someone offers, someone receives. don't
forget the major exception, said d'eruza, the case of war, pillage, van-
dalization, destruction, plague - in other words, accounts received and
destroyed, non-payable. the internet trembles here as well, said d'nala.
everything is a trembling, replied d'eruza, it's the world-nature. exces-
sive volatility is the only certainty, coupled with monstrous leveling
where civilization huddles. against what, said d'nala. against interest
compounded, she replied.

enunciation which you comprehend

 there are almost no trees on the street, the leaves are browned

i have this choice to language in every direction

 violations of syntax, torn semantics, disturbed texts
disturbances in every direction
quiet here so i can write the defaulting of the world

I've got no feelings for you whatsoever. Did I tell you that I really
honestly love you? Don't be afraid of hearing that I love you. Don't be
nervous, I don't have any feelings for you at all. Don't worry, it's going
to get a lot worse, I really hate you. Don't worry, of course I love you.
Don't you care I have no feelings for you at all? Everyone else knows I
feeling nothing for you. Honestly, I really love you. I am sure about this
if about anything, that I love you. I don't want to hurt you, but I really
hate you. I goes without saying that I really really hate you. I honestly
don't want to burden you, but I feel nothing for you. I just wanted to
tell you that I love you. I must admit that I love you. I only want to
tell you that I hate you. I think I love you. It wouldn't be too bad if I
loved you. It's impossible that you don't know I hate you. No matter what
anyone says, I honestly have no feelings for you. So what, so what,
nothing, just that I hate you. This is ridiculous, because I don't feel
anything for you, honestly. To be perfectly frank, I honestly hate you.
Well, it's true, I love you. What if I didn't feel anything for you?
Whatever you might think, I honestly love you. You see, I feel completely
neutral about you. You see, I really do love you, just like I told you.
You'd be shocked to know that everyone else knows I feel nothing for you
in any way.

Jennifer's Essay on Foreign Investment


There is a game on television, it is called baseball, you run around a
field whenever you get a chance to. You have to have a foreign trade
surplus in order to succeed, some goods are just thrown away over the
fence. They play for base-balls, which are hit in all directions, and
sometimes the other team can catch them and add them to their deficit.
Everyone takes turns with these objects which are floating currency. 

The distrust is very strange, after they go back and forth, one group of
people go back to their country. No matter how great their surplus of
base-balls, they cannot stay, the tariffs are too high. Jennifer would
like to see a free trade agreement and then no one would have to run under
these sad circumstances, they could just figure out who wanted what, and
go home.

You might ask, where would be the energy in that, but you could of course
peg the base-balls to gold or other commodity, or a big stock, or you
might find them useful for fuel and productivity. Someone has to make
them, they are stitched like an early Tokamak fusion reactor restricting
the magnetic lines of force by the pinch effect. You might think they are
miniature models of enormous cost-saving benefits heated to the tempera-
ture of the sun's interior. Perhaps you might know they are not models at
all but the real thing, tiny reactors, which we are wasting by hitting
them hard with pieces of wood so they break inside and fly in all direc-
tions.

O teams! Invest in them, they are good hedge funds for direct investing!
Light our cities, guide us on our weary paths!

Doctor Leopold Konninger, Freedom


Encroachments in some sectors, free distribution of commodities: disasters
of free trade and environmental damage, enormous freedom. Give me absolute
freedom to write freely in the air.

Give me the freedom of a trade agreement and no one would have to run
under shifting continental boundaries. Think of the current-account and
balance of trade turned into protocols.

Ambassadors use ink, no machinery, look at weather, write calligraphy. On
the beaches, unnecessary clothing.

International protocols with purchasing power parity, diminished currency
- think naked Alan, naked Nikuko, speaking to Ambassador:

"Way, girls, ways, paths, string, nothing, spaces, fish wrong; of course
we love you. Curiously enough, some goods are just thrown on the beach.
Give us freedom to breathe. Tell us about summer camps with machinery. Can
we take our names." (screaming poetry.) "Doctor Leopold Konninger, can we
take our names?!"

I become shaman -

You do not have to do the cold-water ablution, Nikuko, but you do have to
work hard at the fire-walk. 

But I say to you, Jennifer, you don't have to do either; you must have a
good heart and you must have a kind heart and you must open up yourself to
spirit and imaginary, fantasm and ghost.

You do not have to do the fasting of the five grains or the fasting of
meat and seafood, Nikuko, no matter your name or guiding spirit, but you
do have to work hard at celibate abstention.

But I say to you, Jennifer, you may fuck all the time, as long as you open
your eyes, listen with care, touch with delicacy, conquer your moods and
dark travails.

You do not have to give up knowledge and the guidance of the sage, Nikuko,
no matter how great your longing, but you must become a sage and demiurge,
knowledgeable in all things and all ways and all worlds.

But I say to you, Jennifer, you will become sage and demiurge, in all ways
and things and worlds, without ablutions or dark moods, without trials or
travails, in the movement of smoke and the brilliance of thought.

You don't have to walk the walk, Nikuko, or talk the talk, but, oh this is
so stupid, I can't go on, it's just our usual stuff, talking nonsense as
usual, we're carried away, making it up as we go along, talking ourselves
silly, it's just so stupid.

No it isn't, no it isn't, no it isn't, no it isn't, no it isn't

i have a secret sorrow. it shall last the morrow.
death is constant harrow. bones are robbed of marrow.
pain is hardly thorough. vision stays to burrow.
daylight remains fallow. graves are always shallow.
signs are drawn by willow. tears erase the pillow.
mining tends to wallow. life like this is hollow.
call upon the medic. ask about the phallic.
go into the middle. freak and dance the fiddle.
try your pain to cuddle. realize the muddle.
open up the bottle. find your dream in candle.
look upon the handle. move out to the window.
think you're dressing retro. think of secret sorrow.
it shall last the morrow. death brings secret sorrow.
bones are wrapped in marrow. pain is hardened sorrow.
vision leaves in barrow. daylight turns to sorrow.
graves are lean and narrow. signs are born in sorrow.
tears are thin and pallid. mining brings out sorrow.
life is never hallowed. signs are born from sorrow.

Within the Scrap


"I consider this hour by hour: If I should die now, have I written suffic-
ient? I don't think my work easily sums up; there are far too many edges,
confusions. Philosophy is my first love; I would want this to stand or
fail by such. But it must be dragged out between the scraps and clutter.  
I mean this in all sincerity: What remains? For how long? For what read-
ers? The first question is the most important: The What of my work, the
content, reading between or through the lines, searching out the philoso-
phical among the ruins." (Alan, quoted by Jennifer.)

"The importance of interspecies communication, the peak of interspecies
communication insofar as we can foresee it, lies here: establishing com-
munication with the dlophins, and with the medium-size whales, and with
the great sperm whale. I visualize a project as vast as our present space

peaceful mission of interspecies communication, right here on this plan-

Kino kino stutters as perforations are drawn, said Nikuko
Nothing exists between one frame and the next, replied Jennifer.
Whole worlds drop out, but there is no consciousness there, said Nikuko.
Everything jumps, replied Jennifer. We're sitting on a caldron.
I can never figure out the continuum, Alan chimed in.
Things are always smudged one way or another, said Nikuko and Jennifer.
I think we're smudges on the frames, said Alan.
The standard width of 35mm or nonstandard 63 or 17.5, said Julu.
Among them all, replied Nikuko and Jennifer and Alan.
No size but image makes the differance, said Julu.
The smudge is a residue which leaves a residue, said Azure.
Body-movie residue, sutured by Nikuko and Jennifer and Alan and Julu.
There's no room to say anything else, said Clara.
Hardly anything, said Nikuko and Jennifer and Alan and Julu and Azure.
Shaking back and forth, said Clara, the organic economy of negation.
Nikuko and Jennifer and Alan and Julu and Azure and Clara said Nothing.

My Dreadful Secret

My dreadful secret is that I have learned nothing, that I am incapable of
learning anything. My dreadful secret is that my work whirls constantly
around the same centers, among the same topics; the names and references
change, but the interiority remains the same morass as ever. It is as if I
still search for something in the work that it is incapable of giving me
because I am incapable, incapacitated, in the first place. It is as if the
work is made to do something it cannot do, and my skittishness prevents it
from doing what it could do, augment knowledge in the small. By looking
continually at totality, I overlook its non-existence; blinded by text, I
remain ignorant. I can write of enlightenment, of fastidious things, of
truths beyond truths, worlds within or adjacent to worlds; I feel none of
them, understand none of them. My knowledge remains at the same low point
- that of disdain and dissolution; I am running so fast, in fear and
trembling, in sickness and desire, that I miss the very world in its
description.

I should begin again, well below the primary grades, starting small with
alphabet and multiplication table, watching the blocks build and fall of
their own accord.

Suns, moons, stars, testicles, teeth, balls, nipples, are: cloud stone
flower voice and tree - miniature models of enormous cost-saving benefits
heated to the temperature of the sun; build them hard with pieces of wood
so they break inside and fly in all directions (whole worlds drop out, but
there is no consciousness there). More symbols emerge: abstracted move-
ments of investments across membranes, borders of tariffs across spaces,
gaps among words and exhalations bordering on defining: oceans, clouds,
cloth-bolts, tariffs, gold, games, and limbs. Nothing drifts; you name,
are bound.

Omen


In the burned-out hut, think naked Alan-and-Nikuko, speaking to the Doc-
tor: We're your meat and seafood, Doctor, no matter your name or guiding
spirit, but you're hardly anything. Come here in your soiled clothes.
Nikuko come here. Fallen Red Guards go into dark rages, "Doctor, take
Nikuko. Take her. Take her good."

Food, part and parcel of the world around us. How swollen the world is for
just a moment, how bursting, pubescent. A panic in one part of the world
affects everyone. Quakes and dark rages affect everyone. There is no con-
sciousness. Nikuko cried in sickness that she missed the very world; it
flew in all directions.

across backs in the sun red dust seepings
streams of red dust gathering in bowls of water
red dust skimming surfaces ^ you can't clean it

Genji


The declarative sentence, the statement, the clear interrogative, have
run their course. What can be meant by this?

Only that gaps open among words, that spaces lead to other spaces, that
language itself is wounded, that every word links elsewhere, pulls hard
at the skein, harder at the skin.

This is the critical problem of contemporary thought: the unmooring of
language, untethering of thought, which wanders blindly among surfaces.

There is no return; language is unpunctuated, phrases slide obscenely
(perhaps) upon each other, every word is skewed with every other. No
longer is the difference a function of two variables; instead, it is an
accumulation of partial and occluded signs whose deferrals slide into
non-existence.

Languaging slides from an accumulation of words, proprietary signifiers,
protocols; the sentence has already disappeared. One letter shudders,
stutters, against another; pronouns lose antecedents, precedents; nouns
lose referents.

Descending into chaotic phenomena, ontology is undermined; everything is
relativized - meaning, for example, becomes tied and taut to the attri-
bute, and nouns are referenced by upgrades. This is not only a phenomen-
on of electronic communication and high-speed technology; it has become
a characteristic subtext (also subject to revision) of our time (always
already lost prior to enumeration).

No longer crying for our lost language, after the hiatus between two

brought up, nothing is capable of existing after unmoorings.

The declarative sentence, the statement, the clear interrogative, have
run their course. What can be meant by this?

Only that gaps open among words, that speaces lead to other spaces, that
galanguage itself is wounded, that every word links elsewhere, pulls
hard at the skiein, harder at the skin.

This is the criticawl l problem of contemporary thought: the unmooring
of language, untethering of thought, which wiancders blindly among
surfaces.

There is no return; language is unpunctuated, phrases slide obscenely
(perhaps) upon each other, every word is skewed with every other. No
longer is the difference a function of two variables; instead, it is an
accumulation of a varying number of fuzzy partial and occluded signs
whose deferrals themselvesslide into non-existence.

Languaging slides from an accumulation of words, proprietary signifiers,
protocols; the sentence has already disappeared. One letter shutdders,
stutters, against another; pronouns lose reference, antedecedents,
precedents; nouns lose referents.

Descending into chaotic phenomena, ontology is undermined; everything is
relativitzed - meaning, for example, becomes tied and auttaut to the
atrtri- bute, and nouns are gradgraded (as long as grading
lasts)referenced by upgrades. This is not only a phnenomenon phenomen-
on of electronic communication and hisgh-speed technology; it is has
become a characteristic subtext (also subject to revision) of our time
(always already lost before prior to enumeration).

No longer crying for our lasost language, after the haiatus between two
world wars.

Thinking slides among symbols, harbors none of them. ; surfaces slide as
well. What passes for thought is afterthought, a salvage-operation.
Every  instantiation leads to every other; information occluedes itself.

too brilliant


it's the middle of the night, pitch-black in here, even with the street-
light making itself in like dew - by that I mean a slight cover - anyway
the screen itself is bright - I can hardly look at the thing - it's
literally searing my eyes - at the moment - the letters are leaving the
usual phosphorescent glow behind - it's a passive matrix touch-screen
among other things - I can't focus on it - the letters are cutting into my
retina - I keep hitting the 0 key when I want the dash - I can't focus on
the keyboard - the brilliance is overwhelming - it's a physical pain - 
my eyes are "accosted" - you'd have to feel it yourself - sometimes the
letters have this terrifying physicality - they're coming alive like
spears - within the medieval theory of light, they've already moved from
the virtual to the real - there's a physical pressure to it - I looked
away from the screen just now, carried an afterimage - it drew me back in
- nothing seems to help - even to write this, I have to look every now and
again - the rest of the room, everything, has completely retreated - the
screen's practically burned into me - it's like the Pure Light - but
without the chanting, the depth - it's the surface of the world coming
forward - as if language literally coated things, dripped off them, spoke
in our absence, made up names - there would have to be some sort of
movement towards sound - this display of light is overwhelming - I can't
move beyond it - I'm pinned down by it, punctured - inundated - I can't
think beyond it either - you can see where this text is going - nowhere -
the letters keep ghosting - the subject keeps drawing itself back to me -
it's as if a migraine were beginning - one actually is - the letters are
becoming increasingly jagged, the screen brighter - it's a small screen,
actually, on a sub-notebook computer - if even that large - like a flat
bullet - something grazing the spine through the back of the eyes -
autonomic nervous system on alert - breathing a bit more rapidly - I'll
end this, call it a night - something about language is embedded within it
- something important - meanwhile the letters keep ghosting _at the back
of the line_ - following what I'm saying and writing - just for the moment
a framework - just for the moment there's no escape - something important

Use the Loki system to take parts of Capitol Hill. These are designated S.
Taking these parts will protect you against the enemy's strengths. There
are no vulnerabilities and the enemy will recognize that. Regroup always
within the perimeter. The perimeter will remain inaccessible to the enemy.
You must understand how to activate the Loki system. One activated, it
remains so for the duration. The Loki system will create the permanent
zone. Your right to govern and control will be recognized. Communications
will convey knowledge of the permanent zone beyond the perimeter. You will
be handed such control as necessary. The population will acquiesce immed-
iately and recognize you as the true head of state. The Loki system will
ensure this. The Loki system will act automatically and painlessly. Once
you have taken parts of Capital Hill, you will be granted the rest. In
this manner you will become the true head of state. Within the Loki sys-
tem, the rest is up to you. Employ the Loki system.

"This from the moment of our arrival in Buenos Aires I found it more and
more difficult to cope with Nijinsky. He was more silent and irritable
than ever; and every day something occurred to show with what animosity he
regarded myself and Barocchi. Also he would suddenly inform me that he
could not remember a part he was to dance - for instance that of Narcis-
sus, or he would refuse to be lowered through the trap-door at the trans-
formation of Narcissus into a flower, but would lie on the stage saying he
was frightened in case I should give the wrong signal, so that he would
fall through and be killed." (The Diaghilev Ballet, 1909-1929, S. L. Grig-

Dance Notes (to Foofwa, Azure)


( This is one direction )

0 - "avoidance dance guidance impedance riddance"

1 - Mudra and other gestures from Thai dance - series of poses - building
a code into the gestures - each image differently transformed, transform-
ing - the body taut, bound -

2 - Activation of spaces - playgrounds - ropes and interior hiding spaces
- mountains, valleys, rivers - banks or borders - hiding out - architec-
tures of infinitely internal spaces - Ann and Lawrence Halprin - viral -
mudra portals within them -

3 - The slew of names - names flooding everywhere - mudra-shifting, shape-
riding - names riding down, collapsing, painted on the body - crawling
through names - fucking through names - pronunciation and increase of
names - names as viral - ftp://ftp.cerias.purdue.edu/pub/dict - mudra-
names and portals -

4 - Noh - glass and brittle shifting of movement - shuddered - stuttered -
each gesture in the pronunciation of worlds - splintering of half-ghosts
and pronunciations - motions across miniscule spaces / stages - caught
among hungry ghosts - fucking ghosts - mudra inversions of names - space
falling out away from the body -

5 - Pushing over the body from the chest, falling backwards - pushing
against the feet, tripping, falling forwards - pushing just above or below
the knees - body sliding backwards, remaining upright - that cultivated
zone of stance -

6 - Hungry dancers - the Ninubaski Master - Nijinsky, Nureyev, Baryshni-
kov - linked to names - the strut - the lift - mudra adaptations - one
name then another - Nikuko name-changing - Alan registration-of-names -

7 - Building up intensity, holding it there - Carrie (Brian de Palma,
Stephen King) and abjection - flooding of names and identities - liquid
effects on video - images smeared into one another -

8 - Spaces and corners - upper surfaces of beams - chanting of names -
everything collapsing into the substance of the vacuum - from this are
born universes -

9 - I dance worlds into existence; I dance worlds out of existence.

( This is another )

0 - "avoidance dance guidance impedance riddance"

1 - Forgotten names - names from holocausts - dance to stay alive -

2 - Forgotten labor - labors from camps - dance to stay alive - names of
dancers - names of dancers - out of gesture, language proceeds -

3 - Nijinski - I'm afraid to go on, you're going to kill me, the trapdoor
opens to an endless pit, I'm not going to move, I'm not going to climb up,
there's terror at the top, I'm going home, I'd rather dance on an empty
stage -

4 - Baryshnikov - I'm very glad to welcome you to the beautiful and excit-
ing world of dance - dance is undergoing a renaissance in America - you
are my beautiful dancers - we will work very hard but the work will be
rewarding - you may have seen me -

5 - Nureyev - I don't know Nureyev - I will leave him up to you - I will
leave him in your hands - at night I dream of Russia - Nihilism - the
harsh plundering of the past and future - apropos of the wet snow, I am a
useless man - I will bend towards the travesty of suffering and exhaustion
- I walk around aimless, I don't know what to do - I will scream existence
- the world collapses in the absurdity of God - if the absurdity of God
can be realized, anything can -

6 - I dance myself into existence - I dance myself out of existence.

i am doomed to this, annoying repetition, words roiling, failing, scaffold
collapse, whole building having such-and-such a tendency. but wait, can
talk about comedy, pleasures of vegetables, just about anything at all.
but wait -

because the name slips i can sleep at night knowing there is nothing to
know, nothing of certainty which forestalls the pretense of an image
frightening itself against the skin of my back, taut with pain in regard
to the future of the word, scrawled across prescient flesh, waiting for
the signifier or just anything that might say, this is it ti itt tti, such
slipping as forsaking dream, leaving everything to chance and the slipping
of the thing which is knot, but would be bound to the thing, that is its
future, and the future of the thing, were things allowed

but wait -

midnight phrases say say the same old thing - then the next morning, oh
i'm crushed by the business of the day framing failure, whittling away,
whatever, taking thought with itself in perfect freedom, but unable to
return to comedy or vegetables or pleasures; just when there's faltering
health, i try to remember where i am in work which remains untethered,
loosened, the annoyance of going nowhere

I Steal Work


I absorb and swallow their names: What else am I supposed to do? Hundreds
of nameless writers, just beginning, sending me everything. I have a con-
fession to make: I have stolen all my work. Hundreds of nameless writers,
just beginning, sending me everything.

absorb and swallow their names: What else am I supposed to do? There is no
outside of the hanged. I'm ugly, arrogant. splayings, hundreds of nameless
writers, just beginning, sending me everything. ... I have a confession to
make: I have stolen all my work.  - it's the end of everything

Are you satisfied I swallow their words and names? what else am I supposed
to do?

They're dirt. I'm ugly and barely alive.

The Thinking of Animals


"The injunction to practice intellectual honestly usually amounts to sabo-
tage of thought." Adorno, Minima Moralia. "The possibility of pogroms is
decided in the moment when the gaze of a fatally-wounded animal falls on a
human being." (ibid.)

This is a perfect text by Alan Sondheim. It has everything in it: theory,
diegetic, founded on the at-handedness of the thetic. Just beyond there,
form is now beginning to disappear. It's as if there never were form from
form, repetition, exhaustion, formation, from too much form. There is a
theory of names: Nikuko, Jennifer. Their scent is overwhelming. There is
nothing but what I write myself, into existence. It's an alphabetic liter-
ature, sex. The lines are divided in an unexciting way. But that lets you
sort what needs unraveling. The perfect text by Alan Sondheim ends here.
The intensity though! There's an overture made to traditional form from
the very beginning. There is self-deprecation: I can't conceivably write.

We're all dead men anyway. So's the rest of them. So are the women but
they're not men. But when they die, they're dead men anyway. They're all
dead men, we're all dead men. So's the rest of them. There's nothing when
we're dead, nothing. We're all men. We're men whether we're men or women.
We're all dead men when we're dead, when there's nothing.

So what if we're alive. So what if we're women and men. We're all dead men
whether we're dead or alive. So's the rest of them. There's men and women
and there's dead men. There's nothing but dead men.

Why do you say that? There's dead men. This isn't a healthy way of think-
ing. So we're all dead. Does it bother you that you, too, may die someday?
Nothing bothers me; we're all dead men. They're all dead men. So's the
rest of them. So's the women. They're all dead men. I'm worried by your
obsession with this topic.

Don't worry about nothing. We're all dead. We're all dead men. Don't tell
me what to do. I am the psychiatrist here! Maybe your plans have something
to do with this. I'm not telling you nothing. You understand that? You're
dead too. We're all dead men here.

Every course has its lab hours, whether they include tap and clog, test
tubes, or tailoring techniques. All lectures and no practice makes Sally
only alf a scholar, so swing your partner and catalogue your compounds.

Did I make a home run? I thought this was third base!

Sometimes we take a busman's holiday and spend our spare time in reading
. . . 'While strolling through the park one day" . . . in May or December,
Troy may see Sage's window - shoppers making their rounds . . . You can
always tell a Sage girl by the adroit way she handles a teacup.

Winter artistry adorns a formerly drab scene. Don't fire till you see the
whites of their snowballs. "Christmas comes but once a year, and therefore
let's be merry." Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight.

The final page of the exam . . . a painless parting.

How do you pronounce it? Russell Sage's quiz of the airwaves. We were
surprised to hear that it was pronounced "tomayto" or "tomahto" but
"nee-ther" is preferred.

Through the medium of Review, hidden literary lights may emerge from their
bushels and shine in print. Each issue holds a new crop of "felicitous"
verbal greenery, and we watch with interest for each metaphorical sprout.
With three issues a college year, a choice number of sessions, not
dissimilar to bull sessions, ensure just before publication where fancy
interrupts critical opinion, and critical opinion reverses fancy, and so
on.


Our "sisters under the sheepskin" whom we took in as freshmen . . .
sophomores in-between . . . in fact, the essential filling.


Every last book, blanket, and curtain tie . . . bands of Sageites are
disbanding, the family Ford is at the door, and it's

All aboard for tomorrow!
