On a phenomenological level, we live within the horizon of universal caus-
ation, stochastic phenomena notwithstanding. Origins are given as such
because they appear determined; the truth of the matter, however - the
_truth of matter_ - is that causation is problematic; as cosmology app-
roaches t(0), it becomes more and more dubious - paralleling the breakdown
of spacetime in the small. Our worlds, perceptions, are residues at best.  
We shall find nothing at the origin, no function, null - not even annihil-
ation.

We live within the horizon of universal apocalypse, local organization
notwithstanding. Azure and I cuddle together; we are co-dependent, having
these few moments before worlds collapse. The imminent destruction of life
is close to certain; a decade seems a stretch. Humans were given the seed
of catastrophe in the very possibility of nuclear and biochemical physics.  
We grasp each other furiously, our eyes not yet blanked out. We live with-
in the residues, find nothing at infinity, no function, null - not even
annihilation.

I'd say we're made for one another, I'd say eternity;
If Rwanda never happened, Sudan were prosperous,
I'd say we'd love forever, I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us;
If Israel were milk, and Palestine of honey, and China were so sweet,
We'd lie together there, I'd say you were the rose, 
All among the fairest; if one voice hadn't happened, 
Another took its place, I'd say your name forever, 
And we would live forever; if September were another, 
A day of bright fall weather, if Auschwitz hadn't happened,
In any darkness, weather, I'd say that we were peaceful,
I'd say eternity, if animals still roamed free, if there were animals,
I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us, all among the fairest;

The Truth of Magic (A Note)


The Truth of Magic, may I be the first to reveal it, is that Houdini is 
heroic, not for exposing the various mechanisms and pretenses involved in 
the application of entertainment and trickery - but for deflecting the 
Spiritual Aspects of what we do - as if it were nothing more than doll, 
puppet, machine. The Truth of Magic is that Magic is true, not slight-of- 
hand; it has been our gift to allay the fears of Gentlemen and Ladies, 
presenting ourselves as powerless, even impotent. But nothing is farther 
from the Truth; Houdini could move mountains, and those illusionists on 
television and stage are in fact doing what they promise. The world is 
full of Illusion - 'tis true - but the Illusion is that of mechanism, not 
Spirit. 

Thus I break with the Ranks of our great Secrecy, Yours, etc. etc.

If you get inked, get black; if you bathe, get wet.

(Malay proverb, from Winstedt, A Simple Malay Reader)

If you write, write to the fullest; if you burn, conflagrate; if you swim,
dive. If you get inked, get black: write into the maelstrom, conflagrate.  
If you bathe, breathe, get wet, drown; if you drink, drown; if you write,
write down with bodies floating in the stream of stories. If you drown,
you drown; if you write, you're written. Write and you drown; if you get
ink, your lungs fill with darkness: black ink, and you get black.

 our love


 self-deprecation going nowhere, there must be a space for structure, not
 anecdote

 audience [laugh] [applause]

 surely you must think, mr. sondheim, that you are stale and have covered
 everything, is it not? it is not.

 is it something else, mr. sondheim. [shrug] [jump]

 yes and surely. we are packing up to leave this life. i cannot think.
 there are crickets and sand midges everywhere. my body is a sieve.

 you are a saint, mr. sondheim. [laugh] [kiss]

 thank you for your consideration. but i have no more stories, i am lazy
 to program, i have no conditions. i must 

 audience [query] [yes]

 i must complete my theoretical work so that it is bone, not marrow;
 spine, not tissue, earth, not inconceivable and wobbling space

 mr. sondheim, we are with you in our heart. you are a genius and you must
 do this. we applaud your effort to write when you are packing up to leave
 this life.

 audience [applause] [consternation]

 do not fear, i will work through this with my customary and tremendous
 courage, i will not disappoint

 of course you will not, mr. sondheim, you have never done but brilliant
 through the most amazing consequences that would have haunted and
 weakened anyone else

 audience [empathetic] [poor mr. sondheim]

 but it is true, it is the most slightest true, that i will be doing a
 disappointment to myself, unless i am packing up less and thinking of our
 world and its terrible needs and wants so much more, that i will stop
 packing up and thinking of my theoretical work which is so very important
 to you

 audience [agreement] [wonderful applause]

 i know i can count on you and i promise i will never let you down, i
 would rather my heart shatter and my limbs turn leprous than i will let
 you down, which i will not.       

 you are so brave mr. sondheim, i cannot believe how brave you are in this
 dark world, and we are eager readers of your theoretical work, which will
 make us better people who will know about the dark world 

 audience [thankful] [eternally grateful]

 thank you thank you, i will produce the greatest work and i will cease
 leaving and will remain forever in your hearts and my books and every
 other writing

 audience [more than thankful] [jump] [wonderfully put]

 that was wonderfully put, mr. sondheim, thank you, thank you, thank you.

what i heard, in the last two days, of the last days

gouge out eyes, the women are whores, mine the towns, bomb the fields, the
jews are coming, the jews are going, i tasted all the protocols, i saw it
with my running feet, i dream you jews, i dream you women, i dream you
children, i read it on the internet, i saw it in the newspaper, i heard it
on the radio, i touched it on the television, i tasted every jew in sight,
i smelled each and every woman, blood is filth and pain, jews are filth
and pain, women are filth and pain, they're marked in the middle of the
month, walk the streets of any city, look around you, it's purim, haid,
passover, there's danger in the streets, i can hear the danger, i can hear
the danger -:everywhere, they're killing children, jews need young and
kosher meat, five-year-olds are good for books, books are a new and newer
language, they've got it figured in the book, they do their figures in the
book, they're eaten by the jews, i smelled it on the television, i touched
it on the internet, clean yourself with stones, make sure they're three or
more and always odd, die beneath the stones, jews, you're eating children,
look at little hugh of lincoln, you're teeth are filled with others'
flesh, all women are filthy, all women are unclean, jewish men bleed once
a month, they hide everywhere -:tie up the natural blood of women, the
jews are eating children again; seclude the children and the women, tie up
the natural blood of women, it's purim time, it's passover, it's haid,
she's filthy as the filthy jews, they're tying up women, they're tying up
children to eat them - they do that for their filthy rites, i read it on
the radio, i heard it on the newspaper -::

oh daughters sons of blood, there is no place to flee on earth, beneath
the rain of bombs, there is nowhere left to go, everyone will kill thee!
oh daughters sons of blood, there is no place to flee on earth, beneath

our marriage


azure and i wear broad weddings rings. azure is packing now as we plan on
leaving miami. before the rings people wouldn't know what to think. he's
the dancer we worked with on occasion. i allow myself caffeine. i am
fearfully afraid of growing up. i introduce her as my wife. i think the
way i thought at twenty-five and she is twenty-five. i try and take care
of my health the best i can. i was sitting with foofwa and azure. i watch
my diet closely and don't drink or smoke or take drugs. i will die long
before she will in all probability. i work every day as long as i can. i
worry about losing my capacities through stroke or heart attack. i worry
about the length of our marriage because i will die. i would never seek
nirvana and i would always return. it's as if we have just a little time
together on this earth. other people quickly find out how well we
communicate. our friends have no problems accepting us. our love runs deep
through all traumatic weathers. our love survives through everything.
people don't know what to make of it. people would assume she was my
daughter. reincarnation shows you the earth and its great story.
retirement is nothing more than wasted days and wasted nights. she will
always know my future and i will never know her future. she will be in her
prime most likely when i die. sometimes i see myself in her for decades
after i am dead. sometimes someone would flirt with her when we were
together. the difference amounts to thirty-three years and several months.
the difference in our ages is more than three decades. the difference will
be less and then more pronounced. the marriage will not be one in which we
grow old together. the nude photography disturbs people. their ages added
up to mine. there are boxes everywhere and i can hear her in the
background. there are incomprehensible decades in our pasts and futures.
there are positive and negatives everywhere in this wide world. there are
some things one can't do without. there is a great bridge connecting our
pasts and futures together. there will always be sicknesses and healths.
they were closer in age. they were unnerved and uneasy. this is a secret
message for azure. we have to go through things other couples don't. we
speak through and into each other just as the rings reflect. we will
reflect on our past and future lives. we would come together and move
apart and return once again. we would watch each other in life after life.
we wouldn't change it for an instant. when i die she will have all my
belongings around her. who is using who and is anyone really using anyone.

Essay for Graduate Record Exams (GRE) from a dream:


On a Shelf, The Futility of Being

Here, on a shelf in my unaccustomed house, bottles and dishes are linked 
together by association. Perhaps a plate is nestled upon another; perhaps 
a bottle sits next to a bottle. All of these objects occupy my field of 
view together, as if they are simultaneous, connected by other than their 
random placement.

Ah, if they were only linked, the fate of one connected to the fate of 
all! But such is not to be. Thus we divide the world into those objects 
and associations deeply committed to one another, embedded within each 
other, dependent upon one another - and those objects whose being in 
relation to one another is nothing more than futile. Shamefully they 
insist on connection that is not there; they exhaust themselves in the 
effort, and to no avail.

warmth


Jennifer wonders about her new boy. Jennifer says, when we cuddle together 
we are very very warm. Jennifer's boy wonders about this. Jennifer says, 
look at it this way. We are warmer for two reasons. Where our bodies 
touch, we are not cold and we pass warmth among us so that the warmth is 
there and nice with us, and our bodies come together in warmth and 
coolness and then warmness all over. And our skin which is not touching, 
that skin is less than the separate skins of our separate selves. And so, 
her boy says, if we adopt a third, there will be even less surface and 
more inside and lovely warmth. yes yes says Jennifer, and we can add a 
fourth and fifth, and her boy says as we add more and more, the surface is 
smaller and smaller compared to all the lovely warmth inside. Oh yes says 
her boy, if we had hundreds and hundreds, why then so many will be so 
lovely warmth inside all over, and on the surface, even then only half 
will be cold and the other half warmed by the great engine within. Yes, 
says Jennifer, and we will be a part of that great engine and all warmed 
with that lovely warmth and all toasty. We are warmed by our thinking says 
Jennifer's boy. Yes yes yes says Jennifer, we are very warmed by our 
hundreds of thinking thoughts and bodies surrounding us in such lovely 
warmth.

Jennifer's essay on warmly warm

warmly warm is when you're very very safe and cuddly and there is your boy
and your stuffed animals and a lot of blankets and there are no terrorists
under the bed or looking in your windows and you feel nice and warmly warm
and there are no bad people and no robbers and you know you will have
sweet dreams all night long and your boy's arms are around you and the
whole world is leaving you alone and maybe smiling and everyone is very
very quiet and you feel so snuggly and so very full of love and you know
everyone and everyone is so very warmly warm and happy and peaceful and no
one will ever ever die and everyone has enough to eat and time to sleep
and play and do wonderful things and no one is ever ever sick and you fall
asleep so very warmly warm and happy and your stuffed animals are happy
too and quietly talking together

 As unbelievable as it may sound, we are happy to say that our success
rate with NewCurves is 89%! I know this may be a bit hard to swallow, so
I'd like to share with you some success stories of just a few of our
numerous satisfied clients: "I started using NewCurves 10 days ago. I was
told by one of your representatives that it takes about 5 to 6 weeks to
see results, so I never expected to see results before then. Two days ago
as I was massaging the cream, my breasts felt a little larger but I really
didn't give it much thought. That night, my boyfriend said that I looked
bigger. I couldn't believe it. I kept telling him it's too soon, it's only
been 10 days. But he said 'Look, your bra is too tight, it fit you fine
before.' Those were the sweetest words I had ever heard. I am so excited
about NewCurves. I just can't wait to see the change it will make in the
coming weeks."

Jennifer's essay of pride and cowardice


god did not intend for humans to populate the earth. by virtue and example
of the first death, there's death for everyone. by virtue of the first
murder, there's everyone's murder, our true disappearance. we're all
chosen people; our time has come, we'll bring ourselves down. because of
abraham, moses, jesus and mohammed, prophets of one and scapegoats of the
other, we're the seeds of world destruction. by virtue of einstein, cosmos
and energy-mass. by virtue of bin-laden and bush, unleashing of fermi and
binding of newton, by virtue of marx and stalin, lincoln and lenin, the
harnessing of humanism in the enlightenment of the slave. god did intend
us to perish, i'm sure. i'm the prophet of perishing. i'm the prophet of
preparation.  listen and believe, believe and listen. i'm the prophet of
mass-destruction, of energy-mass destruction. truly everyone's afraid, and
most of all, of me. of me, me, me. of me.

the zone


this is the zone, dave said, you go to the zone. that's how we survive
here. in the zone we're open to the world. it's not something i can
describe. it's outside of language. it's a sensitivity to the timing and
passing of familiar things. it's a withdrawal of the human from imminence,
it's keenness and meditation, it's the ululations changing pitch around
the pond at two in the morning, and the sound of wood stork wings at the
breeding ground at five in the afternoon. the ululations changed pitch,
holding the onset and rhythm through everything. at one end of the pond,
other animals were signaling; everything was loud, energetic, and out of
site at two in the morning. we crawled back through the thicket,
photographing inside animal holes and those cavernous spaces beneath the
root structures of overturned trees. there were several closeup images of
cormorants, showing the structure of the back feathers. there were large
egrets and a white morph of the great blue as well as several green herons
feeding. cormorant young were everywhere. at shark valley, the anhinga
chicks were just about ready to fly away. we stopped tourists from
throwing sticks at an alligator, which was furious and moving at lightning
speed. i yelled at twenty of them. i was a madman in the zone. you go to
the zone, dave said, that's how you survive here. we can enter the zone
any time. it's emptied of people. other things are speaking or quiet;
other things approach like the peculiar anole that sat for :we were back
out on the southern road to flamingo; the small unmarked boardwalk was
dry, the periphyton turned to mud. this time we went out to the end at
christian point; there were small crabs of two types, and horseshoe crabs
washed up and dead on the shore. the cacti thickened nearer the coast, and
the tri-lobed form gave way to six-lobed and then almost columnar links at
the tip. the periphyton was dried, desert-dried, and there were black and
light-grey lichen across the mud-flats. the first time we took the trail,
there were magnificent osprey; this time, nothing. but at the farthest
pond there were two roseate spoonbills. i looked for swallow-tailed kites
or snail-kites at the stop-off points, but none were to be seen. a lot of
blue tilapia on the anhinga trail. no more deer, just dried and desiccated
landscape, various small flowers. all of the mangrove were doing well,
both red and black in the desert meadow of christian point. and somewhere
we heard parrots.:today we rescued one of the larger slugs; for the first
time i was ensured it wasn't a flatworm - its head appeared at the upper
end. the spider, about three centimeters across, managed to rebuild its
web. the synchronous ululations of the frogs stopped; they were apparently
signaled by yesterday's rain. in the thicket,, the medallion or blood-
sucking conenoses were out again; this identification is hazy, incorrect,
confusing. there were two albino ones, all pink and red and yellow, about
an inch and a half in length and an inch in width. they had moved to
different branches on another tree. we found our first slime mold, yellow
and bulbous, in the thicket as well. and some strange small reddish birds;
i'll get the identification later.::i'll get them all, these repeated
images, five-hundred nine so far,

repeated images, hardly moving at all. our favorite anole, beautiful and
courageous and in love with innovati0n.X Folder: INBOX M My repeated

sadness of world askew


we're thrown to a halt, run out, stop traffic. she's sitting there. all
among the fairest; suffice if one voice of the cars and trucks slow
around.

any darkness, weather, i'd say that we, on mangrove roots, closeup:
barnacles, limpets, mussels, mangroved say eternity, if animals still
roamed free, if there were animals, oysters, worm tubings. i dream of
land's end images, they claw at me, a god was here, so glorious in
us, all among the fairest; message down in the water of the continent.

down with bodies floating in the stream of stories. If you drown,
it is data you drown; if you write, you're written. write and you drown;
the cacti vines, looking grafted, even over, of the web of eternal life, 
a number of deaths, swallow-tailed kites high above turkey buzzards,
cormorant perch suffice in my contrary red white black of twist.

if you get death, there are countries full of them, the ink, your lungs
of darkness and dark ink.

creatur pink flux in hole to the foot. ... ...  belief in atomic light ...
... mouthtime.

i know i can count on you and i promise i will never let you down, heart
shatter and your child her period, our country, its dark mouth.

sleeps are dreamless, the hospital did a follow-up phone-call, there were
three calls this morning, i don't remember, all about leaving, everything
about withdrawal, i imagine florida in diminution, the phenomenology of
withdrawal, from the known to the vector of the road, i continue writing,

smell of death ==::attacked in our sleep we will disappear, attacked in
our sleep, the sounds of night continue with the murmuring of plants and
animals everywhere in the world, the world is a giant hospital, the world
is a phone-call, a war, the world is redolent with pain and sleeping
animals, nothing disappearing, nothing emerging, the phenomenology of
quietude against incandescent horizons ==:last night we went back into the
thicket on another night-trip, pale white spiders, activities among the
glade-bugs, small cricket frog, of all two sleeping anoles on leaves,
their legs were stretched out, back against their small bodies, sluggish
and comfortable, almost nothing moving, some barking dogs, they're wild
elsewhere in the thicket, the weight of the thicket soft upon us,
elsewhere the violent and bloody war, o anoles sleep through it, o anoles
survive our dark incursion, o anoles humans shall leave this burned and
violated earth, o anoles sleep well, i will sleep with you, dying in my
