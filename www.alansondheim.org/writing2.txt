Writing Online                                            Alan Sondheim



I'm not sure how to title this. I write online, teach online, conference 
online, and even do a bit of governance - I run a number of email lists, 
which presents all sorts of issues. But here I want to deal with my 
writing, my texts, which I send out to several email lists, several times 
daily. In order to do this, I work constantly - a lot of the time I use 
online environments and tools for my work.

You can find my work at http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/index.html - and if you
go there, then look at all of the text files, particiularly the ones with
names like ab, ac, lm, ln, lo, etc. Each of these is a long file contain-
ing a great number of texts; the texts are found in the order I write 
them. This will give you an idea of my "standard" writing.

Now go to http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/in.htm - this is something quite dif- 
ferent! Here is my web page scribbled on - it's a real mess, as if someone 
hacked into my site and destroyed it. But this is deliberate, and an exam- 
ple of what I do - which often involves a kind of "interference."

For this second site (at almost the same address), I used a Web browser
called Amaya. You can download Amaya from the Internet - it's an experi-
mental browser used by the World Wide Web consortium (those people who 
basically decide the standards that govern Web pages and servers) to text 
html and other online codes. It's unique because you can mess up whatever 
page you're looking at - and then download it, or if it's your own page, 
you can put it back. This felt joyful - the ability to scribble directly 
on my own page! So I did that, made a second page (using in.html instead 
of index.html) and put it back in the directory.

So what's the purpose? Other than making a new text, it created quite a 
disturbance - as if a clean and proper web page were taken over by someone 
else and reused. And I wanted to do this - make it look as if somehow my 
work was "torn" or hacked into - as if it were a body that was taken over 
by someone else - as if someone else were speaking through my body. And, 
judging by the responses I got, people in fact did think that someone else 
had gone to the site and taken it over.

Another example of this kind of thing is a project I designed for the 
trAce online writing group. It's the "Lost Project." I was the online 
writer-in-residence for trAce for six months, and I first did a piece 
where I roamed all across the trAce bulletin board - went into all the 
different conferences - as if I had lost something, and might find it 
there. (Go to http://hum-webboard.ntu.ac.uk/~trace/login to see the 
webboard here.) This was interesting to me - writing a piece which was 
scattered across a whole lot of different sites. Someone would have to go 
to all of them to see what I was doing.

After this, I thought more about losing things, and decided I wanted a 
site where people could go and describe anything or anyone they had lost. 
But I changed this in several ways - I made (with the aid of Simon Mills, 
an excellent programmer) a webpage which "shuddered" and looked as if it 
were falling apart - it made it difficult to enter anything into the form. 
I then had it made that, after you clicked "submit," you'd be taken to a 
fake error page - as if you'd make a mistake. The idea was that you would 
already be feeling that you had "lost" your writing and description as 
well. If you clicked on the fake error page, it would take you to a list 
of everything that anyone had lost - including your own submission.

On the first page, you're asked to give your name and email address as 
well - but when you go to the list of things lost, your name and email 
address aren't there - they're also lost. You have to click on a name/ 
address page - and you'll find a list of all the participants, without 
their descriptions.

The best way to think about this is to look at the page itself - at 
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/lost/ Enter some information and see what happens.

All of these projects involve webpages and thinking about the web. But 
there are a lot of other ways to work - for example, a simple thing to do 
is use letter substitution. In the operating systems I use - unix and 
linux - there is a command, "sed," that allows a great deal of sophistica- 
ted substitution - you can even write programs "in sed." But you can also 
do substitution in any word processing program.

For example:


==========

All of thoosoo projoocts involvoo woobpagoos and thinking about thoo woob.
But thooroo aroo a lot of othoor ways to work - for ooxamploo, a simploo
thing to do is usoo loottoor substitution. In thoo opoorating systooms I
usoo - unix and linux - thooroo is a command, "sood," that allows a grooat
dooal of sophistica- tood substitution - you can oovoon writoo programs
"in sood." But you can also do substitution in any word procoossing
program.

==========


This is absurd and silly, of course, but you can work much more elabora-
tely, even substituting things at the beginnings of lines, using commands
such as "sort" (which rearranges the lines in various orders), and so
forth. You can also use commands to change the order of word fields - for 
example, make the first word in a line, the fourth - and the fourth word, 
the first. And you can take any large file and, with a command called 
"grep," pull out all lines that have a certain string (group of 
characters) in it. For example, if I grep the word "line" in a file which
is a collection of my recent writing, called "lw" -

I'd write 

grep line lw

- and I'd get

- which is a kind of fascinating text, produced by "ransacking" or going 
over all my other texts in a particular file, and pulling out the lines 
that have the word "line" in them.

All of these things give me tools for thinking about writing and new ways 
of putting words and meaning together. I'll very rarely let anything alone 
- I don't really care how the text is produced - so I'll go back into it 
and rearrange thing, making the text say things or lead the reader in new 
and different directions. In other words, the commands are catalysts for 
text production - not designed to deliver the final text, but to deliver a 
textual body I can then work on, operate upon.

I also learned some simple programming. Years ago, I programmed in Pascal, 
which is fairly easy and still around. Pascal and the Microsoft language 
Basic combined (or at least Basic was influenced by Pascal) and Qbasic, or 
Quick Basic, was created. It's an easy language to learn, and runs in DOS. 
I did a number of programs in Quick Basic, but nothing really manipulating 
or working with text.

Since the Net, a number of scripting languages have been developed. The 
two most famous are javascript and Perl. Perl runs in Unix or Linux, 
although there are also Windows eversions available. Javascript runs in 
anything - you can write it and it will be read by any browser. I did some 
works in Javascript at one point. These are very simple webpages that "act 
up" one way or another. Some of the URLs:

http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/z.htm which uses a simple random generator and 
word list to create a page which "breathes." I found a parallel between 
the human body and the "body" tag in html and wanted to explore that. 

http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/head.htm contains a simple text which momentar- 
ily appears when a button is pressed. The source code is very simple; 
there is a double message - one for browsers that don't recognize java- 
script, and one which sets up the page for those who do. The page then 
takes you to another page when a button is pressed - the second page has 
the text, which remains unreadable because it's on screen so fast. But if 
you look at the code, you can figure out that the second page is
http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/tail.html and then the text is readable.

http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/tt.htm contains another javascript page. In 
this case I had to look around a bit at other code and paste it in. It 
represents the body of an avatar or character - and the text and 
background color changes somewhat randomly, as if one were looking at it.

And finally, http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/uu.htm is two simple texts moving 
in two windows. I did have troubles coding this, but that's because of my 
ignorance of javascript.

There's another way to do dynamic work, of course, and that's dhtml, which 
incorporates javascript. Dhtml is dynamic html, and you can usually find 
an editor or program like Dreamweaver to do most of the work for you. I 
have one page up, http://www2.sva.edu/~alans/x.html - which works in most 
Netscape and some Microsoft Explorer windows. It's a page of moving blocks 
of text and one image, against still blocks of text and a background 
image. I didn't do any of the programming by hand, and it doesn't run on 
Netscape 6.0 or Netscape 6.01 (a lot of stuff doesn't by the way). It's 
running fine in the background now.

So there are many levels of coding html, javascript, or dhtml pages. You 
can code things by hand - hard writing the code - which can be difficult, 
but will teach you a lot. Or you can have a program like Dreamweaver code 
it for you - which is easier, but leads to looser code which might not 
always run. Finally, you can code by hand, but take bits and pieces from 
other programs and sources on the Net, and turn them into something of 
your own.

I've also used perl to help me with my writing. Perl is a scripting lang- 
uage that sits mostly in Linux or Unix systems, but can download Perl for 
Windows, and O'Reilly publishing even has a book on Windows Perl. It's a 
fast language for doing all sorts of text transformations, and you can 
pick up the simpler elements, I think, from scratch in a week or two. I've 
written a number of programs in Perl, which I use for making pieces. One 
of them, a very simple one, is called "bio" and is as follows:


==========

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
# biography

$| = 1; 
`cp .bio .bio.old`;
print "Would you like to add to bio information? If so, type y.\n";
chop($str=<STDIN>);
if ($str eq "y") {print "Begin with date.\n";
print "Write single line, use ^d to end.\n";
open(APPEND, ">> .bio");
@text=<STDIN>;
print APPEND @text;
close APPEND;}
`sort -o .bio .bio`;
exit(0);

==========


All this program does is take a file called ".bio" (the period keeps it 
hidden most of the time), and asks me if I want to add something to it. If 
I type "y" for "yes" it asks me to begin with a date and right a single 
line. So I could say "2001 I am getting married." and enter that. I would 
then hit the control key and "d" at the same time, and it would take the 
lines I entered and place them, in order, in the .bio file. So over time I 
can write an autobiography just by adding lines and dates.

Of course you can do this by hand, just by typing lines into an editor and 
then sorting them, but I like this odd interface.

A longer program, called Julu, is more complicated, but again took only a 
short while to write. It asks a lot of questions and returns complex texts 
I can use for writing. It has "arrays" in it, lists of words that it will 
substitute in various sentences at various times. Just to show you what it 
looks like, here is Julu (please read on; we're not learning Perl here):

You can see the lists of words at the beginning - and I can change these 
any time of course - as well as a lot of characters that start with a 
dollar sign such as "$that". These are string variables - they refer back 
to the word lists. There is also a lot of "\n" which simply signals to the 
program that the end of a line is reached, and it's time for a new one.

When the program runs, it asks me to enter lines, gives me material in 
return - and I write in and out of the material it gives; it then 
rearranges the lines according to its own internal logic, and gives me a 
text at the end.

The following is a text I wrote for this essay, showing how I can use the 
program to develop a theme; as far as I'm concerned, the following is 
also a finished work, a kind of circulation of software and human 
presence:


==========


hold me, hold me, and she says

my holding is absorbed in my flood flooding, my offer-proffer to you, my
split doll beneath your binding, my split doll and flood-flooding wiped
into existence and your own :my skin is smeared, still thinking; my
binding is wiped into existence; my binding wipes me out of existence;
everything is clotted with the remains of my thinking being; i am moving
on; on the back of the software; in the heart of the thing itself :i am
writing/riding you this, on the back of the software, what sort of flood
flooding do you mean to me, and :through the river more and more and
through the stream:through the river more and more and through the stream

Your alcohol more and more in and through the river is to my spews
more and more in and through the river

===========


While I could easily sit down and type out a text like this, I wouldn't 
have thought of it - not all the circulations and meanings that keep 
rising to the surface. It was the program that allowed me to do that. In 
this case, I don't even see the need for changing anything - sometimes I 
have to change things around, bring the meaning out of what otherwise 
might be considered nonsense.

There's still another area I work in, with my work - and that is in 
various kinds of chatrooms and other conversation-oriented Net applica- 
tions. At times I've logged onto a chat as two different characters, and 
created a play by having the characters talk back and forth with each 
other. (Of course I'm both of them.) By saving - logging - the whole chat 
session, I'm able to make a work I would never have thought of otherwise, 
again. The dialog seems to carry itself forward.

Of course this form can even be used in the sense of writing a play but
there's something different in entering another space and using it to
create dialog. The following is an example of this (as usual, see below
for commentary):

In order to do this, I set up a chat application on my own machine, al- 
though I could have used any one at all. I also wrote a minimum of dialog 
to establish a sense of place. I then entered twice in order to have these 
characters talk to each other - creating a play of sorts. What you see in 
the final result is my own typing, and then the typing reappearing within 
the scene:


==========

Because we foreshadow one another...
(2) Jennifer says, "Because we foreshadow one another... "

==========


- in the second line, Jennifer says what was typed in the first. So there 
are amazing repetitions, echos, and types of interaction possible here.

If you've ever used IRC - Internet Relay Chat - you know you can also do 
these sorts of things there as well; you can type "/set log" in the IRC 
window, and you'll be able to log whatever you're writing/working on.
If you haven't used IRC, you should be able to find a program called MIRC 
on the Internet, which will allow you to use it, fairly easy.

So these are some of the tools, some of the ways I work online. Almost all 
my writing - even this essay - I do while I'm logged in; it's more excit- 
ing to me, since I can look things up, check mail, run programs, etc., all 
while doing the text.

For me, it's not the ways, however, but the ends; I really feel what I 
want to explore are issues of "being on line," "being virtual," and so 
forth. This means there are issues of what I call "virtual subjectivity" - 
what happens when someone has net sex, or falls in love online, or writes 
an essay online, or talks on chat, or does research? Where is the mind, 
what is happening here? So my work deals constantly with these issues, as 
well as issues of the body and language. With language, I'm fascinated by 
the way one can transform meaning online, almost, but not quite, producing 
Because we foreshadow one another...
(2) Jennifer says, "Because we foreshadow one another... "
nonsense - and how the brain can turn that near-nonsense into something 
meaningful. The texts are often lurid, dealing directly with sexuality and 
nudity, in an attempt to draw the reader in.

Here's part of a text with all sorts of substitutions; I think it's from 
my online bio, but I'm fascinated by the graphic and almost readable 
aspect of it:

other substitution mechanisms, to create a work that looks like it's 
erasing itself:

And here is part of a text - quite graphic! - that was taken from a group 
of error message headers - I love the repetition in it, as if something is 
being said, but really the only thing coming through is ERROR!

Only two more examples! The following is a part of a text sent to me by a
Japanese writer, Kenji Siratori; I modified it to create a new text by
making substitutions all over the place. Siratori and I have collaborated
and written into each other's works:

she's naked, like she's on drugs, she's standing or trying to stand, he's
coming out, he's naked, he's hardly in better shape, look at him, he's
lifting her, he's spreading her legs, they stumble, they're in a heap on
the floor, he's crawling away, she's going after him, she's turning him
over, she's opening him up, she crawls to her feet, he's stumbling about,
she's getting up, her mind's wandering around, she's swaying back and
forth, he's hardly standing, he's trying to lift her, she's grappling him,
she's starting to fall, she catches herself, he falls to the floor, she's
standing up, she's weaving and stumbling, he's crawling to his feet, he's
holding her open, she's falling on him, she's pulling at him, he's like
he's on drugs, she's looking at nothing, his mouth's hanging open, she's
spreading his legs, she's spreading her legs, she's pulling at him, she's
putting him in, he's crawling on her, she's turning over, she crawls to
her feet, he's stumbling about, she's weaving about, he's holding her
open, she's putting him in,

she's naked, like she's on caffeine, she's standing or starting to stand,
he's coming out, he's naked, he's totally in better shape, look at him,
he's lifting her, he's closing her legs, they stumble, they're in a heap
on the floor, he's walking away, she's going after him, she's turning him
over, she's opening him up, she walks to her feet, he's working and
sweating, she's getting up, her mind's clear as crystal, she's marching
back and forth, he's totally standing, he's starting to lift her, she's
rappling him, she's starting to jump, she catches herself, he jumps to
the floor, she's standing up, she's marching and stumbling, he's walking
to his feet, he's holding her open, she's jumping on him, she's speaking
to him, he's like he's on caffeine, she's looking at something, his
mouth's speaking clearly, she's closing his legs, she's closing her legs,
she's speaking to him, she's forcing him in her, he's walking on her,
she's turning over, she walks to her feet, he's working and sweating,
she's marching about, he's holding her open, she's forcing him in her,

I hope this has clarified both my work and a number of ways one can write 
online - ways that take advantage of various programs and tools in some- 
what simple fashion. The material might look complicated, but it's nothing 
that couldn't be learned in a couple of weeks, as I've said above. And it 
offers the writer (and reader) an unparalleled chance to explore language 
in new ways, ways that depend on interactivity, as well as what comes out 
of one's head.

For those who want it, here is a short bio (and don't hesitate to get in 
touch with me if you have any questions!) -


Alan Sondheim's books include the anthology Being on Line: Net Subjecti-
vity (Lusitania, 1996), Disorders of the Real (Station Hill, 1988), and
.echo (alt-X digital arts, 2001) as well as numerous other chapbooks,
books and articles. His video and films have been shown internationally.
Sondheim co-moderates several email lists, including Cybermind, Cybercul-
ture, and Wryting. For the past several years, he has been working on an
"Internet Text," a continuous meditation on philosophy, psychology, lang-
uage, body, sexuality, and virtuality. Sondheim lives in Brooklyn, New
York and teaches part-time at the School of Visual Arts; he lectures and
publishes widely on contemporary art and Internet issues. In 1999, Sond-
heim was the second virtual writer-in-residence for the trAce (sic) online
writing community, originating in Nottingham, England. He is currently 
Associate Editor of the online magazine Beehive, and is assembling a spec- 
ial topic for the America Book Review on Codework. His video/soundwork has 
been recently screened at Millennium Film (NYC), as well as Western 
Ontario and York Universities (Toronto).
