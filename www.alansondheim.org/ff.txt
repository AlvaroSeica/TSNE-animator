  dle to the right.

Cable Life


Having checked the addresses-com ports-IRQs-internal/external modem con-
figurations, it turned out as expected to be a hardware problem, a cable
running to the serial port from the motherboard. The cable's been rewired
by the upgraders, and everything runs; somehow in the process I seem to
have inherited a second internal modem, neither of which are installed.

Analog synthesizers such as the MOOG, at least before the ARP, used ex-
ternal cable connects, plug-ins with phone jacks eventually covering the
board. Later, a matrix board was used; this carries over to video image-
processing, with the Experimental Television Center using a 50x50 matrix
to interconnect components in any order. The wiring necessary for the
board is probably over a mile in length, running everywhere beneath the
independent components.

Synthesizers switched to internal connections, with a certain loss - it's
no longer possible to send a signal in between any two devices; instead,
you've got to use the standardized inputs and outputs. MIDI made sure of
standardization, as did TCP/IP, and so forth and so on. Sometimes there's
a bit of sloppiness, such as the ability to download with cat and vi in
Unix, anything that spills text on the screen.

I imagine a hugely multiplexed cable with input and output addresses for
everything except perhaps power, a single connect using fiberoptics and
huge bandwidths. This travels among thousands of happy components, each
time-sharing at impossibly high speeds. There's no reason for this of
course except the aesthetics of a light-pipe in action...

Meanwhile, as the drive towards interconnectivity hits _this_ machine in
macroscopic and inordinately complex fashion, my sexual drive begins to
disappear; instead of remaining at the node, I have dream to travel, the
body battered into bytes and bits along local highways, buses, out through
modem murmurs into pure vacuum, virtual particles. The body stains, spins,
resides, memory self-exhausting.

In fact, think of body as memory-container, spilling its contents (into
memetic pools if you like); now, it begins to shuffle, speed up, thrust,
_intend,_ hurl the purity of lightspeed approach (time down, space up!),
digital bandwidth on the increase, bytes and bits into curves smoothed to
any degree. Oh, I'm sorry, apparently I'm reconstituted here for you, but
I'm on my way, moving on, and I'm on my way and I'm sorry I'm on my way.

(This is an updated version of a list of characteristics of postmodernism
that I used in a number of courses taught from around 1983-92. It consists
of a check list of processes and a brief addendum.) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Postmodern Checklist


From modernity to postmodernity, the following processes occur, primarily
within post-industrial societies: 


Transformation of society from industrial to service to information econ-
omy.

Transformation from analog to digital processing technologies.

Transformation from knowledge to knowledge management, and from knowledge
management to the articulation of fragmentary flows of information.

Exponential growth of knowledge and emergence of the knowledge industry. 

Increased ad hoc attitudes towards labor, coupled with vocational disin-
vestment (i.e. flexiwork).

Transformation from late capitalism to ad hoc transnational managerial
capitalism and bricolage entrepreneurialism in post-industrial nations.

Weakening of the nation state and growth of bricolage governance (local
mafias).

Replacement of essentialisms by constructivisms, combined with the hard-
ening of essentialist positions as a rearguard action (i.e. backlash to
the woman's movement).

Breakdown of materialist/idealist distinctions.

Increasingly reified ethnicities, political consciousness and symbolic
capital stressing 'traditional' geographic boundaries (homelands), at
times coupled with anti-development attitudes.

Increased breakdown and reification of traditional models of public and
private (personal) relationships (sexual, civic, social, institutional).

Proliferation of entertainment forms tending towards technological ef-
fect (representations, media, programming) and distribution channels re-
sulting in the breakdown of network hegemonies (Internet diffused gov-
ernance for example).

Proliferation of information flows into the private spaces such as the
home, the body, etc. 

Semiotic transformations from inscriptive (hardened, maintained, stable)
processes to fissuring (weakened, stuttering, pre-oedipal/symbolic, de-
stabilized) and fissuring regimes.

Likewise from classical matter (stabilized signifier/sememe demarcations)
to non-classical matter (problematic signifiers, significations).

Increased leakage of the signifier (excesses, supplement).

Increasing jostling of signifying regimes within information flows.

Increased incommensurabilities, including languages, teleologies, and
scripts.

Problematizing of space-time and stable categorizations.

Development of mathematics of non-classical spaces (monster curves, frac-
tals, catastrophe theory, chaos theory, eccentric or abject spaces). 

Mathematico-physical inclusion of disorder.

Development of "intermaths" (massive parallel processes (Bailey)), with a
tendency towards discrete, computational, digital, mathematical develop-
ment (four-color theorem, reliance on the computer, artificial life).

Endocolonization everywhere, coupled with the manufacturing of romanti-
cisms (not only among minority ethnicities but also among the left - i.e.
the "radical" effect of Wired magazine).

Increased gaps between richer and poorer, in terms of both economic and
cultural/informational capital.

Emergence of subcultural-noise cultural phenomena, simultaneously using
micro-technologies (pirate radio) and abjuring technology altogether.

Ecological destabilizations and managerial or fundamentalist responses.

Intensification of apocalyptic and survivalist subcultures.

Increasing rhetorical/idiolectical emissions and distorted communica-
tions.

Increased problematic or property in general (including the technology of
reproduction, birthing; intellectual property; farmlands).

Increased development of _discursive fields_ and their receptors, and
their interpenetrations (hypertext, punk rock).

Simultaneously totalization of universal (computational) languages and
functional idiolectical autonomies, the commodification of idiolects
(rants, serial murders, dualities).

A = A (Shelling's identity, totality) replaced by 0 = {X: x not-= x} (the
null set as equivalent to the set of those x not equal to themselves -
displacement and slippage).

Semiotic emissions of symbols which appear sourceless and undirected
(Disneyland effect).

Stabilized "rigid" objects replaced by part-objects, incompletions,
fragments.

Transformation from cultural hegemonies taken for granted (with their
associated margins) to competitive multiculturalisms within hegemonic
regimes.

Advent of microelectronics expanding the tacit environment of the body,
tending towards full (seamless) virtual realities.

Seamless virtual realities as the current _horizon_ of the technological
subject.

Destabilization of world economies coupled with exponential population
growth.

Increased reduction of DNA variability, increased toxicity of the planet. 

Massive plant and animal extinctions.

Deep pollution of local and usually urban environments.

Increased "natural" catastrophies as the result of human interference
(Mississippi flooding). 

Proliferation of shack cities (favellas, colonias) without sewage, water,
electric, and the growth of world-wide shack cultures.

Emancipation increasingly tied to communication and communicative strat-
egies - including weapons and weapon technology as media - the void (of
power, territory, language) becomes integral to the emancipated society
which is cast adrift.

World-wide growth of the Internet, including dark-net domains.

Tendency towards "technology with a human face" by the development and
proliferation of increasingly higher-level languages - tendency towards
cyborg-regimes.

Elimination of _master narratives,_ replaced by situational micro-narra-
tives (Lyotard).

Backlashing through an insistence on non-transcendentalist ethics among
tight subgroups (survivalists, fundamentalists) coupled with a freezing of
inscriptions (reliance on biblical word).

Confluence of genders, transgressive sexualities operating within an
_engendered field._

Increased problematizing of gender within queer/theory/feminist debates.

Institutionalized transgressions, abjections.

However, circumscribed abjections and alienations replaced by irreducible
abjections.

Traditional rites and rituals transformed into simulacra, combined with
the exhaustion of tradition (interior horizons of tradition, and _tradi-
tion_ replaced by _traditions_).

Growth of technological vulnerabilities and parasitologies (manufacture of
illegal domain names on the Net, hacking, cracking, pirate radio and
television, phone phreaking, etc.).

Art replaced by techne, and an exhaustion of traditional artistic/cultural
notions of progress and development.

Questioning of historic, geographic, anthropological methodologies and the
emergence of self-reflexive discourses (Mike Davis, Michael Taussig).

Increased serialities (manufactured "inauthentic" relations beneath and
within the sign of capital).

Increased cultural tourisms, relativisms, equivalences, beneath and within
the same.

Increased splitting of academic fields, discourses, languages.

Commercialization of the university, alliance of business and education -
i.e. _the business of education,_ _education of business._

The simulacra of desire's liberation and the potential of infinite choice.

Replacement of the spectacle by the simulacrum (no longer strings to pull)
(Baudrillard).

Replacement of the body by the cyborg-body, of the symbolic by the imag-
inary masquerading as the symbolic, of the real by the symbolic.

Replacement of the televised real by the symbolic-real, the real-symbolic
by the real.

The perception of life as the _condition_ of the real (Mars-life, diffu-
sionist theories).

--------------------

A split among _postmodernisms_ themselves into _apartment postmodernism_
characterized by wealth, personal telecom terminals, and a mobile urban-
ism; and a _postmodern poor_ characterized by nomadicisms, urban inten-
sifications, information economies (de Soto), available tech/telecom
strategies, and_electric media_ (loudspeaker, telephone, telegraph).

The development of _postmodern geographies_ which include nomadic and
telecom geographies (electromagnetic spectrum for example), body/gender
territories, and noise culture domains.

The development of telecommunications as a _third space_ beyond the
_second space_ of time and the _first space_ of traditional geographies.

Appearance of the _postmodern body,_ part-object, cyborgian, simulacra
appearing as _transgressive logics_ across and within its surfaces, the
new frontier corrupted by violent social/environmental decay (appearance
of immune deficiency and other diseases, increased medical technologies,
disappearance of the dead (Gulf "War," etc.).

Entrepreneurship within the digital realm, realm of the body - the sub-
tending of the real.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The postmodern remains unnamed; what drives it, its drives, are unnamed.
Names reproduce within the modern; their semantics are Kripkian, held in
place as rigid designators true in all possible worlds (counterfactuals).
In the postmodern, rigidity is problematic, deconstructed; worlds them-
selves are fuzzy, interwoven, partial. Communication at the speed of light
(Virilio) brings time to a standstill.

(Postmodern poor: Postmodernism occurs within a critical space, a space of
the catastrophic, emptied of symbolic legitimation and stability. Because
of capital flow, emigration, and struggles for individual survival and
autonomy, the space begins to "fill up," creating a cacophony of (infor-
mal) regimes competing for cultural and economic power, gaslines, water,
labor, prostitutions, and so forth. The resulting struggle produces com-
peting domains in which the symbolic itself is at stake; nothing, not even
communication, can be taken for granted. The zone is a chaotic accumula-
tion of intensities, condensed matter and languages, a dead or deligimi-
ized zone. The planet itself is becoming an accumulation of such zones.

Poor postmodernism is life which skips modernism, and heavy industry,
jumping when possible to radio, television, Internet - just a short dis-
tance from the maquiladora poisoning the environment - the early post-
industrial revolution of electronic assembly plants, tourisms, and small
manufacturing. (But here too is a myth (and where is "here"?);  unemploy-
ment also grows, scarcity and desertification increase; but here, too,
a telenovella...))

Voyeur ii


Two small eyes for this voyeur; first I was able to enter an adult
reflector site (NO LURKERS HERE!) with a slightly misconfigured quick-
cam; nothing sent, everything come in. A woman masturbated on a bed. A
male masturbated and another male masturbated. The two men revealed
their cocks and nothing more; the woman twisted and turned, exposed
herself, fingers and dildo. The woman described a universe of affect;
the men centered themselves on their axis. Later I did return to the
primal scene, set my camera up on myself, chest down (emptied of all
facial content, which I nontheless returned to periodically; I couldn't
keep my self out of the picture). Wearing underwear of various sorts, I
touched myself seductively - no replies. I typed is anyone there? No
replies. I figured there was no transmission going on. I went to chat
and asked; no replies. Everyone was intent on a woman X revealing her
breasts. I went back to type on the image "I am so alone" "am I here
for you?" "do you see my image"? No replies; I figured no one could see
anything, but there was an edge to it. I was naked at this point,
aroused by the contents emptying themselves on the screen, which were
not facial, but everywhere. I masturbated, narcissistic to the end, my
quickcam image echoing my body back to me in the midst of the relative-
ly anonymous others.

I walked away, dressed, returned to a more public Norwegian site, went
through the same motions. Again I asked if my image were visible; in
chat, I received several answers, yes; I confirmed this by running up
my transmission rate until the reflector told me to cool it. So I was
visible after all at the first site, fully exposed; everyone was quiet
about it - the masturbators in the group, the woman included, going on
with the production of the representation of the simulacrum of display,
but in fact it was display for all that and real for all that and sim-
ultaneously overwhelming (exposure before strangers! tickets! the win-
dow goes up!) and fully prosaic...

ii ii

The men had the camera fixed on their cock, a singular position. The woman
moved the camera; twice an arm appeared, indicating the presence of some-
one else in the room. The woman developed a narrative of exploration; by
the time I left the site the first time, she had the camera in close on
her shaved cunt, which she opened, almost like an Annie Sprinkle perfor-
mance. It was powerful and beautiful.

The presence of a presumed partner, in the midst of what was most likely a
heterosexual emission through the Net, is similar to the scene established
in numerous swinger magazine advertisements - a female, accompanied by her
male partner, fucking men and women, while the male watches. The tension,
control, and split of power - as well as the subversion of jealousies and
abjections - is intense. There is a hunger here, the subversion of homo-
sexualities detoured (a la Irigaray); the opening of a "safe" and contrac-
ted haven for pushing the body to its erotic edge; and the release of (La-
canian) masquerade and (Reichian) everything else as the symbolic (cont-
ract, division) transforms into the imaginary, and the flesh is carried
further into the (Lacanian) real. 

I know _I would have done anything_ had I been asked, exposed myself com-
pletely to male or female (in fact, I had done that unknowingly, but none-
theless filled with desire); I would not, however, have given out my ad-
dress or other information - this was too present for presence. I did at-
tempt to locate one of the participants (domain names are given) and with
that, I had, if I had wanted, already a beginning, almost a location, a
real name (I was "empty" on the site), almost something beyond the slip-
page of the signifier into the grain of the screen/quickcam.

The images of all the participants needed constant tending; because of the
nature of CuSeeMe transmission, the woman's body constantly fractured into
sheaves. The male bodies were more stationary, stilled, as if it were
enough for the cock to be raised, periscopic, checking out the terrain.
There was pathos all around, but the _hunt_ for the image, occasional tun-
ing and retuning, the periodic slow typing in chat or at the bottom of the
miniature screen, only increased the body turned towards its improbably
destiny; it became a form of gambling - even sight was involved, decoding
the planes, returning the woman's body to itself, tuning one's own to the
screen.

This is far preferable to teledildonics; this is in the realm of the lurid
(which I have described in terms of the nightclub, the torn, the abject,
the half-illuminated), and the lure. The object which is just beyond the
screen is between your legs; the gift offered by the male or female is
matched by your own; and display itself is cathartic. It's as if control
of control were acceded, as if the body shimmered across issues of con-
tractual domination, into a realm where light coupled with pixels, where
revelation itself was dirtied by poor resolution, and was such a relief!

Voyeur iii Bad Theory 


What is the _scopic drive_? I suspect this is hard-wired in, open to ear-
ly imprinting, perhaps more male-oriented (the jury's still out). Is it a
form of objectification, or does it sexualize the real through fetishiza-
tion? The real bends towards the voyeur; s/he perceives obstacles, barri-
ers, the lure/lurid beyond them. The real is always already an unveiling.

*A: Q your setup needs to be 15 send and 28 recv...not 80 and 300 the
way it is now
*A: Getting 60% lost packets that way
*B: A...it's an empty room anyway!
*C: true, Q..please adjust your settings, okay/

Q is a woman. I tune to Q, see nothing; she's gone, on and off. My memory
returns to OP of last night, obviously regulars. 

*D: F I see you have things well in hand again!
*F: well.............

The phallic image holds fast but I exaggerate; there are all sorts of
males on all sorts of channels, often with the chest showing - either
chest or full genitals. I find my sweater makes pretty patterns on the
screen and either no one cares or I'm not transmitting. 

*A: Who can tell...80/300 is not going to send right anyway
*A: Sure is
*D: there goes Q Poof!
*G: Q Hi
*D: okay you're back huh!!! yeaah!
*H: hello all....
*MN: Q
*D: Poof!!!

Q goes back and forth, the image appearing and disappearing; I think of
the instability of the imaginary, the uncanny, ghosts always appearing on
the periphery.

*G: boring!!!!!!
*G: it's a bad day
*F: yeah
*C: yeah...surf time...see ya all

Nothing much is happening on the channel. Everything is quiet; there are
long pauses between lines on the chat. 

*J: We need a little OQ!
*F: they were here earlier
*D: she already been here before
*D: poor show they gave
*F: there vid sucked
*Y: bummer
*Z: Hi all!  Who are we talking about?
*D: can't anyone bring his lovely wife over?

I gather OQ are popular on the channel; they give a show, construct a
narrative. Last night, O alone was visible and I have written about this. 
And I think it's genetic and the imprinting grabs hold of one really
hard, and it's not the primal scene but the scopic scene, the way vision
grabs you, and the imprinting is in dialog with features which make bab-
ies smile and drives towards reproduction/sexuality are the visual/aural
drives, and why wife? And where is over?

*Alan: I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm already making moves
here, building the narrative which is always a lure, lurid, torn - you're
peering into a world, filling out the corners with people, bodies, de-
sires, everyone wants to know more. In a Dallas swinger's magazine, a
woman drank the piss of six men from champagne glasses accompanied by her
husband; she looked abject and ecstatic. I sit at the computer and my
pants are on my pants. 

Scopic drive: The last thing we have to get rid of is the _story._

(I'm struggling towards something that's too internalized, detouring the-
ory, desiring the neurophysiological and its current mythologies. For
example, here's Fenichel (The Psychoanalytical Theory of Neurosis), root-
ing back towards childhood, but detouring the physiological: 

"In the unconscious of voyeurs, the same tendencies are found as in ex-
hibitionists. The childhood experiences on which voyeurs are fixated
sometimes are scenes that gave reassurance - for example, such scenes as
the incident in the case of Freud's foot fetishist. More frequently, voy-
eurs are fixated on experiences that aroused their castration anxiety,
either primal scenes or the sight of adult genitals. The patient attempts
to deny the justification of his fright by repeating the frightening
scenes with certain alterations; this type of voyeurism is based on the
hunger for screen experiences, that is, for experiences sufficiently like
the original to be substituted for it, but differing in the essential
point and thereby giving reassurance that there is no danger. This tend-
ency may be condensed with a tendency to repeat a traumatic scene for the
purpose of achieving a belated mastery." 

The screen metaphor is apt of course, as are the "primal scenes" if they
can be untangled from _parents._ The hunger is there, but not, I believe,
for the suturing of trauma. The detour is developed: 

"The fact that no sight can actually bring about the reassurance for
which the patients are striving has several consequences for the struc-
ture of voyeurs: they either develop an attitude of insatiability - they
have to look again and again, and to see more and more, with an ever
increasing intensity - or they displace their interest from the genitals
either to forepleasure activities and pregenitality or generally to
scenes that may serve better as reassurances than does actual genital
observation." 

Finally,

"The longing to substitute looking for acting makes persons who are in
conflict about whether or not to follow some impulse long for someone
else to perform the act. The release from responsibility which they ach-
ieve in this way explains the effectiveness of the 'seducing example.'"

Note that Fenichel's description itself waves, becomes unstable, covering
itself, suturing the theory; what escapes are the _biology_ of the
drives, the genetic components. Is narrative genetic? I think so, in the
sense of foreclosure, completion - not that animals in general have a
sense of plot, but that there are behavioral trajectories that begin the
climb to story. Story as superstructure tangles with superstructural de-
sire; everything escapes, including the signifier. We now return to the
program.)

Voyeur-Machine


Hordes 
Groups of waiting males, nothing is happening here. Someone sleepily
caresses his penis; no one says anything. Eyes half-closed, talk about
ref surfing (reflector surfing, moving across CuSeeMe), languor. It's
clear that connections are sometimes one-to-one, that private refs sur-
round me like a halo.

Woman
Coming into the plain, and everyone goes polite. Someone smokes, someone
else warns him to put it out, could start a fire. Please won't you let us
see your breasts. Please what is your URL. Please I will take my _close_
off. Please you are so beautiful. You can see fire in the distance.

Women 
Roam across the territory and it's new to them and the men. Everyone
gauges the distance to their sex; everyone's wary, sitting in a circle.
Almost-conversations are stillborn, aborted, literally aborted. The sky
is a sullen grey. 

Scopophilia
Structures virtual subjectivity, explodes: The very sight of them! The
slightest appearance of an areola lends itself towards further paste;
the territory is tried and found wanton. The drive silences and cancels;
tumescent computer becomes breast, nipple, vagina, penis, frozen, melted
at the oral stage. It's the mouth which faces, defaces, the screen.

Deer 
And other animals cross the savannah, leaving spoors, traces, demarca-
tion. Who will live by the smouldering plains, rain held off in the dis-
tance, our machines curtaining flesh with flesh, ground to sky. Not so
much a question as a period in our lives scuttled by charred bones. The
fires have passed, past.


_________________________________________________________________________


This is the outline I finally used on the panel on voyeurism at the New
School. The evening went well. I talked about niches, that any area of
the Net that has more than one person visibly on at a time, tends to
develop community and sexualities. I also talked about CuSeeMe, Iphone,
MOO, MUD, talker, communities - that the Net was an extension of human
modalities (sensory and otherwise) not a replacement. Even the people who
were critical were interested in further information; the discussion
continued after the panel ended.

Anyway, for what it's worth -

1. On the Net most communities use text-based applications.

        In text when you stop speaking, you're no longer present.

        When you are present, you're a construct.

        Writing takes on ontological significance.

        The interaction uses projection/introjection, "hysteric embodi-
        ment," the displacement of body onto writing a a symptom."

2. Net sex in text-based applications is largely exhibitionism.

        Voyeurism involves the illicit, peering, anonymity, virtuality.

        Exhibitionism occurs in theater areas of MOO.

        Net sex is consensual and overpowering at times: the narrative
        unfolds the desire of the other.

        Net sex is empowering, leading to realignments of real-life
        relationships. (Breakup of marriages, marriages, etc. - experi-
        menting with the body.)

        There are a variety of applications for private or public Net sex
        including chat lines, IRC (msg, dcc), talkers, etc.

3. CuSeeMe gets closer to voyeurism in the traditional sense.

        What is CuSeeMe? Reflectors. Less talk, situation of waiting.

        Female displays tend towards narrative, conditioned by males -
        male displays tend towards phallocentricity, the object.

4. Privacy and censorship: The private lines are almost inviolate to all
   but inveterate hackers.

5. Other voyeurism:

        Hacking into someone's account - worms and viruses (as opposed
        to SYN attacks, etc. - taxonomy of hacking).

        Being in someone else's account, becoming-other.

6. Inverted voyeurism: Net sex in the middle of a postmodern on-line con-
        ference, sending out Net sex texts, etc.

7. Contact me afterwards for further information.

Margaret and Kierkegaard


 "Quite strange! In one of my first talks with her when I was most deeply
shaken and had been stirred to the depths of my being, I told her: that in
each generation there are a few persons destined to be sacrificed for the
rest. Most likely she did not understand what I was talking about, perhaps
I didn't make myself clear (in any case, only about my inward suffering,
really) least of all did I understand that it would start making her suf-
fer. But precisely her spontaneous, young happiness in juxtaposition to my
horrible melancholy, and in such a relationship as ours, compelled me to
try and understand myself; for I had never before suspected the extent of
my melancholy; I had had no true yardstick for measuring how happy a human
being could be. 

"Thus I believed myself sacrificed because I understood that my suffering
and anguish made me inventive in delving for the Truth which, in turn,
might benefit others." (Diary)

Of course it was Margaret who left me; the Truth is now the truth under
erasure; I've never benefited anyone; I have not gone on to write book
after book, but only drivel into files; and my suffering, if anything,
produces nothing but a dark horizon beneath which thought and humanity
suffocate.

This is how literature lies; this is how you tell the truth to yourself.
This is how you lie.

What the Trembling is About (CMC/sexuality/BWO)


I dream of everyone, fantasize. Everyone is in my imaginary. The symbolic
spews out the cloaca. I toss and turn; the images are nightmarish, un-
bearably pleasant. They are degenerative, dis-eased; the body floods it-
self in public, my fingers in your holes, we expose ourselves, I devour
your secretions, we're on stage, you've stained your skirt brown and
yellow, I'm covered in shit. As soon as one strange attractor exits, ano-
ther takes its place. They're nameless. No sleeping position, fetal or
otherwise, springs the body's real back to life. I'm lifeless; I move,
tremble.

I tremble in the chest area; the images cathect in the eyes, literally
cathect. I'm aroused, but not towards masturbation - it's towards the
denigration of the body, for example, the one time I cheated on a wife,
shaking violently before hand (outside, cold, beer; inside, anal sex),
the only time. As if the body burned itself alive, jetted out, spewed
across the tarmac, headed towards the terminal where everyone was burned
alive. 

Destabilized in house, job, lovelife, the body runs behind the herd,
catches them unawares. It drowns itself, inverts, nests in shit (they're
all shit anyhow). Images are as real as the words on this screen. I would
do anything for you, meaning, at least that hooks into the flesh, buries
the barb in. Turning solidifies them; what can I do but type.

This isn't the kyber-exhibition/ist; this doesn't splay, display, spread
apart, suture. This is turmoil, not BWO (body-without-organs), but BWO
(body-with-organs, organelles), festooned. Trembling, I become St-Antoine
without the signifier (see Flaubert) at the end; I am drawn towards, as
someone did say, maybe voyeurism isn't the primal scene but eating. I
will eat everything your body produces. I will turn into you, turn myself
out. (But this is the primal scene, just another one, anus coupled to
mouth, mouth coupled to anus, opening circuitry to peristaltic cycles,
contractions, expansions. We/me, screen dreams, dream-screen, primal
imaginary, coupled oscillators. _Resonance._ You could make a model.)

The trembling occurs more intensely around the breasts; I fixate on nip-
ples, want them smeared. They become writing-tools; drag my body, paral-
lel lines of shit, blood, smeared across the screen. This is the _scrawl_
of writing's beginnings, emerged from cloaca/chora/chthonic, the c-shell
of eunuchs to be. My nipples pulled off, holes gape; I become _pure_
text, skittering graphic energy, no signifier/signified. You read the
blood of the body with your fingers. Holes plugged, fingers devoured, cut
off; holes eat/themselves. 

Not-sleeping I awake; images continue; I move towards the _rails_ of dis-
course, train-tracks guiding these letters. Cold as ice, _they carry what
I carry._* (But suppose we glue our flesh together; would it tear at the
seams, develop scar tissue, heal into a heavy misshapen fibroid mass?
Would we know we were ever apart? Would we share blood, healthy or dis-
eased, share desire's discomfort? Suppose we gnawed each other's nipples,
fastened/fascinated/fetishized _there_ across the blandness of the termi-
nal chest. Symbiotic trembling, self-cancellations, collapse, atrophy,
death.) 

My candle burns at both ends; I am your candle. Day in and out I burn; 
the screen adds fuel to the flames. I am soaked with you, soaked with
empty air; like a nova shell, I explode, only to find collapsed excre-
tions matting my hair, eyes, face, mouth, body, over and over again. The
shell roars, ear-splitting thunderquakes, heaving back and forth. I bury
my words my hair my eyes my face my body in time. These letters. The let-
ters I send to you. E/piss/tols. Until tomorrow sings. Shorn desire. 
_Drawn._**

*It was pointed out repeatedly, on the voyeurism panel, that text has no
aura, no pointers, no other means of employment than itself - unlike
spoken language, one person in the presence of another. But in ytalk the
body is there, if only in the erasures, speed of writing, spelling mis-
takes, corrected or uncorrected. And on CuSeeMe, there are images, text
on the images, crude stuttered telephony, chat-line typing as well, peo-
ple staring, looking isolated; even _husbandnwife_ teams have one or
another protruding at the keyboard, the other remaining beyond/ behind. 
What's shared? But my fingers grope through their texts and pictures and
oh we'd love to see each other's w/holes.

Why I love Amy Fisher


"Little dabs of blood were everywhere. On my white Formica chair. My
phone. My carpet. My desk. I called Jane again. Her father answered and
said she'd left. I took deep breaths and hoped like hell _my_ father
wouldn't wake up before she got there and helped me get rid of the blood.
For playing with guns, I thought I would definitely be punished by my
parents.

"It never occurred to me to worry about the police."

(From Amy Fisher, My Story, by Amy Fisher with Sheila Weller.)


"A female informant described the Virgin to Nash as follows: 'Senora, I
am going to tell you of the Virgin of the mineshaft. She is on top of the
metal, on top of the gold that is still there in the mineshaft, under the
church and the _pulperia._ Boiling water passes over this metal, crystal-
line water that is bubbling and boiling. The Virgin is miraculous. The
metal is liquid. It comes in very clean, and you can't move it at all. We
went into the shaft under the _pulperia_ once...How beautiful it [the
metal] was! It was like raw sugar.'"

(From Michael Taussig, The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South Ameri-
ca.) 


"Someone else put it this way: 'Amy, you have all the subtlety of a Mack
truck.'

"Yeah: a Mack truck loaded with lit dynamite, with broken brakes, going
120 miles an hour toward a brick wall."

(Fisher.)


(The screen burns and shatters; my chest is cut. I can't see "what I'm
doing" - can't see my words; I'm silenced, remembering the proper key /
strokes to send the message _out._)

A True Account


I went onto IRC to investigate breathing/heaving through textual correc-
tions and backups. I joined channel #zz as @Alan op. There was no one else
of course. I began typing when "Helis" (changed the name) replied to me.
Helis was not on zz, but was somehow monitoring it and messaging me with
comments. This is precisely the origin of scattering/heaving - the breath-
ing of the text here, beyond the control of _this_ writing into the domain
of the _other:_

Leaving, See You


On See You, See Me, I find myself awkward; my self-hatred results in my
covering up my window (Quickcam image) with someone else's. I lurk; who
would want to talk with me? It's too similar to a party; it's much too
real. After a while, I'll bow out of there, click X on the screen, and
CuSeeMe crashes to a halt; the party's over.

What's unnerving is the feeling that the whole world has just collapsed.
It's not like exiting a MOO with @quit, IRC's /quit or /leave or /bye,
talker's .q, ytalk's ^C. It more like a sudden exhaustion of air; the
universe has just deflated. 

Now what's unnerving about this is how _real_ the stuttering images,
sounds, and tentative gropings on the chat-type become. I see Rebecca
getting ready for class and people saying good-bye to her. Or Don receiv-
ing a call from someone in Iowa testing out the audio bar.  They're all
on first-names; I've walked into a late-night bar all-day long.

So what's unnserving here is that these wonderful people all know and love
each other! They challenge each other! They help each other with personal
tech support! They're in love! 

Now I've just downloaded the demo of Enhanced CuSeeMe - have any of you
used this? Which permits 1/1 conferencing, direct dialup if I can ever
figure it out - and that would be unnerving. So call me up sometime at
166.84.250.149; chances are we won't connect (any more than usual). But at
least we won't be strangers, just disconnected.

Some topics I'm thinking about for the Perth conference -


Talking about _approach_ which needs to be both intervention and parti-
cipation, background and foreground. Acknowledging software options,
built-in issues of governance, filtering, connection bandwidth, user's
hardware requirements. 

As participant, extending one as far as possible into the virtual realm
vis-a-vis the application - working on the margins of the application in
relation to deconstruction on one hand, hacking on the other. Associa-
ting and disassociating levels (code, protocol, interface, phenomenology
of user interactions, psychoanalytics of virtuality, etc.).

Collusions of levels, for example traceroute indicating breakdown in oth-
er realms as well; the possibilities of IRC and its interrupts signaling
a relationship to the concreteness of the signifier within the textual
domain, and so forth.

The linguistic dispersion model of the Internet: floating applications,
languages, communities, modalities. 

---

From the viewpoint of virtual subjectivity, issues of the "ascii uncon-
scious," the signifier in Flaubert's St-Antoine or Hadamard's work as a
concretion/coagulation a posteriori. Issues of hysteric embodiment, de-
fuge, modalities of net sexuality. Making net sex real: increased phys-
icalities of responses. Abjections, masochisms, empowerment, control.

Life and death and Internet: mourning the impossible object. Leaving the
"home" application. Address, recognition, protocol: establishment of
presence. 

Bodies: Virtual, dismembered: dual regimes of fissure and dismemberment.
Cathecting and decathecting: phenomenology of the _limb_ (new). Phantom
limbs and limbless phantoms. The occasions of silent presence on CuSeeMe.

Collusions of real, Real, imaginary, uncanny, symbolic: dissolutions of
form within the realm of form. The construct of seamless virtual reality. 
Aesthetics in the midst of a newly-born realm (cuneiform antecedents).
The poverty of technical art, the modernist/postmodernist trajectory.

Geopolitical concerns: governance, Net povera, 300 baud phenomenology,
recapitulation of hegemonies and divisions of the world. Surface, spec-
tacle, display, simulacrum, specular: surfing.

Where we are not, where we would not be, where we have not been (where we
are not ourselves, where we would not be ourselves, where we have not
been ourselves): The _not_ in cyberspace (deflection, kill, delete):
shame, embarrassment, abjection. 

The nothing.

Phantoms, Bots, MOOs, Virtual Subjects, Devils


"Of necessity, a commodity-based society produces such phantom objectivi-
ty, and in so doing it obscures its roots - the relations between people. 
This amounts to a socially instituted paradox with bewildering manifesta-
tions, the chief of which is the denial by the society's members of the
social construction of reality. Another manifestation is the schizoid
attitude with which the nmembers of such a society necessarily confront
the phantom objects that have been thus abstracted from social life, an
attitude that shows itself to be deeply mystical. On the one hand, these
abstractions are cherished as real objects akin to inert things, whereas
on the other, they are thought of as animate entities with a life-force of
their own akin to spirits or gods. Since these 'things' have lost their
original connection with social life, they appear, paradoxically, both as
inert and as animate entities. If the test of a first-rate intelligence is
the ability to hold two opposed ideas at the same time and still retain
the ability to function, then the modern mind can truly be said to have
proved itself."

(Michael Taussig, The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America.)

Face:It


A Dewar's advertisement in the New York subway, B train from Brooklyn to
the Waverly/Sixth Avenue Stop: 

"It's not so much the 'Chat Room' as it is the sitting-home-alone-by-
yourself part that concerns us."

There are six black and white photographs of a man and terminal from
above; he's bleary, haggard. These alternate down the car with a color
display (includes the name "Dewar's" flanked by glasses with icecubes)
and other texts/images.

You shouldn't drink alone.

The ad catches _perfectly_ the very definition of "haggard" here; I've
seen his face over and over again, on myself, on CuSeeMe males, and even
the occasional woman. It's the face of waiting, but it's the face of ex-
haustion. It's the face of trembling, but it's frozen, spasmed. It's lit
by the screen. It's overwrought, immobilized. It's aged, furrowed, but
it's ageless. It leers, displays itself, but it's sullen, withdrawn. 

It has nothing. It eats alone, drinks alone, sleeps alone. Its cock
twists and ruptures. Its eyes are dead. Even the corporate is forewarned,,
foreclosed, splits at the ad's wound. 

It's the mask of death, but it's the haggard mask. It's the mask of rage,
but it's the mask of withdrawal. It can hardly see the bottle. It doesn't
drink. It's _stuff._ It waits, empty. It blocks the phonelines with its
machine. It pumps the phonelines with waiting. It waits for nothing. It's
a waste, a loser, drivel, mush, shit. It's cloacal. The face rides the
frozen subway. Tonight on the way back the train went no longer.

CuSeeMe is the heroin of the Internet. Oh so sweet, milky murky colors
where color is, slow coursing through the veins, eyes drawn back, soft as
ever can be, later coldness and the need for sight again. Oh-oh-sight's an
addiction, impulse, drive of the world, visual or aural, soft candy of the
world, impossible sweetness. Oh, pay a price for the sweetness of the
sweet soft world; hide the sugar chocolate wafers, gauge the price of soft
junkie arms, sweet eyes burned through the bottom of the world's skull. Oh
beautiful skin and sweet soft eyes everywhere on my world. You make them
go on, they'll follow you anywhere, sweet soft world and you and your
world coursing through their veins and always in the background.

Weatherman to Tell You Which Way the Packet Goes


The weatherman monitors the you-are. She ritualizes the health of site
after site, traceroutes the veins of the world, unites families and home-
lands, cauterizes lovers, breaks the psyche into two. She follows the
vagaries of new countries, from megabyte to centibaud and back again. The
weatherman with her laser pointer anoints the map of nodes and backbone
penetrations. She is responsible. She is responsible for the _overall
picture._ She determines the picture. 

She _is_ the picture. The weatherman is overall display, the protrusion of
the there-is. The weatherman is the there-is-it, the for-there-is. She
changes nothing. She wears no clothes. She is traced herself. She traces
her traces and that is who she is. She monitors the you-are. You are glad
to have her round and around.

I remember a conversation that I had in A. thirteen years ago with a young
French pastor. We were asking ourselves quite simply what we wanted to do
with our lives. He said he would like to become a saint (and I think it is
quite likely that he did become one). At the time I was very impressed,
but I disagreed with him, and said, in effect, that I should like to learn
to have faith. For a long time I did not realize the depth of the con-
trast. 

Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 21 July 1944

___________________________________________________________________________


To Faith


To have found faith; to have founded faith; to have had faith foundered.
The withdrawal of faith is not faith; it is done to one. I would say that
this is a concrete act in remission. To have faith is to found faith; even
broken on absurdity, it is a founding. To found faith proceeds from having
found faith; the difference rocks heaven. To have had faith founder is to
lose the founding, lose the foundation.

To have found faith is faith's extension; faith becomes faith is every-
where. Faith everywhere is a founding and a foundation. To have faith
founder is to lose faith's foundation; faith breathes through loss and
pure appearance. 

One loses faith through pure pictures. Faith is never found; faith is a
having-found or a finding. Faith is a moment from faith-in to the purity
of faith. The _in_ is the proper name of the finding.

Can a pastor in cyberspace speak a Word not subject to eternal transforma-
tion, transubstantiation? Can a word which is structured, dispersed, pack-
eted, be a Word eternal and untransformed? Can one preach to a flock as
hir words are taken from hir, from Hir? Who speaks here and for Whom, to
whom?  Who determines capitalizations, loci, cites and citations, excesses
of Latin alphabet? Who speaks for the Other, oneself, oneself in Other,
Other in oneself? And for others? 'And if not me, who then?'

The Future of the World: Internet Aesthetics and Reality's Cement Floor


I'm going to concentrate on the Net of fifty years from now, in relation
to under- and over-development world-wide. On one hand, we can assume a
more or less seamless virtual interface and reality - on the other, we can
assume that this interface is tied to corporate production and the cons-
truct of a new subjectivity, based on consumption and desire. 

(So on one hand, the real is the Real, parameters in n-space replacing the
free-floating noisiness of the physical. On the other, the parameters
_cost_; like certain explosives, they come complete with steganographic
corporate logos. The subject is forced into difference on the level of
nanotechnology, corporate viruses penetrating the skin; the subject be-
comes Subject, extruded.) 

(So on one hand, continuous upgrade, and on the other, debris-technology,
bricolage, poverty-enclaves, home-owners' associations. On one hand, seam-
less virtual reality; on the other, textual projection - see below.)

I'm going therefore to examine a wide variety of Net applications and
issues, ranging from low-bandwidth Web design to text-based "darknet"
communities and CuSeeMe. The future is _now,_  and we, not our children,
are _it._

(How communities develop. How first/second/third person sexualities occur
with text/CuSeeMe/phone/etc. The arguments against low bandwidth, restric-
ted speech - the _auraless_ world. _Timing_ and stuttering of speech. Hys-
teric embodiment, reading the other into oneself.)

(How bodies are stormed. How bodies storm: delirium. Dismemberment, re-
assemblage, prosthesis. The textual other as cyborgian. Narcissism and
echo: filtering returning the body through re-inscription. Elimination of
negation in cyberspace: alterity as self-construct. Interstices of vir-
tual subjectivity (extensions).)

(The phenomenology of the cement floor: true grit, dampness, and the gran-
ular.) 

(The infinite raster of the digital: the body returning to itself, disap-
pearance of the virtual machine.) 

Disentanglement - the Borromean knot of the subject: We're virtually
_there._

Hey everyone,

You should know about Travis. I'm writing because Travis can't write any
more. I don't know what's happened to him. I don't see him like I used
to. He told me to say this, all of it, even the bad stuff. I don't know
what he's talking about.

But he wants you to know it's not the wires, not the internet. It's not
the freedom he found there, or the fact that his skin grew pale, dis-
appeared in just about any kind of light. It's not his weight-loss and
if it's addiction, it's a new type.

Travis told me to tell you he's tired of thinking about addiction, that
you've got it all wrong. If it's addiction, he said, it's addiction to
reality, but you wouldn't understand this, just like you wouldn't under-
stand heroin or anything else without becoming part of it. An addiction
he said is just something you're not part of and you look in and you see
something you're not. And you don't know what that is, what you're not,
but it's over the boundary.

Travis said the boundary's inscribed, like drug, sex, internet. Travis
said there's always an inscription; you have to look for it, and it's
something you created in the first place. And you put all your energy
into the inscription, as if you've discovered something, but what you
fail to realize is that it's surrounding a place, just like you're in
your place. And he's tired of hearing about addiction, all his addic-
tions, and he doesn't want to hear about your addiction, but it's there
like an ugly real, Travis says.

There's not a real but reals, and everyone knows the sun from the moon
but some people prefer to inscribe their own illuminations. He says he
is closer to his body than you're closer to your own, and so who's the
addict here, who takes hirself beyond the pale. He says to tell you to
look to your own, but I haven't seen him for a while, so I can't bring
him back an answer.

He says he's real and he's stateless, he doesn't belong anywhere. But he
says it's more than that - he's in no-state, which you wouldn't under-
stand, because you only understand institutions from the outside in,
which is what institutions are, inscriptions and barriers just like the
word heroin or the word bible.

He says you can reach him on the internet, you can reach him on the
telephone or send him mail. He says you know how to reach him or you can
contact me and I'll get him. He wanted me to tell you this. He says he
can send you his ip number for sleazy net sex or his telephone number
just in case you have something to sell. He can send you his address and
you can send him just about anything you want that's not dangerous and he
wants you to know that he's not dangerous, he's just disappeared for a
while.

He says he's more real than you are and if you're real too you'll find
him.

love to everyone on these lists,

Clara

How I'd Like to Speak, How I'd Like to Hear from You


"What is distinctive and remarkable about the voice that Marx and Niet-
zsche share is not only its breathless pace, its vibrant energy, its
imaginative richness, but also its fast and drastic shifts in tone and in-
flection, its readiness to turn on itself, to question and negate all it
has said, to transform itself into a great range of harmonic or dissonant
voice, and to stretch itself beyond its capacities into an endlessly wider
range, to express and grasp a world where everything is pregnant with its
contrary and all that is solid melts into air. This voice resounds at once
with self-discovery and self-mocking, with self-delight and self-doubt. It
is a voice that nows pain and dread, but believes in its power to come
through. Grave danger is everywhere, and may strike at any moment, but not
even the deepest wounds can stop the flow and overflow of its energy. It
is ironic and contradictory, polyphonic and dialectical, denouncing modern
life in the name of values that modernity itself has created, hoping - of-
ten against hope - that the modernities of tomorrow and the day after to-
morrow will heal the wounds that wreck the modern men and women of today."

(From Marshall Berman, All That Is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of
Modernity, quoted in Robert Walser, Running with the Devil: Power, Gender,
and Madness in Heavy Metal Music.)

Machine/Anecdote/Divinatio



Tonight I have been trying for hours to teach someone basic commands for
downloading/viewing messages on the Internet. Like a lot of my students,
s/he hasn't read any background material, and won't. Teaching becomes a
matter of listing commands, presenting them as literal protocol senten-
ces, each independent of the others. The sentences function, not as sym-
bolic arrays, but as ikonic; they're proper names, and the "dir" in for
example "dir netscape/cache" is not the same "dir" as in "dir windows" -
in fact, both "dir" are independent diacritical modifiers, if they're even
that substantiated. 

This is the world of pre-Freudian psychoanalytics, going all the way back
to the Questions of Aristotle - an accumulation of stories, symptoms, op-
erations, non-systemic, or top-down systemic at best. Thus the humours are
top-down, as are the astrological signs; they presuppose totalities - as
opposed to bacterial classification, for example. The system that emerges
is related to magic, fetishization, empathetic phenomenology - not to a
generative or axiological ordering.

Without this ordering, the totality remains impermeable, foreclosed; 
learning becomes a matter of rote or brute force. Not only is very little
retained, but there is no room for error or anomaly. Now within tradition-
al structures, anomaly and error are absorbed; the structures are fuzzy.
Within the digital realm (without analog slippage), error can easily be
the matter of a single bit, and even semi-expert systems are relatively
uncompromising. 

Learning these machines becomes, then a matter of dialectic between top-
down and bottom-up; on one hand, say, understanding the GUI (Graphic User
Interface), and on the other, working through a knowledge - at the least -
of data structures.  With this approach, if something goes wrong, or if a
new application is downloaded from the Net, the user will have some idea
of how to continue. The totality will still be there, but it will be, on
some level, systematized. 

Such is the passing of illusions of _divinatio,_ the computer as the book
of nature, filled with wondrous signs. The greatest advancement in this
sense is the well-defined statement descending from an axiom set, a feel-
ing of regularity in spite of Godel, Tarski, Skolem, Church, and Cohen
(and don't forget that Godel remained a variant of platonist). Wondrous
signs are filled with excess, as we are here and in physical space; won-
drous signs leak, exude desire, scent, and taste. In programming, there
are no wondrous signs; statements are written according to the syntax or
they don't compile, or compile badly, or produce something else. There is
likewise no tolerance for wrong clicks spelling errors; there may be a
decent error-reporting facility ("close parentheses") or you may be en-
tirely on your own.

We're used to the magic. A car doesn't just _go_ - it _surges._ Our cat
thinks our thoughts for us. Current just _flows_ from the socket when a
lever is turned elsewhere in the room. And most of us, myself included,
can't tell exactly what goes on in the CPU. But you can't stop at the
level of the interface - you've got to, at least, peel the tissues back,
examine a bit of the nervous system, check memory and its management and
short-term and long-term memory...

Whole worlds are overturned. It's no longer enough to memorize Caesar.
Gender becomes pheromic, hormonic, environmental, genetic, hysteric. God
is a matter of cryptology or voiceover. The path not taken is charted by
the GPS (Global Positioning Satellite). Good fences make good neighbors
observed from the stratosphere and beyond. 

There's no conclusion here. For a youngster, the magic's still there and
all the way through, and the magic's tied to power, systems-control and
all things go. The system transforms into adolescent _urge_ - I've got
that even now - maybe the only difference is that I recognize the compon-
ents. And this is the legacy, in fact, of this entire century in our West
- the _component,_ and the problematic phenomenology accompanying it (just
as the assembly line and modularity characterized the 19th century, from
which humanity and the humanities despaired and fled and tried, unsuccess-
fully, to overturn, time and time again) ...

The Renunciation of Travis


I, Travis, known by my first name and pronoun, hereby and accordingly for
an indeterminate amount of time, do renounce any and all sexual activity
of a solitary nature, within which the respondent is apperceived of a
partner or partners by virtue of various electronic media, including tel-
phone, CB radio, Internet ASCII communications, and Internet video. I do
not renounce the solitary pleasures of Baywatch or binocular. My reasons
for such an action are the following:

1. I, Travis, have wasted countless hours bringing myself to culmination,
being brought to culmination by another or others, or bringing another or
others to culmination, without a positive indication of clear visual pre-
sence within my otherwise physical space.

2. I, Travis, have had night tremblings, furtive masturbations, sly hand-
gropings and finger insertions in attempts to sleep through late night or
early dawn; my situation has become one of disease, discomfort, and more
or less leaning to one side during ordinary (verbal) circadian physical
discourse.

3. I, Travis, have found myself waiting with hordes of virtual males, on
virtual fire, for one or another virtual woman to join our pathetic vir-
group. I have urged on women, bringing them to culmination while I have
waited without a clear and positive indication of pure visual presence
within my otherwise physical space. 

4. I, Travis, have been unable to renounce flesh for other pleasures in
my otherwise physical space, having no other pleasures. My work suffers; 
my eyes sting; my ears ring; my penis leaks; my mouth speaks and no one
hears. My scalp itches; my fingers twitch; my nipples ache; my arms
quake. I do get wakened in the night's middle by phantom limbs tearing at
my flesh. I do toss and turn with the burning-fire of sex soaking my
holes, splaying my legs, opening my mouths, scenting my nose. 

Only a total and final renunciation will eliminate the dreams of fulfill-
ment, the sweats, shivers, shudders, stutters, shakes; only a total and
final renunciation will give me the space and place to write my piece. If
I am a slight loss to you, I am a greater loss to myself; if I cannot see
your flesh opened for me _here,_ I cannot imagine the sounds of laughter
and weeping _there._ Please forgive me, and say no prayer, for there is
no God. 

I, Travis, on this day forward, do a-knighting go.

Stigma*


I'm out of the adult reflector site on CuSeeMe. I hadn't been on for a
while because of the waiting-males syndrome, which I found uncomfortable
(surely not-me...); when I tried to enter tonight, I found an ID number
required. I didn't have it, so I went to the IRC channel sponsoring the
reflector. The bot came on and stated that the ID number was given only to
those who had a + by their names - stick around for a while, and I might
be eligible. So it would have become a game of waiting again, becoming one
of the boys or girls, which is quite understandable; the message read "due
to abuse by some people," and the abuse wasn't specified. 

Was I the source of the abuse, insisting on the position of the voyeur
(di/splaying my body, but clearly ill at ease in the group); was it a spam
(I had, after all, left a while ago) of new people threatening or violat-
ing an unstated contract? Did the friends of the sysadmin fall off the
edge, was there a loss of identity involved? In any case, the site sealed
itself off, shut, sutured - and identity, forestalled, foreclosed, became
my own smashed issue; would I remain on IRC until recognized, join some
other, less (or more) secretive group, stay marginalized, nomadic, moving
on? Did I have any choice? Uncomfortable with groups in real life, I de-
termine not to frequent them on IRC or CuSeeMe as well. (Alas, of course,
my very damage renders fragile any such delusionary contract.)

Thus my identity follows me; a couples of weeks ago, for the first time in
months, I joined the IRC channel #truth, and was immediately banned. I had
said nothing; the ban continued until I finally signed off altogether.
What had I done, as a seeker after truth, not #truth, or perhaps that was
the issue after all? In reality, I'm sure there was no issue; either the 
chat was private, or someone was fooling around.

I churn in my own effluvia; it spatters, forms words, as if: here they
are.
