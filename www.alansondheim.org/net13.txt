LOVING HONEY II                                                HONEY2.TXT


The computer flooded my body, ended it; I don't remember faces, HONEY,
remembering you, your skin against the screen. We swallowed each other,
mouth against organ, juices bubbling over the tongue, wet eyes, wet 
hair, mouthing HONEY, you'd say, mouthing HONEY...

I no longer had time to waste! I'd press myself up against the TERMINAL
screen TERMINAL desire, my nipple against the O mouthing itself, taking
death away, healing all wounds! I would spread my legs as far as pos-
sible, exposing my hole; HONEY would open herself to the screen, an
uncanny blankness possessing us both. We had no secrets from each other!
We had all the secrets in the world! 

Our membranes devoured the glass, enchanted residue remaining on-line
off-line for days.

My mouth and HONEY's cunt: A double hollow! My cock and HONEY's fist:
Lozenge! My body would break on itself, a limited defile! We'd forget
the words; I'd clip motherboards to my nipples, serial cables in my
anus. The letters? Meant nothing at all in this most _real_ of all
spaces of the real!

You are a cathedral, I enter your nave! Your feet skid down parallel
wires; sliding into my testicles, ASCII spurts from your urethra,
ASCII spurts from my cock!

(Lulu): you always need the one you lose, I ought to know.
(Honey): Sometimes your body is an electron; sometimes my cunt gleams,
lighting Dante's ways in the dark woods of our desires!
Lulu is waving to Honey! Alan is bound to the wires!
Alan's cock is on fire! The way is long and dark! 
(Alan): Yes? Yes?
Siren just joined the channel.
(Honey): Your Yes penetrated me as the Lusitania sinks torpedoed in
the Atlantic Ocean! As splintered Titanic sinks beneath the waves!
(Alan): Andrea Doria! As the galleon went down! As the Florida Keys!
(Honey): The smell of you, that crease between your balls and cock!
(Honey): Say it! Say it again!
(Alan): Cunt! Cock! Clit!
(Honey): Say it! Say it again!
(Alan): Twat Rub A Dub!
(Honey): You trace me with your words, I trace you with mine! Murmuring
upon the screen, death Rub A Dub, Ring Around the Rosie poses Death
Begone!
(Honey): I am coming towards you, tongue gliding along the ground or
neutral, my words fileld with earth, with clay, my words a monument to
our love.
(Alan): Monument or grave, my tongue runs current towards you, a circu-
lation of electrons remaining on the outside of the figure, outside of
all representation!
(Honey): You are my representation, the source of iconicity, and I am
yours! Speech is the pressure of bodies, the other delimiting the wires,
delimiting ourselves and our presence among one another!
[stitched time of HONEY I]
(Alan): Which no longer belongs to us, belong to one another, it is you
or I who are typing, the two of us in uneasy confluence
(Honey): Confluence beyond confluence, beyond stuttering reach, the
topography of *together,* the binding of recognition as well
(Alan): A recognition which is all we have, are given, a recognition
confronting and conforming us
(Honey): Addressing each to the other, addressing ourself, conforming
ourselves to ourselves
(Alan): Thin sliver of words, shuddering on their way, carrying the 
weight of the world!
(Honey): Beyond which the dance ends, the tables are pushed back against
the wall, the cafe closes for the night, red and white checkered table-
cloths, candles, the sad violin
(Alan): The woods just beyond the village, the hill, meteors appearing
in depth, intense, for our benefit, for none other
(Honey): No one else, the sliver, thin language begin to fail us
(Alan): Frail, in the midst of worlds...
(Honey): In the midst of ellipsis, continuous and forever, dots tolling
the double entourage of the bell
(Alan): Honey, I hear it, speaking your name
(Honey): Alan, I hear it, speaking your name
Speaking the doubled name, name of the two, designators floating above
or within all possible, all conceivable worlds ...

HONEY, I said, HONEY, and she could hear my voice from the verge of the
bed heaving downward, listing towards an inconceivable floor; I was on
the telephone, each and every letter paled by the edges of the screen,
luminescent sweepings of the days events gathering in the corner of the
night of dusks and dawns.

MY FICTIONAL WAGER WITH DEATH WRITTEN IN A LOUSY STYLE


I write myself through the legend.

I shouldn't be speaking about this. I shouldn't be talking about this
in a forum so open, so free, filled with love; but I have a wager with
death. This is the wager that permits me to write, on the chance that
death comes early, that my texts are preserved with the intensity that
only imminence can bring. Already I find myself with unknown pains: not
only an increase in quantity, spreading across my arms and throughout
my chest, but also, a _transformation_ into new uncharted realms, end-
ing up on black and featureless shores. Uh, I long to go there; my sole
pleasure remains in these texts become intravenous, sputtering forth
almost against my will. They are macros or scripts, automated trans-
fusions, life-support for the impoverished. They continue against the 
eyelids, late-night projections, and they need not continue there. 

The wager consists in working the edge, producing something of value
which permanently leaves me, while I teeter, looking directly into an
absurd abyss that may well be of my own making. Yesterday, while teach-
ing, I felt a sheet of trembling spreading across my chest and arms, an
armor of sorts against the indescribable everyday life that interests me 
less and less. Sooner or later, I will succumb, the texts folding them-
selves inwards, above me; tent-like, uh, I will transform into the book 
itself, and no longer be among you. 

This is the legend, the legend of leaving. As if, uh, there were a place
to go, safe harbor simultaneously within and without life, the fucking
ghost. But no place is safe, anywhere, anywhen; each carries the lure
of prospective degeneration. You are dead when you know this. You are
dead when you can write it down.

Uh, this is the legend: I'm the tortured artist. This is the legend: I 
haven't long to go, long to live. This is the legend: I'm poor, sacrifi-
cing everything for my art, writing into the void. If I didn't believe 
this, I couldn't continue, I, uh, would no longer be among you.

I can't make this literature, something like the will of Chatterton,
which he wrote, refusing to die "that the most perfect Masters of Human,
uh, Nature in Bristol distinguish me by the title of the Mad Genius." 
I too refuse to die, the only linkage between the two of us, refuse, as,
uh, the writing shoves itself out between my legs, one sex, uh, one hole 
or another.

BEING AND NOTHINGNESS


The book itself provided the miasma of a body, the attribute of each
and every book. _taking a plunge into the darkness of jean-paul, cold-
war blackness hole._ The furrows or striations of the hole provide the
ledge upon which cold-names are written. The writing goes szzhszzhszzh
goes szzhszzhszzh, granite grind-away, water dripping endlessly down.
It is always replenished. The absence of the wind in cyberspace quick-
dries the eyes themselves.

_coldwar blackness hole absorbing tautology, absolutism, contradiction
- taking the diving-board into oblivion - that's it - that's the way to
go._ Being projects itself into cyberspace, the invasion of nothingness
equivalent to the problematic ontology of packets hopped from one to 
another node, thirty-hop maximum. Cyberspace is existential; Being and
Nothingness is the cyberspatial body.

_the presence of the hole at the end of the text, the presence of slime
situated in the position of the cloaca: where was this text going, if 
not the flesh itself, shit falling nestled against the open mouthing of
the conclusion? The body stammers to a halt._ Elsewhere:

Elsewhere, _pierre meets jean-paul in the middle of the work or near
the beginning or ending of the middle of the work or near the beginning
of the end... not a sign of the cloaca, drinks at a small cafe, you can
almost see the gaze of the waiter, almost feel the liquid, absinthe
perhaps, descending._ Communality drives the body forward in its re-
sponse to the construct of essence defining existence. And that's it!
That's it in the French Resistance, that's it elsewhere: Clearly, in
cyberspace, essence defining existence! The door opens, once upon a 
time, essence concretizes, existence _rises to the cause._ Essence
spreads its legs, the response makes the mark, intentionality once the 
screen opens to the void!

Or is it the other way around! No matter, it comes to the same thing, 
responsibility on the part of... everyone. Being and Nothingness: _I
always thought of this as a transfused-body, interpenetrated with lack
or absence, the whole thing a rim-job... And the hole at the end of
the text turned it into a mouth: I remember this!_

A reverse existentialism! Not an essentialism at all, but a diarrhetic
essentialism, Derrida's future anterior coagulating in the form of a
human cybernaut! This is already portended, I claim, in the weight of
the book itself, the spine that of the body, the ending messing every-
thing, cleaning out the debris of metaphysics, preparation for cyber-
space within the French Resistance, the resistance of cyberspace itself.

PALMTOP NESTLED IN THE COMFORT OF MY HAND

1.
Maybe theory often proves its way.
With hard science, I shall improve my cause.
Casuistry still rules by light of day,
But night shall warrant truth within its claws.
The reason?
That the symbol knows no season.
The symbol brings the world within dark clasp;
Black sign against black time is all we grasp.
The `lineaments of gratified desire'
Play to a cold, invisible black fire.
No letters white are seen
Against the dark machine
That loses, forms symbolic forms for hire.
2. 
That about does it. Even the economy of the sign appears in the last
line. Symbols dark against dark? Certainly: eliminate the body of the
sign. Letters white? The legend of the Torah plays a role here.
3. 
I keep looking for _that_ book, _that_ symbol that constructs suture.
On _that,_ worlds run and worlds collapse. The wound remains.
4.
_Internal vs. Projected Space:_
[
The _other_ location is the domain of the body itself, its extensions,
what exists within its field of grasp. The _palmtop_ is a step towards
the introjection and darkening of the symbolic.
What _penetrates_ the domain of the body caresses and attacks; body
responds through defensive/reaction mechanisms.
I devour you when you come to me.
_Negation_ is at the heart of communication. You come to me: I defend,
penetrate, am penetrated. The body _physically_ couples within reach.
[
Cyberspace is always already other, incapable of physical negation;
what occurs is always images burned within the eyelids. Everything and
nothing invades. _Palmtop_ curls the body around the symbolic. Typing
at the desk, symbolic leers: I look ahead, slightly up, towards the 
screen, the horizon of projected space.
                                            _________________
The letters are black on a green field.     |               |
The letters are white on a black field.     |               |
The letters are black on a white field.     |     GLOW      |
The letters are white on a blue field.      |               |
The letters are black on a red field.       |_______________|

When I erase an _e_ for example, I erase no history whatsoever. History
is redrawn at 60 fields/second on _my_ machine. Palmtop stabilizes,
glowless. It whispers to me in the absence of letters. Glow black on
green _now._ (Now you know everything about me.)
5.
This weekend, alone with my computers. _GLOW._

DRAWN FORTH THE HARD ONE

From P.J. Harvey I draw the thread of the body at ten degrees from
the vertical.

From Heidegger, I draw the path in the woods, and from Irigaray, the
flood. From Kristeva, I draw the Flood.

I draw packets from the theory of infinitesmials, and from the
linguistic structure of Old Hittite, the reverse syntactic framework
of the Query. From Derrida, I draw the query.

From the touch last of your hands, your hands riven against me, 
my eyes, my lips; from your last glance backwards drawn away on an 
rainy day, I draw Jacques Prevert and autumn leaves, draw your body 
through the wires.

I draw the memory of that body upon the desert of Jabes, circular 
paths on the way from water to water.

From Nicole Brossard, I draw my body forth, and from Kathy Acker, 
I offer it so thoughtlessly drawn, and drawn away.

From theory, I draw the natural, and from nature, I have drawn theory,
in and out of order. And from anthracite seams in Pennsylvania, I have 
drawn and erased the obdurate of the real. 

From the Ancients, I have drawn the value of exact discourse, held
steadfast in an era of sparse population, communication at the speed
of a horse or railroad locomotive. I have seen words in combinations 
precise with history, the distance between them constituting a portal, 
from the language into the language.

And now, I see the computer reproducing the secret writing of childhood.
The screen returns to you in the form of a gift, the resurrection of
language at the faintest murmur of the breath, the proof positive of
wounded life, and the suturing of that wound: O, something remains!

O, something remains!

Our Cybermind


Papers published earlier on cybermind now appear elsewhere in cyber-
space itself; the archives to date keep records of the several mega-
bytes of material that have already passed by. URL information in 
the addresses of posters lead to other menus, by and large home 
pages in which images appear briefly on the screen. Threads conjure
up the potential for a coherent discussion often interrupted by the
presence of others. List postings splinter, divide, and regroup as
other connectivities are generated; the smallest unit is the private
post from one to another correspondent. Usenet groups are regularly
raided for information to repost, and on occasion cybermind announce-
ments are sent out to Usenet groups, an entirely different selection.
Data from the World Wide Web rolls in, is broken apart, then shifts
through cybermind for redistribution. Other distant email lists such
as Net-Happenings provide sources of information; other sputterings
connect these lists to the cybermind mothership. Local email lists 
such as those on the Spoon collective splinter off themselves, feeding 
information to cybermind which is recollected and redistributed else-
where. Telephone calls and postal mail supplement the aura of cyber-
mind, producing other forms of contact which pass in and out of the
matrix. Administration of cybermind and other Spoon collective lists
occurs in this case through telnetting into world.std.com and at times
messages are redirected from world.std.com back into cybermind itself.
Private email posts arrive from outside the domains of the lists in
their entirety and are reposted in full or in part; replies are given
by means of private posts as well, one or another cybermind subscriber
acting as temporary conduit. Downloading from ftp creates files which
are then reposted on cybermind and now studiously archived in Norway by
Marius Watz who also keeps the Internet Text that is exhibited in the
form of packets on cybermind and fiction-of-philosophy. Archives are
also kept here in the form of texts with stripped addresses, which are
re-examined now and then for further input into the current cybermind.
Bounced cybermind messages end up at times at spoon@world.std.com
where they are redistributed after examination. Bounced or misspelled
or user-unknown addresses are often held temporarily at world.std.com
before deletion, but badly formatted addresses are immediately erased
in order to preserve the functioning of the list. Posts from every 
member of cybermind who posts are redistributed to every member of 
cybermind; the same is true for fiction-of-philosophy. Fiction-of-
philosophy is the sister-list or brother-list of cybermind, and there
is considerable cross-posting between them and on occasion with the
cousin list of Future Culture. Fiction-of-philosophy and cybermind are
moderated by the same moderator, but it is an open moderation, only a
closed subscription format, in order to check subscriptions requests as
they arrive. Someone on occasion will gopher to a specific site and
report on the site to cybermind. Cybermind and the other lists on the
Spoon collective are listed at a number of sites themselves, for pur-
poses of supplying pertinent information to potential subscribers. The
information sheets on world.std.com are also periodically checked and
sometimes updated, and the moderator of cybermind sends specific in-
formation to any number of correspondents who request it. The moderator
also sometimes subscribes or unsubscribes individuals who request such
activity, which is done directly with a password from his (or her) own
account, without the necessity of telnetting into world.std.com. Some-
times, in search through cyberspace, one will come across the name of
someone who has left cybermind a long time ago, and the glimmer of 
recognition will bring forth a happy smile. Sometimes one will locate
the email address of the long-missed person, and contact him or her and
there will be many happy memories. In the midst of the passing of in-
formation, in the midst of the wires and fibre-optic cables and packets
travelling close to the speed of light, there will be many happy mem-
ories. Sometimes images are sent near the speed of light from one end
of the Net to the other, and sometimes they end up on cybermind, where
they pass through quickly, downloaded and embarked through translation 
software, producing beautiful pictures.

THE DEMON


The demon stopped me. Tracks led from the house to the bottom of the
slope. It was raining out, a torrent of mud and small stones, twigs
and branches, funnelling into streamlets turned into rivers. It was
night in the mountains, and there was a sheen in the thin glacial
crevices, covered with green-black moss, just like everything. It was
night and mist rose everywhere and the demon rose with the mist.

Armor netting covered her, thin wooden boards held pinned by thick 
wire, thin metal plates held pinned by wooden rivets. Boards were 
hinged to plates, wire to rivets, helmet mechanics covering and reveal-
ing her face, the samurai mask held high with demon horn. Her breast 
was bare, look at my breast she said. The house creaked in the wind and 
rain, water blew in sheets and gales of sheets, the boughs of the pine 
bent almost to the ground, you couldn't see the top of the mountain. 
Look at my breast, she said, turned towards the car juggurnaut, viola-
tion fabric of human flesh beneath its wheels, the moss-ice forming wet
furrows behind and before it, the miracle of the furrows; but I was
through with the turning. Scroll cut in at the pleasure of the breast,
scroll held me, what was round held itself off, the body an inflation
beyond the rim, beginning with the nipple, ending with the furrow of
the back. Culture and universe inflated, Kwakiutl resistance, down on
the plain where the shtetl lived.

Look at it, look at it, she said. Look at my breast. I would ride yab-
yum radio through shakti, shekinah waiting, streams pouring from her
body, water-matrix, look at it. The turning would emerge, scroll else-
where, I thought of ghost-trap cybermind, ghosts along the wires, of
a rocky field I had fallen among the rocks, a stony shore I had stum-
bled on the tones. Look at it, look at my breast.

(Later which was now which was then it occurred to me that I could 
inhabit the breast, kiss the breast, see the breast, gaze at the 
breast, touch the breast, press the breast, suck the breast, bite 
the breast, squeeze the breast, caress the breast; I could rub the 
breast, massage the breast. Look at me, look at my breast, she said, 
and there was the turning which I was through with, but I could not 
look, could not inhabit, could not kiss, could not see, not gaze, 
touch, suck, bite, caress, squeeze, caress, rub, massage the breast.)

My Medical Expert System


My new palmtop came with medical software, a patients' directory that
allows me to track the condition of everyone around me. I can enter
my friends' names in it, complete with their illnesses, my drug treat-
ments for them (also whether they're cured), and the symptoms that led
to my diagnoses in the first place. I carry the palmtop everywhere I
go, tracking their progress from day to day. I love doing this because
I know all the time just how they feel! Here are some results.

Unable to resist, I begin with myself. I must admit I am not a medical
doctor (although I have propensities, like everyone else, in that di-
rection); some of the terminology may in fact seem resplendent and of
my own making. But it is a patients' medical directory, and as true as
can be!

NOTES FROM ALL OVER


I would like a memorial to be held for me _before_ I die. I would like
people to say, what beautiful writing. I would like them to say, it 
means so much to me. I would like wonderful pictures, films, and videos, 
made about my life. I would like to see them. The best memorials appear
after someone dies. This is unfair; life, not death, should bring out 
the best in people.

I carry around a text in my head for days, a text such as this one. It
incubates; unlike the immediacy of email, the texts choke the computer, 
waiting, one by one, for their development. While working on the medi-
cal text, this one came to mind, this one appeared, almost naturally, 
since death is the barrier of life, and procrastination the barrier of 
the text.

Michael Current's posts, like mine, bring desire into the configuration
of the surface itself. This is not to say that _they desire,_ but that
the _chora_ is readily visible, that the iconicity of the text creates
a simulacrum of embodiment. The body twists, turns, caresses, and is
caressed through slow reading. This renders a text of love, a semantics
of love, its hollow. The desire curls in upon itself; the curling images
the body.

The texts live among palmtop, laptop, desktop. I move from imminence in
the midst of a tiny implement conjuring the body's curl, through laptop
(on the order of textwork, _traumwerk_) _in bed, in hand,_ to desktop 
re-articulation. I step back or aside; the writing finally begins to 
breathe for itself, the languor setting in, the aural or sensate odor 
of the body. As the writing reaches the final solution, the machinery
increases in size.

The texts are sliced by the wires, of course, courtesy of TCP/IP proto-
col. They are doubly reconstituted, formally, and through the act of
reading. Existing between the ephemera of email posting and the hardness
of stone, they invite little response, but appear hardened emissions or
demarcations in the course of a busy day. This is the nature of the 
philosophical in cyberspace, surfing through cyberspace, carried by it.
This is the writing of the future. This says goodbye to the writing of
the past.

Rage: Sometimes the Net doesn't work, signals go down in flames, kilo-
bytes are lost. What then? One rewrites and rewrites to no avail, any
sense of the self disappears, every call goes unanswered. Rage sets in,
encumbered by the normal fluidity of the Net. Suddenly, the monster
rears itself as a confluence of protocols; no longer a window, not even
a mirror, it becomes machinic, an industrial revolution of rods and
levers. The skull appears. Fury gapes through the open wound; everyone
who can't have a piece of the action wants a piece. I become desperate,
dis-membered of a communality I now war against. The Net, which is never
ever alive, always forces this, the confrontation of dismemberment with
dismemberment, and dim memory of a self that felt whole before emerging
to engage with dead and inchoate wires.

Cybersex and real-world automobile accidents: I could write a book on 
how they don't mix. At the moment something in Brooklyn is up in flames,
not down like signals. Sirens everywhere, the second night in a row. I
became sick with the stress of it, vomited. Anger is an energy (Lydon)
but only so far before the body devours itself from within, collapses
on the deck chair of the S.S. Lusitania. The more hollow I am, the more
desperate for Wire, for Scroll. I close my eyes and nothing happens; a
migraine's setting in, no place for the text-rush that should unfold the
day to the universe, the universe to the day.

Cybersex is the attempt to make the body _be,_ screen or no screen. Un-
like real sex, which tests the limits of the body, diffuses borders,
meanders through random epistemologies like a trackless freight-train,
cybersex is ontological. I attempt to _produce myself,_ to have the
flesh _mean,_ and therefore exist. Words furiously gallop across the
screen; they're unaccountable, go nowhere, aren't even buffered. They
try the ridiculous reproduction of the physical, the sound of orgasm,
the impression of a hand or tongue. Texts bend out of shape, but like
propositional logic, remain texts. Cybersex exists, more than any other
form, on the margins of the written. No matter how much I present as
REWRITE, I remain in lower ASCII.

The sirens are now everywhere, as if the building itself is surrounded.
I am in Brooklyn and something big is going down, and Brooklyn big is
big. Meanwhile the Net stutters to a halt again like a crushed butter-
fly, coccoon memory, leaves.

Will appear, defying imagination, just a prop
Which makes the viewer beg them to stop
Heming and hawing, but find an animal to rage
Or better yet, place star and starlet in a cage
To see what happens. The beast is off again to Bermuda,
As for the star and starlet, I could've clued ya.

GRISTLE


(Re: The recent error message explosion on Fiction-of-Philosophy._


Gristle is the _stuff_ of the Net, the assertion of the inert vomiting
back the spew as in Sartre, the obdurancy of it, an existence trans-
versing communication itself, refusing communication...

What's given is the absence of control, so the flood/spew occurs on
another lower level (what we take for granted is high-level languaging).

One level drops through another. That's what happened when the list
overflows with exponentially-increasing error messages. The _stuff_ 
appears, the nauseous. Working on correcting the situation, I literally
vomited, repeatedly, over the toilet, one or another spew, emission.
What ordinarily remains hidden, completes digestion. The Net surfaces,
always surfaces. This wasn't surface; this was the gristle.

The gristle, by virtue of the fact that error is _any_ content, is 
always already abject. Nothing can get to it. It ignores meaning, which
is a higher-level construct. Or it constructs any meaning at all, which
is the destruction of meaning. When gristle falls apart, the meat of
the surface is revealed.

One always learns from error; it's only error that opens the wound 
that's always present, sutured, _civilized._ Embarrassment, error, 
shame, expose the interiority of the machinics of cultural confluence,
communality, the apparently flawless realm of the signifier. Clearing
out the _stuff_ of files thickened with repeated error messages, the
inertia of the Net appears. This is _it._ Nothing is even said, sayable
when _everything_ is said, exponentially and in quantity...

_The bones showed through. Gristle. I vomited them up._

FRAY AND SEDUCTION


The seduction of cyberspace... I am enveloped by posts, the body tremb-
ling with the unknown, slivers held back. The less you say of yourself, 
the more the other is drawn forward, downward; the more you open your-
self, the more penetration. A dangerous game, displaying each and every 
secret, or releasing them as a stuttered flow, the orgasm of knowledge
itself. What do I know about you? What will you tell me? Sometimes I
receive messages from strangers, do I write to strangers? Sometimes I
receive openings, texts fluttering apart like paper cranes. All of us
are pooled in cyberspace, marsh-liquidities, nomadic, devouring the
impossible. It is seductive because it is incapable of achievement. It
is seductive because the space suddenly and momentarily fills with per-
fume. Lured in, seduction is the phenomenology of the _nipple,_ its all-
defining circularity, the territory of the breast outlined against the
memory of the screen, screen-memory, screen-mammary. In fashion, the
nipple is indexical, not the lure itself, but the reference of the lure.
The nipple pools cyberspace; wet with tongues, mouths, eyes, its mois-
ture reflects a writing scragged across terminal desire.

On the net, I falter: What would I give for _your_ presence here? This,
too, is a lure, your knowledge of my absence and my absence within my-
self. We are pockets for one another. We fill one another with the 
caress of language we _would have_ spoken to one another long ago, but
we could not speak, could never speak, in each other's presence, and
what emerged were only platitudes, stupidities, as I would think later.
And in the end, we only merge with ourselves, a sliver of seduction
cutting through the flesh or the wood, splitting the self in a fragment
of language left in some other apartment, home, loft, wherever our 
temporary and fumbling connections were made, "safe" pretending.

( Does seduction involve the parasitic? There is always a third party
present, the absented indexical slant of the case. On the Net, there
is a profusion or coagulation of absences - blurred ontological bound-
aries. The post _itself_ is seductive, since the body is _inconceivably_
present (the third party?), which is not to say absent in its entirety,
if the performative is to have any gainsay. For here the performative
constructs the body, as I have _pointed out_ elsewhere, the body of the
space installed and inflated by the post itself.

Because text is the only priority of seduction on the Net, seduction
bends the text, a form of accommodation at a remove from analytic phil-
osophy. Communication here exists within post-structural poetics; what
else could account for absence in its absence. So that communication is
distorted by absence; only _protocol_ remains unproblematic, since with-
out pipeline, communication ceases on the surface. To _read_ in this 
space is to be assured of machinery and its symmetrical substructures,
automorphisms, everything in place. It is the surface that becomes dis-
rupted in seduction, a folding or crinkling of the skin. )

( There is always a third party present; to seduce is to seduce in the
presence of others, to splay the body open, expose its secrets. For that
matter, the third party may be the first or second; there is a doubling
of conceit at work, no matter. And there are whole bodies, properly 
coupling through cams implying _something else_ within the interior, the
flux of the secret itself. Then there is the _housing._

The _housing_ is the world. The _housing_ is every conceivable subject.
I will write you, but you must not tell me your name. I will make love
to you, but I must never know the date of your birth. I will fuck myself
in your presence, cyberghost that I am, but you must never reveal the
color of your hair. 

I will lend you a _cut_ into the world at an angle, slant at ten degrees
from the vertical, the slit of exposed flesh, really nothing more than
a line. Cutters bleed from far more and from far less. )

Ah, Clara, the _lure_ presents us to ourselves. How trivial! Let's sink
into Pascal's abyss together, swallowed up by the enormity of dead wires
and outcast servers. One last parting of the lips...

Interview/Critique with Clara Hielo Internet:

What Sondheim never took into consideration in his early Internet Text,
is the complete seamlessness of virtuality that we have achieved - the
totalization of an alternative Real. Unlike the promises of "classic" 
artificial intelligence, virtual reality has been well ahead of sched-
ule (I remember reading that something would be fully operational by
2040, for example). We knew, even then, that it was always a question
of computational mass, not concept; the latter had already been worked
out (neural networking, and post-MPEGn compression techniques helped a
lot). Isn't it true that Sondheim's text, on the other hand, seems to
concentrate on the old ASCII - that it might be fair to consider it 
more of a meditation on _writing_ than anything else.

But something has said that nothing could be farther from the truth. He
points out that even text _always_ embodied ghosts, as we would say, in
whatever form. He points out as well that the complex issue of the real
itself, virtual or not, has always been central to his writing. At times
he distinguishes between real and Real, and at times he does not. He was
aware of this _splintering_ inherent in the text.

Everything is signal, everything is SCROLL, Sondheim has said, stressing
REWRITE as a condition of the real (And REWRITE, as well as SCROLL, of
course, need not imply the written; they occur within _any_ virtuality
or real whatsoever. Paramecia REWRITE, if not SCROLL. So do cyborgs.) 
There is always a sending and receiving in relation to the body; the
difficulty is that the _model_ (derived from communications technology)
diffuses - there are no entities involved, only the nexi of emissions,
spews, and vocalizations - and these can occur in any form, writing (i.
e. grammatology), or not.

We brought up the issue of seduction, the caress, sexuality, which seem
to pervade much of the text. Wasn't this a Freudianism in disguise? Or
an other form of reductionism, or even a reduction of the Other? But
Sondheim has countered, I think successfully, that desire pervades vir-
tuality - that virtuality is _driven_ in fact. (Could this be the dif-
ference, the _driven_ of the virtual, in relation to the obdurancy
[Sondheim again] of the real?] He has gone on to say that SCROLL itself
is the very stuff of ghosting, that what remains of the self (Freud, 
Lacan, Garner, or not) gets lost in the tangle - like a Tibetan ghost-
trap. He calls this trapping "the Skein," stressing the coagulative or
reconstitutive aspects of being-in-cyberspace. He also stresses that
being-in-cyberspace is equivalent to Being-in-cyberspace, a difficult
relation to Being. And he has gone so far AS TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF
CYBERSPACE ITSELF (at least in this regard, but it is unclear how far in
fact he has gone). Instead, he appears to postulate that there are _con-
fluences of the real._ More and more, there is something pre-Socratic 
about this thought, which, he feels, must liquify in order to reflect
the exigencies of virtuality, the age we find ourselves in.

He has stated that his thinking has not changed on these matters at all.
He has also stated that his production of Internet Text, along the lines
of the nineteenth-century feuilleton, has been a continuous one, but 
that the later portions neither invalidate nor supplement the earlier 
ones. Instead, the work as a whole represents a phenomenological trans-
formation without beginning or end, a mobius-structure.

So, the Internet Text - was it conceived as a kind of journey, then? No,
because there is no destination, as I have just indicated, because it 
neither reflects movement nor stasis. Ontic states _shimmer_ - think of
them as molcular, spectral lines of absorption. That's the model I would
use, and I am sure he would approve. Neither one nor another part is any
more than one or another. They are of equal and encompassing intelli-
gence. I can't say that I play favorites here.

"HOW I JOINED THE UNIX"


With NET stockings, T. VERONICA would LIST to one side. I didn't want 
to FINGER her or SERVER. Her narrow WAIS raised a HOST of questions in 
the WORLD. WIDE WEB or not, you I TEL, NETted were her stockings - as I 
said, sheE MAILed me a pair of them. "What a LYNX you are," she said, "a
regular MOSAIC of TALK N' TALK." I pulled out my JUGHEAD (it's this kind
of POST), and replied, "T. CP? IP!" I could really GOPHER her! I begged,
"Let me watch you!" Silence. "Are you deaF, T.? P!" As if that made me a
man, like ARCHIE! "You're all UNIX," she said in return. "And as for 
stockings, I would USE NET only..." 

"DOS all right," I'd PIPE. "LINE me up." I smiled, bared my teeth. The
next thing I knew, she was yelling "U U BIT NET and tore my new pair up!
F A Q formed, you'd be the first to go!" But I kept begging, "P, G, P!" 
to no avail. I was getting HYPER, TEXan that I am. INTERNIC of time, she
said, "U U C P?" What a SITE! I almost SLIPped on her PP. P, I thought,
I'll COM for you. PING! INTERNET everything is possible! She was getting
angry. She said I was like all the others, MAIL, BOXed my ears! DO MAIN
thing is, I should've used EXPERIMENTAL VERONICA; I was hardly a MAN any
more. What a BAUD! She really took a BYTE out of me... BYE.

PRESENTATION OF THE SELF


I will ask the questions and you will respond extemporaneously, so to
speak. I recognize you speak from the position of the male, or is 
that true or not true. And that you choose to appear naturally. So 
already there is a question of the natural, but this leads us either
too far afield or already at the heart of things. Please begin again.
Choice is involved to what extent on the Net. I can pick any identity
I want but try to be true to myself. That means that I will be as  
honest as possible. My age is a difficulty. I am 51 but that gives clo-
sure only to my demographic appearance. If I tell you that I look and
act a lot younger, what of it. You've heard it all before; like me, you
have stereotypes. The presence always leaks out, a certain moroseness
perhaps. Of gender transformation, the label would carry a great deal.
Some of you may be other than what you seem. The choice comes almost
naturally at times. The Net is not though an extension of the writer,
but can be as well a choosing of the writer. There are no definitive
structures here. But these ghosts that inhabit the wires, that is a
form of reception theory. Exactly, which is the production or flow of
introjections, projections, scrolls, rewrites, addresses, recognitions,
protocols, all those things. The lure is already a form of masquerade.
Yes, and it might as well be in the hand, given as a consequence of the
Net. Surely issues of embodiment are paramount; without the body, lure
and construct are always already at play in a radically different way
than in face-to-face communication, or even ordinary postal mail - those
areas where the grain of the text or voice dominates. So you try? What I
try is really of little consequence; what is important is to see the
Net as a playing field of communities and communications, not as an in-
formation highway, which implies a point-to-point linearity. The latter
may serve as a model (based on the telephone system) but it further 
implies a bracketing of points. I say, vectors and emissions, not 
points. I say that points imply well-definitions, and we are dealing in
terms of the subjectivity of this space with something else entirely. 
And will continue in the future to think of this as an essential differ-
ence. But you were saying about your age. Or sex, or what I reveal, that
in certain circumstances, I might not present any of this, but that it
is important to open up, not only for community, but for the sake of the
text itself, the edginess of this text. So that desire also appears, but
of course if one changes gender on the Net, desire also appears. Could
one say that it is only desire that is never in disguise. I would think
so. And what would govern, say, a man wanting to present himself as a
woman, a woman as a man. The differend of the socius, I imagine, the
latter as a temporary empowerment in terms of avoiding harassment, that
might be paramount, and then also as exploration, feeling out trans-
sexuality or homosexuality, but always with an edged empowerment. And 
the former as a means of exploration, feeling out transsexuality. It's
complicated. One could appear as a woman for the guise of homosexual re-
lationships, but also for a releasement based on introjection/projec-
tion, the feeling that women as the object of desire then become incor-
porated into the male as desiring object, so a narcissism, as when a 
male, for sexual reasons, shaves his body hair, self and other simul-
taneously. And the same would presumably hold for women in the other 
direction, but with a difference, because of the order of oppression and
the overt sexist nature of the Net in a number of _theaters._ I would 
imagine, in fact, that there is little or no posing on most email lists,
just slightly more on Usenet, and more on chat-lines, IRC, MOOs, MUDs,
and the like. And in each of these cases, there's a difference between
crossing and passing, although the difference may be unclear. Of course
anywhere a woman may pass as a man or another woman or a man may pass as
another man or another woman. Are you saying then again these are equiv-
alences. No, there is an imbalance which sets the wheel in motion so 
to speak, the imbalance of relations of oppression, which is carried 
over from real life to the Net, with the double change as I have said, 
that first of all, one can be other than what one is in real life, and 
also, that one might be freer to speak the sexual, most often in an 
oppressive way of course from male to female, but also freer to speak 
the sexual in other, more exploratory and deepening ways as well. But 
this will come to be in the future more and more, these other ways, 
providing the Net remains a non-regulated field or membrane, providing 
desire is permitted to flow throughout it as a chaotic manifold of 
intensities and releases, much, I add, as in a real-life sexual exper-
ience which uses the edge, the transgressive, as a means of retardation. 
What is most often the case, as here, is that one loses the train of 
images, loses the stasis of identity, consciously or unconsciously 
constructed, and is cast adrift, and it is here that the subject 
actually _works_ through subjectivity in various ways, as I am doing 
here. As in: who is speaking, who is questioning, who is answering, and 
who constructs the space. And always to remember that this is a _case_ 
of the gendered masculine, to the extent that gender is an excess or 
withdrawal from the performative. In other words you mean. I mean gender 
as in part physiological, and age of course, as wholly, or so it seems, 
physiological, beginning and ending with what can only be constituted as 
a fragment or torn remnant of a field of desire and identity. So you are
saying. For both women and men, an equality, flickering, empowerment, a
difference or presence, constituted internally or externally, yes.

THE BUFFALO


Tiffany rode the jeep into the terminal, screen black on black or
screen four-by four. I wanted, I said turning towards the dust on the
soles of her feet, I wanted you. I wanted, I wanted to quote, to talk
you the talk of the older writing, when there were no screens. When 
desert was the moment into the sun when the flesh burned off. Now
everything's scroll, your name confronts me, I suck the letters of 
your name, suck the air for lines winding down the glass. I can't see
the sun for the life of it; words burrow into me, scratch your skin-
lines deeper than I ever wanted to go. I moved towards the depression
where the tar pit lay, water-buffalo on their sides mewling for help.
So then the writing came:

The Buffalo: Meaning is our despair.
The Buffalo: There are no signs and no signifiers.
The Buffalo: Nothing can be assembled from chaotic debris.

But: The natural condition of the real is absolutely meaningless.
But: The copula. Tiffany and I rolled across each other, rolled each
other's lips into the dust of the desert, cracks of the desert, debris
and sand of the desert, water-buffalo mewling, suffocating, drowning
in the darkened interiors slowly grinding to a halt.

The Buffalo: The copula exists only as substance.
The Buffalo: The copula is not an implication of substance, but is (and 
does not produce) the substance of language, which is not the same thing
as sonority.

But she filled me with tar, filled her with the same. Healing up, move-
ment slowed down like the omega-point, oh, we'd live forever. Up through
the anal, penile canals, the instestines, penis hardened in permanent 
erection, testicles frozen in the black edges of the pit. Copula copula-
tion. So then it began.

Naked, Copula Copulation ran across the sand. Her long dark hair flowed
across your face like sand, or tar. She was there, wet dream of the 
bull, gift to others of herself, but giving the stone which my hardened
body was to any taker. So then. So then a dreaming because I thought I
heard her, ears choked with tar tornado:

CC: The deadening of the copula permits the displacement of the despair
of meaning, its relegation elsewhere.
CC: Despair is continuous and death is the only noun.
CC: The noun is the limitation of the verb. The noun remains within the
sentence organized against the verb.
The Buffalo: You're sentenced to death for the BUILT ENVIRONMENT.

I was sentenced to death for the BUILT ENVIRONMENT. I was sentenced to
death by the tar and the copula of the tar, fucked by B.E., Tiffany
filled to the brim, sword of the self-swallowed-sword of the self. The
last I heard of it, wheels on terminal four-by-four run across mewling
buffalo, the last was before the scroll shut down this breath:

Buffalo: The verb prevaricates (Tiffany, dancing the tar into me!);
death is the function of the noun.
Buffalo: (Tiffany, remembering that silence, violation-fabric, dark-tar
dark-star real) There are no signs of anything at all.

Lucan, Pharsalia:


As soon as irrationals came into being, it was clear that everything
was exhausted and that nothing could be countered to be the same again.
For excess beneath the greatest scrutiny, bounded excess, excess 
uncontained, would never disappear, and each new discovery served to 
unharness the chariot of man.

Now it was never the numerical itself that was irrational, but the
attempt to contain number; it is not that we can dispense with Euclid
and Archimedes, but that they are to be surpassed, as a gorge itself
proves dangerous to wayfarers who seek a path towards the peak.

For Melissus says, _Being one, it must fail to possess a body. But if 
it had bulk it would have parts and would no longer be one._ (Cf. B 9.)
It is said that the breath has its inheritence.

TRAVIS RIDES A SEGMENT ON THE INTERNET


The segment proceeded through the black collapse of cyberspace trailing
error codes behind it; words, cut off, broken, screamed at eighty per-
cent the speed of light. Dark segment, blossoming into annihilation rose
opened against inconceivable arches. End of message ||||||| open to all
callers, gaped ports waiting arrivals from activated bridges. Language
cauterized went nowhere, network address cached from forgotten domains
kept in imminent files. The words were not inconceivably different, 
protected from all sides in one-dimensional space, bouncing like crazy
through fibre-optic backbone canals. It was inert; if I told you Travis
rode the segment, it would be senseless - mass at that speed? The weight
and acceleration alone, tidal forces travelling back across the supine
body - nothing would survive.

The segment followed opened frozen space, careening packets, couldn't
keep up with the address class, flew out the token-ring a long time ago
like everything followed the betatron. It veered according to the timer.
No repeaters on the long planetary haul, tcp/ip dancing among the 
layers. The segment was part of grit-byte, seething in the running of it 
as to no avail. Slight vibration as the data hurtled on, insignificant 
increase in temperature. Blue gateways shunted it along, Travis thought 
class B address for the running. So the source and destination ports
announced themselves, sequence and acknowledgement numbers, HLEN segment
length running full-on mod32/0, codebits and the window, checksum and
the urgent pointer, options, padding, data segmenting, data speeding
nowhere, blind to light-lag in dense mediums, blue-white radiation 
maybe, color of the screen scrolled when the packet held tight. It was 
connectionless, unmotivated, blind gaping wound opening and closing
cyberspace protocol activation Travis. What, nothing, what. What, noth-
ing, what. Violation-fabric of Travis weight, sound lost shrieked in the 
tubes, shrouded in the tunnels. Urgent segment was frozen space, long 
lost wrung from the message _i suffer suffer the little children._ 
||||||| to everyone ||||||| to everyone clara hello. Backup on ntalk, 
annihilation once again. It chased itself. Travis stopped time, roared 
around the other way, there he was, segment splintered in reliant stream
connections. Gone was the system blue light brilliant on the terminal 
dwarfstar. Later the phosphor photon release mechanisms; Travis knew so
little towards the sputtered end, neural energies cauterized by quantum
packets themselves - or a red shift dulling the senses. The edge of the
fiber sheared hard against the edge of the fiber, luge-Travis feet-for-
ward with source TCP data hard-ridden on the bumper slated for loss.
Last thought was that no one said anything, but no one was thinking it,
what could at that speed. Rounded into something or other, some circuit 
or other. Rounded back. The next thing was the right-hand rule, cascade 
or otherwise, but Travis wasn't listening any more, Travis wasn't.

THE DISASTER OF DOING OR BEING DONE TO


The first time we had sex she peed on me, her body held at a rigid angle,
her clothes on, soaking the space between her legs, her pants, my chest, 
groin, nipples. She pressed herself into the liquid pooling against the 
lower abdomen, pressed hard; I was erect, my cock chafed on wet cloth, 
dripping with fluids. The next time, it was against my hand, and the time 
after, my body flooded with her, until there was nothing left, the feel-
ing gone, decathected. She decathected, turned towards another revolving 
stage, turned inward. That ended, pants dried, cock shriveled at half the 
length, woke up again, weeks later, for penetration. On top of her, my 
body remained at a rigid angle, obtusity above the horizontal; frozen, 
the shots held me for all time until that proved to be the end of it.

She poured herself upon me, menses savaged, hysteric and thick, smeared 
across the abdomen, arms, legs, chest, face, run into the hair, the body
caked with blood spoors, streaks and spears of it, swords and shards of
it. The skin curled against coagulation, dried moments held to the record 
of absent fury. I coursed through her veins and arteries. The photographs 
proved the existence of mouths open, full, sheets outlined with inert 
memories, the stains of half-truths, thought wobbled against the real, 
of or within the real. Decathected, later three of us roamed the silver 
grains, bodies developed in the world of film, thrown up and out, that 
was it. Green film dried in the projector or I used a cleaner with lubri-
cant. It never ran out on the floor; chattering, it could hardly speak.

She drew a cunt between my legs, uselessly inserted myself into myself,
hermaphroditic Odin reaching for the runes, finding the barrier of sub-
terfuge and skin. She told me stories of exposing herself; I encouraged
her, both of us shaven, devouring our bodies, narcissism short-circuited
in the realm of triple interpenetrated rings; the three of us were lost
in the two of us, her gaze holding us taut. Tied, my mouth was flooded.
The video opened my hole, cunt and ass alike. 

She shoved her fingers into me, three then four of them, turning them
around. She told me she wanted to bind me tight, an audience watching,
suck me off until I passed out. She spanked me, direct on the anus. She
turned away from me, there was nothing left of me. There was no thought
left, nothing even ragged. I'd melt into the carpet, into the audience,
melt into the wall or window, into the sea itself. It was the absence of
thought like the absence of body in cyberspace. It was the being-done-to
or collapsing the space, or the doing-to of cybertalk, cyberwhisper, 
making space, space for the talk and the whisper. Space and body breathed
between the two realms, doubled arched, always already a distance between 
the two of them. Ontology gaped wide open like a maw from an animal half-
ghost, half-real, or half-man half-woman. The parts never fit and I knew 
there weren't parts, just clots on the body, on the bed, clothes, on the 
skin itself. This was dissolution bodywork, body-lost, mind-lost. I was 
sucked back into the urethra. I emerged from the mouth, thought-balloon 
and just long enough to beg for a room of one's own.

THE VISION OF THE NET WHICH COMES FROM PRESSING THE EYES


_There's nothing there:_

Frames, packets, segments, datagrams, traversing fiber-optic cables, 
traversing copper wires, shunted through the atmosphere from one to
another satellite, ground-station, repeaters, sub-ocean cables, micro-
wave links everywhere, internal focus of sparked energy, electric 
grid-membranes, solar,coal, oil, tidal, thermal, nuclear, wind, hydro-
power, the speed of light, close to the speed of light, far below the
speed of light. Internals and externals as well, distanced layers of
equivalences up and down the protocols, skeletal structures creaking
with teraterabyte messagings flooding to laser-incandescent heat.

Unfurled, I begin to understand the neural quantity of murmurs, whis-
pers pouring through the net, spider-links elsewhere, dim glow from
outspace of hushed communications, diffraction grated, O I see the 
face of God, Her breath upon the lens, pearls of light, pure luminance
falls from Her eyes everywhere upon the dusk solitons, slow weaving and
roiling, you can almost hear the thinking of it.

Below address helicopters sit, sift information stuttering across the
linings of the world as we have never known it, falling in their flying
the meaning of it all, linked frames, packets, segments, datagrams,
linked messages, replies, halos of links, whole orbits of them, rings 
of them.

The users lie supine, legs and arms pressed tight against their bodies,
rotating at high high speed, you can read the log from the skin bur-
nished with the presence of pasts and futures, no presences here in the
eyes whitened, closed to the orbitals, no eyebrows, lashes, as well,
the _none_ of it all.

The vision veers, tilts, askew, akimbo, ajar, from neural to viral;
luminance harbors torn membranes, dark sunspots ripped into the heart 
of it, coagulated realities of climate radiated behind firewalls behind
everything in the world. Or veers bacterial, invasions of hosts, shat-
tered packets, spews, hoar-frost memories. _There is no shape to cyber-
space,_ no Shape, no MONA LISA OVERDRIVE, what remains _unserrated,_
ungraspable. There's the _feel of the thing, of it all,_ no _thing,_ no
_it_ at all, but that's Travis' image shunted through the wires. There
are loving reconciliations as frame turns frame, datagram turns frame
turns frame turns datagram, up to the packet of the message up to the 
mind-mouth where things lie askew, akimbo, ajar. But there's nothing, 
_there's nothing there. But there's nothing there._

(The skins of the users flay with scars; slits devour slits, bodies 
sutured to one another. Rotations set the speed of the net; the body
burrowed through the screen, swallowed me alive.)

SHAPE-RIDER


Shapelessness frightens us; we assign Form to the world, Landscape from
a point-of-view. Onlooker creates image and world reproduces within the 
elliptical trajectory of oozed language. 

As well, we give Form to Presence, Capitals concluding what had never
begun. Ghosts are drawn out of the oozed uncanny, their absence sublim-
ated by sheets and strange sounds lurking in the souls of things; pol-
tergeists appear through the universal domain of objects and emblems. 
What occurs _within_ circuitry is described as ontologically _bounded_ 
by circuitry - never mind that the sputtering is already a concretion 
of mathematics vectored and recursive. And the _binding_ forms a map; 
there is always a map _at hand,_ at the tip of one's fingers, the phys-
ical tracing and retracing the abstract itself.

The fragment always appears broken, in need of a body. Beings search for
the Matrix. Vision completes contours, constructs the full bandwidth of
color when spectography tells us otherwise. The ear gestures towards the 
singer, toward the bass end of abbreviated bandwidths. Oozing language 
names, renames, occludes itself in the process.

_Shape is our ontology_ as gas contained fulfills the borders, margins, 
of the container. Gas's Other is the no-Man's land, boundary-regions; 
the Other gives Shape to ourselves, which the psychoanalytic Other dis- 
assembles by dissembling. Words stutter, stumble in the throat, the
inchoate flux of oozed language. 

The Capitals hold the oozed World holding Language together.

When the Ghost came, I was asleep. Filigree oozed from her cunt, sur-
rounded the sheets and pillows with darkened reds and blues, almost an
image branded into the Night itself. Her arms were winged, and in her
Breasts I could see all the Forms of the World, flickering, as if upon
a devised Screen that invaded my Heart, beating so loud, so loud. I
oozed forth.

look forward to reading your stuff.  why not a piece on the present 
ontology of the undeliverable messages, and the effort that went into 
the project...presumably radiating away from the earth at whatever rate.
--------------------------

Dear Bob -

-- but the messages are debris, placenta generated from unproductive
miscarriages - but they're viral or rotifera, identical molecular or
cellular structures --
-- but they're inchoate, menses - but they never received an answer -
clones forever of unrequited love, exponential increase of romantic
tissue, legions of faltering hearts, collapsed lungs, legions of tears
marching step-by-step to a 1930s graveyard steel chorus --
-- the chorus of inflationary universes, but they're victims of the lie
of the eternal return - they don't wait for the return, they generate
their own returns, absorb the universal filaments of dark plasmatic
matter --

-- but they're really lost in the wires, disappeared into the chaotic
domain, below the level of quantum noise, a few stuck in hard-drives
rotating until the machine collapses of its own accord --
-- for a second, earth shone brighter than the brightest star, on the
toby borgeest wavelength --

-- for a second, now that he's forgotten, the unhappy reader of this
text scratches her head --
-- WHO IS TB, she asks, what DREAD DISEASE spews forth, replicates 
itself in the habitus of cybermind? DISEASE gives SHAPE to cybermind,
TB replies; I'm SHAPE-RIDER, fuck with the clouds, make faces in them,
cut writing into dirt, hands into the walls of LASCAUX. --
-- she blows him apart, she does - doesn't even know what he's talking
about. she came late to the list, after the trauma of Saturday last,
didn't see the message-spew, what's called a meltdown on the Net, all
500 messages, 8 megabytes of it --

-- they unsubbed in droves, stormed the server, ran hysterically one 
direction or another. o I tried to help them, couldn't get through,
their accounts overflowed with TB, TB with NET stalkings, closed every-
one out --
-- but they came back, yes they did, bringing the new ones, the young
ones, the unafraid ones, naive ones - and TB's waiting in the wings for
the next BIG STRIKE, take out a whole backbone he thinks to himself,
stuff their mouths --

-- but no really, nothing's happening, they're gone, just like speech
goes, just like the SERMON IN THE MOUNT. filled with dirt, gone bone,
chilled, gone flesh, gone nothing, dust, not that --
-- not nothing, gone, dead away --

KNOWING


It is a New England room, the walls painted with off-color white enamel,
over-grown moldings and wood-framed windows with layer upon layer of
colors, varnished thin-boarded floor. There is a brick fireplace, and
always that sense of dust around in the vicinity of bricks, and dark
soot with poorly-defined shapes grown out and upwards through the 
chimney. And here there is a single bed - well, not actually single, but
what might be called queen-sized, with a white bedspread, turned now into
patterns of roses, fallen on all sides down, fringes almost to the floor, 
pillows stuffed into one end, fluffed-up, as she had said so many years
ago. And there, here is a brass light hanging from the ceiling, central,
surrounded by a raised plaster ellipse, worn down as well with paint.
I sit upon the bed, the laptop in my hands. The room always has that
chill that comes with New England winters, as if the air refused to 
carry the limited warmth pouring out from the electric heater, filaments
glowing, in the corner. A wire leads from the laptop to the telephone
outlet, but when I look, this winter night, the wire disappears, and I
am left alone, writing into the surface of the screen, etching darkness
out of grey-silver illumination. It is almost time for the frost to 
begin, spreading from the edges of the window-panes, net-like, across 
the rest of the surface, thinning out where I might imagine the terminals
to be. There is juice in the batteries; I am half beneath the covers, 
half chilled, leaning into the keyboard. Nothing comes back to me for all
I have given to the world. There is the sound of the wind out-of-doors 
and occasional creaks of ice cracking, breaking from the strain of it
all. I know that the moon will reflect shadowed blue along the stress
leaned out of the hills, punctured by black branches. I know that the
stars burn ice-cold, ferocious, in a wilderness I can never ascertain,
and I am taken in by the vulnerability of it, this world splayed open
to the sky. Each word, each line, is a singlet upon the screen. Warmth
seeps from the covers; I ignore the chill as long as possible, postponing
the fetal position that alone brings me to sleep. There are no clocks,
for I have put time aside. There are books, as well, hovering near the
distant heater, words chattering on the margins of the room, murmurs of
imaginary mouths, translucent with the saying of them. I know there are
no raptures in this world. I will scarcely read what I have written, 
glancing across the text only to remove the occasonal error. The light
flickers slightly, a wind has picked up, and I can hear a dog, cold with
the night and the day, cold with the week and the month, barking, in the
distance. I sense the frozen streamer of a cloud, cirrus, passing far
overhead. I wonder about the mice below; they'll appear later, for what-
ever heat I have left to share. They have always known the sky.

The `Whining' Aspect of the Writing of the Texts


You constantly write of the need for intimacy; does this color your
reading of/writing on/within cyberspace?

Alone, I am opened to the raw world of the wires, more so than you with
your families, your real-life loves and hates, your disagreements and
intimacies. Who better is left to write in this space, this open archi-
tecture interface? My skin is opened, cut away; raw, I am pressed into
the matrix of the solid state. Only disembodiment irrupts within the
psyche, the worrying of it.

(Scrape the skin away from the breast, a second nipple of undergrowth
tissue. Use the application bandage, mutiple-connectivity at the touch
of surface against surface. The two heal together. Allow the upper sur-
face of the application for jack-in, jack-out. Lie back, eyes closed,
half dreamed up to the world, unclothed body splayed to cyberspace. 
Write, as I write now, in red letters on a black screen, letters of
blood, warning, and desire. Read the writing with the eyes closed back.)

An event is foretold by the hardness of it; as the cyber-anorectic body 
wastes away, everything comes true in the hearing. There is nothing but 
the hearing, small turbulence of scattered winds. The cyber-anorectic 
body _becomes_ the event - no inside, no outside for _this_ body which
forgets, forecloses upon every other. The event inflates in cyberspace,
murmur or whisper, and _this, this is my country,_ the event tells each 
and every one of us, _this is my country._

(Lying back, clothed or unclothed, I become pure liquid, liquidity,
drugged in the state of perfection. _Now, I will believe. Now, there is
nothing to believe in._ How to consider this when the landscape, all
around, is there - _for the dreaming that comes otherwise?_)

Alone, I inhabit this world which I stumble through. (And that is why,
in spite of everything, desire and intimacy come forward as themes in
these texts; they are themes of cyberspace, and anything more real than
real in the physical world would sublimate them, cauterize them, with
the smell of burning flesh.)

(And why this emphasis on flesh, skin, the body itself? Because, lone, 
there is nothing else to give, nothing to receive.)

Whimper

A bad account. I've got to implement the commands from the staff. I've 
a post with hidden control characters like that because they destroy 
address lists to make sure that everyone subbed is formatted properly. 
Addresses with mailer daemon headings. I've got to reorganize the fill,
alive. I write myself into the darkness thinking of things like these,
and a desire for sexual fulfillment coupled with romance. I can see the
beauty of this, of which I am capable of understanding as long as I am
close to me, to whom I could devote my life. I cannot imagine the cold,
cold room which offers me no kindness. Tears fill my eyes when I think
commands onto everyone else. I've got to immediately unsubscribe 
files. I've got to check my lists to make sure the meltdown address has
got to get the account shut down. I've got to call myself on the phone,
had a girlfriend for over two years and this fills me with great grief.
Have to send requests of all sorts to majordomo, if it's majordomo, and 
I live alone and cry a great deal as a result of an empty bed and
I've got to get more work out of me. I can't do this alone. I can't.
I've got to keep the who lists up to date on my home machine. I did 
quickly before I'm hacked. I've let my account overflow and there's
lists in a wide variety of sites. I've got to track down those messes,
losing money sometime soon. Soon, I've got to stop losing time, there's
meltdown happening. I can't correct my problem because I can't reach 
my in-box. I can get the information sheet and learn how to unsub cost
of living without the intimacy which only I can provide. I have never
phoned. I've got to inform the lists of the changes I've made. I've got
place. I've allowed bad addresses to shut down the list. I've got to 
remember my password. I've been sending mail to the wrong address, once
removed. I've got to check my lists to make sure that they're not 
sages which simply aren't getting through. I have to learn to interpret 
scribe myself. I don't subscribe by sending anything at all to me. I 
sleep, thrown off dreadfully, tossing and turning, night after night. I
subscribe with the same address as my return address. I've got to seem
subscribed to myself. I've got to make sure the problem is internal la-
ter. I've got to write a password script. I've got to advertise that 
the account is paid up to date. I can't continue to pass the volume of 
the account going down every single time I turn my head. I sent out
the password to a public list. I've got to change the password since
those error codes that keep clogging up the email. I have to check the 
time soon. I've got to get some sleep sometime soon. I've got to stop 
to contact the sysadmin of my list. I've got to contact the sysadmin  
to listserv if it's listserv. My messages are bouncing all over, want 
to mail the results to myself. I've got to update the info sheets, some
to the server and not external to the network. I have to make sure then 
to watch out for libel. I've got to watch out for slander. I've got to 
understand myself any longer, living from day to day, my patterns of
unsubscribe with the same address as my return address. I can't send or
watch out for slurs. I've got to watch out for cross-posting. I've got, 
would give anything for the presence of a body, the smell of a woman, me.
