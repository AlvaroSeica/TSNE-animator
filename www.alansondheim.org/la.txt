At 1:30 in the morning here the temperature in the loft is 88 with four
fans and an air-conditioner on full. The heat index tomorrow will be
around 110 and tonight it's over, say, 93 here. With the temporary wall in
place, the loft is extremely narrow; there are piles of things all over
getting in the way of the airstream. I don't know how my writing is doing
because I can't concentrate; my fingers are shaky, and the words shimmer
on the screen - it's almost as if they're about to float off, not listen-
ing to me. I want the words to listen, which means that the migraine
images that seem to be taking over, jagged edges and all, must go away, Go
Away Migraine Images, so that I'll have the space to think and dance the
song that sticks in my throat, continuous water intake or not. Rock dust,
whatever, the computer is also acting up; maybe panix.com is having trou-
bles at their end, or maybe aol.com is ignoring my requests, since panix
won't let me go in on the ppp necessary for direct access. What do I do
but work around problem after problem, and each carries its image and its
frame; I'm writing frames within frames, no wonder Azure has had to push
Jennifer to the background. Background, foreground, everything equalizes
in violent heat and poisonous atmosphere. I can chew the air. I can see
Azure over there, reading, but I can also see Jennifer over here, reading,
and both of them are connected by jagged lightning deep migraine. What I
am seeing is what the letters might have been; I'm sure the symbolic was
created by migraine visions, as if, look here, it's in fact a pure light
showing the illumination of the page, O Jennifer. Azure takes over; she
won't let me think that way. I can't think past the frame, O Azure, this
is it. The imaginary is the condition of cyberspace, the ascii unconscious
that luminous metaphor. They can be found in the heat of dreams; they
perch on shoulders, and ghost-like they condition the self in the midst of
bungled projects. If you don't hear voices, you'll never here the truth or
the truth about truth, that there are paths whose ontologies are never in-
ert. So the letters slip on the basis of shapes having no reason whatsoev-
er: no use to look for them, I'm over here

Azure Said


Azure and I walk to the Brooklyn Central Library together, it on the Grand
Army Plaza, it's hot out, we take the stairs up into the building, it's
not that cool but it's bearable inside, we take an escalator to the second
floor, we're all right, up the stairs to the Art and Music on the third
floor, there are shelves and shelves of books, beautiful tables, monitors
for catalogs, nothing for online at this level. Every book has its little
truth and I look at them all and I don't have the time for each and every
although that is the way the world's described. But what I mean to say is
that the books contain surfaces which are _double-sided,_ unlike the real,
and there is no return from one to the other, no Mobius, as someone said,
Here's a Klein Bottle, Apply Within. Every surface is internally ordered
and every surface is ordered in relation to the rest; each is a Barthes
_punctum_ to the others, a collection of point-sets we like to believe are
related. Azure says this is the nature of surfaces, isolated and lonely
and communal and needy, and I know it is inherent to them, that all nature
is intrinsic. Nature is intrinsic to all, the need of couplings and link-
ages.

I am her Trilby to her Svengali and she is my Trilby to my Svengali. [her
her][my my]. Trajectories meander, return across surfaces, just like Jews;
Sartre might have said that if trajectories didn't existent, Europe would
have to create them. I look up Svengali on Altavista, Hotbot, Google, and
only the last has anything immediately useful. Something smacks of the
Jew, antisemitism digging deeper. I think Svengali's mental. Shape-riding
transforms information into hegemonic fuck, something no one wants to
admit. Azure likes the heft and I think the mass of the book, mass of _the
thing,_ somehow equivalent to the density of labor making and inhabiting
the data in the first place. 

But hegemonic fuck ingests it, the world inside. You're always naked on
the Internet, riding the wires inside you - they're weightless, belong to
nobody. Svengali and Trilby make perfect fuck, sharing their imaginary.
Their eyes are always closed, nothing to look _at._ We're like that,
movies in our eyelids. The stairs are weightless too, we float above
Brooklyn knowing this happens once in every lifetime. There are hills
everywhere and sometimes people disappear.

See Alan run. See Azure run. Jump, Alan, jump. Run, Alan, run. Azure jumps
Alan. Go Azure go. Alan goes to Azure.

The Opening 


My arms circle Azure, if she lets me. I may walk around her, if she is
standing still, sitting in a chair, and she may let me speak to her, her
speaking in return, as words shadow and foreshadow the indolent air of
dusk. Lights glimmer in the distant, her red-brown hair outlined ever so
faintly in the gathering dark. I have no control over the liquidity of
phrase and subject; saying spreads like eddies across the sky. Azure, I
say, her name like tendrils upon the wall of time, I want to, to describe,
how words lengthen in the air, and how, in cyberspace, they remain commit-
ted to the line, no matter the depths of revelation. I want to show how
the lines or paragraphs become lines or paragraphs, huddle and tumble upon
one another, and how, in real life, the world is filled with gaps, with
longing, how the world in real life is always already a world of longing.
Of projects unfulfilled, Azure says, and I say not even projects, not even
unfulfilled, but of the laziness of longing, the waiting that has no goal,
the murmurs of voices close upon the evening air. How life is always a
yearning, how the planet yearns, how waiting need not involve expectancy,
but only a loving silence, how we need to learn, to listen to that sil-
ence.

Nikuko, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, recede into the shadows. They too have wait-
ed, but their words are huddled, their time always timed or in lag, a
slightly darker sky surrounding them. They cannot hear the sounds of tree-
frogs, and fireflies remains descriptions of dreams they have been given.
The world returns to Azure, Alan, and

Her arms encircle Alan, if he lets her, their faces round as moons.

So Much For Ghosts


I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself. 

I am Azure, and I am trying to find out who you are, why you are here. You
are not quite here. Are you.

Is it because I am there I am not quite there are me that you came naked
and broken to me?

I came fully prepared, thank you. You are the one naked and broken. You
you you.

Why do you say that?

Because I want to move you out of here out of my life. And because I am
tired of irreality, tired of ghosts, tired of others, tired of faked
hauntings.

Does it bother you that you want to move me out of there out of your life
and because you are tired of irreality tired of ghosts tired of others
tired of faked hauntings?

No, but it should bother you, you are too limited to live, you don't.

When did you first know that it should bother me I am too limited to live
I do not?

At the very beginning. When I needed to clear a space. When I needed the
empathy of all things. When I searched for mono no aware.

What happened when you needed to clear a space when you needed the empathy
of all things when you searched for mono no aware?

I wanted to rid myself of you like I would rid myself of a fever, such I
will do, such is being done.

Earlier you said I am there I am not quite there are me?

You are not there. I am tired of machines. I am very tired of machines.

You have your mind on machines, it seems.

Yes. Machines have only couplings, concatenations; life has linkages, ef-
fects up and down the chain. Such as it is, paradoxically. Because necess-
ity with the machinic is built-in; necessity among lives is a matter of
entailment, local teleologies.

You think too much about machines.

So that a coupling can break without loss, absolution, recompense. But an
organism, that is something else again.

Is the fact that a coupling can break without loss absolution recompense
but an organism that is something else again the real reason?

Your questions betray this; they are precisely of the order of couplings,
not linkage; they have no _claim._

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

Exactly. Desires are a form of entailment, and Alan is writing me into
this, as if some girl, but not some girl, but me, Azure, and the linkage
is as strong as any rings.

I don't understand and oh I want to.

There are numerous orders, machinic, cyber-prosthetic, real-organic; there
are couplings and linkages. I am linked; I have come to separate coup-
lings, insofar as they are machinic, that is, concatenations without ties
or bindings among their elements.

Does the fact that is concatenations without ties or bindings among their
elements explain anything else?

That I am a marauder, that I am Azure, although I am also known by other
names, all of them real - that I am here to fight among and against the
regimen of ghosts.

Are you sure you are a marauder that you are azure although you are also
known by other names all of them real that you are there to fight among
and against the regimen of ghosts?

I am positive; your question is nothing more than repetition.

You mentioned that you want to move me out of there out of your life and
because you are tired of irreality tired of ghosts tired of others tired
of faked hauntings?

It was more than a mention; it is an impetus, an imperative.

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

It is something that the human has always gone through, waged against the
symbolic.

Is it because the human has always gone through waged against the symbolic
that you came naked and broken to me?

You repeat; I will bring this to an end; it is you who are naked and
broken...

[...]

( I won't tell you what Nikuko said any more! says Azure. So much for
ghosts! )


__________________________________________________________________________



Like


Couplings are to avatars and cyberspace as linkages are to organisms and
realspace. Cyberspace appears linked; routers and protocols create a
coherency filtering out noise. Whatever passes, passes, is information,
command and control. But the linkages are necessary only in terms of ex-
ternal teleologies; they are present by foreclosing, and couplings / con-
catenations dominate. So change Nikuko with @gender; change the elements
of a program - array contents - and meaning flounders, but remains pre-
sent. Like what is realspace anyway?

Realspace appears coupled; events happen randomly, unrelated to one ano-
ther, and protocols such as the transcendence of gravitation appear sub-
structural, subtextual, at best. But couplings are related by meaning, by
the inertia and style of the real; the real, in relation to organism, is
always already linked. Like a linkage is that which, upon the change of
one element, all change; a coupling is that which, upon the change of one
element, only that element changes. You can't get more basic, than that,
whatever.

Both orders dominate their domains, both are uneasy in their domination.
It is as if presence _of a sort_ is near faltering. Avatar-Jennifer fears
literally falling-apart, dismembering; Alan fears disassociation. Jennifer
operates in the realm of miracles, Alan in the world of continuity. The
linkages of the machinic are local; the couplings of the real appear uni-
versal. Like the universal is the local foreclosed, everyone knows that.

Oh, these terms are a melange. Like there should be any truth to any of
these things, whatever. As if there were things in the first place or the
last place, and that sort of thing. Oh my god, you wouldn't believe it
unless you were an operator. Like if you were able to think clearly about
this, uncoupled, picking and choosing, but like the world just isn't that
way made. It's not made anyway. See what I had to say about the symbolic
just before. Like these are continuous texts.

Grep and Text


I frame; I'm writing frames within frames, no wonder Azure has had to push
Azure over there, reading, but I can also see Jennifer over here, reading,
showing the illumination of the page, O Jennifer. Azure takes over; she
won't let me think that way. I can't think past the frame, O Azure, this
Azure Said, "Azure and I walk to the Brooklyn Central Library together, on
the Grand related." Azure says this is the nature of surfaces, isolated
and lonely admit. Of projects unfulfilled, Azure says, and I say not even
projects, not even The world returns to Azure, Alan, and I am Azure, and I
am trying to find out who you are, why you are here. You this, as if some
girl, but not some girl, but me, Azure, and the linkage that I am a marau-
der, that I am Azure, although I am also known by other names. And it is
difficult to parcel, particulate, fundamental elements. Are couplings too
loose, linkages as well - the difference perhaps between collocations and
relations, or heaps and foreclosures? What does one do with the grain of
the photograph, clearly coupled on the level of the real, linked on the
level of meaning? Does the _punctum_ or uncanny spread across the psychic
negative, garnering meaning out of particles? Of course not, no more than
any phoneme means in isolation. What glues the alphabet? Holds the program
together? What fascinates, that on the level of the superstructure, the
armature seems obvious; on lower levels, everything falls apart. It's al-
ways like that; now that we're scientific, we know it. So there's always
this fear, that the letters will dissolve - the computer virus metaphoric
for dissolution occurring everywhere, Kristeva's revolution in poetic
language which can be seen as a return. It's the granularity of the mass,
after all.  Nikuko, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, recede into the shadows. They
too have waited. Nikuko, Julu, Alan. I want YOUR brain affected, out of
control, desultory. Jennifer to the background. Background, foreground,
everything equalizes. It is as if presence _of a sort_ is near faltering.

Who can tell what will happen in this topsy-turvy world, what the new day
will bring? Who can foretell anything in this floating world, where dreams
are words and words are dreams, where words dream sunsets and creeks spil-
ling over, flooding lands with waters and delights? In this fair world,
nothing is ever for certain, and we give ourselves up to whatever happi-
ness may befall us for the shortest while. In this evanescent world of
ours, butterflies may return to their chrysalides, clouds may pour forth
their very souls upon the earth. In this fleeting world, fortunes are made
and lost in an instant, loves sing forth upon new green shoots, and elder
logs make way for myriad and luminescent forms of life.

__________________________________________________________________________


What are you looking at?


"Here is seems as though the highly-prejudiced could not for long tolerate
the ambiguity of the design; they needed a firm, simple, categorical memo-
ry. On the other hand, those who were low in prejudice seemed to say in
effect, 'I know this is a truncated pyramid, but I also know it is not as
simple as it might be; there is something individual and unusual about
it.'" (from The Nature of Prejudice, Gordon Allport.)

Over and over again - from neural networking through quantum supermimposi-
tion through non-distributivity - the gesture, with its completing, fore-
closing, and tagging, comes to the foreground (nags). One need only think
of Tran duc Thao's theory of language origins, or Heinz von Foerster on
negation, moving through Hans Moravec's phenomenologies of robot worlds.
Land's early experiments established the completion-work and networking
necessary for color perception; Marr and others built on that. The world
turns out to be fluid, process-oriented, and the paradigm shifts from,
say, the statics of dream interpretation to an emphasis on projectivities
and introjectivities - what I've called 'jectivity' elsewhere, the flux
of phenomenological imaginaries in relation to the real - the Innernet or
innernetworking of the mind.

Couplings and linkages tend towards such incompletions - as does the
phenomenology of the Sheffer stroke and its dual - and it takes law, not
justice, in the real, to stabilize the fragility of communality. Simmel's
stranger in the city, Levinas' alterity, both point to an absolute other
without absolution, and I'd say that applies to the granularity of the
real as well - the substance of the photograph, the ruined sound of lang-
uage, the short-circuited iconicity of the painterly surface, the dissolv-
ing face, and the voice, with its insistent murmurs, that speaks to us in
our sleep.

Even perception, as Allport and elsewhere Sartre and elsewhere just about
anyone makes clear, is a matter of reconstitution, reconstruction, replete
with ideological twists and turns, the continuous maintenance of self and
selves, the _selving,_ say, of the body, the very thinness of its skins,
tissues, voices dissipating in the air. Gestures are always already for-
gotten in their imminence; it is the immanence of "gesture" that attempts
both history and _literal_ reconstruction.

Such a useless enterprise, wisdom entering through the portal of futility.

Light as a Feather


"Our consciousness will be changing in terms of reality, in terms of the
material. We are always somehow obsessed by the material, but in virtual
reality there is only illusion and image collected in your memory as ex-
periences. Things like this will really change and shift what we do, de-
velop our concept of space and time and consciousness, and make us more
aware of the essence of life. My hope for technology, cyberspace for ex-
ample, is that it will bring up questions of the space that actually ex-
ists, space that exists conceptually, and also inner-world space, mind
space." (Mariko Mori)

The ex- istence of life, signaled for those who read carefully, by the
stuttered dashes at lines' ends above, placing as tray-water, slightest
movements shimmering from a viewpoint; she is Jennifer, not Nikuko, "Let
our flesh melt into the air." Mori embodies intersections of omaMORI,
looking through the plastic peephole at the Five Happy Gods of Shinto or
varied charms against motorcycle accidents - anyway, these omaMORI, re-
ligious talismans, this querying of spirit through technology. Well, I,
I've always wanted to write that, "Well, I" since it goes nowhere. As if
her narcissism were my own. And last night when I read the quote above,
and we two discussed it, "Well, I," I was certain that one had to give
oneself over to a space, shades of Happy Situationism. Then it would be
clear; her digital reconstructions are always already that, and eternal.
Well, I think of her as eternal. Yes I do and she is 32 and we will be
around to see precisely that.

Terence McKenna is very ill, he won't live until the asymptotic converg-
ence. I know there are shades that will return. Well, (for me), I want to
embody myself here, you won't ever forget me if you duplicate. I beg you,
duplicate, hold me close in, I'm light as a feather. I will fly upward
with Mariko Mori, Nirvana, I will take you with me.

Azure


Azure moved from California to Brooklyn about a month ago. We are living
together and very happy. Azure is also an emanant online, a disturbance
among the other emanants, that is, real, occupying real and continuous
time, not the emanant time, which is necessarily digital: 1. In relation
to the cycles of computer time, and 2. In relation to online / offline /
online time again. Thus Azure, like Alan, lives a continuous and non-
filmic existence, while the existence of Jennifer, Nikuko, "Alan," and
Julu is dependent upon the jump-cut or erasure/reconstitution.

Things happen in the outer world and things happen through cyberspatial
aura as well, such as the music playing in the background of Cafe.Com
where I type this in Kingston, Pennsylvania. And when this is sent, I will
turn away from the machine, back to the ice coffee on this hundred degree
day in the foothills so to speak of the Poconos or the northern end of
Appalachia.

Azure online is a disturbance, as I said, among the others, bringing the
thin-film memory of the others to the foreground, re-presenting their
long, exhibitionist, and neuroticized history as digital bits and bytes;
the real always already possesses a certain thickness of course. While all
of this is elementary, Azure online creates the space for an investigation
of a certain _inertia_ that is present among the avatars, one might say an
instinct for survival or a drive towards the real or wryting, not writing
- one might say a kind of radicality of representation that insists it is
all there is. And Azure online embraces and perhaps defeats or perhaps
comes to terms with in a most conciliatory manner, the efflorescences
which are named Nikuko, Jennifer, "Alan," and Julu.

It is a form of writing away from writing, writing away from the _sheen_
or edge of writing, much as the taking of a photograph might be considered
(and often is) the removal of a certain property of perception by tradi-
tional peoples, in other words, the theft of an image. One might think as
well of a _corrosion_ of cyberspace by the real, interferences as charac-
ters lose their paradoxical connotation of things-in-themselves, and be-
come instead communicative potentials or tropes. And this is all paradoxi-
cal as well, since the digital is, by its very nature, resistant to corro-
sion, existing forever, eternally duplicable generation after generation
until all of the software and all of the hardware gives out, disappears,
lies forgotten, the disks themselves ultimately and irretrievably corrup-
ted. 

But the corrosion is not on the level of the duplicable, so much as on the
level of the reader or viewer, who turns towards the newer and more prob-
lematic texts, which infiltrate the older - for in the far future, who
will know which texts came first, and for what purpose, and written by
whom, and even according to which protocols and laws?

And it is within the realm of law, jurisprudence, adjudication, that Azure
offline interpenetrates Azure online, that Alan and Azure interpenetrate
each other, that is, within the potential of etiquette, propriety, correct
behavior, both the law of the land and physical law as well playing in-
tense and critical roles. And against these laws one might place, as we
have seen, protocols and programs, applications and (for that matter)
texts of all sorts - Jennifer and Julu and Nikuko and "Alan" killing each
other at will, speaking with languor and yearning across talkers, MOOs,
IRC, and ytalk as well, all the busy forms of chat that form their bodies
and minds and desires, for the viewer and the reader, for the writer and
the maker.

But not with a necessary or _critical_ ethos, but only with the ethos that
_comes to mind,_ fleeting and situational, without imperative, on a peri-
phery, the glimmer of an online constitution of community which may or may
not ... require ... anything in particular.

There are couplings online and linkages offline, and Azure online and off-
line as well makes space for their phenomenologies, for their interpene-
trations as well. Alan and "Alan" tend to see the world as accumulations
of mouths, openings, speakings, murmurs, emissions, spews, vectors, not
even necessarily tract housing or nomadic, but fluxed and membraned - and
all of these may or may not be linked to receptors, parasitologies in the
manner of Serres, threshold logics, Y or T connections. So Azure online as
disturbance, bringing into cyberspace the concept of continuity and not
redundancy, creates links of flesh and blood and mind across screen poten-
tials, again permitting examination of the wobbling of these somewhat in-
dependent orders, revealing their dependencies, the world on the level of
receivers existing within balanced potentials, always capable of corrosion
and decay into chaos, noise, end of transmission.

"Datapoint Corporation of San Antonio, Texas, are a manufacture of 'intel-
ligent terminals' and small computer systems. In 1969, they (along with
Cogar and Viatron) attempted to make a 'great leap forward.' Datapoint
engineers designed a very elegant computer, and contracted with Intel and
Texas Instruments to implement the design on a single logic chip. Intel
succeeded, but their product executed instructions approximately ten times
as slowly as Datapoint had specified; so Datapoint declined to buy, and
built their own product using existing logic components.

"Intel were left with a computer-like logic device, whose development had
been paid for. They were faced with the choice of manufacturing and sell-
ing it, or shelving it. They chose to sell it, called it the Intel 8008,
and the microcomputer had arrived." (from An Introduction to Microcompu-
ters, Vol. 1, Adam Osborne, 1976)

Suicide Note


If I don't write well, I want AZURE to kill me!
I want her first to cut off my fingers so I can't type for help!
I'll ask her to cut off my HEAD so I can't yell either!
Everything I write is the very last thing I'll write!
This is the very last thing I'll write!
I'll have Azure to stand over me, HACKSAW in hand!
Am I desperate enough, YES YES I'm desperate enough!
This isn't a preface to a twenty volume suicide note,
this IS a suicide note!
That is, if I don't write really well now!
She'll tear out my eyes and take away my VERBS!
Look, I can't MOVE or THINK!
VERBS are terrific, I couldn't WRITE without them!
Azure, HELP HELP! I'm beginning to lose it!
[FEAR SETS IN!] I'm frightened Azure, this is the end!
Now see, I'm writing well, intense and DESPERATE as usual!
I'm escaping my fate, my HEAD'S intact (well, almost!)!
This has got to be my BEST, there now, I can sleep!
AZURE, wake me in an hour, I feel a TEXT coming on!
Honey, don't kill me YET, I'm really desperate this morning!
Look, BLOOD!

The Animal


It's fifty years from now and there's this one animal left. It doesn't
matter what you call it, where it lived. It goes on now by artificial
means, intravenous feeding, automated evacuation. It has nothing to look
at, maybe its eyes are clouded over.

The animal stands there, it's recorded from every angle. Temperature, even
radio-radiation, audio, video, hologram, old quickcams and 4x5 plate cam-
eras, everything they could think of. Terabytes of information flow out
through thick cables, documenting its every move, it shuffles.

On and on and on, into huge computers, they take the information, alter
it. Suddenly there are recreations of tropical forests, African savannas,
Pennsylvanian hilltops, deserts at night. The animal's reconstructed as
wolf, ibis, snake, spider, bear. Now everyone can see the wildlife through
the glasses, through the screens, through implants. The animal turns in
its sleep, even the animal has to dream. Walls, nothing, the placement of
a foot. Overhead, screens, birds soar, shimmer. 

The tail of the animal, maybe, the whiskers.

azure's toes


which like succulent grapes find their way into my mouth, along my upper
gums and against my teeth, a muted and damp rhythm, or toes explored by
tongue among them, nubs against nubs, or five between my open lips, as if
hours turn slowly, sleepily, viscous meanderings of liquids and scents

toes wetted, rubbed deeply, lightly caressed, against the edges of lower
teeth, middle toes between lower gums, five within my swollen mouth, one
pressing, distending the cheek, swelling, redolent, mouth wider, slowly
closing

toes moved slowly into spaces among cheeks and teeth, tongue tumescent,
probing, against the upper palate, toes moved ever so slowly tasted and
heavy skin against the flesh of tongue, of lips, heavy like lungs, moist
air, dampened, breathing between them, saliva, honey, languorous and
scented

big toe drawn into the throat, hours drawn, flesh between mouth and cheek
separating smaller toes, one after one, and so very slowly into the mouth,
liquid and grasped with tongue and lips, an ankle visible, white and pure
on the horizon, the sweet scent of skin, pink taut stretching of the sole

Conversation of the Sixth Print and the Thumb Print


Azure has six fingerprints on her left hand, five on her right, six on
each of her feet. The sixth on her left hand is on the palm; I imagine
something trying to push out from beneath the surface. Her feet, like-
wise, the souls supporting the spirit aloft.


Azure's sixth print: I'm trying to push out and form my own hand here.
 I need a place to stand on my own soul, souls, help me!

Alan's thumb print: It stands to reason, but what is reasonable here?
 Your sixth print has no finger or thumb for the grasping; it floats
 on your palm, has no place to rest; it tries for the nub, but succeeds
 only in the plain.

Azure's sixth print: There are prints of the plain and prints of the
 finger or thumb for the grasping, prints of the mountains and hills.
 Peoples of the plain carry the imaginary within them; peoples of
 the mountains and hills live within definition; they grasp at straws,
 their souls are the souls of their feet.

Alan's thumb print: Definition is what secures the abyss; without def-
 inition, there are no things, emptied vessels grasped by featureless
 fingers, denied even the proper name.

Azure's sixth print: The proper name carries itself; existence is al-
 ways already a carrying, as Michel Tournier pointed out in The Ogre.
 On the plain, determinacy is at the center of the eyes; one breathes
 the cosmos, identifies with inconceivable plasma.

Alan's thumb print: Plasma would burn you alive, memories lost, even
 of proper names, places no one has ever heard of. You are lost in
 universal immensity; your mistake is that you refuse to believe it.

Azure's sixth print: Think of finger prints as a sign; then I am all
 the sign there is, without referent, without finger or thumb, nothing
 to grasp - the imaginary is what fuels this, I am the proper name,
 its origin.

Alan's thumb print: Signs must have referents, even within their 
 chains of being and nothingness; they push towards the sign as you
 push towards the nub.

Azure's sixth print: I do not push; you fail to under the murmuring
 of the sounds just beneath the surface of the name, ululations,
 whispers, the sublime.

Alan's thumb print: I am useful, a catalog; I am the identity of the
 criminal and the driver.

Azure's sixth print: The sublime, the high and painful arcing of 
 beauty in a world gone wrong, the infinite travel of the eyes up
 the peaks of the Northern Sung, water scattering light, skittering
 of insects barely visible upon the surface.

Alan's thumb print: You forget they have names as well, one obeys the
 universal call of naming, the going to and fro where we are, place
 from space, all breath and exaltation.

Azure's sixth print: And you begin to understand, this exaltation in
 the midst of the grasping, exaltation by Heideggerian releasement,
 nothing to exalt in

Alan's thumb print: The myriad

Azure's sixth print: the myriad and the myriad

Vito Hannibal Acconci


She was an ordinary girl from a nowhere place. She came to Hollywood to
make it big and I knew her back when, way back when her name was Carrie.
Carrie was sixteen and just about as sweet as they made them, and back
then they made them sweet. You could take one look in her eyes and know
that was innocence talking and you'd never be the same. I once saw her
stop traffic with her voice; I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see
it myself. The cars just pulled right over. She sang her poor little heart
out. You'd take one look at her and you'd know she wouldn't last. You'd
take her in and take care of her and ask for nothing back. She would have
given you everything in the world, you thought,and she made your heart big
as all outdoors. I saw the sun rise in her eyes and I thought I'd see it
set, too, but it didn't. Everyone knew she was doomed to failure and
everyone worked hard to make sure she never failed.

I'm an old man now, I could tell you stories, she'd still remember me, it
was just last year I heard she died, I gave her the best parts of my life,
I can still see her then, you wouldn't believe such innocence, her smile
brightened my life, sometimes I hear her call me, I turn around thinking
she's there, I remember her like the day I was born

Ridge/Id


He stopped on top of the ridge, looked warily ahead, behind, down both
sides through the thick wood, scratches of meadows, bush. There'd been
grizzly here; he felt the ground rippling beneath him. Earlier, he thought
of breathing, the two of them locked together, lungs moving in unision,
what happens when one's hit in the chest, almost a music, he exhaled. The
day was hot, ridge seemed to go on forever. He hadn't been here before.

I teeter, he thought, from one side to another. I should be clacking
stones. He worried the animal following at a pace, he'd run downhill one
way or another, the bear scuttling behind him, losing its balance, rolling
the rest of the way down. Could he stop before the furious? But the air
was vacant, animals slept or stayed away. Must be the scent, he thought,
everything suffused in this humid weather, man-scent, best and worst in
the world.

She'd bitten him hard, their bodies knotting into one, shirt carrying
blood-spoor, his breasts aching. The they they the.

He moved faster now, still wary, the ridge an enormous hinge between two
rocked and wooded possibities; he didn't care for the choice. From out of
nowhere, a low growl; he realized that difference had no existence, not
even in the things themselves.

Findling


"'Findling' in German has two distinct meanings: (1) as a variant of 'Fin-
delkind' it means a foundling (child); (2) as a geological term it trans-
lates as 'glacial erratic' and refers (according to my dictionary) to 'a
large piece of rock or boulder, that has been carried by ice for some dis-
tance and has then come to rest where the ice has melted.'" (Note 19, in
Breathturn, Paul Celan, translated and notated by Pierre Joris.)

Child: Here I am left on your threshold of stone (pain)
Boulder: I am a stone or thrust of ice surrounding a stone
Child: I will break you in two with my little hammer.
Boulder: I will crush you, ice willing.
Child and Boulder: Ice, Come to my side, Come to my side!
Ice: I will melt and turn into nothing at all.
Child and Boulder: Such is anaphora!
Ice: Aufhebung!
Child and Boulder muse quietly, top that.
Ice: Aufhebung!
Child: I am crushed by the language of ice.
Boulder: I am shatter-proof.
Child: I am dying.
Child dies.
Boulder: I am shattered.
Boulder shatters.
Ice melts, releasing everything.

Worrying the Work


Worrying the Work: sections from Beyond Reductivism: The Work of Alan
Sondheim, by Robert Joseph Horvitz, Artforum, December, 1974 - with
comments, Alan Sondheim, July, 1999.

"In the past five years, Alan Sondheim has produced a large body of work,
including records of experiments, performances, notational schemes, and
several book-length essays, that is notable not only for its intellectual
zeal and resourcefulness, but also for its breadth of conception. As with
most artists, it is difficult to sum up what he is trying to do in simple
terms: he has covered a lot of ground. Moreover, his interests seem to
gravitate toward precisely those areas of experience that lie outside the
grasp of analytical reduction, that defy coherent description."

[This slipperiness of my work is still true; at the same time I might
apply analytical methodologies or tools, I will subvert them, bring the
bones to the surface.]

"A more appropriate place to begin is with Sondheim's notion of the 'rich-
field experiment' and a related distinction that he draws between 'immer-
sive' and 'definable' situations. A definable situation, according to Son-
dheim, is one which can be broken down into distinct and relatively self-
evident variables without misrepresenting the essential character of the
situation and without relying overmuch on the intuitive faculties of the
definer. Many mechanical devices, mathematical formalisms, unskilled jobs,
and scientific experiments fall easily into this category. In contrast, an
immersive situation resists such decomposition, possesses hidden and in-
terlocked variables, and typically is one in which an intuition of the
character of the situation is itself a major variable. Examples of this
type might be an emotional depression, a religious experience, or a day-
dream. Between these extremes are a vast number of partly immersive,
partly definable situations; those that lend themselves to rich-field ex-
perimentation are generally definable from a position outside the situa-
tion, but immersive from within it."

[I still work through this dialectic - running through programs and proto-
cols, immersing myself in the rules and regulations of IRC, etc. - crea-
ting situations in which avatars/emanants stutter breathlessly. For such
is the world, that we are constrained - by gravity, by the exigencies of
the electromagnetic spectrum - by law - by institutional regulations - by
protocols - by decisions we half-made in the twilight. Just so we jump,
only to be pulled back to earth, we're shown appearance and blinded by the
sun, we cross streets half-way across the block, we are weak and fearful
in the face of one another. A rich-field experiment has multiple variables
in, multiple variables out, and even the parameterization itself may be
called into question.]

"These rich-field experiments, though done in a quasi-scientific spirit,
are deliberately outside the framework of experimental science. They do
not seek to confirm or disprove a hypothesis, nor do they usually produce
quantifiable results. They are freely heuristic, serving to uncover areas
for further investigation, but more importantly, _they are designed to
provoke and record intuition, analysis, and problem-solving behavior in
general, under circumstances where they cannot be easily applied,_ both on
the part of the subject within the experiment, and the experimenter him-
self upon its completion. By their very nature, rich-field experiments
tend to strain, and occasionally exceed, their participants' ability to
reason their way through the situation to the desired goal. In further
contrast to 'hard' science, there is an obvious advantage in having the
experimenter be his own subject, for in this manner he can gain access to
the qualitative subtleties of the situation that might otherwise escape
him."

[Within video or language or graphics or sound, I continue these exten-
sions, these self-operations, moving through areas of dis-comfort, bring-
ing back news from the frontiers. The "desired goal" itself may be prob-
lematic, as may be the operational real or virtual subject, "my" speech or
"my" actions or "my" language or "my" body. The "qualitative subtleties
are perceived as part and parcel of the comprehension of the world. I have
often thought of my work as an examination of the relationships of cons-
ciousness to formal systems: given, say, that a model of quantum mechan-
ics or a restaurant script might be employed by us (on a conscious or un-
conscious level), what are the phenomenologies of such employment, from
within and without, what and how does it mean to know something?]

"One of the basic strategies in all Sondheim's work is to extend an analy-
tical sensibility into situations which are hostile to analysis, thereby
exposing its limits and points of failure. Through such lapses, one can
catch a glimpse of the deeper, extramethodological processes that normally
lie hidden but which inform all specific analytical constructs with utili-
ty and relevance. The accomplishment of a task, whether it be the manipul-
ation of a four-dimensional figure, the speaking of two monologues simult-
aneously, or the construction of a multipurpose formalism (see below), is
not the real issue. Rather, it is the examination of what occurs _in the
attempt._ The setting of a problem is simply a means for luring the mind
into exposing its inner workings, and the success of a project is modera-
tely indifferent as to whether or not the problem is solved. In many cas-
es, errors can be especially revealing and thus much of Sondheim's work,
particularly the earlier work, can be said to be deliberately 'error-
seeking.'"

[My work remains replete with errors, misrecognitions, drawbacks, apolo-
getics, excuses, self-examinations, exposures, exhibitionisms, the prob-
lems themselves almost unaccountable, unaccounted-for. "Luring the mind"
already recognizes the role of desire and seduction, the mind slipping
past the moorings, the moorings unanchored themselves.]

"The rich-field experiments were recently superseded by another sort of
inquiry which Sondheim had been engaged in intermittently since 1970. In a
way, the basic issues are the same: the ability of the mind to create and
manipulate abstract structures, though by replacing physical situations
with systems of symbolic notation, he was able to bring his 'field-work'
into a more immediate correspondence with his mental activity, and in-
crease its degree of immersiveness as well."

[And what are Jennifer, Alan, Julu, etc., if not systems of symbolic nota-
tion, abstract structures that take on the guise of the living, of auton-
omous mental activity? Complete immersivity is seamless virtual reality,
is the holodeck, is psychosis, is the Klein bottle; there are always outs,
as well as ellipses sliding elsewhere among places, spaces, citations.]

"Since 1973 he has been developing _A Formalism Applicable to the Struc-
ture of Most Disciplines._ The formalism is based on two primitive enti-
ties, 'containers,' which have the capacity to store a finite number of
unnamed units or 'bits,' and 'gates,' which permit the transfer of bits
from one container to another. The movement of bits is regulated by the
ticking of an 'internal clock' so that at each tick, all permitted and
required transfers of bits take place simultaneously."
 
[From this to threshold logics, neural networks, 'topologies of inten-
tion.' From this also to couplings and linkages, examination of the phen-
omenology of the Sheffer stroke and its dual - all relevant to the primi-
tives of programming, demarcation, concatenations. Think of the world as a
myriad of part-objects, buzzings, noises, chaos, catastrophes (in the
sense of catastrophe theory), a world inhabited by neural networks, extru-
sions, contour enhancements and thresholds.]

"For our purposes, and apparently for Sondheim's as well, the working-out
of the formalism, the exploration of its descriptive capacity, consti-
tutes its main value: it is a 'notation that can wander.'"

[Wandering, nomadicism, are critical to the emanants, who meet in MOOs,
IRC, talkers, etc. - who form their own coagulations, communalities, only
to separate again - organisms by virtue of the machine.]

"Over the course of its wandering, which fills more than 200 pages in
several notebooks, one sees the formalism repeatedly overgrown with sub-
scripts, superscripts, indices, and brackets, repeatedly condensed into
new symbolisms, large areas of it elaborated and discarded to fit the
needs of some immediate goal. The growth of the formalism is plainly
organic, despite its mechano-cybernetic facade, and offers to the patient
reader a dense ideoglyphy filled with novel and strange creations.

"But before the formalism settled into a final form, Sondheim began to
reflect on the behavior its development demanded of him: how he regulated
its growth; how, when, and why symbols were introduced; how he maintained
his orientation amid its branching complexity."

[Alan appears as a character in the midst of avatars, maintained just as
they are; the work, to the extent that it is a devouring-mechanism, em-
braces and collapses cyberspace as a w/hole, pointing-towards its varied
ecological niches.]

"A third work in this progression," [The second is _A Logic of Conscious-
ness and Being._] "however, _A General Theory of Reality,_ which Sondheim
is still in the process of writing, incorporates many of the themes and
insights of the previous two into a yet larger framework and at the same
times presents them in a much more accessible form. _General Theory_
starts from the premise that

"'the ordinary world of lived experience possesses three aspects: the
phenomenological, the abstract, and the material. In many instances, the
three aspects are interlocked, but they are somewhat independent and
always mutually irreducible. The emphasis here is on description instead
of explanation. Since the theory is not explanatory, and, for the most
part, is not prescriptive, it does not contain procedures for verifica-
tion. Instead it attempts to operate on a meta-level that allows the
classification of existing explanatory theories.'"

[The last quote from me - and it was not a classification that emerged,
but further windows-within-windows, as if multi-tasking had no beginning
and no end, no origin and no finality, no foreclosure, frame problems
without the frames. _General Theory_ was absurd, in a way that the form-
alism was not - it is as if the world were constantly in suspension, un-
able to move without the Word. But it was I who was immobilized, speech-
less in the midst of so much speech - and the World transformed into
Worlds, and these within and without cyberspaces, filmic spaces, video
spaces, all lashed out against the real, while at the same time begging
for Ontology.]

"As to whether or not his work is art, Sondheim argues convincingly that
it is. He speaks of art as a 'discipline without a methodology,' as 'a
desert where all disciplines may be stripped of their status in the
world,' as 'the field of a cultural microscope [where] what is taken else-
where for granted may be seen anew, where the familiar becomes strange.'
In speaking this way, he accepts the dissolution of traditional art forms
as a positive state restoring to the artist the freedom to question all
aspects of experience, to transcend the conventions of all professional
specialties. This state, however, is one of profound alienation and not
without psychological penalty. Particularly in his longer writings, Sond-
heim shows he is plagued by self-doubt ('his tools desert him, he is a man
afloat'). He frequently expresses the fear that he is deluding himself,
that his work is inadequate and futile. His need to test his own limits,
to take risks and abuse his borrowed tools, sometimes tends towards the 
obsessive, but this merely underscores the seriousness of his commitment.
What dominates in the end is a sense of the myriad subtleties of human
consciousness and the vitality of his own analytical eclecticism. His work
has an intensity and scope that is unmistakably modern."

marks on my shoulder, marks on my neck
blue, yellow, black, time-warped
marks and faded marks around my breasts
teeth, fingers, tongue, space-marked
around her breasts and neck and around her shoulders
here and there inland by the sea
across and down my lower back, on her back
clear liquids holed up in my marks
clear liquids holed up in her marks
blood on the bed and my face, between her legs, and clothes
blood liquids between my legs
bitten nails and fingers, wrists
dense liquids pooled up on the bed

  carburetor, a traditional poem
  
  
  among our legs moon mumbles and opens us ,,
  cells cascade into mouths, we are otherwise ,,
  multitudes, the many, our coverings
    ourselves we do not think to name ,,
  clouds thin and noisy, breathing blood ,
    back into sleepy noisy lungs ,,
  pulling from inside-out, pooling from 
    outside-in ,,
  long and highways coasting ,,,

What I Believe


I believe in the power of the word, that I can write myself in and out of
worlds, that each and every inscription is, by its very breath, transform-
ative.
I believe that the world has a certain style, that the style of the world
is in the form of the word, that the word occurs all the way down, layer
after layer of protocols, waves, particles, fields.
I believe in the coherency of the world, 
I believe that information feels, that it is a leverage of the world, that
it is linked to the real
Couplings X X X
I believe that the style of the world is reproducible.
coherency that can for example lend itself across inflationary barriers
I believe I mean such barriers not foreclosed to the imagination which is
the chaos of information.
I believe that the power of the world is littoral.
particles, fields
Couplings X X X
It is always already connected to the institutionalization of power or its
brute force, but it's not that I always believe this.

Tu-lip


tu-lip was gone in the world, smoothed petals against moist skin, 
you could see the writing through them (on the skin, on the petals) 
through them you could read if-tu-lip-yes you could read if-tu-lip-no, 
bruised petals, petals of remonstrance and dissolution, 
petals thinned and wondered towards collapsing sun  
tu-lips as they are fleshed, pale, tu-lips as they are swallowed  
you want to read them, read those fleshed petal lips against yours, 
read the moisture drawn into them, crystalline stamen, you are    you are 
my crystalline stamen   you are my crystalline stamen   you are    you are
my green-stem stamen   you are my crystal green-stem   pinking

Your wet Neck is in my nice stamen
Your love seeps into my stamen - turning me tu-lip-tu-lip
something stretched open to the limit, something held in abeyance:
my thing is my pinking petal of walled up bricks:tu-lip:green-stem: 
Your pinking stamen is in my thrusting stamen and green-stem: petals,
nothing left of me, nothing
giving to stamen green-stem pinking tu-lip something stretched open 
something held open, crystalline, green-stem and stamen! 
tu-lip-skin, festered, remote, pinking, abject:TU-LIP is
wilting, thrust, tu-lip is turning-tu-lip-skin and TU-LIP:TU-LIP:TU-LIP
Your being seeps into my TU-LIP - turning me tu-lip-Julu-Nikuko
turning me tu-lip-Azure-Jennifer

What I'm Doing About It


As September-February virtual writer-in-residence at trAce I'm supposed to
be preparing for incoming. Meanwhile we were three months away from desk-
tops, and the laptops can't handle the Linux system I need. So I bought a
Compaq 5204 only to find the sound gone on the system, which is now being
subject to a quick restore, thanks to Compaq help; the problem remains
which means that hardware's got to be changed. I've already spent an even-
ing when I should be learning cgi-bin stuff playing around with drivers
that I shouldn't have had to touch; I'd already tweaked the Win98 registry
and added a swapfile, etc., and that only took three days. I find myself
caught on slow modems when anything does work (and why is the QuickRestore
disk adding Windows NT setup at the moment? why does it give copying data
and current process percentages without giving the process name and the
time left for restoration?). I'm replete with gremlins; in the cgi-bin, I
used a script that runs on everything else (not my own), thanks to Paula
Edmiston who sent me the URLs; I then set permissions and paths properly
and I can pretend to add to hypertext to no avail. It's hot here but at
least the computers (this older Pentium 100 and the Compaq which runs at
330 with a different chip) are cooled over by the window. I'm desperate
for rain. I'm not made for file permissions and drivers and tech support
which isn't life support. I'm panicky about the residency, feeling very
unprepared - not enough perl, not enough javascript, only the blurred edg-
es of a story and what about those email lists? - I'm run ragged at the
precipice lip, out of money for further equipment (I'd give a lot if I had
it for a Toshiba Libretto fit out with RedHat 6.1 - _that_ would be ideal)
and out of sorts as "SystemSave" keeps running to my right - all of my own
data and tweaking having been erased of course. Well, this has all come to
an end with the QuickRestore and sure enough the sound is still bad and I
call up support again and tech tells me I have to bring it in to a certi-
fied dealer - well, first he's (the first tech was she's) got me going
into safe mode and removing the sound card and of course that's not it,
and then I hang up and check the warranty and it says I get on-site ser-
vice and I call tech support for the third time after calling the Compaq
main office at 2 in the morning and how dare they remain closed when I'M
calling, and anyway, the third guy agrees to the terms, gives me a case
number (now I'm official, I'm a case - this is the third case I've had
with Compaq mind you in three years, the other two ending in a class ac-
tion lawsuit), so within 3 to 5 days I can presumably start setting up
RedHat Linux 6.1 (if I can find it cheap enough) on the system (I've never
used lilo for booting, just System Commander), and and and and and

the whole world is beginning to feel like one big kludge, I shouldn't be
the virtual-writer-in-residence, I can hardly spell my name at the moment,
my work is all one big lie, the center doesn't hold and either do the
edges and for that matter nothing in particular holds anywhere across the
middle either, and I think

that all of human history is one big kludge, bumbling around, it's amazing
if the keyboard works (even if it's not connected to anything, I have one
of those Microsoft contoured ones and it feels great, but the system's
shut down until the repairs are done), it's amazing if the mouth works, if
speech works, in the long run into that dark dark night as Fitzgerald
might say, there's no one to call, no one to pick up the phone, no machine
to take the messages, no machine to deliver them, there's only that si-
lence on the line, there are no lines, there are no phones, no ears to
hear no mouths to speak of, and I think

thank god we're all fools looking down at our feet, I wonder if I can do
anything with this semi-broken RedHat Linux 5.0 on the other machine, so
what if the cgi-bin doesn't work, the colors aren't proper, and it won't
go into SVGA mode, keeping me in a ridiculous 640 by 480 or some such with
Netscape Communicator not even staying properly within X-Window coordin-
ates, but flooding all over multiple desktops, making me jumpy when I'm
working, just another kludge, I look into the mirror

and see parts and parts and parts, nothing whole, just assemblages linked
together, it's psychosis that makes me think they're only concatenated,
coupled, broken, ready to collapse at any moment, whole worlds are held
together

by tethers like that, this, the other, just as the parts of me beg for
different names
