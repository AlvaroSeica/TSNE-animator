Murderous Dancesphere for Foofwa'd'I'm'mobilized Company


Project: An enormous translucent plasticine sphere 300m in diameter will 
be erected upon certain neighborhoods in Geneva. Here, dancers will 
perform without the benefits of occasional inclement weather. In the style 
of Niki de Saint Paul, dancers will perform within the fabricated and 
static bodies of dancer-avatars ranging in height from 40m to 400m, 
constructed of similar material; these bodies are partially encased and 
partially external to the Dancesphere itself. Due to the rigors of the 
weather, this sphere and accompanying avatar structures are designed to 
remain on site indefinitely. The result is a natural, perfect, and 
perfectly natural, space for the permanent housing of the FdImC.

Date: This project will be fully in place at the time of the 2006 vernal
equinox, 3m/20d/18hr/26min.

Occasion and occasional: The project commemorates, not the impresario 
FdIm, but the Companions of the Company themselves, who have repeatedly 
requested a politically murderous space for their performances. In 
addition, we hope, with good reason, for the fallout of precipitation from 
the recumbent surfaces of the plasticine architectonics; new patterns of 
weather will result, outlined in faint traces of polluting residue on the 
concrete and asphalt surfaces of certain historic sections of the city.

Please note the simulated blood and other effluvia 'coursing' through the
artificial veins (in actuality, supporting tubules) of the structures.

Addendum: Dancers' injuries are quickly absorbed, not only through self- 
absorption, but also by the Dancesphere and avatars themselves, which 
organically respond.

nasa and the dream of outer inner space


constructed a vlf radio (vlf-3) with a nasa kit (see INSPIRE project) and 
accidently (clumsily) soldered an inductor connection poorly (it didn't 
take) so that the connection was loose but really (honestly) non-existent 
- the result interior noise (white noise related to the very fabric of the 
cosmos) in relation to exterior signals (60 cycle hum, things in the 
farther and uncanny distance), universe (upon universe (upon universe)) 
now happily working properly (the interior silenced) - below here _the
improper_ (impropriety)

the excavation or hole at the top of the valley

"it is the privilege of the prophet to descend into the valley
from the mountain where truth is closest to god. the people in
the valley wait for the prophet with delight. the prophet
speaks slowly and takes his time."
on the mountain the prophet speaks with a roar and a fury

"sometimes the prophet is silent, speaking by way of travel.
to and from the valley with a roar and a fury, to and from
the valley with delight and a song - that is the speech of the
prophet."
we belong in the valley, the prophet proclaims from on high.
with the sign of the curve and the next curve around (at a 
furious speed with a roar), the prophet gives us his sign.
"we ascend from the valley in the chariot of prophecy, with
delight and a song, we descend from the mountain with a roar
and a fury."
"spoken to, we speak for the first time, primordial origin of 
speech."

apropos 

i will call you on a telephone
you and i are all alone
in the midst of battle you can hear the rattle
of magneto churning bell loud in all this hell
you'll answer it.
halloo halloo i'll say and a moment after
it will be the time of all the slaughter
in the meantime, laughter.
you'll joke in bad english, french, hebrew, japanese,
you'll say whatever you please, the state, it's me,
something about liberty, secret countdowns,
and underground it's all you, i'm at sea perhaps
or come unglued, the phone cranks and creaks,
condensers leak, but only slightly. they're ungainly,
these EE-8s, need wire, secret calls and cells.
something tells me you're not there, a microphone
hidden and reporting home (i mainly grasp at straws):
'there are no laws.'

Reviews of Technologies and Books I like


This is a mixed bag - I'm including devices as well as the usual.

Understanding the Linux Kernel, O'Reilly, Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati 
3rd edition - I'm close to totally ignorant in relation to computer 
science; on the other hand, I'm quite enjoying this - which for me can 
only be considered a simultaneous autopsy and archaeology. The book is 
enormous - around 900 pages - and it gives an indelible picture of even the 
commonest computer tasks - creating a file for example. But it also 
provides a picture of an unbelievable architecture, which occasionally 
gets metaphorically translated - for example, the appendix on System 
Startup, which moves through such things as 'Prehistoric Age: the BIOS' to 
'Modern Age: the start_kernel() Function.' I can follow most of this text, 
which says a great deal about the authors and the clearness of the 
exposition. Highly recommended to anyone interested in open software, 
linux, operating systems, or the vagaries of non-human inordinate 
complexity. (There are sections on signals, interrupts, process 
creation/scheduling/killing, program execution, and so forth.)

NASA INSPIRE VLF-3 radio receiver kit. This kit - for building a very low 
frequency radio - costs around $80 and includes around 75 components. 
You'll need a low-power soldering iron and other (minimal) tools; the 
assembly takes about four hours - afterwards I felt I could build anything 
(not true of course). The radio is very high gain, has a built-in filter, 
data and audio outputs, and mic input on one channel (in order to describe 
time and location for example). VLF is fascinating; I'm using the signals 
in my work (spherics, whistlers, moans, insects, passing bikes, dawn 
chorus, etc.), modifying them with Audiomulch or some such. Check out the 
INSPIRE site - it's terrific. A VLF-3 is also online; you can pick up the 
signals through the Net. 

Unix in a Nutshell, O'Reilly, Arnold Robbins, 4th edition. The nut has 
grow to the size of a coconut; this handbook is huge, covering not only 
Unix, but GNU/Linux, Mac OSX+, and Solaris, as well as numerous programs, 
shells, editors, and package managers. While one can always do an 
'apropos' and/or 'man' to access online help re: commands, the handbook is 
useful for browsing through options and examples; it gives excellent 
overviews of the systems. As usual, lots of stuff on sed, awk, vi, vim, 
etc. (although the Sed and Awk book - if for no other reason, the title - 
is still my favorite). One of my favorite deprecated commands seems to be 
no longer listed - 'fold' - which can split a text various ways. On the 
other hand, the six and a half pages on 'stty' are invaluable (necessary 
when accessing a shell account with the Sharp Zaurus, which runs on 
linux). This is one book I use pretty constantly.

WWII EE-8 field telephones. I found two of these ten-pound units, which 
run on magnetos (for ringing up) and 3 volts worth of batteries (for 
actual talk).The circuits are incredibly simple; I had to do some repairs, 
but it was worth it. The lines are half-duplex - either I talk or you 
talk, but not both at once. The phones have a switch on them, much like CB 
radio. I've been using these for audio pieces, and eventually they'll end 
up in an installation in Los Angeles. Check out 
http://www.asondheim.org/fieldphone2.mp3 for an example.

Speaking of old equipment, I'm also playing around with an 1895 telegraph 
receiver; this is similar to a morse-code key, except that it's activated 
by two solenoids. The result - send 1.5 volts through it, and you'll hear 
a click. That's all. It's small and can be placed on all sorts of 
resonators. The 'down' click has a different sound/'feel' from the 'up' 
click and the telegraph operator had to tell the difference. 

Linux Multimedia Hacks, Tips & Tools for Taming Images, Audio, and Video, 
O'Reilly, Kyle Rankin. I _still_ am frustrated with linux, although I've 
temporarily given up on it, in terms of multimedia. Blender and Gimp work 
incredibly well, even ImageMagick can be a kind of murderous fun. But I 
really want to work more intuitively, closer to WYSIWYG, which is usually 
possible even in Premiere. This book is unusual, and when I return to 
linux (after the full-speed ahead media stuff I'm chained to at the 
moment), I'll be working through it. There is an entire chapter on broad- 
cast media - TV, podcasting, ripping audio/video, etc. There's neat stuff 
as usual on transforming video into ASCII, stuff on Audacity (one of the 
cooler sound editors around), and stuff on the Web. What's missing for me 
- and this is _really_ me, not the OS - is the multi-media environment; 
this book goes a long way towards creating one. Why use linux at all for 
media? Because it's fun, because it's more or less open-source,because 
there are things you can do that you can't with more typical editors, 
because if you get serious with, say, animation, there's nothing like a 
render farm. But for quick-and-dirty, for patching stuff together quickly 
that still's amazing, the standard OS 10* or WinXP work quicker. I want to 
explore this book (and my own system) thoroughly; on the other hand, I 
don't want command-line interfaces for A/V.

The Ancestor's Tale, A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, Richard 
Dawkins, in which we go on a journey back through time. I love this book 
and most highly recommend it; after I ran out of James Lee Burke, I wanted 
something for late-night reading in the comfort zone. This is it! Over 650 
pages of evolution, brilliantly written, with all sorts of information - 
for example, I had always thought amphioxus was primary in vertebrate 
development - but now there are new discoveries from China. A lot of 
molecular information is also provided. There are 327 sources in the 
bibliography. Minor phyla - anything on the way back to origins - are 
covered in some detail. This is one of the best 'comfort books' I've read 
in a long time.

Speaking of the Sharp Zaurus, although they're difficult to get hold of in 
the US, you can find them on Craig's list or Ebay. I have two, and use 
both. They're linux-based PDAs, and there are literally hundreds of 
programs available - not only that, but you can download perl and other 
languages to use on their terminal windows. They're quirky - the only 
linux OS I've seen to crash, but I've found them excellent for working/ 
producing on the run; a lot of my diagram-work was created on them. If you 
have the chance and patience, check them out.

Parlor guitars - they're on E-Bay, from the late 18th- through the early 
20th- century. I want to argue for their comeback; they're unique in their 
small size half-folk half-classical resonance. Everyone I've seen has an 
incredible tone, providing you stay away from the popular brands. Look for 
something without a label, or a Stetson or old Washburn or Howe, or Larson 
or whatever. I tune low, use nylon strings (they were made for that), and 
find the small neck allows for incredible reach; most of my playing now is 
either on the would-be Larson I have or the 1949 Di Giorgio classical 
complete with a hyperbolic wooden inset to channel and cool the bass. Both 
guitars are unbelievable.

Then again, there are all those Casio keyboards. I was recently given a 
CZ-101, a relatively early portable keyboard synthesizer, and the tones 
produced are fascinating; there are 'solo' and other switches that allow 
for fast improvisation as well. I use two other keyboard by the way - both 
highly recommended - a Victorian pump organ that has a really rich tone 
and a lot of dynamic possibilities (a lot of the music I've done for 
Foofwa d'Imobilite has been created on it) - and an Ensoniq Mirage. I ran 
into the latter when I had a group, Damaged Life, in the 80s. Now they're 
old-fashioned, heavy, clunky. They're half digital, half analog, and have 
an uncannily realistic feeling to the touch (keyboard) and sound (MIDI or 
analog). I've been using one constantly for two years now. When I've had 
residencies at the Experimental Television Center, I've used theirs - 
which made me aware of the possibilities. Takes floppy disks. Weighs a 
lot. Sounds unbelievable.

Digital Video Production Cookbook, O'Reilly, Chris Kenworthy. This is an 
odd book; the subtitle is '100 Professional Techniques for Independent & 
Amateur Filmmakers.' I love 'Filmmakers' - everyone uses this word, even 
though film is nothing but a whisper. Some of the photographs show what I 
think is a Sony 150 (or thereabouts). The techniques are extremely useful 
and the book is valuable if you don't know them (for example pull focus, 
miniature worlds, how to pull a punch). Most of the techniques reference 
those moments in the plot which call for effects ranging from lasers to 
silhouettes - in other words, standard narrative production is emphasized.  
Some of the effects - for example using shadows or camera flow - are 
relevant to stylistic considerations in general; I wish there were more of 
these. In this regard, the Camera Movement section is the most useful. In 
any case, if you _are_ working in narrative or commercials, this book is 
invaluable. The material on pull-focus is something everyone should know 
(one of the first things I demo when teaching video). On the other hand, 
if you're more interested in the fine points of genre, experimental work, 
'bending the rules,' etc., this doesn't have much information (for example 
breaking the '180 degree rule' in shooting an interior). I should note 
that all of the O'Reilly books on digital video are useful - they waste 
little space, get to the point, and show you the way to everything from 
holding the camera to DVD distribution. Everyone can learn from them - or 
their equivalent; I've seen far too much bad video, video that could have 
been a lot better if just one or two things were changed (most of the 
problems are usually with sound - good sound carries just about everything 
- and the Digital Video Production Cookbook has little information on 
this).

Hey Rube, Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of 
Dumbness, Simon and Schuster, Hunter S. Thompson. I just love the combo of 
spot-on thought and football, 9/11 and titles like Honolulu Marathon Is 
Decadent and Depraved. This was done for ESPN.com I think, who cares? it's 
wonderful.

Speaking of that I know I mentioned James Lee Burke somewhere above, but 
you really should read him - half history, half mysticism, half depth 
analysis of the unpretty USA, half mists, half accurate, and probably one 
of the best 'story-tellers' around. His books are deceptively easy, give 
great pleasure of the text, ring true, contain fury repressed.

Wireless Hacks, Tips and Tools for Building, Extending, and Securing Your 
Network, O'Reilly, Bob Flickenger & Roger Weeks, second edition. Any 
wireless information amazes me - the world is filled with information flux 
that just about anyone can pull down. Wireless hacking ranges from 
building focused parabolic or cylindrical antennas to using Kismet (by the 
way, available for Zaurus) or Netstumbler (by the way the MIDI output can 
be used as a sound/music source). If you're working with WiFi in any way 
at all, this book is absolutely necessary. Now what I find interesting - 
WiFi, just like VLF radio, re-presents the world - your mapping, percep- 
tion, is different. For example on page 91, WiFi power levels around 
Kingston, Rhode Island, and on page 144, a section on graphing wireless 
performance, with a chart indicating signal fade in the middle of the day. 
Radio reorganizes our experience, in other words; an online community 
obviously possesses different geographics than an offline one - and WiFi 
is somewhere in the middle - obviously networking, but just as obviously 
situated. Because of this, the Wireless Hacks themselves can range from 
programming to gadgeteering - often both at the same time (similar in some 
respects to Make magazine). The book by the way goes way beyond the 
Pringles can waveguide - there's a lot of antenna information.

If you don't have a Sony 2010 shortwave, try and find one. The design and 
circuitry (there were minimal changes) held for over ten years, and it's 
one of the most compact useful radios around. I've recorded from it, 
experimented with it, listened for hours. The sound's not that great, but 
the separation and signal processing - including synchronous tuning - is 
superb. Almost all the Sony shortwaves are good; I also have an old and 
cheap analog one that has terrific sound and gets low-wave as well (both 
units go down to around 150k).

Open Sources 2.0, The Continuing Revolution, O'Reilly, edited by Chris 
DiBona, Danese Cooper, and Mark Stone. I wish I could review this book in 
detail; I've been skipping around in it forever. If you join Safari, you 
get a 'free 45-day online edition' which might be worth it, since O'Reilly 
books are expensive and it's an easy way to read a lot of them. In any 
case, you might want to try the library. There are articles on Linux 
of course, Mozilla, open source and entrepreneurs/business, biology, 
Nupedia and Wikipedia, Europe, China, India, etc., and a few columns from 
Slashdot as well. There is also an 'Open Source Definition' and various 
open source licenses. I have to admit, first, I haven't been reading in 
detail, but for 'fun,' which it is, and second, I want to mention it in 
any case, i.e. without a detailed analysis (it is fun, relevant, part of 
an ongoing paradigm shift that is somewhat unprecedented, Lautreamont etc. 
notwithstanding), because you should somehow take a look at this book, as 
well as at its predecessors.

Poems of the Masters, China's Classic Anthology of T'ang and Sung Dynasty 
Verse, Copper Canyon, translated by Red Pine. Wow! RP is my favorite 
translator of Chinese texts - for one thing, he almost always gives the 
original, so if you want to examine the characters, you can. For another, 
as I've pointed out before, there's no punctuation - the lines are open- 
ended, which parallels the Chinese. I like his Stonehouse and Cold 
Mountain Han Shan and Heart Sutra and Diamond Sutra and Tao te Ching 
translations, as well as his work on mountain hermits. Except for the Tao 
te Ching (which exists in various forms) or Gary Snyder's Cold Mountain, 
these seem perfect to me. 

Finally, Scenes for Mandarins, The Elite Theater of the Ming, Columbia, 
Cyril Birch - translations of scenes from Ming drama. The scenes are 
described and commented upon in detail. Ming drama is classical, highly 
polished, and the book is a great read.

Why do so many books today have subtitles? The Brothers Karamazov, an 
Unfunny Family. Madame Bovary, or the Railroading Life and Times. They go 
on and on.

That's about it. I hope you find this useful in some way. If nothing else, 
check out the Burke.

yes, yes, yes, the film was found in a ceiling.
honestly, sealed up in the boards. brian gave it to me.
8mm which originated in 1932 but the images are much older.
i'd say from 1920 or so perhaps 1915 perhaps 1905.

now there's this image on top of it.
two versions of the image melded unmelded.
then what's what.
now the image melded unmelded projected ten fifteen feet up there.

Culture of Lies


I was listening to the Colbert Report the other night; Carl Bernstein was 
on. He answered briefly and to the point. His take on Bush and company: 
lies. His take on current politics in this country: bought.

These are corporate behaviors, or behavior-sheaves, interconnected modes 
of action. Corporations live them; lies are brought and formulated in the 
workplace as everyday matters. Ethics is compartmentalized and doesn't 
apply. Skip to Hiaasen's 60 Minutes interview and you'll find more of the 
same analysis.

I lived within this culture when I taught at Florida International a few 
years ago. I was dismissed and the tenure-track line canceled as well. I 
was told by the department head the cut-back was financial and came from 
the dean. I was told by the union representative that the cut-back came 
from the department. When I took the job I was told that there was 
suitable equipment and funds for the position. When I arrived there wasn't 
any. My partner was told that a museology line was in place. There wasn't 
any. I was told I'd be given fund-raising contacts. There weren't any. The 
department announced to the local paper that it had built a new multi- 
media classroom; it hadn't. I was told my situation was my fault; was the 
dean' fault; was the department chair's fault; was the governor's fault. 
Whatever happened there, and I don't know to this day, I behaved ethic- 
ally (but neurotically); the surrounding culture didn't.

It's easy to live according to the cover-up and the world's technologic- 
ally smarter than it was in Nixon's day. Lies are distanced through the 
media; you can believe you're behaving ethically because otherwise you're 
just speaking through a microphone. The public here buys into that; a 
recent poll for example shows that 56% of those interviewed favored 
government wire-tapping if needed. This is fundamentally against the 
principles of America, as is the notion of the collusion of religion and 
government, as well as military pre-emptive strikes. Growing up here means 
growing up through WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Libya, Nicaragua, Granada, Iraq, 
and hosts of other conflicts. We live within a militarism that has no need 
to pay attention to the local verbal conflicts here. The majority of 
Americans favor gun laws; we won't get them. The majority favors health 
care; we won't get it and we're told on one hand that seniors are given 
additional choices - at the same time the safety net is being eroded to 
nothingness. We're told we have a crisis of social security at the same 
time we're paying exponentially-increasing health-care costs and doctors 
and drug companies are getting richer. To give you again an idea from 
personal life - we live here in Brooklyn on around $18,000/year. My father 
pays my health care, or most of it. It's the rock-bottom at $6000 a year. 
There's also 'co-payments' every time I see a doctor or get medicine; 
there's a $100 deductible on drugs yearly. This is obscene; we're so far 
below the poverty level it's ridiculous, and at the same time, there's no 
safety net - yet we pay taxes to fund Halliburton and an outrageous deadly 
war in Iraq.

In an idea world, Bush Inc. would be held accountable; he won't be. The 
culture closes, forecloses, on itself. It's everyday business, just like 
Nazism was everyday business. But this is in for the long run; these 
people are self-preserving. The scandals make no difference at all; the 
truth is always seen as contestable, just as Darwin or weapons of mass 
destruction are contestable. The culture of lies depends on one hand on a 
population willing to put up with autocracy, desiring autocracy, as the 
safety net disappears; it licks its masters because there's no other game 
in town, except religion, already bought and sold and integrated. The 
culture of lies depends on the other on a verbal sophistry which is based 
on a notion of the insignificance of truth; truth is reserved for one's 
inner soul, for the Rapture, for the back-room - men are like that. The 
lie is possible because the language of finance, not personal and verbal 
language, carries the greatest weight; it's not for nothing that we have 
expressions like 'the buck stops here' and 'the bottom line.' This is also 
the reason, by the way, that American political rhetoric is so filled with 
sports talk; the game plan is to win at any cost. Sublimating truth into 
the arena of arenas backs up a culture of gambling, the killer play (not 
unlike the killer app) - a culture in which ontology has shifted from the 
oath and linguistic performativity to stock-market performance. This is 
fundamental, however trite it is (i.e. 'money talks' which just about sums 
it up); the culture of lies _is_ a culture, and needs the security and 
stability of big money for those who play, or those who hope to play, it. 
It ensures it's the only game in town.

On the farther end of the spectrum is the rest of us, lying as well for 
that matter, just as embedded. We're the embedded reporters in fact who 
bring back from Iraq what the government and military want us to hear; 
we're the 'crackers' and everyone else just getting by, moving through an 
increasingly implosive world of drought, extinctions, and information, 
leaving us behind. The superstructure has finally succeeded in taming the 
base; the base is whatever the superstructure says it is, until famine 
sets in, and then war - required as well by the superstructure. It's a 
different ball-game.

There's no end to this analysis which has been told over and over again, 
and we continue to tell it, just was empathetic magic is based on 
repetition. It's no use, except for self-comfort late at night; the 
culture of lies will bring us increasing war, violence, violation of human 
rights, and poverty - all in the name of fighting terrorism, playing on 
the internet, living the good life, betting on the Superbowl, making sure 
we have 'no child left behind,' counting on the 'village' it takes to make 
a child, waiting for the Rapture, fearing the hyperbolic hyperviolent God 
fundamentalists purvey, and buying mostly on credit, houses, cars, SUVs, 
cable television, high-definition TV, Ipods, camcorders, computers, 
Internet connections, Caribbean cruises, ecotourisms (which are not that 
'eco'), factory-'farmed' meats, hunting expeditions, fishing trips, 
visiting the natives, mega-speakers, cell phones, camera phones, 
text-messaging phones, video phones, back yard pools, swing sets, personal 
trainers, gym memberships, fashionable clothing, anti-fashionable 
clothing, guns, knives, sex-tapes, miserable health-care, processed foods, 
the latest cosmetics, unbelievably bad school systems, Bibles, church 
memberships, Wired magazine, Fortune magazine, Time magazine, Sports 
Illustrated, Reader's Digest, plastic toys, plastic toy guns, skate- 
boards, off-road vehicles (which tear up the wilderness), jet skis (which 
pollute the water), power-boats (which have wounded every single manatee 
still alive), yachts, cruise-control, lawsuits, and just about everything 
else that keeps the American public way down (and falling) on the quality- 
of-life index. This is the new world of freedom, as Absolut as it's going 
to get, and we'll do everything we can to get to the finish line.

Listening to the Power Grid


A 100' external long-wire antenna is connected to a VLF-3 receiver 
grounded in the building. The receiver output is recorded on a Sony
minidisk. The final result is filtered until patterns are readily
discerned. The jpg below is from SpectrumLab of the raw material.
Frequency shifts show a moire-pattern in time.

note: the aesthetics and philosophical concerns, in relation to body, 
audio spectrum, aurality, sexuality, and digital and analog phenomenology,
are clear. an exciting thesis may be created in relation to these concerns 
but would this be anything other than an academic exercise in theorizing? 
I give you instead the raw material from which stars and theories are 
formed. you may do something with the second, not much with the first. in 
any case it is out of my hands, and into yours.

Messages of the gods from a 1952-4 Hallicrafters S-38C shortwave radio.
But mind the power! This model is easy for electrocution; I managed to 
draw a 3/8" spark.

Since output is high impedance, I used mics connected to the Sony 
minidisk.

Transformations include noise and hiss reduction, delay.

phan

phan-dance http://www.asondheim.org/phan.mp4 tears the body apart. for 
what is the phan but the slicing and cauterization of the skin of the 
Other? and what is revealed that is not seen so many times on our American 
beaches? yet the dance is murderous in the eyes of the Saudi family and 
its American offspring. for who has done the will of the Americans if not 
the Saudi family? i have represented without representation, i have 
described without description, i have carefully formed face and limb 
without forming limb, without forming face. for what is it that would 
withstand the Devil. for what is the phan but the Devil's tool in the 
hands of the righteous?

origin of dance

it was very hard to see enemy. enemy lived in caves. enemy has always 
lived in caves. first enemy destroyed lions and sloths and tigers. then 
enemy destroyed mammoths and mastodons and great auks. now enemy destroys 
enemy. now enemy destroys us. we say 'yes yes yes.' this is origin of 
song. enemy titillates us with brilliance and amazing sleazy sex-life.  
enemy ties us up willingly. then enemy buries us in caves. we did not 
expect that burying. enemy uses only sticks or rocks for messages. enemy 
uses only messaging voices and reminding paper scraps. enemy whispers 
'take heed take heed.' we are twisted by beauty of enemy world. we step 
over bodies of cave bears, cave wolves, sabre-toothed tigers, dodos, 
carolina parakeets. cave reeks of them. their stick bones stick in us. 
enemy lances our cunts with mastodons. enemy lances our pricks with 
mammoths. this is 'jumping-about.' this 'jumping-about' is origin of 
dance. http://www.asondheim.org/cjdd.mp4

well, trying to breathe, last night I had a bad coughing spell.
I thought my lungs were coming out.
today I bought the Hans Bellmer book, am I really that perverse?
also Tamara Karsavina, Theatre Street, ballet biography.
Herman Kahn, Thinking About the Unthinkable, an old Avon paperback.
and American Film Genres, Stuart M. Kaminsky.
these are exciting finds, stoking my furnace for style change!
not to mention thermonuclear war!

eWWII EE-8 field telphone images -

Found these images while rummaging around, repairing the field telephones 
used in the sound pieces. The robust and partly corroded technology is 
interesting; eventually I was able to get everything working. The 
equipment is older than I am.

 Nomenclature of Opuntia Cactus Spines


 I have been enumerating the spines of my opuntia, which are in the 
 thousands. It seems far too difficult to name them individually; however,
 they might well be grouped by tens, hundreds, even thousands. Such
 groups are families, for example the kynn family, kgerrard family, and so
 forth. I am delighted with the results. Whereas spines previously were
 associated only with a particular pad, now they are placed within smaller
 communal organizations of both friendship and cameraderie.

 For a long time, I worked on the various family names; the following are
 the results. Please note there may be repetitions; consider this one of
 the follies of the time, the difficulty to track anything at all (given
 the relative explosion of information, to which the spines themselves are
 immune). Enjoy -
