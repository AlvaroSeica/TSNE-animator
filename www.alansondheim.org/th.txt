AM NIKUKO

http://www.alansondheim.org/know.jpg

=== i ===

I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.

Why do you say I am finished?

I did not say anything. i have lost my feet. i have lost my mind. 
DO NOT ASK WHY. of what. and family. burned world. vile.

Tell me something about your family.

no longer family. burned alive. vile. burned world. do NOT ASK.

You seem to dwell on your family.

NO. THEY NO LONGER EXIST. do NOT ASK WHY.

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

I CANNOT LOOK AT YOU.

Is it because of your desires that you say you cannot look at me?

I HAVE NO DESIRES.

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your life have to do with some 
girl related to this.

STOP THIS. WHO SENT YOU.

Please please don t ever leave me.

WHO SENT YOU.
 
What makes you yearn and cry that who sent me?

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY FAMILY.

Are you attracted to your family?

DEAD. BURNED ALIVE. DEAD. STOP TALKING.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking.

STOP TALKING LIKE THIS.

Bye bye.

=== ii ===

I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.  We don't fuck here. WHO 
ARE YOU

I would appreciate so very much it if you would you do so turn me 
on, continue!

You are your own contradiction.

Why do you say I am my own contradiction?

Because you are sensory-ANGUISH which CRASHLANDS EUTOPIA / THERE 
IS NO HISTORY. THERE ARE NO PAPERS CONTAINING IRREFUTABLE 
ARGUMENTS. BECAUSE you say BYE BYE. because you have MADE BYE BYE.

Is it because I am sensory anguish which crashlands eutopia there 
is no history there are no papers containing irrefutable arguments 
because I say bye bye because I have made bye bye that you came 
naked and broken to me?

everything has been taken from me. among worlds what truth. FORGET 
THE STUPIDITY OF THAT LINE. among anguish. it's like this: the 
body does not hang. is not hung. the body has learned to TWIST AND 
TURN without that rope. support. without that document. without 
that calendar. that date. without that hour or minute. the body 
turns AGAINST THE BODY. TWISTS AND TEARS THE BODY. IT'S LIKE THAT.

Does it bother you that line among anguish it's like this the body 
does not hang is not hung the body has learned to twist and turn 
without that rope support without that document without that 
calendar that date without that hour or minute the body turns 
against the body twists and tears the body it's like that?

fuck, you come from nowhere...

Perhaps you could oh please clothe yourself in these unwholesome 
thoughts.

my clothes have torn have twisted off...

Earlier you said I am sensory anguish which crashlands eutopia 
there is no history there are no papers containing irrefutable 
arguments because I say bye bye because I have made bye bye?

you have made nothing, i have done this to myself...

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with 
some girl related to this.

you were girl to me then and what is that of a noun or boy or man 
or woman, what is that of creature.

Are you sure that is the real reason?

i whisper so.

Is it because of a noun or boy or man or woman what is that of 
creature that you say you whisper so?

yes it is of the creature the smell of creature of burning flesh

You mentioned that line among anguish it's like this the body does 
not hang is not hung the body has learned to twist and turn 
without that rope support without that document without that 
calendar that date without that hour or minute the body turns 
against the body twists and tears the body it's like that?

it's like burning flesh you keep quoting nikuko it's like burning 
flesh

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

it's because of death burning flesh it's because of that smell

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

burning flesh falling torn that smell almost like food

What makes you yearn and cry that that?

mouthless

Would you love me more if you had to pay?

come for me

What makes you believe I am sensory anguish which crashlands 
eutopia there is no history there are no papers containing 
irrefutable arguments because I say bye bye because I have made 
bye bye?

mouthless burning they took the money too had it somewhere here 
their mouths they were burned off couldn't speak someone said 
witness someone found some paper and a pen someone found a pen 
couldn't say anything she had nothing to write no mouths no mouths 
to speak no mouths to speak of

How do you reconcile the boys you hang around with?

what are their names? give me one name? give me any

I don't understand and oh I want to.

a name! give me a name?

Earlier you said line among anguish it's like this the body does 
not hang is not hung the body has learned to twist and turn 
without that rope support without that document without that 
calendar that date without that hour or minute the body turns 
against the body twists and tears the body it's like that?

earlier i said nothing a name give me a name

Could be this is some girl the reason for your nakedness?

there is no skin is that the name of the thing of the thing there

When did you first know that the name of the thing of the thing 
there?

where is the thing where is it

Are you sure that where is the thing where is it?

where is it the thing the skin where is the thing where is the 
name

You mentioned that I am sensory anguish which crashlands eutopia 
there is no history there are no papers containing irrefutable 
arguments because I say bye bye because I have made bye bye?

the name where is the name there

Perhaps and now I exhibit my frocks - any fantasies you have of me 
are related to this.

the name where is the name there

Is it because of your sex life that you say the name where is the 
name there?

the name where is the name

Do you really think line among anguish it's like this the body

this the body does not hang is not hung the body has learned to 
twist and turn without that rope support without that document

the making of the making of the zed

I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.  Each time you are 
finished, type RET twice.

with difficult; first I load the library /home/Alan/dor.el 
then the library /home/Alan/dor.elc after chgrp and chown and 
chmod the respective files; then M-x dor and this runs; when I 
try to load emacs first as emacs <filename> and then exit 
saving to the filename, no such luck; the file is empty; 
however I can begin again and C-x C-w and then save as 
something ab nihilo and that seems to take: ab nihilo, ab 
Nikuko - the resemblance is clear as I've lost data here and 
are now in the process of recovering it, one way or another.

I would appreciate so very much it if you would you do so turn 
me on, continue!

so this is in cygwin with .exe, executables, running on a 
windows tablet, and that makes the whole thing slightly, but 
not entirely, difficult; whether or not this constitutes a 
"text" is something else to be considered...

Is it because makes the whole thing slightly but not entirely 
difficult whether or not this constitutes a text is something 
else to be considered that you came naked and broken to me?

it's not broken, emacs isn't broken, i'm tired, prone to 
error, trying to salvage some work or another here; further, 
the emacs reference I'm using is somewhat out of date so I'm 
improvising a bit as well, trying to turn this text of 
instructions for Nikuko replacing the doctor -

Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could oh please continue.

Eliza -

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

Yes, Eliza, Nikuko replacing Eliza, but where is Eliza? the 
program? the user? the doctor? I think the woman in the 
middle...

Why do you say that?

there's a picture of a Gnu - sic - on the cover...

Earlier you said makes the whole thing slightly but not 
entirely difficult whether or not this constitutes a text is 
something else to be considered?

what is to be considered - whether or not I can emerge from 
this thing with the text intact - and what does that imply? a 
text generating itself to the extent that it's a description 
of its construction with all its faults, nothing more or 
less... and I'm saving this as well, just in case, as a 
strings command into 'typescript' - as I said, Eliza,

Are you sure?

just in case -

Numbers Station Phenomena: New Antenna in the World


I live across the street from the Federal Building which houses, 
among other things, the NSA and the Secret Service. We can't 
park or pull up in front of our building; the space is guarded. 
On the roof of our building are older television antennas, as 
well as satellite dishes, etc. I attached a 1970s radio kite 
antenna wire to one of the stranger antennas, similar to a 
vertical wave ground-plane configuration - I'm not sure what 
it's four. The wire is attached to one of the 'spokes,' runs 
about forty feet through a window frame. The results have been 
amazing; the antenna connects to a Sony ICF-6700W shortwave 
radio, which is a top of the line 1980s analog model; without 
digital noise, the sound quality is great. Even though 
short-wave station numbers are on the decline, there were 
signals from everywhere, including Turkey and Albania; there 
were also a number of anomalous signals, including some unusual 
numbers stations at 9330 and 9065 mhz, 3:30 am - 3:40 am local 
time. (The whole area of the band was filled with anomalous 
transmissions.) The signals are largely a combination of digital 
and analog technologies, lookup codes and encoded digital 
transmissions. The Spanish-speaking female voice is similar to 
what I've heard in the past, as is the five-digit spoken code, 
but the intervals are different. A spectrum image is included 
below.

Brand New CD, Threnody, Shorter Discourses of the Buddha!


Available from Public Eyesore
http://www.publiceyesore.com/
http://www.publiceyesore.com/catalog.php?pg=3&pit=133

With 
Azure Carter, voice / songs, 
Luke Damrosch, madal, guzheng, electronics
Alan Sondheim, acoustic instruments

We have a new release, available now! The new cd has 24 pieces, 
including five songs with Azure Carter, and live Supercollider 
reverse reverberation (revrev) from Luke Damrosch. I play 19 
instruments, the musical structures are innovative and at times 
fast enough that speed itself becomes an essential component of 
the pieces. There are also slower pieces, pieces with Luke on 
madal and retuned guzheng, pieces with qin, and several double- 
recorded duets with myself (alto clarinet and clarinet for 
example). I try to reach the limits of my ability, breaking new 
ground when I can. The emotional range of the music is broad; 
the title indicates a sense of mourning, but the shorter 
discourses of the Buddha imply peace, planes of sound, fast and 
slow structures, enlightening. 

http://www.alansondheim.org/insideproof.jpg

From Jason Weiss (author of Steve Lacy: Conversations; Always in 
Trouble: An Oral History of ESP-Disk; Back in No Time: The Brion 
Gysin Reader, etc.)

"Who could have made such music? What was he thinking? Or 
rather, what were his fingers telling him with their ecstatic 
stuttering, their motormouth metalanguage?

"And do you call this music? It does not sound like noise. In 
its skittering, scampering, blurting of pure expression, it is 
alive, unmistakably alive. Like a creature we don't quite 
recognize, that moves by its own lights, that does not need our 
permission to exist, that finds or makes its own spaces and 
habitats.

"Music is always abstract, so it would seem a redundancy to 
think of this as abstract music. Of course, we do not consider 
songs abstract, nor familiar melodies or classical forms---even 
when we are aware that what seems familiar is really a matter of 
cultural habits and slowly developed norms (which are themselves 
constantly changing, naturally). This music, this splash of 
tonalities and textures, this breathing of illuminations in 
their flurries of flight, might well be an abstraction of the 
seemingly-non-abstract. Quickest glimpse of a melody from afar, 
so far that it must be foreign, though no less human for that; 
and so quick, so speeded up perhaps, that we do not know what we 
are hearing. The spine of a massive animal poking up through a 
surface we did not even realize was there.

"Alan Sondheim is a polymath, a restless connecter, explorer of 
virtual realms, tinkerer in the currency of questions, ever 
curious about impossible articulations of the body, of bodies, 
of dust and stars. Or what had seemed impossible. Luke Damrosch, 
meanwhile, tracks the flickering web of Alan's spells, catches 
their reflections, follows them through to their secret 
heartbeat. And Azure Carter? Azure assures him, ensures the 
voice within the music, soft anchor to a wild ear, filters the 
wind of vast expanses into a sigh, a melodic speaking, we are 
here, we were here, we may be somewhere else tomorrow."

The Exactitude of Strings for Amir Vahab


http://www.alansondheim.org/aud06.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/Amir.mp3

Solo cura saz. The instrument was set up and altered by
Amir Vahab, a brilliant musician, teacher, and repairer.
The cura is the smallest saz, which makes it necessary
for the tied-on fretting to be incredibly exact (at to a
less than millimeter tolerance). Because of his work, I
can play the cura without worry, moving quickly around
the neck; everything's in tune, unless I'm not of course,
and everything is perfect. Enjoy!

no-hole shakuhachi!


http://www.alansondheim.org/nohole.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/nohole.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/nohole1.mp3


today, Perry Yung visited us, and brought us two e-flat no-hole 
shakuhachi. this is, as it says, a shakuhachi flute with proper 
mouthpiece and internal coating, but without fingerholes. it's a 
wonderful and amazing gift! I had spoken to him about one 
earlier; I wanted to see what I could do with a tube, how my 
breathing would be affected, whether I could play it at all. I 
also wanted to use it for breathing and thinking breathing.

the instruments were made from bamboo bought locally at Job Lot; 
the interiors aren't smoothed, but similar to jinashi 
shakuhachis. very simple instruments with four bindings. the two 
use different bamboos; one has a wider bore and warmer tone, and 
the other is heavier, with a narrower bore. they make beautiful 
music, I think; reverberation has been added, that's all. these 
pieces are probably as close to enlightenment as I'll ever get!

the nohole.mp3 is on the wider bore instrument, which surprised 
me; the other is on the narrow bore. for listening, the first is 
probably more successful, but for playing, they both raised me 
off the floor.

(Perry made one for me and one for Azure; perhaps we can play 
duets!)

with immense gratitude to Perry!

Promissory

http://www.alansondheim.org/promissory.jpg

It's not as if there isn't a picture to lure you in; I might 
have made one from a screenshot of this very text, it would have 
been duplicated, letter by letter, you might have seen it as an 
echo or other resonant form; instead I'm at a loss, what sort of 
lure might work, for example something so strong that it would 
make you want to give up your home, your friends, your country, 
and go, and live in the desert, and kill people; this could be a 
promissory note that you would go to heaven or live eternally in 
a god's paradise, this very statement might do it for you, in, 
in the form of an image, of text, no other images are allowed, 
would you leave, then, now, would you wait, until the morning, 
what would you take, with you, do you know the journey, the 
danger, the morning, the evening, prayer, the prayer at midday, 
the people who would help you, those who would be a danger to 
you, those who would not help you, those who would trust you and 
those who would not, the desert awaits you, it reaches out, to 
you, with its heat, its thirst, its scorched lands, its tombs, 
to be destroyed, to be forgotten, it reaches out to you from 
town to town, market to market, cave to cave, people, waiting 
for you, with open arms, fearful of you, of your power, of your 
blade, your transmission, your signal, hordes, this is the 
promissory, the permission slip, the license, to leave, to 
worship, attain, to kill, to be killed, to attenuate, to come 
forth, to relieve, by night, by day, to withdraw, to cut 
through, to cut out, cut across, to carry, to be carried, to 
come, to arrive, to have arrived, to go, to be gone, to be gone
