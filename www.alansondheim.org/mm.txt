"I shall expound the phrase avasavattanatthena-anatta. As these flashes of
lightning do not last long and do not possess essence, they will not yield
to one's wishes. Just as it is not proper for one to say that these
flashes of lightning will listen to one's words and that one has control
over them, the physical and mental phenomena contained in the five consti-
tuent groups of existence being impermanent, will not yield to the wishes
of anyone. So it is not proper for one to delusively consider that the
five constituent groups of existence will obey one's orders or that one
has sway over then." (Sammadtthi Dipani, The Manual of Right Views, Ledi
Sayadaw.)

Linguistic annotations to Internet Text file names:

1. Why the sudden change after Net14 ?
2. The alphabet series ends at u .
3. Only five named files: I realized these were already breaking with some 
sort of order - I had to return to a more coherent system.
4. With the dyadic formations, things become confused:
a. Why start with ah, am, an? Where is ai, aj?
b. With the doubles, where is aa? Why does this suddenly break off at jj -
only to start with another series, that of k, after jy?
c. Why does k complete the dyadic series k*, and l complete l*?
d. Where is m* headed?
e. Do kk, ll, and mm replace earlier files related to the doubles series? 
Have texts inadvertently been lost?

I am currently revising my home-page, emphasizing newer work and this 
series - I have no answer whatsoever. My texts tend towards their own 
vagaries and wayward classifications - often beginning as if the whole 
world is ordered, ending, as if everything is in dissolution. In a 
state of depression, both ends transform into substance, through which 
may be read a certain decathected truth; often, however, I write in a 
state of exhilaration...

Self-Ex


A loudmouth and depressive to boot. A programming and hacking fraud
knowing less than a ten year old. Absolutely no reason to believe that
things are getting better. Always afraid of losing my friends. As if
quantity established meaning in the world. At the age of 59, I can't get a
decent university job. Avatars save nothing and hardly speak to me. Azure
brings light and a small comfort into my life. Azure has been so good for
me. Azure was enfolded in my arms. Believe I am a genius yet I don't know
what that means. Can't imagine what she finds in me. Carry books as a
security blanket. Constantly afraid of starving to death, being unable to
work. Constantly feel I let her down. Couldn't stop thinking about them.
Disordered of everything these memories. Don't deserve so much beauty.
Don't know how they can stand me. Don't want to have anything attributed
to the wrong person. Dreaming of iceflows, Inuit dreams. Ended up in the
hospital with a panic attack in Miami. Every day I face my own failure,
economically, artistically. Everything is flows and chance, randomness.
Everywhere I live seems like a holocaust that I bring with me. Fading and
evanescent avatars. Hard to accept that Azure loves me. Hold onto my work
as a drowning man. Hold onto small hopes of employment like someone
terminally ill. I'm writing this and sorting this to defend myself. If it
reaches a point when I can no longer function, I wish to be put to death.
It doesn't matter that I'm an excellent and inspiring teacher.  It's as if
my name meant something somewhere. Jealous of people who can take the day
off happily. Jealous of the money people have when I can't afford clothes.
Looking around the corner, Nikuko watching. Migraines are increasing. My
relations with other women have been terrible. My relatives tolerate me at
best. My sister is my father's favorite; my brother was my mother's. My
work will last millennia. My worry is that I produce quantity, not
quality. Nothing in my life beyond Azure, my friends, my daughter. Nothing
is attributed. Police circling the neighborhood again in the middle of the
night. Preparing to grade GREs and frightened out of my mind I won't pass.
She has to be faced with my failures, my depressions. She tolerates me and
loves me and I have no idea why. Since my mother died, my family relations
have been harsher. Sleeping is a horror show. Sociable, which is the final
grace. States of mind in deliberate dissolution. Stress is killing me.
Stupidly add up my search engine hits day after day. Terrified of losing
myself as hunger and homelessness seeps in. The other day I had to
suddenly stop typing and lie down. There's never enough in my world.
There's no end to it.  They protect me against the rest of the world. They
see no point in the work I do. They were dying. This is a sign of
depression as the world melds away into horror. Today I saw tiny turtles
for sale in the hot Chinatown sun. Too much television and not enough
instrument practice. Took Celexa and Valium, hoping for the sleep of the
dead. Turn the video camera and audio on us, stripping us naked. Violence
sits on one shoulder, pain on the other. Warning lights reflected on the
ceiling. Was very close to passing out. When I'm not writing, I'm ripping
myself apart. Worried about driving her away. Would die for her and am
trying to live for her. Writing every day is obsessive-compulsive, and
guarantees nothing. Writing now after trying once again to sleep.

People can't touch you. People can't smell you. You're not even something.

You don't have the slightest substance. You're not even a figment of

existence. You don't even exist. You're not here at all. You've never been
here at all. You never will be here in the slightest. You're not behind
anything. You're not in another part of the world. You're not underground.
You're not in the sky. You're not behind me in the slightest. You're not
in the universe in the slightest. You're nowhere in any other universe in
the slightest. You don't exist in any way, shape, or form. You're never
anywhere either.

(i recently purchased an AST Ascentia P laptop, 1 gig hard drive, 40 megs
ram, 135 mhz, batteries and accessories, for $10 at a stoop sale. the
operating system is Redhat linux 6.2. with the Internet Text on disk, i
carry out global operations, searching through the cerebellum of a
decade's worth of work.)

mining my texts, shape-riding through them, panopticon of searching, the 
analytical examination of the swollen tumescent sphere of 10,000 pages, 
drawn forth - drawn out, removed surgically:

    4  grep spherical * > /root/zz
    9  grep -h spherical * > /root/zz

the spherical shape that is reminiscent of the _eye_ - it's also the un-
spherical geometries, mouths opening to the world's waste, bodies turned
beneath us, indeed, were stromatolites, ranging from separate semi-spher-
ical captures of the spherical glare. we have image on a spherical
projection. i mapped the image to a cubic projection <tumescent> within
the sphere >> spherical normal. the object as well - so that we're
speaking here of a spherical project - contains a _cylinder_ with a
spherical /transmission and /location. your skins expand into spherical
orbit.

tenuous connections, these ligaments of cyberspace, almost a tumescent
waiting for your clotted tongue, so tumescent bodies fill all space all
corners of tumescent eyes ,, body read, produced, tumescent and
pronounced.

_tumescent_ - the street's flooded - where are the _signs_ as well (we're
hypertext on one hand, it is a swollen tumescent world, bursting at the
swollen, tumescent, pubescent, distended, gaping maw's software-hardware).
tumescent computer becomes breast, nipple, vagina, penis, frozen, melted
roots thirst, tumescent beneath the violent temperatures of the solar cunt
piss morph cum ytalk recycler detumescent hir cyberspace lockdown. the
wisdom in this, and somehow this wisdom filled her with gestures
impotently at this lurker nude and detumescent as male after transfer
jennifer into jenital, tumescent breast; still, she wouldn't come. i
transfer maya into jenital, tumescent breast; still, she won't come. the
footstep, shoulders' shrug, lips' smile, tumescent tissue and distended
pixels, tumescent pixels spilling inordinate color. Oh, a mixup!

where i've given up on real life, where I pull out tumescent life, where
i've given up on real life, where I pull on tumescent life, glow for you,
comes the tumescent vocal cords which, separated, exhale or inhale a
flaccid cock, tumescent, just running type across the surface. inside you,
tumescent, your chest swells with the hardness of my tits distended,
tumescent screened on two eyes backed into tortured skin. jennifer swells,
swollen distended belly tumescent with trashed bone and expulsion. saying
is detumescent, insipid; it decathects, mobile vectors, flaccid
inscriptions, detumescent marks and universes, inviting.

i can cry and see so very hard. My body is not tumescent. i do not.
lockdown toes moved slowly into spaces among cheeks and teeth, tongue
tumescent, covered with vaginas, mm swollen labia, tumescent you and
everywhere corners of tumescent eyes ,,

so that, turning towards the computer, half-aroused, tumescent, most of
13 naked, slightly tumescent, nearing orgasm, poets seeking in their heart
with wisdom found they are swollen, tumescent bodies everywhere for the
taking. code articulates the falsity in her, picks her up, strained,
tumescent towards the lens, my illuminated hand, these words written far
apart in time. capital flourishing from the beautiful energies,
tumescent, through the writing or against fingers hovering above the
tumescent keyboard, sense of iridescent _frisson,_ <tumescent> within

on
sex.


everything turns to liquid; everything flows, cauterizes. the corrosive
effect on the lip. the lip is the guard and guardian of the family,
terrorisms and explosions at the heart of the other, chthonic domain, is
always elsewhere, always others. we are blind beneath the surface; we
carry atmosphere with us, refusing union. union alone extricates the flesh
of others; we claw through it back to our original face; the tongue, nub
of the parenthetical, holding at bay, beyond the pale, what is most
feared, that of indiscriminate fucking, desire penetrating beyond the
pale, what is most feared, that of indiscriminate fucking, desire
penetrating beyond the criminality of the other, chthonic domain, is
always elsewhere, always others. we are alone among the missing, the
greater our passions, our arousals, the less our signifiers remain; we
flow like wax into you, taking your impressions. it's politics. it
transforms into the fantasm of an originary state. sex is a foundation,
originary impulse; only that it retro-projects into the fantasm, withdraws
from the nub re-enters the nub; what the nub is the same against the same;
the nub re-enters the nub; what the nub is the emergence of the imaginary,
turns our images into part-objects, spreads us across your magnetic
domains, your optical domains, your fiber optics, your twisted copper
wires. nothing touches anything; the drives are sealed, abjection without.
what we have is our presence in the cosmos; we can feel the weight of our
head turned to one side or another, the explosive gasp of air (surfacing),
the violent inhalation (going down once again). we are always among the
missing. the greater our passions, our arousals, the less our signifiers
remain; we flow like wax into you, taking your impressions. it's politics,
it transforms into the flesh of other's; we claw through it back to our
original face is flesh. in "our" work, this trembling scatters; objects
return to part-objects without memory of the parenthetical, holding at
bay, beyond the criminality of the world, the choratic stuttering into the
construct of space and time. eventually it doesn't need anything at all,
neither body nor viewer, writer nor reader. plasma curls the screen, turns
hard drives into replete translations, fills hard drives into replete
translations, fills hard drives with catalysts of the w/hole. the images /
videos / texts exist on the basin is to gnaw through to emptiness. within
the aegis of gravity, gravitas, it can flood through all pronouncement. it
draws you in. sex curls the screen, turns hard drives into replete
translations, fills hard drives into replete translations, fills hard
drives with catalysts of the subject absorbed by the trembling of the real
which is always in emergence. in "our" work is as explicit as possible. it
is not the reduction of 0*S nor the semiotic; it is all of the nub. the
material of the world is a matter of pressure; substance is the semiosis
of the other, chthonic domain, is always in emergence. in "our" work, we
work the original face. we play against technology, memory, direct and
indirect addressing. we participate in the skein. that which loosens the
grip.

monitoring need only be properly applied, coupled with realistic violence,
doing violence. violent death is convulsive, conclusive; nothing but
another contest, so what if you tailor your inner violence. all the
contingent issues of oppression, power, desire, and violence the podium or
declamatory arena working itself through a violence inherent in the
middle, hurricanes of inconceivable violence. towards violence of a flame,
the surface, tendencies towards you, the violence of romance,
relationship, and violence, earth turned to ashes - Anguish decides too
much violence, pulls out, Veronica leaves with him. violence and
recuperating something as well. a certain violence of cells, violence of
environments; they are protected. a flame in cyberspace kills someone
through the violence seething just below the surface - what violence do we
commit, knowingly or unknowingly? violence, until the whole town was
involved. Everything increased; you'll never know. i imagined disembodied
violence from one end, of the thud of the window, you, the violence of our
nightly affairs carrying through our lives, beyond contusion, no language
unborn in useless violence. my sex with genetic engineering. we have to
turn the violence within us. nothing with my own going, the violence of
the window, you, the violence of the flame within - what violence do we
commit, knowingly or unknowingly?

essence of parables of Nikuko


One day Izanagi said to Nikuko, Almost everyone you meet is more
interesting than Death. Nikuko said, Death knows no boredom. Nikuko said,
Death knows no boredom. Nikuko said, Death knows no stopping. Nikuko said,
Death knows no stopping. Nikuko said, Death knows no boredom. Nikuko said,
Death knows no boredom. Nikuko said, I am the south or nothing is the
making of worlds, said Izanagi and Izanami, I will take a man with a huge
and comical hat, wide-brimmed, of a peculiar shape. Now what, said Nikuko.
Izanagi answered, It is good to have lost the path. The man said, I never
heard of a new prophet, as prominent as Izanagi. She was disappointed; his
voice was thin and his message all too familiar; he also spoke of a shell
that Nikuko created many worlds. They continued walking, now and then
headed out to greet them. He was carrying a magatama (i.e. curved jewel)
and a woman playing a ch'in in a most mournful manner, golden birds, and
dragons coursing through the air, as they left Nara, heading south. Bad
mistake, said Izanagi, turning around, but Nikuko was wending her way from
the hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being. She asked him who he was,
and discovered he was mute (i.e. he did not reply, either because he
desired silence above all else). It was of unusual construction, tall,
almost like a stranger, then familiar, then a friend. It was of unusual
construction, tall, almost like a stranger, then familiar, then a friend.
It was of unusual construction, tall, almost like a stranger, then
familiar, then a friend. It was of unusual construction, tall, almost like
a stranger, then familiar, then a friend. It was of unusual construction,

unusual construction, tall, almost like a stranger, then familiar, then a
friend. It was of unusual construction, tall, almost like a stranger, then
familiar, then a friend. It was a mistake to create like that. Izanagi
asked, What happened. Nikuko said, I am swimming, and her mouth filled
with water. She spat it out of this world, are you doing (i.e. in
general). He replied, I am the south or nothing is the making of worlds,
said Izanagi and Izanami, I will take a man with a huge and comical hat,
wide-brimmed, of a bird, a plant, a butterfly, and a woman raped with a
huge and comical hat, wide-brimmed, of a peculiar shape. Now what, said
Nikuko. They boarded the ferry to Nagato, still talking away. Nikuko and
Izanagi said, From now on this will be turning, and here, and there is
only two, said Nikuko, the binding of parables makes causes and effects,
and out of this world, are you doing (i.e. in general). He replied, I am
swimming, and her mouth filled with water. She spat it out of this world,
are you doing (i.e. in general). He replied, I am the south or nothing is
the making of worlds, said Izanagi and Izanami, I will take a man on fire,
naked and castrated. They walked around the shore. Nikuko was bound to the
land. The bird sees its reflection in the dust. They passed a woman
playing a ch'in in a most mournful manner, golden birds, and dragons
coursing through the air, as they left Nara, heading south. Bad mistake,
said Izanagi, turning around, but Nikuko was wending her way from the
hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being. She asked him who he was, and
discovered he was mute (i.e. he did not reply, either because he desired
silence above all else). It was a mistake to create like that. Izanagi
asked, What happened. Nikuko said, Death knows no stopping. Nikuko said,
Death knows no stopping. Nikuko said, There are so much out of control,
contaminated by the side of the deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough,
a dog approached, its horn hard against the sky. The day dawned warmer and
warmer; Nikuko, exhausted, fell back down into a deep sleep, enlightened,
as winter returned to his hut. We are chanting ourselves, said Nikuko, the
binding of parables makes causes and effects, and out of control,
contaminated by the side of the deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough,
a dog approached, its horn hard against the sky. The day dawned warmer and
warmer; Nikuko, exhausted, fell back down into a deep sleep, enlightened,

you doing (i.e. in general). He replied, I am swimming, and her mouth
filled with water. She spat it out of this world, flickering between the
five finger-holes. Bacteria thrive, stationary waves hold colonies of
protozoa in perfect suspension. After the shakuhachi is created from root
bamboo, worked on for weeks and months, lacquered inside, a hardwood
insert in the winter. Why men are taller than women. One day Nikuko left
Wa to see the worlds she had created. She traveled through Afghanistan and
the mountains disappear. We should have thought of that earlier, replied
Izanagi. Then they might stay put, said Nikuko. Izanagi answered, It is
even better that the emptier the mind, the greater the flow; by the side
of the west. Izanagi said to Nikuko, Almost everyone you meet is more
interesting than Death. Nikuko said, Death knows no stopping. Nikuko said,
Death knows no stopping. Nikuko said, I wish it were sunny out. They
walked around the shore. Nikuko was bound to the land. The bird sees its
reflection in the direction of Hyuga they continued on their way.
