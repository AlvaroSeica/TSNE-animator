[14:49] Julu Twine: i'm not sleeping i'm awake in mourning
[14:50] Julu Twine: not body parts in space, particles
[14:54] Alan Dojoji: a deathmask i sdancing and a hanged man is hanging
[14:54] Julu Twine: deathmask of particles and hanging from strings
[14:55] Alan Dojoji: the purple legs of a dangling dancer, hanged
[14:56] Julu Twine: flooding the world, exasperated for organism
[14:56] Alan Dojoji: a thin mask, suspended insoluble
[14:57] Julu Twine: falling and cluttered among themselves...
[14:57] Alan Dojoji: clinging, clattering, clanging, dangling
[14:58] Julu Twine: fluttered, the body hugs the body, caressing itself
[14:58] Alan Dojoji: your words knock mine askew, i forget my bearings
[14:59] Julu Twine: the world is always fallen
[14:59] Alan Dojoji: i had a mind to... never mind, the thought has 
drifted and hangs motionless
[15:00] Julu Twine: mind drifts from mind, drifts from body, thought 
coagulates
[15:00] Alan Dojoji: so hard to hold on, hold on
[15:01] Julu Twine: thought clusters
[15:01] Alan Dojoji: now the sphere comes into view, but obscurely
[15:01] Julu Twine: and night falls in the dark kingdom...

[15:06] Julu Twine: THICK. THE NIGHT. ANGELS.
[15:07] Alan Dojoji: the light is falling across his motionless legs
[15:07] Julu Twine: STARS BURN EYES: SILENCING THE DARK
[15:08] Alan Dojoji: her head is upside down in the heavy darkness
[15:08] Julu Twine: INERT: HE IS HER THUD
[15:08] Alan Dojoji: i wander among a torrent of body parts
[15:09] Julu Twine: BELONGED
[15:09] Alan Dojoji: he drifts on a raft of human bones
[15:09] Julu Twine: TRAVESTY < LENGTHWISE < PARALLEL FLESH
[15:10] Alan Dojoji: she sits on the stoop in twilight zones
[15:10] Julu Twine: HE STOOPS. IS HER LADDER. STONE.
[15:11] Alan Dojoji: her skull peculiarly elongated, her funny moans
[15:11] Julu Twine: HIS MOANS.
[15:12] Alan Dojoji: she tunes in vaguely to his static stooping
[15:12] Julu Twine: NO RESPONSE. GRANITE. THICK.
[15:13] Alan Dojoji: something drifts through the slats of the stoop and 
the raft, affect?
[15:13] Julu Twine: THIRD STAIR FROM THE BOTTOM. IS HIM.
[15:13] Alan Dojoji: a sluggish rhythm, his tithe to her
[15:14] Julu Twine: HIS THICKNESS. FURROWED. TRAPPED THOUGHT.
[15:14] Alan Dojoji: a cleft, a ravine, she is a window resting on a 
shattered pane
[15:14] Julu Twine: HE SHATTERS.
[15:15] Alan Dojoji: she offers no safe haven, he's adrift
[15:15] Julu Twine: HE SHATTERS.
[15:16] Alan Dojoji: she is migratory, mutable, reflective
[15:16] Julu Twine: HE SHATTERS. THICK. HE SHATTERS.

Humo kupliaku natho humo tokiyo /now the eagle is made now 

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons, says N
it's like an eagle in the sky,
o knot of soldiers, I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons,

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons

i released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons, says N, people. i am 
an eagle and i am powerful and fly higher than any other or no people. i 
am not an eagle and i am not powerful and fly higher. what's that eagle 
going to do? he's going to fly, him. but you put a falcon nor osprey, 
eagle or mountebank crow, not the hurricane or the eagle which is the 
harbinger of truth, /* but an eagle on the peak */, not the hurricane or 
the eagle which is the harbinger of truth, /* but like an eagle on the 
peak */

four small songs of death 

harbor 1,2,3,4 four small songs of death and coming to grace unto death
and of that coming to grace, meandering and grasping still and hovering
among deaths and holdings on and releasings,
recapitulation, of the first three small songs of death, before the fourth
of which there is no recapitulation or releasing, no holding on, descent
among them all, of their descent, and of their desire to die, desire
among them

Clarksberg

as if it were Clarksberg 1942.
as if there were a large 'oriental' population in Clarksberg.
as if they were a 'swarthy' hebrew-speaking 'race.'
as if they played the 'sad mournful melodies of their people.'
as if there were a wire recorder and an eager collector.
as if he asked my father to demonstrate his 'unusual instrument.'
as if my father obliged.
as if he always obliged.
as if he sat on the edge of the cabin porch.
as if he leaned forward and tuned his 'unusual instrument.'
as if he began to play.
as if the wind picked up.
as if he played the 'eerie minor keys of his people.'
as if he played the 'ancient tunes' remembered 'from his childhood.'
as if he looked sad and thoughtful.
as if he'd stop now and then and listen to the wind.
as if you were in Clarksberg 1942.
as if you listened in the wind.

azure: 'death is a symptom not a disease.'

tonight i think: romanticism is a disease of death, not its symptom. my 
thoughts crawl like maggots cleansing the brain of life. i release them, 
they release themselves, don't go there. what descends is the violence and 
fury of decay, the curtain that ceases on details, enlarges them until 
memory collapses under the weight of futility. at the bottom of the social 
lies the ash-heap, festering for a limited time at best. every statement 
at heart desires life, protocol, exactitude, as if something were 
accomplished, the world hammered back into shape. the secret of writing, 
every statement mauls itself. i am a sensitive. i cannot forbear this as 
human condition's nuance. but forbearance is swept away as well. this is 
both the same old story and the only one. social networks collapse, it's 
not one's life that fleshes before one's eyes, but the diminution, hacking 
away, of the social. nothing is left but the flash which exits with a 
thud. it's the failure of philosophy not to undermine itself this way, no 
matter how weak, weak theory appears, no matter how many subjunctives, 
it's gone before it arrives, nothing can revive it. already deconstruction 
deconstructs nothing, becomes a distraught capsule of its own unraveling. 
the existentialist project is its own formal reversal, phenomenology 
talking the red patch or the computer screen's dull eye. every example is 
a confounded, entangled, others. ours is a species listing to one side, 
close to the breaking-point, intent on closure with insufficient time, 
what crawls on my brain, what fleshes, crawls on yours as well, worlds 
enough, unkempt detail, peripheral coagulations resisting the logical 
light of day. the world goes away before it arrives, the world has gone 
away before it arrived. it announces nothing and our anthropomorphic vault 
has already crashed. death is a symptom of the omen of death, every set is 
open, already foreclosed. what crawls in my mind will kill my sanity, the 
presumption is that the rest of us have more than enough to spare. the 
sane are masquerades, the insane cannot lift a stone verb. in between, 
mobsters appear, what's left is the spoils. nothing moves as feynmann 
diagrams shudder indefinitely, spoils seethe. unwatched, we're gone, 
carelessly it moves.

twilight,

a suite of melodies, pipa and alpine bass zither
reconstituting selves on a bleak day when i realized
i can't afford a hospital, so we march on in out country
of disunity, our country of rabid humans, destroyers
and purifiers, i remain in my seat in my window
in my house, to be destroyed, i remain and play
the last lost music of our destroying century,
remnants of the twilight of enjoyment, the twilight of oranges,
the twilight of wonderful flowers, 
the twilight of glistening eyes of animals and flight,
the twilight of remains murmuring in the destroying wind,
the twilight of dawn, dawn of twilight frozen,
holding the twilight in abeyance, reconstituting kaons,
we've (never) been here before

clusters)

* Regeneration

A beam of neutral kaons decays in flight so that the short-lived KS 
disappears, leaving a beam of pure long-lived KL. If this beam is shot 
into matter, then the K0 and its antiparticle _K0 interact differently 
with the nuclei. The K0 undergoes quasi-elastic scattering with nucleons, 
whereas its antiparticle can create hyperons. Due to the different 
interactions of the two components, quantum coherence between the two 
particles is lost. The emerging beam then contains different linear 
superpositions of the K0 and _K0. Such a superposition is a mixture of KL 
and KS; the KS is regenerated by passing a neutral kaon beam through 
matter. Regeneration was observed by Oreste Piccioni and his collaborators 
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Soon thereafter, Robert Adair 
and his coworkers reported excess KS regeneration, thus opening a new 
chapter in this history. [ I'm not thinking of an analogy or model, only 
of forms emergence and recapitulation, processes whereby phenomenologies 
of mind might find parallels. ]

(Fau Ferdinand, Julu Twine)



The image of an angel is an angel.


The image of an angel is an angel. (Amy in Doctor Who)

nujulu imagining from OpenSim, various locations.
the image is always in negotiation with the software.
The image of an angel is an angel.
The image of Julu is Julu.
Think of this as _ikonicity doubled_ which is inherent in the virtual.
Why haven't we thought of this before?
The indexicality of the image folds in on itself, transforming into the 
virtual materiality of the representation; think of this as a resonant 
object whose reality is its virtual materiality, the virtual materiality 
of the fold.
The Baroque fold is always accompanied by _mirrors._
Nothing is realized; reality is simultaneously represented, held in 
abeyance, presenced, present, an inverted subjunctive.
or something is always _a-miss._
( think of cosmology's holographic model of the universe; think of an 
obdurate ontology of information; think of the genidentity of information; 
think of information _all the way down_ (of culture _all the way down_) 
(of cultural formations), you're on the right track, you're almost there. 
or something is always _a-miss._ )

hermes as alan dojoji transforms into hermaphrodite
after melding among julu twine objects dojoji first
appeared as female in open sim; i kept the female 
'skin' which now covers a male body. hir movements
are also 'male' as far as open sim is concerned.
the first part of the video is twine in dance
among a thick set of objects, as if in preparation
for dojoji's transformation.

http://www.alansondheim.org/reflection.mp4
the image of an angel is an angel: julu twine's 
wing-objects reflected in open sim's water.
from the viewpoint of julu, her body doesn't exist;
however the water carries the charge of the body.
this is the opposite of vampirism, where the body
appears in 'reality' but isn't reflected.
what are the consequences of this ontology?

(below) here are detailed film stills; the first
group of images present twine with her wing-objects
and thick set of external objects and emissions,
and the last two are closeup images of alan dojoji 
among them.

5 shaman songs 4 helena


viola 1-3, violin 4-5, repetitive structures, breathing, bass grounding,
what started me in this direction, listening, incapable of figure,
magatama, ecstatic ground towards earth, 1 came this afternoon, from on
high, yes, 2 emerged from 1 glissando, 3 from 1 on high, 4 from awakening,
5 from 1 on high, doubled figure, 1,2,3,4,5 through fugue state, through
static real, through world music ruins, through field practices and
theories, through nice day when the way of the pipa book arrived

Alan Dojoji Pushes Fau Ferdinand in the Water because She's not Paying Him 
any ATTENTION!

so the story will be about I'm trying DESPERATELY TO GET YOUR ATTENTION,
but you're ignoring me because you're away or sleeping or not watching the
terrific goings-on in OpenSim so I sneak up on you (because you're not
looking) and push you into the water which is very difficult because
pushing avatars requires the greatest skill, making sure that the pusher
is right behind the pushee, otherwise the pushee escapes, so you're pushed
into the water and just as you're falling you wake up and type "UOY" which
can only mean it's a backwards world, and then we're both in the water and
I'm dancing furiously and AGAIN YOU'RE PAYING NO ATTENTION!

the shaman

or the body of the shaman, and the shaman is androgynous,
substance. that object cures; you are a curing shaman, mediating the
speech, song, ownerships, shamanic practices, ours is the life,
devouring is a decathexis returned to our fetishistic/shamanic
pill or secrecy of the fetish-object. which means that this has 
gathered within the shamanistic fetish for the expulsion of male,
kill all priest. worry lama. hunt rabbi. kill shaman. kill all grand
shamans, of s shaman, a appealing t to t the s spirit o of s swan.
surely the result is a form of prosthetic shamanism, the fetish 
draws us within the museum of interiority. 
the elder shamanic ascent and descent, recognition of alterity, altered
spaces of dreams, shamanic spaces, 
runways laid out in shamanic configuration, 
oh my sisther told me she was a vary big shaman
oh my mother told me she was a vary big shaman

the gestures are those of the mad shaman conjuring or producing spirit.
for this interweaving - at least in a world where shamanisms are suspect,
we are cyber-shamanisms, we extend the body into blank spaces behind the 
perfect power and cleanliness, empathy, we learn
the sacred paths of prostitution and shamanism. you are our fantasy,
yes, we must first learn the knowledge of prostitution and shamanism.

i will not be a shaman. i do not have the training to be a shaman. i will
from home of home. i do not have the knowledge to be a shaman. i do not
i will not stand on sky-pole of arctic sickness, 
not being a shaman: topology order zero.
not being a shaman cross-the-bridge: topology order one.
not being a shaman cross-the-bridge: topology order zero.
i become shaman, unknown, 
our pottery is covered with intricate designs. our shamans
kill all priest. worry lama. hunt rabbi. kill shamans. kill all grand
shamans then i die shaman then i die oh oh you can tell oh oh
 o of s shaman, a appealing t to t the s spirit o of s swan.

o shaman, what speaks through the shaman, through the materiality of the
shaman in order to speak of the other that is human? 
gathering within the shamanistic fetish for the expulsion of males,
good, the battle of the shamans and the warriors - the warriors 
fighting forever, the shamans healing the warriors -

now there's a skeleton behind the shaman and the shaman is controlling the 
skeleton or the skeleton the shaman because they
gathered within the fetish, i have told you.

[12:05]  you: ghost-traps? i think come into play; shamanism is 
chthonic ritual, abjection, the power-holder doll, who brings the power?
i am a shaman without redemption or belief,
i promulgate the notion of veracity or shamanism, and even animal 
movements.
we are cyber-shamanisms, we extend the body into blank spaces behind the 
         double of the body of the shaman, and the shaman
           curing shaman, mediating the real, 
            nothing spiritual here,
o tiger-riding shaman several centuries old
shamanistic passage, but the secrecy of individual power and shame, the
shaman in order to speak of the other that is human? 
fighting forever, the shamans healing the warriors,
fighting forever, healing.
