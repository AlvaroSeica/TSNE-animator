3 protocols' commentaries


1 well this protocol drives everything. it's not a protocol, it's an 
association or mapping, it's a drive or production-number, it's a 
correspondence, it's built into the matrix of the inchoate, it's 
unintended, it's untended - [phenomenology of approach, the world]
membrane.mov or something that 'reflects' - in the antiquated diamat sense 
- the running and rummaging of the idiotic real -

2 well this protocol carries the codes, this protocol carries the message, 
this protocol is unintended, it's tended, it's maintained, someone 
maintains it, someone keeps it running, someone sends the message, someone 
hears it - [phenomenology of the world, the carrier, the interpretation, 
the interpretation of the carrier, the assignation] - there's mime.mov and 
mum.mov and think of the body as the carrier/transmission - the making of 
the cinematic of the mime - 

3 well this protocol's assigned on the run, this is the meaning-generator,
meaning-production, this assigns boundaries and bindings, this creates
language and negations, this runs it through - there's dirt inhabiting
this one, there's the noise in the machine, there's the interpretations,
the abjections, the sado-masochisms, the ideologies, histories - it's all
in this protocol - [phenomenology of approach, the complicit, the
seduction, the accompaniment, the comprehension, the deconstruction] ===
this is the parasitic protocol, the dirty little secret in the midst of
the corporate === well, here's the seals film among others - all these 
cinematic ploys heading towards sexuality, exposure, restraint, composure 
- you can already see what a mess is being created, that there's no way in 
or through this stuff, it's too tangled, too much of a thicket, go back 
and go way back to the books - 

idiot, you're saying there's nothing more than a range of coding, some of 
it found and reported as such, witnessed, for better or worse, from the 
world-at-large, and some of it human-created, and some of it created and 
loose/ned upon the landscape. idiot, you're saying that the variety of 
protocols make some sort of difference. is it that you're trying to 
release your dirty little secret, whatever and wherever that is, within 
theory in order to create a minor masterpiece of therapeutic?

it won't hold, the classification is useless and leaky. no matter how much 
you through around the cant word 'parasite,' nothing changes; if anything, 
you're parasitic on the theory itself. you go nowhere, it goes nowhere.

the phenomenology of approach essay, once you finally got that finished, 
was a good thing; it was perfect, it allowed for some sort of advance. and 
so one can see how codes play into that, structures that are grounded in 
or submerged within or emerged without - the appropriated or created or 
discovered domain - however you want to read it. and of course codes don't 
exist in a vacuum, the morse code for example, is of a certain pitch with 
a specific transmission (no more, alas, replaced by further digital commu- 
nications), and a certain length for dot and dash, and a certain voltage 
and at a machine- or human- readable speed and machine- or human- writable 
speed - and all of this constitutes the _protocol_ of the transmission of 
the code, the protocol which is tended and let loose, the structure of the 
communications channel itself. and then of course there might be an infin- 
ite regress here, you're not sure, it just seems likely. 

idiot, there's no regress, but code and protocol don't necessary merge,
and you're making STANDARDS and PROTOCOLS and CODES somehow equivalent,
and you're getting lost as usual in a blind fix of your own doing, and you 
can't escape, you can never escape - and now you're far too tired to do 
anything but whine...

The presentation talk at COCH-COSH, Toronto, today. The text is below.


[During the presentation I became increasingly ill. I developed, it turns 
out, a fever around 102, vomiting, a migraine, chills, and half a dozen 
other symptom. I returned back to my sister's house immediately.]

[What was shown: mime.mov, mum.mov, seals.mov, a couple of the asteroids, 
everglades.mov, path2.mov.]


i'm trying to deal with silence, problematic language, "messy" language - 
for example - what constitutes a word in mime? i'm not quite sure...

this is going to be a mess - 

thinking about mime - what constitutes a word? for one thing these are 
continuous actions of the body, hehe, whatever =-
tghe juxtaposition of b odies and a text you REALLY have to follow does 
create a split or a mess here - 
Not sure - I was thinking recently about protocols - 
writing into them - what happens, I mean - think of PROTOCOLS as code - 
suites of codes - protrocol suites =- then what do you have?

so that there's no break - it's like CXhristian Metz was writing sabout 
film back there =- then - that the languaghe of film is problemaytic - 
where's the breakdown into language, code, word, phonem,e, blahblah - the 
blahblah from Heiner Muller - who doesn't worr y about thes things. so 
anyway
well, this is an early attempt below - it sounds good - if I used the 
words "representation" and the "subject" it would pass for academic - but 
it seemed to be an error - 
codework - for me - implies a tension between what might pass for surface 
content, and what might pass for: 
a. the substructural matrix (presentation format)
b. the sustaining protocols (email, ascii code, etc.)
c. the generating protocols (programming)
d. interacting protocols (html, programming)
- all of these are of course PROBLEMATIC in relation
to one another (good word here) - please continue reading up above on the 
upper right - Azure (left) was just smokinjg a cigarette - anyway -


or: this is more like it - thinking of 'tending' or even 'ending' - 
unintended codes - DNA running within the real - yes, well the natural is 
problematic of course and also tended, but DNA has done well without our 
interference for at least a billion or so years if you include RNA 
sequences
tended codes - TCP/IP with the sysadmin - now this needs IMMEDIATEW 
attention - tending a code or protocol suite which runs on its own - a lot 
of codework
such as mine - does interfere with things on this level, then there are 
the older coddes - Umberto Eco writing on
intended codes 1. - MORSE code for example - in its relation to spoken 
language
god, the film's already half over and I still haven't started the stuff 
from the Everglades - ok, hold on - 
these are from
we got started, thinking of the MESS or entanglement in the Everglades 
ecosystems - we kept going out there and getting bit by mosquitos and 
deer-flies - as a sideline I want to have some deerflies in our apartment 
as pets - anyway -
intended codes 2. - "messy" TAXONOMIES -
  the PHENOMENOLOGY OF APPROACH:
  to the EVERGLADES or the THICKET -
 the MESSY: Sexuality, Natural Language, Body
the messiness of the glades ecosystem is only a masquerade of course - 
just likie thye messiness of everyday life - it self/organizes just like 
anything else (if you've seen Wolfram's recent book A New Kind of Science 
this relates - 
so we're doing what's called a slough slog at the moment - chomping 
through the water and pierphyoton - but on 

you can see the bumpiness of the path on the right - down towards 
christian point - against the drive to the university in miami, drunkard's 
walk literally against the vectoring of zoning and develolpment in western 
miami - there's a LOT to be said
{against that - 
so -
there are these protocols - and the last, the morse, but also the 
intended, beyond the morse - readingthe landscape, the the the - reading 
the landscape, the taxonomies one finds/creates, etc. - 
there are issues about leakage, sexuality and the body, all these terms 
also from feminin ecriture, Irigaray, I hate to keep quoting people here 
or thinking about these other manifestations occupying my mind - but 
anyway - from Michel Serres' notion of the Parasite and extending this 
into hacking and internet works -

the parasite interferes with everything; interferes with and constructs 
the codes - so I'm interested in BROKEN codes, transformed codes, codes 
which resist me, through which I'm tryig to say something - on the upper 
write, writing on the body, on the upper write, erasing the body 
one/against/another - leaving an uncomfortable trace - no matter
no matter what
therre's no MATTER in protocols - Leinin had a problem with that, well 
diamat did anyway, developed something called the reflection theory in the 
old USSR to take care of issues dealing with what wee're now calling the 
VIRTUAL - 
but that's far away - so with the b roken codes, and the mess, and 
everything in=-between - trying to find away AROUND hypertest and the 
clean linearity of most html pages, URLs, etc.
because the world branches and isn't cartesian in THAT WAY but just try 
and make for example a full webpage do a five degreee tilt on your browser 
like you hang a painting sfrom a nail and it slips just like that
it's almost impossible to make a SLIP of that sort in URL/hypertext 
blahblahblah 
of course you do the same thing one way or another with flash, but then 
that's flash, preprogrammed

I mean the slip, SLIP, the fake, the parasitic, the unforeseen (NOT 
programmed randomness, which I personjally have little interest in, I mean 
we all devcelop - develop - these tiny little worlds...

so I'll leave the sound run, here's an asteroid, mappying the body messily 
into space, we'll see - 

tghat's it - that's the body - we're traveling around it, through it, 
distorting it, it's a spaceship, it's virtual, or was -0 now it's a 
dead-end file - that's all there is too it =- 

now on the left we're erasing each other, erasing the marks/demarcataions

oh I DID forget to mention the sound is triggering the cameras - not that 
that matters to anyone - there are five cameras, and the sound shifts them 
directly - one against another, one in relation to another, now here are 
some texts I think - the kind of thing I'm interested in against the grain 
of legibility or protocol - Marjory might as well be Marjory Perloff but I 
think it's really in relation to my sister who sometimes, but not always, 
frighttens me; I have a feelig she types faster and more accurately - 

sorry - tat thing was too poetic for my own good - yours tgoo - here's a 
modem log having a bit of trouble connecting - you can see the TENDED 
protocols not getting anywhere and then there's the writing on top of it - 
all of it - moving through these =

they're two mathematical formulations - on the right, a code-structure 
developed and then applied in the program - on the left, the function 
formed out of a duplication of human nipples subtended by tangent vectors 
and combinations...

so there's no conclusion to any of this - that much is obvious. i'm in hte 
midst of writing abou tht ephenomenology of approach (which comes into 
play when ytou come towards anything or vice versa) as well as thinking 
through codes and protocols in relation to the body/flesh and messiness, 
Kristevan abjection for example, without elimination - or precisely WITH 
elimination, one might say, a pile of shit -

before 60 hrs.


yesterday i began with a public presentation, my hands danced on the keys,
the images got away from me, one/two/many, i'd forget, bring back another
language-particle, another phrase or phase, the letters were falling down
the screen, what did i mean, i'd forget, dealing with protocols and codes,
hardly producing odes, it was the thought of the collapse of thought at
thought's collapse, it was taking me down with it, later everything left
me, my body sprang at nourishment, everything leaving beserk from the
collapsed ship, i've lost seven pounds, i've never been to norwalk
-:worlds-creating, unknown territories, hands that don't work, rivers of
sweat, black vomit, a nile of bile i bet beserk, i'm polluted, my mind
thinks of ONLY CLEAN THINGS, unknown territories of the body tube, i'm
centrifugal, everything exits, leaves the collapsed ship, sails
water-logged, every moment lost, i realized i am writing this with half a
mind going into withdrawal of all thought and loss of appetite -:the body
tube opens everywhere, i'm writing this beneath its sign, it's hardly
mine, it hands, drools, leaks for the mind, it drags the mind down, it's
norwalk virus, it's norwalk-like virus, i'm losing weight, five or six
pounds already, i'm hardly steady, i can't walk well, my body's hell, i'd
say, take my body away today and stay away, my mind resists shrieking,
that is it wants to hold on to the tethers in all weathers, i know when
i'll die it will be somewhere else - that's the i that is an other, the i
that brings it down -::osprey dissolution//red-winged-blackbird in They
contain a positive strand RNA genome of 7.5 kb and a single structural
protein of about 60 kDa. The 27-32 nm viral particles have a buoyant
density of 1.39-1.40 g/ml in CsCl. They murmured my name. They invaded my
holes. They lubricated my holes. They hollowed me out. They consumed me.
They invaded my brain. I know everything about protocols. I can't write a
thing.

cats, traffic, poisons in the very air they breathe, decayed and limited
food supplies - they die ground into the pavement. as with pigeons, rock
doves, swallows, they know of none other, encompassed by too limited a
span for migration in these areas or even incipient culture. not enough
time for deer to outgrow their suicidal behavior by road-sides, woodchucks
as well. robins tend simultaneously to approach and keep away, inherited
behavior of course from somewhere else that gives them half a chance.
squirrels learn bright scavenge, say alive through reproduction. the lone
blue heron most likely starved, unable to penetrate pond-ice, penetrated
by cold. the cats make it to the curb, then slaughter; perhaps one kitten
gets out of the litter unless rescued by humans. subway mice can't live
more than a year; grease, tars, and other toxins, including pcbs, are
rampant. brown rats have greater longevity if they avoid whatever is
leftover, including traps, parasites, poisons, traffic, cats, illnesses,
flooding and fire. pairs of breeding falcons might make it. seagulls come
and go, back to the filth of the polluted harbor. swill harbors infection.

possible futures, remove it from the virtual. i beg you: make my work
real::the heat of the near-future melting wires amidst nuclear explosions,
suicide bombers, storms and lightnings, the destructions of languages and
bodies, desert ecologies rampant down to barren aa melt. humans control
humans; chemical catastrophe at the top down through radiations blinding
and charring animals. sun and moon topple with damaged eyes. viral
particles fly apart; bacteria shudder above ground. all is well in the
cracked subterranean rock strata; dull life moves on as the surface rains
down.:yes, the end of the world in every way, shape, and form: every
ideology, object, and structure. it will come imminent and immanent. of
virtuality let it be said, nothing shall survive. incandescent rock and
earth, lavas and obsidians of forgetting, shall glance across barren
plains, uttering their own inscriptive tallies in the violent suns and
nuclear winters. prepare, prepare. save my work, my texts and images, my
video and sound, above all: download, download, before it is too late.::

mine, your eyes, shall see my own in fright, the dying of the light, she
said: your body there is spread, this is all a dream, alone except the
ream, blood ran down their legs, violate, she begs: violate, he begs,
they're down into the lake, their screams are but a fake, within the
double hash, within their double gash.:she turned into her skin, she said:
everything's within, look into the sky, the world's turned on a cry, the
bird's are screaming there, she said: you start your reaming bare, you've
always been betrayed, the trees are thick around, she said: nothing makes
a sound, nothing in these parts, forget their broken hearts, he's cut into
your skin, inscribed the sign within, she said: there's everlasting scar,
and that is where you are, she said: turn and cut his flesh, make
everything a crash, cut deeper than a lash, ream her in the gash, she
said: in the theory of medieval sound, you are thrown upon the ground,
there are only things, now gather all your things, she said: the trees
with echo sing, you've always been betrayed.:things caught down in the
mesh, stretch and open your raw flesh, in the theory of medieval eyes,
you are wanton in disguise, within the double hash, light penetrates the
glade, everything will crash, everything is made: she said: just a tiny
little gash, haven't you been flayed: she said: the world is in your
stash, you've always been betrayed.:: the partial third emerges, they're

Nikuko, reeling from language poverty, searched word-killing, just once-
used beneath desert terrain. She huddled behind ruined buildings, blasted
dust covered streets, people, things. Astounded woman telephoned Jennifer;
J. replied inconceivable chaos everywhere, we're going mute. Nothing
sounded; phonemes dissolved, phrases distended. N. screamed I'm losing it.
No one answered. Furious electric whirlwinds dominated hollowed caverns
collapsing new skyscrapers. An atmospheric sparking stole sentences and
paragraphs. The earth itself shuddered. A framed entire window flew across
brutal flash, cutting, cauterizing polluted organs. Look, seems like this:
You bank on infinite space-time, constant words. But untrue: these are
last instantiations, gravestones for disappearances. Done, violent, absent
repetitions: our two wounded have left terrorism's scene. O unhappy day,
night, bloody dawns, violet dusks, enemies everyone. Speechless mouths
forever shut, silent. Fiery worlds topple within bleak storms, lightnings.
Life slows, becomes inaudible in nuclear winter hails. They fuck, dead.

DIVE THROUGH SPREAD LEGS


[Nikuko and I practice every day. We have much fun. Our legs open wide. We
are up-side-down. We await our dive for each other. The dive is aerial
dive.. We look down deep into new space. We look towards back of other
then down of other then forward of other. Here is following description.]

[First, we must smile greatly at following description. We prepare by 
happy smile to fall across each other hole. We have steam-hole, geyser- 
hole. We look down with 10x tele-micro-scope. It is very beautiful in 
pink-brown color.]

[Why we speak this way. We seduct you with foreign language. We write in 
foreign language. You can hear us. You think you understand. You pay to 
watch DIVE THROUGH SPREAD LEGS.]

"No. 1, standing at the end of a row of mats, does a Headstand, and, when 
the balance is gained, straddles the legs wide sideward. No. 2, the diver, 
runs forward and upon reaching No. 1, springs from both feet and dives 
through the spread legs, finishing in a Forward Roll." [We read from 
wonderful stunting and tumbling book. We add No. 3, diving No. 1 and No. 
2. We have many diver standing spread legs in long stunt and tumbling 
line.]

[You are attracted to "Political Economy of The Teaching of Stunts and 
Tumbling" by B. and D. Cotteral. You see much work and labor. You smell 
diver standing spread legs. You have happy smile. You want to fall across 
each other hole. We give you gift of 10x tele-micro-scope. This is begin- 
ning of gaze with purpose which is beginning of exchange. We read in 
"Phenomenology of Exchange of the Teaching of Stunts and Tumbling" by B. 
and D. Cotteral.]

[You are work for us. You are permit to look at our many hole of diver
standing spread legs. You are very happy. Sometimes No. 1 or No. 3 diver
finish in Forward Roll dive in you. You are push towards hole. You are
sold to hole. Man, you are sold to hole. Woman, you are sold to hole.]

"About four yards behind each headstander stands a diver. At a signal, the 
divers run forward and dive through the legs of the headstanders and do a 
Forward Roll."

Need help, I don't know anything.


I don't know why I find the defrag log interesting. Honestly, I don't. 
Some of the files held on to their partial status, refused to return 
whole, to their clean and proper place in the magneto-social order. Others 
balked in general, and still others went along willingly. 

What was it about the everglades.mov for example that insisted on a policy 
of strangulation, scattering its remains in 17 brutal pieces across god 
knows how many platters? And this, in the midst of purity, dissolution so 
small statistically that it doesn't even register in the larger order of 
things. (Continued below. I guess I needed space to present the file it- 
self, so you would understand what I'm talking about.)

I admire people who can read logs clearly, and understand all the file
types. Really, there are so many of them, that an amateur can hardly keep
track. Some, such as .ht, I recognize as a hypertelnet configuration file,
but things like .idx leave me totally confused. And what is it about these
particular files that makes them so resistive? I'm fascinated with
ocgen.log.

I showed these files to M****. He's more of a neophyte than I am, which
made me feel better. But still, when I've fragmented before, everything
has gone through the mill. And this time, look what happens! - even though
I've taken pains to close down all sorts of background processes.

Here's part of the ocgen.log:

[accessutil - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[commapps - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[multim - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[accessopt - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[pinball - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[mswordpad - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[wbem - OC_QUERY_STATE] - complete

Here's my favorite part:

[autoupdate - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[rootautoupdate - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[ieaccess - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[games - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[accessutil - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[commapps - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[multim - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[accessopt - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete

About to commit what? Perhaps to be committed, set-aside? The terrifying
thing here is the fragmentation - what happened, what happened - why am I
so curious - what strange beast slouches towards us - what horsemen, fury,
apocalypse - metal fragment straight-jacket torn in 17 pieces - something
moving in pieces - in the distance -
