there's a platform below for discussion and choreography demonstration.
but if you sit on the platform, you generate particle spew energy.
only one person can sit on the platform at a time.
there's no room for two people to sit on the platform together.
above the platform there are several running spews.
these spews continue no matter what else is happening.
but they're out of sight when you're on the platform.
when you're paying attention to the platform.
when you're paying attention to the activities on the platform.
you can sit just about anywhere on spheres or other objects.
almost all of them spew and interfere with vision, movement, sound.
for you can only move from sitting to standing.
and when you are sitting you are dancing and prancing.
your avatar is no longer yours.
your avatar is guided into frenzy by an object.
frenzy and spews might interfere with serious demonstration below.
"zany levels zing."

=========================================================================

"The performance aspects I work with are based on the notion of absolute
spectacle; what is presented is literally all there is. An avatar has no
meat, cannot be wounded, hungry, thirsty, dead. An avatar can embody
hysteria, convulsions, autonomic dance. We demonstrate this dance-body
movement in combination with a text I will present at the time through
chat." -

=========================================================================

Performance, followed by discussion, will begin at 10pm New York time
(12pm Melbourne time) and will last until 10.45pm New York tome (12.45pm
Melbourne time).

grappling with the question of time - still contraditory "number of motion 
in respect of before and after? Irrecuperable diachrony of pure 
passingness? Reversible? Relative? Real? Living Present? Original 
transcendence? Structure of consciousness?

experiences, memories, dreams, imaginings, and dwellings:

time as absolute/static: nothing happens
what happens is the time of the body, which happens to the view, not the
viewed. 

the speed-up is something the operator doesn't have to inhabit.

the operator knows what is happening = the operator can trace what is 
happening

definitely dreamlike, but ruptured dream, lucid dream
the nightmare of falling off the platform, falling out of the game space

my work is always in a hurry, i always feel near death, so my art
is really nothing but a series of small completions

every completion, every gesture, leads somewhere else. i'm bound by
what's possible for me in Second Life, whch is bound by money on 
my part - not enough to rent a decent space, not enough to purchase
proper computers. as an independent i work outside of academia;
whatever i do is largely by myself and my limited resources.

nothing will remain of it, of this control, after my death. and these, 
these are already altered and frozen gestures, from the movement-
moment of bodies a long time ago, bodies whose names are
forgotten, who no longer have, no longer take up, residence, here
or there

i relate to the phantasm, uncanny, an imaginary, to the hypnagogic,
to theory which turns its back on me, to an exclusionary economics
which keeps me here, not with you, not there in Oz. i can only dream
Oz, or dream Oz dreaming, perhaps you are not there, you are not
there, at all

in time, there will be no avatars. in time. in close time, there is no
hunger, no pain, no damage, no tears, no illness, no injury, no
thirst. close time is closed time; the avatar inhabits an event 
horizon, a gathering of information without interior - with at best,
the simulacrum of interior

isn't death, where there is no death, where there is nothing? isn't
death the escapement of its absence, permeating an inconsiderate
memory of being?

death presupposes an event, cracks and stutters time. death vectorizes
time, and without death, i imagine everything reversible, neither here
nor there. the deathless is indescribable, a true-real death neither
of nor within-without the world.

it always takes time to die.

and dancer,

this is how i envision slonnui sound, chimes and shrine,
gongs when  onset tones tend, tend to disappear,
open space before and after chimes, you
can walk around them, companion shrine moving, the 
following voice, murmur, haunt, haunting less desire
more metal, wood, earth, fire, ground stone, or
in the air hovering, music turning mmusic,
encompassing, rattan, bridge of vine, liana, gorge 
beyond, below, mountains lost here, what is honey
elsewhere, what, among memory-flowing peaks

Playing Cura Saz at the Magic Garden


I'd never played cura saz before, but Leah traded one to me for a tenor 
banjo I had. Steve had invited Azure and me to play with Eric, George, 
Margarida, and Barry at the Magic Garden. So I finished with electric saz 
and cobza, then performed on the cura; I must say it was terrific and I 
received much happiness from the standing-room only audience. I tuned to 
c/d/c and it beautifully sang, as did Azure. Margarida and Barry drove us 
back afterwards and we arrived around 3am, whence I began recording with 
the cura freshly, but this morning it sounded poorly and uninspirational. 
Now then today I began anew with four recordings of which here are two, 
complete with reverberation and some hiss removing which increases the 
bell-like harmonics in a beautiful blend. Oh, it is such a lovely 
instrument to play and to think it was for the first time at the Magic 
Garden, and wonderfully!

it is. 

heres the thing its that damn slab that doesnt move that makes a platform 
sutra. it jsut sits there what do you know. everything else moves carrying 
just what are those bodies doing. well for one thing theyre not moving. 
are they moving. they are not. are they doing something. just what are 
they doing.

every slab rights every other. every slab writes every other. every slab 
descripts every other. if a slab rights an other it generates an origin. 
if there is an origin there is a completion. there is a completion of a 
right slab. numbers vanquish numbers. 

every rite slabs an other. every slab is a generation. generations of 
numbers are not numbers of generations. generations of numbers are rites.
tantra completes every number. tantra completes the other. tantra is 
always other tantra is always slab. slab is always flat.

Few notes on Second Life and literature, for the &Now Buffalo conference 
(as usual will be presenting online).


1 In Second Life there may be speaking. Speaking is too close for many 
people who won't speak but will just use the text chat window. When you 
hear a voice, you are in the presence of the voice, of the person 
speaking.

2 Chat is safer and cooler, and you can paste text in the chat window, you 
can save the chat dialog. Pasting text allows you to work things out in 
advance. You can think in advance, just as you do in literature. You can 
think in advance and someone will read it later, just as if you were 
speaking it then. Reading text brings the writer up to date for you.

3 You can write interesting scripts that make objects and avatars do 
things. Interesting scripts are invisible literature; they're under the 
hood of the virtual world, and you sense them only by what they make 
things do.

4 Scripts are performative language, they carry out things, transform bits 
and bites into the visible. You never see the skeleton of the virtual 
world, you never read its literature, only its affect, its effect.

5 Objects may have signs above or below them, objects may be inscribed 
with writing, and with writing, you can create narratives and literature 
out of objects.

6 Almost everything in the virtual and real world is always inscribed, and 
even in physical reality, there are no "natural" organisms that are not 
tended, are unintended, are not tended to.

7 In a virtual world, everything is inscribed and of the ontology of 
inscription. In a physical world, the real is inert, obdurate. In a 
physical world, organisms are inscribed, cultured, acculturated, all the 
way down.

8 Every organism is a literature.

beautiful life

time is always beautiful time

time is always sublime

and beyond reach, grope, grasp, is time

experiences, memories, dreams, imaginings, and dwellings, inhabit the 
world, inhabit the worlds

liquid time, fluid time, everything happens, the body is a happening.
everyone and everything views everyone and everything

definitely dreamlike, lucid, dream of riding among game-spaces, among 
which are my own

my work is always thought and thinking, i always feel in the midst of 
life, so my art is a series of sublime gestures, infinite in their reach

every completion, every gesture, leads to the sublime

everything remains of it, of this control, after my death, which is also 
after my life, but consider - in my life 

and these, these are already altered and frozen gestures, from the 
movement-moment of bodies a long time ago, bodies of immemorial names, who 
reside, inhabit, live

in time, there will be true real avatars 

in time

in open time, there is hunger, pain, damage, tears, illness, injury, 
thirst

open time is opened time; the avatar lives infinitely, an expansion of 
information, boundless, beautiful

isn't life, where there is no life, where there is everything 

isn't life the escapement of its absence, permeating an inconsiderate 
memory of being

life presupposes an event, cracks and stutters time. life vectorizes time, 
and without live, i imagine everything reversible, neither here nor there. 
the lifeless is indescribable, a true-real life neither of nor 
within-without the world

taking your time to live (it never takes time to day)

where living is, is

i'm dried out. i have an archivist coming tomorrow. azure and i pulled out 
what we had left of my work - the rest is in columbus, thanks to john ben- 
nett, in the collection there. meanwhile there are about fifteen cartons 
here. there are 3/4", beta, vhs, 8, hi8, minidv, cassette, reel to reel, 
8mm, 16mm, super8 sound, mimeos, typed pages, books, magazines, chapbooks, 
zines, flyers, cds, vinyl records, dvds, cd-roms, photographs, xeroxes, 
altered images, and drawings - i'm sure i'm leaving things out. to have my 
life compartmentalized and out of this place too small to contain it. yes, 
and to gain space for new work, this disheveled factory of useless produc- 
tions which tend to overflow, miles of linear media for example, mountains 
of print. hopefully everything will slowly move out into newer regions. i 
worry that some of the notebooks and theory-work will be unavailable, but 
no one publishes my theory anyway and i'm glad that these things, if he 
takes them, will have a somewhat safe home, at least until i'm gone and 
won't be around to care. i'm a cultural projectile - all these sounds and 
sights headed into the blue, just as my online videos pop up and down, for 
the most part unwatched. i'm hoping to get a terabyte drive for some of 
the recent work, a beginning anyway, maybe he'll pay for one, wouldn't 
that be wonderful. then the spew that suffocates me will glow like jewels 
elsewhere until universal radiation and decay set in - after that, all 
bets are off, my stuff, as it were, sucks itself out of existence. already 
i have films decaying over at filmmakers coop - i haven't heard from them 
in years - and who knows - two decade's work might be gone. hopefully 
tomorrow we begin to gain both space and oblivion, at least that portion 
of oblivion not already assigned.

rough guide to connected / disconnected society 

(more wholes and holes here)

stages of networking: 

A degree zero to telegraphy: cohering with the obdurate/analogic real. to 
get from here to there: move from here to there. cross the rubicon. slip- 
pages: smoke signals, voice, military bugles, etc. but not enormous. this 
is the world before the jump-cut. industrial revolution. local knowledge. 
bullae, tablet, mail. analogic truth values located in obdurate-inert.
there is here here. use value conflated with exchange value.

B degree 1/2 to telephony: linear non-redundant communication, voiceless, 
abstracted. where wire is, communication is; the obdurate/analogic appears 
in the form of linear connectivity: from here to there, is wire. morse and 
other codings tending on one hand towards universal standards and on the 
other towards local compaction. mass industrialization. regional know- 
ledge. visual telegraphy, telegraph, pony-express. digital loom, early 
digital constructs. diorama, inert real-time special effects. concepts of 
class consciousness, alienation. truth values located in obdurate-inert - 
hermeneutics of truth. there is there there. exchange value, capital.

C degree 3/4 to internet: multiplexing, voiced, incipient digital communi- 
cation. beginnings of satellite technology. party-lines, cb and ham radio 
- carriers are abstracted, but voice returns the analogic, presencing of 
the body. connection almost always appears to be one-to-one. start of 
internet, fidonet, bbs, buffered news including radio and television. the 
social characterized by intensifications and delays. fordism, beginnings 
of post-fordism, communication-mode community. nation-centrism, patriot- 
ism. airmail, telegram, tickertape. vacuum tube, mercury delay lines, 
mainframes, beginnings of protocol suites. role-playing games. inert and 
buffered special effects. concepts of mass society and culture industry. 
truth values entangled with media, embedded in obdurate-inert, protocol 
statements. there is here there. abstract exchange, trans-capital.

D degree 1: internet: universal abstracted digital connectivity, construc- 
ted truth and truth values. web 2.0, beginnings of universal interfacing, 
community, connectivity. hidden costs of industrialization 'elsewhere': 
universal exploitation as well. (inauthentic) transparency of time and 
space, collapse of histories into micro-histories. what might have been 
the simulacrum or society of the spectacle becomes everyday life. capital, 
communication, data-base, and body are one. universal knowledge for those 
who have both economic and cultural capital. email, online communities and 
virtual worlds. digital special effects, buffered and non-buffered. 
concepts of identity theft, conspiracy, matrix, singularity. truth values 
sublimated, ostensibly located in obdurate-inert, protocol statements. 
truth values surface as binary constructs. on one hand, digital universal 
abstraction - on the other, the truth (setting) of the pixel or smallest 
element. the analogic returns in the form of the pixel within its 
potential well. there is no there there. there is no here here. phantom 
capital.

E degree > 1: information-mass, mass individuation, encapsulation of 
history, tottering eco-systems, populations, massive extinctions, mass 
starvation, and so forth. 'the wobbling pivot.' truth values mediated and 
remediated from the obdurate inert. there is no there. there is no here.
remediation of capital, phantom capital.

degrees of disconnect: this is a mapping of 'degrees of separation' with 
dual tendencies: 

1. towards the elimination of alterity in favor of protocol-relationships. 
complex relation with capital, personal accumulation; local, national, and 
international knowledge, sequestered fundamentalisms. accommodation to 
power. (exceptions abound.)

2. towards clandestine, hidden, or effaced alterity and analogic labor, 
governance, regional knowledge. top-down multinationals, regional con- 
flicts, gangsterisms, overpopulation, open fundamentalisms. (exceptions 
abound.)

as with lyotard, we find entanglement among 1, 2, and network degrees A-E.


these are better more experimental saz

i tend to do things beyond my capability, or rather to extend myself until 
things begin to break down. i hear them in my head, not in my fingers. 
it's frustrating - my nails are a mess. but on these two pieces i found 
workarounds and they sound the way i heard them, just so. they're also 
using an interesting scale, among other things - not to mention some odd 
techniques.

and i knew they worked because i stopped thinking about the techniques, or 
rather would release one, and then let my hands take over autonomously, 
i'd slide from one to another like this, something similar to tantra, a 
conjuring and generating. rarely completion, but here it surrounds me.

ordered world undercut by abjection, information entangled, unavailable, 
truth transformed into constructed holarchic sets, analogic real is inert 
and obdurate, digital real is quantum and wave function collapse, bodies 
are always inscribed and sexualized, bodies are always abject, inscription 
and culture are entangled and appear in every species, ordered world is 
disordered world, abjection seethes, gods and meanings are bootstrapped 
productions, social is radically connected and disconnected, world is 
introjections and projections of world, inscriptive cut is both wound and 
suture, virtual world and real worlds are identical, imaginary produces 
uncanny-imaginary among horse sacrifice of little object a, death 
bootstraps theorizing, theorizing bootstraps death: whatever is most 
abject and bleak - whatever is darkest, is world-foundation,

word theory is never our theory,
performative language is abjection-thrust,
world theory is never our theory,
death, escapement of absence.

Avadance, caught.


In 1996 there was Kyoko Date in Japan. Shortly after, virtual models. 
Around then, Diki in Korea. Shortly after, Adam. Around then in both 
Korean and Japan, virtual idols. Kyoko's big song, Love Communication. 
Kyoko's big number, dancing in Manhattan. Kyoko is textured wire-frame. 
She dances across film/video images of the Brooklyn Bridge. She dances in 
front of the Plaza or the Waldorf-Astoria. She dances in crowds. Her 
movements are frenetic, angular, energized. She dances fast. In the mid 
200/0s, filtered and rewritten motion capture software imitated and 
extended Kyoko's dance. The new dance was avadance. The new avatar was 
Julu Twine. Avadance was imported into the virtual world Second Life. 
Foofwa d'Imobilite took up and extended Twine's avadance. Julu Twine took 
up Foofwa d'Imobilite's extensions. Avadance caught on. Kira Sedlock - 
credited with the name 'avadance' - taught avadance to fellow students in 
the West Virginia University dance department. Avadance spread everywhere. 
Foofwa d'Imobilite returned to the origin. Foofwa dreams of Kyoko Date 
modified by Julu Twine. Foofwa performs avadance. Again and again, 
videography attempts the impossible: record avadance. It's tiresome. 
Controlled conditions were used in the Mark Morris studios. Julu Twine 
performed the Boojum ritual music. Blue Carter sang 'I wonder what Kansas 
will be like.' Foofwa d'Imobilite performed recorded avadance. Avadance 
was long, angular. The file was huge. Julu Twine compressed the file. The 
result: http://www.alansondheim.org/avadance.mp4 . Clarity is questionable 
but the movement is there. The original - about a gigabyte in size. The 
copy - 30 meg. Give you an idea. watch his hands.



back and forth music

passing techniques: i was dissatisfied with the sound of the cura cumbus, 
with strings set in three doubled courses tuned a fourth apart. i changed 
them to lighter saz strings, changed the lower course into octaves instead 
of unison, and retuned the instrument to cfc'. i reset and repaired the 
bridge and lowering to two millimeters at the octave. finally, i reset the 
neck position. i can now play with extensive hammering on and off, without 
the 'booming' sound that was characteristic of the instrument. i recorded 
cured1.mp3 and cured2.mp3. cured1 explores the changes i made with new odd 
techniques that are feasible now; cured2 pushes the limit of the riff at 
the end of cured1. both of these are 'nerve-jangling.' finally i took the 
techniques to the di giorgio classical guitar, producing di1-di4 which 
surprised me in their odd beauty. they're given in reverse order, di1 
recorded last, a slow and simple mellow piece. the other three indicate a 
range of melody and timbre, confined of course to the western twelve-tone 
scale, which the cura cumbus escapes. but the amazing sound of the guitar 
compensates for this; the timbre range is amazing. the four guitar pieces 
are probably my best to date; the two cura cumbus are probably my most 
raucous. give them a listen and enjoy. -

And there will be earth above, earth among banks,
earth below banks, earth beneath banks.
And there will be stones.

Avadance


http://www.alansondheim.org/avadance.mp4 [new/clear version]

PURPOSES, from avadance to avasound, these normal modes are 
avadance and a just response to the very condition of the 
night - think of avadance as that surplus which has nothing -
but there are crowds and audiences and anyone may learn avadance ...
Maud Liardon: "Do you say 'learn avadance' or 'learn to avadance'?"
And here is a faltering avadancer as sutured knot, closing the manifold
as such a dance, avadance:

"avadance
they come to greet hir: avadance
on the way down: avadance
on the way up: avadance
suturing with needle and thread, not here, not there, avadancer!
open the manifolds: avadancer!
falter failure: avadancer!"

AND with phantom or invisible objects the avadancers would find themselves

A terrible poem and better meaning


written when I was maybe seventeen
when I should have known better.
you see, the core of the poem says something
trying to break out, but doomed by the misery
of bad writing, bad teaching, 
living far too long in my head (my head went nowhere)
(I went nowhere)
(I was too scared to go)
(nowhere was scarier):

[comments]

on returning from abroad: the omens

Two nights ago, the moon grew red,
 shimmering like the surface of dark wine; [which doesn't]
And just last night a brilliant star
 slashed the sky in quiet smoke, [meteors don't make noise]
 disappearing in the Western Sea; [Mediterranean sublimated]
Soon after that, I saw a jackel. [for real]
Tomorrow I leave this land.

There are no omens in America,
 no strange stones, nor priests
 robed deep in black, square hats. [of course not; hats aren't robes]

In these omens, I am sure, the meaning
 to be found is not a certain death, [death is always certain]
 nor that Rome shall totter beneath
 the crazed and royal actions of Caligula, [good grief!]
 he of the jeweled teeth, the gnawing 
 disease;

The meaning, instead, is just within the omens - [core of something here]
 the omens, the meaning

(And for this, I shall travel to many a distant land [here we go!]
 crawling to death in the pampas, [difficult to do]
 great golden spiders glittering about me - [actually the Everglades]
 crawling into stone's throw, spear's thrust
 of the mad Jiwaro, [who are as sane as any of us!]
 and walking the streets of my native city, [bad Ginsberg imitation]
 exchanging many things with total strangers, [STDs?]
 waiting for their omens, their meanings, and
 dying, god knows where, in some white bed.) 

[monosyllabic Ginsberg Sunflower Sutra ending. What's good here is the 
idea of a _chain of omens,_ each foretelling others - an endless chain - 
in which meaning is found in permanent deferral. That incipient decon- 
struction/ism appears later on the series, now lost. Even today, I 
anxiously await signs and omens, knowing full well they'll only lead, 
uselessly, to others: a world of deferred omens, announcing nothing but 
themselves, predicting nothing but themselves. And there's comfort in 
that, however cold: meaning is there - it just has nothing whatsoever to 
do with us, but we sense a glimmer of unassimilable alterity in its 
presence. Or its hoped-for presence: otherwise, there's nothing, nothing 
at all, and we might as well die alone, as we always do, in some white 
bed.]

sweat glands


this is my practice. this is what i do. i breathe culture. culture comes 
out of sweat glands. culture makes shiny areas wherever i move. i cannot 
help shiny areas. every day, more and more of them. o tiny manatee, why i 
cannot stop. do you know i have swallow jennifer, bind travis, grind julu 
to nikuko-pulp, with nikuko-order. nikuko is thin layer on sweat glands.
sweat glands have culture sheen.

My strange music


What distinguishes it from other musician's work: I always play at my 
limits; I don't play what I know, but nearby areas, what I might extend 
myself into, where I might fail. So it's not a question of comfort with 
improvisation or instrument, but pushing past that to discomfort; at 
times, everything falls apart. The limits of my ability are the limits of 
my world. The limits are the limits of my body in its functioning, of 
muscle memory, musical kludging. I played electric oud last night at the 
benefit; I hadn't played it before the previous night (in fact I hadn't 
played oud before the previous night). The instrument is fretless, of 
course, with a fingerboard over two feet long that goes almost up to the 
bridge. The pickup is piezo. So it was a gamble; I kludge on fretless, 
look for fifths and consonance and proceed from them. It's harder with 
chords. So playing it involves a problematic - what can be done with 
limited recourse and recourses - what happens near the boundaries of 
failure - how can one tunnel through them - how can one survive on the 
other side? This is different than knowing what one's doing. Myk knows 
what he's doing (I think!), has amazing sureness and grace on the lap 
steel. Azure works with songs that are relatively fixed: there's constant 
structure. I'm broken, playing broken, assembling, bricolage; instead of 
lost in music, I'm lost in a thumb muscle that's not responding the way I 
want it to. What to do? Skip the thumb, let other fingers take over, slow 
things down. Go back after a while; try the thumb again. If it works, use 
it sparingly. If not, try the fourth finger, for example. That partially- 
flattened second is giving another problem; hit the octave (for example, 
e' on d' octaved with the e two strings down: e/a/d'(e')), and work 
backwards to the flattened second (i.e. between major and minor), which 
might be checked by the minor third. Once that's down, construct a riff 
that might help me remember the position later on (repeated complex 
flurries of notes bury the problem, create rhythm and backup for Myk and 
Azure). Argh! The thumb's fine, slight cramp in the right index finger; 
try the third finger as replacement. For this reason, most of the time I 
don't think of myself as a musician, but as a fraud; my music is fraud 
music, in a neurotic world of its own. On the other hand, there are times 
I feel I'm playing well, and I lose myself in the playing - only to smile, 
and watch (as if from a distance), the smile break through everything, and 
self-conscious- ness rules again. http://www.alansondheim.org/lineout.mp3

http://www.alansondheim.org/lineout.mp3 - this is a different recording 
(line out, in the club) that may be clearer beauty shredding; the piece 
sounds other than the first (there are no perfect recordings) (there is no 
perfect music) (there are no musicians, in the sense that there are no 
authors) (of course we're dreaming in the wrong direction) (rewind)

death is the crime and the criminal
death is the criminal and the soul of the criminal
death, is the slice of death 
death, is the blade, and the blade slit  
the blade slitting the cosmos
the cosmos, slit by the blade
living, is on the other side of the cut
the other side is the thickness of a vector
the vector is a plane and an elsewhere
death is ourselves are criminals
are criminals elsewhere
the vector connects us to the other side of the cut
the vector connects us to the cosmos
the cosmos is our cosmos 
death is a movement towards ourselves in the cosmos
from the other side we are connected through death
we are criminals here and criminals elsewhere
we are criminals emerging from the slit
the slit is the slit of death 
death here connects us to death there
we are the criminals of death and the crimes of death
we are the crimes of death and the criminals of death
of the slit we are elsewhere
of the slit we are not in the cosmos

do our worlds crash and corrupt and disappear
yes they do
do we watch the crash and disappearance
yes we do
that is the wisdom that grows and grows criminals
that is the wisdom of death that grows criminals



It's true, if you say something long enough, it will disappear.

I have no teacher nor do I have a master.
I have no caste and I have no name.
I am a self-appeared Buddha.
