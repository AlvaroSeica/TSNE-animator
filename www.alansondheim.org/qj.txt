Now what to do?

====


Where to begin when I began:

If I knew where I am, I'd have to know around my body, and then would know 
how that knowledge connects to everything. The best I can do is far less 
and I don't know where I am because of that. Where I am is disjointed from 
what I know. For example: I database on panix.com, Gmail, Facebook, Ning,
MySpace, Youtube, Twitter, Cybermind, Cyberculture, Wryting, Poetics, 
Nettime, Netbehaviour, Webartery, 7-11, and Second Life. Stop right now. 
This is the energy of another location. For example, then:

This is a dead end. I am scrawling nowhere. The appetition of the theore- 
tical collapses after any number of hours. Given the change in interface, 
I can't access .wsdl any more. The account is full of relics. For example:

$ perl a/looply.pl hello
404 Not Found at a/looply.pl line 32
$ pico a/looply.pl
= $google_search -> doGoogleSearch( $google_key, $query, !/usr/local/bin/- 
perl looply.pl typical Google Web API # Location of the GoogleSearch WSDL 
file my loop, retrieving 10 results at a time my $loops = 20;  
GoogleSearch.wsdl Hsearch = 1)*10; $offset += 2) { # Query Google my 
$results = $google_search -> doGoogleSearch( $google_key, $query, 2009...

which now crashlands, scratching nothing. There's this to say about the 
history: "1 ls 2 pico zz 3 fg 4 grep sondheim /etc/passwd >> zz 5 who | 
grep sondheim >> zz 6 w | grep sondheim >> zz 7 date >> zz 8 fg 9 pico zz

grep -v ":" yy > zz 27 pico zz 28 strings zz > ww 29 pico yy 30 sed 
's/\[.....//g' ww > zz," moving through the usual errors. Stumbling gets 
you where you thought you were going. I lie, cheat, kludge, hack, crack, 
stack. I can't remember the last time tendrils took root, for example /, 
with some sort of mastery.

Miasma: I have just read I misunderstand code (Silvestre, who I misunder- 
stand), that it's not writing in any sense of natural language. But from 
higher to lower level, there are always translations. Assembly language 
translates like sorted boxcars - the most beautiful emission in the cosmos 
is indirect addressing, tendrils. Machine language scratches the material 
itself: Better yet, scratch into the world, as if it were natural. Where 
am I in the midst of databases in this dark night? where is the night 
leading?

Code knows no night, no day. What affects the protocol shudders the chips 
themselves, dreaming the code shuffling through them. The code doesn't 
break; chips do. Chips shatter in the cold, sputter in the heat. 

This is my emission in the cosmos. This is on your screen, roiling across 
your machine, this doesn't stop for anything, this disappears. Our emis- 
sions are always already ghosts, always already virga, portending their 
extinctions in their very forms. Nothing reaches the ground that never 
existed. What you can be sure of: that labor, energy, created this text. 
That the text is an economy and a signature, just as paper money or check, 
just as stocks and protocols are economies and signatures. Under capital, 
mass amasses; identity lost remains in the form of energy spent. In the 
holographic universe, information is never lost, almost always is irre- 
trievable. Here in this text I give you the blueprint of my bones. You can 
do nothing with it. Stumbling gets you where you thought you were going, 
but you've already forgotten my name.

The song HERUKA

I MUST do this, while I have full CONTROL over my HANDS and FINGERS, while 
I am still alive. For this records a form of HYSTERIC MASTERY over an 
instrument, pushing sound to the LIMIT of my ABILITY. I have no doubt I 
can't go farther and I MUST construct this LEGACY of what ONCE I was 
capable of DOING. For soon I will no longer have this SHARP STRENGTH to 
continue, and EVERYTHING will be LOST FOREVER. Oh I must play my VERY BEST 
and my VERY FASTEST and as MOST ACCURATE as possible THIS VERY EVENING 
that will last FOREVER encapsulated in FILE #heruka.mp3. SOMEDAY you will 
listen and I will be LONG GONE and you will say to yourself HERE WAS A MAN 
or A WOMAN, gender need not be, HERE WAS A MAN AND A WOMAN, BEHOLD HIR 
WORKS. And you will have CAUSE to REJOICE at the SPLENDOR of the SOUND, 
produced by long-dead HANDS and FINGERS, that this SOUND still resounds 
among you. THEY KNEW, you will think, THEY KNEW, BACK THEN, and with such 
KNOWLEDGE were REPLETE. And you will be SORROWFUL you did not know me, 
SORROWFUL, you would not see, FOREVER, those HANDS AND FINGERS moving 
swiftly in EXALTED WAYS of SUBLIME AND ETERNAL BEAUTY. I give you, NOW, 
this GIFT, that you may cherish it FOREVER, silently murmuring my NAME, 
such as it is remembered, ALAN SONDHEIM, forgotten but HEARD for ONE LAST 
TIME, remembered for ONE LAST SONG.

Neuradynamia

Jennifer was dark and mysterious, well-strung, strong, and vigorous, but 
with weak nerves. Everyone talked about her and said she had a nervous 
condition. Julu would say 'she had some nerve,' as if a gloomy apportion- 
ment had consigned her to untoward misery. Naked, Jennifer exhibited a 
remarkable neuranagenesis, centered around the neurad. Pain were in order, 
Nikuko remarked. This is the central nervous system. This is where every- 
thing that happened to Jennifer, happened. Beyond railroad-spine, she had 
been diagnosed neurasthenic, an exhaustion of nerve force impaired by 
neuratrophy. Julu called her neure, as she said, from beginning to end. 
She reached the breaking-point, everyone getting on her nerves, playing 
them like an instrument; Nikuko called this neurectasis, nerve-stretching. 
There were no neuriatry for her, Julu said. It was hopeless. It's like 
this: Jennifer near death and they continue to talk. Jennifer no longer 
hears, has no desire to listen; her neuralgia peaks, her will to converse 
- her ability to converse - is gone. Neurogenesis failed. Her neuroblasts 
continued to develop enlarged neurocele, resulting in hardening of 
cellular walls. She had ascending neuritis as a result. She had descending 
neuritis as well, her virtual body dissolved into nodes treated by 
neurectomy, as one or another nerve corpuscle was decommissioned in the 
hope that her lipomatous neuritis would be susceptible to reassignment of 
addresses, direct and indirect, resulting in a cathected neurility in 
which thoughts and dreams flowed freely. Sheep's brain nervine did 
nothing, however; it was too general a treatment as the neuramebimeter 
clearly showed. There was no neurogeny; neuroma was feared, her neuroplasm 
weakened with bad thoughts that Julu had warned against. Injections of 
neurokeratin were tried. Jennifer the neuroid, screamed Jennifer. Giving 
name to neurography only lay the foundations for what Nikuko would call, 
Jennifer echoing her, the kind of neuromimesis that seemed to characterize 
her neurolysis. Such a weakening, Julu said, that dreams rose within the 
softness of her thinking, Jennifer thinking softly, Julu said. Neurosomes 
were softcode, weakcode, lassitude, languor, mute and supine reasoning. 
Neurosuture was tried prior to, post, neurosurgery; her neurophonia got in 
the way, resulting in transient neuroparalysis. Jennifer-dream-state 
slowly began to understand her neuropathic sleep. Almost comatose, Julu 
said, the result of neuro -trasis or -tripsy, as if the kernel were under 
siege, perhaps neurotabes, or the excessive power of neurosthenia. Dreams 
there, falling apart, memory tablature under the signature of neurotica - 
it was readable, Nikuko said, even from a distance. Even from a vast 
distance, Jennifer sinking, the incandescent sadness of neurotrophasthenia 
finally taking hold. Your smile is beautiful, Nikuko whispered. Your 
breasts are lovely, Julu murmured. Jennifer neurotic screamed Jennifer. 
Neurotropism negative and positive cradled her quietly, Jennifer sinking 
deeper, listening to everything and nothing, in the silent neurotension of 
Julu and Nikuko. She is caressing us, Julu cried softly. Everything was 
soft in the neuropathic, only Jennifer thinly dreaming, thinner and 
thinner, then nothing at all.

"I want to ask Jacques Derrida a question."

I want to ask Jacques Derrida a question.

It is question about death, not in particular his death.

But a question concerned with the aporia of death, not necessarily his 
own.

Such a question, which would have been possible several years ago, is no 
longer possible.

We are thrown back on the words of Jacques Derrida.

We are immured there.

It would have been simple: Jacques, here is what I want to know.

Do you have a minute of your time.

The body of Jacques Derrida still exists.

His body, phoric, carries the aporia.

The aporia is not his own, nor can he speak and return an unraveling.

Today, words are never set in stone, and questions go unanswered.

Today, questions disappear, and their occasion disappears.

The occasion of a question: a gap, as in a detective story.

As if the question were sutured by an answered, when in fact it is sutured 
by any reply at all.

An answer responds to a question; a reply responds to the occasion of a 
question.

I remember Jacques Derrida, and would have tapped him on the shoulder, 
saying, excuse me, but ...

There is an image I have of this tapping: the softness of his jacket, the 
slight giving away of the flesh beneath, and he turns towards me.

When I move my hands, everything is empty.

Jacques Derrida is a remnant of matter.

... "If death" ... "names the very irreplaceability of absolute 
singularity (no one can die in my place or in the place of the other), 
then all the _examples_ in the world can precisely illustrate this 
singularity. Everyone's death, the death of all those who can say 'my 
death,' is irreplaceable." ... (Derrida, Aporias)

When I move my hands: when my hands are moved for me, are only moved for 
me: mise en scene, a scenario or occurrence, chora.

I do not collapse time, Jacques, in order to speak to you: I speak to
you.

I do not collapse space, in order to speak: I touch you lightly on your 
shoulder, I wait until you turn around, your glance moves in my direction, 
momentarily you are caught up in my gaze, you hesitate whether or not to 
return your own, your reply to my question, you return such, as if such is 
returned, an exchange of gifts or misrecognition.

Of the good, there is the edge of a knife, and the fall which surrounds
it; of the spoken, there is a comprehension, empathetic alignment, then 
nothing.

Of the spoken, the knife edge separates the question I give to Jacques as 
a gift, an awakening, and the reply which shatters after a particular 
time, calculable, unattainable.

Of the question: all questions are a permanence: It is impossible to 
answer a question.

Jacques turns; I look at his shoes. Thinking of Van Gogh, of Heidegger, 
of Jacques Derrida, I take several photographs. They are remnants, indices 
with lost referents; they are abject. I am silent; I say nothing to him, 
to Van Gogh, to Heidegger. Repeatedly I raise the camera; eye-level, I aim 
downward, towards an incalculable earth. The images, lost, are digital; 
they never were. Between one pixel and another, a hole, precisely the 
width of death.

it is not that the signifier has no referent; in fact, everything has be- 
come referent, and the signifier slips from its moorings as well. it is 
not that the phallus is everywhere and dominant, but that lack occurs as a 
potential (direct or indirect) address within a circuit. it is not that 
gender is irrelevant; gender becomes everything, just as numerous langua- 
ges classify and subvert gender within nominal classifications. it is not 
that sexuality becomes plastic or manufactured, but that the video memb- 
rane become capable of excitation, arousal, and ORGASM.

Defuge sets in, a kind of nausea, too many files, too much, we'll give it 
a whirl, we'll see what comes up, we'll scrape the 'Internet Text,' any- 
thing else I've done..

Let's see - We'll try -
grep -h "no music" texts/*.txt >> zz

Maybe no pictures?

A short time ago, there would have been no problem; Delphi and other 
predictive techniques, including computer extrapolations, presented a 
relatively coherent view of an emergent world. Now and for at least the 
next half-century, such extrapolations are locally relevant at best; no 
pictures, nothing is glimpsed beyond them. We are in the dark-age of 
fast-forward multiple (inter)connectivities that construct equally 
multiple topographies and worlds. It's no longer clear that what lives on 
the level of representation, does not live as well; artificial life is 
life of a form, decimated by pulling the plug. If artificial life is 
clearly the dynamics of information / processing, what removes us from 
this as construct: What remains obdurate in the world?

That's better - one long entry apparently without line-breaks in the 
original. And apparently nothing remains obdurate for long..

It's 2:17 in the afternoon: Do you know where your partners are? 
Maybe I make video with them? Definitely no video, let's see -

runs when no video is turned on at all. These ghostlike apparitions are

Of course there's film in the last resort, but I haven't made film per se 
in years - no film! So -
grep -h "no film" texts/*.txt >> zz

Nothing! No film at all! Just as I expected! Let's try "no photo" -
grep -h "no photo" texts/*.txt >> zz

Nothing again! No photos, no  no photos, nothing.. 
Boredom arrives, no music.. Maybe I'll listen to something..
But then, perhaps no texts, everything gnawed out - beyond all reason -
grep -h "no text" texts/*.txt >> zz

Heruka death theater

Heruka:

Confined without a floor to stretch upon, or space splayed open 
above or beyond, Heruka has to function among the old-fashioned,
does hir best, hir consort churned against the _production-machine_,
hir consort rub raw against _absorption-machine,_ 
hir consort meshed raw against _emission-machine,_
against _yidam-machine,_ against _yidam-machine_

Death Theater:

The stage is pitch-black. The audience is well-lit, floodlights every- 
where. The performance is invisible. Occasional mumblings, cries, whisp- 
ers, nothing understood. Sometimes a spotlight plays across the audience, 
tentative or deliberate. But the stage, the stage is dark, is very dark, 
is black. The stage seems black, seems invisible. Nothing can be seen on 
stage. The audience is illuminated. Sometimes a light moves, quickly or 
slowly, across the audience. The stage is coal- black, absent of color. 
Voices are heard, urgent or languorous, screams perhaps, almost inaudible 
snatches of song. Actors and actresses are invisible. At times, movements 
are heard, perhaps scuffles. Nothing is visible on stage. The stage is 
absolutely black, the audience brightly lit.

gala production of the theater of death
and the lie of buddhism

bodies grind against bodies, nothing is produced.
what could come of slaughter and yidam.
what could possibly come of this. no one wants it to come
of this.
no one wants it to come to this, it's flesh that's ground,
there's nothing more, tendrils of fat, skeins of muscle, 
legarms flailing.
it's nothing, not even an image.
the image floats, there's only existence, whatever is:
no matter whether illusion or obdurate, inert: it's always
present. eyes grind against eyes, such that image turns ash.
ears grind against ears, crackling: no sound.
buddhism's a lie, existence is always relative, already path
to relative path, to relative thing after thing.
existence never promised anything more: what more than thing
after thing after thing. it goes there and always goes there.
believe what you want, ontology's meaningless outside of realms:
it's not non-existence, but ontology sliding into the imaginary.
what then? this sliding, for humans, appears uncanny, as if worlds
tremble; they don't, they don't do anything. get rid of existence:
you're gone. and gone from existence, ground from it.
existence grinds against existence, we're concerned about this.
but that confuses the thing with is: grinds nothing,
against nothing, no loss but what we've made of it: thing and
sound or sight of grinding.
these images show that, non-mandalas, no premise of a virtual
beyond the real, or beneath it, no promise of escape, error,
elsewhere, elsewhere. remember it's never as close as an eye
or ear, never within hearing or seeing. senseless, sensed,
it's what there is, the lie of buddhism is, that it isn't.

   There is no totality: mesh. Mesh dissolves into sub-meshes.
   All the way down. There is none of that. There is no fundamental
   substance. 

   Dictatorial sentences. Foolishness. Anyone can go on and on like this.
   Without mathesis, nothing. Mathesis isn't something anyone can do.
   What's done would have been done.

   Think of it as a reel of film. Dissolve and collapse that reel.
   Enter upon a journey of a black hole. Watch the boundary from a safe
   distance. Be glad you're not a black hole.

   Mathesis or nothing. The granularity of the world picture does not
   devolve into mathesis. The granularity of the world picture does not
   devolve. One searches absolutely.

   The quality of our world does not resolve. Of causality there is no
   resolution. Neither contingent nor production. Neither this one nor
   that one. On our death we are left with our names. On the death of
   their names we are left with nothing.

   Of future, there is none. Think of it a a reel of film.
   Simplistic, utterly wrong. 

   You are trained to write papers that will last forever. You have an
   exactitude of brilliance. Every sentence sketches future and more
   future. Every sentence fills another missing gap in totality. The
   gaps are created by sentences under erasure. The gaps are created
   by sentences manque. By language manque. It is the brilliance of
   the academic paper that closes the gaps.

The Directory of Dolls


1. Doll as territory, mindscape. What goes where? What happens to the sex? 
To the teeth? To the grape-texture of eyes, wrinkled texture of balls? Is 
the penis erect? Labia and nipples present? Does the neck twist? Is the 
doll your territory? Is the doll a victim?

2. Doll as gamespace, inscape of the mind. What conceivable alterations? 
What inconceivable? When does the doll cease to be a doll? What of the 
doll as arousal thing, part-object, passive-thing, aggressive-thing, 
good-thing, naughty-thing? Is the mouth a goal, are the eyes? Is the sex a 
goal? Where is the sex?

doll perform? How is the doll seen to perform? Do you grovel before your 
doll? Is your doll your girl? Is the doll your boy? Your sex?

that? Are you center stage with your doll? Are you upstaged?

dress your fantasy? Do you cry with your fantasy, masturbate with it? How 
does your doll feel about that? Do you undress your doll? Is your doll 
your dream? Is your only doll your only dream?

6. Doll as matrix, receptacle, visible. Is your doll your comfort? Is your 
doll your mother-mother, father-mother, mother-father, father-father? Your 
part- object, your cradled object-little-a? Does your doll forgive you? 
Does your doll always forgive you? Does your doll forgive your naughty 
feelings? Your naughty ways?

7. Doll as icon, symbol, index. Is your doll your universal space? Does 
your doll center you? Is your doll your center? Do you dress and undress 
your center? Do you talk to your center? Are you comfortable, receptacle

your doll? Does your doll play with you? Do you move your doll? Does your 
doll move? Is your doll a dirty little doll?

doll, whisper sweet secrets, loving names no one else will ever know? Do 
you arouse your doll? * Is your doll sexed, is your doll loving you? Do 
you fear your loving doll? Is your doll satisfied? Do you satisfy your 
doll?

14. Doll as demon, as fear, as deadly fear, doll as enemy. Do you own your 
enemy? Are you safe? Is your doll safe with you? Is your doll a hateful 
doll? A loving doll? A secret loving doll? Is your doll always in your 
sight? When you leave home? When you sleep? When you bathe? When you die 
in your sleep?

15. Doll as his doll or her doll. Do you covet the doll of someone else? 
Of another person or doll? Do you speak to the doll, whisper to it, come 
to me, come to me? Do you dream of its coming? Of the doll coming to you? 
of what you will do to it? Of what you will do to it when it comes? With 
it when it comes? Of what you will do, what will you ever do?

16. Doll as doll, as doll. Does your doll own you? Is your doll yours? Are 
you sure your doll is yours? Do you belong to your doll? Does your doll 
care? Do you care if it cares? Are you owned?

'Magic and War'


(I gave my SVA students a final in-class essay topic - the relationship,
if any, between war and magic. We read Tournier's The Ogre, which I have 
always thought is a critical text for understanding the semiotics of 
history and violence. In any case, below is my summary of the essays, 
which you might find interesting. The class, on magic, art, symbolism, 
modernism, and a bit of science, was great to teach - I learned a lot 
myself of course.)


War 'magically' wipes out the fundamentals of human morality - it's ok to 
kill for example. 

The fury of modern weaponry in WWII and beyond appears magical.

War may appear surreal to soldiers, almost magical, as if they're living 
through someone else.

There have been mysterious disappearances of soldiers in war, which 
frightened minds think may be the result of ghosts.

Children's play and nationalism produce magical feelings which may be 
enacted out in war.

Wars magically transform people, who almost magically seem to lose their 
minds.

Wars may be fought over magical phenomena like witchcraft.

Sun Tzu speaks of deception in war, which is similar to magic; the 
battle-field becomes a stage.

The truth of war is (magical) fantasy that must be told over and over 
again.

War propaganda affects people almost magically, if it is successful.

Magicians and soldiers have common traits.

The violence of war destroys beliefs in a magical world.

The threat of war creates a desperate need for magical escapism.

War and magic are like Yin and Yang.

Magical disappearing acts and slaughter in war are related; both alter 
human lives. 

The outcome of war is permanent, the outcome of magic may well be 
temporary.

War is fundamentally scientific, magic is not - they're two sides of the 
same coin.

The magic of war is the power it has over everyone.

The magic of war is the power that the people in charge have over other 
people's lives. 

The magic of war is the illusion of hope that it gives, and the illusory 
magical powers the leaders seem to have.

War gives people hope, and that is magical, but it is the magic of evil.

Warfare is uncanny because soldiers don't have a say in what they're 
fighting for. 

Armies are weird, and armies and at times war can benefit people who 
enlist; this weirdness touches on the magical. 

The darkest magic is when wars are planned by individuals who see soldiers 
as tools or targets.

Taking symbols literally, pushing them into the arena of war, is 
horrifying magic.

The Great Wall of China, built to protect the Chinese Empire, is the locus 
of magical stories.

Dogmatic religion and opposing theologies lead to war; religions 
eventually provoke violence. 

There is nothing magical about war's deaths and destruction; war is 
tragic, stupid, and depressing. 

Magic is a false sense of realism, but through war, dead is dead.

Both magic and war are hard to explain and experience. 

Bravery is magical when soldiers fight against impossible odds and 
superior weapons. 

Wargames on computer, like World of Warcraft, are inherently magical; the 
battles use spells and other things not found in real war.

For some, war can be a time of magical thinking and escapism; it can lead 
people to think in extremes.

War may enable some people to experience an alternative reality, a 
different way of being than they have in their normal lives.

of suffering i am useless
and useless for the gift of kindness
of healing i have nothing but my own
and my own refuses to heal
there is no balance here, equation
nothing but facts and thuds
worlds slaughter worlds
everyone slaughters everyone
everyone slaughters everything
i spend my life in flight and pondering
i spend my life a slave to truth and being

of politics i devour gristled meat
eat through the worms of corruption and decay
of religion i brandish the sword and penetration
i will not howl gods in flight and pondering
i will not ponder things dead and gone and empty
what else can i do
this sun i will not face this coming day
this sun lies to me
what else can it do
neither suns nor gods ponder nor humans
the earth is our slaughterhouse
the earth is our charnelhus
i spend my life pondering life
what else can i do but ponder life

i spent my pondered life, i did that,
spending, spent, and nothing left to do
