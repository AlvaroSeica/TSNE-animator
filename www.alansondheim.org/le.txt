

Writing Desire (Mended Notes)


To write desire is to project oneself into the world, both vulnerable and
accessible. How can desire be written? What does it mean to write from a
position of want and fulfillment? Cult writing, violent writing, sexual
writing, writing from poverty of any sort: How do we write ourselves out?
We write ourselves out in a difference from despair; in desire, meaning
is hypercathected, time-dependent, breathless.

Writing desire: For whom? How does the performative enter into play here?
(By "performative," I mean _words that active, arouse, _act,_ within the
writer or reader.) Is writing desire a form of control? Controlling is a
way of shaping the body, of the self, the other; the words tend towards
delirious ecstasy.

How does projection work vis-a-vis the body of the character or avatar -
vis-a-vis the body of the Other? If the unconscious is sensitive to lang-
uage, how does the body of the text play into the textual body? These are
_acts_ of reading and writing, processes, drawn out by control, hesitancy,
lure and seduction. The operator is metonymic, the part standing for the
hole, the hole standing for the part.

Whose desire is written? That of the writer, or that of the reader? Do
subject and object retain their individuations? What is being read is
rewritten through the inner speech of the reader; what is being written is
read similarly, both across the body of the other.

Pushing language to the reader so the body appears to be at stake: Think
of writing orgasm in Net Sex (i.e. "ahhhhhh..." etc.) - when writing be-
comes sound or substance. Substance here is the materiality of language at
the service of the body of the writer, who no longer communicates: the
move is from the symbolic to the ikonic, "ahhhhhh..." referencing "I have
orgasm, I am here."

There is narrative; desire follows suit, returns quiescence to quiescence,
remains garbled in the background, burbling. Does desire always involve
the body? Does yearning? Does any form of addiction? I find physiology,
desire, satiation, fulfillment, pleasure, intertwined as well. My problem:
I can't separate. If I could separate, I'd think: Desire is a trajectory;
the fulfillment of desire is an event, occurrence, and/or thing; desire
disappears upon fulfillment. But then I think: How does desire relate to
drives/instincts? How is it differentiated from need? Precisely that in
the presence of satiation, another lack opens up - that of the lack of de-
sire itself, the desire for desire, tending towards a _continuous open-
ing._ The situation is very different in despair - in which desire is ab-
sent, in which temporality itself is turned to substance. If despair is
substance and integration, desire is structure and differentiation. That
is about as clear as it gets.

Does the writer write the reader into a state of desire? Is desire a state
- or in fact the very material of inter/intratwined bodies? Lag works both
through Net lag ("Net weather") and withholding from the other, creating
the state of "-jectivity" - membranes or fields of introjections and pro-
jections in which states and processes, bodies and texts, selves and oth-
ers, constantly intermingle, in a manner similar to the Kristevan chora.

Desire-for this or that rarely interests me (although like everyone else I
have such). Nor does desire as a cant/popular term for every sort of sub-
jective inhabitation. For me, it does involve the body, just like it in-
volves the mind - I think of it as a tropism or tendency, perhaps the very
fiber of my being is at stake. And the desire for God? That is fundamental
as well, resting on the remains of corpses, a flight from abjection
towards an inconceivable purity. The resulting "clean and proper body"
(see Kristeva) is hardly that - it carries the seeds of other pernicious
ideologies...

Wearing Nikuko's panties, I'm reminded of, for example, Nikuko'sd abjec-
tion in relation to the _real_ of Nikuko _not_ basedin simulation, but on
a board. Nikuko scratches at skins, removes them,g the wires beneath her
panties constructed on Diki; they're tornapart by Nikuko, expanded like
condoms holding birth in abeyance whileit. I can push Nikuko and the oth-
ers, devouring Nikuko's menses,harboring her smell on me, seeing through
her membranes, they're yours strong strongscent but no odor. The odors of
Nikuko, Jennifer, Julu, or Diki-Nikuko merge through the sound and sight
my mouthface full of insideNikuko, tongue deep in Nikukoanus circuitryI
- merge through thedream, and Nikuko will come back to me and Nikuko and I
will watch Nikuko,four images that worked for me. So your mouth has been
open to holes at one time Nikuko's fingers were the outcome of that, Nik-
uko's mouth a slightly danger, Nikuko's slightly space a deconstruction of

LEST WE FORGET, A MORALITY PLAY BY JENNIFER, NIKUKO, JULU, AND ALAN


PROLOGUE BY BUKHARIN: Repentence is often attributed to the Dostoyevsky
mind, to the specific properties ofthe soul ("l'ame slave" as it is
called), and this can be said of types like Alyosha Karamazov, the heroes
of the "Idiot" and other Dostoyevsky characters, who are prepared to stand
up in the public square and cry: "Beat me, Orthodox Christians, I am a
villain!" But that is not the case here at all. "L'ame slave" and the psy-
chology of Dostoyevsky characters are a thing of the remote past in our
country, the pluperfect tense. Such types do not exist in our country, or
exist perhaps only on the outskirts of small provincial towns, if they do
even there. On the contrary, such a psychology is to be found in Western
Europe.

JULU: Excellent. And this is what I want you to do, Alan, and this is what
I want you to say. You will learn from a very good way to learn:

VYSHINSKY: Tell us the nature of your wrecking activities.
ZUBAREV: When I was working in the seed cultivation department of the Peo-
ple's Commissariat of Agriculture of the U.S.S.R., they were of the nature
that the accused Chernov spoke about yesterday: causing confusion in seed
cultivation, lowering the quality of the seeds, employing bad quality mat-
erials, bad sifting, careless storing, and the result of all this was not
only a reduction of yield, but also a hostile mood of the peasantry, dis-
satisfaction with these so-called selected seeds.

Alan: This is excellent, and I will do my very best. 

VYSHINSKY: What was the nature of your criminal activities in the People's
Commissariat of Agriculture of the R.S.F.S.R.?
ZUBAREV: Here my criminal activities consisted first of all in wrongly
planning the sowing of vegetables; in particular, little attention was
paid to the development of vegetable growing in our eastern districts,
where the developing of vegetable growing was of enormous importance...

Jennifer: I am learning so very hard here.

PEOPLE'S COMMISSARIAT OF JUSTICE OF THE U.S.S.R. REPORT OF COURT PROCEED-
INGS IN THE CASE OF THE ANTI-SOVIET "BLOC OF RIGHTS AND TROTSKYITES" Heard
Before the MILITARY COLLEGIUM OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S.S.R. Moscow,
March 2-13, VERBATIM REPORT, Published by the PEOPLE'S COMMISSARIAT OF
JUSTICE OF THE U.S.S.R. MOSCOW 1938.

Jennifer, Julu, and Nikuko applaud.  
All three together: This is wonderful!

VYSHINSKY: How matters stood with butter, this is of interest to me at
this stage of the investigation. You have spoken of salt, of sugar, how
you held back these commodities from sale to the population by sabotage,
etc. But how did matters stand with butter?
ZELENSKY: We don't sell butter in the rural districts.
VYSHINSKY: I am not asking you what you sell. You were above all selling
the main thing - your country...

Alan: I see how this goes. This is amazing. They have been found out, and
it is clear at the very end that the wreckers are executed. Nothing could
be clearer. One must be at the service of one's country.

LEVIN: ...Gorky loved fire, flames, and we made use of this. A bonfire
would be lit up for him. Just when Gorky would feel the fatigue after his
work, all the chopped branches were gathered together, and a flame kind-
led. Gorky would stand near this bonfire, it was hot there, and all this
had a harmful effect on his health... ...And in fact, on the second or
third day after his arrival in this grippe-infected house, Gorky fell sick
with the grippe. This was soon complicated by croupous pneumonia and imme-
diately took a serious turn. Nonetheless, Professor Pletnev and I consid-
ered that the plan we had drawn up must be carried through, and that for
this purpose use must be made of medicines which would be harmful to him.

Julu: Oh oh, that is so awful! This is such an awful thing! I cannot be-
lieve how awful this is!

THE PRESIDENT: As regards wrecking work, that it was necessary to bring
about a decrease in the number of livestock.
RYKOV: Even more than that. These instructions, as Goloded said, were duly
received from the poles...

Jennifer: Oh! Oh! Oh! Attacks from every side! 
Nikuko: Oh! Woe! Attacks from within and without!

KRESTINSKY: ...Further Trotsky developed the idea of the necessity of ter-
rorism, wrecking activities and diversions. In speaking of them, Trotsky
considered diversionist acts and acts of terrorism from the point of view
both of applying them in time of war for the purpose of disorganizing the
defensive capacity of the Red Army, for disorganizing the government by
the moment of the coup d'etat, and at the same time, these diversionist
and terrorist acts would make his, Trotsky's, position stronger and would
give him more confidence in his negotiations with foreign governments, be-
cause he would be able to refer to the fact that his followers in the Sov-
iet Union were both sufficiently strong and sufficiently active...

Julu: Oh dearest us! How awful is Trotsky! Something must be done and now!
There are foes on every side! There are foes inside and out!

KAKAZOV: ...Now when I stand before you, Citizens Judges, as the murderer
of Menzhinsky, I cannot help shuddering and being overcome with horror
when I think of the despicable crime into which I was dragged. Not for a
minute do I want to disclaim the blame for this crime. On the contrary I
want to repent of this crime to the end and rid myself of this nightmare.

Alan: Oh curses on Kakazov for his perfidious crime! To death with perfid-
ious Kakazov!

On the basis of the aforesaid, and guided by Articles 319 and 320 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure of the R.S.F.S.R., The Military Collegium of
the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. Sentences...[list of 18 men]...to the
supreme penalty - to be shot, with the confiscation of all their personal
property.

All: Oh we are saved from the wrecking and saboteurs of our country! Death
to the traitors! Death to the BLOC OF RIGHTS AND TROTSKYITES! Death to the
Jews!

Nikuko: This is a wonderful play, Ladies and Gentlemen, and we hope you
have enjoyed it. We have given you much to think on, because the truth,
which is always difficult, is the best play in the world! Please take care
on your way out! Thank you!

KIM IL SUNG: Hello, I am a member of the audience and I am very happy to
see this play. If more countries, even though small, pool their strength
and fight resolutely against imperialism, the peoples can knock down U.S.
imperialism with decisively overwhelming power on each and every front.
The people of every country making revolution should tear limbs off the
U.S. beast all over the world and behead it. The U.S. imperialists appear
to be strong, but when the peoples of many countries attack them from all
sides and join in mutilating them in that way, they will become impotent
and bite the dust in the end.

Jennifer: But oh Great Leader, what is to be done?

KIM IL SUNG: Hello, Our Party will fight against Right and 'Left' oppor-
tunism, while upholding the banner of unity.

Julu: Oh that is so good, we will drag down the renegades of the revolu-
tion!

PRESIDENT AND KIM IL SUNG: Yes, ABSOLUTEly!

All Laugh!

Exeunt Omnes.

The Curtain Rises

JENNIFER: I beg pardon for the horrible crimes I have committed against my
beloved Julu, having carefully prepared for her death, wrecking her diet,
sabotaging her asthmatic medications. I cannot sleep at night, recognizing
the misery I have caused the State; I can only hope that my punishment of
death will deter future generations from murder and mayhem.

JULU: I am of course alive, Jennifer, what ever are you talking about?

JENNIFER: Julu's corpse is here before us: Poor, poor Julu! My misery
knows no bounds; for the next several months, I will live grieving for my
beloved Julu, realizing I can never atone for my hideous crimes against
her, and through her, against the very State, my beloved Country, itself.

JULU: Jennifer, will you stop that? This is silly and besides, you're be-
ginning to scare me!

JENNIFER: My guilt is aggravated by the fact that I for a long time de-
ceived my Country, betrayed the confidence placed in me; I wormed my way
into Julu's dearest graces. I need hardly mention that I repent, that my
repentance does no good at all. The proof of my repentance is my exposure
here in the broadest light of day, for the benefit of my Country, which
has been deprived of my dearest Julu.

JULU: Please, Jennifer, come with me! This is getting ridiculous - you
have done nothing, I'm quite well, thank you, and right in front of you.
Are you crazy?

JENNIFER: Disgraced, thrown in the dust, leaving life, I want to recount
my sad, tragic career, which should serve as a lesson for those who mur-
der and commit mayhem, as I have done against my beautiful Julu. But what
is there to recount? Only our friendship together and our service to our
State and Country and my disgraceful behavior towards her. I have no de-
fense whatsoever, and for just a millionth part of my crimes, for even
thinking through "the criminal imagination," I should be sentenced to
death. I have committed heinous crimes and realize this and it is hard to
live after such crimes. I do not want to sit in prison for tens of years!

JULU: You have gone mad! You have been reading too many novels! You have
been believing too many lies! Look at me! I am alive before you! Jennifer,
it's me, Julu! Jennifer! Jennifer!

JENNIFER: Years weigh heavily on me with the nightmare of the crimes which
I have committed, and by this sincere repentance, I admit everything, want
to rid myself of my nightmare. I never thought I would become a criminal.
It is hard for me to talk of my crime, because as a friend, my calling has
been to help Julu, not to harm her. I blackened the calling of a friend,
and trampled on the most valuable thing, the bond between us. I became a
murderer because I hastened dearest Julu's death, when she was in the
prime of life, her only problem that of asthmatic medications. I now beg
you to sentence me to the death I so richly deserve.

THE COURT: Jennifer, in the name of the commission duly entrusted to us -

JULU: JENNIFER!! JENNIFER!!

through me. I like the words, though, in any order. The order doesn't
matter.

Jennifer: THE PRESIDENT says the order doesn't matter.

THE PRESIDENT: I am perfectly powerful; my power is splintered, broken,
which gives me power. I have more power than ever. My power grows.

Jennifer: You are a duly elected official.

THE PRESIDENT: The term is decided only by the term. I am THE PRESIDENT
outliving the term.

THE THEATER: Roar.

Jennifer: You are a duly elected official only for the term. But the term
is yours and you extend it.

THE PRESIDENT: I am your tongue. Your tongue takes care of your eyes. I am
your tongue. I am your lips. I am your mouth.

THE THEATER: I'm going home.

       #           #       #said; jump, and we'll make it ok

FROM THE BACKBONES OF YOURS


It goes so wide, it's difficult to focus. It opens up so that the rim is
on one side and the rim is on the other. I drive so far across and there
are always rims and always equidistant. Like a halo or an aura around me,
the horizon, for which I recognize the Sign. So what I mean is, what the
road is, it goes with you. So what could be wider: the bark on the thick
stem or my desire to reproduce? So where am I traveling when I am situated
in the midst of rims?

Donald Knuth: "a _truly random sequence will exhibit local nonrandomness._
Local nonrandomness is necessary in some applications, but it is disas-
terous in others. We are forced to conclude that no sequence of 'random'
numbers can be adequate for every application. In a similar vein, one may
argue that there is no way to judge whether a _finite_ sequence is random
or not; any particular sequence is just as likely as any other one."

My writing veers through tired Jennifer, exhausted Nikuko, worn-out Julu,
myself always already on the verge. Names flood and pool; it's another
"Jennifer-piece" at this point, not an edge that cuts through language,
basking in the wound beneath the surface. It's another "Julu-piece" at the
moment, the wound or dismemberment sloughed in the crystal of the screen.
To read, says Nikuko in the "Nikuko-piece," you must begin anew, slice
across the surface of your eyes, SEE LARGE WITHOUT THE LENS. For the lens
already edits the text of the world you know, and the truth lies in the
empty socket, the rim our horizon, the cut tongue drying on the ground. We
are all THE PRESIDENT because we all rule the world, even those desperate
and dying in the last forgotten jail.

On Number-Systems


"And reading Knuth on number-base systems which include, for example a
ternary system with +1, -1, and 0 as the symbols. Such systems can absorb
the positive and negative numbers; there are others, such as ones based on
2i, that can absorb the complex number system as well (i.e. a single num-
ber of the form ax^n + bx^(n-1) ... +dx^1 +e). This is an amazing economy
of means. The book is my favorite in the Knuth programming series - the
volume on Seminumerical Algorithms - since it goes into the construct of
arithmetic processes and algorithms we all take for granted. In my own
work, I've always been fascinated by the possibility of base-1 and base-
infinity systems; in the former, of course, addition becomes concatena-
tion, and in the latter, the addition of any two unique symbols results in
a third, i.e. J + K = L. There's an easy translation from the decimal sys-
tem; say 25 * 26 = 650 - one would just look up within the infinite multi-
plication table, [25] and [26] and see [650] where the [x] represents the
unique symbol. One goes from algorithms to infinite memorization or look-
up. The phenomenology of this is really interesting, I think. For multip-
lication with base-1, one returns again to concatenation, for example 1111
* 111 = 111 111 111 111 which is the same as 4 * 3 = 12. There's nothing
to learn in terms of memorization or lookup tables here; there's nothing
to look up or memorize. Think of this as an infinite abacus of sticks
placed in a single row; one moves from base-infinity with its pure economy
of place and infinite symbols, to base-one with its pure economy of symbol
and infinite place. This material is fascinating; it says something about
the stability of the world itself, the Aristotelian logic at the heart of
the almost-disconnected plateau of the life-world. I wrote years ago ex-
tensively on such phenomenologies; it's great to see the structures them-
selves in Knuth."* To place sticks in the row, letters in a row, one
counts (literally) on the stability of place and demarcation - _these_
sticks are counted - _those_ remain unaccounted-for and uncounted. The
sticks need not be in a row; there's no need for geometry, positioning,
since what one is concerned with is the pure quantity of sticks, not a
positional relationship. Interestingly, positionality also disappears with
base-infinity, since every operation and quantity involves only _one_ pos-
ition. In The Matrix, there is considerable discussion about "who is the
One" - in base-one, everyone is, and in base-infinity, whatever is _there_
is the one.

What is going on here? On one hand, with base-one, there is the fact and
phenomenology of _substance_ and the quantifiability and stability of the
world; on the other, with base-infinity, there is the problematic of the
proper name in the Kripkean sense of rigid designator. In the former,
names shift towards processes; in the latter, processes harden as names.

One might also consider issues of perception: exactly what constitutes a
stick or a symbol? Could, for example, two trees represent 2541 and 1734,
a third representing 2541^1734 base-infinity? Is all of nature, in fact,
the mathematics of base-infinity write large? At the other end, what might
one say about typification, standardization: What constitutes a stick and
what doesn't? Sticks are related to tallying, of course; they are indexi-
cal in relation to the quantification of the real, a one-to-one relation-
ship with other physical objects. On the other hand one might consider the
base-infinity symbols both symbolic (standing-for quantity as proper names
or summarizations) and "quasi-ikonic," the coagulation of quantity itself
as unary.

And there are issues of memory: _Where_ is the place of counting - which
sticks have already been marked, which remain unmarked? This depends not
only on the stability of place, but our knowledge of place as well. Since
base-infinity relies on individuated symbols, place, even the place of
_announcement,_ becomes less relevant; memory of place is replaced by
symbol memory: 2541^1734 = [2541^1734]

Between base-one and base-infinity, the structure and variety of the world
appear - not the infinite and obdurate variety of base-infinity, nor the
pure quantifications of base-one, but gatherings, foreclosings, metaphors
and metonymies. It's at the limits that nature becomes simultaneously mute
and revelatory; in-between it's all culture and our image writ large,
rubbed against the structure of the world.

Word:  re-ers
Guess:
Sorry, the word was "refers"
Another word?

Azure's Love of Jennifer


"If the 19th century was, and I for one am thoroughly convinced that it
was, concerned with origins, then the present century is an era that has
increasingly looked for roots. A quest for origins and a search for roots
are not the same and not to be confused. The quest for origins focuses on
'whatness,' while the search for roots focuses on 'whoness.' The issue of
origins is typically centered around natural ancestry, and Darwin provided
the brand name for his age. In contrast, the quest for roots is essential-
ly concerned with probing a cultural heritage, defining the fibres of an
ethnicity, mapping ideational stratigraphies. The origins issue is charac-
teristically a biological matter, while that of roots is generally intel-
lectual in scope." (from Thomas Markey, welcome remarks to the Bellagio
conference, 1988, When Cultures Collide: The Indo-Europeans and Pre-Indo-
Europeans.) Thus said, when I seek for the origin of Jennifer, and I do, I
may look no farther than "Jennifer, Where are you?," a resonant film by
Leslie Thornton produced in 1981. But I may look likewise to my mother
Jennifer Sondheim, my daughter Jennifer Sondheim, my sister Jennifer Sond-
heim. I may look to my roots, my cultural heritage among the tribe of
Jennifers, who, like the tribe of Alans, wreaked havoc in Europe and the
British Isles. For Jennifer is neither root nor rhizome, but bundles and
sheaves of tendrils, glistening with moisture, sliding across lovers and
bodies, dreams and texts, words pouring out of mouths, tongues sliding in.
Think of the beautiful skein of the world in the form of tendril interlac-
ings; if the 1970s and 1980s were concerned with grids, the 1990s and
2000s are concerned with tendrils lazily pooling among wetware components,
as if there were shudderings across the webs and nets of meristemating
roots. Jennifer moves blindly among open cracks, holes, leaks, seepages in
the real and the programming of the real; the real moves blindly among her
openings as well. When my eyes are closed, when Azure is above me, when my
tongue devours her fluids, her skin, the delicacy of her eyes, when her
tongue devours my fluids, my skin, the delicacy of my eyes, it is the uni-
cellular layer of Jennifer that coheres the real between us, ensures our
return to language. Jennifer is the bruising of the world, its contusions,
as one moves clumsily among the things and thoughts of the world.

So how could she be the unicellular layer, tendrils, and bruisings, all at
once? Because it is the surface and the inscribing of the surface that
ruins the most; and it's the unicellular layer of Jennifer that defines
the space between us; and it's the tendrils of Jennifer which unicellular-
ly search out the crevices between my lover and myself; and it's the
bruising of my skin and breasts and necks that murmurs Jennifer! Jennifer;
and it's the unicellular layer of tendrils of Jennifer that mark our his-
tory on mattress, sheets, rooms, provinces, and worlds of my love and me;
and it's "JENNIFER!" Azure cries in her sleep, her naked body reaching out
everywhere in the room, looking for imaginary origins, shattering imagin-
ary roots.

Being, from Yours


It's always a mode of brambles and thistles
across the highways down near the stream bends
where mending the gorse from one to the other
side against side and moss against moss
you might find one who leaves, you might find a new one
you might find an older, you might find the eldest
there it would be, the bark on the knolls
of the knots or the knobs of the trees and their roots
always searching for origin, the race lost among us
always looking for roots, look ye no further
one mends from the gorse against the dark stream
from brambles and thistles, one makes the dark jerkin
from gorse comes the shoes, from gorse comes the jacket
ice forms on the rocks, the trees hide the origin
the race lost among us, the roots of all Being
look for jacket by stream-side, gorse in the down-stream
Being you'll find there, the Being of Being

		    THE SECRET CODON OF THE COSMOS


This has been discovered by taking all the primes from 999 to 9999 and
finding their REVERSE OCTAL EQUIVALENTS; the upper binary coding is then
stripped. The result is ASTOUNDING: THIS IS UNIVERSAL ORDER, inscribed
through the protocol of lower ASCII:

	'h)h3hAhWu u u#u)u7uAuG v v v!v9vCvIvii             )

Immediately, the relationship with DNA is evident; I take this to be the
PRIMORDIAL CODON FOR ALL LIFE. Embedded in our TCP/IP Protocol Suite, who
knows what NEW FORM OF INTELLIGENCE may be GENERATED?

One might enter this into the history for example of the T4 BACTERIOPHAGE
as well as the 1988 INTERNET WORM, observing its re/productive processes.

Investigations HAVE PROCEEDED, however; below is part of the SEQUENCE OF
PRIMES from 10000 to 100000 in REVERSE OCTAL EQUIVALENTS. The RICHNESS OF
this text is UNPARALLELED; even though I have INTERMITTENTLY TRUNCATED the
result, our PATTERNING IS CLEAR ENOUGH:

the great codon and the dance of kings and queens


this is the dance of kings and queens to be solemnly spoken as significant
form: 

p'ugoo oo 'oo uvuepoo pusfoo eboo deoo w`weaefboo wuttuboo vbabeacoo tvuoo
d ecoo boo euvfoo pdudoo uaoo wgewoo wufoo adadeteudoo aeagaoo uoo tediv-
too coo pediv tguewoo aweeducubvruegueoo wcoo wudfeoo wbaeoo fcoo oo aoo
foo bewoo e'eaedoo e

writing the desire of the world, so vulnerable, so accessible, and how may
it be spoken or sung, how may it be written. we who dance the dance of
kings and queens are reminded for all time of the fullness of despair, of
the brilliant satiation of unfulled desire, the beautiful movements of the
transparency of code. so begin, in all earnestness, with these syllables
of magic and atmosphere, interpreting the dance of kings and queens, and
comprehending the great codon of our lives.

for the dance is a royal dance, carried out in slow and delicate measure,
and how beautiful it is, the participants dressed to their finest, their
silk sleeves and lower garments showing through with thrilling sheen. be-
neath the firelight torches soft skin glistens as well in stately move-
ment, the long hair of the queens swaying softly, the felt hats of the
kings bowed in low obeisance. the very signs and symbols of our lives are
wonderfully presented, and the spectacle, seen from early childhood on,
remains with one throughout her entire life. all participate in such de-
light, and we are thankful for our tongues of beauty, our mouths of great
finesse, our lips of perfect pleasure, that we can murmur the syllables of
the great codon, for ourselves and our descendents.

on his return

in the midst of thick text
that everyone writes, making barriers,
setting traps where i'm coming,
arrows and staked pits where i'm crossing
the great writing, i keep dreaming, jennifer,
who returns from other pages, disks, entries,
who leaps across files, directories, machines,
as if one always began with jennifer the root,
jennifer always ready at the prompt and waiting,
or jennifer@jennifer.com and jennifer@jennifer.com 
,
her legs wrap around my throat at night,
she's naked, my tongue is swallowed, i inhale her,
there's nothing left of me and i want less than that,
she's on me, i breath her into me,
my lungs are full of blood from her,
my eyes are seeing read through her,
my eyes are eyes of jennifer,
i'm in her cunt, i'm coming into her,
coming through, and the dream of men in a forest,
my mouth speaking in tones of a woman, 
my breasts larger and swollen, i feed myself,
i'm alway naked, infant, i drool and topple,
hollow, where my cock was, i'm in a universe,
i am a universe,
maybe i can get some sleep tonight
,
jennifer coughs and spits me out her mouth, what's left,
i want less than that, i'm a carpet stain, 
buried in cloth
, 
today i was walking with azure in a subway tunnel, 
she said, the ceiling's low,
i said, that's the expression, but at least here and now,
it's the floor that's high

Yours, Poetics


In fumbling about the Poetics list, making a decision not to send my wri-
ting there for peace of mind, such as it is, at least for the time being,
I've also been thinking through definitions of "poetics," not in the trad-
itional sense, but in a broader sense, where I would want to place myself,
should or should not anyone care. Because I want to belong; because the
work and I belong in the world; because my world is in the world; because
the world is in the world. The Poetics list rarely considers hypertext or
other forms; its standard (if there is one) is that, perhaps, of Oulipo
or Jackson Maclow's experimentation, not Christy Sanford's or Miekal And's
or mine, or m9ndfukc.com's or Steve Duffy's or jodi.org's or even Kent
Johnson's - I feel lost among the _writers_ - I'm tired of defending my-
self - my work's fucked - it's always already at a loss - brilliant and
dead at the same time - 

What follows is an attempt at definition of a different poetics - which I
think to some extent these words inhabit - you'll find the text also at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim somewhere down in the Yours pages
- and comments welcome - 

"I think of poetics as looking at relationships among forms, phenomenolo-
gies, literatures, in relation to writing/ inscription on one hand, and
the body on the other. One might include the earth as well, and the foun-
dation of the earth or the articulation of logics and structures beneath
the surface of the earth. In other words, what happens when a mouth
speaks, when words resonate, when empathy and not equivalence is primary?
This is a far cry from the politics of poetics, from the poetics of liter-
ary form, from the tropologies, scansions, and stanza patterns of poetry,
although all these play a role. But one might ask as well, within the body
of poetics, how does number play the world? How does the speaking of num-
ber align the body? How are body and world in relation to fundamental
structures of the real, such as the classical Umwelt with its things that
mostly retain shape, with its identities and typologies, with its Boolean
logics? And one might also ask, within poetics, about the relation of mu-
sic to the body, to speech, to the history of being-human. Poetics in this
sense brings everything into play, from cognitive psychology and neuro-
physiology to the mathesis of the real, and the dreaming of the body, of
the mind, and all terms wavering in the midst of the worlds murmurs and
sounds."

One might ask the style of the world, one might ask its breathing -

Smart Poem Remains Forever


Here I'm writing a poem.
This line's under the first.
The lines stick on the page.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
It's the beginning of graphics.
There's space to the right of the lines.
There's space above and below.
You've got to give space to the poem.
It feels like meat on the bones.
But it doesn't move; it lies here.
It's already a corpse to cry about.
WAAA! WAAA! The corpse of the poem.
It's good to write death about death.
Our lives are from earth to earth.

Here I'm continuing the poem.
This stanza's under the first.
The stanzas stick out on the page.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
Look at the shape of the stanzas. 
There's a bit of a shape, not too much.
Byron's Don Juan has shape.
The Ancient Mariner has shape.
Sometimes the poem spreads out.
It thinks the page is a body.
It lies there dead on the page.
Chuff chuff says the poet's breath.
Rereading the line, I keep breathing.

I want a poem that leaps off the 
page and continues when the voice stops.
I think the poem will be a good 
imitator, life won't go on as before.
It will sound and shudder, speak back, 
jump, clawing your neck. It travels 
thousands of miles in broken packets
machinery has to put together in 
order for it to return to the condition
of the poem, and even then something 
else might happen, a letter leaving, 
image heaving.

Where are the broken poems that keep
breaking?

There's a dampness to lines of poetry.
They seethe into the page.
Think of Bishop Gavin's translation.
Something's crying to continue!
Who could be under the stones?
What's the map in the foam of the surf?
It just sits there. Poems are great markers
Of the human condition and the times we are
living in.
Inside the book, they face each other
all the times.


_________________________________________________


and letters


letters fall over and lie there as well. 
if this had been a book, you would have read this long ago.
the pages, yours, letters swollen, loving your mouth.
the grist of letters among protrusions of the flesh.

all letters sing only of sex and death.
love appears along their splines or embrochures.
it is the ancient science of letters.
never confuse this with material or spiritual wealth.

letters survive and murmur and couple and mourn.
letters need nothing, not even our speaking and writing.
the page is a trap is a cemetery is a constant death.
letters burn black fire white smoke in sullen truths of skies.

what we see is their death, what we know, their death.
nothing of their song or the spike of them in tongue.
your mouth gets in the way, they don't want to leave.
our lives are seduced by each and every page.

letters, leave us.
letters, leave us.


_________________________________________________________________


wanting to move the panorama, and the fields of dawn and dusk,
into the realm of eternal night, where there are killings
gone underground or bomb-blast night in the dark distance,
shattered hard and splintered, against icons raging in the desktop sky -
there's knowledge in thickets, someone is hanging there -

for a moment humans shrink earths and worlds, planets and moons,
and for a second a single shaft of sunlight makes us beg - 
that a savior will come, or a plague or pure annihilation -

i compress the panorama, place it in my pocket, harden it -
it's a thing of memory, i'm hiding down there in the thickets -
you won't ever find me, there's more than one body -
they're in the trees, swaying - they're on the side of the road,
they're a comfort to me, i lie among them -

in the distance, a voice - who is hanging there?

ballet


"some might comment 'what fun!' - disregarding the years of toil attached
to these delightful ppowers. some might answer with a sigh: 'that would
bbe a dream,' and here, indeed, we have the more realistic apppproach of
the two. the secret of the realisation of the dream is that it must bbbe a
vision which can also bbbe pperceived bbby an audience."

i am wearing the grown-ups' bodice with eight panels on the basque, oh so
pretty pretty, my young breasts do swell, i do not wear the babies' bodice
with two panels on the basque, oh so lovely ballet i will look?

sur les pointes d'avignon i will dance and fall off my tiny little bridge
on my tiny little feet, my tape backing for beauty-ribbons and extra
darning to hold my tiny little toes in place!

and i will rise up on my toes
and i will rise up on my toes

and the corded ribbon will hold my tiny feet in place, and the shoe may
break where my sole touches the pure pure air as i balance on my extra
extra darning!

and i will rise up on my toes
and i will rise up on my toes

and my tutu rises from my panties and breathes in and out of me, and the
extra frills, the extra frills hold swollen from the basque, so very
swollen

oh the seven inch frill, and the six inch frill, the frill of the lovely
fifth, and the fourth inch frill, and oh! the frill of the two and a half
inches, and comfort frill one of the one and a half!

and i have earned my tutu and my lower lips are shaved
and i have earned my tutu and my lower lips are shaved

rafique, i will glide effortlessly into your hands!
jonathan, you will raise me on your fingers!

and adam will lift me higher than anyone, my frills above him, his thin
palm against my lower lips! and eve will caress me, my black lashes wet
with tears that never show! 

for this work looks effortless, but takes the greatest labor
for this work looks easy, but believe you me it's hard

one day i will rise up
one day i will rise up

my toes will leave the ground
my toes will leave the ground

les noces

 
late at night. you have taken your tutu off, your slippers as well. i'm a
long way from home. say something about the motel rooms, one-night stands.
whiskey on the table, god it's as if you can't dance another step. what's
holding me here. 

(pauses) i'm a slave to alan, that's what you am. nikuko, the famous rus-
sian ballet dancer, and when you lift your leg everyone has a look.

(alan) that's what we bargained for in st. petersburg. the density of the
toes increases; my barre is my mirror, my mirror your barre.

(drinks) the bar over the sign negates it. 

(developpes a la barre en croix) 

(battements sur le cou-de-pied) lousy drink. the line is 'rise up' anyway.
'rise up to show them.' they saw everything all right.

(alan) that's what they're paying for. i could do a grand jete en tournant
for all they care. as long as i get from one place to another. as long as
i show them some leg.

(nikuko) the ambassador is coming. you can't be naked enough.

(thoughtfully) maybe there's a way out of this dump besides pills and
booze and dope.

(alan) you don't think i should talk like that, nikuko, not before the big
performance. it's not that. it's like this. i'll raise your leg, i'll wear
perfume. just the kind he likes. you read it in comme des garcons.

(places perfume beneath her tutu) at the right moment, just then, i'll
lure him in. this is your silver bullet. look out there, nothing but dust
and tumbleweed. we can't even grow wheat, nothing. sheep would die. all
we've got is ballet.

(alan) try it and you'll see. i can let yourself out as far as you'd like.
i'm right behind you. stop smoking. someone might see you, then there's
the odor.

(pauses) i sure am pretty tonight.

(nikuko) i'm in your best form, the ambassador's waiting for me at the
door. i'm naked under the ruffles. he'll buy your freedom and maybe i'll
buy yours.

(alan) what do i mean maybe. 

(nikuko) i'm thinking you got to get as far from here as you can. the
ambassador will take me with him. i'll have him naked before the ballet's
over. one more pas de poisson, that's all it will take.

(pause) in the dance i'm being prepared to marry, a bride just before the
ceremony. i'll comb your hair. i'll put your dress on, slowly, move your
hands up your body. your body will shimmer and shudder.

(alan) just like a model. 

(pause) i am a model. you're it, you're the it girl. i can't lose. have
another drink; you hear horses outside.

(sounds of guns) the revolution is just a few miles away.

(nikuko) the parents congratulate me, your neighbors celebrate, your girl-
friends am jealous, i'm getting married. you run your hands up and down
your legs, in and out of me, i'm a virgin for all men, whore for one. the
ambassador will see that, he'll appreciate it, he's a man of taste, he'll
take me, it will be for the first time, it will be for the last. then
there's the ceremony.

(shots heard nearer) then i'll. 

(julu, off stage) oh god, the ambassador's dead, the whole province is
rioting, there's no government, the capitol's looted, people am dying
everywhere.

(nikuko) i'll dance the best dance of your career.

(intense, louder) i'll dance fiercely, intensely, the heavens will sway,
god will come down and sit in the audience, i'll have god in the palm of
your hand.

(alan) nikuko, nikuko.

(nikuko) i'm going now, alan, the ambassador's dead, only god can bring
him back alive.

(sound of gunshots) 

(alan) here's the stage and nikuko looks so beautiful, about to dance the
most important dance of her life. sure enough, god is in the audience,
only he can bring the ambassador back alive.

(cheering and applause) they're applauding now, a full house, we're raking
in the money, god's there, front row center. nikuko's beginning her dance.

(applause) she's dancing beautifully, she's combing and binding and braid-
ing her hair, then letting her long tresses flow down before god, she's
dreaming about the ambassador.

(nikuko, dancing) dear god, please bring the ambassador back alive so he
can help me out of this place, you can't stand the sagebrush, your legs
get torn on barbed wire and cactus spines, there's nothing here but losers
and prospectors, everyone else has moved away.

(nikuko's grand battement, she continues talking) look god, i can see up
your cunt, i can smell your deliberate scent, your perfume enraptures you,
i forget you're creating and destroying worlds, you're salivating, you're
erect, you can see my penis hardening in my pants, you're staring up me, i
want me so bad. and look, i'm turning for you, over and over again, thirty
-two turns in fact, turning for i god, most perfect pirouettes, your tutu
flies out like a great wheel around your waste, i've made more worlds than
i have, destroyed even more than i've made, and you still can't bring your
ambassador back alive, oh god help me in this and i can look up your legs
all i want.

(applause) 

(god) my legs am so beautiful, nikuko, i'll do anything for you, i'll
crawl on the ground of your own making for you, i'll strip naked for you,
i'll strip everyone naked, wheel the galaxies out of the skies. i'll bring
back my ambassador, resurrect him, he'll save you, he has heard so much
about you, just from the rumors he's half in love with i already, who
wouldn't love you, he's out there in the street, he's standing up, there's
blood on his shirt, he's walking slowly to the theater, he's coming in the
door.

(happens as said) 

(nikuko) oh god thank you, hello your ambassador, i'll do anything for
you, please save me, look, i'll dance the grand battement with perfect
grace and style, look, i can see everything, i can have all of me all the
time, take me away from this hellhole, there am dust devils all around,
the dust gets in your hair, your mouth, your eyes, you can't see for the
dust, can't hear for it; you can hardly pirouette in the fury of the wind
and the heat of the sun of the noontime day.

(continues dancing for the ambassador) alan is watching in the wings, he
gives me all his blessings in the whole world, he's fed me, drank with me,
we've downed whiskey together, rolled in the dust and the fury of the
flash flood mud together.

(ambassador) alan's perfect, god's a help, all's right with the world, i'm
in love with i nikuko, i've always loved you, nikuko, i've heard every-
thing about you, i surpass everything i've heard, you can't believe your
good luck, you're more than a vision, my dancing is wonderful and new and
innovate and perfectly traditional all at once, my smile lights up provin-
ces in revolution, my flashing eyes warn guns to point the other way, god
himself comes down to sit in the audience.

(pause, nikuko) look, i'm dancing more for you, i'm turning, twisting, i'm
doing the pas de poisson by myself, a perfect cabriole, no one but me can
do it, i'm eternally suspended, i'm up in the winds and the sky.

(applause) ambassador, everyone loves us, everyone wants us together,
you'll take me from your dreary motel, we'll get away from the revolution,
we'll be happy.

(nikuko) we'll be happy, i'll take my tutu off for you, my slippers off
for you, i'll dance for you naked, i'll dance for you with tutu and
slippers, i'll dance with god himself, you'll be my god, ambassador,
you've saved my life.

(ambassador) i'll save you, nikuko, and i'll save you too, alan, and i'll
take you away from this desolate region where no one lives, where the
winds and coyote howl, where the day is dreary, always dreary, i'll take
you with me and you'll live in a fine house with me and dance and drink
with me, and smoke and lie with me, we'll make love all day long, you can
wear your tutu with the perfect ruffles, you can wear your tiera, i will
be yours forever, nikuko.

(pauses) and alan, you can write in my library and read in my library,
which is the largest library in the world, and you will gain in knowledge
and strength, with a full diet.

(bows and pauses)

(alan and nikuko) we thank you ambassador, and above all

(smiling) we thank god.

(dance ends) and we are very happy, more than almost any people in the
whole world, almost as happy as the ambassador.

there is no ROUSSEAU in ROUSSEAU; ROUSSEAU grapples and greps ROUSSEAU,
toadler:*:3850:99:todd bROUS:/net/u/6/t/toadler:/usr/local/bin/tcsh alone
appears for cat /etc/passwd | grep ROUS, the EAU turning later on, along
comEAU:*:1682:99:greg comEAU:/net/u/12/c/comEAU:/usr/local/bin/ksh
darren:*:4507:99:darren fieulletEAU:/net/u/6/d/darren:/usr/local/bin/ksh
damfino:*:11627:99:robert deverEAUx:/net/u/17/d/damfino:/usr/local/bin/zsh
bEAUgard:*:16637:99:ed bEAUgard:/net/u/1/b/bEAUgard:/usr/local/bin/bash
and we forget the other cat/etc/passwd | grep s, the other _s_ or the _s
of the other,_ there is no place for it; it remains sightless: ROUS s EAU,
one remove from the water. there is no reason in ROUSSEAU; ROUSSEAU shakes
ROUSSEAU in sleep, what murmurs! what songs -

ROUSSEAU can't find him anywhere!
ROUSSEAU can't find me anywhere!
ROUSSEAU can't find her anywhere!
ROUSSEAU can't find you anywhere!

There's no ROUSSEAU in ROUSSEAU; the word takes a walk. Reveries: Late in
the afternoon when the village is half-asleep and only the forge of the
blacksmith sounds outside my door, I walk out into the world, and no one
cares. Were my ideas more of a poverty, were my thought itself disgraced,
there would be no one to blame but myself; now, however, I find myself in
doubt of everyone, and it is only during the hours of sleep that I become
a boon companion.

Oh ROUSSEAU of no ROUSSEAU, to whom do you talk! I love to listen, cradle
your book against my naked breast, my milk nursing your poor chapped mouth
and eager lips. ROUSSEAU is no ROUSSEAU, broken and dispersed among the
password files ranged across machines; the social contract has long been
abandoned in favor of the rustle of bytes and nibbles. The whole world is
hungry for the pure liquid of your thought. Let me flow through you,
resurrect you! The world needs your walking limbs! The world needs your
tongue!

There is no ROUSSEAU in ROUSSEAU. There are no survivors.
