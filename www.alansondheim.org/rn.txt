(I prepared this for a digital archive of my work at Cornell University;
it might be of interest since it gives a reasonable overview of my work.
I had a great deal of difficulty trying to make 'sense' of what I do -
there are gaps and omissions, for which I beg forgiveness, but the basic
structure is present. Thanks for looking. Hopefully this description 
will be accepted and functional at Cornell; I need to continue my life
in quiet and mostly hidden ways. - Alan.)


ALAN SONDHEIM: DIGITAL WORK ARCHIVE

ORIGINAL AND ADDITIONAL ARCHIVE


Guide to the Digital Archive (prepared for Cornell University)


The LaCie Setup directory should be ignored. The TEXTINDEX directory
is used for searching for particular files. The search syntax is
accessed by the AstroGrep.exe application, which is more or less
self-explanatory. If you want to find a description for ennui.mov,
for example, you would search in TEXTINDEX\ for "ennui.mov"; you would
then use a standard Windows or Mac application like Notepad to search
within the particular file. Not all files are indexed, but many are.
Note that AstroGrep behaves pretty much like the grep command in unix;
there are other Windows- or Mac- based programs that will do the same.
This program is one of the best ways to 'feel' the organization of
the directories on the hard drives. However, nothing is perfect, and
unfortunately there are orphaned files as well; if there is one that
you need information about, please contact me (contact information
below), give me the name, date, and directory of the file, and I'll
do my best to help you.

There are two top-level directories - one for this hard drive, and 
one for the earlier. The difference between them is only the date - 
so that the later 3DAR is 3DAR2 for example.

Here's a rough breakdown of the contents, in the order below:
3DAR - 3D imagery, video, raw files, and Augmented Reality files,
including animated gifs, as well as video and images.

5-11ONLINE-SNAP is a snapshot of my online alansondheim.org contents
as of May, 2011.

ALPINE contains most of the work done by the dancer/choreographer/
performer Foofwa d'Imobilite, with Azure Carter, myself, and dancer
Maud Liardon; it was shot in the Aletsch area of the Swiss Alps, as 
well as in Geneva and Pringy.

AUDIO contains all of the sound files, including the music files I've
made performering solo or with other musicians. There is also an online
archive at http://espdisk.com/alansondheim which is also accessible
through http://lounge.espdisk.com/ The files include other soundwork,
using shortwave or crystal or very low frequency radios, as well as a
vibration meter for detecting sub-audible vibrations in buildings.

AZIMAGE contains numerous images by, or related to, my partner and 
collaborator Azure Carter.

BACKGROUNDS includes mainly 'background' material, used in all sorts
of productions, ranging from Second Life performances and architecture
(often involving strange texture-mapping), to 'inspirational' material
for cultural work.

COURSES includes the materials I've used in course-work, teaching at
a number of institutions, from Brown University through the New 
School, Florida International University, and School of Visual Arts,
among others.

FLOPPY includes work on older floppy disks.

FOOFWA includes the heart of the collaborations with Foofwa d'Imobilite,
Azure Carter, and myself; these include video, still, and audio pieces,
as well as dance performances in Switzerland, New York, Rhode Island,
and elsewhere. A great deal of the work has been shown across Europe
and the United States.

GEOGRAPHIC is a very large category that includes images I took in 
resonances with places, ranging from the Great Salt Lake and Antelope 
Island, to the Everglades, Hunting Beach in California, Aurora and 
Denver in Colorado, Switzerland, Canada, and trips across the United
States (often involved with locating 'quiet zones' for very low 
frequency radio recording), and so forth. These images are shown by
themselves, used for texture-mapping and inspiration, used for study-
ing landforms and wilderness, and so forth.

HTML are small pieces written in early html, sometimes using Visual
Basic as well; they're interactive for the most part and self-
explanatory.

MOCAP began with the Virtual Environments Laboratory at West Virginia
University, through Frances van Scoy and Sandy Baldwin, and includes
a vast array of experimental work done with motion capture equipment;
the software interface was rewritten for this. I late worked at Columbia
College in Chicago, extended my mocap experimentation with dancers; this
was through Patrick Lichty. The resulting files were used for creating
and studying 'alien' behavior, using Poser mannequins, abstract avatars
created through Blender, and abstracted/bizarre avatars in the virtual 
world Second Life. 

OLDERSAMPLER is related to SAMPLER2 in the second hard-drive; both 
present earlier work that was formally presented on DVDs at the time.
They were meant to be self-contained.

PARAB was a collaboration made largely at the Experimental Television
Center in Owego, New York, among Foofwa, Azure, and myself; its back-
bone is a text I wrote, The Parables of Nikuko, which was published
as a chapbook by Peter Ganick's Potes and Poets Press. I was influenced
by early Japanese literature, particularly the Kojiki, which forms the
mythological background. At this time, and shortly after, I was making
a number of cd-roms, each more or less themed; these later expanded
to DVDs, and now, sets of DVDs - for example, we've been working on a 
set of the Alpine pieces described above.

PDF includes a fairly large library of PDF files I've collected over
the years and used for my own theoretical and cultural work.

PERFORMANCE includes materials related to the large number of perfor-
mances I've been involved in, including mixed-reality, Second Life,
dance and choreography, music and sound, reading, and laptop. As with
many of the categories in the Archive, PERFORMANCE blurs into ALPINE
and PARAB, as well as FOOFWA, SEXUALITY, and SL. For this reason, there
is some repetition of files, but in the long run, I decided this wasn't 
a problem if pieces were multiply-accessed.

PERSONAL is a complex category, and includes images and videos, etc.
that generally wouldn't be exhibited as such. They include materials
related to the death of my parents, personal memorials and celebrations,
and so forth. They include a lot of material on my background as well,
including images that might have gone into GEOGRAPHIC for example.
These works might not be indexed through the search function.

PUBLICATION relates to materials that have been, or might be, published
- works that have been 'prepared' for publication, for better or worse.
I should mention that a fair amount of the Internet Text (see TEXTS)
has come out in magazine, zine, online magazine, chapbook, online
publish-on-demand book, or standard book, form; for me, this involves a
regathering/re-editing of materials for that purpose. The works break
down into several categories, ranging from theory, to phenomenology of
the virtual, analog and digital phenomenologies, philosophies of 
electronic literatures, experimental writings and plays, and so forth.
Again, the categories are sloppy.


There is one restricted directory which should only be viewed with care:

SEXUALITY: Work that contains explicit images or nudity; this should only
be seem and accessed in-house. No files from this directory should be
duplicated. The directory includes a great deal of work created at the
Experimental Television Center in Owego, NY; much of this was created with
Vea Lucca and Foofwa d'Imobilite, over a number of years. This directory
includes all nude images, whether sexual or not. There are a number of
dance and other performance works here, including Trilby, which was shown
at the Rotterdam Film Festival; and Evam and Crepuscule, which have been
shown at a number of venues in Europe.

SL is a large directory, containing all the work pursuant to my pieces
in Second Life. The pieces fall into three blurred categories: working
with modified avatars and 'distorted' avatar behaviors (see MOCAP for
their original, as we as 3DAR); architectures and architectural struc-
tures which involve 'alien' phenomenologies and modes of avatar move-
ment involving constant negotation of the spaces; and performances,
often with Sandy Baldwin or Foofwa d'Imobilite, using all of these
elements together, in combination with textual work (related directly
to experimental electronic literature), and mixed reality technologies.
Much of my focus has been here, dealing with issues of language, death,
sexuality, pain, and 'wounding' in the virtual, and their relation to
the viewing or participating subject. Much of this work was the focus
of my Eyebeam Art + Technology Center residency in New York this past 
year, from September 2011 to March 2012.

STILLS are just that - still images that are stand-alone pieces, or
sequences, that I didn't feel fell into any other category.

TALKSETC are notes in relation to seminars, conferences, or talks -
it's a somewhat miscellaneous category.

TEXTS is a main category; these are, for the most part, sections of
the Internet Text, a continuous meditation on the virtual and the 
real, which I have been engaged in since 1994. The texts also contain
descriptions of the media files for the most part; the two are often
interrelated. In the Archive 2 hard drive, the TEXTINDEX directory can
be searched, as indicated above, with AstroGrep; TEXTS2 contains some 
additional texts, but these are addenda. In the first hard drive, from
August 3, 2011, below, the full TEXTS directory can be searched. Please
note there may well be subdirectories with personal textual material
that should not be quoted without permission. I wanted to make all of
this as open and useful as possible - hence, the inclusions. But I do
insist on discretion here. TEXTS and TEXTS2 also include separate
articles and other materials that weren't in the Internet Text, or are
in it as separate essays/pieces/experiments. For example, there is 
cstalk.rtf in TEXTS2, that constitutes a talk I gave at a computer
science department (I forget where), and the aden.rtf is a series of
notes on talks I gave last year through the invitation of Aden Evans,
to speak at Dartmouth. There are also 'reasembled compilations,' such
as the distillation text that brings together a number of works on 
pain - I've used it in various presentations, including one at the
Electronic Literature Organization Conference this year in Morgantown,
West Virginia.

TRACE contains the files created when I was the second Virtual-Writer-
in-Residence for the trAce (sic) online writing community, headed by
Sue Thomas, and originating at Nottingham-Trent University. I held the
position over the millennium 'hinge' and worked on a number of 
projects, ranging from writing into and around 'student' production,
to creating two open pieces - a novel anyone could write into (I 
designed five 'strands' for this, and the result was multi-media),
as well as a piece called 'Lost' - in which participants listed things
or people they had lost; a long list appeared, separating the things
or people from the participants' names. Both were highly successful. 
I also organized a Traceroute Piece, with world-wide participation -
people did traceroutes of Internet connectivity over the 1999-2000
interval, when the Net was considered vulnerable (nothing really 
happened). The huge traceroute files documented the connectivity and
speed of router connections at the time.

Finally, VIDEO is just that - video pieces that don't fit into any
of the other categories, Some of these are in series; some of them
are stand-alone. As the years went by, the resolution gets better
and better, but some of the earliest works are some of the best.

In Archive2, there are two additional directories:

ELOCONF contains a number of files related to the ELO Conf. described
above. The panel I was Maria Damon, Sandy Baldwin, and myself, and 
dealt with the issues of pain etc. mentioned in the SL description 
(also above). The visuals include a set of hand-modified .obj files 
for 3D modeling that 'encapsulate' and distort mannequin figures.

EYEBEAM contains a huge number of files related to the research done
during the September-March residency (see SL above). These include a 
performance with Monika Weiss, and performances with Foofwa, Azure,
and Chris Diasparra (on baritone or tenor sax). The Foofwa performan-
ces extended over a week, with a final 'complete' performance on 
Saturday; during the week, we made a number of mixed-reality work 
using a Bambuser video account, Second Life, live dance and sound, 
and a stage/staging area where everything came together. Earlier on,
I did something similar during the Open Studio period. The files are
extensive. There were also a number of 3-d printed objects - mostly
distorted avatars - made during the residency; there are images of 
these - as well as a series of texts. I did a blog through the six
months which may be found at http://eyebeam.org/blogs/alansondheim .
The blog as a whole gives a good indication of my working methods, and
lists a number of pieces present on the hard drive. Please note that
some of the links had to be broken, since my online webpage is
commercial, and I have to keep limiting the size.

Two other things - when you explore the directories on both of the
hard drives, you'll find a fair number of video DVD files, including
one made with Kathy Acker, another dealing with Ciudad Juarez and so
forth. These are fairly self-explanatory, and with a little coaxing,
should run fine. You might have to download them onto a DVD disk or
computer, however.

Again, please note:

The archive is organized into twenty-five directories. There is some
duplication, and there are files that are difficult to place; for example
a dance performance might also reveal something about a landscape - it
might be placed, therefore, in FOOFWA, GEOGRAPHIC, or PERFORMANCE.

Azure's work may be accessed through http://azurecarter.weebly.com

Working Minds and Philosophy


http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/860 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/44forFahey.mp3 solo pipa
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/44forDydo.mp3 solo pipa

so the Dydo was the first; afterwards, I trimmed my nails and
created the Fahey. both are dedicated to musicians I admire.
the Dydo runs furiously across scales, techniques, melodic
fragments, looking for bases; in the Fahey, bases are found
and there are moments of song, towards the end. in both Mind
is heard directly: of that I'm sure, as sure as I am of a
form of fingering and hand and arm movement that allow these
structures to come forth - what's appearing is a kind of
thinking I can only call Philosophy, in any sense of the term,
I'd say first terms or terminologies, I'd say simultaneously
untoward and abject, simultaneously structured and analytical.
it's a different form of listening, a different forum of 
phenomenological analysis. I write this out of certainty.

W-boson's End

http://www.alansondheim.org/W-bosonend.jpg

"W bosons can decay to a lepton and neutrino or to an up-type quark and a 
down-type quark. The decay width of the W boson to a quark.antiquark pair 
is proportional to the corresponding squared CKM matrix element and the 
number of quark colours, NsubC = 3." (Wikipedia)

Towards the end everything breaks up, ruptures, reconstitutes. 
Muscles trembling, giving out, the hand readjusting, cramping.
Pains holding the rishi in place collapsing rhythms.
Fake rhythms taking their place in the midst of uncontrollable pauses.
Messaging of the body coming forth through unavoidable cosmos.
Seeing it here towards the end, then the ghost appearing.
Appearing and hungering, ghosting the strings of the oud.

__________________________________________________________________


From Alan Sondheim by way of Fung-Lin Hall by way of Alan Sondheim by
way of Netbehaviour:

"""I want to ask Jacques Derrida a question."

I want to ask Jacques Derrida a question.

It is question about death, not in particular his death.

But a question concerned with the aporia of death, not necessarily his
own.

Such a question, which would have been possible several years ago, is no
longer possible.

We are thrown back on the words of Jacques Derrida.

We are immured there.

It would have been simple: Jacques, here is what I want to know.

Do you have a minute of your time.

The body of Jacques Derrida still exists.

His body, phoric, carries the aporia.

The aporia is not his own, nor can he speak and return an unraveling.

Today, words are never set in stone, and questions go unanswered.

Today, questions disappear, and their occasion disappears.

The occasion of a question: a gap, as in a detective story.

As if the question were sutured by an answered, when in fact it is sutured
by any reply at all.

An answer responds to a question; a reply responds to the occasion of a
question.

I remember Jacques Derrida, and would have tapped him on the shoulder,
saying, excuse me, but ...

There is an image I have of this tapping: the softness of his jacket, the
slight giving away of the flesh beneath, and he turns towards me.

When I move my hands, everything is empty.

Jacques Derrida is a remnant of matter.

... "If death" ... "names the very irreplaceability of absolute
singularity (no one can die in my place or in the place of the other),
then all the _examples_ in the world can precisely illustrate this
singularity. Everyone's death, the death of all those who can say 'my
death,' is irreplaceable." ... (Derrida, Aporias)

When I move my hands: when my hands are moved for me, are only moved for
me: mise en scene, a scenario or occurrence, chora.

I do not collapse time, Jacques, in order to speak to you: I speak to
you.

I do not collapse space, in order to speak: I touch you lightly on your
shoulder, I wait until you turn around, your glance moves in my direction,
momentarily you are caught up in my gaze, you hesitate whether or not to
return your own, your reply to my question, you return such, as if such is
returned, an exchange of gifts or misrecognition.

Of the good, there is the edge of a knife, and the fall which surrounds
it; of the spoken, there is a comprehension, empathetic alignment, then
nothing.

Of the spoken, the knife edge separates the question I give to Jacques as
a gift, an awakening, and the reply which shatters after a particular
time, calculable, unattainable.

Of the question: all questions are a permanence: It is impossible to
answer a question.

Jacques turns; I look at his shoes. Thinking of Van Gogh, of Heidegger,
of Jacques Derrida, I take several photographs. They are remnants, indices
with lost referents; they are abject. I am silent; I say nothing to him,
to Van Gogh, to Heidegger. Repeatedly I raise the camera; eye-level, I aim
downward, towards an incalculable earth. The images, lost, are digital;
they never were. Between one pixel and another, a hole, precisely the
width of death.""

interaction and the very weak interaction. It is the work of my 
arms and my wrists, my hands and my fingers. They don't do this
forever. They lose the unconsciousness of the autonomic. They
begin to fray. The piece, like Zboson.mp3 or W+boson.mp3, is a
continuous fraying and a continuity that promises eternity: the
eternity of the digital, and the eternity of the infinitely-long
form. But this is the curtain and the harboring towards an end,
towards an end which is _the_ end, the only conceivable end. 
That Eye/I in the Tractatus closes for the last time. But listen
to this: that before the closure, it produced this residue, this
residue you will hear if you listen. And that was the work of a
being that had already reconstituted the future. And that is 
what these are about:

http://www.alansondheim.org/W+boson.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/W-boson.mp3

and what you may have already heard in the murmurs of my passing, 
in that future already reconstituted, already given, already
the strings of sarangi, sindhi sarangi, and oud, already silent.

Particle Jet of damn good music

A jet is a narrow cone of hadrons and other particles produced by the 
hadronization of a quark or gluon in a particle physics or heavy ion 
experiment. Because of QCD confinement, particles carrying a color charge, 
such as quarks, cannot exist in free form. Therefore they fragment into 
hadrons before they can be directly detected, becoming jets. These jets 
must be measured in a particle detector and studied in order to determine 
the properties of the original quark. (Wikipedia)

Carrie Ahern's Borrowed Prey

Carrie Ahern is a dancer and performer I met at Mount Tremper
a few years ago. She has recently completed and performed, at
Dickson's Farmstand Meats, Borrowed Prey, one of the most
interesting, and, I think, 'important,' works I've seen. The
piece, roughly an hour long, is concerned , among other
things, with animals, meat and the meat industry, and human
empathy or lack of it. I want to share the link with you and
hope you'll watch it. I wrote her an extended and favorable
reply, which I may send out in a while, but I feel you should
see this in its entirety on Vimeo without my interference.
In any case, please go to

Carrie Ahern   https://vimeo.com/42007072

and her website is http://www.carrieahern.com .

Thanks, Alan

Text to Carrie -

Hi Carrie, watching this now, slowly, and wanted to say a few things, that 
you're incredibly brave with this piece, which I'm not saying lightly. And 
it's both brilliant and harrowing, and for me, traumatic; Azure and I are 
vegan / vegetarian at this point, and your piece resonates that way. I'm 
not sure you're aware of recent research that shows that herd cows have 
complex social relationships, and friendships; they know when their 
friends are taken away and it puts them under considerable stress. There's 
indications that they know they're going to die. I know from ornithology 
that birds also have this sort of awareness. As far as chickens or other 
confined farm animals go, their lives are so determined by farmyards or 
feedlots of one sort or another, that their behavior is conditioned that 
way - if you look at wild and domestic turkeys for example, the former 
have a great deal of intelligence which the confined animals don't (this 
study was also performed on kittens, in one of the meanest 'experiments' 
around) - for myself, as feel as much empathy with a bird as I do with a 
mammal (you talk about this). Knowing the conditions of farm animals - 
very different from the "Old McDonald had a farm" fairy-tales when I grew 
up, and the pain/suffering they go through, I can't justify to myself 
eating them. You mention the research of Temple Brandin - she talks 
herself about being autistic and non-empathetic, and her description of 
animals follows suit - not their Weltanschauung, but their sensory 
modalities and what calms them. But what goes on otherwise, 
psychologically and culturally, is of a different order, and subtle - the 
research on cattle friendships for example is only recent, and only 
recently as well has it been recognized that birds are cultural (Azure's 
been formally studying ornithology). I'm just trying to explain why your 
piece resonates with me, horrifies me, and draws me in; I think it's one 
of the best performances I've ever seen, because it's life-changing, and I 
just want to end by thanking you for it - - Alan

Hi Carrie, I've finished, I found it harrowing. I'm from north-east 
Pennsylvania, where students got days off from school for the deer season. 
I've come across dead deer just left lying in the woods, all does, and I 
knew that the fawns would also be starving to death. There was also the 
ritual of first blood, but I never saw that personally. Killing was a real 
part of the culture. I couldn't stand it. I couldn't buy into the ideology 
that "hunters control deer" - when for millennia deer were controlled by 
the natural order of things. But the hunters got rid of the wolves and as 
you know there are even bear-hunting permits, even though the bears are 
almost extinct from the woods. All of this came to mind towards the end of 
the video. I think of hunting as slaughter, I can't help it. At one period 
it was necessary for survival, but it's not now, and calling it a sport to 
me is like hammering an infant - the man with the gun has the power and 
the deer has none. I can't even fish. Azure majored in environmental 
education and both she and I subscribe to and occasionally work with 
environmental groups - and all the news world-wide is bad as you know. 
It's reached the point where I forward Peta and other graphic things to 
her because I can't handle them. Some of what you did in the performance 
also related to what I was doing at Eyebeam - I don't think you saw any of 
that. It was based on how to deal with, how to present, pain, wounding, 
and death, in the virtual - both in the 'real virtual' world of social 
media, and virtual worlds like Second Life. I could only work with images, 
photographs, things I constructed; it was ultimately all screen based. But 
sometime you might be interested in seeing that work; it's been 
well-received.

I think this is the best performance I've seen in a long long time (along 
with Foofwa's). It's uncanny, and creates silence in the face of flesh and 
death; thinking falters and becomes a different kind of thinking, or 
growing in the world. And I really, again, have to thank you for this.

Book Review: Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress

One of the most interesting talks given at ELO was on Dwarf Fortress, a 
computer game described as "The Most Complex Video Game Ever Made." I 
review on occasion for O'Reilly, and as a result, I ordered "Getting 
Started With Dwarf Fortress," by Peter Tyson - I want to strongly 
recommend the book here. It has an introduction by Tarn Adams, one of the 
two creators of the game, which is continuously under modification. The 
book convinced me of several things, germane here: First, Dwarf Fortress 
(and other games) may well be the most challenging and absorbing 
electronic literature in existence; second, that it's engendered an entire 
culture around it; and third, it is tremendously demanding on the player. 
I'm not playing it myself; I realize my own limitations. But I'm 
fascinated by the game itself, which is almost "jellyfish" in its 
morphology - on one hand, there's the screen interface, the visual 
gamespace; and on the other, there's the enormous number of processes 
running things clean and quick beneath the surface. Likewise there's the 
game itself, and then there's there's the community beyond the game (which 
isn't networked, as far as I can tell). The book goes deeply into the 
culture of the former, with chapters on things like "Justice, Healthcare, 
and Vampires," and "Dwarf Resource Management" - as well as subheadings on 
things like Metal, Meta, Cloth, Food, etc. - all different industries in 
the Fortress world. The book also describes the Dwarf Fortress Communities 
and Forums.

I really recommend this, even if you're not interested in playing the 
game. I personally feel its addictive draw - only a download away. But I 
learned my lesson with far simpler games like Adventure (which I modded of 
course): knowing myself, I have to stay away. On the other hand, think of 
Getting Started as an introduction to one of the most power genres of 
electronic literature around, and you may find your fascinated - there are 
so many possibilities! - even hacking the game, or thinking through what 
virtual worlds actually mean (this one's more or less ascii-based, and yet 
far richer than much of what I've seen in Second Life). Get the book (has 
a cool cover too, somehow reminding me of Ken Wark).

the drone string was exchanged for a thinner steel one, an
octiave higher than the main _sa_ playing string; the result
was difficult bowing; echo and heavy hiss reduction was added.
the result is a speaking from one to another, of images,
uncontrolled and seasonal. _i didn't expect this clarity._


Peregrine Falcon and Dapper Alan

Azure's helping me dress appropriately for my niece's wedding,
I think she managed to do something with me. the pants were
ordered, the ties were from a thrift shop and we luckly 
found the linen jacket on a rail on St. Mark's place! The
shoes are stylish Sketchers. Clearly I would collapse without
Azure and her sartorial knowledge. I might collapse anyway,
but at least I have a running chance!

Please forgive me for this burst of personal ostentation; I
can't imagine it happening again!

Revised Autobiography

For those who are interested, I've revised my 'autobiography,'

I edited almost all the emotional sections out; what remains

Perhaps not. But it's online in any case for your persual.

amazing to play. Mine is from the mid-19th century, made in
Germany by a company that specialized in violins. In its
original case. One of the fretted strings is missing, but
the sound is beautiful.

From our rooftop -

http://www.flickr.com/photos/asondheim/sets/72157630844929052/

the big-corporate 5 billion dollar 1%-er mess for the neighborhood
- barclay's arena - also including a 32-story skyscrape for 
housing in the small-footprint area to the right of the building.
we're trying to move out. the company never once met with the
neighborhood, but instead seized buildings by eminent domain and
ignored new york city rules and regulations, not to mention 
environmental laws. there's no sanitation or police plan in place.
how did they do this? they - the boro president, mayor of nyc,
governor of ny, and 'forest city ratner' declared the arena 
property no longer part of the city, but belonging instead to the
state. so screw nyc, screw the residents who have to live with
the pollution, noise, filth, and crime this monstrosity is already
generating, and three cheers for the performers and investors who
are going to make a killing. this whole project was fought by the
way by a number of groups, mainly develop, don't destroy, brooklyn
(dddb) - and we lost all the cases until recently, now we're 
winning, but it doesn't matter - the investors will get their
rewards on the ruins of a neighborhood. mind you most people here
i think are for it - brooklyn hasn't had a sports arena for years.
but there were far better sites; placing it in the center of a
residential neighborhood is a mess.

8 is getting very close to something that fascinates me,
it's relation to quiescence on one hand and soto zen on
the other; on the third, 9 is completely played at the
lower end of the instrument, mostly within the first 6
centimeters or so.

Is there a virtual ontology?

Is there a virtual ontology? Think of the virtual as the 
promulgation of the image and its phenomenological retention. Such 
is the debris or cast-off of the real, no more or less virtual 
than any other sensory modality and its reception. This is an 
important point; we can no more live in the virtual now than we 
could, then, that is, at any other point. The image always carries 
its own imaginary which is a confluence and culturally-dependent, 
sensorially dependent as well. This imaginary itself carries a 
confluence of poetics, but at this point we're at a distance from 
the obdurate hardness of ontology. Now ontology is something one 
must be careful of, in relation to thinking through it. One need 
not be careful _of_ ontology itself, which characterizes existence 
whatever one might think, and here is where scientism enters into 
the picture: what is this carelessness? I think within the 
ordinary attitude, it is something that might well be abandoned, 
outside the aegis of technology.  [...] So no, there's not a 
virtual ontology, or rather one might think of virtual ontology as 
equivalent to any other, fulfilling the same contracts, offices, 
and rules...

There is 'an other hand' to this - for how can a snippet answer or 
re/consider such complex matters in detail? It's too simple and we 
might as well reverse everything: Think of the virtual as the 
harboring of the image and its constitution and reconstitution. 
The real might then be a production or cast-off of the virtual 
(which also includes the imaginary) - a real no more or less real 
than any other: think of mathesis, physics, cosmology, over-the- 
horizon of the holographic universe. Then the real carries its own 
obdurate, not dependent on the virtual, but co-habiting with it - 
and at this point we're at a distance from the suppleness of 
ontology, which may well be considered a flow or flux. One might 
be careless of thinking through ontology, but one need be careful 
_of_ ontology, particularly as suppleness lends itself everywhere 
and everywhen. Here is where poetics enters into the picture, and 
what is the care that poetics takes? I think within the ordinary 
attitude, it is something that must be tended, stewarded, 
inhabited beyond the aegis of the technology. Or rather the 
technological is pulled along with it. [...] So yes, there's a 
virtual ontology, or rather one might think of virtual ontology as 
_that_ ontology among others, abandoning contracts, offices, and 
rules...

And have we really reversed anything here? Anything at all?

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/bygones.mp3

I married my first wife in the late 1960s and three people, Rhoda, 
Bill, and Jagdish, gave us a sarangi as a wedding present. I never
played it; it was far too difficult. It's inscribed

JUNE & ALLAN
LIVE HAPPILY 
EVER AFTER!

LOVE, Rhoda, Bill, Jagdish

That didn't happen, and the instrument remained at our parent's
house in Pennsylvania. Finally my sister took it and hung it on 
the wall at her home in Toronto, and later, at her cabin. 

Recently, I asked for it back and picked it up this past
weekend, when Azure and I went up for my niece's wedding. The
sarangi had never been played. One of the sympathetic strings
was broken. I brought it back, and have been tuning it up. The
inscription haunts me and I thought of playing a threnody to so
many lost years, lost friends, lost communities. I've been
morose and at the same time, wanted to make the sarangi sing.

I repaired two strings and a crack, tuned the main strings low,
to G, reset the position and angle of the bridge, untangled
everything, cleaned it up. I tried different bows, settled on
an old Indian one without tightening it. I wanted to play
something called bygones for myself, and as a welcome to the
instrument itself, and as a gift to Azure. It's all harrowing
and confused. Here's the music, errors and all, running over
four or five octaves.

Thanks to Azure and Margie and everyone who puts up with me.



Periodic Cicada final molting, Toronto, August 5, 2012

We were at a wedding and found a cicada in final instar attached 
to the side of one of the wedding tables. It would have died if 
it remained there; I put it in the garden, and it finished 
molting in about half an hour. It seemed celebratory to watch 
the process and photograph it. Here's to Laura and Zach and my 
sister Margie and her husband Peter! And here's to the new-born 
cicada!

all experience is absolutely not mediated through language i'm not sure 
how to take what you write, but pretty for what it's worth, which is 
either everything or good heavens! :-) read krauss. i don't think there's

never said anything about transcendental or hi, , you hit at the heart of 
our difference. the hi, it appears to me the questions of the ontological 
honestly have to say i haven't read this (reza); what's the i am aware you 
don't think so, but i think he does; not i call it all a matrix. still

ill study more about ontology. it's simple , it's the time thing. think

where very ruthless. using the enemies head to this i think expands on 
hartshorne's standard reading of this is good "virtual" food. something to 
chew on morosely for we must pledge to use this power only for good. what 
i mean by "can't even expand your comment' - i meant, would be wonderful 
to do a mashup of all of these texts. /n/ for me there isn't a language of 
death, there's a language from wikipedia - in physics, a virtual particle 
is a hi . bakhtin says utterance occurs in reading as well hi . i don't 
have a problem with things being beyond hi . i would say reversal of a 
film is just ing a hi . theology is never necessary (as i understand it, 
that hi, , i am not sure whether we are agreeing or huh. it didn't post to 
otherstream. and when i tired to post i thing mashing these texts is a 
good idea. i'll leave you at it now, thanks a lot, ,for the if the use of 
tools doesn't mean a thing, then everything if there weren't particle 
physics, that might hold - not to in my book, my dear master, virtuality 
equals what is beyond in qm... otherwise, reza negarestani's notion of 
poromechanics is a particle physics _are_ virtual objects safety measure 
is a bloating metaphore of course, there is sorry to bug you this way, . 
the use of tools is an talks of faith, you of faithlessness. i wonder how 
much you are both thanks - i may have been able to post it on otherstream, 
not thanks for this - having trouble republishing because of the the way i 
remeber it, , the whole point of what i understood. but theoretical 
physics is still theoretical. so who is bruno latoue? yes, string theory 
does take gravity into account. you can't approach a mathematical limit of

so only a very small percentage of experience "real" and "unreal" are on 
an equal footing, both "actual" (or both "the things themselves" are also

- but i don't think that deity or spirit of any 'messes' our view of 
things - 'not'! (besa me, besa me mucho.) (and i don't think it's what w.

through language. and yet i believe (if at all) only after the new meaning 
has appeared, post fact. one might (not just speech). once something is
