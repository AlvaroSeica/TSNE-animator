The Usual


I hope you read this. I really hope you read this. I'll make a pastiche 
for you at the end. You'll be rewarded, entertained by it. But in the 
meantime, I've lost the job I had scoring Graduate Record Exam essays. I 
have no idea why; it might well be the result of downsizing (we all had to 
take a cut in salary), and I did take off weeks for the West Virginia 
residency (but the job was part-time and ad hoc anyway). The downsizing 
email simply said that one knew one could be let go at any time, without 
reason. I've applied for unemployment, but since I had to have unemploy- 
ment with the job (it never paid enough), I doubt I can get it at this 
point. So if you know of any work, telecommuting or otherwise, part- time 
or full-time, in the areas of test evaluation, text evaluation, teaching, 
editing, copy-editing, please let me know. Of course I can get references, 
etc. Thank you for reading this. The pleasure is below. - Alan

they're nameless

Books I like and the reasons why -


I've been traveling and working for the past couple of months; here's the 
latest - texts and others I'm fascinated by -

Google, The Missing Manual, Sarah Milstein and Rael Dornfest, O'Reilly: 
This is the third book on Google help that O'Reilly's published, and for 
most people, this is by far the best. Google is expanding, building a 
search empire, for better or worse; there are all sorts of experimental 
Google searches, as well as an enormous number of configurable options. I 
use Google, because it's clean, fast, and hasn't disappointed me - and 
this is probably the best guide out there. You don't have to know 
programming, by the way, to use this. And like all O'Reilly books (well, 
almost all of them), it's well-written, interesting reading, with no 
fluff.

destruction in art, Bob Cobbing, writers forum 
(writersforum@britishlibrary.net). I'm not all that interested in concrete 
poetry and/or destruction art, but this work is of great interest, a 
series of 21 prints of Cobbing's Typestract One and the events program for 
The Destruction of Art Symposium - all increasingly mangled, none of them 
readable. The prints blur to almost black. I'm reminded of Latham's Skoob, 
the work of Dom Sylvester Houedard (who has had an interesting career - do 
a Google search) - and, most recently, Gerhardt Richter's photographic 
sequences of sections of his paintings. In all of this material there's a 
sense of loss, the attempt for something else to 'emerge' or 'give,' and 
in general a melancholia related to the violence of everyday life. Check 
this out.

On the other hand, if you want an amazing Cobbing / Peter Mayer work, ask 
for concerning concrete poetry, from the same press (run by Lawrence Upton 
at the least!). This book, also inexpensively produced, is a reprint from 
1978, and includes the work of a number of people, from John Furnival 
through Porfirius Optatianus. But what makes it remarkable are the 
contents: chapters on 'The Term Concrete,' 'Some Historical Statements and 
Manifestos,' 'On Semantic Poetry,' 'Some Myths of Concrete Poetry,' two 
chronologies of visual and sound poetry, and so forth. Wonderful!

EDA: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry, edited by Murat 
Nemer-Nejat, Talisman House Publishers, is spectacular. I knew nothing of 
these poets, but the themes and styles, at least for me, are unique. I 
tested it on my father, who's 90 and reads history and literature 
incessantly, and he also was fascinated. I love Sami Baydar and Lale 
Muldur's works - but it all reads well. I can't tell of course how good 
the translations are, but the works are excellent in English as well.

Eden Eden Eden, Pierre Guyotat, Creation Books. I'd not read Guyotat's 
work before, so you're probably far ahead of me. Needless to say, it 
resonates in its apothecaries of relentless sexuality and violence, 
somewhat reminiscent of Kenji Siratori's work (see below). Stylistically 
most of it runs on gerunds and participles; I've never read anything like 
it. If there's a writing degree zero, this is it. Do check it out. It was 
originally published in French in 1970, by the way.

Crum, The Novel, Lee Maynard, Vandalia Press. Crum had a population of 219 
in West Virginia, for real; the book is part fiction, part memoir, and if 
you ever want to understand West Virginia or for that matter, any American 
rural/mining area, begin here. It resonates. It was banned in Crum and 
shouldn't have been. It's wonderful.

The Ethics of the Dust: Ten Lectures to Little Housewives on The Elements 
of Crystallisation, by John Ruskin, 2nd edition, 1877. This is one of the 
truly weirdest books I've ever come across, and that's saying a lot. In 
his later years, Ruskin fell in love with a nine-year-old girl; the rest 
is history, both found and lost. The book is a summary of his beliefs in 
terms of crystallization (reminding one of Stendhal in the matter, but not 
in manner or content) - if you ever see a copy, pick it up.

Likewise, Prophetic Writings of Lady Eleanor Davies, edited by Esther S. 
Cope, Oxford. Mid-seventeenth century writings, the like of which, being 
outside the kin and ken, I've never come across; apparently there were 
other prophets of the time. The language is various and strange. As the 
introduction says, 'Some sentences lack subjects or verbs' and the whole 
is rather breathless and Beat Generationist by loose default. Again, if 
you see it...

The Knapsack, edited by Herbert Read, 1939, is one of my favorite small 
books, containing a plethora of literary excerpts that somehow match my 
taste; it's a tiny book, but one of the few anthologies I can read over 
and over again.

Just finished Volney's Ruins, by the way - again, look for it.

D.C. Lau's translations of Confucius and Mencius are excellent, by the way 
- I'm using them with a slow-reading list I'm on, dealing with Chinese 
classical philosophy.

HUMAN_WORMS, Kenji Siratori, iUniverse Inc. is a beautiful book. I've been 
reading Kenji's works for a long time; at one point, I was modifying 
texts he was emailing on. Much of his writing, including this, sounds like 
uncompromising cyberpunk cutup, but it isn't; in fact, I have no idea how 
it's written. I love it for that. Recently, Jim Reith wrote a program for 
me that will take a text, place the words in an array, and access them 
according to an arbitrary mathematical function that I can define. It's 
the closest I get to Kenji's style myself, but his work is far denser, and 
darker in furious post-Bladerunner style. This particular work is his most 
advanced - and beautiful - to date. Phrases are repeated - 'hunting for 
the grotesque WEB' for example - these are broken and recombined like an 
insane DNA. If you're getting one Siratori book - and you should - this is 
the one. 

I have three Sheila Murphy books here - she's one of the most interesting 
'subliminal' poets around - by which I mean everything is beneath the 
surface of what appears in wildly various styles - but all related - of 
the three - Green Tea With Ginger (Potes and Poets) - Letters to 
Unfinished J. (Green Integer) - and Concentricity (Pleasure Boat Studio) - 
I prefer the second _and its italics_ - or the third - of which on the 
back cover John Tritica references the 'tone complexion' and 'promenade of 
images' - which he also puts into quotations - it that, the centrifugal 
force as if the sections split apart - they don't - cerebellar sparks of 
adjacency but widely disparate imagery/imaginary -

At this point I'd also like to mention in passing -

The wryting list, co-moderated by Ryan Whyte and myself (the descendent of 
the old fiction-of-philosophy list that I started circa 1994-5) - some of 
the best experimental writing I've seen is there -

Sophia - my sophia.txt, published by Writers Forum or writers forum just a 
few days ago - this is the main theory/philosophical text I've written - 
one might be interested -

The Compaq Presario notebook I bought a short while ago with the Athlon 
3000 64-bit processor - cool and fast and the wireless _reaches_ - I've 
been using it for production and it responds well -

The Zaurus 5500 linux-based PDA I've used for almost the past year - this 
is an incredible mini-computer - it runs Mathematica-like programs, full 
linux, perl, anything you want to put on it - with a wireless card Kismet 
is great on it - etc. -

Peter Krapp's Deja Vu: Aberrations of Cultural Memory, Minnesota - I'm 
still in process of reading this and I've not been focusing all that well 
(with the residency at West Virginia University followed by the Incubation 
Conference at Nottingham) - but I'll cover this - I asked for a review 
copy - an outstanding chapter on Heiner Muller - more later -
