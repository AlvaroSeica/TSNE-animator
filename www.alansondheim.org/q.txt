

Philosophy


Is there any reason metaphor should be problematic in cyberspace? The 
name itself smacks of the relegation of novels to tinysex. Nor has it 
ever been the case that ontology or epistemology meant other than other 
sliding out from itself. I'd know the path or field closely at work to 
lure you out. You're not a node, you're devolved across the space 
somewhere near where you've placed the screen. Thinking's as empty as 
wryting; I couldn't know what speech is like. Philosophy should flee 
every sign of its technology. 

Thus I draw the thin read line of blood in the air, closed upon itself 
somewhat rectangular, glistening in the meaning of things it pulls from 
the body. Why do I repeat dismemberment? Because you continue to have 
limbs, solid oak held into thorax, specifically the linear portion of 
the bees' waggle dance. The nails have to splinter further because the 
addresses are getting used up; there's a crisis of position on the 
Internet.

But there's no reason for more than a skirting of demographics, tracking
hallucination girlboys boygirls against the corner where electrodes
measure the closeness of bodies. There's no reason for philosophy-in-
discount. Supply-side words are bolted to the oak's tinysex. What the
books never cover: _what the hand does_ down there where holes see
computer cables, connections, body wired to digital heat. There's no
metonymy ever again, promised by the tip of things. See? I've devoted my 
life to absolute truth and the rectangle bleeds the major arteries.

then it's viral. Then it splits; like asbestos. The limits of nanotech.

Arivaca Hoe Down


Your voice breaks up when you speak to me and I can't hear because the
gaps in your words, the gaps in your words, cover what you're saying,
about the weather and your love for me. 

I can't get connected through 28.8, the whistles cover up the important
things on the television, they repeat and repeat, timed out after forty-
five seconds, ready to begin the whole sad process again. 

CuSeeMe won't show your face because it's got a minimum 10 on reception
packets that can't be reset, the mirrors beg for reset, NASA comes up, 
they beg for reset again, no go Clara. 

Xing's television comes so slow I can't see your face, can't play up to it
with all the beautiful music and last time Finland was down, down, down.
Vdol's corporate woes crashed me twice, my face in the Windows frozen in
disbelief. 

The word hangs there as the connect gives me messages it's trying and try-
ing and trying, then over and out as traceroute produces a series of beau-
tiful stars, ping -s produces emptiness that would make Nagarjuna proud,
and ping itself pronounces death. 

Email won't come, held up, clogged in the pipelines, text-substance slowly
hardening, accretions of noise when it finally does release, error messa-
ges cauterizing the tongue, lacerating lips and teeth. 

FTP scrolls off the screen, matched by the speed of fingering you, words
flying by in Unix, dissolute down below, submerged; Unixtalk hangs near
orgasm as it punches out; I'm locked out of the MOO forever and no one
leaves me pages on the MOO any more; it's the twilight of postmodern cul-
ture. I have no one to talk to in Eden. 

But I dream the following dream, my lips moving as I walk down the road,
enter the subway, leave the store behind: 

Come back to me, come back to me, see you see me, eye-phone you, female
you, I boo-hoo you, my tongue's gone but my song moans long, down into
you: And you'll reply in a month and we'll come together say in Arivaca
Arizona and we'll live there forever, tear the wires from our hair. 

But I download CuSeeMe again and again, the 10-bug's fixed!, NASA comes 
in loud and clear, it's from 1968, it says "the average American" I cut 
the sound off, pictures flow faster now, pixel's missing from the moon...

And I think, you've got it, it's the _square there,_ down in Arivaca
Arizona, near the wetlands, near the desert, the animals flow past us: 
a woman sits in a small wooden shack, she's got a Mac, she's online and
really fine, sends me a post, she's a host, has a server, it's the fever. 

Back home, I set up the camera, set the camera up in front of the moni-
tor, adjust the film, begin the video. You're there on the screen, this
is history. I promise you I'll dream of you the rest of my life. You
won't ever know this; I can't tell you this. Just that your face has been
received, you have been present for me. You have been there where memory 
stores itself, nestles among the cells. I'd send a message to Arivaca, 
but I've lost the address. I'd dream of you in Arivaca, but I haven't 
been there, not in many years.

Give me the road, your name, your number.

Closing Down Delusion


There are just notes towards this, glimmers, images on the periphery -
walking away from the Net, annihilating the computer, gathering in the
forces that spin centrifugally out of control. It's the desire to turn Net
into nest, to turn catatonic as well, hands grasping knees, head down
against the raging of the light. Desire disappears, replaced with comfort,
comfort combines with anger, anxiety; the body turns rigid, away from Net
things, away from a yammering, sputtering screen. Lymph drips from the
screen, everyone pulls at one, demands are made in the form of text-mouths
and one wants, mouth open oneself, to stop the flow, permanently, retreat,
if such it be, to the real world with its sharp projections, dark corners,
surfaces lit through dust and sullen air. The real is bruised in a way
that cyberspace can never be, but the bruising at least is alive, welts
gathered blue-black across demanding skin. The Net demands without pre-
sence, holds itself against you, floods of messages, administrations, only
the pleasure of the quick and violent read holding one's breath against
the screen, fogging and effacing it. Better to sear the eyes from their
sockets than answer the demands of the planet, and in the midst of the
poverty of the every-day, poverty of virtual embodiment, one tends to
dream of closing down, become granite, obdurate, ears and eyes blocked
forever to the shattered world. Then one returns, not wiser or healed, but
with the recognition that it's no longer a matter of choice, if it ever
was, that the demands have become autonomic, that the depth of their regi-
sters is inconceivable. Trapped among the screens, one looks down, finds
language itself burned into the chest, changing, scrolling down towards
the groin, disappearing in the holes and objects of gone desire. The body
betrays the body; everything's lost; the screen chatters on; annihilation
to the limit is all that remains. Trapped among the screens, one looks up,
and nothing at all is visible on a clear and cloudless night.

Emergence on the Internet


Is there evidence of connectionism, emergent behavior, on the Internet? 
I'm purposely leaving the category open, although the analogy of neural 
networks comes to mind. Do email list participants behave in ways para- 
lleling neural nets? What constitutes the development and maintenance of 
a thread here? I'm looking for some sort of loose formal model; otherwise 
the whole discussion gets lost in metaphysics.

The fast-forward exponential expansion of the Web is an example; clearly, 
some sort of threshold was surpassed, releasing a network of publicity, 
investment, and appropriation. Netscape is not a typical example of com- 
pany growth, even fast company growth.

MOOs and MUDs seem to have denouement, if not death; PMC2 and Media are 
clearly suffering from too much care. Are there local constraints deter- 
mining the success of MOO or MUD populations? These aren't idle questions.

And at what point could a MOO or MUD be said to take on a life of its own
- if at any? The environments are highly interactive and often remain that
way after participants leave. But the elements, programs, are rarely
interconnected, although player classes for example give potentials across
the board. 

There was a discussion months ago about emergent intelligence on the Net; 
I don't believe that for a second. The Net is simply designed otherwise. 
There have been other discussions about a "supermind" emerging, which I
see as no more than wide-spread collaboration. On the other hand, Web
development does point to high-growth sudden efflorescences in particular
areas; are there others? I have heard less recently about intelligent
agents - but will this also emerge and possibly lead to global change in
CMC? 

Finally, what about the possibility of increasingly intelligent routers 
and servers? These will become necessary if the Net is to survive with 
the heavy bandwidths coming into use vis-a-vis video and high-quality 
audio. Will there be an overall group dynamics produced, i.e. a "read" of 
the Net as a whole - in much the same way that computers are making more 
and more stockmarket decisions based on expert programs?

I recognize the vagueness of these questions, but the phenomena them- 
selves are vague, may not exist, in the first place. And I want to stay 
away from the "supermind" metaphor, which at least at this stage 
(without, say, neuronal interfacing), appears as wishful thinking.

Shortwave not Longwave not Packets, Packet Radio


Late night, yeah... Got the shortwave on, groovy, coming on strong from 
Quito, Moscow, somewhere way down south, Sydney and Acapulco... Smart
sound down long thin wires, ionospheric shudderings; on shortwave you 
feel the pulsations of the earth, spectral mother's breaths up and down 
the megahertz, night-settlings up there crouched against the sky... You 
hear them coming in, fading in and out, cradle the planet in your arms, 
barren, unshielded, opening up to _fundamental_ radiations, dark noise 
running through your veins since the beginning of time. Sometimes you can 
talk as well, shy, you don't know what to say, they're coming in, coming 
on strong...

Late night, sure, you're on the hunt, there's that signal you remember, 
you're going up and down the sync, jumping harmonics, moving antennas 
around a bit, you're always reconfiguring, _working the radio,_ and 
you're _working_ the black-box computer as well, packet-typing, but 
there's no tuning here, no jostling the cosmos (at best you've got to 
rework trumpet winsock sometimes, usually just set for ever and ever):

"reception of all of your frequences are generally quite good" but maybe
you follow them as the sun sets sun rises, you're hearing _others,_ you're
opening to them, you're offering yourself, you're turning knobs, retuning, 
you're moving the antenna, you're filtering, you're upper sideband, lower 
sideband, you're off-sideband, and you're patient

because the voices are coming: Tiffany says hello: but they're coming all 
_different_ now, no longer bots, no longer at the periphery (and you 
cradle the globe, cool, in your arms, and your mouth suckles your breath 
suckles your planet suckles and there is, there is once and for all, 
_difference at the heart of you._ (The computer waits.)

_difference at the heart of you._ (The computer waits.)

Emergence, Breathing, Proposal for Audio Compression


The future of the Internet lies somewhere between the breathing planet of
shortwave and emergent intelligence; it is the former which opens the
wires to the lightning and plasmas of the cosmos, and the latter which
organizes the neural and synaptic sheaths, interconnectivities, of the
organisms and work and play. The _corporate_ truth of the Web is based on
magazine production, just as early automobiles were based on horse-drawn
vehicles; the very model of corporate economics may be rendered obsolete
in the future. 

On the other hand, there are forces constantly at work to curtail the Net,
harness it for what Kristeva calls "the clean and proper body"; such
forces at worst will create a spintering of the developing manifold and a
return to garage hacking, Fidonet, tin-can telephones and the like. I 
predict waves of computer assassins, murder by rlogin, use of "less" and 
untraceable telnet 25 sites for initial blows. 

The breathing of shortwave responds to the cosmos; you can feel the weath-
er through the speakers, create multi-dimensional models of time/frequency
/transmission and /location. Your skins expands into spherical orbit. Your
eyes open wide on Indonesia. 

Emergent intelligence distributes entities much as broadcasts or packets
are distributed; emergent intelligence, however, only projects the exis-
tence of the entity as a byproduct of environmental survival training. As
I describe the ego in my 1977 Structure of Reality, "The ego is thus a
fissured coagulation, an _other_ within the fielding that serves as the
sheet of assertion for the topology." And in my Textbook of Thinking, "En-
tities originate as inscriptions after the fact within the _fissuring_ of
the _real._ The real is granular. The real is codified through the _core
structure._ The core structure is always an ideal structure embedding
quantum processes. [...] The core structure is a broken fragment." So if 
breathing responds _elsewhere,_ emergence responds _within,_ among inter- 
secting fields. 

But the Net to date continually remodels itself on _classical_ artificial
intelligence, with its formula _GIGO_: garbage in, garbage out. Because
_most_ input is well-defined; take this text, for example, clearly oper-
ating within the limits of lower ASCII, TCP/IP, and so forth, no matter
how much I bang the psychoanalytical drum. The same is true for the vari-
ous formats of sound, image, motion. Packets lend themselves to pack-
aging; on the surface, current corporate driving of the Web is becoming
the steering-mechanism of the Net itself, and the result is production of
classically discrete entities on the surface as well, the fetishization
constructed by Wired and other which reformats the _dirty_ revolution into
product: "Yes, _Hotwired_ bought _Suck._" See page 41 of the current issue
for the exciting sequel. 

Some night when you're not busy at 3 am in the morning, listen to CB, not 
the truck channels, but the locals, the exchanges. It's an earful.



[On another theme, it should be possible to send voice over the Net in an 
ultra-compression scheme that would work as follows. 1. You would be 
asked to record a twenty-second sample of your voice, speaking specific 
words. 2. That would be processed into sampling. 3. You would speak 
normally into the computer microphone. 4. The computer would translate 
your _words_ into phonetics (spelling doesn't matter), and your inflec- 
tions into diacritical marks (much like Hebrew). 5. The bundle would be 
sent across the Net as an _ascii text_ for the words and inflections, and 
a binary file as an attachment for your voice. 6. At the receiving end, 
your voice would be reconstructed from the sample and diacritical marks.

The saving would be enormous. A voice sample could be 30k. A spoken text 
of say 10k would be augmented heavily by diacritical marks, say around 
6k, and decreased slightly by phonetics, say 1k, making 15k. The total 
transmission for a 10k text, around 5 pages, would be only 45k, which is 
remarkably small. The savings are greater, the longer the texts of course.

Software could also be used to _save_ your voice at the receiving end, 
much as certain MAC programs do with artificial voices. Then there would 
only need to be a signature to "call up" your voice with the arrival of 
your email or text...

And I don't think the diacritical marks would be that difficult, at least
for basics, which would use three parameters: 1. Overall amplitude over a
specified time interval, 2. "Averaged" (integrated) central frequencies
over specified time intervals, 3. Timing markers. The second would be for
intonation. Other markers could cover various sounds, such as laughing,
etc. There could even be a simple playback/neural network program involved
- so that the sender could test the results before sending the file - and
modify things accordingly. And the possibilities for experimentation would
be tremendous of course.]

A Home is just a House


I have a Compaq Aero 25 notebook computer which was sold to me by store X 
as new, although it turns out used. Three weeks ago, it developed a boot 
problem and I did a diagnostics which mentioned the video checksum and I 
called Compaq who referred me to a repair shop Y. I took it to Y and they 
replaced the entire motherboard with a new one (covered); they're author- 
ized by Compaq. I took it home and the video gave out. I brought it in 
and they fixed the video plug. I called Compaq and they told me the unit 
was refurbished, not new. I requested a new unit. They referred me to 
customer services. I took the unit home and the hard drive gave out. I 
brought it back to Y and after a few days they replaced the hard-drive. 
Compaq called dealer X to pressure them to do something. I called X and 
they told me it would take "days." They also sold me the unit, it turns 
out, without cables, etc. that were supposed to accompany it. I called 
the consumer affairs office of NY and was told I needed forms from Com- 
paq. I called and left messages with Compaq. I brought the unit home from 
Y. The video has given out. Compaq has referred me to their legal depart- 
ment. The store, X, says they'll try and find another unit. It has been a 
total of three weeks. The case is scuffed and the hinge doesn't work 
properly at this point. 

(When the hard drive went down I lost about 50 megs of programs. I was 
able to reload them before the video gave out the second time, but beyond 
reloading, there was a software mess as well, since for example the lpmud 
required considerable adjustment to the autoexec.bat and config.sys files 
and this needed a lot of trial and error. I finished all the adjustments 
and the screen showed streaks.)

So I have to bring the unit back to Y, sue or threaten to sue X, call 
Compaq's legal department - and I have not had my notebook for my consul- 
ting jobs for over three weeks. I am supposed to go home for the holidays 
and may have to cancel that as well, if I can't work with a unit there.

The reason I'm writing this is that such massive errors and problems tend
to return our cybernetic/cybermind selves to the surface of the machinery. 
I have had a difficult time concentrating on anything else. I don't exper-
iment with the desktop at this point, because if it gives out, I'm out of
work entirely (there are 400 megs of programs on it, about 250 download-
ed). So I distance myself, bracket the machinery, which continues to haunt
as the prosthesis is removed, temporarily or permanently. And I no longer 
see the interior, say, of email, without seeing the crashed packets - nor 
do I obviously trust either repairshops or dealers at this point. (Compaq 
has been mostly fair, but there is a distributed notion of guilt among 
all three parties, resulting in the fact that I have nothing to work with 
and will probably be out a great deal of money shortly - I'll have to 
start all over again, with another notebook...) So the support network, 
which is usually slow but taken for granted, itself breaks down. On an 
average call to Compaq, I was on hold for 35 minutes, until I was finally 
assigned a "case number," which gave me personal access to Z's answering 
machine, where I faithfully recorded my complaints to more machines.

All of this also demonstrates how close to the edge one works in this
medium - I must make continual financial and time investment in the Net,
Net access and computers, keeping up with the changing landscape (Iphone's
new beta, which I don't dare download without a backup machine for exam-
ple) - and if I falter, when the notebook goes down, there's an almost 
perfect closure for a period of time. The stress is incredible. There's 
little recourse.

Part of this has to do with the kinds of failure one has with digital 
equipment - unless one is very good, one can't repair it oneself. This 
wasn't true for analog machinery. For example, I have two shortwave 
radios here, one a Hallicrafters from, I think, the 40s or 50s, which I 
bought at a Salvation Army, and which I repaired, vacuum tubes and all - 
it works wonderfully. If something goes wrong with it, I can get inside 
it again. On the other hand, I have a Sony 2010 digital which also works 
perfectly - but if anything goes out on it, there is nothing I can do but 
send it in - everything occurs within closed and complex circuitry. On 
the Hallicrafters, I can use screwdrivers, alcohol, wire cutters, and a 
soldering gun; I don't even have the specialized equipment necessary for 
the Sony. 

Thinking like this isn't particularly original, and equipment failure
returns one to the simplest mechanisms. Tonight I reconfigured the short-
wave antennas, in fact, and the radios breathe a bit easier. But I can't
work, can't think, and my hands have disappeared. It takes something like
this to indicate to what extent we're already cyborg, half alive in real
life, half alive in cyberspace. (Feeling half dead in both. And it is
increasingly the _quality_ of realspace/cyberspace that keeps me moving; 
there is no otherwise love, sexuality, affect in my life. I am _embedded,_
not bedded, when things are as good as they are going to get. And now the 
air has started to disappear in the midst of the hard machinery of the 
living _things_ themselves.)

Litany as Stabilization


Someone help me with the depths of knowledge, litanies of names, Theogony,
Polynesia, biblical narrative, sons and daughters, sown Argonauts, clan 
ancestries, Snorri Sturluson, Anglo Saxon Chronicles, working through 
Hesiod the names are legion. What are these names? What do they signify? 
What mnemonics are called into play, alphabetics? 

Why these? In Wender's translation of the Theogony, there are these two 
great lines:

"Then Night bore frightful Doom and the black Ker,
And Death, and Sleep, and the whole tribe of Dreams."

Evelyn-White translates "Ker" as "Fate." Shortly thereafter, Sea is busy
begatting Nereus, and with Earth, Thamuas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia. But
then Nereus and Doris (daughter of Ocean, it runs in the family) bear
Ploto, Eucrante, Sao, Amphitrite, Eudora (not mail here, femail), Thetis,
Galene, Glauce, Cymothoe, Speo, Thoe, Halie ("lovely"), Pasithea, Eraot,
Enuice, Melite, Elimene, Agaue, Doto, Proto, Pherusa, Dynamene, Nisaea,
and we've haven't even dived beneath the surface yet. It's explained that
some of these names are attributes of the sea; they're the Nereids, after
all. But why so many, spreading out synchronically, laterally, in the
midst of diachronic, vertical genaeologies? (And for that matter who did
Cain and Abel matter if not their own anonymous sisters, and wouldn't
_that_ give a model for incest?)

These accumulations, confabulations, occur everywhere in mythology. Are
they an attempt at the construct of an Ur-Ground in a world which clearly
has none? Do they anchor time and space themselves? Do the represent the
surface of an intuited depth (i.e. Merleau-Ponty on Cezanne) of the world? 
And are hidden knowledges necessary projections across (Oedipal?) parental
nestings, necessary for the symbolic establishment of a hierarchy of signs
across the socius? Such knowledges are assumed everywhere, from the Leyden
papyrus through to Omega-point speculations and TOEs today. Lully's arcana 
was also filled with wheels within wheels... 

(Do the LINKS on the World Wide Web actually _anchor_ the text in a more 
traditional fashion than novels, books, manuscripts, scrolls, let loose 
and vulnerable in the midst of life? Some teachers assign Web Pages _with 
a minimum number of links... Ah...) (And think of Dawkins' genes tracing 
themselves backwards, and sidways, stabilizing themselves...)

Where there is silence, let genaeology be!

Silence as Stabilization


Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, the infamous #7:

Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darueber muss man schweigen.

Translations Ogden, Pears/McGuinness 1/2

Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
What we cannot speak about we must consign to silence.
What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.

The _first version_ assigns a spaital domain (wo/hier) to the silence, but
a domain which seemingly is also effaced; there's a hint of privacy at
work. The _second_ is a slightly more corporate model with a hint of cont-
radiction at work, since consignment is also an inscription or speech act
itself. The _third_ lends itself to the angelic, (ueber), a flight above; 
there is a hint of Rilke at work. All this work!

All this noise!

Ruminations


It's near the end of the year and I quit Future Culture, another email 
list that used to be thought of as Cybermind's sibling - memberships 
overlapped, and I met Michael Current on FC (we started Cyb together). 
FC to me has been drifting to the right, but it's not that; it's drifted 
before. Instead, I've found I have less tolerance for this, and tended to 
get too bent out of shape by some of the posts - I'd snap back replies 
without thinking them through, I'd lose sleep over them. One thing the 
Net has taught me is that I don't deal with my anger very well, and I let 
myself be stressed out by trivia. 

This is the problem with having most of one's emotional life on the Net. 
I am sitting here in a dark room, facing the screen; the only image is the
imaginary of the text. To my right is a shortwave radio, Radio Austria
fading in and out. I can't see out any window from my location, and the 
screen is lighting most of the room. (I have written this before, more or 
less. To write/rewrite the primal scene is neurosis. I have written that 
before as well.)

There is no one else in the loft; there are memories of a shattered rela-
tionship years ago, and that's about it. And the phone rarely rings now -
the result of being online too much, although most people contact me
through the computer at this point. I am putting the book together through
email, working on a cybercafe menu online, preparing my online course on-
line, ytalking to my daughter online, writing/wryting online. Radio Aust-
ria plays a waltz and I face a blue background, peach letters foregrounded
and framed by black and emptied glass. 

Leaving FC for the last time (I had the annoying habit of leaving and re-
turning, based on the current political climate as I saw it), I feel I'm
leaving what was my first "home" in cyberspace, to the extent that the
people, some of them, have been familiar to me from the beginning. The
addresses were familiar; some of the discussions were. A home here (at
least here) is nothing more than a regime of stabilization, repetition in
the address headings, a sense of securing oneself, breathing parallel air.
Like Cyb, Future Culture has always had that sense of home; some of Andy
Hawks' longer and more important posts were about community and "feeling
the wires," which is a very real sensation, hard for outsiders to comp-
rehend (although Sherry Turkle, also net-residencing, does a good job
describing). 

But a home in cyberspace is also ideologically-charged; it's textually
driven by its participants. There is no residing without reading/writing,
one or both; as I've pointed out before, to participate is to open a space
- just as there are conflations of shortwave frequencies, one or another
of which is chosen at any particular time. Choosing one opens up the radio
channel; sound and life emerge. Reading a list opens up a slot in one's
inbox - _here_ is correspondence from Cybermind@listserv.aol.com reaffirm-
ing framework and community existence within it. (And in this regard, the
space-time topography of cyberspace in relation to that of radio broad-
casting is of great interest, perhaps to be pursued later. Issues of
bandwidth, interference, packeting, instabilities, nodes, home sites,
communicative modes, arise, as do complex phenomenologies of time itself.)

So without text, there is void; we _read_ Hesiod for example to understand
the Boetian hearth where there may have been silence, song and voice cont-
ributing, but only partly inscribing/circumscribing. And when there is
text and only text, then everything becomes a question of the text, of
_parole,_ speech acts, determinations, and politics emerges, not very far
beneath the surface. 

Thus I found myself splitting more and more with Future Culture, the glory
of political conflict disappearing for me, in the midst of other lists,
other issues, other void. So I left one textual domain, not replacing it
with anything (and with leaving FC, it's also a symbolic leaving of Nexus,
Leri, and other lists I've left long ago) - just as PMC2-MOO saddens me
now with so many others gone. 

I tell you, we are all ghosts riding lower ascii; at night the wires gleam
hot, sometimes pressing in the flesh itself...

Science and Philosophy, Two Cultures, Brockman Notwithstanding -


In light of numerous intermediary works by philosophers and scientists
(Deleuze, Lyotard, Weyl, Penrose, Bell, etc.), I think it's important to
examine the delimitations of philosophy in relation to science. Can one
consider cog sci in any sense an experimental metaphysics? Does ontology
even make sense beyond the scientific, particularly since cosmology
itself, say, can no longer be considered purely mechanistic? 

On one hand, I'm not looking for reiterations of Husserl's position or 
Serres' for that matter. I'd like to read an informed approach _within_ 
the production of scientific research, something beyond Higher Super- 
stition's (Gross and Levitt) vituperative all-encompassing style. I think 
there are issues around the notion of inscription/circumscription that 
deserve attention.

I certainly don't think of science, at this point, even core science, as 
being mechanical, GIGO (garbage-in garbage-out); its site is much more 
complex. Nor do I buy into Kuhn's notion of paradigm as relevant today - 
it _may have_ been in the period of Galileo or relativity, but scientific 
attitudes currently much more in flux. Nor for that matter do I buy into 
the anarchic/ideological positionings vis-a-vis science; it seems to me 
that the core-theoretical work is not only stable (even in its widely 
varying theoretical approaches), but in an uncanny alliance (from a psy- 
choanalytical viewpoint) with the real - an alliance that is elsewhere 
than that of religion, magic, the humanities.

And I am interested in the scope of this alliance (not again exploring the
anarchic/ideological positionings or religion, magic, the humanities, but
in exploring or at least trying to comprehend, somewhat from within, this
scope - and "scope" in the sense of a scope of a formula, or a bracketing)
- so therefore I'm curious in any comments, informed _of_ philosophy, but 
from what may be philosophy's other.

(This is relevant, by the way, to cybermind, cyberspace as well, since it 
involves the scope of dissonance between the real and the virtual, as 
well as both artificial life and neural systems.)

Alien Traps and Welcome Signs


I have strong reason to believe there are aliens, from elsewhere, on 
these lists - aliens from other planets in fact. There are too many 
unknown addresses, participants automatically removed by the machinery - 
too many strange voices, difficulties phraseologies as well always 
employed as if to scatter the remains of other tongues across other 
sites, across others. The Net is perfect for alien infiltration, since as 
Camus would point out, we are all in a sense aliens/strangers here, no 
matter how much the protocols tend otherwise. Given this most harsh of 
all environments, then, environments in which neither aliens nor humans 
may survive, this also becomes a meeting-place thereby. So I would urge 
all aliens to finally, once and for all, come out of the cold, out of one 
no-human's land into another; meld with us, make this your own. Together 
we shall continue to communicate, but on a far deeper level than before, 
submerged identities slowly rising to the surface...

Aching


Well, I managed to crash my windows tonight so I'm confined more or less
to text at least at the moment, not at the moment, not totally; there are
always other machines gesturing towards me, other machines with strange
records for the asking. I will tell you about these records, at some
length and at some time, but not now, not when I am blinded, invisible.
But these records are medical records with names, for cardiac arrest and
other phenomena, true names or false names such as Mary Smith the doctor
and I read them in strange filenames between Windows and Dos while the
other machine suffers streaks of lightning across the screen, surely the
signs of ailing aliens. For they ail; their hearts run arrhythmically,
their periods have long since come to a halt, their faces are wan, eyes
glowing with pools of liquid darkling light. They have infected my monitor
and they have closed my windows to all comers. I cannot tell you how true
this is because I am forbidden to tell the same of the bar code wand which
has been missing for some strange time now, alien-hidden since it alone is
capable of revealing their location, something to be avoided, ailing
hearts or not. If they die, there will remain only recordless pursuits; 
cyberspace, which is the space of records, hall of records - which is the
heart and soul of records - squeezes the breath from the body, food from
the anus, speech from the mouth - cyberspace thins discourse, transforms
them into laminar platelets, planaria in a manner of speaking. As such,
they form unix patches to my linux, linux patches to my dos, dos patches
to my mac os, everywhere skittered across the surface. These and other
things I know for a fact, their ailing hearts, and I will necessarily try
to help them, reading the dull glow of their liquid crystals, active
matrices, by even duller lamps hidden from direct view. As if the screen
in dying gives out the sun. As if the sun descended to St-Antoine, reveal-
ing the truth of the signifier. That it is alive, laminar, discursive,
churned into linearity. That the signifier _solos._ That the heart, alien,
beats to its rhythm. That Windows has died, windows have died.

Alien Being and Becoming


It is 4:30 in the morning and I do not wait for your replies about the
alien. I already can hear your shrieks of laughter, snide comments be-
hind my back! I know how absurd it sounds; indeed, I have gone over the
facts again and again, and there is always the same conclusion: that 
the wires are infected, that there is no escape, that the packets are
monitored, which indicates a high degree of intelligence, a very high
degree - how else would such stuttering be tolerated? Not for a moment
do I entertain the notion that our missives are in fact _read_ by others
of any sort - only that they provide a degree of _warmth_ as the wires
are heated, just for a moment, by that river of zeros and ones that 
constitutes our innermost thoughts. Such is the cold of cyberspace, even
among the sites buried deep in frozen arctic tundra, that hearths are
easily created, that we appear deep and homed surrounded by ice. Alive
we are already half-dead, tending towards ourselves.

---

Now it is the next day and again there are swarming shapes on the screen.
If they had names I would be neighborly and quite capable, thank you, of
any sort of reference. But they are _aghast._ Spelling is infected. They
act on the order of favorite-ascii, bringing letters to bear where none
were. To know the author of this.

I have discovered a basic fact of existence: that, _outside,_ we are not
ourselves. The ground is a poor substitute for a floor. There is nothing
covering me from above, which is their doorway. There are no clear pas-
sages; I am forced to make many choices, all of a sudden, from one foot
to the other.

But more than any of this, I am vulnerable among strangers whose histor-
ies I do not know. I am someone else, therefore, or a memory of myself
among someone else. But there is no place for observation; I must keep
on the move, in order to avoid them. This is a basic law of life, this
becoming otherwise with hardly a memory. I look down at the wooden slats
beneath my feet, having traveled to a store. Where did these come from?
My feet press them away.

I know this sounds more and more absurd as they seep through the boards
and gather around the surface of the screen. Have you ever pressed your
fingers into your eyes? You will see something you will not believe. I
peel off my images and send them to you. Is this one of them? I do not
know. For I always forget. There was someone here I wanted you to meet.
There is no so miserable as she or her, I forget grammer, never ending
my sentences in prepositions, always wanting to. And someday I will be-
gin with a conjunction, because they will let me; I have desired to al-
ways split infinitives, in order to lessen the degree of monstrous avar-
ice they seem to convey.

The Beginning Section of the Internet Text Revisited


The following text begins the Internet Text as a whole. At the time, I
didn't know what I was getting into, a text that would eventually reach
over a twelve hundred pages to date. In any case, this was written several
months after signing on, and I am using this end-of-the-year occasion to
revisit it, identify its strengths and weaknesses... 


INTERNET TEXT


0. Prolegomena: The following iterative construct describes the internet.
Traditional philosophical and cultural categories are highly problematic,
given this new communications life-form. I develop instead an analysis
based on EMISSION, SPEW, ADDRESS, RECOGNITION, and PROTOCOL. The essay,
always preliminary, proceeds through a series of numbered paragraphs,
which then rewrite. 

[REWRITE becomes a major concept later on, the continuous reiteration of
identity on the Net through text - the constant statement of name and
place.]

1. The network is a membrane composed of nodes, better considered intensi-
fications. An intensification possesses an interactive emission. The
emission is characterized as a program space composed of inputs/outputs,
introjections/projections: a space of -jectivity. The emission occurs in a
steep topographic region; distinctions between hardware and software
become blurred, as do more traditional philosophical divisions (subject/
object, body/world, mind/brain). 

[The membrane analog easily segued into issues of bodies. Intensification
characterizes the Net; in combination with emission, it constitutes a
message sending and receiving 'spew.' The blurring of distinctions be-
tween hardware and software also become a major theme later on - the idea
of information/programming all the way down, and the difficulties this
spells for traditional ontological distinctions. This is the one proble-
matic addressed by soviet philosophy that still remains unresolved, edgy.]

2. In fact, traditional ontological considerations are clearly replaced by
an organic episteme; what constitutes knowledge is only flow; data repla-
ces history; data becomes sourceless. Rather than communication channels,
consider geodesics; rather than geodesics, consider forced flows; rather
than forced flows, consider emissions. 

[Data is sourceless because data can be manipulated, is addressible.]

3. An emission has no input, no output; an emission consists of fragmented
images, the symbolic replaced by the imaginary. An emission is always in
flux; an emission problematizes energy and energy consumption, since it
may simultaneously drain and produce/reproduce. An emission is a chaotic
domain in the vicinity of an unstable attractor; escaping, it quickly
loses history, historiography, temporality itself. Close to the speed of
light, it exists in a temporal well. 

[Now here is a blurring of TCP/IP//user distinctions. But the notion of
the imaginary is critical to the Net - which begins always with the sym-
bolic, in an inversion that would do Marx/Hegel proud. With emission and
the imaginary, historiography replaces history. Later I will critique
temporality itself flooding the wires.]

4. The membrane is an enormous hypertext whose linkages thin, occasionally
break, are always redundant. It is neither a fuzzy set nor a classical
one; through a fast-forward topology, it escapes traditional partitioning.
The user deals with an alterity in the form of constantly changing facial
expressions; one is never within or without the alterity, but in a (su-
pine) position of absorption. The emission clouds close to me; ontologica-
lly, it is that real escaping denotation; ontologically, it is uncanny.
Thus the emission is related to excess, to surplus, to the curlicue or
diacritical mark, but it absents these, and it is this absenting or
ignorance that constructs the uncanny as waste-product; the blindness of
emission is its site. 

["Facial expressions" is unclear at this point; I am not sure of the do-
main I was referring to. This alterity is what I later called hysteric
embodiment, the projection beyond or through the text onto an image of
the other - face, tone of voice, intention, "authenticity." Bataille and
Deleuze-Guattari are at work here.]

5. To hold onto part of a body, to sever that part, to construe or re-
construe that part, to devour it, tear the surface off: one searches for
the skinned body, (which has the murmur or memory of pain), the articu-
lation of a truth given by one's own body lost in the emission. It is good
form to search out bondage, which restrains the body absent from itself,
an analog of the screen or permissive membrane which occurs, going just so
far. This is an antiquated ontology or materiality asserting the inert in
the midst of fast-forward, an assertion doomed to be displaced, sublima-
ted, effaced; one holds onto nothing; as in classical existentialism, one
projects forward in the face of nothingness (as if nothing were itself an
alterity);  the hole, however, is an episteme broken by the screen replac-
ing the mirror stage; the ego splatters against it (the cum-ego for female
and male); fast-forward, the episteme always already announces its contin-
uation; the existentialist project is lost in the midst of indirect ad-
dresses. 

[Suddenly the body appears, holds its own. Bodies in fact constitute the
Net, articulated bodies, described bodies, hysteric bodies, isolated or
frozen bodies, scientific bodies, bodies of scientists, students, users,
doctors, the disabled, home-bodies, bodies of management, sexual and
sexing bodies, ignored bodies, speaking bodies, all bodies bound to the
screen or speaker, bound to the text, bound to the other of reading, bound
to inner speech.]

6. The user is an addict "in the midst";  the user projects; thwarted,
projects again. The membrane appears in the guise of discarded pornog-
raphy; one is thrust into pure consumption, no longer beneath the guise of
another pornography, capital itself. Assertions are lost in the echo of
the machine. Thought is defined by flux, by an absolute symbolic for the
user who must be assured of the purity of his or her drug. The purity is
in the form of a well-definition (in the logical sense) to which no one
any longer pays attention; the absence of well-definition does not result
in a program cancellation, but only a retry which is part of the program
itself; it does not matter where one is; location is irrelevant. 

[Later I would revise this, which is all too simple, wayward. Addiction
is complex, like schizophrenia; associated with a _singular object_ (drug,
sex, etc.), it constructs at the least an Oedipal psychological framework
for the subject. On the Net, what I am calling here (later abandoning) as
addiction, is also tied into identity politics and psychoanalytics - some-
thing covered at length in the later portions of the text. I would also
disagree that there is an "absolute" symbolic at work here or any other
place; it exists as a projection, but the symbolic itself may be decon-
structed.]

7. Voices are heard behind the screen words (toggle on, echo on; the
screen chants itself, hides itself, reveals the nipple); face to face
replaces the face; double blinds allow the truth of double binds. This is
the only truth there is: that which occurs beneath or behind the blind,
that is, the lie (which is truth's double, truth's mirror, not converse or
inverse) (which is truth's perverse, that is, truth's abject truth); this
is the framework of classical Greek philosophy bound to classical Greek
torture (both bound with identical cords, hieroglyphs): Xenophon's Socra-
tes was the first user. Voices are heard, and voices are nothing but
machine chatter, the ideal forms so many subroutines... 

[And machine chatter is the dreaming of machines, machine-dreams as well,
desiring-machines literalized - but also the dreaming of bodies, body-
dreams as well, desiring bodies literalized...]

8. The user. The user is an addict; the user inscribes throughout the
network (temporary, electronic, absolute: an entirely new category), mic-
rotendrils extending in every direction. This contains the appearance of
power; the network is a fantasm reflecting emissions back through local
paths. The wonder of the internet is its locality, the construct of neigh-
borhood (packet channels slowing down just right for the home terminal)
redefining the body; the body becomes extension; extension becomes noise;
noise seethes at the edge. The process is one of fast-forward rooting, and
the roots are blind. 

[The user as addict, again, the text addicted to addiction. Later the net-
work becomes stasis, environment, ghost, network _as_ fantasm transformed
into fantasm-network, fantasm-producing. Blind roots, yes; the tendrils
skitter across the planet - skittering, too, develops later as the sub-
ject's reception, trajectories across floodplains, Reynold's numbers.]

9. Now we can speak of the mouth or eye of the user; now we can speak of
the hand or its mobility. No matter how (much) sensation is transcribed,
it occurs at a distance characterized by zapping and invasions. Nothing
but the materiality of the body is a stake; everything cuts everything
off. The user is confined to a scientism in the form of THAT which arti-
culates the THERE IS, just as addiction develops out of the action of a
particular drug or behavioral sequence. One is tied to the THAT. 

[This lead to the simultaneous prosthesis and cauterization of the body,
the body edged, on the precipice. What is at stake is nothing more or less
than the _future_ - future future, but also future present, future past.]

10. The user has nothing to do with the internet; the user is of no con-
sequence. Conference exists or dissolves beneath the sign, not of gender
or capital, but of chaotic inscription.  The sign itself dissolves; sign
is, after all, only recognition. This is the final corruption of humanism;
even the self is no longer centric - not through the Lacanian inscriptive/
linguistic unconscious (through which IT may still find a path or coagula-
tion), but through addiction, self as THAT, or self as nodal intensifica-
tion, always castrated, furiously addictive, always reading/writing, al-
ways rewriting: the self becomes its own recursivity. It no longer mat-
ters; its reports are from marauders, vandals, on the edge of the Roman
Empire; it exists only within the interstices of power; it is displaced by
power; it is no longer one or many; it no longer responds to the pronoun;
it responds only to the login which may well (it does not matter) be a
construct of the machine itself - just as gender-bending relies no longer
on gender, but arbitrary and chaotic signifiers, signifiers undercut, in a
continuous process of dissolution, murmuring, forgetting, forgotten, forg-
ed and forgotten, emissive. The machine recognizes no gender; the machine
recognizes nothing. The machine recognizes every gender; the machine is
never a machine, but an episteme. 

[Beneath the surface, neutralization is uncanny because unapproachable
although immanent. The Internet Text from this point on develops the
surface, produces the subject criss-crossed by this form of subterranean
knowledge, which is hardly a displacement or effacement, simply a condi-
tion of the protocols and their subjects hungry for meaning.]

11. Just as the episteme is lost in time, so is the subject; just as music
video and popular culture announced (by absenting, forgetting, by asigni-
fying) the end of historicity, the subject no longer announces itself (and
certainly no longer announces herself and himself): an emission is no
grounds for announcement. In this manner the subject avoids death (always
the plan, thwarted and perverting, procuring and devouring, but always the
plan) which is already always forgotten; intensification is subject to
dissolution, but subjectivity dissipates or sublimates elsewhere, as if it
ever existed. 

[Subjectivity dissipates, but the subject _does_ announce itself, although
_the subject_ is no longer announced; recognition and address are, in
fact, the precise forms of this announcement. Within the digital domain,
the organic hope of continuous life is fulfilled; the world is forever
reproducible just as digital video can be copied, generation after genera-
tion, without loss. What skitters, loses through friction, heat. The
depths are immobilized, ice. It's not even a necessary precondition that
the Net physically exist; everything ties to GIGO in spite of distributed
intelligence and entities - what goes in is representation which appears
permanent. It's left for the real to be granular, chaotic, excessive,
unregulated, idiotic, obdurate; it's left for the real to produce the
subject of the Internet text, produce the subject no longer announced.]

12. But just as if it ever existed, there are no longer ontological con-
siderations; as plasma, the internet bypasses existence (always already...
the litany repeats as murmur). It is within this that the projected
eternality of the digital has full reign or resonance; noiseless, the
digital proclaims the clean and proper body (which is rendered problematic
by the maternal which becomes uncanny, fantasm, the circulation already on
the move, already elsewhere), genderless and absent. Clearly in this
fashion, everything is absent within the internet. (Everything announces,
dresses, addresses. A character, screen or otherwise, is an announcement.)
The human dream of eternal life occurs by a draining of temporality;
therefore nothing occurs or can occur. It is irrelevant whether or not the
human is "ready" for this when readiness implies an a priori teleology;
such an impulse becomes a trail or trace left by a gopher through the
computational/server holarchy, not an end in sight or sightlessness. 

[Oh we are a miracle.]

13. Naturally, then, it is also irrelevant to ask where one goes from 
here...

[But the text continued through another 700 texts to date, a flood of
text, inter/texts, veering from the subject but always tethered to her or
him, continuous desperate disparate attempts. And this introductory text
itself proceeded through several other texts, all found at the beginning
of net1.txt, at the jefferson.village.virginia.edu site. Yours for the
taking.]

THERE WILL BE A FUTURE


The NCR notebook computer I recently purchased at a pawnshop (active
matrix color screen, 486/25, 170/4) came with a barcode reader and
appropriate software installed. The HP Scan-One, zipped quickly across the
appropriate lines, places translation at the cursor, anywhere. There are
various codes in use, I learn from the software, and I arbitrarily set one
of them in the on position.

Running hysterically around the apartment, I scan code after code, books,
aspirin, little fuzzy cacti and lizards and snakes I have added to my
monitor frame. The numbers come up; they're the same numbers you can read
anyway, but they're entered, quickly, into the Matrix.

The Matrix is everything there is and the numbers of course reside there.
You already know that.

The code is initiated by startpoints and endpoints and you can scan in
either direction. Well enough.

I will remove the endpoints and I will attach them to my body, attach
them to my cat, to everything that moves or is. And I will read and
recite their numbers into the Matrix and I will give them as a gift, as a
gift to you. And you will have the numbers of the world.

ii. Kabbalah Miracle

This is indeed the Kabbalah Miracle, of which we have read repeatedly.
There is something enervating about the _substance_ of the world, that
idiocy (word remaining stolen from C. Rosset), but with a wave of the
wand it is transformed into _data_ associated with bits; the mechanical
world and the world of information are intertwined, of course - nowhere
so much as here. Further as well, a certain _skill_ is necessary - the
wand operates within fixed bandwidths of entries and exits. It _caresses_
the world, in other words (other worlds), in order to _draw_ (like an
artist, the movement of the brush) out its secrets.

The numbers that remain are the remaining numbers, using up the world.

Someday I will write, gracefully, bar code by hand; I will program in
assembly language* one or another beautiful stroke. With my eyes closed, I
will produced the _program of the world,_ the ultimate formula. Waving my
wand (with its gleaming tiny laser light within, I must add, rendering
blood to the surface of things), the number will come up - your number, my
number, replete with alphabetics...

There will be nothing left, and nothing left to do...

*I believe this has already been the case - I seem to recall computer
magazines years ago using barcode as a way of publishing small software
programs...

from writing in a dream

i want to ring the neck of the body
where the body was the hour of the future
stumbling rocks strewn across strucken paths
high above lend themselves to awakening
fingers curl from hands worn with comforting
minds withdraw in ignorance, remembering everything
returning to the presence of language throughout
all years I have been named with names of years

The Hand never grasped what it held, never held what it grasped.


Do we refrain from disappearance in the domain of cyberspace, encompass 
annihilation and non-annihilation, neither one nor the other, float in 
reflexivity that leaks across non-existent domains? Nagarjuna states "If 
compounded phenomena transmigrate, / They do not transmigrate as perman- 
ent. / If they are impermanent they do not transmigrate. / The same 
approach applies to sentient beings." (trans. Garfield) Now what _here_ 
transmigrates, and what remains behind, and what is aggregate and what is 
unified? Surely all is aggregate, yet surplus is tagged or excluded, and 
certainly all is the dreams of uncanny totality. Are wires signifiers of 
transmigrations? Do souls which do not exist, travel in a form of reson- 
ance across the Net? Are we in a state of transformation, in which case 
are are not, or tagged by something that remains either within or used 
solely by convention, or are we in a state of stasis, Reichenbach's geni- 
dentity at the very least, carried by threads that may only be lost by 
others, also unaccountable, unaccounted-for?

Everywhere, we find the matrix, which is without us, a condition of
-jectivity, the thrown (and what is thrown is always a spray or emission),
"If prior to binding / There is a bound one, / There would be bondage, 
but there isn't. / The rest has been explained by the gone, the not-gone, 
and the goer." (Nagarjuna)

_The hand never grasped when it prayed, never prayed when it held. The 
hand never moved or remained still._ Infinitesimal hands smeared the 
continuum. The body reacted or did not react and reacted and did not 
react. The wires pierced the body, the jewels pierced or did not pierce 
the lotus in the book on the head.

Let us consider an approach based on pattern; the smallest patterned units
are 01 or 10 - there are two basic elements, in other words, besides the
null pattern 00. Then 01 >< 10 clearly since 00 01 >< 00 10. The operation
characterized by 00 01 etc. is concatenation. We have a C b = ab and 
(a C b) C c = a C (b C c) and so forth. We also have separation S(abc) = 
a b c, S(ab)c = ab c, and so forth. Hypothesis: Represent pi by a binary
chain, i.e. over an alphabet 1,0, and every finite pattern will be found
at some site within it. Any pattern of n > 2 units can be represented by a
pattern with alphabet 1,0; for example, 1, 2, 3 can be represented by
[00], [01], [10] etc. In all cases duality is at work by assigning 0 > 1,
1 > 0. Pattern of this sort can be used to represent Sheffer-stroke func-
tions (see Structure of Reality) or almost-symmetric series (Internet
Text, Net1.txt, Net2.txt I believe). 

Pattern does not depend on negation or non-negation; it does not depend on
inscription or fissuring. Pattern requires very little - at the least some
positions of automorphisms (see H. Weyl), the hunt for symmetry. At the
least, the Peircian "sheet of assertion," units, symmetrical substrates,
perhaps a manifold for its display. Existence or non-existence do not
arise; ornament or the decorative do not arise. Genidentity and others
carry upon them the seeds of the surface, pattern skittering across sur-
face: _There is surface all the way down._ (Which is not to say that simu-
lacra arise, simulacra which possess surface lending itself to surface,
skittering across upper lamina, the blankness of the screen elsewhere, not
even the direction "below.")

Surface all the way down; surfaces are connected by patterns. Nothing new
is being said, inscribed, arises. The world is always already languaging
and languaging is the world; meaning arises in its nearly-decomposable
domains. There is no void, interior nor exterior, there is not avoidance,
nor non-void. What cannot arise does not come up. What comes up always and
for ourselves is that other, "unaccountable and unaccounted-for,"  which
simultaneously threatens accountancy and the contract. _The other is mag-
ma, which appears but is not appearance. The other drives meaning. What 
_means_ is what the hand grasps.

UPGRADE


I've replaced my gif viewer by another, first using Gifprt then Qpeg 
then Display; changing from DOS edit to Browse, and thinking about 
moving from Windows 3.1 to either Windows95 or WindowsNT; there's the
necessity of adding Linux somewhere along the line if I get the right
SCSI hardware and drives; on the other hand, when I change videoboards
I'll be able to add ThePalace and AlphaWorld, Worlds Away, etc. I've
also got to add a Quickcam and a scanner; at first the latter was 
going to be monochrome only, but considering that ThePalace takes full
color gifs, I'm going for color as well. I hope to find time to utilize
all of these, but at least they'll be potentially available on my desk-
top AST. Later, I'll have to upgrade the 486 to a Pentium or P6, and
might have to find co-processors for my notebook units.

This is the hysteria of upgrading, the constant push towards distension,
enlargement - the engorgement of the machinery devouring capital, time,
resources. Driven by media hype and new Net applications, replacement
becomes flow or flux; capital becomes necessary excrement. One's rela-
tionship to other users is becoming increasingly mediated; capital 
drives communication directly on the Net, and it is time to recognize
this fact - to recognize that the fetishization is no longer of specific
components/objects, but a fetishization of the flow itself, its sub-
structural component of capital - a fetishization of _manageriality_ as
it applies to both consumption and knowledge, which are becoming, not
only intertwined (How many hits has this page!) but one and the same...
The Net _user_ becomes a consumer always engaged in _strategies of pro-
duction,_ increasing bandwidth, applications, sensory modalities, speed,
multi-tasking...

And production, which is always construct, must be doubly coded: first, 
on the (previous and continuous) level of address, protocol, and recog-
nition - i.e. _occupying_ a space which is equivalent to one's presence
in that space, one's name - but second, on the level of _continuous im-
plementation as well_ - upgrading for example from IPhone N to IPhone 
N+1, or taking on another voice application altogether, with or without
payment of registration fees. The _hysteria_ behind this is not the
hysteria of Veblenian conspicuous consumption, but that of being found
_voiceless,_ excluded from a/the community of participants. Thus soft-
ware is continuous, learning is continuous as well - new micro-languages
(Iptscrae for example), new protocols, even new IP and URL addresses,
patterns of behavior, friends and acquaintances, lovers, hysteric bodies,
lives, worlds...

It is all a question of encoding, decoding; it is all the flood of capi-
tal redefining priorities and the very ability to speak, to be heard, to
hear, _to be present._ And this is of course the very real danger of the
Net, this constant drive towards further engorgement, this consumption - 
a danger both in terms of the limited and problematic demographics that
ensue, and in terms of the psychological model at work here - one in 
which it appears as if the body itself is rewarded through capital...

Further, there is no end in sight. At the moment, we are operating on
a traveling wave - we can upgrade for example to radio networking, free-
ing us from the domination of the wires, but we will still have to type
in our commands - the day when the Net becomes fully prosthetic and the
body becomes fully cyborg in return, is at least a decade away. And even
then, it will be several decades before the implementation of seamless
virtual reality - plugging into the Matrix as another/same world - and
then, even then... So at the moment, there is no _apparent_ end in sight,
nothing to slow the machinery (and as I've pointed out, the machinery
then becomes flow itself, no longer "personal," but temporary vortex at
best) - and so?

And so, given this hysteria, given the market, it may be time to examine
the phenomenology of capital once again - after Marx and after Deleuze/
Guattari, say...

"Underneath all reason lies delirium, drift. Everything is rational in
capitalism, except capital or capitalism itself." (Gilles Deleuze in 
Felix Guattari, Chaosophy) Can one say that the Net is delirious, that it
is being driven by market forces traveling across the embedded hysteric
body? Can one say that the BWO (body without organs) is dis-membered, 
dis-assembled, into a hundred, thousand, million - not plateaus, not 
nearly so stable - but organelles, dividing, subdividing, upgrading, 
uniting? That the _body is lost to the subject_ who has already been
disassembled, that the dispersed or distributed subject locates in the 
Net the potential for reconstitution - the work_station replacing him or
her - that desire is now the desire of the work-station? Can one insist
on the fact, clearly, that the classical Marxist distinction between
exchange value and use value is lost in cyberspace - that they become
one and the same, and that their intersection is precisely, simultaneous-
ly, information and disembodiment? That information is always already the
dispersion of the body? And that finally, that mediation itself is in 
constant need of upgrading, that mediation itself is mediated - not in 
the sense of infinite regress, but in the sense of the hysteric passage 
and recapitulation of time, of temporality?

It is in these terms that one can begin rethinking the Net, and its dri-
vers, terms which splinter upon closer examination, terms, in fact, of
_melange._

Magic Plank


But it's magic; the plank harbors over 1500 pages of text I have written,
memories that can be recalled long past the dissolution of their indirect
addressing. My fingers cross, caress the plank, which always responds and
always perfectly. Error resides within me, I have sinned; the plank con-
tains the future of all culture, my legacy. 

It requires maintenance. It requires charging and recharging and the sites
it has placed and exhausted on the Net require confirmation and occasional
movement. Oh I have traveled in this fashion from one continent to another.
Oh I have carried my belongings upon the back of ftp. Oh digital, they have
not been transformed in the process, nor decayed, nor home to noise and co-
rruption. Perfect, they have wandered, whenever dwelling has been offered.

Through the milk-glass of its screen, I glimpse into the aquarium in which
the remnants of the mirror stage, _the text of the mirror stage,_ has been
inserted. It expands beyond, above and below; it expands before and after.
Swollen, it consumes me; distended, the magic _takes._ I am heard in and
within, through the magic. It is the magic without fetishization, without
subject and object; it is the magic with protocol alone, the beautiful re-
cognitions. 

It is the recognitions that are perfect, even as this body, _this_ body, 
is not. It is the recognitions that remain shuttled among zero and one, on
and off, this and that, here and there, now and then. What is lacking is
between; my legacy is kept in the midst of the shuttling...

Meandering and Failing Saying Nothing

Poor Thinking and Weak Thought

Feverish Thought and Losing All Control


I don't think I've said everything I've wanted to say. Because this magic
box transforms me into a constant state of servitude, and if not this box
then another - it is neither the box nor the principle of the thing, but 
the continuous deformation of reality, of the ability to _communicate_
anything whatsoever. A certain nervousness attends here; it is all too
possible to crash a system, create an impediment, bring an email account
to a standstill, even interfere with the clean and proper operations of
others on the Net. The depth of crashes varies widely; one must be con-
stantly vigilant, as if one's tongue were always in danger of falling out
of one's mouth, the teeth too...

What could the result of this be, if not stress, surviving in intermedi-
ary modes, lodged in the midst of things like a pebble in the throat?
Whatever is solid today, melts tomorrow, absorbed or forgotten by another
upgrade; whatever momentary talk one has on the Net, say, in Web Chat 
_now_ is likely to be lost in a year, a month, a day, as whole populations
move from one and another site, always on the go, driven by hysteric cap-
ital. And what is actually being _said_ within these environments? Almost
everyone I have contacted with Iphone has been male, middle- or lower-man-
agerial class, running a small business, using Iphone for relaxation much
as amateur radio has been used. Discussions range from equipment to the
quality of voice and back again, touching on various aspects of the Inter-
net. This leads me to believe that different applications/environments 
have different and widely-ranging demographics - but whatever they are,
they're on the move, repeating, and like me, true to form.

On the other hand, as I've also pointed out, there are darknet behaviors
and applications, like IRC, which remain as such, building deep community,
outside the corporate run. But these sites are rapidly becoming the excep-
tion, as the surface Web and client-server technology off SLIP or PPP
grows, exfoliates, encrusts.

So I don't think I've said everything I've wanted to say, because I have-
n't said much about the sickness that accompanies all of this, real phy-
sical sickness, nor the trembling, nor the stress as finance and crashes
continue to take their toll. The goal of information continues to recede 
as well - what _do_ you want to learn/do/experience here? Instead, one is
shuffled with others like cyborgs herded into streams and rivers of band-
width, as if... as if one is actually _doing_ something, _creating_ in
the larger sense of things...

We're desperate for talk, we're desperate for entertainment, we're des-
perate for companionship. We're _nothing if not desperate._

(We think poorly. We repeat ourselves over and over again. We dance around
capital because capital's inert, obdurate, stony, like the real. It's the
real which encroaches here, there, everywhere. Spittle falls from our lips
because we know this and say it repeatedly. We're given the space to re-
peat, just like we're given the space of embodiment, because we've given
capital for it, capital for our bodies. We're tethered by our nipples in a
manner of speaking, manner of thought; our breasts are pulled from us 
until they lactate. Words ooze from our genitals. We're still allowed to
fuck in this space if we pay for the video but maybe not much longer. May-
be in America we can be the clean and proper bodies always wished for us. 
Then we'll go to code, and that will increase the sickness and the fevers,
increase the trembling and the shivering deep into the night. We think
poorly about this, though; _we're weak._ There's not much we're given to
do.)

_Go to the code._ Steal it. Sabotage. Pay for your eyes and ears. Don't
pay for anything else. Do the time: Flat rate!
