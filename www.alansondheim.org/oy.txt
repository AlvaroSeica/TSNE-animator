What plays in the Imaginary stays in the Imaginary.

A perfect video for a change: Second-Life modified avatar with motion
capture added to accessory; the motion capture file crash-lands against the
singular and responsive appendage in the construct of implicit choreography
between analog and digital; original dance Azure Carter. Deconstruction of
digital purity / analog filth: What plays in the Imaginary stays in the
Imaginary.

Why should you care about this? Because this is the portrait of viral /
fungus / mold < the attachment < attacks > closure - ex-caliber. Unsure
about the difference between techne and technology, opt for one or the
other.

http://www.asondheim.org/ronin.mp4 yes well a bit clearer.

So yes, there should be an accompanying text. But what could I do? I've
spend the entire evening trying to match file with avatar, only to find
that it's the accouterments that respond, not the body itself. The body
displaces its movements onto the accouterment. Ornament becomes central.
Yes, there's very little beyond ornament. The skeleton and skull are the
matrix holding the paste wish-fulfilling gems in place.

the dim

It's a dim day today, I've shared my family again with all of the 
Democrats who would have voted Green in the last election, you remember 
the one when I found that cute dog on the street the other day, well it 
turned out it belonged to someone on the next block so I returned it with 
great happiness. Now it's raining out and I'm waiting for Madge to call, 
well Made and I don't get along so well, do we, Tim? Tim's Madge's 
husband, and we've gone the rounds a few times I can tell you. My mom's 
always saying "you never know" but I always reply "you sure do don't you" 
just like when she says "I'm going to call dad" and I say "what are you 
going to call him" and she says "i'm going to call him dad" or something 
like that. Now it's starting to rain out or at least it's getting it's 
getting darker and that smudgy feeling when you look out the window. The 
traffic light's changed again, it always does that this time of day.

go to this one, it's spectacular
last of the avatar with the white thing modulated by motion capture, I 
love these two combined into one they're not too large I promise.

script with stupid question


is this a found script or one i created ? does it really matter? given the 
relatively small number of symbols, it would be reasonable to apply coding 
to it - a matrix/template that might slide across the apparent grid, 
producing meaning. one might think of this as a _universal machine_ 
applicable to texts of any length; it becomes increasingly evident that 
meaning is a construct _across_ symbols, neither within them nor within 
the dictionary translation / transliterations.

here, in this example, only in this particular example, one has a section 
of what seems to be an _infinite text,_ a text in the manner of a bandage 
or suture across the wound of a sememe (what reads as a sememe); a wound 
within, unconstrued within, the imaginary. think of this as the _lid_ of 
the _pre-linguistic_ - not exactly mode, but a potential for interpreta- 
tion, sliding out and against itself, as soon as one is found. nothing 
holds here, not even "here," not even place or placement. the lesson, 
where we are, where we are not, is always already unlearned.

self portrait as a Bodhisattva




sickness was near

avec Maud Liardon et Foofwa d'Imobilite choreograph

upon the moment of the rose M Rilke

you will move your hands and you will move your hands
and your hands will turn against the air, wandering
into being, the village cut of heaven, sheets of pages,
books and ground absence
                         for whom the mirror, journey,
against the tain, back to back, where words grow
only within the sea drowned in sea, air drowned
in air, Raron

Nah war die Krankheit

Dreamwork/Codework rough notes


Erst in dem Doppelbereich
werden die Stimmen
ewig und mild. (RMR)

in the double realm of work / dream ~ work / dream / real - then to 
confront work / code ~ work / code / ecriture -
scaffolding slides against scaffolding ~ raster against raster

the symbolic matrix / dream ~ protocol / code

what is the work of the dream ? making sense of the (wor)l<d>
what is the work of the code ? problematizing sense of the wor(l)d

double work of the dream: the dream is _worked_ - energy expended in its 
production, energy expended in the production of the mise en scene; and 
the dream _works_ - transforms anomaly into homeostatis. in _dreamwork,_ 
the dream sutures and stitches the wounded.

double work of code: the code is _worked_ - energy expended in its produc- 
tion, energy expended in the production of its graphemic output; and the 
code _works_ - transforms output into semantics. in _codework,_ code both 
sutures and ruptures, stitches and wounds.

the _codework of the dreamwork_ - dream decoding and production (symbolic) 
the _dreamwork of the codework_ - code decoding and a-production 
(imaginary)

There is no _fundamental unit_ of either code or dream; code runs into the 
discursive formation described by Christian Metz in his film semiotics - 
it slips, just as dream slips in a more acceptable analysis.

welcoming remains, demarcation a ruptured effusive memory.

alias 


Alias - One has an alias - the connotation is that of subterfuge (but not 
necessarily). Feynman writes about alias as a question of raster - think 
of alias, aliasing, as the return of the repressed of the real - what 
can't be accommodated is transformed by the upper ceiling of the bandwidth 
into rhythmic structuring - of course if the unaccommodated - one might 
say unaccountable - is itself within a relatively steady-state. Look for 
alias / aliasing in the real, for the location of what might pass for 
primordial - what whispers in spite of everything.

Aliases and rhythm - but given the potential of alterity, a face without 
content, a face elsewhere than the Other - the rupture itself, aliasing 
itself, may take on the appearance of a masquerade (i.e. of the second 
order). Hence what is apparent may be the extrusion or residue of 
insufficient bandwidth, and if we generalize, we might find that the 
appearance of the real is always already alias, construed as appearance, 
forced into its return.

Is sampling always inadequate? Don't we make these decisions in the first 
place, in relation to human perception? Think of the alias as a wound - 
wound as gateway - or diacritical mark. Here is where the digital meets 
the analog - or at least where catastrophe meets emission - where emission 
is channeled...

There is something deep here, more than meets the eye ...

=========================================================================

Thus - to a future editor:

I am writing as quickly as possible before I die. For example, the concept 
of 'alias' I employ here might well lead to a phenomenology of the imag- 
inary. But who has time to complete this? Furthermore, my work is full of 
misspellings, errors of grammar, confusions and awkwardness of style. I 
hope these will be corrected. I am blind to them. Even with copy-editing, 
I am blind to them. But they are present as the real is present, and as 
such, are erroneous; they conjure only what the alias permits. The sememe 
is catastrophically shattered in such, and most likely in all, instances. 
So the act of correction must be an active one - not merely copy-editing, 
but editing for content, deep-editing, correcting faults, and restoring 
the texts to their (non-existent and accurate) originals.

There is something deep here, more than meets the I ...

The gods.


You have heard the tales of white birds, wings from dawn to dusk.
They fill the sky with translucence, muffle the shape of clouds.
Their cries gave someone the idea of language and mourning.
The utterance of the first word, 'inconceivable.'

The bittern knows the gods.

Tonight the gods will descend upon the earth.
They will sink into the earth, but only so much into the earth.
Sinking as if the soil were damp or marsh, unable to cope.
Unable to cope with so much deity, nonetheless resistant.
All gods are jagged gods and all gods are desperate.
All gods are the shifters in language of the second person.
Gods create the third person from the second person.
And beyond the third, a fourth, and beyond a fourth, the fifth.
Once the gods are created they are released.
That is one of the definitions of the gods. 
The gods descend like rain into meadows and wild fields.
Fields lain fallow or fields of unspoken appearance beneath glacier and 
stream.
Planted, their root systems are shallow, winds will trample them.
Storms will weigh them down with the pleasure and fecundity of water. 
It is the incoherency of the gods that is their definitions.
What is released is incoherent, what is coherent is framed, what lies 
between them is aliased.
The aliasing of the gods is the jagged of the gods and the names of the 
gods, who abjure names.
The punishment of naming names, the punishment of names.
Like sea oats like ocotillo like willows like quaking aspen, 
slight movements of the gods shimmer the murmurs of the worlds.
Gods are worlds, are incoherent worlds, every definition a definition 
of the gods.
They come in winter. They reside.
Tonight the gods descend upon the earth.
They descend into the soft earth, they sink into the soft earth.
They are invisible to us, we are invisible to them.
The slightest impressions as they bend, move silently, the slightest 
sounds, their murmuring.
All gods are smoothed, all gods are filled with the quietude of rustlings, 
unfathomable beauty, mist at dawn, the vertical.

Heidegger's Hut

poised among the fourfold, the lure of new man, new development, and 
yet... closer to fourfold, among uncounted elements, unaccounted-for. for 
often I have approached this live or in dream to little avail; I would 
wait for clearing weather, for the world to happen, for technology to 
disappear at the base. Heidegger remains there above his troubled 
politics, of which there is no counting-four; we are close to hearth, we 
are embers among the dying worlds. Soon the snows will melt, glaciers 
disappear; the hut stays on a lure, overlooking resettled life, spaces a 
thousand kilometers long, an empyrean high. I cannot imagine a world such 
as this, life in hut corner, close to warmth, old wooden bench and bed, 
columnar spirit emerging to heavens' other worlds. We live in imaginary 
solace, his hut our own, released to the elements and beyond, transformed. 
There is no journey in the journey, no dream in the dream. One has life 
only for so much sorrow. Glow remains the last of our eyes. Hearth warms, 
beyond.

Rilke's Death from development, of angels, welkin reminders, of what might 
have been, here, among other valleys' roots, like magma, poured spirit one 
and then another; furious angels! invisible, whose arms illuminate the 
night harrowed from animals wounded, animals dying; among all orders, a 
command. With what might one counter the thin edge of the Real?; with what 
countenance?; with what countenance will Any listen? Multiples move, among 
multitudes; crossed by elk, by deer, by wolves, kestrel-binding holding 
fields (these wait for No One)

What hovers, soars (these move for No One)

aliasing i ii i

what happens when the real is aliased, when the shifted world shifts 
shifters against its shifty self. yes for the punning, but the bones are 
there beneath the surface. what occurs within the digital never stays 
within the digital; what occurs within the analog stays within the analog.
this is silent film.

at youtube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti0NN6iH2Ig - stranger
longer but not much - http://www.asondheim.org/eked.mp4 - much clearer

when continuum devolves into segments, aliasing ii: the world stutters and 
re-stutters; nothing is visibile; eyes squint to make sense of it all. 
what happens in the analog stays in the analog; good luck with seeing the 
real.

Ship and Bell


"We therefore infer that the _effects of different permanent disturbing 
forces acting under similar conditions on the same coordinate are not 
simply proportional to their respective magnitudes but depend on their 
periods."

"We therefore infer that _a disturbing force whose period and real expo- 
nential are nearly the same as those of any one free vibration produces a 
large forced vibration._"

"We conclude that _one effect of the resistances on a disturbing permanent 
force, which would otherwise produce a magnified forced oscillation, is to 
modify that oscillation and to keep it within bounds._"

"In the same way _heavy church bells_ can _be easily set in motion_ pro- 
vided the pulls are properly timed. To increase the oscillation each rope 
should be pulled only when it is descending. A large heavy ship can be 
made to roll, when its natural time of oscillation is required, by running 
a gang of men to and fro across the deck at the proper time; the men run 
uphill."

(from Advanced Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies, Edward John Routh)

But if the men run uphill, surely the oscillation will ultimately be 
damped since their effect in total would be to reduce the roll? Or does 
the natural time depend on the minimization of the roll? Suppose on the 
other hand the men run to and fro at the proper time - running downhill. 
Then the oscillations will possibly increase as energy is added on the 
downswing. With the descent of the bell, a pull raises it further, 
increasing the potential energy. With the rolling of the ship, potential 
energy is increased as the men running downward add to the slope. However 
if upon running downward, the ship is rising, then the damping effect 
might slow the rising of the ship, just as, if running upward, the ship is 
sinking (sloping downward), the running will become first flat, then down- 
ward, carrying the energy downward and pulling the roll. If the roll is 
pushed, the roll is damped, if the men are running upward; if the roll is 
pulled, the roll increases, if the men are running downward. The men run 
first upward, then level, then downward, or first downward, then level, 
then upward. Perhaps damping in the second case, increasing in the second. 
Suppose the men _always_ run upward, then as the ship levels, the men stop 
running; as it continues downward, the men turn around and run upward; the 
damping is doubled. Suppose the men _always_ run downward, then as the 
ship levels, the men stop running; as it continues upward, the men turn 
around and run downward, the increase is doubled. By "doubled" one means 
the force is applied twice on the swing, depending on the tilt of the 
ship. In both cases, of the bell and the ship, gravity is paramount; one 
runs or pulls against it, or one runs towards it, in which case pull is 
impossible; however, a second cord might in fact pull the bell in an 
opposite direction, just as the men might jostle from one side of the ship 
to the other. Is this resonance, or the orders given to men, the acts of 
men? The men follow the pull and push of the bell, slope of the deck of 
the ship; there is no natural swing or pull here, only culture, commands, 
actions in unison. The ship stops rolling or rolls over; the bell stops 
ringing or turns full on its pivot. In any case, the dynamics are both 
evident and peculiar; the men must experiment, over and over again, to 
find the proper resonance, response. It is a difficult problem, settled 
only in church, on the high seas, even though the dynamics are evident.




(From http://www.asondheim.org/biog.txt -)


2007 almost: This memo, memorial, memory, memory-graph, meme, remembrance, 
autobiography, reminiscence, mnemonic, skitters back-and-forth; it remains 
undone; there's nothing of _thought_ in it; what remains are events; 
they're already dissolving; I can't "believe" events.

2007 This is the year beginning in cold rain. I think about the biog.txt 
to date - not only skittering, but awkwardly written - an occasional turn 
of phrase as if it makes any difference. There are no New Years resol- 
utions - just to continue with music / video / texts etc. Everything (when 
I think of it) appears scattered; the biog.txt represents so little of the 
world I've inhabited, or dreamed of inhabiting. It's an attempt to corral 
the scattering of my material culture, memories, after my death. When you 
read this, think that behind every word was a Proust, behind every Proust, 
yet another. And how worlds shatter, imminent, with death! - What has been 
ordered, treasured, conceived - what has been familiar, loving, cherished 
as the pages of a book are cherished - becomes the debris of others - 
everything is torn asunder, wounded, just as the world falls apart, less 
and less rebuilt elsewhere. Think of these sections, then, as the last 
remnant of coherency - what remains of an infinite richness of thought. 
Worlds devolve words devolve, hold fast, at least momentarily, past the 
living body, sunk into living language. Everything else, except perhaps 
for Azure, for Joanna, leaves and forgets the shattering which releases, 
not light, but order returned to substance. There is more to me than there 
is to the sun, to any star; there is less and less upon inclement return. 
And today, yesterday on the cusp, the announcement of the 3kth soldier to 
die in Iraq, all worlds, words, crashing to the ground, revised in the 
false resurrection of the war memorial. The rain falls against orders, 
against commands; we're lost, against all odds.
