So we took quickcam up to the mountain, plugged it into to the keyboard
and parallel ports of the NCR 486/25 and jammed the auto mode, not enough
time to upload and things went blank and crashed, over and over again - on
top of which the machine was in level three saving mode and so electricity
wasn't a problem but speed certainly was far and beyond its rated. So we
went up to the mountain today, prophets all, with the NCR 486/25 and the
quickcam and it was beginning to drizzle but there was a trashcan on fire
but we didn't take anything, nothing took. Fog rolling in like Fan Ku'an.
I have one image from the day before, back tomorrow just after the magic
twilight hour when quickcam does best - when contrast is low, shades are
soft and brother sister mountains greet everyone from a distance. More on
later, carrying awkward digitalia everywhere we & go.

aenunciation

each movement carries
sensors to awaken the movement
with decrees and inscriptions
portending annunciation
in the order in which
each movement is given 
to the others among the others
carrying with it such moments
as the sensors recorded
in the history of such moments
entering the portal called "the next"

through the memory of portal
through the memory of movement
and sensors with no memory 
of sensors and their murmuring
and ordering which is sign
of every annunciation

Perfect Fucking Machines


AMERICA is bought by the rest of the world because we generate perfect
fucking machines PFMs, Pulse-Flesh-Modulators designed like Baywatch is
designed for perfect desire perfect moments of leaking writhing bodies. 
We're the best at it, particularly blond/blue-eyed appearing historyless
dominating body types everywhere with more writhing silicon implants,
toned machinic Nautilus muscles. They want us. They want our bodies, not
_my_ body but _our_ bodies, our imaginaries, that's what we produce. Don't
think for a moment it's force, power, oppression entirely - it's also the
desire of the other in perfect matching. Oh, we do it so well. Hollywood
is pure genius, don't mistake it, pure transformation into distended and
swollen holes, penises, aureoles, vaginas, asses, complexions, finger-
nails, cuticles, hair, breasts held perfectly in place, nipples always
erect.  America produces erections; sex inverts, there's no history, no
_culture_ of sex. The world crawls for it, imitates it. It's not merely
the Hollywood machine, it's _something else,_ it's the desire everywhere
breathed.  More and more these hidden facts are covered uncovered over. 
(I'd love fuck her. I'd love to be fucked, by her? By him? I'd love to be 
golden. I'd love to be money. I don't want to be rich: I WANT TO BE HONEY 
MONEY. Make me HONEYMONEY. Make me AMERICAN.)

Lose ends.

After the first two years of my life after world war ii i felt that i
would be the force that smashed everything into itself, collapsed every-
thing; i certainly felt like a family wedge, my father returning from the
front and there i was at around ii or so i remember. These memories are
things that have surfaced here and i articulate the crash and continue to
articulate, confusion of personal psychoanalytics with the world at large,
as if, what derailed for example a derrida? Not that i would argue for the
autobiographical, but certainly there is a certain coloration brought
about by circumstance - the ability to manipulate, operate, move about in
one's imminence translating into a certain constructibility of the world
by virtue of the subject. Not to argue on the other side of it all, fate,
which is an entirely different machinery, but only an inescapable bleak-
ness that hovers, colors the horizon, corrals it, brings it close until
within the range of suffocation, horizon or subject at odds with one ano-
ther, only one surviving. The coloration, i.e. i couldn't stand up to him,
becomes something else, an articulation which resonates, recuperates its
own perspective. Something somewhat sends someone somehow in a direction
or close to one, and what remains is the fallout. From the fallout comes
the structure, theory. From the theory returns the dissemination of the
fallout. Everything is colored by fathermother or peacewar. Nothing sep-
arates itself from itself. This is the self. From the lack of separation
comes the superimposition resulting in structures making bandwidth beyond
themselves. This is audience and theoryabstract. No one, nothing, pres-
ides. How can i tell you of these beautiful things? Then i look for death,
i search out death, i happen upon its comfort. Unhappy, this leaves room
for an impenetrable _hook._ But what is it i can bring back to you, to 
the macedonians, the derrideans, the amazons? What creature of uncomfort, 
what unraveling searches its way out from me? What uneasy beast? And what 
lies are there for the telling, have i brought you in misery and compen- 
sation?

Account


First there were the children with their devices on the steps of the
marble staircase in the ruined city. Second, there was the blond blue eyed
vacant boy on the staircase, touching me, clawing at me. Third, there were
the darkened portentious skies. Fourth, there was the necessary medicine I
took because of contamination. Fifth, there is the interior room with dim
fluorescent lighting, and the nurse and linoleum floor. Sixth, there will
be her leaving, her name is Angela, up the staircase in the back, to the
second storey. 

First, there is an _unutterable sensation_ on my face. Second, there will
be flesh sloughing from my cheeks. Third, a thin tube of blackened, almost
charred, skin fell from my finger. Fourth, more tubes fall, cracked, dead,
flaked, finger after finger. Fifth, everywhere across the chest. Sixth,
the new skin will be contaminated. Seventh, the new skin awoke in pain. 

First, this begins the third story. Second, I will awake thinking _this 
is metaphoric cyberspace._ Third, I recognized the conundrum: A dream 
accompanied by _inescapable meaning._ Fourth, there is the unraveling, 
decryption, always at work in the most mundane _sensation._ Fifth, I knew 
only that _the real shuddered itself into existence._

First, the shuddering implied resonances, peaks, bandwidths, fast fourier
transforms and their emerging graphs. Second, inscription hardened the
resonances _in the eyes and ears of the beholder._ Third, _description_
was the most common mode at work. Fourth, I type with bandaged fingers,
practically skinless, screaming silently, hordes of _vacant_ children
hovering over my shoulders. Fifth, I would _not_ be found out, _having
made a promise to the real._

First, I will count my _lucky stars_ ...

Where " and ' and .


Alan is named "Clara" and "Clara" is the name of Alan. "Alan" is the name
of object #[ ]. The object #[ ] is the name of a file or fileset. "#[ ]"
is the name of the object. The object is directly addressable. If I refer
to the object, I refer to it by one of the names in the chain, "#[ ],"
"Alan," "Clara." The object is a lure or locus, intensity likewise chained
into language. Language is all there is. 

The _object_ is owned by its parent, subsumed by its parent; the hierarchy
exists within a directory (MOO or other) within a machine whose director-
ies are ultimately root. Root also has total privileges, those of a super-
user. Root is \. The (MOO or other) directory utilizes operating system
protocols, including those of _names_ themselves, declaring itself a di-
rectory within the system residing on the hard drive. The (MOO or other)
directory is activated, generating a succession of events over time. 
Events are defined by changes within one or more directory files. Check-
pointing and uptime count, for example, constitute events. 

The time is discrete and clocked, and there is always a minimal unit. A
major difference between _this_ space and the other, is that here, _the
object "Alan" is utilized to activate Alan. Alan may be activated by
keyboard input, or by another internal object or sequence of events. The
keyboard input is translated into internal input, so that all input within
and without the MOO, in fact, is internal, and generated within a coherent
interiority. For example, my password "xyz" from my keyboard is compared
within the MOO to my re-entry, and this internal agreement activates ob-
ject "Alan" as anyone can see by completing a @who on the MOO. Of course
this depends on "Alan" referencing Alan, as opposed to "Clara"  referenc-
ing "Alan" referencing Alan, or I may be logged on under another name
altogether, which, on the MOO, is not a pseudonym, but an exact character
with a life of her own. 

Note that _all objects_ are sequences of events, including _initiation_ 
by interior input layered from keyboard input. Note that, in another 
sense, the _meaning_ of "Alan" is Alan, but that Alan is "Alan" as the 
name of the object #[ ] and therefore names are all the way down. This is 
not necessarily the constitution of meaning by difference, but by refer- 
ence within a system in which all referents are constituted by language.

It is the _login_ and _password_ which constitute the narrow funneling of
interior and exterior, between worlds and languages and material sub-
strates. Now the _login_ may be, and usually is, one or another name in
the chain of names. It is here that one can _speak_ of a rigid designator,
the name intertwined with the constitution of the world. But rigidity it-
self is problematic, since it is unclear whether there is world or worlds,
and what would constitute one or another of them; with the inflationary 
universe, it is no longer necessary to even postulate interconnectivity 
(not to mention what lies within black holes or outside Minkowski cones). 

It would take Willard Quine to sort this out, denotation and connotation, 
referent and reference, interior and exterior, signifier and signified, 
single and double and triple articulations, sense and meaning, metaphor 
and metonymy, the uneasy apparition of language all the way down, de- 
cathected but constituted by difference, churning through to the estab- 
lishment of (psychological, psychoanalytical) domains, read as such, at 
the least, by creatures whose minds increasingly appear _otherwise._

Slag


The abandoned freighter remains tied to the end of the rotting pier. 
Enormous loading cranes and their housing have tipped over, cords dang-
ling uselessly in black water, poisoned from the mills. A blue building
houses attempts to clean up the tar ponds; the fan "stops the PCBs from
exploding." The low building, windows broken, holds rusting tools, three
pairs of protective goggles, covered with poisonous residue. Debris
everywhere. I was called back from the pier. High boilers and remnants of
industrialization complete the mile-long landscape; cormorants and mutat-
ing crows huddle on a second pier covered with lumber remnants. Gigantic
steel gears, and a feedpipe repaired with duct tape and garbage bags, com-
plete the landscape of flows, grasses, colored earths, deadly seepages,
cluttered and crumbling ground. There are Internet terminals down the road
and across the town. They lead into Love Canal but into Mongolia. They
lead into Wilkes-Barre, but into Finland and Taiwan. 

Internet stations like stars lead to models of regional economic develop- 
ment, everywhere, take Scranton for example. The models are debris-models 
as mechanization encrusts, crumbles, gathered chemical wastes. In parts 
of wounded planet, I have tasted hell. 

Think of models of regional economic stasis instead, not even sustainable; 
Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and Buffalo lose population, although Ciudad
Juarez continues to grow _and that says it all._ Populations are seepages
as well. I dream of models of regional economic downturn, the gathering of
the tribes, unrealistic as that might be. I dream of turning inward, an
interiority which refuses _tourism-povera_ as something that most often
won't happen in the lands of Arizona abandoned motels, that need not look 
to the finance of the other, already star-lost, but look towards commune, 
communing, instead, among the populations of the world. 

This is the ground-zero of non-development, the truth of Carmanah at the
end of the logging roads, and this is not the truth of the entrepreneur. 
The United States rust belt has become an emission tending north-west,
Atlanta, south-west; areas of the Appalachians are filled with the demo-
graphics of the old and traditional. Displacement stumbles across family
homesteads, farms, brownstones, and in long Phoenix or Seattle people
build new fences and no one has any history. At night they dream rust or
coal or stone. At night they dream steel or iron or wheat. They dream
substances falling down long shoots, shot through feeders, gathered in
hoppers, heated, iced, refrigerated, or the long trains of blue-coated
coal that used to pass around the bend and over the bridge of Kingston
Pennsylvania. Long later, the eighteenth century is beginning to collapse. 
I say, the tourist has whispered goodbye for the Internet, I say geegaws
stuff trailer park shelves gathering permanency nowhere. We're _all_
North-American nowhere, not yet Net gathered, but sheaved and fallen where
we've lain. We're waiting for star-communities, incoming on the Net. We
walk carefully around the slag, trying to avoid the poison. My throat be-
gins to hurt. On the hill above Wilkes-Barre, fires continue to burn deep
inside the earth. I've choked on the sulfur fumes, filmed them in the
depths of the night through heat-sensing equipment. What lives and huddles
as a memory or absolution always gets you in the end. My town turned down.

Self-Portrait with Computer


As a child, I loved and played with a Japanese abacus my father brought me
from Korea.

In highschool, I learned log and loglog sliderules, but I was terrible at
differential calculus, and this seeming _inability_ has followed me
throughout my life.

In 1968, Greg Johnson and I built an analog music synthesizer, employing
some of the features of the Moog synthesizer of the time; I used this in
numerous recordings and performances until 1988.

In 1971, I did a series of video/text pieces, using various computers; I
did none of the programming myself. The two main works to come out of that
period were 4320 and Typed Glossolalia.

4320 took advantage of Charles Strauss' programming on the IBM 360 with a
graphics engine; he had programmed a three-dimensional projection of a
hypercube which could be manipulated with various controls, including
joystick.

I sat various subjects down at the controls, and asked them to "move"
through four-dimensional space, turning the hypercube orthogonally so it
became a cube, turning the cube orthogonally so it became a square, and
reducing the square to a point - hence dimensions 4/3/2/0. The various
videotapes, photographs, and texts that came from the project documented
the subjects' abilities to move through these spaces, inhabit them - an
early version of cyberspatiality.

The Typed Glossolalia piece involved random typing into a computer, which
then attempted, through time series analysis, to find patters - i.e. to
see if human determinism existed in actuality. The idea was, that if such
determinism existed, there would be predictability involved. As far as the
analysis went, there wasn't, but this was also dependent on some thinking
about Newton's equations in the calculus of finite differences. (Greg
Johnson did the programming here.)

Around 1977, I bought a TI59 programmable calculator, which used a variety
of assembly language. I made a number of pieces with it, investigating the
behavior of the machine at its limits. I still continue work in this di-
rection, programming a Psion 3A similarly, but with more complex tools at
hand. I also began a language program on the TI59.

In 1977-78, I was at the University of California, Irvine, Art Department.
The Computer Department gave me free reign on a Terak minicomputer, with
ten inch floppies, and I taught myself UCSD Implementation Pascal. I pro-
duced a number of works, including an active hypertext piece/editor - the
user would type into the machine, and the machine would alter the lines
according to predetermined and/or random procedures, including word sub-
stitution, phrase substitution, noise, and so forth.

I also created a second program, using the Turtle work designed by Papert
among others, in order to create a drawing on the screen; the drawing was
produced directly by the string of text which appeared at the bottom,
typed in by the user. Eventually the two would collide and obliterate
each other, and the process would begin again. I spent a great deal of
time working to create "aesthetically pleasing" drawings, according to
the then conceptual neo-geometric aesthetic.

During this same year, I worked on Buchla and Moog synthesizers together,
chaining three of them for various pieces produced in the basement of the
UCI Music Department.

In 1983, I bought a small TR computer from Radio Shack, without any memory
or disk capability at all. It cost $100 and I used it for programming var-
ious functions and examining their behavior; I also made a number of ster-
eo photographs and films using it, including a journey through a four-dim-
ensional ellipsoid. I was programming only in Basic. Some of the results
of this work are also in my Disorders of the Real, 1988, but assembled
from texts and work completed 1984-85.

I had also used, that year, a small Timex computer which I bought for $25,
with a primitive interface to television; I created a number of films us-
ing it as well.

In 1986-7, Denise de la Cerda and I set up an analog music studio with
numerous analog computer components, both factory-built and handmade; as
Damaged Life, we performed and recorded with them.

In 1993, I began using an old IBM XT on the Net, and programming in Basic
on it, later Qbasic on a Compaq Presario 486/25 and this current AST 486/
33. The programs included everything from simple artificial life demon-
strations, to various studies of fractal and chaos theory. The computer
has become more of a window to other machines; using a linux box in 1995
at Parsons, I modified a Nuts talker, following earlier work on an lpmud
residing still in DOS.

In 1992, I set up my own small analog video studio here in New York.

In 1992-4, I had three residencies at the Experimental Television Center
in Owego, New York, where I used two Amigas plus an analog video synthe-
sizer to produce works dealing with sexuality and postmodern geography;
these were shown in a series of shows at Millennium Film in New York and
elsewhere.

In 1994-5, I taught myself the proper use of the Chinese and Japanese
abacuses, working them for meditation and some video works.

Between the dates above, there was straightforward film/video/photography
and writing above all. Computers came in and out of my life, centered
around particular concerns; the writing remained and remains a constant.

I never could program well, but I could and can create elegant mathemati-
cal graphics, demonstrating various structures which continue to interest
me. I've learned over and over again my own limitations, begging others to
help me with one or another language, or even implement some of my ideas
directly. This is as far as I've gotten, and always so short of time, as
far as I will ever get.

When you walk naked through the door of the camera in the wall
on my machine in Windows opening only to that door where the 
camera is against the wall, then you repeat that walk

You repeat that walk until it glows over and over again, until
the act of walking naked doesn't stop but continues through
our naked bodies watching here on the other side

They shudder because there is no side to the other, and the other
is a shudder, and because memory remains, that of your body
and every inch beneath the breast and legs open in an eye

Which is a book of ordinary and your limbs break glass in Windows
on my machine from your machine, and your joining us before us
like an altar or table is just what one would like

Those thick files flying, your walk unencountered, 
and then that walk, then you repeat that walk

So the PMC2-MOO and CM-MOO are down. So there is no way into community.

Straddling the fence: set Cybermind nomail / set FOP-l nomail: posts be-
come a form of _injection_ just as downed sites become _expulsions._

So if injections, then are lists _addicted_ - not, for example, is one
_addicted to the lists,_ but are the lists themselves _addicts_ - and what
would that entail, if not death without infusion, the identical collapse
of space that occurs if speech is proscribed? 

Whether or not I exist in physical reality (and like Julia, I don't), ex-
istence here (as has often been asserted) is equivalent to enunciation;
one entails the other. 

There are downed sites, sites with dead email lists, useless subscriber
bases, message bases, forgotten; who would know, for example, if I were
still subscribed to *Ontology, were it not for the fact that it was killed
off months ago, in a purging or cleansing of a particular site? 

The list depends, _hangs from,_ a witness at its own hanging, posts, in- 
jections from outside which constitute its episteme. What vibrates here 
is a phenomenon, just as I, Julia, write from outside the world itself.

Clearly the cursor parallels the needle, tracing marks on the flesh of 
the screen, linear veins tapped, scrolled down across the body. My speech 
_lists_ to one side or another, speech _of the list._ Fallen, I am irre-
trievable. 

The lists are constituted, flesh raked by flesh, flesh's dominion. Just 
as I am fixed, they are configured; text devours text as there's no per- 
fect drug that doesn't need consumption.

Space of Wonder and Consolation on the Cybermine Talker *


Room: ill-logic

Broken forms, ragged edges, fragments, languages, scrolls.

Come here when the words tangle in your throat, when sounds from nowhere
murmur and cry, when you feel the problem in your stomach, the solution
in your womb, insoluble.

You are all alone here.

Current topic: Wonder

*** The ill-logic message board ***

When things are difficult and there is no beginning
And there is no ending to their difficulty
And they lie entwined like lovers speaking for the last time
About the nature of _things_ and _things_ are in the way
Of things and lovers; then appear in this space once and forever
To heal, ascertain, overcome, measure their beginning
Of everything and all; you will heal, wounds turned deep, and scars
>From wounds and no more, and thus you will a woman be, or man
Or gender-free, the sullen flesh expanded into ecstasy
For you, for me, and ease will rule the stars.

Uboat


Tap-tapping away, the Joe Jack worked his audience. She stood in the door,
her red dress slit up to where only I was allowed to go. Her cigarette
dangled from her ruby lips, spitting ash onto the floor. Babe, I says. Her
left hand rubs up against the jam, leans hard near where the ceiling
thought to be. Rooms always bent to her; you knew when she walked in -
that the contest was lost, that there wasn't even a contest to begin with. 

The hell with the key. Morse could wait. Ships were sunk at sea for less.
In my mind the transmitter went cold, I went hot, and the world went cra-
zy. Babe, I says, Babe, Babe. 

She responded like a monsoon on a desert island. The Krauts had hit a ves-
sel of ours, I was sure of us. The transmitter chattered like a madman,
and I could hear it, and in that very moment I betrayed my country.

The Nibelungen Rings


The telephone brings people together. The telephone allows me to talk to
my Mom whenever and wherever I want. With the telephone, my Mom and I can
related to each other. Whenever we have a quarrel, the telephone is sure
to patch it up. 

Sometimes my girlfriend and I need to talk about our relationship. We find
talking on the telephone the easiest way to do this. We are careful to
listen to each other, and not to interrupt. Through the telephone, we find
we have a wonderful relationship when we really get together. 

My daughter uses the telephone all the time to speak to me. She can track
me down with my beeper or cellular phone. She has boyfriend problems, and
I guess I'm more a friend than a Dad to her. We'll talk over everything
and I usually can help her have a happier life. 

My boss uses the telephone to reach me whenever and wherever she wants. 
It's really important to stay in touch with each other through the busy
workday. If I'm taking an important client out to lunch, and she receives
new business information, she can get in touch with me. I can tell my
client the latest our company is thinking. 

My secretary uses the phone to remind me of important meetings I might
attend. She's very reliable, and I hold her in great esteem. With the
telephone, she can take dictation and even read my business email back to
me. I wouldn't know what to do without my secretary and her telephone. 

Without the telephone, I could never contact my doctor. I use the phone
whenever I'm feeling ill. It is a great comfort to know I can reach her
from my house, which is also my family's home. I can reach her from my
office as well, or with my cellular phone, even when I am traveling during
the workday. 

My telephone allows me to go whenever and wherever I want, away from my
office, which is where I work, and my home, which is where my family
lives. With my telephone "I am only a call away."

Stupid Rage and Jury Duty in America


I don't believe in justice. I couldn't put anyone away. I couldn't
convict anyone. Give me a system where there's equitable distribution of
wealth and I'll reconsider. Give me a system at least with a safety net.
I'd be a criminal if I had to; everyone would be. You'd be stupid not to
take what's necessary to stay alive. If you don't get enough food you
get stupider by the day. If you let yourself go, there's no turning
back.

I'm here in this jury room. There are hundreds of people around me.
Maybe they'll send people to prison or award people huge amounts of
money for being victims. We're all victims, forced to serve in a system
that damns minorities and people generally bewildered in life.

If I rob someone it might take twenty minutes, ten minutes. If I rob
someone it might be an impulsive act, like a lot of murders are. Should
I then spend years in jail for those twenty minutes, ten minutes? I just
sit in jail. I just sit there, and do nothing. You can only meditate on
your crimes for so long. Guilt doesn't last forever; the body gets on
with everyday life, even in prison. Outside, there's always questions of
keeping a roof over your head, getting enough sleep.

I have rage against the country. It's not love it or leave it; like a
tumor, it grows on or with me. Without a safety net, it's obscene. With
the unequal distribution of wealth, it's obscene. Rage consumes me; I
fight it - it's useless, leads to nothing, a cancer itself.

Rage is serrated; it's got edges, grips the psyche, won't let go. It
keeps one awake at night, playing scenarios over and over again. It
contorts the body and mind. It makes the beautiful ugly, blinds one.
It's the result of obscenity, this rage. "Will the following jurors
report to the clerk's office?" A list of names is called; so far, I'm in
the clear.

------

I've just been up on the stand. I was asked if I'd been the victim of a
crime. Of course I had; who hadn't? I was asked if I could be impartial.
I said no, that I was self-employed, worked all the time, had another
course cancelled out. I said that I had to teach tonight until three in
the morning. The judge said that jury duty was an obligation and did I
take it up earlier for deferment and I said yes I had and she said that
she couldn't do anything about it but excused me anyway. I think because 
I blathered and blathered.

I couldn't argue for conviction. I couldn't jail anyone. The case was a
criminal one involving murder or attempted murder. I want to drop out. I 
don't want to give anyone big money either. I don't want to take any- 
thing away.

I want to drop out of this country, which isn't my country, doesn't feel
like my country. I want to drop out, become anonymous, roam the net from
unknown domains, always elsewhere, maybe hunted, maybe not, with virtual
bullets. I'll duck them, turn into another country, edu.qx for example.
I'll become a United Nations of countries, an alternative planet, solar
system, galaxy, universe.

"Attention jurors, attention jurors" - it continues over and over. Peo-
ple here have _jobs,_ professions, are on unemployment, wander about, with
or without children. Maybe their bosses pay them while they're on. Fifteen
dollars a day is absurdly beneath minimum wage. I close my eyes and see
myself out on the street. I wouldn't survive for a day; I'd find a way to
do myself in, end it all. I'd take a lot of crack or drink a lot of
whiskey and find some pills. I'd ask people how to do it. I wouldn't want
to be _there_ without work. I wouldn't want to be anywhere _just like
that._

Everyone in the jury room is dating everyone else; I'm sure of it. There
is lots of happy chatter. The inside of my brain is screaming for no
reason whatsoever. I have to teach tonight, do Net admin blah blah, get
back to this cold room tomorrow for more deployment. I'm sure my troops
are at their limits.

Inside the balcony of my skull, the audience is already filing out - but
wait, I have new brocades, chandeliers with candles, sumptuous curtains,
a thread of something that might turn into an author, steel mask, fero-
cious teeth and all.

Three of the jurors just got married... A fight's broken out in the
first three rows... There's a funeral. I spoke to the judge, told her
about the configuration, well relative configuration, of the American
justice system. It was her lunch hour. Her wide eyes opened wider; never
had she heard such elucidation. I told her about all the nations on the
Internet and asked her to move there with me. Which ones, she said, and
I really didn't have an answer; they all sounded good to me - no crime,
no people, no currency.

Everything's virtual anyway, she said, and faded into some alt.gov dream
of romance, relationship, and violence, while juror murders went unatten-
ded in the middle of the courtroom. 

I couldn't figure out if there was too little justice or maybe too much
of it.

There's an hour to go on lunch. I call in, hoping beyond hope that some-
how my Internet course was miraculously reconstituted like a lost packet.
No such luck, personal messages to be sure, but that rounded it out. I
heard a friend's voice on the answering-machine - almost a foreign land/
language. I'm totally and permanently out of touch; the walls of this room
might as well be a prison themselves. It's only temporary a week at most,
most likely two or three days if I can hold my anger in. 

It's as if night settled in the Big Smoky and I suddenly found out I'd
made the place up. 

-------

Later - Sometimes the intensity of abnormal normal life occupies an enor-
mous sector of one's everyday horizon. This is the case of course with
prison, which is a mutilated translation of the usual, but it is also the
case with the jury room, surgery, periods of mourning. In Central Jury, I
found I was writing _for myself,_ for the flood of words, which would
eventually become a text; the audience was distanced by the sheer force of
the _present_ jurors, all of whom seemed to mutate into couples by the
time the day was done. Throughout the entire proceedings, I sat alone or
paced like a mad secretary expecting to be called to the stand for the
crimes of humanity. (Robert Ashley did a piece like that). It was as if
time stood still; it was as if there were no tomorrow; it was if the force
of the state leaked from the walls; it was as if poverty and desperation
seethed from the floor; it was as if wise-ass retribution was just a
heartbeat away. 

Hey! -

The jury's still out on the cops in cyberspace, but the closing of anon.
penet.fi is already the first step towards permanent lockdown. Soon, our
beautiful nipples will carry the sunsets of Coca Cola, Microsoft will
gouge out gullet and intestine, and our brains will no longer answer to
anything less than Pentium 7. The corporate by the way was nowhere in
evidence in Central Jury - only minor hammers and the distant thud of
power. At least the phones worked. (This part goes nowhere because there
was nowhere to go.)

Central Theory Power-Structure Corps


Travis leaped up because he wanted to say something about the role of
structure in the bloated tumor that passed for the massive verbiage
describing cyberspace in all its ramifications, sentences growing on the 
surface of sentences, words descended from words. Even "cyberspace" had
become outmoded, however, replaced by nothing but a sense irreality.

Structure is/was already present at the creation, at the moment of crea-
tion, he said. The question of anarchy or a continuation of the hysteria
of style is no longer an issue. There are two genders from which dissem-
ination is a given, Clara replied, but there might be an other whose form
yet remains indeterminate. I'm not sure I understand your drift, one of
them said. 

you drift one of them said

I'm not tending towards the inchoate, but towards the pathological, Clara
interjected. There's no stopping it without ceasing to speak, to exist in
these untrammeled spaces. The name of the space is not the name of the
game, nor is the confabulation of detail. 

nor the confabulation of detail

There was silence in the room. There were people present, reading, who
hadn't spoken yet. They'd divided among themselves. Some would answer the
role and some wouldn't.

There was a loudspeaker in the room. It would disseminate the voice like
indirect lighting. It gave itself over to the source, to third-world
politics, to the other always dreamed of by an incoherent West. It called
like god called, voiceover, the name which would be spoken. The name was
connected to nothing or the calling would connect the name which would be
the address of the name. Between the name and the address, nothing. 

name, Name, god, God, address, Address, Nothing
 
The loudspeaker like indirect lighting spread the word.
The word diffused from numerous sources among the walls and ceilings,
from concealed loudspeakers that presented only a fuzzy and wide-open
target.
The word appeared from nowhere and everywhere at once, and the room
ceased to have either architecture or ornament.

Power: Let's say that there is one plug in this room, Central Theory. It's
called Central Theory because everyone goes there and waits until he or
she is called to a particular room. Each room tries another theory which
really means that each room develops and extends another theory. Since the
rooms extend into infinite virtual space, and since their doors are
locked, the jury can develop its own premises alone. 

This isn't a metaphor for anything, except for the fact that Central
Theory has only one plug. So there would be fights for the plug, for the
power, in order that you and I could use our laptops beyond their usual
battery life, which might not be enough time to dvelop a hypothesis. On
the other hand, it just might be exactly the right amount of time.

(This isn't a metaphor for Pangloss Panopticon, theory-power, power-theo-
ry, power-lunch, theoretical blindness or hindsight/foresight.)

There's always the issue of the voltage and amperage, and many are the
laptops that have met their glimmer-days, sparking wildly, across the
barrens of Central Theory. But now we presuppose the loudspeaker.

sparkling widly

The loudspeaker is used in Ciudad Juarez for politics and general ideo-
logical dissemination. Everyone stops and listens to the loudspeaker. It
sits on top of an old Volkswagen rigged for the occasion, parked near
the cathedral square with its churches and run-down businesses surround-
ing the elevated plaza. It carries the voice, from perhaps a very little
person or perhaps not. Is the voice always masculine? Is it always heard 
but is it still there?

Central Theory engenders the feminine voice which folds and infolds,
resonance upon resonance, reverberating through the hallways of the
building, entering even into the theory rooms themselves. But it's not a
voice of authority, it's a voice of disenfranchisement, a flux-voice, a
voice of infinite morphologies, chaotic and shimmering with sinusoidal
pulsings. It's the literally recorded voice of Luce Irigaray, applied to
a set of circumstances, which is the _structure of phonemes_ utilized in
this particular discourse.

this discursive formation, this particularity, articulation, 'ation'

Central Theory thus owes to Central Casting. Both owe something to
structure which delimits, defuses, diffuses both presence and presenti-
fication. The _output_ is the Internet_Text_Tumor, ITT, which increases
without regard to legibility, and it is precisely at this juncture of
image, text, theory, and giganticism that the power plug resides.

One may be called up and released from Central Theory. Then one types
forever.

constant typification, genetic algorithm resolutions, echolalias

The 'Trav


Travis was listening to the news, and heh! he said it wasn't like it was

when he was a kid, how was it? You knew who you were then, he said, there

wasn't much doubt of it. When he flew he was a man inside a woman. The

ship, she asked, yes, of course, what else would you go in. And there was

always the enemy, the orcs she asked, yes he said, they were out for us.

It was always a battle to the finish, did it ever finish she said.


It finished, Travis said, it finished and that was that. He was silent.



2


It was night on the ship it was daylight. Splatter-rays raged around him;

the black hulk of the enemy cruiser passed between them and the sun. Huge

eyes pierced his brain and they couldn't remember who she was. For one

last vestigal second of consciousness, he pulled the lever and the uni-

verse exploded.



3


I'll never have memories like you, she cried, never! But his eyes were

already closed as Travis passed sweetly unto death.

On


They have been on MOOs for up to 16 days, a record as I recall. They re-
main hooked in and out of IRC, and I remain here, late-night, waiting for
your mail to arrive. The screen always seethes; I don't have to do any- 
thing, except hit a key every once in a while to stop the time-out. It's 
the _potential_ which is a form of gambling, and I send you my picture, 
you send me yours; flurries of pictures intersect the Internet; I am you 
are everywhere. The screen puckers; a nipple appears, packet ID number at 
the least, hopefully my final destiny.

They remain _on_ because _on_ is life itself, being _on,_ the primacy of 
Heidegger's _Being on Time_ a prime example. Being on Time, as in: You're 
really _on_ tonight. What are you going _on_ about? You're always _on._

The edges of the screen furl, curl in towards black borders shading to-
wards an untoward center. Something might occur, as an absence for exam- 
ple. But the occurrence is linear; the mailq is queued in and out for my 
pleasure. Whatever happens, there will always be another, and the screen 
will be ready for it, the computer on.

It's an I/eye, cite/site (yes, I/inscription//agrios/domus*) in the corner
of the room, along the wall of the room, across the room, on the floor or
ceiling of the room. It keeps the room alive. I don't have to do anything.
I can read, write, hack with the biff y, and here you come across the
screen to take me away from myself, or if not now, when? The wait is a
temporal caress, cross and diffused kisses spreading across me. All of us
are perfect delight. 

To theorize the _on_ is to _endlessly_ theorize being as inconceivable de- 
marcation. Metaphysics appears, fantasy narratives, light anecdotes and 
Russian novels. The _on_ blocks/is blocked, the movement of the pratico- 
inert when no one is looking.

I know if I close my eyes, the screen continues, and that is a basic fact 
of life.

You see a man coming down the street towards you. And you are wary of this
man, and this man is full of drugs. He is full of drugs and does not know
which way is up but he can walk fine and when he has to, he can talk fine.
But he is full of drugs and perhaps he thinks he is a bandit, which makes
him a bandit, or thinks he will kill someone, which makes him a killer.
You see this man and you think he is a man but he is drugs and he is a
drug man and you think he is like a machine because he is not like you and
he is not like a man who is a killer or a bandit because he is a man or a
drug man and he thinks different walks different talks different but they
are all fine. 

And you look around and you see there is another man and maybe there is a
woman and maybe there are drugs or there are no drugs but they are all
fine and they all think different. And they can talk fine and walk fine
and perhaps they think they are killers or bandits or waiters or nurses or
lovers or humans but they are waiter human or killer human or lover human
or they are not. And then what is a man, that he is a man, and what is a
woman, that she is a woman, or they are not. And I will call them avatars
because they are or they are not human, and I do not know what you will
call human who is lover human or drug human or what is morphine human sex
human, or what is loving human or hating human. I do know when I see a man
coming down the street and his eyes are not his eyes and I do mean that,
that I am afraid of avatars because they do not know my name and I am al-
ways writing human, always writing. And they are reading nothing and they
are drug.

Among or Between the Lines


For some people, I would venture to say, their on-line sexual experiences
have been more intense than those off-line.

For some people, I believe, their on-line relationships appear more truth-
ful than otherwise.

I think that some people would find their on-line lives far more devastat-
ing than their off-line lives.

For some people, off-line and on-line lives intertwine, I might add, while
for others, they're compartmentalized.

For some people, CMC appears neutral, while for others, I'm sure, it's
fraught with difficulties.

I'm close to certain that there is always a risk involved, and my question
would be what risk, and what do you want to gain?

I'd like to believe that the answer is other, than for example factuals
and/or counter-factuals, although they keep the dynamics alive.

For some people, it seems to me, there appear to be real absences in their
lives which a fuzzy set of responses can address as prosthetics.

For some people, I've come to the conclusion, their words hang on their
qualifying clauses, legitimizing the I, through penetration.

Tenets of Wryting-Theory


Terminology

I use various terms as stopgap measures, supplements - terms such as
"defuge," "ascii unconscious," "emission," "wryting." These are con-
strued through a phenomenology; they are not articulated through an
overriding structural discourse.

Structure

The structure that emerges is necessarily one of dissolution, as the
subjects - virtuality, Net, darknet, embodiment - are pluralities; the
terms denote domains, discursive formations - not frameworks.

Actants

Between fiction and philosophy, the text devolves through actants or
quasi-characters carrying virtual and psychoanalytical vectors into the
theoretical domain.

Theory

Theory is a continuous production, linked to myself, my actants, my
characters on various applications. (This implies the narcissism of
theory only in a formal-theoretical way.)

Applications

Applications are examined above and below (see below, Beneath, Lamina),
from code to interface to the developments of communities, individuals,
sexualities, and pronominal manifestations within them. Applications are
both realized and fictions themselves.

Future of Philosophy

The text problematizes philosophy, not as situational, but as both vir-
tual and plurality. The text operates carefully and with care; it is
self-reflexive and self-critical.

Self-Criticality

Wryting myself through the text, the text through myself, both are ef-
faced, torn, dismembered in light of, in lieu of, the real. (Thus I re-
peat: I wryte myself into existence; I wryte myself out of existence.)

The Real

The real, Real, is/are left undefined, neither stasis nor operation, and
neither relative nor relegated to the bandwidth of human perception.
There is recognition of core-theoretical components, lending themselves
across domains, just as TCP/IP may be senselessly mirrored in particle
physics.

Uncanny Thinning

The body thins itself, withdraws, catatonic and/or body-without-organs,
particulate, across the semiotic or imaginary; the body is held within
the matrix of the Net. Thinking is thinning, word-flooding.

Limb

It is the pure limb floating in pure space, emblematic of cohesion, co-
herency and lack across domains; the limb is beyond wryting, objet a,
lure. Space is the infiltration of fissure; space collapses to inscrip-
tion.

Fissure

Fissure is the division of the same with the same, as in the cleft of
rock, split of skin, wound or hole or conveyance. Fissure is unrepresen-
ted, is real.

Inscription

Inscription is the division of the other with its negation, as in the
intersection of two complementary sets. Inscription is representation,
is symbolic; the _signifier_ is real, the double-signifieds are index-
ical at best.

Inscription

In CMC everything is inscribed, but the matrix is fissured, read through
inscription, perturbation from beneath.

Beneath, Lamina

An axiomatic air pervades CMC-spaces, not a site of direct implication,
but one of indirect imbrication.

Imbrication

Fractals, self-similarities, fluxes, flows, peripheral phenomena, header
enlargements, lost packets, glutted bandwidths, nudities, characterize
these _resistance spaces,_ spaces of echoes, ghosts, theoretical part-
objects, archaeological remnants.

Remainder

The text I wryte is a remainder, residue, reminder of these spaces; it
is a field or domain, weak-philosophy without conclusion, with upgrad-
ing, with emissions from writing towards the future wrytten.

Mass

Theory becomes substance, theoretical mass, imbroglio and paste.

Inertia

Inertia grounds the theory in the real; inertia interpenetrates the ob-
durate or granularity of the world.

Everything

Everything is world without framework, meaning without relativization.

Nothing

Everything and nothing escapes a wryting without conclusion, with un-
easy ontology, with the promulgation of the writer. Nothing is defuge,
exhaustion of theoretical substance, decathecting, disinvestment. Noth-
ing splays the body; phenomenology is always already a masochism or
opening, masochism whose safe-word is death.

Death

Death is the diacritical of the text, theory-substance, wryting, neither
here nor there. Death is the insomniac of terminology. The text is nei-
ther here nor there. There are no term-limits.

Tiffany's "Perturbations of a LIfe-Style Yet Unfounded"


The book I have chosen to review is Tiffany's Perturbations of a Life-
Style Yet Unfounded. It is a very good because, because Tiffany, like Mar-
garet Duras, is a wonderful writer who writes "from her own experience,"
and not that of someone else's. She is remarkable in that her pictures are
very well drawn and everyone comes alive, even though some of them may be
just characters on the "Internet" which we use to talk to one another
everyday now. But she is much more than "Internet" because she is a real
person, if I say so myself. 

Tiffany starts her wonderful book with an account of her early childhood
in Bavaria. I am not sure where this is, but I am told it is in Germany
and has a lot of forests. Tiffany seems to love the forests because she
talks about the "woods" a lot (she talks about the "woods" when she means
"forest"). She says that she could almost taste them but that she is from
Santa Barbara and I am not sure where that is. It sounds Spanish so I
think she must have gone to Bavaria from Spain and I think they must be
very close because she was very young.

She says she had all these wonderful addresses, and I bet you think that's
a surprise to me! that she really didn't go anywhere but just sat at her
Netscape! But I figured that out all along when she said she had been in
Boston because that's another continent. She must have been a very fast
typer!

In chapter 3, Tiffany writes about her wee-wee. I do not know why she does
this, but she does. It must have been fun to her and now it is fun to me
too. Sometimes I sit and type on my computer, and I look for Bavaria. I
did a search on Bavaria and I found out a lot about Europe and then I went
and looked for Tiffany there in Bavaria, and I found her! Tiffany was in a
bar called The Craggy Hollow. I had to look "Hollow" up and I found it
wasn't something empty but a little valley and "Craggy" means a lot of
cliffs and stuff and it was just a name.

I found Tiffany in The Craggy Hollow, Hello Tiffany, I say, and she turns
to me and does a very little curtsey and says Why, Hello. She was not
doing anything like tricks that she does. She is not a prostitute! I know
all about that! She was just bored because it was late at night (she lives
in Santa Monica!) and she had no one to talk to. I could be very special
for Tiffany! 

In chapter 4 she says I was very special, truly! I am so happy to have
read this! I will go and thank her!

This is a wonderful book and everyone should read it! It is written in a
simple style but has a lot of things to think about. I find it very deep,
especially the chapter where her dog dies, and her little sayings like
"home is where the heart is" and "life is beautiful when you make it that
way." I will remember these forever.

I could tell you so much more! I really loved this book and it has meant a
lot to me. It reminds me of Edna St. Millay because they are both young
women and love the great outdoors. My next report will be on Edna St. Mil-
lay and I can't wait! 

In conclusion, Tiffany's "Perturbations of a Life-Style Yet Unfounded" is
a modern masterpiece. It has something to say to anyone who will read it.
It is very exciting, especially the part about the murders. I couldn't put
it down! I wish the book never ended, but the conclusion, about the world
of fashion, was just so wonderful! I feel I have learned a lot!

Post-Colonial


I'm known as a "big man" and my chest swells when I hear it. My muscles
are hard as a rock, not like that sissy Houdini who couldn't take a blow
to the stomach because he wasn't watching. (MY MUSCLES RIPPLE.) Of course
you're ALWAYS watching if you're a man; sissy-boys don't watch because
they've got other things to do. I ALWAYS watch; IRON is my middle name. My
thighs could crack your head. I've seen danger, seen things you wouldn't
believe; I don't want to scare you with TALES ABOUT THE NATIVES, but I
tell you, THEY'RE ANIMALS. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be here. As
someone said, YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHO'S COMING OVER THE HILL. The world's
going to be like that; YOU KNOW WHO'S REPRODUCING. 

Better let them TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, I always say. They haven't got a
chance in hell. Why, did you hear ONE OF THEM READ THE BIBLE UPSIDE-DOWN.
Might as well been standing on HER HEAD. IT would have looked better THAT
WAY. I'd like to beat the crap out of them.

They get me MAD MAD MAD. They have all sorts of noise-making stuff like
DRUMS. My CHEST scares the HELL OUT OF THEM.

Their women are beautiful and brainless. THEY LOVE ME. I could crack their
necks just like that. I wouldn't think twice about it. My breasts are like
IRON. There's a SAYING MY MUSCLES HAVE MUSCLES. The women like to feel
them. I can't KEEP THEM AWAY FROM ME.

Sometimes I wander in their villages. THEY NEVER KNOW I'M THERE. I'm RAM-
ROD straight like a roofpole. THE ACT OF BEING INVISIBLE IS BEING FULLY
OBVIOUS. NO ONE HAS EVER ACCUSED ME. I ALWAYS SHAVE.

I have no ILL INTENT and bear no GRUDGES. I have enough on my MIND. THESE
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED A LONG TIME AGO IF IT WASN'T FOR ME. I'm
their PROTECTOR.

YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. The world's full of lurkers. MY BODY IS
THE COLOR OF PERFECT BRONZE. I KNOW HOW TO STAND UP AGAINST ANYONE. You
should see MY ARMS RIPPLE.

Never forget it.

The deadness of beauty's slope-gender, and the death of slope-pronoun
process (program output sample):

Hi? What's your name?
beauty

Well, beauty, let's get started! Let's make a gender!!
That ok with you?
yes

Oh well, let's get going!


What do you want to call this thing you're making?
slope

Well, slope already constructs trouble for us, subverting the categories
we take for granted. Beneath the surface, slope is 27982, neutral, yes?
But what is neutrality here, its constitution?

What pronoun has existed for 235688 hours?
slope - and you knew that all along!

Wait! slope and 27982 are gone forever!

For 3 days, I have already been in mourning...

Lineaments of Desire


The construct/gender program has become increasingly complex. Each line or
line-pair below represents a test-case. Because I concentrate on the code,
the actual entries become a matter of preconscious or autonomic writing. 
The result is an odd self-portrait or production, more accurate than any-
thing I could deliberately produce. So indeed a different gender is con-
structed, one _across_ the entries, a matter of interpenetration or trans-
gression. The output is from the last three days and has a beauty all its
own.

Jennifer writes this; she adds nothing to my security. She is thinking
about space and about tragedy.
She decides that length has no absolute meaning in kyberspace.
That leaves topology. She decides there are bendings and gatherings and
loosenings and disappearances but pretty much multiply-connected graphs.
She says people don't realize how _exact_ everything is here, because
their emotions are in turmoil. 
She says the _exactness_ is critical, turning everyday life inside-out or
upside-down.
Tragedy is always a flaw that floods and flows, and there's usually a
deed, she reassured herself. She'd read Aristotle and beyond.
She was writing this in an editor, knowing the system clock was just a
keystroke or two away. That the time would always be there for her. 
Then there were the programs, email, voices coming in out of the dark.
She felt like a spy who came in from the cold, because the cold was exact. 
She looked at her hand for a long time. She looked again and again.

Song of the Stromatolite

It's early in the morning and I hum my darling sun
It's been how many years now, other than that I don't
Have much of anything to say, there's nothing new 
Under you, a fine day and the rock's giving way
To quiet heat, after three and a half billion years,
It's not worth wondering who these people are, and
After two billion or so there's a glow in the sky,
I don't have to go, bye the bye, a fish swam in
And out, must be oh, ten of them, I'll talk more
Maybe tomorrow, couple of kids down the beach, 
Other things coming I haven't got a name for just
Yet, this life of perfect surplus and surmising,
Call me naive, but I'm just about as old as you,
Maybe a younger sibling or something.

Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes


I got up one morning and got hit by a van. My friend Jacques Lacan would
have been my friend if I had read this in Alan's text. But he married the
wife of Bataille who all the males says is totally dismissable. What a
wreck; I was the only man in France who didn't sleep with Anais Nin, but
Guattari was always waiting for me. He was so jealous of Deleuze, you
wouldn't believe it. You ask about Sartre? Who the fuck thinks about
Sartre? We're all jealous, he was so famous. Leduc followed his beaver
everywhere. Who the hell gave her that nickname, well, it must have been
Merleau-Ponty, no one else would have dared.

Last time I lit a pipe, it rained. All these chicks; if I were straight,
I'd head for Kristeva personally, a good-looker if there ever was one. 
That stuff about the body turns me on. Irigaray too - just think of her 
in slacks! Amazing! Can't get enough of it, heh! Talk about the SAME or
the DIFFERENCE or whatever - it's whatever works, you know. That's the
punctum! 

Now, you really do have to know how to dress. Sartre was too much like
Sondheim, beatle-eyed, there wasn't a bone to him that wasn't soft, if 
you know what I mean. The beaver wrecked him, that's for sure. He was
world-boggling, I used to say, Sartre, you're a world-boggler. We spent
some time kicking Sollers down the stairs, but then he got his hot little 
hands on Kristeva and Sartre walked around half-cocked and jealous, what
the hell.

I got to tell you about "differance." Derrida got a hell of a lot of
mileage out of that. You change a letter and bang, you're in! I couldn't
believe it. We used to laugh and laugh until that Lyotard (get the name,
just like underclothes!) came along and turned it into the "differend" or
whatever. That's what's happened to theory - change a letter, write a
book!

Or like Foucault, just say the author's dead or doesn't exist or some-
thing. Take the obvious and fuck it up a bit. Works every time. You think
there's a "self" of some sort? Heh, there isn't! Big contract for you!
Thom got a lot of stuff out of catastrophe theory. What the hell's a
catastrophe? Big mistake, lots of francs! You can even write about it
like, Debray or Baudrillard. Attack them all! Describe the whole soup and
noodle of it! More francs. They buy it up big!

I'm going to have my word even if I have to get run over by a van for it.
It's going to be _diferents._ It's got that air about it, like deferred
rents, something about owing capital, the political economy of cultural
debtedness, say when someone designs a web page for you, using pre-coded
CGI-bin stuff! Your culture comes from packages, similar/different, de-
ferred - like any debt, someone's got to collect! So think about the Web
as a debtors' culture, carved out from a confluence of capitals. See what
I mean? 

If you don't, I'm going to get run over by a van for it. That's what hap-
pened I think to Althusser - God, did his mind go, along with his wife! So
much for Stalin - it amazes me theorists are just as much believers as
anyone else. You'd think they'd know better, but then why should they?
Change a vowel, make a million! Heh, I had my fill; you should have seen
me and Raymond Queneau together - he had style, styles, actually, thou-
sands of them! If you'd read his works, you'd know what I mean!

I tell you, if it wasn't for Alan Sondheim, theory wouldn't exist! He sure
keeps us on our toes! We can't get away with a thing when we're around
him! It's amazing; I never saw anything like it. He's so brilliant, I'm
just lost in admiration! The other day I was saying to Mike de Certeau,
Cert, have you read that guy? What guy, he said, he was thinking how cute
Braudel was with all those great books of his remaindered at the Strand! 
Sondheim, I said, and he replied, oh, the musical?! No, I said, the phil-
osopher!!! I've got to read him, said Cert, God, I hardly have time for my
own work, since I was run over by a van. It's really sad - I just got back
from Levinas - he's hardly awake any more, all that stuff about insomnia.

It's the melatonin, I said, Sondheim gave it to him, and it changed his
outlook completely!

I am not in Perth.
I have never been in Perth. 
No one awaits me in Perth.

She has never arrived in Perth.
She has never been awaited.
She has never been to Perth.
She is not in Perth.

He has never departed Perth.
He has never been awaited.
He has never been in Perth.
He is not in Perth.

You, who are in Perth, do not await me.
You, who have been to Perth, do not await her.
You, who have been in Perth, do not await him.

Rousseau, Emile


One morning when they had not seen each other for two whole days, I en-
tered Emile's room with a letter in my hands, and looking fixedly at him,
I said to him, "What would you do if some one told you Sophy were dead?"
He uttered a loud cry, got up and struck his hands together, and without
saying a single word, he looked at me with eyes of desperation. "Answer
me," I continued with the same calmness. Vexed at my composure, he then
approached me with eyes blazing with anger; and checking himself in an
almost threatening attitude, "What would I do? I know not; but this I do
know; I would never set eyes again upon the person who brought me such
news." "Comfort yourself," said I, smiling, "she lives, she is well, and
they are expecting us this evening. But let us go for a short walk and we
can talk things over."

-----------------------------------------

So Rousseau writes this. He gets up with Emile; they go to the computer.
Dear Sophy, they begin, maybe we're dead, maybe you are. Who is to know?
Emile had quite a scare. If I were Raymond Queneau I'd wonder about this.
Emile's only words. So am I for that matter. Who am I writing to? Doesn't
this seem like the oldest story in the world? There's always control in-
volved in a story. That's the masochism everyone talks about. I have no
idea if it has a site, sight, or locus. It's more like a locust, plague
take you everywhere, emitted from the Grund up. You rise, you sink; you
understand. She dies, isn't dead; they're all dead anyway - it's too long
ago. Because I'm a woman, because I'm a woman, they wouldn't like me. I'm
being called to the table. I just wonder and wonder. Who were they? Why
the control? Rousseau buried women in his time. He set the example and
made examples. He reminds me of Hippocrates, Galen. Women are a symptom.
But here, something else is happening. He bursts in the room; he's a
ghost! It's a slow take. They're on the computer; one or another has the
power to delete. They wryte Sophy into just about everything they do.
She's the protocol. She has seven layers, only three of skin. Down there,
the hardware. Beneath the pinafore.

She raises it again and again.
