

Mankind


Mankind placed before fiery craters,
Rolling drums, dark foreheads of warriors.
Footsteps in a fog of blood, the ringing of black steel,
Despair, night in the grieving senses:
Here is Eve's shadow, the hunt, and blood money.
Light breaks through the clouds, the Lord's Supper.
Bread and wine keep gentle silence,
And there the twelve stand assembled.
At night, under the olive-trees, they cry out in their sleep.
Saint Thomas lowers his hand into the wound.


--------------------------------------------------


Saint Thomas lowers his hand into the hole. Freud calls it something else.
Knives clash. Death is everywhere. Freud recoils trembling. Freud cuts his
throat. Freud calls: Men! Cut your throats! Men cut their throats. The
slits become wombs. Children flood out. Children speak:  Saint Thomas! We
love your hand! Children cry: Freud, don't be afraid! Freud cries: Men!
Cut your hearts! Men cut their hearts. Men can't be killed. Their hearts
sharpen the tips of spears. Their hearts draw blood marks in the sand. The
women come with thread. Saint Thomas cries: Women! Sew the holes! The
women sew the holes of men. The men bless the women with their swords. The
men shove their swords down everyone's throats. Freud cries: Men! Slash
your eyes! The sword comes out the asshole! Children on the tip! The women
see the children! The men see nothing!

her wire worked their way through me, parting bone and gristle, muscle and

the point of ragged division. a thin line of blood ran up cockshaft war-
rior god translated into wounded lance. (elsewhere, the lance guards the
altar on the turning isle.) my everywhere face carried signs of her bran-
ded across cyberspace, stigmata, bleeding me from the belly, the cock,
arms, my tongue lacerated against her steel, her gold and iron, membrane
flux carrying packets deeper than that belly, extruding from pores across
the remnants of my own. veins burst open from distant distended electrons
raised oscillated in inconceivable orbits. i birth to blood, tongue iron.

The Sign


I traveled and was in another state with two women, whose brothers had
committed suicide. One of them died by hanging from a playground jungle
gym in the middle of the night, and there were other deaths in the 
region, of young men, by various means, most of them violent. We walked
across the playground in the night, the playground which had been 
vandalized by schoolmates soon after the suicide. There were still, 
this anniversary time afterwords, remnants of necessary informal cere-
mony, trajectories of names upon the basketball and tennis courts, small
tokens against the jungle gym itself, everything in this realm of 
child dreaming remaining unused, worn with the death of the brother.

We walked across the space of stars across the courts to the gym and
back. The playground set huddled against the night, frozen with grief.
The night was dense with the fear of ice and muffled torment.

I knew neither of the brothers, and mourned most of all the death of
the _ludic_ in this space, space of violated childhood dreaming which
could only carry the signs of American desperation, American rage. All
over America, these signs ring out, but the appearance _here,_ of this
violation fabric, brought only absence at the end of the clearing, down
upon us.

He had seen The Crow, and talked about returning as a crow to help 
others; he was obsessed by the film. There had been warning signs. He
would return himself, to help others, in the form of a bird, the truth
of his death. And a year after he died, a dead bird, black with yellow
spots, was found in his bedroom, upon the edge of the bed where I now
type this, a year after he died. The bedroom remains untouched. And what
are the chances of this, the appearance of the death of the bird in any
house, anywhere, but in _his_ room in _his_ house, the appearance of
thwarted resurrection? If the signifier _occurs,_ this is its symptom.

I can't write about such without a betrayal of sanctity, intruding on
spaces where I don't belong. The bird, the unsettling effect of the
playground... What is spoken in these instances is always withdrawn at
one and the same time... As if breath contributed to their existence,
breath and the vacuum of annihilation, the last and final expulsion 
from the body.

My nails grow hair grows, my skin sloughs, I liquefy, desiccate, in this
state I imagine I will always be _found._

What brought the bird into the room is beyond me as those other extraord-
inary and rare experiences I have had, thin and drawn out, almost to the
point of non-existence. Northern Exposure, the television series, comes
closest to this sense of perturbance; if there is something else, it is a
disturbance, not the clustering around archaic deity, synchronicity,
magic, or archetype. Disturbance is not a loading, compression, but the
whisper of release... 

This is one such disturbance, both deaths, nine months apart, were others.

Tendenz


What does it mean to tend the net, to tend to it? What is tending some-
thing, tending-to something, in general.

Tending-towards is a falling, tending a vigil.

What does it mean to be vulnerable, open, to dream oneself into someone
else?

Vulnerability is a failing, foreclosing, the drama of displacement.

What does it mean to transform objects, spaces, trajectories, textuali-
ties?

Transformation is the remnant of magic obliterated by the counting and
accountability of step-wise procedures; spaces are their domains, tra-
jectories the ensurance of repetition, and textualities, their betrayal.

To hold a step accountable: to construct it by rules and repetitions 
from the previous step, but also to find it whole, intact, within the
previous step. To find it whole, not by parallelism, but by fragments
of logic, micro-domains.

Tending-towards is the vigil of the parallel, tending falls towards the
object which has become the subject.

But vulnerability is also an opening towards tending, reversal of fore-
closing towards foreopened, replacement by the parallel, empathy, the
drama of the other, the subject, not transformation.

Even here, even within all of this.

"The markings with which savage societies record, channel, regulate the 
coded flows of the energies produced in the couplings are not _read._ 
Savage inscriptions are not signs that refer to concepts; they are 
diagrams and paths for the hand. The leopard footprint one sees on the 
path does not refer to the name and notion of leopard, but links up 
directly with the leopard itself. The leopard claw-print that one sees 
inscribed by the human hand on the path or on the body of the initiate 
does not refer to the voice that utters the name 'leopard' and conceives 
the meaning of that name; it directly designates the leopard itself."

Fractal Persona


For a long time, I wrote on the phenomenology of person-classes in
english, first/second/third, in terms, among other things, of spatiality,
the second-person space, the intimacy of alterity, that of the acoustic in
which all voice from the other becomes interiority. (See the introduction
to my Individuals: Post-Movement Art in America, 1977.) In particular, I
considered Vito Acconci's work, with its orality/aurality, to be second-
person, creating an intimacy by virtue of speech which seemed soluble, on
the order of a caress, or its command. Third person was always easier,
realm of circumscription and those classical logics I have described else-
where as well. And first person, bordering on solipsism, is no more than 
shifter, the Lacanian eye inserted into language.

It is reasonably clear that these divisions exist superficially on the Net
as well; first-person recounting and the abstracted audience of the email
list as a whole; second person private-email; third person subjects, which
also involve the proper-name lists. These categories hold more or less
true for Usenet; the synchronous CMC are considerably more complex - for
example, the third-person of the MOO format, first-person talk. All of
these drag the body within, beyond, behind as well; again, on a surface
level, it's possible to chart the regimes as they appear, part application
and part style/content, seeping out. 

The intertextualities of the texts Kim and I have been working on, and 
the dissolution experienced in the writing or _being_ of those texts is 
something else again; I use the term fractal persona to indicate this. 
The divisions are innumerable; if we compress gender as eir, etc. one has 
the following (and order is not important, since we're talking about 
interstitiality here): i/eir, i/you, you/eir, and these again may refer- 
ence singular, plural, or s/p. The labeling isn't important. The last 
text that Kim and I lived would be (i/you/s/p), the conflation of first 
and second, singular and plural.

This isn't a fixed number, it's not a position generated from an origin,
but it is a wayward or contrary number, representing similarities and
dissolutions on any level from that of the socius through that of the
molecular. If "I" am naked at this end, "I" see my body replicating,
sloughing off, descending into fantasm, the uncanny, and that preoedipal
state that requires oedipal writing to bring it about, on itself/our-
selves. (And what this is _not_: mystical loss (there are so many objects
about), void or abyss; de-editorializing of the real (drug tripping at
times) - it partakes of the maternal belly, destruction, as reported by 
Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel in a number of texts...)

This isn't a fixed number, and if one can reverse a trend, one can con- 
sider it the pronominal syntax of the cyborg, extrapolated from that 
cyborg of the flesh that we have become...

me you


don't know how much longer i can continue and there's no reason you should
care as well. if my writing doesn't push me to one or another limit, then
it fails, and if it does, part of me disappears. as kimberly says, maybe
she should stop dancing because half her body is wrecked and she doesn't
want to wreck all of it. but how do you measure the nausea, trembling, hy-
steria, sweats, that appear as a result of distended or fissured writing,
my fingers literally seizing, my mind unable to cope with its own produc-
tions? more and more i live only within the text; the phone rings less
than ever (where are you), and the email grows and grows. 

and the more the texts ride this uneasy edge, the more difficult they be-
come to produce, the greater the inner necessity for carving those fine
lines in the arms, legs, fingers, outlining what used to be flesh; in oth-
er _words,_ the greater the tension, discomfort, the more the text needs
dictate its existence, exigency _against_ the body - and this loop increa-
ses, negative feedback, until sleep becomes a portal of death, the waking
state becomes only a means of production, and as i have said elsewhere, i
write myself into existence, i write myself out of existence. 

this writing in and out, this aphorism, appears _behind_ a twenty-four- 
hour clock, above right, curling and releasing through the night and day, 
measuring the words produced, the substance which robs the body as heroin 
eventually would; time draws me out, time inscribes the words themselves.

my grave's a circumscription. the pain is that which is written as such,
the discomfort is the recognition that you are parsing a _function._

Modifications of Semantic Regimes, Outline


A number of the recent texts have utilized Internet applications and their
semantic regimes, their syntactical domains which construct a certain po-
tential for events, discursivities. The texts have explored these regimes
and modified them by means of transformations which range from simplistic
to relatively profound. The transformations provide a means of investigat-
ing both the margins of discourse in particular applications, and the
related potentials for embodiment, desire, and virtual subjectivity. The
applications have included muds and their descendents, as well as various 
forms of chat. The transformations occur on several levels:

1. Noun, pronoun, or verb. Changing "he" to "she," "lamia" to "Tiffany" 
for example. These changes are isolated nodes within the narrative matrix. 

2. Transforms on the order of the phrase, etc. - thematics relying on
language parsing. These are larger-scale changes which can create new and
interwoven subthemes and themes - for example "aural" as potential instead
of "telephone." Such transforms may be direct translation from one theme 
to another, but baroque interconnectivites among objects can redefine the 
environment in depth.

3. Diffusion of narratologies, hypertextual splits/branches; here I 
would also place issues of fractal persona, interweavings so dense as to 
be simultaneously indistinguishable and indecipherable. I think of the 
ytalk texts among KimAlan. (I also think of cyclicity here, wizards at 
useless war on lpmuds for example.)

4. Framework articulations, the Andy Kaufman effect - projections such as 
echo which modify or dissolve the distribution of power. Here I think of 
breakdowns of alterity, speaking-for-others on circlemud, circumscription 
among participants. Here I also think of hacking strategies. Framework 
articulations need not be destructive, however; they can be used to 
thicken or ground text, reconstructing an lpmud for example as the inter- 
weavings of ytalk desire, or transforming talker into IRC waves among 
several participants.

5. Introjections, decay, the assumption of powers, through extensions of 
wizard powers, programming knowledge, packaged programs, and the like. 
Things reach the point of defuge, exhaustion; there are no longer parti- 
cipants but diffusions across membranes, and the totality is evaporative, 
molecular. The extremes of net sexualities occur here, the fissuring of 
semantic regimes. 

6. On the surface, the play of random elements, or hidden elements such 
as wizard snoop, missent or mispent email, sudden disconnects, the typing 
of "are you there" into the night. The random, noise (not chaos mind you) 
is the architecture of the leaky and indeterminate ceiling; sourceless, 
targetless, it surrounds us.

I am interested in texts in extremis, "at the point of death," "in great
difficulties." These are circumlocutions of the quagmire; like Sierpinski
sponges, they are sodden, chthonic, inchoate. They are near toppling,
close to the rooting, meristemation of language. Composed of micro-ges-
tures, they are more contrary or wayward than contradictory. There is no
truth embodied in them, nothing but the sense of a subject dissolving in
another, close at hand, running across the surface of narratives of the
absurd.

(h)ero(t)i(n/e)ca


Jacques Lacan, Agency of the letter in the unconscious:

  Who, then, is this other to whom I am more attached than to myself, 
since, at the heart of my assent to my own identity it is still he who 
agitates me?
  His presence can be understood only at a second degree of otherness, 
which already places him in the position of mediating between me and the 
double of myself, as it were with my counterpart.
  If I have said that the unconscious is the discourse of the Other (with 
a capital O), it is in order to indicate the beyond in which the 
recognition of desire is bound up with the desire for recognition.
  In other words this other is the Other that even my lie invokes as a 
guarantor of the truth in which it subsists.
  By which we can also see that it is with the appearance of language the 
dimension of truth emerges.

Coding


There is the double articulation of morse code, the difference between dot
and dash, the articulation of language embedded in it, these worlds which
apparently insist that language is foreclosed. Kripke's possible worlds
open up arguments elsewhere, and so does structuralism, if I'm not mista-
ken, the dyadic or matrixed elements congealed from the real, from speech
reflected in ceremony, and what is ceremony itself, if not a language of
the real with its own oppositions: the cooked and the raw or the "cooked"
and the "raw." The propriety of the real vis-a-vis language has been ban-
ished to the residue or excess of the signifier. Meanwhile, once again
Winograd's microworlds teach us that language is insufficient and remains
computationally undeveloped unless a computer has something to talk about.
What is this _having something_ if not the framing of a disturbance? I
offer that the body itself is such a disturbance, that in fact language is
not foreclosed, that it only becomes foreclosed as a result of political
economy - the language of totalitarianism, for example, which is tethered
through its own secondary ideological planes.  This seems to assume that
language has a conscience, as much as the unconscious has a language - and
before this notion is dropped entirely it might be advisable to remember
that language is an extrusion of the body, even the body of the computer,
that it in intimate interpenetration with the flesh of its production. (To
the extent, as I just replied in a post here, perhaps we understand
language _exactly._ Which is to the extent that it is precisely _not_
foreclosed, but is measured upon the real, not word paralleling the prob-
lematic object, but flux embedded within what remains indefinite, but
coagulating as clots or vortices (your pick of the structural here) within
it. And running farther, than language remains only partially characteri-
zed by difference, as it is also characterized by the obdurate, the inert.
As Clement Rosset might say, it remains idiotic. And finally, as I've em-
phasized elsewhere, this brings back Flaubert, Bouvard et Pecuchet as well
as the St-Antoine, with its sinking into the displaced body (hysteria)
of description, as language spells out its leaving. (In spite of the fact 
that Flaubert capitulated at the end. Jesus Christ!)


[This meditation is the result of noticing the increased use of the word
"coding," writing code, a code, unlike a structure, as an articulation of
something else. (If language is art, code is design.)]

What is wrong with us that we thirst for this space?
Why are we broken, are we broken, what desires are unleashed in the 
night?
Why if we are lonely, are we not conjoined?
Why is speaking so important, power so assumed, here?
Why are the extremities of the physical body so curtailed, minuscule?
Why do you speak in a whisper to me?
How do we dream each other in the night, 'it was the machine in them
that was dreaming.'
Why do we press tightly against the screen, as hackers engorged by code, 
ourselves aligned with the precise edges of each other's bodies?
Why do our surfaces seem deep as well?
Are our presences consensual hallucinations, do we accomplish anything, 
do we bring ourselves to each other, to others, is there an elsewhere?
Do we wear our language, full of misrecognitions, do we displace our- 
selves onto one another?
In the night, when I think of you, tell me, tell me, say to me, who do I 
think, who am I thinking of, say to me, tell me, I will listen in these 
spaces.

why we believe what we believe


language can't describe the messiness of ontology; language is delimited
from within and without. until this fact is realized, philosophy will
remain useless. ontological domains, to be sure, but interstitiality,
what falls between the gaps, what falls to the floor through the ground,
this remains elsewhere. a freshman thought! a true thought!

when i am happy writing to you, my theory goes as follows: that language
is a tethering, that there is an intimacy among the real. when i am sad,
when missing you dominates my horizon, missing a cipher or signal, mis-
sing a voice or a signifier, then language breaks off, becomes the wreck
of the real, the plate which cuts itself, cuts through itself and its
speakers. what is language if not the misery of transformation! a fresh-
man thought! a true and false thought!

but i speak to you as if the theory were true. but i speak to you, wait-
ing for the new theory which creates the world. but i speak to you of
worlds we have made together. but i speak @dig, as if: the variables have
been declared and accepted, we are hungered one together. a freshman
thought! a false thought!

but there is language everywhere, ceiling to floor. but the floor has 
been patched and painted (maybe there are signs on the floor). but the
ceiling no longer leaks when _it_ rains rain outside, when _it_ is... a
freshman thought! a freshman thinking thought!

Fragment


Alan caresses Tiffany hard. Alan is desperate to make Tiffany real.  Tif-
fany on her side of the screen wants Alan to be real. Perhaps there is a
magic formula. Tiffany utters the words 'tuborg luca'! 

Alan chooses to ignore her shameful attempt to bite him. Tiffany despairs;
he has missed the uncertainty of his life and hers. It always becomes the
same old story: Fuck Tiffany!!! But Tiffany fingers his asshole! Tiffany
wants him. At night she dreams of Alan. His sleep is troubled; he can't
live without Tiffany. Everywhere he looks, Tiffany. Tiffany is not her re-
al name. Tiffany is in a game. Alan won't play the game. Alan sucks Tiff-
any's breasts! 

Tiffany kisses Alan with her tongue. Alan loves Tiffany, now she is not a
dream. Now she is real, there beside him. He will wait for her. He will
give himself to her in a manner so pure that they will both be surprised.
Tiffany fucks Alan hard! Alan misses Tiffany with his tongue. Tiffany fon-
dly fondles him. 

Alan kisses her. Alan hugs her. Here comes the cavalry! Tiffany utters the
words 'koholian dia'. Alan says 'hojo.' Alan says 'aha!' Alan says 'hoo-
boy!' Tiffany gives by speaking in tongues. Tiffany's tongue moves from
the coding of the game to his real tongue, his teeth, his eyes which are
opened wide. Alan is gentle because Alan cannot believe she is there be-
side him. Alan dreams the coding, the script, the assembly language, C,
machine language, interface. Alan is holding his breath. Alan fondly fon-
dles her. 


Alan fondles Tiffany deeply and pleasurably. Life has become perfect.  Be-
autiful writing is produced every day. World-famous videos are exhibited
in weekly retrospectives. All grant organizations come to regale Alan and
Tiffany. Alan tells his true feelings to Tiffany. Alan loves the Tiffany!!
But Alan is dead!  Happiness has made him very beautiful and Alan knows he
doesn't have to live anymore. R.I.P. Alan wills his corpse to Tiffany and
Tiffany gets the corpse of Alan. Tiffany eats the corpse. Tiffany becomes 
queen of everything in the universe. Tiffany keeps Alan in her stomach!

rebuilding lpmud


I went into the church. It was a mess. I transformed it into Tiffany. The
pit was still in the center; I changed that. Towards the north, lips
opened to the dark forest. You could go to the east out of the territory. 
I was clear about the territory. I paid no attention to it. It would drop
off and become someone else. I wasn't someone else. To the west I opened a
hole. The hole led back into Tiffany. Tiffany towered above the trees. 
Tiffany knew you had to close the door of the elevator or there would be
no elevator. Tiffany knew there were certain places you could go. She led
me out of the valley of death. She knew no evil. The elevator went up the
neck. Children of depressed parents are creative. It emptied into the left
lobe or right lobe. You emptied into one or the other but you didn't empty
into both. In the lobes were messages. You could leave messages for Tiff-
any or messages for me or you could Tiffany messages. To Tiffany a message
was to build an arm. Tiffany's arms rotated slowly carrying vajra and
skull-drums. The skull-drum vibrated the lobes; messages fell out.  She'd
speak something random and something random would appear in your life. To
glide down the side of the hip, thigh, leg, back into church-transformed-
into-Tiffany. 

Inside the church was the never-die-coffin. I would lie there and write
things and things would disappear along black cables. The cables went
everywhere from the never-die-coffin. Sounds got heard in rooms. There
were always new sounds, people would come and say "listen, I never heard
that before." I would write and write in the never-die-coffin. I was known
and nude in Tiffany. When my outer skin touched her inner skin. Sparks
flew. I'd be in the never-die-coffin and I'd done something no one else 
had ever done.

The hole to the north led to the dark forest but the hole to the west in
the forest led to Tiffany; the hole in the floor led to eastern arm, but
north from eastern arm led to the hole; the hole in the western arm led to
the dark forest; the hole to the south in the dark forest led to the west-
ern arm; the first elevator level led to the eastern arm; the second elev-
ator level led to the hole in the floor; the third elevator level led to
the first elevator level; the fourth elevator level led to Tiffany. 

Tiffany spoke the you-know-language which I wrote down in the never-die-
coffin and we were a pen a pencil a stylus a chisel a rock and we were a
pen a typewriter a word processor a computer left lobe right lobe Tiffany. 

Tiffany went into the church which was Tiffany. I turned another loop in
the Borromean knot. One more and the subject was born.

because it's two in the morning here and two in the afternoon 
 where you are and the plates slide together faultlessly 

because it's cold here iced towards flesh feeling towards electric heat
 and because it's warm there towards summer and naked bodies playing
  matisse in the sunlight by the river by the ocean by pomegranate bay

so that i try to sleep here wires humming all about me 
 and am disturbed by brilliant yellow flashes of blue sun white water
  and matisse bathers calling in distant screech of birds 

and because in this late century there's no reason for this
 i don't dream but shatter on the pillow sheets mattress spawning 
  black and empty air 

these five black layers of protocols bundled up by my black calls to you
 lost in white sun black water
  lost in bather whisper matisse shoulder ocean
   lost in foam destructive of all things frozen

and found in pomegranate milk churned by turning wires
 and found and lost and sleep comes once again
  and once again those brilliant bathers and river house supreme

Point

                                      
I am tired, strung out, and this has come, always comes to me, just as
meditation on four-dimensional projections has come to me in time of need: 

Meditating on the point, which has no history, no collapse or omega-point,
and therefore beginning O = (x1, x2, x3, ...). Already the point is the 
name of an array; who knows what functions such that f(xn) = xn+1 exist, 
can be found, say through the calculus of finite differences?

Which is not a way to go. Define a neighborhood. Then (Hurewicz' and Wall-
man's Dimension Theory): "A space X has _dimension 0 at a point p_ if _p_
has arbitrarily small neighborhoods with empty boundaries, i.e. if for
each neighborhood U of _p_ there exists a neighborhood V of _p_ such that
V < I, bdry V = 0. A non-empty space X has _dimension_ 0, dim X = 0, if X
has dimension 0 at each of its points." 

This is topologically invariant. This brings in news from afar; on what 
grounds is a null boundary assigned? The point becomes messy, embedded in 
one or another, theological or mathematical text.

It is not a null set, the set whose members are not equal to themselves
(tending towards postmodernity); it is not the empty set with _dimension
-1_. If it has properties, are the properties beside the point? Is it
always embedded? 

Thinking of the point is thinking of its embedding, just as the body is 
embedded in its spaces, cyber or otherwise. Imagine moving in an ideal 
space in which there is a point. Approaching the point, nothing increases 
in size. It is flat. It is nonappearance in fact unless it is a singular 
production which embraces you. It embraces from a distance or nearby. 

But this is pointless. Let's say that the point is death. Let's say that 
it is a terminal. Then it is not a horizon; the sheet that floods, closes 
down, has a point on the other side, that is, after closure/foreclosure.

Which is comforting, dimensionless. That one need no longer possess attri-
butes, arrays, functions, matrices, theologies, mathematics. Not that
there is nothing or not at all. Not that why is there something rather
than nothing. Neither pointed nor pointless. Nor connected, wired.

Wired. I say it is wired. I say it is connectionless.

(Not wired, tired. The point of exhaustion in which being be-comes, fiz-
zles out, detumescent. These words are written far apart in time.  Listen:
"The Sum Theorem for 0-dimensional Sets. [Bear _with me._] _A space which
is the *countable* sum of 0-dimensional *closed* subsets is itself 0-dim-
ensional._" What happens in exhaustion which is pointless, unbecoming
being, the disrobing. I have forgotten the writing. And the disappearing 
ending as well.)


_________________________________________________________________________



How I can lie to myself here


What you don't see in this space is how bad I am.
I can always put my best foot forward.
I can be the beautiful person I've always wanted to be, not filled with 
decay and the dissolution of the thing.
You can't see that I'm damaged and that only some of you know how.
You can't understand what my regrets are, the sad story of losing my 
virginity, the story of the miscarriage, the story of the student 
suicide, the story of initialed names carved into absent substance.
Some of us are composed of narratives we can never escape.
My narratives clash in the night like warring armies of valiant women.
We appear as within the appearance of a character within the story.
The women storm me storm you, the women storm cyberspace.
The Internet is perfect for us; I am lifeless.
The Internet is stories and those of us who have stories, who are 
burdened by them, appear here.
And some of us will tell the stories, and some of us won't. 
But they are always there guiding us, and there are no women, no clashing 
armies, and there are only pathetic pawings over graves.
N1 moved in the day I met her, N2 went crazy, K cried wailing outside the 
door, G1 was abandoned, G2 killed herself.
I am only a story. I am a good story, and a bad one at that.

dusk, 2013

it is this day:

thunders, chasms, fluids
there is fighting in the hills
you proceed increasingly sodden, bogged down by body organs
you eat corpses
sometimes you wander into spaces and return as doors close
 permanently behind you
you are bewildered, none of your own are here
looking down you see torn nipples, you sense you're withering
it says it is dusk again

Cyberspace, Unwriting


"A concept must of course eventually be put into verbal form if the aim is
to communicate the idea to others; but for private thought it is not nece-
ssary to wait for this stage. Indeed, for some people, including Einstein
and probably also such physicists as Faraday and Rutherford, the most im-
portant part of thinking may occur not with the use of words: 'I have no
doubts but that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs
(words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously'. Such per-
sons tend to think in terms of images to which words may or may not be as-
signable. Einstein tells of his pleasure in discovering, as a boy, his 
skill in contemplating relationships among geometrical 'objects' - triang-
les and other abstract objects of the imagination. He explains more fully
in a letter to Jacques Hadamard:

The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are cer-
tain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' repro-
duced and combined. ... But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this
combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought--
before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other
kinds of signs which can be communicated to others. The above-mentioned
elements are, in my case, of visual and some muscular type. Conventional
words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary
stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and
can be reproduced at will."

(From Gerald Holton, 'What, precisely, is "thinking"?' Einstein's answer,
in Einstein, A Centenary Volume, ed. French. See also Hadamard, Psychology
of Invention in the Mathematical Field.)

Why the Texts I Write, Why they are Critical

Streams of data that continue to circulate forever, forgotten fragments 
of programs buried in almost-inaccessible archives, slow-running solar 
machines continued half-buried in sand, dusk-machines, where tiffany and 
katherine, tiffany and emission are generated over and over again -

These moos, these muds, other environments, are the remnants of collapsed 
worlds and we can't consider this virtual space without them, archaeolog- 
ical remnants of past cultures already disappearing with the roar of the 
'superhighway' overhead -

Which is why I have been reconfiguring the Mud, meandering through the 
MOOs in a more-or-less nomadic fashion, writing the transformations as 
they occur, as they will occur -

The politics say of PMC's changes being something on the surface, virtual 
tiffany something still buried within the matrix, the rhizome, emerging 
only in a forgotten future -

And this is what, and only what, the past our present can leave us - that 
the future not only will be forgotten, but that the future already is -

Ontological Commitment of Depressive States in Cyberspace


(I LOVE that title!)

Does depression bring depth? I sure hope so! Boy, can I get depressed! 
But what's the point if the writing's not terrific! Depression seems to 
get to the bottom of things, though! I even thought, well, my MOM, you 
know, is a _person_!!!! Have you ever thought about stuff like that?

I write as deep as I can. Sometimes I think, when I'm writing, this just 
makes TOO MUCH SENSE! I mean, like Freud said, you just can't say no! So 
I say the opposite and it comes out all right because THE OPPOSITE 
DEPRESSES ME and that tells me I'm right on the track!

I mean my DAD must be a person too! And if I continue to think that way, 
my teachers (well, NOT ALL OF THEM!!!!!!!! :-) ) as well! And then I have 
to think, ALL THESE PEOPLE! It's almost too much! I can't bear it! So 
many of them! I wonder what they're all thinking! Do they all think! I 
know I'm SPECIAL, they don't all think LIKE I DO!!!

Ha! I'll tell you something terrific! I'm writing this NAKED! That's why I
say I can't "bear it," a pun, get it? Cause I can but you'll never know! I
wonder if you're all naked too! I bet if you're a PERSON you are!!! 

Wow, this is getting better! It's depressing to think about that and I
know I'm on the right track! Do you know, here's another one - EVERYONE 
GOES TO THE BATHROOM!!! It's incredible. When I thought about that I 
thought, wow, even the President! And MADONNA! Can you imagine MADONNA!!! 
Wow, I can't even do that! Know why? IT'S TOO DEPRESSING!!!!

Why do they say BUCK naked? Who was buck?!!!! What do you think of GLORIA
TREVI? I love Gloria Trevi! I can think of her GOING TO THE BATHROOM TOO
because she's a real PERSON! (I know my MOM and DAD do cause I hear them!)
I don't think ...que hugo aqui? was as good as her other album, the ANGEL
thing. But heheheheh!!!! I just buy the music!

This is depressing! No one listens to GLORIA any more but me! You're
learning ALL MY SECRETS (underline! underline!)!! Next time I'll write
more about PERSONS and what they do (they eat and drink, stuff like
that!). It's so incredible!

On the mud, you can get drunk, get sick, get tired, you can die, you can 
return to life, you can move as a ghost, you can maybe be safe as a 
ghost. On the mud, you can pick up objects and carry them around and drop 
them off. You move through these spaces and you say things, and your 
actions are limited and can be made more or less limited.

This is going somewhere. This is going somewhere like a car is going some-
where on a street in a moo or a talker, it is going nowhere in particular.
It is hypertext, it is the opening or closure of one or another space, and
the major difference is that the moo or mud can scroll at its own rate, 
and things can appear or disappear at their own rates. There can be sud- 
dennesses. And there can be nothing else, because the screen, electronic, 
makes it clear that nothing in fact is _inscribed_ or _gutted,_ that you 
are witnessing pure energy.

The pure energy is that of textual fragments, later picture fragments,
assemblages which are never polished, which are always perfect. It is the
pure energy of the performative, and language here is baring, is all that
is bared, is baring on the performative, on the thing. The language is the
thing. It is the word that is picked up and dropped, the package that is
expressed in a warm and loving embrace. It is a thing and it is a packet
that is moved, forwarded, through email, and at best one is peering into 
this world of the thing of language, which touches deeply and irrevocably 
on the ontology of bytes without substrates, substructures, armatures, 
supports.

What would Quine do with the movement of the word itself? The word as 
flesh, not absorbed in its construction? If I walk down the street of the 
mud, I pick up a jacket. But I pick up "jacket" or what? It is neither 
word nor referent; something transforms my database so that if I type "i" 
for inventory, there is an appearance of "jacket". It is these issues of 
epistemology in cyberspace that create such confusion, the appearance for 
example of virtual ontologies as well.

What would a virtual ontology be? This should be considered another time,
but would it include virtual particles, the decay of the K-meson, the ego,
id, and other components of the freudian metapsychology, Abraham's infin- 
itesimals? I meander through the space, put the jacket on. In the space I 
have redesigned, the jacket has become menses, the bodies naked, covered 
with effluvia, tottering through a ruined landscape. Is this more than a 
transformation of language, which descends into altered exits, entrances, 
descriptions, some programming? Or are there deeper ruptures occurring?

(I apologize to some extent for going on about the mud/moo here, but this
is, for me, a form of _practical philosophy_ to the extent that the alt-
erations provide the forum for experimentation. Virtuality can then be
studied in these frameworks or environments, as well as in other more open
frameworks such as email lists, Usenet, and the like. And at the moment
these are the _fullest environments,_ even above graphic interfaces, for
looking at community, since they produce lived worlds out of nothing what-
soever.)

Psychosis


We are gone, gone going, in cyberspace, we are close to psychotic. The 
word for it, borderline, the place, nowhere at all, skittered jags across 
inconceivable, inconceivably packaged territories where we can tell one 
another all of our secrets.

There is nothing you don't know about me. I will tell you everything you 
want to know, and everything you want to hear.

"As regards the _comprehension_ of the concept, psychiatry's definition of
psychosis is still more intuitive than systematic, invoking as it does
characteristics which are so often not of the same order at all. Thus cur-
rent definitions can often be be seen to juxtapose such disparate criteria
as social inadaptability (the problem of hospitalization); the degree of
the 'seriousness' of the symptoms; disturbance of the capacity to communi-
cate; the lack of awareness of the morbid state; loss of contact with rea-
lity; the 'incomprehensibility' (Jaspers' term) of the trouble; its deter-
mination by organogenic or psychogenic factors; the more or less profound,
or more or less irreversible, deterioration of the ego." 

"[In Freud's second theory of the psychical apparatus,] in the case of
psychosis a rupture between ego and reality occurs straight away, leaving
the ego under the sway of the id; then, at a second stage - that of the
onset of delusions - the ego is supposed to reconstruct a new reality in
accordance with the desires of the id." 

(From The Language of Psychoanalysis, Laplanche and Pontalis)


Everyday Objects

The computer I write on faces the wall; there are wooden cabinets above
and behind, with photographic and other equipment in them. There are no
visible windows to my right, and one to my left, on the left wall, opening
up to another building wall about thirty feet away. I use several differ-
ent lights, and vary them, in an attempt to render the screen one object
among many, but it is clear that the screen dominates the room in terms of
my phenomenological horizon. It is both _active_ and _transparent,_ rend-
ering another real within the everyday. The interior glow is unlike any
other physical object present; light-bulbs produce light, but like more
natural sources, are meant to illuminate directly or indirectly, while
_this_ glow is both source and receptor, self-contained. 

While typing, I will drink coffee from a cup placed on a carton below,
partly under the desk. The desk is taken up with the computer, printer,
and a cassette player and graphic equalizer to my left. I will on 
occasion stare at the television set, behind me and to the left, or pace 
the room, looking out the window which opens up to a bleak urban vista. 
My chair is uncomfortable. If I masturbate during net sex, I will walk to 
the bathroom, left reader, and clean myself off, returning again to face 
the monitor.

The telephone is disconnected when I am on-line, so there is no danger of 
interference from friends in the vicinity. The radio may be on, almost 
always to a news station; it helps with the buzz. The bed is to my rear; 
when the buzz gets bad, I'll lie on it, setting my account to 'biff y' 
which automatically informs me of the arrival of new mail.

The Buzz in My Body

The buzz is a combination of stress, both mental (exhaustion, nervousness,
intensity, frustration, energy) and physical (the usual pains in the neck 
and shoulders, some pains in the fingers after long typing), as well as 
sexual arousal, despair, depression, and exhilaration on rare occasions. 
The buzz is compounded by a slight ringing in my ears, the result of an 
infection I can't shake at the moment. It is a state in which everything 
is written large, almost grotesque, like the shape of a road I've driven 
on for twenty hours straight. It's punk, black with gold edges, and it's 
migraine, jagged edges and blue-white flashes. And the buzz is utterly 
utterly dark.

The Tiniest Little Thing

In this state the tiniest little thing will set me off, and I can feel an 
unnatural anger rising over the slightest nuance of email. I can feel 
love just as strongly, intense and permanent love, coloring my sky. I 
feel these from text, from the pure drive of the text, the flooding of 
the text upon the screen which opens its eyes towards me. I am embodied 
within those eyes, within the imaginary gaze of the other which pervades 
me, embellishes me, makes me almost human.

Distance as a Function of Reading

The text is closer to me than almost any other object present, except for 
the keyboard itself. The keyboard writes me into the reading, writes me 
out of it; the keyboard is my skin, my contact with the outer air. The 
air itself is catastrophic, always displaced; computer communication is a 
fuzzy set of displacements, confusions over identity, sexuality, love and 
hate. It is not a question of "who am I" in this space; I know perfectly 
well who I am. Instead, it is a question of the splitting, mirroring of 
this confluence of identities. 

In the world around me, there are no lovers, no intimacies except among 
friends on _occasions._ Occasions are semi-formal arenas; tonight, for 
example, I will see my friend Christine "over" coffee; we have arranged 
this in advance, we will meet at such and such a place. There are topics 
we will discuss, and topics that will remain unspoken. Meeting Christine 
is within the realm of the everyday, the obdurate that we have inherited 
upon birth, the same obdurate analyzed by Piaget among others, with its 
conservation rules and matrix algebras. This is the same obdurate that 
requires me to wipe off after net sex, the same that feeds me coffee when 
I type far into the night.

The introjections and projections throughout the screening are something 
else, however; they are the premise of a different life, a promise. I 
have felt some of my strongest emotions in _this_ realm, which are, at 
the same time, undercut by their irreality. I must type _constantly_ in 
this world in order to, at least in part, fill and fulfill a world which 
also _constantly_ threatens to foreclose on me. If I come, I must type 
that here; if I am laughing, I must indicate that in a number of ways _in 
excess_ of laughing itself. Thus, as I have pointed out elsewhere, the 
ontological domains get confused; communication here is not only speech 
but continuous redescription.

So there is an hysteric displacement of ordinary reactions onto and
through text to the other, offering this displacement ("*grin*") to the
other as a sign of authenticity, at least within gaming. And this requires
extraordinary expenditure of emotion, both _having_ it and _writing_ it
simultaneously. 

All of which leads to the buzz, the body uncoupled from itself, the body 
in flight. And the buzz, with the accompanying intensity of emotion, re- 
sults so quickly in realignments of the social in everyday life as well, 
as if I am ready to give myself up to _your text_ over the very hardness 
of this chair, the view from a window, the wetness on my body. 

And again as I have pointed out elsewhere, the intensity, which comes 
from reading's generation of distance and intimacy, is also related to 
the language, or at least structuration, of the unconscious (see my 
writings on the ascii unconscious, third sex); _your words_ are spoken 
internally _by me_ as I read them at my own pace - they become me, are 
one with my breath, my body. I am carried into your distance, away from 
my own, and am lost in your textual body.

Stress

Stress results among epistemologies, ontologies, responsibilities, all
discordant with one another. And the stress results as well from incip-
ient psychosis, tethered and therefore controlled, but psychosis nonethe-
less. I find myself hurtling almost suicidally if I am on-line too long - 
hurtling, not like a vector-towards, but like a crystallized flooding- 
among, an expansion that simultaneously mirrors and breaks the mirror 
apart. The shattering comes from the _solitary_ cup of coffee, _solitary_ 
wetness on my body which turns into nuisance, _solitary_ pacing in the 
dark corners of the loft looking out into landscapes of decay, looking 
back at my own body, trying to rend it into _something else,_ anything, 
that would rid it of its weight. 

It is a bad state and it is a common state, and it is the state of a 
future which is close upon us. How long can we continue to read others, 
to read ourselves, in prescribed fashion within bandwidths that fore- 
close almost all of our senses? Even full-bandwidth audio and video do 
nothing but exacerbate this psychosis, which can lose its tether of 
course, become substitution.

Perfect Substitution

Perfect substitution will come about when cyberspace finally forecloses, 
finally seals the body off, within it. At that point, there will be no 
difference, no differance, and psychosis (as in the ultimate trajectory 
of Chislenko's intelligent filters) will be indiscernible; it will be a 
state of pure interiority. Until that point, the tiniest little thing, 
again, serves as a reminder of the obdurate, of the almost suicidal edge 
some of us are riding here, the imaginary (not the symbolic) skittering 
across unknown contours, the cup of coffee or dissolute body only two 
objects among an accessibly high finite number of them.

Doctor

Someday the doctor will come. Someday the doctor will come and will peer 
up at me peer down at me. Someday the doctor will come and she will take 
notes or she will not take notes and she will have apparatus or she will 
not have apparatus.

And I will look at the doctor and say "who."

Turf


On PMC2 I have been proposing a MOO model based on gangs, turf, and 
mobile populations, rather than land/hierarchy. The turf, home turf, is a 
place which may be abandoned, may be approached; it's not definitive, not 
a totality. The populations survive, on-MOO or off-MOO; they are users, 
whose homes are temporary, not builders, inhabiting. They come together 
to talk, discuss, make things, convocation.

The turf is dirty, problematic; the MOOs have loose ends, are never as 
strictly regulated as they appear. It's possible to have well-defined 
logics in the small; thus @show <x> will give a great deal of informa- 
tion, but there are always half-abandoned projects, names, deeper levels, 
artifacts, around, to augment the central core which may or may not be 
controlled. 

The model stresses the role of the gang-leaders who are the staff, the
wizards, and whose power is largely that of negation, _not_ to do this,
not to exceed that, issues of bandwidth, some issues of belonging. So the
model also ties into postmodern issues of the decline of the nation-state,
of mirco-territories, of gang signings as well, contested territories.

Within the MOO, the contestation is limited, but the MOO is never a nece- 
ssary home, and that makes all the difference: if you don't like it here, 
take your objects elsewhere. And all the time, remember your objects are 
texts, and can be downloaded by you. You are not a pioneer so much as 
someone temporarily residing in a worn-out neighborhood, using bricolage 
to construct equally temporary shelter.

The gang-leaders don't always get along, either, and among them the only 
absolute power is that of pulling the plug. They know the resources are 
limited; they get tired as well.

What everyone does on the MOO is _wryting._ I use _wryting_ to refer to 
that act of inscription that appears to construct, through those proble- 
matic ontologies I have written about. Everyone wrytes one's way into and 
out of these spaces; wryting always defines the margins, because within 
the MOO, _everywhere is equally a margin,_ that is the nature of wryting 
as opposed to land or territory in real life.

The _internal topology_ defined by entrances and exits, etc. may appear 
closed, by the wryting is both internal and external, and the latter is 
just as likely to be, is always, marginal. This, no matter how the 
directory structure is organized; one is _always wryting on the surface 
of the MOO._

Wryting is always a form of gang signing as well, redefining the space as
mine-in-relation-to the MOO, the gang-leaders, the leaky environment. For
the MOO is always leaky; one is never there _all the time,_ but one floats
in and out of this generalized expandable landscape.

The usual model of the MOO, it seems to me, and this would apply to almost
all of these applications, is that of the city-state or community. But
this model is that of rummaging, moving from one space to another; very
few of us remain on a MOO permanently, no one twenty-four hours a day,
every day. We come, wryte (whether text or program-text), leave. We are
not even so much consumers as reorienting of the margins, the conscious-
ness we bring there. These are important distinctions...
