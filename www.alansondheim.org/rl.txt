Very old sarangi instrument

http://www.alansondheim.org/oldsarangi1.mp3 bowed
http://www.alansondheim.org/oldsarangi2.mp3 plucked
http://www.alansondheim.org/oldsarangidroned.mp3 droned

traded for this today, I think probably mid-late 19th-century.
the skin is thick, the sympathetic strings difficult to tune.
in the process of restoration and setting up.
the first piece is learning a different bowing/fingering technique.
the second piece is plucking the strings.
the third piece is droning the instrument.
the first piece is rough to say the least.
the second piece is rag-tag sprightly.
the third piece is successful and almost song.
the first piece is playing harmonics and SA MA sa.
the second piece is roaming around the strings and body.
the third piece is full reverberation.
the first piece is partial reverberation.
the second piece is partial reverberation.
the third piece is full double early reflections.
the first piece is successful ten percent.
the second piece is successful forty percent.
the third piece is successful one hundred percent.
the first piece is waking up.
the second piece is afternoon.
the third piece is nighttime and now good night.

8       my guitar is my friend, i've had it for half a
        century, and it is my friend, and sounds happy
        so much when i play my friend my guitar

        http://www.alansondheim.org/practiced.mp3 (sarangi)        

        a practice session is a great place to try things out.
        i'd give this a rating of seventy-percent.
9       it's on the newer sarangi, just a few years old.
        i'm somewhere around the key of a minor.
10      it's good meditation music when the depths appear.
        or when the buzzing fades in and out, very controlled,
        controlled so you won't be offended or disturbed,
11      and there are only a few errors, which means only a few
12      unintended moments, for the most part everything is as
13      i heard it internally just at the moment of sounding.

I'm Digressing a course for Underacademy College - here's the description:

EDIBLE AVATARS, ANOREXIA, AND FALSE ACCUSATION: THE THEORETICAL BASES OF 
HOLOGRAPHIC FUTURES AND MELANCHOLIA

Edible avatars succumb to anorexia; prims have little or no body of 
course, although avatars might be accused of just about anything, 
including. Holographic objects have no weight and that makes them sad; if 
you're a tree in a forest you can't hear an avatar crying in any case.

Digressor: Alan Sondheim

We've been discussing the topic - mainly dealing with avatars and 
apparitions, anorexia, pain, The Visible Human Project, and other related 
issues. The blog is at http://anorecticavatar.blogspot.com/ and open for 
comments from anyone.

I'm really happy at the level and direction of the discussion; I'm 
learning a lot from everyone. Please give a read!

Thanks, Alan, Digressor

Transforming Jodi's Quake mod into musical score
for Natalie Portman's Black Swan combined with
prosthetic legs for Portman's character, therefore
illustrating the toll ballet took on her, and in
this case, I add, on every dancer, male or female,
on our blue planet earth. The legs shall dance in
another world and another life, over and over
again, their injuries only signs of brilliance and
inconceivable dedication and virtuosity.

when things turn out death gets hir chance to sing

death is a woman following me
death is a tall man in a black fedora
death follows me and sings hir mournful tune
death owes me nothing and gives me nothing
i scream at death you owe me a piece of wood
you owe me a nineteenth-century piece of wood to make a flageolet
death pays no attention and hides the piece of wood
the wood is a cylinder designed for breathing and singing
the wood cries out, i am useless, death has me in hir grasp
i beg you i say to death release my piece of wood
anything you say to death, death has heard a million times over
in every language and cry, death has not listened
i will record my language and cry to death and here it is
here it is death, you can take it or leave it

extended meditation with extended denouement

http://www.alansondheim.org/labor.mp3 sarangi

please listen with earphone with as much fidelity
as possible, you will be rewarded.

the sarangi used was the antique one, which i now
am fairly certain is a modified sindhi sarangi
with the two metal melodic/drone strings replaced 
by a traditional sarangi gut string. reverb was
added with adobe audition; the sarangi creates its
own cosmos or resonant space. labor of course is
fundamental to this music, which is exhausting to
play. as musicians we are never paid enough, not 
for our sound, not for our gift of meditation to
you, and not for our architecture. here is then
the promised gift; the musician fades away and may
not have sufficient means to survive for any
reasonable length of time, however defined. the
sarangi, too, needs tending; the pressure on the
bridge and pull of the strings is tremendous.
enjoy.

Sondheim's "Music"

He always plays out of tune.
He plays too fast and doesn't modulate enough.
He's got like ADD and can't focus on an instrument.
He can't hear intervals at all.
He thinks every instrument is the same.
He thinks every instrument is some kind of drum.
He thinks he's a genius with whatever he does.
He doesn't know how to listen, not even to himself.
He plays the same thing over and over.
He's always showing off.
He's a total fake and doesn't know it.
He's fraud and really doesn't care.
His music has no depth at all.
His music is just a lot of runs.
He repeats the same chords over and over again.
He's melodic ideas are moronic.
When he can't escape he throws tricks in.
He seems to be in love with the minor scale.
His minor scale is always the same minor scale.
He shouldn't be surprised his audience is tiny.
He shouldn't be surprised no one buys his stuff.
He's too embarrassed to look at the audience.
He's always too nervous to play well.
He's always dissonant but he can't hear it.
He can't tell one scale from another.
He thinks he can master just about anything.
His intonation is atrocious.
He can't play at all in tune without frets.
He should put his flute away or sell it.
His repairs are a joke.
He'd be lucky if his instrument's in tune.
He has no sense of dynamics except loud.
He accompanies other musicians like he's deaf.
Someone should take his instruments away.
He huffs and puffs like he's actually working.
He can't really play with any sense of rhythm.
He's either working free or mumbling four-four time.
He's one of the few who has no idea what he's doing.
He plays the most forgettable stuff I ever heard.
He seems to be in love with his own noise.
He can't play anything extended at all.
He's ridiculous for thinking he's important.
He's always thinking he's breaking new ground.
He knows nothing about music.
He doesn't listen to anything except himself.
He's the most arrogant musician I ever heard.
He won't let anyone else touch his instruments.
When he can't play something he just gets rid of it.
He spams Facebook and email lists with his garbage.
He thinks playing fast makes his music better.
He can't read music and doesn't think it matters.
He doesn't know when a peg slips and he's playing.
He gets this pseudo-deep expression when he plays.
He's always trying to play with his eyes closed.
Other musicians run from him.
He's the most desperate musician I know.
He gives music a bad name. 
He gives musicians a bad name.
He's a control freak and tries to run everything.
He's lucky if he has an audience of ten.
No one wants to listen to him.
The sooner his stuff is forgotten the better.



the gods have spoken

http://www.alansondheim.org/balalu.mp3

the rest is up to us.
but the gods have spoken.
i don't understand what they're saying.
just as soon as they begin to get somewhere near the universal
frequency, they leave the scene - we alone once again, mumbling
sounds and hoping for the existence of gluons like fireflies on
stretched strings.
just as soon as humming and buzzing confusion straightens out,
somewhere, something, someone, comes along and tries to pin it
down and this is called culture that operates locally.
my culture which is left up to us operates globally.
the gods told me they're a real mess thanks to us.

If I die tomorrow
will there be much sorrow
will there be much horror
if I die tomorrow

If I die today
will there be much play
will anybody pray
if I die today

If I have died before
I will wait at Heaven's door
I will wait and more
if I have died before

If I have died at all
I will wait upon your call
I will not rise or fall
if I have died at all

I will wait upon your call
if I have died at all

Kalakotkas, Osprey


Foofwa sent us the following link:

http://pontu.eenet.ee/player/kalakotkas.html

- A beautiful osprey nest on the border of Estonia and Latvia
- There were many birds in the background
- I thought I would play sarangi with the birds
- Well aware was I that the birds could never hear me
- Nonetheless I persevered in my accompaniment
- In Osprey1, I am working more with imitation
- But in Osprey2, I have composed a little tune as well
- Many times I have played with and for birds
- Many times they have answered me and we play together
- This time, I was at the mercy of the birds
- They would never hear whatever I played
- But I wasn't play for myself, I was playing for you as well
- And so I wanted to honor Estonia and Latvia, and you
- And above all, I wanted to honor the kalakotkas, the osprey
- I did not want to make a mistake!
- I wanted everything to be as perfect as possible!
- I wanted to touch nature through artificial technology
- I wanted here, the slightest hint of nature as well
- And of wilderness and of wild places I would never see
- Wild places I would honor with my playing
- Here are the two singings of the sarangi

http://www.alansondheim.org/osprey1.mp3 
http://www.alansondheim.org/osprey2.mp3

- And again, here is the living bird in her nest

Fifth Avenue, Dean Street, Urbanic

i play sarangi and bow

http://www.alansondheim.org/urbanic.mp3 

i awake from troubled sleep my body in incredible pain
the doctors can't find anything wrong
i've got kirba afaa xonso on the boombox
it's pouring outside and i can't see because of pain
i can't hear because of pain i can't feel anything
if you know me you know my pain which swells and crashes
quick it's time to pull out sarangi against the rain
there's noise on the streets, trucks and construction everywhere
when i sleep i hear jackhammering everywhere and wake all nervous
time i say for sarangi but it's so hard to play i say time for it
i do my best but what can one person do against an entire city
if bombs weren't illegal bombs would be everywhere
i drag myself and my instrument and begin to play
kirba afaa xonso in my mind stays in my mind
i will play music bombs and gunfire to death and then feel nothing
the bow goes bip bip the bow goes back and forth like rockets
the noise in the streets gets louder they are trying to drown me out
i am furious with them in this terrible pain and move to second octave
i am furious and move into third and begin to gain traction
my sarangi treads do not slip and my fingers ring strong and true
my fingers drive furrows deep into wood and my hands cut down bodies
i listen to kirba afaa xonso on the radio machine and the machine
i silence kirba afaa xonso and begin to play i am against the world
quick it's time all i have is bow and sarangi all i have is sound
they do not take sound from me they add sound to me
they add sound everywhere in my illness and my illness
look just there they have added sound i play sarangi and bow
i play sarangi and bow i play sarangi and bow


analog

http://www.alansondheim.org/152.mp3

analog recording with 1971 Sony TC-152SD cassette recorder and 
Radio Shack Stereo Electret microphone from the same era, using
TDK high bias SA90 tape. this is fed through Audacity into a
.wav file fed into Audition where normalization and studio reverb
are added and outputted as .mp3. the reason for all of this is
analog's ability to handle high-onset/format sound, resulting in
greater fidelity to the overall envelope of the instrument, even
though the high end cuts out around 15hz. I've been fascinated 
by the results: this is what I 'hear' in the room or directly
through headphones. the tape is edited to bring out oud, sarangi, 
pipa, and cura cumbus. the sarangi could have been better; I've
been bleary. I've been working with harmonics and 'grating' the
bow. oud, pipa, and cura cumbus are fine. 


trudy

sometimes you just make error after error until
you're fascinated by them and thee occur in the 
registers of timbre and approach to the instrument
itself. you're locked in there and produce the
first half of trudy. sometimes you just play 
slowly and the timbre comes, bringing with it the
potential for release, but you're remaining
guarded and can do little with it, and this 
produces the second half of trudy. sometimes you
have a premonition in the first half and a memory
in the second and that seems interesting to you
and you hold onto them as they bring life farther
into consciousness, holding the bad things at bay.
here is that consciousness and here is something
interesting, in 'trudy.'

last of the good-time boys for Tyler Stallings

http://www.alansondheim.org/lonesome.mp3

the good-time boys hear that lonesome whistle blow
the good-time bows have their ears to the track
they have their ears to the telegraph
anywhere there's steel, you'll find the good-time boys
anywhere there's noise, you'll find them breathing

Why Mexico? I just received a book on Mexico.
From here on a series of duets.
In the middle of them I'm lost. 
Chris' tone is beautiful.
Here and there, I'm ok: viola for example.
Flute kept me hearing MA-SA-SA-sa in my head.
DA+ on sarangi and sindhi sarangi.
I must restring that sindhi sarangi!
I must do that! Good effort on oud.
Good effort on parlor guitar.
Chris saves the day! I squander the night!
Mexico!

"playing sarangi, tending towards the resonance of sound, tun wood, what
might be heard, not too close to the give and take of bowing, the proper
sounding, sonic objects closer to the ongoing origination of things, this
time everything worked, the improvisation remained close to SA, meandering,
sliding through and around it, above as i can imagine a low ceiling, but one
extending forever, supporting itself with resonance */sound, resonance, it,

Vietnam

 In 1967, three years after Ali had won the World Heavyweight 
Championship, he was publicly vilified for his refusal to be conscripted 
into the U.S. military, based on his religious beliefs and opposition to 
the Vietnam War. Ali stated, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet 
Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger" . one of the more telling 
remarks of the era. [Wikipedia]

Philadelphia, PA

Alan Sondheim, Azure Carter (Brooklyn) & Helena Espvall (Philadelphia) 
Trio:

RECORD RELEASE SHOW! .The animists of Mari El aren.t the last pagans, not 
by a long shot. Cauldron is on the job, too, working the hot-stick on Ley 
lines from Giant.s Despair to Kingdom Come, with a backpack full of old 
tube equipment and spools of magnetic tape. Cauldron spins secret messages 
encoded in lace and tosses the achillea millefolium to see where to go 
next. Cauldron wants to remind you that all you see is not all there is. 
The margins of .things. are crawling, if you know how to look: ancient 
spirits, saints, faeries, fractal elves, jeweled self-dribbling 
basketballs, etc. etc. etc. The trick is to find your way back to an 
unmediated life. So take Cauldron.s hand. Ignore the fire-exit signs 
warning you that an alarm will sound. It won.t. Push the door open. 
stumble into brighter light. the untended back lot behind our shared 
reality. where weeds push stark flowers through cracks in the cement. once 
you get out there everything is so quiet, all you hear is the 
breezes-s-s-s. butterflies and blue lizards flit and skitter amid the 
rubble of forgotten thoughts. .How wonderful that you're here!. they say. 
.You come so rarely! We're so delighted to see you!.

Cauldron deals out a three of cups: Alan Sondheim, a pioneer of mystical 
ear-tweak and sci-fi sonic ritual sound, chamber-improv gypsy cellist 
Helena Espvall, and eco-trance singer Azure Carter. thrice to thine and 
thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine. Channeling the ghosts 
of Opal Whiteley and Lou Harrison, Cauldron conjures the scratch and shush 
of the Big Bang out of wood, wind and cat-gut. Whenever you listen to it, 
this album is always over too soon, just like life. Fire Museum and 
Tequila Sunrise Records deal out a two of pentacles: not to get all 
.Yankee Candle. here, but we only made 250 of these, so grab one before 
they melt away like chemtrails in the sunset sky." - Fred Astarte, Tequila 
Sunrise Records

note: This is what I'd like Azure and myself to sound like Saturday
night - in other words, with equalization and reverberation set 
to within a rough tolerance of what you're hearing. I'm not sure 
this is possible; I'm bringing a small amp, the MOTU which needs
tuning itself, and an instrument mic. Hopefully we can get this to
work out; otherwise voice and instruments might fall flat. In the
meantime, these three pieces give a good example of what I'm hoping
we can achieve; Azure's songs are beautiful, but the instruments
are of course difficult - at least here, they're within a range of
somewhat perfection?

Cauldron Release Set


The Fire Museum and Cauldron record release event -
at the Highwire, Philadelphia, last night

http://www.alansondheim.org/Cauldronrelease.mp3
(our full set)

Helena Espvall, cello, electronics
Azure Carter, songs, voice
Alan Sondheim, sarangi, oud, cura cumbus, viola (in that order)

Songs: Buried, Blood Tantra, Creatures 

This is a rough recording, with the sarangi under-recorded,
and Helena and Azure under-recorded on and off; I used a small
Marshall amp (which unfortunately was directed towards the zoom);
Helena and Azure used a large stage amp/mixer system (which
unfortunately was pointed elsewhere). But you'll get the idea.
The bill also included Dan Joseph on hammered dulcimer, and
the Jesse Kudler/Barry Weisblat Duo on electronics. The evening
was a success! We had a full audience. Thanks to everyone
who helped put the event together.

MARRIAGE TO LANGUAGE (words/music by Azurefrom words by Alan)


All my writing
Is an invitation 
For you to come closer

I do not know
Who you are
Nor will I know
When you come closer

When you come closer
I will not know you
When you come closer
You must heal me

All my writing
Is a desperate cry for healing

I will know you
When you heal me
I will know you
When you touch me

I will know you
When you hold me
You will know me
When I  know you

All my singing
Is an invitation 
For you to love me

I do not know
Who you are
Nor will I know you
When you love me

When you love me
I will not know you
When you love me
You must touch me

All my singing
Is a desperate cry for touching

I will know you
When you heal me
I will know you
When you touch me

I will know you
When you hold me
You will know me
When I  know you

All my talking
Is an invitation 
For you to raise me

I do not know
Who you are
Nor will I know you
When you raise me

When you raise me
I will not know you
When you raise me
You must hold me

All my talking
Is a desperate cry for holding

I will know you
When you heal me
I will know you
When you touch me

I will know you
When you hold me
You will know me
When I  know you

I will know you
I will know you
I will know you
When I know you




Fall


http://www.alansondheim.org/firrrry.mp4

We are all in gravity.

I should learn to "hang in there" but there's no place
to put the gallows.

If I tell a joke, I've already made a rigid structure
for the poles.

There's nothing funny about death and I always feel 
close enough to it that I'm temped to write a joke. 

It's raining out and the water, aided by gravity, makes
sure the bodies get wet.

Chills set in, pneumonia, you know the rest.

Looking Easier Than Reading

The physicality of the anomaly always asserts itself, even down the 
hierarchy of protocol layers. Google is everywhere, tabulating these and 
others; sometimes the real takes over when processing slows and crashes; I 
had one such crash during the making of the image. But the obdurate is 
there, among the remnants of sex, which are not there, and death, which 
is: that is the only equation, and one that persists in existing until 
life is eradicated. We can't place our bets because there will be no one 
to collect. Many such images as these are on many such planets, however 
ephemeral; even Mars has its markings. If a tree falls, it falls, and it's 
gone, just as the sound is gone. These gasped at zero to forty miles an 
hour and the next time the configuration will be different, as it already 
is, fading, history is fading. The truth, Badiou, is that books don't live 
forever, and Google's privacy is a sham. Anyone can burrow the database 
from within; we all live in tunnels beneath the firewalls where there is 
nothing done, nothing to be done. A friend of mine constantly takes notes 
to use against people. Badiou takes notes to how how the world's held, but 
the world's held up by philosophy in both senses of the phrase, just not 
in the physical. It's on the way out. We're on the way out, we're already 
"that class," as my grade school teacher said, implying we'd live forever 
in infamy. She's dead now, everything in the world is different and 
sattered, shattering. If you're born in the middle of it, you die in the 
middle of it. We're just desperate to keep alive, we dream of sex and 
fantasy, in the imaginary, die, in the real, and grovel in surplus in the 
symbolic. These images are tombstone, graves, they're beneath the ground, 
on the bridge they're struggling. I do philosophy this way because it's 
easier to read.

Music for Our 11th Wedding Anniversary

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/842 (best listening)

Today is Azure's and my 11th wedding anniversary! 
So we keep working with voice and the old sarangi, which now
has four strings tuned somewhat like the sindhi sarangi. We
might be able to use it for the Electronic Literature Conf.
in West Virginia, but it's hard to see how we'll get the 
instrument down. In any case, we quite like anniv3 and 
anniv4 is a ukulele solo in celebration and joy at our being
together for almost thirteen years! Love, Alan and Azure

American Museum of Natural History

relatively unlabeled hodge-podge of biodiversity (which is rapidly
coming to an end as extinctions increase world-wide). the flora,
fauna, fungi, and so forth are indicated by shape and design, not
by biomes (although to be fair, the rest of the museum is based on
them) - the design exhausts the idea of natural history, which is
neither nature nor history, nor any combination of these troubled
terms. the museum itself is caught in a time-warp of a dying
planet: the bookstore features books about the crisis, and the 
wild animal panoramas now seem sepulchers. the museum is a tomb of
life-forms, doing what it can against the onslaught. the life-
forms themselves are mythologies denuded of microbial and other
subtle environmental factors; what counts is display. there were
children everywhere, loving it; i hope at the very least that the
sense of wonder that was clearly awakened leads to commitment
before it's too late for all of us.

that can't be stopped, that changes constantly, you want to
say please slow up, you'll have an avatar heart-attack, you
reply, an avatar has no heart, i reply, you hated this then
thought it carried over the arteries of avatarwoman working
beneath the surface, electric energy that can't be stopped,
that changes constantly, you wanted to say, please speed, 
you'll have an avatar fugue-state, i reply, an avatar has 
no states, you say, you loved this when you knew avatars,
when you knew them, conformal sheets that bind then applied 
with feynman diagrams, all those confluences, then split, 
proper time of the avatars working beneath the surface,
