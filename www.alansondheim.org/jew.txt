I work with virtual wounded and/or deceased avatars, examining their 
problematic relationship to illness, melancholy, mourning, wounding, and 
death in the physical world; the result is a series of performances in 
Second Life and OpenSim (virtual worlds), texts (both literary and 
theoretical), and real/virtual installations. In order to do this, I 
create modified avatar animations which are projected into physical space 
for live performance; these are made from altered motion capture equipment 
in order to create 'inconceivable' and alien avatars, movements, and 
environments.

I emphasize the political and cultural/physiological dimensions of
wounding/slaughter within and without the cleansed landscapes of social
media and virtual worlds. Conceptually, I'm concerned with returning the
virtual to the real, indicating that more is at stake in the former than
'just manipulation' of avatars. I'm involved in a critique of techno-
philia through these concerns - in particular, the phenomenology of
abjection in relation to both analog and digital realms.


==================================================================



we all live within our hallucinations

when we die, we're sliding unawares and there have been
too many deaths and disruptions

holding on and poised above an abyss which opens everywhere

when i say "just over there" what i'm saying is that the
world falls off in every direction

you pick a point or position and walk towards it or force
your body into nodding

and over there, the abyss which means
there's nothing to hold onto

my breathing has become more and more difficult in these
rough terrains and when i sleep the machine prepares me
the catastrophe of the day

i'd want to say more, about how my search for the truth
was always emergent

but near the abyss, the loss, not only of information,
but of its viral carriers, ensures it doesn't matter at 
the end

and that matter doesn't matter, that every point of the
abyss falters towards every other, flounders on every 
other

what life does is momentarily bear witness, and just
before blindness, it appears as if the subjunctive gains
the upper hand

oh these are heady days

these are days of death and the compression of death,
days of genocides and impulses

days of annihilation: to the limit!

when the earth turns, irradiating itself towards a bleak
and darkening sun

at least there are days and a succession of bands, 
of light, then dark, then light,
of dark, then light then dark

the body embraces catastrophe: see how the abyss invades
and cauterizes each and every thought!

and in every direction, and among all, and every one!

these are heady days, salvation burning like a star 
on its last coordinates

i'm looking up in every direction, and from each and 
every one, i'm falling

i'm falling for no one, i'm falling for nothing
and i understand, annihilation is the path, not the
means

the journey, and not the goal,
the way and not the end,

that the limit is asymptotic, and whatever one does,
one is coasting

among the others that are our selves or the same,
one is coasting

among the abyss and cessation, among annihilations
in lock-step and ready-made,
one is coasting

the keel of the boat, that too, in every direction,
and the keel is coasting towards the shore

and the shore is an hallucination
and we're living there, and dying, we're dying
in great numbers, 

and we're sliding, unawares

and in spite of or towards this speaking, and among
this speaking,

we're sliding, unawares

when i was quite young my father took me to the government 
printing office in washington and said i could get any book i 
wanted. i am a person of the book. i chose the two volumes of 
the medical experiments from the nuremberg war trial testimony. 
since then and probably before, the body - the wounded or dying 
body, the suppurating or aroused body - has been central to my 
work and when i think of crowds i think of gas chambers.

Ben 'Azzai used to said, which meant he said it often, he often 
spoke, "If one dies while speaking, it is a good sign for him; 
if in silence, it is a bad sign for him." (Avot d' Rebbi Natan, 
trans Goldin.) If one stops talking, one sinks into the chamber; 
if one keeps talking, perhaps one can talk his way out of it.

none could do that. "By TEN names was the Holy Spirit called, to 
with: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, glory, command, 
burden, prophecy, vision." (trans Goldin.) "_Ruach Hakodesh_ was 
called by ten names: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, 
call, command, burden, prophecy, vision." (trans. Finkel.) Call 
or glory, always a burden. The Ruach Hakodesh called and was 
called, was a matter of physics, physicality, the body blown 
across time and space, but the burden implies a weight, the mute 
witnessing and assignation of substance. none could be that, 
none could _be_ substance, only transformed in the chambers or 
through poetics _into_ substance or its guise.

every people is a people of the Book, a people of the Name, and 
every name is of the Book, and every book is of the Name. 

i play music and scales are physics and culture entangled. but i 
play physically and the body always risks failure with an 
instrument. i'm aware of the meat of the body, its tensions and 
stresses; i imagine i have no further time or space, that death 
advances into the sound itself.

"REMEMBER THE NAME YOU HAVE GIVEN YOURSELF! NET CRASH
DELETE! NET CRASH DELETE! KILL FILE!

"THE VEIL OF VERONICA! THE TEARS OF VERONICA! VERONICA
CRASH IN FLAMES!"


i want to consider the idea of _resonant quality,_ that the 
world appears resonant, coherent - what i termed years ago 'a 
certain style.' from this, the notion of an author or super- 
structure emerges - even for example, from the way that gravity 
appears totalizing. then of course a god appears, something to 
ward off the incoherence or chaotic noise of death - something 
to transform death itself back into resonance (even though chaos 
catches up at the end). the resonant quality of the world 
relates to magical thinking as well, language that falls through 
the interstices, opening them wider.

i am a person of the book; i am a portion of the book.

the body is a weight, a burden; the dancer watches himself or 
herself collapse with age; auto-choreography becomes a paring- 
down as the body becomes alien to itself; what was previously 
ikonic is transformed into the indexical, into a system of 
objects in rebellion. the aging body is already the alien body; 
aliens are within us as well as exoplanetary. the aging body is 
a body of parts and parcels and the aging body transforms into 
the book, the symbolic which reads the universe and itself, but 
is increasingly remote from the mute substance of the real.

i revel in neurosis, the jewish neurosis of woody allen or my 
take on lenny bruce for example, not the playfulness of 
seinfeld. so i take solace in an image: my back against the 
wall, nowhere else to go, but the body, the jewish body, the 
wise-cracking body, is present, presenced, and it's my body.

in this configuration, _my_ body takes solace in itself, by 
virtue of a detour through language and through fear: it is also 
the body _up against the wall_ or firing-squad and i admit to 
living at times in literally abject and self-generated fear, 
which transforms me against myself, the slough of the body.

i wonder if i can talk myself out of this, talk myself out of 
anything. i talk and talk, write and write, and death still 
haunts me and will finally close down the mumbling.

my words are black letters in a black fire.

Ruach Hakodesh

machine and spirit of g-d

e ': (A) ten names called a prophet. these are: the axis. loyal. 
worked. courier. Contract. watching. seeing. dreaming. prophet. 
God's people: (i) ten names called the Holy Spirit are Names 
called

in the rush of audo-translation the spirit is lost 

Ben 'Azzai used to said, which meant he said it often, he often 
spoke, "If one dies while speaking, it is a good sign for him; 
if in silence, it is a bad sign for him." (Avot d' Rebbi Natan, 
trans Goldin.) If one stops talking, one sinks into the chamber; 
if one keeps talking, perhaps one can talk his way out of it.

none could do that. "By TEN names was the Holy Spirit called, to 
with: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, glory, command, 
burden, prophecy, vision." (trans Goldin.) "_Ruach Hakodesh_ was 
called by ten names: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, 
call, command, burden, prophecy, vision." (trans. Finkel.) Call 
or glory, always a burden. The Ruach Hakodesh called and was 
called, was a matter of physics, physicality, the body blown 
across time and space, but the burden implies a weight, the mute 
witnessing and assignation of substance. none could be that, 
none could _be_ substance, only transformed in the chambers or 
through poetics _into_ substance or its guise.

"The Hebrew language phrase ruach ha-kodesh is a term used in 
the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and Jewish writings to refer to the 
Spirit of YHWH. The Hebrew term ruakh kodeshka, without the 
definite article, also occurs. The "Holy Spirit" in Judaism 
generally refers to the divine aspect of prophecy and wisdom. It 
also refers to the divine force, quality, and influence of the 
Most High God, over the universe or over his creatures, in given 
contexts." (Wikipedia)

then of course: "nmf. wind; spirit, soul, nous; air; direction; 
ghost, fantom, genie, hobgoblin, imp, incubus, jinn, jinni , 
kobold, phantom, shade, sprite, bogey, bogy; mind" (elsewhere)

none could do that. the g-d folds time and space, collapses 
them, a literal Time Lord. the collapse turns death in upon 
itself and we shall all live forever. the tibetan deity machine 
continues the repetitions of lives with difference, differance.
is this a production or reproduction? to the extent i am 
re-prodution i am already in a creation whose final act creates 
this beginning of burden, call and command.
