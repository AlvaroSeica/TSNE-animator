the avatar of light ascendent

dissolution of visual ontologies
what's left, but rays from one to another, one to one
software's accidents renewing wayward beauty

can you recognize beauty, nikuko
without form or substance, the dreaming of beauty

beauty dreams, what does beauty, dreaming
beauty dreaming of beauty, beauty  illuminated, silent, 
slightly bored
tears and sighs of beauty, murmur of beauty dreaming
ennui of beauty, the cliffs

presence of software, always its absence
absence of software, always its presence

hir beauty from within, illumination
beauty is never without

beauty is never without, what, but the presence of darkness
but yes, the presence of darkness, presence of light

the canyons. look outside, julu, beauty is without
look inside, travis, distraught slaughter melds, fallow, away

hir rising, hir searching ascendent beneath the waves,
hir illumination

o how the earth-hearth shatters, that such light bursts forth
o jennifer, shafts and clouds of light

death, the dust, partners, particles, unimaginable seeings
death, the dust, time tangled in hir wayward lightening

- Levels of thought returning knowledge -

( Working through the visual/audio/new media work I create, in relation 
to writing theory, description, explanation.)

- Levels of thought returning knowledge -

- Abstract mathematics, logic: theoretically exact structures undermined 
from within. Independent of representation.

- Mathematical physics: structures aligned through taxonomy and experi- 
mentation. Aligned representation.

- Interpretive gestures relating both to ordinary language, making sense 
of the world in terms of lived phenomena. Local linguistic tropes.

- Philosophical constructs within the interstices of the above three, 
positioning human consciousness and apperception within physical, psycho- 
logical, and psychoanalytical models. Language within the humanities.

- Visual representations of the first two as models or guides to the third 
and fourth. Separations of models and analogs, metaphors and metonymies on 
a practical level.

- Visual constructions extending concepts of consciousness and perception 
through illogical or surreal means.

- Revisioning worlds through mathematics, physics, and language, as 
natural or unnatural kinds in possible universes.

- Anthropic principles described in terms of mathesis, physics, and the 
neurophysiology of mind.

- Cultural productions, rites and rituals as superstructures unlinked to 
physics and mathematics.

- Cultural productions loosely based on metaphoric interpretations of 
physical and mathematical structures.

- Cultural productions researching the internal consciousness and phenom- 
enology of formal mathematical and physical structures.

- Working within the last, producing experiences that require negotiation 
of normative perception, involving 'Hamiltonians' for the appearances and 
appetition of otherwise spatialities, causalities, temporalities.

- Constructing a psychoanalytics of rapprochement of practical and theor- 
etical knowledge of the world.

- Constructing this psychoanalytics through experience of sensory modal- 
ities beyond those of standard writing/inscription.

- Problematizing inscription itself as fundamental mode of being in the 
body, the world, the symbolic.

- Finding means to take such experiences as given, for example, among 
deliberately virtual worlds, and re-presenting them to others, in such a 
manner that they return and enter into symbolic discourse.

- In other words creating discussion around experience that deepens our 
understanding of the inherently alien (in the sense of everyday life) 
nature of the world.

- So that one inhabits both more or less traditional lifeworlds, and 
worlds within which traditional mathematico-logical constructs no longer 
hold (dimensionalities, standard definitions of number, identity, duality, 
entanglement, and so forth).

- Bringing or dragging, therefore, the self back into the most serious 
game, that of the entanglement of existence and essence, entanglement of 
epistemology and ontology, that deconstructs and circumvents all such 
categories, without replacement.

- Therefore producing a weakened phenomenology of reception within a 
knowing of the world, its social and cultural, its ecological manifesta- 
tions, in such a manner that a priori ideological constructs and textual 
inerrancies are circumvented as well.

- Returning always to the intertwined processes of knowledge and exper- 
ience, experimentation that, in both immediacy and imminence may be cast 
aside, such casting aside contributing to the weakened phenomenology, as 
if phenomenology because phenomenology of the residue, weakened to degree 
zero in anti-commutative algebras, truncated emissions for example, or the 
shape-riding of spews, field fluxes, unlocalized transmissions to be sure, 
unlocalized receptions as well.

- Never returning to 'the things themselves,' which have never existed, 
except across surmountable surfaces, things are interruptions in flows, 
slow decays, the displacement and circumambulation of slaughter.

- Marginalizing inscription under erasure and deconstruction, returning 
philosophy to cosmology and localized ethico-cultural considerations.

- Opening the literary again to rhizomes within sensoria that have been 
forgotten.

- Opening and reopening the social of media, the phenomenology of the 
opening as well, charting the phenomenology, remaining always in a state 
of withdrawal of participant-observation, never leaving the scene of the 
crime.

- Marking and re-marking the erasure of all theoretical constructs, noting 
carefully the life and lives of theories in relation to slaughter, death, 
cultural reinterpretation, the culling of history, the negation-effects of 
mathesis and ongoing mathematical-scientific exploration.

- Separating the doing of science from scientific structure, within an 
ideality ultimately dictated by the cosmos, recognizing the absolute of 
science, that it is not one among many discourses, but it is 'that' 
discourse which continues a process of revelation, in spite of the 
ideological-political processes that surround its activities.

- And again, never returning to 'the things themselves,' which are already 
lost, dead through repetition, and dead.

- Levels of knowledge returning thought -

games

well, this idea came about with doubled avatars, one of whom is still 
broken, unable to load hir clothing and accessories, and the other of whom 
has already lost most of hir attributes; in any case, they interact with 
each other in a clotted environment, starting out as swagger, then 
gradually emerging their games into the environment, swirling through each 
other (which ordinarily is not permitted in second life) as a result of 
one or another's uncanny attachment to objects, the games based on back- 
dreams of maenads for example, or live performances, these however created 
while i ran back and forth among computers, orchestrating everything, as 
if these avatars had lives of their own, philo thinks through materiality 
as apart and i think of it as aperture

rainy day

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rainyday.mp3 

endless grey and snowy or rainy days, and
the sun rises on a rainy day,
and i imagine a long tube from the cloud cover and rainy sky and all the
simple questions take you through the rainy days, the hard times

my way, and violet light in rainy weather will be
almost worn away, dangerous, a rainy day, and the greys, blacks, and
rainy rainy nikuko, and
the sun rising on a rainy day, 
appearing once during april's rainy wound
and the sun rising on a rainy day

the bedroom wall seeps moisture whenever there's a rainy wind, 
and from her mouth sag carved pipe, the very best world,
and on a rainy day

on a rainy afternoon, as usual thinking about death and decay
the sun rising on this rainy rainy day

On the rewrytings, rewrythings, of the culling / interpreting texts *


You'd have to go through the texts to discover the innovations that occur 
at almost every turn. The culling operations are never 'pure'; they lend 
themselves to rearrangements, re-editings, textual manipulations of all 
sorts. The end results is a theory mashup, but a theory nonetheless. The 
mashup creates an entangled state in terms of definition, the position of 
the subject (reader, theorizer, experimenter), the original theoretical 
structure and substructure, and so on. From the entangled state, from the 
mashup, three fields emerge: that of the original theoretical structure, 
now somewhat transformed or reinterpreted; that of the positioning of 
subjectivity and its phenomenology in relation to the theory; and that of 
a 'doubled diegesis.' The doubled diegesis combines and entangles the 
traditional elements of narratology - what sorts of stories may be 
revealed in the text - with a phenomenological diegesis - what the subject 
(in any sense) is discovering and interpreting in relation to a self- 
reflexive hermeneutics. It's this last that behaves as a kind of textual 
_operator_ situated between the subject and the original theorizing.

If the theory is mathematical and complete, to the extend that it is, and 
remains formalizable, the transformations above (considered as a series or 
collocation of operations and writings/wrytings) are distortions at best. 
But if the theory entangles the subject (even mathematically, as in QM), 
then the phenomenology of subjectivity, from the position(ing) of the 
subject, is revealed; what emerges is a theoretical corpus that is part 
psychological-philosophical and part structural, and that re-presents the 
subject to hirself in relation to generalized operations of encodings and 
decodings, coagulations and dissipations, etc., all in relation to what is 
understood by the theory and the _subject-matter_ of the theory as well.

The entangled mashup, in other words, tends towards new paths through the 
_body of theory,_ emphasizing the body of the subject and its abjections, 
inscriptions, and materiality. All of this is a way of doing theory, or 
re-doing the re/presentation of theory, tending towards new and different 
phenomenologies of approach, relevance, interpretation, and appetition. 
How and what is grasped, what is the semiotics and abjections of such 
grasping, what is developed and developing - these are the sorts of things 
involved.

The entangled mashup is also a textual body, and a body of text; it is 
wryterly, in this entanglement and in the sense that a kind of unraveling 
must be done, in order for it to operate. There is no 'correct' operation 
- no well-defined path; otherwise, the mashup would emerge as an imminent 
and coherent, as well as somewhat linear, system or description involving 
protocol sentences. Instead, a more suitable metaphor might be that of a 
surgery involving cuts, folds, sutures, pathways and bypasses, coagulents 
and fields - a surgery that is performed, again entangled, among the 
subject's subjectivities, the texts, the originary texts, and the theory - 
if there were one in the first place - as well as its structures and 
substructures.

In short what emerges is a partial discourse of part-objects, resulting, 
one can only hope, in new modes of understanding, or comprehension - a 
discourse that is both a dwelling and in-dwelling, that says something at 
the same time that what is being said is already weakened, already 
entangled in the subject, hir body, the diegesis, the fragment or frag- 
ments, and just about everything else.


* Texts which are initially produced by a command or series of commands 
such as:

k%: grep -h [word|phrase] [set of texts] >> [initial collection]

This can be changed/interpreted in various ways. What it says is that 
lines containing a particular word or phrase in a set of texts, should be 
placed, in order, in another text, in the order in which they are found. 
This text, the initial collection, can then be sorted, re-edited, appended 
to, etc. - any number of additional operations in fact. The final opera- 
tion is that of rewriting 'by hand,' re-conforming the result to emergent 
meanings which relate to, extend, contradict, or otherwise in-form the 
original word or phrase. The word or phrase which is initially chosen, 
references particular theories or placements within the set of texts. For 
example, 'incest' might bring up a number of statements or partial-state- 
ments, phrases etc., with the word 'incest' in them. The statements spill 
out beyond lines - this is where editing comes in, to rewrite the state- 
ments to bend and entangle the theory in (its) language itself.

What seems obscure and complex here is often simple in practice. And the 
processes don't always work, in which case the entangled text, no matter 
how worked and reworked, etc., is discarded.


[On the other hand, even if they do work, are they anything more than a
self-administered exquisite corpse? And what good can come out of that?]

NEW OLD CZECH VIOLIN AND AZURE'S NEW SONG

new old Czech violin:
we don't have heat here at the moment, playing in the cold:
carpal tunnel raises its nervous fingers:
playing through cold and pain just as the spy comes in:
truly ugly or beautiful i can't tell anymore:
but cold yes, freezing in here, not really freezing:
using what, the viola bow on the violin:
vertical and tuned GDgd as always:
i can only imagine what musicians do without heat:
without lodging and the threat of slaughter:
privileged here but still cold and still in pain:
i'm a coward and trivial, i'd never die for this:
it talks back, it talks to me:
it says, truly ugly or not, you can't tell anymore:
you can't even look in a mirror:
wracked with privileged misery, just listen to the music:
play it, then listen, then play it then listen:
think you'll learn, you'll learn nothing, you never have:
new old Czech violin, as above:

yet

beyond these three letters lies the range of possibilities hanging, from 
the slimmest thread, from the aegis of classical causality.

the patois of patios

an n-dimensional plane with its language of particles and particle 
exchange. yet lives in a cloud of probabilities, near the expression 
as-if.

as-if something happened instead of something else happening.

where yet appears: in spite of something else happening, in spite of the 
possibility of something else happening.

but not exactly in spite - something with less fervor, or something 
against which the scale of fervor is meaningless.

nearby is might as well, as if it might happen. distinctions - yet, it 
might happen no matter what - yet, it might happen as a result of - .

as a result of - causal in appearance, the germ of cultural origination.

Pipa, New York


both of these pieces interest me, moving in new directions
and after listening to Wu Man ( http://wumanpipa.org )

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/newyork1.mp3
notes: traffic as accompaniment, traffic as interference
pipa as interference, pipa as accompaniment
finally giving traffic, city-sounds a voice, almost a holler
sound transformations: reverberation, hiss reduction, normalization

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/almost.mp3
notes: almost a tune, struggling to find a tune
minor seconds separated by major seconds, minor thirds
i think of the tune as asymptotic, almost arriving
for some reason Simmel's stranger in the city comes to mind
sound transformations: reverberation, normalization

metropolis

not much happening here but all those unison movements in close to 
darkness were this black and white and so many years ago cut into
with bleak surgery unkind and again now elemental redistribution
here as if regrets are drawn out and how can anyone not have
remorse over everything in his or her life for none of this water
have the power to wash away sins or misrecognitions or oversights
r boorishness as if others were inconceivable in this world of 
guilt and slaughter or as if others wore the face of innocence
themselves and no longer anyone be heard

http://www.alansondheim.org/metropolis.mov


yet another strange instrument

this time a bass zither, probably american, maybe made by washburn/lyon 
and healy, has that sort of purfling. the fingerboard is troublesome, two 
of the five strings are shot. the bass strings really _are_ bass strings; 
the chord strings are also deep. the instrument is huge for a concert 
zither with a thick top and bottom. i'm still trying to get it to hold 
tune. http://www.alansondheim.org/bz1.mp3 and 
http://www.alansondheim.org/bz2.mp3 which sounds slightly like pipa. after 
i reset the action and it sounds duller, but that might be the result of 
the contact mic/amp combination; the mic is sandwiched between two pieces 
of cork beneath the instrument. there's no label. it's worth listening to 
these for the tone color, strangeness, something like five octaves to play 
around with, and strange fingering technique. lao tzu would say sounds 
leap out of sounds. that's how these pieces were intended (that's how they 
were meant to be).

things rise to the surface, or rather their glimmers, appearances, barely 
visible, as if clear delineation were muffled from world's origin.

1. clear definition is smeared across potentials and fields;
2. clear definition never existed in the first place - it's a chimera 
whose appearance is the result of a false extrapolation back from the 
surface.

like the pipa, this zither is difficult to play; what struggles to emerge 
is often occluded by error, clumsiness, stings detuning, ignorance. but 
like the pipa, clearly this instrument is filled with ghost matrices, 
baryons of all sorts, uncanny jitters' memories.

take me with him. i'll have him naked before the ballet. ambassador will

dreaming about the ambassador.

(nikuko) i'm going now, alan, the ambassador's dead, only god can bring
the ambassador back alive.

(nikuko, dancing) dear god, please bring the ambassador back alive. oh god 
help me in this and i can look up your legs. bring back my ambassador, 
resurrect him, he'll save you, he has heard so much.

(nikuko) oh god thank you, hello your ambassador, i'll do anything for you 

(continues dancing for the ambassador). (think naked Alan, naked Nikuko, 
dancing for ambassador.)

(ambassador) alan's perfect, god's a help, all's right with the world.

(applause) ambassador, everyone loves us, everyone wants us together. red 
slippers, i'll dance with god himself, you'll be my god, ambassador.

(ambassador) i'll save you, nikuko, and i'll save you too, alan.

(alan and nikuko) we thank you ambassador, and above all the whole world,

Pictures of Instruments and Planets:


For anyone who might be interested, (very rough but clear) photographs of 
the instruments I've been recording with recently -

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts01.jpg - Guzheng, 16 strings with movable 
bridges. This is a folk instrument; apparently in 1961, the guzheng was 
changed - more strings were added, and the end block was set curved, not 
straight. It's really a beautiful instrument.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts02.jpg - Pipa, weighing 8+ pounds, most 
likely rosewood body with black oxhorn frets and pegs. Tuning is Adea.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts03.jpg, 
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts04.jpg - Violin, with a fairly wide 
(front 
to back) body.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts05.jpg 
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts06.jpg - Viola, John Juzek, formerly 
Czech, now German, sounds really good on the low strings (I think unusual 
for a viola). I play this and the violin vertically; this is tuned CGcg 
and the violin, GDgd.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts07.jpg 
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts08.jpg - Small Hausa raft zither, woven 
reed with seeds inside the back.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts09.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts10.jpg - Larger Hausa raft zither, with a 
much deeper tone. Both instruments are plucked with both hands; both are 
somewhat old and delicate. I'll record with them, then put them aside. The 
weaving on both is amazing.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts11.jpg - 'Bass' zither, or elegie concert 
zither. This is an anomaly; it's not that well constructed and the frets 
are crude, as is the purfling around the upper soundhole and the overall 
shape.  I'm not sure of the date; the purfling seems to be Washburn-style 
so I'm assuming it's American-made, but the ornate tuner cover (nickel or 
silver-plated) seems European. It might be English. There are 23 usable 
open strings and five playing strings; I'm using an odd tuning of my own 
devising, which also keeps the instrument from further cracking. It has a 
range of about five octaves.

Planets:

Plates of Mars and Venus from Elements of Astronomy, Illustrated with 
Plates, for the use of Schools and Academies, with Questions, by John 
Wilkins, Boston, 1832. Volumes could be written about visual interpre- 
tation (including the reading of 'canals' several decades later), about 
real and virtual phenomena in relation to optical technology, and so 
forth. Apparently this is the first American book to use 'Uranus' as the 
standard name for the planet, which had, until then, been known as 
'Herschel.'

me within the lines which fragment like a particle fan.
< each particle tending towards another, splitting, vertices
and chains, tunnelings.
< and imminent breakdown of energy conservation.
< this way i forget where i was and think only of the next

if i move it won't go away

"If you don't accessorize, it never looks finished."

http://www.alansondheim.org/makeitstop.mp4

if i move it won't go away 
i can't move i have to stay very still
an old fashioned way of thinking
that it will go away

think if i were dead
that you'd have to reconstruct
from evidence distorted
making me look dead

i moved it didn't go away
but then it stopped i stopped too
it gave me gift of a chance
it didn't go away it played dead

it played dead i died
it didn't go away i'm dead


if i move it goes away

"If accessorized, it never looks finished."

http://www.alansondheim.org/windchannel.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/wontgetme.mp4

if i move it goes away 
i move i can't stay still
brand new thought
that it takes me there

think if i were there
you'd just have to look
clearly, and i'd look
alive and purely

i moved it went away
it went and i went too
so uplifting and all
it went away like life

it was born and me too
it went away i'm moving


the limits

when infinities are called for within the aegis of the digital, there are 
two possibilities: scatter-shots (sparse 'fit-points' appear in the graphs 
or calculations) and (fold)-catastrophic jumps connecting scatter-shots 
with vector lines or sheets. there are various combinations depending on 
the graphics program. the very act of exploring these monstrous objects 
through rotation, translation, magnification, etc. produces vibrant and 
often vibrating morphologies as the program attempts to adjust to the 
impossible. think of this as a dialog with spontaneous symmetry breaking 
between the analog (with infinities and the continuum) and digital (with 
discrete finite outcomes). finally think of this as a monolog of mind 
attempting to conceive the inconceivable, using finer and finer rasters, 
with similar and equally 'distanced' results no matter what.

spaceflight

simulacra, models, everything with their noise
nothing happens just alt-config repeating
over and against itself across a screen's terrain
the alt-config screen's repeating while down below
it seems spaceflight's coming to an end
on an alt-config screened island turning its last
wayward face to alt-config sun's wayward shadow's cast

[15:06] Julu Twine: instead of 92 put down sixty and see where that gets 
us - maybe it would be better
[15:12] Julu Twine: as text begins its slow descent into the unobtrusive 
mechanization of liberty and exhaustion
[15:15] Julu Twine: 3 might do the trick
[15:17] Julu Twine: or if language becomes, in actuality, a texture in 
its own write
[15:24] Julu Twine: this is the world that i know
[15:24] Julu Twine: this is the world that comes to mind, this insipid 
world and all its tawdry beings
[15:24] Julu Twine: a moment of thought and all is lost
[15:25] Julu Twine: and nothing returns, not even life and over the next 
horizon, nothing...
[15:25] Julu Twine: it's broken and broken and broken and broken, and 
comes forth as of death
[15:26] Julu Twine: a grey day....
[15:26] Julu Twine: emptied, unimaginable
[15:27] Julu Twine: or a thought collapsed
[15:27] Julu Twine: spewed out, the last sound i will ever hear...
[15:28] Julu Twine: ah ah ah, not here, not ever here!!!
[19:55] sensor: noone around.
[20:02] Julu Twine: quanta and sadness
[20:08] Julu Twine: thought loosens itself in the running of the world, 
thickness, thickness
[20:09] Julu Twine: more, there is nothing lost, intervals' perfection, i 
await you
[20:09] Julu Twine: more, there is nothing
[20:09] Julu Twine: lost intervals' perfection,
[20:10] Julu Twine: i await you
[20:10] Julu Twine: it stutters among sounds, what shudders if not bones
[20:11] Julu Twine: if not collapse, waves giving us this image
[20:12] Julu Twine: i hear you, speech of god
[20:13] Julu Twine: self-interaction becoming me
[20:14] Julu Twine: becoming my thinking
[20:14] Julu Twine: becoming my world
[20:15] Julu Twine: pulling up, pulling up
[20:16] Julu Twine: pulling, pulling up, mine and your as 
well.......................
[20:23] Julu Twine: i grant you these moments of utterance
[20:29] Julu Twine: it brings about...
[20:29] Julu Twine: coming itself together
[20:29] Julu Twine: overwrought, i listen
[20:30] Julu Twine: particles shuttle screen-wise, remaining placed
[20:30] Julu Twine: so slowly, they create
[20:31] Julu Twine: they create themselves
[20:31] Julu Twine: like song
[20:32] Julu Twine: of our singing, and ours,
[20:32] Julu Twine: and ours,
[20:33] Julu Twine: ours
[20:33] Julu Twine: beginning with its own carry
[20:33] Julu Twine: folding
[20:34] Julu Twine: folding and incomplete
[20:34] Julu Twine: and we, we
[20:34] Julu Twine: in silence
[20:35] Julu Twine: are

FIRST AND SECOND 

Maria Damon and Alan Sondheim

(We spent a day making work; there are six pieces, two sets of three.
The text-based FIRST AND SECOND and SECOND AND FIRST use ytalk and
other commands; FIRST AND SECOND follows, and SECOND AND FIRST will
follow shortly. The second set, to be posted tomorrow, uses Maria's
voice and text, and my violin/viola, and pipa. The third set, to be 
posted the following day, uses Second Life. Enjoy!)
