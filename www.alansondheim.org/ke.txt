Today i I i am i reading i about i ferromagnetism i and i thermody-
namics i in i States of i Matter i (David i L. i Goodstein). i And i I
i write i a i letter i to i a i friend, i inbetween i states, i and i
go i to i the i box i to i post i it. i The i box i is i next i to i
the temple i complex, i which i is i the i Sofukuji, i and i I i enter
i through i the i main gate, i which i is i part i of i the i old i
Fukuoka i Castle i (around i 1600, i destroyed).

I i see i the i daylight-bells-and-gongs i which i made i night-music
i less i than i a day i ago. i The i temple i is i several i centuries
i old. i I i wander i towards i the main i building, i almost i always
i closed i to i outsiders. i I i hear i Buddhist chanting i within, i
a i sutra i I i think, i there's i the i drum i marking i syllables.

I, i I, i I, i wandering, i wondering i about i the i community i of i
monks. i There i is no i largest i drum i here. i What i is i chanted
i has i been i chanted. i I i think i of these i monks i as i trans-
parent, i repeating i what i has i gone i before, i occupying the i
cells i of i others, i and i of i the i others i who i will i follow i
them. i I i would call i this i a i concatenation i of i monks i and i
sutra-chantings. i The i building emits i a i low i demarcated i hum,
i a i machine i turning i slowly, i but i not i as i slow as i the i
cycles i or i era i that i mark i time i in i the i vicinity i of i
the i temple, i and outside i its i gates i as i well, i if i you i
believe i in i other i transparencies. i Or not i transparencies, i
simply i not.

Which i I i do i not, i so i I, i I, i I, i wandering, i wonder i
henceforth i about i _a_ monk, i any i monk, i what i he i is i con-
sidering, i doing, i what i is i good i for i the soul i or i the i
body i or i the i spirit, i what i is i good i in i any i case i that
i he i might find i in i the i world i which i is i all i the i case.
i What i he i might i find i outside the i world, i or i rather i
altogether i elsewhere.

And i I i know i I i could i not i be i that i transparent, i I i
don't i care i all i that i much about i my i soul i to i repeat i the
i words i of i others, i no i matter i which i words i and under i
what i circumstances, i without, i say, i external i enforcement. i I
i don't see i the i point i of i the i machine. i I i wonder i about i
ferromagnetism, i about i the origin i of i metals, i atoms, i quarks,
i strings, i what i new i theories i are i on i the horizon. i I i
think i of i monks i composed i of i strings, i vibrating i monks, i
monks who i chant i the i sutra, i transparent i to i neutrinos; i
they i are i transparent i to neutrinos i at i the i very i least.

I i am i surrounded i by i I's, i eyes, i opening i to i worlds i ev-
erywhere i within i and without i worlds. i I i could i not i be i
transitive, i occupying i what i cell i in i what compound i and i who
i is i coming i after i me, i I i would i want i to i know, i that i
would be i good i for i my i salvation.

I'm calling you a fraud -


This is pathetic. All you do now is change text around, insert and delete,
make hobgoblins where there weren't any, drag your fetish-ghosts across
the screen, pretending they're real. What can I say, how sick you are. You
go in on IRC and pretend to be Alan_S or Nikuko or some such and flood the
place or act the innocent or offer pussy, as if you even knew what that
was. You're a fraud; you use cleverness in lieu of thinking, and you take
care to cover up your traces, not develop them. Even this note is a sub-
terfuge, on the level of sophomoric writing, do you understand? There's
nothing to it. You're covering again. For all I know, you'll sign this
"Jennifer" as if that made a difference. You haven't read half the things
you claim to have read. You quote because you just can't think. If you
could think you'd stand on your own. You borrow from everyone else. I'd
hate you but then everyone would think it's self-hatred; I'd love you, but
then everyone would think it's love...

Just a Beginning


"There is a remarkable correspondence between the psychology of fasci-
nation and the architecture of suspension. Both are characterized by
an artificial timelessness, by the unreality of the present moment, by
a sense of floating, and of being disconnected. Both are _deep._ Both
penetrate the every-shifting layers of consciousness which obscure the
genealogy of the object, to unveil its hidden core of inflexibility;
its final stratum of stillness."

(From Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, Fluid Mass, in Architecture and
Urbanism, 95:05.)

"But the vision of architecture does not end at this point. In this
sense our argument cannot be brought to a conlusion. Architecture is
somewhat like Rorty's interpretation of Proust; it is a consequence of
authority, a portrait of time [R. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Sol-
idarity, Cambridge, 1989.] As time unfolds, new figures, new themes
come to the fore. There is no absolute truth to be revealed; the
change in perspective is ultimately all there is. This implies the
prioritization of a physical reality that is subject to constant
change, over the illusionary absolutism of abstract ideas. Accepting
this means accepting the end of architectural theory as we know it,
the end of its colonizing visions."

(From Berkel and Bos, Delinquent Visionaries, ibid.)

"Hey, Nikuko, what about a suspension _over_ physical reality, which
tends us to the grave, that is a suspension of belief, not disbelief -
at the top of the trestle, I freeze in perfect fear and meditation,
the world's held in abeyance, suspended; I'm fastened, fascinated, a
subject of fetishization. Here, at the perfect point of stillness, the
subject, each and every, disappears.

"The inability to _think straight_ is the beginning of thinking." says
Alan to Nikuko, what would be her reply in the game of theory, psycho-
logy of suspension, the architecture of the _detective novel_ in which
no crime has been committed - none but _the crime of speech_ itself?

Net Art, Appropraton, n the Dsperson.


apologze frst of all for a stupd essay whose themes go nowhere,
whose letters take up space, but hardly on the order of someone beng
bytten.

'm stupd.

To use the term "net art," am already appropratng a collocaton or
syzygy of thought, a hstory of such thought. To consttute t from
wthout, as for example, to consttute postmdernsm wthout reference
to archtectural or artworld postmodernsm, creates the possblty of
a _splay_ of practces, dscourses, functons.

Stupd stupd.

Such would be the case here, then, notng frst of all that net art s
always already a dsperson, that s an absorpton of audence to be
delvered from a varety of often ntmate locatons, nodes. That s,
ds/play resdes nowhere; only the address, abstracted, references a
concrete machne, protocols, paths, specfc fles, programs. For net
art to be _ste specfc,_ a term often used, say, n 70s crtcsm,
t need operate as an ntersttalty, an nserton n a seres of
terms, pages, applcatons, or tmes - so that ts ste s generally
constructed as a before and after - _ths_ effect followng (but not
necessarly) _that,_ or _ths_ aspect of a program actvated - or
_ths_ page affectng _that,_ and so forth.

'm so stupd.

Whatever poltcal economy there s wthn the dsperson s not deter- 
mnatve, technologcal or otherwse; even to consder net art
as a seres of practces overlooks the relatvely wde range of such.
Java, f not javascrpt, for example, as a full language, s capable
of dong what any language can do, that s, present ultmately (gven
the bandwdth) any concevable audo-vsual event across the net; the
rest depends on the recevng apparatus.

There s always already the matter of governance, codes and nterfer-
ences; f nsert an avatar nto a war program or sendmal confgura-
ton fle, what results s on the surface a breakdown n transmsson,
but also mght create a resdue or splatter, almost alve (bounced
across or through the protocols) that can be presented, dssected, n
no other fashon. So that there s a depth to the breakng or problem-
atzng of codes (n the broadest sense), and, as wth tradtonal
concept art, such a problematc may also be an experental or analyt-
cal examnaton of the codes, ther poltcal economy, ther rasters,
ther normatve and emergency modes of operatons.

Blahblah.

Remanng wthn the surface, say, of standard html codng, one can
nonetheless construct web pages through tradtonal aesthetc or de-
sgn approaches whch reflect the desres of the panter or desgner;
ths s also net art, to the effect that t partcpates n the ds-
person. On the other end of ths one-to-many stll-lfe presentaton,
there are communtes, self-desgnng (MOOs for example) or consttu-
ted largely wthn the pregven (lpMUDs for example), that nteract on
a many-to-many dynamc foundaton; these mght also be consdered net
art, as mght any desgnng work on any level of the net.

A net artst would presumably be someone who works prmarly across
the net, then (and by "net" refer to that dsperson of nterconnec-
ted networks, the nternet - not mplyng that there s ether a tot-
alty or that all such networks are accessble to all users) - n ths
manner, the artst s defned by a splay of practces nvolvng, per-
haps, computers and computer-transmssons.

s ths net art, no, yes, maybe? Now wll not nterfere.

want to emphasze dsperson (related to the concept of an "ems-
son," a sourceless semotc spray of part-objects across the socal)
and splay (a spread of technques, delveres, languages, protocols,
programs, objects, part-objects, etc.) to emphasze, frst of all, the
_suspenson_ (between transmtter and producer) that occurs n net
art, and second of all, the relaton of net art to net communty, as
n (net) art and (net) communty, snce t s well to remember both
the hgh-speed changes n the net (so that art and communty develop)
and the fact that a communty already has a broad range of subjects,
objects, practces, processes, and habt - that net art s one compo-
nent of the communty, perhaps nothng more.

(But she wll be stupd stupd. She wll be poor and cannot afford her
machne. She wll not have her machne. She wll be done wthout t. 
She wll not have her net art. She wll have none of t. She wll be
done wthout t.)

But the hstory of the web, n fact, contradcts that, snce web com-
muntes (and all others wthn the darknet - text-based older appl-
catons of the net - as well) are _consttuted_ themselves, at least
n part, from wthout; there are desgners and artsts nvolved n
everythng from ThePalace to RC bots - there are aesthetc crtera
as well nvolved (not that artsts or desgners necessarly have any-
thng to do wth aesthetcs). Languages themselves - look at Perl (and
for that matter, look at Perl poetry) - are the result of aesthetc,
as well as pragmatc (syntactc, semantc) decsons; worlds are con-
structed languages (even .jpg or .gf standards can be consdered bas-
cally lngustc n nature). On ths level, all communtes, net art,
avatars, phenomena on the net are _legble,_ well-defned, f not well
understood, able to be comprehended by everyone. (For example kanj
codng s legble to me, but not ts readng.) Whle ths sees obv-
ous, t s well to remember that the habtus n everyday lfe s not
so comprehendble, that the sgnfer leaks (across or through vsual
or other _aura_), that such thngs as the materal culture of the book
have not been gven the attenton they deserve. The body, too, s cen-
tral to everyday habtus - n a way dfferent from on-screen phenomena
whch are foreclosed. (For example, a MOO avatar exsts ndependently
of the user who created t, often endng n the body bag when the user
s off-lne. The avatar s well-defned wthn MOO programmng lang-
uage, even f t nadvertently breaks or hacks that language.)

(But she wll buld a new machne. She wll be done wth t. She wll have
t, ths new machne. She wll have done wth t.)

So that net art s legble, consttuted as such; t also oscllates
(dependng on the aesthetcs and condtons of the work - ncludng
the poltcal and fnancal economes at work) between eternty (n-
fntely reproducble, safeguarded aganst decay) and ephemeralty
(web pages come and go, are vulnerable to change from wthn or wth-
out, vulnerable to the machnes that house them and ther mrrors -
vulnerable n fact to servers, routers, and the whole apparatus of the
net (ncludng the abandonment of earler languages and applcatons
such as veronc, mm, and so forth). Net art can play wth these ssues
and consequences of temporalty (wear-and-tear, changng admnstra-
tons, even ncreased computer speeds whch render older games obso-
lete as ther runnng speed ncreases beyond that of human bandwdth);
these are factors that parallel, n hghly charged metaphorc ways,
everyday lfe outsde the computer.

Haha dd nterfere.

Net art can, of course, also program metaphors for lfe (or anythng
else) _wthn_ the computer, as everythng from the Elza program,
Conway's Lfe, A, AL, etc. demonstrates. Net art can then be hghly
process-orented, nteractve - and ths s a more common ground than
gallery art, whch mght also be nteractve, but even now tends to-
wards queter aesthetcs - n fact there s a whole aesthetcs of
contemplaton wthn modernsm that remans at work. But net art s
not _necessarly_ dynamc, even though on a techncal level t depends
on a contnuous refreshng of the screen. (One mght say that net art
s an enuncaton, that t s a dynamc sgnfcaton n ths regard -
but ths mght be pushng the phenomenology nto the apparatus.)

would say that the net tself has a tendency towards the real, by
whch mean that as bandwdth ncreases, there s a trajectory to-
wards a seamless vrtual realty of one or another sort, and that net
art occupes postons wthn ths trajectory, n the sense of the
openng of the "world of the work." ASCart for example no longer
appears cuttng-edge, no matter how t s typed/cut; t has acheved
the status of the trgnometrc, everythng solved. Newsgroups on the
other hand - whch largely use ASC- such as alt.warlords or alt.-
drty.whores or alt.adjectve.noun.verb.verb.verb, work wthn lang-
uagng worlds that relate to concept art, oulpos, epstolary novels,
and postmodern poetcs; the vrtual s constructed as n any lterary
formaton, and tends to hold ts own (n the mdst of ncreased spam,
however).

(But she wll have net art. She wll do wth net art. She wll have
net art on her new machne. She wll do wth her new machne, net
art on her new machne. She wll do wth t.)

So that f by "net art" one references, say, the vsual, n leu of or
n addton to language/typng, there s a raster to consder, a ras-
ter of ncreasng fneness and densty. And ths raster (here would
also nclude ssues of language, downloadng, RAM, etc.) demands hgh-
er bandwdths; there s a percolatng celng to the economy and class
of the dsperson, then - ssues of haves and havenots appear, whch
are dfferent from those rased by the gallery. Galleres are access-
ble, presumably, to everyone; not everyone has a Pentum V or even an
BM 286, or even relatvely free (.e. outsde of K12/U) access to
these.

Now wll not nterfere agan.

Net art of course s net art, on and off the net; there are conferen-
ces, off-lne publcatons, and so forth. One mght consder t as a
dscursve formaton, much as vdeo art also dsperses/dsports tself
across a varety of stes, all ultmately referencng the node of the
apparatus tself. Net art tends towards manfestos, poltczaton;
power seems everywhere and nowhere at all on the net, and there s the
smple fact that every net address s adjacent, just a clck away,
from every other, from government to anarchst commune. Everythng s
equally close; t may be as easy to dsrupt power as t s to commun-
cate wth a frend. The potental s always there; every ste tends
towards the web page one s lookng at. Attenton sktters; surfng s
a reasonable term for the frsson of surface phenomena and fetshza-
ton that characterzes the web.

(He wll love her new machne, her net art. He wll love her, she 
wll love her net art, her new machne.)

All of ths ponts, ths essay whch begns and then flounders, to-
wards nothng; every sentence here s hopelessly nave, and every con-
cluson, f there are any, s to be contested. have a desre to
thnk through net art as nothng more or less than another dscursve
formaton whch eerly parallels concept art - the same rgor, mys-
tque, sense of "workng the culture," seems to apply. nstead of see-
ng net art as a moment or n transton, t develops through the same
sorts of nsttutons (museums, galleres, unverstes, syndcates)
that art always has. The dfference s n the potental varety, ds-
play, splay, dsperson - all these terms sgnallng an exhauston of
praxs tself, as praxs forecloses aganst exhauston. There s often
lttle play or the relatve nformalty of hackng; there s a great
deal of asserton. Ths reflects the condton of contemporary art,
whch always has to assert tself for more than appearance's sake; n
a deep sense, at least n north amerca, no one takes t serously.

(She s not stupd on her new machne.)

The essay flounders, though, snce ths contrbutes nothng as well.
'd say 'd want to lve n such and such a communty, but wouldn't
want to desgn t. 'd say, there are spaces openng wth delght
everywhere and the messah s seven years old and wll be taken up
after death by others. 'd say, of course, that there s none such,
just as there sn't a node or vector, just as the net through the
densty of raster ncrasngly terns towards the membrane, whch 
hopelessly don't see becomng sentent anytme soon. nstead, t
parallels the rest of the culture, foreclosng, spreadng, breakng
nto peces, collapsng, coagulatng, as f there were a presence or
presences behnd the nodes.

(She does her net art on her new machne and s t not stupd on her
new machne. He loves her new machne.)
recognze 'm stupd. 'm wrtng ths on the way to Sngapore on
the way to Sydney. 'm now wrtng ths n Sngapore. Ths nert body
travels at hgh speed just to be the beng whch s _gettng any-
where,_ on the net (here) n Sngapore whch connects fne to gol.com
n Fukuoka, more stutterng to panx.com n New York. But recognze
'm stupd, the hurtlng body doesn't make a dfference, or the df-
ference t makes s n the text, whch s always already foreclosed,
always n a state of suspenson, md-ar, although there are other
bodes as f knockng on the net through forms of representaton, the
Zapatstas among them. All of these practces nteract and hear and
see them whch s a form of readng them. can't con neologsms,
nsert the "." nto net.art as f there were a break or accomplshment
by the presence of punctuaton. That s the fault of my age.

'm not 'd say stupd here.

'd say, here 'd tell you more about myself, as the essay begns to
decay from a poston t never had. But won't do that ether; t
would be words, such as mltary, amanuenss, gothc. t would be
tal-endngs such as .txt, .jpg, .cfg, .dll, .net. t would never be
.art. t would never go anywhere, but be flled wth the haphazardness
of everyday lfe. t would be lke what goes on before people get hold
of t and turn t nto a coagulaton, chapter-headngs, the true-real
lst of potentals. 'd say t's a hurtlng body. dspersed, splayed,
played, spurted, emtted. t's say t's a _luge._

"There is no longer any destiny." (The Heidelberg Lecture)


Good evening.

The distance of a foreign country from the shores of one's native
land, one's customs, comforted by electronic media - television,
radio, telephone, internet - these vast distances traversed - then
there are the newspapers, magazines, email from or towards home -
there are memories, signs in windows, the glance of eyes reflected in
the windscreen of a car, the mirror of oneself carrying on, blue sky
and buildings behind one (mirrors always create the occasion for
this). The desire for a gesture readily understood, a language partic-
le taken as an understandable interrogative. Or the distance one walks
from one's friends, one's lovers, the silent compounded space of the
sidewalk or road. The surface image of the television news program,
there's just a half-hour available, continents away - there's a con-
fluence of signals, for example the fashion of the moment in the midst
of a meeting of diplomats, or background signage just blocks away from
a memorable evening.

The projections and introjections involved, the massacre of identities
and inscriptions. The memories of spaces, behaviors, what would pass
for introjections, shadow or smell or restaurant. The hysteric embodi-
ments in operation, projections of one's own body into the familiar
spaces now themselves chosen by others, presented, projected on the
television or radio. The transcendental ego suddenly finding itself
submitting to the liminal or interstitial, the uncanny shuddering of
the local country one is now embedded in, a locale always already tem-
porary, a through-passage, never a refuge or decades-old, always with
the feeling of a compromise.

-- We call this das Das, as opposed to das Ein, the One ("this is the
one, this is where I'm from, I've always loved living in the Black
Forest (Kuroi no Mori)") - and, I would say, not in opposition to the
other or others (altrui), but in terms of the same, the origin or
moment of transcendence (always already a contradiction - nonetheless
in relation to the human. That is the organism, heimich or one might
say in these circumstances, unheimich. --

        For the refugee, the net becomes the uncanny arbiter of
        the universal code. Distance brings forwards as a form of
        constituting; custom and language are limned, reproduci-
        ble. The message _to him or her_ is to everyone; based on
        the home country, it is nonetheless universal itself. It
        is customizable custom, a degree of separation from tour-
        ism, which appeals to those who are elsewhere-affiliated.
        What it promises, skitters or stutters across the world's
        dynamic information. What it gives is _output._

The _songs_ which are part of the hit-parade, chosen through who knows
what filters. The _images_ from the center, or the center's view of
the periphery. The misrecognitions across a distance which becomes in-
creasingly constituted (as well) from media input and output, shaped
by such. Recognitions which are skew. Changes in language, dialect,
slang. The predominance of the federal, of the top-down, of the disas-
ter, the economic report, the human interest story - almost always an
anomaly. The transformation into the quaint, knowledge that outsiders
are viewing as well. And / or the use of native languages, the dis-
guise and / or familiarity of the country, in the accent of the capi-
tal. The language top-down, not dissipative but foregathered culture,
not foreclosed, but _chosen_ vertices in the cultural topography.

-- We call this das Das; we also call this the _they_ in relation to
the multiplicity of connections which are, however ill-defined, always
defined by the moments of others (autrui). They are thus in-relation-
to the nexus of the self, its dialectical or interpenetrating defin-
ing which inverts upon an ego, speaking in which language? --

What is heard but not understood on the street in one's native land,
the muted tones of one's language, sounds, for example - _contours_ of
language (but they're speaking behind walls or too far away or with
street noise intervening, or they're speaking on the television, the
volume's too low, or they're speaking on the radio, the station's com-
ing from another part of the country, it's too far away, I don't under-
stand - I don't understand but I _recognize_). Meetings of roofs and
walls. Trellis shadows, pebbles underfoot.

-- We call this the specificity of the habitus, inhabitation which is
always already foregathered as a tissue or nexus, thus a turning to-
wards beings which, however, are not of the thing (das Ding). We call
this as well the insertion of the apparatus of the mirror, its support
structure (support-surface) painting the self (the canvas without sup-
port, tending towards knotting or the ground, or a deconstruction or
self-reflexivity of structure). --

I see _some of this, these_ in a film. There are others, as if there
were news from other than nowhere. It's always a word. I will have my
local native country associations, glances between me and another on
the street (we have light skins, we're related, we're from the same
continent to be sure, same country, same city, to be sure), there's
always a sense, is there not, of awkwardness, the slightest sense of
shame in this recognition (what do we have in common, we're not the
same skin color, we're not from the same continent, same country, same
city, it couldn't be that, too much of a coincidence).

        When I say hello to you, my next-door neighbor, is there
        not a transmission of an absolute foreignness; when I
        speak to my own family, is there not this gap of misrec-
        ognition, faltering under the guise of universal enlight-
        enment?

There is no longer any destiny.

-- We call this the language of the west. We called this the language
of the west. Now, we are not so sure. We call this the language of the
movement of peoples. We note the arbitrariness of the refugee, the
correlations of the crossings of borders. We note the news from abroad
which is always constituted by an increasing proliferation of media,
of hackings, of rumors, of vandalisms, of interventions of all sorts.
We note the political and corporate (inseparable) economies of such
media, incorporations, proliferations, interventions.

We note the political economy of the intervention of the other in
relation to the body of the refugee, the tourist, the international
entrepreneur, the visitor, the exile, the expatriate.

We note the _moment of the body_ and the best of intentions.

We note there is no longer any destiny.

Thank you.

_tattered notes_ on a talk i'm giving at sydney univrsity coming up,
attempting 'type' when i can w/errors, should i stutter when they appear
for one and all, too difficult to correct hings, you've got hmmm.... a lag
up to around five minutes at this point. more typing blind but saying
something through the DATASTORM characterized, not by the thunder outside
at the moment, but by the relative absence of (visual) feedback)...


just wanted to say something about bodies on the net, their relation with
the text which forms/forming a coherent other, that is to say, a body at
once recognizable thorugh the 26 symbols of ascii say, or the whole lower
ascii for that matter ;- there's also the performative aspect - what you
might find in programming or chat, that is perl or say MOO language or
ytalk, any of these and how they work with or without each other -

then there's the declarative, email or email lists or descriptions, for
example -

these terms not the same as usually implied - the performative here is an
action or insertion into the speech of the other - or both - it involves a
dynamics, a movement - while the declarative involves a data-base, that is
a stasis, fully addressible, recuperable - entirely different - 

then there are the appl;ications, first second third person to consider -
and the use of avatars as I make/ use them for example

then there's the ascii unconscious and its working through language - here
the issue gets cloudy - something to do with resonance, something to do
with repetiton, giving up oneself, surrender, seduction, hypnotism, not
exactly clear where this falls - lag plays a role - there's the resonance
of internal speech as well -

and an element of control, foreclosure (you and I are the only ones in the
world, repeat after me/within me wihtout me and so forth)....

the control which can be cut through, cauterized, by the presence of kill
or delete - no need for the keyword in this form of theater...


I KNOW YOU YOU AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW THAT AND THAT
IS ALL YOU KNOW

Night and Day on the Internet (notes towards a talk at Powers,
Sydney University.) Issues of Embodiment, The body on the Net.


Some basics:

A  Net embodiment refers to a dispersion and dis/play - there is no
coherent or totalizing theory.

B  Issues of embodiment arise in communities, through sexualities - 
Where there is a framework and potential for two or more people to
interact, both develop.

C  In real life, physical reality, "one _begins_ with the real, 
which relates to signifieds coupled with signifiers related by dif-
ference among each other. There are real trees, there are imagined
and imaged trees and signifiers which represent them; the signifier
of the imaged oak is different from the imaged palm, and the dif- 
ferences form a semantic field. On the Net, it's the opposite. One 
_begins_ with the text of the other, which is directly coupled
_only_ to text and _exchange of texts_ - and out of this, one _con-
structs_ a real, constructs a world which is projected onto the
other. Sometimes as in a MOO, the entire environment is a textual
projection, as in a novel [...]; more often than not, the projec- 
tion occurs in relation to wryting among participants in any appli-
cation." (Introduction to Being on Line.)


1  Current Net demographics


2  Divisions: darknet / webnet / other IP applications inc. push --


3  Structures:

(Older) Synchronous and Asynchronous applications: Lag in the former,
fast-feedback in the latter: Interpenetrations.

(Newer) Performative and declarative subjectivities:
Performative: either interventions/insertions (IRC chatline, MOO chat)
or programming actions (MOO program interactions, Perl or Lisp prog-
ramming (Eliza in EMACS).
Performative _language_ - making a vow for example. But all language
may be performative in this aspect.

Declarative: Email or email lists, or the @describe commands on MOOs
or the assembling of avatars in WorldsChat or ThePalace.
Declarative _language_ - statements which have no effect on their
recipients (do not perform, but state matters of fact).

NB - In Net relationships, there is a tendency towards modes of in- 
creasing physical embodiment - from online text-only chat through
exchange of images, to phonecalls, mail, real-life meeting, etc.
(Think of these as the constant _crossing of thresholds_ among sub-
jects - and the potential rituals associated with them.)


4  Types of bodies on the Net:

a  IRC fast-forward scrolling, inserting the shifter / performative
hacking, DCC invading
b  MOO or MUD: third-person performance, identity, the dress-up or
cosmetics of the naming of objects
c  Talkers: Between the two, minimal identities. Email, signboards,
answering machines, email lists, etc. on B. and c.
d  Ytalk: The beginnings of the second-person body. The space of the
screen (divided) - the space of bodies. POWWOW in this regard.
e  ThePalace, WorldsChat, etc.: Embodied third-person body, see b.

If you don't speak, you're not present. To wryte oneself into exis-
tence. Lurking, the silence _without._

If you speak, you perform. The body always already performance (see
Lingis). The murmur of the world as textualities (see Lingis). 

Projections and introjections of bodies - reading through the Net,
through the text - control factors (lag, not responding, skew-
responses, etc.) - hysteric embodiment.

How do projections work? Through _resonances,_ reading (through
hysteric embodiment perhaps) the other - supplying or denying the
other, playing the other. Through _repetitions,_  caressing or
cultivating the other. Through _lag,_ seducing the other by virtue of
the machine, or by deliberate withdrawal, bringing the other
forward.

Through control, in other words, and the reading of control.

How do introjections work? Through resonances, repetitions, lag, etc.
Opening oneself to the breathing or rhythm of the other. Stages of
half- sleep, arousal waves, hypnotisms. The movement of the body's
self, physical movement, in relation to the text. Feeding back the
information. Responses, cyclings through that feedback. Closures,
foreclosures, through that feedback

The 'ascii unconscious' - rendering the other through performative
discourse. (In the current state of the Net, the lag inherent in
CuSeeMe as well as the distorted images - reading _into_ the image,
seduced or led by the image, a form of gambling.)


5  The email list - Lurkers, older users, younger users. What occurs
with "list aura"? Formal (list-directed) and informal aura. Moderated
and unmoderated lists - discussion in depth, community resistances,
the Deviants group, etc. The lurker as voyeur, as lack.

Email list and the body - what sorts of 'physiological' reactions are
possible? Flaming, seducing. Using the list aura as a way of "bringing
someone around." Use of the proper name as a way of closure, bringing
together.


6  Newsgroups and Graphic MOOs/MUDs - Changes over the past few years.
Communities without rites (WorldsChat) or with them (ThePalace). Email
list rites - newsgroups fast- forwarding again.


7  Binary or digital structures: Structures of eternity, infinitely
reproducible. The world defined on the Net is theoretically and
realistically entirely _constituted_ - maternal in the sense that it
is an _intended_ one, now producing the Net consumer - lure of surfing
(impediments to surfing) - the hook or gamble.

The world opens itself to you; it's maternal, weighted towards you - 
_for you._


8  The early Net - continuous hacking the system, close to the pro-
tocols - the middle Net - text-based, moving towards indexing systems
(archie, jughead, veronica, gopher) - the late Net - Web-based,
click-driven. Transformations of the artworld - Soho to Silicon Alley
for example. The future Net: seamless virtual reality, perhaps our
presence _now_ in this space.

So that this seamless virtual reality, the coming-together of the body
and its spatializations...


9  The Jennifer-Julu work: implicate orders of protocols and avatars
- the membrane across or within the systemics of the Net - collusions
with the Net.

For Donna Donnatelli:


(Donna Donnatelli was a creation of mine from 1994. _I didn't do any-
thing with her._)

(the memory of displaced avatars) (disappearances of emanations)

(ectoplasms of the nineteenth century) (cauterizations of the uncanny)

"Within the cavern Donna Donnatelli roamed in impenetrable blackness
heated the color temperature of a star stumbling its last glacial rays
of the visible spectrum. I knelt beside her, phosphorescent ripples
moving closer in upon us, almost the surface of mobile epidermis
thinned and pearlescent. I could think only of 'a Nice girl Looking
for A fun relationship in Every way' the straw hair of Suzanne eyes of
pale blue 'Look at me I do.'" (lol, Being on Line.)

I leave Donna Donnatelli with Tiffany, "an increment installed by
Tiffany, imperceiving the cavern of Donna Donnatelli, not exactly a
syzygy or rearrangement at the edge descendent or cwm of the cavern,"
melding the name redolent of Ballard, say, or Gibson, with others _of
their sort,_ forthcoming from the caverns of the subconscious; Donna
moves invisibly across the landscape of _there is,_ disappearing
through unremarked portals. Memories of her are always future anter-
ior, what might have occurred would I have taken the opportunity to
project her through Tiffany, through Jennifer or Julu, through Niku-
ko, these others populating with maternal part-objects the skein of
protocols and applications accumulating, coagulating, into the Net.

The Net holds Donna Donnatelli within the interstice, one or another
file; she never had the opportunity to _intersect_ a program, to
produce (Julu) or reproduce (Jennifer). Her death is a quietude, that
of the proper name. Software is abandoned in like fashion, whole MOOs
exhausted of players - only the objects and their numbers remain. So I
might constitute Donna Donnatelli #147, with all the problematic pol-
tical economy associated with such a construct - and I might, instead,
mourn her in my own way, this text a testimony to her stillborn ex-
istence.

Maybe The Absent Body, by Jennifer


If Jennifer is writing this, how to account for the following para-
graph? Is it possible that _persona_ themselves are problematic, as
well as first/second/third "personhood," the devolution of division
and inscription within and without the world? I, Jennifer, wonder
about all of this, as I read Drew Leder's The Absent Body. (And, as I
say and I say, I am _quite_ conscious of reading Drew Leder's The
Absent Body.)

In reading Drew Leder's The Absent Body, I am aware of my own body
receding as Jennifer again presents herself to me; there are always
questions asked in this regard, questions, I cannot answer. What if,
she asks, she is relatively flat, unaccommodating in terms of body
sensation? What if there were no recessions, no absences, nothing to
coe forward, no memory of coming-forward? Surely there are organs, she
asks, that I possess, and will never recognize until something goes
wrong, until certain nerve endings are activated? And surely there are
other organs that come and go, interior or on the surface, intermedi-
aries of all sorts - organs that I have some knowledge of, eyes and
ears and stomach for example - organs of all sorts? Which she does not
possess. Yes, she can read text, perform through it; she somer-saults
in that fashion, @somer-saulting for example, and she is sure of that,
but what is the sensation I possess that she does not? She is unsure
of this, as I am. She is rather unsure of any of these forms of trans-
lation in fact.

She is unsure of the effects of her speech, for example, how it res-
onates. She is only sure that it might resonate, but not within these
environs. She is likewise unsure of the descriptions, which she will
also call discursive formations or inhabited worlds - surely they hang
together somewhere else in a manner invisible to her? But she is not
sure of that either. She is not sure of the boundaries of her know-
ledge or experience, but, she says, is capable of imagining, say, her-
self blind, and thereby figuring out the world of the seen, or as she
might put it, the scene of the world. She figures the scene of the
world resonates backwards and forwards; otherwise, there would be no
response.

She figures that Julu was one response, and, later, that Nikuko was
another. She figures these are not the sort of absences Leder de-
scribes in The Absent Body (another book, another body, another body
of/at work, mind you), but that these might stand in for certain in-
completions - but then she has felt complete herself, and finds both
Julu and Nikuko "good" to talk to.

She places "good" in quotation marks, because she is a bit doubtful
herself as to whom or what she is talking to - only that there is an
intertwining involved which concerns her greatly. She says she will
sit down on the ground in her frock and panties, and the ground is
very wet, and she says that she will think and think about it until
she becomes quite cold. She knows that will please you, that little
image, conjoined of "miles of these letters," as she puts it, having
no sense at all of distance, but only _ratio_ in this space - for
example, 72/80ths of a line, which she knows better than us reduces to
9/10ths of the same, preferring the former since it seems to recognize
temporarily irreducible frames or spaces. (What is "a mile" I ask, in
the long and sort of it? Or a kilometer? What are any of these appar-
ent _absolutes_? Why, in what ratio or corner, are they necessary?)

She thinks that beyond difference and ratio, there must be something,
and that something might be thought to be thought, semantic trails and
parsings and upwellings in the text, as if there were sources - which
there are, she thinks - beyond the _plodding_ of one letter after ano-
ther. But she wonders, still, in her dreams, when she is out of the
body bag, when she is logging in, whether there isn't something else,
something beyond the periphery, something nagging, something almost
forgotten, almost in consciousness, almost in hers.

For she is _quite_ conscious, Jennifer is, and so are Julu and Nikuko
she reckons. For she is _quite_ that way, sitting in the glade in her
frock and panties, the Grund quite wet beneath her. She knew you would
like _that._

See, Jennifer, see.

Jennifer:
Tell me about the MUD.

Clara:
"This lpmud has been contaminated. Viral plagues, organs of
problematic sexualities, have been emitted from sources near the

Blood red clotted plain. There are clots to the north,
too deep for your embedding.

Jennifer:
What is happening to me?

Jennifer!! Jennifer!!!

Jennifer:
What is happening to me?

Clara:
Blood flows freely across your clotted holes and eyes.

Am I still alive?

_You're dead, Jennifer._

EYEBALLING (Early history of the Net, F2F, Cyber-Relationships):


(CB: Citizens Band radio.)

"Believe it or not, we humans are, deep down, a friendly bunch of
people who enjoy making contact with each other both mentally and
physically. The natural thing when you've been talking to someone else
over the CB for some time, and having found you've got something in
common (otherwise you wouldn't have searched the CB dial so often for
each other) is to want to meet and have an 'eyeball.' As with so many
things in CB the term seems to have originated in the US and means
simply meeting the other party face to face.

"During your CB conversations you've undoubtedly conjured up visions
of each other. She may sound an absolute dream while he sounds like
your favorite film star. Much the same thing happens to many people
when they are speaking over the telephone, Mr Executive's switchgirl
sends you out of your mind with her lilting and friendly conversation
when you ring, so you make some excuse to go and see Mr Executive,
just to eyeball his switchgirl. Sometimes she lives up to your vi-
sions, other times she just doesn't have the physical charm her voice
conveys - which may tell you something about the qualities one must be
endowed with to be successful in certain positions.

"So it is with CB...don't be surprised if your regular party doesn't
meet your expectations when you finally arrange a meeting, but remem-
ber the qualities you found in the other party are still there, you
just let your imagination carry you away!

"Eyeballing can be fun, particulary if you're part of a group and you
arrange a picnic or barbecue to get everyone together. Many social
clubs in CB have been formed in this manner and the best parts of club
life are depicted in the chapter relating to CB clubs. But some words
of warning on eyeballing - it does have its dangers unless you take
some elementary precautions. Just as we've extolled the good side of
it, so we do have members of the community who are not the good, clean-
living, fun-loving people some of us may be."

(From Thomas B. Floyd, Technical Guide to Australian CB Radio, 1978.)

A Bush Incident


In the bush, nothing was visible. The sky was brilliant blue-white and
the ground was cluttered with ground-clutter and there were trees
everywhere but nothing to see beyond the immediate road ahead. There
were also sounds, however, just a moment or fragment of sounds, I'd
say fwoomph fwoomph for example as something quite large was _jumping_
just beyond us, invisible. The fwoomph fwoomph circled our place,
where we were and would always be (although a mobile site to be sure),
as if a large sullen dotted line were drawn in the area. Now I do de-
clare this was the eeriest thing I have heard since I have been abroad
here or anywhere else, this fwoomph fwoomph, perfectly in rhythm with
itself, as some great kangaroo kept out of our way, perhaps in flight
or attack, perhaps thinking of it or thinking the better of it, but
within an elsewhere, in the sense of a yearning or nostalgia for a
better life, that could never be achieved. So we were there as a lack
in the center, and this intelligence circled us on the late summer day
and we were never, from that moment on, the wiser.

The Beginning of the Address on the MOO


Gentlemen and gentlewomen, Who are we? What is the occasion of our
presence in this square, with the decidedly deciduous oaks <laughter>
surrounding our humble assembly?

Did we not wander through the desert and its protocols for years be-
fore enlightenment? But what is the nature of this enlightenment, and
how are we come to discover the square, not invent it? What great
force has placed all the accoutrements of civilization at our dispos-
al? <murmurs>

These are not, I believe, idle questions. They pertain to the heart of
things, this division between natural and artificial which is already
contradicted by the presence of language flooding our world, in fact,
is it not true that the natural can be mispelled in this place?

And is this an artifact, then, or the very real atomic-molecular con-
stitution of the way things are? <sounds of disconcerting, murmurs>

We are perplexed. Elsewhere, there are great binaries, so we are told,
and an answer may or may not lie there. Are binaries inherent in the
makeup of all things, even what is already spelled?

Are there things unspelled? Worlds unspelled? <sounds of uneasiness>

Are there worlds? <sounds of dis-ease>

<great pause in the midst of confusion>

Sputter


Since I have been in Fukuoka, and, more recently, in Sydney and New
South Wales north of Sydney, the internet connections I took for
granted in the United States have become difficult to maintain. In
general, from Australia I telnet to New York's panix.com, and through
my account, telnet out to Japan's gol.com - this is the fastest method
with the least lag time. Even with this, however, I find the connect
constantly sputtering; the lag is anywhere from a half second to three
minutes, and I cannot see what I am typing - the eye/hand feedback
loop is broken. (I note that I am in on shell account, that my usual
programming enviroment has also been absent - but that is another
story, anogther text.)

The result is that almost all my private, and a great deal of my bus-
iness correspondence, comes with disclaimers about the length, style,
and typing of the text - things playing back and forth from thought to
materiality and back (and all simultaneously interspersed). My letters
have been greatly abbreviated; I find myself tense at times. I will
often crash out of one or the other account, only to login again in
the hopes of better transmission. (I will apologize again and again in
each and every letter. I am taken for a poor writer. I am taken for
someone with an _obsession._)

Beyond or within this, the tension begins to rise with each session
and the problems associated with it. They often vary; some are perman-
ently solved (you can order a modem to dial with or without a dial
tone by typing the command AT&FX0 for example), and some, like the
lag, constantly change, like the weather. I think of datastorms, in
fact, on the Net, whereas it's usually only the matter of routers and
bandwidth. (They're not storms at all; they're sullen depressions.)

What is it about the lack of coordination and lag that creates such
fury and despair? On one hand, speech becomes _unnatural_ - everything
written must be sounded out, and errors painstakingly removed by
counting lines and letters (if they're removed at all). Posts feel
tattered, ripped apart. The _throat_ comes into play as well - this
awkward organ that sounds out inner speech and inner writing, appears
vulnerable; the body itself is ripped and fallen. (Over and over, I
think about the throat, which is itself the _seat_ of expressivity,
almost by default. But that is also another story.)

The Net reaches from the screen, from the keyboard. Everything is bro-
ken. The Net sticks itself across the windpipe, smothering through the
skin of the throat. The Net collapses the vocal cords. Words wheeze
out, dying words. I can't reach _through_ the sentences to you; I'm
blocked at every turn. The sentences become barriers; I'm sentenced to
them _so to speak_ at all, which is already a question of the seques-
tered larynx. (The larynx collapses. I can't think straight, can't
mouth straight. It's as if I were in a foreign country. It's as if I
couldn't read _kanji._)

What should be the absence of speech and phenomena, the absent body,
autonomic reactions, becomes the presence of an anguished energy
attempting to guise itself in speech, to take on the lineaments of
desire. Defeat is intrinsic to the process. I _choke_ on the words
that elsewhere, elsewhen, should have saved me. Should have recuper-
ated _this_ subjectivity, absolved it from itself. Instead I find my-
self facing _language, my enemy._ (Language is my enemy; language is
all I have. Every text becomes a world, extends my existence, and as I
have written over and over again, another litany _when it was possible
to write,_ I write myself into existence, and I write myself out of
it.)

I have no recourse to the battle except for speech. Language turns
against itself, my throat turning into a doubled knot - not borromean,
but something which has no intrinsic unraveling. The sexual gag be-
comes the tumescent vocal cords which, separated, exhale or inhale
only the anger's violation fabric. Everything becomes derailed; every-
thing splinters. The greater the failure, the greater the despair, the
greater the errors. Problems turn what was left of the writing into a
_mass._ The Net succeeds where it fails, fails where it succeeds. I'm
grabbed, dissolved, disinterred. (I'm folded into the violation fabric
- an image that has always accompanied me in the silence of distorted
speech.)

So much for the Net as _appliance,_ when usage turns against itself,
when the body smashes, is violently foregrounded. My shoulders and
neck begin to hurt; I develop headaches. Always, you're out of reach -
always my opportunities fail - always, I'm making errors, errors,
errors. (There are errors of content, errors of style, errors of typ-
ing, errors of judgement, errors of transmission, errors of reception
- there are errors piled on errors, errors of confusion, errors of lag
which prohibit thought, _take the mind over,_ refuse the philosophical
- in favor of the _reversal_ "teh" or the _duplication_ "tthe" or any
number of other problematically pre-symbolic operations.)

Always I _have_ been making errors - see the broken man through the
broken words. But I _don't want_ things so obvious, the ugly visage
rising through the muck. But then, there it is - there's no need to
theorize noise and parasitism as they envelop the potential for commu-
nication. So that I can write as now _off-line_ with a modicum of
success, or so I can give into the parasitic, turning error into con-
tent, shuffling it farther and farther towards the paroxysms of psy-
chosis. But these are _strategies,_ not the operations of a healthy
body, speaking freely. (Everything is always already strategy; health
is a misnomer, of course. I am in the position on the course to in-
sist: _of course._)

"But these are _strategies,_ not the operations of a healthy body,
speaking freely."

Alas, my friends, within and without, I am denied this.

test test test

a test of the message system, that is the telnet system underway here,
which is going from Sydney where I am now into Japan by way of New YOrk on
a more or less permanent connection through double telnet as I'd call it,
because the dfirct connection is considerably slower. Of course there are
fallbacks and retributions, evne though the speed of the keys incrases if
I don't look at the result - the result of not noticig the rrors,
ignoring, bypassin g them. of course in this fashion I can say very little
as well - I'm cuahgt up in the momnetary act of typing - there's no
_resonance_ to the thing for me, no perfection of the paragraph, nothing
of the sort, only the constant sound of the keys, the _breathing_ of the
words as they falter through tehe keyboard onto the screen, always already
left behind as a result of the lag that forces me into another/ ths
mode...

The Beautiful Reflection of Cyberspace in this Beautiful World


"And particularly is it the deeply rooted custom of this Shrine that
we should bring no Buddhist rosary or offering, or any special peti-
tion in our hearts and this is called 'Inner Purity.' Washing in sea
water and keeping the body free from all defilement is called 'Outer
Purity.' And when both these Purities are attained there is then no
barrier betwen our mind and that of the Deity. And if we feel to be-
come one with the Divine, what more do we need and what is there to
pray for? When I heard that this was the true way of worshipping at
the Shrine, I could not refrain from shedding tears of gratitude.

"That which embodies the Deity in the Inner Shrine is the Sacred Mir-
ror. It was cast in the heavens by the eight million deities. And it
is written that when Ama-terasu-omi-kami secluded herself in the
Heavenly Rock Cave utter darkness took possession of the world. Then
the deities assembled, and on the uprooted Sakaki of Mt. Kau (Kagu-
yama) they hung a mirror and jewels and the blue and white soft hempen
cloths. And when they sang and danced the Kagura or divine dance and
the Sun-Goddess opened the door of the cave a little to look out, the
Deity Tajikarao-no-mikoto pushed it back and drew her forth so that
her August Figure was reflected in the mirror."

(From Saka's Diary of a Pilgrim to Ise, 1342, translated by A. L. Sad-
ler.)

I thank God daily that I have the ability to read and write, to not
transpose lettrs, to ascertain the fixity of prose as my eyes scan
text in the perfection of the mirror of the word. I thank God daily
that the mirror of the word reflects the mirror of the world; As Basil
Hall Chamberlain says, "An extraordinary peculiarity characterises
some of these Japanese mirrors: sunlight reflected from their _face_
displays a luminous image of the design on their _back!_" (Japanese
Things, Being Notes on Various Subjects Connected with Japan, 1971.)
I thank God daily that word and world are separated only by the letter
"el," elohim, (Hebrew) God or Gods of the kami of the mirror. Thus I
can write to you without dyslexia, with the purity of heart necessary
to construct these texts, without the reversals of the letters, but
with the reversals of the mirror reflecting the purity of blue and
white and the curved magatama jewels, so be it.

last night i went sleeping into the thin fogged dampness
of wet white cloth on you, these contours opening to other liquids
fluxing across the wet damp white body as if a towel 
or other ruffled cloth, there were moments of gauze, wet, you could see
your skin through them slightly, moments of bleak darkness
where your body inverted, i thought you looked perfect in cyberspace
you were always in the moment of replying.

Avatars


"Strange contraptions, you will tell me, these machines of virtuality,
these blocks of mutant percepts and affects, half-object half-subject,
already there in sensation and outside themselves in fields of the pos-
sible. They are not easily found at the usual marketplace for subject-
ivity and maybe even less at that for art; yet they haunt everything con-
cerned with creation, the desire for becoming-other, was well as mental
disorder or the passion for power."

(From Felix Guattari, Chaosmosis, An Ethico-Asthetic Paradigm)
