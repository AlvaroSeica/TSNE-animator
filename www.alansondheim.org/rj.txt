for my parents 
for our cats, our crayfish, our fish
for our friends who have left us

this is my best playing, my best offering, my gift to you
so silent perhaps, invisible, one is roomless, sightless,
one has lost everything, but this, lamentations and sublime,
if there were a case in the world, an instance, if there were
a poetry, poetics, holding back, retaining, of a remnant,
silence of philosophy, one is without birth, and surplus,
and of those

Aesthetics of Improvisation:

Intermissions, Interruptions, and Digressions in Performance


At the Sunday talk/video/dance given by Foofwa at the 92nd St. Y, he 
talked about the relationship between complex choreography and inter- 
ruptions in his piece based on Cage, THiRtEEn. We talked about this later 
and I related the discussion to my own improvisation work, as well as 
performances I'd done in Second Life, with other musicians, and so forth. 
I began to think of a taxonomy of interruptions, realizing that I was 
heading into muddy hermeneutics at the least, as well as splitting 
epistemologies and fractured phenomenologies. I revived the idea of the 
'fissure,' a break in the midst of A and A, which doesn't change the 
entity; the split remains, temporary or permanent, as a glitch, but not - 
as in negation, an ontological process.

So we begin with a choreography (which may also be a musical score, 
theatrical text, etc.) which is absolute in the sense that the real is 
absolute; it forms a foreground and background structure which the 
performer follows to the best of hir abilities, without break, with a 
sense of inhabiting the piece which is almost unconscious, and with a 
repertoire of technique that, hopefully, can be taken for granted - a form 
of tacit knowledge that allows the piece to flow smoothly, from beginning 
to end. Think of this absolute choreography as an impossibility, as the 
performer adjusts hirself throughout the presentation: nothing is or can 
be perfect, because no choreography operates as natural law, and 
interpretation is part of the very atmosphere of any performance.

We are talking about human performance here, not machine or program 
performance, where choreographies may repeat themselves endlessly without 
error, or with the repetition of the same error growing either linearly or 
exponentially. Let us think, without error.

There is always the question, or the state, of the freedom of the 
performer, who has agreed, often under contract and capital, to perform 
and rehearse a piece, for perhaps a set amount of time, with various 
riders attached, for example drowning as an act of God.

What can happen? Here we enter into the phenomenologies, the taxonomies, 
of behavior in relation to structure: the coupling is always a loose coup- 
ling.

The performer may repeat or elide a section or sections of the choreo- 
graphy, This may be the result of forgetting the section or sections; it 
may be a conscious decision; it may be the result of an other cue; it may 
be the result of muscle strain or other sense of injury. It may also occur 
as a result of play. All of these situations imply different intentions, 
different intentionalities: forgetting can also connect to a suturing, for 
example, so that the performer does not know s/he has elided something - 
s/he remains within the aegis of the dance, inhabiting the dance, in spite 
of (perhaps) the consciousness, from outside, of something amiss - as if 
there were differing hermeneutics and strata of the same choreography: 
someone performing, someone reading, someone watching. A sense of injury 
or strain tends to foreground the body; if the pain is minor, the 
performer may attempt to circumscribe it, detour 'around' the section, as 
if the detour _were_ the section. If the pain is major, the performer may 
slip into a phenomenology of the body, backgrounding the choreography 
which is then only an inscription under erasure (a differend; the 
choreography is no longer speaking, no longer in control, no longer _in_ 
inscription).

The performer may make a conscious decision not to do the section or 
sections, or to repeat them, or transform them according to any number of 
semiotic operations. This may come out of an inhabitation of the dance, 
leading hir elsewhere/elsewise; it may come out of a sense of play, as if 
the dance were temporarily objectified, thrown for a loop, thrown out of 
kilter; it may come out of a sense of play in which the dance is forgotten 
and the section becomes the horizon itself.

The forgetting of the section may be a conscious forgetting, as the per- 
former does something else, or nothing at all: the performer might rest, 
might decide to rest; the performer's body might 'seem' to rest or decide 
to rest. The daily, the everyday, is foregrounded; the performer has an 
itch, wants to rest, needs to go to the bathroom; has a sense of the 
giggles; remembers a recent argument or sex; starts laughing; is furious 
at hirself; and so forth.

For the audience, the conscious forgetting, the everyday, may well be part 
of the performance: did s/he forget hir lines or is this part of the 
choreography, the score? Is this Brecht, Pirandello, their descendents? Is 
this revolutionary theater, Occupy?

It may simply be everyday, a relationship or communality among people - 
performers, choreographers, audience, within or beneath the problematic 
sign of capital. For the performer, there may _never_ be a return to the 
choreography; for the audience, there is a mixed hermeneutics paralleling 
that between the virtual and the real, always these entanglements, which 
are on the increase, as reality is augmented and the virtual is mixed: as 
programming becomes absolutist on one hand, and the hack and play on the 
other.

The performer may elide a section and jump to another section, rupturing 
the time and continuity of the piece, suturing the same as a fissure 
reveals cracks in the midst of substance, the same and the glitch. The 
glitch is already a recovery. Think of the recovery in relation to 
communality: the action of one performer affects the others, but not in 
the sense of choreography - in the sense of choreography's absence, 
everyone covering up, everyone filling in the gaps - or not, for something 
is always there to be shown, even the performers asleep, giving up, 
deciding it wasn't worthwhile to continue in any case.

What about this? - the decision that it's _not worthwhile to continue._ 
Here is the audience and its/their expectations - their choreography, 
their role/s, and there are the performers carrying a sense of exhaustion, 
ennui, the uselessness of it all, bodies still present, perhaps milling 
about. So there continues to be an occurrence, and everyone perhaps is 
still present, so something is going on, there is a doing or doings.

This is where it might be of interest, thinking through what's worthwhile 
in a deeper or more veered-off sense: is it worthwhile to continue if the 
choreography physically hurts the performer? Becomes so complex that it 
seems ridiculous to follow? Takes up so much of hir time that hir other 
life or lives are backgrounded or eliminated for a period of time? But 
then there is capital, agreements have been made.

Let the agreements perhaps stand _from the very beginning,_ so as Foofwa 
indicated, there is no danger of being fired, eliminated from the 
performance, and so forth. The situation becomes one of trust: the 
performer is hired, that's all there is to it, and what s/he does is 
already acceptable, already in-process, presented, presentable. Of course 
there are limits, s/he might abscond... So the ceiling is set sufficiently 
high that it disappears, just as soccer for example, as rule-laden as it 
is, becomes a dance of improvisation and strategy, a continuance, based on 
the trust that players will do their best. (We know where that leads us, 
but that's another story, not here. So perhaps a bad example.)

Think of this in terms of taksim, a string breaks, the oud cracks, the 
performer is exhausted; in terms of free jazz, a conversation emerges with 
the horns, is carried out in song, then words, then leaving the perfor-
mance altogether. And in dance: as if we're in this together, as if a time 
and a space were being built - rather, inhabited - a form of temporary 
dwelling called an event.

-- I'd say this relates to scripts, roles, and hacks in everyday life, 
relates to everyday games (counting footsteps, avoiding sidewalk cracks, 
and the like), relates to economies of attention (not just capital, not 
just intention). So we might think of loosely-coupled choreographies as a 
form of the everyday, or a local Occupy, with its own rules that might (or 
might not) be up for negotiation. And negotiation might be up for negotia- 
tion as well; such might or might not be the content.

Where all of this goes - is towards an increasing fragmentation between 
script, code, program, choreography, and capital on any number of hands, 
and play, freedom, decision, hacking, laughter, on any other number of 
hands. The category of category is problematized, as are cybernetic 
control systems (on any level); what we might be seeing down the road are 
varieties of presencing in which the image is what you might see and might 
have, and maybe not even that. So in the long run we might look towards a 
phenomenology of the imaginary, as the imaginary, in the world, replaces 
the obdurate of the real-inert. Beneath both are the regimes of slaughter 
and extinction, so that the imaginary is also a dream-screen of the 
fractured image, a moment of solace where thinking and the freedom of 
thinking are permitted. At this point, we might not be able to reasonably 
hope for anything more; humankind is at the verge of the verge, so to 
speak/dance, and will probably remain there, as the very real population 
of the planet continues to increase somewhat exponentially. So the hope is 
that the imaginary is also a back-door to a better future - there's a 
utopian impulse in all of this, which may of course be subverted...

VR Improvised

Anything is possible in the virtual.
Inscription is absolutely cut off from the real.
Inscription cannot be sutured into the real.
The virtual is disposable.
The structure of the virtual is substitution.
Substitution implies creation and annihilation.
0 may be substituted for 1.
1 may be substituted for 0.
The formula of the virtual is [any][any].
The formula of the real is [1][1].
The real is sutured to the annihilation of inscription.
The real de-; the virtual in-.
Nothing is possible in the real.
Suffering is ontology; the virtual Occupies epistemology.
The real is neither here nor there.
The virtual is multiple.
The real is extruded from the real; the real intrudes on the real.
The virtual divides infinitely; the real divides perversely.
Neither the real divides the virtual nor the virtual divides the real.
The ontology of number is practico-inert.
The ontology of the virtual is imaginary.
We know that the real and the virtual are imaginary.
We know that the imaginary inhabits abjection.
We know that abjection inhabits the imaginary.
Abjection inhabits the real insofar as the imaginary.
The virtual expels abjection; abjection is beyond the Pale.
The Pale is its own configuration.
The Pale confines the real.
Everything and nothing are possible in the Pale.
The Pale is beyond the Pale; there is no interior.
The real is multiple by virtue of the virtual.
The virtual is fractured by the real.
The virtual takes all the time in the world.
The real takes none of it.
The virtual takes all the space in the world.
The real takes none of it.
The Pale rides the back of the real; the real fucks the Pale.
And in the virtual? Anything is possible in the virtual.

From: steven tobin <steven@museumfire.com>

We're pleased to announce two new vinyl releases on the Fire Museum label! 
The first one is Cauldron by Alan Sondheim, Helena Espvall & Azure Carter. 
The other is Circle of Crosses by Dora Bleu, Tom Carter and Sam Shalabi. 
These releases are domestically produced 140 gram vinyl, housed in an 
offset printed cover with j-card style obi. These are split releases with 
Tequila Sunrise Records. From the write ups:

Cauldron - Cauldron deals out a three of cups: Alan Sondheim, a pioneer of 
mystical ear-tweak and sci-fi sonic ritual sound, chamber-improv gypsy 
cellist Helena Espvall, and eco-trance singer Azure Carter? thrice to 
thine and thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine. Channeling 
the ghosts of Opal Whiteley and Lou Harrison, Cauldron conjures the 
scratch and shush of the Big Bang out of wood, wind and cat-gut. Whenever 
you listen to it, this album is always over too soon, just like life. Fire 
Museum and Tequila Sunrise Records deal out a two of pentacles: not to get 
all ?Yankee Candle? here, but we only made 250 of these, so grab one 
before they melt away like chemtrails in the sunset sky,

Music

http://www.alansondheim.org/92StY7.png

Why do I constantly play music, jump from one instrument to another.
This isn't a trivial question; I search out the sounds of things.
But why instruments? Why this fakery? I look for the larger gestures.
Secretly I know I get nowhere. Secretly I know, with my hearing and
tinnitus, I'm a fraud. I'm desperate for correct positions. I repeat
figures I heard in ragas decades ago: I can't do anything original!
The fingerboards are mockeries. At this point I prefer the simplest,
no frets, no markers, nothing but a potential field. The markers come
later, muscle memory. They're never exact enough; sometimes they 
don't come at all. Then there are the flutes and other mechanical
devices: I'm running all over them with my hands, my fingers, my 
mouth. It seems purposeless. On a Boehm flute it's hard to go out of
tune but it's also hard to find something else to do. On simpler 
flutes, it's easy enough with the primary scale, but everything else
- like circular breathing on a ken bau - seems to me impossible. I
long for the days of the guitar - nothing but fakery and nuance, the
frets constantly chatter to you, to each other, to the audience. 
Even there I remember Al Wilson telling me I had to keep the guitar
in tune; I hardly knew what he meant. I learned by rote, I memorized
the chords in order. I knew my eyesight was terrible, but it didn't
deceive me: I could look at a complex or simple instrument with
wonder: why on earth would one want ones hands or fingers or mouth
to travel over this thing? And in certain patterns? The sounds seem
remote from the image, although after a while they might as well be
married. But remote. Here I am, moving my hands over taut strings,
and something emerges in another dimension, or dimensionless (time
be damned), that takes on a life of its own. It has nothing to do
with what I'm doing; what I'm doing is faking, getting cramps,
trying to remember what I'm doing in the first place. It has nothing
to do with the appearance of the instrument, the decoration, the 
placement of the pegs, the weight of the thing in my hands, the sway
of the bow. It doesn't float either, this emergent. I don't want to
make too much of this. It's like this: I'm a fake, I pretend I'm a
musician, at least now and then. But what emerges isn't fake, isn't 
real, isn't in tune or out of tune, has a problematic relationship
with the strings or the fipple or the bow or my fingers, memory or
whatever my mind brings to the table, takes from the tablature. 
What emerges is something being, being in the time it takes for its
being, no more and no less, an ontology of the evanescent, an 
epistemology that has left the virtual long behind. And a secret: I
know, playing a string instrument, I must let the sounds die out at
the very end, I must do nothing to impede them. So there's a moment
of building towards that, towards this openness, and it's only 
later, after the emergent seems already a memory, that I realize -
that what's in my hands is a _thing,_ an object, beautiful though 
it may be, that is just _there,_ that has no relationship to what I
just heard, what might have come from me, one or another way, but 
surely not from the wood, the metal, the strings, the fipple, the
very organs of the object. Here are two secrets of music: one, you
already know, the fakery, but the other, more serious, is that the
ontology of music is zero, it doesn't exist, since nothing is 
parceled out through time, time renders music invisible, although
the instrument itself is more than visible, it is assertive, it is
a somehow connected and disconnected thing. The music is invisible
and it is not even momentary, it is _not there,_ and will never be
there, will never have been there, and there is no there there, in
fact, there is nothing. So it is circuitry within you, it is all
interior and refuses to die out with the end of the universe, for
the simple reason that it was never born, was never _in_ the 
universe in the first place. When I play something, improvise, when
I look down at the instrument after I have seemingly finished, I 
have a sense of astonishment at this disconnection between presence
and appetition on one hand, and absence, emptiness on the other. 
This emptiness, and the potential rhythm of this emptiness, speak
of and to a mockery, fakery of the universe itself, with all its
pseudo-rhythms of lunar months, years, electron orbitals, beating
hearts and the like. Rhythm's the byproduct of music which trembles
materiality, as if there were an event traveling through the cosmos
carrying its heart with it, as if there were a centering involved,
which there isn't, which there absolutely isn't. You don't need it,
and the farther you go the more you realize you don't need melody
or harmony, you don't need notes or scales; you might think you 
need sound, but the sound's already there, so you can't really know
if you need it or not. In any case, none of this has anything to do
with the thing in your hands, which astonishes you, as I have said
already, which appears to be a device of some sort, perhaps a
machine, but one that does nothing more than tremble on occasion, 
and what is that about? For myself, I tender the machine, that is  
all I know, and I know little of that in fact, and the rest, the
rest is make-believe; one of these days, I'll hit a really high
note, and my face will bear upon it, the proper mixture of ecstasy
and anguish...

"Shall I, then, give everything away,"

Shall I, then, give everything away,
If not tomorrow, then today?
Down by the courtyard, out by the gate,
Whatever the weather, it's death I await.
It will begin. My brain will sever
Something once, and then never.
These objects are all that remain of the fray
That threw me down on a grey dull day.
Ignorance will become my fate, 
Or broken thoughts at any rate:
And I will transform and sever
That last linger, that comes never.

... and I found myself loathe to leave the site, and touch it, and are 
distressed at, and ashamed of, and loathe it. But in mankind--I am a

birds of modern media

http://www.alansondheim.org/birdsofmcm.mp3

when i was substituting in the modern culture and media department
at brown, i'd listen to the birds outside the windows of the office
where i slept; i made some recordings. now, thanks to chris diasparra,
i have an open-holed flute and this is the result. and i just saw in
fact the anna halprin documentary and there were birds everywhere in
it. and i just remembered the vultures and hawks overhead here, and
as foofwa and i were walking to or from an event, there were herons
overhead. and i remember that all this beauty will disappear for me 
and that my playing can't do it justice, not even the breathing of it
nor the nervousness of repetition and the miracles of losing scales
just at the moment when, teetering, i am wheeling in the sky, the 
earth tilting below me, and, my feathers are ruffled, the nighthawk
begins his descent with an other music, for mate and for love, for 
the uncanny pleasure of flying

hymn to god my god in my sickness

that i may never free myself from the angels of the islands
that i may writhe in pain, like so much contraband
i cannot in good measure ascertain this
my head is the site of excavations
my arms flail against the work of the lord
his hosts disturb me and his minions are in triumph
over all creation they are in triumph
my hands tingle with the flesh of the slaughtered
my forehead is the host of armed marauders
yea though i walk in their fields
yea though they do not yield a thousandth of their grain
their foodstores i know them not nor their garnered temples
by all accounts naught is known of them
i am by all accounts a hymn to god my god
in my sickness i am known and in my pain i knoweth not

i do unravel and my mind unravels
i do weave and in the morn my weaving is undone
my body shivers with uncountable fevers and violence
my ears ring within the ringing of my ears
my heartbeat among them
my heartbeat continues but is counting down
i hear nothing remember nothing
i am lost and am a losing gone
i am in death and am a dying gone

in my sickness i watch myself and i am taking note
and of this accountancy, this is a gift for you
this speaking from the future anterior
this already calling forth for the summons of the body
forgive me o lord in my sickness
forgive me for the words i speak for they speaketh not
nor do they sound the trumpets of the holy
nor the walls of the city within and without
nor do they sound, nor do they sound

PCMs


Years ago I designed a PCM, this was around 1970 maybe. PCM stands for 
Parameter Control Module; the idea was to create a unit which could 
connect and control other similar units. PCMs were digital but they didn't 
need to be. There were any number of inputs and outputs. The idea was that 
anything could be connected to anything else. In other words, there were 
standardized simple protocols in terms of voltage and bandwidth; every- 
thing functioned like blood in the veins of some untoward ganglion. In 
order to enter the PCM array, translation was necessary from an outside 
world into the protocols; this was the job of an input interface which 
could be tailored for particular situations. The interface was divided 
into two sections: the outer section was tailored to the world, and the 
inner, to the emission of protocols. So the input interface was generous 
in its acceptance. At the other end of the array, there was a similar 
output interface, divided into two sections; the inner section was 
tailored to the protocols, sending the signal current to the outer 
section, which was tailored to the world, and generous. For example, an 
audio input interface might take microphone signals and standardize them, 
sending them to the array; an audio output interface might take the array 
protocols and send them simultaneously to audio amplifiers and a lighting 
board. What made the array of greater interest, of course, is that input 
and output signals could also be applied directly to any particular PCM, 
bypassing the standard interfaces. The array as a whole, as a ganglion, 
would be in effect a ganglion open to the world at any place or space, 
both for input and output. One might think of the PCMs as formal neurons. 
Internally, the components of the PCMs might be smoothly voltage-control- 
led, with the possibility of directly inputting different equations; one 
might begin with standard smooth trigonometric functions and replace them 
with discontinuities of all sorts, including chaotic behavior. I believe 
to this day that designing the PCMs would have been a relatively trivial 
matter. Although the project remained stillborn, the concept behind it 
remains of interest to me. I've begun to think of the arrays, inputs and 
outputs, as an affair in which anything might modify or influence any- 
thing, including, reflexively, itself. The arrays in fact might be virtual 
and one thinks only of empty, undefined, space or air, a distant model of 
the real and external world, where such things happen. Thus anything here 
and now has the potential for affecting anything else, and anything might 
seem to turn around and talk directly with you, listening, at the same 
time, to your innermost thoughts, whatever you choose to reveal: here are 
the input and output interfaces. What goes on in such virtual arrays is 
only the ideality of the world itself, the ability to take-for-granted 
that there are always relatively stable domains for communication or 
dwelling, for work or discourse, and so forth. Any dynamic action, any 
action which changes in time, might be considered to be modeled thus; any 
static action might be one which leaves the virtual array quiescent. The 
size and power of the virtual PCMs are also of interest; as they decrease, 
one might argue that the granularity of the world is increasingly differ- 
entiated, just as their increase transforms the granularity into rougher 
constructs handled by integration. In the middle lies everyday life, where 
processing of this sort is kept to a minimum. I can imagine in this 
fashion thinking of the world as a vast complex of fundamental operations 
on the ordering of everyday life, just as Aristotelian logic and its laws 
of distribution appear to deal well with the uncanny lack of transience of 
everyday objects. The edges of such modeling, however, are always limit- 
points which a different kind of roughness appears, for example quantum 
phenomena or color vision or even corrosion. To some extent, these rough 
processes, including unknown one, can be imagined within the virtual array 
which would have additional signals, alarm signals, that anomalies were 
working their way into or out of the array; there could be, in fact, 
virtual interfaces utterly open to the real, whose sole purpose would be 
the conversion of such anomalies. One process would be that of the name, 
beginning with the proper name, and working towards untoward generaliza- 
tions; another would be that of radical smoothing, and a third might be 
the cessation of array activity altogether. I think of this as burrowing 
or death, depending on the degree of destruction or rearrangement 
encountered. Likewise, there would be inverse processes, those of birth or 
emerging, in which partial identity transformations would remain and 
perhaps even be backwards-traceable, backwards-compatible in terms of the 
protocols. The whole, virtual and real, is a form of metaphor ready to be 
implemented. I can only conclude that the same is already in the world, 
and perhaps always already in the world, it is there and here, it is 
operational or quiescent as you like. And such would be the world and its 
dynamics; it is only a question of looking over your shoulder, back into 
the space you have just left behind, forward into the space your are about 
to enter. If you have the time, of course, without catastrophe or 
disruption.
