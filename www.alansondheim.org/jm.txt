How are things done?

In order to do things, there must be a thought and a concept.
There must be leverage as well, hands to grasp and serrated edges
There must be material ready at hand.
One must have a concept of a goal and a future.
There should be a weaning from possession.
Jennifer needs a domain in order to accomplish things.
Things are never done, but are a short-hand for the doing.
Shoosh shoosh with a wave of the hand and a place to walk.
Everything can be used such as the biting of teeth and nails.
In order to do things, there must be a sense of being done.
A sudden burst of energy is all that is necessary to begin.
Beginning and ending and doing are just things that happen.
Language must silence itself, at least for the briefest moment.
Orderly promotions of tiny movements tend towards completion.
Movement are organized and may be thought away, like walking.
Jennifer needs a bit of energy like milkshakes or simple booze.
Sleepiness is not conducive as the body walls in with bark and leaves.
Momentum comes from a desire which informs and curls down to biomolecules.
O lazybones, get up, deconstruction obfuscates, circumambulates.
Laying out on the workbench is already a thinking and a doing.
Bursts of energy, lazybones, collapse into a pile of fatty acids.
Doing is all my beautiful domains, defuge withdraws and decathects.
Knotted cords anxiously tighten goals and scripts which are higher-level
processes already gone with the doing.
Anxiety and dreaming, thinking and nervous tightening, are all doings of
things as well.
Potential barriers and boundary maintenances are doings that are necessary
for the doings of things.
Jennifer underlines.

It's not the prism of sex, it's not the prism of anything. If you're into
sex, it's the prism of sex. If you're into transport, look there, or if
alchemy, equivalent; it's a double x-ing of devices; nothing looks at any-
thing except through desire, prosthetics, neutral. 

It's a stake to say sex, not a steak.

It's not a prism; it's a potential field, disrupted manifold fuzzy and
convoluted at the edges. Nothing is ordered, no seriality. Look at it
through anything and there is your definition.

I think it's this information.

Wet (I can't write well in the morning, my thinking outpaces my ability.)


It just occurred to me in the shower this morning (yes, I shower, not that
you would get _that_ close or care), that the major difference between
email lists and other forms of community is that on an email list everyone
hears everyone else; this is radically different than other forms of com-
munity of course. MOO, MUD, talkers, and IRC all have _on-application_
forms of private messaging; if I do a page Jennifer how are you? on a MOO,
the question and presumed reply remain within the structure.

With an email list, a private message (within the _aura_) is elsewhere. It
spills into daily life, moves from private email to the post-office, and
from ytalk to telephone. The edges of the list are, on one hand, inscrib-
ed - what's written, goes to everyone - and on the other, are ragged, torn
open by desire that impels itself into every breach. 

So that the overt discussion or superstructure is always group; thread
titles change far too often to provide a sure guide for delete. On news-
groups, tin and other readers work through titles, and many posts are left
unread; newsgroups (particularly with the degree of noise on them) require
threading to function at all.

But the email lists move towards continuous consensus and the shaping of a
totality of input/output; at times the posts stream over the imaginary
body of chordate-writing, sinews moving musculature across uncanny do-
mains. "Consensus" is not agreement; it's an interstitiality that stutters
itself as identity, beneath the signifier of the list, the topics, the
readings and writings.

So if I whisper to you, I whisper elsewhere; if I make my presence felt to
you and you alone, it is my voice on the telephone, my photographs in the
mail. And if I write to you, it is to all of you on the list, although you
may decode, may feel this text, this pressure, meant for your body alone.
But the pressure is everywhere, and this is the difference between these
communities and any other, that, within the inscription of the list, we
all read and know each other's business.

BAY OF FUNDY, SOUTH OF GRAND MANAN ISLAND, LOCAL MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE

Capt. W. J. Milne, master of the C. G. S. "Curley" reports the existence
of an area of local magnetic disturbance southward of Grand Manan Island.
The area is situated 3/4 mile southward Three Islands and is about 150
yards in diameter with depth of water of 12 fathoms. The greatest deflec-
tion of compass observed was 45 degrees. The northern portion of the area
is fixed by the following sextant angles; Gannet Rock lighthouse, 0 deg. 
southwest Head lighthouse Grand Manan Island, 92 deg 42' Whitehead Hill in
range with reef that never covers bearing N. 36 deg E 83 deg 0'. Lat. 44
deg 33' 17" N., long 66 deg 45' 38: W. 

LIGHTHOUSE

BELLE ISLE - On north east point. Lat. 52 deg. 1' 2" N., long. 55 deg. 15'
18" W. Flashing white light; Flash 1/2 second, eclipse 10 1/2 seconds; 137
feet high; visible 17 miles; iron tower encased in a reinforced concrete
covering; red, polygonal lantern, 55 feet high; visible from all points. 
Diaphone operated by compressed air, gives blast of 3 1/2 seconds duration
every minute. Horn points 77 deg 90 feet above high water mark; situated
near edge of cliff 200 feet northeasterly of the lighthouse. Marine tele-
graph and signal and ice report station. Depot of provisions for ship-
wrecked mariners. In fog, low light may be visible when high obscured or
vice versa. Should the fog siren at Belle Isle south and light station
become disabled, cotton powder bombs will be exploded temporarily every
ten minutes; and if a vessel fog signal is heard in dangerous proximity,
an additional shot will be immediately fired, and the firing will be con-
tinued at intervals of 5 minutes, until the vessel has passed the station.
Marconi wireless station established here in 1905.

_________________________________________________________________________



Sign/als


Balls rise and fall, cones face up or down; pure light radiates at inter-
vals from sources. Lighthouse signifies identity, presence itself radiat-
ed; it maps virtual modalities, waves of sound and light, in extension of
danger and submergence. 

Sources flood; radio beacons function through interpreters. Less precise
and reliable, they soothe and integrate, their signal broken by static.
The compass itself declines its proper function, graciously deflecting in
honor of local anomalies.

Weather forecastings are otherwise than being; these trace through the
signifier alone, superstructural guidance through double coding, inter-
preters and listeners, radios and linguistic unraveling/competency. The
symbolic as radical disconnect leaves no trace; ikonic lighthouse leaves
trace only within the chaotic domain.

O Mariner, look no farther than thine eyes allow, hear naught but what
confirms by amplitude of sound or visual warning. Virtual weathers de-
ceive, nothing is certain in the northern climes.


For these reasons, O Mariner, we have inscriptions and markings, bound-
aries and demarcations, transmissions and tokens, overlaying sea, land,
and atmosphere with guidance - all to be swept away by yon storm upon the
horizon, whiteout in violent winter, scudding clouds bringing sea to bear
upon barren deck, swept clean of eye and ear, compass and radio, signi-
fiers all.

Paste is when music no longer sounds the beats of the world, doubling and

Paste is how the world emerges, submerges, inchoate dissimulations as I
let you down, let myself down, no longer speak in throes of suffocation. 
Paste is why I fuck myself, open cunts in the cocktip, churn flesh back
into flesh, splay body, descend into the maelstrom of cultural debris. 
Paste is where the world is found, cold Jennifer's panties grounding her
language while she stands, brushes off, walks in her brand-new frock.
Paste is who we are, obscene twin tumors cathected into one another, bore-
dom, and defuge, cancers devouring the remnants of grave and graven flesh.
Paste is what drives us, blinding eyes, muting ears, violating mouths and
hands as we inscribe the last _xy_ in planetary depression and psychosis. 
Paste is wherefore, wither, the question, last abscesses of graphemes, as
if there were meaning, distributed or otherwise than being, annulled.

Phenomenology of Immensity


All other philosophies dissolve; the phenomenology of immensity, the rim
of the sublime, the infinite, remains. Life is a narrow-bandwidth occur-
rence. The phenomenology of immensity sweeps life and earth away, opens
gaping maw to the cosmos, realizes the futility and absurdity of this and
every other gesture.

The only certainties are those of the abjection of earth: plasmas, dark
matter, high energy, void, virtual particles, irradiations, black holes,
temperatures of annihilation, neutron stars, tidal forces, early and late
universes, inflationary universes with dissolute constants. Mind is matrix
and closure; death foreclosures, gropings die in mud slacked to cold ice
and dissolution. 

When you start with this stuff, you end with this stuff; the phenomenology
of immensity, like identity, necessarily short-circuits. It's this that
creates radical disconnect, that takes away anyone in their own good time. 

The rest, the ethics, the fears, depressions, representations, goes by the
wayside. The wayside, burned atoms, curls. Nothing remains/inscribed. Be-
gin with the nought, end with the knot, burned, gone. Recognize the idle
chatter.

Humanity began with stories; it's got a while to tell them. They claw be-
cause they're spoken, temporary stases. The flow engulfs. Drowning is sign
and portent. 

The longer we grope _there,_ the more the phenomenology of immensity lends
itself to the evacuation of the real. We stain ourselves in possibility.
Radical disconnect of language permits anything with fingers pressed
against anxious eyes. Shift, live outside ourselves. Self-immolation is
the order of the day. Less is more, more is less, etc. It doesn't even
matter. It doesn't even even.

Quot

"You ask me, my good friend, if I know how to incite delirium, vertigo,
any madness whatsoever, among those orderly and placid masses that are
born, eat, sleep, reproduce themselves, and die. Is there no way, you 
ask, to introduce a new epidemic of flagellants, or of convulsionaries?
And you speak of the millennium?" (Miguel de Unamuno)

_______________________________________________________________________


ii P of I


The phenomenology of immensity is not a phenomenology. It can neither de-
scribe nor articulate. It refuses framework, is the refuse of framework
and the framework of refuse. Language ridicules itself (here, within). 

Thus there is no site from which to begin articulation. Immensity is not
sublime; it is the exhaustion of the species. Any ethics, psychogeography,
psychoanalytics, philosophy, that does not begin with the stain and its
absence, with a-memory and disconnect, with turning the other('s) face, 
is doomed to locally succeed.

Hahaha the gods are laughing. Hahaha there aren't any.

Statistically, the resolute begins with a random sequence of sufficient 
length that it almost certainly won't be generated during the lifespan of
the universe; 64 H's and T's with a coin will do (I pointed this out in
An,ode, 1968). Time is easier to bridge and circumvent in this manner; it
is the inertness of space and space-time that leads to the phenomenology
and its corruption.

And individuation with the 64 (at a throw a second) is meaningless within
the burned atoms of plasma, surface of a neutron star, violation fabric of
quasar, interminable corruption of information within a spewed black hole.
Not to mention deaths of the human and other scrabbling biomoleculars
scattered across the cosmos. (Statistics lie / there.)

Nothing's looking at us. Aliens wouldn't solve the problem of isolation.
Star Trek crafts spread the stain several-fold. Bridging is the symbolic;
the inert, pratico-nothing (is) the real.

Like a flat lid, simile doesn't survive. Stain dries, flakes, dissolves,
absences. Annihilation fabric (of) the real, etc. (P of I turns in upon
itself, repeats language, gesture, moment. Huddles, remembers language. 
Memorial of the unsaid. Speaks while it can. Retains the parenthetical.)

I use a weather forecasting service provided for shell accounts through
telnet 3000. The end of the NY state weather forecast is below; this came
through the wire today. I quote it verbatim.

Note the word "tongue." It has not been present before in these texts. It
stands alone, trembling, at the end of the file, immediately before the
"for use" statement which I have eliminated.

It is a signal; certainly it is a signal, sent out this Wednesday morning,
Jan 29 03:25:07 EST 1997. Atmospheric traumas suddenly reformulate, pene-
trate, biology, organ. Gaia announces herself, defending the planet ag-
ainst the all-too-obvious conclusions of the phenomenology of immensity,
which I have taken pains to delineate.

Cuts and Trebles (disappearance of the sign in community)

Cutting up a strathspey, help me dear God here, the bow flies and doubles
triples, the whole thing thrimbles, tumbles along. Tremble the rhythms,
thrum faster until hearts ache, beats break. Sooner the tune shimmers,
lost is the sign that signals. Submerge thimble and triple, limber tones
and listen, tossed is the line that ravels. Sound is the sender of trills
or trifles, cutting the wobble of timbrelling times. Lost is the sign in
the body of cutting, strathspey the meld of the bodily tossed, rhyme the
last moment of cluttering thought. So the sign's gone the line, so the
earth's given birth, so the air's played down there, so the winter sin-
ters. I talk to you, the words are birds, thrimble and tremble, the lines
of the body gone in the air there, winter sintered, summer hummered, fall
down, spring forth to the earth given birth. Sputtering the strathspey,
struttering the hornpipe, double-up bow and slur, double-up bow and slur.
Crushed-bowstroke signifier of Ashley and Scotty, slithering, slathering,
signified spread, gone to the head, ghost of the signified, gone to the
ground.

Cuts and Trebles (disappearance of the sign in community)

>Cutting up a strathspey, help me dear God here, the bow flies and doubles
>triples, the whole thing thrimbles, tumbles along. Tremble the rhythms,
>thrum faster until hearts ache, beats break. Sooner the tune shimmers,
>lost is the sign that signals. 

Sound is not language, reducible however to fourier series, chaotic do-
mains and noise. But not language; here I'm talking about signals, sig-
nifiers, articulation and framework recuperating gracenotes and ornament -
yes or no, as both create supplement, residue. Aesthetics is not respon-
sive necessarily to language; the two are at odds. 

>Submerge thimble and triple, limber tones
>and listen, tossed is the line that ravels. Sound is the sender of trills
>or trifles, cutting the wobble of timbrelling times. Lost is the sign in
>the body of cutting, strathspey the meld of the bodily tossed, rhyme the
>last moment of cluttering thought. 

So that language and structure submerge, a process of integration, smooth-
ing on one hand, ornament as differentiation on the other. The sign or
signifier is lost, is/was present, an effaced present as bowed extensions
literally push at the boundaries of the thing. The image vibrates until
image is lost; inscription becomes fuzzy, fissures.

>So the sign's gone the line, so the
>earth's given birth, so the air's played down there, so the winter sin-
>ters. I talk to you, the words are birds, thrimble and tremble, the lines
>of the body gone in the air there, winter sintered, summer hummered, fall
>down, spring forth to the earth given birth. 

Rhyme sends word into sound, language into substance; rhyme cycles the
line, rearticulates like the seasons. Earth/birth is that of chora/chthon-
ic, drives which ooze, distribute, diffuse. The strathspey rings and lilts
but fiddle cuts across and ornament cuts fiddle.

>Sputtering the strathspey,
>struttering the hornpipe, double-up bow and slur, double-up bow and slur.
>Crushed-bowstroke signifier of Ashley and Scotty, slithering, slathering,
>signified spread, gone to the head, ghost of the signified, gone to the
>ground.

Cutting is both a specific technique and a cutting session (jazz), out-
playing, as Ashley adds layer after layer of triplets and crushed-bow-
strokes; you can hear the humming of the strings. The signified becomes
uncanny, ghost, shimmering; the ground is where it falls, the rupture of
music and language, copulation of music and integer. 

What is grounded is the excess constructed by ornament or broken ornament
and again the bow-attack on language is evident in the form which dissem-
inates; articulation is always afterwards, afterwords, afterthought.

Let us begin with forty objects, and consider the permutations of these,
taken twenty at a time. Each object is distinct, inscribed, identifiable.
Let each permutation be an act of inscription, and let us consider the age
of the universe to be approximately fifteen-billion years. Then in order
to complete the totality of the acts of inscription within the currently
allotted time, a computer must be able to run at approximately 709 giga-
hertz, carrying out one inscription per cycle. We can surely forget about
the permanent record of these permutations, but we can use a temporary
display, running at 709 gigahertz as well, presenting them one after ano-
ther. At this speed, one can only assume that _pure light_ will emerge
from the specially-constructed lcds. 

The second example, which I have already mentioned, is simply sixty-four
tosses of a coin, resulting in a relatively unique signature, that could
only be generated over fifteen-billion years by approximately twenty
throws per second; this gives a slightly more than half probability of the
sequence appearing in the allotted time.

Likewise the span of a human being is somewhere in the middle of the uni-
versal scale, taken logarithmically. Thus we may look down to our toes as
well as up to the most distant galaxies, taking in subatomic particles and
strings, as well as the span of visible and invisible inflationary cosmos.

All of these processes of inscription span the breadth of an ASCII page,
layered through TCP/IP and the occasional ATM, and impressing the already
swollen heads of carbon-based life with their mastery of the known and un-
known.
...

John Leslie, in The End of the World, The Science and Ethics of Human Ex-
tinction, writes about nuclear war, disease, ozone layers, despair, poll-
ution, asteroids, physics experiments gone awry, and so forth, as possib-
le causes of human extinction. I recognize the futility of writing these
mathematical or probabilistic sequences, inscribing them in the face of
utter noise, beyond anything chaos has to offer; nevertheless, it might be
worthwhile to at least begin the effort, as with the legend of the Tibetan
names of God. In this case, however, the result is not the end of the
universe, but simply an epitaph for the planet. As far as I'm concerned,
one will do as well as the other.

I can't write anything but stupid examples. If humans aren't mewling about 
the limits of the text, they're mewling about death and its horizon, text-
ual and non-. Whatever's said is simultaneously irreducibly stained and
reduction. The examples are trivial. It's all helpless, a return to Dosto-
evsky's underground absurdities. Where's Sonia when we need her? For that
matter, Jennifer's been quiet lately... And I'm sick in my liver, bitter
in this season apropos of the wet snow, some of you know what I'm talking
about.

Dark Aura


If I speak the wrong thing, if I write the wrong thing; if I look the
wrong way, if I walk the wrong way: The dark aura haunts me, surrounds
and perturbs, subverts every simple thought, stretching the limit into
torn cloth. Life is hideous negation; at every turn I might say, I hate
you, you're dead, you're ugly, I'm ugly, fuck you, fuck me, you've always
lied to me, you're not a friend, I never had any friends, you've always
used other people, look at me naked, take your clothes off, slit my
wrists, spread me open, kill yourself, kill me. Just behind that, dear
Alan, writes Jennifer, there is horror. (Just behind that, and that, and
that, the source of neurosis, protection of psychosis, sewage of semiosis,
and just beyond that and that.)

I'm afraid I'll take pills, walk into traffic, suffocate in my sleep, slit
my wrists, cut my throat, stuff my fist in my mouth; I don't do these
things, I walk to class and talk Internet. I want to say, I might say,
fuck you all, take me, rob me, embalm me, staple my nipples to the wall,
I'm ignorant, I'm lying to you, I'm not real, get out of here, leave
before the walls light up. 

My life's governed by the violence of the aura, by the abyss behind eti-
quette, propriety, the clean and proper body. Talking to you I want to see
your breasts, suck your cunt, suck your asshole; walking with you, I want
my hand up your holes, your hand up mine. I say nothing, lie to you, I'm
freezing here, let's go for coffee, have you read Blanchot, you're not a
real friend, you've always lied to me, I have no real friends.

It always teeters, the dark aura, just behind my eyes, just within my
words, the slightest moisture on the back of the hand, the trembling be-
tween my legs, migraines pouring pain, dragging torn cloth, violation
fabric, down into immolations, severed limbs.

I try to be polite, do the right thing, come up spanky clean, sweep with a
new broom, cut my losses, present myself, forget if you only knew, take me
now, my holes are dirty, you've always hated me, I've always hated you,
bend me over your knees, lick the floor for me, revenge is never enough, I
want to see you dead, you want to see me

thus chaos occupies hollows, in the form of dust or percolation or sponge,
dust or percolation or sponge in the midst of which sky reigns; men and
women seek caverns in response, roam headlong through valleys hollowed and
enclosed, through innumerable holes and passages, back into the hollows of
dust or percolation or sponge, speared through and through by sky, caverns, 
hollows, and chaos, dusted, percolated, sponged

The Beautiful Garden


There is a Beautiful Community Garden a block from here which is the last
remnants of the physical neighborhood, the neighborliness of the area, the
nice love that fills the earth with plants and creates havens. Now the
Beautiful Garden fence is covered with ribbons of all colors (see .jpg if
you are on Cybermind, and Imagine if you are on Fop-l), because evil dev-
elopers are already ploughing the fence down to build another store we
don't need because the borough of Brooklyn sold out and you can read all
about it, said Jennifer, in the Daily News or Park Slow Courier. There
have been local meetings and we have written to Howard Golden the Brooklyn
president but it does not look good because the developers just don't care
about feelings here and the need of families to feel rooted. Already there
are outpatient clinics, a mall, unemployment and welfare offices in the
area, all of which are fine, but the area is under siege and there are
less places for children and the garden which is my place for roots and
leaves, said Jennifer, will be no more. And community gardens are our last
contact with the earth outside of cyberspace, she continued, since every-
thing else here is transient; rents are going up and poor people like our-
selves have no place to go. Oh Oh Oh this is the oldest story in the book,
she cried, it's the same all over the city as the Rich get Richer and run
around with their Private Fenced Parks while the rest of us cannot hold
onto the tiniest bit of Green, not even this Garden of Eden which has
taken so many thousands of loving hours to create. So everyone has put
Ribbons on the Fence and there are Thousands of Ribbons but they will make
mulch for Bulldozer Blade. Now I will go back to my loving Cyberspace
which is also under Horror Development but there are still tiny places for
me to sing and sit, and I will sit there in my Frock for a long long time
because the Dream won't go away.

I begin with a text, written today, and forwarded to the Fiction-of-Phil-
osophy and Cybermind email lists, which I co-moderate. The text describes
a community garden; an _avatar,_ Jennifer, who is part and parcel of me,
is the presumed writer. Jennifer is upset with the ploughing under of the
garden, making way for a new and unnecessary store; I am upset. Her text
will be read by hundreds of people world-wide, who will have never been to
Brooklyn, but who will empathise with gardens and gardening, and the need
for physical roots.

Jennifer's community is on-line, and she exists on-line, just as surely as
I do. She is not my alter ego, nor is she either equivalent or identical
with me; like me, she writes herself in and out of existence, writing her
gender as well.

The text follows:


                         "The Beautiful Garden"


"There is a Beautiful Community Garden a block from here which is the last
remnants of the physical neighborhood, the neighborliness of the area, the
nice love that fills the earth with plants and creates havens. Now the

Now when Jennifer writes, she talks about sitting on the ground, feeling
the cold and dampness of the ground through her underwear, being aware of
being rooted, but a rootedness which is disconnected; Jennifer is mobile,
runs and walks everywhere in fact. Like the symbolic, rootedness on-line
is broken, broken down; it is a memory, just like Jennifer's knowledge of
the physical world is a memory.

Jennifer has, as she says, all the time in the world, and since she is on-
line, I think she has all the time and no time, but my own time is limi-
ted. Jennifer has all the space too, and I have the same space as Jennifer
as we are born and borne together. We are borne on the packets of the Net,
sundered together by virtue of a common IP address, no matter what we say,
but the address is only a marker or token; it could even be considered an
indirect address, in terms of the virtual domains that open on both sides
of the chiasm, X, where the node lies. The node is only a gateway from
local to international databases, from worldings to worldings, and we draw
from ourselves what community we bring to community, what gifts we have to
offer, where we draw our gardens, where we choose to sit.

It would be too easy to say our home is a site of contestation or negotia-
tion, that it is the signified of cultural reproduction (because signifi-
ers and signifieds are all there are, as well as cultures, in this space);
it is more accurate to note that virtual embodiment is a cloth and cloth-
ing of psychoanalytic flows, that it is constructed of part-objects play-
ing or played within language games, that it rides on TCP/IP and other
protocols, and that it is a _matter_ of desire, that the virtual panties
on the virtual ground involve a sexuality that floods spaces and gardens
everywhere here. 

With regard to psychoanalytic flows, we can consider libidinal energies,
cathecting and decathecting; we also look towards the imaginary given by
the symbolic, which is the inverse of physical life. In the latter, one
starts with the real, moves to the symbolic; on line, one starts with the
symbolic, riding on protocols, and moves to uncanny or imaginary embodi-
ment. 

With regard to part-objects playing or played within language games, Jen-
nifer and I are textual/desiring, lacking the phenomenology of the real
described in, say, Merleau-Ponty; instead, there are local investments,
cathectings, nodes, played against other texts, played within themselves.

With regard to the protocols, one notes that _always_ a certain etiquette
is observed; otherwise, the post or writing simply won't _go._ The syn-
tactic dominates everything here, even _home,_ which is a garden and a
fuzzy category to be sure.

With regard to the matter of desire, and the problematic of the virtual
panties, it is surprisingly easy to move into feeling out "cyberspace" as
real space; this connects with Polyani's notion of _tacit knowledge,_
as well as the phenomenology of _prosthesis_ and the phantom limb. We
always already inhabit the symbolic; this occurred as soon as the gesture
was born (see Tran Duc Thao). Now we _occur_ as mobilities within and
without the machinic; we're haunted by desire, and the Heideggerian de-
sire for ground is little different than "sleazy" Internet Relay Chat sex
on a comfortable _home channel._

With regard to spaces and gardens, Jennifer and I think of _distributions_
of nodes, graph-fluxes, memories aligned in databases all across the Net.
Home becomes the mobility of interconnectivity; it functions like the
Lacanian ego, buried in language, beneath the name-of-the-father, TCP/IP,
shifted and leaking. The ego-home has a sense of its identity, and another
model comes to mind, that of Edelman's neural architecture which is paral-
lel and "alocal"; memory, home, and identity on the Net are spread thin,
convulsed with local intensities. Just as a _copy_ of Moby Dick problema-
tizes the notion of the original, so do duplicate copies of Jennifer's or
Alan's texts across the Net. But this is not a problem for Jennifer or
Alan, just as copies of Moby Dick are not a problem for readers or writ-
ers. Instead, it's a condition of the ontology of information, the epis-
temological / epistemic flooding of sources, channels, and receivers. 
(For this reason, we tend to speak of symbolic _emissions_ or _spews,_
rather than the singularities of signs, signifiers, signifieds, graphemes,
and the like.)

What we are speaking / writing of here is _wryting,_ the construct of
ontological commitment through text (and other forms of representation),
which is the fundamental structure of wryting into and out of existence.
Wryting occurs most evidently on MOOs, MUDs, and other text-based reali-
ties (Webchat, ThePalace, etc.), but it is our contention that it, in
fact, occurs _everywhere_ on line, that it is a _condition_ of being on
line. Wryting carries, like carapace, its own home or presence. As lurking
demonstrates (on email lists, newsgroups, and the like), wryting, _for the
subject,_ need not involve writing at all (beyond logging in); it is sim-
ply the presencing of oneself for oneself. Hence, it is possible to make a
home on an email list for oneself _without posting anything._ For others
on the list, the lurker may remain invisible; for the lurker, the list is
familiar, developing much as an epistolary novel or soap opera develops,
energized by the fact that he or she _can_ post, and comfortable in its
textual nooks and crannies. 

If wryting is home, have we wrytten ourselves into this _space,_ this con-
ference, this publication, this fireside chat, this hearth? The writing
carries its own impetus, its own whisperings and dissolutions (see Kris-
teva, Revolution in Poetic Writing); Jennifer and I are born and die
t/here. The only difference is that of the differend, which permits her to
speak, take her own good time, while he loses it, submerges it, with the
usual death on the physical horizon. Until separation, however, identi-
ties, like homes, genders, authors, writings, readings, spaces, presences,
ontologies and epistemologies, are blurred. 

Written by Jennifer, "herself"!

Look what I Found, by Jennifer!


"I suspected all sorts of mysteries and deceptions around me. There was no
absurdity in which I did not believe. At the dawn of life, when such idio-
cies are conceivable, perhaps because of the memories of the baby smocks
in which I was arrayed still earlier, I imagined that at some time before
I was born I had been a little girl and that I had to bring back that fas-
cinating and delightful actuality by tightening my belt till I felt like
fainting. And sometimes I imagined that I was not the son of my parents,
but an adopted foundling." (Pasternak, I Remember.) 

That sums me up exactly!

Fractured Mirrors


"The negation of the several matters, which is insisted on in the thing no
less than their independent existence, occurs in Physics as _porosity._
[...] Pores are not empirical facts; they are figments of the understand-
ing, which uses them to represent the element of negation in independent
matters." (Hegel, Logic, trans. Wallace.)


I am reading Jocelyne Doray and Julian Samuel, The Raft of the Medusa, and
Aruna Handa and John Kipphoff, Into the European Mirror, A Work by Julian
Samuel. The central video image of the latter contains the words "surgery"
"frontiers" "expulsions". While the mirror fractures and bounces, opens
imaginary spaces, surgery operates on interiors, organs passing through
frontiers; products/productions are erected as representations of Other.
Other is assimilated, expelled with debris-signifiers, exhausted and abj-
ected signs. They love our technology which we send them, video and Inter-
net. Everything confuses, but violence dominates as planetary intensifica-
tions, overcrowdings, confusions. Read Euclid and it's all there, the ab-
straction of the world always already parceled and axiomatized. The story
is back _there,_ the story so far.

Enter Samuel's works which have no easy answers, range and gun for all
sides, verbal violence, hardly cathartic, against theory and colony and
domination. I never get the sense of an _opening_ elsewhere, but only the
inordinate complexity of the world, peoples, problematic of the nation-
state. And it's here that Samuel is incredibly valuable; the "but only"
subsumes the radical problematic of truth, information, representation, in
the face of an overburdened planet. I love him for it, this _churning_ of
discourses and destinies.

Listen, JK asks (Mirror, Kipphoff), meanders: "Has it become impossible,
at the supposed end of history, or in the supposed absence of any ideology
which could pose a viable challenge to liberal capitalism, to create coun-
ter-histories? You seem to say that you have to be content with raising
methodological questions about the construction of histories and encourag-
ing a generalized form of sceptical thinking."

JS replies: "There is no end to history. That's just the postmodern/cul-
tural studies 'theoreticians' and other self-promoting psychos say to get
attention. Everyone knows they are as stupid as the universe is large,
even with their nickel and dime doctorates."

Continues: "A very learned friend, Michael Neumann, has suggested to me
that Asian nations are just as autocentric about their historiography as
anybody else. Massive cultures impose their values on weaker ones. Has
Japan made much intellectual room to get itself raked over the coals? Ask
others in the region. I'm not dead certain that the West has the perfect
monopoly on autocentrism."

Now, I'm one of those "theoreticians" JS rails against; I'm hardly a self-
promoting psycho and I'm not stupid. JS creates the same sort of imperial-
ist violence he rails against; it's everywhere, stuffing space. It can be
sensed or senseless; I don't know any pomo/cs theoreticians talking about
the "end of history" - if anything this seems to be post-Bell anideologi-
cal talk, or maybe Baudrillard who's rather conservative. So the attack is
wide of the mark, but as I've said filling; this then goes into statement
about "massivity" that's closer (re: Chomsky's statement about dialects),
and from there to autocentrism. It's all over. If I didn't know better, or
maybe because I do, I see the discomfort of reading JS connected with that
of Lacan - to read the latter is to _participate_ in the very therapeutic
he constructs. Reading JS, one is forced into positions of violence, opp-
ression (I feel oppressed reading him), imperialism; the reading is not a
reading _of_ the political, but a _political reading,_ reading forced into
the discomforting phenomenology and employment of power.

Who is the _we_ sending which _technology_ to which _them_ are questions
that disseminate indefinitely while transnationals, tns, take over the
business of mining the planet. It's here that postmodernism is useful,
looking at radiations, information orders, disseminations, part-objects,
geographies, demarcating what dissolves: ownerships which are no longer
traceable, capital which disappears, wars-without-corpses but mourning of
hundreds of thousands dead. The diffusion is there in Samuel as well, and
for this reason I'd all his attack on postmodernism a kind of suicide; his
fragmentations/deconstructions of narrative play into central themes of
pomo research. The full title of Raft is The Raft of the Medusa, Five
Voices on Colonies, Nations, and Histories - giving fifteen subjects/ob-
jects, and as Charles Acland says in his essay, "The interviews in _The
Raft_ display a serious engagement with the problems of writing from a
mobile site." I'd argue that _all_ sites are mobile, that homelands are as
much cyberspatial or tn as _real earth,_ and this mobility is precisely
the problem; what is returned to is often scorched earth, desert, or a
bombing run - not to mention local dictatorial rule.

Acland goes on to state - and note again the churning: "Cultural and post-
colonial critique is complicated, and somewhat enabled, by the fact of
writing from a home away from home: Maalouf, from Lebanon, now in Paris,
commenting upon Iran; M. Nourbese Philip, from the Caribbean, now in Tor-
onto, reconfiguring the travels of Dr. Livingstone; Thierry Hentsch, from
Switzerland, now in Montreal, writing of the construction of _L'Orient
imaginaire_; Sara Suleri, from Pakistan, now in New Haven, Connecticut,
providing critical analyses of British India; and Ackbar Abbas, discerning
imperial tensions in architecture in Hong Kong, a colonial space where, as
he comments, 'there has never been "a before".'" These "critiques of en-
twining colonial discourses" are of course entwined, as is Samuel's think-
ing from Montreal's heart of empire; everyone is implicated, including the
authority/authorship of the word of Black Rose Books. While Samuel tends
to identify with Marx, I find his critique less monolithic, more dealing
with representation and superstructure - a viewpoint I can only agree
with, for images kill as well.

Back to JK, for I do not know what a "counter-history" is. I know histor-
iography's concerns; local histories; the (Lyotard's) dismemberment of
grand narratives, but in order for there to be a _counter_ there must be a
site or position which is monadic, and this has always dissolved in the
leaky/porous West, itself in need of detotalization. I'd say that Samuel,
like a good postmodernist, refuses totality, fights guerilla tactics, in-
volves himself even in the Fanonian self-hatred of the colonized or dis-
placed (myself as well, perhaps becoming a universal indictment), and in
the process of this churning (again, a stirring, viscous fluid and
_stick_), exposes the bones breaking through the flesh, the wounds which
refuse to heal, the bodies of "Desert Storm" (a title right out of repre-
sentative sememes, entertainments).

Quoting from Rana Kabbani in Mirror: "The expulsions of 1492 set a pattern
- a Western pattern - that is set and that we have not varied from at all,
in Europe's relations with others, in its relations with colonies, and in
its relations with Muslims n particular."

"I do not see a difference after Bosnia, I do not see a difference between
being a Muslim in fifteenth-century Europe and being a Muslim in twenti-
eth-century Europe."

Samuels asks: "So it is ultimately very connectable?" and Kabbani replies:
"Totally connectable: the idea of the 'other', the stranger, the Muslim,
the Arab, the Saracen, the Moor, the Jew, the Blackamoor - you do not like
them, you're afraid of them, you despise them, you throw them out, or you
burn them at the stake. There is no other solution: the European mind has
still not come up with any philosophical solution. That is why we have a
holocaust every few decades."

And in Raft, Amin Maalouf: "The centre is man. You, me, we are all meeting
places. I have the right to be, at the same time, Christian, Moslem, Jew-
ish, Buddhist. I have the right to borrow from all religions, from all
ideologies, from all the books that I read, from all my personal experi-
ence. And I don't need a label that refers me back to a religion, to a
variant of a religion. That is my profound conviction."

"I am not trying to proselytize with this. I am not trying to say this is
the path that everyone has to take. But for me, it is certainly my path. I
refuse to belong to a nation, even if this is something which makes you
smile, because this is a period when people are uncertain of where they
belong. People today want to say: I belong to this religion, I belong to
that nation, I belong to that culture, and I reject this. I understand it,
but I don't have much sympathy for this evolution. I find it extremely
retrograde. I have a lot of respect for people who say, I claim many
nationalities, many cultures. For me this is the future, even though we
may pass through a period of regression today."

Of course I am _writing_ this on the Internet, in the midst of broken
national boundaries, what I'd call borderliners, drawing/redrawing lines,
inscribing lines, which fissure, crack open, tear. And somewhere there are
ghosts in the background, _massive_ cultures, ruptured, viral movement
within them. Julian doesn't so much document all of this as create dis-
coursing, what elsewhere I'd call shape-riding the real. Representation
and peoples intermingle; holocausts destroy base and superstructure like
giant storms crackling the planet.

Chris Giannou, Mirror: "The diversity of human experience is such that
sometimes in my life I have felt as though my body were an allegory for
what was happening in the world around me. When I first arrived in the
West African nation of Mali, in 1968, I fell ill. There was an epidemic of
cerebro-spinal meningitis. I was teaching at the time and one of my stud-
ents fell ill and died of meningitis. I had malaria and then hepatitis,
and in the middle of all of this there was a coup d'etat and a radical
nationalist regime was overthrown. Several months later, there was an
attempt at a counter-coup d'etat and the swirl of events seemed to take
up my body, and those of the people around me in many cases, and it was
almost as if the pathology of the individual were mirrored in the patholo-
gy of the society."

Thierry Hentsch, Mirror: "I think that every frontier is both real and ima-
ginary and the Alhambra here in Granada is just such a place - a frontier
that has undergone historical changes which have left both very tangible
traces, like the site on which we are standing, as well as traces that
exist only in the realm of the imagination." 

In Emmanuel Levinas' "Meaning and Sense," there is this: "The beyond from
which the face comes signifies as a trace." And "In the presence of the
Other (_Autrui_), do we not respond to an 'order' in which the signifying-
ness remains an irremissible disturbance, an utterly bygone past? Such is
the signifyingness of a trace." The face is always already a process, rep-
resentation (David Marr, Vision); the disconnected Other returns vastly
interpenetrated, convoluted, porous, in Samuel's works. They should be
required reading for their questioning/problematic, as well as viewing;
the two books are based on a videotape trilogy: The Raft of the Medusa,
Into the European Mirror, and City of the Dead and the World Exhibitions,
produced 1993-95. I'd also recommend Samuel's Passage to Lahore, more or
less a novel, relevant as well to a necessarily political reading/being of
the Other.

My Tongue


I'm not so much interested any more in people speaking from the body, or
even with the fullness of the body; that seems so natural to me! I'm not
that interested in people standing in front of me or in the throes of
unbridled sexual passion, head back, animal cries emanating from a space
beyond culture and death. No, I'm not. I want etiquette, barriers; I'm
transfixed, hypnotized, by those voices that come from somewhere else,
something human, syntactic, the distanciation resulting in sexual give it
to me give it to me deeper deeper fuck me harder harder.

The glue of it all, the distance that nonetheless also issues from the
throat, from somewhere other than body, as-if it were body, and why not?
Our prejudices today encounter _this_ as body, not _that,_ with whatever
structural divisions are applied, as if feminin ecriture were a specific-
ity of encounter. It's not, Jennifer, said, it's anything at all, and it's
the anything that fascinates, the debris, the formalities, the dissua-
sions, what seems at a distance.

The distance is _impossible_ as sounds spew from the mouth; what creates
categoricities of the real producing inscription on one hand, fissure on
the other? It is speech spoken; the phallic male, underwear tight against
half-erect penis, rigid, is equally embodied, teeth and larynx all at work
- it's not the privilege or prerogative of those who claim the body for
speech or literature or writing, masculin ecriture for example, even that
of the neutered, Alan said.

The point here is that now _I'm typing,_ noise emitting from the vocal
cords, no matter what you think, no matter how this text is (de)generated. 
And a revelation that it is all body, even mathesis, that it's set up,
that it's a setup, that not even machine text fissures in a clean and pro-
per manner, cried Jennifer. 

That even the military order thrust from the gaping maw, the nationalist
song, the rhetorical putdown, the office memorandum, the fingermonger's
wharfcry, the nurse's humming, are equally embodied, that the promulgation
of body is not necessarily the body's promulgaton, screamed Alan.

beginning with the milky-white screen of monochrome laptop, milky-dark
screen of desktop loving, lapping dreams and soft pubescent skin, swollen
nipples, tiny fingers brushing against keyboard tiny rhythms, barely
denting you and you, milking dripping nipples, pink and red and brown,
erect against my tongue's tip, dreaming, murmuring, mewling, breasts heavy
in my hands, tiny in my tiny mouth, distended in my swollen lips, tearful
tiny eyes against white and brown and black skin, inhaling, sucking,
filling me up with you, tongue's indentations swelling against wet lips,
hair soaked with milk, squeezing your breasts into me, pressing against my
face, neck, cunt, ascii text spilling out white and brown and black
screens, yellow and red screens, my tiny eyes unseeing, my ears your
murmured heartbeat, your rough nipples, huge nipples, your tiny nipples,
your impossible nipples, your nipples erect and hard writing me into your
very souls, your tongue my cunt, my clit tonguing your lap, laptop,
lapping milky dreams

breast

what did occasion this breast, this breast-writing, but image after image
splayed from glowing laptop screen, analog and digital camera, video, even
the subtlety of a light glance towards the glistening surface. o empty
pane, nothing reproduces, nothing _carries_ the luminous as your milky
flesh melts within voyeur and viewer. oh it is never possible, the images
turn dark, decay, empty, vaporize; beneath the surface, the _glowing_
remains imminent, eternal. so do i write to turn the eye inward, dream you
within these sayings, glistenings, moistness glazed suspended in pure pure
                                 space
