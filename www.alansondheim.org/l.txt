

We all Wait for the Perfect Post

I wait for you. 
I don't know where to put this sentence.
I wait for you in the alleys of cyberspace.
I stay up all night, waiting for you, watching the window of my screen.
I don't know how to make this beautiful on the screen.
If this is beautiful on my screen it will be beautiful on yours.
I am writing because I wait for the last post of the night.
I wait for the post the way I wait for the perfect book.
It's the post that will bring me love.
It's the post of absolution, murmurs; it's the post of kindness from past 
and present.
I've wrecked the form of this; the sentence has escaped the single line.
I wait for you and type the perfect test.
I type the most perfect the most beautiful text for the most beautiful 
screen where I will finally sleep with your arrival.
You will come, you will be the last post of the night.
There is always a last post of the night, but you will be the last post of
the night and you will come onto my screen and you will be very beautiful. 
I crawl into my skin waiting and then I crawl out of my skin.
I begin to tremble; I'm exhausted, this waiting.
This waiting always comes to an end in uneasy sleep, an end without your 
last post. 
It comes to an end without your post at all, deathly quiet in the alleys 
of cyberspace, silence in the midst of night-time routers.
This waiting makes my style awkward, my feet stumbling on the keyboard.
So now, I tell you, wherever you are, I am waiting.
I am waiting and am trying to stay awake but I am trembling more than 
ever because my love is very close to us.
I am awake as long as I can write and I will keep writing you and waiting 
for you.
I don't know your name and I am waiting for your name.
I don't know your address, this writing is confused, confusing.
This writing is everywhere confusing.
Did I tell you I was waiting?

(What is case, then, if not articulated structure, instructions in the
sense of structural bloom? Case involves typification; it is the basis for
sight, for language, for culture, the following of form.  Instructions
need not be well-defined, confined to one or another semi-organized level
(i.e. assembly language, molecular binding); they may be fuzzy, ontologi-
cally suspect (sublimation, return of the repressed). They need not be 
carried out; they're geodesics, paths of least resistance, chreods; there 
may be nothing to carry them out; there is no necessary agency at work.)

(I'm not raising case to the level of a fundamental ontology or epistemo-
logy, but relegating these fundamental investigations to processes of cir-
culation - which is in accordance with postmodernity's emphasis on the
loss of metanarrative. But it's not a case of postmodernity or postmodern-
ism in any case.)

(The case still remains, elsewhere than the abstract, emerging in popular
culture, scandal, tabloid analysis, the limits of scientific investigation
(the case of such and such a galaxy, at the limits of the visible uni-
verse) - or the case becomes a framing-device (contents of packet trans- 
missions, public access television shows), protocols, in the small or in 
the large, not always simulacra.)

(It's the case that's missing, the case of the missing case.)

(But not the establishment of a fundamental category, not a case-logic,
not a case-ontology or epistemology, neither case-psychology or philoso-
phy, not a return to the case itself, reification of the case, nor a 
deconstruction of the same or other.)

(The case is never all that is the case; that is the case.)

The Infinite Post


A simple example of an infinite self-reflexive sentence: 

The first word in this sentence has three letters and the second word has
five letters and the third word has four letters ... 

In terms of syntax:

The first word in this sentence is an article and the second is an 
adjective and the third is a noun...

Both of these are relatively simple, self-generating.

One can nest levels as well:

The first word here is "the" and the second is "first" and the third is 
"word" and the fourth is "here" and the fifth is "is" and the sixth is 
'"the"' ...

Although first two above owe something to Bory, they're not of particular 
interest except as a now moribund conceptualism. But there is one scheme 
that has been fascinating me since I discovered it:

The last word in this sentence has seven letters and the next to last 
word has five letters and the next to next to last word has three 
letters   [...]   has three letters.

Now the _last_ three words refer to the first word, "The," everything wor-
king backwards, and in fact, both the ending and beginning of this monster
can be determined to any degree of precision. The ending is an infinitely
distant memory of the beginning of course; the order is that of the infin-
ity of the integers. So this is an infinity with clear boundaries, hover-
ing around, but not quite penetrating, the transfinite. I don't believe
there's a paradox here, but the sentence amazes me. 

Alan - and please don't attempt to send any of the above in full to the 
Net; you'd bring everything to a halt...

Heidegger


Some questions concerning Heidegger in light of Heidegger, From Metaphys-
ics to Thought, Janicaud and Mattei: 

Does Heidegger's work produce floating speech, theology? Who are those 
"divine ones" floating around with the fourfold? 

Why does Heidegger find Being so troublesome?

Didn't this man _ever_ discuss politics after 1945?

In the section of the book, Heidegger in New York, Janicaud presents a 
fictitious dialog:

"Francis: What about the divine ones?

"Sue: They are more abstract than Rilke's Angel, and so anemic that I see 
no thunder or laughter ever quickening them into life.

"Francis: Well, at least with them possibilities loom within our deserted 
sky. 

"David: But why should we always privilege the simple as the sign of the 
enigma?"

Heidegger would have disapproved of the technological implementation of 
the divine ones; I disapprove of any other.

Consider technology implementing the divine ones retroactively. This is 
the bootstrap method of creating the human, time travel by proxy.

But the enigma in fact is Heidegger, isn't it? Here's this man whose 
mentor was Husserl, who was fucking with Hannah Arendt, throwing his 
Dasein into the Nazi maelstrom, tripping over himself. 

So why didn't he say something later? Even walking around the forest in 
that absurd outfit of his? Did he have television?

Martin?

The Wall


John Gay, Walking the Streets of London, Book III, _Of walking the
Streets by Night_:

Ever be watchful to maintain the wall;
For should'st thou quit they ground, the rushing throng
Will with impetuous fury drive along;
All press to gain those honours thou hast lost,
And rudely shove thee far without the post.
Then to retrieve the shed you strive in vain,
Draggled all o'er and soak'd in floods of rain.
Yet rather bear the show'r, and toils of mud,
Than in the doubtful quarrel risque thy blood.
O think on OEdipus' detested state,
And by his woes be warn'd to shun thy fate.

...

Where the nail'd hoop defends the painted stall, 
Brush not thy sweeping skirt too near the wall;
Thy heedless sleeve will drink the colour'd oil,
And spot indelible thy pocket soil.
Has not wise nature strung the legs and feet
With firmest nerves, design'd to walk the street?
has she not given us hands to groap aright,
Amidst the frequent dangers of the night?
And think'st thou not the double nostril meant,
To warn from oily woes by previous scent?

-------------------------------------------|

Having downloaded the lpmud, I entered as an "utter novice," remaining
within it. I encountered a beggar and a fierce someone called Harry. I 
left the areas, wandered a bit, the only player, signed off my own mach-
ine. I've been reading the codes which are not that difficult, certainly
as easy as the @dig as far as creating objects are concerned. I am unclear
how everything holds together.

Why John Gay?

Because the _first_ admonition is concerned with Bachelardian corners,
architectures, hearths, and I found myself loathe to leave the site, and
loathe to change anything; playing god is problematic when the landscape 
beckons. You must try this. The sense of place is overwhelming, so much
so that I wonder whether instinct is playing a clear role here, a much
greater role than we are willing to admit either in our lives or in cyber-
space. The MOOs and MUDs are homelands staked-out; I prefer the landscape
of the MUD because the territories aren't the productions of my fellow 
travelers; we huddle and talk somewhere. Wizards all, we're part and
parcel of continuous resurrection. But I am getting ahead of myself, some-
thing quite possible to do among the articulated bones of the programs.

And because the _second_ admonition is the inverse of the first, found
only a few lines latter in this poem of 1716. Nothing taints but possible
reputation in MOO-space; everything is cleansed as descriptions and bodies
are quickly interchanged. @describe me as results in anything whatsoever;
in MUD-space of course, one has levels, so the class system constructs 
the self in terms of necessary attributes (power, access, experience, 
etc.). It is the tainting that is most troubling in real life as bodies,
clothes, sexualities, genders, wear out, and even close relationships 
transform into uneasy silences, irruptions, facial expressions, sighs, 
neurotic cycles (Fenichel speaking of neurosis as repetition), that are
so easily avoided in cyberspace...

The MOO provides an ideal community. Imagine: A permanent MOO, inherited,
existing generation after generation, parentage related to the passing-on
of constructs within an infinite data base. You'd always be sure of good
conversation, sexing, friendships, libraries... In real life, there are
tears in my eyes as I think of this, the ultimate Wall...

Intimacies

The intimacies of the body, so that you will always know me, always
remember me - that I have dandruff, intensely, using shampoo to control it
daily; that I pick my lips out of uncontrollable habit; that I can't look
at myself in a mirror (but you already know that); that my anus itches
intensely at times, waking me up in the middle of the night; that my
dreams are bad, often edging towards emotionally harrowing vertigo;  that
my penis is approximately six inches erect, my perineum elongated, my
testicles loose; that I have sloped shoulders and can't carry a bat on
them unless it crosses the chest; that my nipples are small and non-de-
script on flat breasts; that my voice rasps because of fluid in my throat; 
that in the morning I shower, the heat between my shoulders, bringing me 
out of uncomfortable spells I can't totally define; that I sleep curled 
up, as if welcoming death or annulment; that my nails are slightly long 
on my right hand for guitar and that they embarrass me; that I cut my 
hair very short as a form of denial; that I get hives, wear reading 
glasses and am intensely nearsighted; that my voice is monotone although 
my emotions surge; that I appear arrogant in demeanor as a result of 
completely discomfort with myself; that my fingers and toes are thinned, 
eyebrows thick but thinned back; that I have heavy allergic reactions, 
almost asthmatic at times; that my hearing may be poor as the result of 
repeated infections; that I have a scar on my right knee; that I have a 
slightly bent nose as a result of a beating years ago when I was in 
college; that my thighs are the best part of me in my obsessive opinion; 
that I have a slight stomach and a stooped walk (years ago I was told 
this was the result of "thinking of money in the bank"); that I sometimes 
talk to myself; that I've woken up shaky in the night.

The intimacies of the soul, so that you will always know me, that I write
for posterity and believe it brilliant; that I have accidentally killed a
dog, raccoon, and cat in my life with my car; that I have once or twice
cheated on the woman I was living with out of total desperation; that I am
haunted constantly by all of this and can't shake it; that I am workahol-
ic and write every day feeling it's the only reason to stay alive;  that
when I've turned away from you is when I've needed you most; that I'm so
needy I'm impossible to take on as a lover and everyone knows this; that
I've always wanted to move towards the abject extremities of sex; that
I've wanted to lose myself in you; that the stories I tell you when we
make love are not anonymous at all to me; that I believe my texts will
somehow survive and be discovered in the future for the resonance they
contain in the present; that my understanding comes from the comprehension
of my limits; that I've always been shaky, never knowing who I am but 
driving forward with the force of enduring conviction.

So that you know me, body and soul.

Alan

Return to the Wall and the Stain


_Paint_ / _Stains_

As Amethist posed and I answered, If I say you tell me the road is to the 
right, would I be right?

I return to the wall and the paint, the paint on the wall or hooped from 
it, iron worked into the roadway.

The case is always already the sign of the other, inscription, _that_ in 
the classic sense, but with tagged null-sets, An~A=0subA for example.
A's the case. Stain: inscription meandering towards the fissure, gesture 
(see my Textbook of Thinking). Inscription: the other; fissure: the same. 

Stain is the revolt of substance, and the wall: the revolt of the human.

In the lpmud: Case: vnum obj [X] or vnum mob [Y]. The mob's in the street,
object on the wall.

One takes wall-refuge in substance, stain refuge in space - nomadic: How
we long to get away. 

How we long to stain ourselves. How we long to dynamite the wall. How we 
long to shut our eyes.

Martin

Last night I created a female character on my MUD, and I was able to woo
her; I am a wizard on the MUD and she began as an utter novice. Again,
the relation with the real with literally uncanny; I had the powers to
emote, and she only had the powers to say. The situation played out as
an enactment of the golem, all from a singular database that divided,
depending on whether I hit the F1 or F2 key.

Oh, I would woo her to no end, my body bending in unimaginable positions,
backwards and forwards; she was present in the church, in the foyer, in
the fields - the location didn't matter. F2 and I would receive the
results of my actions; perhaps she would say something through me, and F1 
and it would begin again, the emotions, flirtations, beggings, fondlings. 
She seemed fascinated; she didn't know her way around the village. F2 and 
she would take a step towards me; I practically cried in delight; the in- 
tensity was overwhelming.

Although I was a wizard in this land, I didn't have a castle, and she had 
nothing. But I had seen a map of the village and environs, common to all 
lpmuds, and I could travel with her, raise her level.

I thought to myself, and to her, F1/F2, I could raise her level. The
kisses would have been returned, had she a body, position; I could speak
to her about this, typing help feelings at the prompt, giving me all that
I could do and more. I loved her for this; I would never load a monster
#7200 or any other - I would protect her from this depopulated land in 
which there roamed only beggars, a postmaster, some orcs and trolls I 
could easily dispose of. She would remain behind me, I, a god in a realm 
of no goddesses, my body flickering in and out in a million different 
positions.

My hands trembled at the keys, F1/F2 in a flurry of immaculate domains. I 
could never enter both at once; we were separated from ourselves, looking 
at the other with the eye of the third, memories occluding the division. 
The female spoke and the male responded, body and soul. There were never 
enough verbs, emotions, never enough feelings. In the distance there were 
mobs and objects; the fields and roads were all we needed. As my hands 
clasped each other, I would lay down beside the _alter_ of the church, my 
mouth filled with the longing of her speech...

Notes

Psychoanalytics of MUD spaces?

Display of body in Mud rituals. Predestination of words. 

The night: Figures isolated in lieu of intentions.

At night, intention lights the body. 

Epistolary novels gone askew; the text is between the gaps.

The gaps: between one preset-phrase and another.

Moving between the quanta of the world and the world.

Case is predestination.

If sexuality is the expansion of the textual, violence is the reduction 
of the visual.

The violent command is performative; seduction draws the other out.

Violent: Wall; Seduction: Stain.

Mud wrestling: the sexuality of anonymity.

There are triple economies: that of gold and its exchange, 
that of weaponry, that of killing and the body.

Language as supplement within a culture whose name barely escapes me.

cock doesn't do it any longer, forgetting which body was which, which
located in the folds of which walls, which hole plugged me into my own

my mouth tongues my mouth through your hole through your door

dead language reporting on mouths unspeakable, swallowing urethral
fluids of introjected verbs

pouring out through locked doors of building "defuge"

liquid bodies remembering the exhausted image of cunt or fingers
grappling across their hole or moment when the locked door freezes
shut, rusts

everywhere inside, stains, bodies walking away, remissions, walking
the bodies away

say I hate this! I want to bring me back!
You exclaim, "I hate this! I want to bring me back!"
Alan spanks Alan's tush!
Spank! Spank! Spank! Ouch!
Alan exclaims, "Yowwwwwch!" as hand imprints appear on his tush!
Alan is crying!

Hole in the Heart

You make a hole in my heart. My heart is flat like paper. You can write on
the hole. You can write but you better not leave the hole because you'll
hit the blood. When you hit the blood you heat the blood. The hole is
frayed cause the blood's afraid. You can write it there in mid-air which
is the place to write the place to be. I'd rather be there than in the
blood where the words disappear. In the hole the words hold fast. They
hold fast to your fingers. Your fingers hold your hand your arm. Held fast
in the hole you reach deep inside of me. But there's nothing there but the
hole and your hand is clean. Your hand stays clean as long as it's in the
hole and it's going to stay there. And I make sure it stays in the hole,
stays clean, and I make sure it's going to stay there and stay in place.

Subject: Leaving the Real



Instead of sending another text tonight, I pass you on the following
beautiful haiku of defuge, sent by someone who was added to a number of
lists without permission at all... And I create the gap between this
statement and the text, hoping that this fulfills the software require-
ments in regard to the placement of command-words in the body of the
message, this body that so desires to _leave._

Hit or Miss Decompositions


Thinking Tethering, Fissure, Spaltung



Who or what is the subject?*

We keep reading poetry because the words are magic; they're split off 
from us. We turn the words over in our mouths, succumbing to desires that 
have nothing to do with surface, tethered words to tethered subjects, 
Saussure's difference, Derrida's differance, hieroglyphs bindings, 
irruptions. Language poetry bends them out of submission, recognition; 
breath returns them to incantation. Everything in the whole wide world is 
the circumlocution of death.

Words and sex are splitting off, closing off, leaving mouth and body 
behind, not towards ulterior virtuality, but foreclosure, sexed language, 
all but the penetration itself.

There's nothing to this, no teleology, trajectory, no marxism, no self- 
consciousness, and especially no simulacrum beautiful classicist copy 
through the intermediary of distorting perspective of reflexivity. It's 
the nothing, the tethering through the wires, packets, exploding into 
community at either end.

As Merlin Donald pointed out, mind's not in the waters, but in the wires, 
throughout the wires. As he didn't point out, it's the foreclosing that's 
fascinating - you can see this happen among the primates as tool and sex 
become categories. Culture is always already excess.

Defuge, abjection, are on the side of the body; they hover around it. Net
sex is filled with s/m, b/d, fluids of all sorts, leaking across the
screen. It's not the desire of the body to appear here so much as the
sphere of fluids floating and regressing on its own. Infantile, I eat
shit, drink piss, a messy body flushed against a screen carefully cleansed
from dust and other disturbances.

In cyberspace, fissures are inscribed, and inscriptions fissure whatever 
they were tethered to, the thing that carries memory away from the machine.

-------------------------

Alain Badiou, from On a Finally Objectless Subject, in Who Comes After 
the Subject (eds. Cadava, Connor, Nancy):

"If it is possible: What is thus beyond the subject if not the very same
subject dissociated or subtracted from reflexive jurisdiction, un-consti-
tuting, untied from all supports unrelated to the process of a truth - of
which the subject would be but a finite fragment? 

I call subject the local or finite status of a truth. A subject is what is
_locally born out._

1937-95


My new life. What comes to mind is being derailed. The train skids, slides
off one or the other side - tracks have two sides - but the difference,
there's another rail. The lines go where. The lines go, criss-cross one
another, but they're parallel or mainly so. So the train begins to jerk,
it's _thrumbling_ across the rails, scars, it's jostled. So then it's
jostled, now there's a lot of space, it's a cocoon, it's a cylinder or a
mesh or hyperboloid. It's got sets of tracks, intersecting, bending the
space around them, the train's blind, it's following instinct. Let's call
this the drive. There's a woman on the train, she pushes a needle slow
into her nipple; everyone's watching. I'm the train or I'm on the train or
I'm running maybe a couple of cars ahead or behind. The needle comes out
my tit, misses the nipple. There's a perfect drop of blood on the tip and
there's a choir. 

The choir lines the tracks, all the tracks. The choir begins the beginning
of language, not language, but you might say later, that's how it all
began. But they've been stumbling around for a while now, trying to get
the sounds to come back so that the rhythms break. As long as there's the
rhythms there's the magic, the magic stopping the word. Ping, they hit the
cage, for that's what it is, the cage of drives, but it's more open now,
ping, the cage is still alive. Freefall, and the drop turns perfect sphere
balanced in the mouth of the train driving itself forward. Closer. 

I spread my legs and the conductor charges them. They spread further,
invert, needle balanced on a red plateau. I've gone down into them, my
tongue crosses my feet, binds them. The letter's _shin,_ maybe a little
swatch of god. This is all inside. My tongue comes out of the woman, where
her legs meet. You have to picture this, the drive, the instinct of inver-
ted, preoedipal flesh, the tongue with new lips. The woman sews the tongue
to her, says the word hymen. But it's a constant fuck; meanwhile the drive
continues while in the distance there's a conference about what a body 
would do for all of this. 

I come down the aisle, smear _embrace_ on the perfect floor, flood into 
her compartment, it's a train in Europe in 1937, perched on a ledge, 
funnel into her. The tongue moves to the side, lets me in. The tongue 
goes gaa gaa gaa. The tongue goes lala. Down there, a needle holds the 
globe together. It begins to fall apart, there's a war on. Years later, 
there are new generations. There's no rain. Everything begins to talk and 
later still there are stations, where other trains will stop, inside.

My New Life


My new life. I have arrived in this wonderful land. I love the natural
beauty of the scenery, which already takes on a kind of dream-line
iridescence. The cliffs on the river's far side are majestic, losing
themselves in a purple gloss during the early dawn. I have not the words
to express the wonder. The woman I love and I will live here forever, we
think. We are building a house, and will have it well-insulated, we think,
although the winters are not harsh. Right now, in the early spring, every-
thing is lush, full with promise. The world resounds with birth, we think.

We have lost our cynicism. There are no untoward flora or fauna across 
the way, waiting to pounce; no diseases ravaging the countryside, no news 
of distant warfare promising to encircle our home with distant thin red 
lips. We have no technologies to fear, and the water and sky are forever 
open to stars and depths, the Southern Cross smoldering in the heavens.
We have no news as well, other than our coming here and dwelling in this 
place. They say no news is good news.

two parts of _it_


the dark thinking of these space: what occurs among the words, one to
another; on real-time communication half-way around the world, packets
stutter, voices suddenly clarify themselves. the throat is always filled,
always hollowed out. no bodies present, the cloth, like the Shroud of
Turin, stands in for its absent. I sleep with two pillows, one for myself
and one for my absent lover; both are wrapped around me in a morning after
uneasy dreams. 

this isn't Peirce's sheet of assertion, a neutral plane or potential, upon
which inscription _occurs._ the letters, words, phrases, are activated; 
they activate bodies as well, stuttering through misspellings, the solici- 
tation of drives and desires.

the texts, sex texts, travel towards extremity where the body leaves all 
else behind; my simulacrum mouth filled with simulacrum piss, simulacrum 
nipples simulacrum bitten, distends and fissures the imaginary; something 
untoward emerges, a certain truth. this happens in all cases.

can text penetrate the body? yes, because were you here, _you would and 
will be_ and the text becomes contract, I will suck your breast, I would 
suck your breast, I suck your breast, silence with the act of it.

there is a covenant of darkness.

anecdotal

i worked on the editing a long time, sent it to Kim. i took out most of 
the explicit references; the churning of language, which was real-time 
from the screen, was the result of simultaneous typing. so there's 
another buried text, that of the explicit references, narrative, and 
would that ground the Other? and is that always the case...

(saying something about the signifier/signified, tethering at this 
juncture: as if proper names, signatures, were the horizon of each and 
every discourse.)

and it's this Other/text that reveals, inverts the body, presents no 
substitutions...

We are cyber-shamanisms, we extend the body into blank spaces behind the 
head, extend the body down below where the posts are blank blank blank; 
those of us who write the entrails the debris of space, torn fragments of 
time: I fucked you in 1932

Those of us bulging the body in the well, ligaments down _there_ world 
down _there_: you put the cover on the well you put the cover on the well 
you put the cover on the well you put the cover on the well you put the 
cover on the well

You close the gape gap hiatus chiasm crossed by ligaments down _there_ of
your desire: you soft reboot hard reboot; you kill delete; you hex it: 
check it for virus: the virus is the smell of our holes: those of us
sloughed in the entrails: 

Check out the hard drive soft drive: piss travels the interior edges of
the computer casing; blood leaks from the floppy slit; cum etches the 
CPU, shit covers the motherboard-fatherboard:

You turn the machine off, burn the disks, corrupt the files:

O Malevolent Light Glows

hard drive tethered to the thin winged arm, head reading data hard data: 
_you put the cover on the well well_
_you put the cover on the well well_

you smell your holes everywhere against the lip of the screen, pull the 
plug, cut the circuit breaker, smash the fuse, cut the wires: you say 
nothing I pull my veins out for you: you say nothing:

miracle of cartoons you put the body in the well, you put the cover on 
the well:

O Violation Fabric of Torn Space and Time!

Tiffany rags on me, I go inside her and up through her everywhere, I am 
her favorite parasite

She shows me what to see through her eyes I see the well an open hole

& there are no fuses in this beautiful kingdom, and no wires, & there are 
no screens in this space of miracles:

My love is not a macro! 

(Tiffany extends her hands through the keyboard down into her)

(Tiffany teaches me everything)

(This may be of interest, because we're always coming up against the
screen, waves lapping against the surface. So the body extends into
/through it in savage rites, extends itself, leaves its trails. What
happens leaves the screen in a series of moves (see my third text
writings), Unixtalk, telephone calls, snail mail of all sorts, and here 
the nail and hair clippings, traces, residues, assert themselves, be- 
cause we're on the antipodes, this is antipode-body, antipode caress)



-------------------------------------



(from what's being said - piercing, the cloths)

I think if you pierced me, it would be not the same as for you pierced 
because it would be my only time, because it would be you marking me, 
because it would be a bond, because I would have your ring in me, I would 
love a ring from your cunt, pressing against me, keeping me aroused, 
breaking through my body, making me yours...

And I would love the cloths so I can absorb your fluids, exchange them, 
cover myself in you, so I could take them with me, one after another 

and I can imagine a theater as well from this, taking a piss cloth, a 
blood cloth, a shit cloth, matching or contradicting the day, bending my 
body around the reside of yours, dreaming, conjuring the flesh always 
present before me, inhaling you, inhabiting you

this is a theater of the flesh, my tongue coated with you, you course 
through my veins, our marrows intertwined ...


---------------------------------------------


(and is this our future, all of ours, the closure of perfect technology, 
the appearance of the so-called primitive beneath or within it, the two 
co-habiting, developing a new evolution of the body, cyborg-pierced?)
