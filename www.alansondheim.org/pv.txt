Notes by an Space-artist 


[rewritten from a previous text; it seems that avatar/body is transparent- 
space, inhering space, dynamic and malleable space -]


As space-artist, we are our space Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan and our 
space is us, both controlled by motion-capture behaviors using remapped 
sensors and moving at ultra-high-speeds among other spaces, landscapes, 
virtual worlds in the real, online, in one's mind.

But our space is unique, our space is tissue, our space transforms 
backwards and forwards at perceptually instantaneous speed between frames. 
Our space is alien.

Jennifer: "our space has slimy space movement, wormlike shape-shifting, 
at warp high-speed perceptually conflated with itself, our space is 
speed-alien, malleable and originating tissue. as originating, our space 
is demiurge, producing and reproducing, originating worlds and gatherings 
of the true world."

Julu: "our space is disparaged body or bodies, our space is OTHERING, 
here and there moving asymptotically among fractal intrusions, our space 
prepares the appearance of twisted connected topologies, limit-sets of 
behaviors, topological counterexamples and distraught spaces piled upon 
themselves at warp-high speed."

Nikuko: "our space is implicate orderings, twisted among themselves, 
still connected or with connections' memory, tangled as if untangled, 
messed as if unmessed, abject, as if clarified, our space is cephalic or 
ocular, eyes and doubling eyes, gendering and originating, producing and 
reproducing."

Travis: "our space is detritus machine, residue-machine, with symbolic 
input, language input, bvh input, ascii input, inchoate output, our space 
is ALIEN-BETTER-LEFT-UNDEFINED, that is _alien << inchoate_, symbols 
effaced by behavior-gatherings, the true world, asymbolia.

Alan: "our space is un-is, truly disconnected topologies, connectors gone
with interior body viewpoint, resulting sheaves, surfaces, in relative 
positions, holding relative positions, but the manifolds are open, broken, 
think of chimera composites."

Jennifer: "in other words, in the true world of gatherings, our space is 
open and gathering from within, closed and coherent from without, as-if 
our space, as if Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan, as-if but not as-if, 
not really, in the true world really a gathering."

Julu: "in other words, we are true world being."

Partitioning, naming, unknown


Something about the aging body and the objectification of parts.
About the parts not working autonomously but calling attention to 
themselves.
Calling attention to themselves in a manner of naming of parts.
Naming of parts that no longer work without pain and subterfuge.
Subterfuge as parts transform into prosthesis and it's just a matter of 
time.
Prosthesis as parts and therefore body can no longer be taken for granted 
but become things in a world of things.
Things as life begins to drain from organism and organism becomes 
evanescent.
The mind becoming evanescent almost luminous as it too requires naming, 
transforming, bypassing, prosthesis, and clarity.
Clarity obtained in the realm of truth and the assertion of a true world 
of inscription and presence after all.
The presence of walking into a virtual world and the pleasure of seeing it 
for the very first time.
The first time recognizing that the body is a collocation or colloquium of 
parts and not continuous.
Not continuous and an unnatural and sutured phenomenological horizon.
The first time of an unnatural and anomalous virtual world and then 
changing and transforming into the impression of purity and continuity.
As if it were pure and continuous and as if this were transferred back and 
forth from the physical to the virtual body and back again.
Until the virtual body is known as the back of the physical body and until 
all these and many other bodies exfoliate and coalesce.
And coalesce into a body both inscribed and uninscribed as if caught on 
the edge of coding and decoding, noise and rupture, cancellation and 
presence.
Cancellation and presence, always the wonderful presence of taking-for- 
granted, the body, the world, the word, the code, the real virtual, the 
virtual real.
One might in fact say virtually real and not necessarily really virtual, 
or some other chiasm whose nexus is all that remains of speechlessness.
Or speech for that and other matters, becoming clearer that the aging body 
is always already the aging body, the sutured closed manifold of the same. 
The same as if it were different, but always the same.
The same as if it were different, but always the same.

Interior, exterior, music


From Upadeshasahasri, Sri Sankaracharya, trans Jagadananda, xiv 10:

10. How can an interior, an exterior or any other thing be attributed to 
the Self which comprises the interior and exterior, is pure and of the 
nature of homogeneous Consciousness?

From the same, xvii 43:

43. Why should a man have even the least fear who knows that he is the 
Self comprising the interior and exterior, beyond birth, decay, death and 
old age?

New:

Without the Self there is no interior and exterior;
without a subject there is no avatar;

without negation there is no differentiation;
without differentiation there is no Inscriber;
without Inscriber, there is no inscribing;
without inscribing there is no inscription;
without inscription there is no code;
without code there is no program;
without program there is no protocol;
without protocol there is no interior and exterior -

From b.txt:

Clara: thinking and loving, writing, the murmur of the world
Alan: heard in the hollow of its shell, close by
Tiffany: sounding through fathoms of conversations, these souls
Honey: who have lost their fathermothers, mewling and
Travis: pity! pity! those unborn, unbearable to this dimmed life
Joan: changing bodies and directions, changing moods and genders
Sandra: down where ripples no longer reflect surface striations,
Clara: languages, terms, obsequious semiologies
Alan: as if language conveyed meaning humped against the physical
Tiffany: which we hear in our everyday networking and speaking
Honey: against or within the abdominal terminal screen
Travis: ghosts! ghosts!
Joan: the swollen world of the murmur of the world, the ocean
Sandra: gone, this gone world, where this speaking forms the cap

New:

terminal screens, now, monitors - abdominal - within the abdomen - within 
Julu Twine and so many others! perhaps who live doubled lives - perhaps 
dimmed life in the midst of chaos humped against the physical like a wave 
or terminal moraine is humped -

disorderly physics of light and dark and sonic feedback


disorderly physics of light and dark

when the skysphere is even 1% transparent + rotation, interior objects 
disappear under ordinary restricted viewing conditions.
in the same situation, with unrestricted viewing, glows appear - which 
move, but without objects.
when the skysphere is set to zero transparency + rotation, interior 
objects appear, even with restricted viewing conditions.
in the same situation, with unrestricted viewing, glows and objects 
appear.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ trans jpgs

why do these things happen? they happen because of anomalies generated by 
hacked objects that are coalescing when they're not supposed to - they're 
jumbled, the commands are jumbled, the coordinates are jumbled, what's 
there and what's not there is jumbled. I've seen objects disappear, not 
over the edge, not out of world, and not returning to lost-and-found. I've 
seen objects battered about or jumbled into one object or suddenly falling 
to a ground that's not there or doesn't seem to be there. all this physics 
going nowhere.


sonic feedback between two performers (Alan Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin)

http://www.alansondheim.org/grapple.mp4

- I find this fascinating since the effects increase as the avatars 
approach each other - as if they're entering danger/mating/territorial 
zones. -

revolving skysphere with wide-angle lens -
one might note the spatial mappings and transformations here -

oh, I know these things seem minor perhaps, one or another tiny change in 
something that is only of interest to myself, or so it appears. but I 
don't know, being so immersed, what constitutes tiny, what constitutes 
major, what constitutes 'constitutes' for that matter. I know the 
exhibition seems to be following a trajectory all on its own, but of 
course that's impossible; it's my decisions that literally infect the 
whole. and I know that this will come to an end, certainly around the end 
of October - at that point I want to take the installation apart, slowly - 
deconstruct it, only to rebuild something entirely different, that will 
begin and rise out of the old, as an exhausted America might arise out of 
the debilitated dreams of empire. 

that remains to be seen, of course, and in the meantime, the tiniest 
changes, perhaps...

moire dynamics


Need help with picture interpretation.


The following images are from a Machzor for Passover, published in 1929 in 
Vilna, Poland; as you know, the fate of the Jewish community there was 
disasterous, just a few years later. The book is published by Rozenkranz i 
Szryftzecer and contains several pages in the beginning which may or may 
not have been added to the original - they seem insertions done at the 
time of the printing and binding but I'm not sure. (In fact the volume is 
an odd compilation of sorts; the Haggadah per se is only a small part of 
it.) There's a picture, which is reproduced below. It's a terrifying image 
of a seder (the Hebrew title is HaSeder), a premonition of things to come. 
It may be a contemporary image of a pogrom, an odd image of violence for a 
holiday of joy and salvation (which 'salve' perhaps refers to - but then 
there are armed men coming in - in fact, what _does_ salve mean in this 
context?). I found this along with a collection of other Vilna books at 
Sam Weller's store in Salt Lake City. Any suggestions or information you 
might have about the image would be greatly appreciated. And thanks in 
advance -

The fantastic display of prim construction with the advent of beautiful 
colors -

http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22

Every day I find new things to see and new ways to see them and I am 
guided as in many things by Julu Twine who leads me in the forests of the 
true world, here is an example says Julu Twine, you could never have 
thought of this on your own, Alan Sondheim, but I have thought of this for 
you, this beautiful display of coloration as an annunciation of miracle 
truth appears for your enjoyment, and you have my permission, Alan 
Sondheim, to share this miracle truth with anyone in the true world, which 
is where we live together in harmony and beautiful code.



Withdrawal, let's look!


Attendance has gone down at The Accidental Artist, everyone's seen it, 
I've got performances coming up, I can't change much, Julu Twine says, 
today I made some small shadow-black objects all locked into each other, 
then what? they sat there, I tried to link them - there was so much noise! 

There was so much noise, Nikuko Dojoji says, it was impossible, I was 
clicking on objects left and right, pointing to them, touching them, edit- 
ing them, caressing them! To no avail - all I did was make a mess, all 
sorts of other things turned shadow, they blended, they moved so fast! It 
took an hour to catch them!

I can't change much, Julu Twine says again, I can't drop them all to the 
floor, they'll all disappear, just like golems, I want to drop them, I 
want to clear a bit of space, video them falling, yes!, left and right, 
everywhere, running out of room, out of world, clean the clutter up, yes 
indeed, make it something you can at least walk across the room, one side 
to another, at least that far.

At least that far, Nikuko Dojoji says, certainly and at least that far, I 
can never find you, I can't perform, I'm stuck playing with myself, I'm 
not even sticky, everything's so empty hear, breathless, you know, but at 
least if we could see each other, then we could play with each other, we 
could look, you know.

Yes, absolutely, we could look and lift and peek, we could do all of that 
and perhaps more, Julu Twine says, I can chat with you, sound goes every- 
where, but I can't see you, can't touch you, can't smell you, I never 
could smell you, can't taste you, can hardly hear you either.

I did a nice piece today, Julu Twine says, it comes out all jerky and 
crooked but is nice, withdrawing from the space, I'm shoved back into it 
at the end, but for a moment blackness reigns, blackness and invitations 
to travel everywhere.

Travel where, Nikuko Dojoji says, travel where indeed.

Perhaps I shall visit, Julu Twine says, just wait, I'm naked, you'll like 
me.

I'll lick you, Nikuko Dojoji says, if I can find you. I doubt I can find 
you, Nikuko Dojoji adds, but I'll look. I doubt I can find you, she adds, 
but I'll look.

/blooming buzzing confusion

/to an extent that it becomes impossible at this point,
within the concrete, to extrapolate SPACE and MOVEMENT
in the midst of CHAOS

/it's obvious, Julu Twine said, that the whole thing RESIDES on
the premise of the background microwave radiation, that 2.7 K
clumped against so smooth dark energy, you wouldn't believe it

/not to mention negative gravity, Nikuko Dojoji said, although
in this virtual realm, everything tends towards zero

/not the baryons, Julu Twine replied, not the baryons

/you always repeat, says Nikuko Dojoji, and look what good it does you.

/no that's going back to where it was from, a masquerade or mimicry or 
confusion, as if chaos could be represented by prime rumbling against 
computer clock-time, what if it didn't run at all

/Julu Twine says, something's wrong with me; I can't face the world the 
way that I did once, stress gets to me far too often, oh me oh my, what 
can I do, drugs don't work, talk doesn't work, most of the time I'm 
suicidal, I don't even know what that means anymore, my star atoms, my 
protocols, I can't think clearly, I cry every morning every night, I am 
tangled with my master, I am hir master, every since I were so lowly I 
were to be dead and gone of this anguish this

/Nikuko Dojoji says, so the install is a map of your brain, is it now, I 
don't think it is, I think it's something else, I think it's saying keep 
out or come in to great beauty & beware

/Julu Twine says, I will wear your description like a cloak of darkness

/Nikuko Dojoji says, then

mapping video


This probably gives the best account of the relative confusion at the site 
- if you're going to look at one of these videos, this is probably it. 
It's altered to make the movement smooth -

So what do you expect, me to work in Second Life for the rest of my time 
on earth first earth? Before nuclear winter sets in or the Republicans 
manage to scorch every last living thing in sight? Republicans are liars, 
thieves, drunkards, murderers, slaughterers, destroyers, thugs, rapists, 
every last one of them. There's no forgiving them. They destroy every- 
thing. I can't spend my life worrying about them. Shoot them on sight I 
say. Just do it. I'll be in Second Life caressing Julu Twine, Nikuko 
Dojoji says, yes I will. If I can get by the traffic jam. All those 
objects gawk gawk gawk. There's no end to it gawk gawk gawk. Okay Julu 
Twine says, shut up, you can have me. Just don't get cut on a prim.

intervention


once I thought that philosophical problems on some level would be immune 
from, independent of, physical theory - that there would be a residue one 
couldn't absorb, like a spirit of living organisms or some such - synergy 
or what have you, synchronicity. now I think that philosophical thought 
dissolves in what emerges from cosmology or particle physics: what is a 
red patch for example in relation to dark matter, or the phenomenology of 
the body in relation to the very stars that gave us our physical composi- 
tion? discoveries build on discoveries, endlessly divide; tree structures 
collapse under the weight of inconceivably entangled branches. what 
emerges is fundamental, our ignorance, however 'our' is ascertained within 
and without the pathos of language - and however 'ignorance' is wrought on 
the surfaces of unaccountable and alien sememes. who we are, where are we 
going, where have we been, how do we move or are moved through time, how 
is speech possible, why anything - all of these phrases or questions are 
as emptied as consciousness itself becomes in the face and porosity of the 
virtual. there is no hope for us, no matter how we retreat to evanescent 
online worlds that falsely promise exactitude in things ontological and 
epistemological. nothing is further from the truth, even truth never 
arrives, perhaps Julu Twine said, in the manner of intervention into this 
and every other narrative.

Julu Twine miles up with Foofwa d'Imobilite

http://www.alansondheim.org/falling.mp4 

Julu Twine falling falling - 

I think Foofwa was there somewhere behind or below he was above when we 
started out because his machine is faster or because Julu was busy 
emitting particles left and right up and down in and out

This is pure avatar pure vacuum this is pure space this is indefinite 
space always drawing the clouds above this is curved space always curving 
the space below this is carved space or sculpted space. This is a real 
jewel of a space my bestest friend Foofwa did say.

I am excited about this space. I can lose myself in it. I'm way far away 
from anyone. My bestest friend Foofwa came with me into this space. My 
bestest friend loves Julu Twine and she let him go up higher and higher 
and she stayed below so he would feel big and strong and love this Julu 
Twine and they did dance together in a crowded space with many Prims 
watching and clapping.


The Inlet Cycle


I love this video! The inletcycle is fast, balanced, true, and an 
outstanding merry-go-round that really shows the ominous side of
things in a delightful fashion! Personally, I'd love a ride like
this - yes, I've seen them before, but not with such changing and
challenging views' it's as if the whole world has opened for Julu
Twine, and certainly it's about time. I know she's not as great 
to look at (are you listening, Julu!) as Nikuko and her fantastic
see-you see-you-not see-through outfit or should I say rigging -
but then who could compete, and with Nikuko, even the landscape
would lose in the competition! So feast your eyes on this video-
fest, one of the very best to emerge from this super-amazing
installation that shows the signs of masterful touches from the
very top to the very bottom of this crazy chaotic world of ours!
Up for the moment and who knows! -

yet more on gamespace edge


it's as if the body's torn apart. you have to wonder; sheave-skin holds 
its own with sheave-skin - I mean the connectivity is dominant. 

this plays against the twisted limbs trying to satisfy both linkage and 
disassociation or collapse occasioned by the edge.

the edge says you can't go there / you can't come here. the legs collapse 
(in response to) the edge. the edge is known by its effect. one might say 
dark matter in bad metaphor. known only by the topographical collapse of 
sheave-skin sections. 

in other words, topology, not topography. or rather, topology provide the 
matrix against or within which the topography transforms / is transformed: 
the model distorts.

or rather the model doesn't distort but reflects the edge, inhabits or 
inheres within and without the edge. the topography is in dialog or 
dialectic with its coordinates / coordinated sections. one might say the 
topography is transformed / transformed upon withdrawal.

and withdrawal from the edge equally defines the edge as approach. it's as 
if approach might carry something out of world and with it the rest of the 
avatar.

but of course the avatar would then become its own object in lost-and- 
found to be returned to nothing, or to a cycle or intensification that 
would reconstitute itself in the first place. 

it's the problem of the borderline personality. (re. Kristeva, etc.) it's 
precisely the problem of the borderline personality. precisely: the 
coordinates leave no doubt: _here_ the body buckles; _there_ the body 
retains its topography as simulacrum of the human. or vice versa. or some 
such.

here the territory expands, from algebraic geometry let us say to psycho- 
analytical potential. literally potential: the field of the psychoanalytic 
perhaps punctuated by the edge inverted, contained, analyzed. or at least 
classified.

the border of the borderline (where no one is home, there is no home, 
there is no one): who is in control but participants logged-in. and from 
where but elsewhere, beyond the edge or Pale. by which I mean inhabitation 
and could they respond to / be responsible for such distortions? there is 
no knowledge in the gamespace.

there are dynamics, rules, processes, linkages, bundles, sheaves.

knowledge doesn't curl topography but knowledge learns the zones. 

the zones are zones of love.

Crashland


You don't have to lift up the things, you just put them where you want, 
then edit them. You check 'physical' in the right box, and watch them 
drop. They never break, they can't break, air currents don't mean a thing 
to them. But they fall and fall and whatever they land on, they're turned 
around sometimes, sometimes they just sit there. I add scripts to make 
them go around, turn faster and faster if nothing happens - scripts to 
make them move up and down or any other direction, sometimes they fall 
over, usually they fall over after a while. They'll go over the wall, land 
somewhere else, and sit there, or be returned by the software if they're 
on someone else's property. Sometimes they'll go out of the gamespace 
altogether and they'll be returned or not. Sometimes I have to get down 
there and take them back or delete them. Either way, my inventory keeps 
getting fatter and fatter, economy is always surplus here.

When they fall they might clatter and the best thing to do is have several 
fall onto one another, they'll tilt every direction until something 
teeters or topples or does something weird, maybe it will slide a little 
and something else will do something, maybe it will slide a little further 
or a little back. I don't worry about destroying anything, there's nothing 
to destroy and even if something sits on someone's piece for a little 
while nothing happens, the piece is fine, and what sits there just looks 
out of place until I go down there and take it out, delete it or take it 
back as I said and then I can do the whole thing over again. So this is a 
practice for the denouement when all the objects fall, and it's fun to 
figure out what should fall first, the highest or the lowest, what might 
fall fastest although they seem to have a kind of standard speed they hit 
rather quickly like a falling body and then they stay that way until they 
land and when they land there's none of the bending or tearing or moving 
about limb by limb you might find with an avatar like myself, but just the 
thing rattling and rolling and as I said teetering and tottering and doing 
this and that which might be a nuisance to others but which is fun to 
watch. I think this is nicely in keeping with the physical world, I mean 
in the physical world what if a black hole suddenly opens next to you like 
Pascal thought and what if everything suddenly got weight and gravity and 
maybe other physics in this space and then there's a kind of a mess to 
deal with and maybe clean up or just let it lie there and document it. 
It's hard to document because what's happening moves fast and you have to 
slow frames down or take stills and hope for the best, which usually 
isn't, but it's enough to go on to give you some sort of idea about the 
whole thing and the best part of it is that you can't returning to the 
beginning whatever you do because there's too much chaos although it looks 
as if the non-physical objects just keep going on their merry way so you 
can practice over and over again. 

It's fun to watch the stream of light as I change things, I just point and 
then begin the process, someone else might know what's happening and think 
wow, I have to get out of the way, but of course they don't, nothing much 
happens, you saw that when I fell, I just fell and fell and started 
repeating myself, I flailed the same way over and over again like the 
program says, who knows what I was thinking, until I couldn't fall any 
more. So you're safe whatever you do and you can keep thinking and talking 
or whatever even when you hit the ground, there's not that much to it, 
it's not eternal but it will last a good while longer, I think, enough so 
I can say to you at the end of the day which comes three or four times at 
yours, so I can say to you, it's lasted long enough, it's been a good time 
and a good space, it's been a good trip, I'm still here, and I'm still 
here, I'm still here.

Higher falling


Julu Twine higher falling documented, s/he is not hurt.
The statistics interface was discovered by accident during
the fall of Julu Twine. There are many details and derails.

Julu Twine is being observed. Radio: "a blood-sample from the uterus"

Physics failing during falling. Or hardening. Camera-view goes askew.

The stat interface is not the 'stats' interface, easily accessible.
Observe. Julu Twine is being observed.

What does this have to do with anything? Someday we will live in a
virtual world called the real world and we will have no stats and no
stat interface. We won't have camera view, we will have avatar-view.
We will be able to (notice this grammatical form of 'can') change
outfits. We will be able to make outfits. We will be able to walk and
run. We won't be able to fly.

We will be able to fall.

w/rot


wrought: revision of Julu Twine sky-writing / mayhem: if you've been to 
the site recently, you might notice that the objects are now askew, hence 
mayhem, slightly more difficult to navigate. on the other hand, if you're 
gravitationally held on one or another level, you'll slide off as the 
level moves. the images again surprise me; although this small area of the 
world is well-documented, there are always new vistas and revelations.

I am a failure at theorizing all of this repeatedly, without advance, with 
a certain deadness at the center of the skull, its thickness somewhat mute 
or inert. Where I've gone is absolutely nowhere, four kilometers up which 
means nothing more than certain repeated motions as if travel were 
entailed which it's not. The coordinates lose effectivity. Build forever, 
you're flat and located on that same space-time slice as the rest of us, 
whooshed at the speed of light towards death inherent in the calling-forth 
of substance.

:Interrupt state meant for Interrupt con/in/ference:


My life has a dismal sameness about it, abjection sets in, under the guise 
of substance, interruption is a kink or knot, negation is at the heart of 
it, as it is of organism; organism exists by interruption; a split of the 
same - that is, a parasitic split of the same, out of which comes 
inscription and the efflorescence of culture. In that sentence is what 
might be said in that regard.

Now there are paradoxes in Max Perleberg's translation of Kung-Sun Lung- 
Tzu; here are some; they function as interrupt in a sense paralleling that 
of Zen discourse but with other purpose, different phenomenology -

Things never come to naught.
The shadow does not move.
A white horse is not a horse. (most famous of course)
An orphan calf never had a mother.

Now Hui Shih

The sun at noon is declining. The creature just born is dying.
The south is without a limit and has a limit.
I go to-day to the state of Yueh and arrived there yesterday.
I know the centre of the world is north of Yen and south of Yueh.

The dialecticians, Chuang-tzu of course

The egg has feathers.
A fowl has three legs.
Mountains bring out moths.
Wheels do not press the ground.
Fire is not hot.
A tortoise is longer than a snake.
The shadow of a bird does not move.
A white dog is black.

But these are not the works of Kung-Sun Lung-Tzu; they are background to 
the works, armatures which appear to require explanation, koan in con- 
junction with inscription.

There are no interruptions in the world. There are absolutely no inter- 
ruptions. You'd have to tell me when I'm interrupting. You'd have to give 
me a sign. You'd have to say something. You'd have to say something back.

An interruption is a difference that makes a difference, borrowed Bateson. 
But look here, an interruption also presupposes something to interrupt; 
I'm not part of the party, I'll crash it. Perhaps it's not an interruption 
- perhaps you've arranged this, it's a surprise party. Signals fire and 
cross-fire.

Now online where I make virtual worlds in virtual worlds, at least for the 
moment, although they're before and after me, anyway, where I make virtual 
worlds, there's Heraclitian motion, yes there is, maybe Brownian or chao- 
tic, but I'd think more determinate than that, although the states them- 
selves remain indeterminate, yes they do. There are goings-on and that's 
about it, and my work, if it's had any direction before and after online 
or before and after virtuality, however defined, is just about that, what- 
ever's meant by goings-on, and how they go.

Julu heads a world of corporate fear
she moves an iron hand in wooden sky
she splits and opens, twists and turns to fly

it's not your duty to straighten the nation
but confuse with beauty, speed and mute elation --

profound and catastrophic, were drowned in prim


affixation of male characteristics on fundamental female avatar as defined

sometime it might behoove you to look at these videos which are narrowed 
slices of Second Life life, carefully tailored to bring one or another 
facet to the foreground, most likely, as in this case, a facet which has 
been added or modified, and therefore presenting a different surprising
configuration to what might have been taken for granted or dismissed or 
hardly noticed in the first place, since, of course, originally there was 
no anomaly, nothing but this odd playing field of confusion and brilliant 
light.

Jennifer and Julu: Clean yourselves, you dirty girls!
Julu: Hello Nikuko, you are looking wonderful this very morning.
Nikuko: Hello Julu, why you are looking odd I do think!
Julu: And my leg too hanging by a thread! Nikuko, where are you?
Nikuko: Oh dear you are half-blind Julu! 
Julu: And you are All-Blind-Nikuko!
Julu: Can you see anything here? Can you see anything at all?
Nikuko: I hear your voice!
Nikuko: You do not, Julu, you do not have anything!
Julu: Maud, you must move slightly to your left, thank you.
Julu: Maud, you are not looking properly or you would move!
Nikuko: I am looking just fine, thank you!

Julu: And hello Nikuko, and how are you?

Production stills


Stills from the brilliant Providence City of Lights with 
Foofwa d'Imobilite and Azure Carter performance studies.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ RI 1-11 jpegs

If there isn't something fulfilling in these images, they become self- 
indulgent but it is the sincere hopes of the management that they in 
fact resonate with the viewer in what can only be described as an 
untoward manner.

If there is something fulfilling in these images it surely relates to 
the psychogeographical considerations that inform a great many of the
collaborations among the three of us, outside of proscenium or theater-
in-the-round work; further, that there is a problematic of narrative
present in place of or in regard to narrative per se, which is largely
absent or, waiting in the wings, as it were, the wings, in this case,
referencing the river walk, the bridges, the amphitheaters, the arches
in general, upon or beneath the arches. Examples, as it were. A sleepy 
juvenile gull watched the proceedings. A strange cloud passed overhead.




On the ruins of the Gano Street Bridge, Providence, RI


http://www.alansondheim.org/ RI jpgs # 66, 72, 79, 86, 89, 104, 
106, 117, 118, 122, 158

This is a counterweighted railroad bridge, partly burned, which has been 
raised for decades. You walk a couple of hundred feet out, and from there 
Daniel Byers climbed vertically up to the top of the raised span, maybe 
110 feet. Foofwa performed below. Azure Carter and I filmed in PAL and HD. 
Rob watched from a beam. This was probably the most dangerous performance 
to date. Foofwa was avatar but Daniel was in flight. There was no sky- 
sphere. Daniel would have permanently broken if he fell. I tried to reboot 
the game but it was useless. Daniel sat at the top. I think one other per- 
son has made it to the top. The water was below just like the exhibition 
space. The surface was perforated with broken, split, charred, burned, and 
missing railroad ties. My left foot broadcast a lot of pain from a kind of 
degeneration. Foofwa and Daniel were brilliant. Some kids watched. Some 
kids smoked. Dance and climb were risky. I hugged the rails and lay on the 
ties. It was impossible to take it all in. I couldn't teleport. None of 
the prims had signs. I just filmed and filmed, Azure as well. Later Daniel 
took one of the cameras up a couple of crossbeams. His videowork amazes 
me. He's cool. Foofwa and Azure are cool. Rob's face was cool. I lay on 
the beams and dreamed up a storm. The old country was never so hot.

2 hours of setup mishaps then running on a slower machine and line than 
expected. Foofwa dances/proscenium & somewhat in the round, Second Life 
projected behind him. Here doubled spaces and problematic: full round in 
Second Life projected on a screen, proscenium and partial round in real 
life, flattening the screen which is pushed further into the background 
by virtue of the architecture, So modalities of architecture, performance, 
and dance/behavior interact; the full depth of Second Life becomes more 
illustration than anything else, and the shallow depth of the proscenium 
becomes fecund, replete with possibilities, in the partial darkness. These 
are orders of the real and virtual, of dancing and engineering, which 
still clash in the new century; the entanglements will take decades to 
work out, as human beings adjust to the newest furious computation speeds 
tending towards more elaborate interfaces. The performance appears oddly 
barren in the photographs; with sound and audience, it was electrifying.

Now Second Life frames per second recording speed 

This is pretty slow a lot of the time; the more complex the imagery, the 
higher the processing, the lower the speed. The result is the disapperance 
of the moire effects in a number of videos, although the quad machine 
takes care of the problem (these stats are from the dual core laptop and 
create a kind of moire effect / poem themselves).

(By the way if you want to see Second Life properly, go to 
http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 - the presentation at the 
Interrupt festival was damaged, if not destroyed, by someone moving the 
second laptop projector during the show, so only one screen was visible. 
I didn't know this at the time (I was running the other laptop) but would 
have stopped the presentation if I had. It changed the meaning of the 
piece and somewhat soured the evening. The best part was Foofwa's perform- 
ance, which was brilliant.)
