Current work on Empyre email list
For me, this ties into issues of pain and wounding, in relation
 to fast-forward social media processing.
And this ties further into issues of human representation in
 the real and the virtual.

For empyre - ISIS, Absolute Terror, Performance -

The world seems to be descending into chaos of a qualitatively 
different dis/order, one characterized by terror, massacre, 
absolutism. Things are increasingly out of control, and this 
chaos is a kind of ground-work itself - nothing beyond a 
scorched earth policy, but more of the same. What might be a 
cultural or artistic response to this? How does one deal with 
this psychologically, when every day brings new horrors? Even 
traditional analyses seem to dissolve in the absolute terror 
that seems to be daily increasing.

We are moderating a month-long investigation on Empyre into the 
dilemma this dis/order poses. We will ask a variety of people to 
be discussants in what, hopefully, will be a very open 
conversation. The debate will invite the empyre community to a 
deep and uncomfortable analysis of abject violence, pain, 
performance, and ideology [taking further the October 2012 
debate on Pain, Suffering, and Death in the Virtual], looking at 
the ambivalences of terror, incomprehensible emotions, and our 
own complicity in the production of 'common sense' around 
terror.

We are all facing the anguish of 
political situations that seem out of control. We are interested 
in topics such as, How does one deal with anguish personally? 
How can anguish be expressed culturally? Can such expressions 
make a difference at all? We have all read political analyses of 
the causes of this descent; here, we're interested in the 
cultural and personal responses to it.


ISIS, Absolute Terror, Performance


Lyric poetry begins, not end, with Auschwitz; the very violence 
and terror produced by slaughter places the statement under 
erasure. But lyric, poetics, poesis, are among other things 
subversions of language, the recognition of a linguistic weight 
that bypasses the syntactic, caresses the abject. So that one 
might drive poetics through the force of terrified flesh, one 
might find language springing there, just as unutterable pain 
may be surrounded by the cacophony of elegy and mourning.

Lyric poetry begins with nothing; poetics scrapes away at 
lateral fluency, undercuts the corporate, only to die in the 
advertising slogan. But Auschwitz is a borderland of time, where 
end and annihilation are imminent, imminant, and I keep think of 
this in relation to absolute terror, wailing postulations 
against the wall that also disappear. Absolute terror, the 
performative of beheadings, genocides, and crucifixions, signs 
the performative of the end-time itself. It is not a question of 
the inerrancy of the text leading the torturers on; it's the 
errancy of any text in the face of decapitation; every world is 
ultimately unutterable.

It's the unutterability of the world that founds anguish, that 
tears momentarily at the soul and body under erasure. It this 
which I've been wrestling with for years, only momentarily 
handed off to ISIS and this and other geopolitics. How does one 
live within the knowledge of annihilation? How does one produce 
within such, in response to such? What is the conceivable 
meaning of such production? Is meaning itself obliterated to 
such an extent that even suicide becomes a useless act?

What of anguish? What of 
inconceivable torture? What of a planet tending wildly towards 
overpopulation, extinctions, local wars, starvations, all 
producing despair, breakdown, anomie? In other words - how does 
one sleep at night?

Logic of Universal Terror

[for all]X (not X --> 0)
Therefore not X is taken to 0 (null set)
Therefore not X is always already processed to 0
Therefore not X is equivalent to 0
Therefore not x is identical to 0
Therefore X --> V (universal set)
Therefore X is always already processed to V
Therefore X is equivalent to V
Therefore X is identical to V


X doesn't equal not-X. The world divides and hardens between X 
and not-X; it's a classical division so that the intersection of 
X and not-X is the null set. What I'm trying to present is the 
idea of an expulsion and an annihilation of what's expelled. 

EXPANSION BY FORCE AND TERROR

FORCE = TERROR
WORD = NOTHING

Facing, what -

If we face evil, comprehend it, examine it, watch those videos,
does that reduce us to catatonia? Does that empower us to act? 
Does it reduce us to fear and trembling, to terror?

It's not enough to say, this is the way the world has always 
been; the world, now, is not as it has always been.

Or is it enough to insist on the long lens, reach, of history, 
to insist that the past itself will teach us, that we can learn 
from it's - our - "mistakes"?

Another approach - this has nothing to do with us; this is the 
work of a miniscule number of people; this is the work of the 
made, the depraved, criminals; this is the work of the lost; of 
the disenfranchised; of this or that group. But is this not also 
our group, isn't there, yet, the shade of Adolf Eichmann, the 
normalcy of evil? Then what is this?

Or this is for or against or the result of, neoliberalism - but 
this has always been with us, this resides within us, this 
defines us, at least a part of us.

Or that this is the result of social media, of technologies 
that spread everything everywhere, this is the result of the 
disseminated messenger. But social media, oral histories, 
ballads, newspapers, tablets, rumor, gossip, languagings, have 
also always been with us.

Or that ethology plays a role, sociobiology, that this is part 
of our primate heritage, that we may or may not overcome. Yes, 
and then what?

At the heart of all of this - absolute violence and anguish,
textual and oral inerrancies, symbolic acts and always 
totalization, the violence inherent in language and its 
recoding of histories.

At the heart of _all_ of this, death, and the erasure of death.

negative theology


"The end approaches, now it's too late to tell the truth about 
the apocalypse. But what are you doing, all of you will still 
insist, to what ends do you want to come when you come to tell 
us, here now, let's go, come, the apocalypse, it's finished, I 
tell you this, that's what's happening."

Derrida, Of an Apocalyptic Tone Newly Adopted in Philosophy, in 
Derrida and Negative Theology, ed. Coward and Fosbay, 1992


[...]"Amery argued, was that torture destroyed the world as the 
sufferer previously knew it. One of the most 'fundamental 
experiences of human beings', he observed, was the 'expectation 
of help': hot-water bottles, cups of tea, analgesics are 
routinely given to those in pain. In contrast, 'with the first 
blow from a policeman's fist, against which there can be no 
defense, and which no helping hand will ward off, a part of our 
life ends and it can never be revived'."

(Joanna Bourke, The Story of Pain, quoting Jean Amery, At the 
Mind's Limits.)


================================================

I work with virtual wounded and/or deceased avatars, examining
their problematic relationship to illness, melancholy, mourning,
wounding, and death in the physical world; the result is a
series of performances in Second Life and OpenSim (virtual
worlds), texts (both literary and theoretical), and real/virtual
installations. In order to do this, I create modified avatar
animations which are projected into physical space for live
performance; these are made from altered motion capture
equipment in order to create 'inconceivable' and alien avatars,
movements, and environments.

I emphasize the political and cultural/physiological dimensions
of wounding/slaughter within and without the cleansed landscapes
of social media and virtual worlds. Conceptually, I'm concerned
with returning the virtual to the real, indicating that more is
at stake in the former than 'just manipulation' of avatars. I'm
involved in a critique of technophilia through these concerns
- in particular, the phenomenology of abjection in relation to
both analog and digital realms.

1. Who am I? New media artist who works with virtual worlds, electronic 
literature, and musical improvisation. I'm particularly interested in the 
relationship of the digital "clean screen" and issues of abjection - 
dirtiness, wounding, ecstasy, and distortions, of avatars and real flesh. 
In other words, what lies beneath the surface.

2. I've used motion capture as a way of creating images, 3d printed 
objects, virtual world avatars and performances, and live choreographies - 
by distorting the mocap "chain" which goes from live performer to computer 
file to an avatar representation based on that file. (Illustrate hand 
gestures)

3. The chain can be altered in several ways: 

a. by remapping motion capture nodes across the body.

b. by remapping mocap nodes across several bodies.
commodius.mp4 mocaps.mov 322harness.mp4 (w/still)

c. by reworking the mocap software itself so that it uses dynamic or 
behavioral filters that transform the avatar representation by 
transforming the files as they are collected. (Illustrate hand gestures) 
(Example)

d. by moving the performers out to the edge of the game-space itself - 
edge_6.avi - move cursor to relevant portion

4. The results can be:

distorted avatar movements in video: WolfTC.mov sports.mov noOne.mov

live performances in Second Life and mixed reality media (Example) 
anything in the SL folder

3d printed objects: 3d stills folder

choreographies with Foofwa d'Imobilite: duetavatargrange involuntary

5. Why?

How to confound the digital with the abject - with issues of pain, 
wounding, death, ecstasy.

How to dis-embed the embedded news media - in other words, how to reveal 
the deaths of soldiers and civilians around the world, in spite of or 
through digital media. Of course avatars can't do that, but they can 
resonate with the slaughter that occurs in the real - rather than 
constantly resonating with the virtual slaughter that occurs in video 
games. Get rid of the radical disconnect.


Visual data representation - empathetic identifications - the mocap work
social experimentation - four dancers into one avatar for example
psychological experimentation - "reading" the modified avatar -
 identified as human or organism?
 identified as wounded or dancing?

Difference between unutterable pain and its (external) representation, and 
utterable programming of its (external, at a double remove) 
representation.

I'm interested in human representation within the virtual; this implies 
both an image and a dynamics, the two of course entangled.

1. We recorded one or more performers, using remappings of modes, 
including some with 'impossible' topologies, in terms of human movement; 
and

2. We recorded, through a rewriting of the motion capture software itself, 
through what I've called 'dynamic filtering,' transforming standard motion 
capture files on the fly, through the insertion of filters between the 
input data and the outputted files. These filters parallel the use of 
filters in Gimp or Photoshop [explain].

Endproducts - the altered motion capture files were fed into three worlds:

1. The Blender 3d modeling program, where abstract avatars were used to 
examine how behavior appears when it's abstracted from the body;

2. The Poser mannequin modeling program, where the motion capture files 
were used to 'break' the mannequin bodies, as well create any number of 
videos; and

3. Works in Second Life and OpenSim virtual worlds which involved highly 
distorted avatar performances and dances; these were used for live or 
mixed reality performance, some augmented reality work, some video work 
for conferences, gallery or museum installations, and some pieces made for 
live or online choreographies. The ultimate goals of the virtual worlds 
work were - what happens when the body is considered completely plastic; 
what images of pain, death, wounding, or sexuality are conjured up by 
distorted bodies; when does the body become a 'thing' among other things 
in the world; what are the politics and anthropology of distorted avatars 
and movements - if any.

Three years ago, Patrick Lichty enabled me to use the highly sophisticated 
motion capture equipment at Columbia College, Chicago; here, we didn't 
modify any software (we had neither the expertise nor permissions!); 
instead, we worked closely with remapping the body in relation to the 
30-40 markers that were placed on the body suits. This is where everything 
becomes interesting, I think, since we were able to map up to four 
dancers/performers into a single avatar output. It was difficult to do 
this because the software tended to stop working and 'glitch' the avatar 
into a somewhat inert Buddhist image when it could no longer make sense of 
the input. But we were able to create complex movements, and one technique 
stood out - the 'hive' technique or social avatar 2.0.

The usual mappings we did involved a single performer with the body nodes 
remapped on him or her. So there was a topology involved; the hip was 
usually the stable or root node. In West Virginia, we started using two 
performers; this is what can happen: [demo the torsion/twist]. When I was 
in Chicago, I was able to work with four performers, two on trapezes, all 
choreographed into a single avatar - and all capable of watching the 
results of their movement on a screen. So we tried:

1. Moving the avatar in utterly untoward ways, so that the result was a 
limping or broken avatar; and

2. Moving the avatar in utterly normal ways, which meant distorted 
movements on the part of the live performers. This was fascinating since 
it resonated back to the performers, who themselves were twisted in their 
movement. It was amazing choreography, created to 'normalize' the 
equipment output.

Foofwa and returning the avatar movements to 'real' life. [examples, 
explanation.] The 'smearing' of divides between real and virtual, each 
borrowing from, and resonating with, the other.

[Examples]

Note that with all of this, there are no programming errors, only other 
avenues, glitches, to be explored. So the aesthetics and phenomenology of 
glitch are important here as well. In virtual worlds and with motion 
capture, there are in particular 'edge' glitches - within and without 
gamespace boundaries - that define, in a sense, _all_ the possibilities of 
the avatar, _all_ the possibilities of escape and normalcy...

The imaginaries I work with - virtual worlds; 3d modeling; 3d printing; 
very low frequency (VLF) radio; scanner and shortwave radio; augmented 
reality; playing music; codework (an entangled amalgam of code, writing, 
and computer 'debris'; even birding, which requires abstractions ranging 
from migration routes to morphs.

Finally, the idea that the virtual has always been with us, that the body 
is always already inscribed, that culture goes all the way down, that 
inscription and the digital are entangled amalgams as well, and that 
abjection underlies everything, as well as pain, suffering, and death, all 
part of it.

Background as Performance

The same ground of horror repeats itself, day after day, night after night,
no longer events or news, so much as a background of horror. Then what? A
serious question: How can art, art performance, performance, heal, help
one make it through the day, inspire one, against this background of
continuous performance, where everything, lives, cultures, languages, are
at stake? We watch other species world-wide going extinct (the rate is
something like several an hour), we find ourselves on the verge of a
planet so violated that the environment (cultural, global) might well
collapse (yes, into something else) within the century, and we perform?
Three nights ago, we did just that, perform from our last two cds at a
place in Brooklyn, and we were brilliant for that moment, then the horrors
take over again. (Personally I don't think ego plays a role in this, and
personally as well, Buddhism has failed me, or vice versa.) I won't post
more headlines like these again, and apologies for doing so; this is the
raw world, perhaps at its worst.

There are two backgrounds: This, above, and the Internet of Things  they
come together in hacking and cyberwar See http://map.ipviking.com/ .
