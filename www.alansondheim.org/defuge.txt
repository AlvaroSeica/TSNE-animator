

The Defuge Rhyme


The word itself, the hymen or division which splits: Re: hymen, incapable 
of division. But rhyme returns, not the recall of memory, but reinforce- 
ment subjugating anomaly itself. That is, turning the language of the 
poem into sound, for which it materializes, that is, fetishizes, placing 
the semantic core in an inverted relationship to cybermind - where syntax 
is fetishized as the bones of the dissolute body.

Within neural networks, I think of rhyme as reinforcement, the construct 
of a gate to language resonating uncannily with the absence of meaning. 
So it binds meaning to the abyss, floods the body of language (posturing 
contractually against the rim of rhyme/chora, one would say a situation 
of bondage and domination). The mind learns the poem, defuses it; rhyme 
partakes of the exhaustion of pornography, turning-away from the image 
after its consumption. 

Such a turning-away is common, fetishization transformed into discard,
disgust, the image no longer working, _that_ body used up in masturbation. 
It is so common that a word is necessary here, the _defuge,_ defuse/refuge
deluge/refuse, de-light, de-flower. Rhyme patterns, frames, defuges; it 
is the defuge that draws the poem forward beyond return, the sonnet to 
the final couplet.

Rhyme materializes, and the materiality is subject to defuge, carrying
semantic content on its back. Defuge is a laying-waste, and it is not too
much to think it _through_ materiality, the gainsaying of substance,
effluvia. It is the substance in pornography that defuges;  there is a
constellation pornography/fetishization/rhyme, rhythm a stride or
measuring of substance against the body itself. The repetition of rhyme 
measures rhythm which of course is a return through a demarcation; such a 
return is the defuge of time, the striations of the medium as well. 

Defuge is the tumescence of substance within representation. "All objects 
are objects of loss." I am at a loss to account for defuge, these repe- 
titions, consumptions, exhaustions, laying-to-waste, discardings. It is 
not a question of novelty, but novelty plays a role. It is not a question 
of fetishization, although these half-way markings bridge sites in the 
unconscious. In pornography, it is the image on the level of the symbolic 
that materializes, that is devoured; in rhyme, it is the substance itself 
which unconsciously appertains to the unconscious. In pornography, the 
auto-erotic forecloses upon the image, which bears witness; in rhyme, 
neural networking frames and forecloses the substance of language. Rhyme 
bears witness as well, to the subtle fragility of language which subli- 
mates its sonic basis: the symbolic resides as a simulacrum upon, or 
articulated within/by, this material. 

Defuge produces the material as imaginary. Defuge is also located: in the
rereading of a novel which has never been finished; at the height of an
argument in which the trajectory appears as foreclosure; in Sartrean
nausea; in outmoded fashion; in expectorated fetishes; in rhyme upon
rhyme, Skelton's work for example. _Too much_ rhyme makes one uncomfor-
table, as too many exposed genitalia; a sweet, ruptured sickness, emerges,
and the decay of bodies is not far behind. (And just so, Emily Dickinson's
poetry is always near the abyss, near total collapse, the fragility of a 
feather.)

(Defuge is also fueled, in late capitalism, by fast-forward driving of the
commodity structure; consumption becomes introjected, always already con- 
spicuous, a matter of _sight_ lending itself towards _site._ But it is 
perhaps more interesting to think of the commodity structure as fueled by 
defuge, the circum-stantiation, circumlocution of the abyss: and too much 
talk, too much theory, is a primary example...)

Defuge ii


Stephen Crane (Maggie, A Girl of the Streets): "A tall young man, smoking
a cigarette with a sublime air, strolled near the girl. He had on evening
dress, a moustache, a chrysanthemum, and a look of _ennui,_ all of which
he kept carefully under his eye. Seeing the girl walk on as if such a
young man as he was not in existence, he looked back transfixed with
interest. He stared glassily for a moment, but gave a slight convulsive
start when he discerned that she was neither new, Parisian, nor theatri-
cal. He wheeled about hastily and turned his stare into the air, like a 
sailor with a searchlight."

There is the exhaustion that _lends itself to death,_ the exhaustion of
the libertine, the implicate of fascism as well. (See Pasolini on Huys-
mans' A Rebours.) The consumption of fascism releases itself. In another
turn, the _fan_ releases him or herself in relation to the rock or film
star, who appears possessed within the imaginary, mediated by the symbol-
ic; no amount of information or memorabilia is ever enough, and each new 
item displaces the old. One can speak of _the motility of the fetish on 
unstable feet._

And here is Edna St. Vincent Millay's translation of Baudelaire's Spleen 
II which begins in French with:

"J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mille ans."


The Sphinx

I swear to you that if I lived a thousand years
I could not be more crammed with dubious souvenirs.

There's no old chest of drawers bulging with deeds and bills,
Love-letters, locks of hair, novels, bad verses, wills,
That hides so many secrets as my wretched head; -
It's like a mausoleum, like a pyramid, 
Holding more heaped unpleasant bones than Potter's Field;
I am a graveyard hated by the moon; revealed
Never by her blue light are those long worms that force
Into my dearest dead their blunt snouts of remorse.
- I am an old boudoir, where roses dried and brown
Have given their dusty odour to the faded gown,
To the ridiculous hat, doubtless in other days
So fine, among the wan pastels and pale Bouchers.

Time has gone lame, and limps; and under a thick pall
Of snow the endless years efface and muffle all;
Till boredom, fruit of the mind's inert, incurious tree,
Assumes the shape and size of immortality.

Henceforth, O living matter, you are nothing more 
Than the fixed heart of chaos, soft horror's granite core,
Than a forgotten Sphinx that in some desert stands,
Drowsing beneath the heat, half-hidden by the sands,
Unmarked on any map, - whose rude and sullen frown
Lights up a moment only when the sun goes down.


(I love the Millay-isms or Americanisms of this translation, doing 
violence and recuperating something as well.)

Spleen, like boredom, figures into defuge; both play a role in Salo, in 
Sade, demarcating the libertine for whom freedom has become a paste of 
bodies, and for whom inscription has transformed into smears. Defuge 
occurs within the memory of memory, and it is not the boredom, but the 
nausea associated with the exhaustion, that is of interest, this turn- 
ing away in relation to the abject. The premise or promise of the porno- 
graphic image disappears during singular masturbations; it strikes of 
failure, of the consumption of flesh. I would not be surprised to find 
flesh consumed in each and every one of these cases, and perhaps the 
materiality that defuge operates through is ultimately cannibalistic. 

Here is Pasolini on Des Esseintes: "The mechanism of Des Esseintes is the
mechanism of an anti-bourgeois bourgeois who commits suicide by destroying
himself through an excess of his own culture. He finds himself in a moment
of history in which the genealogical tree of bourgeois typology separates
into two great trunks: at the base of one of these trunks you find the
signpost bearing Hitler's name, at the base of the other you find the sign
pointing to 'hippies.'" (Quoted in Naomi Greene, Pier Paolo Pasolini,
Cinema as Heresy.)

And finally, defuge, from my Disorders of the Real: "Form, thrust away. 
For a moment. For a minute. For a second or longer until in full it falls,
cut off at the quick. Cut off at the bone. To char: it rolls on the
ground, without limbs; it moves against itself as bag splits within bag as
the speech holds forth because of (on due account) the split tongue
expelling its swollen particles of speech. Damned, as if something _was._
As-if _was._ No farther as tube rolls, suffocates: no farther as the
lungs corrode, body inverts, bag fills with faeces, all manner of the
outer airs. He gave himself airs: which means, he pretended he _was._ That
verb which has no right _to be._"

Defuge iii: the impasse


Defuge: involving disdain, trashing, embarrassment, turning-aside, humil-
iation, the loss of fetishistic power. 

In the pornographic image, the man or woman no longer offer themselves; 
their materiality becomes manifest: alterity.

It's as if masturbation or diegesis exhaust their content, and wouldn't 
this imply the defuge of narrative?

I've reached an impasse here. At what order does explanation operate? 
Within the neural network, overkill and increasingly tight frameworking 
(as in too many rhymes) creates networks with limited bandwidth; on the 
level of the symbolic, the assertion of alterity cuts into secondary 
narcissism, and the subject finds himself or herself literally at a loss 
before the alter of the image. (Perhaps this also has to do with the 
incest prohibition, the bleeding of the woman/text/image, _escape_ into 
alterity as well.)

"The dull compaction of the world thuds, in the foundation of the bottom 
of the text. The nether regions of discourse and language collapse in the 
nadir of bellowing sound, perversions of word and sentence. The basement 
of the ego drowns the abyss of the subject's grounds. The imploding 
tunnel of the uterine apparatus escapes into the thinned atmosphere of 
male, articulate and configured eyes, seminal sites, productions of 
belief gnawing at the periphery. My writing is a dull thunder. Lightning 
forms a disheveled paste across the sky. The flat bark of lightning. 
Lightning's chipped plate. Lightning's stain and the murmur of thunder, 
almost a word.

"The throat is chopped with its non-listening. 'I learned to speak with 
other holes.'" (from my Textbook of Thinking)

- abstract thought hidden within the laminar order of collapse -

The impasse exists at the boundary of Freudian decathexis, disinvestment, 
which is not necessarily an active release or discharge, but a loosening 
or unraveling as of the Borromean knot. The commodity is no longer oper- 
ative; something or someone is _used up._ Defuge is this using up, which 
occurs among worlds, the interstices or liminal realms of semiosis. Signs 
dissolve into the abyss of the substrate. One is lost in the midst of the 
inchoate accusations of the other; the trashed pornographic image is the 
content of nightmare. Defuge refuses...

Defuge iv


When it begins to assert itself, draw itself forward like wounded 
Philoctetes, when you begin to notice the nature of its speech, the 
twisted turn of the track on the sand.

But not when you begin to think about the condition of the body, naming 
it Philoctetes, the whole sorry history toppling forward like wounded 
Philoctetes.

When synesthesia spans the sensory modalities, drawing the body forward 
across the registers and intensities of perceptions, when the body dis- 
charges itself in the reception of Philoctetes, when Philoctetes dis- 
charges the body.

When there is no investment in the body, nor disinvestment, Philoctetes 
not-yet-animal, when there is intensity almost bordering on disgust, 
flight from meditation, from speech-Philoctetes.

When fuck-Philoctetes strums, stumbles, Sister-Streaming-Blood, but when 
furrowed sand-inscription, but when swollen, not spelling out. 

Defuge when the repressed returns, crouching, anal spore wet above the 
spurted sands, when the lines break open.

defuge, fifth and final section, explanations:


defuge refuge refuse defuse: _r.d/fu/g.s/e:_ writing the words over and
over again. effacement/sublimation/repression / incest/expulsion/scapegoat
- what differentiates defuge is the peculiar passivity that accompanies
it, the supine body, the fragility of the exposed underbelly.

rhyme chokes in the throat; the image withers the genitals; the half-read 
novel distresses, vis-a-vis _ownership,_ the reader: give the novel away, 
and the affect disappears. so that defuge is also connected with intro- 
jection, with an _economic investment_ of/within the body. nearer, no 
clearer.

always a sense of _failure_ in other words, the _thing_ construing (as in 
the _thing_ of depression) alterity, catching the subject up short. so 
there is a need to deflect/defuse: by passage of ownership among other 
means. the subject _renders itself passive_ in order to avoid dismember- 
ment, (degendered) castration.

it is also the dropping of recognition, of the proper name, of the object,
of the framing-device, of inscription, of circumscription, of the symbol-
ic. it is also participant in languor, in lassitude, in the flaneur, in 
nomadic wandering.

in my own adulterated view, defuge is connected with the hunt as well,
with the ravishment and devouring of the other, with propitiation. what is
used up, in this sense, in rhyme and the pornographic image, is life it-
self; the word or image no longer speaks: vanquished, it dissolves under
the gaze, returns to the material substrate, presents the gristle to the
frightened subject who has been transformed into witness. the half-read
novel as well is left for dead, exhausted. (there is also a connection
here with novelty/play: the image is played-with, the mind absorbs its 
structure within/without a kind of game - a learning-process related to 
the construct of intelligence. once the game is mastered, the subject is 
_at a loss,_ but not only the loss of an activated object: a loss which 
places the subject _within the realm of the passive,_ an approximation of 
his or her death. surely this is part of it.) surely this is part of it.

(and defuge enters into theoretical burnout, cyberspace burnout as well. 
the analysis becomes self-reflexive, choking. the term is _critical_ to 
analysis.)

"A great roar of thunder will come from within the light, the natural
sound of dharmata, like a thousand thunderclaps simultaneously. This is
the natural sound of your own dharmata, so do not be afraid or bewil-
dered. You have what is called a mental body of unconscious tendencies,
you have no physical body of flesh and blood, so whatever sounds, colors
and rays of light occur, they cannot hurt you and you cannot die. It is
enough simply to recognize them as your projections.  Know this to be the
bardo state." (Tibetan Book of the Dead, translation Francesca Fremantle, 
Chogyam Trungpa.)

defuge: in which the body gives itself away by transforming possession 
into paste.
