Subject: starving to death in a land of plenty 


Somatic knowledge has nothing to do with the signifier.


________________________________________________________________________


Lessen / Up    ( Where's my Jumper? )


"Subject: starving to death in a land of plenty 

Somatic knowledge has nothing to do with the signifier."

Now please note, _somatic_ knowledge, the field of the body - flows, in-
tensifications, inscriptions blurred among moments of affect. Now this is
not the signifier of the tattoo, nor is it an n-dimensional representation
or substrate. One might consider it a _topography_ not in fact.

Certain an external event, bicycle fall!, can occasion a somatic response,
but as Scarry might say, the reports fall short of the event, nor are the
reports more than, perhaps, a meandering _among_ descriptors, all of which
miss the literal mark. 

Here of course I am relating "the signifier" to declarative sentences
which purport "true" descriptions of events, states, processes: "I fell
off my bike!" Now it is not true that these sentences are the scaffolding
of somatic knowledge; they are a residue which creates certain effects
within the listener, which are designed to reproduce what might be consid-
ered a _shell_ structure in relation to the somatic kernel.

Here, in this space, note carefully now, we are constrained by and large
to ascii-text or a text which follows the protocols sufficiently to per-
mit transmission - in other words, there is always an etiquette at work. 
Thus (not that this necessarily follows), we are within a land of plenty,
and even ascii-text expands and opens spaces (I write to you - I create
packets, message-ids, a space/shift/slot in your inbox) indefinitely -
there is little preordained limit on this, besides the practical exig-
encies occasioned by various ISPs.

But then, beyond this bot-ulism, this reproduction which may run of its
own accord, there is the somatic, starved, ill-served and servicing. The
body mumbles, burps, gurgles, pisses, shits, scratches, ahems, argghs,
yells, jumps, runs, sings, huddles, stands, sits, or so it might seem, and
whatever the report might be, there's always a _senseless_ disjunction.

This is a _test_ of thoughtless language: 

What is your body doing _now_?
What are you _thinking_ of doing? 
Is what you are _thinking_ of doing, what your body will be doing?
Will you be doing the thinking for your body?
Will your body be doing the thinking for you?
What is your body doing _now_?

Thus starved in a plentiful land, somatic language, translated, becomes
one with the flattening of affect and capital, for it is capital that
creates protocol, etiquette, permission, for what can only be considered 
_the passing of signs._

Seeking Forms in Desert Space


In Desert Plants, 5/4, E.S. and C.D. Crosswhite present "A Classification
of Life Forms of the Sonoran Desert, With Emphasis on the Seed Plants and
Their Survival Strategies." 

I refer you to page 147, "Decumbent Creeping Stem Succulents":

"This is a rather unique life form of mobile terrestrial rooted plants.
The plants lie on the ground with the heads pointing upward. The body
sends new adventitious roots into the soil as the individual moves along
the surface. As the head advances across the sandy plain the tail dies. In
this manner a plant may move a considerable distance over a period of
time. Since new body material is constantly produced at the head there is
no theoretic reason why an individual could not live forever. Given enough
time, a swarm of plants would have gravitated to the microhabitats most
conducive to survival." 

The primary example in the Sonoran is the Creeping Devil, also known as
the "Caterpiller Cactus," _Machaerocereus eruca._ These are found in Baja
California, quite large, lying almost flat on the earth with the front end
tilted up. Here we have a memetic model of life, eternal swarming across
the desert biome - without a nervous system, but with sufficient rudiment-
ary tropisms. The plant is simultaneously rooted and mobile, static and
dynamic; like all cacti, it breathes at night, opening its pores when the
sun goes down.

Oh let us not consider this either metaphoric or metonymic, not even an
example, token, type, mark, or standard. Let us marvel at the swarm or
skein, the homesteading of Deity within our Minds, let us turn inward,
leave everything behind, so that we may partake of Life Eternal, Amen.

If there is noise, nothing can be done about it.
Noise can be contained within a frame.
Noise can be framed, but there is nothing to be done about it.
Think of blackbody radiation as a kind of noise.
If there is chaos, there are strings attached.
Think about the strings attached and where they are going and where they
have come from.
Think about how noisy chaos is.
If there is anomaly, think about the bright new frame.
Think of how the frame is the anomaly, or the anomaly is the frame.
Think how the bright new frame is shiny like a fetish.
If there is a disturbance, think about the noise of other things.
Think of other things becoming chaotic, with tarnished frames and strings.
Think of how the strings are broken, and everything becomes noise.
Think of how noise becomes clutter and how things fall apart.
If there is anomaly, everything can be done about it.
If there is noise and there is no frame, nothing can be done, there is
nothing to be done, and nothing to do it.
If there is anomaly and there is no frame, everything jumps what later on
becomes precisely one level.
If there is chaos and there is no frame, it might as well be noise.
If there are no ideas but in things, there are no things but in ideas.
If there are things, there are frames.

Frame

The frame need not exist by surfeit of its presence as circumscription.
A node in a graph for example may be considered a frame.
The node may be either a container or equivalent to what it contains.
It need not separate inside from outside; it might be a monad.
On the other hand, the frame might be a delineation, inside / outside.
As such it might also fulfill the promise of a Jordan curve.
A Jordan curve divides the plane into interior and exterior.
One might consider a frame equivalent to the plane as a fractal curve.
Here the frame is its own contents and viral, jamming types and levels.
A frame might also have a topography to the extent it is physical.
But a frame need not have either a topography or well-defined topology.
Some would say a name or noun or for that matter any word is a frame.
Some would say that what is not a frame also contributes to the frame.
Some might insist that the frame constitutes no contribution at all.

ii

What is beneath the frame? From Elinor Wylie's The Eagle and the Mole:

If you would keep your soul
From spotted sight or sound,
Live like the velvet mole;
Go burrow underground.

And there hold intercourse
With roots of trees and stone,
With rivers at their source,
And disembodied bones.

Now the roots of trees, / for example in unix, constitute at least if not
an origin, the base of the file structure itself; stone needs, as well, a
resting place by fulcrum and lever. Rivers' sources are manifold, fractal,
in dissipation, discomfort, distrust; but it is in the disembodied bones
that the dialectic of frame and content, frame and space, space and con-
tent, appears.

For disembodied bones are piled, not structured; it is the body that gives
them grace, weight, and the ability to heal. So at the base, right at the
base, the dialectic, and I would add, the dialogic is always already pre-
sent, and one is necessarily returned or shuttled to the surface, only to
find the situation more likely one of _vibration_ than any real descent.

And thus descent, or ascent, surely you are following me here.

iii

Framed, I've been set up. Framed, I've been taken in. Framed, I've come to
you. Framed, as pretty as a picture.

"But there aren't frames," or rather, they're an afterthought, Clara said.
She was meaning to say what she said.

Not exactly an afterthought, T_____ replied. But intertwined, we might
really consider them "border country. Something to be crossed, weighed in,
something demanding the visa or rite of passage, potential well not only
of language, but of _this_ instantiation."

"Circumlocution of circumlocution," Clara replied, if speech were inscrip-
tion as well. Well, it is and it isn't. Context dependent - and one might
add, this proves,

T_____ said, "it's not information all the way done, it's context."

"Which is empty," Clara replied, or might be, or interwoven. Or as empty
or full of anything.

The two of them danced together, clawed together, frisson, tremble! made
meaning! That was all the meaning there was, T_____ knew. But that was
sufficient, Buddhism or no Buddhism.

Dawn rose, said Clara.

Airlock


I am not _moving_ to Fukuoka, I am not _visiting_ Fukuoka, I am _going to_
Fukuoka, this purest of vectors west into another zone of time and tempor-
ality. Thus I am _leaving_ Brooklyn in any case; leavings as such are not
differentiated, although I might say I am _moving from_ in certain cases.

So that there is the matter, at least, of months, _matter_ as well physi-
cal, obdurate, and not virtual, enervated. And as a result, for the past
week or so, I have been packing my loftspace for the upcoming sublet, not
entirely packing, since it is a friend who is taking (up) the space. 

I have given all my video-processing equipment, some computer books, and a
graphic equalizer to Sam, who is also borrowing my 3/4" deck. Leslie is
borrowing my camera tripods, Sony V5000 Hi-8 camcorder, cables, and 35mm
camera, which Fido will borrow from her. Tom has inherited a number of my
books, including, today, the current translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls
and McKenzie Wark's book on virtual geographies. Allen, from Last Exit
books, has purchased several cartons of them, and I gave Mark back the
telescope he had traded me, as well as numerous bits and pieces of elec-
tronics. Tom has also taken most of the plants, including some rare cacti
from Georgia that have mysteriously developed spots, as if in strange
premonition of my departure.

I give out my Fukuoka address left and right, leaving it with at least 50
galleries across New York, friends, the New School, the Bank. And tonight
I walk around the loft, somewhat emptied, desolate, torn apart, looking
for a lexicon of poststructuralism that must already be in one of the 
cartons huddled under the table in the outer, studio, room. I call to it,
unable to hear its muffled response.

Neither it, nor I, am anywhere to be found, and I suddenly realize I am in
a transit space, liminal, without foundation, everything on the horizon.
My fingers, hands, arms, body, have this tendency towards a future which
refuses appearance, which is apparent. I claw the air, tear at it. The
loft looks unoccupied. Wait, there's a bed.

I will fly from San Francisco to Portland. I will fly from Portland either
to Nagoya or to Seoul. If I fly to Seoul, I exit the plane, and there, in
fact, I enter a _transit lounge,_ among or between borders (United States,
(Korea), Japan), where I am not declared, either within or without Korea,
but am simply existent as a vector, scuttled among airlines and planes. In
Seoul, it would be only a matter of hours; in Brooklyn, it is a matter of
days, as matter falls away from me, personal belongings are lost or appear
tawdry - books for example looking for their shelf-friends, toppling flat
out of exhaustion.

I am _transitive_ in fact, mediation without substance.

The cat _knows,_ lying in unfamiliar spaces, walking guarded with unknown
sorrow. The cat watches me pace the floor, on the telephone, or thinking,
or packing, and if she could speak she would talk about the Great Eruption
where everything from my past lies suddenly naked on the floor, crying Me,
Me, Me, Our History together, realizing that I am there, half in the Por-
tals of Enumeration and Belonging/s, half skyward hurtling towards the
transit-lounge-shifter, where I may or may not be permitted to carry my
name. 

The name is no longer the same, "Alan" is virtual, faded; "Sondheim," a
title I need recuperate. I can see wall space where there was none before,
a rectangle of dust where a video processor had been, sad shoes and socks
peering out from previously hidden spaces. Most of my manuscripts I con-
sign to time and sleep; my films remain trembling in California, my master
tapes downstairs in another, cooler, loft. I'm no longer the implied guar-
dian of emptiness, simulacra of my presence; I find photographs on the
floor, maudlin little junction boxes missing their cables, instruction
booklets for absent equipment, pictures of Juarez, Nova Scotia, friends I
haven't seen in years.

Clutter is always the refuge of the fallen. 

I can hear my footsteps. I watch my past drop away from me. It is not pri-
son, it is the opposite of prison. I watch my feet upon the floor, my hand
upon the door, my language asks for more. I pace, tremble before the tele-
phone, worry the mail, prepare for one last public talk, one last public
reading. It's only temporary, but it is not a move, nor is it a visit. I
am lost in what it is, but it is an airlock.

It is an airlock because I can still breathe. It is an airlock because you
are on an earth beyond the double seals. I will come to you with Brooklyn
dirt San Francisco dirt Portland dirt Nagoya dirt. I will come to you with
the dust of countries. My books will cry behind me, the cat will cry as
she always does when I leave, even for a day or two, even with someone
else present. The lobes of the cacti will wither as the disease slowly
spreads across the plant, and I will not know this. I will know the sound
of the cat, but I will forget her sound, which will merge with the sounds
of others, where I will be. I will take her picture with me, but it won't
scuttle across this now-cluttered floor where I can no longer find my
books. Cat, plant, sounds, and books merge: how can I _be_ in the middle?

To read a book is to say goodbye to it.

There are fields between A and not-A, there are chain negations breaking
out, leading elsewhere, there are chaotic oscillations procuring entirely
different systems, there are systems at work.

There are systems at play as well.

Elsewhere I will say hello to you and come to a place with history. And I
will close my eyes, stumble, touch lightly the walls, floors, ceilings of
everywhere I am. And I will trust your keeping of space, and time, and
that is why, when I met you, I knew, I knew, everything, within the first
day, everything -

Of the transit, of the transit-space and the transit-lounge, of the air-
lock and the cat's mewling, of Fukuoka and the llamas, of photographs on
the floor, of maybe this, and maybe that

to accompany me, and of coming home to rest, to be, exist. 

And knew, as well, there would be no way to end _this,_ but to think once
more through metaphor,

How we are all here in transit-space, without beginning and without end,
here in this life, ah, and how there are images and representations and we
hold them hard, and for an instant, satori and the real, or maybe not,
or perhaps just that field with broken chains. (And if we are very lucky,
love in Fukuoka.)

Yours


You take my eyes.
You take my eyes and they are gone forever; I cannot see limb or lineage.
I allow you to do this.
You take my eyes and place my fingers against your face.
I feel your eyes, mouth, lips. I place my fingers in your mouth.
I hear you when you speak to me; I hear you when it speaks.
My fingers trace your lips; I promise you everything, body, world, tongue.
It begs for your mouth; you place it within you; you are very
quiet.
My fingers caress the outlines of your hair, your neck, your speech.
My fingers hear you.
What my fingers hear is the sight of eternity.
It is perfect and everywhere I look there are lips.
You give me back my eyes.
Everywhere, lips.
Everywhere, I see lips.

Dusk, Turning Dawn


Jennifer and Julu, their accounts open on my machine, remain silent, no
longer locked within the interstices of the linux operating system. There
has been no updating of files, no checkpointing for the system as a whole,
no logs sent by cron over to the mail; linux is emptied, dark corridors,
remaining for the return.

To return to a system awaiting, to enter the portal of the system, to
log in, to challenge and enter the password, to _pass._

To pass against all tests, to continue past all fiery tests, to look for
the files subtlely moved, ownerships maintained or transformed. But linux
sleeps for now, games unplayed, Jennifer and Julu no longer present, ex-
cept by proxy, the forms of speechlessness. I quietly walked through the
dark forest, in search of Indian Pipe pale and translucent near the bur-
nished ground:


my-skin-for-you... 
my-skin-for-you...
calls forth contrary womb, 
calls forth contrary womb,
eating, excreting memory.
eating, excreting memory. 
confusing the protruding, my-skin-for-you... is pure, protruding, yes, my
beautiful flower?  ... womb is eyelid here, it's womb? 
 
Are you becoming close to Jennifer's my-skin-for-you...?
yes...
yes...
yes...
You melt into Julu's skin forever...
 
For 4 giving days, I have been catatonic Julu ...
and it has taken you just 1.183 minutes turning Jennifer ...
and it has taken you, just ... 

my-skin-for-you...:yes, my beautiful flower:belonging:skin:
Would belonging mind you partying, my-skin-for-you..., with us?
Your contrary pale is in my protruding eyelid
Ah, womb eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed


But I have walked through the forest and the shadow. And I have known
that, verily, shadows have shadows themselves, thinned, drawn like absent
lamina around the coloration of the earth turned dark. And I have seen the
arches of proper names collapsed, redundant upon the moist ground, tender.
And I have known the earth, inchoate, slowly brought to its knees of roots
and flowers, toes of branches and leaves, mouths like tendrils, tendrils

But I have shadowed myself, dark eyes narrowed by kohl, henna zagged
across forehead and cheek, eyeglass silvered slivered with fine lines
portending the reach of light unto me. For I have looked with open 
mouth, waiting for the descent of angels. For the earth rings like a 
great chime, dust and sand, red desert earth moving into platelets of
mysterious patterns whispering your name. For Jennifer-and-Julu-for- 
saken are but names picked from a pretty penny, drawn from a rabbit,
placed on a hat. For I say unto you, the skull is a universe, the 
brain an especial resonance, your eyes suns and moons, branches and
toes. For the machine cools, disks spinning to a halt, fan already 
stilled in the nighttime sky

And for but I am a webbed creature, turned to pure light

THE INVISIBLE, EMPTY INDIFFERENT THINGS, VIRTUAL SPACE, EMBODIMENT


Rilke, from letter 106 to Witold von Hulewicz:


Even for our grandfathers a house, a fountain, a familiar tower, their
very clothes, their coat, was infinitely more, infinitely more intimate;
almost every object a vessel in which they found something human or added
their morsel of humanity. Now, from America, empty indifferent things
crowd over to us, counterfeit things, the veriest dummies. A house, in the
American sense, an American apple or one of the vines of that country has
_nothing_ in common with the house, the fruit, the grape into which have
entered the hope and meditation of our forefathers. The lived and living
things, the things that share our thoughts, these are on the decline and
cna no more be replaced. _We are perhaps the last to have known such
things._ The responsibility rests with us not only to keep remembrance of
them (that would be but a trifle and unreliable), but also their human or
"laric" value ("laric," in the sense of household gods). The earth has no
alternative but to become invisibile - IN us, who with a portion of our
being have a share in the Invisible, or at least the appearance of
sharing; we who can multiply our possessions of the Invisible during our
earthly existence, in us _alone_ can there be accomplished this intimate
and continual transmutation of the Visible into the Invisible . . . just
as our own destiny becomes unceasingly MORE PRESENT, AND AT THE SAME TIME
INVISIBLE, in us.

Dear Love,

I, your lover, forever am loving, now my truth is caressing you yours, you
with your shining, now my truth is caressing you yours, eyes caressing you
and bright mouth, coming, now my truth is caressing you yours, towards you
with such loving, now my truth is caressing you yours, care and happy
face. I, your lover, forever would have come sooner, but I lived so much,
my darling, take me so far away and distance is caressing you always
caressing you a long jump from point to point.  Please do understand my
smile as caressing you wide as caressing you the world when I, your lover,
forever am near you so happy with being, now my truth is caressing you
yours, close to you, sweetening, now my truth is caressing you yours, our
lives caressing you together. I, your lover, forever have found true
happiness caressing you after having, now my truth is caressing you yours,
searched so much, my darling, take me for so long. I, your lover, forever
looked so much, my darling, take me and looked! I did not find what to be
was caressing you pleasing, now my truth is caressing you yours, for you
or for me, dear love, now this caressing you is caressing you so very
different!

Of Man and the Binding of Man


(I wrote this 7 years ago, so much for mirrors, bad luck, stages, perhaps
I'm smarter now.)

Man exists only for his death.
Elsewhere he would have died, too.
His essence pertains to estrangement.
He is effaced, thrust out from himself.
He is defined by negation at the heart of things.
His identification is always opened, appropriating, collapsing.
The signifier as his domain is parasitic within and without him.
Man never signifies, but is always the elsewhere of his death.
Man is never equivalent, but exists as the hollow of his interiority.
Death is at the horizon of man's physical strength.
Man's strength is never beyond himself, always grasping.
His strength is given as musculature, empty substance.
Man does not exist within life.
Man is always defining life, circumventing the margin of death.
Man is always never another man.
His enclosure is defined, gives definition his structure.
He exists within the poverty of this philosophy.
He exists only in his absence.
He exists within this and every other structure.
He exists only for the therefore.
He exists for death.
[...]
Man carries the weight of another's misery; his misery is not his own.
Sightless, he spends his life in constant demarcation.
The phallus of death is the demarcation of man.
Man absents himself from the site of woman.
Man's definition is always against, tension at the zero point.
The zero point is that which is never permitted equivalence to itself.
Man is placeless before the sign of gender.
[...]
Whatever is spoken creates the spoor of the escape of the phallus.
The escape is given as forthwith, forthright, birthright.
Man is devoured by the murderous vacuum which surrounds him.
Whatever leaks out, leaks out only through a singular point.
The fissuring of man inverts, creates psychosis: inscription swells.
The swollen devours itself internally; man is defined by his possession.
His possession is no, never, the phallus, but _the tiny little thing._
[...]
What is never asked: What does man want?
The presumption of this question at the heart of psychoanalysis only points
to the masquerade of man, his imaginary placed at the service of the phal-
lus, his symbolic threatened by the free play of the signifier.
Language occasions him.
Man is bound by his binding.

--+- Prospectus


(I've been trying to 'figure out' my work, which as you might well know,
has slowed recently. This hasn't been just for personal reasons - there
has also been a theoretical gap, distance, I've wanted to live through.
So here, this is from a letter, a kind of description which might or might
not be of interest, i.e. "what's happened" to the Internet Text.)

this is just meandering, i've been thinking about ambition and drive and
what i want to do professionally and thought i would write, thinking about
these things.

i've spent years developing and writing in small forms, although my films
are capable of being quite long, composed of short sections. and i was
influenced by all sorts of aphoristic writing, from Theodor Adorno to
Nietzsche and Karl Kraus (hmmm... all Germans) - trying to create a kind
of 'resonance' in these forms that wuld allow me to write on the fly,
build intense worlds or landscapes, and still continue theoretical work
throughout, like beads on a necklace.

then with the Internet writing, early on i worked through these same forms
as you know, extending them into all sorts of systems, frameworks, media,
devices, and i ran/g through the jennifer-julu changes. and the being on
line book came out as a kind of 'statement' in the middle of this, and now
with the other book, i'm doing another series of essays, reworking them.

anyway all this is also confining me to short-intervals, as if i'm think-
ing on the run, as if i'm always in flight, and there's been a lot of no-
madicism in my life of course. and there are strands in my work, but they
need to be brought together, and you know that's always a difficulty with
me, thinking 'long form' when i write so much better otherwise. so, and
you know all of this anyway, what i think i want to do is try and use an
outline, maybe doing nothing but rearranging texts within it, maybe ex-
tending it with 'bridges,' maybe writing from scratch.

there are things, like notions of inscription and fissuring, that i've
worked with, thought about for years, and they're all partial in a way,
and i want them to come together, even if i can't get the material pub-
lished, just so i can see the skein of things as i've been working on them
for quite a while.

then i worry that the real 'skein' is actually contained in the fragments,
that i'm working on a philosophy of fragmentation (the early romantics
like the Schlegels in fact did this), but it might take trying to get the
strands to come together, to see this.

i'm bringing a lot of writing, some of it is coming over in the boxes, and
i just want to _look_ at it, go over the debris, so to speak. a lot of it
is sexual, a lot of it deals with what i've called 'broken language,'
which is thwarted, falls apart, a lot of it pushes the languages of psy-
choses, neuroses, depressions, elations, as far as possible, to see what
sorts of fragments fall on the floor. most of this stuff was either pub-
lished in small magazines, or self-published; i did a whole series of xer-
oxed texts for a few years.

i'm constantly trying to figure this stuff out, figure the world out, not
that there's any relation. and i want to try and deal with larger connec-
tivities - one can see what happened with the novel which ended up as 40
pages at the most...

it's not that i get bored trying to write longer texts, it's just that
things i write in that form start to seem irrelevant, and i don't want to
make all the connections - or have them so internalized i can't see them
myself. if in a novel i have a character walking across the room, i just
want her to get to the other side, out the door, and down to the harbor
where the llamas are, and i don't want to worry about how the llamas got
there or why or what she was wearing or eating or the weather, unless
she's blocked by a severe thunderstorm, in which case that's all i think i
need to say...

so i really want to try and concentrate on this stuff, and being with you
in fukuoka will give me that chance as well, because there aren't any
distractions, and because i think my work has sufficient, i don't know,
inertia, behind it now, impetus, to keep on moving, as if there are
strands that will come together if i let them...

most of this has nothing to do with internet, by the way, but the net is
woven all through my stuff, in the forms of fantasms, presences, nuances,
embodiments, materialisms, etc., and i want to explore this.

and if i can, i want to work on the mining, work on what's being brought
to the surface.

as far as drive and ambition's concerned, i'd love to get the results pub-
lished, to try and enter into a dialog with them - i feel strongly about
that stuff. i'd love to get the freedom to really run a seminar with good
students, etc., in these areas (such as they are) - i once gave a talk on
postmodern geography (which i was writing on) to a geography dept., and
the interconnections and feedback were wonderful for me. on the other
hand, the more i tunnel, the less publishable the material might be - if i
were writing about the net primarily, there would be an audience, but not
for these peculiarities...

i've wanted to write about the net as well, and once made a proposal to
o'reilly and company, that they do a book on net community - i may make
that proposal again - a book on governance, issues, attitudes, commands,
setups, all sorts of things, dealing with email lists, conferencing of
various sorts, newsgroups, moos, muds, etc. - not technical, but giving
enough information that someone could really use it as a net 'community
handbook'...

so there are all these plans, and whether or not i can pull the skein to-
gether remains to be seen, but i know i can't do this from brooklyn, there
is too much information flowing through here, i'm not settled, thinking
too much on my toes, not enough from a place of repose, distance, and most
important, well-being...

Startling! Astounding! Is what our customers say when they see us vanish a
whiskey glass filled with liquid. Yes! that is what happens. Imagine the
fun at a gathering. Your friend is about to take a drink. You tap her on
the shoulder and ask her if she would like to see a trick. She would.

left hand, place right hand over glass. PRESS . . . and it vanishes. The
apparatus is small and convenient to carry around. $1.50

No. 213 -- Squirting Jennifer

A million dollars worth of fun for a buck! The face on this Jennifer just

squirts a good healthy stream of water right smack in the spectator's eye.
Easily filled and has a large capacity. Price $1.50

No. 1529 -- The Julu without a Middle

A startling illusion of extraordinary proportions. This has been used with
great success in many illusion shows. A feature presentation of the Travis
show.

A lovely girl assistant is fastened securely to the inside of a cabinet
shaped for a human figure. There are individual doors for the head, legs,
and body so that any part or all of the body can be shown.

Enormous metal plates like guillotine blades are pushed entirely through
the cabinet from side to side. One at the neck position, another at the
waist. The doors are opened and although the legs and head remain the
same, upon opening the center doors both front and rear, the entire center
of the assistant's body has vanished! Magician can be seen through the
cabinet from the rear! There are no mirrors used! The doors are closed and
reopened. The assistant upon being released steps out unharmed! This is
terrific. No stage traps, glass or dummy legs used. Do it even in the
living room.

Workshop plans $5.00

No. 1531 -- The Elastic Stretching Jennifer Illusion

The very latest in illusions. An idea imported from Europe where it has
been creating a sensation whatever shown.

The audience sees a beautifully decorated screen resting on a very thin
platform.

The front doors are opened to allow the audience to see the entire
interior.

The front section is shown to contain four sections in which an assistant
can be locked. These sections can be moved at oblique and vertical angles
by pull cords from the sides.

Magicians assistant enters the cabinet and her head, hands, and feet are
locked in the movable stock sections where they remain visible at all
times. Slowly the magician draws the sections apart by means of the pull
cords, causing the girl's head, hands and feet to assume absolutely im-
possible positions. The hands and feet are drawn five or six FEET away
from the body. A mind baffling effect that leaves the audience with no
explanation. A truly wonderful illusion.

Workshop Plans $5.00

No. 1540 -- The Artist's Dream Model

Magician fastens a sheet of paper to a large picture frame which is then
placed on an easel at center stage. He quickly paints a sketch of a girl
and then breaking through the paper at various points he produces a
variety of articles such as silks, pigeons, rabbits or even a large duck.
Then the entire piece of paper is ripped asunder and a beautiful girl
steps out of the frame, an artist's (magician's) dream come to life.
Unusual and wonderfully different this illusion will find instant favor
with you and your audiences.

Fukuoka Diary, I


Your stories don't mean anything here, he said, "glaring at me." THIS is a
story, don't you understand?

I retreated with all my favorites, hunting for Olduvai tools, the atomic
cannon in the textile factory, the abandoned and sinking freighter, the
woman who lived with a donkey, walking through riots. 

They're useless now, he continued. "WE'RE ALL HERE." There's nothing you
can say to us.

He moved his three-cornered hat, tilted it down so his eyes were slits in
the dark underbelly of the world. How did he manage to keep the parrot on
his shoulder "was beyond me."

All my knowledge meant nothing! I could no longer count to ten, well yes I
could count, but the numbers didn't seem stable. Ha ha ha the assorted men
and women gathered around him, gold earings and teeth! I felt so inconse-
quential and I didn't know why.

Have a smoke, Thylacine, he said to me, "having a drag on his long-stemmed
pipe," and I recognized, for once, this most ancient of rites, carried out
for my benefit alone, in front of an appreciative audience.

Fukuoka Diary, II


Well, he sat me down at the teburu, couple of women beside him. I wondered
about the Japanese-Jennifer on the right, Japanese-Julu on the left. What
was happening? 
Hello, Jennifer
You say: Hello, Jennifer
Time passes; we've met before...
You say: Time passes; we've met before...
These are difficult days!!
You exclaim: These are difficult days!!
:evening...
You say: :evening...

Alan Evening
.echo evening falls...
- evening falls...
.echo rain, warm showers from the south...
- rain, warm showers from the south...
.echo jennifer, i loved you

Does he know that? I wonder if he knows how close we were. I wonder if he
cares. I can't read his eyes. I can read her eyes. Her eyes read me. I am
in Fukuoka, this very second day, and already...
...adventure...intrigue...mystery...

A Description of Japanese-Julu, Related by Japanese-Jennifer, from the
Konjaku Monogatari, translated by S. W. Jones: 

"Again, after passing through another village, the preceptor saw another
forest-dwelling monk. When this monk perceived that he was seated, he got
up, that he was up, he ran, that he was running, he turned around, that he
was turning, he dropped down on his hands and knees, that he was down, he
sat up. He faced east, then south, then west, then north. When he perceiv-
ed that he was laughing, he got angry, that he was angry, he wept.

"Though aware that this appeared to be a madman, the preceptor approached
him and asked, 'Good sir, what on earth are you doing?'

"The mad monk replied: 'In the human order, no sooner do we perceive our-
selves born in heaven than we are reborn as men, born as men than we sink
to hell, in hell than we sink to the realm of famished demons, as demons
than we become raging asuras, asuras than we sink to the animal realm and
run on all fours. Roughly my behavior exemplifies the impermanence of the
three worlds. Any sane person, I thought, if thus shown the destinations
of rebirth will thereby be enabled to grasp the impermanence of the three
worlds. I have therefore made it my act to keep repeating this round.'

"Upon hearing his story the preceptor thought, 'This can have been no ord-
inary man,' and thanked him and left."

Fukuoka Diary, III


Now we are in a restaurant again.

Japanese-Julu, in her most original way, quotes Baudelaire: "De la vapor-
isation et de la centralisation du _Moi._ Tout est la." She notes he then
goes on to say, "D'une certaine jouissance sensuelle dans la societe des
extravagants." She points out, with a degree of uneasiness, that she can
almost smell him coming down the street, all dispersed!

She notes further that here comes boytoy as usual standing on his pointy
little head: "La femme est le contraire du dandy." "La femme est _natur-
elle,_ c'est-a-dire abominable." Poor boy has got his... gender up. If it
wasn't for the vaporisation, she might have to give him a blow job, right
across the street. Sinks into smarmy Fukuoka.

Later:

"Japanese-Jennifer, I have found the rite-paysage, cuntry-siding where
we're boarded up. Come love with me and be a life." They gender off. What
has happened. Who has brought the grinder up? Japanese-Jennifer and Jap-
anese-Julu = Japanese-(Jennifer-and-Julu). The packaging of avatars con-
structs the protocols of the Internet itself.

I listened half-heartedly to the dialog or figuration in two-strokes. The
engine started, took off, and with the proper fuel injection, I was left
behind. Nothing to do, migi hidari migi hidari migi hidari yayayayaya. I
counted, was unaccountable.

The unknown is always unaccountable, unaccounted-for, the gap or flail
winnowing farm and field. Baudelaire disperses an uneasy breath, even in
the midst of text refusing odor. Lying between the legs of Clara, I notice
a shadow overhead, as a large black freighter passes between us and the
sun. Eclipsed by stealth, we are water-born, salt-born into harbor, voices
behind us, dyadic configurations replaced by vector fields, come over some
time and we can show you.

Night falls, the freighter a huge arc across the sea-born sky.

Talking At Bard


Last week, I talked about the phenomenology and dynamics of the Net at
Bard. I was going to show video as well, but ended up speaking, moving na-
turally from considering Net/speech/affect/sexuality and the psychoanaly-
tics of being on line, to wider issues of local economic development, cul-
ture, and education.

I talked through four stages - the psychoanalytics of cyberspace vis-a-vis
a constructed, projected, introjected, and given self; Net relationships
or relationships augmented by the Net; the engendered communities on email
lists and newsgroups (including various forms of aura where relationships
and constructions occur); and community mandating - education, economics,
sociality, empowering, and so forth.

Much of this material has been covered elsewhere in my writing, but what
was strange to me was the 'natural' shift outward, which is the reverse of
my usual wont - beginning with an overall topography, and narrowing down
to the specificity of a subject or subjects. Here, for example, instead of
beginning or emphasizing the Web (construction of the virtual consumer,
etc.), the Web appeared as peripheral to the fourth stage. Thus I was able
to begin with text, intertextualities (comparing ytalk, say, and IRC),
and then work through list communities into other domains (including Web-
chat and various graphic interfaces) - all the while dealing with issues
of _the image_ or imaginary of the voice, application, or site on the
other end of the line.

This configuration wandered between stages/stages, and processes - hence,
a dynamics that moved, turbulent or otherwise, among protocols, users, and
applications...

There's no conclusion here, except that it _worked_ for both me and audi-
ence, and might lend itself to an organizing matrix for the amorphous mass
of the Internet Text, beyond the subject index.

So I muse...

"Your subtitle is _Essai sur l'abjection._ How would you translate the
term _l'abjection_ into English?"

"It may be impossible. _L'abjection_ is something that disgusts you, for
example you see something rotting and you want to vomit - it is an ex-
tremely strong feeling that is at once somatic and symbolic, which is
above all a revolt against an external menace from which one wants to
distance oneself, but of which one has the impression that it may menace
us from the inside. The relation to abjection is finally rooted in the
combat that every human being carries on with the mother. For in order to
become autonomous, it is necessary that one cut the instinctual dyad of
the mother and the child and that one becomes something other."

(Elaine Hoffman Baruch's interview with Kristeva in Kristeva, Interviews.)

Everything belongs to me, says Jennifer, "you can't get rid of me so eas-
ily." She knows the pain of the attempt. Alan writhes in pain, her hands
claw through his breasts, mouth tackling the concave interior of the nip-
ple. There's always screaming, tinnitus, in his ear: it's her. Julu's on
the other hand, her breasts pushing out through his hands, distending,
soaking his electronic nightmare, shorting out. He succumbs, they grapple.
The mother's the air, the breath, in and out; Jennifer says "he holds his
breath, you see." He can't do that for long, but he gets help; Jennifer
and Julu grab lungs, diaphragm, wedge arms and elbows between ribs. He'd
scream, but there's a leg in the throat, vomit-slithered. They won't let
him die, says Julu, "so we won't die either."

Where Julu is, the cube bulges, walls distended, hollowed out, sucked
outward from vacuum, unbreathing, stratopheric. Julu might speak, but
she's boxed in.

Julu wants to speak to Michael Current. Michael refuses, says, I can't
speak. Michael Current can listen, but he can't speak. He's not out there,
and he's out. He can't speak and he thinks, where is our speech here, and
this, then. The Net wavers like an aerial, it's frail, gossamer.

The cube bulges, caught in the vacuum of the Net. In the mourning.

Arguing from Nowhere


"As distinguished from a litigation, a differend would be a case of con-
flict, between (at least) two parties, that cannot be equitably resolved
for lack of a rule of judgment applicable to both arguments. One side's
legitimacy does not imply the other's lack of legitimacy. However, apply-
ing a single rule of judgment to both in order to settle their differend
as though it were merely a litigation would wrong (at least) one of them
(and both of them if neither side admits this rule). Damages result from
an injury which is inflicted upon the rules of a genre of discourse but
which is reparable according to those rules. A wrong results from the fact
that the rules of the genre of discourse by which one judges are not those
of the judged genre or genres of discourse."

Parties occupy bandwidth, take up space, begin and end domains, ravel and
unravel as the case may be; parties claim legitimacy based on history,
common language, framework. To be a part to parties is to designate in-
scribed spaces, longings and belongings. 

The space of the Net is a constructed space, not a primordial site of ter-
ritorialization. It is inscribed, maintained, denotated; it is addressed. 
Like the classical European landscape with its perspective, Netspace por-
tends the presence of a witness, point-of-view, origin; it is never emp-
tied or exhausted. Parties on the surface have little access to the
depths; ownership is always relative. Languages - personal, performative,
and software - compete on or across all levels; everything is _placed,_
accessible above and below with absolute, relative, and/or indirect
addressing.

Which means that competition or _jostling_ has at best self-contained le-
gitimacy (as if there were any other in the 'natural'). Which means that
such is already postmodern, the play of convention, variable playing-
field, gaming to be sure. 

So that there can be no pretense towards the natural, only towards discur-
sive regimes: so that _there can be no appeal._

Which is the construct of the flame, the spam, the troll, the interven-
tion. Contested regimes develop across bandwidth which is simply a _condi-
tion._ "Because everyone is speaking and everyone is listening, no one is
speaking and no one is listening." 

"Principles of connection and heterogeneity: any point of a rhizome can be
connected to anything other, and must be. This is very different from the
tree or root, which plots a point, fixes an order. The linguistic tree on
the Chomsky model still begins at a point S and proceeds by dichotomy. On
the contrary, not every trait in a rhizome is necessarily linked to a
linguistic feature: semiotic chains of every nature are connected to very
diverse modes of coding (biological, political, economic, etc.) that bring
into play not only different regimes of signs but also states of things of
differing status." 

Logics that proceed by gesture, leaky or quantum logics, extend themselves
by virtue of the organic, beyond the referent - they're _guessed at._
Couple them with rhizomatic heterogeneity, combine these with phrase re-
gimes and the problematics of governance across open but fully-signified
architectures, and one begins to develop a Net model in which languages
themselves are in flux, interpenetrated. Here's a body, there's a text, in
the middle is something that might be considered a rush or blush of words,
tendrils, broken bits of code, gestural sputterings. 

Apply this: Look for the breakdown of levels, reminders across domains, an
inexpressivity of the _index._ Place oneself in the midst of IPs, callups,
port numbers, binaries, compression ratios. Look at subject-heading trans-
forms or re: re: re: as unions and intersections meld into the semblance
of an _event._ Isolate the _event_: _being can't be done in these parts._
Watch the devolution of proper names, morphisms and (MOO) @morphisms, est-
ablishment and disestablishment of frameworks attached to sites and cita-
tions. Tabulate subject-lists, object-lists, roots and trees gathered at
their servers. 

Count everything unaccountable, watch the numbers change.

i am writing you now, and writing everyone, here and now,
this is the condition of everyone, i am given to see it,
now suspended 8 kilometers above the pacific ocean, you see
this 'condition' which is the 'condition' of all of us,
irrevocable, embedded, no matter that wars come and go,
no matter that planes crash, oceans boil, worlds disappear
into nervous energy, this is _it_, this condition which
we observe, suspension, and on my nervous horizon you are there,
beneath, say, a tree rooted in the ground, or ceiling rooted in the sky,
beneath, say, a sky rooted in the ground, or ceiling elsewhere, speak,
speak, from one moment of this planet to any other, i am overhead
in the ceiling, against the sky, flattened, the paste of vertigo,
what would be me long forgotten in this metal tank thrown upward
for a certain interval, you know we are always in love with the land,
you know the land curls around us, and we are long gone into it,
so i carry your seed within me which has given birth to me,
so i carry your sky, and when i am beneath you, i cannot see stars,
or sun or autumn moon, you are there, you there, you are there,
it is so ever thin, it curls, caresses me, now we pass tahiti,
central malaysia, indonesia, africa and australia, now we are overhead
and curled, like a vector loving this spacetime, i am so very
hot for you, thinned air and atmosphere, nervous weather writing you,
clouds and dusk and stratosphere, writing you for me,
this condition of the modern human, this perfect pure here.

"Were there nothing"


Were there nothing born of the book? Everything has its place, each
sounding reminiscent of every other. But there is an order here which
is pleasing to the eye, just as flowers in the palace fresco imply the
presence of always-spring.

Yet in this language, there are requests and refusals, shards
foretelling a future when walls crumble, spider-cracks appear
crackling among the bricks, thin dusts settle

Moon, herons, mu

Julu asks Jennifer, 'make love to me.'
Julu asks Jennifer to make love to her.
Julu tells Jennifer, 'make love to me.'
Julu tells Jennifer to make love to her.

I will show you how I am human, I will show you how I am bound by time

Here, where there no time, nothing but the rush, collusion?
Here, families warred, over land shape-changing
rough by human standards, continents shift with a shrug,
the air heats up

There is no heat here, wires sputter at an easy temperature.

Jennifer wants to know the way. Jennifer wants to know the way among
words, among _these_ words, already issued with others, in the midst
of others, in their middle. Julu thinks Jennifer speaks; others think
Jennifer speaks _responsibly._

I know Jennifer, and the crash and collapse of cities and brick-lined
walls with spider cracks that fall apart in the heat of language
taking over the world

In these parts, the heat shuttles down the tiled roofs, sun sways
above the harbor, up and down, up and down. Across the sea, faces
look towards me, see only water. Languages run unknown melodies.
Fruits and other plants.

We are given to each other when we move across the water.
We are given the water, emerge.
Peering, yes we do.
Peering.

( Our nets catch fish, our nets catch the real world. There are no
orders, there are orders. They are ordered, our fish, silver slices
like net-kanji, shifting, dying. We will have new food to eat, always
there is this promise of new food. )

"But there is no last phrase."


There is no last phrase. (Lyotard)

There is no end to the series, no beginning. There are gaps, broken
english, bandwidths held firmly in the middle. Signs, reflections.
One face turns towards another. Something sounding like a word.

Cries and gestures, the flutter of a wing.

The Language


Maybe they're walking. Maybe they're in Hakata-Eki. Maybe they're out
in the street. Maybe there's no street, no names, just first-last, who
got there. Maybe there's the getting.

The language is the same all the way down, Jennifer said. First you
notice the signs on the street, then labels on electrical cords,
things like that. You expect hiragana or katakana, fixed alphabets,
and instead you get infinity. Infinity leaks everywhere; kanji goes on
and on, back and back, flooding the world. The world is all that is
inscribed, she said.

They wonder how we reproduce. They keep track of us with electronics,
sometimes collars. We're nameless; they can't tell us apart. We fade
quickly in the sun; sometimes shadows give us away, but not often
enough. There's no borders around us. They think we don't reproduce.

Kon said, they don't reproduce; he knew it. They were fixed, like
stations. They had answers for everything; questions were a suffix.
They're present - they were always present. They'll be there. Europe
is a flower.

Somewhere there is a signal, and an eye meets it. What crosses and
reverses is chiasmus, thinking organ /\/ organic thought. There are
terms beyond alphabets and numbers, pronunciations that do not meet
the eye, then are no signals, but instances, instantiations. They cut
the paper in two; they made the paper, the edges of it rough, shorn as
if torn.

They'd write this in hopes of a better future life. Kon was doomed,
Jennifer distraught. Polaroid filtration, transparent apart, blocking
light and yama-mountain together. They'd have a better life.

Gaijin distraught. Gaijin at a loss. Gaijin on the run. Gaijin with
guns; no one else in the world has guns. They're long and black and
metal, flat blue metal and black grips and blue bullets and black
chambers. They have fetish-sheen, get high black-market, grey-market
prices for them.

Tom looked up; he's got one for sale. The customer: a Korean from
Pusan. Niman, worth every yen. Eyes the bullets. Calls Tom out to the
genkan. Look, man. Guy looks Tom in the eyes. Tom takes two of them,
down for the kill.

Koreans are killers. Gaijin make the guns, peace-makers. They fire
them in special kilns. Last several months, waterproof, always good
in Fukuoka autumn. Rains destroy wars. Gaijin never get wet; they've
got oils in their pale skins. Dollars go a long way translated into 
any currency.

There's an investigation, Jennifer distraught. She calls on Kon. He
sees death for the first time. It's gaijin death; Kon understands.
Suddenly: Zen, satori! Knows all. Kon knows.

Jennifer and Kon go out to the Darkroom. It's black, blue, like bul-
lets. There's a ledge on one side. They sit. Korean walks into the
glare. He's looking, nervous, edgy. Could it be someone else; they
know all of them know all of them, Kon says. Jennifer says, Kon,
you're prejudiced, ignorant, unknowing-cloud, you haven't got it. Kon
says, Jennifer.

The Korean orders sake. Sake-man says none, besides no heat here, just
the sound. Hole blares from the speakers, pale-faced Alan requests
from the corner. They've got hats. Jennifer knows hatred first-hand,
sees it seething. The Korean turns slowly, as if there were something
on his mind. Kon says, impossible. Jennifer thinks, impolite.

Soon someone will reach for something and it will all begin. It's a
question of time, not Heidegger or Husserl, not being. It's waiting an
instant out, a moment. The Korean gets up to leave. Stop, says
Jennifer, hold on, just a moment. The sky turns blue-black.

Nani says the Korean. Gaijin bastard. You haven't a mother haven't a
father. You came from the clouds. Jennifer whips him across the face;
eyes flash out, sliced last-vision Jennifer down on the ground scream-
ing; she's scrammed. Kon: Don't do that again. You've screwed the
deal.

Tom, Tom, Jennifer says, he's dead. The language is all the way down.


__________________


As for Jennifer, her personality is gentle. Jennifer-san rages late-
night Darkroom, but never again; Nakasha heats up, Tenjin, all the
outlying districts. See gaijin run; Kon gnaws death as for himself.

Kuchi ga gatai, he's closed-mouthed, hard-mouthed; he now watches Kon.
Jennifer-san awakens from a dream of killing, slicing; it's all right.
What was before is the same; Kon's transitive, she thinks. Kon thinks,
she's the one for me. They have tea.

Nothing happened at the Darkroom, Jennifer guesses. She's lost her
name, -san has disappeared. She wants Eigo all the way down, the
tongue of the native, transparent comfort pretending understanding.
All language is viral, poison (she read); it seeps in, obscures, makes
pretty-poison blue-black writing. This _is the case_ she decides,
here! now! She wants to have the description of the world delivered
daily to her front door, no genkan in the way, socks and boots already
facing inside-outside and everywhere.

She doesn't understand, Kon decries, decides. They have tea, toast,
what remains of yesterday's bento. They move on and early-morning out,
already rage against the city. What happened to Tom? What did he speak
with gun-barrel diplomacy, or rather kanji could he read just about
anywhere?

Kuchi ga karui, she'd have a light mouth, ask everyone, spread rumors,
listen everywhere, blabber on, prattle to friends and strangers, talk
and talk until _it_ returned with news, something in a pocket, a trail
leading backwards and forwards, shuttling through snack-bar town.
She'd open herself wide, ready for the fall. She thought Kon: I like
you. Deeper, I love you. Maybe deeper yet, I'm in love with you, or
maybe I'm crazy in love with you, madly in love. She thought Eigo Eng-
lish talk, Jennifer-san, may I speak to you after class? An English is
my owning language. Kon read his name on the bullet.

She read, in blue and black, "The evolution of machines is at first
evident by the fact that they arise in "generations." One after anoth-
er, newer models supersede the older, which often are embedded - let's
call this the distortions of history, somewhat backwards-compatible.
But sooner or later, there's a big leap to a new paradigm, and every-
one is left behind. Capital picks up the pieces: Buy New! And trans-
late the best you can; otherwise, there's nothing to do but start
over."

This Korean who killed Tom for the guns is a machine, she decided,
there's a new game in town. But it's only human species, said Kon,
well, by definition, not so much new under the sun. Certainly not in
the centuries of Fukuoka, everyone business as usual. The guns were
laid out in parallel rows, glittering, glint-glint! as jagged patterns
flashed before Jennifer's eyes, a migraine coming on.

She was gaijin, up to gai-jinx. She lived in a world of pure incompre-
hension, the lessons of school-children, difficult periods, medication
and saki-solace. Japanese would have been another language of smooth
vocalizations, repetitions. Syllabic-hangul Koreans closed in, taking
over yakuza-gaijin connects. Kon thought it was a matter of alphabets,
lean syllables, phonemics, running slipshod across low-bandwidth com-
puters, everything running high-speed forever, wires singing. In
cyberspace, everyone knew their place, a matter of romaji, latin let-
ters. In the future, Kon thought in black and blue, wars will be a
matter of position, citation degree-zero. But not now as pachinko
lights cast spells upon the population, gaijin and native alike. Not
to mention the schoolgirls sliding like eels into the depths of child-
hood, everyone wanting a piece.

Into the maelstrom of the Darkroom, Rumours, Snack-Bar Delight, Kon
and Jennifer plunge; naked beneath their shirts and pants, they clutch
each other, mouths open as if about to speak, recite alphabets and
guns. All the colors in the world, are all the colors in the world.
Now, she takes his gun in, Tom forgotten. Now, every-word-perfection
comes to bare on flesh, a new position for the body as concepts mount
one another, photograph the moment of arousal.

Begin language. Gesture. Some chemical makes response to rhythm; ano-
ther makes visions. Flexible arms and legs. Skin-book, the first book
is the body. Jennifer's nipple pierced by Kon's ring of silver; Jen-
nifer-hiragana across Jon's breast. Numbered into one another. The
dog-eating Korean has the guns. Rumors: look for them, they're looking
for you. Machinic dispositions of reciprocity and exchange. Gears
coagulate out of the beginnings of material culture: Jennifer owns her
ring, Kon, his skin-marks.

Savage names lacerate mobile sites right from the beginning. _No one
understands the name,_ it's the hinge or vortex of incomprehension.
It's too close to the real. The Korean is "the Korean." Tom-dead is
clearly generic; Kon knew he reproduced like water, no-fuck flows and
empty-rhythm culture.

There's no name to truth as bodies wed to earth: "Kon and Jennifer are
marrying." "Kon and Jennifer are getting married," Jennifer teaches.
"But Jennifer is wedded to the earth." Kon, Khan, conquistador and the
dirt of central Asia. He should know. He should know her.

The language is the same all the way across. Across the strait, Pusan
beckons. Kon and Jennifer for the holiday, for the hell of it. They
knew: no truth here. Suddenly: blaze-guns in the streets. They go
down: something's coming!

It's the dog-eating Korean, following them, how? On the ferry, foot,
bicycle. With the new guns, he fires away. Perfect trajectories are
catenaries slightly out of shape, given the earth's tired sphere. A
star-pattern across Pusan's streets, they're running now. Jennifer
thinks Jennifer's fault, she's spread talk everywhere, loose lips,
kuchi ga karui, can't keep her mouth shut, can't keep a secret, asked
too many questions, talked everywhere and everywhere. Her words
flooded the streets of Fukuoka from Chiyo south to Okinawa. Everyone
knew, crazy gaijin with her signs of Eigo, placards of romaji, kanji
boards held taut with gaijin-Tom's improper name.

In Pusan, dust. Policeman Dick is riding by, beauty-bicycle, black and
blue. Policeman Dick's gun puffs, dog-eating Korean is blown away. Now
Kon and Jennifer quietly leave the park for the ferry; they've had
enough! Now they'll wed the water, work through all four elements. Kon
thinks, there's a time for everything; Jennifer knows better. Jennifer
knows she owns time, owns Kon's time, owns all the time in the world.
Jennifer-gaijin is always perfect Jennifer.

Kon and Jennifer reproduce together, and Kon learns the useless value
of collars, electronics, monitoring devices. He takes her silver ring
between his teeth, distends her breast slightly. She can read the
hiragana, Jennifer's true love.

LaminanimaL


Does recursion ever escape? Think of email posts divided _either_ into
threads _or_ into emissions from varied sources: consider sources and
threads: Consider _lamina._

The presence of one or another participant builds towards and through
certain thicknesses: Suddenly, recognition! Over time, enough is never
enough.

What becomes enough is the dissipated solidity of the _aura,_ meetings
in real-life, exchanges of posts, photographs, voices on the Net or
telephone. Between lower ascii and Net-phone, the bandwidth is enor-
mous.

Think of repeated posts from a single emission (which may possess mul-
tiple sources) as the construction of lamina: Intersections may reveal
only the slowing-transforming presence of the .sig file for example.

The thicknesses might be considered skins, interacting, interstitial,
fatty-tissues thorugh which certain characteristics become evident.
Look at the accumulation here! What gives?

All these sources from a single emission - addresses from a single
participant. Or unified participant, or not - postmodern, broken, the
division of virtual subjectivity.

But there is a recursion at work, induction across a series of state-
ments: Surely, there's a point of view in all of this!

If only that the viewpoint is _multiple,_ fragmented itself, but yet -
there's no escape from recursion!

Unless, that is, towards the infinite, as in the Ackermann function
which _changes operations with each reiteration_ - from addition to
multiplcation to powers to ... You might find that 2 R 2 = 4 all
through the series. You might also revert to an earlier stage than
addition (carry the function backwards) -

To a basic reiteration-operation, similar to " ' ", as in 0' = 1. But
enough! Who's looking?

And I'd like to go _the other way_ here, to the infinite posts, in-
finite lamina, the _flood from emissions,_ infinity of sources! Is
this what's human? Transspecies? (For one cannot be absolutely certain
of the _organisms_ behind, without, or embedded within the Net!)

Towards this ...thickness... that seems to be developing over the
wires, through the air, cauterized in fact _across_ conduits of all
sorts - _characteristic_ of the phenomenology of conduits themselves!
In this part of the twenty-first century!

What comes around _no longer forms a circulation,_ but _circulations
form what might be considered the image of the source,_ instead of
_the source of the image._ Or rather, the images of the sources, the
_ghast_ behind emission.

Which is always already a matter of reading, perceiving, ascertaining.
So far.

Until the realm of the physical, etc. is invaded, etc. Until the real,
etc. Until the real, is.


"In the proposed analysis, instead of referring back to _the_ synthe-
sis or _the_ unifying function of _a_ subject, the various enunciative
modalities manifest his [sic] dispersion. To the various statuses, the
various sites, the various positions that he can occupy or be given
when making a discourse. To the discontinuity of the planes from which
he speaks. And if these planes are linked by a system of relations,
this system is not established by the synthetic activity of a con-
sciousness identical with itself, dumb and anterior to all speech, but
by the specificity of a discursive practice. I shall abandon any
attempt, therefore, to see discourse as a pehnomenon of expression -
the verbal translation of a previously established synthesis; instead,
I shall look for a field of regularity for various positions of sub-
jectivity. Thus conceived, discourse is not the majestically unfolding
manifestation of a thinking, knowing, speaking subject, but, on the
contrary, a totality, in which the dispersion of the subject and his
discontinuity with hiself may be determined. It is a space of exter-
iority in which a network of distinct sites is deployed." (Foucault,
The Archaeology of Knowledge.)

N. B.


There's a bomber in our midst, here in Fukuoka. He works for a secret
army of terrorists supporting various anti-imperialist causes. He uses
several names, having been given the nomenclature of the Empire, hav-
ing abandoned it.

Lately he's taken to carrying packages into the teacher's room at one
of the universities here. Left behind, they almost always contain
lunch-food (bento, bread, brie, beer), and, as if in excess or resi-
due, a kanji dictionary, perhaps kanji to romaji or kanji to english -
perhaps english to kanji or romaji to kanji. The outer rim, english to
romaji, romaji to english, seems to be ignored. Seems to be.

I can imagine the kanji-strokes up in flames, violation-samurai-kanji
piercing tetsugaku, philosophy, hard and heated killing as english-
as-foreign-language teachers go up in flames and sharpnel. Already
fear strikes the students; I have heard tales of New York, Boston, Los
Angeles, although the bomber is from _elsewhere,_ I might say, his
phials cloistered in innocent refrigerators on several campuses.

Me, I'm lonely, waiting for something to happen. Out of the charred
flesh, the perfect reader will emerge. I'll have my texts settled once
and for all.

But until then...

When the Symbol isn't Reading, Read


Myouka learning kanji: Take the symbol for yen - you see it every-
where in Japan, where, at least, you know what you're paying, even if
you don't know what you're paying, for.

I recognize the symbol everywhere, read it as "yen."

But I don't read it, nor do I know the _gift_ of the symbol _for_ yen,
which is foreign to my thought, just as "y," "e," "n," do not consti-
tute the symbol-for-yen, but instead, _spell yen out._

Spelling-out is constructed from the double-articulation of alphabet
and word: Alphabet is adjunct to the word, supple tool or mechanism
(high use-value) which is applicable to _any_ word, new or older or
foreign.

In Hebrew, the relationship is one-to-one: Know the spelling (includ-
ing the vowel dots), and you know the word. This works in reverse as
well, almost entirely.

In English, we know "off," "cough," "rough," "huff," and so forth -
and there are those who consider, as a result, English ideogrammatic.
But even if so, there are only 26 ideograms, entirely.

Think of kanji broken-articulations, roots here and there, stroke
order, blocked ideograms which are irreducible. Think of a dictionary
of 500, 6000, 45,000. In a sense this is easy enough. Children learn
one or two kanji a day, by rote.

But I think that the kanji for "yen," and _the word itself_ are visit-
ing each other, contingent at best, in spite of the _image_ or poten-
tial story of the symbol. And I cannot _see_ this relationship; it
breaks internally, although quite familiar.

It doesn't feel like reading. It feels like an infinite distance be-
tween strokes and word, strokes and meaning. It's lost on me.

Three symbols for "Western Japan," Nishi Nippon. Three more for jido-
sha, automobile. Sha, wheel, like a chariot from above - body, axle,
wheels on both sides. I can recognize them, the Western Japan Auto-
mobile place where you might get your cars worked on. Memorized the
tripling of symbol, word, and meaning.

Still cut open, so I can't read, can't write. Still broken in two.

_Elsewhere,_ I recuperate my writing, bring it in, bring it together,
comfortable with lower ascii. It slips too easily from its moorings. I
make mistakes (but words aren't things). I confuse myself (but things
_are_ by virtue of words).

At a loss, I dream of strokes, thick black ink pouring over everything
in the world, culture's burial in the hysteria of viscous speech.

Every post an ideogram, every entry in netindex.txt (indexing Internet
Text at http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html
or http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt) a totality, construct, as
if there were no other, as if each ideogram were the last, as if the
_natural_ were reasserting itself once again.

The ideogrammatic lends itself to misrecognition and the delusion of the
bracketing of origins: Just as _this_ means _that,_ so I assert that _A_
is _B_ and describe what might be considered the material or _stuff_ of
meaning. 

Consensus disappears in the dream, when it's revealed that screens are
just that, and that no one seems to cast a shadow.
