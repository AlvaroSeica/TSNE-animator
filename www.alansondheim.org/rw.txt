Music Improvisation: New course at Underacademy College!

There are other great classes as well! Check them all out!
Free! Experimental!

http://underacademycollege.wordpress.com/
http://underacademycollege.wordpress.com/studies/courses/

What is musical improvisation? Why do we do this? Why do we do 
music at all? We'll consider this and other issues and post / 
critique musical files through a blog interface. We'll see if we 
can find a way to improvise communally online or off. Please 
sign up if you're seriously interested in the subject; I'd like 
to try to assemble a body of writing and work. There are no 
assignments per se, except to post your thoughts and sounds; the 
course will grow organically.

Please note that this will begin around March 20th. I'm hoping 
we can discuss the aesthetics of improvisation, find ways to 
play online together, and discussion improvisational structures, 
venues, etc. etc. Just about anything.

Thanks and have fun!

Cultures of Internet
Sondheim, Alan, Being on Line

1 The current state of the Internet. Who is using it, what is it, what
are the services and applications associated with it? What are the 
current demographics? 

2 The future state of the Internet. Where is it going in the next few
years? Will it be able to keep pace with the increasing number of users?
How are demographics changing? Entertainment vs. information visions.
The other visions of business and community: How do applications such as
the World Wide Web determine what is possible on the Net? How is the
user "configured" by these applications?

3 Radio, television, film beginnings: What sorts of parallels can we draw?
What similarities are there between contemporary computer communication 
and short-wave radio or cb, for example? Also: Analog and digital media,
and the relationship between the two.

3 Synchronous and asynchronous applications. What constitutes a data-
base? What audio and video modalities are becoming available and how do
these affect the user? Many-to-many, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one
applications. What is the future of "virtual persona" or "avatars" on the
Net?

4 Issues of the body: reading through the text, hysteria, net.sex and
the "ascii unconscious," postmodernism and the fragmented self. Sex, love,
and death in cyberspace. Cyberspace relations and the nuclear family. 
Internet marriages and relationships.

5 Virtual subjectivity. Projections and introjections. "Reality" and the
grain of the voice, death and rape in cyberspace. Hallucinatory person-
alities, Net personalities. Various spaces in Cyberspace: MOOs, Usenet,
email lists.

6 Privacy, security, community, and confession on the Net. Groups and
counter-groups. Alt.society.neutopia and the monster-truck neutopians. 
Alt.angst, Walkers in Darkness, and other support newsgroups and email 
lists. 

7 Hacking, cracking, and the anarcho-libertarian aspects of the Net.
Spamming. The changing demographics/cultures as a result of the World
Wide Web. The future of the Web, chat-lines, and so forth.

8 Community Organization: Forms of outreach. Freenets, Community Access 
Points, conferencing tools and strategies. Kiosks, from government to 
Siggraph.

9 Strategies for research and organizing information and personal/formal 
databanks. Search engines and Boolean searching. Web page information 
structure and philosophy: access for all.

10 Community organization, continued: Levels of entry into the Net. Models
of Internet economic and cultural development. Practical and theoretical

My panel talk at the glitch panel, SXSW

http://www.alansondheim.org/sxsw.mp3

The panel was "2012: Year of the GLI.TC/H"
Panelists were Jon Cates, Jon Satrom, Patrick
Lichty, myself, all thanks to Bishop Zareh,
who brilliantly organized the whole thing.
The panel lasted an hour in the Longhorn Room,
Omni Downtown, under the sub-category
"Art + Inspiration."

disclaimers: I meant Iraq when I said Iran; I didn't
mean to imply to the Involuntaries came out of the
avatar work; I'm not sure I mentioned Maud Liardon's
name, I didn't have time to thank everyone at Chicago
and WVU; I stumbled a bit about the theoretical 
material which I really didn't cover; I forgot to 
show the Facebook profile picture of the wounded WWI
soldier; I recorded at too high a volume; I didn't
record others; I had the recorder awkwardly set. On
the other hand, a lot of material was shown and 
people were excited about it all. The Razorfish 
presentation was similar but shorter and cut off in 
the middle of a video. Hope you get something out of
this; most but not all of the images (video/still)
are older, but not all. Finally I didn't mean to 
sound like such an idiot about erasing my Odyssey
platform at the end of the last performance with 
Sandy Baldwin. Everything was improvised, I did my
best.



===============================================

some thought about augmented reality (ar)
(before and after sxsw)

===============================================

1 ar is localized 
 ar -> {x sub y}

2 ar is interference (googleglass)
 entanglement

3 ar is distancing (lorenz, ethology, avoidive behavior)
in terms of active engagement
 drawing distinction, 'defoliation'

4 ar is technology- and corporate- dependent
 capital multiflux jitters, hyper-hyperbole

5 ar is protocol- and codec- dependent
 codework internalized

6.ar is clever
 ar is w(W)ired

7 ar has the potential for deep history and deep ecology
 historiographies

8 ar like tablets creates class distinctions in the school
system
 capital / Kapital

9 ar needs to get rid of external in favor of embedded
technologies
 on the level of the sensory aegis

10 ar is coming whatever one thinks of it: ar is here
 corporate, ar -> {W}

11 ar may be distancing in terms of passive engagement -
think of issues of slaughter, pain, resource consumption,
etc.
 image epistemology, bypass surgery, suture 

12 ar will increasingly be independent of technological
sophistication on the part of the user
 autonomic somaticism

13 military drones are the most sophisticated application
of ar: why are we not making the connection?
 tunneling effects, embedded theory

14 w/ googleglass privacy is destroyed: the third person
devours the first person transformed into the second 
person
 ar will talk not to you but among you

15 does augmentation always improve the quality of our
lives?
 lifeworlds and does it matter?

16 ar is useful in specific situations - say, the 
location of mines in mine-fields, in surgeries, in
situations that involve specificity and deep knowledge
 deep geographies, geopolitics

17 ar is useful as a demonstration of ar, of what lies
behind the ordinary - mark skwarek's erasure of the dmz
 but what lies behind is digital, truth is problematic,
 anything may be inserted

18 in this sense ar is highly useful as a symbolic
construct
 or the symbolic

19 and in this sense the recording of ar for others is 
equally useful as a symbolic construct - it presents 
the subjunctive
 potential individual communality beneath the sign of
 capital

20 ar -> digital over or among analog - what are the
phenomenologies here? what are the potentials or
dangers, what entanglements, what flows of capital?

Hi - Need help! I'm giving a panel talk at the Hastac Conference in 
Toronto, at the end of April; my proposal was as follows -

"I'd like to do a full talk, dealing with What is to be Done, with issues
of animal and plant extinctions, with degrees of hopelessness, with the
mass Permian extinction, with images of escape in Second Life and
elsewhere, with the damnation of technophilia and Google Glasses. I would
talk from notes and project, not read a paper (I never write papers to
read), but could turn the notes in later of course. This is a theme I've
been harping on more and more - how to deal with absolute despair and the
despair of the absolute."

I've written out (most of) an outline below, and would appreciate any
comments you might have. I realize my naivete in relation to the subject,
and I'm trying to get away from just "gut feelings" and say something
useful, with some sort of clarity. Please send me any thoughts; you can
write me back-channel (what an old expression!) and thanks,

- Alan

=================================

a. I am no expert in plant and animal extinctions; things seem complex on
the level of the species, and here I deeply find myself at a loss; there
are too many contradictory statistics for a layperson to disentangle, not
the least of which is the definition of 'species' (for example, there are
subspecies, morphs, etc.), and species' interrelationships.

a.1. I am also no expert in bio-ethics or ethics in general. I do believe
that the habitus, biome, communality, are more important than individual
saves which take on symbolic status and often lead nowhere. I don't
believe in instrumentalist arguments, that the natural should be saved by
virtue of its use-value (say, for 'new medications'); I don't think any
functionalist reason plays out in the long run. I think species should be
saved because _they are there._

a.1.a. The problem with symbolic value is that the most attractive or cute
species (in terms of human perception) are often the ones that are saved
and considered valuable, while other species that are less appealing are
left by the wayside.

b. There are three economies: political, financial, attention; each of
these vies in terms of saving species or biomes.

c. Every species has an equally lengthy holarchic history (including
bacteria, mitochondria, etc.); each history is a sign and organism
resonant with the origin of life itself.

d. Each organism has its own world-view, Umwelt, Weltanschauung. Each is
alterity and project to every other. Each possesses individual and
communal culture. Each participates in negation and learning.

e. Each is driven to extinction by the other. Each other collapses into
either grotesque anomaly (asteroid, volcano) or the human, somewhere along
the line.

f. Each is a projection and introjection of the world; each is immersive,
each is entangled, abject, somewhat definable.

g. The extinction of any species is a permanent and irrevocable loss; the
death of any individual is the same. Histories condense and disperse,
homes disappear, the world flattens.

h. Our era is not a repetition, say, of the Permian extinctions; it is
other, it is slaughter, and it brings pain from one species to many. The
death of an adult reproducer is the death of offspring, who may or may not
have already made their way into the world.

i. Our language betrays us: there are no weeds, no vermin. We define the
world in terms of our desires and their negations.

j. We are defined by our slaughters. We are hopeless, driven to the deaths
of others; the death drive literally drives species, herds, hordes, before
it; the death drive results in total annihilation.

k. What is to be done? I am always surprised how few artists are concerned
about the environment - other than creating networks and new forms of
nodes and dwellings within it. How few media artists even bother with PETA
for example, or conservation. How many artists, driven by teleology, are
always already on the hunt for new forms of mappings, new modes of data
analytics.  How we abjure responsibility, disconnect radically. How we
favor the human over other species.

l. Certainly the digital, even augmented reality or Google Glass, creates
distance between ourselves and the world around us; what's added are bits.
This distancing, which is both clever and fast-forward technology-driven,
may be more part of the problem than the solution. I think of 'Internet
hunting' for example, tv/video programs like Survivor or The Great Race
(both of which can only damage pristine environments), etc.; on the other
hand, bird-, nest- and waterhole-watches might well serve to awaken
people's consciousness.

m. How do we handle this on a personal level? If we're driven to
catatonia, we're doomed. I haven't been able to accept the Buddhist
account of suffering and enlightenment; the result is an almost constant
state of anguish, that is to say a condition that is a combination of
Lyotard's differend, a sense of helplessness, and a sense of the
destruction of worlds.


=======================================

[Quote below from World Wildlife Federation]

WWF:

Just to illustrate the degree of biodiversity loss we're facing, let.s
take you through one scientific analysis... The rapid loss of species we
are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000
times higher than the natural extinction rate.* These experts calculate
that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year.
If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that
there are around 2 million different species on our planet** - then that
means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year. But if the upper
estimate of species numbers is true - that there are 100 million different
species co-existing with us on our planet - then between 10,000 and
100,000 species are becoming extinct each year.

*Experts actually call this natural extinction rate the background
extinction rate. This simply means the rate of species extinctions that
would occur if we humans were not around.

** Between 1.4 and 1.8 million species have already been scientifically
identified.




Swollen: solo sarangi with octave halver

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1080 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/swollen.mp3

I just love this piece! It carries the depth
that I want from bowed instruments; using 
octave halving gives me the doubling of the
instrumentation. I was thinking of shakuhachi
playing and enlightenment throughout. And I 
was thinking how absolutely great this would
have sounded at SXSW! Please for Sakyamuni's
sake ENJOY!




Audition

so today I went to my favorite pawnshop and found a dirty
messed-up electric guitar with the name 'Audition' on it,
with four strings, two of the geared tuners broken, pretty
much rusted tailpiece, one knob missing, one that wouldn't 
turn, a broken and useless nut. so for $20 I got the thing
plus a four-string nut, tuned the four strings like a pipa 
- ADEa - cleaned the instrument, got the knobs to work,
used wire to cut out as much of the hum as possible (the
pickups aren't hum-bucking) and have had a grand old time
with the instrument, which it turns out sells from $400-
$500 in good condition, from 1965 made by Teisco in Japan.
I love the oddly dirty sound and can use it when I'm with
sax players; anyway here are three pieces:

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1081 (best)
 - but see the following descriptions -
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/audition1.mp3
 - this is a blues improvisation - the first music 
 I learned was the blues - not so much the commercial
 stuff - fairly slow here -
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/audition2.mp3
 - more experimental work taking advantage of the 
 pipa tuning (which I used for all of these) -
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/audition3.mp3
 - just a minor scale improvisation but I like its
 energy -

==================

AVATARS AND THEORY

==================


I started working with avatars in text-based applications such as 
newsgroups, email lists, MOOs, LPMUDs, and IRC. Below is a list of what 
I perceived as their common characters - and the relationship of those 
characteristics to everyday, i.e. non-CMC, life. Current notes are in 
brackets.



==================

JENNIFER, JULU, NIKUKO, ALAN

==================


1 system resonances - what entrances and exits available - sendmail for 
example (from telnet 25 to configuration files), doctor for another [at 
this point text-based avatars were attached to applications that were not 
avatar-based. on the other hand the Eliza program in emacs allowed for the 
development of personality and dialog, and might be one of the first 
online avatar environments.]

2 explorations of self and fragmentations - discomforts, tremblings as 
totality is problematized [this tends towards issues of abjection, 
wounding, frisson, arousal, and death within the virtual - which might 
cynically be seen as nothing more than a rearrangement of digital bits.]

3 psychotic emanations - selves generating worlds, inability to return or 
manipulate one in relation to another [the worlds such as IRC were widely 
disparate and appeared autonomous; to carry Jennifer from one to another 
required reassertions. the same is true today, but mixed-reality work 
tends to blur all of this - in other wor(l)ds the environments exist in 
potential wells that allow tunneling.]

4 perturbations within systems - IRC or alt.jen-coolest for examples [it 
was, and still is, possible to perturb systems, to work at the edges of 
the game space, to hack and infiltrate - annihilating a performance 
platform at the end of a performance in Second Life, or having human 
performs work at the edges of a mocap space are two examples.]

5 theoretical turns - Jennifer's 'panties on the ground' - desire in 
relation to metaphysical system building [sexual-theoretical turns, as 
both male and female avatars operated within fetishization and abjection, 
two trends that have become commonplace in virtual sexuality. what happens 
when an avatar is 'in tatters,' falling apart, collapsing?]

6 problematics of author and authoring - 'deaths of authors' [like the 
uncanny between real and virtual worlds, there is an uncanny between 
avatar creator/controller/human performer and avatar; through an analysis 
of projection and introjection, avatar and (presumably) human become 
inextricably entangled.]

7 multiculturalisms (Nikuko), sexualities (Julu), Alan and the rhetoric 
of innocence [multiculturalisms extend to virtual cultures and their 
ethnographies, but what occurs in the virtual doesn't stay in the 
virtual.]

8 duals and dialogs, dialectic - talker or MOO explorations (wanderings 
and fabrications of spaces) [these explorations have moved of course into 
OpenSim and Second Life, but the concepts of historiography, broken 
projects, avatar absences, debris, etc. remain the same.]

9 stutterings, etc. - manipulated texts - the problematic of speaking, 
including breakdowns of first/second/third persons [textual stuttering can 
blur diegesis, tense, and person; it can play off inner speech, it can 
speak among- or for-, it can reveal psychoanalytical debris.]

10 ontic explorations - ghosts and other emanations (the videos) - 
elements of disappearances, sadomasochisms, bindings and controls - the 
nature of writing and inscription [again in this early outline, sexuality 
makes an appearance. not only are ontologies blurred, but the very nature 
of control becomes messy and obscured in terms of agency. social media 
obscures and hides: think of Facebook for example as a sado-masochistic 
theater, with non-existent keywords and with hidden, unknown, power 
dispersing and controlling your self-image, and your image of other's 
selves.]

11 sexualities - multiples, topologies, exchanges (Nikuko), dismemberings 
(Julu-function), affect (Alan) [selves split, bots are everywhere, avatar 
bots are wonders of control and one can imagine such control as looped and 
continuous, eventually becoming the real/virtual landscape itself. all of 
this relates to the _obscene,_ which has been shown to operate differently 
in the brain; 'primitive' processes are called up, and language becomes 
threat, arousal, and other. sexualities operate everywhere in social media 
and virtual worlds, and the cartoon-like visuals in the latter play deeply 
into fantasy introjection and projection. humans are just at the beginning 
of understanding this, ignoring their animal and primate present.]

12 dismemberments - part-objects, splays, ruptures, s/ms, emissions [this 
ties quickly into the world-theater of slaughter and corruption, plant and 
animal extinctions, neo-liberalism and corporate enclaving: hiding the 
parts in relation to a simulacrum of the w/hole. in a sense this is the 
heart of an analysis that works with the engine of subterfuge and death.]

13 language and performativities - javascript, julu-function, julu- or 
jennifer-pages [after this, a bit of Visual Basic. i've used Perl for text 
manipulation, Emacs Lisp for reworking Eliza, scripting in Second Life, 
etc., but always with help; I'm not a programmer, just a kludger. but I 
sometimes start talks with the phenomenology of performative language; for
example 
k2% date
Mon Mar 18 12:40:35 EDT 2013
where a command is qualitative transformed into an unforeseen result 
(unforeseen in the sense that it occupies a different epistemological 
regime) - and how this has utterly transformed our notion of the 
fundamental depth and obdurate nature of analogic reality.]

14 constitutive realities - nature of the digital, Jennifer "having all 
the time in the world," holarchic spaces and levels, fully-determined 
worldings, towards - [this get complicated - the digital as cleansed, 
corporate, codec/corporate-driven, capable of infinite raster, problemat- 
izing the truth, capable of controlling everything. in the real world, 
digital and analog are entangled, holarchic (tangled hierarchically). 
digital worlds are less and less fully-determined - too complex, too many 
glitches (which are seeds for other things), too leaky, too multiply- 
connected, too mixed with the real - they're part and parcel of everyday 
life, at least for humans.]

15 future seamless virtual realities, moving across cyberplains, fluid 
architectures and entities, etc. [this is still a goal, but instead of the 
analog embedded in the digital, at least for the foreseeable future, the 
digital is embedded in the analog - in other words, we are all avatars, 
and those who are relatively disconnected may well feel the wrath of our 
slaughter.]

HASTAC Text revised:



Panel notes on plant and animal extinctions, revised:

Notes for a panel talk at the Hastac Conference in Toronto, at the end of 
April; my proposal was as follows -

"I'd like to do a full talk, dealing with What is to be Done, with issues
of animal and plant extinctions, with degrees of hopelessness, with the
mass Permian extinction, with images of escape in Second Life and
elsewhere, with the damnation of technophilia and Google Glasses. I would
talk from notes and project, not read a paper (I never write papers to
read), but could turn the notes in later of course. This is a theme I've
been harping on more and more - how to deal with absolute despair and the
despair of the absolute."

- This is where I'm at now; newer comments are in brackets. I'm taking on 
too much here; I feel that my view of the world is personally colored by 
the effects of ageism and its accompanying deinstitutionalization (a 
terrible word!). I hope this is still of interest, and that the comments 
make sense to you. And I particularly want to thank  the people who have 
taken time to reply to me; I'm glad there's still optimism out there!)

=================================

a. I am no expert in plant and animal extinctions; things seem complex on
the level of the species, and here I deeply find myself at a loss; there
are too many contradictory statistics for a layperson to disentangle, not
the least of which is the definition of 'species' (for example, there are
subspecies, morphs, etc.), and species' interrelationships.

a.1. I am also no expert in bio-ethics or ethics in general. I do believe 
that the habitus, biome, communality, are more important than individual 
saves which take on symbolic status and often lead nowhere. (On the other 
hand, as Jon Marshall points out, symbolic action is at least a first 
step.) I don't believe in instrumentalist arguments, that the natural 
should be saved by virtue of its use-value (say, for 'new medications'); I 
don't think any functionalist reason plays out in the long run. I think 
species should be saved because _they are there._ [I recognize the logical 
fallacy in this, but that isn't the point. I also recognize that the world 
was never, and never will be, pristine - that it has always been morally 
and ethically problematic from the viewpoint of any positioning of good or 
evil. I worry about the loss of the fecundity of the world, the amazing 
diversity of ecological niches - everything will be the poorer, for 
example, when the coral reefs disappear. Perhaps some of the anguish about 
extinction originates with this knowledge, that species, including 
ourselves, are useless, that intrinsic value is local and has no other 
foundation than personal taste or desire. Spirituality clearly makes a 
difference in this situation, but, at least for me, spirituality is always 
suspect and hardly foundation; it just throws imminence into immanence. So 
this is a weak point of my thinking, but that's also a weak point among 
the human project - just as there may be no first cause, there may be no 
fundamental value that might function as surrogate or catalyst.]

a.1.a. The problem with symbolic value is that the most attractive or cute
species (in terms of human perception) are often the ones that are saved
and considered valuable, while other species that are less appealing are
left by the wayside. [It is also very unclear that species can be saved in 
isolation, i.e. without their habitus, their biome. One major problem here 
is that of territoriality and the neurosis that ensues by salvaging a 
small population and placing them in save but relatively small 'foreign' 
havens. A second problem, hardly considered in the past, is that animals 
have culture 'all the way down,' and isolated individuals, as with human 
animals, can't carry the weight of communal knowledge.]

b. There are three economies: political, financial, attention; each of
these vies in terms of saving species or biomes. [What are the politics 
for example of bushmeat? What might replace the economic or other gains of 
poaching? And what species do we deem 'deserving' of attention? 
Eliminating the criterion of attractiveness doesn't solve this problem, 
since there is literally no way humans can pay attention to every species, 
every biome, etc. Just as there's an economy of attention on the Net, 
there are economies of attention within the 'real' world - this is where 
Drew Leder's work on 'the absent body' comes into play.]

c. Every species has an equally lengthy holarchic history (including 
bacteria, mitochondria, etc.); each history is a sign and organism 
resonant with the origin of life itself. [This is important; there are no 
'primitive' species just as there are no 'primitive' peoples. There are 
some characteristics of contemporary species that can be traced farther 
back than others, and these could be labeled 'primitive' - but given, for 
example, the recent discovery of relatively advanced brains in early 
animals, even this classification is suspect. Everything that survives in 
an oddly temporal sense is equivalent to everything else that survives. 
The issue actually transforms to those species which might be considered 
'generalist' and those which live within specific (and often somewhat 
isolated) niches; the latter are of course much more at risk.]

d. Each organism has its own world-view, Umwelt, Weltanschauung. Each is
alterity and project to every other. Each possesses individual and
communal culture. Each participates in negation and learning. [Heinz von 
Foerster spoke of life entailing negation, and negation as fundamental: 
turn away from something. And turning-away is also a sign of culture; 
further, what one turns away from is dependent on the niches an organism 
can survive in - different niches have different dangers.]

e. Each is driven to extinction by the other. Each other collapses into 
either grotesque anomaly (asteroid, volcano) or the human, somewhere along 
the line. [This isn't entirely true; communality and altruism occur inter- 
and intra-species. But species do have life-spams; ironically of course we 
know only the life-spans of species which have already gone extinct, and 
it's difficult to generalize. (However statistical generalizations do 
exist.) The same is true of our own deaths, and just as mourning the death 
of a friend or relative is an anguish which is irretrievable in terms of 
its object, so mourning the disappearance of a species is similar (even if 
individuals of that species may be brought back into existence, the 
culture is gone). Most of us don't mourn extinctions in the same way, but 
there is, I believe, a sense of anguish at the heart of these as well.]

f. Each is a projection and introjection of the world; each is immersive, 
each is entangled, abject, somewhat definable. [Each species is in dialog 
with the rest of the world, which is also within each individual, just as 
humans are fecund with bacteria and other micro-organisms, even within the 
cell itself. So to talk of projecting _into_ the world, or introjecting 
_from_ the world is more than a gross over-simplification; for this reason 
I tend to use the neologism 'jectivity' to imply holarchic connectivities 
between what _might_ be labeled an individual and its internality, and 
what _might_ be labeled an external world. For this reason, I see crude 
parallels between thinking through species and organisms, and the 
philosophy of quantum mechanics; I'm not arguing for another pseudo-model 
from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, so much as thinking about all 
varieties of entanglements, including Feynman diagrams, virtual particle,
tunneling, and so forth. Think of the world, not as mind, but as 
fermenting, for example.]

g. The extinction of any species is a permanent and irrevocable loss; the 
death of any individual is the same. Histories condense and disperse, 
homes disappear, the world flattens. [New histories arise, new mementos, 
memories, languages, technologies, storage mechanisms. Increased 
population, global warming, and other uncomfortable signs, however, all 
point towards a diminution in richness; species are disappearing for 
example faster than new ones are appearing. The biomass of the world may 
remain somewhat constant, given that decay species and micro-organisms 
within rock-strata and beneath the ocean floor remain the same in volume, 
but the variety is collapsing; the anthropocene is being compared to the 
Permian extinction in this regard. See below and above.]

h. Our era is not a repetition, say, of the Permian extinctions; it is
other, it is slaughter, and it brings pain from one species to many. The
death of an adult reproducer is the death of offspring, who may or may not
have already made their way into the world. [It is slaughter, even legacy 
slaughter, in many cases legacy hunting. It causes enormous pain; in 
addition the narrowing or elimination of habitats, the increase in 
pollutants, etc. - all take their unnatural toll, as does the development 
and use of genetically-modified plants. As populations increase, we are 
turning the world into our own infertile image. There's no doubt that the 
very wealthy will survive and even benefit from all of this; increasingly 
enclaved, they're safe for the foreseeable future - literally foreseeable, 
for one or two generations at best.]

i. Our language betrays us: there are no weeds, no vermin. We define the
world in terms of our desires and their negations. [This has always 
bothered me, this division into useful and useless, ornamental and pest, 
etc. It governs our vision of 'wilderness,' such as it is, as well as what 
sure and should not be allowed to survive in urban areas.]

j. We are defined by our slaughters. We are hopeless, driven to the deaths 
of others, driving species, herds, hordes, before us. Ultimately, we may 
be headed towards total annihilation. This is not deliberate; we're not 
all hunters for example. But we're a species in bloom, and that, along 
with the increasing need for food, is taking its toll. [This is nothing 
more than a _cris de coeur_ - it's where anguish begins and refuses to 
disappear. Not all of us are driven to killing of course, but the tendency 
is in that direction - killing need not be advertent.]

k. What is to be done? I'm surprised how few artists are concerned about 
the environment - other than creating networks and new forms of nodes and 
dwellings within it. How few media artists even bother with PETA for 
example, or conservation. How many artists, driven by teleology, are 
always already on the hunt for new forms of mappings, new modes of data 
analytics. How we abjure responsibility, disconnect radically. How we 
favor the human over other species. [I have no idea about the truth of 
this; what I'm writing here is only from personal, not broader, experience 
or knowledge. Certainly the 'next greatest thing' dominates our thinking, 
as do Facebook proverbs, Twitter's 140, or Wired magazine's "Forget all 
you know about {x}" - every innovation is yet another revolution. We are 
in love with our technophilia, and we see technological answers to just 
about everything, from energy to death to the reconstitution of the 
natural world. The empirical or concrete muck of the real is another 
matter altogether, and it's this disassociation that seems to me, ensures 
that the extinction catastrophe will continue.]

l. Certainly the digital, even augmented reality or Google Glass, creates
distance between ourselves and the world around us; what's added are bits.
This distancing, which is both clever and fast-forward technology-driven,
may be more part of the problem than the solution. I think of 'Internet
hunting' for example, tv/video programs like Survivor or The Great Race
(both of which can only damage pristine environments), etc.; on the other
hand, bird-, nest- and waterhole-watches might well serve to awaken
people's consciousness. [This is yet only more of the same. I don't think 
that more theoretical analysis will do very much; what's needed is 
concrete action, working with government and organizations like Nature 
Conservancy. Consciousness has to be raised, primarily with K-12 - and 
it's in this area, in public schooling, that we're failing the most, with 
emphasis placed on the damnation of teachers, continual testing, limited 
play, limited time for the old 'natural sciences,' limited monies for art 
or music, limited monies for special ed. and even physical ed. in some 
cases, and so forth. There's too much emphasis placed on STEM - most of 
which is, of course, testable in a way that art and the softer sciences 
may not be - and too little emphasis placed on play, revamping the 
schools, calling on teachers as resources instead of demons and so forth. 
It's disenheartening, and it is, I think, the future. Instead of raising 
consciousness or bringing up difficult questions of ethics, we're 
preparing workforces with even greater disconnect between ongoing 
slaughter and technology.]

m. How do we handle this on a personal level? If we're driven to
catatonia, we're doomed. I haven't been able to accept the Buddhist
account of suffering and enlightenment; the result is an almost constant
state of anguish, that is to say a condition that is a combination of
Lyotard's differend, a sense of helplessness, and a sense of the
destruction of worlds. [And I have to end here; I could write out the 
usual calls to action, but I doubt, given our inertia, that it would make 
any difference at all. And I have no idea if my analysis or prognoses are 
correct; in spite of my reading and amateurish naturalism, I'm ignorant. 
The best I can do is call attention to the problem, which, as I've been 
told repeatedly by people, is really no problem at all, but the natural 
order of things. That I can't buy, and the dialog breaks off here.]

=======================================

From an email exchange (and thanks to everyone who wrote in) -

"[...] I hate the idea of a 'posthuman' critique of mass extinctions: such 
extinctions are slaughter, painful, abject, and 'critique' seems almost 
obscene in relation to them. To me it doesn't matter if 'extinction' is 
politically loaded: it carries as much of an absolute truth as possible 
about the world; when a species is gone, it's _gone,_ and its entire 
lineage is _gone_; there is no recourse, no politics, nothing to return 
it, in spite of Wired and other sources yammering about resuscitation 
through DNA. You don't have enough of a community to sustain gene 
variability. It's death. It's absolute death. It's Kurtz's Horror."

From a second exchange:

"Diversity won't reassert itself in denuded and polluted areas. I talked 
to Azure about this; she has a master's degree in environmental 
conservation education, and reiterated what I said but more strongly - 
that the news is all bad. Yes, something will emerge millions of years 
from now, just as something emerged after the Permian extinction. But past 
extinctions weren't the result of a supposedly moral or ethical species; 
they were the result of asteroids or volcanic eruptions (and I suspect in 
some cases viruses or prions, but I may well be wrong about this). This is 
the first time another species - wildly out of control and in bloom - has 
wreaked this kind of devastation. And it's the first time it's happened so 
quickly; species are disappearing at the rate of several per hour. Most of 
them aren't even tracked or understood yet, but that's not the point; the 
point is the slaughter and the pollution - for example the micro-plastic 
spheres in cosmetics that run up the food chain, or the floating islands 
of plastic trash in the oceans, or the particulate matter pollution in our 
part of NYC, or the Appalachian rivers running like orange soda (result 
from mine pollution), or the exponential increase in global warming, etc. 
etc. There's so much data; I get it daily, and not from 'leftist' sources 
for that matter. And the data isn't only about elephants and rhinos and 
polar bears; it's about birds you and I probably haven't heard of before, 
alpine biomes collapsing, the rapid disappearing of Madagascar lemurs and 
other flora and fauna, the lack of young saguaro cacti in the US south- 
west, disappearing bees, Monarch butterflies down 61% in just the last 
year, the hemlocks disappearing because of invasive species, the 
Everglades down to less than 1% of their previous flora and fauna, the 
results of the Yellow River damming, the 100 million or so sharks killed 
yearly for shark-fin soup and because they're 'dangerous,' the elimination 
of wolves everywhere in the continental US, the massacre/disappearance of 
native bats here, Hawaiian birds, the disease killing off the Tasmanian 
Devils, as well as the rapid increase of desertification world-wide, the 
release of methane from Siberian and Canadian permafrost which is 
speeding up global warming, the almost complete extinction now of bonobo, 
gorillas, chimps, and other primates in the world - and so forth. DDT's 
banned in the US but not in large parts of the world where it continues to 
devastate. Disasters like BP in the Gulf are increasingly common. There's 
debates among ecologists whether it's worthwhile to even try to save the 
coral reefs because the money might better to to other ecologically easier 
dealt problems, and because the reefs are going to disappear anyway. This 
is just the recent stuff that comes to mind; I can send you sources if you 
want. And it's not balanced by wonderful fecund ecosystems opening up or 
cornucopias of new species; it's not balanced by anything. Not only are 
tropical rainforests disappearing at record rates, but the southern 
Appalachians are being devastated by mountain-topping; as of five years 
ago, 423 mountains were already topped - and this used to be, behind the 
rain-forests, the second-most ecologically diverse region in the world 
because of the holler system. You can be, anyone can be, optimistic or not 
of course, but the data is uniformly negative, except for extremely small 
victories - for example in the US we point to whooping cranes and the 
Californian condor, but so many other not so magnificent bird species are 
already extinct or going so, here. I should add that my brother's also 
helped me with this stuff; he does satellite and anti-bushmeat stuff in 
Asia (he's a satellite expert) and my nephew was involved in saving the 
last stand of large first-growth cypress in Victoria Island (Carmanah); 
all around the area there's clear-cutting. I remember when I was in 
Tasmania, I met the Greens down there, and they were able to stop the 
damming of the river in the SW (think it was the Franklin?) - to save the 
wilderness; they did it by blowing up the construction equipment. The dam 
was going to be used for hydro which was already plentiful. The action 
worked, but it's a small victory as a lot of Tasmanian flora/fauna are 
still under the gun. I remember the stink of the paper mill in the NW of 
the island, owned by coke, and busy cutting down as much Huon pine as 
could be got hold of. In my area of NE Pennsylvania, the woods are over- 
run by deer, they've no natural enemies since the bears are hunted down, 
the wolves has disappeared, I haven't heard of foxes there for years. I'd 
say more about plants, but other than disappearing hemlock, birch, and 
elm, I really don't know the details, although quaking Aspen in the west 
seem under siege now. With global warming, what insects and disease 
doesn't get, the fires will.

Sorry about this; this is what I think about all the time, what I live 
with, which might be overly dramatic, neurotic, and stupid, but it's 
ongoing. I asked Azure if NYC had anything to do with it, and she said no, 
it's what she learned daily at NYU -"
