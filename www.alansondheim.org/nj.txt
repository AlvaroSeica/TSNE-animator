shining upwards


the face in which epiphany is produced and which appeals to me, mirage
of breath, perhaps I am doing this for you, an epiphany. there is always
epiphany, talk, sleep, breath, 'a state of _phantasmic exaltation_ forms
the typical introduction of the organism from space, all breath and
exaltation.' the midst of the grasping, the organisms, saying, ending in
ellipsis ... and the exaltation of violence which makes a man, a man.
among those macroscopic moments of exaltation are emotions.

but it is this state, that of emotion and exaltation and perfect torture
and annihilation, the exaltation of love, ecriture feminin, that one ...
but the interior may be lifted into exaltation, this state, i have said to 
you, this state of the organism, this epiphany when worlds ...

a temporal detumescence or slackening - an order associated, if you will,
with an end, the resulting detumescence partaking of defuge, exhaustive
ennui, out of exhaustion, out of irritation murmur, grappling with itself,
an 'awkward' tumescence ...

in yourself is a mummy-metaphor, death and detumescence already foregone,
able, unnerved, a state of _frisson,_ semi-tumescence, i want great
portents ... to establish the bulwark ... - the first word, the slight
tumescence of the cloth, of burrowing.
 
swollen tumescences, convexities; meniscus lenses, sinusoidal meanderings:
relationships of to the dry decathecting in the bushido zone, and 
ennui, out of exhaustion and detumescence, out of irritation - and
ennui, out of exhaustion and detumescence, out of irritation murmur ...

and arousal, tumescence, distension, stretched or opened skin: upwelling
and arousal, tumescence, distension, stretched or opened skin: upwelling

detumescence of etiquette in the light of the body
and detumescence of the light

and exaltation and transcendence
and exaltation of the light

Essential software for Windows - for codework/'experimental' work/ etc.



Yesterday we were at the LinuxWorld convention; at the Free Software 
Foundation booth I bought Dan Hagerty, Melissa Weisshaus, and Eli 
Zaretskii, Gnu Software for MS-Windows and MS-DOS. This book, published in 
2001, contains a cdrom developed for MS-Windows up through NT. I asked if 
the software would work on WinXP; the people at the booth didn't know.

Well, it does. It works for Win3.0 up through current. And it's amazing - 
a close-to-full suite of linux commands that works in Windows. This isn't 
linux; it's a port. Commands and programs include emacs, fold, cut, od, 
split, csplit, mv, cp, ls, grep, sed, awk, egrep, gawk, cat, tac, a 
version of vi, gimp, etc. Two shells are also included; I'm using bash in 
Windows! There is enough material here for a full programming and text 
writing/development environment. It's incredible - something I've been 
looking for, for a long time. If you are working with codework, writing 
experimental work, I think these programs are essential.

There are some tricks - if you do install, back-channel me, and I can tell 
you how, for example, to configure bash (which you'll want to do). 

I'm now working on a selection of my work for publication; the following 
was done entirely in the DOS shell.

Some other packages - mutt, shutdown (it works, and weirdly!), chmod,
chown, chgrp, Groff, RCS, man, make, more, less, shell utilities, TEX, 
head, tail, uniq, DJGPP/GCC (compiler) and other programming tools.
(All the flags work too.)

Again - these are unix/linux commands that run in the terminal window of 
windows _without_ changing the operating system or isolating a directory. 
I can type 'shell' (thanks to a shell.bat I set up) anywhere in Windows 
and go immediately to a linux shell emulation. The result of all of this - 
I can work back and forth between my linux desktop and my WinXP OS without 
changing formats, etc.

The book and disk costs $35 - well worth it.

I would rather rule them.

After all, if you really don't think you can make some Alan, most people
are just trying to improve their lives and take, if you ever think of
Alan, this person almost missed out on getting Alan, we got sick and tired
of seeing GOOD PEOPLE fail and lose, Alan. Either way we need to know if
you're in or you're out because these people think FREEDOM the greatest
thing in the world, Alan. I have to agree with you at this point, Alan.,
Alan., Alan. That's O, Alan. K, Alan. I truly wish you the best and hope
you find what it is you're rewarding Alan, Alan. If you are no longer
interested in turning your computer into God, Alan. We hope this makes it
easier to understand, Alan. Now please go to the link just let me know,
Alan. I absolutely LOVE letting you know we placed another person under
you, Alan. like YOU, looking for these people under someone else who is
ready, Alan. you ever feel like giving me a chance to help you create
these or other people, Alan. After all, Alan, they value their freedom but
really would rather be under you, Alan.

looking for something never finding it

i own it but it is gone forever

no one else has my memories

i am waiting for a new way of thinking

thinking will come to me 

in what form in the grey form of thought

in the thought of my world

sometime when i find it i will tell it

i will keep it to myself you will see part

you will never be whole i will be alone

i will keep it i will be selfish

i will bring peace to you from a violent world

it will be my memory

great art

art seriously, obsessed with production and belief and disbelief cutting
work is romantic. granted. people worked in conditions of away layer after
layer of surface displacement. that state drives people. i'll die driven.
seriously, art is obsession. art is cutting, not building, work. great art
is skeletal. great art suffers no compromise, even compromise. art cuts
away layer after layer of surface. all surface is displacement. great art
self-displaces. great art displaces production and belief. disbelief
inheres great art. cutting work is a condition people work in, producing
great art. cutting work is skeletal.

Recent work, poor and otherwise.


Some of my recent work has been terrible. Since "shining upwards," I've 
been off. The following texts are the only ones that are decent. The rest, 
including "v*ral" stars and bones," seem tired. I've removed them. If 
you're tracking my work, please remove them as well. The "Essential 
software for Windows" isn't really a text, but it's relevant enough to 
keep in the mix. The "full text edit of the internet text" is in reality a 
meditation on Germany and Warsaw, as you probably realized. "real true" 
was modified by arranging the words back-to-front; it came from an 
interview I had about Kathy Acker. "great art" is a modification of "real 
true"; I'm not sure about it. "lastempire.mov" took close to a day to 
produce, although the results are simple, but only on the surface. about 
sixteen seconds and silent. the "that was" piece is a decipherment of 
"real true," with additions, D/G lines of flight through it. 

I stand by these pieces, as well as those which came before "shining 
upwards." The rest are dubious and embarrassing.

essay on codework

like every other style, codework will disappear
as soon as it's born, an uncomfortable
miscarriage of the beginning and defensive
tactics of the classic information age. codework
attracts its share of quacks precisely because it
_is_ quackery - and doesn't one ever get tired of
monospacing? but there are more serious
considerations here.:there's no demand for it, no
pleasure in it, it's ult to construct. one would
think that problematic linkages between
programming and literatures would be fruitful,
but the programming is facile, at best
explanatory or obfuscating, and it's already
dated as soon as it's written. you'd have to be
the author to follow it. it's a style that ties
itself into a knot.:there is no transformation,
no knowledge. codework is a fraud. if i could
code, i'd never use the literature fakebook. my
programs are absurd, a few lines at the most. i
can hardly configure a program, much less create
one. codework is last vestige of tradition,
conservative in its subversion of code. it
manages to escape traditional aesthetic
categories in favor of the mess, or knotted
striations. it's dated as soon as it's
written.:the problem with codework:tying oneself
in knots

write first the fake or fraud through my like
every other style, codework will disappear as
soon as it's born, an uncomfortable afterbirth of
the beginning and defensive tactics of the
classic information age. codework attracts its
share of quacks precisely because it _is_
quackery - and doesn't one ever get tired of
monospacing? but there are more serious
considerations here.

Blue Moose performance, Morgantown W. Virginia, Feb. 4, 2004


*/multi-stream audio-video accompaniment/*
tao and nonce nonce tao tao it's dark in here
can you hear me can you hear me
i'm not at all comfortable at the moment 
i'm not sure what 'im going to do but there are
there are errors at work here you can see the errors
for those for those who are 
who are taking offf to baghdad
i've got to keep you here
i've got to give you something to look at
i've got to give you a memory
of weapons of mass destruction if you're going
if you're going there you've got to be prepared
for weapons of mass destruction - without preparation who really knows
what will happen
what will happen to you
you might you might be killed
you'll be on the tv
every american who is killed is onj the tv
every single one
image after image
we all lose people
the iraqis aren't there you don't know do you
how many are killed, there are always
a mess of them, there are always a group of them
or a pile by the side of the road 
after the world trade center 9/11
after that everyone had a story
it was madness
friends were threatening suicide
people couldn't function at all
everyone remembered where they were that day
what they saw
what they brought with them for the rest of their lives
it's like that
and it continues - 
they'd tell you their stories
they'd remember and tell yo and their stories
would go on for a long time, a second expanded
into a narrative that went and went as they tried
to come to grips with what happened to them
they couldn't they never could
and we'd hear the stories and which was the worst and which was even worst
than that and there was nothing we cna do with them. narrative is a way
that the american empire organizes itself and there's very little room
very little room in the vestibue
in the vestibule or GENKAN
for understand what might be the other or the OTHER
that appears from behind the tree and fires
or behind the house and fires away
and then collapses
there's no memory aftger that
there's 
i'm losing my trace here my track here
i want to talk about something else
there's trash by the side of the road
there's trash there by the side of the road
it's floating away and i'm losing you
you're wondering where this is going
or how much of this you might have to endure
i'm fragile and i can hear voices behind me
they're talking away losing interst
this isn't the most important thing in their lives
this isn't in their lives at all
things will collapse and whole worlds will turn to nanotechnological dust
and there will only be
a fleeting glimpse
a fleeting glimpse
of frozen tracks of a bear or a deer
that's all that will remain and nothing else
there's a fury in that, a FURY!
that nothing else will remain, just those tracks -
and the heaps of bodies by the sides of the world
by the sides of the road 
by the sides of the word
sometimes the technology fails
for example
the flash file didn't work through the projector
this happens and then there's a blank and a sound
and nothing else
you might be wondering where this is going at this point - seeing that so
many things are collapsing - even the sound seems a bit troublesome -
what's happening, why is it stopping and starting like this.
i feel people are staring at my back
TURN AWAY! LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE! can't you see - they can't see - I'm
typing in the dark - there's almost nothing visible....
so I'll try something else, we'll see what the projector does... that's
better - but there goes the image! we'll try again....
the world dissolves in god in plasma - 
and this is a short film called 'murmur' 
and it's the turning of the world on itself
and the turning and wait - there's got to be more
there's always the movie of the end of empire
or the last empire, i forget the title - you know the one - the no video
NO VIDEO one -
you can see - what else can I show you here? 
on the left - the end of Empire
on the right - Europe 1915 just befrore the war
you know which war
these are some Europeans
they're down by the beach - they're down there - there's waiting for 
something - 
in silence they're waiting for something
where are their families their children
what ever
whatever happened to...
how much of this can go on -
I'm feeling my age here - I notice there's a blank screen just below the
piano one whatever went on it? where's it going? why did the ocean image
stop? why is the NO VIDEO still going on? Why does it say no video really
NO VIDEA? is this - not really - I was going to say - wait, I'll find out!
that's it - ok, more entertainment - well, that's a drag - just a blank
screen and then it jumped... ah well, hold on a minuite - this is getting
entirely out of control - you almost forgot just for a moment - the war -
what this started off with - remember the empire and everything else
associated with it?something is opening - something closing - there's too
many things happening here - look - I'm riding the machine maybe shutting
down? - no it's continuing - hee hee - just hold on - something will make
sense in a bi t- oh my god entertainment for the masses - now you're
really going to forget things - this is a cheap short - cheap shot = I
better retire for this - how many were killed today - I can't remember a
thing - things seem to be moving way out of control - I just can't
remember anything at this point - where are we - so far the usa has lost
around 500 soldiers -
this is what i wanted to talk about - i can't remember how many were lost
- on that other side - with the world trade center - i remember - it was
around 2700 - but it was first supposed to be - reported as - 5400 - then
it went down - they were americans - some afghani died a while later -
some of the - some of the iraqi too - or iraqis - or iraki or irakis -
some of them - 
i don't know - this is more or less of a collapse - who would want to
watch this over and over anyway - there's a nova - I'll show that - a real
fast nova - it won't get away -
there's that thing - there's that nova -
there's that thing - 
there's that nova -
thank you

a heap because the body falls and in so doing
limbs keep moving, twitching
the body is invisible topography
only the topology remains
it shudders and goes to infinity
her arm shot out at a tangent
her neck collapsed her leg parted from the body
of the torso it retained its form momentarily

it all disappeared
inversion of dance technology, computer choreography:
let the machine do something
the topological organism becomes a warning beacon
the future of the body is radiation

A few notes on codework for an upcoming 
talk -


A difficulty I have with codework discussions - codework is usually taken
as pseudo-code or broken or dysfunctional code somehow pasted onto or into
a work - as if that would give the work credence, legitimize the text as
literature etc. But nothing is farther from the truth. (Mez for example
isn't broken code but displacement/insertion techniques - shifters,
slippages, of language that are semantically marked.)

In general -

please note it is not the code that is broken - but the interiorities of
more or less traditional semantic worlds - sememes as well (in other
words, distortions of world-making).

what is code in the first place ? - obviously it can either be a PROGRAM
which PRODUCES a residue - or it can be a CARRIER of meaning. this depends
on the semiotic encodings as well as the PERFORMATIVITIES at work. a code
may or may perform - in the sense that it may or may not create a result
that one might characterize ontologically and/or epistemologically as AN
OTHER.

again - think of code - in the sense of morse code - as a _mapping_
between two or more strata. think of code - in the sense of programming -
as a _performative_ between one stratum (that of base more or less
sequentially accessed) and another (that of residue or results which may
or may not appear dynamic or interactive). (see Eco, Theory of Semiotics.)

the POLITICAL economy of a text, performative, or performance in relation
to the OTHER that appears.

CODE / PSEUDO-CODE ETC. IN CODEWORK

0 Texts which problematize the relationships among language, subjectivity, 
symbol, meaning, body, organism - texts which take nothing for granted.

1 Texts which are literally performative.

2 Texts which are program output. Here we might distinguish between texts
which are sutured in relation to the _standard text_ - and texts whose
content and form clearly reflects both programming and program
_interference._

3 Texts which in part present the programs or controls that have created
the remainder - for example a text which might include k:1 banner as part
of the content - an ascii banner.

4 Texts which are clearly modified in their entirety - for example vowel
substitutions, formations using awk, grep, sed, tr, etc.

5 Texts which present a _history_ or series of operations - texts which
appear to require reconstitution or recuperation - these may or may not be
accompanied by their _history of transformations._

6 Likewise texts which are incapable of such reconstitution or
recuperation.

7 Texts with content 'picked up' and placed against other content (for
example spam text interspersed with other text) in order to expand or
render a sememe problematic.

8 Texts which rely on and relay through distributivities such as SMS,
email lists, IRC, etc., as a means of dispersion, engagement,
intervention, political or other action, etc. And texts which report back
on these texts.

9 Texts working from MOOs, MOO language, MUDs, and so forth - texts
generated in chatrooms with one, some, or all characters under the control
of the 'author' or 'author-collaborators.'

10 Texts which are reportage from commands, such as traceroute or dig or
@lastlog or Kismet output - texts which examine the network and its
tethering.

11 Traditional texts, traditionally-written texts which report on other
texts, other codeworks, which mimic codeworks, and so forth.

12 Not to mention all those aleatoric texts, stochastic or chaotic texts
or imagery, multi-media codeworks, generative works, generative works fed
into themselves (resonance-work), specialized editors which refuse the
WYSIWYG...

Note on "Codework"


I think I came up with the name (which surely had been used before) in a
conversation with Ken Wark - we were talking about code - the term at that
point, as far as I remember, was code-poetry - and I borrowed the notion
of 'work' - i.e. labor, production - I think - from Heiner Muller -
running the two words together - as in Hamletmachine - so there was a 
political component as well - not wanting the limitation of poetry, 
however defined, or poetics for that matter - opening the framework, not 
closing it - I'd also felt that code-poetry - however spelled - was too 
close to concrete poetry - which didn't interest me at all - at least not 
any longer - not even dom sylvester huedard - maybe huedard actually - but 
not the usual suspects - anyway - I thought that codepoetry would minimize 
the design aspect - emphasize the symbolic or asymbolic or presymbolic - 
for that matter the (Kristevan) choratic of language - so the political 
and psychoanalytical met on the grounds of mathesis and semiosis - all 
this into the naming of the word - pretty commonplace now - at least this 
is what was going through my mind at that point - still is - anyway - 


_


Codework impossibility of self-reference and decipherment.


a. "There are seven words in this sentence." Which word is the number?
b. "This is a sentence." But how would one know?
c. "This is written in English." But how would one know?
etc.

- Self-referentiality possesses a residue; only in mathematics or logic is 
it 'pure' - the whole relating to the whole.

The residue is in relation to an attribute. But then

d. "This refers in its entirety to itself." Are we at the juncture of 
paradox?
etc.

Using Peirce's distinctions, I'd argue that every painting is first and
foremost ikonic and perceived as such - the paint is never transparent. To
the extent that codework requires interpretation, examination, it is
ikonic as well - one might say that, even in the space of virtuality, it
possesses a materialist foundation. The more 'impenetrable' the greater
the degree of ikonicity, the greater the appearance of _material._ This
appearance is just that, however, appearance, as a change - for example
from monospace to justifiable type - will demonstrate.

One must consider, of course, the semantic residue of the ikonic - and the 
interstitial / liminal between the meaning-sememe and the ikonic provides 
the _content_ of the work; in fact, the meaning-sememe and ikonic-sememe 
are interwoven, inseparable, and contributory, a somewhat similar 
situation to the calligraphic.

_Meaning_ itself is both attribute (i.e. 'meaning of _cheval_ in French') 
and calligraphic; totality is reserved for the Absolute which is always 
problematic ('meaning of Life,' 'meaning of Everything') and ideologically 
suspect. To the extent that meaning embraces an Absolute, meaning depends 
on decoding (Bible, Koran, Kwak!); here is the locus of political Power in 
the Foucauldian sense.

Codework simultaneously embraces and problematizes meaning; one might
argue that codework is _fallen work,_ fallen by the wayside, as well as
the disturbance of the Gnostic Mary Magdalen.

Every more or less traditional text is codework with invisible residue; 
every computer harbors the machinic, the ideology of capital in the 
construction of its components, the oppression of underdevelopment in its 
reliance on cheap labor.

Every text is Derridian/Foucauldian differance; codework is exemplary of 
the process of deferral and _rewrite._ Codework, like _wryting,_ is an 
embodiment within virtual ontologies; wryting disturbs _towards_ the body, 
desire, language - that language of codework, ruptured by codework.

Inner speech as well is self-referential, a decoding of every text spoken 
within it, before the reader, or among the readers. And nothing fulfills 
_utterly,_ every Absolute itself is codework, a deferral - hence the 
psychoanalytical nature of _defuge_ - that decay which comes about through 
the overuse of pornography or the attempt to begin again and again, a 
novel left off in the middle. Therefore consumption, the ravenous, is at 
the heart of _things_ to the extent there is any _meaning_ at all.

"There's a saint in the sky" ("John Murphy")


There's a saint in the sky called Valentine
He's in my heart and is in thine
Look to the heaven's and see the stars
Outshine the sun whose light is from afar

Come to our hearts and sing so pure
That God will come divine
And bless us so that we are sure
That I am yours and you are mine

I have seen far too many dead
And dream of graves with vines entwined
I await my lover in her stead
And I will die and she will sigh

Death is useless and we are hear
Our children are our present pain
Kill them all and we will not fear
And live and never die again

You and I will live forever
Our hears two roses deep entwined
Nothing ever shall us sever
Though are faces be long lined

John Murphy he comes walking
Long in step and over hill
Dont listen to him while he's stalking
Other's lovers he will go to hell

John Murphy he lies dying
On a lone and forlorn grave
All his children there are crying
Oh my love you must be brave

John Murphy he has gone
To that fastness in the sky
And his daughters and his sons
Will pray for him in the bye and bye

There's a saint called Valentine
And I am yours and you are mine
Leave the mines and never fear
We will live another year
We will live another year
