"We have already learnt to see in mysticism a principal characteristic
of degeneration. It follows so generally in the train of the latter,
that there is scarcely a case of degeneration in which it does not ap-
pear. To cite authorities for this is about as unnecessary as to ad-
duce proof for the fact that in typhus a rise in the temperature of
the body is invariably observed. I will therefore only repeat one
remark of Legrain's: 'Mystical thoughts are to be laid to the account
of the insanity of the degenerate. There are two states in which they
are observed - in epilepsy and in hysterical delirium.' When Federoff,
who makes mention of religious delirium and ecstasy as among the ac-
companying features of an attack of hysteria, puts them down as a pec-
ularity of women, he commits an error, since they are at least as com-
mon in male hysterical and degenerate subjects as in female."

This is from Max Nordau, Degeneration, 1895, and I have decided to
write on this subject.

It does not seem to me that this is true. I think there can be mystics
who are not degenerates although I have not met many mystics and some
of the ones I have met are very strange, even weird, so maybe there is
some truth to it. But how can one say that if one devotes one's life
to one's true God that one is a degenerate? Perhaps I misunderstand
the meaning of the author's words. I do not understand degenerate al-
though in the book he relates it to hysteria and relates hysteria to
fatigue because people are tired in these modern times. He gives lots
of proof to this so I have to take it on his word, which seems good
enough because he backs it up with a lot of interesting statistics.

I don't know why epilepsy is a cause of mysticism or leads to degener-
ation but it is true that it is a horrible disease although I under-
stand that they have it under control now, but maybe I don't really
have the facts here, and Max Nordau gives no statistics but just
quotes this other person. But I do know that hysterical delirium can
lead to mysticism because I often have hysterical delirium and believe
me it is not pleasant. But then I do see God and everything can be all
right again, but I am not sure. (I am, but I will have to write on
that some other time!)

Where does Max Nordau get his facts from about degeneration and mysti-
cism? I don't think he has all the facts but he does have the facts
about hysteria and fatigue and the modern age, but these are different
facts and everyone knows you can't take one set of things and just ap-
ply them willy-nilly to another, so I guess something is missing here
and that is partly why I believe that Max Nordau is wrong.

Here is what Max Nordau says about degenerates: "We will briefly men-
ton some peculiarities frequently manifested by a degenerate. He is
tormented by doubts, [ha! mysticism! (me)] seeks for the basis of all
phenomena, especially those whose first causes are completely inacces-
sible to us, and is unhappy when his inquiries and ruminations lead,
as is natural, [oh! why!??! why?!!?] to no result. He is ever supply-
ing new recruits to the army of system-inventing metaphysicians, pro-
found expositors of the universe, seekers for the philosopher's stone,
[I know the feeling!!] the squaring of the circle and perpetual mo-
tion."

And then just above this (I just noticed this!) he says: "With the
incapacity for action there is connected the predilection for inane
reverie. The degenerate is not in a condition to fix his attention
long, or indeed at all, on any subject, and is equally incapable of
correctly grasping, ordering, or elaborating into ideas and judgments
the impressions of the external world conveyed to his distracted
consciousness by his defectively operating senses. It is easier and
more convenient for him to allow his brain-centres [sic!!] to produce
semi-lucid, nebulously blurred ideas and inchoate embryonic thoughts,
and to surrender himself to the perpetual obfuscation of a boundless,
aimless, and shoreless stream of fugitive ideas; and he rarely rouses
himself to the painful attempt to check or counteract the capricious,
and, as a rule, purely mechanical associations of ideas and succession
of images and bring under discipline the disorderly tumult of his
fluid presentations."

This is the main part of my argument, that the degenerate can never be
a mystic because he (or she!) can't concentrate on anything long
enough for meditation, and without meditation, there would be no way
to see the true godhead of our lord or lords or these things that mys-
tics see when they go into trances, as all of them do. They go into
trances and they stay there for a long time, and that is not what the
degenerate can do, according to Max Nordau's own words! So if the de-
generate can't do this, he (or she!) can have a glimpse I think of a
mystical truth or the truth of the world of all things, including what
are called "phenomena," but he can't go beyond the world into the true
mystical one because he doesn't have the attention space you would
need to do this kind of thing which is at the heart of mysticism, so
what happens is that the degenerate is not a mystic, even though
Nordau says he is, and then gives a whole long chapter of examples
which range from Wagner to the Pre-Raphaelites and to Tolstoi. Now it
is true that all of these people are degenerates, I know that for a
fact (it is so obvious), but it is not because these people are mys-
tics, not even Tolstoi (who was a true mystic, I believe), but for
other things, like with the Pre-Raphaelites, they were exchanging
lovers all the time, and a lot of the women were very unhappy I read.
So it couldn't be that, the mysticism, but it was because of other
things which made them degenerate like these things about true lovers,
which they never found. (They never found what the causes were that
made them degenerate, not that they didn't find their lovers, who were
always there.)

To conclude my paper, here is a final quote from Max Nordau: "In one
part or another of his mental field of vision each of us therefore is
a mystic. [Ha!] From all the phenomena which he himself has not ob-
served, everyone forms shadowy, unstable presentations. Nevertheless
it is easy to distinguish healthy men from those who deserve the des-
ignation of mystic. There is a sure sign for each. The healthy man is
in a condition to obtain sharply-defined presentations from his own
immediate perceptions, and to comprehend their real connection. The
mystic, on the contrary, mixes his ambiguous, cloudy, half-formed lim-
inal representations with his immediate perceptions which are thereby
distrurbed and obscured." You can see that perhaps Max Nordau has
backed down, but I don't think so. He finds the Pre-Raphaelites degen-
erate because they are mystics, as I have shown, and then he writes
about others, but you get the idea.

Conclusion, Max Nordau is wrong about degenerates being mystics be-
cause degenerates can't focus on things and mystics can. But there are
other ways that mystics can be degenerates of course (I have said they
are weird, at least the ones I have met), so the "jury is still out"!

How The Doing Is


I have no sense of time at all. I quote a cause for the effect, effect
for the cause. I will have A influence its predecessor B, who has yet
to be born on this earth.

I will connect C and D who have never met, have nothing in common,
speak different languages, and eat different foods.

I will rub a theory in its contradiction until both are polished.

Until both are demolished. I will create contradictions for a theory
which are a theory. I will create a theory of contradictions and
contradict such a theory.

I will reverse time and invert space. I will disassociate space from
itself, emphasize its discontinuities, only to suture its continuities
and dissolve both.

Time will not be gainsaid. I will quote one and then another theory
which contradict each other. I will adopt the tenets of both. I will
take one theory as an authority for the reader and take another theory
as an authority for the writer and then reverse the two and their
consequences.

I will start from the end and finish at the beginning, or I will
finish at the beginning and then start at the end. I will do both or
neither, one or the other in each and every order, as more times and
spaces and theories and readers and writers accumulate.

I will insist I am the author of the writer, and I will insist that I
write the author.

I do not care for contradiction in any way or any case. I do care for
contradiction, in every way or no case whatsoever.

I have every sense of time, every sense of space. I quote one cause
for another, one effect for another. I make chains of effects and
causes, the latter following the former, the former following the
latter. It makes no difference.

I will or will not connect E and F.


________________________________________________________________________

But if I could tell you whether C or D do or do not connect or if I could
tell you whether I connect C and D or do not connect C and D I could give
you an image. 

If I could give you an image I could give you a symbol which would be the
symbol of that image or its signifier. If I could give you several images
and several symbols I could connect one to another or not connect one to
another but if I could connect one to another I could give you a picture. 

If I could give you several pictures I could connect one to another or not
connect one to another. If I could connect one to another I could give you
a belief. 

If I could give you a belief it would be a picture of my belief or it
would not be a picture of my belief but it would be connected. If it
would be connected I would be connected or I would not be connected but if
I were connected I could give you a theory and I would give you a theory.
If I gave you a theory you would give me money and you would give me you
or you would not give me you. If you would give me you I would tell you if
B and C connect or if B and C do not connect.

You would know you.

Passing the Ball Along, I mean Semiotics and Differance


"A Man of Words

"A man of words and not of deeds,
Is like a garden full of weeds;
And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of snow;
And when the snow begins to fall,
It's like a bird upon the wall;
And when the bird away does fly,
It's like an eagle in the sky;
And when the sky begins to roar,
It's like a lion at the door;
And when the door begins to crack,
It's like a stick across your back;
And when your back begins to smart,
It's like a penknife in your heart;
And when your heart begins bleed,
You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed."

(Anonymous poem from The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse,
selected by J. M. Cohen, 1952.)

They were _passing the ball along_ from one to another, the happy
runners running across the field with smiles on their face. They
called the movement _the lateral_ or possibly _the deference of the
image_ because it was precisely that, among these schoolboys passing
from one another, passing for one another. But what was being passed
but the imaginary, and in what realm was the oval playing-field? I
think this might have been the realm of dreams or the realm of these
space wherein we type forward to one another, waiting, languorously,
for the perfect return.

I remember happy voices passing back and forth among us. I remember
talking going well into the night, from later afternoon until darkness
befalls the world. I remember these beautiful pictures and the manner
in which they live within us, small children always in awe, always in
awe.

And I remember, too, the sense of wonder with the beginning of the
first word, the first phrase, the first sentence. When it was always
dawn. When it was always spring.

The Subject without a Mirror


I see my reflection, uncanny and ghostlike, reflected in the window

on the train from Sydney to Camberra, this becomes a text of trans-
port, say fifteen meters between one word and another, that is a
_lengthening_ of affect across the surface of the screen, if one can
believe in such discontinuities. Reading a slowdown of the vehicle for
example results in a _decrease_ of the distance, which now, as we pull
into Campbelltown, approaches a one-to-one mapping, within a magnitude
or so, of the size of _your_ screen, the merely-human, so to speak,
collapsed upon the semi-rural townships visible here just before and
after arrival at this intermediary point.

Half the time I want to look out the window, half the time type and

time is another factor, the concrete lag between the writing and send-
ing of this message, which depends on a concrete connection between
machine and wire, perhaps not for minutes, hours, days. And time is
another factor, as this broad day slips by, the train speeds again,
and the _increase_ results in a pulling of the landscape past the win-
down at a higher and higher rate of speed.

In a manner similar to that of foundering theory, subjectivity tends
towards a rather problematic expansion and desperate search

so that the mapping becomes something which, later we will find, ap-
proaches the _planetary,_ this small _occasion_ of the universe;
there's not even bush present and accounted for _just yet,_ but I can
imagine the vastness of space, the weakness of our connection, in
spite of our embeddedness, to the cosmos as an ungraspable w/hole.

Help help we're lost in the Cosmos I say to the 89-year-old man sit-
ting next to me as we leave Campbelltown, and he replies

"Thus 'is there a subject without a mirror,' a question that appears
in a related form in the marginal notes written in my second-hand copy
of Elizabeth Grosz' Volatile Bodies, might be answered in this fashion
by an enormous exhalation that one could (if so inclined) liken to a
system of resonances produced _precisely_ through protocols and hyper-
links across the Internet."

"Now

we're "a good third of the way there" I reply, the sky beginning to
cloud over this landscape of rolling hills, occasional industry,
fields giving way to bush, bush to fields, some cows feeding at a wat-
er trough, telegraph wires and four trees in a line.

The Stillness of Frozen Flesh


There on ThePalace or WorldsChat there is the silent, immobilized ava-
tar, the image which refuses speech, perhaps whispering or paging else-
where, the avatar who _sits_ in the midst of others conversing, the
silent listener at the party. I imagine a future in which he or she,
naked, turns slightly, imperceptibly, at the mention of a name, twitch
of an eye - a pornography based on the _revelation of planes._

View [x] -> View [x+1] & in the Midst of Silence, this thin Layer as
_Supplement_ in Replacement of that Second in the Turn of _Diminution._

Such is a _Glance_ at the Sound of a Word to which the Machine Accedes
to the Lineaments of _inexact Desire._

Such is the Lurker, always already Visible, given the Intravenous of a
Body under Siege or Examination. And I am _distraught_ in the midst of
my Desire as well, aroused to an Hysteric Degree, simply by the Sight
or Site of that Sliver, that Inscription of what is Already Heard.

No Idea Who He Was


On this unending train, I do not leave either trace or trail, progres-
sing across the Australian landscape. This is the silent visitation of
the strange, something needing theorization, as it is characteristic
of modern life. Forget Kristeva's romanticism, Simmel here - I'm talk-
ing about the deep, almost random, loss of memory built into the land,
into the recordings of journeys taken every minute. I'm talking about
complete and utter _disappearance._

For example, that bicyclist I have seen in the distance, recognition
of the pure and complete body that drives the framework - but at _such_
a distance, the face unrecognizable, nothing more to be seen or said.

These moments of _mind and organism_ constantly passed, unsurpassed.

Whose legs are those just so visible behind the automobile parked by
the curb in front of the milk bar at the end of the road?* Just as the
face _might_ appear, there is always some obstacle - the speed of the
train, an inappropriate intervention on the part of a large truck,
effacing the face in a fashion one might take as absolute.

Whose legs are those do not recognize a question mark.

dreaming of white gauze again, lips tied into place,
severed from the body, appearing to emerge, there's always
the first word, slight tumescence of the cloth,
a definition of smothered language, body arched upwards,
hollow beneath the back (where the back would be),
it's an outline of white gauze, it's always damp, as if
excretions were somehow caught up in all of this,
head bending backwards speaking upside-down, all sounds

IN LUCIAM

Hanc cum, Lucia, mentulatiorem
Qui nasatior est inepta credas,
Rivali puto me carere summo,
Quod nondum tibi visus est Philemon.

AGAINST LUCIA

As you take the silly view,
that the bigger the nose the bigger the prick,
my main rival isn't on the scene, Lucia,
since you've never seen Philemon.

#26 in Janus Pannonius, Epigrammata, edited and translated by Anthony A. 
Barrett and Corvina Kiado; Pannonius wrote in mid-fifteenth-century Hung-
ary. 

Luckily my glasses 
hide my enormous nose
which turns slightly at an angle
as a result of a beating in Providence.

I don't know you, Lucia,
but I imagine you shriveled,
hardly of any use to either of us,
besides I may be lying.

(About my enormous nose.)

In a space like this, who can tell
the size of his nose,
the size of his prick,
which might as well align
itself with your monitor,
or the number of keys
as you lean towards the screen.

you might fall into the glass,
you might fall out of it.
Lucia, Lucia,
I just fell out of you!

The Segment


I have been running on the Net and co-moderating on the Net and
advising on the Net for close to four and a half years now, and I have
been think- ing about how my life turns segmentary, becoming-segmented,
vis-a-vis the cycles of the Net, as if there were a daily breathing, a
checking-in and a checking-out, no matter what, and I have noticed that
I have been off or out of touch for perhaps no more than three or four
days at the maximum over this period during which I traveled to Perth,
Sydney, Canberra, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Fukuoka,
Cleveland, Huntington Beach, Wilkes-Barre, and a host of other
forgotten places, and I have used perhaps 30 ISPs thanks to the
generosity of guests during this period, so that an order is set, that
of the _addict,_ whether or not there is "Net Addiction" because in
praxis I must log on log off to handle the volume of messages incoming,
as well as work through requests and texts and counter- requests, so
it's apparent that s I know when you write, I have an idea when you

an answer, an answer, an answer...  w So that it's waiting, from Japan,
for America to come on-line, waiting further or not for the "problem of

down, but there _I_ am on-line with the rest of you / them, knowing our

issue of the _segment,_ the point or vector or node or cycle I'm
referencing here, the _segment_ which is the intervening or
intervention of the Net into a routing, becoming-routine, so that one
might imagine in fact that I see my body within the imaginary,
segmented itself - n And then there are all these other issues of
political economy, responsib- ility, in relation to the segment, and
the phenomenology of the segment, time in-between, liminal, time
on-line, entering and exiting the computer ... g So that what might
seem like addiction on one hand might be a prone series of actions on
the other (as if) there is no tomorrow... s Now here in Singapore, I
run out of money, the exhange-rate is odd and senseless, I have done my
duties, I am complete, this text among others, one segment for another,
these exchanges...

This is the truth of it as I have known in my heart.

On and Off the Net: The Segment


I am _yoked_ to the computer; I "check into" the Net usually three or
more times a day - once, at the very least. It (this activity, behavior,
obsession) appears as an addiction - being _on_ is often at the back of
my mind - the time of login decided well in advance. (I think myself
through this. I am _intended_ within a given phenomenological project,
teleology.) If I am traveling, I need to consider where I am going, what
sort of current is available, what sort of phone connections. Do I log
on long-distance to my own provider, through the provider of a friend,
through a university connection or a cyber-cafe? What sort of protocols
are needed? Do I work through a shell-account and my own communications
program on my laptop? Do I work through an IP account, using manual
dialup on my trumpet winsock software? Do I use another computer alto-
gether, with its own programs - for example Ewan or telnet through Net-
scape or at the Win 95 DOS prompt? Will the DNS lookup match? (What
about Macs?)

Some of these questions I can answer in advance; some require configur-
ing. Even at home I worry the issue - but only in terms of time - I'll
log in tonight to see if X has responded, if Y wants to continue the
conversation.

There are times I will catch Z on-line, move over to ytalk or a MOO or
talker; if I'm on my desktop machine, I may use Linux and my local
talkers or ytalk. I can invite Z into my machine, into the heart of it.
I can go with Z to another site altogether, chat there. I can chat with
Z on IRC from Mirc in Windows or Phoenix otherwise. Z and I can war
program together, if he or she has the time.

"Into the heart of it": I see you enter my machine, the modem lights
wildly flickering. You and I together, circulations occurring locally,
the computer re-presenting the body. I am segmented across the Net,
within my machine as well. We are _electronic._

So there are times to consider, people coming on- and off-line as the
local day and night progress. I am segmented, in other words, by the
other to the extent I want to engage her or him directly, want to col-
lapse lag to the minimum. Lag increases as well with distance; the far-
ther I am from him or her, the less likely I am to work with synchron-
ous applications, since the delay becomes frustrating. Local and delib-
erate delay can be seductive; arbitrary delay can lead to high levels of
anxiety and an inability to _speak_ (I have written of this elsewhere.)

_I have written of this elsewhere._

(Beyond lag, one might consider Net time as somewhat absolute, just as
an email header carries fairly exact information about departure and
arrival. _Where_ the nodes are can be more difficult to ascertain; even
if the city or university is known, the _exact_ location usually isn't.
In real life, the situation is somewhat reversed; I generally know
_where_ I am to a fair degree of accuracy [and what attitude my body is
in - what configuration], but, unless I am "watching the time," the
_when_ of my daily activities is blurred - as is the concept of the
present itself.)

Segmenting compartmentalizes my life as well; I am aware of two worlds,
two callings, each of which interpenetrates the other. At times I think
of these worlds as differing epistemologically, but more and more I find
that there is an ontological component as well; I am _different_ and
_differently composed_ off-line than on-. The absenting of the body is
different, the role of the imaginary and its idealities is differently
constructed. On the Net I am always already aware of being constituted
in such a manner that I am deeply framed - I can change myself (although
almost always I choose not to). This is a frame which, in dialectical
interaction with the protocols, softwares, hardwares, and applications,
is mobile, given simultaneously from within and without, but with the
emphasis on the former (I can delete her, I can invite him in, I can
change me). The off-line frame begins with the given, of which I am a
recipient; gender-change is far more difficult, mobility is limited by
the fact that _the body, to get from A to B, must traverse all the in-
termediary positions between them._

I have written of this elsewhere, within the segmented divisions of the
Internet Text.

Having written extensively of these differences, I need only note the
tensions among them as one moves on and off line, tensions which are
part of what Kristeva might consider the borderline personality of our
time. It is in the interstices that fantasms, neuroses, hysterias oc-
cur - those intermittent or diffused areas, those uncontrollable and
dispersing regimes - dreams, for example, in which scrolling text plays
a role, or on-line behavior conditioned by an uncanny feeling that she
or he is _in the room now_ with me, just around the corner, above,
below, to one or another side.

Segmenting is always already composed of the interstitial, liminal; it
is not a cyclical series (it never returns to the same), but one that
continues roughly, indefinitely. It is a _stuttered_ series, hardly
spoken, hardly capable of speech and phenomena. There are rites of log-
ging on, logging-on. There are moments when the rites are forgotten, in
the midst of writing a text or walking a mountain. But they are always
part of the horizon, as I have said, always present, always constructing
a degree of separation among realms - just as a code word (safe word)
might operate within the theater of sado-masochism.

The rites ensure that _neither one world nor the other is stable,_ that
there is no conceivable stability among them. The rites ensure that one,
two, worlds lend themselves to one, two, three, many worlds, just as
gender reversal leads to one, two, many genders. What opens up on and
off the Net is a _dispersion or splay of subjectivities,_ imminent and
immanent destabilizations which are, at best, temporarily existing with-
in the potential wells defined by the rites. Each exists as a slide into
another - and one might make a case that it is the on-line world that
eventually succeeds as the body succumbs to illness, accident, death.
(It is to be noted, as well, that the _logics_ employed here, themselves
splayed across the "real" and the "virtual," are non-distributive, quan-
tum in nature, that the dispersions are stochastic, uncontrollable, and
inductive. Such I believe is the nature of organism itself, especially
in its interaction with structures, protocols, or frameworks.)

But in the meantime, during the segment of existing life or existing
conscious life (within or without the screen), there is of course the
element of _addiction,_ guaranteed by this repetitive behavior in
relation to _such and such a node or vector,_ that is, what is called
"cyberspace," this accumulation of computer-mediated-practices. The
longer off-line, the greater the anxiety, as mail builds up and the
account threatens to stall. The longer off-line, the greater the feeling
that some _essential_ communication is present and waiting - and that
this communication _might not wait forever._ The speed of the Net
creates the appearance of urgency, immediacy - X has written _here and
now_ and "for that matter" X might still be on-line. There is a real
fear of rejection, abandonment, at work; there is the dull or mute
pleasure of seduction occasioned by lag, by waiting for a letter from
him or her. All serve to pull me in further; the real-life phonecall can
wait (I can always call him back later), but the on-line email trembles
(she won't wait forever) (he won't wait another minute) (she's gone, I'm
abandoned).

Addiction (whether or not the phenomenon is such remains moot) builds
resentment on one hand, an almost active resistance to segmenting (what
if I just cancel my ISP account? what if I never go on-line again? what
if I allow everything to crash?) - a desire to bring the house down -
and, on the other hand, a sense of exhaustion, waste, and detumescence/
decathecting which I have elsewhere termed "defuge." But defuge dis-
places, not cancels, segmenting - which continues on an almost autonomic
level - I _find myself_ logging in, reading and writing, _participat-
ing._ (As with bad faith or the inauthentic, as if it didn't matter, as
if it were _as if._) And resentment can lead either to individuals more
or less permanently leaving the Net (or using it only for occasional
business mail, keeping in touch with the family, etc.) or to nothing
more than sublimation in real life (I take a walk around the block, I
read a...computer...magazine, I entice myself, I seduce myself, desire
once again the presence of the uncanny), until tension takes other path-
ways, at a level capable of being absorbed by the Net.

What of the future, I would say, asking myself on-line as well as off?
In the future, everything will be seamless; the difference or rite of
passage might be nothing more than that set in a cron script (automat-
ically turning from one to another at a particular time of day), or that
established by the presence of an (un)safe word, or simply whatever is
construed by the interpenetration of virtual and real, machine and org-
anism, time and space. In other words, segmenting might be more of a
shudder or flutter, depending, or nothing more than a slight change of
atmosphere, a slightly different breathing. At that point, what passes
for the self might once again be granted the privilege of the (w)hole,
an addiction that could be considered paramount to an _addiction to
life._ In the meantime, I am caught, taut or tethered, among times,
spaces, ontologies, with their attendant psychoses - about which, "I
have written elsewhere."

and text were a clean and proper division - to the extent that the Net is
an _appliance_ model, as opposed to a hacked and interpenetrated one - oh

Is _t_ <X>?


Is theory necessary? Hardly; the best one can hope for is a problematic
structuralism bringing subtexts to the surface through formal analysis;
the subtexts construe a politics and economy all there own.

Is theory true? Hardly; as soon was one leaves the formal conventional-
ism of mathematics, descriptive phenomenologies are the best one can
hope for, and these always possess a literary or metaphoric quality.

Is theory originary? Hardly; the world and semiosis appear first and
foremost; we are thrown into the midst of the symbolic and its ruptures,
among which theory appears almost as a residue or afterthought.

Is theory final? Hardly; everything is always already dated and the best
one can hope for is that one or another position behaves as an impedi-
ment to acceptable opinions.

Is theory elitist? Hardly; it is only that it becomes a pale reflection
of the complexity of the world; the best that one can hope for is a
slight transparency in relation to the given, a caress of things.

Is theory populist? Hardly; it is true that everyone has a theory, that
theory prefigures the world, before world and semiosis; the best one can
hope for is that this is forgotten, that critique is engendered and met.

Is theory unnecessary? Hardly; it is too easy to forget the interconnec-
tedness of things, and the best one can hope for is a shadow or uncanny
effect, pressuring sea-changes, atmospherics, within the world at large.

Is theory dry? Hardly; while there is dry theory, there is always shadow
or uncanny affect, and the best one can hope for is a burning obsession,
intensity, in each of us greeting the day with manuscript in hand.

Is theory lurid? Hardly; while there is lurid theory, the best one can
hope for is the irruption of desire from within the text of the book,
textlessness of the world, each of us yearning for a final truth.

The Virtual Me and the Virtual You: Issues of Interpenetration


The Virtual Me (VM) lives and breathes. The Virtual You (VY) may or may
not. The VM trembles with fright, or eagerly with joy and anticipation.
The VY appears to have no such behavior. The VM expresses itself to the
VY through the movement of fingers, or a slowly turning body before a
camera ... in the shape of a sphere. The VY is something I read, or
the representation of a body on a sector of the screen. The VM dreams
and reads the VY through inner speech. The VY is always already a text
in one or another form.

I assume the VY trembles with fright or eagerly with joy and anticipa-
tion, expresses itself through the movement of fingers or a slowly turn-
ing body before a camera, dreams, and reads the VM through inner speech.
I assume that for the VY the VM is always already a text in one or an-
other form.

I assume these things because it is easiest to assume these things, and
because the symptoms of VY appear to parallel my own symptoms, as they
are expressed within the symbolic. This is of course the problem of the
Other, who may form me, just as the VY through lag may form the VM, that
is, may seduce the VM, may control the VM, who will give itself up to
the text. (Or just as the VM may form the VY, may seduce the VY, may
control the VY, and none of this _necessarily_ through lag, but through
lag and a variety of other means, or through such a variety, ignoring
lag.) To give up to the text is to give in to the text, to _follow_ the
text and its prescriptions. The prescriptions of the text of the VY are
injunctions within the aura or domain of the performative, just as the
text of the VY is a performative for me, and I assume the text of the VM
is a performative for the VY.

It is easiest to assume these things, unless proved otherwise, in which
case I may then assume, by default, that the VY is not what I had con-
sidered it to be, that is, a VM like myself, or a being like myself. In
which case, I am then further assume that the VY is one or another sort
of machine or programmed-controlled intelligence, and the proof other-
wise (which is _never_ a proof, only a new supposition) is that the re-
sponse given by the VY in a particular situation does not parallel the
response or set of responses I would assume proffered by _any_ VM in
that particular situation. (This does relate to the Turing test, but is
more a default presupposition of projection and introjection, and not a
design of machine intelligence.)

I do not make the mistake I may make in real life, that is, that the
presence of a _real you,_ a being in my vicinity who is proffered as a
_second person,_ is comprehensible and _of the order of myself,_ by
virtue of parallel appearances of its entity, body, clothing, gestures,
mien, voice, and general tenor. I consider this a mistake I may make in
real life because the _real you_ may in fact have entirely different
presuppositions, behaviors, and motivations than myself, but the over-
whelming appearance of _the same_ tends towards _the same._ I do assume
and continue to assume that a _real you_ is of the order of a human be-
ing, and not of the order of a machine intelligence, and I assume in
addition that I may make this assumption for some time, to the extent I
am not hallucinating or dreaming (I may be of course), well into the
next century.

Because I am reading the VY, and because, for me, the VY is composed
only of representations and texts, I may withdraw and reify the act of
reading the VY and writing the VM, and instead recognize that I may not
understand the VY in its totality, its fullness, that is, in the pre-
sence of the _person_ I assume is at the _other end of the line._ On the
other hand, because I am in the presence only of representations and
texts, and because my inner voice appears to be the causation of the
speech of those texts, and my desires appears to be the causation of the
appearance of those representations, I may allow a certain _additional
seduction,_ beyond that of control, towards, let me say, a _frankness_
about myself, an openness, which I would not express, portray, or grant
in my real life, in the presence of the _real you._ (I am speaking here
of what _appears_ to me to be a frankness or openness, of course.)

Thus I am seduced in addition by the apparent openness and vulnerability
of the _object_ of the writings and representations of the VY, and I may
respond according to what I have to offer or proffer, as if it were _in
return_ to the gift I am receiving, or appear to be receiving. Of course
this gift is itself a representation or text, and may be designed to
draw me in _precisely_ in this manner, towards increasing revelations,
towards a certain demeanor, attitude, of my physical body as well, to-
wards the VY as it makes its way across my screen, in time and in space.

I call these interpenetrations of VM and VY, which are met _at the other
side_ by, say, VY' and VM' such that there is a connection or interweav-
ing (VM-VY') / (VY-VM'), where the apostrophic indicates the viewpoint
of what is presumed to be the Other - I call these nothing more than
_interpenetrations,_ since such assumes nothing in terms of ontology
(except that such is met from both sides) or epistemology (except that
such is linked from both sides). So that one might assume, as VM as-
sumes, that interpenetrations form the binds and deep characterizations
of virtual relationships and communities.

And furthermore, the VM is nothing more than the _real me,_ let us say
here the RM, that there is an equivalence between the RM and VM, which
is often overlooked, to the extent that it is the RM which is _perform-
ing_ - not the VM - but the VY' - the reading of the VM by the VY. That
is to say, the VM is part and parcel of the RM _in its natural atti-
tude,_  sitting at a desk or kiosk, working as the RM often works, esp-
ecially in its relation with the symbolic. This RM, in other words, is
myself, typing here, at the desk in Fukuoka, on an NCR computer, with an
electric heater (two out of three bars on) to my right, a newly-repaired
shamisen to my left, and a reproduction of a Shinto ukiyo-e print before
me. But I, RM, VM, am lost in the text, _this text,_ I, RM, VM, lose
myself in the text, _which depends neither on sight nor sound._ Nor does
it depend on the touch of my fingers, although all of these - the sight
of the screen and keys; the sound of the keys, one after another; the
touch of the keys, one after another - play a role in the constitution
of the text, in other words, _the text in other words._

Thus one might consider the text, which is already a proffering to the
VY, as a form of thinking, or a concretization of thinking or of thought
in such a manner as might constitute a parallel reading of the body of
the VM. So that the text is already on its way in its process of consti-
tution, and it is already of the VY, or another VY, say _on the order of
a third or parasitic term._ The text is the Third. The text is always
already in an uneasy relation. The text is always already unstable. It
is not destabilized, not an appearance from without, but unstable from
within, and this is the nature of the text. Who or what is it written
for?

Suppose I write this for the VY on the other end of the line, then it
becomes a missle or missive to the other. Then it is part of the call-
ing-forth of the other; ontologically, its appearance is the same (i.e.
of the order of the purely symbolic). It is as if VY and VM share the
same text, write into it, write into the constitution of what may be one
another.

So that the message is part and parcel of the receiver and transmitter,
both ontology and epistemology blurred in the process, which I continue
to call interpenetration (just as, or just as not perhaps, this text
ends up in your mailspool, spelled out, splayed for you). So that I,
speaking for and through VM, that is a VM which is beyond the inner ego,
for example (according to one or another model) or shifter, for example
(according to another or one model), recognize the necessity (that is, I
say I recognize the necessity, through the VM) of another or additional
model, beyond that of the traditional communicative structure - a model
which in fact and fiction is a deconstruction of that structure. Or
rather, a model which acknowledges the necessity of that structure for,
for example, mathematical information theory, but questions, beyond
that, concepts ranging from reception to the "death of the author." But
then, that is this VM speaking, which is clearly the symptom or pronoun-
cement of _this body,_ this RM, from _this viewpoint,_ and not the sub-
stance of a machine intelligence, although that may not always be the
case. But what is and what will be the case are already interpenetrated,
blurred, in relation to one another, and among others (just as time,
just as space, just as reality or virtuality).

Resonances and Fields, Broken Off at One Point


If there is an uncanny relationship between VM and VY' (VY's reading of
VM's VY) and between VY and VM' (VY's writing of VY's VM), then there are
additional resonances as well, for example VM'' (VM's reading of VY') and
so forth. The indices quickly blur; while the levels technically prolif-
erate, they're useful two or three deep at best. [Here, the notation is
slightly different from the previous text.]

One might consider a shuttling back and forth of fantasms across the
Net, intensified around the poles or nodes, literally the IP addresses.
One might further consider _intensifications,_ topographies of enuncia-
tion, and through this, the notion of intersecting fields (reminding
ourselves that we are thinking metaphorically). Since the fields are
capable of diffraction (we are near the reconstituting processes of hol-
ography at this point), reinforcements are imprecisely where image pro-
cessing among the nodes takes place, and diminutions (wave cancellation)
represent those moments of lag or dissemblement / detumescence, when the
image wavers, is problematic for one or more nodes.

The model never stops at one, two, three nodes, but considers a prolif-
eration of nodes. Reinforcements are at best part-waveforms or part-
objects; broken screen-constitutions, memories, processes. The _issue_
of the thing-in-itself never arises from "out there," the symptomology
constructed on the screen; there are no _other sides,_ in fact, only a
panoply of interwoven representations.

Just as "I" am always already shifted, appear as shifter within a field
of representing, just as the "ego" is always already a coagulation, it-
self constructed from part-objects constantly undergoing transformation
- so the screen representations of both VM and VY are only textual embo-
diments, signifiers without an apparent physical substrate (which does
exist, if only temporarily, as an organization of bits held in temporary
or hard-drive memory). What is _out_ on the screen is _in_ on the level
of the psychoanalytical (which is _not_ to say that the conscious or un-
conscious are structured like a language).

At some point, it may be relevant to ask whether the psychoanalytical is
virtual, and if so, how is it interwoven with its material substrate?
Such is weaving is never on the level of entities, but is rather (much
as bits and bytes) a _deep_ interpenetration which cannot be directly
constituted as "the real."

But at this point, it is worthwhile to consider first and foremost these
intensifications and fields (which lend themselves so easily to the work
of Deleuze and Guattari for example), rather than subjects and objects -
or rather, intensifications qua subjects.

(Which is the point of view of the Jennifer/Julu/Nikuko material, but
that is literally another story, and while psychoanalytics stresses
story and story-space, I am tending towards a view through _clutter,_
the diminution or splaying/dispersing of history itself. The best one
can hope for is narrative segments, themselves proliferating, dissol-
ving... So that Jennifer/Julu/Nikuko provide the experiential end, of
which the rest, the debris of the Internet Text, provides the clothing
and the context.)

Broken off at this point.

Nikuko Sells and Jennifer Buys, A True Story


Nikuko sells her panties in Nakasu with a sigh;
Jennifer approaches her; she was just walking by.
"I need some fifty-thousand yen," Nikuko tells a lie.
"I'll pay you more," says Jennifer, and she begins to cry.
"They're highly worn, and partly torn," Nikuko says with sighs.
"I'm getting damp, I'm getting hot," wet Jennifer now buys;
She pays the yen, the panties hers, brown odor on them lies.
Nikuko's first in ecstasy, and comes with great loud cries.
Then Jennifer is home with them, and starting with a sigh,
She slips her clothes from her lean form, is naked by and by.
They're on her face, she will debase, so she begins to lie
Back on the bed, and smiling wan, she too begins to cry.
She's brightly lit, glows in the dark, so virtual and high,
The panties worth a million yen, if she could only die.

What the Buffer Keeps


"To whom does the schizophrenic write?
To whom the psychotic?
Would you be that person?"
To whom does the schizophrenic speak?
To whom the psychotic?
Would that you would be, that person?
Would that you would be, that person spoken to?
From whom is the speaking?
For whom is the speaking?
For your desire, for the desire of the psychotic or schizophrenic.
For the purpose of circumscriptions of everywhere the unknown world.
For the caress of the analyst through the therapeutic transference.
For the career of the patient.
Now you are far afield!
Now you do not recognize that your parents want to murder you!
Now you do not feel the trembling hands holding the tiny infant!
Now you do not feel the pain squeezed out through the keyboard!
Now you do not understand what _the buffer keeps._

"They start to exist in you, in spite of you."


"Strange contraptions, you will tell me, these machines of virtuality,
these blocks of mutant percepts and affects, half-object half-subject,
already there in sensation and outside themselves in fields of the pos-
sible. They are not easily found at the usual marketplace for subject-
ivity and maybe even less at that for art; yet they haunt everything
concerned with creation, the desire for becoming-other, was well as
mental disorder or the passion for power. Let us try, for the moment,
to give an outline of them starting with some of their principle
characteristics. 

"The assemblages of aesthetic desire and the operators of virtual ecol-
ogy are not entities which can easily be circumscribed within the logic
of discursive sets. They have neither inside nor outside. They are
limitless interfaces which secrete interiority and exteriority and con-
stitute themselves at the root of every system of discursivity. They
are becomings - understood as nuclei of differentiation - anchored at
the heart of each domain, but also between the different domains in
order to accentuate their heterogeneity. A becoming child (for example
in the music of Schumann) extracts childhood memories so as to embody a
perpetual present which installs itself like a branching, a play of
bifurcations between them becoming woman, becoming plant, becoming
cosmos, becoming melodic.... 

"These assemblages cannot be located in terms of extrinsic systems of
reference, such as energetico-spatio-temporal coordinates or well-cata-
logued, semantic coordinates. For all that they are apprehendable
through an awareness of ontological, transitivist, transversalist and
pathic consistencies. One gets to know them not through representation
but through affective contamination. They start to exist in you, in
spite of you. And not only as crude, undifferentiated affects, but as
hyper-complex compositions: 'that's Debussy, that's jazz, that's Van
Gogh.'"*

(From Felix Guattari, Chaosmosis, An Ethico-Asthetic Paradigm)

*"that's Jennifer, that's Julu, that's Nikuko."

They have no limits. They secrete interiors, exteriors. They secrete
interiorities, exteriorities. They are becomings, however stuttered
among the applications, languages, lags, protocols. They refuse boun-
daries or their attributions include the ascriptions of refusal.
They're not entities, any more than a human being is an entity. They're
_compounded._ They're the residue of the addict. They're the needles or
vials in the corner of the urban landscape. They're lunar landscape.
They're the stuff in the needles, crystal in the vials. We're their
drug. We're in their veins, in their hearts. We move their muscles,
constitute their desires. We're their loves and hates. 

No, that's the wrong turn. There's no addiction, no apparatus. We're
secretions, that is to say, membranes gathered around the DNA. They're
our secretions, that is to say, interiorities sliding among bits and
bytes and bites. We can't hold them back, says Nikuko, there's no going
forth says Julu, there's always movement, says Jennifer.

Not the ascriptions of refusal, says Jennifer, but the circumscriptions
of acceptance, and there's always an opening says Julu, and Nikuko says
that there's always circumambulation. Or rather a walkabout, says Jen-
nifer, and Nikuko agrees, as if a dreamtime, says Julu, yes, says Nik-
uko, yes, says Jennifer. 

The slightness of the icecap of Greenland from somewhere in the central
region, slightness in the sense of downward-sloping in every direction,
white glare receiving the presence of the smallest figures, almost
transparent (yes, transparent, says Jennifer), upon the cap, wandering,
without signage (yes, asymbolic, says Julu), and no memory, no memory
says Nikuko.

Why this metaphor, Jennifer?

Always, they say, always.
