some things on the music */[...]/*

i or so

avoidance of noise ,then how to schedule fury or furious ,how to 
subtend silence */how to breathe ,how to subtend breathing/*

i don't want this thinking: that this is exploring instrument, 
instrumentality ,nor a field ,subtended by fingers or mouth ,no 
more than body

but the joist of particle physics ,muons on a sense of virtual 
particles on another

(a b) (a, b) (a / b) (a : b) (a | b) (a f(a, b) b)

it is all resonance ,surprising ,metallic overtones ,ringing: i 
remember just several sounds slowed into what seemed right even 
then

*/thinking among unthinking ,something about emptiness ,but 
something about thrust and elimination ,the tube ,the platform/*

foreign names touched by cultural illiteracy ,materials ,soundings,
emptied virtuosities

stringed, it is stringing ,perfect tautness ,resistance of 
parallel field ,tension of endpoint separation ,tension of 
separation */tension of aspiration ,breath-length ,incomplete 
phrasing/*

i do not want to duplicate this ,i do not want to duplicate an 
other

*/i wanna be an other ,i dont wanna be an other other ,i wanna 
be hir ,i wanna be hir breathe/*

something informing ,hypnagogic as if you might dream this ,an 
other or dream an other this */i wanna breathe hir/*

but not tiring ,tirade ,more of a space of a sounding or what 
might be 'some of a sound' */i dont wanna tirade ,now too much 
violence everywhere, wanna something else/*

of mewling ,howling ,whimpering ,murmuring ,seething ,then this amazing
release

neither to be where you have been nor will have gone there ,here is 
one alone ,playing music ,playing music together

tending the wood ,nylon ,skin ,metal ,plastic ,catgut ,horsehair 
,wax, bamboo ,bone ,or tending the wires */tending the reed ,the 
silk ,sub-tending the air within ,thinned line among these/*

the absence of metaphor ,wires ,no paralleling ,the difficulty
of absence ,no equivalence ,no identity ,just as everything else is,
or remains ,inert

sound of the obdurate ,sound of the inert

ii or so

learning to play these ,evenings or nights' mornings ,but with 
all respect ,coaxing ,no world music ,no world but what ,are we 
brought, to */,but what world has brought us/*

here's an idea ,so i'll do it ,hear what happens ,when new ,then 
so it is brought */,then so it is given/*

always writing in silence ,always playing in silence ,playing 
silence, listening silence ,enormous roiling ,slow extinction of 
the planet, these last sounds ,instrument making ,them

she got up from the music ,he got down to the music,
he got up from the music ,she got down to the music

you'll be telling me specifically what you want to know,
i'll be telling you specifically what you want to know

allowing myself the courtesy of being-deaf, 
allowing yourself my fingering you ,of being-sound & of mind & body

listing ,yayli tanbur ,ukulele ,cobza ,hasapi ,cura cumbus 
,hegelung, rababa ,electric saz ,valveless chromatic harmonica 
,parlor guitar, classical guitar ,alpine prime zither ,alpine 
elegy zither ,like the emptying of names */listening to others 
,fast-forward changing instrumentation/*

unknown on my fault ,something else of shameful ,refusing 
abjection in the moment when nail and steel ,flesh and wood 
,collide

unknown ,everywhere i look ,unknown

iii or so

i'm not giving you what you want ,that is ,an entry into this 
sound, some of an anecdote ,or at the very least, an explanation 
,as in, 'you owe me an explanation' */or you owe me nothing ,or 
you begin ,just now ,to owe everything ,you owe nothing to me/*

i wouldn't know how to begin ,perhaps in eternal sorrow 
,mourning, every minute of the life ,or the slightest peaks of 
joy ,or stories about failure quantum-tunneled into music of 
unutterable beauty ,or musics

or something about how these instruments came about ,what do i 
know of their arrival ,or this i know ,their attraction for me 
,sounding of the world through them ,fretless ,they are teaching 
me how to listen ,place each finger in its rough exactitude 
*/,watch the finger travel/*

or fretted in narrowed intervals ,what might be ,for others ,or 
those places of others ,a difference in any world ,or numbers of 
worlds ,worlds without number ,over and over again, desperately 
listening ,listening ,as if something might come about, occur 
,just by the sheer force of it

or the slow sweep of the bow as left hand fumbles for tone or tune,
begins its slower repetition ,*/[...]/*savoring

iv or so

it is more you want ,more you ever want ,this savagery ,this 
lack of mine ,of yours ,one more word ,phrase ,sound or tune 
,book or text, of book and of sound ,of tune and of text ,that 
will do it ,completion, or suturing ,the fullness of the world 
,fecundity, repleteness, lathering ,or foam of planck mass 
,length ,time ,of vacuum and an energy ,of particle and fray 
*/,too much physics ,unthinking ,what this has to do with it 
,revrev and anticipatory architectures ,philosophy and 
archeology of hope/*

this savagery a savagery ,silence a quiescence, calmness ,the 
piercing ,of things ,of some things ,on the music ,on the music

drove across us providence to omaha 23 1/2 hours 
we were up for 38 hours, now playing clarinet to
bluejays gathered around the porch between thunder
storms to listen to my own personal ornithology
this time they're enveloped in silence & admiration
i was so well pleased at the enjoyment promised to
come back for more & they were so well pleased

Delivering Missouri

the instruments delivered to the National Music Museum
in Vermillion, South Dakota; we donated these unique and
delicate objects, and it was wonderful to sense the
humidity/temperature controlled environment, necessary
for their preservation.

http://www.alansondheim.org/nmm04.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/nmm06.jpg

a few days ago, by the banks of the wandering, sinuous,
sandbanked, debris-gathering, Missouri River, with signs
of the encroaching rigidity of civilization and 
parceling out the rigor of surveying and flood control

http://www.alansondheim.org/missouri.mp4

we were traveling at 70 mph, well below the speed limit,
a grackle started to fly into the car, I braked, the 
bird hit on the left rounded hood surface, the sound was
terrible, the first time for me, the bird disappeared, 
no trace, perhaps stunned somewhere, perhaps flown off,
perhaps broken

the cars don't belong on the road

their encroaching rigidity

we brought the instruments to the National Music Museum
in Vermillion, South Dakota

http://www.alansondheim.org/councilbluffed.mp4

Images of a Ladakhi flute, given to me by Fred Lieberman, an 
ethnomusicologist and qin expert. The flute is constructed with 
reed, tar, and duct tape, and has an architecture similar to 
Native American flutes (see the Wikipedia article on the 
subject). Lieberman speculated there was a historic cultural 
relationship between the two groups. I had an Albert System C 
clarinet - this was decades ago - and I gave it to him; he 
wanted to play klezmer, and we were friends. In return, he gave 
me the Ladakhi instrument as a gift; he said he had gotten it in 
Ladakh. I remember all of this poorly, and am fascinated by the 
potential musical parallels between the Native American regions 
and Ladakh. I hope the National Music Museum will research this. 
And how accurate is my memory of his recounting, after so many 
years? (I had to keep the flute refrigerated, by the way so that 
the tar would retain its shape.)

The video is a collection of still images I shot at the museum - 
instruments I was interested in, as well as some establishment 
shots.

On the way to and from Vermillion on Route 29, we noticed dead 
trees on the western side of the road, near the Missouri River; 
this is likely the result of flooding a couple of years ago. The 
eastern side was going through the usual spring budding. All of 
this near Council Bluffs with its cylindrical iron jail; hence 
the title of the video.

We're a block from the Gerald Ford Birthplace,
Betty Ford Danced with Martha Graham, perhaps 
there's a photograph in my Barbara Morgan book?
These images are from the birthplace and park.
I think about the prairie and Lee Murray has
given me an old 10-hole Hohner Chromonica in G
and I make believe I am a prairie.

I recognize this will stop soon enough when we
return to dark and medieval Providence where 
the streets are paved.

Johannes Birringer and I are next to each other
in the forthcoming issue of VLAK.

I forgot to mention the streets are paved here 
in Omaha, I didn't mean to imply otherwise. And
today I came close to another episode of
depression. I exist by rereading Hermann Weyl's
Symmetry with the full hope I turn back again.

I cannot imagine a man.

And Betty Ford? She's marvelous.

Surge


working on the Surge article

Surge is the overthrowing of all values, ideologies, and structures.
It is the absolute overthrowing of all histories, privacies, persons.
It is the total extinction of all species, including our own.
It is the scorching of the scorching of the earth.
Let's talk about this. Let's build around the surge.
Let's build around the dying and absolute annihilation. Let's do it.

around a dam adjacent to Morgantown. we were
told the Army Corps of Engineers operated the
facility, but declined cleanup, that it wasn't
their responsibility. the trash apparently
finds its way down the Mississippi. we have no
idea if this is true or not, but the river
in this part of WV is a mess. we'd appreciate
any information anyone might have about the 
situation; it's been the same ever since we've 
been coming to Morgantown.

Surge compendium


Proceed.

http://www.alansondheim.org/0000.jpg

"Surge is the overthrowing of all values, ideologies, and 
structures. It is the absolute overthrowing of all histories, 
privacies, persons. It is the total extinction of all species, 
including our own. It is the scorching of the scorching of the 
earth. Let's talk about this. Let's build around the Surge. 
Let's build around the dying and absolute annihilation. Let's do 
it." (ca 2015)

Proceed.
A pixel is a digital object.
Between one pixel and another, there is annihilation.
Annihilation seethes.
There is nothing else but an epistemology of demarcated 
positions and ontology.
Post-digital is digital; post-digital has equivalent 
epistemology.
A digital object is substrate-dependent.
The substrate is an object and from this we adduce strata and 
structures of digital objects.
Proceed.
The Surge is just that, the Surge of digital objects and 
substrates, replacing everything in the world.
Annihilation is the potential for transformation of everything 
in the world.
Annihilation to the limit is extinction.
Abjection and truth are intertwined.
Abjection and truth inhabit the substrate.
The digital object is a mapping of its substrate and its 
substrate is subject to replacement, duplication, reassignment 
and other transformations.
The substrate is a moment of the digital object.
The entanglement of truth and abjection within the substrate is 
within a continuous state of annihilation and potential wells.
The digital object is an object of reading; the substrate is a 
surface of writing. 
The Surge loads substrates with digital objects.
Proceed.
The Surge replaces objects with digital objects.
Aura is always an entangled raster.
The Surge replaces aura with increasingly fine rasters.
Rasters are inscriptions and demarcations.
One might say that rasters are inscriptions within the 
metaphysical, that substrates possess no rasters, that mapping 
is from raster to substrate.
The digital object is a choice.
The digital object may be a choice of a substrate object.
If a substrate object is chosen or not chosen, it will be 
scorched.
If a substrate object is chosen, it may be inscribed.
The inscription of a substrate object is not a substrate object.
The inscription of a body is not a body.
The inscription of a body may inhere within the body, and may be 
entangled within the body.
The substrate of an inhered inscription is within states of 
annihilation and potential wells.
The digital object neither exhausts physical objects nor its 
substrate.
The digital object is an insertion into protocol farms and 
networks, including translations fundamentally based on the 
employment of process and power; to the extent that the digital 
object functions as an insertion, it is subject to movements 
across substrates.
Proceed.
The digital object is en garde. 
The digital object is an instance.
The scorched earth of the scorched earth is annihilation to the 
limit and the elimination of the instance.
Reproduction of digital objects is finite.
A reproduction machine itself may be reproduced.
At the heart of the reproduction machine, at the heart of any 
object, digital or otherwise, is annihilation.
Annihilation inhabits the absolute, and the desire for absolute 
annihilation constructs the scorched earth of the scorched 
earth.
Proceed.
The Surge constructs a new earth, new habitus, new environment.
One cannot turn back, one cannot return, from the Surge.
The fundamental characteristic of the Surge, at this point, is 
the simultaneous recuperation of every history, every culture, 
every text, and the annihilation of every history, every 
culture, every text.
The simulacrum of recuperation is a simulacrum.
Simulacra are simultaneously recuperated and annihilated. 
The Surge proceeds from fundamental annihilation.
The Surge is simultaneously the relativization of the world, and 
its absolute. 
Proceed.
The Surge is violation fabric; on the nub of the Surge, we bear 
witness to annihilation.
Proceed.
It is not even a matter of time.
It is not even a matter of bearing witness.
There are no matters of which 'it is a matter.'
Proceed.
The _mob_ of the Surge.
Proceed.
The _overwhelming_ of the world, of any other world.
Uselessness and annihilation of philosophies.
Proceed.

Bewails (ca. 1996)

An Older Mind bewails nations. It hovers dark, interconnected at 
nodes, sprayed in star-configurations connected across night- 
twinkling-stars, incandescent bulbs streaked with blue at 
magnification 150 just across town. An Older Mind would bend 
deep in Thought, would stir dark waters into dark and stillborn 
Action. An Older Mind would enumerate Nations gaunt and hoary, 
branches of trees rustling the sky stormed into carbon-russet 
darkness. Lightning is sky-crack, cragged break of black 
porcelain, Older Mind Sim-Symbolic illumination burned into 
seven-layered blood-stained retinal booking down to bedrock 
flaked with muscovite.

Older Mind is t = 0, is <=refresh> constant, emission into 
screen-object, sound-object. Older Mind turns at t0 pace, 
haunted as body heaves thrust onto side; it ponders for 
No-Reason, is None. None hurtles downward into No-Reason; only 
nations say split, no capital. Look elsewhere than there. Older 
Mind shudders sky-bowl swollen, crusted with Sim-Symbolic. 
Bewail.

Failure to Overwhelm (ca. 1996)

To theorize the Net, analyze it according to one or another 
model (see below), to examine it without any philosophical 
presuppositions (an impossibility), to include or exclude 
metaphysics: A closed - an academic loop is formed, the 
placement of a book or article (I try for this myself), but what 
occurs beyond this, what reason, what point (reason collapsed to 
a node)?

What can theory _provide_ if it is not, for example, descriptive 
kinesics, software design philosophy, standardization of 
protocols, typifications? It remains an augmentation, appendaged 
to what? Half in and out of the corpus of philosophical 
discourse, applied philosophy, but towards what ends? What? 
(Consider _here_ the onset-characteristics of a trumpet tone.)

There is of course the theorizing of the virtual - from a 
phenomenological viewpoint, theory describing _stuff_ on several 
levels, the _stuffing_ in fact of cyberspace itself, however 
that term is defined, split, deconstructed. Of course there are 
no conclusions; there are, instead, parallels, analogs, 
interstitial or liminal displays of language.

Statistics appear in sociological analysis, almost always soft. 
Structures may or may not emerge. Whatever they're made to speak 
is manufactured. On the other hand, considerations of Being, 
etc. lend themselves to curious metaphysics. These can go 
anywhere, routed in roots.

This _applied_ theory centers it _on topic,_ a source of decay. 
What if there's no theory-otherwise? What theory-otherwise would 
apply? What ghosts enter the maelstrom, alternative selves, 
ectoplasms, staggered or schizzed personalities inhabiting the 
same flesh?

Theory vis-a-vis topicality _here_ is already abject, a vestige 
of territorialized minor philosophy, slide-rule humans 
approaching the discarded object, still clothed and 
canvas-wrapped. Minor philosophy, perhaps in the sense of 
Deleuze and Guattari, minor literature.

Even the psychoanalytics of the space generate ghost shots at a 
new subjectivity - but these things change on an almost daily 
basis.

All this spells ennui, the peculiar analytical burnout where 
cyberspace theory is concerned, entrance and exit _the 
doldrums._ It's partly the socio-political atmosphere of "the 
times," exhaustion as theory becomes mechanism, predictable, 
unused, negative dialectics. On one hand, articulation is all 
there is; on the other, overwhelming information all the way 
down/across, well-definition literally ruling, graduating the 
day. The liminal fails to erupt; the liminal is theorized.

Proceed.

Paul, Sail On (ca. 1996)

If I gather up, will you bury me, will you bury me if I gather 
  up
Your ambergris, your bronze helmet, your amber, your bronze
Swollen by river's wake by cavern opening cavern awakened by the 
  river's swell
Motivated by gutted reeds cut stuttered clay, read in gorgeous 
  monuments gone motivated
If I lie with you, will you lie with me, if I lay with you will 
  you lay with me
Near the pregnant cow near the gutted horse near the emptied 
  house by the coward's prayer
Through the dim dark night by the knight's despair by the armor
  there
If I wash for you by the river's edge and I wash for you by the 
  same edge of the river
Where down the river there is a gathering of knights and women, 
  I think they are celebrating Telipinu at the moment

Yes, I will lie with you, I will lay with you, I will sacrifice, 
  you will sacrifice
Your horse, your cow, yourself, against my golden hair, my eyes 
  of blue
Sparkling in the waters pooling by the marshes, waters sprinkled 
  with blood, swollen with whitened
Bones you have slaughtered, your bones you have slaughtered
While I, while I
  I'm leaving for Telipinu.

cancers flooding the body in part or in full, tumors attacking 
one or another organ, membrane-spreads of _illnesses of the 
surface,_ attacks on bodies non-virtual of all ages, genders,**

there are millenarian warnings as the human tide heats up, 
microbes approach with landing-gear erect, this is serious as 
insecure bodies escape to the cybersphere, sloughed skin 
dragging them back,

we are close to degeneracy genes gone bad in polluted air not 
responding to antibiotics lost, no longer fortification bunker 
against molecular transformations, lost, in other worlds, the 
air itself,

wires clean wires with electrons, cloyed filaments, carbon dark 
against smoothed electron emissions, tunneling, run around the 
sync clock, skin a sin or shame a dark shadow, no longer named 
but ceased symbolic,

so we slough skins, our poisons trail behind us, so our 
membranes turn translucent, troubled, and there were no tomorrow

Justice (ca. 1996)

There is no justice in this world! That is, because justice is 
never _of_ or _in_ the world, nor is it a horizon of the world, 
nor of community, nor of the subject. Then one can never be 
just? One can act accordingly, as if justice were a past that 
still encompasses the present. This is the dream, the opium, the 
simulacrum, abstraction, but without it, irrigation disappears 
and selves dissolve, as if they had once existed.

Surge/Cut

http://www.alansondheim.org/surgery.jpg

surgery is from surge, to cut from the body, annihilate;
to surge is to purge, purjery, annihilate the truth, violate
the body politic, violate the corporeal body; to surge is
to annihilate the corporeal politic and the political corpus;
to annihilate is to swallow space and time; to swallow 
space-time; to annihilate surgery and the potential for
surgery; to embrace space and time. thus the 'blown-out' body
of the ancients is the eliminated/purged/expurgated body, the
eviscerated body, the absent body, the absence of absence,
hence dependent-arising. thus the dependent-arising is the
totality of space and time, emptied of body and surgery: that
is the Surge.

The thick core is cored, tangled strands appear and disappear,
generally I avoid the blurred chaos at work here; here, they're
celebrated, embraced; the notes are there; in 1, the long-
necked saz door is shut; in 2, the door is open, the bass moves
forward; in both the weaving of a rope useful for a suspension
or bridge; as if the core were cored, swallowed; music goes
down into spatial striations, thick time; Surge sound, model of
future life; an engine; engine without substance; imaginary
engine of the future perfect; the core cored; the Down.



Surge

"The transformation is so enormous, there's no way to describe 
it; everything we say, everything we are, everything we do, it 
is all false, broken; it is all irrelevant; the models are 
useless, irrelevant; you know the drill; you fill in the rest; 
you take care; you walk away; you walk away slowly; you are no

chucking for me. No value-chucking for my transvaluation! It

of all values and their surge; I'm chucking values now. The

irish banjo's a bit easier but not like this

it's all braided, busy, maybe but one alto recorder, so what

A medical model implies internal flows, striations, identities, 
vulnerabilities, immunological defenses, maintenance and so 
forth. Emphasis is on the cohering of parts, membranes and 
molecular channels. Organism runs from within; emanent runs from 
without. An emanent may be defined as an image or apparition 
whose body and mind are elsewhere, an entity that exists in 
relation to the jectivity braid, and has apparent, but not 
genidentical, identity. Of course the organic body itself is 
genidentical only to a limited extent.

All choices are braided, contingent, contiguous. The the

Human skin under the microtome, sheave-skin burrowed into by 
camera position. Here is the necessity of Madhyamika, 
co-dependent origination, depend co-origination, braided mind, 
image, imaginary, entity, real and virtual within, inhering to 
the true world. Striated, variegated transformations 
characterize life; the Visible Human Project transforms organism 
into emanent, habitus into data-base.

Jennifer, continuing sheaf braid. Oh handshaking towards 
fruition? Not always, but almost always, avatars are smaller 
than one's physical body, or appear so.

One might begin by considering language as fundamentally ikonic, 
that within the preconscious ('repository' of syntactics, 
short-term memory - another metaphor) language is clothed, 
associated with the true world.  Language then is structured 
like the unconscious, and the unconscious does not necessarily 
splay the real. Bodies, organic and emanent (and 'organic' 
references the machinic phylum as well), inhere to mind, 
minding, tending, a posteriori interpretation and hermeneutics. 
Reading the body is embodying, is against the background of 
incarnation. Sheave-skins need not react or appear to sense as 
organic skins; the feedback is often visual or aural, not 
proprioceptive. Within the jectivity braid, this is an 
epistemological issue, not one of fundamental locus. On the 
other hand (real or virtual), one can abandon the emanent; 
abandoning the organic is deadly.  Proceed backwards from this, 
from the irretrievable, intolerable, finality of death, and 
reading bodies, and bodily risk, become wildly disparate. 
Nevertheless both inhabit the true world, mind inhabits both, 
albeit often in qualitatively different manners, depending on 
ontology.

Ontologies occur in local domains, rub raw against each other, 
problematize each other. Who decided this one or that one as 
primordial? What's fundamental is the mixed mess, the braid. At 
least as far as we're concerned, the braid. Sheaves/braids/self- 
cancellation. What twists, knots the octahedron.

The plastic limits of the body are the limits of body-inherency, 
whether 'real' or 'virtual' or other category - the limits of 
the image carried by the jectivity (introjection and projection) 
braid. The static limits may be considered formal-measurable 
limits, whether in one or another space.
