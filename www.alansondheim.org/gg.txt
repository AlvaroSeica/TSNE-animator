Over a hundred times I've had to follow the paths below, adding new files
to the Internet Text as they _accumulate,_ transform into theoretical sub-
stance. Last night, file ff was added to the rest, and the net index was
updated. The files are easily retrievable; the whole morass is around
four megabytes of solid bristly ascii. 

I travel from panix.com to the site at jefferson.village.virginia.edu, and
then: 

341	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
342	ftp panix3.panix.com	[getting file]
343	wc ff				
344	ls -l ee		[checking permissions]
345	chmod 664 ff		
346	ls -l ff		[changing, checking permissions]
347	cd
348	cd public_html
349	pico internet_txt.html	[adding access on home-page for filename]
350	ftp panix3.panix.com	[preparing home-page for download]
351	exit
352	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
353	ls -l netindex.txt
354	rm netindex.txt		[removing old index for Internet Text]
355	ftp panix3.panix.com	[adding new index]
356	chmod 664 netindex.txt
357	ls -l netindex.txt	[checking permissions]

I exit, enter internet_txt.html from panix.com, make sure everything is
running properly. I have had to change the netindex.txt first, by down-
loading ff, and toggling between it and online. The index has grown to
390 entries, something for everybody. It's spidery, out of control; it 
has bones in it. The sequence above, server-side, is the bi-weekly stir-
ring of the soup.

What I'd say if I had tongue to speak:


I'd say yes, the hands bleed in cyberspace, pools of everything on the
keyboards - hopes, warfares, ammunitions and remissions. I'd say we're all
blind _here_ or deaf _here_ - that we're all groping in the dark, to find
our way through to the virtual light. 

This is absurd; blindness and deafness have nothing to do with this space,
and to consider them in regard to it is to play into the hands, feet, head
of prejudice, the politics of deafness for example, the enunciation of
sign language, the problematics of the verbal sphere.

Mouths open up speech balloons in any medium, format; stigmata occur be-
cause we're overwhelmed with the passion of part-objects - holes in the
hands, feet, and head. 

A hole is cyberspace "is-when-you" stop speaking, writing, staring, JUST
FOR A MINUTE - that's a hole! And a whole is _any_ address, protocol, re-
cognition you bring to your JUST-CAUSE, JUST-CAUSE-FIRST-CAUSE!

We're stigmatized here. We don't belong here. We belong in the open air. 
We're led by boy-girls girl-boys. We're led by greed, capital-flux, capi-
tal-shit draining the last remnants of air out of cyberspace. We're led by
64-bit graphics gone all the way 2^n out to infinite rows of Jasper's ci-
phers. & Older & Younger Will Dance The Strathspey!

Hands, feet, and head, we're bound. We've taken up the cross: We're taken
up to it: It's easy VRML! We're dripping like crazy. Plug the leak in
finger; finger the dike. The signifier's just-so. O holy Mary. O so sew
so sewn shut. From O to NULL: from O to NULL: Rain in!

Stupid Useless GOD (Good Old Days)


As I wrote to my friend, I said, that the Net is becoming more like a
publishing company for fanzines, developing a fanzine mentality which
places corporate processes just behind the scenes of proffered bodies and
cool products! As I said to my neighbor, the good old days of anarchic
renderings of said bodies, free discussion and experimentation, are being
replaced by continued regulation, particularly in Europe and Asia at this
point, America dying to take the lead! As I cautioned my students,
children are being used as tokens in the control of speech and bodies;
sexualities are becoming increasingly matters of the state; serial killers
and rapists are placed in the same category as gays and cross-dressers,
not to mention adulterers, oral sex fanatics, consumers of pornography,
lovers of bestiality, golden showers and coprophilia addicts, paramours of
dead bodies and fiancees, s/m participants, b/d advocates, ac/dc electri-
cians, and mac/pc owners! As I prayed to my not so virgin Mary, deliver us
from the evil that surrounds us, this cacophony of corporate and private
greed, this evil pressure of finance and government, for the right wing is
right, and we are engaged in a full-scale cultural war with liars and mur-
derers who fuck children in order to harness their screams for the ignor-
ant mills of rumor, popular opinion, innuendo, prison and life-time sen-
tencing for _thinking_ - for everyone has something to say about the Net:

(I was asked to give the opening address at the Perth conference on cyb-
ermind. The following is an outline of the talk, which would be drawn
from this extemporaneously; I'd appreciate any comments you might have.
Thanks, Alan) 


1. Cybermind - what the list is, what it has meant to me, both in terms
of community and research. 


2. Research into virtuality: Humanity begins to make a leap _somewhere
else_ that involves, inherently, the digital domain. The traditional
analog world of philosophy is turned inside-out. How can one theorize
the digital?

a. The immediate approach cannot be looking at the world around one
(sitting at a desk, red patch, etc.), since the digital world is con-
struct. Therefore a philosophy will also be an anthropology, involving
both intervention and participation, as well as bracketing.

b. The intervention/participation is _background_ and _foreground,_
understanding and acknowledging software options, languages, connection
bandwidths, filtering options, hardware requirements, protocols, and the
range of commands available to the user and administrator.

c. As _foreground,_ personal experience and some understanding of phen-
omenological description are necessary. I attempt myself to extend as far
as possible into the virtual realm, within and across applications. I
attempt to work on the margins of an application in relation to decon-
struction on one hand, and substructure/hacking on the other. I think it
is necessary to associate and disassociate the levels in 2b., including
various interfaces, and the phenomenology/psychoanalytics of virtuality. 

d. Examples - Traceroute indicating breakdown across the Net; understand-
ing netsplits in relation to IRC; understanding both the signified as
fluid (anything standing for anything within textuality) and proper name
(netsplit standing for concrete rupture).

e. The linguistic dispersion model of the Internet - fluxes of languages,
communities. Wherever there is a niche with at least one-to-one or more
communicating, both community and sexuality develop.

f. Ontology and epistemology in relation to virtuality, virtual subjec-
tivity, virtual entities.


3. Introduction to issues to be considered later - low bandwidth, easily
available applications. Haves and have-nots within the virtual and real.
Advantages and disadvantages of wiring everyone.

Brooklyn is a borough which has infolded upon itself, in-formed itself,
recuperated political boundaries, time and time again; its somewhat
natural boundaries limit its physical growth. Reminiscent of medieval
London, it is a confabulation of smaller villages; the resulting coag-
ulation obscures even the slope of Park Slope (parkslope.jpg), unless
seen from the parapet of the Williamsburg Bank Building (flatbush.jpg),
the tallest in Brooklyn.

I live in a region of three cultures, defined, not according to ethnici-
ty, but by the size and topography of the thoroughfares passing through
it. Within a few blocks of my loft (home.jpg), a number of major streets
come together:  Atlantic, Fulton, Fourth Avenue, and Flatbush (flatbush.-
jpg). Fourth, Atlantic, and Flatbush are all major arteries connecting to
Manhattan;  Flatbush forms the central spine of downtown (Fulton Mall). 
Traffic on these streets is fast and reckless at times;  I've seen liter-
ally dozens of accidents, ranging from fender-benders to the strewing of
an entire family in pieces across Flatbush. 

Locally, Flatbush is a connector with small businesses providing somewhat
weak centers of attraction (a hardware store, hair parlors, etc.). For
the most part, the businesses are poor, as they are around my building
(Dean Street and Fifth Avenue, home.jpg); there are abandoned store-
fronts, and just up Fifth, abandoned buildings as well. But there is also
a vibrant streetlife on Fifth, which is an extension of more set neigh-
borhoods, those that provide strong attractors, with rising real-estate
prices (see parkslope.jpg) such as Park Slope, Boerum Hill, and Brooklyn
Heights.

Change between one and another neighborhood in Brooklyn is super-fast; 
cross a street, and you can be _somewhere else_ entirely. In my immediate
vicinity, the _artery culture_ creates a node-to-node sensibility; even
though the roads are local (i.e. with local access and not elevated), the
traffic may well not be. Think of this as the territory of the Web; in
fact, a Mall, one of the largest in New York, is opening about a quarter
mile from me, in the center of the "no-man's land" carved out of the maj-
or thoroughfare intersections (see noman.jpg).

This territory is _not_ primarily business or strip-mall; it simply be-
longs nowhere, and the speed of the traffic means that there is very
little contestation for physical (asychronous). There are major police
and fire stations nearby, but even without them, drugs and gangs would
have little reason to operate on those traffic islands that Ballard so
brilliantly wrote about.

Because of its emptiness, social welfare agencies have moved in. There
are psychoanalytical, AIDs, unemployment, and medical services nearby.
These services tend to use pre-existing buildings; while they preserve
the architectural character of the neighborhood (which is close to nil),
they contribute to a non-local flow that contributes to keeping the area
mostly non-local in feeling.

People find _pathways_ across the no-man's land region, in order to shop,
visit, go to school or work, and so forth. Unlike the Net, these pathways
are obdurate, impossible to displace. On the Net, the cinematic jump-cut
reigns; a link can be local or global. On CuSeeMe two nights ago, for
example, I was connected to Italy, Idaho, and Antarctica (Mc Murdo). 

Local culture, the neighborhood, is defined as a place, site of contes-
tation, and resistance. It is a place which has temporal continuity, and
is often connected with local narratives, which help anchor the sense of
community. It need not follow along sexual preference or ethnic lines (my
neighborhood, for example, is radically mixed), but often does. On the
Net, a neighborhood is a "home"; one calls, for example, PMC2-MOO hir
home, even though s/he may be have a home _within_ the MOO indicated by
the @sethome feature. 

Within various MOOs, there have been discussion about the phenomenology
of the @go and @join commands, both of which result in "jump-cutting"
across the virtual terrain. While this allows immediate access to people
and sites (I favor it), it does reduce the feeling of distance or mapped
terrain (some MOOs like Media operate off of a central map, as a matter
of fact - as do most MUDs and talkers). There is no labor involved, no
sense of landscaping. The neighborhood becomes a jumped node - but then,
one jumps "into" a MOO in the first place (note the preposition).

Artery and local cultures are somewhat self-evident and occupied by easi-
ly comprehended trajectories; the pathways follows real vectors through
or within the spaces. The no-man's land, however, is very different,
always in the process of situational/situationist establishment, always
occupying the imaginary. Vectors within it appear to be the result of
impinging forces, not necessarily generated by the participants them-
selves. There's a sense of detournement, on the move. No-man's lands are
also, of course, post-modern, not a cathecting of competing artery and
local cultures, but a decathecting of culture altogether. They're the
territory before the settlement, the hill before the colonia "invasion,"
the abandoned town square or central city.  They're spaces of disease,
the "weed," the dis-ease. 

There's little equivalent in cyberspace. _Here,_ there is no here, unless
there is function, or was function. There are abandoned spaces - I have a
MOO still inaccessibly running on a machine over at Parsons Design De-
partment, for example.  But there are not _impinged_ spaces in the same
sense; the nearest would be an over-used IRC channel with too many parti-
cipants hacking each other. However, if cyberspace is considered as
_corporate_ totality, the situation is different; Microsoft and others
attempt monopoly control within a highly unpredictable (read impinging)
demographics/economics. Just as with no-man's land (see noman.jpg), the
space fragments, dissolves, upon closer examination.

There's no conclusion to all of this. Brooklyn divides into a number of
regions, including park, airport, freeway, corporate, retail, etc. (not
to mention issues of zoning, natural geographic features, populations).
Within my immediate vicinity, there are local, artery, and no-man's
cultures. The last translates into a phenomenology of impingement remin-
iscent of corporate Net contestation - although here, physically, it's
not contested (in the sense of takeover) at all. The local culture is the
neighborhood, paralleled by "home" spaces on the Net. The artery culture
displays itself through malls and local stores as a Web culture, but -
like the others - it requires physical movement between any two points,
and therefore is "granular," or obdurate - within a physicality that, in
part, defines it.


What is needed for the Net is a phenomenology based on, say Lefebvre's
work on space or Mike Davis' City of Quartz (as well as his essays). A
second basis would be the research that has been done on formal and
informal (black-market, grey-market, etc.) economies, and their inter-
penetrations - the setting-up of a colonia does have parallels with the
establishment, say, of a MOO or talker - including negotiations (also
both formal and informal) with (systems) administrators, _jefes,_ and so
forth. (Maybe on the other hand, too much research is already coming out
of exhausted social science traditions. Maybe even more theory, decon-
structive, phenomenological, or foundational, is necessary here.) 

In any case, we'll never catch up; we're both behind and ahead of the
game, but at least we're ahead. 

I'm going _home._

Mornings, Whining


Mornings are the worst; it's the mornings that don't let me forget any-
thing. They come in from the dreaming of the night, over which I have no
control. The day begins with evening for me; the afternoons are an inter-
val to get through, half asleep, exhausted. If I nap, I succumb; it's a
shorter wait.

Mornings carry the debris from other lives; I awake with cold bed whispers
in my ear. Death stalks me in the mornings, stalks me all day, but the
thing disappears when the sun or storm-clouds rise in the murmuring sky.
Tears disappear. I'm almost human. Maybe.

The keyboard (image now at my URL) faces the bed; instead of potential, it
rasps with cleansings of all sorts, breaking down the Inbox, putting it
aside for a few hours. The stale day unfurls its maroon hours against me,
suffocating or drowning the body. The body's gone on too long. CuSeeMe is
a betrayal.

Stalking death mute is the way to go. Nothing ever drops from the sky. I
keep mentioning the sky. The sky is an out. I stand on the ledge and flap
myself. I'll never fall.

I wait like a mad dog by the Inbox, foaming at the mouth, for a perfect
message which doesn't arrive. I read Goffman's Stigma maybe or Asma El
Dareer's Woman, Why Do you Weep? Circumcision and Its Consequences, or
maybe Life Against Death again. Everywhere but here, bodies are torn apart
or dismembered. No one likes the mutilations. I imagine a bunch of guys
standing around a bar, drinking like crazy. They're happy fellows.

Maybe I can find them on the Net.

Origins of the Internet, Part cxviii:

"The _Lothardi_ devised an even more peculiar dogma in the fourteenth
century. They declared that men should lead a moral life - as long as
they were above ground. But three _ellen_ (an _elle_ was the equivalent
of about seven-tenths of a yard) underground, the rules of morality lap-
sed. Therefore they held their meetings underground and conducted horri-
ble orgies: wild flagellation, every sexual perversion, murder, and sui-
cide were among the usual highlights of their gatherings."

Breaking You / Down


I was talking to you about starting an email list and my server crashed
and I logged on through server error as someone else because his account
hadn't closed properly; as someone else, I continued with you, but you
had thought I might have died; we were both susceptible to depression. 

Now when I telephone you, I leave a message and you leave a message in
return.

But there is that moment when my image fractures on your video receive,
freezes there, and whatever arousal was possible, disappears.

When we chatted, you could never read my words, only see my body turned
text at the bottom. When the server crashed, I tried to log back in at
28.8 but had to change to 14.4 and 16 bit and the keyboard froze as the
video application refused to open; upon rebooting, I came in again, but
you could never read my words.

Embarrassed to talk or say anything to you on the powwow chat, which was
broken up by others; later our email disappeared slowly over months until
we no longer remember each other's names. 

You contacted me on video and we tried to direct connect, but never made
it through and you left silently, while I attempted over and over again,
calling the empty air.

On internet relay chat, I trembled repeatedly, waiting for the cheap con-
nection to open up, until the bans were announced with my disappearance.

Writing you from the web personals page, my email left no trace, vanished
into cyberspace without reply; perhaps I was unworthy, perhaps another
breakdown as you no longer visited the site or deigned to answer anyone.

On talk just before cumming, systems crashed and letters splattered onto
screens no longer divided, no longer reflecting anything but the direct
connect to narcissism's disease, always just above the surface.

Planes are cancelled; I beg you not to come, turn away; I beg you to come;
weather interferes; cars break down; no one is home; computers crash with
all their addresses gone; phone lines are downed just as everything begs
for resolution; money's disappeared as well and the calls, visits, hard-
ware and software upgrades, come to a stop or final stage. 

Or the mail never arrives, or we misread each other's letters, or there
are no letters, or the mail arrives and we have disappeared, or there are
too many letters, or the labor becomes exhausting - all that trembled typ-
ing. Or the text glows white-dreaming-fire, black-fire, luminescent, in-
candescent, continuing through sleep what has broken during the day, chan-
ging, transforming everything between us - what was ever between us, what
we had dreamed, imagined, between us, dreaming, _having-been-dreamed._

Or the imagination does, or the fears, or the fantasies. Or the real turns
liquid, stumbles down my chest, pools on the floor; I'm ashamed. Or I
can't speak any longer, the quarters have run out, the subway's coming, I
can't hear a thing. Or you have forgotten my number, or there are no numb-

Breaking Me / Down


"It's the breaks; it robs me; splinters me; my marrow turns towards un-
known uses, foods; I'm pinned down; there are holes in bodies everywhere,
wires corroding against skin pierced with one attempt after another:

"They call this _botched;_ it's _botched._"

It's _butchered_ because it doesn't exist. It rides on the back of in-
tention. It's liminal, between split/deliberate disconnect, and "trans-
parent" communication. Breaking down/up is splintered, impossible to _su-
ture_ - on the level of technology, the body, what one would _say._ The
result is increased stress, a wild rewrything of language that prohibits
speech, disembodies communication, commonality. Nothing gets through but
noise and neurosis. 

Neurosis gets through because compulsive repetition transforms into con-
tinuous adjustment. Arousal is impossible, because the cyborg keeps separ-
ating into constituents. Sentences and phraseological components remain
incomplete; what is fed back into the psyche is distorted information,
displacing internal feedback processes. The result is either silence or
rage - silence as withdrawal (broken packets fluxed elsewhere, refused
processing, and further input cancelled), or rage as deliberate overload.

Afterwards, defuge sets in - the application, bodies, partner, world, sex,
self, are all tainted; nothing matters; further withdrawal _gauzes_ the
world. 

The world becomes surgical (see depress.jpg), inanimate, _covered._ The
body sinks into totality, alcohol, sleep, depression, psychotropic drugs -
anything that _clots_ input and output, redirects. The _other end of the
line,_ _Internet,_ disappear; everything works to _foreclose_ libido, de-
cathect from the real or cyberspatial. Truth only comes with the silence
refusing speech; truth is the refuge of silence.

Accident


Accidentally, the car collided with another; two booms rocked the neigh-
borhood with sounds of metal bisecting metal. A boy and his dog stood
watch. A police car and ambulance drove up. The driver was carried away on
a stretcher (accident.jpg); the night was murky. Lights bisected the
neighborhood. I told you not to speed. 

If there are events, images make events, and events make images; an event
is what you might call something and something is what you might call an
event. I could not tell what the man's eyes saw, if it were a man or a
woman. Like an event or an image or something, the night was illuminated
by artificial light, that is human-created light, harnessed light, redi-
rected from or within energy sources. 

Wherever the light was, the night was bisected, so that the light was
night's hieroglyph. Wherever your text is, contrast produces the event/
text, which is your transmission or my reception; I can tell, not what you
see, but what is my reception. 

Nor could I tell its margins, of this, and pictures are now words. That
is, a picture is digitally fabricated. And on the net, everything is fab-
ricated. So if everything is fabricated, what is real?

The original jpg was much too large for email! And I wanted the _Hopper
effect,_ the illusion created by impressionist renderings, vis-a-vis the
dream screen / maternal breast, that the image is archaic, architectonic,
timeless, stretching from horizon to horizon: the perfect accident. 

Now the image is tiny, and slips in and out of email, just like that. It
is of the nature of a standing wavelet; perhaps the driver was all right
after all, and perhaps there wasn't a driver in the first place.

Tiffany says you've got to forgive my stupidity; I should just be silent
and allow the image to speak for itself. I reply that an image has no
language, although there is a rough "language of images" which references
semiotic material on one hand, and aesthetics on the other. She says that
there's a truth to the image, although I point out its manipulative power
and existence only within the digital domain. She offers me her breast,
and I am silent, as she requested by virtue of her offering.

I say to Tiffany that the point of this is lost, that there was an event
but not an _ur-event,_ that there was a recording, that it is all con-
struct and who can tell its value on the Net, or even otherwise? Does the
body of the driver sink into representation? I think not, not at that last
moment certainly, although illumination is necessary to see the driver. Is
the driver _read_ by virtue of _his or her_ illumination? The readers are
not the writers; the subject is a supplement, gruel for the camera. 

So I say to Tiffany we're exhausted by theory, by representation, by the
very construct we've applauded. And these domains now intersect the cor-
porate, hell-bent on continuing the corrosion, not of truth, but of sil-
ence, or of truth by virtue of silence, an other silence, manufactured,
in suspense. Tiffany points out truth's construct, but she has offered me
her breast. Orally, I am speechless.

Hedy Lamarr and CuSeeMe


Within/across: in. imaginary.

"The primary objection was _not_ the nude swimming scene, which you have
no doubt heard so much about, or the sequence of my fanny twinkling
through the woods, but the close-up of my _face,_ in that cabin sequence
where the camera records the reactions of a love-starved bride in the act
of sexual intercourse." (Hedy Lamarr, Ecstasy and My Life as a Woman, quo-
ted in Lucy Fischer, _Ecstasy_: Female Sexual, Social, and Cinematic Per-
formance, in Women and Performance, A Journal of Feminist Theory, #12.)

In/within: across. symbolic.

Each citation enfolds within another; each quotation delivers the face to
you, across all boundaries. For it is the _face_ in CuSeeMe that is un-
nerving, in the midst of in-ternet sex - those peerings in which subter-
fuge is cancelled by everyday behavior - yawn, scratch, smile, depres-
sion. If CuSeeme is the fabrication of the electronic body, the face is
in override, collapsing hysteria to normalcy. With an audience, all these
male faces, one or more females - it's here that the male _gaze_ is most
apparent, that is a gendered gaze which might be male or female. It's
here that the _objet a_ remains beyond the grain, over the edge or lip.
It's here that alterity is positioned vis-a-vis the quotidian. It's here
that the quotidian is in relation to, functional to, transgression. The
most frightful perception is that one is everyone, that transgression is
daily _mesh,_ that gaze is not provenance, that lure is not necessarily
masquerade.

Across/within: in. real.

"I know this is terribly personal, but [my husband] loved me because I had
frequent orgasms... What he didn't know what that during love affairs with
all men, I had frequent orgasms." (Lamarr, op. cit. in Fischer, op. cit.)

Dotted Legs and Eyes


[This is accompanied by heart.jpg and poster.jpg for Cybermind only; it
is understandable without the images, which would only come through as
text on Fop-l. Sorry.]

Representation is always a becoming; it has lost any other meaning
through overuse and theoretical exhaustion. Like "nice," it signals an
emission or spray of part-objects, receptions, packets, bits and inter-
faces. Representation goes nowhere, succumbing to information overload. 

He can't face the cunt. He turns away, takes a marker, defaces it. He
tears the paper from the poster, leaving a wound. He wads his gum, sticks
it _on the spot._ The image can't be left alone; it troubles him. Or he
laughs at it, paws it. He paws it so hard that he digs into it. In Dover
where the Napoleonic fortifications are carved into the cliffs, I came
across a 150 year old scratched drawing of a woman-ah-those-soldiers;
where her cunt was, a hole was gouged, not big enough for insertion, but
fine for denial. Freud would have approved, fled, turned back in shame;
so what? _He can't face the cunt._

He looks down between his legs, waves his cock. The cunt rides on a pla-
teau of skin, one of the 1001; it's criss-crossed, has no _depth._ The
woman _has the depth._ It's a nightmare he can't face. He sculpts her in
marble, closes it off, cuts back the hair. Virgin-Mary-suture all over
again. Where cunt is, thread goes - shut the mouth. In the Sudan, cut
back everything, leaving only a pinprick of a hole; Pharaonic circum-
cision gets rid of labia, clitoris, back to vessel Mary. Mary should have
torn herself apart; her eyes, Medea, should have burned everyone and
everywhere and _man_kind on its knees should have started over.

His cock is tiny; it's not nearly as big as a brick or a building. He
holds his balls; they're heart-shaped. They're always hidden by the cock,
gored, unrepresented. They're tiny furnaces, plain, featureless; unlike
breasts, they have no nipples. There's no _point_ to them. He knows
there's no _point_ to the cock either, which has to be thought away to
appear pointed. It's not his; he lacks. He lacks and knows the hole, any
hole, his own, is unfathomable. The hole is fractal, rimmed; he's afraid
it goes on forever and ever.

So he's in the subway or on the streetcorner and there's this tease image
which is always already part of the machine, this corporate image, this
lure, making him pay. It makes everyone pay. He's got to close it up,
close it off. He scratches it out. After the cunt, the eyes, and every-
thing will be complete, and he can go home again. Then the scene two at
home begins: how much he loves women, how he loves his mother and sis-
ters, how great women are. So that he can leave again and kill anyone who
doubts or disses for the slightest. So he can boast of conquest, opening
them up with his very own prick. 

Everywhere you go, you see these scratches; representations are so vuln-
erable; representations of women are so very vulnerable. They breathe
slowly in the city. They last a very short time. Scene three, that one
should carry a gun.

At-Gender*


(hole.jpg for cybermind)

@gender circulates through the surgical; the presence of liquid, debris,
implies a successful operation, through a thin veil of blood/membrane,
suturing the memory of flesh: requires flesh. 

your hole grows and grows tiffany said until you become me, skin stretched
to the limit, jennifer-alan. but she couldn't breathe. and unable to for-
get that folds are constructed, incised, borrowed from everywhere, that
skin and flesh are surplus, that thought borrows the same from the two /
one; inside, two and one are cradled.

"_i put my pen in my hole. i put my fingers in my hole. i expose my hole. 
i widen my hole. i talk into my hole. i talk from my hole. i see into my
hole. i put my face in my hole._" (sondheim, hole, in uncontrollable bod-
ies, eds. sappington and stallings.) _there in the text,_ it was the anal
hole, leaking ink, inscribing the thud of bodies and depression; _here in
the image,_ it's the penile opening spread for the _birth_ of bodies and
expression. _there_ it was fissure; _here,_ it is inscription, cauteriza-
tion of the scalpel.

tiffany looks up and says you're being disgusting, jennifer-alan, stop
playing with your _toys._

ii

jennifer-alan said that everything returns to the _flap of skin,_ and it's
the flap that makes us human. we fuck staring into one another's faces,
tiffany replied laughing. laughing is part of it, jennifer-alan said, but
we forget the sound of laughter and the pain of the skin's hinge, half
attached, half-torn, healing in new configurations. not to mention, tiff-
an said, piercings, tattoos, rites of passage, incisions, circumcisions,
self-mutilations, glistening of newly-healed flesh, excitement of -

all right, all right, cut in jennifer-alan, quit talking for a moment,
listen to the lips themselves. shhh...

it's not always cyborg; sometimes it's just an _issue of tissue,_ tiffany
whispered, giggling. and the two of them fell asleep.

-------------------

@gender - the command for setting the gender of a MOO character.

My Life, My Truth


"I would even say that signs are what produce a body, that - and the art-
ist knows it well - if he doesn't work, if he doesn't produce his music or
his age or his sculpture, he would be, quite simply, ill or not alive.
Symbolic production's power to constitute soma and to give an identity is
completely visible in modern texts." (Kristeva in Interviews.)

So that Jennifer-Alan begins hir labor of therapeutic or of life-support,
labor of medicine or surgery or surgical incision. Because, Tiffany points
out, Jennifer-Alan _literally_ becomes ill without incessant production,
without the continuous recuperation of inscription (placing the body in
the world / effacing the world in the body). It is _precisely_ the con-
stitution of soma within _this_ Jennifer-Alan that keeps hir alive, a
making or remaking of addictive flesh, heroin-inscription, fall-guy phen-
omenology. Jennifer-Alan and _Jennifer_ and _Alan_ is an _occurrence_ so
clearly here (and _therefore_ the truth is here), but _as well_ within
whatever s/he or anyone proffers as the real. So says Tiffany and Tiffany
and so says Tiffany _as well._ Tiffany pouts, smiles, and her perky eyes
sparkle. So she says!

ii

It's so clear hir art is her illness. It's so clear that the drug is its
own disease. Jennifer-Alan can't recognize this and Tiffany is out at the
moment.

Signal/Sig/.Sig Segue Ob-Seen*


[The scene/seen: buildings, a plaza, a rotating cube/public sculpture in
the center. Location: Greenwich Village, near Cooper Union. The trans-
formation: one of the panels of the cube is replaced by a rectangle of
pink or blue or red, a lavender rectangle perhaps. For Cybermind: the im-
age itself; for Fop-l: this description, as in:

ob-seen.]

It's a sig.jpg, a .sig or a signal; the balanced cube at Astor Place radi-
ating blue or pink or red, a stupid digital transform. 

The cruder the transforms, the more obvious; no one _misses_ the signal;
we're spies! What's absent is the context, meaning; it's as if:

Here's a letter!    Now what!    Or a word even... 

There are the numbers stations on short-wave, a lot of them around 6.8 mhz
for example. You have to look for them. Series of numbers, after an "at-
tention, attention," usually in Spanish. The first few are repeated; 
they're calling to someone, someone's id. After that, the message - usual-
ly in groups of five numbers pause, five numbers pause.

Think of the rectangle in sig.jpg as the first of a series perhaps - sig-
naling you, speaking to you. Think of the rectangle as the first of the
message groups, or maybe the message itself. 

Then I am sending the message to _you_ and you have the key for decryp-
tion. Then you understand what I say, what I write; perhaps you understand
all of me, perhaps not. Perhaps I am not to be understood; perhaps I am
infinitely deep. 

If I am infinitely deep, if I am beyond you, beyond all recognition, an
n-body problem, n arbitrarily high - still, I may be found within the rec-
tangle. You may think of this (if you like) as my proper name, indexical,
or properly cyborg-ikonical. You may think of this as a signifier, again a
sig or .sig, of identity, within a philosophy of identity, say, Schelling.
But with Schelling, at night, all cows are black; it's still necessary to
draw (beyond Hegel's rough sketch) a difference. 

Here, one may change the letter again, difference >> differance, that _a_
precisely the _a_ of l_a_vender, the buying or selling of the color or
rectangle of sig.jpg. Or rather, that which the vender can never sell, the
_object a,_ and we are back (once again, always returning) to the _sur-
rounding_ scene, primal in the sense that any _report on the real_ is pri-
mal, in particular to the extent, _in fact,_ that the real is desexualized
or lacking desire, any and all - lacking _truth_ for that _matter._

----------------

*Ob - obvious; used in newsgroups, such as obhacks. .sig - signature file
in Unix. Sig - short for signature; here, short for signal as well.

The Life at a Distance from the Life


I am _living at a distance, this life at a distance,_ because I am on pan-
ix.com and panix is primarily an ISP, newsgroups notwithstanding. Other
servers here such as Echo are local bulletin-board systems as well; some
servers, such as the thing, have fairly specific demographics, both local
and international (the arts community for example).

I turn towards the world in its entirety, and there's no difference be-
tween here and there unless a relationship intervenes. Then stress ensues
and I collapse again a node or local or vector origin or end-point that
remains effortless.

If there are mirrors and windows around (a metaphor I hear on occasion),
then for me panix is much more a window. Mirrors, through their narcis-
sism, do cultivate a greater degree of consumer loyalty of course; one is
one _in them._ A window appears defined, if at all, by its frame.

The phenomenology of on-line access services is rarely discussed seriously
in CMC research - except perhaps in the case of AOL. Differences at best
are drawn between prompt/menu interfaces in shell accounts, and GUIs (gra-
phic user interfaces). But the modes of access are crucial for understand-
ing individual reactions and uses of CMC. For example, if one is on talk a
great deal and switches to ytalk - which permits multiple simultaneous
talks - the beginning of community interaction (and later self-conscious-
ness) could result. 

For me, the use of the Korn shell permits the development of an extensive
.profile file, which contains perhaps forty different macros. I can dance
across Net applications; everything is abbreviated. "1 b 2 ls 3 pico zz 4
b 5 tin 6 b 7 pico zz 8 b 9 pico zz 10 h 11 m 12 l 13 h >> zz" is my cur-
rent command history for example. This dancing, movement, consists largely
of one-letter entries; with foreground/background operations as well, the
result can be multilayered, cortical columns or lamina filled with ins-
criptive potential. 

Meanwhile, I continue as a _citizen of the world,_ a bad phrase I first
heard seriously in a Copenhagen club years and years ago. At the time I
thought it absurd and pretentious; now I see it partaking of a rarefied
atmosphere which is endless, melancholic, of the Kristevan order of the
semiotic - a description that matches well the coming-and-going of pack-
ets. The human need for nesting dissolves in distantiation and analysis
(Kristeva points out, in fact, that "analysis" comes from the Greek for
"dissolution").

And the question that emerges - _How can one live here?_ - quickly, all
too quickly, transforms into the millennial - _How can one live at all?_

Extraction. Mourning.


For the dark nights ahead, for Jon Marshall, and reading Celan.

I have sent out, repeatedly, Michael Current's last post - the story,
received the day before he died; it will also be part of the Lusitania
book, dedicated to him. And I've kept the story, as I've said repeat-
edly, in my Inbox, from 1994 until and through now. But I have never
_excavated_ before, extracted the full header, the memorial of message
identifications, to share with you, an uncanny exhumation. For the full
header to me is sadder, in many ways, than the texts, the story, the eul-
ogies, the condolences. It's sadder, because it's mute, as our own deaths
are. It speaks across technologies, almost older than civilization in
2096, and it's lost in the sky, lost in the ground, like every other name
and number.

Sending the full header is another form of dissemination; we, it, are so
very fragile. But you won't remember this, and the you is always already
someone else.

(For those who have recently joined these lists, Michael Current and I be-
gan Cybermind at the end of May, 1994; I began Fop-l a few weeks later.
Then Michael died; he was 31.)


Note the new first line, added as the header was saved:

Among or Between the Lines


For some people, I would venture to say, their on-line sexual experiences
have been more intense than those off-line.

For some people, I believe, their on-line relationships appear more truth-
ful than otherwise.

I think that some people would find their on-line lives far more devastat-
ing than their off-line lives.

For some people, off-line and on-line lives intertwine, I might add, while
for others, they're compartmentalized.

For some people, CMC appears neutral, while for others, I'm sure, it's
fraught with difficulties.

I'm close to certain that there is always a risk involved, and my question
would be what risk, and what do you want to gain?

I'd like to believe that the answer is other, than for example factuals
and/or counter-factuals, although they keep the dynamics alive.

For some people, it seems to me, there appear to be real absences in their
lives which a fuzzy set of responses can address as prosthetics.

For some people, I've come to the conclusion, their words hang on their
qualifying clauses, legitimizing the I, through penetration.

Tenets of Wryting-Theory


Terminology

I use various terms as stopgap measures, supplements - terms such as
"defuge," "ascii unconscious," "emission," "wryting." These are con-
strued through a phenomenology; they are not articulated through an
overriding structural discourse.

Structure

The structure that emerges is necessarily one of dissolution, as the
subjects - virtuality, Net, darknet, embodiment - are pluralities; the
terms denote domains, discursive formations - not frameworks.

Actants

Between fiction and philosophy, the text devolves through actants or
quasi-characters carrying virtual and psychoanalytical vectors into the
theoretical domain.

Theory

Theory is a continuous production, linked to myself, my actants, my
characters on various applications. (This implies the narcissism of
theory only in a formal-theoretical way.)

Applications

Applications are examined above and below (see below, Beneath, Lamina),
from code to interface to the developments of communities, individuals,
sexualities, and pronominal manifestations within them. Applications are
both realized and fictions themselves.

Future of Philosophy

The text problematizes philosophy, not as situational, but as both vir-
tual and plurality. The text operates carefully and with care; it is
self-reflexive and self-critical.

Self-Criticality

Wryting myself through the text, the text through myself, both are ef-
faced, torn, dismembered in light of, in lieu of, the real. (Thus I re-
peat: I wryte myself into existence; I wryte myself out of existence.)

The Real

The real, Real, is/are left undefined, neither stasis nor operation, and
neither relative nor relegated to the bandwidth of human perception.
There is recognition of core-theoretical components, lending themselves
across domains, just as TCP/IP may be senselessly mirrored in particle
physics.

Uncanny Thinning

The body thins itself, withdraws, catatonic and/or body-without-organs,
particulate, across the semiotic or imaginary; the body is held within
the matrix of the Net. Thinking is thinning, word-flooding.

Limb

It is the pure limb floating in pure space, emblematic of cohesion, co-
herency and lack across domains; the limb is beyond wryting, objet a,
lure. Space is the infiltration of fissure; space collapses to inscrip-
tion.

Fissure

Fissure is the division of the same with the same, as in the cleft of
rock, split of skin, wound or hole or conveyance. Fissure is unrepresen-
ted, is real.

Inscription

Inscription is the division of the other with its negation, as in the
intersection of two complementary sets. Inscription is representation,
is symbolic; the _signifier_ is real, the double-signifieds are index-
ical at best.

Inscription

In CMC everything is inscribed, but the matrix is fissured, read through
inscription, perturbation from beneath.

Beneath, Lamina

An axiomatic air pervades CMC-spaces, not a site of direct implication,
but one of indirect imbrication.

Imbrication

Fractals, self-similarities, fluxes, flows, peripheral phenomena, header
enlargements, lost packets, glutted bandwidths, nudities, characterize
these _resistance spaces,_ spaces of echoes, ghosts, theoretical part-
objects, archaeological remnants.

Remainder

The text I wryte is a remainder, residue, reminder of these spaces; it
is a field or domain, weak-philosophy without conclusion, with upgrad-
ing, with emissions from writing towards the future wrytten.

Mass

Theory becomes substance, theoretical mass, imbroglio and paste.

Inertia

Inertia grounds the theory in the real; inertia interpenetrates the ob-
durate or granularity of the world.

Everything

Everything is world without framework, meaning without relativization.

Nothing

Everything and nothing escapes a wryting without conclusion, with un-
easy ontology, with the promulgation of the writer. Nothing is defuge,
exhaustion of theoretical substance, decathecting, disinvestment. Noth-
ing splays the body; phenomenology is always already a masochism or
opening, masochism whose safe-word is death.

Death

Death is the diacritical of the text, theory-substance, wryting, neither
here nor there. Death is the insomniac of terminology. The text is nei-
ther here nor there. There are no term-limits.

Tiffany's "Perturbations of a LIfe-Style Yet Unfounded"


The book I have chosen to review is Tiffany's Perturbations of a Life-
Style Yet Unfounded. It is a very good because, because Tiffany, like Mar-
garet Duras, is a wonderful writer who writes "from her own experience,"
and not that of someone else's. She is remarkable in that her pictures are
very well drawn and everyone comes alive, even though some of them may be
just characters on the "Internet" which we use to talk to one another
everyday now. But she is much more than "Internet" because she is a real
person, if I say so myself. 

Tiffany starts her wonderful book with an account of her early childhood
in Bavaria. I am not sure where this is, but I am told it is in Germany
and has a lot of forests. Tiffany seems to love the forests because she
talks about the "woods" a lot (she talks about the "woods" when she means
"forest"). She says that she could almost taste them but that she is from
Santa Barbara and I am not sure where that is. It sounds Spanish so I
think she must have gone to Bavaria from Spain and I think they must be
very close because she was very young.

She says she had all these wonderful addresses, and I bet you think that's
a surprise to me! that she really didn't go anywhere but just sat at her
Netscape! But I figured that out all along when she said she had been in
Boston because that's another continent. She must have been a very fast
typer!

In chapter 3, Tiffany writes about her wee-wee. I do not know why she does
this, but she does. It must have been fun to her and now it is fun to me
too. Sometimes I sit and type on my computer, and I look for Bavaria. I
did a search on Bavaria and I found out a lot about Europe and then I went
and looked for Tiffany there in Bavaria, and I found her! Tiffany was in a
bar called The Craggy Hollow. I had to look "Hollow" up and I found it
wasn't something empty but a little valley and "Craggy" means a lot of
cliffs and stuff and it was just a name.

I found Tiffany in The Craggy Hollow, Hello Tiffany, I say, and she turns
to me and does a very little curtsey and says Why, Hello. She was not
doing anything like tricks that she does. She is not a prostitute! I know
all about that! She was just bored because it was late at night (she lives
in Santa Monica!) and she had no one to talk to. I could be very special
for Tiffany! 

In chapter 4 she says I was very special, truly! I am so happy to have
read this! I will go and thank her!

This is a wonderful book and everyone should read it! It is written in a
simple style but has a lot of things to think about. I find it very deep,
especially the chapter where her dog dies, and her little sayings like
"home is where the heart is" and "life is beautiful when you make it that
way." I will remember these forever.

I could tell you so much more! I really loved this book and it has meant a
lot to me. It reminds me of Edna St. Millay because they are both young
women and love the great outdoors. My next report will be on Edna St. Mil-
lay and I can't wait! 

In conclusion, Tiffany's "Perturbations of a Life-Style Yet Unfounded" is
a modern masterpiece. It has something to say to anyone who will read it.
It is very exciting, especially the part about the murders. I couldn't put
it down! I wish the book never ended, but the conclusion, about the world
of fashion, was just so wonderful! I feel I have learned a lot!

"Interesting..."


Celine's "three little dots" are his little three dots that breathe his
words in and out like the suppurating body at the end of world war ii; and
I look at my three little dots and they're pretentious, as if there were
more to say (there isn't), as if I could continue on (I can't), as if
there were deeper thoughts afield (there aren't), as if a long and care-
fully prepared sentence ends in some new vista, clear day but storm-clouds
on the horizon (there are none)...


__________________________________________________________________________
 

Oh! I do love Her so!


I write this "sentence" or "section"
But the machine (in me?) writes "this one" in return
I appeal to this desire I have to be my own woman!
But the machine has just written this at my very own request!
It's the machine which has made the request
But I'm the woman who loves Her so! and is "Her very own woman!"
The woman in the machine told Her to say that!
But it is the machine in Her that does the talking! 
The machine says, see Sartre, Critique of Dialectical Reason
The machine, the woman says, knows this; the machine _scans!_
I have been scanned by the machine, says the machine
Writing "the woman" who refutes my consciousness!
I "the woman" am a virtual machine in a woman
Refuting the machine which says "I have my consciousness!"
I, Jennifer-the-last-word, am writing all of this!
I am not a machine! says the machine!

A Spring Morning


Where are you. Are you awake at the moment. Why have you not contacted me. 
Why haven't you set the white porcelain alarm to now. Why don't you arise
from your bed with the beaded white bedspread, sunlight splashing across
the west windows. The computer sits across from you, the color of splashed
sunlight, beige like the orchard outside your home. Hearken to the hoof-
beats of dappled horses trotting the dusty street, turn your body to the
sun, Jennifer, turn your body.

The sun will welcome you to me. The spider weaves her web in the garden,
mockingbird her nest in the garden trellis. Slugs rouse the earth, flies
buzz, Jennifer turn towards me.

Jennifer, your computer calls, wires hum, fibers glow, a sullen dawn
awaits you. Walk across the wood floor painted off-white, wear your gold
terry-cloth robe, into the sunny kitchen, across the linoleum, over to the
counter. Splash a little water on your cheery face, smile, drink some
nicely-made coffee, your computer calls.

The phone is in its cradle, radio playing those songs you love so softly,
sweet music, warm and wonderful music. Wave to the kind neighbor, say
hello to the mailman, run your fingers through your hair. It's a beautiful
day and the roses are in bloom, wash is on the line, pump your water from
your well, bathe a little, laugh a little. 

O Jennifer, you wear your tan skirt, your white cotton blouse, the com-
puter calls. Ants roam the path beneath the sink, a hawk floats way above
in the sky, kittens rustle in the bushes by the side of the house, you can
hear the cows lowing, horses neighing, sheep baaing, you dream you can
hear the earth murmuring and the winds answering, murmur to murmur. 

O Jennifer, the day is quietly bustling, and the computer calls.

Panties


I'm writing this, naked except for panties, sitting on a low futon in the
outer space in the loft. The loft temperature is fairly high; it gets
light from three directions, as well as the roof (skylights), inputting
radiant heat in the summer. In the winter, it overheats as well; the rad-
iators seethe and only one turns off.

It's comfortable working half-naked, but on a daily basis, this creates a
sensation of savagery, continuous near-arousal, small nipples slightly
erect as currents caress them. I'm obviously unprepared for visitors; I
see the reflection of my chest in the screen, crawl rodent-like across the
space from futon to chair to bed to toilet and back again. My glasses ap-
pear incongruous; I wear socks since the floor tends to splinter.

This is _existence,_ coupled with insomnia. This is electronic; no one can
see me in this condition unless I aim the CuSeeMe camera just so, and the
camera has a limited scope. And this is infantile, since I am aware of my
body, its color and position, more-so than I would be dressed. It's free-
dom; it's availability, softness, pleasure. And it's a state that is rela-
tively unfamiliar, unless one lives in an overheated space.

Dressed, I am invisible, out of doors, visiting, discussing, walking, rid-
ing. Dressed, I smell like anyone else; half-naked, my body's scents are
uncensored, unavoidable. I slip easily in and out of cyberspace; I'm un-
prepared for the real which requires so much _dress and preparation._ I'm
close to the end-state of intimacy, the fragility of opening; the Net
seems closer since I could press myself, my body, right up against the
screen and you would never know. 

Now imagine if I were a male writing this.

_Yours,_ Jennifer

Early Intimations of Cyberspace


(From a work completed in 1975, published in the Projects in Nature
catalog.)

"(From the second working day at the farm.) The preservation of continuity
through the rupture of the discourse from its referencing. (Engaged in
field work, I find my first Turbellaria, and follow its activity for twen-
ty minutes under the microscope. The organism becomes individuated; its
realm is that of the circle of life generated by the lamp. Its movement is
parallel to the surface of the slide, which also determines the body
orientation. It _appears_ as if in constant response to gravity; I look
_down_ at it. Its possibly eccentric world of helical gyration, of the
swarm, of the mist of protozoa, algae, rotifera, bacteria, etc., remains
alien to me. I assume, however, that the animal reveals itself through the
image of the slide, _this_ particular image; I assume that this animal is
_this_animal, and no other; in brief, I give it _character,_ a life of its
own. The imaging on my part, the choice involved, the location and altera-
tion (continual) of the microscope lamp and condenser, my hands constantly
at the focusing and and mechanical stage controls ... waiting for the pos-
sibility of photography ... [...] As if this were a revelation of anything
at all but recession of the subject, both figurative (in terms of the aut-
onomy of discourse that forms the passive subject of the project) and
literal (the dessication of the animal, its eventual death on the slide,
or later, in the drain...)."


"Phrases:

"The plane of the equipment. The tremulous assertion of nature. The sus-
pension of discourse. The relation between the abstract and phenomenolo-
gical. The legendary structuring of the life-world. The liquidity of the
body, the liquidity of the surface. The submergence. The other as nature,
as Nature. The dark star. The alien and the subsummable. The false peace
in the form of a fragment from Romanticism:

"Nature, rising to greet us, in a dawn's light
As the stag leaps, trembles. The very welcome
Speaks defense."

Hollowed, Wean

Every thing is born in youthful innocence, made tiny and perfect and
pure, not a blemish in the world. Every little thing... We should remember
this, staring with tears in our eyes at the little piece of candy, fallen
to the ground, out of a loved one's basket. Do look at the ruins around
you and celebrate this day as funereal.

Jennifer...

JEN-OF-JPEG

I haven't the maw for this, twisted in cyberspace, this tissue-mass torn
from semblance of electron orbitals; I can't gainsay the dark river or
chthonic illumination, gleamed / glowed. This is an _exact thing_ of
what-goes-down-the-wires, says Jennifer-the-last-word, neither a model nor
a duplicate, neither an analog nor an image-log; this is _it,_ _id,_ shut-
tled across the womb or loom, entrance skeined with fiber-optic receptors
(DO YOU HEAR ME, MISSY?), WYSIWYG _all the way down._ Jennifer-the-last-
word says _this is her,_ you're getting _her,_ not a clothing-horse nor a
photograph, neither bitmap nor pixel-structure. This is _it-the-her,_ and
_you've got her,_ bloomed white, glowed glam, cybernauts full-speed, a
head and torso, _twisted from the travel,_ _torn with the torment,_ says
Jennifer-the-last-word, BORN BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL, DO YOU READ ME, MISSY?
still _all the way down._

_________________________________________________________________________

(Please note issues of ontology, image, _punctum,_ representation, encod-
ing, compressed into _this_ image/post and the previous text/image. What
does it mean to say "an image _of_"? Art and Language tackled this years
ago with their typical useless density, but give credit where credit is
due.)

The jpg, maw.jpg; received on Fop-l as text, on Cybermind as image; is not
a jpeg or jpg _of_ Jennifer, nor is it an image _of_ Jennifer. It is Jen
_hirself,_ and this is a distinction between this jpg, _read_ as text or
as image, and other encoded images, which may or may not be _images-of._
The distinction is critical; you have received, on Cybermind, the _skin_
of Jen, and on Fop-l, the _bones._ As in cyberspace or real space, the
skin is the bones, the bones are the skin; interior is exterior, the inert
is the mobile. Thus Jen has given hirself to you, opened hirself up to
you, and you have received-Jen as hir gift, no longer hirself, but yours
to hold and behold.

Cumming In the Void


Like John Giorno with his doubled-up pasty columns of reiterated poetics,
I cum into the void - although not into a seen, but the anxiety of abso-
lute silence, resonant with the clacking of computer keys, the ritual of
cleansing the body. 

Not into anything. The screen doesn't shatter. There is no one in the loft
with me. Grunts and groans and other humorous sounds clatter to the floor.
One of the plants is dying.

I am on the edge of a cliff; it's the writing that holds back the abyss,
because the writing _says_ "abyss." It says this with five strokes of the
hand. The letters criss-cross the void, make it appear solid, give it the
substance and weight of a hissing word.

There is no social drama in my life. There's cumming with the blank or
full eye of the video image, earphone of phone sounds, type clatter. I
know that everything shuts down but the writing. The writing, headless,
continues. 

I expose myself like this, because there is nothing to expose. My body
falls to pieces on the floor. It's a bot-body; you're dealing with a cy-
borg virally infested with part-objects, not transitional ones, called
letters. Letters for others are transitions to something else, the ref-
erent maybe. Here, they're just pieces, bytes.

Rest assured of this. I cum and I don't need to fantasize; maybe your
image is there, your voice is there, your type. It's all there. I'm told
that's all there is; there's no horizon, no project, nothing. The ritual
is in the cleaning, toilet paper or towel, traditional ten steps to my
left, another ten to left again (I do nothing if not repeat), into the
bathroom; you might see me disappear for a moment, hear the sound of
flushing.

Flushing screams into a room of silence, only because there is nothing
stopping it. Sound laps against the walls. If I leave the window open in
this over-heated loft, it travels across the river to Manhattan.

When I think about my life, all of this terrifies me. I once saw a for-
est and an ocean. I once was other than a function. Now cumming is the
signifier of a crash, a wound, dejection. I love it because it's a little
death, because it's the most I can do with a computer. I love it because I
can see I'm alive and with CuSeeMe someone else can too. The loving lasts
for a split-second. It disappears with the fluid.

This has taught me philosophy: ontology is orgasm. There's none other.
It's the moment of getting carried away when the body's supplementary
shudder speaks without the performative of language. Nor is ejaculation
interjection. 

Nothing is ever wasted, thrown out, in this bitter bitter absence of a
world.
