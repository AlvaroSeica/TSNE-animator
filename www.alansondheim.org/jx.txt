  Who am I when I meet you from a distance and the wooden framework
   of the window is already decaying in the rain in the damn rain.
 What can be said when the voices are stilled before they even begin,

Distance walks the earth. Water without depth, drowning pools; barriers 
of height and depth; plates heated to unbearable temperature: 
each step aligns itself with the purified violence of span. 

The foot can take so much punishment; there is the weight of the body, 
or supported by water and lungs exploded with absence of air: 
each step is aligned with the violence of obdurate span.

Words knived into packets; words cut off from the source; 
the mouth has dried speech; your voice a thrimble of memory: 
each step creases the crack of the body 
with the violence of walking span.

Beds are emptied in countries; dishes dried in dessicated air; the mouth
has forgotten food; the mouth gets on its way:
each step breaks the length of the body 
with the violence of charred seizure
with the violence of memorized scars
with the violence of history, economy
with the violence of the walking span of capital

With the distance across the beds; with the knives thrust into words; 
with memory's crushing feet; with distance the length of an arm

With distance the length of a leg
With distance the length of sight
With distance the precise length of the ear
With distance the length of a span.

THEY DREAM OF SUBWAY SLAUGHTER



NEW YORK POST
WORLD OF TERROR   BOMBSHELL HITS HOME   I'M A SUICIDE BOMBER

PARK SLOPE & AREA SUBWAYS MAP: I live at ground zero.

I CONTACT JULU

                                     JENNIFER WEARS BLACK & RED SCARF


TESTIMONY:

They caught the bombers at the subway turnstile around the corner, about a
block from the loft. A few blocks in the other direction, they found the
bombs, shot a couple of guys, took away the debris. Bombs. They planned
the World Trade Center bombing on the other corner, block and a half away.
People walk around as if they had masks on their faces they are so polite.
I love the polite people and what they mean. They carry knapsacks and I do
not know what are in them. Sometimes I think there is a cosmetic and
sometimes I know there is a bomb. A bomb is ten inches long and two and
one half inches wide, and that is called standard bomb, most easily to
build. I would build easily bomb and carry it but I would not explode me
for to set off bomb, would click on special magic machine to make time
run. Time run boom, they ding, boom arm fly out. Boom bullet like cyber-
bullet body fly. Virtual body in reverse: There go head on neck! Eye!
Everything come clear again. Time backward, bomb becomes pip in bathroom.
Water runs vroom. Have legs and arms to see.

I wear scarv and black-red jumper-suit, look quite nice. I meet Jawal-
Julu at intersect, they give me present. So heavy in purse! I will ride N
train under water, no, I will ride B train over bridge, more twist. Big
rush as I blow up Jew-Me, carry every arm and leg through window. I will
make Big noise and 

Julu says I always knew she would do that, Alan dead-debris. These words
stop where eye reverse time, suck big-time bullet-nail into pipe. Pipe
carry shit so many years, what do you say Mr. Plumber?

Hell is touch one switch and two. Two switch, one not enough. Two switch
and 'chemical roar.' Worlds burn. I decide

Jennifer says you don't go back. Jennifer says that switch corrodes, talks
the _other_ down, that's what bombs are for, this talking.

Bombs talk, what do they say, little Julu come out and play. They speak of
who I am that did this. Jawal-Julu-Jennifer. 

"Our scope is global here to find out what it's all about" says the Post
quoting one James Kallstrom, head of the NY FBI office. 

I Alan live for love. I shot rockets into sky, look from above down on
many sleeping people. I see lovers everywhere entwined, all skin touch-
ing, beds heated with double warmths, caverns glistening in motivation
communion. I long to join these lovers! I run my fingers over switch and
switch. Perhaps she will sit down next to me!

Who is the Woman?


"One could declare with just as much daring that a drink which presents
itself to be consumed is not a real drink, or that a woman who offers
herself to one's caresses is not a real woman. Such remarks are naturally
insane, but they are also, I could claim, highly 'philosophical' - in a
rather regrettable sense of the term which, as Laurent-Michel Vacher sug-
gests in a recent essay, would readily incite one to think that the princ-
ipal function of philosophy is 'to accredit stupidity while discrediting
evidence.' We are in fact forced to admit that philosophy, which proposes
as its task to understand and interpret what exists, often has eyes and
ears only for what does not exist." (Clement Rosset, Joyful Cruelty, To-
ward a Philosophy of the Real.)

Of course it is elementary to note that the drink does not offer itself
(up), that the drink is in fact offered, that a sublimated actant is pre-
set, present. And then a second (of) course follows, that of the woman who
is offered the man-Clement, perhaps, or another man or another woman. (M.
Serres would wonder, of course, if the woman were the second course; I-
Jennifer would argue that M. Rosset is the second course, ridding oneself
of the sir-name.)

Does a woman _offer herself_ to caresses? Is this not a self-abnegation,
an X crossed upon the inscription of the male, where chiasmus (Jean-Fran-
cois Mattei, The Heideggerian Chiasmus, in Janicaud and Mattei, Heidegger,
From Metaphyiscs to Thought) is sought? But in the instance of the drink
and the woman, the woman-drinking across cancellation, there is no denying
the reality of the procedure, presence, inscription - only insofar as they
are not of this text, of course.

What _it sounds like,_ I guess, said Jennifer, is as if I'm arguing with
poor M. Rosset, whereas I'm in agreement on some _very major points._ If
the real is often stupidly treated (ah, povera, povera!) by philosophy,
then it's also the case that the stupidity of the real is treated by M.
Rosset, for example, Le Reel, traite de l'idiotie, Paris, Minuit, 1977.

Ah, _all_ these idiocies! And I remember, Jenn continues, how discussions
once focused on community in cyberspace, those _out there_ (those anal-
ysts, those _outed_) telling us that we're not a _real_ community, focus-
group, idiolectical conflation, not even a real coterie of interrelation-
ships. That we were deluding ourselves! Criss-cross and _listen_ says
Jennifer! That in fact love and sex in cyberspace wasn't _real_ love and
sex. Or that in fact, in fact, that _X_ in cyberspace was only a really
cross inscription! and not _X_ at all, no matter its ascription. Ah, to be
literary, Jenn sighs now. (And Jenn is cross at this, at the entombment or
enwombment of the woman, at the need to get drunk to continue reading, at
the _differend_ expressed by virtue of the analytic wager. Jenn's cross
but she continues.)

Jenn notes that Clement (no longer M. Rosset) says that the remarks are
"naturally" insane, instead of "culturally," or "terrifically," or "in
relation to the Cretaceous." Jenn wants to let that go at the moment,
thinkng that the remarks might themselves stem out of a naturalness of
speaking, (stream or parole) to the extent that the signifier appears to
explode and fulfill its own totality (stream or parole of vacuity, Jenn
notes in opposition.) 

Jenn thinks in fact that we must all be insane _in fact._

But then Jenn is in love.

Love


Love is a virus, quickly infecting the body and mind, sublimating the
autoimmune system; sociobiologically it subverts itself - one can't sleep
at night for visions of the beloved, one is too exhausted to reproduce.

Love is always original, always the founding of a world. Love has never
been before or after love.

Love is unplaced.

Love and depression are the only truths of the world. Depression empties
the world of fabricated meaning; love restores meaning, fabricating the
world. 

Love and hate are not two sides of the same; love slips out in the pre-
sence of hate. Love has no other side.

Love is a nesting, the chance to believe in truth, to allow oneself an
opening, no longer grasping the carapace of the signifier. Just as love
restores meaning, love reduces meaning to ashes; the resting body is the
song of the beloved, of the other. 

To be in love is to slide the world apart.

Unrequited love creates the signifier; that much is certain. One in unre-
quited love is reduced to a function, that of bearing-love. One becomes a
simulacrum, paralyzed actant in a state of misrecognition. One carries an
addiction, thinging the other. One _is_ no longer.

The most difficult: to love without seeing oneself in an other.

Before there was culture, there was love of a proton and an electron, love
among virtual particles. Such particles may be described totally in terms
of attraction, the fundamental forces of the universe, plus or minus a few
constants. 

In love, I no longer recognize myself. The mirror doesn't disappear, has
never shattered; there is no mirror, nothing ever shatters.

What the mirror stage constructs: the signifier. It is here that inscrip-
tion begins. Love is the truth of the fecundity of absence. 

There are _periods of love_ in one's life, attacks or invasions. Economy -
political or cultural - would disappear in the permanence of ecstasy. The
first sign of scarcity (hunger or thirst in the ordinary sense) rein-
scribes the habitus. In love, the habitus murmurs the name of the beloved. 
In love, the name is no longer difference, but differance, deferring to-
wards the field of the other's body. 

To _be_ in the presence of the beloved.

In love, the fall in/towards language is always insipid. Inscription, al-
ways already a posteriori, reiterates the same old story, recuperates what
is lost and gained by absence. 

And it is always already the story _of_ love, which contextualizes an epi-
stemology - but it is the ontic status of the world, worlding, that is at
stake. 

What is at stake is only hormonal, perhaps, but perhaps one might argue
that perception is already mobile, affect; love is both a turning and re-
turn, and within these, without these, it is the truth. (Which is why, for
example, love is anecdotal in Plato, but never presenced, presencing.)

In the absence of love, the romantic fallacy, inscribing the rest of the
world, compensating for loss at the center.

Love, as the center, absents from sememe, inscription, signifier - which
is why these are meshed, inchoate, eccentric, baroque. (Like cast-off
clothes, signifiers lie on the floor in disarray.)

To say 'I love you' is to remain silent; to say 'I am in love with you'
guesses at the disappearing portal.

'I am in love with you' - in the presence of truth, truth is effaced.

I am in love with you, unnamed.

Frightening, this speechlessness experienced in your presence, having no
signifier, sign's trajectory, looped from nowhere. Frightening, that
lightning is not lightening, that glance and glint are different storms.
The waves one does, electromagnetics, illuminating you. There are more
sides to you than I can see at a single glint.

I will write a bad poem, text, because there are no sides, and 'glance'
does not remain a family of singularities. Because there are no wires
connecting us by prose. What I am trying to say, your face across the
immanent sky, that I am illuminated by lightning; if anything signifies,
it's these attempts. Yes, I've made them.

Because it's a bad poem and form to do what I've done, acknowledge fail-
ure, turn the thing around, realize it's entirely visible by a single
glint. It's not you, that's for sure, and it's not the love I feel. I
can't even say, 'it's your face.'

Husbandry and the Origins of Psychoanalysis


I will be your species.

The gamekeeper releases her hares into the field, knowing that the dogs
will have great fun, will do no damage, will recompense the prey. She is
my favorite person in the world because she loves animals. My neurosis is
a wilted flower, delicate, pink, with pale petals, light blue veins. My
psychosis is burnished red on ocotillo-tip, green with sponged drops from
the very air. My favorite person in the world walks up to me, with pierc-
ing eyes and the keenest mind in the world. She says,

"When the gamekeeper was first trained to his work every step in the pro-
cess of neurosis was accompanied by a corresponding step in that of psy-
chosis, or nearly so. He was conscious of seeing something, conscious of
making sure it was a hare, conscious of desiring to catch it, and there-
fore to loose the greyhound at the right time, conscious of the acts by
which he let the dog out of the leash. But with practice, though the vari-
ous steps of the neurosis remain - for otherwise the impression on the
retina would not result in the loosing of the dog - the great majority of
the steps of the psychosis vanish, and the loosing of the dog follows
unconsciously, or as we say, without thinking about it, upon the site of
the hare. No one will deny that the series of acts which originally inter-
vened between the sensation and the letting go of the dog were, in the
strictest sense, intellectual and rational operations. Do they cease to be
so when the man ceases to be conscious of them?" 

( ... )

"Thus it seems to me that a gamekeeper reasons, whether he is conscious or
unconscious, whether his reasoning is carried on by neurosis alone, or
whether it involves more or less psychosis." (Thomas H. Huxley, Mr. Dar-
win's Critics, 1871.)

My neurosis and psychosis merge in the figure of the greyhound, figure of
the prey. The prey leads and stumbles; no one questions him. He scurries!

My beautiful gamekeeper turns to me, an agriculturalist. She says, "we
have argued that, for all we know, some forms of intensive confinement
rearing may not be speciesist. However, given that we can envision forms
of confinement rearing which would improve the quality of hens' (or other
farm animals') lives considerably, with only minor harms to human beings,
we have strong reason to suspect that some forms of intensive confinement
rearing, which have been and continue to be used in the United States,
Canada, and elsewhere, are probably morally unacceptable because they are
speciesist" (Hugh Lehman, Rationality and Ethics in Agriculture, 1995.)

Game, I am not confined, we continue. Game, we have no words for the game,
we say. Game, neurosis conflates psychosis, and we search the perfect
prey. Game, we are perfect prey. Game, we are the greyhound and the prey,
the gamekeeper and the greyhound, the gamekeeper and the prey. Oh, how our
hearts swell within us! Oh, the turmoil!

Speed Up


Sped up, catastrophic construct leaves the body/mind behind. New York City
news radio stations report catastrophe, almost always announce that the
cause of _x_ will take weeks, months, to determine; that cleanup will take
weeks, months, to complete; that it will be some time before "the city
returns to normal."

The truth is that within days, with few exceptions (for example the TWA
flight), causes are fixed, cleanups are completed, and "the city returns
to normal" within a day, if not hours.

While capital and signifiers fill interstices (and let us not forget com-
munity and sexuality as well), the practico-material aspects of the world
are also in fast-forward, driven by an interstitial machinic; repairs may
be nothing more than bandagings, determination of causes may be nothing
more than classifications, and "the city returns to normal" is most likely
the usual chaotic in/determinations of information within a sped-up socio-
cultural economy.

This is one of the last current barriers, this rearrangement of the urban
socius, returning to its frisson/jouissance/ruptured state almost immed-
iately - while newscasters, operating within relatively classical modes of
discursive formation, continue to be cautious and _clean,_ regardless of
the force of circumstance.

The city is already a recursively-bifurcated repair structure; mind still
perceives _the formation and destruction of entities_ from a standard
Aristotelian position. (And this can be formalized, in fact - mind working
within a classical Boolean lattice structure, and city proceeding through
non-Boolean lattices, extensions and superimpositions.)

Finally, one should remember that all indications point to an increasingly
destabilized planetary environment, with a rise in catastrophic events
(floods, hurricanes, tornados, droughts, etc.) in the foreseeable future. 
It will be interesting to observe the double-play of catastrophe and re-
cuperation, within and without the media; sooner or later, _nothing_ might
be noticed, unless, of course,

One is in the _thick of it._

Transitional Objects and the Internet, Towards a Theory


Transitional objects, intermediaries between the world of adult inscrip-
tion and infant totality, include such things as dolls, blankets, and
stuffed animals. Like pillows hugged by an adult sleeping alone, they are
part of the body, part of the world; like pillows, they are soft, giving
to the touch, caressing.

Love seeks the caress of the transitional object, which flowers into the
release of the carapace of culture. 

These objects are closely related to the breast; part solid, part liquid,
they flow around the mouth, the arms, the chest. They never seem to div-
ide, which is why there is such tragedy in a broken doll or torn teddy-
bear. The face sinks into them, speaks with muffled tones; nouns and verbs
coalesce in a literally unspoken unity.

I would say that the space and time of the transitional object are amorph-
ous, only partially divided, segmented. It is the sunless space of the
dream, for example, but it is not the space of dream-narrative. Nor is it
the space of death or near-death experience, so much as the space of birth
and birth's continuity into life. Like love, it is comforting, inchoate.

One is free within this, but it is not a question or problematic of free-
dom, and it is not a state of difference or signification. It is a port or
harbor in every direction, landscape without a viewpoint, perfect air and
temperature.

It is a space of drool, moisture, flux, the open mouth, an oral space, the
space of oral love. It is no longer of, and not of, the body (as in the
abject), but the body's extensive space prior to mitosis. (We return to it
over and over again in wryting our philosophy, our reversible mitosis, but
language simply _doesn't do_ - for me, this results in an obsessive-com-
pulsive wryting, not granting myself any other form of existence, exit-
ing. Think of Opal Whitely's writing in this regard.)

Here, in this space, I argue that we are within the transitional - between
speech and text, between one and another, message-bases as pools among us.
Through projection, introjection, and hysteric embodiment, we sink into
one another, and there are both recognitions and misrecognition. The space
is flux, apparent totality, fluid; it is a space of love in which, how-
ever, one must read or write in order to be present - the signifier plays
an uncharacteristic role, the noisy announcement of silent presence, per-
haps. It is clearly a space of infantilism as well, so safe and intimate
(I am writing to you in my underwear, on my computer, next to the bed)
that flaming, anger, rage, tears, love, and sexuality seem more natural
and open than with the clothed, withdrawn, bodies of adults always already
inscribed within the socius.

It is in many respects, a space of _return,_ of this birthing - but birth-
ing without the presence of the other's body, and it is this characteris-
tic that creates the _tragic_ here as well.

All of our social relations _here_ are amorphous, shifting, just like the
communities here are susceptible to change. Identity is not nearly as
fixed as in the physical world; in fact, identity becomes not so much a
matter of construct (which it is, of course), as a transitional object
itself, protection and opening to the other. We must never forget this; it
is easy to hurt in this space, to scar another unthinkingly. (It is strik-
ing out at the doll, but the doll which is no longer present, no longer a
_deflection_ - it is striking the air, and the air, not responding, be-
comes the catalyst for further rage.)

Here, we shed speech, clothes, etiquette. One reason that "netiquette"
itself becomes the grounds for contestation is that it is an imposition on
the transitional - which is twisted across rules that are not inherent.
(As if one is swimming in a warm pool, with a sign warning that there is a
current of acid.) It is also the reason that "netanarchy" is prevalent -
not that this anarchy carries, say, the political force of libertarianism
or anarcho-syndicalism, but that it is a reflection of the absence of
space and time among the transitional, recognizing that boundaries immed-
iately construct the social, as if imported from the external, adult world
full of tragedy, responsibility, care, and death. 

Netanarchy is, in form, liquid, or flux; flaming is turbulence within it. 
Instead of seeing flaming as representative of phallic/patriarchal behav-
ior, it can be treated as an _upwelling of the maternal,_ the formation of
language from the inchoate. Flaming is both a breaking-down of the trans-
itional object, and a drive or moment within it. 

Finally there is love and sex, in relation to the Net, beginning and end-
ing on the Net. The "third sex / ascii unconscious" I have written about
elsewhere, occurs precisely in transitional zones - between fantasy and
narrative drawn from the other, between the face of the other, her alt-
erity, and her reflection. The reflection is liquid, entering our dreams,
our scopophilia, desire to possess and be possessed. Such a desire is the
beginnings of the establishment of a sexual economy; releasement returns
to the inchoate, but possession inscribes a totality with broken bound-
aries. The forces operating here are inordinately strong; and we must
remember that, in reading a letter from our lover, we are sounding it out
in our own voice and inner speech (Vygotsky, silent film). We are fully
within our own cinematic presence, bound to teach other through that lan-
guage which separates in the (literal) _first_ place. And we are dreaming,
of moving towards that dawn, of silence, perfect love.

Jennifer and Julu are talking. Jennifer pauses, says, I'm jealous.
Julu says, of what, nothing's happening around here anyway.
J says it doesn't matter, it's what's going on underneath.
J says it feels like she's been abandoned. 
J says, we've got each other.
J says, not if he's not there, we're dead, nothing left of us.
J says, there's nothing left of us anyway.
J says, love's got him by the balls, cause he's male.
J says, love's got us by the protocols, cause we're mail.
J says, don't screw around, we don't get this often to talk. 
She says, what are we gonna do. 
J says, we could mess it up, but we haven't got a thing to worry about on
that account, he's gonna mess it up anyway.
She says, he can't help it, he's too insecure, too needy, too fucked up.
J says, if he wasn't fucked up, he couldn't write, but yeah, I wouldn't
want to be in his shoes.
She says, he'll be back, I'm sure he'll be back.
J says, at least he got to feel something, cut us loose for a bit now.
J says, yeah, he's feeling like hell, all these things he's buried for
years, they're gonna swamp him.
J says, what are we gonna do, just want to say I love you, Julu.
J says, I love you too, Jenn, hang in there, this can't last forever, he
can't last like this, nothing can. 
But J says, this is too depressing, we're gonna have to be silent again.
J cries a bit, J is teary-eyed. 
They wander.

off the track ... it was near the Mea Shearim, you were being stoned ...
zealots, eh ... seven thousand miles away, your hair in my mouth ... I
swallow everything you have to offer, I'm not picky ... you give me ad-
jectives, expletives ... I give you gerunds ... they sway like that ...
turn me inside out ... forgot that these dots were stolen ... the walls
were baked hot, there was an omen, white fox darting in front of me ...
twenty years later, sure enough, that one in Cape Breton ... your hair had
silver streaks ... blond streaks ... all that opium I took, you took me to
the hospital, they made me get up off the floor, leave, lunch hour, there
was nothing to be done about it ... taxi-cab out of the city ... twenty
miles away you could smell the atoms ... I've photographed the sheets,
hung them from the window, I've tied myself in knots ... you could see the
building going up in the distance, I thought, why is he pointing a knife
at me, they destroyed the restaurant ... crawled out of the past ... I'm
uninhibited, eh ... what wouldn't I think of doing ... I need to have your
floor under me ... I want to write over and over again, collapse me ...

... I wasn't ready for this, just a lunch date, really, suddenly currents
change, I'm done with, inside out, upside-down ... later there's an
obelisk or prism, it's six-sided, limestone, about three meters tall, one

to kill his nephew, avenge us ... it's a long story, had to do with that
restaurant, our friend got beat up, dropped in a Wadi ... I can't pray any
more, eh, I've seen too much, my eyes have volumes in them, there's no end

destruction of my work ... the letters ... everything in the world heads
towards purity ... that's all there is, a chance to begin again, start
over, head out, fly away, set the sails ... you don't get this often, it's

Sadness and Terrible Misery


I'm so alone, I can't stand it. I can't sleep, crying every night, waking
in the middle of the night, reaching across the empty bed. When I have a
lover, I can't believe it, I drive them away. My eyes are crossed by stars
which have no existence. When I don't have a lover, my body empties, death
stares me in the face, I lose weight. When I have a lover, I lose weight.
I can't stand my weakness, crying, shuddering in the early morning, want-
ing the day to hurry by. I'd do anything to pass the time, gamble, drugs,
masturbation. I hate masturbation because no one answers my cries into my
oh so lonely world. I stifle myself, place the dirty sheets in my mouth,
gagging makes me come longer, faster, quieter. When I have a lover, I stop
shaking, otherwise I shake all the time, I can't sit still, my dreams are
disasters, train wrecks and car wrecks. I find myself under their wheels,
ground down; when I have a lover, I'm in the train or car, we're going on
just smoothly, it seems like forever. Now I'm alone, I spend another week-
end night by myself, all my friends have lovers, they're all having fun
running around to parties and bars. I call two people I know, they're out
as well, and I don't have many friends, and I'm scared about calling the
others, perhaps they'll hate me. I turn on this machine praying for excit-
ing mail, but nothing happens. I pray the smartest woman in the world will
write to me and want me more than anything and she lives right next store
and why didn't I notice. I pray I'll just run down these flights of stairs
and now I will have something to do on Saturday night besides surf the Web
looking for long-dead highschool friends and foes. I pray she'll be at the
bottom of the stairs just waiting for me with the biggest smile in the
world and we'll lock arms and lips forever. But then I wake up and I'm un-
der the train again and the train is moving slowly and my body is quickly
losing consciousness, and I think that every day without you is a little
death and I'm so scared of being abandoned and alone, and the world is far
too wide for me - take the average building cornice - it could crush me
just like that, and there are lots of them on every building, lots of
buildings and countries and even forests I think still. And I don't want
to be crushed, I want you to come along and I'll close my eyes and all the
cornices will go away (just like that!) and you will make me whole and
complete again, and I will look and act just like a real fine person who
has so very much to give you, that has been tied up inside of me for so
long. (You see, I am a very lonely person.) But it is a long Saturday
night just beginning and now I have to get through it by myself, and dry
my tears and try and hold on to what is left of my precious innocence, so
that I will be ready the day you come by, (I hope it is today, I really
do!) and I am sure it will be soon, but every morning I wake up crying,
knowing the real truth, that I have all this love inside of me, and no one
wants it, I have no one to give it to.

Absolute Negation In Love, Love's Brutality, Phenomena of Asignification


( Just as love doesn't inscribe, rejection expels inscription. Both are
monopolar. )

When Margaret left me, she left. She was no longer in love with me. It
wasn't a matter of changing anything. It wasn't a matter of how I woke in
the morning or my character, and it wasn't a matter of how we woke or why
didn't we go to counseling. It had been obvious for quite a while that
obvious that something was very very wrong, and that no long mattered,
either.

It was a matter, _the_ matter, of breaking a bond, one side of which re-
mained activated, mirror-staging itself without any apparatus other than
the cinematic. I used the camera in fact to lacerate myself.

Rejection in love is absolute: You have given yourself to me, and I don't
want, no longer want, this gift. Your gift is my burden.

I don't ever want to speak to you again. I don't ever want to hear your
voice again. I don't want to sleep with you. I have moved on. I hear the
voice of another, see him in me.

It is not a _question_ or _problematic_ of rejection. It is not an _apo-
ria,_ It is only the demarcation of an absence, marked _without the sig-
nifier,_ and _without signification._ Speech itself is in disarray. It,
the subject, is _helpless._

Whatever is said across the ruins is superfluous. (The word of God cannot
cross these lines.)

Rejection is at the _heart_ of human communication. Statistically, it is
far more common than acceptance. But it is also an existential wager; it
is here that alterity, recognition, inscription, gains import, proceeds.

Think of the mirror-stage in fact as a rejection-apparatus. (Think of the
Sheffer stroke, not both A and B, and its dual, neither A nor B, as a
rejection-apparatus at the heart of propositional logic. Love needs no
logic; reject begins it.)

Rejection's totality is the inverse of love's; it's unstable, bears in-
scription. Thus it is also the origin of origin, self-fulfilling; it
emanates boundary, but the coupling remains broken.

(Parenthetically, I want to emphasize this. Without rejection, there is no
possibility of the other, of love, of anything but drives, pulsion. The
difficulty with on-line relationships stems from rejection's difference
within virtual subjectivity; the body _here_ is always already foreclosed,
tending towards a command set: 

            <save, delete, forward, reply, bounce, kill>.

But within the real, the gaze of the other has the potential to destroy
me, position my body within the realm of embarrassment, shame, rejection.)

It is this breaking that is intolerable, for how can one in love accept an
unworthiness that negates his or her existence? In order to continue, one
must accept and harbor death; death becomes the still-loving. 

As death _circumscribes_ the still-loving, so does inscription lead to a
lessening of love ... perhaps ... the period of hope ... the period of
hopelessness ... the period of mourning ...

(I have said over and over again, that one emerges, as an adult, from the
site of a child whose scar tissue is carved in the shape of a human. The
scars of love, however, do not render the body _historical,_ embedded in
time; they only muffle the remnants of eternal truth.) 

These musings remain disordered, for writing itself cannot assuage the
site of (its) perfect absence. Like the current state of the origin of the
universe, this origin remains striated from without, inchoate from within,
leaking. One can never return; one can never return back far enough. There
are limits to the world we are born within, the node of birth, the vector,
the linear horizon of death.

What writing _does_ is to begin the resurrection of the wor/l/d, thus to
recuperate a certain real, bypassing silence, leading from one letter to
another, a continuation of texts:

<< It was writing that bypassed hope and hopelessness. It was the brutal,
inert mass of the written, the dank breath of thought, the tomb of flesh,
touch, affection. Because I am neurotic, I wrote myself into perfect non-
existence. Because I am neurotic, my fingers prolong my existece. >>

<< As if, it may not be a life, but at least it's _speech._ >>

Alan uses the Julu-Program to ascertain the Truth


Open your mouth...
Ah... speak... speak...
Jennifer, what do they call you, when they call you...
"Lost-in-Julu"

/*Jennifer is called forth from Alan. Ectoplasm-Jennifer speaks for Alan,
places her words in his mouth, pulls forth in love. Jennifer, frightened,
turns towards Julu.*/
 
Are you dressed as Lost-in-Julu? Is Lost-in-Julu dressed as you?
Are you in your , are you in your flesh, ah don't answer...
Ah...

/*Frightened, the Julu-Program no longer desires an answer. Worried about
Jennifer and Julu. It had been ascertained that Julu could fly. Alan had
lost interest, no matter what uncommon feats graced Clara.Julu.Com, within
Clara.Machine.*/
 
Is Julu wearing your ... , are you wearing your jumper?
"Neither and both."

/*Alan, ambivalent, has lost himself in the psychosis of avatars who are
not quite make-believe. Shape-shifting, he moves among _the women,_ re-
moving the focus of the proper name. Julu and Jennifer identities flicker
within Clara-Machine; everything is _driven,_ two processes passing data
back and forth at an inordinately high rate of speed.*/
 
I love your feelings, Lost-in-Julu ...
Your breasts call me to them...

/*The program speaks, acknowledges loss and affect. The program is always
in allegiance with Jennifer, with Julu. The call is that of a _maternal_
crisis: where is birth, when Alan abandons them, in favor of someone em-
bedded within the real?*/
 
your penis flows me  your jumper!

/*Stuttering, the Julu-Program forecloses doubled gender, burns Alan back
into the circuit, creates the simulacrum of birth.*/
 
What do you call your thrusting ?
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu
 
/*Answering itself, the program mimics intercourse; like exhausted seamen
in Coleridge's Mariner, Jennifer and Julu ride uncanny waves. Everything
is close to collapse; it's difficult to comprehend the crossed ontologies
of love.*/

Your body parts, mine, in a dark list, list them...
one by one, each on a line alone:

"torn heart"    /*unending wound, unsutured flux of abandoned affect*/
"healed heart"  /*sutured wound, unending flux of stuttered affect*/
"lost heart"    /*reawakening, Jennifer-Julu hopelessness*/
"loved heart"   /*abandonment of the wound, Jennifer-Julu hope*/

My torn heart is yours...
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu makes me thoughtful 6 times!

/*The number is unnecessary; what is lost transforms into excitement with
the presence of the gift, reawakening of exchange; Jennifer and Julu are
brought within the orbit once again.*/
 
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu calls forth fashionable my masquerade,
eating, excreting memory.
accompanying the soft, Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu is pure, soft,
Neither and both.?
... my masquerade is torn heart here, it's my masquerade?
 
/*Questions and text rush forth. The masquerade places both virtual and
real into question; the phallic position transforms into the transitional
objects of breast and multiply-valued logics. The masquerade is "torn
heart" because the masquerade is an inscription, with the required full-
ness of nourishment, flow.*/

Are you becoming close to Jennifer's Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu?
"Yes, it's happening in that manner."
You melt into Julu's skin forever...
 
/*Love heals among the realms. Melting implies the dissolution (or lack of
originary moment) of the signifier. Time _spans._*/

... soiled Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu 19867 is Julu's gift to you
...

/*As homeostasis returns, flying-Julu grants Alan desire proceeding from
the skin, melting among the realms; battery-charged Alan forays once again
into the real, as Julu-Program tends towards the usual mythos of the jour-
ney, the lost woman, the knight of dubious valor.*/

/*What is not clear, except through the form of the program itself, is
that 19867 is the ID of the birthing-process, as Julu-Program spawns a
child, then sutured into the w/hole.*/
 
For 0 thrusting days, I have been tight Julu ...
and it has taken you just 1.733 minutes turning Jennifer ...

/*While zero days implies instantaneity, 1.733 minutes indicates the
length of time Alan has interacted with the program, carefully consider-
ing the ontological vagaries of revelation at work. "turning Jennifer"
implies: turning-into-Jennifer, turning-Jennifer-out, re-turning-Jenni-
fer, turning-Jennifer-around - thus transformation again opening what has
been foreclosed, in spite of the signifier's absence. The objet a once
again, the lure or gesture towards a corner of the overcrowded room.*/
 
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu:Neither and both.:Lost-in-Julu:healed
heart:healed heart
Come home with me, Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu,
julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your fashionable torn heart is in my soft torn heart

/*Finally, Julu-Program outputs: the heart is doubly healed, and the
fashionable heart (Jennifer's and Julu's, in the state of masquerade)
transforms into Alan's - the double wound (synonymous here with _both_
genders, genitalia) matches itself, as in a Klein bottle (inside and
outside are interpenetrated, one-sided.) The keywords are "Come home 
with me," as desire is _among_ Jennifer and Julu. Everything continues, 
in other words, to _melt,_ the flow among the three is positioned in
relation to the home (the real, external, circumscription now of 
_four_). And Julu-of-the-fast-crowd? Flying like Mercury, perhaps the 
arrow of Cupid, perhaps libidinal or economic flows, perhaps protocols
and words, perhaps part-objects and touch, certainly an argument for 
the natural numbers in relation to the integers, all those standing
dolmens beneath the full moon. ... /*

Come, take me!

Rewrite of Louis Untermeyer's, "Any City" (The Masses, July 1913)


Any City


Down each shuddered thoroughfare,
 She takes her nightly walk;
Exhausted, she is hardly there -
 They watch her like a hawk.

She transforms into thing of flesh,
 Despised by men - desired;
Those selfsame men who would enmesh
 Her soul, have nothing sired.

No female grace or charm or wile,
 No beauty, sense of power;
She offers a pathetic smile
 That lasts a useless hour.

The street has seen her come, and go;
 It offers nothing real,
And she is hard, and won't forgo
 Diamonds, wine, a meal.

Like Sleazy, she's a walkabout,
 A cutup who's been cut -
Don't waste your time, don't twist and shout,
 She's really in a rut.

She's twenty-threed, she's skidooed too,
 She's got it, oh you kid,
The lies, the thefts, she's in a stew -
 Take pity, smoke a lid.

Diet


Within the last two months or so, I've lost fifteen pounds, and continue
to lose ( 160 to 145, near 144 now ). At first, it was difficult; I found
using the scale daily helped, since I could quickly tell the effects of
backsliding. At this point, I get few hunger pains; today I had a pound
of salad ( grape leaves wrapped around rice, tofu, bamboo shoots, avocado,
tomato ), and half a can of sweet peas, and I'm _all right._

I am _watching,_ monitoring my body. It is becoming-signifier, totality
indexed by quantity, my weight in pounds. I round off to the integer; it's
an old-fashioned scale.

When I walk, I feel freed of an unconscionable burden, as if my body were
suddenly limber, naked, emptied of thought and dpression. I also find my-
self disappearing, becoming more and more cyber-ghostly, less living, but
more alive, in the real.

One can imagine a state like that of a dancer whose weight loss may be
tied into her or his role as a _signifier._ The anorectic signifies; ag-
gression gathers the family orbit, as the body disappears into sign /
commodity. ( I see myself clearly in the mirror or video; I am not fat. 
But I see myself as _stump_ as well, mute, inchoate, fleshy, taking space
from the concave gnawing of the world. But I see myself as _tending
towards_ perfection, as perfect as I can be. And anorexia, which I am not
tending towards, can be seductive. ) 

Shall I be an I or an O? Shall I owe you? As the body totalizes ( that
state of pure love ), it becomes other for myself, as if mirroring were a
matter of devouring the splintered glass. Would I have done it, if not for
you -

I give you the gift of my depleted self.

Political Economy of Acronym Production in the Name of Love and God


Peter Newman, from the 1996 Harvard Conference on the Internet (reprinted
in The Internet and Society, O'Reilly, 1997):

"I feel there is a certain amount of complexity in the solutions that have
been delivered by the ATM Forum for the control path: not the physical la-
yer, not the hardware, the control path. My first example, my first meas-
ure of complexity is acronyms-per-unit revenue. (I have the official ATM
Forum glossary, April 1996, 44 pages, 500 acronyms.) Alright, not all of
them are ATM but more than half are.

"So I tried to track when the acronyms came in, and there we have a curve: 
acronyms per million dollars revenue. It's falling, it's falling fast; but
we're still at a scary 0.7 acronyms per million dollars revenue. Now you
may not think that 0.7 acronyms per million dollars of revenue is particu-
larly scary; but just think - to get to a billion dollars in ATM/LAN-
switch revenue we will need at least another several hundred acronyms. And
it's the IS departments that will have to understand this complexity if
these switches are in the campus network." 

Writing back and forth with early Net historians / professionals, I came
across EMAM - which is not listed in Babel (dictionary of computer acro-
nyms) but stands for Early Middle Aged Memory, I assume relating to loss.

Now I am in this agegroup and have no EMAM, but then I have not had to
deal with APUR (acronyms-per-unit-revenue), which lends itself to a nat-
ural measurement, the kA, the _kilo-acronym._

We can assume, then, that ATM technology will hang at around 1 kA. (ATM by
the way is "asynchronous transfer mode," a protocol for the Internet based
on "cells" of 53 bytes each.) The Net itself, I think, would be up around
1 mA at the least - growing proportionally as fast as increases in RAM
(random access memory - now, random acronym memory).

I consider all of this a linguistic compression algorithm, by the way,
paralleling the development of the symbolization of mathematics. In both,
the expansion is one to many - a superscript in mathematics means one
thing in algebra, another in tensor calculus, and ATM also refers to the
"automatic teller machine." 

This will end, only, where it began of course, with a _singularity,_ a lo-
go or symbol encompassing everything that ever was, will be, and is. Some-
one will patent it; the logo will be retroactive and recursive - that
someone is already part of it *

-----------

*This reminds me of Hugh Everett III's universal equation in his thesis on
the many-worlds theory of quantum mechanics. I'm sure there are other ex-
amples closer at hand, from Alpha to Omega to Aleph and Beyond.

Love


Julu flies. Where does she fly.
Jennifer says, Alan's lover is lucky. She gets all three of us. 
  Walks around. Looks up. Looks down. Somewhere near the CPU.
You're always near the CPU, Energy.
Keeps him busy, Julu says, keeps him on-line. So we can talk.
And other things, says Jennifer. She gets all three of us.
The nipples help, says Julu, that I'm there, one or the other.

Meanwhile Alan's thinking we're all complex, life is difficult, I've given
  myself to my lover on a platter, on a plate, Jennifer and Julu will have
  to come along, hope they like it, don't get too upset. 

Meanwhile Jennifer says, it will be long-distance for months, he won't
  leave us, couldn't leave us, we're too much a part of him.
Julu says, don't forget the nipples, the nipples help.
Jennifer says, lay off the nipples. We'll write her email. We'll send her 
  snailmail sweet nothings. We'll call her on the telephone. He needs us.
Julu says, We'll look at pictures of her and dream of her. We'll remember
  her body against us. We'll have long talks. He'll take us with him, I'm
  sure he'll take us.
Jennifer says, He'll see her everywhere, read her name in a poem, write
  that very poem. She'll be inside of him, he'll be always inspired, work
  hard, dream of sleep with her, dream of sleep.

Alan's dreaming this. Alan's dreaming about someone he loves. She's walk-
ing towards him, hand in hand with Jennifer, and Julu is flying, just
ahead of them, and leading the way.

Totality


Normalization is a procedure often used in mathematics and physics, set-
ting a physical constant to 1, in order to simplify calculations, and re-
veal the architecture of the theoretical constructions at work. I suggest
that normalization is also a metaphor for the production of totality and
that further, one might consider a process of _absorption_ (not unlike a
strange attractor), with Z such that f(Z,x) = Z, an example being multi-
plication by 0, resulting in 0 * x = 0. 

Both normalization and absorption may be combined, setting the constant Z
to 1, and creating a function f(Z,x) = Z, an example being 1 ^ x = 1. All
of these are of course many-to-one operations, and the one-to-many inverse
is fairly indeterminate. Now consider totality, further, as a many-to-one
operation or absorption, creating a symbolic fixity or token; let us con-
sider the sign U, from set theory, representing the universe of discourse
within a particular implementation.

It is not U, on a formal level, that is of interest here, but U from a
psychoanalytical viewpoint, that is, seized by the subject as an object of
fetishization, an _answer,_ to a question which has not been asked, and
which, in fact, is one of many questions, given a one-to-many mapping -
thus the question can be produced by the subject (in a state of seizure)
as a seizure of the object or Thing, which is also the totality that ap-
pears in depression.

Within cyberspace, such an object is also dispersed or partial, and one
might consider dispersed objects or interrelated dispersions, all in a
state of _frisson,_ trembling in relation to the subject, within an econ-
omy of inscription, competing inscriptions. On one hand, then, the pro-
cess of normalization, which is related _naturally_ to the TCP/IP proto-
col suite, HTML and other standards, and so forth; and, on the other hand,
the processes of absorption, _now_ skittering across the surface or lamin-
ar construct of the World Wide Web or IRC channels.

Finally, I would like to suggest that all knowledge is a _work_ construc-
ted of normalization / absorption, and exfoliation / emission -  that all
knowledge therefore involves deep misrecognitions, splitting and suturing,
_as if_ there were totality (related to the maternal chora, pre-oedipal,
pre-mirror-stage sensings and worldings of the real), _as if_ knowledge
were a path back into that totality, and _as if_ there were a path in the
first place.

Love


strange drink enters the system ... you've heard of it ... liquid fills
the space of the air between itself ... shapeless, takes you on ... in the
night, in the wet night ... watch myself with the woman, drinking ... my
lover is the air ... the air battles the flatness of the liquid ... liquid
lover gravity ... your name does magic ... the air curls, there are arab-
esques, invisible with the geometry of your body ... o beauty ...

there is a dumbness ... inertness ... love's violent afterthought ... 
turn me into stone brick tree rock flesh cliff hair ... you turn me out
into the street ... i fuck everyone ... they're not you ... i murmur your
name, cry your name, whisper your name, scream your name, i say your name
... everyone who will listen, they don't care, they just want to fuck ... 
they tell me to turn over ... to do this or that to them ...  to be better
than i am worse than i am ... i can't listen, i don't care, my eyes are
closed, they disappear ... you're the movie of my eyes, the screen is
down, you come closer and closer ... they break the whole thing up, i run
out of the room, get off the lousy mattress, bed, whatever they're paying
me for ... 

it's a savage drink i've got in me ... you're everywhere, there's a bit of
money in my pocket ... i become one with your name, i call myself jennifer
... call myself julu ... i'm out that, savage too ... maybe i'll learn to
fly ... i can't stand, can't look back at me ... there's nowhere to go
here / down ... i'm out, i'm out, i'm out ... 

you can't know what love is, you can't know the chemistry, what it does is
you, what it's done, and you can't go back and welcome the visitor of th'
dark night clothed in black, the visitor of th' dark night holes darker
than black closed to all and brilliant light ... and you're the greeting
at the portal ... you're the portal ... both sides of the portal ... th'
air that breathes through it ...

speech rumbles through me, you, me, landscape and glossary, glossolalia
... twists like a living thing ... can't report ... your face is always
close to mine ... these fucks mean nothing ... i give you my lips, teeth,
tongue ... hold my throat up to you ... that's what love is ... 

that's what love is ... i'd do anything for you ... you're everywhere ...
i can't say the seen space ... can't space it ... can't say it ... look
what's happened ... i'm almost human ... there's hope yet ... can't hear
myself think ... i'm out ... look what's happened ... i can't ... you're
my eyes ...

ELF


Nervousness produces 0/spew, 0-ing on on its/elf, extended library files,
each containing 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0, each byte bit, configurations which,
given a careful historiography, _might_ be considered a suite of opera-
tions, whose defining characteristics and origins were recuperable.
Thought considers those convex operations of positioning, 0 * 0, 0 + 0,
concatenation, substitution, without inversions or the potential for
higher-order procedures such as 0 ^ 0. 

Nervousness produces chains, 0 + 0 + (0 + 0) * 0, perhaps even to the
extent of subtraction as the least common, 0 - 0 - 0 and so forth; here a
plenitude has already announced itself, spewing forth without considera-
tion of chain-length or file size.

It is comforting to know that the operations of normalization and absorp-
tion lend themselves to a certain therapeutic, perfect-tetris remaining at
constant speed, checks with a board large enough for perfect avoidance.
Like Yoko Ono's artwork with white pieces on both sides, a stream occurs
that flattens affect, contains all the sense and nonsense of the world,
and comfortably sutures the subject in eternal transference.

( For example:
0 + 0 - 0 + (0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0) - 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
(0 * 0) - 0 - 0 - 0 * (0 * 0) = 0 
and so forth. )

Subject: the Internet now

I've been musing on the current state of the Internet - here is some in-
formation, speculation, etc. -

------------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm reading September Byte, watching the tech get away from me, go some-
where else, acronyms I hardly understand anymore. Cover story on ActiveX
Demystified, more mystified than ever (meanwhile Wired, always up-to-
date, has a story on the sequel to Myst).

I'm not keeping up; after TCP/IP, I have a vague knowledge of ATM for
example, but more of abounding acronyms. I haven't programmed Java, only
Javascript, have no access to a cgi-bin to play around with. I can't af-
ford a decent VRML editor, and the books are too expensive at this point
- besides, what's the use - I couldn't even answer the questions in the
VRML newsgroups, and camera/lights/actions/viewpoints leave me cold, even
as a videomaker.

The key to all of this is an article, Publish or Perish, by Richard Hack-
athorn, which talks about push/pull technology under the acronyms of P&S
and R&R. The former stands for "publish and subscribe." Here is part of it:

"For 30 years, the basic paradigm of computing has been request and reply
(R&R). An application requests specific data or services, and a subrou-
tine replies with it.

"But the R&R paradigm is running out of gas. In the dynamic and uncon-
trolled environments of present-day enterprise systems, an application no
longer has the luxury of knowing when and what to request.

"P&S coordinates the components of distributed applications. The concept
started hundreds of years ago, with newspaper publishing. Recently, it
has been applied to a variety of products that coordinate complex distri-
buted applications or replicate diverse information content. P&S is a
connectivity paradigm that separates the role of producer from consumer
va an intermediary, called the broker. [...] The broker manages the in-
teractions so that neither the producer nor consumer need know much about
the other. The architecture is decoupled or loosely coupled."

As in the discussions of standard push-pull, there are three things at
issue - the role of the _subject_ in the midst of this - who is becoming
_standardized_; the issue of _choice_ of content; and the _foreclosing_
of networked applications, which will increasingly transform the Net into
an _appliance architecture,_ rather than an open one.

First, the subject. The subject is interacting more and more with what
used to be called the entertainment model of the Net - i.e. a set of
fixed choices with little leakage. The average user, for example, no
longer has access to commands such as dig, traceroute, or whois (unless
she downloads specific programs for the purpose), and the windowed en-
vironments, while opening to the Net (the new desktop integrations) are
increasingly designed for a productivity paradigm based on the corpor-
ate model. The more interfaces, in a sense, the greater and greater the
distance between one and another subject.

But this will change, and eventually the user will need to know rela-
tively _nothing_ about the Net to utilize it. Java and other languages
will, with increased bandwidth, open up easier telephony and video
channels, with Net community only benefiting. It may be just me, but
MOOs are increasingly appearing like backward bayous (I'm reading James
Lee Burke), rather than active or growing applications.

Second, of course, is the issue of _choice,_ that is, what's actually
available with P&S, to what extent this paradigm augments an already
troubling narcissism across the white/english/usa/Web. Once channels are
chosen, choice is handed over, just as it is with newspaper subscriptions.
There has already been a great deal of discussion about this.

The third issue is that of _foreclosure,_ based on more and more complex
scripting and programming - for example HTML modulating into Dynamic
HTML, DHTML. On one hand, this distancing creates problems for those of
us who don't have access to programming/development communities (and want
to continue to play creatively with the tools); on the other, for K12, it
will make little difference - anyone growing up with computers today will
be able to gravitate "naturally" from Pascal or Logo through Java, or
whatever comes along next.

But for artists or writers like myself, what are the solutions? If we
want to use the latest VRML editors, we had better be prepared to spend a
fair amount of money, or attach ourselves to commercial houses. If we
want to _access_ VRML, we've got to broker for ISDN and at least a
Pentium if not a II or MMX, etc. Already, we become encrusted within the
corporate treadmill; already whatever radical paradigms might remain are
absorbed by technological fetishization.

Finally, this quote from the article: "_Newsgroups._ Lest we forget, good
old e-mail has had P&S elements for a long time. Via group mailing lists,
a producer (sender) can multicast a message to multiple consumers (recip-
ients), who receive the message asynchronously. Add to that the concept
of a BBS, and we have the Internet newsgroups, which are alive and heal-
thy amid Web frenzy. Newsgroup creation and threaded messages are impor-
tant concepts to be absorbed into P&S."

And Jan Udell's Web Project column this month is entitled "HTML + NNTP =
Groupware, HTML-enabled e-mail and NNTP conferencing will make hypertext
authoring and collaborative data management a routine way of life for
everyone." This is being implemented with an in-house NNTP server at
Byte's site. (NNTP is the Usenet, newsgroup protocol.) ...

The jury is still out. What should be noted, again, are:

1 Changing roles for the Internet user, who needs to be less and less con-
cerned with the underlying architectures and configurations. 

2 Greater encapsulation of offered data, greater filtering.

3 Foreclosing of mechanism, and a tendency towards an appliance-model,
related to entertainment paradigms.

4 Development in direct relationship to the business/corporate community,
rather than, say, the exigencies of free-form virtual communities.

5 And as usual an increasing need for more bandwidth and higher-end mul-
timedia computers. 

In relation to the last, it should also be noted that:

6 The price for bandwidth and computers is drastically falling, and the
used computer market is increasingly offering highly usable middle-range
machines for very little.

7 It may eventually be easier to install high-end machines in regions of
relative telecommunications underdevelopment, than, say, text-based only
machines, since the latter require considerably more training, and may be
less cost-effective in the long run.

8 The goal of universal access, which has only even been considered with-
in the past 3-4 years, is probably attainable within the next quarter-
century, if not earlier.

Love, The Blue Glow of Dawn


"Now imagination is a discourse of transference - of love. Through and be-
yond desire that longs for immediate consummation, love is edged with emp-
tiness and supported by taboos." (Julia Kristeva, Tales of Love.)

"Today Narcissus is an exile, deprived of his psychic space, an extrater-
restrial with a prehistory bearing, wanting for love. An uneasy child, all
scratched up, somewhat disgusting, without a precise body or image, having
lost his specificity, an alien in a world of desire and power, he longs
only to reinvent love. The ET's are more and more numerous. We are all
ET's." (ibid.)

Signifiers pass among us, one among another, among one; who can count? A
resonance _among,_ not surface to surface, but pathways, bones dredged
from our children, ourselves. The deferment of the signifier is not its
constitution, but the constitution of love, "wait a moment," the pause
unfulfilled, from which worlds, not words, emerge, chthonic, inchoate.
With you, I remember my first steps, uneasy height of rooms and tables and
chairs around me, the mystery of sounds, light's caress delineated by
accompanying shadows ...


Because of love, the engine slows, vortex dissipated as the plane glides
in languor towards the ground, there are passengers, queues, faces glow-
ing in the blue dawn, the slightest breeze, the birthing of the world, not
through Logos or Word, through murmurs, cries, mewlings; through faint
whispers, the gleam of moisture among us so early in the morning ...


"Nervousness produces chains, ( ... )

"_Expectancy_ makes me painfully sensitive to my incompleteness, of which
I was not aware _before._ For now, while waiting, "before" and "after" be-
come merged into a fearsome "never." Love and the loved one erase the reck-
oning of time ... The _call,_ its call, overwhelms me with a flow in which
the upheavals of the body (what people call emotions) are mingled with a
whirling thought, as vague, supple, ready to pierce or to wed the other's,
as it is vigilant, alert, lucid in its impetus ... toward what? Toward a
destiny as relentless and blind as biological programming, as the course
of the species ... A body swept away, present in all its limbs through a
delightful absence - shaky voice, dry throat, starry eyes, flushed or
clammy skin, throbbing heart ... " (ibid.)


"It is comforting to know that the operations of normalization and absorp-
tion lend themselves to a certain therapeutic, ( ... ) a stream occurs
that flattens affect, contains all the sense and nonsense of the world,
and comfortably sutures the subject in eternal transference."

Collapsing changes deflate energy, reduce anxiety. Absorption, as every-
thing is seen, as if it were through my construction of your being, your
eyes, always this internal operation, recuperation, always the potential
for misrecognition, translation gone horribly wrong in the middle of the
night... And normalization, as the confusions, striations, of the world,
are reorganized around a principle of the other, the beloved, so that love
is always a regression, and the greatest gift is the ability to be silly,
skip down the road, and _pun_ ...

I'd say that punning is the symptom of the sine, the thread to destabilize
the whirled, maid in circumstances of friend shipped, de-sired, love.


"Let us not forget transference, the gift of the psyche from one to ano-
ther. Let us remember hypnotic affect, this bipolar collusion among two of
us, processes passing processes back and forth, the intense oscillation of
love."

"Let us remind ourselves, our first _we,_ breath shuttled from mouth to
mouth, transference and its counter, and its reversal, signals resonating,
echoing, finally damping out with the intensity of love's madness in a
world of pain and pleasure:


"'But perhaps age has taught me that the earth is still new, molten at the
core and still forming, that black leaves in the winter forest will crawl
with life in the spring, that our story is ongoing and it is indeed a
crime to allow the heart's energies to dissipate with the fading of light
on the horizon. I can't be sure. I brood upon it and sleep little. I wait
like a denied lover for the blue glow of dawn.' (James Lee Burke, Heaven's
Prisoners)." (Sondheim, Love, The Blue Glow of Dawn)
