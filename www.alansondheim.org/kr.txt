The upper millimeter of the ocean as well as the upper millimeter of Sono-
ran desert soil carries unicellular life and organic processes necessary
for the survive of the biome. But oil slicks are highly disruptive of the
former, and human footprints destroy the latter. One should always stay on
the trails, which are clearly marked. Nevertheless, jet skies and off-road
vehicles create their own traces of exhaust and tire ruts - not to mention
noise, scribbling their way across wilderness remnants. From above, atmos-
pheric poisons, ranging from ozone depletion to industrial gases, trans-
form saguaro and pond growth; life begins its long cycling into still-born
and somnolent realms. Trucks carry the last gasps of fossil life, suddenly
immolated and noisy; planes carry fossil fuels across continents, memories
of DNA slathered into billowing clouds. Molecular chains, bacterial and
viral beginnings, diffuse the world with strategies of rupture; below,
those on foot and machine repeatedly blister, as cancers and hibernated
diseases make their way into bodies already half-destroyed by toxins. Now
age is pushed back, longer lives accompanied by tumors and running sores.
The lives run wild in the ocean and desert, run waste in the forest and
lake. Scribblings spew on; what isn't carried through the wires or elec-
tromagnetic spectrum, makes itself felt in the hard or soft substrates of
the world. The scribblings speak of desperate help, of worlds in need, of
unending pain. Winds carry the foams and slicks elsewhere, coating every-
thing; desiccation dries and dusts the remnants of bike trails covering
desert and prairie alike. Blinded animals hunger for each other. One can
still hear incandescent engines in the distance, pistons slamming into the
vestiges of oils and gasolines, signatures of earlier dawns. Odors and
engines drown out mating habits millions of years old; species continue
their road to extinction as new houses crumble with the weight of redwoods
and cement. Nothing is alive any more; everything goes on and on. The
world slams into the world. The world babbles dry spittle; your animals
are dead. A pond's polluted ripple takes care of the rest; there's nothing
left of your eyes either.

Do Men Cry, By Jennifer


No, men do not cry, and I am not sure they could be Taught to. I have seen
many men and they do not cry, even when there are things that would make
Them cry if they could. I am sure of this from my obversation Study. Now I
have seen many a distrawt woman who will be sitting in a Chair looking
very sad with tears runing down her Face. She is doing Crying. And then a
man will come Over to that woman and he will put his Hand on her showlder.
He will Stand there just with his Hand on her showlder. And she will put
Her hand on his Hand. Then she may not be So distrawt, I do not know from
obversation study. But he will not Cry too.

carol androsky and


avatars, continued, well because it's all created by the movies, in high-
school i had a crush on this girl carol androsky, so i heard she was in
little big man, the sister, but i never saw it and now i've got the tv on
and there she is, intense and so direct, so the first time i read at be-
yond baroque, well i hadn't heard from her for years, so she came to the
reading of a sudden, she called and i heard she was coming, and we are
both now in our 50s and there she is and the sky creates a subtle crack,
she is already sounding tired, retired, of a quietude, i don't know her
feelings but here the sadness that i've still got daily, i suppose might
have manifest, but i would never be sure, but we took a walk but she
didn't stay when i opened my mouth and spoke words, saying things just
like that in front of everyone, if i get that loss of energy, kill me,
maybe she was pretending for my sake, i disappoint everyone, in the film
she just rode away in a wagon and that's the last of it, it's a group of
frames, the color already slightly turned, carol if you're still out there
write me, she wasn't on line even then, sometimes i'd dream of her when i
wasn't dreaming of margaret hall, but margaret never made it to the screen
and carol returns over and over again, some people here still talk about
it late into the night, i don't know, other than my parents, i don't know
anyone here at all, so this just shows, how sentiment rule the day, it
would have to grow in length, like a snake or bamboo, like a tree or thing
that grows, when it's ten feet long, you'd understand, that beneath pathos
there's always pathos, and beneath those pathos, even taking it all apart,
there's nothing that escapes the angel of death, i'm watching the film,
carol hasn't returned, she's tall, thin, still is, with an uncanny aura
about her, i've never been able to pin it down, i've never understood it,
not in highschool, my heart would be beating, everyone could hear it, i'm
sure of that, carol never said anything, i was forgettable, i ate myself
out, i turned myself out, i turned myself in, at beyond baroque i wanted
to get to know her again, she was like a ghost, she spoke softly, slipped
in and out, like a transparent gif or a webpage already abandoned, like an
old film with the color disappearing, she left a trail there, i'm sure she
was in the desert, somewhere around los angeles maybe, for the filming,
some of it looks like the sierras, where did they fly her, carol could
still get in touch, she won't, i never touched her, not fingertip to fing-
ertip, i was a virgin, i yearned to the breaking point, the yearning
curled like a snake in me, like a ten foot snake, i'm fairly short, it
broke through the skin, scene after scene, she's never there, i could
change the channel, i don't, i just keep hoping, she'll come on again,
she'll disappear again, i could cry over this, i cry easily, i'll write
javascript, i'll make a carol description, search the web, i have her
phone number, i'm afraid to call her, the film will disappear before the
world comes to an end, before humans and their cities grow silent and
charred, she'll be gone, i'm already ahead of her, the night's cold,
there's snow on the ground, there are hostile and friendly tribes in the
hills, it's all brittle, like a crystal, like the look in carol's eyes,
i'll save the image, cut the screen out, i'll put the screen in my heart,
i'll put a carol-function on the web, the web is my heart, someday before
i die, that day will be soon, i'll see the film again, i'll make the film
again, i directed little big man, i walked with carol in the wilderness, i
spoke to carol in the wilderness, i'll see her in the tunnel, i'll be with
her in the tunnel, her color will be perfect, she's speak like i speak,
walk like i walk, she'll come into beyond baroque, just as i'm about to
start the reading, just as i'm about to start the screening, she'll sit
down with me and see what i've done, she'll love me for it and her heart
will beat so loud loud loud loud loud, her heart will beat so loud

Little Big Man's Sister, Carol Androsky


Carol is teaching Little Big Man how to shoot a gun. It's all in the eyes,
and you don't have to look at much, but have that have-open half-closed
look. It's a form of Zen gun, and Little Big Man really thanks Carol and
does a good job shooting three things out of the air, after he shoots
three bottles. He meets Wild Bill Hickock and they talk in a bar and he
has a hard time putting his feet up on a table. Then a man is shot by Wild
Bill. Later Carol rides out of the picture and I don't see her again, and
I am waiting and waiting to see her again. But the picture gets very
intense and very sad, it is a very good picture, and an old very wise man
dies at the end but doesn't really and gets up, and Little Big Man and the
Grandfather walk down the hill. Carol must be somewhere in this great
land, and I wonder, where did she learn to shoot so very well? Her face is
filled with stars and intensity such as I have never seen. Little Big Man
should be appreciating Carol more, but he died at least fifty years ago,
and Carol is living in Los Angeles. I wonder why she agreed to do the
picture, maybe to preserve the way she walked and talked and shot that gun
so beautifully. If you do a record, and I did a few, you can always play
it later and say, listen, you are hearing me being busy for a half hour of
my life and it's very different now, even the smells are different. Later,
I will be dead and everyone around me too, and then you can hear the re-
cord and say, so that is what it must be like. That is what it must be
like for Carol, and why she made the film. I love seeing the film because
it is a nice message for me, maybe I will see it again. I will dream of
Carol in grade school and high school, all those years I knew her, and I
will dream of Carol at Beyond Baroque, but now I will also dream of in-
tense and terrific shooting Carol in Little Big Man, too. I did not know
she could shoot a gun so well, I am proud I knew this woman who taught
Little Big Man what he know about firing a gun.

In Mordor and Below


Admittedly, there were times when the legions of Mordor were defeated by
the onslaught of Valkyries from the Netherworld. But there were no short-
ages of fey Princesses to turn towards the Magister, producing one or ano-
ther Norn of Combat; such were the power of the Princesses. Norn had no
fathers and no mothers; born of magic, they were, like viruses or rotifer-
a, excellent at their work, devoid of memory, ration and language. Their
food was the simplest of hunting and gathering; they had no behavior. The
Magister, on the other hand, was unique; there was always one, and only
one, Magister, and without the Magister, Upperworld would quickly disap-
pear. Magister was fiery and enormous. Magister was Magister. Magister
knew everything, past, present, and future; Magister allowed for free will
through Magister's mysterious paths. Magister's mother and father were
lost, even to Magister, a fact Magister pondered continually; there was no
end to the pondering that drew up against the blank wall of cosmic infla-
tionary scenarios.

The Netherworld had a gate or Portal to Upperworld, on the order of a
volcanic crater, creviced, full of fearsome smoke and boulders. Fractal
stone formations, amphiboles, separated the two Worlds, which were
repeatedly in danger of being torn asunder; once that occurred, gravity
would diminish and untold damage would be done in both. The Valkyries,
like the legions of Mordor, had no individual names, but were, for all
intents and purposes, mass phenomena, mass men without mothers, men from
men. Geographically astute, they had no other necessary knowledge. Food
was supplied by crude hunting which increasingly devastated what remained
of the pristine wilderness - already contaminated by the smoke from
numerous wildfires. It was useless to promise anything to Valkyrie or
legionnaire (such as they were), since the concept of a contract already
required logical reasoning and the presence of a well-developed language.

The princesses were born from mothers and fathers; they had various
powers. Beyond geography, they were aware of the general economics of both
Worlds, preferring of course the Upper, where they were well-known and
well ensconced. The princesses often spoke of the enormous mechanism of
these Worlds, how things were somehow set into motion, and remained in
motion, even when other things came along. They knew their lineage well,
apparently remaining virgins, since no one was their equal. Beyond all of
these - legions, Norn, Magister, princesses, and Valkyries - there were
rumors of additional species, and even additions to the current ones. For
example, there were rumors of men accessible to virgins, a Mistress for
the Magister, additional legions including infantry, camp followers, and
horse-arches. But these were never seen, the rumors never substantiated.
On the other hand, the rumors alone might have been part of the mechanism
of the World, although there was no one around to say for sure. For the
most part, Mordor continued its uneasy sway; for the most part, the Portal
remained open; and for the most part, the Norn of Combat did their jobs
admirably. A Norn of Combat was the equivalent of a Valkyrie.


__________________________________________________________________________



============================================
Fierce Theodor has wrought this sonnet.
Norn walked to Valkyrie, true fey Princess
lost in Mordor's distance, wilt thou say
I abjure rumor lost and truth regained. I
speak of Mordor's legions, O charmful
Magister, of fired visage, know thou what
Norn will speak, in light of tongueless
Norn, in light of mouthless Norn and 
speechless Norn? The Portal formed the
Wander of many a fey Princess; I formed
them, they formed them. Would that Sorcery
have no role but obvious Sincerity; would
Upper and Nether World clash at volcanic
Rim, defeat of legionnaire and Norn alike.
============================================



The Tail


Mordor hath a King and Queen, Emperor and Empress, Marquis and Marquette,
Dukes and Duchesses, Princesses but no Princes, Earls and Knights. Porno-
graphic Netherworld hath Vicounts and Vicountesses, Barons and Baronesses
and Baronettes, Priestes and Nunnes. For there is no Fantasy without King
and Princess, no Pornography without Sir and Baroness. Now be advised that
such is a Duchess, that She bridges the two Realms, her Head in one, her
Cunt in the Other. Thus a Duchess is also a Suspension. Rumor hath masses,
soldiers and knaves, clerkes and clerks, franklins and monks and alewives.
A Viscount of a Vicount visits Rumor from Mordor, thus Bridging the two
Realms, his Mouth in one, Prick in the Other. Thus a Viscount is Suspen-
ded. Revolution hath a King and Queen, masses and knaves, clergy and mer-
chants. A mass seeps through Pornography from Revolution, its Holes in one
and Sticks in the Other. Thus a mass is a Blanket of Fervent Desire poked
through with Liquids and Knives.

Jennifer only wearing panties lovely writings  Tent    0 min   2 min
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These conversations should be trashed. The writings aren't lovely any more
- they're predictable. Jennifer can only go so far pretending she's a. A
10-year-old who writes "cute"; b. An avatar of Alan; c. Anything other
than Julu and Nikuko and the rest of them. The conversations - all of
which take place, or at least pretend to, within a "talker" - are childish
and hardly reveal anything about virtual subjectivity and relationships.
They sound like waspy small-town characters trying to be smart in an all-
night mall. And there has to be better ways to "examine" cyberspace - if
such it is - than this continued yammering. Why do people insist on talk-
ing so? You can find them anywhere, on a street-corner for example. Here,
they bounce up and down - elsewhere, they behave as magicians, but as long
as you realize they're just text, someone's writing all that, it makes a
lot more sense.

And then what kind of sense? Nonsense or trivia. Or small-talk, rumor,
gossip, what have you. Maybe relevance elsewhere for the development of
language, but here, nothing but a smarmy way of breathing life into the
dead. When you start with language, you end with language. When you start
with characters or emanations or avatars, what have you, you go through
the motions with them. You might end up dreaming about them, for that
matter - none of it's really important. The dreams can be psychotic, you
can be psychotic, it's all the same. It's like paste - they're like paste,
and you can't tell good from bad any longer. It would be "cute" for ex-
ample to pretend this is written by "Jennifer" or "Alan" or what-have-you,
but it doesn't _gain_ anything, literarily or philosophically. It's dead.
There's no journey involved. The absence is reflected in the text. The
text is the surface of a shock-wave, signifying nothing but collapse at
the center - collapse of meaning, for example.

There's no reason for any of this, except the fulfillment of a textual
quota that's suspect in the first place. You could look aside and garner
the same intelligence from the periphery or other activities. In one of my
videotapes, a woman's breasts are on the screen; my voice is heard from
the side, begging the viewer, don't look, look anywhere else, please, look
over here, look there, not at the screen, anywhere but there. The woman is
now dead. The repetition is nauseous; I should have been silenced then, at
that very moment when I began generating quota. I was fulfilling quota, I
was creating in language. The breasts weren't enough, weren't satisfactory
- quota had to be fulfilled, there had to be additions, as if there were
something else present, through the basis of language rubbed raw with it-
self. (In another scene, in the same tape, I'm naked, the woman is coup-
ling with me, mouth to anus. I'm reciting, what else, theory, talking and
talking, another form of distraction. Trying to explain, not myself - I'm
not that developed - but all the theories I was creating - on, and on, and
on, a flood of theory - until breathing took over, heavier and heavier,
ending in cries and orgasm. I was reduced to _paper,_ to the inscription
of sexuality, desire, organism. I was in the gone world. The quota was
forgotten or laterally fulfilled again. But it was never sufficient; like
a drug, it was destined to repeat, over and over again, sexuality as a
neurotic guarantee of existence, the excremental body clawed, almost to
death but not quite.)

The quota is the daily work, daily writing. The quota won't let me alone.
The quota is a way of breathing life into the writer. The writer would die
without the quota; the quota is a measure of breaths. Breasts stand for
nothing; they _are_ life, iconic in the presence of quota's indexicality.
The quota is a measure, in fact, of _damaged life,_ of life that refuses
itself. 

It doesn't matter who _wrote_ the lines, in fact; they came from a singu-
lar body, or a multiplicity under the aegis of a communal domain, commu-
nality. What does matter is that they're dissolute, having served no use-
ful purpose, even to the inhabitants. And what does matter is that they're
a waste of space, a waste of thought itself.

(Julu) You will never understand ...
(Jennifer) Shut-up Julu, he's right.
(Jennifer) Nikuko, is that you!

Asleep at the Wheel


As an alternative (says no one), consider an enormous cave with protru-
sions, largely convex, almost ellipsoidal, there are flashes of electron
interactions, there are spheres that protrude as well... one might notice
the wires, inordinately thin, hair-like, interfaces, located within or
without the cavern - this only matters from the viewpoints of topography
and epistemology. They're carriers; the swarms imitate bodies or portions
of bodies or extrusions from bodies, part-objects or emissions related to
communication. The "from" and the "to" are defined elsewhere, outside. One
finds a consciousness roaming at will, cognizant of the phenomenology, the
geography, the geomatics underlying what might be considered a site, were
it not a model of worlding. For the topography continually morphs, connec-
tions are made and broken. Think of threshold logics, gateways constantly
making and breaking connections, variable thresholds based on feedback and
feedforward mutating flows. Think of parallel fluxes, wires illuminated,
one might be after the other, wires burned into temporary substrates,
couplings and linkages ignoring organic, metallic, or glassy compounds -
the s/ms flood (says no one) in the manner of the speaking of avatars, the
coherencies of the body and its totalities, consensualities among internal
and external communicative domains. Pulsing with bloods, red-brown fluids,
membranes, flows, micro-connectors. Apply quantum logic here (non-distri-
butive gestural structures): What forms emerge, visible as temporary tur-
bulent structures? Give the stases names: If the space is Alan, think
Jennifer. Place her back within the ellipsoid (says no one); harbor her
there. It's nothing of the energy, everything of superimposition. Let her
rest. Let the rest of her rest.

Neuraesthenic


Thrown against the upper cranial aspects (no one says), tendrils shoot
across the net like lightning - no one present on the talker, no one there
for ICQ, no one in the chats, no one hungered around for ytalk. Tendrils
withdraw, curl into basketry. Within the baskets, souls. It's then I
recognized Nikuko was neuraesthenic, withdrawn and wan, delicately and
violently harboring the life-form of a flower in her forgiving hands.
(Nikuko draws on Lafcadio Hearn.) A visage appears in the blood-red womb,
the red-brown womb, the sea-borne womb, darker brown, tending towards
black, no one knows the source of the dim light flowing towards the floor
(no one says). No one brings names into this place; "Nikuko draws on Laf-
cadio Hearn" is discarded. Replacement-semantics, mobile tags, flooded and
toppling structures, emanations. Emanation is the sure sign of the neur-
aesthenic; something uncanny glowed about her as flesh and features seemed
to form, coalesce, into a coherency described as human. Then disappear, no
one coming forward (no one says) for conversation near the hearth. Here,
the hearth is everywhere and in dark bloom. Here, shadows are emanations.
Here, neuraesthenics are emanations, ancestors of ectoplasm. Avatars are
centuries in the future.

starting the thing (says no one)


on the wall of the cave you might, if you were an interpreter, see grids
of 0s and 1s. you might find them rectangular, you might find more 0s
than one, 1s like nuclei floating in vacuo, you might find flickered 1s
where 0s used to be. you might see repetitions and growths, you might find
the rudiments of cellular automata, you might find circulations, repairs.

you press your eyes, you press god into your eyes, you see god, you see
patterns and geometries. sometimes you open them, and there is delay-
decay, and through delay-decay you see all colors upside-down. you see the
origin of the world in your mind, the mind that is your origin as inter-
preter. you are inside the cave, factory-womb, you press your eyes.

through delay-decay you look with wide eyes at the grid, flicking 1s and
0s, and you see things. what you see you can tell, what you can tell is
what you see, but you will see things off and peripheral, distortions,
corrections and checksums, and you want to see things badly. you tell the
same desire which is your name for wanting to see things badly.

delay-decay, but they are there, what you are seeing, which is your tell-
ing in many other ways, as if there were other caves, caves reflecting and
projecting caves, caves of pulsion and inconceivable affect, caves of in-
flationary worlds. you are knowing them and telling them jennifer and ava-
tar, and your telling is your naming, naming and telling are one.

you will know that there are externals, as thick bundles of thin wires
course energy and disappear into the darkness, and you will know too that
within the darkness, naming and telling are separated although always
connected, always in relation. it is there, you will think, that jennifer
begins tell you things. but she has already started, and she is here.

so unable to overtake me. Your frame was but an empty shell. You were
completely at a loss, and so you were amazed.

A little rain, in fact, begins to fall in someone's life.
(Jennifer) Well, I'm twelve and on the verge.

2 Works by Tennessee Rice Dixon (and others): Scrutiny in the Great Round, 
and Count: Article by Jennifer (1) and Alan (2)


[ It's as if I'm looking at a breathing body, Scrutiny in the Great Round,
and Count, by Tennessee Rice Dixon, two of the most impressive CD-ROM
works I have seen. There are no _objects_ in them, no screen areas set-
aside for control. There are partial-objects, flows, transparencies. One
moves as the cursor shape-changes, but the movement is not linear - i.e.
left does not "mean" _back,_ and right _front._ The world is murky, irre-
solute. In Scrutiny, there are 'sun' and 'moon,' and in Count (which is
still undergoing development), there are 'male' and 'female.' But these
are ongoing processes, always in flux. Scrutiny in the Great Round is by
Calliope Media, with Dixon, Jim Gasperini, and Charlie Morrow (sounds and
music.) ]

When meaning falls apart, does meaning come together?
When meaning comes together, does meaning fall apart?

Jennifer says she really likes the work because it is very wet, that you
can see beneath the surface but you can also see the surface, it is very
wonderful that way. And there are many things beneath the surface, but
they are not things, they are glistenings. You might ask about the glis-
tenings, but they are male and female sometimes and sometimes moon and
sun, and I love running with the moon, not with the sun. It is the dark-
ness that is so wonderful; all these murmurs appear from the darkness,
unlike any other CD-ROM I have seen, and the configuration is placed way
out of the way. With Count, I did have to Apple-Q(uit) out of the work,
which is a good way of leaving the world, of course, you can't leave a
world from within it, which is why I like being there, it surrounds me.

Does living the world mean leaving the world?
Does leaving the world meaning living the world?

These worlds are chthonic and inchoate, of and through the earth. Part-
objects, emergences from the _chora,_ appear, only to disappear, invert,
reverse, hold themselves breathless. The speeds of the works are the
speeds of breathing.

Does breathing mean breathing the world into being breathing?
Does the world breathe? Does the world breathe for a little while?

It's as if you're clicking on sections of things that may never have been
whole, part-objects without objects, emergences or gestures that have 
never been completed - accompanied by nostalgias, yearnings. Because you
want completeness and lose yourself in the space, which is the container
for all the incompletes, making them, _as-if_ they were whole (again).

Are there any objects, are there any wholes?
Are objects just a telling, then a naming of the telling-wholes?

Tennessee is here and I ask her about memory. Do both works deal with
memory? Yes, she can say that they do. Memory and remembering. Memories of
what, Jennifer asks. Memories as fabric or landscapes of memories she
says. Memory field or landscape where you find what memories are present,
or what memories come to be there. Inviting memories, how the memory takes
form. Inviting parts of memories. I ask if there are any complete memories
in the first place. Tennessee says they are always forming. Tennessee can
visualize a memory. Memory changes over time. Her memory switches. So I
say, Jennifer says, there is a field of memories. (Jennifer remembers
fields or architectures of memories, that so clearly, memory is not [it]
the thing itself, not part and parcel, but a reconstruction. From what?
From cues, from broken logics that an organism takes into the truth. And
such architectures! Memory-palaces, alcoves, chests of drawers. Mnemonics,
as if the world were in reach, as if the past were always already present.
But the world slides out - or rather, we slide, always against the grain.
It's as if one can imagine the heat-death of the cosmos, embers billions
of years hence - no time, no object, no sight, or site, or citation,
memory gone from memory, hipster gone-world, nothing to record [it].)

Does memory mean the world?
Does meaning remember the world?

Are you working within a space or architecture of memories? What is the 
place of the memory? Tennessee says it's similar to a dream in that it 
has a place; bits and pieces come forward the more one talks. Jennifer 
says it's not exactly a shallow space, but a space of unfoldings, sub- 
terranean poolings. Tennessee says it's as if it were on a big flat 
fabric, as if there were a surface to that fabric - there are layers and
layers - there is a surface element - what you can see is what comes to
the surface - it appears two-dimensional - Tennessee can imagine it has
many dimensions. Tennessee sees depth because her mind tells her it's 
there, but the surface of it is flat, and the mind goes way past flat. 

Is the world a pool gathered on the surface of a slight incline?
Do you swim down the incline, do you crawl back, gasping for air?

Folds and fabrics intersecting a flat surface... In that sense, Jennifer
says, you only see a portion of it at once, but it also shares a lot of
characteristics with, say, the Rococo. There aren't vistas, but turned
away into corners or traveling across corners or paths. (Think of the Asam
Brothers.) I think of the Rococo as encrusted, interrupted. Tennessee
thinks of finding, uncovering, digging up. The incrustation is almost par-
adoxical I say, because you look at the surface and are stopped by it, but
at the same time, it hides and produces an indefinite feeling of depth.

Are there petals for the flowers, spikes for the stems?
Are there petals for the stems, stems for the spiked petalled flowers?

Jennifer wants to ask Tennessee about dichotomies, male and female, sun
and moon, in and out. She says they could be passed off as storybook-
like, but then, there are spirals, plants, leaves, limbs, spheres, statues
that are morphing - in fact says Jennifer, the whole thing is morphing -
but Tennessee says is striking a nerve, even though a little corny. As if
they're archetypes, or a mood, the music or whole visuals, the timing
creates. Tennessee feels there is something emotional and wet that allows
one to have a fantasy - that allows one to have a place in one's sexual
being, in a non-judgmental way.

Are there fantasies when gleaming are objects dreaming?
Are objects waking in fantasies, always becoming-objects?

Jennifer says she prefers the moon route to the sun route in Scrutiny.  
That she was almost repulsed by the sun route. Tennessee says most people
did the sun route, that it was clear and obvious. But I preferred the moon
route, said Jennifer, which was dark and then crescent and then dark
again. In Count, you move more with the sound input levels, and an image
of an egg, which is more diffuse, almost invisible at times. And in Count,
even the cursor's movements change gridlines, move faces ever so slowly
across the screen, change whole countries, as if they remained the same
only slightly different thereafter. 

Is one always out of focus, always moving slightly differently?
Is there one moving, are there may moving ones and manies?

Jennifer asks Tennessee about mysticism. Do you, Tennessee, see a spirit-
ual element to your work? Tennessee says what do you think. I think yes,
but I'm always suspicious of the same, what kind of space it's taking me
to. Tennessee says that Scrutiny is full of archetypes, but Jennifer says
they're so piled up and torn apart that they're capable of widely varying
readings. Rough sky in the background with the Planter and the Potter and
the seeds which looked like stars with sky in them and the Pot looking
like a mirror, which I related to the mirror in Shinto. Tennessee says
that many of the images are like cutouts, but for Jennifer, the cutouts
are always as if they're on the move or disassociating from each other.
Nothing _coheres_ except the space and time in their entirety - things
move and split off, ruptured, tearing, in silence against brilliant music.
The surface crinkles, morphs, comes back to the place where it had been -
once the moon was clicked, the sun was clicked. You never go anywhere
except inside, Jennifer said. Tennessee says the animations don't change
anything, which she finds annoying (depending on whom she's looking at it
with), but I find the lack of change intensive, going deeper.

Is lack of change that very slight change that returns to lack?
Is the fullness of being that knowledge of very slight change?

It's always the pace of the world, a world, Jennifer says, in which I find
myself dispersed among glittering in the dark, and spirals, leaves, text
curled down the page, mothers-fathers everywhere, turns towards births and
deaths, the round of existence, sphere of everything that is.

Are you Jennifer, Tennessee?
Are you Tennessee, Jennifer?

Jennifer gives this to Tennessee to read.

Tell me what you look like. So what do you look like. How does the skin

flesh from the ridges of the skull, cheeks raised or lowered hung from
arches. Where do your shoulders slope to the ground, muscles holding up
arms. Where do they join the neck. Where does the musk smell of your
breasts. What beneath them hidden in shadow. What planes of abdomen and
belly. What stomach shunts down. Tell me the secret of your cock, loose
balls, labia, cunt. What the scents are. From what distance. Thighs and
thick cordons of legs. Spindle-legs, knees swollen with weight, flown up

the lens, our hearing gone. Tell me the body pitching forward, the planet
rolling towards what hair. What long hair, what cut, short or hung. Tell
me what it feels like to lie with you. What protrusions. The cut of bone.
Those moments where the skin stops. Where the skin joins hidden lakes
inside. The slope and length of your clitoris. Your toes, navel, their
moisture. The shape of your nails on my back. What you look like from your
back, coming toward me. How your neck turns your head in my direction. The
scents of your ass, creases and folds around your hole. Thrust and energy
of your spine. Shoulder-blades cutting air. Heat arising like a sheathe.
The cut of your mouth. Your teeth sinking into me. So what do you look

So tell you


Tell you what you look like. So what do you look like. How does the skin
stretch across your bones. It slopes, thickens around the waist, thins
around the skull. How do the bones curl. A slight stoop towards the
ground, embarrassed or withdrawn expression on my face. How do the lips
hang flesh from the ridges of the skull, cheeks raised or lowered hung
from arches. Full lips, non-descript cheeks. Where do your shoulders slope
to the ground, muscles holding up arms. Fear of little weakling boy, weak
muscles, strong fingers and legs. Where do they join the neck. Thin neck.
Where does the musk smell of your breasts. Around the nipples, sweat, very
little to erect. What beneath them hidden in shadow. Slight paunch. What
planes of abdomen and belly. Sloped down to the groin. What stomach shunts
down. Too full, odd habits of eating. Tell you the secret of your cock,
loose balls, labia, cunt. Long cock, circumcised, thin. What the scents
are. Strong at times, sweat, urine, arousal. From what distance. Through
the clothes. Thighs and thick cordons of legs. Thighs sloping towards the
groin. Spindle-legs, knees swollen with weight, flown up with anorexia.
Bird legs. Tell you your eyes shuddered to a halt. Glasses, teary in the
morning. To the weakness of the lens, our hearing gone. Poor vision, good
hearing, ears often blocked. Tell you the body pitching forward, the
planet rolling towards what hair. Full hair, body often hunched, too much
looking at the ground. What long hair, what cut, short or hung. Various,
hair medium short now. Tell you what it feels like to lie with you. Pain-
ful. What protrusions. Erect cock. The cut of bone. Arms surround you.
Those moments where the skin stops. Bending towards you. Where the skin
joins hidden lakes inside. Mouths, open penis, asshole. The slope and
length of your clitoris. Lost, memory. Your toes, navel, their moisture.
Thin, flooded. The shape of your nails on my back. Long, parallel,
streaked. What you look like from your back, coming toward you. Ass too
full. How your neck turns your head in my direction. Slow and desperate.
The scents of your ass, creases and folds around your hole. Deeper musk,
cracks, too many folds, too open. Thrust and energy of your spine. Very
slightly stooped. Shoulder-blades cutting air. Neck-pain, shoulder-pain.
Heat arising like a sheathe. Protect you. The cut of your mouth. Too full,
too wide. Your teeth sinking into you. Too crooked, too many. So what do
you look like. How you sound. How your breathing sounds. So is that you.
What is it you want to know.

that expansion or decay, or frozen radiation. this the hinge of unhinging,
the brief space to state the case of the world, brief time to absorb it.
and others as well have felt the same. one cannot speak in fact of anni-
hilation (bad faith) when there is nought to annihilate, no leverage, no
mirror or node at the heart of the world. i think of yad vashem, hand and
name, an institution attempting to record those who died in the holocaust.
i think we are living in the holocaust. i really do. others, too, think
thus. such would be the case before the heat-death cold-death, mirrors of
the real, premonition humans carrying out what horrors of what (bad and)
violent faith. knowing every word or kenning, engraved in stone or magne-
tic domain, is fated to disappear. as if there were the presence of the
telling or the name of an emanation disappearing, which references the
future anterior of a recording, looking back with sorrow. none such, of
course, and nothing forgotten. many others have said they feel that way.
the world has never had the capacity to remember. one learns this in the
act of dying. we are all dying. we are all already dead. many feel the
same.

why i'm dead meat, by jennifer


Republicans ooze from their heads what is left of soul's rubbish 
i could not stand to be in a room with one of them 
they are objects for me, they reek of flesh gone sour 
i would be a lichen to their rock, corroding their violent granite
they would kill everyone with guns and they are all white men,
every last one of them, no matter what drear affirmation.
white men filled with dead pus: they stomp the children of the poor,
rape pollution laws, guarantee we'll drown the world in poison.
we're raped with rusted guns from world war two three four,
while they fight the righteous fight against women sex longing -
holding dead children on sticks to slap us with, banner banner
big money big money.
i couldn't stand to party with righteousness
i couldn't stand to fuck righteousness but their holes are closed
they have no holes, shit leaks from their mouths, 
piss leaks from their eyes, they write vomit
they are a real danger, never forget this, behind words 
are guns and mobs and real men, you never forget a real man
when you look into his dead dead eyes, when you see a Republican
on the road, kill it, it is not quite human.

- Jennifer

(don't take my name in) Vanna White (by Vanna White!)


Here I am watching Wheel of Fortune and there is Vanna White apparently
turning the letters over when the contestant guesses correctly. But in
fact, the letters are on television monitors, and Vanna just walks by the
screen, lightly touching it. I think she gestures towards it, nothing
more. You can't really see. The cameras keep the eyes and I's at a dis-
tance. Of course an engineer does the work behind the stage. It's like
Milli Vanilli years ago. I begin to wonder about virtual jobs. Years ago I
was on a kibbutz in Israel with a group of other students. We spent a busy
few days clearing rocks from a field, then another busy few days putting
them back. 

Vanna walks back and forth among screens that would have been miracles
years ago. I think there _was_ a time when she'd actually turn the letters
over ("around"), can anyone remember? Now there's nothing, pure emptiness.
If we could only replace Pat Sajak himself, we'd have a perfect show, ex-
cept for the contestants.

It seems to me we should have virtual postwomen and postmen to deliver our
email. Sysadmins are as close to virtual as they can be; we write to post-
master@ in general to protest abuse. Soon, we'll have virtual readers as
well; any mail filter is already on the way. To filter spam, something has
to read and decide that yes, *Make Money Now!* is not from Cybermind, or
is it? Meanwhile, Vanna does her job admirably; there's a quick cutaway to
the Channel 7 NewsTeam, "News" "Team," who virtually re-port on virtual
news. They're waiting for Vanna to finish walking back and forth so they
can virtually speak their virtual thing. Vanna actually _does_ walk, al-
most until the credits.

I'm getting _really_ sick. Exercise: Name all the virtual jobs you can
think of. Why are they virtual? Is your job virtual? Are you? Don't "you"
just love these questions? Who are "you" anyway? (Please, _no_ comments
on "society of the spectacle," "simulacrum," "hyperreality," and so forth. 
We just want the virtually "Absolute Truth.")

SPAM/AOL


Recently I joined AOL to have a portal to telnet into panix when I'm on
the road. There was no mail in my AOL account (except for writing to a
friend); last night I went into two chats (one on authors and one for
artists). Today the Inbox was full of spam, all internal to AOL. What
amazes me about the following is its personal aspect - more insidious 
than usual. I had about 40 of these messages on a relatively 'off' night. 
There was nothing else.


(1)
Hi, what's your name? I tried to instant message you but you had them
turned off :(. Well, when you turn them on, im me. I would love to chat,
and maybe even get together sometime! My name is Lisa and I just moved to
your state from France, where I was a Playboy model. Now I need someone to
show me around. If you would like to see what I look like then visit my
page, just click on the link. I got plenty of pics! Dont forget to instant
message me!          - Lisa

(2)
Hi.  I finally scanned that pic I promised you.  Sorry it took so long.
Well
I put it up on my webpage so come take a look if you have time. <a

(3)
Hi. I think we went to school together. I haven't been keeping in touch
because i moved far away to a different city. I am going to be home for
the holidays. Do you remember Jenny? She's probally going to pick me up
from the airport but things haven't been finalized yet. Click here  for
more info about me and my recent picture that I scanned. love, me

ps. Click here if you think I am Emailing the wrong person.

(4)
Hey, this is Katrina, I saw you in the chat room, but I didn't have time
to chat.  Here's a site about me and some of my horny friends!CLICK HERE.
IM Me if you like what you see! Later...

(5)
hello, i am new to the aol comunity. I think I made a link, can you click
here and reply back and tell me it works please.

(6)
You have recieved this email because you were
reffered by someone!
If you are interested in: HARD CORE XXX PICS- click here.
If you are interested in: Hot Teen Babes- click here.
If you are interested in: Hot Teen Sex- click here.
If you are interested in Male 4 Male- click here.
female 4 female- coming soon

(7)
Hi~!! It's Me! remember?? well, anywayz....heres the pic i promised you,
sorry it took so long but, click here to check em' out. BYE! love ya!

(8)
hi baby, its me chrissy, i just wanted to let you know about where you can
see my latest SEXY PICS....  CLICK HERE FOR THEM now!  hehe, hope you
enjoy....  and don't forget, membership is FREE so sign up TONIGHT!!


So many of these appeal to an apparently 'authentic' communality, at var-
iance with the production of marketing chats on the Web. Yet they do the
same thing, only with greater depth: subjectivity is primordially consti-
tuted as capital, available in relation to truth and history.

Playing Shamisen (An Odd Editorial)


Shamisen ties me to the world. My online life is often painful - too much
of the virtual, too many projections and introjections. I will lose myself
in you, lose myself in an imaginary that bleeds from the walls. At night,
sleep dissipates across it; the imaginary takes the flesh and binds it to
the wires. 

Shamisen plays against that, plays an insistent rhythm that lines up what
might be processes, not things - and operators, not states. The rhythm of
the real, articulated structures relate to the uneven divisions of the
fingerboard. The fingerboard positions correspond to a dialectic of phy-
sics and culture. Labor moves through the structures which are always in
relation to pausological constraints - the trajectory tending gesturally
towards completion. The fingers ensure or obviate that completion. Sound
fills the space; it's the fulfillment of the space. Shamisen resonance can
operate with hard onset, the spike of the fingernail or plectrum hitting
the skin and string close to simultaneous; the result is spatial echo-lo-
cation situating the body. From the nail, in other words, to the body in
space.

And it's always the phrase, or phrase of phrases, in relation to short-
and long-term memories: just as the sound spreads and reverberates in
space, so does the phrasing resonate in time. Such repetition or trajecto-
ry is of the maternal, a matrix of processes and operations. Sound flows
through the human, interconnecting organism with the real. It recuperates
the place of self in the world, particularly in relation to the labor of
fingers, hardness of the wood neck, delicacy of the body. And playing fast
goes further than this, is a way to shape-ride the real, project outwards
what just glimmers.

I think of the comparative pain of online relationships; I think of the
shamisen and the relative 'honesty' of playing music; out of tune is _out
of tune,_ and projection is always already ikonic in the real. (I'd call
it indexical in the virtual.) In this way, music has, on occasion, saved
me, and when I visit new friends in their apartments, I always look for
instruments. As one expects, of course, they're increasingly replaced by
cd players, other stereo paraphernalia, that reproduce consumption; one's
projection is equivalent to one's introjection, with capital, as usual,
providing the momentum. Still, every so often a body and sound, body of
sound and a sound body will emerge with all the scrapes and inhalations
and clatter that accompany acoustic instruments. I can hear myself through
their fashioning, and in an odd way, indeed, I'm healed.

Her Take on Things


'"I can't really speak for Jennifer," said Alan. "You'd have to ask her
how she feels." Alan continued, "I mean I can write how she feels about
things, but that would be me writing, do you know? Not her. And I'm uncom-
fortable speaking for her. There are the usual issues of hegemonic dis-
course; there has to be some way to countermand them." Later that after-
noon, he ran into Jennifer, and she concurred. "I can handle myself," she
said. "I'm smart as hell, articulate too. And believe me, I'm sensitive to
my emotions." Then Jennifer asked if, when she spoke for herself, talking
about how she felt about this and that, whether the speaking was anything
more than words, more than a tape-recorder turned on and off in response to
questions. "Or an intelligent bot," she said. Alan wasn't sure; he was
trying as hard as can be to write everything down. "I wonder if I feel
anything anymore, myself. I'm almost catatonic, a writing-machine. I've
become a function." "You mean my function," said Jennifer. "An existence-
function in any case," Alan replied,' said Nikuko.

Elemental Homeland


In bifurcation diagrams of the driven pendulum, and other relatively sim-
ple equations, there are domains where chaos will suddenly collapse to a
single line, as if part of the diagram has been wiped out. The following
is an example. [To run, save the program as bifur.bas and in DOS type
qbasic /run bifur.bas. If you have Windows 95, you might not have qbasic;
it's easily imported from Win 3.1.]

REM CHAOS BIFUR bifurcation set for function w/cosine
INPUT "set increment at .01 or .005"; m
CLS : SCREEN 11: WINDOW (-4, 2)-(.25, -4)
z = -4: x = 0
LINE (-4, 0)-(.25, 0): LINE (0, 2)-(0, -4)
two:
IF t < 30 THEN t = t + 1 ELSE GOTO three
x = (x ^ 2) * (1 + COS(x)) + z
PSET (z, x)
GOTO two
three: x = 0
z = z + m
t = 1
GOTO two

The diagram presents a gap or quick descent from the left towards the 
origin; on the other side of the gap, there is an almost immediate rise 
towards chaos. Within the gap, a more-or-less singular solution. Out-
side, chaos in which the slightest perturbation of initial conditions
creates widely dissimilar results.

For a moment, the single determinate response. These regions fascinate me,
harbingers of a mathematical absolute in the midst of the chaos of the
world; even within the chaotic responses, there are bands of probable
results. I see in these the icons of postmodernity - dispersions that tend
to collapse, expand, accumulate, reduce to relative singularities, as if a
primordial structure of the world were announcing itself through otherwise
overwhelming information.

We gravitate towards these cases of the limit, towards cases in which
variance is frozen and totality takes over. Think of them as mother-father
structures in which there is a maternal chora or container reducing in-
stability to the comfort of the womb - and in which the container appears
as a phallic singularity or origin, from which chaos might disperse. These
lineages are irreversible; one can't proceed temporally backwards - but
one can always have the dream or imaginary of the Solution on the horizon
of his or her subjectivity.

(I call such an imaginary an _elemental_ - in this case the collapse or
expansion of chaotic space to a singularity. In this way, one can speak of
links and couplings, emissions and emanations - and their epistemologies.
Think of an elemental as an awkward morphology, pre-topological, pre-topo-
graphic. The motility of the Kristevan chora is composed of elementals, as
are the general morphologies of this universe. I can speak thusly, be-
cause, beyond the dream, elementals are practically useless; however, they
figure strongly in the equally awkward processes of the mind. Think of the
cohesiveness of the overdetermined narratology of the dream or fairy-tale,
both of which might be considered collapses from chaos - as if narrative
itself could only exist within a potential well.)

It's the homeland; it's the sudden collapse of the world; it's the death-
drive and the suturing of the cycle of birth and death; it's the signifer
transforming couplings (concatenations) into linkages (causes and ef-
fects); in short, it's the transformation of "a" into "the" and the begin-
ing of the _thing._ Embracing postmodernity, we await its end - full of
the knowledge of useless hope. The limits, singularities, are few and far
between; chaos reigns - and even within the limit, there are uneasy ques-
tions about the political problematic that results. Only the Right feels
it can afford collapse; home-owners' associations and exclusionary clauses
of all sorts are prime examples. The rest of us are making-do, victims and
entrepreneurs of eternal bricolage.

Talking Life (Literally Fleshing Out)


1 Talking about the projection/introjection of emotion on the Net
  (whose emotion?)
  Emotion on the Net is always already embodied and equivalent to any 
  other embodiment. Every aspect of the Net is identically embodied.
  (Think of this as an identity politics, not an equivalence politics.)

1A Levels of embodiment: Syntactic / Semantic / Projective/Introjective
  (What constitutes talking/seeing the online body - what constitutes
  _being_ the online body. Every representation is a scan, raster, file.
  Every representation approaches the continuum; every representation is
  full of holes.)

1Ai Levels:
  a. Protocols, bits and bytes: grammars, scripts, programs, errors,
     core dumps, indexicalities
  The Bones
  b. Performatives, comprehensions, iconics 
  The Organs
  c. -Jectivities, embodiments, resonances, symbolics
  The Mind

2 Talking about 1/2/3/other person on chats etc.
  a. Space-orientations (ytalk, icq, powwow): I am here, you are there
  a1. Time-orientations (irc, chat): I follow you, you follow me 
  b. Dispersed space of the body - multi-MOOing, avatars (spacings)
     Lag (timing)

3 My own work with jennifer, julu, nikuko as system interrupts, resonances
  - _effusions_ - pushing towards psychosis - author and authority
  a. Moving into abjection, loss of body, body repair, experiential.
  b. Emanation, splay, dispersion, gain of body, prosthesis.

4 Considering the future of the Net as 'seamless virtual reality,' the
  interpenetrations and mixups on the Holodeck - Jennifer writing Alan,
  jennifer-function, body-function, quantum-logic superimpositions

5 I will be working from notes/outline, not a completed paper - the
  relation of the body to speech is integral for me - (What of the
  speaking body online, what of the online body?)


___________________________________________________________________________



Musing on Elementals


Having spoken of elementals as qualitative morphological changes, such as
collapse to or expansion from, singularities (into and out of chaos or
other bifurcation regimes), I now retreat from 'elemental,' which is far
too mythologizing, too harrowing. For I do not mean to imply anything be-
yond _elementary,_ that these are primitive operations, perhaps - not
primitives themselves. Negation is a primitive (as well as an operation);
what might be called a spurt or collapse isn't, at least in the same
sense. On the other hand, it might be worthwhile to construct a logic of
spurts and collapses, splits and sutures - a _viscous_ logic between, say,
standard fuzzy logic and the propositional calculus. Call this the calcu-
lus of _rills_ ("small streams, runnels, or rivulets"), which have a ten-
dency towards whitewater, mini-waterfalls, bifurcations, desiccation as
well. In other words, _eliminate the primordial_ in favor of the imaginary
and see what results. Such a logic could be developed temporally or not;  
if so, for example, a bifurcation of a bifurcation is still a bifurcation,
(bi*bi = bi), while a singularity from a bifurcation is a singularity
(bi*si = si). In fact we have in general (xy = y); the system has no memo-
ry. If however, we proceed in terms of non-temporality we might send fuzzy
markers through a network, and wonder about their potential appearance at
any point. Again, this seems simple; if there are X number of paths, then
the overall appearance at any path might be 1/X, unless the paths are
weighted. There's no need for a special logic here.

In fact we see that the logic is always close to useless, and relates to
fuzzy set theory. Instead, perhaps, one might speak of contractions and
expansions (tied into couplings and linkages presented elsewhere), lend-
ing themselves towards collapses and spurts, splits and sutures. We might
insist that these operations aren't necessarily the basis of logic, but
the quality of the world itself. We might add annihilations and creations
to complete the morphological taxonomy. We might find ourselves close to
Heraclitus at this point.

Not Elementals, Indescribable Whats


(4)If not primordials, not elementals, indescribable whats, imaginaries,
you might think of a _singularity_ as a name, you might think of a _chao-
tic domain_ as Jennifer (you never know!), you might think of clean bifur-
cations or splits as hypertextings. Then Jennifer is already past or prior
to the name, and what's Jennifer? Think of a conflation of _tellings_ or
strands, think of irruptions, momentary forgetfulnesses within the strands
- all within the chaotic domain. Then are we looking into the movements,
say, of the damped(1) and driven(2) pendulum(3)?

(1)wetted, slowed, Jennifer returning speech to silence, silence to touch,
touch to taste, taste to ground(4)
(2)driven, heated, Jennifer interfering with systems resonances
(3)pendulum, pendulous, Jennifer rocking back and forth, echolalias across
applications, eddying rings(5)

(5)Spreading out, spanning (bandwidths), borderline personalities frayed
at the edges, margins, potential wells.

Swollen tumescences, convexities; meniscus lenses, sinusoidal meanderings:
dependent upon metric geometries. But not the meanderings themselves. Well
Jennifer might put it this way, there are so many tellings, they make a
space, even though it doesn't seem like one. You've got to add the proto-
cols to make everything visible, Peirce's sheet of assertion at the least.
But the tellings don't need that, don't need the breathings, well only for
you to see or hear or touch or taste or smell them. But that's an emana-
tion.

   ALAN
   
   It was late at night, Jennifer busy on the Machine, and she thought,
   this is my very first time. Lately she had been feeling ill-at-ease,
   as if something were about to burst forth in her life, What fun!
   Jennifer loved Fun more than anything, and this, whatever it would be,
   promised the most Fun of all!
   
   I will play with wonderful Rabbits I will make on my Machine, thought
   Jennifer, and soon they were bouncing around the room, ever so lovely.
   These are the Rabbits of my Making, thought Jennifer, wondering why
   she had no memory of her birth or even her life five full minutes ago!
   
   Soon, she will find a Wonder-Program that will talk to her. She does
   find the program and it begins, Hello, my Name is Alan, and I have an
   amazing Telling for you. I will begin the Telling.
   
   "Jennifer sat down on the green grass. It was 1917 and the War was on.
   She could hear the War in the distance and always thought it was so
   amazing, like Thunder, yet John and Molly had both been taken. That is
   what her mother had said, 'been taken,'" said Alan, and Jennifer,
   ever-so wondering replied, but it is not 1917, it is much later than
   that, and there are now Flowers on the Grass, and all of them are
   Lovely me.
   
   "The Sun is alive," said Alan, "surely it is. Jennifer thought it was
   a beautiful Sun," and how lovely it illuminated Jennifer's Machine,
   tired and very full from making Rabbits.
