processes, returning to the process that is if the "there you are" func-
tions as a practical signifier reaching an entropic balance with scien-

for scientists. the mistake lies here. but if there were an absolute
signifier speaking it would certainly imply an approach and even possible

February 22, 1987, my worst nightmare

http://www.alansondheim.org/accident.png

I flew from Dallas to New York to show work.
In Dallas my best friend took my car out to 
get beer. About nine cars were totalled.
I was held responsible because I owned the car.
I hadn't given him permission to use it.
We never spoke again. Damages were at least
$ 750,000. To this day I don't know what 
happened to the other drivers.

Fractals, Stalker, and Texts*


http://www.alansondheim.org/NYU4/ qbasic and other files

The Fractals are fractal paths, produced from Qbasic programs I wrote; 
they're related to measure geometries, the kind of comb geometry you find 
on a ruler. The Stalker is a found object. The three texts are just that, 
short one-page texts. I've been going through my archives at NYU (New York 
University), and these emerged. The Fractals were completed about 15 years 
ago; the Stalker, earlier still, and the texts, earlier still. The 
Fractals led to a fair amount of writing about symmetries; the Stalker led 
to nothing; the texts led to more texts and more texts...
