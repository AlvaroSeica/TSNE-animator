heavy gears engaged the titanium studs and ties.
driven by heat, the gears pushed hard in the opposite direction.
the circulation engine resisted tremendous compression.
slowly the asteroid began to rotate against the force of the rockets.
sondheim noticed the gears beginning to saw away at the studs and ties.
the gears cracked and collapsed, welding the engine to the rails.
the rotation of the asteroid slowed to a halt.
the firing of the rockets now welded to the rails had the desired effect.
almost imperceptibly, the asteroid began to rotate in the opposite

visibly, it began to pick up speed.

performance text improvisation - New Jersey Institute of Technology -
5/7/02

(not satisfied with this; it lacks the structure of the others; we've just
arrived in new york; i was following suit; i was doing my best - thanks to
Chris Funkhouser who brought me - i was trying my hardest)

===

we're all waiting for a sign...

these are asteroids, camera fly-byes (fly-bies?) - fly bees... across
three-dimensional spaces created in Blender - www.blender.nl

my work's concerned with language, sexuality, the virtual body and
subjectivity - all of these elements interacting online and off -

i'm concerned with what happens beneath the surface, the coding, the
psychoanalytics, the substances

i'm concerned about messes, tangles, messiness, entanglement ...

all of this work is tangled,confused - these images are from the
everglades. we went into them about 2-4 times a wekk or so, thats week,
that's that's - not wekk... i was interested in messiness and the way that
everything was both about desire - for us, obsessiveness, and at the same
time an impenetrable ecosystem - the longer we were there, the more we
understood about the images - about what we were seeing - the intersection
of varis various biomes....

all playing into notinos on notions of language 9had too much coffee *
just got in from miami) - this is mime movie - azure (myh partner) and I
mimed for the camera - working through what were the "usual" black box -
getting out of glass, swimming, up and down stairs, that sort of thing -
so that what's present is a kind of languaging, no?

a language of mime that's otherwise silent; this was getting poretty
boring to us so we sped things up and went to hell...

it fascinates me to be able to work withdifferent rates of movement/voice
in all of this - as if there are different worlds emerging.

early on we did some work emphasizing this with foofwa d'immobilite, who
had danced with merce cunningham - arranged a piece in which myh voice
triggered his traditional ballet movement to the point of exhaustion...

i've been fascinated by dance and its relation to desire, and a way to
think through the body without spoken language or discretge symbols - you
have the same difficulties here that you do with film "language" - what
constitutes a wor d or phoneme, how do0es tradition play out when
tradition is something that escapes discrete symbols?

on top of which dance is HARD - difficult to do - there's labor involved -
and there's labor in spoken language and written language and
production/distribution in every sense of the term....

so we were pushing for this - what amounted to a deconstruction of dance
through dance - turning dance (like everything else here) into a mess -

how does one create/approach a mess?

we were playhing charactgers that are avatars I use online - nikuko the
russian ballet dancer and doctor leopold konninger, a name that came to me
in a dream.

konninger comes out of Grosz's drawings of pre-war and otherwise Germany -

he has a monacle but I never wore one.

he and nikuko were involved together in a round-robin relationship - she
would dance for him and he would pay her - it was a continuous pirouette -
again the labor/money context is clear - here is a part of the sequence -
all of this earlier work, about a year ago or so, revolves around body and
flesh - issues of skin and interior -

in florida, the everglades dominated. there are few tourists at this
point; they're almost abandoned at times. you can walk in the middle of
the night through miles of swamp and no one is around at all. you'll find
insects and other fauna you've never seen before. at first you focus on
safety and alligators and snakes; then you begin to descend into the
layers, moving more and more into a submerged landscape almost out of J.G.
Ballard, a landscape of surreal dimensions. These bugs you see for example
- I have not been able to find them in any book at all - no one knows what
they are. This butterfly is the atala, an endangered species, extremely
rare - this goes on and on - from the fauna then back to the landscapes
themselves which change subtlely

the park is created from organisms - there are no geological features
readily visible; everything you see is alive, beneath your feet, or on
occasion overhead ..

we played obsessively out here, first filming ourselves in the
environment, merging sexuality, then trying to read the codes and then
finding the codes deeper and deeper, almost as if they were a series of
circular passages in a moo or mud...

eventallly we produced SEALS - based on ideograms referencing breath,
sexuality, circularity, exhaustion - these have become a foundation or
rather reference for the rest of the work -

in seals, there are five cameras; they're triggered by the sound. the man
writes on the woman, seals her it with a chop/hanko. the woman writes on
the man, filling his body with signs; the sign for negation just above the
genitals.

the man writes on the woman, just as otherwise.

the woman seals the man.

but before the sealing: erasure, as the bodies flood each other, erasing
symbol/image simultaneously - again the relationship to desire and
language is obvious.

my work is idiotic; it covers the same ground over and over. but it's
clever in its use of masquerade and disguise, as if new things were being
constantly discovered.

On the left you just saw the death of a digital camera in the everglades
after swamping a canoe... the rest of the images are with another -

with quicktime, sound moves from foreground channel to foreground channel;
it can be set otherwise, but muddies...

on the left, black mangrove thicket in the northern everglades.

this is our ever-popular welcome to miami film.

(We hated miami.)

cattail swamp - which is useful for cleaning out pollutants as part of the
everglades reconstruction project...

as if we're on ecstasy or as if we're collapsing....

how does this fit together?

it doesn't - or rather it's a question of approaching things. I'm
intersted in that - how one approaches things, particuolarly things that
are a mess - messy relationships, messy bodies, messy environments - which
of course begs the question - one has to learn to listen to the begging -
one has to study it.. my work has moved in a strange way out of language.
it's always been at war with words, with thinking language through and
through, using shell accounts, unix/linux, and hundreds of editing/coding
tools - well dozens, anyway.

but faced with bodies, with desire, with tangles, how does language work -
without listening, and without the foreclosing that language of course
always implies? it's better not to name things for a while - particularly
in these difficult political times when names are useful for the raveling
of hatreds on a universal scale... these are images of a desiccated lake
in the everglades dry season - a tricolored heron hunting - a coastland
prairie here - black mangrove roots - crfab carapace, marsh hare, turkey
vulture, cypress dome -

the environment changes over a height of inches - the cypress dome is
partially submerged. the highest point in the everglades is four feet -
where you might have pinelands or hardwood hammocks. this is the cypress
dome, wandering through one. and these are exotic mating muscovie ducks
and we'll end with this I think? already a foreign intrustion (these
ducks) into the everglades, rendering everything problematic once again -

================================


(the closing of the work)


    the phenomenology of approach


    = approaching the everglades, the city, illness, language, culture =

a text written in spurts, after the outline, chasing down, encapsulating, 
circumventing. what is an approach? how does approach manifest itself to 
the subject? what is the domain of the approach? what is a domain? what is 
subjectivity? what is its presence and loss?

     0  intermittent text
the text of dispersal. sections are written into and out of the outline. 
the text is governed by the outline. subsequent versions increase the 
quantitative content, refine the tolerance of the investigation. the text 
is an accumulation or collocation of interspersions.

     1	domain limited or unlimited
a limited domain is inscribed with or without fuzzy boundaries. domains 
may be limited in sememe, space, and/or time. example: everglades bounded 
by hydrology, ecosystem. for example (below): everglades younger than 
writing, than human inscription. for example (below): the scribble: 
scribbled note, indecipherable handwriting, noise in the machine. the 
state/meant of the domain is always already a delimitation. (limits are 
closed sets in relation to the rest of the world/s, worlding.)

     2	clues and cues from immemorial past
a clue is an interpretable symptom, according to a scheme based on an 
articulated methodology. a cue is the activation of a scheme based on an 
anomaly or repetitive structure within the domain. the domain in turn may 
be defined by clues and cues.

     3	difference between clues and cues
a clue is based on evidence from the past to the present; a cue is based 
on activation within the present.

     4	relevance theory and approach
clues and cues are such by virtue of relevance; theoretical methodology is 
part of a critical sifting apparatus. relevance is already a complex 
construct, ranging from variegated retinal firings to stratifications of 
attention.

     5	top-down classification schema
this follows for example category theory, chaos/fractal theories; one 
always already begins with pre-theoretic presuppositions. the schemes 
obscure as well as clarify; they override heuristics, average anomalies 
and noise. as with approach, they are always a detour in this regard; they 
counteract the information implosion of nominalism.

     6	wonder, innovation, contradictions
beginning with a sense of awe - everything signs everything, everything 
inscribes. innovation in terms of heuristic projections and introjections 
- contradictions in terms of anomalies, revisions, recuperations, returns.
wonder is a washing, determinate sublime, approach across the edge of the 
cliff, reworking binding and boundary.

     7	deep ecologies, interstitial 
the ecologies become perceptually deeper; gaps are filled in; one lives in 
depth in the glades, aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local 
histories, individual plants and animals. think of messy thickets as 
sheaves; partial separations tend towards partial separations. format 
information formats, format information. the habitus tends towards 
experience.

     8	filling in the habitus
from larger to smaller clues and cues - alligators and wading birds to 
landbirds and invertebrates for example. as one moves down in scale, 
identification becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible.

     9	from anomaly to behaviors
and back again; behavior clusters based on attributes. or from story to 
structure, diachrony to synchrony, anecdote to prediction.

    10	sense of occupation and intimacy
inhabitation based on familiarity, familiality. what is occupation without 
possession, the contract. intimacy forestalls occupation, the experiential 
relegating definition. but in another sense, that of familiar territory, 
'my work,' 'my walk,' 'my singing,' 'my song,' my process, my advance, my 
report and distribution.

    11	familiarity, familiality 
in the first, equivalence scripts and schemata, universals, typifications; 
in the second, identity scripts and experientials, individuations. in 
both, the failure of distributive aristotelian logics, in both the 
gestured and extrapolated indefinite bandwidth. (22)

    12	maternality
chora and matrix - the inchoate beneath the surface of the subject, the 
dominion of striations, vocalizations.

    13	deconstruction of the abject
disarticulation of the abject as such and rearticulation in terms of 
microstructure, skein. the muck and clutter in relation to marl/peat moss 
and biome or flora/fauna regimes. muck and clutter as regimes.

    14	phenomenology of naming
following the notion of rigid designators, beginning with classification, 
classification experience, virtual subjectivity and its relation to 
concrete manifestation.

    15	inarticulate inchoate
maternality: see above. the proffering of languaging or template. the 
inert real. the unspeaking, unspeakable, unspoken.

    16	the mess and its overcoming
entanglement as regime intrusions, conflicting biomes, collapse or 
implosion, niche-construction, problems of scale in space and time.
the mess overcoming.

    17	phenomenology of touch
demarcation of environment on the body - thicket tangle, poisonwood, 
against the skin. differentiation of the mass. eidetic reduction to the 
pressure of being.

    18	reinscription of domain
the domain _as_ continually inscribed in negotiation. linguistic contract 
of the subject. increasingly fuzzy boundary issues. refinement of 
differentiations - typology to decreasing tolerances.

    19	immersive and definable structures
definable is fully reversible; immersive is fuzzy, vectored. both are 
capable of meta-level collocations, i.e. a definable of definable, 
immersive of definable, etc.

    20	clue skeins
clues related theoretically, taxonomically, in terms of typifications, 
taxonomies - heuristic skeins, established on the run. partial skeins, 
tagged skeins, default tag skeins.

    21	the instrumental reason of flows and part-objects
fluid mechanics, turbulence, stases within the flow - non-equilibrium 
thermodynamics. the partitioning, parcelling, clutter, of the world. 
part-objects as modules: modules 'on the part of' the subject, and modules 
'defined as such' within the continually reinscribed domain.

    22	gestural logics and superimpositions
such that partial information (as in land's experiments re: color vision) 
extends across a total domain or spectrum.

    23	delaying conclusions and the settling-in of elements
inconclusivity of discourses which are increasingly refined. elements 
noticed and defined 'settle in' - in the sense of familiarity - always 
with default tags - i.e. elimination by counterexample. retention of _weak 
theory_ - searching for coherency without retention of apparently outmoded 
paradigms.

    24	continuous processing and absorption of anomalies
anomalies as generative of domain boundaries, entities, temporary 
inscriptions, potential of part-objects, etc. the anomaly as the mis-fit 
among the accountable and accounted-for. as unaccountable, uncounted, the 
anomaly generates circumscriptions, circumlocutions; these are involved by 
the subject in a consideration and absorption of the _detour._ every 
anomaly potentially turns everything around, and is turned around by 
everything.

    25	modes of approach in space and time
diachronic/synchronic approaches - space-time slices. diffusion of 
occluded layerings (bay bottoms versus onshore mangrove island 
topography). architectonics of the domain.

    26	horizons of 'natural' and 'unnatural' worlds
and horizons of 'subjective' and 'objective' worlds - in relation to 
heuristics and experiential structures (immersivities). definition is both 
tool and violation; mobile fuzzy domain boundaries participate in the 
natural (i.e. given) order as well as ideological political/economic 
conscious and unconscious considerations.

    27	weakening of perceptual structures and responses
approach is always already self-critical, self-critique; the critique 
itself is withdrawn from the self, sublimated into emergent considerations 
of the domain. the phenomenology of approach implies a weakness of 
language, definition, inscription, boundary, instrumental reason; it 
implies releasement, waiting (not waiting-upon) as well.

    28	releasement and listening
to listen without consideration of the source, the speech, one's answer; 
to avoid pausological structures ('yes, but...'); to speak after (what 
appears to be) the case.

    29	buildings, dwellings, and habitations
domains as fuzzy architectures, the build world, to the extent of the 
delimitation. dwelling, as in residing within the domain, within the 
subjective horizon of the experiential mode in relation to the domain. the 
domain as inhabited by the subject, wor(l)ds becoming 'natural' in the 
sense of familiarity, familiality.

    30	the neighborhood
it is the neighborhood, communality, the constitutes the increasing 
approach of the domain. to the extent of a phenomenology of approach, the 
domain is asymptotic, never fully approached. the neighborhood is a 
confluence of neighborhoods, intersections demographics, zones and zoning 
ordinances, ethnicities - just about any conceivable attribute, fuzzy or 
not (for example, families whose surnames begin with 'Mc'). the neighbor- 
hood is also a maternality, a comfort-zone, an occupation constituted by 
the participant's introjections and projections. neighborhood is created 
by their increasing coherency and stability, a homeostatic domain itself. 
the attainment of homeostasis involves mechanisms for absorbing anomaly, 
to the extent that anomaly becomes subsumed (i.e. this moth is an unknown 
species within the imperial silk family).

    31	intersecting populations and worlds
no domain is pure, no approach can posit an isolated object for long. 
skeins intermesh diachronically and synchronically, across disciplines and 
other semi-rigid boundaries of the classical episteme. domains possess 
symptomatic leakage and staining; there are stigma-zones, exhaustion 
zones, depletion zones, zones of surplus accumulations. what is posited as 
an object both diffuses and expands; becoming invisible, it participates 
within neighborhooding, worlding - becoming visible, it participates in 
skew-orthogonal skeining and the report.

    32	phenomenology of withdrawal
every approach is a withdrawal; what is known is known in recession. the 
decrease of tolerance is asymptotic at best. the greater the knowledge, 
the weaker the theory, heuristics coming more and more into play. there 
are dialectics among reifications, objectifications, subjectivities, 
reports and encapsulations, releases and experience, determinations and 
faltering data, anomaly. the phenomenology of approach embeds withdrawal, 
just as withdrawal implies approach. every introjection, a projection; and 
every projection, an introjection.

    33	the skein (skew-orthogonal)
the grid and its imposition, input-output matrices, markov chains, tensors 
and absorptions of data, local geodesics, fuzzy or clouded enumerations, 
collocations of data.

    34	the skein (askew and local)
the local scribble, local geodesics without embedding, fluid-mechanical or 
cellular automata modeling, closures, accumulations of data, local messes.

    35  increasing audacity and circumscription
one takes increasing chances as danger apparently recedes by virtue of 
knowledge. how to approach a snake or alligator; how to ward off deerflies 
and no-see-ums. an approach is always a detour (thus the sides, top and 
bottom, are in evidence); the domain, no matter how problematic, is both 
skein-connected (to its environs, history, etc., without and with 
observation, to taxonomic schema, ideologies, cultures and civilizations, 
and so forth) - and disconnected (to the extent that it is not 'its' 
intention that one approaches, that one makes the approach, that it is 
within one's horizon - but who knows). a detour may follow one or another 
walk-around, or it maybe be a confluence/manifold of the totality of 
walk-arounds - for example, the semi-totalities of gathering periphyton 
data in space time through selected sites, extrapolated across the glades 
in their entirety. 

    36  the report
for example: the everglades as we know them are younger than writing; this 
residue is older than that. the report is tailored to distribution modes, 
economics, audience, historiographies, symbolic conventions, bibliography 
and reference, dedication and authority, placement within or without 
various series, a particular written language, attendant taxonomic ploys, 
languages, and paradigms. 

    37  the distribution
the distribution of the report enters the field of reports, processes of 
reporting and distributing, checks and counter-checks. the report is 
always already a reification by virtue of peer and other consensus; this 
is the escape or leakage of the phenomenology of approach into profession, 
professionalism, and doxa.

    38  the thinking of it
and the rethinking of it, the arc through and across the report, response, 
distributions, counter-distributions, argument and counter-argument, the 
return to the field, the walking-through the field, and always already 
transformation of the domain and its problematic.

    39  the world of it
the world is all that is the case. but the world and worlding are 
dissimilar and 'the' already breaks down among virtual and real, virtual 
particles and introjections/projections, phantasms and implicate orders. 
nothing remains of encompassment; domains dissolve or problematize, just 
as the 'of it' - already a possessive - is another releasement. 

    40  the knowledge, experiencing of the knowledge
what recedes, becoming, not knowledge, but implicate, implicated, tacit. 
my boundaries, body, disappear, absent themselves, among the thickets. 
worlding wheels on virtual axes; id and ego merge mute. what was real and 
had become symbolic now recedes into the imaginary and real. skin and 
masquerade become one; abjection diffuses among bodies, waters, earths, 
islands, hammocks. enunciation is always a problem increasingly distant as 
one silences, the report long gone, having been written, distributed, 
critiqued, absorbed, discarded. those series or skeins have no place here; 
evanescent, they're already exhausted by consciousness and defuge. the 
leaving that is left is an accompaniment, future inhabitation of memory or 
visitation, minding, mindful. no longer the distance of the approach or 
proximity of withdrawal, but only translucency, transparency on rare 
occasion. imagining the glades, but not without myself diffused, laminar, 
here and there, the skitter.

One falls into it: the text, the river, the Everglades, the alligator-maw.
It's productive, a kind of tacit/muscular intelligence at work, an
approach silencing language, in the guise of increasing (incipient)
structure. Gaining knowledge, gaining footholds, listening.

No one speaking but myself, enunciated, as if from/of the park (as if/from

Scales have neither beginning nor ending, pointsets and bandwidth; one
begins somewhere, after all. But the beginning is always occluded - always
this differance as you say, a deferring, not to the sign, but to its
absence - an absence spelled out only in the metapsychology of the
subject. ...

-shifts, as it were? The metaphor strains, but it leads to an interesting
-situation of reading, in which 'formal' difficulties in reading apply
-pressure to a kind of tacit knowledge, "silencing language" -- arguably
-the situation of every reading, but 'more so' in this case; riskier --
-...

One might have a narratology without a reading, I think; the phenomenology 
of approach implies the former to the extent that there is a noticing, 
tending towards the intention to investigate, or at least approach - to 
reorient the mind and body towards (  ) - no matter how suffused (  ) is 
or appears to be. Even walking or a walk-around is a narration. 

One might consider an inordinately rough terrain - and then what happens? 
One's attention is consumed with keeping one's balance - almost nothing 
else is occurring, and any other goals or destinations - the teleology 
itself - may be put on hold, subsumed, reduced to a (default) tag in the 
subject's fuzzy scheme of things...

-Agreed -- but I wonder also if the psychoanalytic models -- projection
-etc --- might also be too reductive of what one might call the ecology of
-ideas, both in your texts and in the reading of them? As if the site were
-not that of fantasy or the ego but something that radically takes apart
-the ego, but 'speaks' nonetheless....

I don't think of the site 'taking apart' or 'speaking' - no such book of 
nature, etc. It's inert, real. Projection can be a diffusion or emission; 
certainly what's occurring in the phenomenology of approach is occurring 
within the subject, within the horizon of the subject - elsewhere, extern- 
ally, there's instrumental reason, etc. So I'm thinking of a broader meta- 
psychology, one of flows/flux/spew/emission as well (my notion of 'defuge' 
is related to this). As far as 'taking apart,' it's not as if the ego were 
assembled. In almost everything one does, it's absent (see Drew Leder); in 
a sense, neither it (nor id) nor the body are present -

[scales]

-And here the psychoanalytic -- at least the Lacanian -- is compelling --
-what is being addressed, what is addressing the subject in or in relation
-to the site (these sentences are difficult to write -- qualification on
-qualification)? The place itself fluctuates with stains, the screen....
[...]

Again, is the subject ever addressed? In the addressing of the subject, 
surely it's always the subject that's addressing, at least in the receiv- 
ing, if nothing else? A dead subject can never be addressed, at least in 
terms of interiority and horizon. The receptor is address.

I wrote a while ago about 'sm's - using sado-masochisms as a crude model 
for couplings and linkages, out of which worlding occurs. One might think 
of couplings and linkages in terms of the phenomenology of approach and 
the skein, embedding, distancing, etc. But that would be another text...

this time it was the loxahatchee, jacek and i overturned the canoe on a
three-foot drop, digital nikon overboard.

( it worked for a minute for a moment. 
( the card caught its dying breaths.
(  in the beginning, some lacewing eggs followed by a scale insect
(  then the clearing with paurotis, cypress, fern ( what might have been
(   ( an alligator hole ) )
(   then the clearing again
(    suddenly:
(    the switch: this was the portage route which we ignored
(    sondheim soaking, filmed with the dying camera
(     ( it seemed alive at that point, the images as usual
(     jacek by the canoe, clive and jane by the canoe
(   the next image is blurred, green, railing and water
(    the camera was dying
(    the lens, clouded, electronics shutting down
(     ( oh how i worked to retrieve the images! how many hours of
(     coaxing them from the card! )
(   following, the last retrievable series:
(    blue blurs through the ruined lens 
(      sondheim in mourning and recuperation 
(      the final image but one, the light
(      the final image, the car and its drowned technology

(      the madness of the image

   the camera struggled to rise, it couldn't
   the images leaked out, the shutter button released its last
   the poor and tiny screen lights and lights,  
   blind eye of the lens reaching out -
   here, look at this, but you will never own it
   those clouds, those lizard-eyes, that spider, this umbilical
   cut at last, untethered real floating off and on -
   i'm part of the blindness, i hold the camera like a baby
   the lens floats in and out, i can hear the breathing

   'the dying camera'

   you may have
   you may have the last images, they crawl, they remain
   in funeral, the card holding on, desperately
   the image, the image, the image
   silent, submerged

jennifer's dream of goodness

lacewings curled around each other in the doomed thicket.
they came to me and said, there is no competition; cut the cables.
the unseemly monotony of engines formed a distant phalanx.
already live-born young were the order of the day.
eggstrands transformed into protective grills.
poison occupied the tips of incessant life.
the contribution of the viruses was immense and not to be underestimated.
a second-order phalanx formed inside the mutated grills.
microscopic domains organized against the violence of the macro-world.
lacewing circulations, viral turbulence, across the sawgrass surface.
their stems bending slightly, sawgrass forests acquiesced to the power
of the thicket.
shudders went through skins of the mammalian order.
their live-born young died quickly of unknown contusions.
the phalanxes stilled among incessant life.
lacewings curled around each other in the order of the day.

the glades are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a
park with variable boundaries, problematic topography based on hydrology
and human intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glades as
an _inscribed surface_ transforming in space and time - a surface organic
and shifting. the glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life
and migration; they are vectored, and vector is everything.

geology is underfoot; to manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem. 
invisible topographies / geologies manifest by surface organism. the 
indefinite prolonging of comprehension.

scalding water stops the pain for a moment; the hammocks carry blood-lust

coastal prairie, one is accompanied by horse-flies, biting midges, wasps,
larger insects from a distance; chills and fevers wake one in night's
thick entanglement; one's body is a mess, suppurating, gouged and gnawed,
split, half-devoured.:deer-flies stinging constantly, the mosquito gouge,
sand midge extract. points of the body, usually ignored as implicit

anticipation of everglades, countries, dry-dusts and radiations - they
are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a crayfish,
aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local everglades underfoot - to
extensivity extrusions - familiality for example: the fall into it. the
glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life by souvenirs from
horizon interwoven and may be limited in everglades as in one text - the
hydrology, ecosystem. for example (below): everglades younger than data in
imagining the glades, but not without myself diffused, laminar, the glades
in limestone solution holes. refuge in everglades is a dynamic confluence
intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glade as we're born.
manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem. glades, as one of the newer 
rangers described everglades visitors as down 30% since the refuge-sememe,
rivers, everglades, and alligator-maw. and human the glades. they are
space and/or time. example: an everglades bounding occasion, shifting. and
the everglades - "i gave my blood in the everglades" - one space-time
through selected sites, extrapolated across the glades deep in subjective
youth more than writing; this geology is experiential, ex-tasis of glade.

codework:: f({x}) -> {y} - any mapping is sufficient - TRACE of the 
road-vector against the MESS or TANGLE across the glades path.  it 
is the arrow - not the terms - that fascinates me - the arrow which
INSISTS on a mapping, linguistic or perceptual. one APPROACHES code
with code; the retina always already encodes, and further coding
provides a bracketing or intersection of terms x^~x permitting
definition. but BETWEEN x and ~x (not-x), there is a chasm or
FISSURE; inscription transforms FISSURE into CLIFF. do you follow 
me? I am winging this. in this REALM, everything is inchoate, fuzzy;
one is immersed in the DIALOGIC of FLOWS among schema, scripts, 
goals, regimes, mappings, sememes, and configurations. these moments
are THROUGH the path or road, not DOWN. HERE, I have no shadow. THAT
DAY, I was covered in sand-midge, mosquito, and deer-fly bites; I
carried a fever everywhere. but that day I drove the seven miles
brilliantly, reaching my destination in record time. ... ... ... ...
consider a CODE as a MESH with PARASITIC INTENTION. the PARASITE is
the nexus; in the absence of the parasite, all that's left is the
problematic of a 'natural' protocol. it is the PARASITE that 
inhabits the sememe; it is the PARASITE that INSCRIBES. think of the
TEE formation: f({x}) <> |P| <> {y}. I inhabit the parasitic; the 
road and path penetrate me: I gasp the name of the code: ROAD-NAME

code and protocol: the parasitic vis-a-vis phenomenology of approach


among x and ~x = one inscribes the null set 0 as x^~x - intersection. but 
x may be fuzzy; x may also be intended or unintended. if x is unintended, 
or non-intended, then x may be protocol. consider roughly three strata:
a. unintended x-protocol: dna or crystal mapping, clays, lindenmayer 
algorithms in relation to plant formation. b. intended x-protocol: tcp/ 
ip, jpeg compression, mpeg encoding, morse, ciphering. by 'intention,' a 
reference _only_ to goal-oriented, teleological structuring. note that 
intended x-protocols may be secondary-level coding (i.e. tcp/ip) or 
primary-level (morse, bacon cipher); in the latter, the text is trans- 
lated on a character-by-character basis into code, and in the former, the 
text is carried by the code. at best this is a fuzzy distinction. note 
that the latter is also an intended non-intended protocol; a better word 
might be 'tended'; thus morse code is tended with key translation, but 
tcp/ip is automated translation into packets (not into a 'tcp/ip code,' 
but through ascii, well maybe the same thing). in intended distinction, 
one might say (as one might say in tended non-intended protocol), that the 
distinction is parasitic, that the element-between x and ~x - the inscrip- 
tion itself - is the result of an intended act or sequence of acts. such 
an element-between is dirty, abject, fuzzy, problematic, historically and 
ideologically bound. 

the element-between is the boundary-phenomena within the phenomenology of 
approach; it marks/inscribes the totality of investigation, expenditure, 
intention - as well as accompanying debris, and the heuristics necessary 
to cleanse the phenomenon itself, [x, ~x].

it is within the element-between that -jectivity: projection/introjection,
plays out. it is from this element, represented as the inscribed boundary
x|~x, that anomaly overrides, that default tags arise. this is the chora-
tic element within the sememe, within semiosis, the generator of meaning, 
and meaning's withdrawal.

it is here, {x} <> |P| <> {~x}, that the parasite is manifest - the noise 
in the system that _tends towards meaning,_ towards the _maintenance_ of 
the inscription. the parasite has everything to gain; as such it is also 
_symbiotic_ in relation to x - retaining x for its own ends; the whole 
process is an _enunciation._

3 protocols


1 well this protocol drives everything. it's not a protocol, it's an 
association or mapping, it's a drive or production-number, it's a 
correspondence, it's built into the matrix of the inchoate, it's 
unintended, it's untended - [phenomenology of approach, the world]

2 well this protocol carries the codes, this protocol carries the message, 
this protocol is unintended, it's tended, it's maintained, someone 
maintains it, someone keeps it running, someone sends the message, someone 
hears it - [phenomenology of the world, the carrier, the interpretation, 
the interpretation of the carrier, the assignation]

3 well this protocol's assigned on the run, this is the meaning-generator, 
meaning-production, this assigns boundaries and bindings, this creates 
language and negations, this runs it through - there's dirt inhabiting 
this one, there's the noise in the machine, there's the interpretations, 
the abjections, the sado-masochisms, the ideologies, histories - it's all 
in this protocol - [phenomenology of approach, the complicit, the 
seduction, the accompaniment, the comprehension, the deconstruction]
