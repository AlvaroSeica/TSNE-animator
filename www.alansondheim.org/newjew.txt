[What I'm talking about, with video and image, later today,
12/2/13, at UMN, Judaism as it relates to my work. Beginning
with quotes from Hillel in Avot of Rabbi Natan, end perhaps
with live examples. If there were more time, I'd be applying
back-to-front transformations, as well as the elimination of
duplicate words - mimicking and enlarging upon the entanglement
of speech and creation. There is only so much time. Thanks to
Maria Damon, Sandy Baldwin, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Maud Liardon,
Azure Carter, examples and performances from everywhere. You 
may have seen much of this text; I keep refining, recreating
the original from the debris of origination, such as it is.]



TALK-THROUGH


THE BOOK
THE MACHINE AND TRANSFORMATION
THE PAIN
THE ABYSS AND DELIQUENCY OF PAIN
THE CAMP AND THE TUMULT AMONG THE ABYSS
THE VIRTUAL WHICH IS NO ESCAPE
PAIN AND DEATH AMONG THE VIRTUAL
THE CHARRED BODY AND THE UNNAMING
OUR VIRTUAL
THE BENT BODY OF THE BOOK: THE BENT BODY OF CHAGALL,
MODIGLIANI, SOUTINE. 
THE CORRODED BODY OF SOUTINE, CHAGALL.
THE WALKING DEAD IN THE CAMPS.
THE TUMULT EVERYWHERE IN THE FACE OF SCARCITY
 AND UNBELIEVABLE WEALTH. 
THE CHILD SOLDIER. BLOOD TECHNOLOGIES.
THE EXTINCTIONS OF THE RAINFORESTS AND OCEANS.
ANNIHILATION: TO THE LIMIT.

IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO THEN? IF NOT NOW, WHEN?

As a Jew, I am an unbeliever.

A Jew _must_ be an unbeliever: the Jew testifies to the silence
  of God.

All my work stems out of the discrepency of care - how can one
care in the (literal) face of death?

So I begin as an aetheist, but a haunted one, haunted by ghosts
and my own habitus as a (non-existent, therefore Godlike) ghost
of the future - which resonates, haunts me _now_ - my short life
- like all of ours - (ours, but not of our own possessing) coming to
an end.

==============

when i was quite young my father took me to the government 
printing office in washington and said i could get any book i 
wanted. i am a person of the book. i chose the two volumes of 
the medical experiments from the nuremberg war trial testimony. 
since then and probably before, the body - the wounded or dying 
body, the suppurating or aroused body - has been central to my 
work and when i think of crowds i think of gas chambers.

Ben 'Azzai used to said, which meant he said it often, he often 
spoke, "If one dies while speaking, it is a good sign for him; 
if in silence, it is a bad sign for him." (Avot d' Rebbi Natan, 
trans Goldin.) If one stops talking, one sinks into the chamber; 
if one keeps talking, perhaps one can talk his way out of it.

none could do that. "By TEN names was the Holy Spirit called, to 
with: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, glory, command, 
burden, prophecy, vision." (trans Goldin.) "_Ruach Hakodesh_ was 
called by ten names: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, 
call, command, burden, prophecy, vision." (trans. Finkel.) Call 
or glory, always a burden. The Ruach Hakodesh called and was 
called, was a matter of physics, physicality, the body blown 
across time and space, but the burden implies a weight, the mute 
witnessing and assignation of substance. none could be that, 
none could _be_ substance, only transformed in the chambers or 
through poetics _into_ substance or its guise.

every people is a people of the Book, a people of the Name, and 
every name is of the Book, and every book is of the Name. 

i play music and scales are physics and culture entangled. but i 
play physically and the body always risks failure with an 
instrument. i'm aware of the meat of the body, its tensions and 
stresses; i imagine i have no further time or space, that death 
advances into the sound itself.

From "Writing Under": "The hunt and reception of short-wave
number codes is codework. Writers on the edge are circumscribed 
by codework, malfunctioned psychoanalytics, scatologies, Jews 
Gypsies, Gays, Blacks, are endlessly coded and decoded; the 
codes are dissolute, partial, always already incomplete: the 
differend is codework." 

Gloss:
"corrosion, codework as subaltern, haunting the abyss. think of 
the differend. the abyss holds nothing back, everything slides 
into sound, noise, silence - codework is also a form of 
wandering. [Codework a form of wandering in and among the
camps?]

the wandering Jew - ALWAYS questions authority!

 moses wandering - the old joke - why did the jews wander in the 
desert for 40 years - someone dropped a quarter. what is this, 
what sort of system, economics? 
 the differend is a form of work: it takes work to bury the 
living as if they were dead.
 therefore when dead - to question Lyotard - that's a form of 
infinite work..."




i want to consider the idea of _resonant quality,_ that the 
world appears resonant, coherent - what i termed years ago 'a 
certain style.' from this, the notion of an author or super- 
structure emerges - even for example, from the way that gravity 
appears totalizing. then of course a god appears, something to 
ward off the incoherence or chaotic noise of death - something 
to transform death itself back into resonance (even though chaos 
catches up at the end). the resonant quality of the world 
relates to magical thinking as well, language that falls through 
the interstices, opening them wider.

i am a person of the book; i am a portion of the book.

the body is a weight, a burden; the dancer watches himself or 
herself collapse with age; auto-choreography becomes a paring- 
down as the body becomes alien to itself; what was previously 
ikonic is transformed into the indexical, into a system of 
objects in rebellion. the aging body is already the alien body; 
aliens are within us as well as exoplanetary. the aging body is 
a body of parts and parcels and the aging body transforms into 
the book, the symbolic which reads the universe and itself, but 
is increasingly remote from the mute substance of the real.

i revel in neurosis, the jewish neurosis of woody allen or my 
take on lenny bruce for example, not the playfulness of 
seinfeld. so i take solace in an image: my back against the 
wall, nowhere else to go, but the body, the jewish body, the 
wise-cracking body, is present, presenced, and it's my body.

in this configuration, _my_ body takes solace in itself, by 
virtue of a detour through language and through fear: it is also 
the body _up against the wall_ or firing-squad and i admit to 
living at times in literally abject and self-generated fear, 
which transforms me against myself, the slough of the body.

i wonder if i can talk myself out of this, talk myself out of 
anything. i talk and talk, write and write, and death still 
haunts me and will finally close down the mumbling.

my words are black letters in a black fire. 


==========================




Ruach Hakodesh

machine and spirit of g-d

e ': (A) ten names called a prophet. these are: the axis. loyal. 
worked. courier. Contract. watching. seeing. dreaming. prophet. 
God's people: (i) ten names called the Holy Spirit are Names 
called

in the rush of audo-translation the spirit is lost 

Ben 'Azzai used to said, which meant he said it often, he often 
spoke, "If one dies while speaking, it is a good sign for him; 
if in silence, it is a bad sign for him." (Avot d' Rebbi Natan, 
trans Goldin.) If one stops talking, one sinks into the chamber; 
if one keeps talking, perhaps one can talk his way out of it.

none could do that. "By TEN names was the Holy Spirit called, to 
with: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, glory, command, 
burden, prophecy, vision." (trans Goldin.) "_Ruach Hakodesh_ was 
called by ten names: parable, metaphor, riddle, speech, saying, 
call, command, burden, prophecy, vision." (trans. Finkel.) Call 
or glory, always a burden. The Ruach Hakodesh called and was 
called, was a matter of physics, physicality, the body blown 
across time and space, but the burden implies a weight, the mute 
witnessing and assignation of substance. none could be that, 
none could _be_ substance, only transformed in the chambers or 
through poetics _into_ substance or its guise.

"The Hebrew language phrase ruach ha-kodesh is a term used in 
the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and Jewish writings to refer to the 
Spirit of YHWH. The Hebrew term ruakh kodeshka, without the 
definite article, also occurs. The "Holy Spirit" in Judaism 
generally refers to the divine aspect of prophecy and wisdom. It 
also refers to the divine force, quality, and influence of the 
Most High God, over the universe or over his creatures, in given 
contexts." (Wikipedia)

then of course: "nmf. wind; spirit, soul, nous; air; direction; 
ghost, fantom, genie, hobgoblin, imp, incubus, jinn, jinni , 
kobold, phantom, shade, sprite, bogey, bogy; mind" (elsewhere)

none could do that. the g-d folds time and space, collapses 
them, a literal Time Lord. the collapse turns death in upon 
itself and we shall all live forever. the tibetan deity machine 
continues the repetitions of lives with difference, differance.
is this a production or reproduction? to the extent i am 
re-prodution i am already in a creation whose final act creates 
this beginning of burden, call and command.

The Announcement of the type of work:

I work with virtual wounded and/or deceased avatars, examining their 
problematic relationship to illness, melancholy, mourning, wounding, and 
death in the physical world; the result is a series of performances in 
Second Life and OpenSim (virtual worlds), texts (both literary and 
theoretical), and real/virtual installations. In order to do this, I 
create modified avatar animations which are projected into physical space 
for live performance; these are made from altered motion capture equipment 
in order to create 'inconceivable' and alien avatars, movements, and 
environments.

I emphasize the political and cultural/physiological dimensions of
wounding/slaughter within and without the cleansed landscapes of social
media and virtual worlds. Conceptually, I'm concerned with returning the
virtual to the real, indicating that more is at stake in the former than
'just manipulation' of avatars. I'm involved in a critique of techno-
philia through these concerns - in particular, the phenomenology of
abjection in relation to both analog and digital realms.


==================================================================

Thinking through the abyss and its relation to the concentration camp:


we all live within our hallucinations

when we die, we're sliding unawares and there have been
too many deaths and disruptions

holding on and poised above an abyss which opens everywhere

when i say "just over there" what i'm saying is that the
world falls off in every direction

you pick a point or position and walk towards it or force
your body into nodding

and over there, the abyss which means
there's nothing to hold onto

my breathing has become more and more difficult in these
rough terrains and when i sleep the machine prepares me
the catastrophe of the day

i'd want to say more, about how my search for the truth
was always emergent

but near the abyss, the loss, not only of information,
but of its viral carriers, ensures it doesn't matter at 
the end

and that matter doesn't matter, that every point of the
abyss falters towards every other, flounders on every 
other

what life does is momentarily bear witness, and just
before blindness, it appears as if the subjunctive gains
the upper hand

oh these are heady days

these are days of death and the compression of death,
days of genocides and impulses

days of annihilation: to the limit!

when the earth turns, irradiating itself towards a bleak
and darkening sun

at least there are days and a succession of bands, 
of light, then dark, then light,
of dark, then light then dark

the body embraces catastrophe: see how the abyss invades
and cauterizes each and every thought!

and in every direction, and among all, and every one!

these are heady days, salvation burning like a star 
on its last coordinates

i'm looking up in every direction, and from each and 
every one, i'm falling

i'm falling for no one, i'm falling for nothing
and i understand, annihilation is the path, not the
means

the journey, and not the goal,
the way and not the end,

that the limit is asymptotic, and whatever one does,
one is coasting

among the others that are our selves or the same,
one is coasting

among the abyss and cessation, among annihilations
in lock-step and ready-made,
one is coasting

the keel of the boat, that too, in every direction,
and the keel is coasting towards the shore

and the shore is an hallucination
and we're living there, and dying, we're dying
in great numbers, 

and we're sliding, unawares

and in spite of or towards this speaking, and among
this speaking,

we're sliding, unawares

Pain Text with Sandy Baldwin:

On (severe) Pain

(dialog between Sandy Baldwin and Alan Sondheim)

In relation to pain:

Inexpressibility occurs because of the difficulty of expressing 
interior states that might not have a clearcut symptomology (as 
thirst does, for example) - and also because severe pain derails 
speech and language and thought, as the internalized horizon of 
the flesh is muted or screams in abeyance. All of this touches 
on the _pain of the signifier_ and its inexpressible relation to 
death - (Alan)

=========================================

I really like your phrase "pain of the signifier" in that final 
installment on unprintability. I'm not sure how we think about 
it, however.

On the one hand, pain is all that the signifier negates and 
forecloses. So, there's a numbness to the signifier, an 
anaesthesia.

On the other hand, the signifier in the place of pain, as a kind 
of bad suture, a bandaid.

On the third hand, is the real gamble, the crying or trembling 
of the signifier, in its negation, trembling with the world that 
it is holding off. How to show this? Or is it simply what shows 
up?

Sandy

=========================================================================

Hi Sandy, doesn't pain negate and foreclose the signifier? The 
pain of the signifier for me is the pain of the _incision_ 
accompanying inscription; the world simultaneously expands and 
narrows. In Buddhism, I'd imagine (I'm fuzzy at the moment) all 
signifiers equal and empty; suffering and attachment imbues 
distinction with intentionality, capture.

The signifier's sharp; the numbness is what's created in the act 
of distinction. So the signifier's x^-x, that stuff I wrote 
about a while back about the intersection of a set and its 
complement relativized in relation to the 'content' of the set; 
if x = apple, then 0-sub-apple is the intersection of x^-x. So 
classically this is very sharp, 'smeared' out in the real via 
abjection.

The signifier's not in the place of pain except for the 
observer; for the person undergoing (severe) pain, there is no 
place at all: that's the numbness. The signifier's the report; 
the distance between the report and the pain is also painful...
(Alan)

============================================

I'd say I was thinking about the signifier as something read, as 
an object that I read into. Whereas I see in your reply the 
signifier as something I write.

In the case of the reader, of myself as reader of the signifier 
of pain, the incision is for you, the pain is yours. This fact 
makes pain *your pain*, makes it witnessed, validated for me by 
that big other. The signifier is communicated and read. You and 
I share in the signifier of pain.

I would say it is beyond reading or non-reading to realize that 
the emptiness of all signifiers. Every reading fictionalizes 
this, tells a story of it, but it is only in non-reading that I 
really approach the alterity of your pain.

So, I agree that for the person undergoing the pain there is no 
place; I would go further: it is this inarticulate boundary that 
concerns me. The signifier of pain as your pain - can I feel 
this? Only as reversibility, as my pain (which in a Cartesian 
sense I would see as like your pain)?

As reader or receiver, I can push reading to impossible limits. 
I can strip everything away from the report of the pain, every 
connotation, every signification, to the point where I touch at 
the incised flesh of the signifier and find the continuous flesh 
of the world, the great surface where we all feel. And here it 
is no longer your pain / my pain. Here signification is a kind 
of perturbation, wherein pain and pleasure blur and float, 
pleasurepain.

Or - and this may not be an alternative but a supplementary 
dimension - reading your pain must be already framed, 
consensually, as they say of communicational domains. There must 
be pain before and beyond, which is to say, beyond otherness, 
beyond the ultimate fact that the signifier is a structural fact 
in the communication circuit. (The validation, the implication 
of the big other I wrote of above. (In communication, the price 
of signification is that it is always the others pain I read, 
never yours, and the other's pain I write, never mine.)

I think, I think the beyond where "I feel your pain" no longer 
is determined by the symbolics of intersubjective communication 
is Levinas' "beyond being," or also, I think, these are the 
encounters that Lingis writes of. This phrase "I feel your pain" 
implies such a beyond. I mean: I must feel your pain even in the 
absence of the signifier (and it will be absent, it is absent). 
Impossibly so, since pain is always pain for you, for the one 
incised. I must feel impossible pain. (I would say this relates 
to love as well.)

Not sure I'm going anywhere. (Sandy)


===============================================================

Hi Sandy, this is certainly useful for me. I'd say when you say 
'the signifier as something read,' it's a perception, an 
incision, that you're making; with severe pain, there is no 
signifier for me at all, not even incision; I'm emptied of it, 
even to the extent that "I feel your pain" wouldn't be heard, 
wouldn't be a received communication - there might not even be a 
"you" that is speaking those words to me. When my mother was 
dying and in severe pain, she could utter, mumble that, it was 
her feet, but there was only minimal recognition I was present, 
and I was literally dumb-founded - i.e. found dumb, and 
transformed into one whose foundation was dumb, mute - almost an 
erasure. I couldn't possibly feel her pain, I wouldn't know 
where to begin with either that act or that sentence, that 
inscription. Pain turns to groans, moaning, as if the sound 
might assuage, and perhaps sound does play a role, which later 
mantra built on; I don't know...

Might one go so far as to say that the 'reader of the signifier 
of pain' does not feel pain, he or she is in such a state that 
reading is still possible? Or that the pain he or she feels is 
encapsulated, not sufficiently severe to cancel out, thwart, 
communication?

Thinking of my mother (she died a few days later, under 
morphine, given to her to assuage the pain, she never woke 
through that period, we were all waiting... The parentheses 
remains open, as I await my death in a sense, this is as close 
as I've been...

So I'd say we didn't share in the signifier, my mother and I - 
she was emptied of that, what was left was pain and the dark 
horizon she must have known, all along, was part and parcel of 
it...

The boundary, too, disappears...

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

SO I wonder, why isn't THIS the focus of philosophy, for 
example, why all this talk before the curtain goes down? With 
the Bardo Thodol, the Tibertans have recourse to the symbolic; 
in a sense Tibetan Buddhism is a discourse about death, but 
again, by the living - the guiding continuing after the death, 
by the living, and it's a form of imagining and casting aside 
deity, a conscious form of eliminating the symbolic, so that 
emptiness occurs, and maybe enlightenment and maybe the cycle of 
rebirths comes to a halt.

I've never understood this, why one would want to halt the 
cycle, when life, if not fabulous, is full of novelty in spite 
of or through the suffering, but that's another story, or 
perhaps the same. - (Alan)

==========================================

Hi Sandy,

Odd working on this and re: my mother; my father's in the 
hospital at the moment and my brother and I have been talking 
about his death, although he may well live for several more 
years... It's a harrowing time.

I'm twisted re: my father, as you can well imagine, not in all 
that great shape... (Alan)

==================================
[...]
==================================

There is also pain that is *managed* or lived through. Though I 
think this is already a problem with this as I write it: 
wouldn't all pain be shattering, in its time however brief, as a 
kind of obduracy within? And yet we're constantly living with 
it. At least I mean that in this case there are available 
conventions for signifying its presence. I feel your pain 
because it is like other pains in I have felt in the past, pains 
I have had, with the sense of *having* pain as an object 
possessed and controlled, as an experience catalogued and 
available to telling. I have had a toothache or a broken toe or 
a sore muscle. I lived through each and can now speak of it, can 
share it with you, can point to the scars. I am certain that 
here the pain is encapsulated - as you put it - or in a kind of 
vesicle within me. (Sandy)

This is true to an extent, but only once for example have I had 
such bad toothache that I could do nothing but scream (and did); 
I had to be rushed to an emergency dentist. Now I 'remember' the 
pain, but I'm not sure if this is the same kind of memory 
reconstruction that occurs, for example, when I 'remember' my 
childhood home... (Alan)

Then, thinking about your mother: a setting with no 
communication, no exchange of commonplaces about where it hurts. 
No signifier of pain, or rather the signifier is framed and held 
by the setting. No "pain index," no seven words to describe it, 
from flickering and pounding through nagging and torturing, or 
in between. In this way, pain is a problem for indexicality as 
such (and differs from similar problems e.g. the punctum). 
Gesture falls short: the witness - and there might need to be 
another term? the "vigilant" works in a way, but isn't right for 
the pain-sharer - consoles and soothes to no avail, the sufferer 
utters and moves but conveys nothing of the internal anguish. 
(Sandy)

Yes, absolutely, this is it, which is why I think of pain as 
ikonic, an internal ikon operative and witnessed only by the 
subject who bears it. Which brings up a closely related concept, 
that we are ikonic to ourselves and that this is a closed 
transmission (not even sutured in the sense of the construction 
of the subject). (Alan)

What remains? A phenomenology that is blinded and muted in many 
ways. The tableau of sufferer and vigilant conveys only distance 
and numbness. It also conveys waiting (vigilance). Mute and 
blind waiting the sufferer is not dead, nor are they undead (in 
a monstrous sense), but they are no longer a subject, no longer 
speaking and asserting. You write "there might not even be a 
'you' that is speaking those words to me," which makes it 
impossible for you to say "I feel your pain." This is a tableau 
of nothingness, of an open gap in being. It is not yet mourning. 
It is traumatic in advance, marking a trauma to come, in the 
sense that trauma is dream, is something displaced in experience 
and time. The phenomenology of the gap is tied to the time of 
waiting and not to any other perception. Duration, waiting, 
vigilance: these may be bodily relations beyond alterity ... 
(Sandy)

Yes, again, and the waiting for the observer is also tied to the 
possibility of recover; for the person in pain, it is timeless, 
and I'd think even the potential of temporality or a temporal 
horizon is absent. (Alan)

Is it not here that I might say *I feel impossible pain*? At 
least, this was where I ended my last reply, except now I would 
say that every word in that phrase, "I feel impossible pain," is 
broken in the tableau of nothingness I'm writing of: the subject 
that might utter the phrase (the vigilant) is dumbfounded, as 
you say, troubling "I" and "feel" and so on. Perhaps *I feel 
impossible pain* is absurd, impossible, not even worth saying. 
It is philosophically absurd ... (Sandy)

It would seem almost an egoism, no? Since (feel)and(imossible 
pain) as locutions are contradictory, but yet the observer 
insists on saying _something_ since he or she is reduced to 
silence by the other's moaning. A doctor on the other hand, 
would see all of this as symptom, and hopefully act accordingly, 
doing whatever she or he can to assuate the pain which she knows 
by proxy is _there._ (Alan)

I keep returning to Lingis: in one of his books, can't remember 
which, he describes his own vigil by his dying mother's bed. She 
has cancer, she's in a hospital near Chicago. He describes his 
own inarticulateness and hers as well; but - as I recall - he 
also sees a bravery in the scene, a dignity in both the mother 
and the son facing death. Without being able to dig up the 
reference - I may be wrong in recalling it? - I have to say I 
find it a bit forced, but also I see it fitting the general 
refusal of real abjection in his work, his sense of the glory or 
wonder of being in every situation. *Forced* as a way of 
philosophically or pedagogically making a point about 
imperatives that bind us beyond being. Yet I wonder if it's too 
much on his part: how can it be so sure that I'm able to hear 
and answer the imperative? I'm not sure I believe that in the 
presence of a dying loved one it is so easy, except 
philosophically and perhaps only after. Again, I'm being unfair: 
it could not have been easy for him, and yet it becomes easy to 
philosophize, and to achieve a passivity and even enlightenment. 
Lingis focuses on the extreme, the rending and transforming of 
suffering and encounters, but there's a sense of certainty, of 
philosophical clarity that he brings to these. (Sandy)

I like your description here and the notion of refusing real 
abjection, but then I wonder how he approaches situations of 
real torture or pain before its 'time.' But the philosophizing 
itself is a way of dealing with it; when my mother died I played 
shakuhachi, and when I recently wrote about my father's being in 
hospital (on Facebook), I talked about playing zurna - it's a 
way of dealing, a kind of expressivity against everything, 
including the potential cessation of expressivity of course. 
(Alan)

Perhaps this relates to your final points about Buddhism or 
*philosophy*. I'm left wondering if dialogue in the presence of 
death, if description of the tableau of vigilance - as above, as 
here - is, can possibly be, *philosophical*? How can it be? 
Surely philosophy fails? We are, as you say, dumbfounded. I'm 
pretty sure that I'm unsure about what I'm writing of here, that 
I'm in no way certain about your pain or the pain of others, 
that I'm in no way certain about the nothingness of the vigil. 
How could I be? It is obscene to philosophize on pain. (Sandy)

Another turn here, however - perhaps that is the only 
philosophizing that isn't obscene; one is speaking for a body 
that's no longer capable of speaking, one is simultaneously 
within the intense privacy of that inexressible pain, and the 
intense privacy of writing itself, Vygotsky's inner speech, 
Blanchot's writing of the disaster, Scarry's introductory 
material on pain (the best part of her book, at least for me), 
and so forth... (Alan)

Notes from Utah (Alan)

110812_004: Pain as separating inscription/history from the 
inertness of the body; what's read as history from the outside 
(and thereby entering the social), from the inside is 
unread/unreadable. The inside is pure substance.

110812_005: Inscription carries, until burial, carries a 
specific relationship to the body until burial. Burial is a form 
of reinscription. A line on the body - how is this interpreted 
during life? during death?

110812_012: Inscription => embodiment and maintenance; 
maintenance => retardation: what makes for example virtual 
particles last as long as they do? Retardation - slowing things 
down, copying, duplicating, a poetics of dispersion, 
holding-back. See the phenomenology of numbers: data-base, 
interpretation, intentionality, an immersive situation, memory. 
In doing mathematics, always dealing with temporal processes. In 
pain: everything drops away, definable and immersive situations 
cease to exist.

110812_014: Splintering, splintered nails, leveraging of 
particles, striations, applicable to notions of binding, 
constriction, discomfort.

110816_002: Pain of the signifier: signifier as incision, 
disturbance, splits between the Pale and beyond the Pale. Pain 
beyond the Pale?

The pain of death: horizon foreclosing its origin and the 
subject as well.

110816_003: The work I do as obdurate, not grid or mapping, but 
flows that are not channelized, flows that are mute - relation 
to pain. The phenomenology of the embodiment of the signifier is 
also mute.

What I do is planless, expands into available technology on a 
practical level, produces and reproduces that way.

110816_006: My Textbook of Thinking: components of inscription: 
linkage, syntactical structure, inscription is an ordering of 
difference, impulse, representation-structure, legitimation 
structure, maintenance, stabilization mechanisms, 
positive/negative feedback, field of abjection. Excessive 
related to corrosion. Difference between fissure and 
inscription. Relationship of corrosion and scarcity to pain.

110816_007: Phenomenology of eccentric space, Sarduy, 
de-centering the subject, tied to abjection.

110816_008: Difference between fissure and inscription; pain 
tends towards fissure; if fissure is same and same, there's no 
geography, no topography, no topology; the result is the crack / 
wound, everywhere and nowhere.

110818_001: Pain relates to the body as cosmology to the 
universe. (?)

110819_001: Pain in relation to virtual worlds: in 
circumlocution of the subject who may remain impervious, the 
degree zero of phenomenology.
