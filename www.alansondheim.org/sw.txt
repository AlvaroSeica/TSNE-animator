Preparing for the Cave - Azure's Sarah Bernhardt song



Viola, Stockhausen, Infinite Space

http://www.alansondheim.org/caveviola44.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/violastarcave.mp3

The viola was coupled to the floor, fed through a standard 
instrument mic and vibration meter; the latter's track was 
amplified; my movements were coupled to the three-dimensional 
tunneling surrounding me in the Cave. Thanks to Kathleen 
Ottinger for stunning visuals, Azure Carter for videography, 
and the Brown University Cave. I channeled Stockhausen, I 
channeled cries and whispers, everything through the viola in
this one take. The sound, the music, is something I haven't
heard before; I've taken the right track, which was stunning
and I dreamed of the bow coupled to the viola, replete with
cries and whispers. We worked for hours, produced new video,
audio, and stills; we used radio, Alpine zither, and viola;
we recorded everything, even the secret transmissions of the
equipment itself.

Echo echo Sarah Bernhardt, she is effaced by the century of 
wonders, almost vanishing, a few minutes of voice, all
knowledge and all wonders disappear, echo echo, disappearing
wonders, the voice of Sarah Bernhardt, a few moments of voice

Divine! The Divine Sarah Bernhardt! The Jew! It's True! Really! 
against the cold bone, the words from Sarah Bernhardt's 
ululations Sarah Bernhardt meets Edison (from Bernhardt, My 
Double Life): Sarah Bernhardt had a 17 inch waist. I would say 
she had a "daemon." Sarah Bernhardt would sing and her voice 
rose in uncanny ululations shoulder. Sarah Bernhardt is in this 
room with me, and she leans - no - she's unknown to her, is seen 
has a precursor to Sarah Bernhardt. She too was The last thought 
of Sarah Bernhardt, against the cold bone, the words from Sarah 
Bernhardt's ululations - Sarah Bernhardt bangs on the doors of 
sound and movement and Sarah Bernhardt is Sarah Bernhardt 
presence and nothing less will do for Sarah Bernhardt. Sarah 
Bernhardt screams and nothing is heard. Sarah Bernhardt walks 
across the stage and nothing is seen. The biochemistry of Sarah 
Bernhardt dies with her. Broken is the DNA of Sarah Bernhardt. 
Sarah Bernhardt knows everything is blurred and scratched. 
Everyone spoke of Rachel and everyone spoke of Sarah Bernhardt. 
There are these Jewish women, Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt and Of 
Sarah Bernhardt it is said, you should have seen her. The 
remains of Sarah Bernhardt whose face barely graced the cinema, 
Sarah Bernhardt screamed and clawed and Sarah Bernhardt is 
silent The scent of Sarah Bernhardt has disappeared. Rachel has 
also. You should have seen Rachel. Of Sarah Bernhardt there are 
famous photographs. Sarah Bernhardt holds still and is frozen 
and is absolutely still. Sarah Bernhardt writes and her writing 
is still. Sarah Bernhardt turns as if she is about to speak. She 
begins, Sarah Bernhardt is screaming and she is silent. The 
voice of Sarah Bernhardt is amazing and it is said one cries and 
is driven mad by the voice of Sarah Bernhardt. Rachel and Sarah 
Bernhardt have disappeared. Sarah Bernhardt is silent. Sarah 
Bernhardt would sing and her voice rose in uncanny ululations,

Sarah Bernhardt is in this room with me, and she leans.
Sarah Bernhardt is in this room with me, and she leans.
Sarah Bernhardt is in this room with me, and she leans.

Sickness, Seeks Advice, Wood

http://www.alansondheim.org/theykeep07.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/qqq3.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/qqq1.mp3

Help! Here are my symptoms - slight sore throat, always, 
accompanied by a hoarse voice, wheezing, difficulty breathing. 
Chest congested and chills, feels like flu, but my temperature 
lowers slightly, doesn't raise. Muscle aches. Head feels 
'thick,' sometimes headaches, migraines. Coughing and dizziness. 
The exhaustion is terrible; I have to force myself to do 
anything. My doctor in Brooklyn ruled out psychosomatic, thought 
it might be a low-grade anti-immune issue. But that comes with 
its own problems in terms of treatment, and it's probably not 
correct. I can hardly function some days. It's worse when I wake 
up or nap. I've had this for years, but it's been getting worse 
recently. My energy seems low and I'm just frustrated all the 
times. Writing this to see if anyone has any idea what's going 
on. It doesn't seem to be connected with depression (which I 
have), but it adds to it. Sleep broken up as usual. Played two 
qin pieces today; if I stop playing, my muscle memory will 
dissolve. There's a lot of memorization involved. I spoke to a 
friend who plays qin; we discussed how the weather affects it. 
My older instrument becomes much more resonant; the newer is the 
opposite. I tend wood, work in electronics. We just received 
copies of my latest release, which should be announced any day 
now - Cutting Board, from ESP-Disk, with Chris Diasparra and Ed 
Schneider, with cover images from the work we've done in the 
Cave; Kathleen Ottinger and I are on the cover. The titles of 
the songs are from the elements. There are a number of duets and 
trios; I also have three solos - electric guitar, qin, and sung 
lisu. I no longer have the sung lisu, which I traded in; now I 
realize how beautiful it sounds. But I have enough to play at 
the moment, and the qin are beautiful. One piece (above) has two 
instruments played together; the other has one, recorded from 
beneath, in a rather dry manner. But seriously, if you any idea 
what might be hitting me (it's been here for years), would like 
to hear from you; you can write back-channel. My medical care in 
Rhode Island isn't good, and it's almost impossible for me to 
see my doctor; instead, I'm shunted to nurse practitioners who 
don't know what's going on and don't have the time for it. Here 
at home I feel dysfunctional some of the time, and I shouldn't 
be; my tests all come out fairly normal, but I haven't had a 
real checkup for fourteen months and I'm not scheduled for one 
until December. I don't want to lose the next three months or 
anything beyond that, I'm worried about my health. The album is 
terrific, I think, and in November we're having a double release 
party for both Avatar Woman and Cutting Board. But what if I 
can't play? At the moment I'm still more or less at the top of 
my form, but November is a long way away. I continue to work in 
virtual worlds but haven't been able to see my way towards the 
purchase of a Kinect and software, which are quite expensive; as 
a result I rehash the older behavioral/animation files. On the 
other hand, we do well in the cave and I realized just this week 
that, being unaffiliated, I tend to work furiously in short 
spurts when I have access to things, and then proceed later with 
the files; the last Cave session for example was three hours and 
I'll be dealing with the files, now, for a week or so, producing 
new video, audio, images, and so forth. Today, for a second 
example, we attended a steam engine event in East Greenwich; all 
sorts of stationary engines were fired off; I made video and 
audio and these will appear, again, in new work, most likely in 
MacGrid. I work like this, jerking around, and maybe this too is 
wearing me down, but the symptoms listed above are always the 
same, sometimes worse (as now) sometimes better, but, like my 
tinnitus, always there, so again if you have any suggestions or 
something similar please do get in touch; I'm at my wit's end 
(which is an expression, not a geographic topos).



Resonant, Wave, Waving

http://www.alansondheim.org/caveviola30.jpg

I imagine what it's like to be a spiritual leader.
Here I am revolving with the earth and sun and moon.
The galaxy is too far, murmurs otherwise.
Turning inward, what a new trip, I bring you along!
This must be what wood is like in its being wood,
growing at a resonant pace, wave in the turning
world.

My arms are a swarm of starlings, murmuration.
My mind in the ease of the swarm.

Vac

mp4 sound = mp3
Cave, Kathleen Ottinger, graphic
Azure Carter, videography
Alpine zither
use headphones, bass, stereoseparation, use anything

they envelop the universes in vac and origin and denouement, 
thermophilic envelope universes vac denouement suffuring 
suturing mourning,

Vac is the sound of the amount of the one.
What is not one, is zero.
What is not zero, is one.
What is not zero, is zero.
One is not a quantity.

"A quantum is perfectly determined as a _number_ [_Zahl_]. 
_Geometry,_ by contrast to _arithmetic,_ is the science of 
continuous magnitude. But, in order to determine a space, we
must make use of number, Number is perfectly determinate because 
its principle is the one. The principle of number is the 
totality, which is the one. If we begin with one [as our unit], 
we may view it as consisting of a thousand parts. Our one has 
many ones within it, and it is thus designated as an _amount_ 
[_Anzahl_] of the one viewed as the unit - it is an amount of 
some unit. An amount is a contained manyness of ones - all 
contained by a border. These many ones have a common _oneness._ 
A number contains both discreteness and continuity: many ones 
and their oneness."

-- Hegel, Lectures on Logic, trans. Clark Butler.

What is not zero is zero (in addition); ontology hasn't come 
into being, no one cares. Care creates the one, 'look here.' In 
play, here, the world moves, harmonic analysis. But perhaps I 
create myself, 'look here.' (See as well Peirce on the continuum 
as a collocation of intervals.) Perhaps this looking slides, 
hands slide, sound slides. Sound does nothing; either everything 
or nothing is sound, either one or zero. Or nothing.



Yahrzeit

http://www.alansondheim.org/yahrzeitb.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/yahrzeit.mp4

the original text occasioned by my mother's death, exigencies
of mourning, transformed by Azure and that Time of the Year,
and the words somewhat lost in the Cave and the machinic, here
unmodified, you can picture desolation, and the iconography
of meditations near and far, co-present with the sound and
machine

sing-along, modified from:

texts/lt.txt:(what i stumble towards)

(what i stumble towards)
(what i have wanted to describe)
(what is indescribable)
(the tendency of my work)
(what characterizes philosophy: "philosophy has no regard")

the thickness of the world
the idiocy of the real
when there is death, the interior of a world disappears
there are details, one can see this in any past
the smell of a kitchen, the paint on the edges of the chairs
do the chairs need repainting
certain parts of the backs are worn, he sits there, she here
there's a sound they make, different sounds, pulled in and out
the dulled reflection of the chairs on the floor
when they were new
when they began to disappear, the last memory of the chairs
the light on them from the window, sounds of rain on the window
how high the backs above the table, their reflection on the table
the food, when the family may have been together
familiality, familiarity
when the chairs were comfortable, when they were turned
when we turned them facing one another, or moved them aside
when one of us left the room and the chairs were moved
fly in the window's interior
from the chair, tree outside, smaller then, different neighbors
sounds from the street coming in

the limitlessness of the world, its thickness
over and over again, peering around the corner
there is the world in uncanny, unaccountable, fullness

there is no theory for this, this inaccessible description
every explanation, there are heuristics, things glossed over
not the things of the world, but their fallen worlds
all worlds are fallen for that matter
all worlds encompassed with this thickness, inertness, grain
untheorizable, hardly memories, reconstructions, reconstitutions

with every death, it is a matter of ethics, this disappearance 
  of worlds
with every death, loss of world and history
with every death, redistribution of materials, severed ties and 
  limbs

i return constantly to this in my theorizing, this loss
no degree of technological recuperation works in this respect
no quantity of text or discourse plays the slightest role
what is re-presented is always already 0/1, infinitesimal

sometimes in a dream there is a horizon of what is gone

it's almost present, not really, you begin thinking of something 
  past
you're thinking, it's almost present, almost on the tip of the 
  tongue
it's never there, it's not even problematic, controvertible

i imagine paths through the world, turning beneath the chairs 
beneath or around the rungs of the chair or the four brown 
  wooden legs
paths opening up to interior surfaces opening up recursively
stains beneath the seat of the chair, cobwebs connecting rungs 
  to rungs
the smell of the varnish on older paint, flat faded white shown 
  through
paths moving among senses, spectra and bandwidths
paths moving from generation to generation, imaginary paths

paths of the scraping of chairs, people leaving for the very 
  last time
paths of chairs pulled in beneath old new people eating, 
  conversing
laughter, crying, screams, whispers, talking, singing, filling 
  the air

chairs of first and last times, inconceivable speculations
inconceivable principles, axiologies, hypothetical, hypotheses
not, no ideas but in things themselves
not, the last or second-to-last of the ox-herding pictures
not, the grain of the real
not, the practico-inert or materialist or idealist foundations
not, tat tvam asi or fundamental or surface negations
not, the interplay of signs, sememes, sign-systems
certainly not that interplay of signifiers, semiotics, 
historiographies
nothing that "might be said" to characterize, capture, 
  recuperate

something of absolute disappearance, annihilation, of trace 
  turned ash
something of charnel-house, but that too has paths, worlds, 
  traces
traces upon traces, perhaps i remember 1968
perhaps i remember 1945, 2003, perhaps i remember 1789
perhaps berlin, ankara, grise fjord, kurume, providence, katmandu
perhaps street, street-corner, room, field, forest, cliff, lake, 
  tarn
perhaps you, perhaps another, perhaps others
perhaps events, occurrences, what happened, what happens

those anecdotes without endings, well what did she say, what was 
  next
receding into pasts, backgrounds, irrelevancies of the present
but never irrelevant, always equidistant, equivalent, always 
  inert
and present and unaccounted for and present and uncountable
and present and unaccountable, all we can theorize is this,
collapse of description and uttermost alterity

the being of which knows no regard, is obdurate in the world
i'd write this, this error of philosophy: 
   "philosophy has no regard"
of which is the condition of speech, language, any and all 
interplay

*

so that i tend to produce, reproduce, overproduce
moving among media, modes, representations - this is all so 
  futile
an attempt to pull back from death, from constitution
or somewhat of a release among interiority and world
negation gnaws at doors and portals
chairs and chairs, or wood, or institutions of chairs and wood
or ideologies or constructs: one crawls, lifts on the back
stumbles to the feet, totters, almost gets it in the air

*

the thickness of the world
the idiocy of the real
nothing in a seed but seed
nothing obdurate but always in a corner or path

everywhere the thickness of which "philosophy has no regard"
what has disappeared and for whom and by what means
what constitutes the disappearance and the world which 
disappears
what is death "in this regard"

who or what, or what of or with writing, what of the 
calligraphic

AM emissions picked up on a GE analog short-wave
radio, from Cave computers, screens, projectors, and
assorted, during the last Cave session. The tracks 
were cleaned up with hiss removal; what you hear is
the heart of the machinery, oddly reminiscent of La
Monte Young or somebody. These have a remarkably
calming effect, something all of us could use at the
moment.

Bio: Alan Sondheim (www.alansondheim.org) was born in 
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; he lives with his partner, Azure 
Carter in Providence, RI. He holds a B.A. and M.A. from Brown 
University. A new-media artist, writer, and theorist, he has 
exhibited, performed and lectured widely. His band Ritual All 
70, whose debut The Songs (Riverboat, 1967) was reissued by the 
Fire Museum label, was included on the notorious Nurse with 
Wound list of outsider/avant-garde influences.

Overview (excerpted from the liner notes):

Sondheim is the first artist from ESP-Disk's 1964-75 heyday to 
return, since it was revived in 2005, to issue an album of new 
material on the fabled label. Sondheim joined the roster with a 
1967 session, Ritual-All-7-70, then followed up with 1968's 
T'Other Little Tune. Sondheim got his musical start as a 
guitarist, but soon moved into a much more original sound 
utilizing a vast array of instruments from around the world. 
Cutting Board, his eighth album, is his first instrumental group 
album; his other albums have always either been solo (and there 
are two solo tracks on Cutting Board as well) or featured female 
vocalists. Though he's a pure improviser, Sondheim rightly 
insists that he doesn't play jazz; even playing with two 
saxophonists, he's outside that tradition's spectrum. The 
eclecticism of the sounds he's working with sonically can 
tenuously seem to connect him to world music, but he doesn't 
play the instruments in traditional ways. And on rare occasions 
you can hear the blues lurking, but it's not likely that Living 
Blues will be putting him on the cover. Maybe if somebody starts 
a music magazine (or website) called Beyond Category, then 
Sondheim can be a cover subject.

Press Quotes:

Of Ritual-All-7-70: "...if there is a concept here, its 
extremely simple: you never heard such sounds in your life."  
Clifford Allen, Bagatellen

Of Avatar Woman: "...be prepared to listen to universes growing 
and collapsing within their sound worlds."

the quiet meditation of stationary steam engines
-- almost silent, the 25' Corliss was running
quickly and barely audible.

one of the recordings is short-wave, at roughly
the same frequency; you can hear the whistles in
the distance. so which machine was generating a
signal?

the whisper of steam, hydraulic force, heating
elements at a distance, a star or log, as the
world slides against itself; I think of this as
a cascade of intervals.

Cascade of Intervals

http://www.alansondheim.org/whelk.jpg (channeled whelk)
http://www.alansondheim.org/whelk.mp4 (channeled whelk)

Peirce's continuum, spread-out, multi-dimensional,
everywhere intervals, tessellations, cellular automata,
nothing calculated, striations, shift-riding media
surfaces.

Intervals as subsets or transgressions of intervals,
intervals as porous or dynamic; whatever is constructed
is always already under erasure, literally forgotten, 
compressed; Adorno's aphorism is the kingdom of the 
spew and the forgotten; the turn of the aphorism is the
content of the future.

It's impossible to hold back, think, in a fast-forward
dis/continuous morphing circuitry that is not delirious
or where delirium corrodes dis/continuously.

Wittgenstein's TLP was characterized by reduction, yes,
but also dispersion, not-this/not-that; today it
bypasses the narrativity of PI, and that's important in
terms of a phenomenology of dissipation and limited
resources.

The painful move is the recognition that history too
has limited resources, that historiography as well is
a study of dissipation, that blankness characterizes
this dissipation, that history is the locus of reading,
not writing.

Cascade is always in flux, garbage, and irruption, none
of the conceptualism of category theory, more of the
massiness of big data in feed-forward mode. 

Unruly cascade always breaks off, seeks like-minded
lower levels, gathers dust it's kicked up in cycles of
conquest, corral, release, losing it.

Can one think of the universe in this fashion? Does the
cascade seal off, expand, fissure, divide? Are the
divisions similar? Is fissure self-similar? Are the
divisions entities? Are entities defined by symmetries
and potential wells? Are potential wells entities? What
are the commonalities of potential wells? Are they 
referents? Are they tethered cascades? What are
entities? Are entities under erasure? Are protons? Are
cascades built on a foundation of rubble? Is rubble 
cascade? Granularities?

Are there ways to think of this or through this, ways
to short-circuit the deluge of metaphors? Are metaphors
useful as parallels or inherently violent? Are cascades
violent?

I think of the collocation, cascade

http://www.alansondheim.org/cave027.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/comeforyou.mp3

one has two things: an interval and an event.
one bears witness, one dies.
to have engulfed the witness, the interval, to be engulfed.
one can do nothing with one's death.
one has nothing to do with one's death.



Proving

http://www.alansondheim.org/Lombok.png

The qin's difficult; sometimes I have to prove to myself,
after hating what I've done, misshapen, out of tune, 
grotesque, but not in a way I want - that I can still 
play the instrument, that with the proper concentration,
things will work out, more or less, and this small corner
of the world will feel inhabited once again. Here there
are two qin pieces, one (proving) using hands and arms in
the usual position, but moving quickly through difficult
improvisation, and the other (proving) with cross-arm
movement, playing in reverse in other words. Ah, so here
are two pieces working in my favor. The Lombok image is
a topographic map of the homeland my gambus, perhaps 
more on that later.

simultaneous teething, liminal image in 
 liminal space 




silence of guqin

the guqin as an ecosystem, biome; each of the seven strings 
meanders along its own channels, each changes character along 
its length, from bridge to bridge, above the waters, sky, earth, 
each has its own silence, i would capture that, meander, with
the sounding of a single note, dying-out, lowered or raised, 
just that, the arch of the string, arcing, a field beneath the 
strings, above the curvature of the sky, always the entirety 
under tension, always the entirety in resonance, collectivity, 
among which the note, singularity, is sounded, dying out, there 
is no memory, there is no tune that encompasses, no image here, 
i would assign an image, it disappears, vanishes, i live among 
wood, wood and weather, the subtle vibrations of the floor, in 
the midst of the slow steady rain, my arms move from one to the 
other end, from one to the other, athletic, an encompassing, or 
compass, designation among the seven, the duplicates, the five, 
the thirteen, the positions, the sliding among or into the 
positions, approaching the positions, so much memory, i will do 
this, will play to the limit on the right, encompassing the 
right, until sound leaves, broken, tuneless, out of tune, unable 
to hold forth, the position so clear in the middle, in the 
midst, where the sky divides into two, the left, musculature, 
reach of the arm, the right, approaching infinity up to the 
bridge, as if there were a crossing, the pool or pond, infinite 
octaves, bent, distorted, leaving the one note behind, open to 
emptying space, multiple universes, multiverses, each duplicate 
of each, ranging differently, different qualities and weathers, 
the weather of the wood, of the silk and metal, the weather of 
the water, air and earth, the fire of the weather, tending the 
wood among the elements, the wood breathing in the midst of 
other lives, the wood expelling, the breath ceasing, i would 
summon spirits, i would play among them in the hollows, cavity 
of the guqin, i would circulate among the passages, hide against 
the corrosion and deceit of the weather, my hands flee from the 
energy of the extremes, in the middle they find recompense, find 
redemption, the ordering righting in the midst of unknown 
climate, the ordering quietly in procession, here in the middle 
of the night, the strings among themselves sounding within me, 
or am i wood or weather, or am i element or expulsion, what of 
the spirit, surely they, among so many others, the room sounding 
the guqin among, there the ceiling, the wall or a shadow of 
sound or tone shadow sounding, i am clearing, clearing above the 
pools, above the sky and earth, cosmos, clearing and my arms, 
hands, moving, and there among them, and to the left, what clear 
depths and clarity, and to the right, those infinite intervals 
decreasing in length and speed, in movement and speech, those 
intervals increasing in tone and pitch, i can no longer hear 
them, so much pressure on the strings, the clearing stretches 
infinitely before me, there are trees and lines of trees, there 
are people singing, all the animals are there, all the plants as 
well, soft showers and peaceable kingdoms, and the retreat and 
expansion of the single note, all of this, this song i am 
singing, this tone underway, this image almost visible, this 
tune of goodness and kindness, this ballad of no death, this 
pillar of the single note, this mountain hut, this wood old 
beyond belief, i am of the wood, i am singing, this spirit of 
wood and metal, fire and earth and air, surely they



Dinosaur Footprint on La Quinta Inn Chair

accompanied by overly quiet shakuhachi in
La Quinta Inn

structure: I meditate on the weight of a
small dinosaur in a silted lakebed in the
Pioneer Valley, Mass. I meditate on the
ratio of the time taken to make the
impression and the time since then. I
think about the compression of my own 
body against the chair, playing shakuhachi.
I meditate on forms of life and the comfort
of lifeforms and familiarity with the 
world. I meditate on the world. I persist.

2 reviews of Cutting Board 

http://www.alansondheim.org/5004.jpg
http://espdisk.com/official/catalog/5004.html

From the November issue of The Wire (which used 2 like me):

Alan Sondheim with Christopher Diasparra and Edward Schneider
Cutting Board ESP-Disk CD

Since its reactivation in 2005, ESP-Disk has maintained a steady 
trickle of reissues of epochal free jazz albums, archival finds 
and even some new music by Talibam!, Joe Morris and others. But 
multi-instrumentalist Alan Sondheim is the first artist from the 
roster of ESP-Disks 196475 golden era to record new material for 
the label. It makes perfect sense too: nearly half a century 
later, his sound and aesthetic seem remarkably unchanged. Its at 
least partly because he has never tried or wanted to play jazz, 
positing instead a rough and prescient form of free 
improvisation.

Sondheims first album, subsequently included on the Nurse With 
Wound list, was 1967s The Songs, featuring a single, raggedly 
theatrical performance by Ritual All 70 a group of young 
improvisors living in a communal loft in Providence, Rhode 
Island. More or less the same group, recording under Sondheims 
name only, created his two ESP-Disk releases. Ritual-All-7-70, 
also recorded in 1967, sounds exactly like a gang of stoned 
students plonking around on bongos and tabla, but Sondheims 
intuitive explorations on guitars, sax, clarinet, koto and horn 
tap into the kind of no-technique, non-idiomatic improvisation 
that can be heard in countless 21st century DIY dungeons on 
either side of the Atlantic.

This new material finds Sondheim again approaching a wide array 
of instruments, with an emphasis on the exotic including Chinese 
mouth harp, saz, sarangi, ghichak, cura, tro so, sung lisu and 
many more all played with the same exuberant, non-virtuoso 
relish. On Xenon something is bowed with raw, savage 
stridulations. On Argon something is strummed messily in a 
vaguely Arabic mode. And so on. Hes accompanied by saxophonists 
Diasparra (on tenor and baritone) and Schneider (on alto), who, 
at best, help to guide and shape Sondheims brief bursts and, at 
worst, sound a little lost and flailing around for a hook to 
cling to. Theres no pretence of the communal vibe that 
characterised the 60s recordings its clearly Sondheims session. 
But, with so many instruments to play and such a lot of fun to 
be had, who needs company? Daniel Spicer

Alan Sondheim with Christopher Diasparra & Edward Schneider, 
Cutting Board

Alan Sondheim came to our ears years ago principally on the two 
albums he did for ESP, Ritual-All-7-70 and T'Other Little Tune, 
issued in 1967 and 1968, respectively. I came to him a little 
later through these albums, which impressed me as 
uncompromisingly home-made in their DIY experimental avant 
improvisatory thrust. On them Sondheim played guitar and a 
battery of other instruments, neither evoking jazz or new music 
syntax but rather forging his own vocabulary that reached out to 
world musics but only obliquely so.

Much time has passed and apparently also a number of releases 
came out that I have not heard as yet. He returns to the ESP 
fold with a new recording Cutting Board (ESP 5004). On it 
Sondheim matches sonic textures with Christopher Diasparra on 
tenor and baritone saxes, and Edward Schneider on the alto sax. 
Sondheim plays a wealth of instruments, from chromatic 
harmonica, sarangi, classical guitar and flute to electric saz 
and ukulele. As always Alan's playing is about sound and 
texture, not as much typical linear technique.

The totality of the album hangs together as experimental free 
improv more than free jazz per se, though Schneider and 
Diasparra give out phrasings more akin to post-new-thing sax 
expressions than not.

As is always the case with Sondheim, the music suits your ears 
best when you wipe your listening mind of expectations. This 
music has little in common with JATP, standards, or even 
ensemble avant jazz and new music as they come to us today. It 
is Sondheim music and for that it is very good. It is musical 
sound as art. So go ahead and listen.
