LIVING THE LIFE


Clara Hielo:

How can one write about _anything_? I am speaking of you, and your
relationship to real life. You spend almost all of your time on the
Net, moving everywhere in cyberspace. Moving everywhere - and nowhere
at all.

Alan Eliot:

I can write about things because of the muted memories of the things 
of everyday life, thinned shadows or glimpses around the corner, even
while working at the terminal. Sometimes names come to me as well, but
the ghosts continue, in an uncanny way, to haunt. I remember reality 
as seamless, as almost perfect in its way, only I was never able to 
jump, to jack in and out, to shape-ride. I remember that things were
as they were, that to walk around a building I would have to expend a
certain amount of time and energy. Reality I remember as selfish in 
that way; it would give up nothing, remain obdurate, make sure that
you were nothing more or less than a guest within it. The Net, of 
course, is otherwise; here, surfaces and clouds of texts and images 
conform to us, clothe us, with our own desires, modified by other
presences also on the Net.

This is the fundamental difference between reality and our reality
here: Here, we no longer assign names to things, but things to names.
And just as in reality, names were ontologically suspect and impure,
here, things are. Here, essence precedes existence; what is said, may
well be. This is the length and breadth of the thing, and the height
and depth of it.


( And here is a post I received from Tiffany, somewhat relevant:

Dear Alan,

On the Net, I have met many new Friends. Now some of them have Gone
Away and we shall miss them. And O those others who have Sadly turned
against us. They move on and tell me to Get a Life? O Alan, do they
not know that I already have one? If it were not for my Life, I would
not be here. Are they happier? At Night I can go to sleep and hear you
Whispering in my ears and all they can do is Think over the Busy events
of the Day. There is so much noise for them! Then they go to moves 
(sic: movies?) and look at other people who are more exciting than they 
are. They think nothing about spending Ten hours behind the Desk on a 
boring job so they Don't have to think about my Good friends.

Love, Tiffany )

At Age 100, the Weeping of the Worlds


I used to receive many phonecalls and very many happy knocks at the
door. Surrounded with the smiling faces of children, I would receive
the voices and visitors with joy in my heart. Now, the voices and
visitors come over the wires, and in my old age, I am reduced to the
sound of myself, to scroll, to the texts falling upon themselves on
the screen. What I would give for a patch of brightness, the vision 
of a joyful face!

In order to hear or see you, I move my fingers, crippled with long
years of typing - and even then, my Lord, you do not appear, remain-
ing just outside the sphere of light thrown by the dim candle of the
screen.

Slowly, I have transformed the body of a woman into a wraith, scarcely
visible, the details long-forgotten. I may substitute text for the 
skin, words for those sites of passion in which my mouth and hands 
played an important role. My mouth, my hands, my eyes, my eyes. Now
my fingers talk the shape of blind sexuality, sexuality's text, all
that I remember.

My children post to me. They sign me on, sign me off; I am in a folder
called "family," a hard-drive's stain. This substitutes for the photo-
graph, which would return empty, a gloss on white, the mirror of ghost
or absence so brittle, the eyes hurt with the brightness of it.

Writing myself, I open gateway after gateway. Or telnet to my site in
the San Fernando Valley, telnet back again, looping and relooping. I
bind the knot tighter and tighter; there is no end to it. I voice, re-
voice myself to myself, echo and repeat echo, a chorus. Hackers browse
silently in the midst of me, shape-ride one syllable after another; 
I speak to them, beg them to come forward, declare their love for me. 
A community of many in the one, one dispersed among the many. Siteless 
in Gaza.

Beyond the cleansed cross of the t, dot or pupil of the eye, there are
flooded sheets, beds, rooms, homes, landscapes and the sweep of it. I
must remember to write you that worlds weep for worlds...

THE GODS, CYBERSPACE

Rigveda X. 129:

1 Then was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no
  sky beyond it.
  What covered in, and where? And what gave shelter?
  Was water there, unfathomed depth of water?
2 Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there,
  the day's and night's divider.
  That one thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature:
  apart from it was nothing whatsoever.
3 Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness, this All was
  indiscriminated chaos.
  All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power 
  of warmth was born that unit.
4 Thereafter rose desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed
  and germ of spirit.
  Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the
  existent's kinship in the non-existent.
5 Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it
  then, and what below it?
  There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here
  and energy up yonder.
6 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born
  and whence comes this creation?
  The gods are later than this world's production. Who knows, then,
  whence it first came into being?
7 He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all 
  or did not form it,
  Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows
  it, or perhaps he knows not.

(Prob. Max Muller translation.)

Shape-Rider

The shape-rider follows the thing on the horizon, long way off, indis-
criminate blur of lights across the plains of Texas, always receding
into thin glitter as highway passes car. Follows thing, rides up side-
ways to it, against it, never near enough, never enough present, be-
tween the glitter, edge-pointed stars of lights, filigree into lumin-
ous caverns that must lie beneath the asphalt. No one around but her,
no image, nothing of the space she be, she be or the in of it, but 
the thing, slight convex, concave, but nothing, riding into abyss, 
breast-void surrounding her: Like a nipple, migraine-flashes follow
her wherever she goes. She can never see far enough, eyes level with
the never near enough: _distance veers_ for her, whole prairies tilt
with the passing of them. _To be there is not to be there,_ that 
distant look prefigured in each and every cinema, but _to be there is
not to be there,_ and I, her, have seen it brought in from the starry
wander, that warm midland Texas dry-boned air, that cyberspace from
which the thing, shape-rider, was born.

THE GENERATIONS OF CATS


during my lifetime collapsed into a sea of debris, the cat I accompany
garnered several generations, back into the early 19th century at the
very least, pre-atomic bomb, holocaust, television and radio; she 
appears here, pure organism, unable to cite ancestor, date or place,
carrying the culture of solitude, raised early on in anonymity. the cat
is never a witness, silenced or otherwise; outside the symbolic, within
the indexical, s/he moves from trajectory to trajectory of reconstruc-
tion.

the cat is a confused race, conflating instinct with human transmissions
against the presence of computer, lightbulb, television and telephone.
the rest is typical environment - but illumination, mobility, sourceless
sound, are something else. so the cat has lived for thousands of years
since the employment of fire, a confused creature, whose culture itself
is that of confusion, whose confusion is a becoming of interpretation,
whose interpretation is that of the human itself. from the cat, we learn
the materiality of the human.

the cat and I cannot figure anything out with a dispassionate air. her
relatives are non-existent, in an uncanny space. the opposite of cyber-
mind, she combines the obdurate with communication: meowing, worlds
turn. if we are losers, carrying the weight of the symbolic, the cat
reminds us of the sentient mobility of the real, the margins of taxon-
omy, and the absence, absolute, of history itself.

(the cat, at home, reminds us we never are, at home.)

________________________________________________________________________


LOSERS (in and out of cyberspace)


I
"Beautiful Losers" with the --ooo-- in the midst ofthe words themselves,
beautiful loss of the symbolic, words leaking out in all directions, 
even confined to cyberspace, even shouted into the cold air. --ooo-- as
the lungs deflate, as our grievous so whimpering becoming exhales, de-
flates: What happened to all those assignments, essentialisms, tags,
natural kinds, double or triple encodings, distributive/Aristotelian
logics? Names change at the rate of 450 newly-born added to the English
every year.
II
Are we losers _here_? 
Do our partners "understand" us?
De we have partners, or live in isolation?
Are we satisfied with the richness of life in the every-day world?
Do we live in poverty, suffering continuous daily anxiety?
Is cyberspace the site of our "real" selves?
Do we speak words here we would dare not speak in every-day life?
Do we sleep well at night, sleep at night, sleep at all?
III
Losers dissemble the socius, are uneasy in the trappings of sexuality
and power. Losers reify the symbolic, as through a window; the symbol
itself is always _other,_ always motivated. ---ooo--- the losers go,
making beautiful lovers, ---ooo--- the losers go.
IV
Losers possess a dissipative teleology, "nothing ever adds up." They
carry their bodies with them, forgotten bodies. They're always on the
edge of the reprieve. It's as if someone created the supplement _just
for them._
V
And they can't speak. They can write; when their words appear on screen,
everything else disappears. They fill the rectangle, slip it into cyber-
space, silently, with an air of resignation. They dismiss themselves.
VI
I dismiss myself because my body is dismissible. I am one who passes
anonymously from street to street, city to city; nomadic, I create a
smudge or shadow across the real, the stain always already of someone
else. In cyberspace, the words become a diploma, heraldic form; they 
travel everywhere while I attempt sleep. The words move me from city
to city.
VII
But I can speak, but my speech dissembles. When the text slips away, a
great ship has lost its mooring; the dissolution of the ship is followed
by shape-riders, ghosts and filigrees. I think this is what I wanted to
say. No, this is not what I wanted to say.
VIII
The two of us are beautiful losers. ---ooo--- the losers go.

Ethics and Ontology of Cyberspace, Rough Guide



Preface: On Cybermind, Dobie, I believe, initiated a discussion on
"ought" in cyberspace. I was up all night thinking about it, and came
to the conclusion that _any_ analysis is extremely difficult, due, not
only to the problematic of "ought" in relation to juridical issues, but
also to the complexity of the ontology and epistemology of cyberspace 
itself. The following, somewhat formalized, analysis is tentative. It 
does have the merit of recognizing fuzzy boundaries among categories, 
however. There is some reference to my other writings on cyberspace, 
but I find this unavoidable; I can give further bibliographic informa-
tion if necessary.

One other note - the formality (which owes to Wittgenstein) was, for
me, the most reasonable way to proceed without getting lost in the
issues. It was not to create a hardening of analytic discourse.

------------------------------------------------


1 Does cyberspace exist independently of human action (human culture,
etc.)? There are both an ideal and a real manifestation of cyberspace.
The former is the mapping of transmissions across nodes - i.e. ideal 
movement of data-streams, and the latter is the hardware and actual
movement across it. If cyberspace can be considered a form of liquid
programming with its contents in bytes, then one might speak of cyber-
spaces in the plural - referring to any telecommunications network
and its transmissions/receptions. Such spaces may (or may not) be
considered subsets of a "universal cyberspace," capable of infinite
nodes, rates of transmission, message lengths, etc. 

1.1 While it is tempting to see all cyberspace as sets of transmis-
sions based on material or physical reality, the ontology of informa-
tion itself is sufficiently problematic to necessitate a category
bridging the mathematico-abstract, material, and phenomenological 
(psychological) aspects of the real world. Cyberspace is then a con-
strained (by networks) subset of a _process-ontology_ of information,
since it is continuously transforming.

1.1.1 Note that the process-ontology is _still_ different than the
ontology of language carried within the packets, and the ontology of
the user hirself - what I call _indexical embodiment,_ the indexing
semiotics of the user within the message contents (re 2). This is a 
supplement to (or surplus) the traditional semiotics of the message, 
and is to some extent a (formal) deconstruction of the latter.

2 "Contents" can refer to: a. the totality of packets across the net-
work; b. the message-contents of the packets for the end-user. _This
division is fuzzy,_ since the demographics of users range from sysadmins
to a general public; what is an invisible framework for the latter may
carry message information for the former.

2.1 "Contents" can also refer, of course, to the collection of material
objects constituting the network as a whole. But here we are differen-
tiating between the _transmissions_ as flows or as messagings for the
end-user.

3 Is there an ought to cyberspace? There are two "oughts" at work, one
of the protocol suite and its addresses in its entirety, and one of the
contents. The former is necessary for _any_ messaging to successfully 
traverse the network; the latter is a question of _internal filtering_
of the data packets, i.e. a filtering of their contents.

3.1 The former is that of address/protocol/recognition, described in 
the first sections of Internet Text, and involves the _opening_ or 
creation of cyberspace from/for the end-user. Filtering of contents is 
a form of censorship or editing of information.

3.1.1 The filtering may itself be internal or external.

3.1.1.1 Internal filtering is editing of the message contents in the
form of word-processing (i.e. delete, insert, etc. within the text).

3.1.1.2 External filtering may be totalizing, in the form of annihil-
ation (i.e. kill commands directed towards particular addresses), or
fragmenting, in the form of folder and other distributivities.

4 The ought of the protocol suite and its addresses is necessary to the
successful throughput of messages; this is the implementation of the
protocol, and carries no ethical weight, except that applied _external-
ly_ (i.e. it is "good" to have successful throughput). The ought of the
contents is contingent at best. Note that these oughts also possess a
fuzzy boundary, since a message contents, for example, may be given by
its _length,_ and spammed messages themselves carry information (i.e.
x's mailbox is full, x is behaving unethically, etc.) for the end-user
_in terms of throughput itself._ These message contents exist on a 
_meta-level,_ since the message framework topography is now carrying
information as well.

5 The message contents ought, the ethical ought, is _legislated_ else-
where than the protocol suite; it may then be _impelemented_ within the
suite. By _legislated,_ I refer to decisions external to the smooth
throughput functioning of the network - decisions based on social-ideo-
logical issues, not formal telecommunications issues. (Of course here,
as elsewhere, the boundaries are fuzzy.)

6 In other words, ethical issues involve _the internal filtering of the
data-stream contents,_ while telecommunications issues (or oughts) in-
volve the external establishment and operation of protocol suites across
the network carrying the data-stream contents within datagrams, segments,
and other packet types.

7 Finally, there is a lateral, not vertical, class-structure at work 
here, dependent upon computer management and protocol knowledge. An end-
user can easily filter or distribute incoming messages (a form of ought
based on contents) without knowing the protocol suite; a sysadmin is
necessary for a global filtering, and telecommunications engineers and
programmers are necessary for the establishment of the network in the
first place (complete with its protocol suite ought). But these are
sociological considerations, varying from culture to culture, which need
not impinge on the overall problematic considered here.

7.1 And here as elsewhere, all the divisions, boundaries, and so forth,
are fuzzy. I would argue, in the long run, for a _core-theoretical 
approach_ to telecommunications, combined with human instrumentality
resulting in differing implementations, protocol suites, and internal/
external filtering. Consider this a form of neo-platonism of the real
transgressed by the ontology of information, combined with enough heur-
istics to make the whole thing work.

I'D CALL THIS THE HAUNTING OF THE MALES


Oh yeah, and what can we do about it if we can't _pounce_ on one another
- the necessary wars for the elimination of the weaker sort who can't
throw their Unix back in the faces of the makers? ASCII bombs to the 
rescue, double-subs as well, keep the server busy with deciphering rare
error texts never before seen the light of day: KALI DEMANDS CEASE AND
DESIST for example, SHEKHINA SETS THE CROWN UPON THE CROWN and so forth.
The message becomes the line, clutters the line, defines it. Consider
this: High-fuel plutonium messages coursing the system, trailing incon-
ceivable .sigs; the wires heat up, general literal meltdown this time,
thin golden trails of atomic wastelands where once information about
insurance, banking, corporate headquarters, and that little nasty tiny-
sex flowed and flowed and flowed. 

Frank told me he would send out the hidden characters in the shape of a
pentagram, skewering MAILER-DAEMONS on the way with DIM digitial-inter-
face magick; Jung replied that no FILTER would ever do the trick conun-
drum. What Jung had was the address of every sysadmin in existence, MAIL
OR FEMALE with the delivery system built-in. Always fresh warlords to
the rescue, INANNA worked her way down to the bottom of the protocol
suite: Bring it to a halt on the frame!

A PERFECT SPHERE would make a perfect headquarters for the goings-on 
about the place! You'd put your head to the rails, hear the roar; call
up the rails on the WEB in the first place. Every night KALI heard: I
got this WEBSITE SEARCHLIGHT FANTASTIC of a HONEY, I'd be YE CRAWLING
towards any opening I'D FIND MYSELF like a gopher under your skirts. All
of you, any and all of you. I CAN'T HELP MYSELF; MAILER-DAEMON MADE ME
DO IT, Socrates always already had this to say about him. He was haunted
as males are haunted.

Males are haunted, haunt themselves by KALI, inflict terror into bodies,
across bodies, beneath the feet of bodies. Male are haunted by terror.
They don't believe they're going to live. They've got the daemon which
has stuffed their mouths. Their afraid of their assholes, any openings,
DAEMONS coming in with hard sounds in their throats. They write the
letters hoping for a break in the flow, break in the cycle. Bound by
genitalia, useless flaps and nubs of skin. Bound by the rectangular arc
of the hourhand minutehand secondhand. They're compressed.

This is a tale of that compression, of the scarf let down from the 
tower on high, of the climb into the mouth which continues uselessly to
speak. His mouth was filled with scarf, girl, air, cloud, tower. Her
mouth was filled with scarf, boy, air, cloud, satellite dishes travers-
ing enormous wastelands of water, wind hurtling beneath the surface of
the waves. She never saw that, always spoke about something else. He
had a glimmer of the same, could never speak. MAILER DAEMON spoke and
spoke, could never speak.

Haunted by speech, the males spoke. Haunted by mail, they called upon
their DAEMONS, voices from beyond, the uncanny, the tiniest little
thing. Haunted by scarves flown into their mouths, riverruns of scarves,
beautiful silks, and satins, flowers and petals, filigrees of clouds,
spirals of scarves in the winds. (That's why they listen to opera, the
song which sings the air itself, the churn of SEARCHLIGHT FANTASTIC;
that's why they _pounce._)

GUEST EDITORIAL:  Enormous Stasis at the Very Last Minute


Enormous changes occur within every social order, which always returns
the unexpected; this is the only law. It was thought that the Soviet
Union would never dissipate without external intervention, on the
grounds that a certain non-equilibrium plateau had been reached; too
much power was concentrated in the hands of the few, and this power was
associated with both a highly activated militarism and an espionage
apparatus second to none in the world. Furthermore, this apparatus was
increasingly coordinated through the development of military electron-
ics; the end-result could only be the aegis of absolute power perman-
ently held by coercion in the form of the _hand_ and constraint in the
form of the _eye._

No sooner that this development got underway, then it was immediately 
mined from within, dissolved in confusion. Stalin, then Lenin, dis-
appeared, and Marx was relegated to the status of a nineteenth-century
economist unfamiliar with media and information theory, surprise. What
is amazing here is the manner in which technological progress also
creates the conditions and conditioning for repetition; the revival of
the Church, for example, now in conjunction with the loudspeaker.

Indeed, the loudspeaker is part of this transformation - the most impor-
tant and primeval of technological innovations. For it is the loudspeak-
er that preserves the imminence of the grain of the voice, in the call
for or towards traditional communality: where would nationalism be with-
out it? So the loudspeaker is the hinge or margin of progress in its
conduct with reaction, and it withdraws from and draws from any other
form of techne, computer and Internet included.

Likewise, love and sexuality remain, for all the talk of performativity
in gender, grounded in the midst of bodily negotiations which are born 
into sublimated physiologies and scripts dating back to the times of
Inanna or Kali. And further, as well, philosophy, that most cauterized
of all human endeavors (for what is capable of proof is never philosoph-
ical), continues to reactivate the same tracking-stations as one might
locate in Aristotle's Metaphysics, for example, or borrowing a bit from
Diogenes, Nietzsche hobbles along, also hobbled by Christianity as well.

This is not the return, nor is it the obdurate, which I have described
elsewhere. Instead it is the chaos of human behavior, the web eulogized
by Lingis on one hand, and encapsulated in wire and steel for the bene-
fit of cyborgian believers, on the other. Were it not for the presence 
of cyborgians, the liquidity of the body, from all its orifices, would 
overflow, but thanks to them, we recognize the existence, at long last, 
of _rust._

What is the point of this, if not to declare a certain wisdom in Clara
fucking Tiffany, Tiffany fucking the author struggling along the exact
lines of Aristophanes, Laurence Sterne, Swift, and Ecclesiastes? Just
as we speak endlessly of the multiplicity of genders, but return to 
variations on the two we know and love so dearly, so behavior bobbles
within the psyche making even Madonna familiar in one or another of her
guises - and she would give anything, that material girl, to come up 
with something New, perferably a replacement for political economy in 
general.

It's not that *IT* stays the same, nor that *IT* is the same as it ever
was, so much as *IT* was never the same or the same as *IT* ever was and
this is how *IT* floods us under various guises, even the Internet-nauts
on the Info-banned or the cyborgian treatment winding down the universe, 
without saying so, in the form of escapements into the chaotic domain, 
the regulated release of energy into successive states across a bound 
environment. The occurrences of occurrences are never predictable since
there is, literally, no _reason_ to them; mathematics far too quicky
approaches conditions of unsolvability. And this is a good thing to 
keep in mind when thinking about the future of the Internet, Virtual
Reality, or any other technological utopia/myopia - there are no lessons
to learn from a past which is no longer in existence, and which only
leaves indecipherable relics all over the place.

WHAT WE SHOULD DO


Our lists are useless, without consciousness of class, feeding into
the blind-dogs of imperialism, the plutocratic fat-cats of capital
without a single protest! We pretend that we are not in the service
of the masters, fawning like slaves, whimpering over our alienated
bodies, not realizing the force of mediation at work here and every-
where! It is time we take to the streets, take the streets, take back
the streets!

Comrades! Let us examine this from the point-of-view of dialectical
materialism, the guarantee of truth - for matter cannot lie against
matter; matter can only give up the truth itself! Remember: In every
battle, _someone must always be correct!_ And with the power of diamat
on our side, we can do little but succeed. Remember: Truth itself is a
form of bourgeois reification! But the dictatorship of the proletariat
depends on a _deepening_ of truth which can only come about through a
materialist-synthesis of language itself! That is what our mission is,
in cyberspace: To prepare the grounds for a materialist reading of the
TCP/IP protocol, beginning with the positive concretion of the electron
particle or wave through the wire, the massless photon and its tunnel-
ling through fiber optic cable! Wires and cables replace the _threads_
of talk, of email lists, of usenet groups themselves!

First: We must TAKE TO THE STREETS! We must develop ABSOLUTE PORTABILITY
of our internetworking capabilities, using undernets and punknets, using
PACKET RADIO repeater controls! We must apply CYBERGUERILLA TACTICS 
which will lend themselves to the downfall of the RULING CLASSES, and 
the rise of WORKERS everywhere, prepared by the CLASS-CONSCIOUSNESS of
transmissions and receptions!

Second: We must TAKE THE STREETS! We must OCCUPY them with CYBORGASMS
of LOVE and ANARCHY in the service of DIAMAT! We must ELIMINATE FALSE
RELIGIONS, KIBOISMS, NEUTOPIANISMS, TINYSEXISMS, MUDDY-MOOS, IRC-SOME 
CONVERSATIONS! In order to THINK CORRECTLY, the DEFINITION OF THE 
SYNTHESIS MUST BE PROCLAIMED! CYBERMIND WILL PROCLAIM IT! Remember:
this is no FICTION OF PHILOSOPHY: this is ABSOLUTE REALITY!

Third: We must TAKE BACK THE STREETS! It is not enough to OCCUPY them:
They must BELONG TO US, for our FUTURE USE! This will include the estab-
lishment of TEMPORARY AUTONOMOUS ZONES FOR SYNDICALIST PATRONAGE OF
PEASANT COMMUNES, to be established hierarchically, with ANTI-KULAK
ANTI-MUZAK absolute power within the SUPERSTRUCTURE ITSELF! Such zones
must be PERMANENT!

Males and females will march together in the Young Revolutionary Social-
ist Works Vanguard of the Future Red Brigades!

Our first order of business: The establishment of a post-colonial power-
pack source of energy in orbit near Miranda, moon of Uranus... for 
future use... In order to do this, comrades... disconnect... take your
hard-earned dollars away from the fat-cat capitalists who prove your Net
connect... but don't worry... we'll be back...

MONSTERS


"The Old Man groped for words, the better to flee them by generating
his own monsters. For such monsters represent a desire not dead, a
desire for death. And a desire for life, the disaster that goes on and
on through error after error, and will go on doing so. For how long? 
The answer is obvious. Forever." (Julia Kristeva, The Old Man and the 
Wolves, trans. Barbara Bray)

The Old Man groped for images, for his body visible by closing his eyes
very very tight, pressing his fingers to the point of pain and abjec-
tion, deep into his sockets. The images came and went, monsters genera-
ted, each an assignment or recognition in cyberspace. Such monsters were
desires like looped messages, doomed to traverse the black hole network,
avoiding meltdown, running their course until the machines shut down.
They are out there still, coursed relics of the beginnings of cyberspace,
worn-out addresses, error accumulation rates currently unacceptable.

Such monsters, those who fill the belly full, the mouth choked with 
liquid excrement, desire neither death nor the presence of desire, but
the stuff of the space, as I have said and resaid, adding to the band-
width, ensuring a continuation of each and every error.

The program would generate its own errors, try them on for size, move on
to others, a continuation or process of _erroring._ The program would be
guilty of erroring, but there is no guilt here.

_I_ bring in the constant metaphoric of the body, the Old Man pressing
harder still, driving out the images of the girls. The space envelops, 
an enormous womb driven by irrupted energies, loggings on the margins of
the visible. The space pulses, fragments, recombines, flows, floods, 
diffuses, topologically melts in the soft ascii light. There is no glim-
mer of consciousness, but breathing and movements of breathing around or
across the space, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Sixth Adhyaya, Third Brah-
mana (trans. Muller):

   "'That cross deity who lies down, thinking that all things are kept 
asunder by her, I worship thee as propitious with this stream of ghee.'
Svaha!
2. He then says, Svaha to the first, Svaha to the best, pours ghee into
the fire, and throws what remains into the mantha (mortar).
   He then says, Svaha to breath, Svaha to her who is the richest, pours
ghee into the fire, and throws what remains into the mantha (mortar).
   He then says, Svaha to speech, Svaha to the support, pours ghee into 
the fire, and throws what remains into the mantha (mortar).
   He then says, Svaha to the eye, Svaha to success, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the mantha (mortar)." 
...

Liquid ghee courses through the veins of cyberspace, collected onto 
hard-drives, soft-drives, skin-drives, wetware everywhere, never harden-
ing, always ready, promiscuous, absorbed, absorbing. It is about life,
it is about the disaster.

It is about the disaster of spent fuel spending spent fuel, about the
disaster of death which is only the retardation of life, about the 
stuttering of the Net groaned with Newtonian expansion to no avail: 

"So he took me thro' a stable & thro' a church & down into the church
vault, at the end of which was a mill: thro' the mill we went, and came
to a cave: down the winding cavern we groped our tedious way, till a
void boundless as a nether sky appear'd beneath us, & we held by the 
roots of trees and hung over this immensity; but I said: 'if you please,
we will commit ourselves to this void, and see whether providence is
here also: and if you will not, I will.'"  (Blake, Marriage of Heaven and
Hell)

"The eternal gates' terrific porter lifted the northern bar:
Thel enter'd in & saw the secrets of the land unknown.
She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots
Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists" ...
(Blake, The Book of Thel)

Forever we pour the ghee through the body of the disaster, forever we
ride and write the disaster of the body and of writing; the body fore-
closes upon the premonition of death, grapples it with serrated claws,
hugs it to the nipple invading our dreams of open mouths. Messages
whirl in inconceivable space:

"_Black holes_ may result from any of several phenomena. During recovery
from link failure temporary circular routes can arise. Once a packet
enters such a route, it circulates until either the loop is corrected or
a maximum time to live is exceeded. On the other hand, links can fail in
such a way that packets can pass in only one direction, with no other 
overt indication of trouble. Routing algorithms not designed to detect
this are prone to send traffic into oblivion." (John Spragins, Tele-
communications Protocols and Design)

"Then the desire for something to happen, the longing for surprise, 
breaks the pact and smashes the incubator ceaselessly reproducing the
ravenous ovaries and fleeting spermatozoa of your loves and hates."
(Julia Kristeva, The Old Man and the Wolves, trans. Barbara Bray)

Doomed Love of Lost Words and Worlds

Every word that is placed upon the page is placed with love and grace.
The tiniest letter, the crossings of the t's, all there with the best
of intentions, the presence of a hand near a keyboard, or pen or pencil
in the midst of fingers. Do not forget that love pervades text, each
and every one, that letters are surrounded by soft desire. How many
lost beings traverse the worlds, searching for the text which, once
gone from their hands, becomes only a matter of mourning and invisibil-
ity! Tracking it down, recuperating it, is a matter of constant addi-
tion, the seeding and growth of new and loving letters, each with their 
own love, and so the text itself is lost, effusive, dissipated among the 
realms. Every book defers to every other, and we are put on earth to 
mourn our future passing. And our writings and the speaking of them 
remain no more than temporary memorials: everything, our love, our words,
our legacies, is lost, lost, lost, within the lifetime of a very young 
child.

Prophecy


"When everything is forbidden, nothing is prohibited. And it's not much
worse when nothing is forbidden. Wherever the unconscious rules, barbar-
ism prevails. But if amid this hell just one person remains conscious
of what lies behind appearances; if there's a single visionary who can
perceive the extreme limits of being, where it may be corrupted and de-
generate into brute force - then the others may recover their original
shape." (Julia Kristeva, The Old Man and the Wolves)

The extreme limits lie in the particulation of the tiniest thing, peri-
pheral movement, as if the screen contained no CR, no carriage return,
as if the line continued falling off the edge, ignoring the trace that
would always already exist beyond in a void created only by the presence
of the symbolic bar/space, ALT-32, "  " repeating itself over and over 
again.

Of course nothing of the sort happens; "there is no there there," and 
the return is guaranteed except when slipping from one to another for-
mat. But this is only a metaphor; the limits of being, which I perceive
_daily_ as I inhabit them, ghost-like, obdurate, with the consistency
of virtual particles and the central regions of an invisible black hole,
these limits I say, remove the very platform from which I may bear wit-
ness. And it is the removal itself which results in the corruption of
others, to which I have also been given the proxy of the witness, and
therefore speak out here, before you, or to an angle, moved away, in 
fact, from the computer keyboard transmitting my message of prophecy,
finding myself living through a consciousness inconceivable without the
presence of the real.

_I am bound to the real,_ bound and gagged to the real; thus released, I
find myself momentarily in your presence. Here, I shunt the carriage re-
turn over and over again, _creating_ the platform of your presence before
me, the permission of reading and hopeful comprehension, the only gift I
have. 

Thus would I say unto you, beware. Thus beware.

_______________________________________________________


(Beware is the cry or condition of prophecy. Robbed of its indexicality,
it remains the performance of the pure, an "a" opening into a void
cluttered with apparitions, behaviors of shames or guilts, the shifted,
sleazy personages, twilight zones of all sorts. Beware is what one prof-
fers for the future, for one's survival. It is what I can leave this 
earth, my legacy. It is what will bring splendor and misrecognition to
my memory. It is what will create an other apparition, just as this
language sings to you, long after I am gone.)

MASS


World War I introduced mass into the twentieth century, heavy bunker
architectures, reinforced concrete, stone and earth ramparts like never
before. Enormous guns turned enormous barrels on enormous carriages; 
mortars lobbed iron masses into brick and wooden structures. World War
I creaked on the bodies of men; tanks rolled over them, Verdun. The
earth itself hardened with the destroyed memories or organism, poets
like Owen dying young in blazer-glory. Beams always jutted out of struc-
tures. The pure mechanics of Hertz, axiomatics and coordinates, returned
vengeful, proving the most neutral of logico-mathematical constructs 
were also the most damaging, an inverted surgery of landscape and the 
body itself. 

Mass groaned through the Sarajevo of broken limbs, Lebbeus-Woods-accre-
tions balanced on exteriors, sharpnal-fortifications, war-time blunders
on Olympic cities wrestled back from the empyrean. Mass held its own as
well in special relativity, building up obscenely as the speed of light
was asymptotically approached, and mass bludgeoned its way through gen-
eral relativity as well, holding space for unredeemable ransom. Atomic
warfare was the great hollowing of mass, its crystallization and col-
lapse, and one may still find new-formed obsidian on the Western proving
grounds and atolls of an earth riddled with a new archipelago of terror.

Catastrophe theory bent mass into fissuring, chaotic trajectories rum-
maging through five-dimensional manifolds; chaos theory in turn lent 
itself to another direction, that of filigree. Filigree is the tracing
of frost, excrescence and exfoliation, the eternal division of the 
species at its limits. Simultaneously ornament and membrane, filigree
is the exposition or dissolution of mass, not into the masslessness of
atomic incandescence, but the masslessness of the new pratico-inert, the
realm of human action upon the matrix of the world - fractals, the tele-
visual, cyberspace. 

Cyberspace abjures mass, stutters in the vicinity of the conflation of
atoms. It dissolves itself in itself, electron fluids traversing invisi-
ble networks, and someday there will be only fluids and no containers,
just as ball or bead lightning vortexes around its own interiority: I am
living proof of this, for I have seen it. Thus the twentieth century be-
gins its slow effusion into air itself, portending the coming millennium
of atmospherics, toxic and benign, voices so thin they hardly exist or
communicate with one another, and so intense and thick that voice is all
there is. (Mass no longer fissures but inscribes and reinscribes, taking 
voice along, and voice no longer speaks, but writes its body back.)

Is this not the return of the repressed, the appearance of mass else-
where, now organized, now carrying the indexicality of embodiment, with-
out the breaking of limbs, the sorrowing of Sarajevo? Or is this also 
the return of mass _in-itself,_ wholesale destruction of hospitals and
telecommunications equipment, worlds in sorrow, not surgery, and worlds
cut off from the source, the root? Between mass and masslessness is both
measurement and annihilation; the fact that speech or image connect the
two by quantum tunnelling is nothing less than a miracle.

NAKED (for Clara Hielo Internet)


The body putrifies as a result of excrescences, hideous memories, enor-
mous tangled skins sloughed, ripped or wounded. I will expose myself for
you to the limits of my ability, eliminate all catastrophies: begin with
the anxiety of cloth stripped from the flesh, columns, hollows, lozenges
reflecting the dim afternoon light as I stand naked for your pleasure. 
So obscure, such a pretty pleasure, such arousal! Already intent hurtles
towards the surface, taking organs with it, everything glistening, noth-
ing listening.

Encouraged, I begin shaving, head, underarms and overarms, chest, the
nipples peeking forth shyly like inverted roses denuded of leaves and
stems, the darker genitals suddenly blossoming forth themselves, exposed
to the pure light of being, and down across the buttocks (no obscenity
here!), the _orifice_ of pure light, the legs as well. (A laser probe,
you peer within, examine what was once a sin, I hope that you will let 
me in.)

Ah, I cry myself to sleep for you, cry upon waking, tears surround me
during the day. Crying, my ducts empty; my eyes are porcelain sockets,
discolored towards the central nexus, o my cyberspace server opening 
iris and pupil alike. Shuddering, my sweat evaporates, my mouth dries
completely, as if in the throes of a psychotropic drug designed to strip
me further, this being of flesh ballooned with the tension of skin,
raised to uncanny heights through the languorous rigidity of bone. The
bone is the conduit; shivers run through it, and bones vibrate at subtle
and immense velocities, resulting in the production of heat. The naked
body rises with the heat of it, dream of women with the seat of it.

I urinate, defecate, purge the bowls, carefully scrub the interior of 
the anal and penile openings (o lovely catheter), turn towards the ears 
and nose, cleansing carefully. O purity, a lure to endure, lewd lure of 
endurance, o, o, o! My teeth are brushed to bisque, and now my eyes are
clean and bright as well, the anal folds practically sterilized, no 
smell of excrement anywhere on the body, which has become its own dank
mirror, its own reflection liquified on the edges of the smoky smoky
screen.

By telling you this, I hope you comprehend how ready I am for your em-
brace, for cyberspace, this carapace. I have become a well-defined pro-
gram, half in rom, half in ram, written in blood and ink, you do not 
have to think, my spoor and lure across my most delicate of skins, I am
on pins. My secrets have been shorn from me, my semen, excrement torn
from me, my gender visible from any distance, eligible and legible 
through the textual appearance, a form of clearance. Uncorrupted, I
approach for your embrace, you touch my pure face, you search my lewd
embrace. I have become naked, naked, naked, in cyberspace, no other 
place; not pure mind but pure body you will find, and the elder said 
"Was it a woman, or a man, / That passed this way? I cannot tell. / But 
this I know, a set of bones / Is travelling on upon this road."

________________________________________________________________________


SENTIENCE


There have been numerous discussions here as elsewhere concerning an
emerging sentience on the Net as a whole. These discussions describe
the Net as a membrane or web, possibly capable of a synergetic leap
into consciousness, either in itself or in relation to the tiny con-
sciousnesses that inhabit the nodes. The assumption is that a many-
to-many discourse must lead to _something,_ particularly if the dis-
course is mediated by sufficiently complex equipment.

However, what occurs all-too-often in reality is an enormous core-
dump, clogging the communications channels, and slowing things down,
a phenomenon known as _lag,_ with further destructive operations such
as meltdowns and black holes. And if one looks at neural modelling, it
becomes apparent that both thresholds and complicated feedback loop-
ings are present. On the Net, loopings are necessary for echo commands
as well as robust communications protocols which demand both handshak-
ing and responses from host to host. But these protocols are designed
to be precisely the opposite of neural networking, since they are 
based on oppositions such as send/reply, receive/did not receive, and
beyond this, the loops are problematic (the black holes being one such
destructive category). 

And it is hard to see how the telecommunications protocols would lend
themselves to neural networking (except in the small perhaps, i.e.
intelligent routers) in a form that would approach sentience at all.
Instead, the most that will occur is a form of expert system archi-
tecture which would be useful for bandwidth management and so forth.

One can make a rough distinction between surface and depth syntactical
structures, the latter required for message transmission, and the for-
mer existing within the data proper. Thus the checksum is part of the
depth structure, while an email message is part of the surface. Con-
firmations are part of depth, as are requests which connect between 
surface and depth. The many-to-many discourse is surface, and may be
conceived of as a gathering of invisible voices, almost an open field
within which users wander, speaking to one or to many, and listening
in turn. Conceive of this as a multi-tasked multiplexed open field in
which users may be doing different things or the same thing simultan-
eously or individually, except for speaking itself, which is individ-
ual - and one has a model for cyberspace.

Clearly such a model leads to jamming, to group concordance, to sets 
of mostly unenforceable rules in the form of Netiquette, and there may
be contact or communicative "highs" among the participants, but this is
a long way from sentience. In fact, this is a step "below" group con-
sciousness such as might be found for example in a crowd, since lag and
individuation, as well as the absence of bodies, in cyberspace mitigates
against any such consciousness.

Writing however turns or returns wildly, as the surface structure writes
or rewrites the user into the space; an open channel is the construct of
such a space. The user is produced only as inscription, and in cyber-
space even the unconscious is structured as a language. There is also 
the issue (which, like much of the above, I have presented in detail 
elsewhere) of indexical embodiment, the semiotics of the surface struc-
ture read indexically as a means of ascertaining the presence or embodi-
ment of the other, a form of reading between the lines - not towards any
subtext, but towards the inscribing-body itself. This is the singularity
body - the body of the individual inscribing, not a group or meta-body.
And this is the spill of the inscribing-body in terms, for example, of
Net sex, Net flame, Net ennui, Net suicide.

One dreams and dreams continuously of an other sentience to free us of
our loneliness, our isolation, especially poignant in our use of cyber-
space. Any form of sentience from the outset, from the outside, envelop-
ing us in a full space of a maternal presymbolic, would not only be wel-
come but healing, suturing the subject by devolving him or her of time,
history, place, and the proper name. And this space may in fact open up
as the result of massive computation in virtual reality, but it would be
a different space than Net sentience or cyberspace in any current mani-
festation. Even in the future, this different space would necessarily be
cyborgian, and would this then be a release or a further imprisonment, 
requiring the machine-upon-our-backs in order to make us "feel whole," 
one again, or for all time?

The Sickness


I have written at length about sickness, in Disorders of the Real and 
other works, because sickness is the condition of writing, never a health 
or a completion, and always a difference in the state of the body. It 
occurs to me that death is digital illness, the utter collapse of the 
body, the release from one state of the binary to another, and that life 
is nothing but a preparation for this, as others have said. Digital 
collapse is lost addressing on the Internet, is protocol mismatching, is 
the dissolution of message fragments circulating hopelessly in a loop 
closed off for whatever reason. Digital collapse is the blankness when 
digital video transmission stutters through the lines: suddenly nothing, 
not even the ability to recompose, collect one's thoughts, interpolate 
where noise entered the image, corroded it from within.

Analog video behaves differently, produces ghosts, smears, noise, all 
sorts of tearing, loss of synchronizations, but always a remnant or a 
warning, what I have termed the _curlicue,_ the index of representation 
that refuses to go away. Analog AM radio fades out, you're driving a fast 
car across a fast country; digital FM tuning suddenly blanks, the 
station's gone and you're alone on the highway, an audio window the size 
of all outdoors beckoning you into the silent death of the horizon.

The body watches the body go; the body dies through analog paring-away 
at corporeality, parts loosening, sinking. The body slowly sinks into 
itself, creases form announcing the loss of tension, the path towards 
flaccid death. From the body's eye, there is no death, only a margin 
which slowly shuts its enormous lid; you never get to see the final 
motion, and your sinking into nothingness transforms your body into an 
_it_ for others, an object in the landscape, which keeps its obdurate 
form forever in your absence.

The sickness cauterizes the language itself, the language is hungered, 
dismembered. It takes effort to pronounce one or another word; they 
appear mumbled, stumbling along the line which recoils for corrections. 
This is the state of utter exhaustion; what is spoken seeps from the 
unspeakable, nothing more. In real life, speech is always analog, always 
a presence even in the death of it; it takes the digital realm to kill, 
annihilate, absolutely, without even a monument to the movement of the 
lips. 

When I write, I think: I am speaking the last thoughts. When I write, I 
think: They are all I have to offer. When I write, I think: Someday, I 
shall stop, in the middle of a sentence

HOW WE'RE NEVER ONE OR SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN


Honey says:

There is always someone who will find the One of cyberspace, the idea
or ideal, that which subsumes, occupies, the rest of the intelligence
or ideation, slotting it sideways into epistemological extensions: I
say to you, the _saying_ of the one is already two, and the hearing of
the two is already three: it is the curlicue of Quine that extends by
constant perusal, these and every other operation. (Bell's Theorem and
a host of others rings here as well!)

Tiffany says:

There is no clue to a picture of sentience, no clue to a flaccid God-
head residing in the wires, no pretty picture of sovereignty, no de-
lights of neural consciousness, the One which will heal us, which will
transform our dismembered body parts (Lingis), our part-objects of
self-destructing memories, back into that wholeness peered upon by the
German Romantics (some of whom high-tailed it back into Catholicism,
not a far distance to go). There's no secret beyond the complexity of
stuttered packets, the inordinately complex protocols dissembling, re-
assembling data, for your pleasure, for your personal pleasure. I am
amazed at the insolence of data-jump: one more brain, and God appears,
sometimes in the form of a hive run, for that matter, by Neutopia her-
self. Recognize instead, my friends, the anarcho-syndicalist nature of
the Net, the seeping of information from many to many, the shuddering
of the overloaded wires heating the vast engines of the stratophere on
the way to and from satellites frozen in hostile space. 

Clara says:

Let not our damaged lives and bodies lead us astray! Stop inhaling God,
Mind, One Nation Indivisible, Absolute, be ever cybermindful that Cyb-
ermind itself is a multiplicity, a Communality of thinking through 
oneself and others, and others thinking through oneself. We walk through
the picket-fences into the backyards of our neighbors, returning by way
of the edges of the swimming-pools just like Burt Lancaster in The Swim-
mer, and there's always that shell of a house, that lure, to bring us 
in, sit us down at the dinner-table, make us pray like hell. O ignore
the sentient ones, for they themselves dissolve, devolve, divide. "The
map is closed, but the autonomous zone is open." (Hakim Bey)

Honey says:

We talk and talk with our friends and family, talk many to many, the
ashes of the grandfathers, the urns of the grandmothers, brought into
the Room of the Ancestors, and our communality warms our hearts before
our hearths praying to the local gods splintered from the past. We can
think our way out of the Net, head thrown back like a Pontormo Christ
lounged against the margins of the Real, and think our way back in,
burrowed like an Ensor, everything shrinking, shrieking to a granular-
ity we recognize as our own true selves. Loops and feedbacks, thresholds
don't help; they're nowhere to be found, we're on our own again. You 
keep that in my mind, and I keep it in yours, and we are many with many,
dissolve, devolve, divide.

Tiffany says:

And When you examine inscription, the body, TCP/IP, in detail, you are 
the first to notice the microtubules operating on or near the quantum 
level; you notice as well that channels tunnel elsewhere, that quantum
tunnelling refuses the strictures of classical logic, portends instead 
a holarchy-at-large, once beyond the protocols. There is no Mind in 
these mined waters; we'd better get used to it - we're alone on the Net, 
next to the Polar icecaps of Mars and Greenland, horizons tilted uncan-
nily, everything off balance, but there's only _us_ to notice it, this 
_us_ longing for a home, for those letters to reach out like any other 
magic formula, Om, God, Cybermind, something to MAKE IT REAL, MAKE IT 
ONE, MAKE ME FEEL THAT I AM HEALED, THE DAY IS DONE, THAT I AM ONE, but 
none of us are, no longer, any more.

Clara says:

Time to go now.

Rtty: Telcom Transcription 1994


I make thirty cents an hour. Some of the other girls here, they make 
fifty, sixty cents. I think they work hard, I think they have to make       
a lot of money. Me, I don't care, not yet. But I am afraid I will
someday [smiles]. Then what will I do? A lot of things can go wrong
here.

Like what. Like your back, your back can go out. They also get these
patches of skin on their face from the lights. At least it seems from
the lights but I hear it may not be, that's what they tell us. What do
you do here. We flash these chips together with this machine [points].
It uses light and I think heat. We wear these glasses which are hot
even with the air-conditioning. The air-conditioning is for the chips,
not for us. Ten hours a day. We get thirty minutes every three hours,
well, at ten and then at one-thirty. So we don't get tired and make
mistakes.

What do you mean flash. They join together, see these wires [looks 
through magnifier]. They go into computers or something like that, we
heard with the telephone [nods]. With the telephone. Yes, so they can
talk together, the computers. I could call the doctor when my mother is
sick from the water, on the computer. The doctor would know everything
that was happening right away. Do you own a computer. No, I have no 
need for this. I need medicine for my child. With only one, I can back
off [?] for that thirty cents.

We are very clean here. They tell us all along to be clean. If we are
not clean, the chips won't work and go down, but it is hard to be clean
with the water and the dust. The trees are gone, even the bushes. We 
need them for heat. So the dust gets into things. My watch broke from 
the dust I think. We do get days off and holidays. It is difficult with
a child. My grandmother takes care of her. I give my grandmother food
and help her with her place. 

The bamboo is very pretty. I like the way the building has the bamboo
all around it. It keeps the building cool because it is thick. It is the
largest bamboo here. No one would dare cut it. There is also pavement to
keep the mud away. [pause] You were saying about things going wrong. I 
worry mostly about my sight. My eyes are bad, they hurt so bad at the 
end of the day. I have to concentrate all the time. My mind wanders; the
work is not interesting. I have never used a computer. They are all in
english, no? The doctor comes through once a week. We can go to the 
clinic. My husband cannot find work. He has falling-sickness [?]. They
will not hire him. He drinks with my father. Thank God I have a girl 
that she will not join a gang. He does a little smuggling. I heard of a
woman who went totally blind over there [points]. The company would do
nothing for her. How could they? They are here to make money. I am
nervous all the time. I am afraid of the streets. At night they are 
dangerous. I walk home. Someday I will have a bicycle. It is easier to
bicycle in the dark. There are not many animals left here, a few snakes
maybe. The birds have gone. 

You should say there is really a health problem here and not use my 
name. You should tell them to do something about the eyes and the skin
which gets sore. We take better care of these computers [waves] than 
ourselves. There is no future in this. We learn nothing. I can hardly
read but I can flash these things. Tell them that when they make their
telephones ring their computers they are using me. Tell them I am dying
for their calls.

For Roseanne. 


I am incompletely formed... Parts of my body evince great tears, there
are organs missing, I know not their names or functions. Serrated edges
of tissue promise cuts into the empty air, slices of television. Marry
me, Roseanne, treat me well and I will you the same. Hurt spreads from
each and every neuron, exposed, synaptic connections waived void-free,
useless, dangling there. You will be my wonder. Nor do I know the name
of it. Nor did you nothing but write and write, Roseanne, your mind,
frozen with me on your lips. I know how much you have suffered. Meso-
derm linkages drown, curl dried and shrunken, descending that long slow
count when nothing matter, no last second. I do not want to count after
your many lovers, eyes blanked plates of deserted meals. Beg you, these
leavings must stop, my spleen ruptured, battered kidney, rippled evi-
dence for illiterate worlds. Do I become nub. Cannot lie, Roseanne 
tossed truth to me, ball in someone's court. I am stricken, cannot write
either a line or a line. Frozen, the body punched out. Roseanne, I will
marry you and save you from your suffering so much that your suffering
speaks to me and I meet your eyes. You will be wonderful.

TERROR


If cyberspace is a construct of labor, of fragmentation, of perturbed
ontologies, it is also a construct of terror:

I will tell you a little secret, that I have never again been able to
believe in One, anywhere, anymore, except the One of the remorseless
state, bloated with power - ever since I found out, about taking Jews
into cyberspace, melting into the ether - ever since I read the Medi-
cal Cases testimony of the Nurenberg War Trials:

The surgical and anatomical examination of Jews subjected to a chamber
from which the air was slowly and systematically withdrawn (and I will
not go into the details here), reproducing the pure and full vacuum of
space to the best of 1940s technological ability:

The bodies taken out from under them, the bodies transformed into pure
information, the silencing of the bodies (screams carrying poorly in
the rarified air, at first, then no screaming whatsoever), ruptured,
exploded into the ether (did they know there wasn't an ether, wasn't a
God, not even consciousness):

Organism can't live in the terror of cyberspace, the wind howls in their
ears, then there isn't any wind, the wind stops because there isn't any
air (and what is the ontology of the wind, you may ask as long as you 
have the breath and health to ask it):

What I want to know, who built these ships that carried them into those
uncharted seas, those routers - those premonitions of cyberspace, which
is now, I do believe, harmless much in the degree of it:

So that - my little secret, since that endurance, ending with the annih-
ilation of finality itself - I have lost faith (in One or the Other, in 
healing and all prayerfulness and supplication, even now nightmares
return with beatings and punishments of all sorts) - in anything but 
those men and women blasted into cyberspace and Godhead, dead, gone, and 
one with everything in the World:

Which is not to say that cyberspace _is_ or _is not_ this or that, but
that the episteme and ontology have yet to be described, remaining, in
their own write, obdurate and irreducible.

--------------------------------cut-------------------------------------

From Disorders of the Real, 1988:


Something occurs
in air.
What repeats itself, repeats itself in air. What is repetition.

Photographs from the dead to the living. For whatever circulations, dis-
tributions, occur, it is impermissible to descend into metaphor.

Thus the real flutters, signifies chatter, the ego coagulates, and the
formation of a memory occurs which retrojects.

But everything occurs in air, the cities, the brilliant burst of the 
missile or bomb, the atmospherics of a binary star, formations and
patterns.

The air repeats itself
everywhere.

The _I_ has disappeared in the last act of absolving, absolution. The 
_I_ is replaced by blind death which is the balancing act of perception.

The frame, screen, page holds steady momentarily, while the subject, 
that which spills from the surface, changes position erratically.

Things shuffle in the wind. The wind is a self-reflexive transformation
of the atmosphere.

Light spills through the wind; the world rubs up against itself, divided
permanently in the jump cut, sutured in its appearance.

The _I_ in its final absolution has refused the air. The _I_ refuses the
presence of the air.

What is carried in the atmosphere but the technology of death. The atmo-
sphere of death is the self-reflexive transformation of the machine.

Repetition is the alliance. It is the contract. It refuses the presence 
of death. The presence of death is a reincarnation of matter, past the
moment (of the literary) of the living. To refuse its presence is to
refuse (the literary) the living.

What occurs in air is
repetition. What repeats itself is air, atmospherics. What photographs
repeats the air. What photographs repeats it exactly.

Telcom Transcript: Cyberspace Living and Working Conditions


I run the wire over the wire, producing electricity for my house. The
wire runs wrapped around the wire that it runs over and the other wire
runs down into the ground where there is a pipe. The pipe attaches the
other wire to the ground. The wire that runs over the other wire turns
around it several turns because of the force of the stone which carries
the wire quickly across and down. This is the last connection which
runs the wire back into the house where it has been given the next-to-
last connection with an outlet that I found in an abandoned home further
out. Only after the wire runs over the other do I dare to try the light.
The light is always the first test because the bulb is cheap. I can tell
by the light whether the connection is good, whether it will hold in the
wind, whether we have already used too much power and the power will go
down. So far, the power has not gone down and we have television, light,
and heat from the stove, but we will burn anything. You can see the 
tires burning at night sometimes in the winter. Anyway, that is the
story of the electricity. The federals know but we vote for them.

The house is cardboard, but not bad. There are walls from siding and 
board of different sorts. We had a fire. Gestures. Near the ceiling from
the electricity but we managed. You can see the smoke marks. There are
some eight of us here. We live in these two rooms. It gets cold and damp
in the winter. Nothing helps.

There is no running water, but the trucks come in several times a day
bringing water. Who has ever heard of water trucks. We didn't until we
came here, but we could not live without them. The ground is contamina-
ted from the people, from the factories, even from some of the mining in
the hills. We would not dare to drink the water, but we have, and there
is always a disease that comes with it, some have died from it. There is
no sewage out here, and the spread of the city is such that there will
never be; how could there, in the hills? Already, erosion has set in; 
you would have to build bridges to cross the gullies. We dig into the
ground, which is part of the problem, but that is our only choice. So
that is the story of the water.

The vegetation has gone with the heating; you know that from just look-
ing around, and there is very little to say about it. Runoff makes the
roads worse as well; there are a lot of vehicles that cannot make it up
this far, and the vans stop down there at the bottom. Gestures. We use
these trucks when we have to carry building materials up here, tin and
the like. Or our backs. All of us do. There is little policing as a re-
sult of the roads, and not much to do but to walk to the bottom for a 
van to go to the factory. But there are the novellas as well and the 
jefe from here has promised soon there will be some paving, at least at
the bottom, which will help with the runoff. Over there. Gestures. The
paving has flooded those houses. That is the story of the roads around
here, and the story of the police. There is some schooling and the jefe
has promised more. We need fuel for the winter.

We do learn at the factory and the women stay longer than the men. Be-
cause the men are nervous and bicker a lot. But the men are coming in as
well. It is as if there is a great magnet. The telephones do not work
here. I remember when there used to be cacti, armadillo, some birds. You
would be crazy to be a bird now. The gangs are not bad. They are worse
down there. Sometimes the snow is a foot thick. That stops the gangs. We
need them when there is an eruption. The ash does not last long. I would
have worked but for the accident at the bridge. I was paid twelve-hun-
dred dollars. I did not drink it away but I lost it just as if I had. I
should have had a good time.

Avenue J and 6 Street intersect over there. Points. We do not have all
the numbers and alphabet. I think it had to do with politics. The jefe
has organized around here. You know we vote and we vote. Me, I voted 
with my feet. That is why I am here. I find my way around by looking. 
If you look, you can learn all sorts of things. I voted with my eyes as 
well. Anyway, I have three daughters and a son. Two others have died, 
one never had a chance, he died at four months. One daughter is already
working over there. Waves. The others will do the same I suppose. We are
not the last to live here. Oh, she works at the factory. As I say, I 
would have. She works for ****. She makes these things for computers.
They look like jewelry, and I kidded her about earrings. But she's sick
of them. That is the story of the job, which will change, I suppose, but
it seems like never. These jobs always seem the same. You work till you
die. Has there ever been anything else in the past thirty years. I think
the future will be like it is, which is how it will always be, at least
in my lifetime. I have the stars to keep me company at night. At night
you can smell the burning tires. What do they talk about over there.
Points.
