

Less Mess with the Real:

"Other no less grandiose plans exist which may eventually be realized. We
could build a dam from Newfoundland to Labrador and thus block the cold
current which frezzes a vast region of the U.S.A. We could dam the Straits
of Gibraltar and exploit the enormous zones of fertile land at the bottom
of the Mediterranean. We could divert the warm Kuro-Siwa current ito the
cold sea of Okhotsk. We could create in the Sahara Desert a freshwater
lake which would influence the whole climate of Africa. We could deflect
southwards the great Siberian rivers and use their waters to irrigate the
deserts of Central Asia. This and many other plans have been worked out."

Gouschev, 1959.)

Laryngitis

which stops me from speaking as my voice rises to a whisper with uneasy
pitch then begins to die out, body following suit, shaking to no language
known on earth. So I could Net you, but would that Net me? As long as my
hands work, I can @shout, @scream, outmurmur any of ye. And with the dusk
of the vocal, the body concentrating on the _e_ in that and every other
word, _yours for the asking,_ as I wrote to my friend, "say," in Disorders
of the Real, I worry the metonymy of it all, displacing language itself
onto cold trembling: Shall I speak to thee, counsel thee, enumerate my
ways? For it would a hard counsel be, sputtered from body convulsed with
memory of sound and sight, marginal fragments assembled, as I once wrote,
still with aye my life elsewhere and anon: I am composed of scars, molded
and cut into the semblance of the human; aye, and so are we all, and if
they spoke, with what palsy, larynx doing its long sad dance til death? ..

GEARS


I continue to look at Life in the Twenty-First Century, edited by M. Vas-
siliev and S. Gouschev, published in the Soviet Union in 1959, and thus I
continue to be astounded by the assumed equivalence of science with engin-
eering, enormous projects, high-frequency rays providing power just about
everywhere, and little or no thought about issues of ecology or damage to
biological tissues. So-called "pure" science or mathematics is non-exist-
ent in the work. 

But beyond this, I concern myself with the mid-twentieth century, my
birth-time, thinking further of development here in northern Nova Scotia,
where the industrial base has gone basically bankrupt, and where there has
been a return therefore to a less factory-oriented way of life, but a life
that on the other hand is highly _engineered_ - consider the telephone,
television, radio, and now Internet, all these advanced areas of communi-
cation across this and every other landscape, including New York, also
with a lost or somewhat bankrupt blue-collar economic foundation. 

Of course it is a truism that there is not a _ladder_ or fixed evolution
of economic/technological development. And it is equally a truism that
stages upon industry's way may be skipped, ignored, or proven ceilings
bouncing things in an entirely different direction. So on can have for
example a farming community and a CMC community intersecting, without
intervening mechanisms, and without any intervening mechanisms in the area
at all. (And of course even this rides on the assumption that there _are_ 
stages and intervening mechanisms in the first place.)

But further, having read a great deal of Sovietica from time to time, it
seems that the fundamental paradigm applied, diamat, dialectical materi-
alism, was always extended into the domain of computers, only or largely
in regard to engineering and computation itself, no consideration being
given to the opening of qualitatively different or potential spaces. D/G
or Irigarayan flows translate through diamat into dams, barriers, and
hydro projects, _literally._ The body was a function/ary or node; the body
was _mechanism._ So a materialist cybernetics dominated - a science of 
control of heavy industry, within which the body was liminal.

Its liminality functioned, of course, within official history, language,
culture, industrialization, and five-year plans. I'd place the model for
all of this somewhere in the vicinity of Watt's governor, not, for exam-
ple, the superimpositions or Bell's theorem of quantum mechanics. 

The situation was different in the United States, as a result of... _en-
tertainment,_ which stressed the admixture of all values, the experience
of the immigrant, and the collusion of flows with the subaltern body, as
is evidenced for example in I Love Lucy or the Marx Brothers. Who played
with all of them? I did. The _machine,_ for example hot-rod, might rule
outside, but language formed its own inchoate subversions - _not_ a re-
constitution elsewhere, but the problematizing of reconstitution. So you
see, from this, CMC is not such a large step after all, and such is in
evidence here in Nova Scotia as well as across the entire planet - and
what is clear here in these neighborhoods also becomes clear in New York's
- a postmodernity of historiography or devolution of _the stages of life's
way._ 

(I only want to mention, in passing, the _low-rider,_ which, through all 
institutions and capital investment, has remained an interesting and 
fragmentary subversion of modernity and mechanism, while remaining _with- 
in_ the mechanical itself. Think of drag plates, hydraulics, etched glass 
and chandeliers in this regard... There is a saurian quality at work here 
which play with diamat within the deconstructive terms of the Other. But 
this takes us far, into other fields.)

The GEARS have disappeared, _qualitative,_ not only in terms of nanotech,
but also in relation to future mechanisms of pure or impure thought, of
which the Internet and its horizon of seamless virtual reality is only ...
a stage...

ii GEAR, PLANETARY,

because this is a century like no other, a movement towards the organic,
the demechanization of the world - Lucy Lippard's dematerialization app-
lied across the boundaries of culture productions, into the sphere of
everyday life. Miniaturization is no longer nanotechnological in its main
thrust (already a change from a year ago!) - instead, the field concerns
itself with an _omnipresent sentient environment,_ interpenetrating the
given, however that may be defined. In fact, the changeover is occurring
so rapidly that it is impossible to chart even short-term socio-cultural
effects. 

Think of this - it is not even certain where the _physical_ environment 
per se will be located - neural interfacing, for example, might lead to a 
domain of information, just as cyberspace's virtuality is problematic in 
relation to older lived environments (in spite of novels, etc.). In this 
regard, a new topology/topography comes into existence, a self-sustaining 
world of geomatics, i.e. with geomatics foundations, paralleling those 
created through MOO programming language.

In spite of _symptoms,_ there is no precedent for this; no wonder S/M has 
become so popular, carrying attributes of worlds to one another across a 
simultaneous insistence on the body _and_ its simulacra. (So many models: 
cyborgian, prosthetics, robotics, remote-sensing, viral, artifical life 
and intelligence...)

Watch Out!


It's not difficult to disrupt communications; it's difficult to cut them
off completely, dependent on protocol, bombing of nodes or bombing tech-
nology. The node's the thing; there is always the node and always some-
thing outside the techology - inscribe the perimeter, and there is another
zone, unprotected flank. Totality can never be won at any price; control
depends on the depth and width of the potential well - how deep, how wide
your moat, in other words. Miniaturization plays a critical role; security
is always in relation to a system of classification, including a _sieve_
which of course can't touch the molecular within any 'reasonable' amount
of time. Bombs and other devices need not leave trails; the very crudeness
of the Atlanta bombing points, in my mind, to something connected to
regional 'white power' groups. 

There is always a price to be paid for the _safeness_ of the world, from
the technology necessary to maintain the wealthy past their 'natural'
(warning: deconstruct!) lifespans, to airport security measure that could,
in fact, connect with the millimeter, requiring hours per passenger, the
very air she or he has breathed. These measures descend accordingly, free-
fall, to other areas of contemporary life - playground safety, for exam-
ple, or the entire rhetoric associated with protecting our 'loved ones,'
particularly the younger or female (GOD forbid if you are both!) among
them. Protect them O Lord against the horror of rock, the onslaught of
drugs, the impurity of the races, and man-man love, not to mention other
varieties too numerous to mention! 

In a 1950s film I once possessed, the homosexual was portrayed as a slowly
lumbering heavy-set male who looked like he just stepped out of the Polit-
buro. The intersection of ideologies was obvious; young boys were _his_
prey, one for all and all for one, a totality of young boys, boy-mass to
be sure. Lesbians weren't accorded _anything,_ since they didn't fit into
the structure at all; beyond the pale, they were the locus of male desire. 

So danger lurks everywhere, but it must be named, totalized, classified,
sieved, _found out,_ and it is danger that fuels and structures the right,
which defines it. Danger and the right live hand in mouth; one feeds and
devours the other. The right defines 'little ones,' the family, 'the woman
and her work,' the whole structure of civil society in fact. And danger
accompanies the definition; everyone gets into the act - Clinton proposes
a _national_ curfew for teenage Amerikkka and signs the CDA. 

The truth as usual is far more complex, just as more complex systems are
more likely to fail. Ecological catastrophies and natural occurrences bond
together; a 1972 flood from Hurricane Agnes that devasted my parents' home
was partly the result of a stalled storm over New York State - erosion and
forest elimination (both the result of agriculture) had opened the water-
shed for surface runoff, which flowed down the Susquehanna to the first
big flood plain available. Natural or not, it was of course a disaster,
one which probably could not have been forestalled until after the fact
(bigger dikes in the area have since been built, waiting for the next). 

_Naturally,_ then, the only thing to expect is the unexpected; disasters
are with us and will always be with us, and as population increases and
world resources decrease, the order of things becomes more chaotic. Noth-
ing can be done about this, but the opposite - too much vigilence - lends
itself to control elsewhere, as all systems go are also all systems leaky.
Which is not to say that nothing should be done, but that perspective is
necessary, as well as a certain vigilence about vigilence: Who is served
by that curfew, for example, and _Who serves it?_

Lag, Death, Mafias


I write about this from time to time, just pulling in or out of lag, when
the liminal takes over and the gap proves absolute, when nothing shows on
the screen, and the controls no longer operate. This is the edge, the lip
of the black hole within which everything is lost; this is the moment when
it's still possible to withdraw from the _position,_ pull back, recuperate
the skin itself. 

But I prefer to leap, send, transmit, communicate, and so the body teeters
and begins its journey downward. In freefall nothing is accomplished; the
fingers fly from the keyboard, no longer articulate their clean and proper
dominions. They gasp at air which has lost the site of oxygenation. So
words falter and thought, at thought's plateau, is neither responsive or
responsible. 

It's here that the nation-state begins its slow decay, picking up speed,
transforming into competing gangs, slogans stuck into the protocol-mater-
ial of the sky.

Listen, Little Man!


1. "But - it is in the very nature of philosophy never to make things
easier but only more difficult." The flooding of things requires taking
the lower boundaries of geodesic strategies. What falls, takes the form of
the fallen. Mud sloughs from the sides of the stream, destroying the ideal
as Parmenides would have it. The woman floods herself, so that her things
are easier. The man grinds the path towards the nation-state. 

2. "Rather, it is the authentic function of philosophy to challenge histo-
rical being-there and hence, in the last analysis, being pure and simple."
The challenge of philosophy washes away the _block_ of water represented
by the tidal forces at the Bay of Fundy, the _block_ which announces it- 
self by pure presence, every half-day, occasioned all the greater by the 
parallel commitment of the light of the full moon.

3. "It restores to things, to the essents, their weight (being)." Which is
the _task_ of philosophy, this restoration/recuperation, acknowledgment of
the _task_ of objects as well. What is the remainder, if not the serra-
tions of strata remaining, protruding, through the mud, forming the begin-
ning of inscription? Rewritten with the punctuation of barnacles, the 
human continues writing presence, thrown from the cliff against the wash, 
as if something eternal were to be occasioned.

4. "How so?" The question is already answered with the full weight of the 
water which has always already retraced itself, inscriptions lost in the 
fluids leaked from the body, ocean, self, stance, barnacle closed against 
any remainder.

5. "Because the challenge is one of the essential prerequisites for the 
birth of all greatness, and in speaking of greatness we are referring 
primarily to the works and destinies of nations." We do not have a chiasm 
here, but almost, "of all greatness, and in speaking of greatness we" - 
the breathing of the great man against the tides, the woman weighing down 
on him, suffocation in the Bay of Fundy. As if _not_ "for the birth of 
all works and destinies of nations."

6. "We can speak of historical destiny only where an authentic knowledge 
of things dominates man's being-there." The universe is an _event,_ and 
destiny adds its task to history. Already, contamination has established 
its (viral) presence in Heidegger's An Introduction to Metaphysics, tran- 
slated by Ralph Manheim, and it is Fundy's _inertness,_ pro-Fundity, that 
can re-trace _that_ path, which is the history of an entire century, and 
_that_ word, which is its destiny. (Man has never _been-there;_ Man has 
never been born.)

7. "And it is philosophy that opens up the paths and perspectives of such 
knowledge." And _one_ is a philosopher, the tide only to be noted by the 
presence of my eyes doubled by the _overlook_ near the Walton Lighthouse, 
on the way to Truro, Nova Scotia, a _rendering_ after the abandonment of 
the _massif_ once again to the anonymous perspective of the barnacles.

Internal Diaspora


When I was in Montreal, I read a magazine called Exile, I worked on writ-
ing and video interpenetrating anglophone Toronto, francophone Quebec,
bodies, flows, surfaces - the tapes were shown in both regions. My teeth
chattered from the differance. Here in Sydney, I find myself still condi-
tioned by internal diaspora, the disaffection of settlement, the flight
from existence in relation to roots which crumble at approach. From
childhood on, I have been effectively displaced, returning to sites of
disavowal, originating within just another family drama. 

So consulting, I emphasize both community and total access, the communica-
tion among neighbors with limited means perhaps, dreaming myself of an
inexhaustible richness in friendships and institutions where I never felt
at home. If home is where the heart is, it travels with me, childhood and
other traumas tailored neatly into adult vectors of policy. I can only
wonder again whether I see the world clearly, if at all, whether the in-
itself in fact comprises the realm of simulacra as well. 

And whether this tawdry biography is not at the originary locus of theor- 
etical position and desire...

If anideological thrust possessed serrated edges, I would find nonetheless
_slippage_ at my sight/site; through the cracks, returning to memorization
and _passing._ Jerzy Kosinski remains a dark mentor. He did not, could 
not, acknowledge the _day._

	to _events_ and liminalities of traditional or insular cultures.
<conclusion: backup>
1. Therefore, like Cohen's results with the continuum hypothesis in set

	on-line are, if not totally, at least nearly independent of one
	another.

Want


I wanted to write something about how the organization of Internet sites
in Nova Scotia utilizes a lot of lateral interrelationships to create a
distributed network of power. Then I wanted to contrast that with some of
the institutions I teach in, in the United States, and how these are or-
ganized according to a hierarchical model. I wanted to point out how the
latter creates a sense of disunity, and a situation in which sustainabil-
ity becomes highly problematic, while the former, because of redundancy
and the diffusion of power, is more likely to be homeostatic and psycho-
logically fulfilling. I wanted to point out further how such a model would
be of use in many situations, as long as there was a sense of releasement
from the top down - how, in other words, decisions would be "dropped" from
above, questioned and seen as _tools_ from below. I would have gone on to
say that disagreement tends to dissipate with this model, or rather re-
solve into action with less stress than otherwise. I would have further
considered the hierarchical model, indicating how decisions from above ap-
pear as _inscriptions,_ wrytings creating their own domains, and that such
domains would be taken as a fait accompli, a disavowal, disempowerment. I
would want to show that the anarcho-syndicalist model of the Internet is
in fact a _better_ form of organization, one which could be taken as a new
and different paradigm than those previously applied, even ones utilizing
the holarchic approaches presaged by people such as Arthur Koestler and
David Bohm. I would then have wondered if I had been too abstract in my
presentation, and whether it was clearly understood. I would have further
considered whether a concrete example were necessary, and probably, as is
my wont, would have let the text flow in one or another direction, think-
ing through a subjunctive as if it were just around the corner, or a fu-
ture given by the relative absence of metaphor or argument, or considera-
tions derived from anything other than a network of developments.

Cheat


This is a complicated course to chart, but thinking recently about _chea-
ting_ has been productive; a magazine article pointed out its prevalence
and relation to mimicry, and it seems a universal moment in terms of con-
siderations of gender-swapping on the Net. 

Cheating is a form of _passing,_ and this passing is based in similitude
of a part for the whole; _something,_ some _punctum,_ must appear as
_something else,_ something normative, previously assigned within the
sememe of one or another organism. Thus cheating is based on the metonym-
ic, and this opens a realm of investigation, flexing metonymy as a _dis-
solution_ of the real, and metaphor as a recuperation. 

The metonymic slides across the theoretic, as the locus of both empathetic
magic and the fetish, and again _standing-in_ is paramount, the operations 
of surface appearances, translucencies, dismemberments, disembodiments. 
One could assign a calculus, in fact, to this, a primary semiotics, of the 
order of Thom's work on catastrophic linguistics.

One can _see_ where this is going, towards the thetic or originary of the
symbolic, the _coagulation_ of the real through inscription, and emergence
of entity. 

_Cheating_ is thus a _forking_ as well, against which an implicit rhetoric
of ethics is constructed, as if the metonymic were in fact _fixed,_ on or
within the order of proper names as rigid designators. To _cheat_ is to
reaffirm the possible, and language itself is born from an inessential
corruption.

Replacement Reading and the Seal of Approval (1988-96)


Discourse is deployed into the personage: one alienated state against 
another. 

Thus speech is composed, not of the orientation of 'cognitive domains,'
but of individuals close to the zero degree of annihilation.  Neverthe-
less, speech itself is close to the full cloth; it spills everywhere, in 
the form of folds, eccentric spaces, idle conversation, fractality. The 
chattering of signifiers.

Against one or another personage, against nothing at all.

It takes the seal of approval. It takes the seal of approval to cut back, 
restrain, discourse, so that a thread or rod may emerge: This is the only 
text you need.

It is compulsive to carry the text, in the form of a book, manuscript; in
the form of a satchel or bag; in the form of a recording, film, file, vid-
eo. So that the spill garners weight. But this text, and its location, 
gives the seal of approval, grants the seal of approval: This is the only 
text you need.

There is nothing to replace. There is no exchange. There is no commerce, 
no spectacle. There is an alienated personage on the margin, inhabiting 
the text as a form of defense or sublimation. This is the only text she 
needs or is needed. This is the only text he needs or is needed.

What results is the reordering of displacements, which must not be allowed
to continue: displacements in which the whole world makes its appearance. 
So in the stead of this. What is avoided, on the level of the alienated
personage close to annihilation - what is avoided is a form of remittance.
That this is the only text I need. That this in the form of exchange must
be displaced. In order to avoid annihilation. In order to speak, or pro-
ceed elsewhere. An inhabitation in which the 'I' is buried, elsewhere in
the sentence (sentenced elsewhere in this sentence). Or in the replacement
reading. The text which grants the seal of approval. The text which leaves
you off, one point or another, but a point coming up, and this text could
never be that text, nor could any other text fulfill the function of sub-
stitution.

Film Thoughts as a Guide to Past and Future Everything


Well, we're in the midst of jurying the experimental section of a short
film and video festival here in New York, and here are some overall char-
acteristics that might be of interest (please note these do not apply to
each and every film, of course):


_Technology_ is treated in both film and video as mechanical, electrical,
or connected with the automobile. Shots out of windshields predominate. 

Favorite objects include: Water (_always_ a favorite), lightbulbs, morose
stares by young men, twigs, tree branches against sky (often rotating),
shifts (dresses of sorts), and eyes. 

Objects which have lost ground from last year: Train tracks and breasts 
(female).

Mood: More morose than ever, less autobiographical, post Sonic Youth
sound-tracks, depoliticized, oddly asexual, de-energized for the most 
part - a kind of lassitude or languor sets in.

Mood implications: The _elegaic_ seems predominant, signaling the end of 
independent film and video beneath the signifier of government intent on 
eliminating the last futile radical gestures of the artworld.

Surprises: A great lack of community, as someone pointed out - characters,
where they appear at all, almost never relate to one another. The edginess
of Godard or the avant-garde has given way to a now empty existentialism
in the Sartrean sense (Nausea for example). One is born and borne alone in
the world; a certain romanticism which continues to exist only points in- 
ward, towards itself, the uselessness of the romantic fallacy recognized, 
and "things fall apart."

Sound: Almost always non-sync, occasionally looped, use of "somber" elec-
tronic tones, from cello range downward. Musics of great portent which are
never answered. Voices are often inadvertently muffled, almost inaudible,
as if the _saying_ of things would lead to immediate withdrawal. 

Motto: Tragedies are not permitted, and this robs the fates of their
energy.

Self-Portrait with Computer


As a child, I loved and played with a Japanese abacus my father brought me
from Korea.

In highschool, I learned log and loglog sliderules, but I was terrible at
differential calculus, and this seeming _inability_ has followed me
throughout my life.

In 1968, Greg Johnson and I built an analog music synthesizer, employing
some of the features of the Moog synthesizer of the time; I used this in
numerous recordings and performances until 1988.

In 1971, I did a series of video/text pieces, using various computers; I
did none of the programming myself. The two main works to come out of that
period were 4320 and Typed Glossolalia.

4320 took advantage of Charles Strauss' programming on the IBM 360 with a
graphics engine; he had programmed a three-dimensional projection of a
hypercube which could be manipulated with various controls, including
joystick.

I sat various subjects down at the controls, and asked them to "move"
through four-dimensional space, turning the hypercube orthogonally so it
became a cube, turning the cube orthogonally so it became a square, and
reducing the square to a point - hence dimensions 4/3/2/0. The various
videotapes, photographs, and texts that came from the project documented
the subjects' abilities to move through these spaces, inhabit them - an
early version of cyberspatiality.

The Typed Glossolalia piece involved random typing into a computer, which
then attempted, through time series analysis, to find patters - i.e. to
see if human determinism existed in actuality. The idea was, that if such
determinism existed, there would be predictability involved. As far as the
analysis went, there wasn't, but this was also dependent on some thinking
about Newton's equations in the calculus of finite differences. (Greg
Johnson did the programming here.)

Around 1977, I bought a TI59 programmable calculator, which used a variety
of assembly language. I made a number of pieces with it, investigating the
behavior of the machine at its limits. I still continue work in this di-
rection, programming a Psion 3A similarly, but with more complex tools at
hand. I also began a language program on the TI59.

In 1977-78, I was at the University of California, Irvine, Art Department.
The Computer Department gave me free reign on a Terak minicomputer, with
ten inch floppies, and I taught myself UCSD Implementation Pascal. I pro-
duced a number of works, including an active hypertext piece/editor - the
user would type into the machine, and the machine would alter the lines
according to predetermined and/or random procedures, including word sub-
stitution, phrase substitution, noise, and so forth.

I also created a second program, using the Turtle work designed by Papert
among others, in order to create a drawing on the screen; the drawing was
produced directly by the string of text which appeared at the bottom,
typed in by the user. Eventually the two would collide and obliterate
each other, and the process would begin again. I spent a great deal of
time working to create "aesthetically pleasing" drawings, according to
the then conceptual neo-geometric aesthetic.

During this same year, I worked on Buchla and Moog synthesizers together,
chaining three of them for various pieces produced in the basement of the
UCI Music Department.

In 1983, I bought a small TR computer from Radio Shack, without any memory
or disk capability at all. It cost $100 and I used it for programming var-
ious functions and examining their behavior; I also made a number of ster-
eo photographs and films using it, including a journey through a four-dim-
ensional ellipsoid. I was programming only in Basic. Some of the results
of this work are also in my Disorders of the Real, 1988, but assembled
from texts and work completed 1984-85.

I had also used, that year, a small Timex computer which I bought for $25,
with a primitive interface to television; I created a number of films us-
ing it as well.

In 1986-7, Denise de la Cerda and I set up an analog music studio with
numerous analog computer components, both factory-built and handmade; as
Damaged Life, we performed and recorded with them.

In 1993, I began using an old IBM XT on the Net, and programming in Basic
on it, later Qbasic on a Compaq Presario 486/25 and this current AST 486/
33. The programs included everything from simple artificial life demon-
strations, to various studies of fractal and chaos theory. The computer
has become more of a window to other machines; using a linux box in 1995
at Parsons, I modified a Nuts talker, following earlier work on an lpmud
residing still in DOS.

In 1992, I set up my own small analog video studio here in New York.

In 1992-4, I had three residencies at the Experimental Television Center
in Owego, New York, where I used two Amigas plus an analog video synthe-
sizer to produce works dealing with sexuality and postmodern geography;
these were shown in a series of shows at Millennium Film in New York and
elsewhere.

In 1994-5, I taught myself the proper use of the Chinese and Japanese
abacuses, working them for meditation and some video works.

Between the dates above, there was straightforward film/video/photography
and writing above all. Computers came in and out of my life, centered
around particular concerns; the writing remained and remains a constant.

I never could program well, but I could and can create elegant mathemati-
cal graphics, demonstrating various structures which continue to interest
me. I've learned over and over again my own limitations, begging others to
help me with one or another language, or even implement some of my ideas
directly. This is as far as I've gotten, and always so short of time, as
far as I will ever get.

Gruel Shhh...


In Sonnets to Orpheus, I, 13, Rilke writes, as if Christina Rossetti 
responds: 

	Wo sonst Worte waren, fliessen Funde,
	aus dem Fruchtfleisch ueberrascht befreit.

	Wagt zu sagen, was ihr Apfel nennt.

Which is translated by Norton:

	Where otherwise words were, flow discoveries,
	freed all surprised out of the fruit's flesh.

	Dare to say what you call apple.

The _daring_ is the presence of language which is already defeated, but
returns _within the sonnet itself_ as Apfel. So that the murk resolves, an
early production of _wryting_ (in the technical sense) in the form of a
_wager_ or strategy which encapsulates emergence, modalities, within a
word, Rilke's reportage. 

But then, "Where otherwise words were, flow" as if a dialectic is estab-
lished between mouthings and othering (above, Rilke states "Tod und Leben 
in den Mund," "death and life into the mouth" followed by "Ich ahne," "I 
sense").

The opening of the sonnet is the opening of the mouth which engorges from
"Voller Apfel, Birne und Banane," "Full round apple, pear and banana," 
until the presiding of the last moment of exculpation, "O Erfahrung,
Fuehlung, Freude --, riesig!" "O experience, sensing, joy --, immense!"

(When you talk and chew together, when your mouth opens, reveals food
half-digested, dribbles across your full lips, their corners garnering
secrets, runnels overhanging the reach of chin, neck, smeared sweat,
sweet juices between your breasts - when all devolves _accordingly,_ 
time suckles, open-houred at your honeyed nipples.)

And mouths open over the poem, over your body, mouthings mouth bodies giv-
ing them their forms - here a primitive topology, that of the revelation
of the interior, world gone inside-out, no other matrix. Or a Jordan
curve, silent imperturbable _description_ of the interior, the perching of
the rim, not here however which, like plum dumplings, is swollen, almost
to the point of moist feces, flooded bodies, I'd say silent embarrassed
smiles given to the world above.

Conferencing


Let's think about conferencing a bit more. I mentioned in a previous text 
that a conference should possess three components, to reach the maximum 
demographics - a gateway Web page with graphics at a maximum of 30k; a 
system of one to three email lists (preferably listserv) in order to fos- 
ter discussion based on papers that would be on the page; and a talker 
that would be useful for synchronous discussion. And I was, and still am, 
of the opinion that little more is needed for reasonable in-depth confer- 
encing; the only thing missing would be whiteboard.

There are currently organizations experimenting with IRC as well, not so 
much for the chat (although that, too), but for the dcc ability to send 
files quickly back and forth. But IRC is subject to netsplit, and unless 
one has a separate server, to hacking as well.

Let us think further about the phenomenology (in the descriptive sense) of
the three components mentioned above. The first, the gateway, is by and
large a _data-base,_ a registration-and-retrieval node. It is the library
of the conference, containing its primary materials. Within the Freudian
model, it is the _super-ego,_ articulating and frameworking everything
else. Registration occurs through the gateway page, which is then a rite
of passage as well. 

The second component, the system of email lists, is the Freudian ego, the
relative centering and decentering of positions - both extensions and con-
tradictions of the gateway data-base. If the data-base is _time zero,_
lagless and inert, the email list system is temporal retardation; posts
are _plateaus,_ and threads guide them in the sense of formal structure. 
Messages are temporally ordered, but there are discrete intervals between
them (even if the interval is zero). A measuring-process is at work. Ar-
chives return the list to stabilized data-bases, and might be made avail-
able at the gateway site. I would say that most of the conference _labor_
would occur through the lists - as well as most of the _networking._ After
all, each post is accompanied by a personal return-address.

The third component, the talker for synchronous discussion, both repro- 
duces the "liveliness" of an off-line conference, and provides the least 
useful content. It does, however, create both a sense of belonging (one 
"joins" the on-line conference, not only by formal registration through 
the gateway, but also by participating in live discussion - the guarantee 
of _speaking_ as a rite of passage), and a sense, rightly or wrongly, of 
the speech of others, their personalities and rhetorical tropes in real 
time. The talker relates well to the id, flow, driving-mechanism; in a 
sense, it creates the greatest sense of risk for the participants.

Eventually, these modalities will be superseded or extended to include
live video and audio; this is a certainty. The give-and-take of talker
_typing_ will be a thing of the past, pleasing the managerial class which
tends to abjure any sort of manual labor (reading and writing on email 
lists is unavoidable if one wants depth, but then, who wants depth?). 

Two things will occur: the dominance of id-fluxes across the conference 
as a whole, and a sense of _authenticity_ in relation to the alterity of 
the other, as a result of the relative _granularity_ of audio/video, com- 
pared to the coolness and introjection/projection of text-only.

A third result might well be increased skimming of _content_ - particular-
ly cultural/rhetorical (as opposed to political/corporate/operational),
since the audio/video rush will tend to dominate. The email lists, curren-
tly the major source of thoughtful response, will suffer; id will over-
power superego, which will be relegated to the bureaucratese of the sec-
retariat. (Note by the way that the content-division above has repercus-
sions in terms of simulacra and critical theory. These oppositions aren't
_necessarily_ oppositions, but play out as-if.)

In the meantime, however, the three components, running across lean mach- 
ines, software, and applications, provide the best approach to extended 
conferencing with broad demographics.

CD and Tattoo


I finally installed an external CD-ROM drive on three computers here, with
considerable difficulty - configuring the partitions and config.sys in
particular. Now that it's running, I find I must create icons in some ca-
ses but not in others - for the disks to run, blessed be the disks. But I
want to ask: Is this the future of sound and sight? Weaving my way through
fast-forward or fast-backward information-shuttles creates cubism out of
hypertext, shifting planes which attend to extraneous elements designed to
seduce and retard. The entire _affair_ is just that, one of seduction. 

My favorite disk to date is Chinese Comment Idiom and Games, created for
Chinese children to learn the rudiments of the written language. I do not
understand a word of it; there is a Tetris game with four characters per
piece - as the piece descends, they're _spoken_ by a friendly voice. Un-
known speech piles on unknown, a pure blessing-matrix of sound coupled
with a much-too-slow game. But I am aware totally that I am in the _virga_
of the unknown, that it will never come to fruition, that it is the _text_
which opens portals, postures alterity, presences the resided world for
what it is and is not. 

Now is this the future of sound and sight, and of body, taste, touch, and
smell, broken up into shattered planes of menus, not manifolds or mem-
branes stretched almost to the tearing point, the rip-tide - a future in
which the body is simultaneously cut and sutured, remolded and discarded?
I would call this a cyborgia of pure absence, neither ghost nor uncanny,
but continuous dissection and momentary micro-reintegration. The skin of
the shape-rider sloughs at each moment of construct, but no one waits
around to read the desultory tattoos upon it, or the retardation of the
tales they tell. 

They're _all_ in this pattern, engorge/disgorge: the _anorectic future,_ 
of which I have had much to say, elsewhere.

Badly Written Post but An Interesting Quote


Herbert Schiller, in Information Inequality:

One more time in American history, a new communications technology is
being promoted with uncritical acclaim, while it is being turned over to
corporate management. Cautionary voices, and there are a few, point out
the folly of the current policy. George Brown, for example, the former
chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, insists
that "Our most serious problems are social problems for which are there no
technical solutions, only human solutions." So, too, Les Brown, veteran TV
critic and observer, playfully notes "The Seven Deadly Sins of the Digital
Age," which he sees as: "1. Inequality; 2. Commercial exploitation and in-
formation abuse; 3. Threats to personal privacy; 4. The disintegration of
community; 5. Instant plebiscites and the distortion of democracy; 6. The
tyranny of gatekeepers, and 7. The loss of public service values and soc-
ial responsibility." These warnings remain unacceptable to dominant think-
ing and there is no reason, therefore, to believe that the information
highway outcome will be more satisfactory than media technology uses have
been throughout the twentieth century. 

-----------------------------------------------|

I want only to note here, that on these lists, while five of the Sins have
been discussed repeatedly, instant plebiscites and gatekeeper tyranny have
not. I find the latter has taken on the characteristics of a social field,
rather than problems based primarily on top-down decisions - there are
many instances in which hackers or techies exert far too much power in
other areas of decision-making. While I tend to love these concerns,
within the free fields of networking Lan and Wan (some wonderful advice
recently on hacking Dos from Windows in 2600's second to last issue, won-
derful for an amateur like myself), techies tend to side against the arts
vis-a-vis the _humanities_ - it's that old situation of two cultures
again. I've seen this play out in all sorts of various ways. And hackers
or techies pull the strings in cases where decisions might be better made
by people directly concerned or involved with social issues. These people
are often seen as surface (and judging by some of their writing on CMC,
many of them are). 

I'm wandering, tired, and apologize, but there is a germ of something in
the above that needs attention. The issue of plebiscites is even more
complicated and important - and rarely discussed - although, come to think
of it, consider sites like Firefly or my.yahoo.com - intelligent agent
sites - as plebiscite-based and you find an oddly perturbing narcissism
and decathecting from the social in the midst of information management
that is supposed to ultimately create more time and space for real life
and all its socio-cultural responsibilities...

You Earth!


Near dawn, near five in the morning here, I am going to sleep; this day, 
I have napped far too much, out of necessity, unable to stay awake, my 
schedule in shambles

But I do rise and I am privileged to see the great cycles of the day and 
night softly shutter our planet, and this is a privilege that could only 
come through Internetting everywhere

For I see you signing off and signing on, one by one by one, whole con-
tinents of you, the Australians now towards evening as my body trembles 
waiting for tomorrow-here, Europe bleary with morning logins, America 
sleeping soundly behind me

And some of you greet me on MOO or talker or ytalk or email, beginning or
ending your day as proclamations embrace the world, small dreaming in my
hands, planet-earth beneath me as my fingers touch keys, laptop, bed and
building, down deep into the rock strata beneath the dark cement, chords
connecting me to you, wherever you are

This amazement, this space, these points, felicitations ! The planetary 
membrane, inscriptions like lightning, sparks everywhere, moving through 
all continents, slowly gathering speed - wait, you'll see ! Dawn, haze, 
beautiful suns !

Hello, hello !

Good night, good night !

Good morrow !

Sucking the Net


The nineteenth-century pump organ underwent different evolutionary paths 
in England and America, the Professor said, and we should pay careful 
attention to this. In England, it was all blow; the bellows pressure was 
above normal, and could be raised to any degree. While this created the 
potential for leaking, it allowed for extremely high-pressure in the 
system, resulting in an instrument of considerable loudness.

In America, it was all suck; the bellows box was in a partial-vacuum
state, and sucking created a tighter fit; there was less leakage, and less
wheezing. On the other hand, the sound was softer, somewhat sweeter as
well. 

Now, she continued, we can apply these very principles to the Internet,
devising a new system of transmission. Consider servers which would no
longer _serve,_ but _suck,_ guiding the packets in, by virtue of a rela-
tive _absence_ at their end. Everything would rush in; the protocols are
be necessary only to filter out unwanted noise allowing only what the user
desires to enter his or her system, surely placed upon the lap.

In sucking, of course, this noise might also prove of interest itself -
one could use it to examine _snoopers._ Allowance could be made for a bit
of the organic, so to speak, and a careful monitoring of listening _ears._

I was fascinated by the Professor, indeed charmed by her. And this princi-
ple seemed utterly revolutionary - why had I not thought of it on my own? 
Just as America sucks throughout the nineteenth century, it could now suck
as well on the Net, or rather suck and suckle the Net. Open ye gates, and
all will come, in one or another form. And the female form, of course, can
come as well as the male. 

I owe all of this to ruminations gained while playing my New England melo-
deon, a small sucking organ I borrowed years ago from the Music Depart-
ment. Meeting the Professor, of whom I had heard for years, her brilliant
yet quaint theories, only put the nail in the box, hammering her findings
deep into my head, in a manner that could be taught and spoken of, and
passed on to you, the reader, hoping that you are sucked as well.

Wizards, Politics

One saying I am fond of: Build an application and both community and net 
sex will come. Another: Every MOO is a panopticon. 

Every wizard can change just about everything. The degree of power is 
frightening. 

But another saying: Build a MOO and there is politics. And the politics 
always develops back-room, in part because of whisper, page, email, etc. 

The point? To develop _another_ database with a sysadmin who couldn't 
hack it himself. To develop one with PGP or similar built in, translation 
based on passwords. To have these passwords external to the MOO.

Or: Build a talker in which .private automatically encrypts its contents.
Have the keys shared by interior players. 

The _addiction_ to the MOO is the addiction to the political, to the 
wages and fortunes of men and women simmering at love and war. It would 
happen anywhere.

Here it is stronger and said. Here it is a foundation of spent lives,
lives spent. I found myself. 

Meet me in the corner.

Defining Truth


I'm typing again blood-red letters against black, the slight purples I had
been using beginning to pulsate on the screen, slow sinusoidal waveforms
as if a sea-change had flooded the terminal, loading wet transparency 
shimmering across skin and sky together.

Blood-red, anarchy and communism, march across the screen, closing the lid
on the history of the twentieth century: I salvage the colors for this
text and none other, returning shortly to the blankness of black against
white, imitation pages lost forever. 

Likewise, ASCII which may well disappear, possesses its regimented charac-
ter, letters slotted into an X-Y grid of pre-existing compartments. This
metaphoric and bleary reconstitution of _mass-man_ gives way to spatially
self-determining symbols - as if there were an essential freedom and hand-
craftedness at the heart of computer-mediated-communication. 

Eventually, communication becomes a drowning-pool of technologies, black 
waters at the bottom, white symbols at the top - almost too-white, the 
color of surgical sterilization. White devolves once again into the rain- 
bow and we're given colors we had abandoned. We swear we never know they 
existed. We gesture approvingly towards certain combinations. They're 
charted. <Red and black> is not among them. The clock ticks as the text 
proceeds. 

It's disovered that the truest replies are the quickest answered. Truth 
is given a definition.

Slowdown


I just bought a Hewlett Packard 110 laptop for $15, without a power sup-
ply. Made in 1984, it's one of the first laptops, with a small screen; I 
can't power it up until I find more data on it.

It's only twelve years old, and already an antique. The speed-up of the 
Net, however, which last year reduced, in the popular imagination, a 
physical year to four Web-years, seems to have slowed down again. Java 
has exhausted itself as a headliner. There's an inert force working all 
the time with text-based applications. The Web's still mostly unavailable 
vis-a-vis cable modems, and remains slow. The only people making money on 
the Net seem to be associated with reflexive businesses, i.e. businesses 
which promote the Web and the people promoting the Web. 

I believe the slow-down has also occurred with overall demographics - the
exponential slope is beginning to level. At the moment it may be a situa-
tion of overkill. Note that bad publicity is on the rise again - the AOL
19-hour glitch (which isn't that unusual for an ISP), a 14-year-old sodom-
ized on Long Island by someone who initially approached him through the
Net, and so forth. Not to mention all the doom-saying death-of-the-human
essays floating around. (Not to mention the feeling of Web-burnout, use 
of _cool/kewl_ and still my unfavorite demon, _killer app._)

The slow-down is great, if it's really happening. Maybe things will deep-
en. I've noticed a slow growth in the Cybermind list (we're mentioned in 
Harley Hahn's The Internet Complete Reference, by the way), after months 
of remaining at around 270. We're currently near 315-330, depending on 
the day. People hopefully are moving towards other kinds of discourse and 
dialogic than what "Web-surfing" alone has to offer.

Now if anyone could send me information on the HP 110 power supply and 
cables...

Many many circumstances man

Read the writings I have written after I have died; read it and reread it.
Read the body of my work, the work of my body: You will hear my voice. The
larger the body the greater the voice; the greater the voice, the more the
circumstances. Read the textual body and keep me alive in many many circ-
umstances. 

I will be the Many many circumstances man to you.

Kyberspace


The phenomenology of traditional space within a software application in-
volves a movement across directories, links, subprograms, or procedures. 
The individual using the application constructs an internal history file
which often is bi-directional, forward/backward. Lars Pensj|'s lpmud and
database (worked on also by Olaf Kolbu) offers a maze in which entered
directions (north/east/south/west) do not necessarily result in the abil-
ity to construct a _coherent_ internal representation or "mental map"
since a _random function is involved._ The maze consists of five rooms,
with an escape; beyond the escape, however, one may wander endlessly
among them, _as if the space were continually unfolding._

A _second wandering,_ by virtue of the random function, would produce an 
entirely different result.

Before continuing, I present a summary below of one of the maze rooms 
(maze3.c) - not the code itself (the summary is slightly modified to the 
extent I have also modified the maze in my reconfiguring the lpmud data- 
base library):


-----------------------------------------------------------BEGIN
The Interior Enfolded Indefinite Maze 
(as Defined by Lars Pensj| and Olaf Kolbu)
-------------------------------------------------

[the exit number is an integer]

	[the short title is "Invagination"]

[The long title is "Enfolded Invagination"]
["You can choose to go North, South, East, or West."]

[Begin and Reset]
	[Let the exit number = a random integer times 4]

[If exit number = 0,1,2,3 create an action in which player is moved to
equivalent space 1,2,3,4,5 with 5 exit - the action dependent on a com-
bination of player's call (North, South, East, or West) and exit number
(i.e. if North and exit number then {action1} else {action2}.]

-----------------------------------------------------------END


Now what comes to mind immediately is this: Create a _recursive space_
that repeatedly calls itself until an exit configuration is reached,
appearing - for the play hirself - equivalent to the above. In this case,
the program/room is a _singularity_ that continually and randomly unfolds,
_from the perspective of the player, and the player's internal represen- 
tation of the space._

A further development includes the notion of a _code string,_ XYZ, each
taking the value of one of "n" "s" "e" "w". This gives us 64 possibili-
ties. As the player continually enters in directions, the program parses
the string, looking for the match; the match leads to exit. (We are not
randomizing the player's input here.)

A. Consider XYZ _built-in_; then the maze appears simply solvable. Return 
to the recursive space, and the same input will produce the same output.

B. Consider XYZ _randomly-generated_; then the maze appears as the maze3.c
example above; the difference is only that random generation is called
upon only once. 

C. Consider A and B in combination; then the maze appears solvable, and is
- but there is also _leakage_ - for example, "esw" may be built-in, but
exit-operative only 30% of the time. I think of this literally in relation
to the concept of a leaky signifier, whose content always includes an es-
cape-clause or "curlicue." 

Now all of this could be built as well, say, into a MOO space: A single 
room from the viewpoint of coding/parent, but one that appears multiple, 
with escape routes that continually resonate with one another, with other 
rooms with identical or different descriptions...

What is fascinating in all of this is the _broken mapping_ between surface
and deep structure. Admittedly, in CMC, mapping are broken all over the
place, but this example is fragmented in a manner recuperating postmodern
geography, a singularity harboring multiplicity, the multiplicity from the
viewpoint of the player almost toppling the psychogeography of the applic-
ation. For mental maps no longer hold in these regions (I have coded MOO
rooms in which _A_ leads to _B_ with the exit "down" and _B_ leads back to
_A_ with "down" - and lpmud rooms in which "north" from _A_ leads to _B_
but "west" from _B_ leads to _A_, etc.) - and the regions are, in fact, in
a state of flux, upheaval. The mazes and recursive spaces emphasize these
fictions, and their phenomenology vis-a-vis the player. And I think in the
long run, they provide a different sort of foundation for thinking about
Kyberspace than gender/switching, MOO and talker transport, and IRC phen-
omena, all of which have a fluid but more or less coherent Euclidean sub-
structure. maze3.c lends itself _elsewhere,_ related directly to the sick-
nesses of virtual reality, within and without the textual domain of pre- 
sence, desire, and projection.
