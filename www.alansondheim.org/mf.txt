existence seems to thud; I was raised on Sartre's Nausea; it's the
distance that keeps me sane; i can see through or within a haze at times;
this doesn't need drugs; the haze has its own structure; it's a koan; it
opens a space of writing; i could die in or through that space; the thud
is banging the head against it; the thud is the screech from the other
side; it veers wildly; i place myself in a certain position; i don't care;
i gather around me as best i can; azure; one or another means of
inscribing; what's left that comes out through the keys; what appears
modified and reworked on the screen; what changes through the speakers;
what combines through the vcr; the camera's greedy; it hunts outside; it
starts and stops with a thud; something holds it together; i'm held by
something; sutures or wires; i can write; so far they let me; it's that

(essay on sex.mywork for an offline magazine.)



k14% sex.mywork


k16% sex
ksh: sex: not found

k17% i'm not saying that sex is a foundation, originary impulse; only that
it retro-projects into the fantasm of an originary state. sex is neither 
an irruption or disturbance within enlightenment contractuality - nor is 
it intimate with violence, with pleasure, with desire.

in spite of aphanisis, its domain engorges, its symbols topple, it topples 
symbols. it pervades appearance as perception peels layer after layer of 
clothing, culture, speech, away from bodies turning supine.

it curls around the image. it filters through programs and protocols. our 
names are lost; we are always among the missing. the greater our passions, 
our arousals, the less our signifiers remain; we flow like wax into you, 
taking your impressions.

it's politics. it transforms into the rhetoric of war and the strategy of 
war. it's a game of substitutions. this is a window of displacements. 

content curls around the image in a state of arousal. it creates uneasy 
dreams. it may be portrayed as the game of bodies: give yours, take ours. 
it's the beginning of transitivity: we will devour you, you will devour 
us. and the beginning of an inverse economy in which value is devalued in 
breathlessness.

sex uncurls the body; eventually everything is proffered, di/s/played, 
exposed. you are given the ontology of the image, representation portrayed 
and analyzed as function. the sexual image is oral, pre-oedipal, the 
murmur of the world, the choratic stuttering into the construct of space 
and time. 

eventually it doesn't need anything at all, neither body nor viewer,
writer nor reader. plasma curls the image, the page, the computer, flesh
and its offerings. neither is it transcendent; it remains caught in the
throat; the throat surrounds it; the throat is distended; nothing
breathes, nothing speaks.

k3% work
ksh: work: not found

k4% everything turns to liquid; everything flows, cauterizes. the corro-
sive effect on the basin is to gnaw through to emptiness. within the aegis
of gravity, gravitas, it can flood through all pronouncement. it draws you
in. sex curls the screen, turns hard drives into replete translations, 
fills hard drives with catalysts of the imaginary, turns our images into 
part-objects, spreads us across your magnetic domains, your optical 
domains, your fiber optics, your twisted copper wires. nothing touches 
anything; the drives are sealed, abjection without. 

"what we have is our presence in the cosmos; we can feel the weight of our 
arms, legs, breasts, the heaviness of our head turned to one side or 
another, the explosive gasp of air (surfacing), the violent inhalation 
(going down once again). we are thrown into the flesh of other's; we claw 
through it back to our original face." (banon)

our original face is never ours alone.

our original face is always elsewhere, always others. we are blind beneath 
the surface; we carry atmosphere with us, refusing union. union alone 
extricates the flesh from the flesh. our original face is flesh.

in "our" work, we work the original face. we play against technology, 
memory, direct and indirect addressing. we participate in the irruptive 
economy of desire, arousal, trembling.

the body shimmers in repetition: stutters / shudders / shivers / shatters 
/ spatters / smatters / clatters / clutters. repetition is always inexact; 
the noise of the other, chthonic domain, is always in emergence. in "our" 
work, this trembling scatters; objects return to part-objects without 
memory of the w/hole. the images / videos / texts exist on the lip.

the lip is the guard and guardian of the other. the lip, labia, is the 
other's entrance. the lip is the emergence of the word. it is all of the 
word of the lip; the world is tongued.

the face is nub; the tongue, nub of the nub. the material of the world is 
a matter of pressure; substance is the same against the same; the nub is 
the lip or edge of differentiation, difference. what emerges from the nub 
re-enters the nub; what the nub differentiates, returns to the same.

the representation of sex in "our" work is as explicit as possible. it is 
as delineated as possible. it withdraws from the medical into the fantasm, 
withdraws from the anatomical into the anatomical. it wavers among 
anatomies.

it is as if the presentation were itself a text or inscription of sex, as
if all sex, all culture, were inscriptive, were process. but the same
presentation collapses; the inscription is within self-erasure, self-
disclosure; the sex were chemical, full-on, the catalyst of incandescent
arousal. (as if to imagine us whispering in your ear; as if to imagine
this is for you, and you alone; as if to imagine you have us in our
fullness, the scent, touch, and taste of it; as if we were your pocket
imaginary; as if we were your imaginary process and procedure, protocol
and program; as if we were your imaginary corporation. our body becomes
your own; it is unbecoming, wayward, contrary, sassy; it speaks words that
should not be spoken, gives away secrets that should be kept hidden. it
remains parenthetical; it overturns content, inverts, as our holes are
inverted, as our mouths inhale the remnants of language: as if we, as if
you, were parenthetical; as if parentheses were contradictory, unstable,
destabilizing, naked, reversing at high speed: )()()()()()()( in a
simulacrum of that repetition from your interior that raises the alarm.)(

it is not the reduction of 0*S nor the splayed inversion S/0 but that
signal or warning of loss 1^S in a process of absorption, a false S of sex
and the subject, sex and the city contract. it is not the diminution of
0+S, nor the reaffirmation of S^1. it is not the symbol nor symbolism, nor 
the symbolic nor the semiotic; it is the semiosis of the subject absorbed 
by the trembling of the parenthetical, holding at bay, beyond the Pale, 
what is most feared, that of indiscriminate fucking, desire penetrating 
beyond the criminality of the family, terrorisms and explosions at the 
heart of the continent, produced by continentals, for continentals, that 
theater of the real which is always and simultaneously contained and 
uncontained. 

that which is always a loss and a gain, a matrix and lost terms.

of the considerate


consider just for the moment, for the play of words; as if this were
written in linux, i'd go back already and change everything in the world

this isn't a poem, literature; this is a request; consider just for a
moment, for the play of the moment, the benefits of mass destruction

elimination of every man, woman, child, on the face of the planet

stranded astronauts

even miners going beneath within; the violent disease-bearing clouds of
radiation flooding; consider this, the benefits for all of us - the end of
all information and media; yes, now we can theorize endlessly about this

there are vast curtains in the sky, they are slowly closing

in one or several centuries, in millennia, things growing, clawing back,
like it was, nearly like it was

almost a model of how it had been, but something not there, something on
the order of furious perception

nothing, perhaps a rock or stick or stone; nothing, perhaps sand or mud or 
bark; nothing, perhaps a vine or clay or branch

health upwells from the submerged womb of the planet; almost health; now
we can theorize endlessly; then, we shall be silent; then, we shall
declare nothing; then, neither relative nor absolute, neither defined nor
erased, neither subject nor object

not even the tiniest name; but a glance, a knowledge of determination; 
among friends now

consider just for a moment no human alive; ideology, pollution under 
erasure; value always already the result of a past posterior of 
absolutely no account; there are no ruins; an enormous planet; sunrise 
sunset; lunar phases; storms of infinite night and day; comets close to 
the presence of sound; storms

we may sleep tonight in comfort recognizing the curtains; they close from 
above; they close from side to side

we may sleep dreamless, just for once, just this very night

before the stage recedes, from the presence and gathering of the world

five images

three of azure, shaved genitals, on a couch, facing the camera, her legs
open, right hand resting on her stomach, left hand on the edge of her left
leg, her head looking to her left; a double or shifting of her torso is
visible lower left; all images identical except for a darkening along the
x and y axes, an origin just below her navel; the coloration red, black,
red-black;; two images, heavily blurred, the second granulated as well, a
small low house against tree and nighttime sky, illuminated by a single
streetlamp; titles in order:

"she is watching her. i am watching her."
"she thinks subject. she watches her thinking."
"not both a and b. neither a nor b."
"she speaks to herself. the primal scene."
"home and she hears her voice and thoughts."

five images

morph of similar image as the first, above, to an image of alan in similar 
pose, in flash; translated in addition to five images of cracks, peeling/ 
exploding skin, untitled; flash/flesh.

commentary

the skin explodes, extrudes; she hears herself, i listen to her, i hear
with my eyes; her thoughts surround us; the world teeters; the home
carries the blood of the text; everything begins at home; home is where
the hearth is; the bodies are churned in the split air above the couch;  
there's no end to it; the titles carry periods as punctum-punctuation;  
you can't take your eyes off her; you can't forget him; they're born
against the sky; they're split for you; et cetera;

no-thing samadhi


you don't see the universe in a grain of sand; you see a grain of sand in
the universe. you may name the grain queen or king, prince or princess,
president or premier; you may give it a proper name, akiko, jonathan; you
accomplish nothing. you see a rug with its weaving and name a particular
loop friend or foe; you understand nothing. names are delusion; they close
around particulars; they define particulars. they close around the world
and structure it; the assume totality in the wildflower, totality in the
grain of sand. they assume the world is all that is the case; there is no
case, no world.

you don't see any-thing. you see the symbolic; you see function. the world
is defined as the sum of its parts. a part is part of the whole. the whole
may be greater than the sum of its parts. the parts can be summed. the
parts can be substituted, rearranged, created, annihilated, transformed.
the whole can be substituted, rearranged, created, annihilated, trans-
formed. the play of symbols is the play of abstract mathesis, the play of
abstract ontology. it is the play of no-thing. it is exact, and exactitude
may be at the service of inexactitude. within the chaotic domain, things
are determined; within the stochastic domain, envelopes are relatively or
roughly determined.

there is no universe in a grain of sand. there is no world in a wild-
flower. there is no grain of sand, no wild-flower. you see everything in a
universe that reflects structure in everything. structure coalesces, coag-
ulates - fields, intensifications, energies, fundamental forces. in the
grain of sand, structure devolves. on the way down, structure devolves.
your body is devolution; your body is coagulation, intensity; your mind,
your antibodies, the raising of your arms, ward off boundary dissolution.
appearance nearly decomposes; the boundaries are of a making. the boundar-
ies are of a dissolution. there is no cessation; there is transformation;
there is asymptotic devolvement. the constriction-coagulation, the cont-
ract of names, is always already forgotten. there is no-thing to forget.
there is no-thing to remember; the universe is neither imaginary nor real.

hatred diary of absence, sort of


on the far side of holderlin i already sense my madness. on the left side
of artaud i'm ready to welcome my murder. beneath chatterton the clever
boy i beg you to kill me. azure and i speak to no one, go further into
debt, i can't get out of here, i can't get the vowels right. without
vowels there are only consonents, bought and sold in florida. there are
plans to kill all the manatees, those that haven't died already from
propeller wounds. my writing unsolicited, goes unsolicitied. listen: i
just wrote a samadhi piece that was a breakthrough for me. one cute
comment in return. listen:  i wrote about the death of all humans.
silence. listen: i wrote a text explaining my sexual/terror/language/
theory issues. one back-channel. listen: i write in silence. i write
still-born. i write misscarriage. listen: i burrow into content like a
monster devouring all sentient beings. listen: i am that monster. i am
that monster devouring all sentient beings; i can taste my madness, my
death to come, my death on my right shoulder and my left shoulder, my
death grappling already with my teeth, breaking them down at the roots,
screaming into the nerve. azure and i spend weekends alone. we spend days
alone except for students. listen to my students: bin laden is a faggot;  
miami's run by spics; feminists are man-haters; we should have expected
911 because we kill the unborn; everyone's online listen to me: my
university courses are a fraud; we're not even online; my students hate me
or are confused by me; nothing can be done with suburban kids; they know
nothing can be done with me. listen to my department: i'm too negative; i
seem too depressed in class; i complain too much. listen to the work:
there are 4-5 who are actually doing something; i'm sorry for them. azure
and i wait for phone calls: a few relatives from out of state, maybe twice
a week. azure and i wait for mail, maybe once a week. i will kill every
living creature. i will inhale anthrax; please send to alan sondheim, 4600
sw 67 ave, mi fl 33155, please include instructions. seal tightly against
the manatees. remember to include the vowels; language bothers me.

The Ineffable Brought Back Below


Simplices are generated in n-dimensional geometry by connecting the n-1
simplex to a point in the nth dimension (i.e. not co-n-1 with it). Begin
with a point, then a line segment, triangle, tetrahedron, etc. For dim 0
and 1, the total number of elements are respectively 1 and 3. This is also
true for the measure polytope, point, line segment, square, cube, etc.  
The latter is formed by sliding the entire n-1 measure polytope along an
orthogonal n-flat. The total number of elements in a simplex is 2^(n+1)-1
which may be seen inductively; given an n-dimension simplex, the slide to
n+1 creates 2(2^(n+1)-1)+1 elements - doubling through the 'smear,' the
last 1 for the given point drawing the rest out, almost skein-like. This
reduces to 2^(n+2)-2+1 = 2^(n+2)-1 elements for the n+1 simplex, i.e.
2^((n+1)+1)-1. Something also about binomial coefficients. For a measure
polytope, the total elements are 3^n; this can also be shown inductively.
For dim 0, the point, 3^0= 1 and 2^1-1 = 1; for dim 1, 3^1 = 3 and 2^2-1 =
3; dim 0 and dim 1 may be considered a phenomenological basis for these
generations, identical for simplex and measure polytope. Note these two
forms carry upward through the n-dimensional polytopes; this isn't true of
the other platonic solids. Now consider n = -1; then the simplex is 2^0-1
= 0; this is the ineffable point, without elements or substance. The sim-
plex below or beneath the series disappears, or might as well disappear.
Elements and elementals.

This is the ineffable point; we may read Derrida as subaltern extension:

"(50) Calculability: question, apparently arithmetic, of two, or rather of
n + One, through and beyond the demography of which we spoke above. Why
should there always have to be _more than_ one source? There would not
have to be two sources of religion. There would be faith and religion,
faith or religion, because _there are at least two._ Because there are,
for the best and for the worst, division and iterability of the source.  
This supplement introduces the incalculable at the heart of the calcula-
ble. (Levinas: 'It is this being-two _<etre a deux>_ that is human, that
is spiritual.') But the more than One _<plus d'Un>_ is at once more than
two.  There is no alliance of two, unless it is to signify in effect the
pure madness of pure faith. The worst violence. The more than One is this
n + One which introduces the order of faith or of trust in the address of
the other, but also the mechanical, machine-like division (testimonial
affirmation and reactivity, 'yes, yes', etc., answering machine and the
possibility of _radical evil:_ perjury, lies, remote-control murder,
ordered at a distance even when it rapes and kills with bare hands."
("Faith and Knowledge," in Derrida and Vattimo, Religion, trans. Weber.)

It is Pythagorean in the sense of an empathetic harmony between number, 
numeracy, and the real, drawn out into neoplatonisms. It is desire 
manifest in an absolute that drops out at the bottom of the scale; in a 
very inert sense, nothing is below zero, neither negative nor imaginary, 
neither fraction nor transcendental, neither inaccessibly high finite, nor 
infinite. It stops there, as the nub or apex, the world under erasure, the 
world not yet declared.

And it is a false derivation; a false transmission precisely within and by 
virtue of the scriptures, and the violence is there.

It's the curlicue, the diacritical mark, to the effect that 0' -> 1, tends
towards one; there is always a unique successor among the integers. One 
you start, there's no stopping; one an axiomatic system is laid out as in 
Euclid, or parameters declared, everything follows. Everything, but not 
necessarily _that_ One, which requires an extra effort, although it was 
always there by the self-performative of its own beginning; it's curious.

911: phenomenology, premonition


Derrida, Faith and Knowledge, 1994, p 24 -


Like others before, the new 'wars of religion' are unleashed over the
human earth (which is not the world) and struggle even today to control
the sky _with finger and eye_: digital systems and virtually immediate
panoptical visualization, 'air space', telecommunications satellites,
information highways, concentration of capitalistic-mediatic power - in
three words, _digital culture, jet_ and _TV_ without which there could be
no religious manifestation today, for example no voyage or discourse of
the Pope, no organized emanation _<rayonnement>_ of Jewish, Christian, or
Muslim cults, whether 'fundamentalist' or not.

What the Engine Does, of the Anorectic Airliner

The Engine swallows the air; it is the point at which the movement of air
and its dispersion begins. This is an act of devouring, gorging, the
bulimic cycle which collapses as the world is absorbed. It is a
transformation into substance as the Engine appropriates the foundations
of the signifier for itself. What an appropriation! The Engine inscribes
the absorbed world in an exhaust trail. The Engine parallels the photon;  
it refuses position as the tokenization of existence; it exists as
movement and collapse. Thus it flies and desires the air. Thus it
appropriates and seduces the air, through an act of violence which retains
its position of flight. For that which would escape it, Engine, cruise
missile, bomb, what is being said but the "I" of the engine, within a
dialectic of seduction?  Seduction in which the Origin is proclaimed, and
that is the metric established as Origin, the location of the phallus. The
cruise missile cocks its head, gives it to the world. It is semen which is
disorganized;  the world burns into paste through an atmosphere of paste,
through an Engine of paste. The world burns, the Engine burns, swells,
disgorges; it is the world returned to vomit.The anorectic airliner
shudders (therefore shudders); the line of flight is re-established. Such
an establishment with markings in the sky! Such a sky that establishes
itself as a graph with mobile coordinates, exhaust that indicates while it
dissipates, is absorbed in the clutter of the air. The tiny Engine! The
presence of Flight! The erection in the sky and the charred earth! It is
the appearance of the microtechnological once again, the bacteriophage
with its consonant and identical units. It is an empty circle. It is the
exhaustion of repetitive expansion.

there is not enough time but there is no time for the will or contract
there is no one to leave to
there is no memory
nothing is of account and nothing will be accounted for
there is no emptiness in massive death
the world will return to substance
fires continue to burn beneath the world trade center
we do not recognize ourselves in ash yah yah
our skin already begins to fall
our breath is shorter
all we have left to do is recognize this fundamental truth
we are close to extinction
