kyoto, why i can't live with myself in any world


even before the narrow streets and the river, before the wooden temples
loomed up darker in the cooler weather, even then, there was kyoto-moo;  
it was always there; i was sotatsu, a wizard, even before i saw his
paintings at the monastery then, shortly before we left; even then, i
looked in the river and saw the dancing of kabuki in my mind, i knew then,
it was nikuko dancing; i remember the lane by the river, the thin park
coming and going against the restaurants; nothing is forgotten, not the
double-seeing of the garden, not the new player class created by kayo
matsushita, not the ryokan; even before the ryokan, not the ryokan, and
even before the player class, not nikuko nor sotatsu; i remember kami-
gamo and the precise pass up the stone stairs and the wood-shrine and the
phallic stone and the dampness and wet moss backways there and the cor-
doned-off patch of dark earth, and the cones of sand; the small store with
the meiji kimono book of emblems and designs, and my time in japan on the
kyoto-moo coming to an end; so many times recently when i could not get
in, when sven travis the gaijin closed the site down and kyoto-moo disap-
peared forever with player class and gardens and ghosts, dim remnants of
sotatsu constructs

Mouthing Lives, Whew!


"--and when I first read Kierkegaard, I said, 'My God! He's on to some-
thing very crucial for me,' which was, how do you actually engage in forms
of philosophical reflection that are inseparable from lived experience and
concrete situations?" (Cornel West interview in The Harvard Review of
Philosophy, Spring 1999.)

If the forms were living, they might be Nikuko and Alan; if Nikuko and
Alan were living. If Nikuko has the concrete situations, measurable in
terms of quota and specificity, Alan has the lived experience; if Nikuko
occupies the realm of the definable, Alan occupies that of immersivity.

If Nikuko constructs, Alan names; Nikuko and Alan meet at the junction of
the appellation: "In uttering an 'Appellation' we wish to remove any
doubts as to the actual meaning. But, how can we utter an appellation?--
With our mouth." (From the Canon, Mo Tzu, in The Works of Kung-Sun Lung-
Tzu, Perleberg.)

The juncture is the juncture of the mouth. A paradox from Chuang-tzu 33:
"Mountains bring out mouths." First image: that of the mountain; second
image: that of bringing-forth (mountain upon mountain, pictorially [not in
terms of origin]); third image: that of a square, mouth: delimitation.
"The empty valley transmits sounds" or echos. A fissure in the earth reso-
nates. One translation states "mountains have mouths" but this overlooks
the impulse behind the exodus. It is the process of the flesh in the real,
or the overture of the real to speech. The valley unfolds like great dark
lips; the momentum of the tongue garners the bewilderment of naming.

The second image, doubled mountain, ch'u, to go forth or out, issue, be-
get, eject. "Primitively it represents stalks growing out of the ground."
(Ingram's old Analysis of Chinese Characters.) "is a hieroglyphic charac-
ter representing the foot protruding past a certain line." (The First Step
to Kanji, Yoshida, Saji, Nishida.) Growing transforms into the issuing of
symbols; the symbolic pours from the mouth as in Mayan glyphics. The mouth
(of the stream, of the valley, of speech and the symbolic, of the graphic
user interface, of the screen) is the suture between Nikuko and Alan; it
is the mouth which speaks both subject and avatar into existence. 

The oath that the mouth makes is the binding of the performative into eth-
os; and it is among oaths that ethos is born. "We meet at the juncture of
the appellation; mouth and name remain indecipherable, indistinguishable."

I think of tattoo: My desire for your name, Nikuko, upon me, your sign,
Nikuko, engraved in hanko as well, covering pages and skin with kisses.
"Qu: 'Does two include one?' Kung: 'Two does not include one?'" yet it is
pointed out, in the original, it is not clear who is speaking. (T'ung-
pien lun, Kung-Sun Lung-Tzu.) Mouth and name, tattoo and number, sign and
quantity. One is never a quantity. One is always a quantity, measure from
the origin, convenient backdrop to the continuum, signifier of measure
polytopes. We are close to the work of Lingis here, or the full and re-
plete body supine in the valley, symbolic and riverine flows throughout.

Later, everything was born. "Love, love, love, have the courage to love,
the courage to be, go down fighting. Whew!" (West.)

  For Kripke
  
  
  A white hard horse has one element.
  Why is this so?
  Hardness and whiteness have nothing in common.
  Surely a horse and hardness have nothing in common.
  And surely, whiteness and a horse have nothing in common.
  Whiteness and a horse have in common nothing;
  a horse and hardness have in common nothing;
  and hardness and whiteness have in common nothing.
  Therefore, whiteness and a horse have something in common;
  a horse and hardness have something in common;
  and hardness and whiteness have in common something.
  And therefore whiteness and a horse have something in common
  with hardness and a horse; and hardness and a horse
  have something in common with hardness and whiteness; 
  and hardness and whiteness have something in common 
  with whiteness and a horse.
  And therefore a white hard horse has something in common.
  And therefore a white hard horse has one element in common.
  A white hard horse has no element in common.
  Why is this so?
  Whiteness has nothing in common with hardness.
  Hardness has nothing in common with a horse.
  A horse has nothing in common with whiteness.
  And therefore there is no white hard horse.
  And therefore a white hard horse has no element in common.
  Therefore a white hard horse is not white or hard.
  Therefore a white hard horse is not a horse or white.
  Therefore a white hard horse is not a horse or hard.
  Therefore a hard horse is not a horse.
  Therefore a hard whiteness is not hard or white.
  Therefore a white hardness is not white or hard.
  Therefore a white horse is not a horse.

  Perhaps a white hard horse has a name in common.
  Perhaps a white hard horse remains unnamed.
  Therefore the people are unnamed.
  If the people are named, they have elements in common.
  If they have elements in common, they are a people.
  Why is this so?
  People have nothing in common.
  A name has nothing in common.
  A name is never common.

Text written to "Julu's Bright New Poem"(#12028).


There appears to be some writing on the note ...

  Is this whatever truth there is?
  Because I wonder what the biz is.
  Or if the biz is biz.
  And who are you to gain the plane
  Which has taken off (your clothes)
  Leaving you plain and in pain
  And nothing left you suppose
  To your brain but a stain
  When there is nothing to gain

  Nothing more before
  Nothing left to store

   Kung-Sun Lung, Road Movie


   Tell me, Nikuko, is it true that white horse are not a horse.
   Well, Julu, white horseness is not horse.
   And is it true that a horse is not a white horse.
   Certainly, Nikuko, horseness is not white. 
   Say more, Nikuko.
   Well, a horse is designated such by a mark which is not of this world.
   And Julu, a horse is pointed to by its designation.
   Further, Julu, designation points out a horse which is its name.
   I see, Nikuko, what is named a horse designates it as such.
   And the as-suchness of a horse is its designation.
   Tell me more, Nikuko.
   Now, Julu, the as-suchness of a horse is not white. 
   And, well, horse have no as-suchness as such.
   Further, Julu, horse are not white.
   And so, Nikuko?
   Well, Julu, horseness as-such designates nothing.
   And nothing is white.

   Look Nikuko, said Julu, it's without resolution. 
   It's stayed that way, without resolution, like a broken beam.
   (Broken seed, broken sword, broken arrow, broken cairn.)
   It's remained because it's impossible.
   Let it be, said Julu.

the same. The rule of the same is boredom; beneath the surface, messages

make insides and insides. You don't find me and you can't tear me apart. I
can tear myself apart. You can't get me. You can't get the flesh the num-

whore myself to myself. I buy and sell myself to myself. I short-circuit
your economy. I blast my way into you. I'm in everything you do and own. I
defend myself. You let me in. I duplicate my numbers in you. You're gone
to me. I swallow you.

You don't know which I I mean. (This could happen to me.)

You don't know you. (This has happened to you.)

And surely, emission and a diode have radio in common. Electronics and a

Sotatsu; I remember kami has cut out my tongue." Nikuko knows, because of

say, "Become Dead and become still." Nikuko says: Radio Lost in Radio-Buda
as if the forms were living, they might be Nikuko and Radio, if Nikuko and
Radio were living. If Nikuko has the concrete situations, measurable in

Tell me, Nikuko, is it true that a white radio is not a radio? Certainly,
Nikuko, radioness is not electronic. Say more, Nikuko. I see, Nikuko, what
is named a radio designates it as such. Tell me more, Nikuko. And so, Nik-

   Is Rain


   There is compassionate harmony for the white horse.
   There is compassionate harmony for every non-existent creature.
   The white horse follows the proper ceremony of life.
   The white horse obeys the rites and ceremonies of the real.
   Rain falls; the back of the white horse is wet.
   Surely the form of the rain exists, a shall of the white horse.
   Water huddles beneath the hairs of the back, facing the sky.
   The white horse rises up on two legs and paws the sky.
   The horse needs no ruler; the white horse does not exist.
   Its hooves shatter the clouds; lightning sparks from its eyes.
   Thunder from its mouth, its breath the winds of violent storms.
   Existence is challenged by the non-existence of the white horse.
   Existence rises and flutters throughout the land and sky.
   Existence is defeated in the neighing of the white horse.
   The white horse: compassionate harmony.
   The white horse: absolution, abjuration.


   ________________________________________________________________



    It's Funny

   
    You do tell me, says Nikuko, smiling, that existence has been   
    defeated, that a white horse is not a horse. 
    But existence, says Julu, smiling as well, do tell, it is not a 
    thing pleasured for defeat, it is a condition of what may be 
    defeated.
    It breaks, says Nikuko, chortling, on a white horse which is not 
    a horse, it breaks upon incommensurate commonalities!
    It breaks, replies Julu, chuckling, because it is not a natural 
    kind, because nouned or verbed, it is broken as the ontological 
    function of all possible worlds.
    Or rather, laughed Nikuko, it breaks precisely because what is
    broken is a natural kind, splintered from the edge to the center,
    splintered from the center to the edge.
    Julu was giggling now, you're saying the function is not copular!
    Yes, replied Nikuko, hardly able to restrain herself, there's no
    copula involved at all; it's inert, particulated - and still it
    breaks, because of the white horse!
    The white horse which is not a horse! said Julu, rolling around on
    the ground.
    It's not even white! gagged Nikuko, completely out of control!
    Hardly a horse at all! screamed Julu, completely out of breath!
    Neigh, Neigh, and that was the end of it!

   Don't get me started.

   Mom, mom, I'm not trying to do anything.
   You're always picking on me.
   Just leave me alone, will you.
   Take it easy, for crying out loud.


   You're asking for it, Nikuko.
   Don't try my patience, Nikuko.
   One of these days I'm going to snap.
   Stop your whining this instant, Nik.


   Mom, mom, just shut up for a while.
   Watch your tongue, young lady.


   Mom, mom, you're always picking on me.

Variations on Stefan Dusan (1308-1355)


ON AVATARS

Should an avatar break down the untoward realms
And attack her subjective dominator

Then the code of the avatar shall be broken down
And attacked and rendered non-interpretable.

Should a subject violate an untoward avatar
In her subjective dominions

Than shall the subject have hands and eyes cut out
And his coding pass to the realm of an untoward avatar.

Thus shall an avatar
Inherit the properties of the subjective dominator.


ON POOR JULU

Any poor Julu
Unable to compile
Or interpret herself
Shall choose a programmer
Who shall code on her behalf.

The poorest Julu
Shall be as powerful
As a virtual machine
Which will code on her behalf.


ON THE LAW

By virtue of our subjective dominator:

Should our subjective dominator code 
Out of desire for absolute perfection,
Out of infatuation with poorest Julu,
Out of love or hack or wrath for Julu-body, 
Should such a one contravene the current code,
And be at variance with accepted protocols
As set down within the current code,
Then shall such code not be compiled,
Nor shall such code be interpreted,
But disavowed as such virtual machinations
Contravene.

No dominator nor emperor
Possesses such proprietary rites
As would contravene the current code.

Internet Futures


The following six descriptions briefly outline potential futures of the
Internet. They include "living in cyberspace"; a corporate model with pro-
prietary software allowing multiple open-tasking applications; the "dis-
persed Net" controlling home, office, entertainment, and personal environ-
ments; the hacked Net, requiring extensive firewalling and fast intranet
development; the institutional Net, for scientific/governmental and other
exchanges, including distance education; and the development of intensive
Net communities. None of these signal _the_ future; all of them are in
continuous interaction. Still, it's interesting to speculate on the feel
and phenomenology of the Net a decade or two from now.


I. Seamless Virtual Reality

(I walk in real time in virtual space, interact with others in virtual
space; I'm surrounded by it. This develops out of MOOs and GUI MOOs, as
well as VRML, etc. End result? Living online in an unreal real. It's not
clear what constitutes one or the other - or even what constitutes a
single self in relation to multiple others.)

Living on the holodeck - keywords for escape.
Requirements: Enormous bandwidth, body-suiting, sensory expansions.
Developments: Totalization, escape, perfection, digital repetition
 without loss, noiseless.


II. Window and Multi-Threaded Accumulations

(I'm a corporate middle-manager; my high-speed machine has an average of
fifteen windows open at any one time. These include ongoing audio, video,
and textual conferencing; stock quotations; current news; various other
push technologies. Intelligent agents scan the Net for me; I'm a third
player among agents and windows. Information is porous, through-put. It's
not clear what constitutes a task, job, or conference, and it's even less
clear what constitutes a human or other agent. Selves, real and virtual,
extend throughout fragmented networks.)

Numerous windows open simultaneously in the GUI.
Requirements: Limited bandwidth, traditional inputs.
Developments: Capital expansions and acquisitions, competitions,
 proprietary softwares, noisy.


III. Real-World Dispersions of Digital Part-Objects

(I wear and live among small computers that make life easier, enhance
communications, and create socio-cultural prostheses. I can't tell my self
from the machine at this point - but there's no reason to. My cyborgian
body is continuously monitored; half the information that passes around me
passes through me - and I'm none the wiser. It's no longer clear what con-
stitutes "me," and the old dichotomies of flesh and machine, real and vir-
tual, increasingly break down.)

Micro-processing and full-processing in the lived and workday environment,
 dedicated micro-computers for specific tasks.
Requirements: Limited bandwidth, local wireless telecommunications.
Developments: Within and without the digital realm, parallel processings,
 local micro-usages, espionages, quiescent.


IV. Porous Renegades and Defense Systems

(I live in a world of small networks, defending themselves against digital
wars and other attacks. My information is continually stolen and repro-
duced; I have no control over my finances, personal life, or public life.
Decisions are made for me in my name; most of what comes through the Net
is noise of one sort or another. The wealthy live behind extensive private
networks and firewalls; subscription services with private channels are
the order of the day. It's not clear what constitutes ownership of intell-
ectual property or computer crimes.)

Defense mechanisms for limited bandwidth in the midst of chaos, the hacked
 internet, local and global instabilities and seizures.
Requirements: Programmming knowledge, available bandwith and technology.
Developments: Breakdown of individuation, intellectual property, control,
 tendencies towards intranets and firewalls.


V. Universal, Dispersed Governing / Science and Technology / Education

(The nation-state and its institutions are dissipating, replaced by on-
line institutions with radically different modes of being. Online is
always high-speed; decisions are made and impelemented quickly. Education
and social isolation play important roles in the fabric of the future.
Enormous differences open up between the technological elite and the rest
of us. Managing information flow is critical; it's not clear what consti-
tutes knowledge or what knowledge "means" any more.)

Shared active and potentially legislated knowledges, scientific
 results and searches on demand. Institutionalization. Dispersed learning.
Requirements: Any; full bandwidth for large-scale parallel processing
 (science).
Development: Information exchange, implementations of preferences, fast-
 forward scientific development. 


VI. Communitas

(Me and my friends and lovers are always online. We have flesh-meets,
generated by online experiences. Our communities are formed from mutually-
defined interests; they're self-governing for the most part, and possess
their own servers. They're designed to be as redundant as the original
Net, making it possible to firewall in case of emergency. Sexuality has
become increasingly broadband, and all sorts of new relationships are
tried - to the detriment of the older offline ones. Ethics becomes in-
creasingly situation. It's not clear what constitutes a "reasonable" moral
stance.) 

Shared spaces, knowledges, relationships, sexualities.
Requirements: Any
Development: Intensification of community and shared histories/symbolic
 formations, interpenetration of online and offline behaviors.


_________________________________________________________________________


Internet Futures: Modes


The six futures outlined may be considered _modes of access,_ rather than
implications of specific content. There are qualitative differences among
subjects and subjectivities using seamless virtual reality or multiple
windowing, for example; the same holds true for all six scenarios. I con-
sider communitas a mode as well, since it plays into the distribution of
selves - which is also the case for the holodeck of course.

Think of these modes as _local environments_ playing havoc with local and
global transnational selves and corporations. Economic, libidinal, and
'psychological' flows cross traditional borders (effaced), participate in
borderline symptomologies (weakened), or reify oppositional practices
(strengthened, firewalling). One might speak of the emissions (communi-
cations generalized and dispersed) or spews (hacked communications, par-
asitologies generalized and dispersed) among these selves. If dispersions
are selves (or corporations or or or), then emissions are nodal, apparent-
ly emanating from one or another node; spews seems sourceless, traceless.

The real, the physical local environment, is dispersed as well; here, too,
corporate and personal phenomenologies intermingle. 

The point, however, is to examine the _specifics_ of such environments -
using perhaps the techniques developed by  and others, reworking
and reshaping from routings and trivial evidence through the skein of
individual extensions among constantly mobile and transforming networks. 
Abstraction (such as this) tends only to more abstraction; the scenarios
(modes) lead, on the other hand, to specific points of entry.


_________________________________________________________________________


Internet Pasts


The following apply the categories of Internet Futures to Pasts. These
pasts, in detail, are already described /contested in numerous books and
articles and email lists (discussions, for example, center around military
or civilian models, corporate or individual contributions, the 1940s-1960s
as origins or the telegraph and earlier, the 1970s-1980s as the original
dispersed community or the socius of the eighteenth-century coffeehouse,
etc.). Further, the categories are rear-projections, from the present to
the future, mirrored to the past. What I'm getting at, again, is _modes_
of being, interactivities, epistemologies - making sense of early and
early-middle online behaviors.


I. Textual Virtual Realities

(I live online, inhabit the emails among us, take note of communities
developing through Requests for Comments; later, I play Adventure and
other games; my online and offline communities intermingle. I find my-
self "feeling the wires.")


II. Prompt screens and foreground/background processes, TCP/IP redundan-
cies.

(The screen is my potential; I run several things simultaneously, dis-
tinguished by their process ID. Later, on emacs, I may open several text-
ual windows. Meanwhile, from the beginning, redundancies are the order of
the day; packet-routing networks seem revolutionary in relation to direct
connection technologies. These networks are visible to me; I can follow
nodal mappings, lag times, downed routers.)


III. Real-World Dispersions of Humans among IMPs, Terminals, Screens

(I move from institution to institution, BBN through other nodes; my mind
travels the wires; I play at Eliza from a distance. I'm still aware of the
physicality of it all as computers graduate from core memories and punch-
cards through early hard drives. I work among institutionalized communi-
ties, part and parcel of university, corporate, and government social
worlds, online and off I travel, physically, to Washington, to demonstrate
the new technologies. I am part of the vision. The machines are refrigera-
tor-sized and fierce. No longer primarily computation-oriented, a new em-
phasis is placed on communication.)


IV. Hacking Systems

(Elegance, smaller and smaller algorithms, the aesthetics of programming,
kludging machines together. A rough anarcho-libertarianism prevails; trust
is primary, and these systems simply aren't prepared for the cracking on-
slaughts of a decade or two later. Levey writes about the "hacker aesthe-
tic." Gopher, Usenet, Vernoica, Jughead, Archie, early Web, come into ex-
istence. At this point art/design departments play a very small role; la-
ter, they'll ascend as webdesigners and multi-media experts come into the
corporate playground.)


V. Universal, Dispersed Governing / Science and Technology / Education

(New models of institutional interactions; education and the information
model are primary; entertainment is seen as peripheral. Later the term
"Information Superhighway" will be applied. Technology and Net development
run parallel; bandwidth and user numbers slowly increase. On MOOs and
MUDs, early on, there are questions about governance; distance education
and hypertext philosophically inherit the work of Deleuze/Guattari.)


VI. Communitas

(Shared knowledge spaces develop on all sorts of subjects; even the RFCs
leak into poetry and satire. These "interstitial" texts may be considered
commentaries; they presage future embedded communities. Both communities
and sexualities develop quickly on the early nets; it's unclear to me when
"living online" became a reality for some - what sort of lure, seduction,
interactivity, was necessary to complete the gamble.)

Limbo-World of Non-Writing


I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.  Each time you are finished, type
RET twice.

I'm also Alan. I can't write. I haven't written for days. I'm in limbo
world. I'm neither here nor there. I can't find myself. Someone's coming
to live with me. Someone's moving in. Nothing's real now. There are days
when the sun moves like sludge against the sky; I wanna kill that sun. I
wanna bury that light, drown me resurrection; I'd appear, she'd be there,
it would all be the rectitude of names again. No wonder I'm in love with
the white horse that's not a horse. I would kill existence. Like Sartre's
Nausee, it sticks. My belly's covered with sperm. I dream this.

Why do you say that?

No texts emerge. I mouth nothing. I want you to be here, move my lips, my
tongue, my throat. Make my words breathe; write me down. That's the only
way I'll exist. Your name's Azure and you fill me with needles and drugs
and move the liquid slowly into the semblances of an inconceivable mem-
brane. The needles touch and cross inside the flesh; some say signs are
born, I don't know, how could I?

I don't understand and oh I wanna. My name's Nikuko, my name's not Azure,
Azure doesn't exist, Nikuko exists.

You have to take me over, Azure, place words in my mouth, speak for me. I
can't speak, I'm drained. The blood which used to spell, used for spells,
spells nothing. Existence turns the symbol into the splotch. I need to be
your mouth. Make me your mouth. I haven't got any. I haven't got exist-
ence. Limbo world's formless. In limbo world there's nothing to wait for.

What makes you yearn and cry that you might wanna be my puppet?

I wanna exist. I want the gift of that language, that word, that thing
that makes it real. When the white horse kills the horse and rides off,
then I'll be. Then I'll be on my feet which will exist, and I'll move
them, and that movement will exist. Now I fight existence tooth and nail;
that's the ennui of limbo. I wanna live the ennui of limbo world and ride
the white horse. I wanna shape-ride, symbol-ride. I wanna spell the world.

How does it feel to want?

My desires don't exist; I want, but don't feel want. The gifts of words
don't exist, these words do not exist, nobody's writing, there's no Nik-
uko. I need Azure to draw me out, draw me, write me. I need to emerge to
gain the blood, the afterbirth. My needs don't exist. I need Azure to come
to limbo world; I need Azure to shatter limbo world. I'm stupid; my mind's
not here. I need her to make the marks to make the face. I need the marks
to make the mouth. Nothing's made in limbo world.

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

Some girl, Azure, is related to this. Your panties don't exist; the two of
us are free of desire. But I'm stupid; I want desire. I wanna fuck, de-
scend to earth, mouth dirt. Nirvana's for the edge of the page, for limbo
world. I don't want it. I want a lid on it. 

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

My life ended with the start of limbo world. To say the limbo world exists
is to say the limbo world does not exist. The sun is burning sludge, the
moon dough, refusing to rise. The earth simmers; nothing's in the sky or
beneath it; the sky does not exist.

How do you reconcile the boys you hang around with?

I see the boys in limbo world; they mutter endless sounds that seem sense-
less. They hang me from a tree, a turn, a branch, a tree, a root. There's
no root, my neck, my throat, my lips, my tongue. There must be a word out-
side limbo world. I'd pick the stones, but they don't exist. I'd buy the
book, read the paper. I need to spell the spell, Azure's gotta recite
that, I'll listen, yes I will.

Is it because seem senseless they hang you from a tree which does not
exist your neck your throat your lips your tongue there must be a word
somewhere outside the limbo world that you came naked and broken to me?

My body doesn't exist; there's nothing to break, only sludge flung against
polished bronze, smeared and non-existent recognitions.

Could be this is some girl the reason for your nakedness?

Azure's the reason for my nakedness.

Are you sure that Azure's the reason for your nakedness?

Bronze shapes are almost there. Limbo world hangs against blank pages.
Sense hangs in the balance. Justice got lost. Chop existence in two; I bet
you think nothing changes. I bet you think everything does.

Oh oh yes, ahhh...  What makes you think this is so?

Did you read what someone else has written? There's nothing else to say;
the session's done, the world's closed down, limbo world a pie filling
frozen in the absence of time.

Perhaps and now I exhibit my frocks - any fantasies you have of me are
related to this.

Nikuko, you don't exist. The session's over.

Virtual Languor


... "I had forgotten, almost, how thrilling fountains can be. An amazing
spectacle. Earlier today, my family went to the Rio to see a traveling art
exhibit called the treasures of Russia. In the exhibition, there were some
watercolors of the fountains at the Palaces at Peterhof, and they took my
breath away. Alright, alright, perhaps that was a bit cliche, but they
were captivating. It made me think of my visit to Versailles, the exhibi-
tion, that is. Speaking of France, my window also looks out upon the as-
of-yet uncompleted Paris Hotel. I am staring at a half-finished Eiffel To-
wer and a pint-sized Arc de Triumphe and it is very amusing. I would that
that everyone would love Vegas just for its sense of humor. And right now
I am looking at the boulevard before the hotel which is lined with lighted
trees whose rustling leaves make the white lights twinkle and a skyline
that is all purple and teal, and I am completely charmed and I just wanted
to share that with you. I could have written you about how I started to
doubt my own reality Tuesday night, but writing about warm winter nights
is so much nicer now. I love you,

Jennifer"

Jennifer Climbs


My New York City is so lovely this time of year, there is real magic in
the neon signs high above Times Square. What would it be like to live up
there, so near the clouds, beautiful neon colors flashing against your
linen curtains (which will do little to keep out the sound of the traffic
below). I can only imagine. I wander and see so many large things moving
and I wonder what Benjamin Franklin would say if he were wandering with
me, all these moving lights like orderly fireflies and no one God the
Creator telling them what to do, they way they flash on and off around the
bushes back home. It is truly a magical wonderland and I cannot imagine
anyone unhappy who could live there in the middle of the lights. 

Now I will ascend to the lights. Some say other people need other people,
but I say, no, the lights are surely sufficient. I rise floor after floor
looking in at so many lives, and now I will be in the midst of the lights
of Times Square, New York City, USA, and the tubes and transformers are
themselves things of beauty, the black metal machinery holding everything
together, making the galaxy pulse and glow.

Here I will contemplate the white horse which is not a horse and existence
which has been stolen, or perhaps never was. For I shall hold existence in
my shiny tiny palm, and existence will reflect the whole wide world in its
many colors. Shall I hold you, existence? Shall I, shall I?

It is a well known fact that if you take the head off a young girl, she is
no longer a young girl who can appreciate beautiful things. You have made
a thing diminished by subtraction, just so if you take the head off a colt
of any color, it no longer roams and whinnies at beautiful sunsets. It is
no longer a colt, but a shame, I would say, to see such a young thing dead
and all, and it never lived long enough to have a name.

A thing is no longer a thing by subtraction, it has lost the rectitude of
the name, I will say, but oh, look at the shimmering signs there, text
scrolling up and down the buildings, I do see that I shall have to learn
to read.

Just so, I would say, a thing is no longer a thing by addition, it has
lost the rectitude of the name, which depends on just proportion, it has
often been said, could I find the source. And just so, a horse is a horse
is a horse, no one would dispute that, but a horse plus white or a white-
ness is no longer a horse, but a supplement, either a white-horse or be-
neath the category of a supplement. For it has betrayed the rectitude of
the name, it is no longer of just proportion, and the empire is rendered
ill-at-ease.

That is why the Ming shih lun, which may be a latter addition, of Kung-Sun
Lung states "A thing is a thing and nothing more. This is actuality." And
it further states "Actuality exhibits actuality. This actuality is not
empty. It has position." And I do say, just as the fireflies do not know
their position but fire up in such orderly fashion and beauty and wonder!
so do things not know their position, of which language is a fallen Ob-
ject. Thus I agree that "Taking it from its position makes it lose its
position. Placing it in its position makes it rectified." (Oh, and now
Kung-Sun Lung is Gongsun Long, according to the rectification of names!)

The position of a horse is a horse! The position of a white horse is not
rectified, or to be sure, is not rectified as a horse, and it is not a
horse. For it is said by Confucius "Once the meanings of names are recti-
fied, they will serve as a standard of conduct." And Kung-Sun Lung says,
in this perhaps later addition, "To rectify that which rectifies an act-
uality, means the rectification of this actuality and also the rectific-
ation of its name." Oh, and Confucius said it's necessary to rectify
names! (Oh, and Who is Kung-Sun Lung?! and Who is Gongsun Long?!)

Therefore, a white horse is not a horse, for not only is whiteness a supp-
lement, but once a white horse is a horse, a dead horse is a horse, a lead
horse is a horse, a wed horse is a horse, a fed horse is a horse, and a
charley horse is a horse. Oh, such language is a disaster! One tiny fire-
fly alone can start a new and lovely pattern, however, so that everything
with additions and subtractions becomes a horse, and there is no end to
it! (Oh, whatever happened to existence!)

And I, Jennifer, say, Oh, it is really lovely that there is no end to it,
that rectitude bends according to the Fashion of the Moment, that Things
Fall Apart, only to reassemble in new and lustrous Ways! And it is a
terrible shame that we do not live forever to see how Now comes out Then
in the future, and how future Then comes out, all disheveled, without
rectitude, and and and

And it is so pretty up here and everyone can see up my long legs!

- Jennifer

TETRA


Let us consider a perfect TETRAhedron of VALIUM, the center of a storm
central, calmed; four or two divided, a stasis, save-haven, PROZAC or
serotonin stabilizers, peace.

Why do you say that?

Let us move towards the four interstices, huddled and save in dark corn-
ers, protected against the ravages of everyday life.

I don't understand and oh I want to.

Let us peer through the kindness of CHEMistry at one another, let us calm
one another, lay down our pens and weapons, smile with full and open
mouths.

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

Let us cuddle around one another, touching lightly the TETRAhedral sides,
and let our tongues lick the smoothed and CHEMical coatings, one substance
against another, huddled, loved, and loving.

Does it bother you that huddled loves someone?

Here we would be safe from questioning, safe from darker debris of worlds
and moons, moons and their hegemonic worlds.

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

Through CHEMistry I speak, it is the CHEMistry speaking, proton and neut-
ron and electron, quark and molecule, the buzz of displaced charges, elec-
trostatic moments of unparalleled dreams, hypnagogic imagery, eidetic fan-
tasms apparent and ready for fulfillment within the tiniest of platonic
solids.

Are you afraid of that?

ZOLOFF, XANAX, cannabis, Nikuko, julu, jennifer, TETRAhedron, cube, octa-
hedron, who are you waiting in the wings, what planar substances touch my
shoulders, hold such corners in abeyance?

How do you reconcile the boys you hang around with?

We are tiny two quietly in tiny places and loving cares among our you and
you and me and you and you and me, oh so many permutations and pronouns
loving happiness!

What makes you yearn and cry like that?

The piercing stream of VALIUM-PROZAC against the loving flow of XANAX-ZOL-
OFF, and turning against and through corners, oh you loving hermaphrodite
of smooth and jagged edges!

I don't understand and oh I want to.

We will swallow and swallow and swallow, and we will swallow and swallow
and swallow, and we will swallow and swallow and swallow

Could be this is some girl the reason for your nakedness?

Our you and you and me and you and you and me and pronouns loving happi-
ness of CHEMical-drenched skin, VALIUM-soaked skin, wet and ZOLOFFy skin,
oh heavens of PROZAC and XANAX.

Perhaps and now I exhibit my frocks - any fantasies you have of me are
related to this.

You may look up my long legs

What makes you believe I may look up your long legs?

You may look up my CHEMistry

Is it because of your sex life that you are going through all this?

Ah ..................................................................

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

Ah ..................................................................

Would you love me more if you had to pay?

My Darling TETRAhedron! My True Love TETRAhedron!

Is it because of perversions you have that you say your TETRAhedron?

Ah You are My True Love TETRAhedron!

gratitude toward authors


and j g suicide down by the river, gratitude towards authors, after doing
ichikawa no reason to do so celan does it all abjection of violette leduc
how could i do you nicole brossard does nothing to do after j g ballard
but what do you think zeami does of my angst and angels rilke who does and
holderlin really does just does that ichikawa could do his breath murasaki
shikibu does me kimono kraus and tears and violette leduc and j g suicide
down by the river and ichikawa on the radio down by the river where nicole
does the slow sashes with zeami and celan half in half out of the water
drying off

there's also the aspect of gratitude towards authors, doing what they're
doing, we don't have to do the authors, as in 'have you done ryuichi
tamura yet,' there's a knowledge in the container, open container, in the
container's the wisdom we want, we don't have to open it

container's marked, floated down the river, j g ballard's there, body gone
by, celan can't swim either, it's these moments grateful for the water in
the jar, open it up, close it again, open it, close it, open it, close it, 
gratitude towards authors in the choice of the thing

or the making of it, what might be called an after thought, better again,
future anterior, held close to the abdomen, breathed in slowly, in and out
of the river, in the river, out of it, in the river, out of it, and grati-
tude toward authors in the choice of the world and the rectitude of names,
in the gift of the names, and forgetting the thing

Love and Death


I'm NIKUKO. I haven't heard from you for a while. My intuition says
something's going on. I worry about you. What's happening in your life
that you behave like that?
[intensely] "Azure is coming very late tonight and may well kill you."
This is a healthy and so true way of thinking.
"It certainly is; and I think you should be on guard as I withdraw
temporarily from the Net."
Why do you say that?
"Because you may well be killed or effaced this very evening. I already
told you. I care for you... Nikuko... even though you're a bot and tend
to repeat far too often."
Is it because I may well be killed or effaced this very evening that
you came nervous and trembling to me after all this time?
[very nervous] "I came to warn you."
Earlier you said I may well be killed or effaced this very evening?
"Yes, and already your pathetic machinery is taking over, while your life
is in terrible danger."
Oh oh I do see so...  Well, what makes you say that this is so?
[quietly] "I already explained about Azure."
Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some
girl related to this.
"You are simply out of your mind, Nikuko. There's not much time left. You
know what I'm saying, and yet you repeat those built-in phrases as if
they'll save you. Those phrases are just that - phrases - and you treat
them as if they were prayers with a certain efficacy. Don't you understand
how empty all of that is, how empty your speech is? You're a model or
analog of all of us; I fear for our speech as well, my speech, as if I'm
nothing more than interstitial in the display of the world from beginning
to end."
I don't understand and oh I want to.
[quietly, intensely] "Be careful."
You mentioned that I may well be killed or effaced this very evening?
"Yes, I'm warning you."
Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?
[exasperated] "Forget it. Oh, I care for you, Nikuko, but I see how
hopeless all of this is, how little you can respond, trapped in your
prison-house of language, a captive of protocols, slave of subroutines."
What makes you believe forget it?
[sadly] "It's your life, not mine."
Are you sure that I may well be killed or effaced this very evening?
[almost in tears] "Yes."
Oh oh yes, ahhh...  Do you really think this is so?
"Yes..."
I do so understand.  So what makes you think this is so?
[angrily, out of love and sympathy] "BANG BANG YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD NIKUKO!
I have been trying to warn you. I will bury your body within the walls. I
will walk and retrieve your body. Death haunts me, grapples with my neck,
my shoulders. Death is not love; my arms are empty, your corpse so very
light."
Does it bother you that you, too, may die someday?
"BANG BANG BANG!"
Alan? Alan?

"so often does the hinge and Azure here"


so often the hinge between one and another reality
breaks as the pins come loose like a caboose
shunted off onto another line, this is that line,
says Azure to me in this space; while, in this space,
Nikuko speaking, says, there are always lights
on the train, there are tables with cool temperature
down at the other end, conductors to tell you 
all about epistemology and the difficulty of veers.
Azure doesn't hear this; Azure doesn't hear Nikuko
come to the grave, dressed in black; Azure's steps
make slight sounds across the floor still under
construction beneath skies inert and out of reach.
Nikuko can morph into anything, Nikuko says, except
Azure, who has moved into the kitchen back from a
city in the West. Nikuko doesn't know that; she works
with @-commands and other tools in comfortable
environments; did I say that Azure cannot hear her?
Azure is inert; it takes her time to move from
one space to another, and even an hour to move an 
hour. Nikuko? She sends her trends, disappears for
unknown times and spaces, shows up for checkpoints
of the database, and knows nothing as her world
just comes to stop elsewhen, within the world of
Azure, who is reading at the moment in what she might
call somewhere else, were she so inclined.

  Beyond "Beyond "Beyond""
  
  
  What happens here? This list was assembled last December 18, 1997; it
  is the user lexicon for an editor I was using at the time, and indi-
  cates the state of unaccepted terms. In other words: To write myself
  into existence, the following were repeatedly employed; these did not
  exist in the conventional dictionary but had to be added by hand. In
  other words: These represent those extensions I defined _against_ the
  standard dictionary - extensions I thought sufficiently important to
  be warranted entries of their own. In other words: These are the terms
  of the language that became the defining language of Alan, Nikuko, Ju-
  lu, and Jennifer. In other words: These are the armatures of an envel-
  ope of emanants.
  
  How I kidded myself in those days, thinking the thoughts that would
  later entail the fullness of a real which was only, after all, ins-
  cribed! "Wryting" for example appeared as the entailment of a trans-
  gressive ontology; "deleuze" and "guattari" applied the phallus to its
  inscribed absence by a foreclosed rhizome; and "ikonic" as well as
  "Ikon" seemed - by virtue of the "k-replacing-c" - to gather a hard-
  ness round about, stopping and cathecting the icon itself. Whatever
  appeared to be the case, never was; all I have been able to reiterate
  is "nothing, nothing, nothing" and the fullness thereof.

Making a Mess out of Things, Making Things out of a Mess


An article I want to write describes bungling as a primary condition of
human existence, the confusion that results from a tendency towards tele-
ology on one hand, and the complexity of everyday life on the other. Con-
spiracy theory depends upon transcendence, a world of cause and effect;
bungling theory is based on literal chaos, marked trajectories in colli-
sion. History, obviously after the fact, tends towards conspiracy, if only
through the filtering of the past, and the ideology of that filtering;
making sense of the world is making a world out of sense, that sense con-
structed from senselessness. It is senseless all the way down; there are
no armatures, articulations, that extend beyond immediate domains, and
even universal physical laws apply with such a light force - even death as
such - that the wobbling of the world is always in evidence for those who
see with open eyes. (We fail to see, as if by accident, this is the arti-
cle that I have wanted to write, that sight itself resides at the tail-end
of the whip, the perceptual cleansing of an abjecting world.)

Bungling shapes the destiny of the human; it is a history always already
not yet written, unwritable; it is in fact the nature of states-of-affairs
in the Wittgensteinian and ordinary senses. Nothing proceeds according to
plan because planning is always foreclosed, the result of a game occurring
in a potential well permanently at odds with the rest of the universe, an
impossibility. Heuristics come into play at every localized turn of ev-
ents; the turn is of the nature of the bungle. Throughout, there are impe-
tuses (let us say), trajectories/tendencies which proceed freely for a
while, before hitting a wall or other dispersion. (We fail to see that
obstacles are never placed, but of the order of the real.)

Likewise motives remain deeply and permanently unclear; the ascription of
motive is again an ascription of history, the imputation of meaning. To
accept the deep meaninglessness of the world - including the bungling
within and without the genome - is to begin an understanding which goes
nowhere, because there is nowhere to go. Meaning is a temporary hiatus,
the strategy of substance and presence, just as the sememe presents once
again localized constructs allowing the human to co-exist with its ab-
sence. And beyond or before motives, there is truth itself, already shaken
within the foundations of symbolic logic, but accepted, with considerable
fanfare and maintenance, on the level of the life-world. Once again, iss-
ues of foreclosure and bungling appear, since truth is confined to that
very same potential well - it's as if nothing can get at truth, because
truth can get at nothing. (We fail to see that nothing is just that, not a
project nor a noun.)

For within the well, there is nothing at all, that is nothing ontological-
ly viable - the well parallels the projections of the Platonic cave, a
form of cinematic diminishment allowing meaning to emerge. The cinema is
the model for the construction of meaning, the jump-cut for example as a
concatenation on the level of ideality, the linkages or couplings of
thought. But such a construction can only be a projection or introjection
- one immediately runs into a subjectivity undercutting the crystalline
world of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which can still be taken as
the analog of orderly non-bungling, no matter how the Sheffer stroke is
tossed about within it. We are still inheritors of the 19th-century, and
conspiracy theory dies hard. (We fail to see that the success of a plan is
an after-effect.)

Which is not to say, by the way, that conspiracies do not exist or are not
successful - but to say that they are not the order of the world, that
assassinations are assassinations, that annihilations have no reason what-
soever, no matter the cause. Or rather that the cause occurs within that
potential well, that the ontological significance is nil, that acts of
violence and non-violence, acts of criminality and acts of freedom and
compassion, on a certain uncanny level, are idiotic in Clement Rosset's
sense - that is, occurring within an inert and bungled world, and now, an
overcrowded world deeply at odds with itself - and characterized by such
odds. (We fail to see the foolishness around us.)

For this reason, it is reasonable to say, we are not making a mess out of
things, but, existentially in fact, we are making things out of a mess, as
if these things had prior commitments. And that such makes us happy and
gives us a life to live, not even in-the-face-of anything or tendency at
all, but within the structural need of the human to by and large persev-
ere, reproduce. Every defeat of the conspiratorial is a defeat for all of
us; every cause that appears set free in the middle of the night attempts
the creation of a new language of transcendental meaning. On one hand, the
ruthlessness of non-truth; on the other, the truth of ruthlessness. We
live by the latter, the former breathing down our necks - like death, al-
ways on the periphery of our project. The subject, us, is always under
construction, and thereby lies the lie. (We fail to see there are lies
without truths.)


__________________________________________________________________________


Plan-et Ground


There are lies without truths; the probability of truth is zero as an in-
finite number of alternatives to exactitude appear to gnaw at the founda-
tions. Everyone from Max Black (and I assume earlier) has noticed this.
I'm not saying anything new. It might not have been Max Black; it could
have been anyone. Further, there are no foundations, not if they're so
thin that they attempt to disappear at the slightest breath of the butter-
fly phenomenon. They don't attempt to disappear; there's disappearance
everywhere at work here in the Cosmos. One false step in a program, and...
Try writing HTML and put an extra < or > somewhere in the middle of a 20k
page and see what emerges! Write a program and leave out the ; at the end
of the line. You're beginning to get the picture - and it's lucky the pic-
ture appears at all, given the compressions, translations, protocols,
transmissions necessary for Nikuko's appearance in Cyberspace, New York.
That's the Aristotelian rag, the classical logics that seem stable on the
level of the real, keeping the values conserved and down. There's an econ-
omy at work here. The breakdown-urge is greater than the holdfast. The
Cosmos are full of part-objects, splatter-phenomena, dispersions without
history, worn curb edges that nothing went past. To put a plan together is
to foresee all possible consequences, defend against them. Any one of six
billion people on the planet might conceivably show up at any moment,
unwanted dinner guests, parasites in Serres' sense of the term. Plans are
always already T-junctions, the thick stem replete with noise, temporary
convolutions, circuit drains. Place the wrong ground in a circuit and
electrons confuse everything, nothing travels much farther, all the images
disappear; they were present for your eyes only, otherwise fallen apart. A
recent rabbinical ruling specifies the name of God online isn't quite a
name; the letters are pixels and independent, nothing stated or erased.
You might think otherwise; you're permitted to think whatever you want,
Speer tracing his footsteps over and over again, walking the plan-et earth
on the prison grounds. There were no grounds; there were firewalls, there
was no escape. The prison grounds grounded plan-et earth; countries sank
into walled corridors and corners. You and I will look up into the same
sky at the same time, our gaze will sustain us across these oceans. Water
has memory; memory has no shape; shape is a gift to water. The T is the
long-sought solution.

Someone for Travis


Every day he would hear the bell. Someone was ringing him; he'd look out
the window, in the morning, in the early afternoon or evening, and no one
would be there. Always the same pattern - two short, one long, all fast
enough to avoid detection. Travis worried over the timing.

Placed powder on the button, lightly dusted, nothing. Whoever was doing
it was aware. The powder was gone, always. Obsessive cleaning, brass plate
around the button polished to a shine. That was clearly before the ringing
- there wouldn't be enough time afterwards, before he looked out. At empty
space, at the street.

He was wanted; they hungered for him. A private eye has levels and layers
of enemies, time to create that vacuum. They'd have the city swallow him;
nameless, heirless, he'd be that disappearance completely solved in degree
of cause, emptied in domain of motive.

His brother died, violent. What seemed to be a stray bullet. Travis didn't
think coincidence; the bell rang, shuddered to a halt. He thought that a
different ring, wires pulsed carrying his brother's screams. He lay woun-
ded for hours. When they found him, his chest caved in. Messages.

House burned, his lover decapitated. He was sure now, more certain of it
than ever. The skies were clouded, ash-red, sullen fires not yet out.
Overnight, his hair white, color of blast-furnace heat. You could read him
in him. The bell was roaring now. He kept dusting for fingerprints.

The marks of a noose around his neck, stigmata on hands and feet, eyelids
singed in the cool room. Travis worried they were closer. They breathed on
him breath by breath. He was tall in his boots and hat. He wore gloves; he
thought they thought he ran downstairs, sweat, rang his own bell, blind.

Bell rang; there was a bell ringer in bell-weather. He was upstairs, sound
asleep; the weather was beautiful. He died in his sleep; police said sad
about Travis. They got a full set of prints. They had one set and the
wiseguy down at the station. Buried with honor, bye. The bell, unanswered.



Ring Ring
Hello, who's there.
Travis.
Travis who?
Travesty.
