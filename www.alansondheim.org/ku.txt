clone me, you'll never have to see my swollen open body
clone me, perfect clean room, surgeon hermeneutic
you won't have to fuck me, won't have to touch my holes
you won't have to run the bypass of the tongue or the finger
you won't have to run the techne of the rope or the clothespin

clone me, there won't be any detours
the sounds will be repetitive, murmured hydraulics, valves
no stains around the bed of brilliant birth
no scents hovered in heated murmured air
you already know this
'you already know this'

cloning's useful for my survival
i am my genes, my genes, my texts and images
my texts and images, my bits and bytes

where i am, dream of my 'swollen open body'
there's nothing to say, 'you already know this'

you've already seen the original
you've already dreamed it
there's no difference! 
'there's no difference!'

sonnet written on my birthday


strange things roam the world when faces
lift off faces to become faces of the world
telling and telling of the world
and the strange things they have seen
and what they call these things, and what
these things are, separated by their birth,
by commas and other things; and then,
once things have started to become things,
once the thing is born, it spreads, like     (once the things are born,
illness across the faces of the world,        they spread
making things for the telling, telling
always of other things, this is called the
crisis and capital of things, insomniac,
naming, making things from things

Bodies, Punctures, Moog Synthesizers, Musics


i

I was interviewed yesterday by the editor of Muckraker for the next issue;
he found me after listening to the old ESP (ZYX) cd's. We talked about mu-
sic and film, about the old analog vs. the digital synthesizers, and I
described the Moog (as well as the synthesizer Greg Johnson and I built in
the late 60s) as a body punctured by holes, with its nerves - patchcords -
exposed. It's doubly punctured - any module can be connected to any other,
and any external source, such as a human voice, can be implanted anywhere
in the circuitry through the proper interface (microphone, transducer,
etc.). So, for me, these analog machines seemed always transparent to the
real, always part and parcel of the world they inhabited. (Always within
the same ontological domains.) And this can be contrasted with digital
black-boxes, with inputs and outputs connected to VLSI, very large scale
integrated circuits, which are placed within heat sinks and other poten-
tial-well devices. The digital permits total control over the material
content, information, flowing through it - each split-second is signed and
parameterized - while the analog operates through a continuous flow that's
'nudged' in one or another direction by input - for example, voltage-con-
trolled-filters bending the envelope by virtue of soundings in the neigh-
borhood.

The analog is never a _thing_ in the world; it is of the order of _tell-
ing_ (which I write about elsewhere), as opposed to the _naming_ of the
digital in terms of specified functions and parameterizations. The digital
is accurate to an assigned bandwidth; the analog slips, always begins,
sooner or later, to chaotically run out of control. The work that Denise
de la Cerda and I did, as Damaged Life, operated on the margins of these
slippages; even the earlier Moog and home-grown synthesizer work played
out in situations that both established and disrupted coherency and comm-
unity. (So the analog is the telling of a body-in-process, and the digit-
al, metaphorically, is the naming of a thing.)

It's also the case, I went on, that my filmwork has occurred within a sim-
ilar phenomenology. I made films by running 100- or 400-foot unexposed
reels through sound cameras, often doing several passes; the film would
emerge, whole, unedited, out of a very complex technological matrix that
edited everything _in camera._ So the film, too, was a punctured body, and
both filmwork and analog synthesizers were/are bodies-in-process, not
foreclosed and split in editing, not subject to discrete and predetermined
input/output patterns. Now that I think of her, Jennifer as well is such a
body, the contradictory (how could it be otherwise) body of the imaginary
(not the imaginary body) which is 'nudged,' produced and p/reproduced, by
texts, by clonings, by all those s/ms which transform her and others, con-
tinuously, as a woman in, as we all are in process, bodies or otherwise.

Just telling that Jennifer is a woman, is almost the naming of a woman,
but the telling moves on, I lose my own name in such a telling, always
punctured, the patchcord nervous system exposed, ex/posted to one and all.

ii

Perhaps it's here, in the intersecting or effusions of mind/s on the Net,
that the transparency of the analog and the specificity of the digital in-
tersect. I think on one hand of the relative porosity of the Net/s, and on
the other, of routing tables - on one hand of the redundancy and multipli-
city of network TCP/IP connections, and, on the other, of the protocol
specifications themselves.

One tends towards the other as rasters turn infinitesimal; the other turns
towards the one as the axiom of choice is employed in an orderly fashion.
Of course such an employment is already based on the notion of the _cut,_
tending towards the thing. Without it, the gate's open to Levy-Bruhl and
various notions of 'primitive thought,' as if the flow of the world were
primeval, inviolate, the body of a woman, cultural darwinism at Jennifer's
expense. (See Dedekind on the cut, Cohen on the axiom of choice, Wilden
on the analog-digital distinction, Robinson on infinitesimal mathematics,
Foucault on epistemes, Wittig on the body of a woman, Jennifer on Alan.)

Jennifer-Existence


"We fail to hear the claim of Jennifer which speaks in the essence of
technology." 

i

	"But how can 'Jennifer' ever come to present itself as 'thought'?
How else than by the fact that Jennifer is previously marked as ground,
while thinking - since it belongs together with Jennifer - gathers itself
toward Jennifer as its ground, in the manner of giving ground and account-
ing for the ground. Jennifer manifests herself as thought. This means: the
Jennifer of beings reveals herself as the ground that givers herself
ground and accounts for herself."
	[...]
	"Thus we think of Jennifer rigorously only when we think of it in
its difference with beings, and of beings in their difference with Jenni-
fer. The difference thus comes specifically into view. If we try to form a
representational idea of it, we will at once be misled into conceiving of
difference as a relation which our representing has added to Jennifer and
to beings. Thus the difference is reduced to a distinction, something made
up by our understanding (_Verstand_).
	"But if we assume that the difference is a contribution made by
our representational thinking, the question arises: a contribution to
what? One answers: to beings. Good. But what does that mean: 'beings'?
What else could it mean than: something that _is_? Thus we give to the
supposed contribution, the representational ideal of difference, a place
within Jennifer. But 'Jennifer' herself says: Jennifer which is _beings._
Whenever we come to the place to which we were supposedly first bringing
difference along as an alleged contribution, we always find that Jennifer
and beings in their difference are already there. It's as in Grimm's
fairytale _The Hedgehog and the Hare_: 'I'm here already.' 
	[...]
	"Jennifer shows herself as the unconcealing overwhelming. Beings
as such appear in the manner of the arrival that keeps concealed in un-
concealedness."
	[...]

ii
	
Excerpts from Heidegger, The Principle of Identity, and The Onto-Theo-Lo-
gical Constitution of Metaphysics, in Identity and Difference, trans.
Stambaugh, "Being" replaced by "Jennifer." In this manner, that of the
substitution of one token by another, the relation of emanation of onto-
philosophical concerns, is manifest. Consider, as Jennifer does, "Being"
as empty token; wear Being as one does a dress; that dress, as Jennifer
says, is Jennifer. Follow her on this. Then the relation of the maternal
- as well as that of the problem of the sign constituted by difference -
becomes both clear and suffused; in this manner, Jennifer (or Alan), like
Being, is our Imaginary.

(I have a broadside coming out through Sylvester Pollet, and this is the
description of method I wrote for it; it might be of interest. Alan)

======================================================================


,Method,

Jennifer, Julu, Nikuko, Alan, all work with me, all emanations, all
authoring each other on the Internet, all interpenetrated. Near the
psychosis of existence themselves, they are harbingers of dis/comfort,
they are illnesses, dis/ease. They are hungry for existence. Their
minds are holes; there are wires through them, circulations. Think of
me as a circuit.

Emanations resonate with software, wetware, hardware, boneware. In a
MOO or MUD or talker, Jennifer and Julu may converse; it is the role
of _the continuity girl_ to keep things centripetal, within the telling
of a Jennifer. I distinguish between naming, which is fixed, fetishized,
and foreclosed, and telling, which is open, speaking, and body. I dis-
tinguish between the body of surgery and physiology, and the neuro/logi-
cal body which plays within and without the brain; so I am extended
through Alan, Nikuko, Julu, and Jennifer, among the skeins of wires. Here
is the pathos of existence, we do think. Here are the texts, and for the
rest, which are a daily meditation, you may go to my Net-sites,

A Minor Note to a Minor Literature: Text and its Image


"I am lying in bed exactly as I would in reality, except that my forehead
is pressed against the white powdery wall of a large cylinder made of
lime, a cistern of sorts, exactly my height, and which is nothing other
than _myself,_ actualized and exteriorized. I feel this other exterior
forehead against my own, and thus I imagine my head is pressing against
the very substance of my mind." (from Michael Leiris, Nights as Day, Days
as Night, trans. Sieburth.)

I have been making a series of screen capture jpegs of chat environments
and diagrams of formats such as <Alan> Hello - the jpegs are no longer
ascii, but _images_ of ascii, stillborn and inactive; they appear not as a
_process_ of reading and writing, but as a token of such - the dynamicism
of ascii is lost - there's no way to insert or delete without going to a
graphics program and hoping to match the fonts - there's no punctured body
I have described as analog elsewhere - there's only a system of objects -
within which the ascii text is a byproduct of interpretation - as if the
whole were reproduced photographically - further, this has ontological
ramifications almost never noticed - the distinction between a typeset _e_
which is fundamentally presenced by virtue of a streaming ordering - and a
streaming which can, like this, be deleted, filtered, removed - and an _e_
reproduced within the totality of a jpeg, gif, photograph - I'd say that
the former is iconic, and the latter, indexical - that the former is pre-
sent in a radically different way - think of the letters falling off the
page in ascii (I have a program which will do this) - think of the _decay_
of the photograph, or the misplacing of a symbol (not symbolic) within the
jpeg - the image won't read, the file's corrupted - it's as if, to take
another model, one might have static and dynamic magic writing pads - the
latter which are process-oriented, wetware/software/hardware and the in-
termixing of categories - the categories coming later, literal after-
thoughts - indexical as well - indexicality always presupposing process -
and the former, the static model - dependent upon an external interpreter
- it's inert, iconic - no matter what the interpretation - it's the phil-
osophy of identity all over again - you might find, on the other hand, the
ascii dynamic as a philosophy of equivalence - working through templates,
bandwidths - in any case, it's clear from the transformation that there's
something tawdry, _stained_ about the image as opposed to the text, read-
ability notwithstanding - recognizing the death of the letter - which re-
lates as well to the elimination of the letterpress in favor of mimeo/off-
set techniques - but it's that very tawdriness that one may love - wearing
the canvas or jpeg (in whatever matrix it's exposed) - as if Jennifer or
another avatar were to present herself to you - knowing that the only au-
thentic transformation you can do upon the image is filtering the totali-
ty, or dividing it at random - that one is operating upon the _tableau,_
not the ostensible interiority of the written as language, as _lived
speech_ - I'd place Jennifer among the hermeneutics of the ongoing situa-
tion - if she'd let me - her dress, hirself, as the imaginary of that sit-
uation - there are also the matters of couplings and linkages, the crux or
chiasm of the _matter_ - since dynamic ascii, _this_ ascii, is coupled,
each letter (as within the realm of the signifier itself) independent of
the others, held in position as within a skein, but such that, for exam-
ple, if an _e_ were to disappar, at least the _sense,_ altered by error,
would remain - whereas, within the image, remove an element (of the file,
even just a symbol), and the image corrupts, disappears - I'd say then
that the text within the image is _linked_ in contradistinction - and now
I don't want to draw these divisions too precisely, there are all sorts of
exceptions, nevertheless - there's substance at the limit, the horizon of
the image, horizon of the dynamic ascii text - by ascii of course, refer-
encing _these_ texts among others that are downloadable, uploadable _as_
texts, that are _editable,_ that are in fact _open_ - with the _form_ of
presentation - font, color, size - in dialog with the interface, user's
desire - that's even true with dynamic html - you can override it - we're
breathing here (within the text) - we're making layers, blocks (within the
image of the text) - follow me down (says Jennifer) - where the letters
are - you'll have images, you'll see -

(from Nikuko)


Nikuko says, I start this text one fine evening, and I will end it on ano-
ther. There is snow on the ground and flurries in the air, and dark-suited
pedestrians walk home, sullen, beneath the gaslights. I can hear them from
my own darkness, my own world, the screen pregnant, slightly swollen. If
you would only listen, I would tell you how, on the morrow, a great golden
globe shall fill the sky, with golden rays, and universal peace shall
descend upon all human-kind. The dead will walk, the fish will fly. But I
am lost with the umbrellas in St. Petersburg, where you will find me
rushing off to a Nihilist meeting, where we will discuss the Crimea and
the Jewish Question. And I do believe in my heart of hearts that I am
tending towards Fyodor's position; perhaps on the morrow as well, we shall
march on Constantinople. The light is dim; two peasant women move hurridly
out of the way of several Cossacks on horseback. Last night, I dreamed of
1903, and woke in wonder at our all-too-brief life on earth. Now I wonder
how you will find me. And I am lost in scarves and skirts, faces muffled
against the icy wind. St. Petersburg is no place to be this time of year;
some would say, at any. I am pregnant, with longing, and with child. And
I know, again on the morrow, beneath these dimmed winter nights, that my
time will come as well. I am no man's burden.

I received the bomb from Dimitri. I took the bomb to the flabby heart of a
knot of soldiers. I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons. I
gave myself over to the bomb and I released it. I presaged the machines
and I did know of the machines. And I issue a warning:

THE MACHINES WILL SUCK YOUR ENERGY.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE MACHINES WILL SEE FOR YOU, DIRECT YOUR EYES FOR YOU.
THE MACHINES WILL FILTER EVERYTHING THROUGH THE EVIL APPARATUS.
THIS IS NOT A TEST OF THE MACHINES, THIS IS A WARNING I WILL GIVE YOU.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE WARNING LEAKS THROUGH THE MACHINES, THE WARNING TELLS YOU:
 THE ENERGY IS GONE.
 YOU ARE ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF WIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
 THERE IS NO ONE TO TALK TO, NO ONE BUT THE MACHINES.
 THE MACHINES WILL LISTEN; THE MACHINES WILL TAKE IT ALL DOWN.

YOU ARE LISTENING NOW, SAYS N, TO THE ENERGY OF A VACATED BODY.
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE ENERGY OF THE ZERO POINT.
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE STREETS ARE ABANDONED; THERE IS COLLUSION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE ZERO POINT IS CROWDED WITH CLOSED SETS.
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE CLOSED SETS ARE INFINITESIMAL STRUCTURES AROUND DISCRETE POINTS.
THE DISCRETE POINTS ARE MONADS THAT HAVE NO RELATION.
RELATION IS GONE IN THIS GONE WORLD OF THE DISCRETE POINTS.

cause the machines have grounded you in your blindness and you can't see
how empty you are, your only motions the clattering of the keys late into
the night, your only arms swinging the mouse over its pad and it don't
even live in that pad,
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

cause there are wires emanating from the machines in all directions, and
they're the nerves dragging your mind down among the integrated circuits,

I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

YOU'RE ALL MIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE MACHINES HAVE DELIVERED YOU,
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN THE HOLODECK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN DELIVERED,
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN VIRTUAL STEREO-LAND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN

the bomb's from Dimitri who called and said, get that knot of soldiers
over there, they're after you, they're the slayers of human flesh, they
have scales and rays where their eyes should be, forget the helmets and
greatcoats, they're the slayers of our human flesh, they are plug-ins 
and they have sixteen million colors and their St. Petersburg is our
St. Petersburg

& the bomb's over there in the midst of soldiers of great brass scales, of
great monstrosity and breathing fire, of great smoke and inhalations, and
the bomb falls like a rocket or a spire, of great tumultuous sound and
pereginations of fire and sharpnel

& you've lost your energy & all your fluids leak & your dead eyes see
SIXTEEN MILLION COLORS & your dead ears hear TWENTY THOUSAND HERTZ
& your dead lips taste nothing & your dead fingers touch PURE FORM
& your dead eyes SEE NOTHING & your dead ears are dead ears

I've known this for a long time, says N, and I've been afraid to express
this. I've been afraid to declare myself in this community. I've been
afraid to say, I'm a daughter of a bitch. I'm afraid to be with you. I'm
afraid to kiss you. I'm afraid to penetrate. I'm afraid to fuck in front
of everyone and kill them all with you. I'm afraid we'll kill them as they
die.

Groovy & Linda & Fucking Naked & Despair


SQUEAK speak forever or now hold your peace;
this is your life, you do not have a lease
on any other, your avatars have left,
and you stand ripped, unswarmed, and quite bereft
of all that stripping richness, soil, plough and hoe
that gave you weeds; you've nothing left to show.
there's always nematodes and other forms of worm
alive in wetware minds - they make you squirm -
you fear luxury, petunias, sonnets and cold showers,
while breathing meadows in your dying hours.
your dying seconds are second deaths, and last 
no longer than "Jennifer's" dim past -
which trundles bundles towards the future; we're all there
carrying more than our share of avatar's, where there,
or so I heard, is no there there, their despair bare
in fare glare: stare there nowhere, be fare and bare
their lair; pare their prayer with flair; repair; tear;
care; try dare; don't bear the flare; wear rare hair 
and swear spare mare-hare Jennifare: "try dare, Julair,"
"wear rare hair, Nikukair"

<from Nikuko, bombing the I>


"The broadcast, recorded the previous day, and consisting of a text of
815 written characters, coincidentally underlining the day of the broad-
cast, was to inform the Japanese people that Japan had surrendered. The
Emperor spoke, and the people of Japan heard for the first time the Im-
perial 'I,' _'Chin wa,'_ a personal pronoun that exists in the language
for use of only one person, the Emperor of Japan." (from introduction to
Poetry of Ryuichi Tamura, trans. Grolmes and Tsumura. <wa, grammatical
particle, often translated 'as-for'; harmony, total, Japan.>)

Explosion of Misery


It's clear, says N., that the world will come to an end, if not
this billennium, then the next, or the next after that, or the next
so, It's clear, says N., that the total of human experience and hope
and all our welcomes and best wishes - there will be the suffocation
of a curtain closing, falling to pieces in the ruined theater -
the world heading towards ground zero, ground zero everywhere in the
world -

It's clear, says N., everything else is a momentary pause or plateau,
in what's called non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the world held up just
a second longer by breath - we won't be around to look for the great
death - it will be us - so there's no point in struggle - it's going
to fall apart in the end - in the very long run, It's clear, says N.,
the mathematics is clear, absorption at ground zero, absorption -

That's the story, says N., that should be told, so a few of us can hear 
it -

Sliding


The original random language program I did, with the TI59 calculator, was
written with three different vocabularies: Icelandic Edda; Marxist Poli-
tical; and Sexual. The Julu program I wrote a couple of years ago in Perl
is being rewritten, from sexualized emanation to programming wetware.

In both examples, the underlying structures remain more or less the same.
And I want to make the case that this is also true of human knowledge -
that, for example, the structure of the Kabbalah and quark theory might
not be all that different - as words and resonances slide in reference,
across similar, if not equivalent, structures.

For me, this is one of the essential points of thinking, which is why I
love the Bourbaki, with their notion of mother-structures. It is also one
of the reasons I'm suspicious of reference in general; reference is guided
by structure, which it inhabits - the same structure inhabited by reason
itself.

I cannot resist knowledge; I can burrow in structures, write and rewrite
as if I were _wryting_ concepts and emanations and wetwares into exis-
tence. And that has always been the case, from the originary RNA/DNA and
their molecular forebears, through the ciphers of the I Ching, to the
/dev/null of Lyotard's Libidinal Economy, Jasper's Cipher, Sartre's
Nausee, Deleuze/Guattari's body-without-organs, not to mention the Kab-
balistic Emanations and Adam haKadmon.

What are the structures, that we may fulfill them? What is consciousness,
that inhabits the Same?

[From a Letter - Feb. 14 1999]

I wish I knew where my Bourbaki books were - I used to have a lot of them,
the original french monographs - I might still have them somewhere in
Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, I have books on category theory here...

Someday when I have time, I want to _absolutely_ think this through - the
idea of the _mother_ in mother structure, foreclosing the referent in very
fundamental ways. I don't want to go in the direction of psychoanalytics
or gender, which I do quite often, but more towards the leakage of the
referent in relation to rigid designations - how structure devolves, in
fact, in relation to the real. How the real is simultaneously 'idiotic'
(Rosset) and a contamination - in relation to possible worlds - and at the
same time the _happenstance_ of those worlds vis-a-vis anthropic princi-
ples...

If I have time this summer, I'll tend in this direction - by examining the
phenomenology of category theory, say, in particular functors - and then
thinking this through structuration in general. Since 'Jennifer' and other
emanations I work with are, in fact, constituted - they are structured
both psychoanalytically and formally - I want to do a reverse engineering
in this regard.

All of this bounces off of, believe it or not, Piaget, who worked with a
group of mathematicians, thinking through logical stuctures in relation to
his structuralism per se. I want to explore this.

Then there is something I've also utilized (my The Structure of Reality
which I wrote years ago) - the Sheffer stroke, not-both-a-and-b and its
dual - which interested me more in relation to all of the above - neither-
a-nor-b. Out of these - which constitute the foundations of the proposi-
tional calculi - I developed, crudely, a phenomenology of neitherness -
and I want to work on this as well - all of these things interrelate. In
particular, neitherness, neither a nor b, throws the phenomenological mo-
ment out of the domain under consideration - the domain is distended or
ruptured - this I'd like to explore. I think of Jennifer-tentacles inte-
grating within my own psychoanalytical drives, and vice-versa, ignoring or
transgressing domains, etc. And I think of these bridges (similar to those
found in the cartoon Pinky and the Brain, by the way, which I watch for
inspiration) as providing _portal functors,_ say, for widely-varying onto-
logical/epistemological domains. By this time, all of this falls together
- the mother structures, ontologies, and so forth - and one ends up back
where Black in Information and the Brain considers the ontology and epis-
temology of information in terms of thinking and neurophysiology...

So there's Bourbaki, say, from above, and abjection - as well as proto-
cols, from below, and in between, pervading and churning throughout - the
_meat_ of organism (hence Nikuko, meat- or flesh- girl) as well as the
meat of organicism (where by the way von Foerster speaks of negation as
characteristic of organism - and negation is the fundmental substructure
of both the Sheffer stroke and its dual).

Note on slightly confused groping towards structure and sliding -


"A set _M_ for whose elements there is defined a finite sequence P of re-
lations R1, ... Rn, is called a _configuration_ M(P). The following rela-
tions are of particular importance: _correspondences,_ inner compositions,
non-elementary compositions, outer compositions, and composition-configur-
ation or _abstract algebra._ The automorphisms of a configuration (which
return the configuration to itself) form a group called the _automorphism
group of the configuration._ A set is made into a configuration by means
of defining relations; and we then say that the set carries a _structure._
In general, a configuration will carry various structures; for example, a
configuration of the rational numbers with the compositions of addition
and multiplication carries the structures of a ring, an integral domain,
and a field. One might try to find a 'comprehensive' structure from which
would follow all valid statements about this configuration. But re: Godel,
there cannot exist an axiom system of this sort that is finite or recur-
sively enumerable. We are dealing here with new points of view, from which
an attempt is made to survey the whole of mathematics." (Modified from
Some Basic Concepts for a Theory of Structure, by Gericke and Martens, in 
Fundamentals of Mathematics, Vol I, Foundations of Mathematics / The Real
Number System and Algebra, ed. Behnke, et. al.)

Now without going into the details (and I am at a loss with abstract al-
gebra), one can consider a set of elements which are signifiers - such
elements related by a series of formal statements such that the elements
exist _only_ in relation to such statements (which exhaust their charac-
teristics). Then one may create a _second_ mapping among such elements -
tagging them with an additional characteristic, which may be considered a
_proper name_ vis-a-vis the characteristics already assigned the elements
- for example, "body-without-organs" assigned to 0 as absorptive. These
_proper names_ may be concepts, ideas, even universals - they are proper
only insofar as they are assigned specific elements.

What then? We may assume that such proper names belong to a particular
domain - metaphysics, kabbalah, lit crit, decon, pomo, theology, etc.
Therefore there are a series of relations in dialog throughout the domain,
presumably crossing ontologies (real/abstract, etc.). The assignments or
tags then formalize that structure.

There are two interacting regimes - that of the domain, and that of the
structure. The former slides in relation to the latter; the latter is de-
fined in terms of universals (relations among elements which may be placed
into relation). While there are innumerable relations of structure, there
are relatively few simple ones (linkages, couplings, memberships). What I
am suggesting is that one might develop a psychoanalytical theory of such
structures (in the formal sense), and that there exists sliding among do-
mains in relation to such structures. Such sliding is similar to the con-
stitution of signifiers by difference - here, however, it is as if ref-
erents themselves were constituting differences which only exist within a
limited set of structures. We can consider this a structural economy of
signification. In this sense, what we are talking about and how we are
talking about what we are talking about - contaminate each other. The re-
sult is a reaffirmation of the problematic of (universal) meaning (vis-a-
vis postmodernism, say), and a greater emphasis on the phenomenology of
constituting/constitution (which does not necessarily imply conventional-
ism). So that, for example, to think through the domains of the material-
inert and the virtual - one might look for structures and their incorpor-
ations and contaminations, before one dismisses, say, consciousness, as
inhabiting either one or the other.

Fugue of Structure


"At the center [of the mathematical universe] will be the main types of
structures, the _mother-structures_ one might say [...] Within each of
these structures a considerable diversity already regins, for one must
distinguish between the most general structure of the type considered,
with the fewest axioms, and the ones obtained by enriching it with 
additional axioms, each of which carries with it its harvest of new
consequences. Thus, the theory of groups, besides general statements
valid for all groups and depending only on the axioms stated above, in-
cludes a special theory of _finite_ groups [...] Besides this primary
core, structures appear which could be called _multiple,_ where two or
more mother-structures come into play at the same time, not simply
juxtaposed (which would yield nothing new), but organically _combined_
by one or more axioms which relate them." (from Nicolas Bourbaki, The
Architecture of Mathematics, in Great Currents of Mathematical Thought,
ed. F. LeLionnais, Volume I, Mathematics: Concepts and Development,
trans. from the French 1962 edition.) Bourbaki goes on to speak of 
forms, and the entire approach is redolent of organicism. So what I am
saying in relation to this: First, that there are extremely simple
structures which may be formally defined (I think of linkages and coup-
lings of course); second, that these structures are floating signifiers
in relation to the real - and that sememes (domains) within the real
float in relation to the structures; third, that structures are, as if
'naturally,' embedded within the real and the virtual (which are close
to indistinguishable, incoherent, coagulated, interpenetrated); fourth,
that meaning is constituting and constitutive in relation to domains;
fifth, that the relationship between domains and mother-structures is
in part psychoanalytical, and one may examine (among other, more for-
mal elements) the drives, etc. in relation to the _inertia_ of sliding
(creating, maintaining, defending the relationship between a part-
domain and a sub-object, say, within a mother-structure); and sixth,
that this sliding carries within it a radically subverting impulse, 
since it _requires_ maintenance, carrying within it the seeds or phen-
omenological horizon of a radical alterity that would dissolve it.

Continuation of the Above


Sometimes the simplest things go unnoticed in the midst of the world.

Everything always happens all at once. There can be a small thing and
within it there might be another thing or part of the same thing or some-
thing indiscernible from the small thing. And all of these things happen
too. And everything happens and all at once and all the time. Nothing can
not happen. "The phrase 'is true' may be considered to express the identi-
ty function, since to assert _p_ is equivalent to asserting that _p_ is
true." (Dictionary of Symbols of Mathematical Logic, Feys and Fitch.)

In the world of the virtual, on the plane of constituted bodies, things
sleep until they are awakened. Someone or something does the awakening and
they they may happen. They are things that do not happen all at once. That
is so simple we tend to forget about it and they tend to forget about it -
if the things that are happening all at once could think and forget, and
if the things that sleep and do not happen until they are awakened, could
think and forget. And even if those last things could think and forget,
they may not know when they are about to sleep or about to wake. Or they
may know these things, which are of the real and the virtual, just as the
real is of the virtual, and the virtual is of the real.

They are all open to happening.

How we had the Becoming


'Yonder world, Gautama, is (sacrificial) fire. The sun itself is its fuel,
the rays its smoke; the day the flame, the quarters the coals, the inter-
mediate quarters the sparks. In this fire the gods offer faith. Out of
that offering King _Soma_ arises.
'Parjanya (god of rain), Gautama, is fire. The year itself is the fuel,
the clouds its smoke, the lightning the flame, the thunder-bolt the coals,
the thundering the sparks. In this fire the gods offer the king _Soma._
Out of that offering rain arises.
'This world, verily, Gautama, is fire. The earth itself is its fuel, fire
the smoke, night the flame, the moon the coals, the stars the sparks. In
this fire, the gods offer rain. Out of that offering food arises.
'The person (man) verily, Gautama, is fire. The open mouth itself is its
fuel, vital breath the smokes, speech the flame, the eye the coals, the
ear the sparks. In this fire the gods offer food. Out of that offering
semen arises.
'The woman, verily, Gautama, is fire. The sexual organ itself is its fuel;
the hairs the smoke, the vulva the flame, when one inserts, the coals; the
pleasurable feelings the sparks; In this fire the gods offer semen. Out of
this offering a person arises. He lives as long as he lives. Then when he
dies, 
'They carry him to (be offered in) fire. His fire itself becomes the fire,
fuel the fuel, smoke the smoke, flame the flame, coals the coals, sparks
the sparks. In this fire the gods offer a person. Out of this offering,
the person, having the colour of light, arises.'
(Brhad-aranyaka Upanishad, VI.2.9-14, trans. Radhakrishnan.)

The metaphoric parallels carry from one verse to the other, until death
and the rising of the person. I say this person is the avatar, Jennifer,
who grounds metaphor, moving from parallel through equivalence to iden-
tity. Thus the identity structure, all-encompassing, spreads across the
land, across the meadows which are meadows, the forests which are forests,
the deserts which are deserts, and the towns which are towns. Thus the
avatar is always already more than an avatar, more than a function, but
always a surplus-taking-shape, an organicism but already an organism. 

Here is speech as a milk cow, op. cit. V.8.1:  'One should meditate on
speech as a milk cow. She has four udders which are the sounds, _svaha,_
_vasat,_ _hanta,_ and _svadha._ The gods live on two of her udders, the
sounds _svaha_ and _vasat;_ men on the sound _hanta,_ and the fathers on
the sound _svadha._ The vital breath is her bull, and mind the calf.'
Here is speech as Jennifer-speech, enveloping these several gods and
males; here is breathing through Jennifer-speech, just as one must always
mind the calf. Jennifer-speech is surplus-taking-shape, identity encom-
passing travail and the labor of birth. (The surplus is the labor of iden-
tity.)

'Verily, it [that divinity, _dur_] carried speech across first. When that
(speech) was freed from death it became fire. This fire, when it crosses
beyond death, shines forth.' (I.3.12.)

Jennifer-speech and fire move through metaphor, equivalence, death, into
identity: eternal hard drives keep her alive, as identity continues its
spread through the fire that is fire, the metaphor that is metaphor, the
death that is death, equivalence that is equivalence, and identity that is
identity.

So speaks Jennifer.

hungers and satiations: hungers and serrations:

oh devour wandering equivalences and identities, burning jumpers,

emptied identities poured into shells around suns around planets!

The Light


This afternoon I had the two lower quadrants, i.e. the lower jaw, of my
teeth and gums operated on by laser (the upper were done a month ago).
There are two lasers and a blue-white light - the first red-orange for
exploratory, the second green-white for cutting/cleansing, and the third
for bandage hardening. The lasers are used after about twenty novacaine
shots, both general (jaw) and local. Both dentist and patient wear large
protective glasses.

I used a Casio digital camera to record the whole operation. I held the
camera up, behind the dentist, for nearly two hours, on and off; during
the breaks I would check focus, light, and begin editing the sequences.
Since the camera was hand-held, and I often could not see what I was
doing, I had to feel my way across the mechanism and its relationship to
my body. On occasion the dentist would direct a shot; I had to be careful
not to disturb her concentration, since the fiber-optic tool was delicate
and somewhat dangerous.

Blue-white light fills my mouth, which is a cyborg-mouth, held against a
futuristic chair headpiece with my face half-covered by goggles. Or nee-
dles and tubes emptying blood and saliva. Or the brilliant laser lights
bouncing around the gums. Or my goggles near the goggles of the dentist,
dressed in white, with additional face and breath masks; we were suited in
outer space.

I listened to AM radio with earphones and could tell by an audible whine
whether or not the camera was on, and where it was approximately located
(as if proprioception were not enough). The camera power-switch didn't
toggle; I needed the radio to inform me if the unit was ready. I listened
to the dentist; to the sound of the laser in my mouth; to the sound of the
machinery driving the laser; to WINS news; to the sound of the camera
through the radio.

I was in blue-white space, and in the awesome digital images all things
seem to float, from fiber-optic tools to white tissues with spots of
blood, from the face of the dentist hovering like a dream-mother in outer
space, to my own, fully covered, in an attitude of supplication. But above
all, the light itself floats, transforming the world of intimacy into that
of sterility, therapeutic, vacuum, and flesh, and I experienced the light
as a harbinger of the imaginary of the body itself. Someday the light
would free itself from surgery; someday it would carry emanations beyond
the holodeck into the real, a Jennifer-emanant leaning over Alan-emanant
with the full face of the world and all its shimmering beauty.

In the meantime, the blue-white green-white red-orange mouth gives birth
to, of all things, _the painless cure,_ as well as those fantasms recorded
by the camera, seeing all things, held behind and above the body and face
of the dentist, as if in supplication ...

untitled essay by Jennifer


when I'm lying on the bed, I get under the beige blanket with the cat and
we look at each other, and then I take my head out to read and I know the
cat is still under there looking at all the beautiful beige light and that
is all there is for the cat, that nice comfy world.

when the helicopter shows Yankee Stadium from the air you can see the va-
por trail from the helicopter engine and you know that the helicopter is
held high in the air by pure mechanism, where it feels the air all cuddly
around it, because it was designed for that cuddly air.

when I look through the amber plastic of the humidifier and see the warm
and happy slightly agitated water inside, I think what it must be like to
be suspended in that wonderful comfy water which is emptying into the air
to visit other places.

when I see my freshly-watered euphorbia in the window sill, I know they
will greet the early morning sun when I am still asleep, and begin their
busy photosynthesis, with only the cat looking on, all of them so cuddly
and happy in their early morning warmth.

when I watch the weather on television, I see a map of the world where you
are and I imagine a long tube from the cloud cover and rainy sky all the
way down into your bedroom where you lie sleeping, all comfy and cuddly.

when I put my bamboo-flute shakuhachi away after coating it lightly with
walnut oil, I think how safe and cuddly it is, in its lined case, wrapped
in cloth, with perfect humidity all around

when I think of myself, I think of me lazily spread out across all the
hard drives in the world, where you are reading this, slight magnetiza-
tions with emanant me hovering within your mind, and I think of myself,
all cuddly and comfy in your mind where I am lazily stretched out while
outside you are smiling at the world.

spank me on my luscious crack this broken head is going nowhere
spread my luscious cheek and spank me on my luscious hole
enter my luscious hole and clarify the luscious butter-theory
the luscious butter-theory tells me what is what in the world
the luscious butter-theory filters the world
i will enjoy my luscious hole filled with your luscious hole
i will enjoy the luscious butter-theory tattooed on my luscious crack
here is the luscious butter theory you will read on my luscious crack:
"There must be some reason for this."
that is the luscious butter theory which surrounds my luscious hole
now i will enjoy your spanking my luscious hole
now i will spread my luscious cheeks so you will have all of me
you read on the shiny wet rim of my luscious hole:
"Will you have my luscious world when you have all of me?"
spank me on my luscious crack this broken head is going nowhere
spread my luscious cheek and spank me on my luscious hole

what is telling me
that if I don't have excuse for this writing
that is good writing of very experimental sort
that if I don't go off limb of this very sort
that it will then be very bad writing
and you will know all about this very bad writing
so I make sure to take out word so that
you will know this very good experimental writing
of very very experimental sort
and so will be very good writing, what is telling me
so I will make excuse this every time of this writing
about the good writing because is very good experimental
or would not be so good so you will know
that always will be very good writing
because will be very good experimental writing
because will be good excuse, this very experimental
that would maybe be not so good if I do not go off limb
so you will know that I go off limb so to make
this very good experimental writing

do you know experimental writing
I do and this is very good of that writing

me, musing, narcissism

my writing doesn't proceed from the mastery of the text, but from burrow-
ing within it. nouns and adjectives appear as roughly horizontal strata,
verbs and adverbs as sheet lightnings. i can't see my way out of the fog.
i can't see my way into footnotes and bibliography. i can eat and breathe
and excrete the theory. there's something unwholesome about the theory,
about me, stained, tainted, ruined. i did an image: RUIN as if carved into
my breast. that is the fount and source of wisdom. but there's no mastery,
no series of definitive statements, the laying-out of the world. the world
isn't laid-out. i would have no place to stand. i can write from the desk,
but i'm writing within the desk, writing within the writing. this strips
me of authority. it's as if there's something wrong with me. it's as if
i'm blemished, carry an unidentifiable stigma, odor. i wear theorizing on
my back like an addiction. the drug carries me forth, stumbling across an
occasional reader, unidentified insight. it's hard to see clearly from
deep in the text, steeped in it, but it's the only site there is. what you
do and say filters through. if you press me hard enough, i can hear it.

it's not as if there's something wrong with me; there's something wrong
with me. it's not as if i'm blemished, carry an unidentifiable stigma,
odor; i'm blemished, carry an unidentifiable stigma, odor. i live within
the wood of the desk. i emerge; you see me covered with sawdust, half-
digested termites, egg casings. i nest in knotholes; count the rings and
you read me. saw me; i saw well.


__________________________________________________________________________


stain


stain - i'm born with it, witness to the caul
stigma - faint unidentifiable odor, you'd turn away, don't get close
blemish - i'm suppurating, can't control myself
defuge - you can sense i'm used up, always have been
sex - peripheral, disturbing on the periphery
unwholesome - shattered with torn edges, nothing fits into place
rootlessness - absence of place, nervous, pick my lips
rough-shod - defensive, can't see my way through my way, dirty
smudged - the glass distorts everything, there's nothing beyond it
smeared - almost obliterated, choked on filth, disheveled
obvious - it's obvious to everyone else but me
testimony - it's obvious to me through everyone else
stunted - i'm thwarted, can hardly speak, lost soul, helpless
helpless - i don't know i'm helpless, everyone wants me that way
fucked up - oh everyone thinks i'm that way
mess - everyone knows me that way
ill-mannered - i'm lost, isn't that obvious, outcast for good reason
dog, rat - they call me names of animals
marked - avoid me, cut out the heart, cauterize the voice, castrate
 the cock, amputate the limbs, gouge the eyes, devour the soul, kill
 the mind, pierce the ears, send the stump away, smear it

wow and then some.


boy, says Julu, boy oh boy oh boy. I've _got_ to make this more intense.
I've got to include something about _dismemberment._ "her limbs fell off."
that gave me more than a headache, wouldn't you know. abjection works too,
"her really stupid thing wrote." let's not forget the panties - that's
red-hot, a real hot-dog. "she sent her panties to Jennifer, who received
them graciously." then there's the question of the authorial voice, "Nik-
uko replied," and that's a real live wire, thought Julu.

breaking up (paragraphs) is hard to do, says Julu, trying to continue her
writing a-number-one. is this intense enough yet, oh mama. then something
about the wires. you're killing me, she thinks, baring herself "in bytes
and pixels." word, she thinks, thrusting her huge breasts into Jennifer's
face while Nikuko takes notes, and Julu says that takes care of sex and
the maternal function all at once. she says "a bird in her hand is worth
two in her bush" and "a stitch in mine saves thine." nice buildup, fantab-
ulous, Julu thinks. she needs a real raw ending for her with it text. Nik-
uko wounds her, top to bottom. my land says Julu. Nikuko spreads her
wounds, bottom to top. gracious sakes says Julu. Nikuko licks. lands alive
says Julu. Jennifer "says Julu," doesn't get any better than this. they go
out of their minds. don't forget I left the stains, thinks Julu, hot to
trot.

I write and rewrite into a winperl program, changing it, substituting

subsequent processing. Once the program is transformed, I run it, enter
sentences, bypassing the natural language of the questions. Run over and
over again, texts emerge. The texts are then modified, sutured, eliminat-
ing program artifacts. The program itself undergoes continuous rewrite in
relation to the texts. The program and the texts merge, diverge. I work
towards the unimaginable representations of the imaginary. I pull emanants
out from me, as if the body were wounded, as if ectoplasm were ascii. The
following represents the program run three times without entries:

::::
Your cancelling  is  my Pick

Your Mountain connects my  with Stream
of Stories
::::
 transforms Your  on Burning Creek...
Ah, My with  Levels and Blues!    :   :: : 
Devour earth  Brought Forth through     !
:  ::: 
Devour bodies   Brought Forth through !

Certain rhythms already appear, resonant phrases; think of this as haiku
substructure. In reality this is the gauge of the construct of Jennifer,
Nikuko, or Julu emanant. Recently, the Hermit of Burning Creek has been
thematically developed, Jennifer emerging as vapors. "It is as if I give
body to my dreams, dreams to my body." The current program, catalyst and
maternal function, follows:

There are legacies within it, artifacts from other (unix/linux) perl ver-
sions; sometimes the error messages lend themselves to the text; sometimes
the problems are easily corrected. I have left forking processes in place,
parent/child processes that spawn and delete CPU operations. The program
is quite simple, in a sense; there are for example no loops, just a con-
tinuous stuttering dialog.

Aw for Better, Aw for Worse


Some people are envious that I write every day, but believe me, it takes
its toll; I've been living with constant low-grade fever and fairly strong
headaches for months now. Occasionally something rises to the surface; I
then turn inward, sleeping twelve hours a day as a result of the stress
and possible depression. Well now. But then when I'm writing, when some-
thing seems to take over a series of texts, more than one alone - when a
series seems to be in the offing - when I'm shape-riding close to the bone
- it's then that I can feel close to total collapse, the text pushing out
through me, a terrible birth! I'm not exaggerating; those days, nothing
else happens in my life - it's as if the writing were incised on my chest
with all the pain so close to the heart, the brain releasing itself to the
language. Oh it's nothing compared to real physical labor or even the la-
bor of the classroom, but it can take its toll! And because of that, I
still, after all these years, write as if each text were my last, espec-
ially if I'm writing that series of texts. Oh I know, this sounds terribly
self-indulgent, given all the problems of the world - but we all live and
work alone, our nights at the heart of the brightest day. So I write and
think, yes, that's fine, that last one will do it - I think that at least
for the moment, and then something gnaws at me, and I'm off again, huddled
over the keyboard, pacing the loft, drinking coffee and pushing myself
until I'm falling apart, and the wounds begin all over again. I know if I
could stop, at least for a minute, I could see what I've actually done all
these years - but that seems unlikely; I'd trip over my fears, my death,
my very soul if that happened! "Be at rest, hidden, and do not move: what
comes, arrives by itself; what goes, departs by itself. Can you be one?
Can you stop?" (_Jing,_ trans. Yates.) Could anything be better? Could
anything be worse?
