

Iroiro


The weather began to turn around the beginning of November. I dreamed
of fire, sparks flying in the night across the wooden houses. We were
jammed against the cemetary, bad luck in any season; Hokusai's ghosts
spoke across hideous red lanterns, their teeth waiting for the skin to
fall. Fukuoka was ruptured by uneasy presences; the foreign community
talked and talked, waiting for something to happen. Rumblings from 
Eastern City penetrated Nine-States Island. These were the States at
that juncture:

State-of-Hand-Joined-to-the-Body
State-of-Being-Perfectly-Not-Here
State-of-Disconsolate-Thought-of-Wings
State-of-Hand-Not-Joined-to-the-Body
State-of-Beauty-Futon-Winter-Comfort
Electric-State-of-Coming-Wonders
State-of-Seeing-You-Around-About
Eighth-State-of-Fukuoka-City
State-of-Siege-of-Hardly-Kanji

Eastern City was in State-of-This-Main-Origin-of-Book, still spring, I
would say still April, the murmur of brook-larks heard high in Shinto
trees. For truth, I did not recognize talons where hands were joined,
words wired to electrical wonders not yet evidenced on the way from 
Kyoto to Fuji, by way of Wheat-Rice-Island. Thinking of wings, I flew,
these were my thoughts:

Winged Thoughts, Iron Thoughts, Fire Thoughts, Singed Thoughts, River-
Water Thoughts, Electric-Coming-Wonder-Thoughts.

There were seven flowers, six elements, perfect nights. In Northern-
Nine-State-City, it was autumn, late-blooming chrysanthemum engraved
on lacquer-bone poet-box, crane-flight, swimming-turtle careful gold
design. I would write wonder-haiku,

one two sorrow five
six mountain eight pine ten e-   x
leven twelve autumn four-      x
			     ox oo
and win honor at go-moku, xxxxx o  in summer-Kurume, waiting near Wide
Island, very many tower down to Nagasaki. For to be sure, I was fast
disappearing. I dreamed of fire, sparks flying in the night. I dreamed
of wooden houses. I dreamed of shogi sets, the sound of game pieces
scraped across the wooden boards.

I dreamed of the fluttering of go boards, the sound of stone-and-shell
game pieces scraped across the hollow tables. I dreamed of mother-of-
pearl orderings from Eastern City, dreamed of the Origin of All Things,
dreamed of State-of-Siege.

Clara in Fukuoka


Tall and stately Clara walks into the Darkroom.
Clara dominates the stage, Clara's eyes are samurai daggers.
Samurai have no daggers, pointed out by Travis glaring fiercely.
Travis moves to a corner of the room; he's nervous.
There are drinks falling off the edges of the tables.
There are drunks fucking off the edges of the tables.
Someone requests Hole again and again until the player breaks.
She reaches for a silver cigarette.
It's finely made mesh-of-an-afternoon good gaijin smoke.
Travis glares; he's high on thought and screaming.
Travis is screaming inside.
Here are the words of Travis' scream: Wah wa wa wa.
He turns slowly towards the door, careful avoidance of Clara-stiletto.
She moves.
She doesn't know what she's doing, fucked up on methamphet.
The light swings cause of an earthquake.
It's the biggest earthquake ever in Japan.
Sparks fly from the CD, Hole crashes to the floor.
Now or never.
Clara whips out dagger-stiletto, cuts his veins.
Before it's over in a blue moment.
Travis falls towards table-rim kanji-cut, you can read iroiro iraira.
Rim-job Travis topples as aftershock levels Fukuoka Tower.
Tower, baby, tower.
Everywhere in town sparks and wires down.
Crash-land Canal City flames cause of the earthquake.
Travis dead, Clara screams shampoo, here is what she screams:
Wah wa wa
Wah wa wa
Wah wa wa
Wah wa wa.

J---

Julu wanders Chiyo; it's night, there are dragonnes beyond
Ears of Buddha wings, there are sighs from jinja pond
You don't go beyond.
There are dark waves, valves, not fucking Hokusai sweet Hiroshige -
What gaijin know of art can't be placed on bamboo map
Or prefecture off it, the map where - how can I write mishap
Of Julu, what she found, crashed pottery - there was blood
Between the cracks (tan dust) from three thousand or more
Years of Jericho, but this was elsewhere, temple store,
Three squares for goods. She died. There were hoods
Down the street. They thought she was meat.

(From someone named Sarah Kanji)


there are three strokes to the river, two strokes to the man
there are three strokes to the number, one stroke to the wand
the man strikes a feather with the wand
the feather bends in the fifteen strokes of the wind
the feather bends in the sixteen strokes of the wind
wind cries, you don't hear me anymore
wind cries, you don't see me anymore
"there are three strokes to the river, two strokes to the man"
there are five strokes to the fire, seventeen strokes to the iron
and there are sixteen strokes to the mercury, seven to the plant
from which springs all things
and the man strokes the fire with iron, and the man springs
hard against the plant, there is one stroke to the woman,
"men are not all things or plants" and "a woman is writing"
"a woman is writing this" and the wind cries you don't
and the wind cries you don't
and the man flows like mercury
down the iron fire woman plant river
"the man flows like writing" 
there are four strokes to the mountain, feathered like the wind
and there are a number of wands

I'd rather be beautiful rather than nothing.
I'd rather be famous rather than nothing.
I'd prefer to have a lot of energy instead of being weak and onerous.
Why am I beautiful rather than otherwise?
Why am I famous, rather than a relative non-entity?
Why do I have heaps of energy, rather than collapsing?
I'd rather be alive than dead.
Why am I alive, rather than dead.
I'd prefer to be alive, rather than nothing.
Why am I living, instead of non-living?
Why am I this configuration of matter, rather than another?
I am this configuration writing these words, instead of any other.
I'd prefer to be this configuration, rather than nothing.
(Why am I near the end of the human, rather than near the beginning?
Why are there so many writings near the end of the human?
I'd rather be beautiful, rather than near the end of the human.
Near the end of the human, I'd rather be writing.)

My Mythology, by Nikuko


The earth was formed from a swelling that began out of a primordial
germ and split, separating dust from effluvia, debris from stony
veins. From this, the kami emerged. Soon veins formed head-bands,
emptied of swollen lungs and brains. Some kami committed seppuku,
removing their tongues by means of pinchers forged from stony veins.
Thus were formed brains with their many channels of mizu. Ah, lovely
mizu! Transparent mizu! Tasteless mizu! Channels of mizu run down tiny
brain-cunts in skulls formed from stony veins. Thus were formed "chan-
nels." Inkan stamp the elbows of kami-heads; the stamps cry "Oh Holy
Mother Let Us Have Necks And Shoulders." Thus did necks and shoulders
form. Some kami have arms on shoulders on necks on heads. They are
meat-girls, Nikukos swelling into split germs and stony veins. They
are angry girls! They are Buffalo Daughter, whose New Rock release is
on Toshiba-EMI Limited, a blend of techno and industrial voice-over
somewhat reminiscent of Big Stick, first heard at Rhino Records in Los
Angeles (as usual, their lead singer died). Buffalo Daughter appears
courtesy of Chameleon Records in Fukuoka, punk-animals everywhere or
rather can you dance as the voice goes _way behind_ the back-beat.
Meanwhile, in the Nihongi, Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto say
"Why should we not produce someone who shall be lord of the universe?"
- an off-handed remark leading to much future woe. One can only imag-
ine. "Universe" is given as "tenka" in a footnote, now meaning "the
whole country; the public; the reins of government." Either a bring-
down (EFL students wa take-note of the idiom) or hubris, from The New
Crown Japanese-English Dictionary. What happens in the tenka? I don't
know, but return to Nikuko's story, for her promising anger which
spread like a virus from Nikukos-coalescing with trunks and legs,
breasts and wombs, fierce warriors who have heard of Greece and Mon-
ique Wittig. They come across a hermit in a cave, another kami in
disguise, since there are Nikukos-One and kami, and that's all. They
show him their cunts, ask for sake; they drink much, push the stick
through his cloth, and that is all there is to it. Shite, lead char-
acter in a Noh play, he begins to sing, Wa! (Harmony!) Waa! (Hurray!)
He's _it,_ goaded by the _waki,_ Nikuko-who-does-not-wear-a-mask. Wa!
Waa! Yugen, mystery-depth-profound-subtle-aesthetic, emerges among the
kami, a beat magazine in New York 1950s, edited by Leroi Jones, if
memory serves me. "It runs fine when I'm here," sing Buffalo Daughter,
thinking of Nikuko. Shite-hermit sings and sings, stick poking
through. Thus was born "song," "Noh," and "penis." In revenge, Shite-
hermit says, "Nikuko, you cannot be in Noh." No-Noh-Nikuko. She sews
him back up in the cave. (Was he sewn at first? Whose cave? Was that
Nikuko's? Nikuko's cave - thus was born possession. Buffalo Daughter
change to swing-beat. The synthesizers wind down. Anyway, they make
the Sun-Goddess, called Oho-hiru-me no muchi, although Ama-terasu no
Oho kami and Ama-terasu-oho-hiru-me no Mikoto are cited as well. Ni-
kuko takes pity; the earth is kami, too. So are Buffalo Daughter, who
are auspicious; the hermit, who receives the penis; the waki, helping
everyone. Now everyone has all limbs and bodies but the penises and
wombs are equally divided. When a war comes, Nikuko-who-does-not-wear-
a-mask, and is a dark-haired girl living near Nakasu, gets angry, and
says, there is no kami for any of us, and there are many less penises
perhaps at first, and then less wombs. When the earth swells, there is
an earthquake and caves are swallowed in the earth. Sesshu's Long
Landscape Scroll portrays this incident of Nikuko and hermit, and, as
if in despair and irony, there is earthquake also, destroying the
earth shrine at Hakata, until its memory faded from the affairs of men
and women. (Some men and women are born without arms or legs; some
without brains; some without breasts or wombs; some without penises;
some without heads; some without skulls or necks; and some without
shoulders.)

---------------

Mizu, water; Nikuko, meat-girl; seppuku, suicide; shite, hero or hero-
ine in Noh play, primary actor (wears a mask); waki, secondary actor,
(maskless) in the same; Buffalo Daughter, playing now; kami, deity/
spirit of sorts; inkan, signature-stamp; Sesshu painted primarily in
the 15th century; head-bands are often worn by workmen in Japan; Rhi-
no Records was (and maybe is) the best alternative music store I've
seen in America. The last copy of Yugen was going for $10 a few
months ago on the Lower East Side. Big Stick has disbanded. The
Sun-Goddess names are from Aston's translation of the Nihongi. Monique
Wittig wrote The Lesbian Body among other works. Nakasu is the
snack-bar district of Fukuoka. Noh is a form of Japanese medieval
theater; there are translations by Waley, but the intensity of tele-
vised Noh was completely unexpected. I live in Hakata-Ku, Hakata Ward,
which is the merchant's town of Fukuoka. I have no brain or skull.
Aston translates the Sun-Goddess' names as "Great-noon-female-of-pos-
sessor"; "Heaven-illumine-of-great-deity"; and "Heaven-illumine-great-
noon-female-of-augustness"; but then Aston was writing in the nine-
teenth century.

No Play


<The curtain rises. Nikuko and American boy on stage.>

Nikuko speaks (kabuki voice throughout):

"I, Nikuko, do beg you to sew my eyes shut!
Oh, I have not seen so much horror in world!
But, I, Nikuko, want to experience total bliss!
I want to do one-man sumo with fearsome opponents!
I will fight me in blackness of invisible enemies!
I will fight police throwing me in filthy cell!
Do you like elimination of "a" "the" articles now such?
Do wrap me in kimono-cloth, strangle in transparent tape!
I will know ecstasy! Then I will bring "you" ecstasy!
I will make "you" verb in my vagina! 
Do you like forbidden pleasure? Jewel-Lotus-Magatama-Pleasure?
You will have rope through labia to pull my deep joy-suffering!
You will have me, do you like Oriental face?
Deep cast of eyes wide open for your english-teaching insert!
Where you are from, they have automobiles! I so like to drive!
Oh deep American boy, I will make you drive in my vagina!
I do like overdrive-gear-shift-nitro-burn as well!
I will do one-man sumo with fearsome opportunities!"

<Gas floods the stage; American boy dies, vomiting. Nikuko staggers
to her feet, takes off her mask. She is a woman of thirty-five. She
is carrying a dagger. She turns and faces the audience. She screams
"MU!" The curtain falls.>
