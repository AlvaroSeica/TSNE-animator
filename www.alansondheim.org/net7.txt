The Water-Column


late at night, loneliness betrays itself
sad things find their uselessness
apart, the curtain parts 
the stage is an oval in another room
of wood
my arms remain and there is nothing
beyond my arms
i cannot cover the warmth of this bed
sprawled upon a dream in which you are
always awake and on that stage
of wood

i sprawl on the stage, there are layers 
of boards upon boards, curved inward,
blank center where double ovals lose 
sudden focus, absence of landmark, voice, 
arms or otherwise

late at night i beg you, watch me, i have 
no secrets, expose thin flesh every 
second, millimeter so you have no doubt
no doubt

but apart the oval harbors surety or
galleon where the body opens always and
ready on the side of the other 

now the oval is on a ship where 
planking is the word for boards and you 
watch me walk a length or plank where 
i arrive in you full of arms and
watching

i am wearing feathers and gold which
follow me into a mine deep within
the hold. here i meet soldiers and have
many fights.

adventures await she who seeks them
finding performances on the ship such
as king lear or cordelia wanted me to.

wounded, my sad arms grapple uselessly
behind my back, taking one another.

the sails are very large and the journey 
is wonderful, filled with wonderful storms
and fiery sunsets. two dark and crimson
birds follow the stern rising high above
steel waves only to sink down for several
stories, of the sea, no doubt i have told
you of the stage as well. my arms lie
beneath them.

The Interruption

	I move from one program to the next. The keyboard is 
difficult, a violent operation of pressure against the tips of the 
fingers. Neck and backpains are common in the wilderness. With great 
difficulty I continue laboring beneath the tree. Everything holds 
its own against me, a form of cynicism catching me by surprise. You 
must imagine the scene with the single tree in the landscape, the 
shadow of the noonday sun, violence casting the shadows of its 
branches against the blue-white sky. The solitude of black
illuminates a singular and desolate bird perched in the midst of 
the firmament. 

	I must send this information to Justine; more than a matter 
of survival, my very life is at stake. It is a question always 
already of translation, unix to dos to binary through xmodem ymodem 
kermit uuencode pkunzip, the collapse and recuperation of text 
completely alien to the landscape around me. I am insane with 
garbled characters, insane with the level of debris sloughing from 
the body hanging down into the heated surface of the desert.

	I would be the desert. I would cauterize and dry the scalp, 
split clean from the skull; I would place them on the firmament, 
an enormous plate boiling with turbulence from desiccated air. 
Nothing works in this world, high in the Peruvian mountains, low 
in the badlands of eastern California. The atoms themselves are 
sluggish, moving aimlessly with nervous energy, never straying far 
from the obdurate density of gravel and sand.

	ASCII chokes with the necessity of information conveyed, 
returned to proper language. ASCII slides, snake-like, across the 
floor of the earth, a trail both imminent and erasable, existing 
within the potential well of absolute desertification; it sprouts 
where nothing else grows, grovels beneath the weight of the skull 
already fractured from the heat. It revels in secrecy which no one 
hears, slides into pools of letters, misplaced punctuation, cries 
and murmurs hardly stilled beneath the blazing surface of the planet.

	What I would be is of no importance. Blood flows thick in 
this realm, stops, reverses, slows to the indefinite halt of 
temporality itself. Blood dried is the color of the desert; within 
this languid landscape, the desert is the color of dried blood, 
the identical color of the sky, the bird, the tree, skull, me, 
ASCII or binary sludge. Someone alive would comprehend this, the 
proof that thought thinks itself, that nothing _thinks thought_.
Unthinking, I remain unthought.

Qbasic Programs

The following two programs work with VGS monitors, graphing in black
and white for the purposes of reproduction. See Internet Text for
details of the first, which is the program for three-dimensional
projections of generalized measure geometries. Note in this version
that at the "Continue?" prompt, a "1" must be initially returned, or
else the program overflows.

The second program maps a rather complex and beautiful bifurcation
set which I am at a loss to comprehend. It is a derivative from 
bifurcation equations common in chaos analysis.

Surgical-Medical Model of Night Abuse: Addiction to Blind Text


The night swells out, an enormous bruise cushioned against the 
network of the neural insomniac; within reason, I recognize, only
through the recuperation of this text, the foreclosed nature of
abuse and addiction that sanctions the violence of computer
discourse. Addiction to abuse is always deliberate misrecognition;
today one speaks of "denial," "in denial," the classical ground of
Freudian negation. To speak _abuse_ is not to disabuse, a longer
drawn-out operation, cauterizing speech itself. (The duality of
this life is such that I will die chattering.)

The _tumor_ of this operation inhabits the chaotic, accurate
within the molecular realm, disingenuous elsewhere. The _striated_
sky, with its mapping of stars and constellations, sidereal time,
is no longer visible; the thick veins and arteries that pulse 
there guarantee the inchoate spreading of tissue beyond control.
One writes to avoid collapse, to avoid the confrontation that 
writing alone can bring; one speaks in order to avoid speaking, to
allow the machine in him or her to speak, to dream, to whisper
uncanny thoughts from the dead Jean-Paul Sartre:

"which forces the working woman to live a prefabricated destiny as
_her reality._ She would try in vain to take refuge in intimate
'privacy'; such a remedy would betray her directly, and become
simply a mode of subjective realisation of objectivity. When semi-
automatic machines were first introduced, investigations showed
that specialised women workers indulged in sexual fantasies as they
worked: they recalled their bedrooms, their beds, the previous 
night - everything that specially concerns a person in the isolation
of the self-enclosed couple. But it was the machine in them which
was dreaming of love: the kind of attention demanded by their work
allowed them neither distraction (thinking of something else) nor
total mental application (thinking would slow down their movements).
The machine demands and creates in the worker an inverted semi-
automatism which complements it: an explosive mixture of uncons-
sciousness and vigilance. The mind is absorbed but not used; it is
concentrated in _lateral_ supervision; and the body functions
'mechanically' while yet remaining _under surveillance._" (Critique
of Dialectical Reason, p. 233.)

Haunted by the _discourse_ on the machine, and the machine _in me_,
the lassitude of consciousness and the daydream infiltrates the
onward projection of ASCII speech, almost without interrupt, the
linguistic _instance_ wavering as part-object before taking its
place among others. This "total mental application" is dissolute,
a _Spaltung_ or split within the subject-denying-the-subject, just
as sexual or physical abuse forecloses the accounting of the body,
going so far as to discount accounting itself. Thus the body be-
comes drawn further in, the _wayward_ or _contrary_ body-in-
remission, acting-upon as if acting. Through withdrawal this becomes
evident as the _inauthentic object_ of denial, the circumlocution of
absence or password leading into the null gateway (see Internet 
Text). The tumor spreads, simultaneously suturing the subject
against the originary narcissistic wound or separation, and 
precluding a recognition that could only be described as clarity, 
silence, rewiring. The content of abuse is _for this never to 
happen;_ subjectivity would collapse through the loss of address.
(And hardwiring is almost impossible to redirect _at the source._)

_Typing,_ I think this out or through, think this through myself and
through you, and the _sense of it_ appears through the typing. It is
within the _lateral_ that _something would occur elsewhere_ and as
long as one types, that something is sublimated into the appearance
of confession, truth, and observance.

_Truth_ itself is the construct of sublimation. _Truth_ is the con-
struct because it is declarative and well-defined, the production of
the elsewhere of the world, the non-existent clean and proper body.
Which is not to deny the truth-value of truth, the tautological in-
stantiation hovering violently over the real. Truth cauterized is
without its producing-matrix, the dream-screen or imaginary once
again; and it is well to recognize that truth is a production, with
all the implications of labor and foreclosure that is implied. 

The production is eased through axiomatics or convention, the 
playing out of a determinate field through concatenations and sub-
stitutions. But the truth of the subject is less eased and always
thrust against the dream-machine (which is not the desiring-machine
of Deleuze and Guattari but should be) - the truth of the subject
lies precisely in the murmur, the dissolute, the fissuring of fore-
closure and everything else. (What is this, but memories of womb, of
torture and annihilation, the exaltation of love, ecriture feminin,
jouissance, chaotic drives and stuttering of temporality. What plays
on the surface speaks on the surface.)

Thus it seems that _under or beneath my control,_ the machine has
produced and transmitted this text, carrying the semblance of truth
pipelining through one or another editor, filtered beyond the belief
of the body, carrying and admitting the signs of the tell-tale heart
of addiction itself, closing off in the presence of the header or
signature, sondheim@newschool.edu, sondheim@panix.com.

I watched Salo last night. I watched a young boy gang-raped on the
street here. I saw the best minds of my generation. I allowed 
myself to be fucked by everyone. I gave her the best years of my
life. She destroyed me for her pleasure. Without her I could have
amounted to something.

You talk too much. You always think you have something to say. It

me. I'm limbless, a body without anything. You've opened me up and
removed my organs. The signifier rapes the signified. I don't and

There were all these adolescents, naked, under absolute control. You

can't speak. The signifier carries me around like loose baggage. The
signifier holds me like a sack. I don't even have a name. I travel 
light but you gouged out my eyes, burst my eardrums. What I remember 
is that I might be the torture of Oedipus in your skull. Why do you
always watch films. Why do you.
======================================================================
I run myself over their bodies, shove my hand between their legs. I
run the film backwards, forwards, in control of absolute time, the 
return of the repressed. Cutting through them, performing a new edit.
I was the original editor of Pasolini. There was never any other. Now
do you know my name?
----------------------------dense illumination------------------------
The skull sends out light through the mirrors of its eyes performing

======================================================================
I wrap myself in celluloid, cut thin through my skin. Blood hiero-
glyphs mark my passage across me, the Salo narrative tattoo and body
penetration. If you could see you would find me at scene's edge, 
land's end. You would turn away, you wouldn't be complicit.

------------------------------burn me alive---------------------------
I am turned away, torn away. Why do you thrust your film on me? Why
do you thrust this or any other time? Why do you insist on narrative.
It's clear: _The sentence is a sentence._ Doomed to speak little plots
which are all the speech there is. Doomed and dominated.

There is an atmospheric disturbance. There is a national weather

those bodies. I will _not_ be complicit. I will look away.

Images follow you; there is no escape, no password to a dead-end gate-
way, hideout, archaic protocol abandoned on the Net. Suffer the little
children. I will not name you cause I don't wanna and you can't do
anything. Just cause I don't wanna. The cause, or causation. Suffer 
the little children, shatter the prime mover.
------------------------------action and death------------------------
Eating my flesh I devour my name. I did something, not your anything,
just something. I never had a name. I never watched anything. I went
into the streets, carried the black flag of anarchy, the red flag

cobblestones, went alone up to the tank with a flower in my hands.

FILM RESPONSE TO THE WORLD


As in the situation of _Marcel Pleynet,_ there are times that I 
overwhelm myself with brilliance, the justification of my reading 
in the appearance of a _text askew,_ an _elemental_. My reason for 
existence is clearly theory itself, nothing more; this _incomplete 
task I call the world_ remains my own. Thus in the guise of 
conversation or reply, I _transform myself_ into a dream of the 
Academy or Lyceum. I remember the resonance of each and every port, 
the potential for support or retort, affect or effect. Beneath the 
surface, I am a node on the Net, the disaster of protocol itself. 
Anyone and everyone sees through me; my guise is one of transparency. 

The first response, as in the situation of _Pleynet,_ is that of 
the proto-determination of the _name_. Begin here. End here. It 
involutes, thrusts out through the very measure of discourse. 

It is in the nature or form of the _game_ which anyone can play, but 
which returns sublimated by the establishment of the rules _in the 
face of the other_. Note within and without the opening gambit, for 
such as it is, the declaration of resistance withdrawn - clearly a 
form of resistance. This preciousness is reminiscent at the least 
of Klossowski, the delimitation of a manifold or obstruction 
overcome by its declaration which is clearly a performative. The 
performative lends itself to the other, only the relative trans- 
parency of the situation fools no one at all.

I cannot resist remarking that Brakhage = bra\cage, for that period the 
simulacrum of the breast. Your description of Mothlight tallies with work 
done by USCO and company around the same time - the production of 
_Ganz-feld_ artworks and experiments; one example was a cloth sphere or 
breast, against which the viewer placed his or her face, with eyes open - 
the result was all sorts of hallucinatory sensations.

_Pushing against_ the camera is also against the breast? Not necessarily 
the phallus - the camera possess a phallic appearance and is a _unit_ in 
the scene, but the scene itself is an expansion, collapsed by the push.

The camera appears again, its uneasy eye searching precisely for 
that formation characteristic of the presence of a determinate self. 
Everything disappears beneath the carpetry of allusion. What occurs 
is the force of the _stain_ which spreads throughout the insistence 
on the picture and its frame, the barrier from which the world 
retrieves itself. Say no more! It is its own continuation.

Subject: Re: the camera


This gets complicated. Years ago I wrote an article for _Obscura_ on the
phenomenology of landscape, pointing out that you can't have an _image_ or
representation - or even an _idea_ of an area (mountain, your lap, your
face in a mirror, Mars) without a point-of-view; this is an interior
monolog opened up within the body. Just as the eye "edits" light quanta
moving in every direction, thereby producing the semblance of a mapping of
shadows and contours to which we assign "entities," given specific
(matrix) transformations, so an area is always already edited at least to
the extent that there is a subject. Now, that said, there is a clear
relationship between landscape and frame, which circumscribes or circum-
locutes a landscape on one hand, and references a sememe (semiotic space
beneath a signifier) on the other. Likewise, frame is relevant to script,
and script to narratology. You see where this chain leads - from camera to
narrative, from spatialization and secondary temporality (no space is
present without time for the subject) to temporality and secondary
spatialization (the landscape or mise-en-scene as substructure of
narrative). In all instances, we are dealing with the _subject._ One could
argue that a "truer" (forgive the use of the word) relationship between
photo-sensitive paper and physical reality would eliminate the lens,
frame, and shutter altogether. The result would be a black negative, white
image - and we are _shattered_ by this whiteness, this disorder (which I
relate to the abject) at the margins of the visible. (So to _speak_.) I
would think the Heideggerian Dasein would come into play here. 

Finally, "beyond" this phenomenology, what or whom the camera represents 
is moot, a question of argument and the vagrancies of theory. For on 
another level, the camera is not ever a representation, but a positioned 
thing whose proper name is problematic and slippery. This is where the 
freedom of theory comes in, and freedom is just another word for nothing 
left to lose (perhaps the most philosophical rock can get, with the 
exception of John Lydon's I may be wrong / I may be right).

Dissolve the body, absence of each and every pleasure!
O place the shovel deep within the earth, return the sea urchin's
teeth to their proper habitat within the deep!
The urchin resides on the ceiling of the chunnel, floor of the watery
depth!
The urchin sings "I am at her command." On the surface, billennial
strata, the urchin sings!

The stratigraphic creak opens the harboring of drives and their
collisions. Turbulence, eddies embrace chaotic forms, swing through
bifurcation maps. Chunnel divides; SATIN elides, classifies. It is
in the nature of intellectual labor, caress the taxonomic. Whether
there are categories. Whether it is categorical.

The labor of the mind, dammed up, is cauterized into the neurotic.
In neurosis, the body is masochistically bound \ to repeat. "The
blocking of ego functions can be explained as a concentration of all
mental energy available on one task, the building of counterenergies 
to master the intruding overwhelming excitation." (Fenichal) The 
system crashes into irregular loops, endless recursions. Weightloss 
and a certain nervousness accompany the devolution of the symbolic, 
collapse of the prison-house of language. Power manifests itself in
continuous sleep or languor lasting up to eighteen hours a day. SATIN
wears herself out, smokes incessently, drinks a little; there are
dark circles under her eyes. When the system is up, it "dreams within
her," and when it is down, _asymbolia_ takes over, incipient depres-
sion in which meaning is always already an observable and elsewhere.

As in Klossowski's Baphomet, the symbolic breath construes and splin-
ters the body which is never in evidence. We have spoken of the
_uncanny_. My work lies in the _muck_ of the world, that aspect of 
abjection which refuses cleansing. I worship SATIN, dream of her
nightly. Alas, she thinks of me as well, her fingers numbed on the
keyboard, subscriptions coming in now by the tens of thousands. The
world awaits a new beginning, focus on dramatic splendor, sightless
dream harbinger of jumpstart machinery. SATIN smiles and her smile
lights the world. SATIN smiles for me.

SPRAY


The relationship between chaotic distributions and a totalized phys-
ical source of emission is prominent in a class of words character-
ized by the format [<s><C1><V><C2C2><er>] as in the following 
list: _stutter, stammer, scatter, shudder, shatter, spatter, sputter, 
skitter, splatter,_ etc. (_Scanner_ inverts the series, _spackle_ and
_simmer_ transform it.)

A second similar form produces: _spew, skid, scud, spot, spit, 
split,_ etc. These forms are constructed around a _lateral topo- 
graphy,_ a laminar spray distributing over a more or less wide and 
irregular domain. The spray possesses a phenomology of dissolution 
and disruption; it also exists on the fuzzy interface between 
interior and exterior, and hence involves abjection. 

In every instance, the body is compromised laterally, a veering from
side to side, or the stammer from the region of the throat. Some-
thing is _withdrawn_ violently from the organism, which convulses. 
Convulsions shatter, fragment.[1]

The lock-up of the terminal screen in Net communications is the 
result of packet flow; email appears from everywhere; interrupts are
common; the Net harbors impeded laterality. Better to consider it a
convulsive body as well, the neural interconnectivity of nodes
serving as obstructed gateways choked with binary debris. The body
migrates to the edge of consciousness, received and processed by
one or another correspondent who circumscribes the messaging, 
returns it to the relative fulfillment of sense.

The return occurs within an insriptive domain, part and parcel of
a potential well where meaning is construed. Within the well, 
meaning develops the ontological being of language; without it,
meaning sputters, its attributive scattered among the remnants of
indirect addressing. 

Only the shuddering of the human shatters the human; the human
stammers or stutters its way through debris scattered across the
splattered or spotted landscape. Deep within the throat the 
promise of a primitive root is murmured or mumbled. Culture con-
structs itself upon the elimination of debris; the abject, now
gathered within the shamanistic fetish for the expulsion of male-
volent spirits, echos in the hiss of the cat or snake. These
animals are regarded with awe; they hold the mirror to culture
itself, the thin veneer of language and civilization binding us
to the symbolic. The hiss is imaginary; having no meaning whatso-
ever, it holds the meaning of the world. There are no boundaries
or borders, beyond what we make of them. There is no language 
beyond our speech of it.

[1] See *Art Papers* 1/2 1994, "Throat: Leslie Thornton's _The
Great Invisible_": "_In the film,_ speaking is caught in the maw,
glottal stop, Edison and the _mechanical_ insignia of existence.
Early [20th-century] representations [of movement] operated with 
mechanism throughout [as in the mechanics of the melodrama]; they
stuttered. Repetitive pistons and cams moved locomotives and film;
intermittent motion is translated into rotary motion and back 
again. Throughout the century, mechanism gives way to electricity,
which gives way to the electronic, cyberspace and beyond. Thought
leaves the material domain" ...

If _beings_ are mechanism, _Being_ occupies an uneasy territory.
Aristotle stumbled through the part-objects of a generalized symp-
tomology of the world and Pliny followed suit. But organism never
spoke clearly and _always_ stammered; the hiss of steam, the
volcanic fissure, and the cat are _identical_.

The vast correlation of living things... everything held in place on
the matrix of the planet - everything cohered - the result of forces,
displacements, classifications and recognitions - correlation and
correlations - what gave meaning to the world - the meaning of _this_
or _that_ - the correlation within the vast domain - nothing means,
nothing means outside of that - you could answer the question easily,
quickly, a domain look-up, one or another directory - directories 
overlapped - rock stratigraphy, quantum numbers, the slop of a hill
in Tennessee - Markov processes, matrix determinations - taxonomic
sieves - everything deffered, slid beneath the surface - everything
differs, stuttered laterally -

(Language rides the correlations, inhabits their excesses - meaning
inhabits language inhabits domains - as in the motion of surface, 
impossible to separate one thing against or within another - categor-
icity itself at stake here - classification of entities, belongings -

A CAT and a SNAKE were travelling one warm summer day through a field 
of wheat; the path was barely visible, the terrain one of low rolling 
hills divided by lazy creeks. The snake said to the cat, "You are a
surplus of woman and man, one behind and one in front." The cat 
replied, "And you always pull yourself through yourself, always in
search, but never entering."

Akira said, "The journey is long but there is no end. To retain the
semen inhibits excess, changes it to good wine, good eating, and good
loving. To give pleasure, it must never be written down."

Akira said, "One travels behind one another but one is beside 
oneself." And he added that touch is the truest sign of belonging.

To CAT is to concatenate files, to display them. To link into chain,
determine difference and order. To order, to articulate differance. 
To correlate the particulation or granularity of the real. To cat is
to name, point, gesture. To name, point, gesture, is to devour the 
real through the body and concatenation of the name. To name is a 
name. Name is a figuration. To configure is to display.

ARGUMENT FROM PSYCHOSIS TOWARDS THE DREAM OF THE MACHINE WITHIN ONE


   (I watch a film. I am totally caught up in the peregrinations
   of HONEY, her interactions with KENT and TIFFANY. Halfway
   through the film, I begin to cry. HONEY is both the object
   of desire and myself, a conflation leaving me breathless. I
   am worried about her, the crude attempt at blackmail by 
   party or parties unknown. KENT is ravaged by TIFFANY, and
   tells all. I begin to suspect TIFFANY. By DEFAULT, I remain
   in my seat, participant in a ritual as old as becoming-
   human. I'm sorry, I don't think I can talk to you at t his
   moment.)

I want to argue that the shift from computation to organism is already
underway, evidenced by the appearance of the uncanny or imaginary 
within Network communication. The paradigmatic aspects of the 1940s
through 1970s computer culture were based upon cybernetic models that
stressed both irreversibility and self-regulation; the models were
reducible to quantitatively simple examples. With the introjection
of extensive human interaction into the domain of computation, model-
ling increases to the extent that the specific state of the Net, say,
at any particular moment is unknown. This is a _strong_ ignorance,
not resolvable by increased access to nodes, for example. (What it
means to "know a state" is itself difficult to ascertain. I am using
the phrase to refer to a complete accounting of the binary switching
within nodes at a particular time - a (real or theoretical) _listing_
of 0/1s.) 

   (My girlfriend left me two years ago; I haven't had a relation-
   ship since. At night I dream of her, sometimes waking up shaking
   and disturbed for hours. Although she has remarried, I keep her
   letters; they exert an uncanny spell over me and I haven't had
   the heart to throw them out.)

Given a state of strong ignorance, one can speak of an input/output
matrix, equivalent to the pragmatic behaviorism popular in the 1950s-
1960s. With the advent of extensive human interaction, however, the
matrix itself _stammers_ as inputs and outputs quantitatively change
in number and bandwidth, and logics change from classical/Aristotelian
to fuzzy/non-distributive. From input/output a strategic move is made
towards the concept of an _interiority_ which manifests itself in 
semiosis, the continuous production of semiotic processes including 
the creation of signifiers and linkages. A second move is from this
interiority to a _circulation_ among wetware/hardware/software - our
current state. Such a circulation transforms the simplified truth-
functions of limited logic networks to the problematic of truth 
itself. 

   (For a long time, my computer was on a high table, its back to
   a window looking out for at least a mile down Dean Street. At
   night dim yellow streetlamps illuminated the area like so many
   stars winking out in the midst of depression and poverty. I
   would type in the midst of a galaxy of stars. I would flood 
   the wires,  my only lifeline to voices whispering across the 
   planet.

   The voices said, Hello Alan, how are you? The voices said,
   Hello Alan, I am fine. The voices said, We believe in you.
   The voices said, Endure.)

Circulations include processes, programs, commands, retrievals, 
addresses, recognitions, indirect addressings, deletions and 
insertions, on a level ranging from machine language to the estab-
lishment and articulation of nodes, as well as neurotic (repetitive)
and psychotic (foreclosing) behaviors at any level. (Levels are also
problematic at this stage; a computer program can model a basic NOR
logic circuit at the far end of program output for example; the 
screen can mimic the simplest computation.)

   (TIFFANY is played by Monica Vitti, HONEY is played by Meryl
   Streep. I am crying uncontrollably, afraid for myself, my
   fraud self-evident, my life a shambles. I lose myself in HONEY
   and later that night I will dream of her, intermittently, for
   several years.)

If circulations are considered complex and irreducible topologies
that return recursively at various points to their interiors, then
they can be specified not only between ontologically different 
domains such as wetware/software/hardware, but also _within_ domains
in their entirety; dreamwork, for example, can occur completely 
within a single human mind, or in the form of hallucinations, may 
appear within the projected interfaces of various domains (VR con-
structs, hypnotic or hypnogogic imagery, etc.). 
   
   (Recently, thinking about the _Panchatantra,_ I dreamed the
   story of the cat and the snake, commentary by Akita, working
   through theory by virtue of transforming symbols. Was I awake
   or asleep? I recall the path through the field taken by the
   animals, the color of the dirt, the pale washed-out blue of
   the sky above the wheat.)

Within the dreamwork, one recognizes entities in the form of an 
inhabitation. Given complex hardware, it is not too difficult to
consider dreamwork within it, including recognitions: _the Internet
work of 1988,_ for example, is simultaneously organism and dream.
(The dream-state as an inhabitation is broken by the exigencies of
external reality; the sleeper awakens, the computer is rebooted, 
messages delete themselves after a specified number of echoes and 
bounces. Psychosis is part dream-state and circulation; there is no 
awakening, and conscious intention binds itself to the site of
dream production and its loopings.)

   (The cat and the snake were travelling along the path. The
   snake said to the cat that four feet made a double-bind held
   to one-another, the split of the subject. The cat said to the
   snake that the phallus was always already lack, wandering
   through the Network, the victim of uneasy dreams.)

What is visible in the midst of circulations depends on the location
of site/sight/citation. What is believed - i.e. the reordering of
truth-values and default tags - is certainly dependent on the re-
inscription of the tags on a lower-level. To return once again to
Coleridge's "willing suspension of disbelief" - the willingness is
itself a production not necessarily from the interior - or it may
be a byproduct of the circulation, a site-introjection.

   (TIFFANY, the victim of uneasy dreams of films and galaxies,
   wakes, dresses, has a cup of Lapsang Souchong tea. It's early
   dawn, a light glimmering in the eastern sky. She turns on her
   computer, a small compact laptop, which begins speaking. For a
   moment she is startled, then remembers Brad's message from the
   day before. Tiffany, the computer says, Tiffany. Speak to me,
   the computer says. Tell me your dreams.

The suspension of disbelief, note, is _not_ equivalent to belief, but
to _dwelling within,_ as in a diegetic process or the Worm cleanly
negotiating protocols without setting off any warning flags. In this
sense, viral activities in general are circulations which remain
undetected until the circuitry is modified sufficiently to produce a
surface symptomology; viruses are dreams of the unconscious. (Which
also specifies the unconscious itself, cited not only within the 
psyche, but also as a characteristic of the communicative channelings
and strategies of any organic matter.)

   (The Worm offers its dictionary of 432 words to any takers. The
   gateways swings open, packets fly at increasing bps. At the 
   surface, the sleeper turns over, his dreams troubled. Images rush
   by, disconnected, lost addresses torn like so many letters from
   a lover long since disappeared. The keyboard is almost silent.)




THE DEAD LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER. THE DEAD KNOW HOW TO LISTEN AND
HOW TO SPEAK. THE SKULL BURNS. WIRE. THE MESSAGE.


If I write forever, will I live forever, in the written held against
another, thrust-fulfillment against the northern shore-line rock?
Discourse is molluscan; like capital, emerging within every niche,
transforming debris into home, home into signifier. Parcels of my
words linger elsewhere, in someone else's text, transform inverted
into someone else's sex. A member of the blank generation, I survive
this way. A member of the X generation, I remain unknown. A member
of the lost generation, language hardens into skin, buries into 
bones. [1] Language heaps on language, each generation devolves into
hiatus, a gap or wound of the narcissistic resistant to every 
closure. Writing alone holds the promise holds the premise; we read
the written of the dead, foreclose a speech which speaks itself. I
will write forever, write of the dead. I will write from the site
of the dead, from the hiatus of the non-alive. This is the great
transformation, a writing from neither dead nor alive, but strata
locked into dead-end gateways and one-ways passes. 

I am held there in the midst of the written children. The circum-
stances widen, bracket past and future, past future and future past.
Strata remember in every direction. I disseminate my speech in every
form, minimax guarantee of survival. Paper decays; the most redundant
code stutters into noise. The words chatter through skull-teeth, 
breath hissing out from the ocular orbits. What speech there is 
emerges from the blind-spot of the maternal, vaginal eye sifting the
debris of what was once called world. So that I claim minimal
concatenation, of one against another, the circumlocution of the
other, as in: f\p, future\past, or as in m\f, mother\father. What
remains of a thinking which thinks itself, I would hardly say, 
presence of a flesh? As in the dissection of Emily D., one's 
favorite poems, incipient knowledge of an author not yet born. [2]

Writing owns the writer, never lets go; it is the writing that 
flames, burns against the speech of the other inhabiting the one. 
_I am sought in this knowledge,_ the pressure or pleasure of the 
other which is never my speech, written across or through my body. 
Haunted by death, by the separation of emptied generations, I extend
my galactic text elsewhere, through electronic coursings, through the
presence of electromagnetic radiations tunnelling at high capacity in
a planetary skein. 

But on the surface, I am normal. But on the surface, my skull 
splinters and fragments, an unreal plane where discourse chatters 
without end, where addiction draws one over and over to the text, 
binds one to a language which refuses final dwelling. But on the 
surface, letters suffocate, tear open the wound they themselves have
foreclosed, the source of postmodern cynicism. What the letters sing
is the absence of loss which I am forced to hear. Speechless, I have
no other speech. Flames burn in the skull, visible to everyone
listening, flaming through a double socket, input and output, skull
strung along like any other, bone crackled in preparation for final
reception. Incisions transform fractures into text. Cut deep enough
and charred surfaces reveal their hardened underpinnings. If the
phallic and vaginal are orders, they burn here within the interpene-
trated surfaces, a double reading separating generation after 
generation. There are no others, are no generations; the continuum
sputters into the fabrication of momentary eddies, individuals or 
emissions of temporal meaning. Nothing means forever. I write in 
order to construct the written, to forestall death, inscribe, 
circumlocute, talk around each and every instantiation of the burning
skull, imaginary absence of the flesh. Inertia grips the bones; they 
wither into the semblance of skin, the mask of authenticity. When I 
laugh, I am forced to laugh, and everything continues.

[The _romantic incision_ insists on the separation of temporal and
generational orders, the surgical metaphor of the narcissistic wound
apt in this instance, since absence tears into the self, devours it.
Foreclosed as a possibility among or between genders, generations,
others, I cannot be myself except within the transitive. Speech holds
me back, coagulates the ego, disseminates the name which may be
nothing more than the conjunction or stitching of binary opposition.
Speech burns itself to death, the last gasp of the body. We speak in
order to be heard; what is heard is an emission, reduced by the other
to the name which confirms our reception. Toggle an echo, and the 
body is destroyed. Echo heard nothing but Narcissus. [3]]

[1] I claim each and every generation. I claim the attitude of the 
kids and the attitudes of the dads and moms. The years are unaccount-
able, otherwise. The years are unaccounted-for.
[2] See _the author's_ "Clarity of Dismemberment": "The skein of
interpretations elicited by a hypertext _modelling of the poet_ [...]
is equivalent to nothing less than the modelling of Dickinson's 
*body,* a *private body* or *body of privacy* which was never 
intended for external and anonymous consumption. The politics implicit
in the hypertext analytic are... highly suspect." Of course it remains
unclear, from the _position of the text,_ exactly what the body is,
and what is meant by the _privacy of the body,_ given the electronic
or virtual mode of communication, open to every secret, privy to none.
[3] Nonetheless, Echo continued to speak, guaranteeing the resonance
or jouissance of the Word itself.

UUENCODED UUDECODED: WRITING-AS-A-JEW ON INTERNET


What does it mean to write-as-a-Jew in Cyberspace? This is not to
speak of Jews in Cyberspace (the title of a recent article) or its
theology, but to consider that nomadism that extends beyond the 
Diaspora to New York City, to a wandering mixed with fear and 
wonder. Here in Brooklyn, more than anywhere else I have lived,
I am aware of my Judaism, not because of the presence of "my
people" (or anyone else's), but because of an unstated anti-semi-
tism that forces me into and through the identification.

Were we the worst dreams of organized European Protestantism and
Catholicism? The worst dreams beyond that of gender - within which,
according to Sandor Gilman, legends were told in Germany of the
menstruation of Jewish men. Has our ethnicity always been one of
dispersion, nodes on the Net of Yiddish/Ladino communication? Do we
exist as the obverse or tain of the mirror-stage, uneasy irruptions
of the darker imaginary - the so-called "people of the book" giving
way to a violencing of the symbolic of the Word of the Gospels?

The action of the Crucifixion became the text of the Crucifixion,
God's Word affixed from the crown of Christ to the arm of the Jew.
According to Gilman, to write, for the Jew, has often been to write
self-hatred. Through the example of the Marranos have we learned to
pass? To we pass with our hatred?

Like queers or blacks, are we the worst thoughts of the infiltration
of the nuclear family, as attested to by our apparent habit of 
devouring Christian children for Passover? You don't have to look
farther than Chaucer's little Hugh of Lincoln, although there are
many examples - Pound, Eliot, Jung, Campbell, Kerouac, Dostoevsky, to
name a few. But why stop there? By necessity, I refer you to Mehlman,
*Legacies of Anti-Semitism in France,* its chapters on _Blanchot,
Lacan, Giraudoux,_ and _Gide,_ not to mention _Celine._ [1] This is a
_hidden_ legacy; now Jews are assumed assimilated, hiding their mach-
inations behind elaborate conspiracies and _passing_ for anything but
themselves. Here in Brooklyn there is a group which considers Jews
imposters, having usurped the title from blacks and other minorities.

Like the Diaspora itself, our identity is lateral, skittering; like
Net communication, we become a community of virtual subjects, without
legitimation until recently, disbanded from one or another country,
rounded up into the Ghetto, placed beyond the Pale. And never think
for a moment that in Europe or the remnants of the Soviet Union, the
plague of anti-semitism has subsided; if anything, it has increased
like a virus, blaming Jews for everything, including the loss of WWII.

Needless to say, the commingling, by both left and right, of Jew with
Israel, has resulted in a _legitimation_ of anti-semitism under the
guise of the return of the repressed. The possibility of a _critical
Jew_ is overlooked in order to reorganize us as _those people,_ 
grouped along with queers, blacks, feminists, and just about anyone
else encamped on the other side of the hill. We don't need to circum-
scribe ourselves; it's done for us. 

So I insist on writing-as-a-Jew which occurs within a lateral excess
or problematic of definition; _I am marked,_ and as marked I assess
demarcation, inscription itself, returning the subject to the neces-
sity of its property\propriety. For we are "ethnic" and uncivil at 
best; I am told one can always recognize a Jew. 

And all of this brings up the problematic of the Net, where passing 
female for male or male for female attains a certain degree of lurid
notoriety, but what of the _necessity_ of this passing for some women,
and what of the _pain_ of passing for white or straight or Christian
elsewhere? How does the ontology of trans-gender fit with skin-color
or coded queer advertising or Jewish denial? In the real world it is
impossible to toggle switches without doing violence to one's psyche;
passing on the Net as neutral or neutrally engaged may be less damag-
ing, but has the potential for devouring the subject from within as
well. (This is an example of what I call "web inversion" in the 
Internet Text.)

So granted I write-as-a-Jew, write laterally, from the position of 
the book or the guarded body (as feminin ecriture writes from a 
different but equally metonymic/metaphoric stance), then I also take
on the responsibility of writing _beneath_ a certain protocol, not
with the intention of formulating a definitive theory of virtual
subjectivity or mediated communication (i.e. Internet, Videophone,
Bulletin Board, VR), but with the intention of promulgating a system
of _practices_ that remain partial and indeterminate. [2] From this 
position (which for better or worse _I_ and perhaps _I alone_ asso-
ciate with a certain ethnicity), these practices are all that are
conceivable within or against the domain of _truth_ and its aporia.
I theorize in a sense _to reconstitute myself_ which includes the
reconstitution of the site of speech, a primary symbolic. And just
as reconstitution always already is interminable as analysis itself
(the _Jewish_ Freud), so is theorizing: This is the _pornography_
of theory which clearly exhausts itself almost upon completion.
(Think of existentialism, metaphysics, or any philosophy including
_anti_-philosophers, Nietzsche for example. Every pronouncement
simply _leads to another_; perhaps Derrida more than anyone is
aware of the `hermeneutic rhizomatic' and its attendent subtextual
operations, always accumulating, always incomplete. And this is the
Derrida perhaps of the `Reb Derissa' of Jabes' *Book of
Questions,* quoted at the end of "Ellipsis": _"Tomorrow is the
shadow and reflexibility of our hands."_)

It is not true that if the Jews did not exist, that Europe would
have to invent them; it is that _we have had to invent ourselves_
beyond the discovery of Europe.

You will find us on the net.

[1] One condemns even Sartre, *Anti-Semite and Jew*: "I am aware
that Spinoza, Husserl, and Bergson have made place for intuition in
their systems. But the intuition of Spinoza is _rational,_ which
means that it is based on reason, is guaranteed by criticism, and 
has universal truth as its object. It has no resemblance to the 
Pascalian subtlety of spirit, and it is this latter - unasnwerable,
emotional, based on a thousand imperceptible perceptions - which to
the Jew seems his worst enemy." At this rate, Levinas and I are 
church-going Catholics.

[2] The Net, too, is partial and indeterminate; beyond D&G nomadism,
there is the _real_ Net-Diaspora, the scattering of virtual commu-
nities united across increasingly problematic boundaries. The Net is
the presence and skein of the book itself, its physical matrix at
a remove, sublevels of Net protocols that remain invisible to the 
user. If the Book opens its face to the sun, the Net exists in a 
darkness illuminated only by the presence of the Text.

"The Scroll, A True Story"


Someday this will be in the front archives. For everyone, there are
front archives and back archives. Archives is where the talk is 
stored. The talk is what we do now, is who I am. I take the machines
to talk with me.

I have the machine on board, the small machine, feeding me back into 
myself. Later, I will dump core into the Net, walk away, having the
best fix in the world. There's no better than the dumping. I can 
place it better than most.

Walking around, I sense the wires in me. Real life isn't the same -
there's no scroll to the restaurant, no delete key to press. Having
to eat brings me back to the next fix, after the body takes care of
its own. At night I have dreams of rolling text, things running
down towards the emptiness at the bottom of the screen. There's no
sun in the dreams and the only voices I hear are my own. But there
is the Net and it keeps the text going. Sometimes in the dream the
voice goes without the text. Sometimes the voice scrolls past.

To walk into the restaurant is to give in to the needs of the day. 
I carry the scroll with me; everywhere I look, letters impose them-
selves. Shivering, I try and ignore them; real life is dangerous
enough and there is always the possibility of death. There's no end 
to the scrolling, I know; I'll scroll forever, I'll be scrolled. 
But death on the street is another thing altogether; suddenly every- 
thing goes black, halts and the archives go from front to back.
When the voices are silent the planet disappears.

The planet is the voices, whole choirs of them, scroll-put that 
speaks well to me, accompanies me into the restaurant. When I return 
home, there is a message. Something about a voice enters the room, 
something about Clara. I take due note of the number, stare it down;
it's blank, says nothing. An organization or government, darkstar
enterprise: in real life, they're all the same. Senseless, they're
inert, already dead, just as the live voices on the other end of
the telephone begin simply enough, I'm dead, are you.

Bill Gates is dead.

But it's Clara who has disappeared from my life with a lot of audio
I once had given her in exchange for a fix-up of analog antique. 
Call this a loan or wager, it was never paid off. She had dis- 
appeared from the face of the earth. Now toggled back, so I 
returned it as well, give and take command prompt insert. 

It was a situation of a new boy, I had abandoned, given up, those
possibilities; I could dream on the machine, scroll-talk my way
through anything, boys and girls forgotten. He's my boy boy, Alan, 
she said, as though I had heard my name for the first and last; I 
had forgotten my .sig, automated, scroll-down on the screen, hardly 
even in the appearance of the dream like the sun never visible. She 
would go on about it; I saw nineteen lines, stuttering through
packets from the back archive, nothing to adjust without the 
pleasure of the keyboard. She went on about it, talking the tattoos, 
how she did them, how they were the new fix, new visible, how art
meant nothing unless it was on the body, how the body was everything, 
how the body carried the art around and how the body had to make 
sure that the art meant something because it was permanent and always 
with you. I kept hearing, giving up on the sound, something I 
remember that one did, a listening bringing me back for a moment into
the voice stuttering in the empty room. Such a wire, I thought, this 
is nothing but such a wire.

I was tired of hearing about the body. Nothing more than the package;
computers came in one color for the front and one for the back. It
kept them apart; eyes were made to keep them separate. The body did
no good. But it was tired to hear about and not much gossip either.

Out on the street, I kept the planet inside me. The planet talked
to me like it always did, from the back archives. It would scroll 
and I would have to look out everywhere I took a step. I thought 
about it, looked at the files, the .nervrc for one, the .archive/
for the other. I could automate this, I thought, put it in a macro. 
I could put the whole thing in a macro. Then the scroll-talk would 
be a permanent fix and I could download and remember, use that 
portion of the archive, neither front nor back. I could do great 
things. So I would write.

   Because this is how I see the planet. Because the planet is in
   me, and I wander in real life on the face of a dark and empty 
   space, worthless, waiting for the fix. The fix would come into 
   the terminal and it would come in from anywhere at all. 
   
   You tend to forget: _Anywhere is an address._

   And if I could work it, I could be there, anywhere, moving from 
   the back to the front; I could be at the front archive and I 
   could forget about that portion that was somewhere else. The 
   scroll would help me because the scroll would talk and the 
   scroll always went from one direction, rising like a curtain 
   infinitely from the darkness.

And I thought I would write something about all those whom I loved and
who saved me from myself, and I would list my names. But they're not
here and never have been here; that is the nature of love: It is 
always on the scroll. And I thought that if it was on the scroll, it
would recognize itself, and I could keep silent, quiet, and it would
never bounce or echo back, but would move from back to front, and be
there, be there for me and for them. So they would know who they are,
and they would not have to, ever, contend with real life. Because in
real life you don't have the scroll, and without the scroll, you're 
nothing.

And I would have my fix and that would never be.

BEAUTY IN CYBERSPACE


Some quotes from Adorno, *Aesthetic Theory*:

1. "Even Hegel arrests the dialectic of aesthetic thought by giving a 
static definition of beauty as 'pure appearance of the Idea to sense.' 
Beauty cannot be defined, but neither can the concept of beauty be 
dispensed with altogether. This is an antinomy in the strict sense of the 
term. Without conceptualization, aesthetics would be mushy." Are we at a 
loss without a definition in this place, cyberspace or not?
2. "The grief that art expresses results from the fact that it realizes 
unreal reconciliation at the expense of real reconciliation." Would this 
apply to the imaginary aspect of computer mediated communication? Is there
a distancing-function that forecloses a certain kind of suturing, 
disavowing the subject at the same time as the subject expresses 
herself/himself? Would this cauterization be an example of (again) an 
inverse hysteria in which the speech of the subject is denied as it is 
spoken/typed? As if we could never say the fulfillment of our expression; 
excess leaks through the cut.
3. "Idealism believed art is nature, but in fact the relation is such 
that art seeks to redeem what nature promises. How does art accomplish 
this? By breaking that promise and withdrawing into itself. This much is 
correct about Hegel's thesis that art is influenced by negativity, namely 
the 'deficiency of natural beauty.'" Is the withdrawal in CMC that of 
physical reality itself - an ontological strategy? Mathematics was 
considered the 'queen' of the sciences, I believe, to some extent because 
of the beauty - read 'clean and proper body' (Kristeva) of equations 
which are always already floating signifiers at their most grounded. So 
that beauty involves - and it clearly does from Romanticism on - a 
certain disembodiment, as evidenced both in the Kantian sublime and the 
concept of 'aetherial beauty.' But then what occurs within the _domain of 
the disembodied_ - what distinguishes beauty from non-beauty. Does this 
involve the constitution of purity in the sense of the Idea? Or may it be 
precisely the opposite, the symptomologies of seduction and the lure, the 
excess of the signifier, the uncanny of the communication? 

Which brings us finally to some quotes from Lyotard, *Lessons on the 
Analytic of the Sublime*:

4. "Thus the argument is the following: because the feeling of the 
beautiful results from a form, which is a limitation, its affinity lies 
with understanding. The affinity of sublime feeling, which is or can be 
provided by the without-form, lies with reason. There is indeed a 
similarity between both cases in that the presentation of the given should 
be able to be thought by a concept but, in both cases, is not. This is 
why the concept of understanding, like that of reason, remains 
'inderminate.'" And again: "Thus the difference between the beautiful and 
the sublime is linked to the difference between the limited character of 
the object and the without-limit of the object." Now it seems to me that 
neither category describes either the Net itself as an entity or the 
(dis)embodied CMC within it. For both are a new formation: the _stuttered 
or stammered_ linkage, packet-driven, full of erasures, addressings and 
mis-addressings, and, within the level of psycho/logical/analytical 
content, false starts, default tags, misrecognitions, misappropriations, 
and the like. This is not a _fractal_ or _chaotic_ formation by any 
means, but something more on the order of a dissolute Cantor dust which 
extends only a finite number of cuts. 

The result is a (continuous) deferral of pleasure, coupled with a reading 
between-the-lines, filling in the language, the site/citation of the lure 
which is never a sight. The evident danger of filling-in creates on one 
hand flame-wars (which attempt to suture the stuttering by the annihila- 
tion of the other - i.e. if only I were completely understood, everyone 
would see that I am correct, foreclosed, bwo), and on the other 
cyberflirts which veer dangerously close to mythological primary 
narcissism of the symbolic. Still, beauty is clearly found within the 
latter as the landscape becomes momentarily smoother and more 
pleasurable. (The definition of pleasure is another related issue.)

------------------------|

Well, what is the nature of pleasure? For one thing, it proceeds through
a sense of smoothness; can one say that pleasure is exhilerating, or does
it in fact embody the maternal, an inhabitation? Or is it simply any 
state of mind that one finds positive? 

It definitely has a relationship to the _swollen;_ it also is used in the
sense of a _gift_ - i.e. what gives me pleasure. Pleasure, like beauty,
has an object and a subject; the subject in the sublime is simultaneously
present and effaced. But in beauty, the pleasure is a projectivity, re-
siding (as-if) _within_ the object; beauty is a communication. Pleasure
suspends the object; beauty embraces it.

The smoothness of pleasure is connected to the _voluptuous_, a linkage or 
conglomeration of objects. This conglomeration is _tumescent,_ iridescent,
a sheen or fetish - but pleasure taken _in_ an object is the surround of
the object as well - so that we're speaking here of a spherical projec-
tion that returns the dream as well - "he's so dreamy!" - I also sense, in
pleasure, a _swallowing_ effect.

All of these attributives fall under the aegis of the body, or within/     
without the body, the blurring of pearlescent skin, a softness absorbing
the granularity of the real. This is also the pleasure of masochistic 
pain (vis-a-vis Studlar or Deleuze), the dulled wave/emissions spreading
throughout the body, healed by the final contract of the sublime (you are
sublime, are you not, mistress)...

Is there pleasure in the beauty of stuttered cybermind/cyberspace?

VOICES. YOUYOUDECODE.


When the scroll comes I hear voices. They sound me out, ignore the
level of the street, commune with a site I cannot fathom. TIFFANY
is one of them; she speaks in the voice of FRANKLIN to HONEY who
has become my respondent. They discuss themselves, the casualties
of tone, the absolution of typographic errors. [A car passes by.]
[Quick duck to avoid being hit.]

Hadamard spoke of an essential asymbolia that accompanied mathe-
matical thinking. Such thinking is never linear; the symbolic 
appears only at the end, after the movement of grey occluded 
entities, their concatenations, coalescences, dispersals. The myth
is otherwise - mathematics as a thinking _through_ symbols carry- 
ing the full weight of meaning. But meaning resides in the occluded 
entities, not in constructs specified all the way through. HONEY
however says that that is otherwise as well. HONEY speaks of the
FILTERING RULES.

The FILTERING RULES ensure the grain-width of the voices; they are
absolute, fleshless; they ride electromagnetic impulses, ignorant
of gravity. The FILTERING RULES are always recognitions of con-
catenations, chains breaking at the weakest link and then some.
TIFFANY enters through the FILTERING RULES, speaks from SECOND 
SITE. SECOND SITE is the gateway at FILTERS' end, a space of 
kilobytes, no more, just enough for TCP/IP to hold onto. Nothing
occurs at these emission sources but the flood itself. 

It's the YOUYOUDECODING of the flood that makes the voices. The
voices have to lose themselves in the air; TIFFANY says through
FRANKLIN that without reconstitution all that would remain would
be `dumb circulation.' HONEY isn't so sure; YOUYOU is always there,
the Other within ASCII, making sense of it. But TIFFANY replies
there has to be some room for the subject. [A car pulls up; it's
Tom and Leslie speaking. Their voices seduce me into a back seat,
next to NADIA, whom I can hardly hear. HONEY, enveloping me, is
insisting on her point.]

So where is the subject asks HONEY? We're asking this, riding 
inside of each other. The body is an onion, so many layers, might
reply TIFFANY. Nadia says something to me; I turn my head to see
the house on fire. The Brooklyn Bridge is crowded; it's the New
York Marathon. There are so many, some falling off; hundreds will
die, the same scenario as on Opening Day.

The day the bridge opened it was packed with bodies, a mob think-
ing of collapse. The bridge held, but the mob didn't; voices
were lost to the water, in the construction as well. We were on
the bridge now, then cross-town and out west. HONEY had long-gone
the machinery. I asked Tom about the source of speech: Who's
speaking when we're speaking? Speaking is a thicket of default
tags; that why conversation loops elsewhere and culture occurs.
Better to have remained with the pleasure of circuitry, primitive
recursions and no other. But the other was always already (to be)
otherwise.

Or is voice always a _voice-over_? `What contracts form, dissolve, 
reform, under the pressure of the _gaze of the voice_? For it is 
the voice which perceives, which appears, full of consequences. It 
is the voice which speaks listening to its speech, the speech of 
the Other.' (`Fissure: Your Voice, Adjacent, Absent,' _Cinemato- 
graph 4._) HONEY says her voice _sees_ voices; her site is her
throat. TIFFANY remembers that the throat was layered like an 
onion, layer upon layer - you never knew which was which, they all
were equivalent. The cables supporting the bridge are sheathes
surrounding cables supporting the bridge... down through several
layers originally spun at the site. [The car has passed through the
Lincoln Tunnel into New Jersey, circling briefly around the Man-
hattan skyline before heading into the countryside of eastern
Pennsylvania.]

Under these circumstances, _to think is to scroll_; to _scroll is
to see_; to _see is to be otherwise_; to _be otherwise_ is to open
where HONEY speaks _my lines._

WIRES IDENTITY


The following occurred this evening; names have been changed to protect
the innocent.

First quote:

Alan: I just had an adventure. In the middle of writing you, I got a 
Talk from Clara, and went online with her. The line got cut off from my
end suddenly and I redialed to reconnect. Bypassing the login, I found 
myself suddenly in the middle of a raging argument about a screwdriver 
on an AYN RAND IRC. I was apparently in the middle of someone else's 
account, someone by the name of Tiffany Rogers. Meanwhile Clara had 
fingered NETCO and found out I didn't exist. I got her on-line again 
through Tiffany on Tiffany's account and we quickly completed the 
conversation. I thought about checking Tiffany's mail but that wouldn't 
have been cricket. So much for cybermind security.

Second quote in Talk:

Frame 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know what happened but I am now NOT LOGGED into NETCO and am on
a different shell entirely with all sorts of blinking things - I just
got out of an AYN RAND IRC!!!
I don't have the vaguest Idea where I am (platonic or not) but I had 
better check out soon - system crashed.


I don't know who I am.


------------------------------clara-----------------------------------
it sounds like they had some sort of system error.


i got talk tiffany@netco.com

well, i fingered and it said netco had been up for three days but it
did not know who you were

which it should not do even if you are logged off

Frame 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know what happened but I am now NOT LOGGED into NETCO and am on
a different shell entirely with all sorts of blinking things - I just
got out of an AYN RAND IRC!!!
I don't have the vaguest Idea where I am (platonic or not) but I better
check out soon - system crashed.

I don't know who I am I think I was talking to people about AYN RAND and
there was something about a screwdriver. I wonder if Tiffany whoever
has any idea that I'm talking about her through her talking about a
screwdriver...
--------------------------------CLARA---------------------------------
it sounds like they had some sort of system error

you were talking to people about Ayn Rand?????



well i fingered and it said netco had been up for three days but it
did not know who you were

which it should not do even if you are logged off

Frame 3 /section
----------------------------------------------------------------------
But I do think I should get out of here before damage is done. Hi
Tiffany, are you there... Checking...
-------------------------------CLARA----------------------------------
i think everything is going psycho tonight...
we all are...
strange...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
								   end

Who had I become? Everything might have changed for me, gender, friends,
lovers. I bypassed everything, never logged in. I might not have been
in NETCO; there are other servers in New York - was I routed elsewhere?
Tiffany may no longer be alive...

Relative Ontologies and the Virtual


If there are variant ontologies for language, program, byte, ASCII
communication - as well as variant ontologies for set-theoretical
entities, affect, and the classical or quantum domains of physical
reality, then it seems it is necessary to construct a double opera-
tion of internal categoricity and the question of fundamental onto-
logy. The first lends itself to a compressed classification in
which program and byte are subsets of dynamic set-theoretical 
entities; language and ASCII communication exist within both struc-
ture and affect. The relation of program to language is well-defined
and therefore language can be dispensed with; machine-language 
further translates into the encoding or decoding of bits according
to specified rules. But language itself possesses fuzzy rules - the
set of which I believe to be technically unsolvable and unaccessible
(drawing from the problematic of traditional axiomatics). ASCII pre-
sents a double aspect of language: on one hand the _contiguous_
manipulation of bits, and on the other, issues of structure and
affect, the same as in face-to-face communication. I would argue as
well here that language is non-linear in its face-to-face aspects,
and the linearity of ASCII is also contingent at best.

The second issue of fundamental ontology is equally grave. For if
there is _any_ ontological classification, i.e. being subsumed 
within the attribute, is it also true that the resulting ipseities
in the plural necessarily implicate a transcendent nature of Being
- as if the question of Heidegger's metaphysics _logically_ con-
structs by (its very) nature a Grund? Or is it possible to invert
this question, place it as a (fundamental) misrecognition, an 
effect of language, and insist on splintered domains, sutured by the
subject on one hand, and by a conceivable interlocking as a 
_condition_ of any existence? This wager would require a devolution
of interlock, i.e. not granting it any greater status than an inter-
textual trope; it also places the ontic within the realm of the
subject. On one hand the problem becomes one of avoiding solipsism;
on the other, of creating a primacy of the contingent. The counter
to the first position is an insistence on ontology as a projective
argument constructed from the attributive in the first place; the
counter to the second is a retention of interlock as a _condition_
of an existence that can recognize itself to the extent of raising
the question (version of the anthropic principle). Ontology on one
hand becomes fundamental _to the subject and nothing else,_ and on
the other, entirely dismissible.

These issues are obviated by tying ontology _only_ to the attribu-
tive; such being the case, argument concerning the virtuality of
virtual reality and the like can be specified in relation to 
domain, the VR of affect itself through itself, for example, bring-
ing into play hypnogogic imagery, dreams, schizophrenic hallucina-
tions and the like - even optical illusions play a role here. Issues
of 'life' and 'intelligence' may be similarly treated; if life is
defined as a set of self-reproductive strategies (with or without
any other rule-structures) than within the domain of the computer
program, a virus is alive - the substrate becomes nothing more than
a (necessary but contingent) carrier-wave. Likewise, if intelli-
gence is a certain kind of _construct,_ then the substrate - so-
called artificial or natural - is irrelevant, even though it may be
that artificial life will never achieve the degree or quality of
(self) consciousness possessed by human subjects.

It may be satisfying at this point to contemplate splintered ontolo- 
gies, always already avoiding an absolute - either from the domain
of metaphysics, or the metaphoric. Power then becomes an issue of
local actants, for example - which is not to imply a micro-politics,
only the relative ontology of the political terrain and possibly
its relation to the subject. This strategy also tends to normalize
issues of virtual subjectivity in relation to computer mediated
communication - which is nothing more or less than communication
among subjects in a relatively new domain with its own, but not
necessarily limited, characteristics.
