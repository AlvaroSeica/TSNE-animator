Netted = Death = Text

I've been sending out writing / images / video / audio since the beginning 
of 1994. writing = codework = theory - everything. images = difficult to 
classify. video = the usual as well as executables. audio = radio = music 
= sound. Perfect moments. The project is moribund, decayed. Jennifer's 
excitement disappeared a long time ago. The open space has closed as the 
text = me tends to suture itself = suture myself. It was never a space. It 
was swill. I perform emptiness. If I send out a suicide note = nothing. I 
await a Grand Inquisitor. I misuse alphabets, bits and bytes, pixels, 
email lists. I become a sickness unto death. I inhabit no-man's land where 
I am braced. I write myself into myself. I swallow my words like a Jew. 
Another file where I remember writing crash-land Tokyo, Nikuko, Travis, 
Honey, Tiffany, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, Doctor Leopold Konninger. The sick- 
ness of the Doctor is my own. Cut to early video: supine Azure calling: 
Doctor, Doctor. The Doctor is a special case, intransitive. The Doctor 
begins and ends _there._ I work my fingers down to dead music = bone. I 
make the bone = gift = Second Life flaccid. I give you space to swallow. 
My space is stolen from me and they thieve my prims = things = shapes = 
nothing. Sky = nothing = earth. Damp sky = certain smell. I am your files 
and corrosion. I am your fluids which you dry on your bits and bytes. Here 
I wait my death and the death of my work. My missiles have no mission. My 
posts are crossed and crowded. The signature of my fraud will disappear. 
You will find my splices melted, my tapes sick with print-through. A dream
= offer my archives for ten thousand, all my work = fear no one will buy. 
Online I compete with noise = my skull rots within. Someday this will stop 
= that moment of inbox automated erasure = kill or delete. In my sickness 
I delete. In my sickness I = I

WWII and WWIII

Die Welt is alles, was der Fall ist.


    Drawer Contents


Digital scans of dead Japanese soldiers' mementos, Iwo Jima, WWII
Manuscript in rare script, monks' vows
Japanese and Chinese antique abaci, different number representations
Stromatolite fossil, early bacteria, Australia, 2.5-3.0 billion years old
William Crookes' spintharoscope, 1902, with early radium sample 
  VLF (very low frequency) radio with loop antenna, responsive to 3-30 
  kilohertz, listens to cosmic rays, lightning, solar radiation,
  auroras, etc.
Videotape still, The Red Brigade, with Emily Cheng, 1973

    Above

1895 telegraph receiver
Soldier's memento, WWII


The enemy of the world is our enemy.
The world is our enemy.
Accountancy systems absorb our very thinking.
VLF radios account for whatever is left over.
The saddest mementos of the world, everywhere in the world.
The saddest mementos are unaccountable.
They are the remnants of orphaned memory.
The remnants of orphaned memory are all the language humans have.
VLF radios record from past and future billions of years.
Bacterial mats, alone, for the majority of the world's history.
Radium emits what VLF radios record, signs our futiliy,
what our enemy, the world, has granted us.
The telegraph clicks uselessly.
What was granted, what is taken away.

tourmaline

i would love to live in this world of pastel beauty
unsolid, translucent, the promise of comfort within
sublime and exalted, i would curl up, sleeping forever
so soft the music, my body cleared of sin

and nowhere to go and nowhere the dismal slaughter
of others, there are none, of others, no language
temperate climes and just the right amount of dreaming
no ticketing, no tracks, procedures, and no baggage

and all the time to curl and smile gently and alone
and look and say in pure color softly leaving
color leaving and returning in softest waves of tones
and nothing harsh, and loving, never grieving

softly now, my arms embrace the softly smiling world
and softly all my forms embrace me, softly furled

"The other day, Azure and I were returning from installing a show around 
West 148th Street in Manhattan. We took the subway back to Brooklyn, and 
LO and BEHOLD, realized we had taken the A, B, C, and D trains in that 
order. Surely this was an alphabetic-omen; it was the first time we had 
actually done this, and out of necessity, not a desire for quartic com- 
pletion. That said, I have turned to the entire corpus of the Internet 
Text, and found only the following tawdry examples of the string. What has 
happened to me? Why the poverty of capitalization? Why the DISORDER?"

Passive-Aggressively Blowing My Own Horn

===================

Early on, around 1994-5, I developed the concept of 'rewrite,' the enunci- 
ation/announcement of online presence - an ontological performative funda- 
mentally changing the way humans communicate.

I developed the concept of 'defuge' to indicate a kind of disinvestment or 
staleness that psychologically characterizes aspects of online and offline 
life.

I worked through the 'inscribed body'/'body of inscription' in relation to 
'culture all the way down,' placing the semiotic register across all 
species, and this in relation to an examination of the phenomenology of 
culture itself.

I worked extensively with the idea of 'third sex,' produced solely through 
the dynamics of a linguistic register in various social applications; in 
this respect, I further developed the concept of lag as seductive lure.

I did early work on MOOs and talkers, creating what would later be called 
codework pieces, by manipulating the database labels of both; I also 
worked on a phenomenology of talk/chat applications, ranging from MOOs to 
IRC.

I created a number of codework pieces, interfering in IRC channels, 
rewriting talker and MOO databases, and so forth.

I created the word 'codework' to reference a style of writing in which 
code-bones are apparent, scrabbling the surface and depths of texts, and 
in this regard was a forerunning of flarf, early on google-scraping and 
working with perl programs and unix/linux scripts to reconstitute texts, 
drawing new extended meanings out of them.

With the help of Florian Cramer, I extended the structure of the Chinese 
Thousand-Character Essay into other texts, using a perl program that kept 
only the first instance of a word, in its proper order; I operated upon 
Genesis in this fashion.

I have worked with one of the longest-running art projects online - the 
Internet Text, which I add to daily, and which was started at the begin-
ning of 1994.

In Second Life, I have constructed a new and extreme style of artwork, in 
which real-life textures are combined with 'alien' shapes and spaces, 
having no basis in the real world.

With Foofwa de Imobilite and Azure Carter - we have pioneered a form of 
dancework called 'avadance' from avatar movement, and this movement itself 
has been pioneering, using software- and hardware-altered motion capture 
equipment to create 'inconceivable' mappings of human behaviors.

Through Gary Manes, I pioneered in the creation of dynamic filters for 
motion capture processing; these parallel graphic filters in image-proc- 
essing programs, but they transform both time- and space-coordinates.

Using Blender, I have created avatars without any human or organic feat- 
ures whatsoever, adding human behavioral patterns to them, in order to 
examine the phenomenology of behavioral 'reading' without cues from a body 
image itself.

In music, I have pioneered new guitar techniques, as well as extended the 
possibilities of instruments such as Alpine zither, hegelung, and cobza.

I have written one of the first extended works dealing with body abjection 
and discomfort, centered on cancer, through the use of codework and other 
textual manipulations.

Early on, I created a series of raw texts from net-sex - texts which led 
to the concept of 'wryting,' inscribing the body itself as projection and 
introjection; this led to the concept of 'jectivity,' indicating the 
psychological and psychoanalytical flows between agents, screens, desire, 
and programs.

Along the same line, in an extended text called Textbook of Thinking, I 
created a 'ruptured' analysis of the obscene and the abject as existing in 
a different register, within or beneath the linguistic - this deeper 
register (related to Kristeva's 'chora') underlies human communication and 
behavior.

Early on, I wrote on textual interfaces in linux, and their phenomenolo- 
gies; I also analyzed talk and ytalk in linux/unix as representations of 
the body on-screen, in terms of screen 'real estate.'

Through textual avatars such as Nikuko, Travis, Alan, Jennifer, and Julu, 
I worked through psychological and psychoanalytical issues of projected 
identities; these characters appeared anywhere from talkers to IRC to 
email to newsgroups to Second Life.

In terms of philosophical issues, I wrote extensively on the relationship 
of the 'analogic' and 'digital' registers, using the abacus as a starting 
point; this also has led to a series of purely philosophical texts, such 
as Sophia and Philosophy, which utilize conceptual organization as a way 
to structure analyses of the real.

I have written as well on the fundamental entanglement of the real and 
virtual, within the phenomenology of inscription - an entanglement that 
virtualizes and mirrors any ontology, within any other.

I have written what might be the deepest analysis of Second Life from 
within - that is, an analysis of virtual worlds and worlding, in a series 
of texts gathered in The Accidental Artist.

In dance, I have created a series of 'possibilities' using VLF (very low 
frequency radio) in order to create a dialectic between choreography/ 
movement and the 'invisible' radiating world at large.

(I should mention my early video- and film-work, based on new techniques - 
for example, in the early 1980s, I created a 16mm (sound) film a week, 
using multiple in-camera processing, layering optical soundtracks on the 
fly, and so forth.)

Within the sociology of postmodernism, I have analyzed the social in terms 
of radiations and dusts, using these to model transmission (both basic 
and parasitic) and reception across a variety of spectra.

Along the same lines, I have written on the phenomenology of VLF, short- 
wave listening, and similar things which emphasize hunting virtualities in 
worldings that are always already continuously evanescent and vanishing.

Early on, I created artworks using Quickbasic and Basic, to create images 
that scattered from within, as well as fractal traces using a phenomenolo- 
gy of measurement - these led to considering the boundaries of the visual 
in relation to the boundaries of the world, which was also built upon a 
re-examination of inscribing between x and -x in set theories. 

Earlier still, I created pieces that involved 'driving in 4-space' - 
moving through four-dimensional space - the image was flattened to a 
2-space vector screen.

And slightly later, using UCSD Pascal, I created 'active-editing' programs 
that would take textual input and transform it on the fly; this led to an 
analysis of parasitism and noise in situations where it seemed imperative 
to transmit a message through a hostile environment.

These same techniques were used, within the past few years, as a way to 
interfere with three-dimensional modeling programs, so that it became 
almost, but not totally, impossible to reconstitute the original image 
from the scan - and this led, in turn, to reworking avatar bodies them- 
selves in second life, producing anomalous and unreadable structures 
motivated by avatar 'intelligence' within them.

And so forth.

===================

So where is this work? Scattered among chapbooks, print-on-demand books 
(which are never available for review or perusal), within the Internet 
Text and at the website I use to temporarily store files (temporarily - 
given the limited storage I have). There are archived materials at the 
Ohio State University in Columbus; there are materials that will be 
archived at New York University in Manhattan. There are over twenty-five 
hours of films still at Filmmakers Coop, where they sit and decay. There 
are several cds, and three non-publish-on-demand books, none of which 
discuss any of the above. There have been a number of manuscripts which 
continue to gather dust. At one point I self-published several dvds and 
texts, but that proved impractical.

What happened? My work is difficult to grasp; it moves too quickly among 
disciplines and (artistic) communities; almost all of it is non-academic 
in style; it's unsellable; it's parasitic on email lists, and appears (as 
this text appears) only as noise; it's sent to /dev/null one way or ano- 
ther; at times it appears too neurotic, sexual, intense, moribund, diffi- 
cult, or depressive; it takes far too much time to read and/or process; it 
seems to short-circuit itself; I'm socially awkward, etc. etc.

What will happen? Surely nothing until after my death, and then, if the 
works survive on someone's machine, something might come of them; however 
by then, they'll most likely be outdated.

This can only end on an "ah, well...".

The Wrong Direction & The Right Direction


We've taken the wrong direction. This is the big illumination today. We're 
doing it all wrong. Dance, jazz, improvisation, sports - just about any- 
thing requiring the body - is already outdated, useless. Why choreograph 
when prosthetic bodies twist with infinite possibility? Why improvise when 
programming can set instrumentation to any degree of facility? Tuning a 
physical instrument is exhausting, useless; it's never sufficiently accu- 
rate. Spending hours in the dance-studio - ultimately for the purpose of 
spectacle - is meaningless, when sufficiently detailed avatars can enact 
anything whatsoever. Theatrically, cinematically, the same is true: an 
avatar can move untowardly, can memorize thousands of pages of script, 
hits the mark every time, requires no nourishment or pandering. I'm seri- 
ous - my life has taken a wrong turn, too much physical labor. All that 
does is kill you, wears the muscle out. On the other hand, programming 
clearly increases the longevity of brain power. Wait, I'm not done. Today 
you can program mistakes as well, make things more human than human. If I 
sit here as I do and work on intonation with one or another instrument, 
I'm clearly wasting my time. If Foofwa repeatedly stretches his body to 
the limit, hour after hour, he's participating in a vanishing art - no 
wonder dance is in a crisis, splitting into ballet on one hand, obscenity 
on the other! And Azure's singing? Why bother, when there's an app for 
that?

The realization is as follows: we should be living a world of fantasy, not 
indulging in blood, sweat and tears. Without wanting to appear callous, 
I'll just say it - that's for the other fellow. If our virtual prosthetics 
twist as we desire, the other fellow has extracted the materials holding 
the software in a physical bubble projecting our good lookings for anyone 
to see, hear, taste, touch, smell. We've buried the physical in the physi- 
cal, and that's how it should be. The future moves from wires to optics to 
the air itself; we keep track of the few and fetishized physical elements 
with embedded technologies of all sorts. We didn't have to build these of 
course - they just arrived. Now I know what you're thinking - this is the 
same old story of labor below, beauty above (isn't that the case with the 
human body?), but it's augmented, prosthetically, by market and creative 
forces driving human aspirations for anyone who can afford a computer. And 
certainly for those of us still physically laboring, ourselves, at impos- 
sible and incomprehensible perfection - we should move into the 21st 
century, embrace nothingness, enter realms of pure imagination - in other 
words, survive in the real, play in the imaginary. The digital-eternal 
always keeps dirt, decay, and even technological obsolescence away from 
inherent beauty. (Obsolescence, in fact, is only a matter of reconfigura- 
tion.) We'll still eat (for a while) and excrete (for a while); we'll 
still breath (for a while). But these are no longer determinative as they 
once were, and for all we know, we might already be cycling through vaults 
of pure virtuality, locked into the appearance of infinity, of our own 
free will, and once upon a time. Let it go! Foofwa, Azure, myself and many 
others, are giving up the practice and praxis of body; we're about to 
embark on a journey that would have been inconceivable, were it not for 
the analogic and digital labor of countless others. We'll send messages 
and images back, works of art far in advance of anything you might imag- 
ine, and we'll charge nothing. For we're always present elsewhere by 
virtue of the virtual, and require very little for the apparent embodi- 
ments of a thought so pure that it dare not be named. Look upon our works 
and be astonished; join us and forget the trivia of species already lost 
to the planet; search out destinies that have always been intended; and 
meet our makers in ourselves. The physical was never there in the first 
place; now we've voluntarily given up even the thought of it. We live in 
an infinite universe, creating and joining the universal Mind. Our gods 
are with us, you shall hear from us again.



Oud in Translation from "found online"


In spite of the fact that words "lute" duck "oud" are both suspected dates 
back to be while derive from in spite of the fact that Arabic (al-d), 
consisting shame in spite of the fact that Arabic easier ayn-ww-dl, 
meaning finish the rarity piece shame wood similar dates back to in spite 
of the fact that shape shame finish penalty, referring either dates back 
to in spite of the fact that wood plectrum used traditionally for are not 
playing in spite of the fact that lute, or dates back to in spite of the 
fact that the rarity fjerne shame wood used for in spite of the fact that 
the espousal, or for in spite of the fact that fact that in spite of the 
fact that top was made shame wood, not skin as were earlier. However, 
recent research later Edward Neubauer suggests that d may common be an 
Arabic verse shame in spite of the fact that Persian name rud, which meant 
contention, stringed instruments, or lute. In spite of the fact that 
Arabic prefix al-, set on al-d, which representable in spite of the fact 
that definitive article duck can be translated as "the," was not retained 
when al-d, was borrowed into Turkish, nor was in spite of the fact that 
ayn, as in spite of the fact that sound ( finish voiced pharyngeal 
fricative) does not exist set on Turkish. In spite of the fact that 
accomplishment word set on Turkish ice common ud (pronunciation follows 
that shame in spite of the fact that word good conform in spite of the 
fact that g ).

In spite of the fact that oud was most without doubt introduced dates back 
to Western European later in spite of the fact that Persians who is 
establishing in spite of the fact that Umayyad Caliphate shame Al- 
Devotion on in spite of the fact that Iberian Peninsula beginning set on 
in spite of the fact that year 711 AD. Oud- equal instruments such as in 
spite of the fact that Ancient Greek Pandoura duck in spite of the fact 
that Roman Pandura without doubt made their way dates back to in spite of 
the fact that Iberian Peninsula much earlier than in spite of the fact 
that oud. However, it was in spite of the fact that royal houses shame Al- 
Devotion that cultivated in spite of the fact that environment which 
raised in spite of the fact that flate ut shame oud are not playing dates 
back to greater heights duck boosted in spite of the fact that popularity 
shame in spite of the fact that instruments. In spite of the fact that 
most famous oud are not playing shame Al- Devotion was Zyriab. He is 
establishing in spite of the fact that first music conservatory set on 
Spain, enhanced are not playing technique duck add finish fifth course 
dates back to in spite of the fact that instruments. In spite of the fact 
that European verse shame this instruments came dates back to be known as 
in spite of the fact that lute luth set on French, Laute set on German, 
liuto set on Italy, luit set onDutch, (all beginning conform in spite of 
the fact that easier " legal") duck alaud set on Spain. In spite of the 
fact that word "luthier" meaning stringed instruments maker ice also while 
derive fromin spite of the fact that French luth. Unlike in spite of the 
fact that oud, in spite of the fact that European lute utilized frets 
(usually tied gut).

Affair

According dates back to Farabi, in spite of the fact that oud was 
inventory later Lamech, in spite of the fact that sixth grandson shame 
Adam. In spite of the fact that doctor is not telling that in spite of the 
fact that grieving Lamech hung in spite of the fact that body shame his 
dead son derive from finish the tree. In spite of the fact that first oud 
was inspired later in spite of the fact that shape shame his son's 
bleached skeleton. In spite of the fact that great grandchild pictorial 
juxtaposition shame finish lute beyond the espousal dates back to in spite 
of the fact that Uruk period set on Southern Mesopotamia Iraq Nasiriyah 
city nowadays, above 5000 years ago on finish cylinder seal is not 
acquiring later Dr. Dominique Is not collecting duck currently housed that 
in spite of the fact that British Mouse. In spite of the fact that the 
image depicts finish female crouching conform here instruments upon finish 
boat, are not playing right- a bargain. This instrumentsappeal many 
concurrent throughout Mesopotamian affair duck again set on ancient 
Egyptian derive from in spite of the fact that 18th dynamic onwards set on 
long duck short-neck varieties. One may see such examples that in spite of 
the fact that Metropolitan Mouse shame New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
duck in spite of the fact that British Mouse on clay the tablet duck 
papyrus parrot. This instruments duck its close comparative garden been 
finish share shame in spite of the fact that music shame each shame in 
spite of the fact that ancient civilizations that garden existed set on in 
spite of the fact that Mediterranean duck in spite of the fact that Dinner 
East region, including in spite of the fact that Sumerians, Akkadians, 
Persians, Kurds, Babylonian, Assyrien, Armenian, Greeks, Egyptian, duck 
Roman.



visual music of great virtual value

of 12'55" solo electric oud
certain dance of fingers wrists arms hands
certain dance of thumbs knuckles nails palms
in the style of youtube presentations:

someone is sitting on the edge of a couch, bed, or chair. the camera is 
aimed low and turned on and off by the person. the person holds a stringed 
instrument which goes in and out of focus. there's a sheepishness or naiv- 
ete about the presentation. what am i doing alone here, perhaps someone 
should help me, but there is no one and i am shy. i know i play well and i 
want to see myself playing, but perhaps others will find my playing medio- 
cre, not worth listening to. but i am playing for myself, and i will hear 
and watch and perhaps think others might enjoy what i am doing, and it 
sounds lovely and it is filled with longing, on this summer evening when 
paulownia is in bloom. i will sit and play in the dusk and sadness of my 
life, and someone will hear me and will smile quietly and think of me. the 
night clouds, fog rolls slowly across the pavilions. i am lonely and 
afraid, i play through my fear, turning it into a thing of beauty. yes, i 
think so. but maybe my music is not worthy of you, maybe i am alone on 
this couch, or bed, or chair, in a flat in the poorest part of town, or 
student quarters. you hear me and know my limited mind, far beneath your 
understanding, you understand my exaltation and inconceivable misery. you 
make me lonely with my music, singing words which never dare be spoken, 
singing words never to be sung.

of the world of art

art can be found anywhere, and in anything, and at anytime. from CHALKING 
A SIDEWALK to FLYING A KITE, art can be found. from the GALLERY to the 
PARK, art is there. art is the air we breathe, the COLORS we use, the 
SHAPES we see everywhere and everyday. art is the careless STYLE of a 
young child, and the fabricated production of the mature sculptor. art is 
OLD FORMS from new and NEW FORMS from old. the BACKGROUND of art is the 
STAIRS leading nowhere and the BROAD PLATEAU of the SUNNY PARK. as 
SPECTATORS and VIEWERS, we greet art. we say "'HELLO ART,'" expecting 
nothing in return. in return from nothing we receive BEAUTY with OPEN 
ARMS.
