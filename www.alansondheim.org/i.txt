In the middle of the night, in the darkest hours, I am reading Paul 
Feyerabend's  Killing Time, I am working my way through the carapace of 
the book:

this post comes to you like an arrow lost and isolated 
in the nighttime sky. 
it is the loneliest space in the world.
it is fed by its own ego, held with invisible wires suspended
in the invisible air.

[What about the ego? It is encapsulated, governed by packet protocol.  It
is fed by an energy not my own. It thrusts itself into the void. It tra-
vels through wires enough. I cannot follow the course through the earth
itself. It devolves, is shunted, energizes, uses itself up, always in
remission, arrives letter and packet perfect. It is suspended perfectly
and forever. Light loses its speed at either end. In the time it takes to
hold a breath. In the end time.]

it is coming across a photograph that has long-since 
disappeared. the world withdraws into silence.
it is comforting. it does not tally death, voices of amazement
no longer heard.
you turned and looked at me near the stop-sign on the corner. 
and it was black and yellow and you have died only I carry that glance
forever and I will forgive you it 
poised there
in the blank air.

it is always the air. it is the engine of the air or the air-movement 
or the dissolution of the air. it is the air this and the air that and 
it is the dissolution. there is no doubt about the air.

it has no doubt.

"Again I remember only isolated episodes. I can locate some of them, but 
I have no idea where and when the rest occurred. Until about five years 
ago I thought I had been in Kiev; a little checking back and forth 
convinced me that I never left the northern part of the Russian front."
(Feyerabend)

There are myths in the Northwest, a trope of a bridge of arrows, each 
linking to the other, shot perfectly, a conjunction of force, energy, 
vectors, into empty space.

My Fears Day and Night in Which I Strike Out / For New Territory


I fear failure most of all. I fear that my texts are bad scholarship, that
they'll never see print for the most part, that they'll disappear all too
quickly in this volatile medium. 

I fear I will never live with a lover again. 

I fear myself.

I fear that I will never have a full-time job again, that I will be found
increasingly useless and irrelevant on the basis of age alone. 

I fear my last fuck is my last fuck forever.

I fear that I shall die before the Net blossoms into an inconceivable
future in which we will walk through the solitary wild, in which the world
will dance again. 

I fear that I will turn inward, collapsed in cyberspace, bone and soul 
torn apart.

I fear that I will never know what it is to be beautiful, to command res-
pect and love in real life. 

I fear that I will never know what it is to live without fear, to wake in 
relative contentment and simplicity, without depression raging in the 
corners of my mind.

I fear that I am right, that I am wrong. And I fear that I am wrong, that 
I am right.

I fear nuclear holocaust, incipient fascism already on the horizon, and I
fear for women and minorities the world over, and I fear for species lit-
erally under the gun, extinction a deathstyle, way of death.

I fear my nights of nightmares and insomnia, and my days of dissolution.

I fear I have not given into my desires and I fear I have not been obscene
enough, and I fear that the edge for me is nothing more than a plateau for
the rest of you. 

I fear I never have been able to recognize the existence of others^.

I fear that I have never been able to believe and I fear that I have wan-
ted to believe something, anything. 

And I fear that I still have the residue of a body, its stain, tethering 
me to the side of the real beneath the sign of cyberspace. That I still 
desire body. That there is no one here beside me. That there is no other 
body. That there are no other bodies. That others^ disappear.

The _That_ (a poor text but one that leads to something finer)


The machine as painting: There is always the need to rely on the contin-
gent: in painting, it's the plane of the canvas itself, including the 
material support; in music, it is in general the twelve tones of the 
octave. Not that these are inviolate; as the century winds down, they 
have been abandoned as absolute stands. But they remain (just as the
vessel remains for the ceramicist) as a given, tying the body in parti-
cular ways to the medium which harbors history as ultimate restraint.

Tied to the computer, to the qwerty keyboard, to the necessity of using
_this_ particular language and alphabet, I wind my way through the city
flaneur-style, but with always already additional requirements - now
here in Dean and Deluca's, where many famous meetings have occurred, held
taut by the computer battery, itself winding its way to exhaustion. Is 
this the beginning of a primitive conjuncture of language/body and flesh
held taut within its presence? My claws press keys, press surfaces from
which the savannah is gone forever; this is a symbolic life-form, exist-
ing on another plane altogether.

There is always a form of restraint in communication - it's the restraint
which clears the noise from the message, redirects code into redundency.
The machine is a painting because the machine is tied to a vocabulary of
representation, always already; one works with the _that_ which parallels
science and technology as a _that_ in relation to the real. But then I
believe not so much in anarchy/conventionalism, but instead in a core-
theoretical approach - that the real has gristle, and a fairly specific
one at that - the gristle articulating the movement of the bones which
constitutes code...

No Time to Say 


Travis _knew_ time didn't exist. He knew it the same way he knew the 
color of the stars outside the ship the color of the earth the day he was 
born. 

He knew that there was a slurry. That there were reports that kept 
accumulating. They always vectored one-way, that of increase. There was 
always increase and this was static and there was no time.

The increase could be organized and he'd think about that and then he'd 
look towards the vector but it would always be horizoned. This gave him 
hope and the hope was permanent. The horizon remained at exactly the same 
distance and always empty. That way.

There were premonitions but they showed up only in the increase. They 
were the latitude of the increase. This was static and skewed. 

There was no time but always already increase which seemed to him an
economy, seemed to him capital. He thought of it exactly as that: beneath
the sign of capital. 

He thought that the crisis of capital had something to do with death, 
which was always on the horizon, mute, shuffled. He knew there was no 
death but always already reports of it. The demise of capital.

He involved himself in the biblical tense, the collusion of tenses, and
thought of the project of tenses. He thought the project would permit the 
manifestation of the absence of time, a trace left from the future (all 
traces originate in the emissions of the future, always already), skewed 
towards the past, spread like an eddy or delta, because the past was 
always infinitely shallow, symbolic, and infinitely deep, imaginary.

Travis translated va-y'omer, the talking of it which was the doing of it, 
and he will talk and he said, will say, in the saying of it. Then thought,
saying:

Flight


"You can almost find a lucid way to express delicate or transcendent 
things. If not, trying using a story!" (Serres, ibid.) 

In flight, I have often dreamed of a perfect air engine, swallowing itself,
an analog for neural processing, the blank generation, Peirce's sheet of
assertion. Now, thirty-one thousand feet above the ground, the engine
thins, dissolves; air transforms into purity.

Six miles up, we are becoming insubstantial, granular. In front of me there
is a second lcd screen, built into the seatback, with instructions for 
computer, game, telephone, and fax use. I am missing the connect, using
this notebook independently, isolated. Something reminds me of rocking back
and forth.

It's the same with atmosphere as with cyberspace: _there is no there 
there._ Not even flux exists; flux buries itself, just as time has ceased,
just as space has seized.

Landlocked space thrusts out from the body, gathers evidence and detail as
the perimeter increases; in three dimensions, detail, always out of reach,
increases as the cube of the radius. There is never enough detail, or too
much - on one hand, it is filtered and collapsed, and on the other, it is
the only thing that can return us from the engine of air.

I do not know any of you. Monitoring the list of subscribers, I find 
always new names, new transformations, a few constants, text peering out
in what I have called the state of "hysteric embodiment," reading beyond
description into the semblance of flesh. I write, inscribe, into the text
which retards the engine of air, as virtual particles retard the vacuum,
no greater, no less. And no greater.

At thirty-one thousand feet, the engine continues through the flux of the
Net. The machinery sputters beneath me, satellite machinery tethered to
the governing bodies of the order of angels. Pure vector...

There is no detail detailed. Only what the body embraces, the reach of the
arms and legs, tethers us to - here I am lost, speaking from within, to 
the extent that speech itself issues, taken for granted, within the organs
of hearing and sight. I can chatter my way through the Net.

I can chatter my way through the debris of detail, through the engines of
air, adding unnecessary fuel. The cone of detail, like Minkowski's, speci-
fies the unreachable, but here the kernel is both miniscule and obdurate.
It is a material poverty, overcome by no amount of tacit knowledge.

Writing in space, I write against time; taking my time, I wage against
space, tethered to it at thirty-one thousand feet. The plane continuously
falls as the earth recedes, but at a cost, never freely. I am reading
Bruno Latour and Michel Serres. I have never followed anyone, never that
close for an embrace.

Nothing is sufficiently detailed.


Michel Serres: 

"Thus I developed the habit, which you may find strange, of learning phil-
osophy elsewhere than in the places where it was allegedly taught. I 
learned almost everything on the outside and almost nothing on the inside.
Yes - we can safely put it that way - everything on the outside, almost
nothing on the inside."

"When you have no affiliations and want above all to avoid them, when you
have no home and cannot live anywhere, you are very much obliged to begin
a project. All my life I have had the distressful feeling of wandering in
the desert or on the high seas. And when you are lost and it is stormy,
you quickly feel the need to build a raft or a boat or an ark - even an
island - solid and consistent, and to supply it with tools, with objects,
with shelters, and to people it with characters...doesn't philosophy con-
sist of such a series of domestic improvements? Later, whoever wants can
seek shelter there."

"'Where are you?' 'What place are you talking about?' I don't know, since
Hermes is continually moving on. Rather, ask him, 'What roadmap are you
in the process of drawing up, what networks are you weaving together?'
No single work, neither substantive nor verb, no domain or speciality
alone characterizes, at least for the moment, the nature of my work. I 
only describe relationships."

(From Michel Serres with Bruno Latour, Conversations on Science, Culture, 
and Time.)


How much I identify with Serres, with Serres' project, as if I, too, were
a wanderer, continually unrooted, uprooted, constantly displaced. I have
never been one to believe in anything, identify with place, site, first or
second person. Air passes through the body, the mouth both input and 
cloaca, this becoming memory, its immediacy. There is no story to tell
here.

There is no story to tell except that which is just out of reach, a real
comprehension of knot-theory as an example, or a discourse which would be
recognized as such by all parties involved. Most of on-line sexuality 
involves the replacement of one body by another, the familiarity of one's
own becoming a surrogate for the comfort of an abandoned lover who awakens
at night with identical dreams. Cybermind is full of dreams and visions,
a _sight_ where detail collapses, not expands, and where everything and 
nothing are simultaneously out of reach. For whatever is in reach, _is,_
and whatever is present is in reach. Beyond the interstices and their 
links, there are no details, no interstices, and the granularity of cyber-
mind remains _of a size,_ quantum, irreducible. Only speed makes up for
difference, the compression and decompression of a file giving the illu-
sion of the continuous. Detail appears to increase by subterfuge; every-
thing is laid out the same, everything is carried by everything else. 

The flight is now _hurtling_ towards Los Angeles, the vector purified
above the clouds, the surroundings remaining comfortably familiar; even 
a crash at this point (I look out the window and see the engine on fire!)
would play out as always already memory - but there is this, in addition,
the feeble play of light recorded as the brain begins to die. I realize
I don't want to be there for the _effect,_ the light at the end of the 
tunnel, neurons winking out, consciousness holding forth, blithering, 
until the last possible moment. I've seen the film too many times; there
are no details, and, limbless, there's nothing to reach, and limbed, there
probably never was.

Details! Details!

The Most Difficult Path


Taking or writing away during the reading of air
When nothing is given. Play or air combine. A leaf
Gives belief. The song begins to lose itself.
The song says: I once had a mouth to live in,
And now I wander exhausted, you have forgotten this.

Because you did not hear it, because of the reading
of air.

An engine is anything which irreversibly transforms epistemology.

An irreversible transformation implicates the temporality of the subject.

Science is a tolerance-engine.

Before the nineteenth-century, something was true. Later, something was
true as-if (Vaihinger, even Bentham). Now, something is true within a
given.

An engine expands the domain of the given and contracts the tolerance.

An engine drives an engine.

Michel et moi

I have been reading the Michel Serres Conversations books (w/ Bruno
Latour) and noticed a number of similarities with my own work. Does this
make me a fan? I've followed Serres' work for years, but the parallels are
still peculiar: He chooses Lucretius for example and I run around with
Diogenes Laertius. He talks about a mathematical underpinning to his work
in the sense of articulations, and my own proceeds out of the same to some
extent, coupled with interests in logic. He talks about multiplicity in
Genesis, which is something (spew, emission, inscription) that I have
worked with for years as well. He describes leaps of interconnectivities,
the past not being quite-so but imminent and relevant, which is also the
case for my work, using texts ranging from Gilgamesh and earlier to cur-
rent thinking, Serres himself. He takes offense at the label "poetry" for
his texts, on the grounds that it involves a radical misinterpretation -
and I've run up against the same. He is bothered by his work being consi-
dered shallow or inept, because the leaps fail to spell out their inter-
mediary steps - I've had the same difficulty. He rejoices in the liminal
or peripheral, and so do I. He collapses reading almost into the multi-
plicity of a substance which denies totality, as do I and Flaubert in his
St-Antoine, which has always been influential. He follows his own path,
helter-skelter through literature, mathematics, science, finding it always
fruitful and intensified in this fashion, and I do as well. So that I can
turn to Serres, now Michel, now _tu,_ and protest or rejoice affinity? 
Such is hardly the case. So that I can inflate myself with comparison to a
reasonably well-known Continental thinker? This is a source of hyperbolic
embarrassment to me. So that I can write this text, muse on uncanny simil-
arities, hope for future dissemination (the metaphor is deliberate)? This 
gets closer. So that I can learn from his texts? No more than I have 
learned from any other. So that I could convince him to read my own? No 
more this possibility than the crisis of identity which never resolves 
but is simply defused, _defuged,_ forgotten.

How we know what's between our legs:

We know the earth moves during an earthquake because the inertial moment
of our vestibular apparatus is thrown off simultaneously with nearby cords
subservient to conservation of angular momentum. And we know the earth
moves because such angular momentum leads to differential torsions in the
midst of the apparatus of everyday life. And we know because such torsions
produce overshot realignments resulting further in acoustic phenomena as
material thresholds are surpassed among stressed and adjacent materials.
And we know because electrostatic energy fields are altered as friction
produces the migration of charges to surfaces, the greater the surface
area in relation to the interior, the greater the charge. And we know
because stress-related faults sever conduits, breaking electrical and
optical linkages to the world outside. And we know because our bodies are
of great transforming, and we identify such movement with sexuality,
libido, passion, forbearance, and elastic or abrupt transformations. We
know the earth moves during an earthquake because we song chthonic, Honey
Weatherby la la, Clara Internet la la, because we song La Smoky Sunset,
because of frond-wine, whined palms, stabilized vorticies among the spears
as the wind blows smoke, blows down soot from the burning hills. And we
know because of Clara Hielo come where the stones melt bones and chills
torn forgotten We know this change of earthquake because we've spoken
through alarms in dark Clara night, plumes of Tiffany dawn, Weatherby
dusk. The drink edged towards the lip of the glass. The lips parted.

Dreaming


Every item placed as if it were always remembered for its use and the
name to which it belongs.

Propitiation carried the namesake of the day and each and every night.

Losses became elsewhere the nourishment of being and each way reflected
every other.

Resonances became swollen with resonances, occupying culture's frayed 
edges, naming the territories.

Between the stars there were more stars, and between them, incommensur-
able void.

This was the place of names, no visible source of light, the fulfillment
of: Olber's paradox, a direction which murmured the world. 

If Olber had been right there would have been a world of comfort; if 
Hoyle had been right, so much fulfillment!

Articulation from equivalent distances, and distances.

None.

Trapped!


I woke up this morning half sleep slamming my eyes down to the carpet
where no one was. Crawled over to the laptop, time to write, time to
ride on the Net, checking in before checking out, the way to Armageddon,
downtown Venice California where the canals ran viral dark decades ago,
another project like Hollwoodland gone bust leaving remnants of beautiful
years and people. That was a sentence to make people fly.

So on the way out the door, turn the machine on for a fond farewell and
found:

The message from Japan like Venice lichen riding in, shaping itself with
bounces, catastrophies, little deaths and violations - misshapen errors,
threatening east, west, north, south with closures/foreclosures, mon-
strosities cutting out the clay forever.

What to do, quickly called a who cybermind to majordomo, to no one at all,
sat back waited for the answers. No one came, no one ever came, I thought,
more murders, earthquake disasters threatening the whole thing down. _What
to do,_ unplug the whole scenario - and nothing came again and again,
nothing coming like desert monsoon, a gap between emptied walls, it was
like that I tell you and I had to take a deep deep breath.

So there it was: error message of violence and terror, no reply from 
majordomo, holding my breath to leave the building and soak in the hard
Los Angeles air. Called up again and again, no response whatsoever - tried
the telephone to one or another collaborator, emptied out as well. Zero
multiplied by zero a million times over, there was no escape. It would 
only take the barrier of _one_ I thought to myself, and wondered if that
was ever to be.

I called, fretted, cyberspace cybermind emptied out like rats from Colum-
bus fearing the onslaughter to come. Onslaught, onslaughter, laughter,
the packets screaming in my ears as I longed to lunge for the door. Was
it for or against, was it dying. The whole eastcoast I thought down in
flames I thought and sent more and more, message to majordomo ship in
distress, passengers sick or dying.

I slashed my way into the heart of the empire, jefferson.village.virginia.
edu, just to see what I could find, dragged out the sub list screaming
beyond any sort of semblance of the human. Found the address, cybermind/
paradigm somewhere in deep Japan where I had never been, and it took only
a control-K to wipe it out in total, not even the residue of memory on the
Jefferson hard-drive waiting for another fall. What was, what would have
been.

But the list was down, majordomo was down, and I ran screaming, myself, 
out the door, and I hope that no human ever has cause to look at that
terror in my eyes. Behind me I could hear the screech of packets looking
for a port, sockets emptied of all confabulation. Behind me everything
rushed nowhere at all. Cyberspace, behind me, an empty vat. Eastcoast up
and down in flames. It took atmosphere, and Los Angeles had plenty of 
that, export or import, it made no difference.

So here I sit in the world of books, no ideas but in things, no things on
or off line, cut off, castrated from the real I think. And whether or not
you get this depends on the damage done and the damage control and the 
lack of both and that lack I discovered for the first time, deep, deep, in
myself. I hope to God you never have to go through this, and I hope, more
than hope, that if you do, you don't survive, any better than myself - a 
shell of a man without hope, an abyss in the heart, something you'd never
comprehend, until you've walked the walk, talked the talk, and that's a 
blue moon on Sunday, get my drift.

Carol


Yesterday, I saw Carol for the first time, after thirty-five years, more
than a third of a century. I knew she was in television, film, and theater;
I came across her over a decade ago in a Mary Tyler Moore show, walking on
the way I remembered her, and there was some Mary in her as well, and 
Colleen and other actresses whom I admired. I had looked for her, on and
off over the years; at the twenty-fifth highschool reunion, she included
an address which led to another dead-end, and no one I knew could locate
her, or had the interest. Or maybe the interest; I'd lost touch with al-
most anyone. But I wanted to know what happened to Carol beyond the images,
and this seemed important and impossible.

(Already the captured tropology of narrative and the saying of it.)

So when I was in the bookstore yesterday at Beyond Baroque and the phone
rang and someone handed it to me and a voice said this is Carol ----, is
this the Alan Sondheim - so when this happened and I interrupted, I'd find
my voice again, and she'd run down to Beyond Baroque at three o'clock high,
thin, and sharp -

And I'd find myself waiting outside the place, waiting for my past to make
sense, for those wounds to heal or at least scar over from the nightmare
that highschool was for me - and I'd be nervously pacing all over the
building unable to concentrate -

So when she came I recognized her, an image-memory, her hair that exact
color of somewhat darkened off-blond that I remembered, her gait the same
and voice the same, no matter what's said - not that youth is still inside
the body whatever the body, whatever the age, but that the body has always
already been there in the absence of time -

So what can I say to further the consequences? That _something happened,_
that we flew into each other's arms? I would have, at a moment's notice; I
was near tears, not with memory but with memory's absence - a meeting out-
side of presence, outside of the imminent; it was the uncanny of cybermind
all over again, something initiated long before -

(Nor could I say this to her, my arms outstretched for another rejection,
our parting kiss cheek to lips at best after hours' conversation. I 
danced the dance on the edge of talk forgotten, the nuance of sun over 
Venice Beach, Pacific at our feet. It wasn't romantic.)

I had looked in all the phonebooks, asked actors and actresses of my ac-
quaintance, she had never married, I knew the solution would be in pre-
sence itself. Duration creates coincidence, shudders history to a halt;
duration did this. She didn't look old or young, she looked like Carol
and talking in a way that led to the margins where the meadows met the
desert, flowers transform into plants thirsted, foreclosed, for nourish-
ment. That is the absence of the forest. Would I have appeared trans-
parent, translucent - would I have become a ghost. I knew I was always a
ghost. I knew she would never want me. I knew she couldn't give me part
of my history because what she gave me was _history's absence._

I knew that there was no history, not that it was all right or illumina-
ting in any way. She had no children, had a career that fluctuated like
mine, major roles then nothing, as in a contrary or wayward person, as in
contradiction but not suture, not a path, not directionless. I'm moving
towards a state.

(I have always understood that there is nothing to learn.)

I'm moving towards a state where this matters, where there is no repeti-
tion because my desire continues to circulate, inscribe me, this dissolu-
tion that remains ungrounded, recognizing foundation's absence. I'm moving
towards a state where after thirty-five years, I can create a pivot, where
the depression that comes with cyberspace is deflected in the recognition
of irreality, split-screen and split-skin, neither interior nor exterior.
And I'm moving towards a state where movement remains, remnant or residue,
not ever a truth to be seen, experienced, lost and restored by a telephone
call from a long absent, long missed, searched-for, friend.

The state: that we inhabit the imaginary, that it's the symbolic that 
leaks, and not the other way around, not even, especially not even, in 
cybermind where all we have is sticks and stones for letters.

The dissolution of the classic nation-state. The absence of the state. 
Fuzzy states. What can never be stated. Who Carol is and is not. Where 
Carol has been, what Carol has done. What has occurred in an interval of
thirty-five years. The length of the interval. The length of the next
interval. The length ofthe next.

American Tabloid


I figured I'd finish American Tabloid flying out of Los Angeles back down
to New York but didn't figure I'd finish it here in the city at 5 am in
the morning. LA-lala was Net all the way, nodes and penetrations, trans-
parencies among sites, channeled flows down freeways across homeowners'
firewalled fences designed to protect cordoned neighborhoods from _them_
- oh but you know all that. 

But American Tabloid by James Ellroy doubled the stakes/Net imaginary:
Corruption is everywhere within it, sites are always already imminent, 
passion rains terror and ecstasy. But it is a mystery or a story with no
surprises, which is the trajectory of the real, or rather what is a sur-
prise to the characters is no surprise to us; we know where Kennedy was
shot before they do for example.

And it's a deeper analysis for all Ellroy's real-life bluster, of simul-
ac America, than Baudrillard could ever produce - deeper because of the
deaths and drugs involved and the sheer interiority of bodies. And the 
sites, Netted landscape more cyber for all its street-transport, than 
Gibson, I think because of the uneasy quality there and available. Right
now outside the fireworks are turning violent; it's Fourth of July, ready
or not for example.

That's why we get along in this space - because for those of us in the
States, it's already familiar - only you can't get AIDS or killed through
the screen, yet. We're becoming a nation of posturers, sweeping people of
color aside as quickly as possible as the Rehnquist Supreme Court returns
to the post-reconstruction era and its segregation clampdown. We'll see
what we want and see only at a distance.

And try as hard as we can, distance is something that comes with the Net,
only we're on the other side, trying to get in.

What the Engine Does, of the Anorectic Airliner


The Engine swallows the air; it is the point at which the movement of air
and its dispersion begins. This is an act of devouring, gorging, the buli-
mic cycle which collapses as the world is absorbed. It is a transformation
into substance as the Engine appropriates the foundations of the signifier
for itself. What an appropriation! The Engine inscribes the absorbed world
in an exhaust trail. The Engine parallels the photon; it refuses position
as the tokenization of existence; it exists as movement and collapse. Thus
it flies and desires the air. Thus it appropriates and seduces the air,
through an act of violence which retains its position of flight. For that
which would escape it, Engine, cruise missile, bomb, what is being said
but the "I" of the engine, within a dialectic of seduction? Seduction in
which the Origin is proclaimed, and that is the metric established as
Origin, the location of the phallus. The cruise missile cocks its head,
gives it to the world. It is semen which is disorganized; the world burns
into paste through an atmosphere of paste, through an Engine of paste. The
world burns, the Engine burns, swells, disgorges; it is the world returned
to vomit. The anorectic airliner shudders (therefore shudders);  the line
of flight is re-established. Such an establishment with markings in the
sky! Such a sky that establishes itself as a graph with mobile coordin-
ates, exhaust that indicates while it dissipates, is absorbed in the
clutter of the air. The tiny Engine! The presence of Flight! The erection
in the sky and the charred earth! It is the appearance of the microtech-
nological once again, the bacteriophage with its consonant and identical
units. It is an empty circle. It is the exhaustion of repetitive expan-
sion.

Socrates


"Moreover, in his old age he learnt to play the lyre, declaring that he 
saw no absurdity in learning a new accomplishment. As Xenophon relates
in the _Symposium,_ it was his regular habit to dance, thinking that such
exercise helped to keep the body in good condition. He used to say that
his supernatural sign warned him beforehand of the future; that to make a
good start was no trifling advantage, but a trifle turned the scale; and
that he knew noting except just the fact of his ignorance." (Diogenes 
Laertius)

Translation Hicks (Loeb), but supernatural sign = _daimonion_ here, and 
what are we to make of this? For his philosophy, close to the beginning 
of everything, was one of ethical conduct; that _otherwise,_ as in the
Tractatus of Wittgenstein, was either consigned to silence or produced 
as aura. Listen:

"For Favorinus in his _Miscellaneous History_ says Socrates and his pupil
Aeschines were the first to teach rhetoric; and this is confirmed by Ido-
meneus in his work on the Socratic circle. Again, he was the first who
discoursed on the conduct of life, and the first philosopher who was 
tried and put to death." (ibid.)

"Then if I believe in supernatural beings, as you assert, if these super-
natural beings are gods in any sense, we shall reach the conclusion which
I mentioned just now when I said that you were testing my intelligence 
for your own amusement, by stating first that I do not believe in gods, 
and then again that I do, since I believe in supernatural beings." 
(Plato, Apology, Hamilton/Cairns edition)

The Timaeus complicates things; the creator says "Wherefore, since ye are
but creatures, ye are not altogether immortal and indissoluble, but ye
shall certainly not be dissolved, nor be liable to the fate of death, 
having in my will a greater and mightier bond than those with which ye
were bound at the time of your birth." This before the creation of the
three tribes of mortal beings. (ibid.)

I am confused by daemons, by Socrates' daemon, by his relation to godhead,
by the Apology and the remnants of what drove him everywhere, and for all
time. I am missing something that inserts itself in the midst of the ques-
tions, something that has to do with the inauguration of a certain concept
of the West. Look at Jowett's introduction to his translation of the Re-
public, where he speaks of the _daimonium,_ or "internal sign, which is
alluded to by Socrates as something peculiar to himself." 

There are both epistemological and ontological questions at work here, and
I am hardly well-versed enough to describe Socrates' beliefs, even through
Xenophon's accounts. Plato himself wanders throughout the Parmenides and
Timaeus and neither sounds like the rational argumentation of the Repub-
lic. Ethics is one thing; mythos is another, with its built-in narrative. 
In any case, the daemon appears as _something else,_ cybermind or residue,
almost an implantation or disturbance. Was the daemon Plato, or Plato Soc-
rates? Who was inserting what?

What did Socrates _see_?

---------------------

Heidegger begins An Introduction to Metaphysics: Why are there essents
rather than nothing? ("Warum ist uberhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr
Nichts?") This question draws forth the same barrier as always; now it is
also a cosmological issue, no closer to the deconstructed Origin. In fact
the questions remain constant, continuous, already present in Aristotle's
Metaphysics - it's only perhaps in the theory of signs, motivated by de-
velopments in logical calculi, that anything like an "advance" has been
made. It becomes necessary to conceive of the work of thinking (somewhat
in the Heideggerian sense) as processes within fuzzy domains. Internal or
neighborhood dialogs are established, with books and other concreted texts
as a form of residue. But the dialogs themselves hurl themselves at death,
only to retreat. The sciences alone (including mathematics) have recogni-
zable progress, based on identifiable and well-definable tolerances; out- 
side, language continues its buzz. Were more texts to survive, say, from 
Sumer or Egypt, it would be even clearer that as Serres would have it, 
nothing is outdated, everything wobbles but the environment which is con- 
tinuing to collapse.

Our neurosis is that we are doomed to repetition; our schizophrenia, that 
we refuse to accept this; our psychosis, that we are blind to it.

For the gods: To have had a body would have been to die.

Thought binds itself to annihilation.

Subject: Maudlin Sentinmental Intellectual Trashy Despair



Friday night is the loneliest night of the week, 
But Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week.

Saturday afternoon is filled with despair wandering in the midst of couples.

In my classes there are no couples but everyone is coupled so they're
tethered, someone somewhere somehow.

Down the street boys and girls together or in pairs there. I'm up here two
floors up so I see them, Dean Street like a scar disappearing on and out. 

I can't get my mind off this. It burns through my work, ruins it.

Heidegger again, right at the beginning, asking "Why are there essents 
rather than nothing," goes on in the next paragraph -

"And yet each of us is grazed at least once, perhaps more than once, by 
the hidden power of this question, even if he is not aware of what is 
happening to him [sic]. The question looms in moments of great despair, 
when things tend to lose al their weight and all meaning becomes obscured."

Yet Levinas insists in these moments on the falling-away of existence 
itself, Kristeva talks about the thing, I think of disinvestment. The Why 
requires energy - there's the rub of it. Anyway, Heidegger goes on:

"Perhaps it will strike but once like a muffled bell that rings into our 
life and gradually dies away. It is present in moments of rejoicing, when 
all the things around us are transfigured and seem to be there for the 
first time, as if it might be easier to think they are not than to 
understand that they are and are as they are."

But of course in joy all questions fall away, not out of lack of interest,
but out of the distraction of existence itself.

Here, nothing. Without the text, fantasy. With the text, repetition com-
pulsion, a basically neurotic relation to the real (not that I haven't 
the capability of infusing the real directly (not that the real is free 
from the symbolic)).

I sit here; it's Friday night. I have the weekend to muse on this. It's 
the loneliest time of the week. It's my maudlin sentimental intellectual 
trashy despair.

Parmenides' Letter to One Unknown


Dear Clara,

I do not blame you for leaving before I screened my recent work. You might
not have liked it, and maybe you knew that and maybe that's why you didn't
stay. You have always spared me, comforting me and remaining outside or
beyond the carapace; you have been the only one to recognize that the 
carapace made no difference. It was there, you explained, that clouds and
symbols scudded across the daylight hours and proceeded into the night,
where they garnered invisibility like the cloaks of darkness surrounding
your skin, your hair, your eyes.

Decades ago I made up my mind to find you, but what purpose would that 
have served; searching is withdrawal, unless one is a detective, sur-
rounded by the world off-line. Finding is always religious; something com-
pletes us, allowing further movement in any direction, always with the 
suture and stasis of the soul itself at hand. And searching and finding
are never the living of the journey itself; that is for weaker spirits who
collapse their fury and intensity into packets convenient for the produc-
tion of books or travelogues. 

Finding is more than a sighting, it is a citing of the flesh as well, the
presence of a body shifting beyond the possibility of illusion. The grain
of the skin, shuttled crystalline slivers of the iris, scintillate in 
light and shadow themselves changing in the arena of other movements, 
what remains incalculable, the chaotic and noisy dissolutions of a reality
I have recovered only in my dreams. Your presence dissolved them as well,
your body a gift of future physics, edgewise sightings of jets, black 
holes, murmuring at the borderlines of consciousness, howling at displays
of ego dragged from the interior of the earth.

Such displays as you would silence, mud-displays, dirt foamed and seething
in the plays and scripts of desires. Decades ago, the healings began and
collapsed as time no longer struggled to matter, through matter, and I
would say, Clara, my contemporary, would say this to myself, sealing bodies
in the absence of bodies. This enabled me, always and forever, to continue
where others were no longer present, in this space of sputtered packets,
your name world-wide and resonant with the planet's breathing. You did 
this for me, and changing names can only return to you resonance's doub-
ling, riemannian surfaces wrapping themselves around us, like the cloak
of skin, flesh, and bones, the daggers of the closing iris in the midst
of the dawn of the night...

Representations of the chora:

What could possibly be the advantage of an image of the chora, which is
of course unrepresentable, so that even the concept turns in upon itself
as if in the form of denial? This of course after Plato, where "recep-
tacle" and nurture play a role.

Clearly the chora is fractured, hollowed, multiple, filled and fulfilled
with virtual collisions, virtual collusions.

Not so clearly it possesses illusory and problematic depths. Within, the
dawn of the night of signifiers, broken edges of graphemes - within and
without, a certain uncertain distribution of the poetic.

Clearly there are partial inscrptions, the uncanny beginnings of the 
proper name, colorless, this matter of intensities.

Clearly these intensities beginning their emergence as things and objects
of the world, a certain uncertain darkness at noon.

Not so clearly, this space which flattens, increases in depth, pulsates,
in response to the position, site of the viewer's sight, who refuses to
cite, who has released hirself to cite.

So I imagine a sheet, taut, almost to the breaking point, nonetheless
curved, stretched from horizon to horizon, edges and edge-phenomena close
to invisible, laminar, or not quite.

Which is never possible on a terminal screen, but only as an extrapolation
which is also clearly self-defeating. Nonetheless...

and there are others as well, extensions/intensions, still in process of
development which... are not quite suitable for public access... as the
chora remains... within a certain darkness or interpolation of the sym- 
bolic... crushed, what might be a form of intension.

These Images, These Stuttered Dissolutions


The diagrams create both the gaze of the subject and the fetishization
of space as a result of the gaze; a wager of fixed proportions is con-
structed. The space looms, cut, invisibly thin, the result of a sheet
inscribed with its own geodesics; it's here that words are wrapped into
the fabric of space. The viewer/voyeur becomes limner against the visage
of unadulterated interiority, protuberances. The stuttered effect of the
strips plays cinema across surfaces increasingly incoherent, unraveling
at the edges. The edges are only the means of inscribing the invisible;
they play the role of standards against which heteroglossia occurs.

The game is that of the fisher of signs, not symbols, waylaid traps among
uncanny visitations. The game occurs by processing parameters which tend
towards inconceivable unfoldings, the glimpse of flesh, desire manifest
through the torsion of psychoanalytical space, minus analysis, blocked
and corrupted.

The scar image is inserted into the graphic of the earth, mercator pro-
jection; the scar twists the planet into inconceivable geographies. Such
images are intensifications of topography, not simulacra or leakages, 
but the precise control of dissolution, lending themselves to constraint,
frameworking, protocols.

"The Other crossed through (0) stands against this knowledge in the place
of division where meaning falters, where it slips and shifts. It is the
place of _signifiance,_ Lacan's term for this very movement in language
against, or away from, the positions of coherence which language simulta-
neously constructs. The Other therefore stands against the phallus - its
pretence to meaning and false consistence. It is from the Other that the
phallus seeks authority and is refused." (Jacqueline Rose, Introduction
II to Jacques Lacan, Feminine Sexuality)

To search for the proper image for overlay: construct a path, inscription,
through the message bases, in the form of a hunt or retrieval: recupera-
tion of excess as the plane transforms into a contusion, bend, the victim
or procedure of a psychoanalytical tensor calculus. 

Nothing is sutured until you, dear reader, blind yourself to the calculus
of language, reopening your eyes to decipherment, from that which is found
at ftp://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/pub/pubs/listservs/spoons/cyber-

Internet Questions

Where can I find an mpeg viewer that doesn't require a videoboard? Are
soundboards really necessary for all audio applications? Is Eudora
superior to Pine or the other way around? Why doesn't the Pico editor
allow me to jump to the end of a file? Is there any reason to download
linux to a home computer? What's a good telnet application for Trumpet
Winsock? Where does the name Trumpet Winsock come from? What is the
difference in download time for Mosaic and Netscape? What is the
difference between Netscape 1.1 and 1.2 beta? What is an AVI file and are
there AVI readers and if so, can they run without a videoboard? Does
anyone know the current legal status of gif? Is there a way to move into
the interior of a gif file and edit it directly? Can someone recommend a
decent uuencoder and uudecoder for DOS? 

Internet Securities

I worry about the tenuous nature of email lists in relation to the invest-
ment made in them by numerous subscribers. For this reason, I think it
worthwhile that all of us download the subscriber lists every so often, so
that if there is a disk crash or the necessity of setting up elsewhere,
the list could be reconstituted. To obtain the list, of course, write to
majordomo@jefferson.village.virginia.edu and say, in the body of the post,
who cybermind or who fiction-of-philosophy; once you have the list,
download and save. If the list goes down permanently, in the event of war
or other international catastrophe, create an alias file in your address-
book, and place the list there; enter it at the Bcc: option when sending 
out a post. To access Bcc: in Pine, when your cursor is in the header, 
type ^R, control-R and the rich-header will appear. Although it may 
appear that I am being facetious, I have learned in my short life not to 
trust the world.

A Woman


Were I to have been born, I would have been born woman, I would have lived
solely within the society of women, I would not have known male, I would
have circumscribed male. From the center which would have been ellipsoid,
I would have circumscribed male, from this center which would have been
surface, depth, interior, from this surface which would have been emission,
emanation. From the exterior I would not have know fear, pain, aggression,
the absence of nurturing, the cold spray on the edges of the face, and from
the exterior I would have known edges, walked through their toppled geome-
try. And from the edges I would have dreamed of plinths and broken arms, I
would have dreamed of breasts warmed from marble enclosures, and I would
have dreamed of the spaces between the breasts and the arms descending, 
pointing, opening up to their spaces of the other, which would not ever
have inscribed the rough spray on the cheek of a sailor male, but the 
smooth cheek of a woman tending the boat towards each and every destina-
tion of her choice. I would have been that woman tending the boat, gazing
across and through the bow to the filtered green-blue sea beneath; I would
have wandered the furrows of that sea in the search of a shell for the 
voice of the woman I would have loved forever. I would have heard her in
the lineaments of the shell, in the folds among the hinging and calcium
concavities worn smooth as well by the wind, like my cheek against the 
wind, worn smooth of many colors subdued in the face of the deep, and the
oars and oarlocks of the boat, the tillers and calking of the catboat set
into the water like a jewel in the ring of my lover walked through the
deep with me. Would I have been born a woman with the shore and the steps
and slopes beyond, would I have darkened the bottom of the sea, phosphor-
escent me, would I have circumscribed the male.

Wooden shaft of the color of the sea, wooden shaft of the color of the sea,
turn the moon around, turn the moon around. Unfurled marine of the oak,
of the grain dark with longing for the depths stilled near the vents orange 
with the promise of life, life seeping among the strata of the rocks far 
from shore, unfurled ferrules of the shaft, remember the bowed petals of
the flowers of haunted memory, redolent with the turn of the living. Life
alone reminds itself, merged with the kelp and sea-oak, drawn from the 
shore and the winds nested in the midst of winds. Oh to have been born a 
woman and long riding on the sea, and oh, to have dwelled near the floor
tracked of silt and longing, nothing but the others kept out, seahorses
raveled in my hair, anglerfish among my many limbs ...

Ground Control


Shuttled information travels during electron orbits stuttering themselves
around broken space, smeared in orbital clouds; running with a fury, 
they're too simple to concern themselves with the wolves of winter. Down
elsewhere, ground control parcels the space of the body near the machinery
which connects, throughputs, to Japan, Australia, stains thrown across the
civilized world. The civilized world:

/defined by protocols, etiquette, organized in steps paced with the clock
breath, thresholds gathering information as clocks underpace/outpace the
_other._
/intensifications of lines, traces, ashes, inscriptions, speech acts, 
procurements, endocolonizations, simulacra, labia, phalli, packets, data- 
grams, petit a's, habiti, emissions: electron pipelining dividing the
natural as a point in two-dimensional space, not even an obstacle.

Ground control loses force as graphemes and analytical divisions, survey-
ings, gather across the landscape dominated by the gnomon. What measures,
measures itself, expends itself; what travels, speaks, dissembles. What
means this spending of an _alterior economy,_ that of the other? Ground
control speaks, loses control, divides the boundaries, folds inward, in
the matter of the _curl._

The Shuttle will land in the curl. The Shuttle will be comforted.

"The Last Judgment, which so tortured the Middle Ages and which our day
has forgotten so absolutely, is no mere invention of selfish and uneducated
monks. The Last Judgment is the supreme reality. In moments - their rare
moments - of illumination - even our positive thinkers feel this. The Last
Judgment decides whether there shall be freedom of will, immortality of
the soul, or not - whether there shall be a soul, or not. And, maybe, even
the existence of God is still undecided. Even God waits, like every living
human soul, on the Last Judgment." (Lev Shestov, In Job's Balances)

__________________________________________________________________________


Losing Ground Control (The Glutton)


"The task of philosophy is to tear itself loose from life during life, if
only in part. And even as man comes into the world wailing, or awakes with
a cry from a torturing fever dream, so too the transition from life to 
death must clearly be accompanied by a senseless, desperate effort whose
proper expression will also be a senseless, desperate cry or a wild sob. I
think that many philosophers have known such an 'awakening' and have tried
to tell of it." (Lev Shestov, In Job's Balances)

In the heat, it exhausts itself, the lists get old, decayed, there's noth-
ing going on here, people write papers, no one comments, it's more impor- 
tant to discuss the weather, the energy seems low, it's my fault, my de- 
pression's contagious, perhaps there's nothing more to say, cyberspace 
exhausts itself quickly, perhaps the details are elsewhere, perhaps we're 
all too unread to continue any further - in the heat, ground control is
lost, you can see the waves of energy focused at the source, dissipating,
spreading like ripples in a pond, the earth heats up momentarily, cools, 
cool juxtapositions, there's a dampening-effect, until silence slopes in-
ward - in the heat, tears boil off the eyes, liquids coat the body, quick
evaporation, the skin in a constant state, turmoil, of transmission - but
to return to my subject, the lists, these lists - for example gender - 
where are the theories, analyses, references, the differences of language,
response, transgressions, intromissions on the net - already memory refuses
to serve me, cool dispatch, back from the warzone - here everything's safe,
dispassionate passion or discussion which in the heat it exhausts itself, I

I curl in the heat of the shuttle, look forward to the exchange, am desper-
ate for calculi, the argument of ontology, epistemology, the argument of
foundations, of deconstructions, argument of post-structuralisms, argument
of structure itself, structure and substructure, text and infratext, this
all-too-even prose, this tone of explication -

Who Are You


In the middle of the night, oppressive heat, billowed clouds, etc., I get
a post: Do you write to strangers? Replying, I hear nothing for months,
then more cryptic allusions. Elsewhere, I find that X has unsubbed because
of the presence of Another on the list. These categories deserve attention.
Who out there in the midst of the continents writes under the sign of the
unknown?

The writings displace themselves as they come in, each linked to the 
other/s in the in-box. Or else they efface each other, as escape codes
corrupt files, reduce the whole to blank and irretrievable sequences, not
quite through careful filtering. But here, who are you?, something else
occurs, effacement which places itself as the crossed-sign of god, woman,
phallus, being - neither a circumlocution nor a translation. I assume the
posts originate from one or more of the four, and I'd eliminate the phal-
lic which shudders under the weight of its Lacanian name, or not: there's
always the literal consideration of outlawry for example, militiamen as
well for whom secrecy is as rigid as... 

I've lost sense here; neither man or woman nor both, or the presence of a
god perhaps, all being - the posts don't generate themselves, they don't
sound like bots. Honey says it's sexist perhaps to place gender among 
them, but Honey also acknowledges that it's the _site_ of the phallus or
the woman (as if there were _the_ woman, in discourse or otherwise) that's
at work, nor is it a question of sight or Lacan's masquerade, but simply
absence - or why are these posts signed with the sign of gender in the
first place?

Do you write to strangers? If I write to you, am I, are you, a stranger?
What constitutes the familiarity of a return - particularly in the age of
transnational capital, when the seriality of Sartre continues operational
- these inauthentic displays of false intimacy. Unlike the "hugs Clara 
with a warm and loving embrace" of the MOO - attempting to coerce the 
body in the realm of the symbolic (and all those issues of embodiment/
disembodiment which come into play) - the intimacy of _writing to a 
stranger_ remains just that, foreclosed, the _imminent_ presentification 
of power (always already at hand, but here, determinative).

But it is the night that gives them meaning, the voice-out-of-nowhere, as
artificial light after dark gives meaning (by virtue of its intention) to
those appearing within it, the television or cinema screen, the nightclub, 
the presumed intimacy of the livingroom, bedroom, bathroom, illuminated
bodies and sexualities. The posts appear out-of-nowhere; they signify no-
where, no matter how much they are ultimately configured. Just as I, you,
all of us, Tiffany, are configured out of nowhere, returning nowhere, on
our journey to nowhere, beneath the sign of nowhere, which is not even the
sign of capital, late or not, and hardly even a sign, except that it is 
such by virtue of the investment which we grant (ourselves) to it: Do you
write to strangers, do you write?

If a friend or a child who is a friend desires to find the means for pro-
curing the elements of a poison guaranteed to frighten all within the 
vicinity of feigned death, it is no more difficult than if a child or a
friend of a child designs to ascertain the appearance of others without
the protective raiment of everyday wear by means of procuring such imple-
ments of infrared observation as are obtainable at any espionage outlet.

And if a young woman deigns to seduce an older man by means of bouquets
which delight and ennervate the sensory apparatus accustomed to years of
normal practice, it is no more than the dialup of a world wide web server
plying its wares across the electronic skyway bringing democracy and the
edges of the personality to every neighborhood of your house and my own.

Now if a young man places his designs upon the smaller animals of the
self-same neighborhood, he may look no farther than the transfer of files
of mystery and ecstasy exquisitely formatted for the members of the fe-
line race, behavior outposts signalling the canine-kind entrance into 
rampant vandalism and thugees.

Thus if a tiny boy desires the services of an older woman past her time
and degree of hormonal sexualism pursuant to the creaton of creatures 
like himself, he may purvey gerontological postings to medical data-bases
subsumed by men whose hairlines, like his own, leave much to be desired,
by themselves, himself, or those who fall fallow of his troubled dreams.

Thus if a young man were walking by the woods on a day in summer, he would
happen to stop by the side of a rivulet where others of his kind bathed
naked, clean and smoothed bodies slipping like silver fish beneath the
shores and banks, and so lined with tiny roots meandering down to the sur-
plus of liquid for the taking, the asking, with infinite kindness.

Thus would the animal and vegetable kingdoms and queendoms celebrate with
haste, undue the freeing of desires upon which the eyelids leave their 
trace, images found hovering just outside or beyond the bordering of posts
to realms unknown, mossy dreams spoken of by fallen leaves of trees, the 
moisture gathered together where one, young or old, has implemented visage
with unholy truths, stirrings on the surface of the world, murmurings of 
its depths.

Future developments of the email lists:

1. Setting up of a MOO or MUD for at least partial operation, synchronous
multi-party use. Partial operation: The MOO would run at on a fixed
schedule or at pre-announced times. It would be connected with elist 
archives. It would be capable of suspension and document insertion. Does
anyone want to organize this?

2. Development and use of the cybermind/fop archives, which are reachable
through ftp://pub/pubs/listservs/spoons/ . These should be expanded; if
there's not sufficient disk-space, perhaps someone could take up the 
slack elsewhere?

3. Possible audio applications: Netphone or complementary list devoted to
audiofiles, not archived. I imagine a future email list as voices in a
darkened room, flashes of images on an otherwise invisible screen.

4. Mpeg and other file attachments - using the dmpeg viewer for video in
DOS at the least. Files must be kept to a minimum, low-priority, in order
to keep bandwidth down.

5. Jpeg and other file attachments - supplying a small jpeg/gif viewer.

6. Web pages - Anyone want to design one? Could Netphone etc. be built
into these? Again, there would be space limitations, unless someone wants
to set one up and maintain it at their site (Marius' site is closing).

7. What encourages community? What encourages discussion (data-base and
other resources. The use of multiple linked sites/application, public
ftp, for example. Would the production of an e-magazine be either realis-
tic or relevant?

8. Use of aliased configurations, sublists, etc. - what's possible? Do
sublists reduce or complement elists?

9. Purposes/mandates: What should be the long-term goals of an email list?
Should there be any? Can one speak generally about this? Should there be a
point when elists should be dissolved? What should be the future of cyber-
mind and fiction-of-philosophy?

These questions are both general (applicable to all elists) and specific 
to cybermind/fop. Should we involve subscribers in extending the lists in
one or more of the above directions? Does anyone want to take any of them
on? Let us know ...

Symptoms


(By and large in the form of the interrogative, not interrogating the
symptom, but the site of inscription itself.)

The recent Freud and post-Freudian history of psychoanalysis is not only
a history of theory, and therapies; it is also a history of symptoms and
illness as well. And one can see a transformation from the moment of hys-
teria through that of anomie, to the moment of schizophrenia, and now, 
reading through Kristeva's New Maladies of the Soul, to that of distur-
bances of representation as well. These transformations are _of_ what, 
against what matrix, what healthy interiority? For if everything remains 
on the level of representation, even through hysteria (inscription of 
trauma) and schizophrenia (holarchic inscriptive sememes), then what co-
herency would be said to constitute health in such a manner as evading 
enlightenment rationality? Does representation, in fact, go all the way 
down into and within the inchoate? - in which case, given their pre-logi-
cal status (which continues all the way up), are these illnesses and their 
interiority (interiorities?) _a continuum of injuries_ as the psychic 
apparatus applies its developing strategies to continually evolving situa-
tions?

And what happens if the structuralism itself is removed, as the healthy
interior is found to be nothing, in fact, but a representation through
such injuries? - Is there a deconstructive (non-) narrative in relation to
this? For example, the Lacanian symbolic or imaginary - when there are
already ontological subversions of both vis-a-vis a techne which itself
is no longer techne?

Then, and in what sense - this debris that accumulates, this organism 
against the organization of the real (apparent in its repetitions, order-
liness), this exhaustive debris?

-------------------------------------

In other words - not only does the concept of mental illness change in
time, but the prevalent illnesses also undergo transformation. Do these
reflect a continually transforming psychic core - in which case, what is
the basis of such transformations; how are interior and exterior admixed
- or do they in fact contain representations of an psychic core that is
itself only existing as such representations? If schizophrenia is a 
splitting of "a" self, and hysteria an inscribing of "a" body, are self
and body other than representations through the schizophrenic and hys-
teric? And finally, if we are now concerned with illnesses of representa-
tion (and affect, disassociation), what is the core of the inscription at
work here? I would argue that it is a form of _technique,_ that technique
exists among self and body, that all three are continually inscribed and
reinscribed, and that accumulation characterizes their interaction - an
accumulation splitting them apart into images of health and illness, vis-
a-vis the psychoanalytical profession and power in the Foucauldian sense.
