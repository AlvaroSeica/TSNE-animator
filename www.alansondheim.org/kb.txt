The weather began to turn around the beginning of November. I dreamed
of fire, sparks flying in the night across the wooden houses. We were
jammed against the cemetary, bad luck in any season; Hokusai's ghosts
spoke across hideous red lanterns, their teeth waiting for the skin to
fall. Fukuoka was ruptured by uneasy presences; the foreign community
talked and talked, waiting for something to happen. Rumblings from 
Eastern City penetrated Nine-States Island. These were the States at
that juncture:

State-of-Hand-Joined-to-the-Body
State-of-Being-Perfectly-Not-Here
State-of-Disconsolate-Thought-of-Wings
State-of-Hand-Not-Joined-to-the-Body
State-of-Beauty-Futon-Winter-Comfort
Electric-State-of-Coming-Wonders
State-of-Seeing-You-Around-About
Eighth-State-of-Fukuoka-City
State-of-Siege-of-Hardly-Kanji

Eastern City was in State-of-This-Main-Origin-of-Book, still spring, I
would say still April, the murmur of brook-larks heard high in Shinto
trees. For truth, I did not recognize talons where hands were joined,
words wired to electrical wonders not yet evidenced on the way from 
Kyoto to Fuji, by way of Wheat-Rice-Island. Thinking of wings, I flew,
these were my thoughts:

Winged Thoughts, Iron Thoughts, Fire Thoughts, Singed Thoughts, River-
Water Thoughts, Electric-Coming-Wonder-Thoughts.

There were seven flowers, six elements, perfect nights. In Northern-
Nine-State-City, it was autumn, late-blooming chrysanthemum engraved
on lacquer-bone poet-box, crane-flight, swimming-turtle careful gold
design. I would write wonder-haiku,

one two sorrow five
six mountain eight pine ten e-   x
leven twelve autumn four-      x
                             ox oo
and win honor at go-moku, xxxxx o  in summer-Kurume, waiting near Wide
Island, very many tower down to Nagasaki. For to be sure, I was fast
disappearing. I dreamed of fire, sparks flying in the night. I dreamed
of wooden houses. I dreamed of shogi sets, the sound of game pieces
scraped across the wooden boards.

I dreamed of the fluttering of go boards, the sound of stone-and-shell
game pieces scraped across the hollow tables. I dreamed of mother-of-
pearl orderings from Eastern City, dreamed of the Origin of All Things,
dreamed of State-of-Siege.

Clara in Fukuoka


Tall and stately Clara walks into the Darkroom.
Clara dominates the stage, Clara's eyes are samurai daggers.
Samurai have no daggers, pointed out by Travis glaring fiercely.
Travis moves to a corner of the room; he's nervous.
There are drinks falling off the edges of the tables.
There are drunks fucking off the edges of the tables.
Someone requests Hole again and again until the player breaks.
She reaches for a silver cigarette.
It's finely made mesh-of-an-afternoon good gaijin smoke.
Travis glares; he's high on thought and screaming.
Travis is screaming inside.
Here are the words of Travis' scream: Wah wa wa wa.
He turns slowly towards the door, careful avoidance of Clara-stiletto.
She moves.
She doesn't know what she's doing, fucked up on methamphet.
The light swings cause of an earthquake.
It's the biggest earthquake ever in Japan.
Sparks fly from the CD, Hole crashes to the floor.
Now or never.
Clara whips out dagger-stiletto, cuts his veins.
Before it's over in a blue moment.
Travis falls towards table-rim kanji-cut, you can read iroiro iraira.
Rim-job Travis topples as aftershock levels Fukuoka Tower.
Tower, baby, tower.
Everywhere in town sparks and wires down.
Crash-land Canal City flames cause of the earthquake.
Travis dead, Clara screams shampoo, here is what she screams:
Wah wa wa
Wah wa wa
Wah wa wa
Wah wa wa.

Julu wanders Chiyo; it's night, there are dragonnes beyond
Ears of Buddha wings, there are sighs from jinja pond
You don't go beyond.
There are dark waves, valves, not fucking Hokusai sweet Hiroshige -
What gaijin know of art can't be placed on bamboo map
Or prefecture off it, the map where - how can I write mishap
Of Julu, what she found, crashed pottery - there was blood
Between the cracks (tan dust) from three thousand or more
Years of Jericho, but this was elsewhere, temple store,
Three squares for goods. She died. There were hoods
Down the street. They thought she was meat.

Bourdieu Note

[That what appears cleansed from within, the purity of form and con-
tent, is context within the habitus. See The Field of Cultural Pro-
duction  and Language and Symbolic Power. Read on.

In Language and Symbolic Power, Pierre Bourdieu takes Austin and oth-
ers to task for presenting a naive view of performativity from a form-
alist stance. Institutions and context are not taken into account; in
order for performative competence to occur, members must both recog-
nize and empathize with authority. Language is seen as communication
within a linguistic community. Language does not operate on itself.
Nevertheless, computer languages provide an instructive counter exam-
ple. Within the aegis of a program, the language itself is the ins-
titution, articulated through other languages, all the way down to
software implementations in the midst of hardware. This is clean-cut;
the program need only be started for it to run independently of com-
munity. It carries out tasks in what appears to be a rather essential
interiority, and one might consider that every action in the universe
might be considered one sort of program or another.

The computer language, then, is both formal and leaky, residing in the
midst of other languages; what appear to be objects and life-forms may
only be the surplus productions of a program that continues to develop
on its own. Such a language, in fact, _can_ operate upon itself, as
any owner in 1974 of a TI59 calculator can attest to; even within such
a small device, there are self-modifying programs - and the develop-
ment since then has been exponential.

Thus the program could be considered almost purely performative in the
Austinian sense, constructing by virtue of compiled or interpreted
commands. While the context is the computer itself, as well as the
particular implementation of the language, etc., this is formal and
well-defined and conceivably inseparable from the language as well.

One could argue that there is always an operator in the background,
but this parallels human evolution with an Operator in the background.

I would argue instead that there is a qualitative difference between
human languages (as constituted by speech and writing) and computer
languages - precisely in this aspect - that performativity within the
computer (which is all there is vis-a-vis the language) is context-
free, in a sense which human languages are not. I would also argue
that this constitutes a turn in representation itself, which becomes
both construct and _dynamic,_ performative, just as any virtual real-
ity is necessarily performative, if not to be reduced to the old-
fashioned stereograms of the nineteenth century.

Thus it is relevant now to ask: What does it mean to _perform the
real,_ which is a question that, previously, would have been consid-
ered nonsensical, or literally the theater of psychoses.

Memory, Circumlocution, Phenomenology


When I decided to come to Japan, I had already been six years in New York,
living in the same loft the while. I had established routines for shower-
ing, going for early afternoon coffee, the programs I watched on late-night
television. I had a circle of friends who tolerated me, often trading or
giving books and other theoretical paraphenalia away. In short, I had est-
ablished a habitus of customary dispositions of reasonable depth, including
jacking in to cyberspace on my Pentium desktop several times a day.

I would program on the desktop or explore the Linux system I had installed.
Over the years, the number of phonecalls I received  dropped off drastically
as the Net took up more and more communicative space. In the last several
months, I had negotiated a trade with Tom Zummer, receiving an old Mac in
exchange for some other equipment. I set this up on the top of the bureau
(which also bordered the top of the sink in typical New York style), and
used this for email; it was quick and easier to use than the desktop for
these types of tasks.

There were also two laptops in the apartment, both 486/25s, which I now have
with me in Fukuoka. One was set in front of the futon, providing a third
station; the second was usually packed away, taken out for trips and other
distance applications. Although both are slow, the Aero is very lightweight,
and the NCR has one of the best active matrix screens I've seen. I'm typing
this, for example, in crisp black, white, yellow, and green.

In short, I had established a personal environment interpenetrated with var-
ious forms of communication technologies - phone, radio (shortwave, etc.),
mail, magazines, computer (internet, etc.), television, cassette tape, CD,
CD-ROM, and VCR. The phone machine linked me across my departures and arri-
vals from the loft; the mail continues to come.

I left quickly for Japan, two months or so after making the decision. A
large part of this time was taken in translating goods from one site to
another, which I had never seen. The translation consisted in either phys-
ical sending of material, or packing and storing. Before either, I sold a
number of books, gave a number away, including some which I regret at this
point - including a sale of two shopping-bags of "theory" for one-hundred-
some dollars, well below market value.

The transition eventually transformed the loft into a space emptied of per-
sonal history; I'd wake in the morning, along with the cat, facing a mute
range of cartons and boxes, shelves half-empty, books out of order or askew.
I was draining the signs of my life, the clutter and trinkets which separate
the everyday familiality of the world from the impersonal spaces of capital
and implosion on the street.

I left through portals, through other transitional spaces. The night before
flying from New York, I did a poetry reading; the night before that, I pur-
chased the loft. I flew to San Francisco, spending part of a night and the
next morning with my daughter; the next morning, I left for Portland, then
Nagoya, then Fukuoka. Each of these occasions released or gathered; each
provided a distancing from everyday life in Brooklyn. Things slipped away. I
had shipped two cartons of books, took others with me. Whenever possible, I
jacked in the Net, thanks for the memories. I used this account or that ac-
count; I was turning unaccountable.

In Fukuoka, the alterity of inertia has been everywhere. I have written of
kanji and the language all the way down, the necessity of interpretive stra-
tegies across common everyday activities - mailing a letter, picking up a
package, buying the proper kind of milk. I have written of the obdurate
nature of the sign, so evident in its unreadability - on one hand, I'm in
the midst of the physico-inert (practico-inert); on the other, I'm excused
from the textual world, so I skim, render surfaces back into surfaces. Thus
material depth in a world of signs which appear as further gestures, signi-
fiers into the void. All dissolves in the knowledge that for everyone around
me, the world is everyday, slipping by. Nothing slips by here; hijoguchi,
emergency door, requires a series of moves in order to comprehend the phrase
or kanji or even what door is meant, for what purpose, and wherefore.

_Wherefore_ which is the condition of birth. _Wherefore_ which is the state
of death, descent, as well; once I knew what to do in case of fire, and once
I recognized the State for what it is, was, will be.

But this is an essay on memory and reconstitution: Who do I hear from, still
in New York or elsewhere in North America? How is the process of neighboring
discontinued by flight, lines of flight? New York implodes constantly; once
there, the rest of the world is withdrawn or absorbed, transformed into the
same thing. So that I do not hear from New York from outside New York, and I
would say that New York is emblematic of foreclosure itself, that no one
hears from New York, that New York disappears into itself, perhaps in the
way that any large city does, and perhaps not. But I was there, leaving
after just having purchased a loft, and it is this, the loft and the people
and taking a shower, that I am writing about, the necessity for reconstitu-
tion, and the operations of memory described by Sartre, say, all the way
back in the Psychology of Imagination, or Schutz on relevance theory, or
even current work in cognitive psychology, emphasizing the constitution of
the world, not its given - for it is here that this essay unfolds, in its
reconstitution.

For example, the shower, which I do not remember in its totality or as a
sign or signified, but only in the detail, which I begin to reconstruct -
the need to step over the weathered piece of wood on the step in order to
enter it, the stains on the cheap plastic, the sealed drain which leaked
into the downstairs hallway - all of these things which do not come to mind
immediately, but are reconstructed as a chain of signifiers - or more prop-
erly, as a narrative - so that there is on one hand a "feeling" of the
shower and its environs, but on the other, there is the need to create a
story about it, similar to the stories necessary in learning kanji - only
_this_ story reaches out into the physical world, bringing it back to me -
although, again, perhaps it's a reconstruction of fiction, something that
never existed - it would be hard to know without returning - so that New
York is becoming, increasingly, both "New York" and an _unfolding_ that
exists _qua_ unfolding, and it's the _qua_ - the narrativization - that is
the core of historiography, I'd dare say - that is at the heart of things -

[There might be another example from the process of creating "measure poly-
topes" in dimension theory - in other words, moving from the two-dimensional
square to the three-dimensional cube - you can do this by "sliding" the
square at right-angles to itself, just the right distance - there's your
cube - and it's just as easy to slide a one-dimensional line-segment "side-
ways," creating the square in the first place - this all beginning, of
course, with a single zero-dimensional point - you slide it, and form a
line-segment - so that it's as if there is a beginning, middle, and end, to
the segment - it doesn't matter where you begin, which end is the beginning
and which is the end - it's the sliding (I realize I'm creating a dynamics
here) - all sorts of things emerge from this approach, needless to say - but
here the only point is that there _are_ points demarcating the segment,
which consists of <point> <continuum opened at both ends> <point> - and you
can imagine this as a _track_ telling us something if you want.]

So that now, I carry around a triple structure of the past - first, those
memories which are "ordinary" ones, highschool prom for example - anything
that was in the past, that presents itself, that demarcates itself, perhaps
those things that create traumatic structures or even at the time seemed
emblematic - then there are those memories which are "foreclosed," which
appear as nodes or intensifications, emptied of content - or rather, with
inaccessible content - such as "New York" before leaving, my habitus in
relation to my friends, the socio-cultural landscape for example - and
third, there are those memories that are "on the verge," "on the tip of my
tongue" (langue) - which appear, are apparent, only by virtue of reconsti-
tution, a re-creation - and of course, all of these are intertwined, one
lending itself to the others - I live in a world of half fictivities - our
worlds always border, "just about," on psychosis in this regard - what is
true or not - and there are the issues of what strategies are necessary for
the reconstitution, dredging, in the first place?

And for me, back to the shower, it's the _path_ or _action-paths_ across or
into the shower that are germane, the moment of the body _in regard_ to the
shower, in regard to its space - I can see my hand reaching for the shampoo
for example - the smaller bottles kept in a shallow cavity on the shower
rail (in the right-hand corner), the larger kept in a shelf with "fencing"
hanging from the shower head itself - then there were the left-over bottles
- what hadn't I finished using, what did I use, what remained of the liquids
and solids that constituted my everyday hygiene - and I can remember further
into the mouthwash on the poorly-constructed shelf above the toilet, and so
on and so forth - even with animals -

The cat, Boojum, imagining her, the tenor of her fur, quality of her eyes,
her movements across the floor - I'd have to think of something to toss -
she'd play for a little while, then drop away - she'd lose interest quickly
- and I think this is because of the way she was probably brought up - she
was a street cat who was kept as a tiny kitten, I think, in the basement of
the Cuban restaurant next door, as a mouser - she got out - we heard her
mewling and mewling in the back garden - went out there, found her - took
her in - no choice really, she's been with me every since, except for a few
months - tears up the furniture - a particularly loving cat, by the way - I
can remember, I can remember -

And so it goes, even with people, even with the quality of space and time,
even with the constructs of dimensionality - when did the world appear quite
so _real_ as it did, say, on a certain afternoon I can imagine, create, in
1969 or 1973 or 2004? What a swirling here! And what difficulty to decide
where virtuality occurs, what is _hardened_ and what's not, what is "really"
present and what's not - and how one defines "really" - which loses as soon
as it's formed in the mouth or by the fingers - everything carries ghosts -

It's the reason, I think, for ghosts - they're carried as the organs or
structures of reconstitutions, they're the remaking of the world and its
hollowing at the same time - they're simultaneously birth and death, pre-
sence and absence, fullness and lack - there's no accounting for them - and
now, we live adjacent to a graveyard in a Buddhist temple ground, and I'm
waiting for the next typhoon - the dead will rise, or something will, or
something will sink, something of life or lifelessness, not this eternal
circling or cycling, just the _building_ of the world - its scaffolding -
you can almost see it toppling - rather perhaps our existence as stains upon
it - memories for no reason whatsoever, memories for no occasion at all.

Oh, this is to those ghosts who swell our bodies, harden them into the ves-
tiges of life! This is for those strategies, those operations! This is for
the moment of foreclosure, completion, return to the beginning which gives
everything a name, proper or otherwise! This is for occasions! Once, I was
living by the side of a valley, there was a factory and a machine in the
valley, and I saw the factory, heard the machine. And I remember [...]

Ghosts, which I have created for the occasion - or, to be precise, which 
have created me - and no more can I remember, they're part and parcel -
just as DNA courses, for example, or the air itself - they're together,
I'm human after all - whatever I remember, you can be sure (are you there?)
- passes - this is a species in fact concerned with _passing,_ the on- 
slaught of time as one example, hiding, effacing, as another [...]

Part-object ghosts, irreal ghosts, nanotech ghosts, machinic desire 
[...]

[...]

The Panix office is closed this morning because the water main break
in the area makes it inadvisable to travel to that part of town.  There
will be staffers available by email, but we do not expect to be able to 
answer phone calls.  

Sometimes I get tired working here, wondering what you are doing over
there in Japan. Then I think to myself, I'd better look in a mirror. Then
I go into the sendmail configurations and work the troubles. Then I think,
these troubles are worked. Then I know I've accomplished something. Then I
can forget the mirror and just love my identical twin sister, M. Then she
says, this is interesting, so send it to everyone. Then I do. 

M.

Twice the Speed!


Desiree rides herself, O Beauty!

Latest Shinkansen bullet train in operation, the Nozomi, at 300 kilo-
meters per hour! Fukuoka to Tokyo, minus the stops, Nozomi, "desire"
among other readings - the pure vector of it - the momentum generated
by the _wish_ itself. It's a hurricane! tsunami! typhoon, "table wind"
winding across the plains of Japan! Suddenly: No Nozomi, cancelled for
the day or night. Desire travels everywhere except to the far north!
Little desire in Hokkaido! The brain is where the stem is, things fall
to the ground, gather in Kyushu! In Kyushu, I become Hakata-Doll,
which makes me special. I gather Desiree in my Kimono. She is very       
cold! She has been out all night in Nakasu, now collapsing on the tat-
ami mat! We feel very sad for her. Later, we tell her that there are    
new Shinkansen under development, right now! They have reached speeds
of 550 kilometers per hour! They levitate! There is no desire!       
My brain tracks her to the end of the line! I am cannibal! So long,
Desiree! Hello Nozomi!

"Thinking of these beautiful Islands, vectored beyond reason, I am re-
minded of the fragility of all Life, the frailty of being Human, and
our dear mortal Souls, given to miserable Trespass." (Jonathen Swift, 
Gulliver's Travels.)

"There is too much desire in the world." (Wittgenstein.) "There is 
just the right amount." (John Cage.) "I've never been to Japan, but I 
was born there." (Three Dog Night.)

Desiree breaks the sound barrier; she's traveling now, faster than 
the vocation of the real. Beautiful streamers behind her; Diogenes
Laertius reports that the Chaldeans could read the invisible spirits
streaming everywhere in the air. 

Aw, it's all so sad when desire loses itself among the rigidity of 
protocols and tracks, on the way to paradise. It's all so sad when I
can't remember what I'm writing, when my virtual body collapses as a
result of physical illness - but it's then that clarity surfaces: 
_Who is Desiree, and why is she saying those terrible things about 
me?_

The fever throws plates off my stomach; the ground is cluttered with
parts of my body, fits and starts. I can see my arm from my eye. I 
can feel my wrist from my foot. The Nozomi hurtles through the night
and every feverish shudder (I have) tends towards a slight inhalation
- O Japan! O Desire!

True and false gods - look how the world's barred. I missed the train
and spent the night in the Hakata station. So what? Well, there was
American coffee, and I met an itinerant shakuhachi player who taught
me everything I know!

Such as cancer is the leading cause of death in Japan. Such as, peo-
ple rush rush rush! but get nowhere! Desire burns out, and Desiree's
stuck on the track, sick, as the typhoon hits and the train just 
stalls out! Subscribe to shinkansen-l@listserv.aol.com!

Now it's almost time to leave, now I'm on the train, Tokyo! O Tokyo,
big Eastern City of the Korean Peninsula! How are you today!

The Truth of Dis-Ease, Illness, Lesions of Thought and Affect


I cannot gauge the destructiveness of my fever without a thermometer;
I can only recognize the current demobilization of my body - sheets of
convulsive shuddering, for example, across the upper chest region, and
a certain weakness in the skin of the legs and arms. This is accompan-
ied by a continuous cough, possible water in the lungs, insomnia. I
bring up these _conditions_ or illness, dis-ease, in relation to writ-
ing, which is always apparently constituted by the physically healthy
body - thus philosophy, say, based on the _red patch_ assumes a lack
of color-blindness, and a phenomenologist sitting at a desk is presum-
ably not subjected to continuous burning sensations, as a result of
the sunlight entering through the window.

Years ago, in Disorders of the Real, I thought through a similar ill-
ness, writing through it, through the hallucinations and sweats; I was
unable to function, but wondered, marginally (to the extent I could
wonder at all) whether the image or construct of the world given to me
_under those conditions_ might not be somehow "truer" than otherwise.
If this seems far-fetched, think of those writing within depression,
and depression's hold on reality.

So to what extent is the philosopher not only healthy, but a model of
health and sanity for that matter? And here are some quotes from the
book:

"Bury

"I have the flu. It is a violent case; I find it difficult to concen-
trate. Things seem lighter; my body twists and curls. There are mom-
ents of tension, dizziness. Nothing resolves.

"What resolves, reverses, is the memory of a fantasy. Which reduces to
an image, is captured by an image. A hole in the shape of a funnel, an
inverted cone, into the ground. About thirteen inches; somehow this
depth is significant. When I do not have the flu. Which I do at the
moment."

This is from The Sickness I. Here is more:

"Does the flu take over the fantasy, as chills begin. They are typical
chills in this abnormal, atypical December weather with the tempera-
tures reaching into the mid 70s. What about the fantasy when the body
convulses, or is the result of the fantasy, the same, and therefore
the necessity for its presence? In the midst of my sickness, the flu."

And what if the image, the fantasy, is a guiding metaphor? What if it
constitutes the heart of philosophical exegesis, something later on
perhaps that I would bring back, from sickness into health? What are
the insights offered? What have they to do with the structure of the
world?

"A smoothness somehow tied into the cause and effect relation of the
flu. To itself. The flu which consumes itself. Disappearing into the
blending of reason."

Becoming the heart of reason, the dis-ease at the core of philosophy,
taking the world apart, nothing for granted.

And from The Sickness II:

"Even then in the midst of my sickness (delirium) I speculated on this
apparition. The fever insisted on telling a truth: this was verified
by the fever itself."

The fever deconstructs the body, holds it in abeyance. An addition: I
don't feel well, I don't feel myself, I don't feel anything, I'm some-
where else, where am I?

Then there is the practical inertness, The Sickness V emphasizing the
stone or ghost-like apparition of the self. For both interpenetrate:
The stone is hollow, transparent, and the ghost thuds to the ground.
Words choke in the throat; language vacates itself, meaning is no
longer present or an issue. As in depression, everything decathects,
and it is this loosening, this disinvestment, that tends towards a
truth that topples, that can never be recognized, since there is no
healthy subject to recognize it:

"All this stupid thing does is sit around and watch television.
That's the first line.
It always forgets what it's talking about. Half its mind is gone.
That's another line.
It just had its temperature raised to hell and back. It just had its
ear smashed [tinnitus].
That's something.
It just can't hear the high notes. It just can't tell where the low
notes are coming from.
That's one of them.
It watches its body collapsing each time a breath is expelled.
Someone has to remind it to breathe.
That's whatever.
It gets sick at night; it can't remember where it comes from.
That's it.
It misses the point; it can't remember what it was you said just a
moment ago.
That's maybe what it meant.
It can't even make a point; it just writes and writes and makes
errors, errors not points.
That's a line or two."
[...]
"It can't even rot; it doesn't have enough mind left for the rot of
it.
That's not even the truth.
It just had a bloody hot fever; it remembers the fever, whatever that
had been, wherever.
Isn't nothing at all.
Isn't the first or the second.
Isn't meaning anything.
Isn't a head or anything at all."

Isn't meaning anything, because _there_ would be the locus of meaning
- instead we'll foreclose illness, cancel it, cancel depression for
that matter - cancel neurosis, schizophrenia, psychosis - look for the
truth in health - in the post-therapeutic subject - well-adjusted -
now you see the problem - already this has been deconstructed in rela-
tion to the psychoanalytical - but with the physical, yes, there are
still ailments, these carry - if anything - misrecognitions, misrepre-
sentations - or so it seems - I'd say, here, otherwise - let's look at
fevered texts, convulsive or epileptic texts - let's look at cancered
texts or texts in-formed by tumors - let's look of the truth of the
waning mind - the consumed body - the body of lesions - body of wounds
- I don't mean here, the political economy of this body, or its wit-
nessing - I mean specifically the contribution to philosophy that
emerges - yes, I know otherwise, but bear with me here - next time
you're sick, reread these words - note the transparency of things -
watch the draining of meaning when you're no longer around to main-
tain it - you see again what I'm getting at -

_It's infecting you -_

At this point, the hostile god-code was entered; it consistently crashed   
my file reader through an error in EMM386 poking at the text. I did er-
ase it, entering it forever again and again, in the hopes of a new crea-
tion, but it was not to be. Shall I spare thee 9,000 bytes of worthless
adds, subs, pushes, pulls - the mutilation of memory everywhere? Alas, I
am not god, but my brief visitation with divinity was enough to convince
me that it is ultimately boring...

Dreaming, unwell, I can no longer understand my dreams; dream-signs wri-
tten in false dream-kanji clutter the dream-landscape - dream-writing
becomes inert, signifier of incomprehension, and writing slips back into
the world it once mediated. Dream-world or world, dream-mediation hold-
ing back the dream-real or real, now lost to dream-interpretation: they
are _here,_ they are my dream-foreign; there is no dream-comprehension,
dream-therapeutic; only broken dream-bodies with common dream-blood and
dream-bones abound. You see you may take "dream" out of this in any
"dream-space," but you cannot add past the inert; I am dream-suffocated
in the dream-real or real; I am dream-mute, suspicious of _all_ dream-
meaning and meaning; I do not understand my dream-face or scars on my
body; I do not dream-age or age. Dreaming, unwell, I am manipulating signs
_as I speak_ and I no longer dream-understand what my dream-face or face
is saying, is desperate, unwell. Dreaming, I dream-type or type-this to
you "given the hope that" some dream-sense or sense will come, but I am
gone, dream-dead or dead, turned to dream-ash or ash, these are kanji, 
are they not, you, stone, ash, body, dream, language, ash, kanji, see?

The Attempted* Rewrite: Diseases of Being


Dreaming, dreaming, unwell, dreaming, I can no longer understand my
dreams; dream-signs written in false dream-kanji clutter the dream-
landscape - dream-writing becomes inert, dreaming, signifier of
incomprehension, dreaming, and writing slips back into the world it
once mediated. Dream-world or world, dreaming, dream-mediation hold-
ing back the dream-real or real, dreaming, now lost to dream-interpre-
tation: they are _here, dreaming,_ they are my dream-foreign; there is
no dream-comprehension, dreaming, dream-therapeutic; only broken
dream-bodies with common dream-blood and dream-bones abound. You see
you may take "dream" out of this in any "dream-space, dreaming," but
you cannot add past the inert; I am dream-suffocated in the dream-real
or real; I am dream-mute, dreaming, suspicious of _all_ dream-meaning
and meaning; I do not understand my dream-face or scars on my body; I
do not dream-age or age. Dreaming, dreaming, unwell, dreaming, I am
manipulating signs _as I speak_ and I no longer dream-understand what
my dream-face or face is saying, dreaming, is desperate, dreaming,
unwell. Dreaming, dreaming, I dream-type or type-this to you "given
the hope that" some dream-sense or sense will come, dreaming, but I am
gone, dreaming, dream-dead or dead, dreaming, turned to dream-ash or
ash, dreaming, these are kanji, dreaming, are they not, dreaming, you,
dreaming, stone, dreaming, ash, dreaming, body, dreaming, dream,
dreaming, language, dreaming, ash, dreaming, kanji, dreaming, see?
See in the real, dreaming, the scene everywhere, dreaming, the seen
everywhere in the real. I am dying, dreaming, here. Dreaming collapses
reals into dreams. Again and again as an example I can watch my body
fall. Again and again I am dreamed.

(Sometimes I think if I knew who you are, it would be simpler. I would
untangle. But I do not know who you are, where you are, when you are
there. I do not know if you are there. I do not know if there is you.
If I understood _how to properly ask the question,_ with the requisite
degree of etiquette, with the requisite forms of grammar, with the in-
visible forms of grammar, with the passing-forms, with the passings,
then - if I understood _how to ask the question,_ already it would be
a simpler untangling. I can continue to speculate, but it is from ig-
norance. I have forgotten axioms, bases, which I never knew. When my
mouth opens, it empties. It empties itself of speech and sensibility.
When I open my body, it is a carapace filled with ornament. There are
kanji I cannot read, dream-kanji, not-real kanji. Nothing readable by
any conceivable reader in this or any possible world. Do you under-
stand at least this much, the possibility of worlds? The relative ab-
sence of such worlds, and there are no mirrors.

This is it, the writing of worlds without mirrors, and in a foreign
language, and there's more, because they're impossible worlds, and
where would this lead? Neither neurosis nor psychosis, but a relative
_disease of the throat_ I have written about before, continually writ-
ten about. A _disease of the throat_ or perhaps mind in the vocal
apparatus itself - I would say that - something never leaving a trace
but drawing itself in _uncanny_ ways, as if there were a face behind
the nonsense, or as if nonsense were organized _in such a manner,_
through the proper forms, as to appear otherwise than itself - as if I
myself were capable of such appearance, this _otherwise_ splitting me
from language, slitting or cutting my throat, the blood forming mean-
ingless patterns on the ground.)



*Footnote to the above: At first, I would do nothing but create the form
(dream-x and x). Then it seemed that the equation seeped from the page,
(virtual-x and x), shaming me. Then I forgot my name. Then I wrote and
rewrote, forgetting my name. Then would I pause, this most important of
all writings, where worlds are mute; can I even say this?

minus america (a traditional poem)


it's the middle of the night and there are columns crashing down
everywhere to the left and right of me, and i am traveling
one hundred miles an hour across the thin white line of oklahoma,
lights slamming from the distance, promise of nothing, annihilation
passing me by,
it's the middle of the night in oklahoma, there's a truck burning
on the side of the road and tom and roger and me put it out and
there's a car burning in a gas station and we take off high speed
tailing across new mexico until the transmission breaks free
of the load of anguish and too much talk, codeine and too much drink,
roiling across the road, we pull in, and it's the middle of the night
in new mexico,
back then with perfect hate music from the radio in carolina,
back then one hundred miles an hour in oklahoma, line bisecting
horizon after horizon, small-town lights churning past in summer heat,
bisecting my eye, cutting it open, two blind halves falling
to the floor
of the car of the highway of codeine of too much drink,
of transmission, there's always another thin white line,
i think it's trying to say something, flat like a road or a bridge,
flat like a playing field or roadkill with its singular eye -
i think too, this is america, this _dash_ in space, this emptiness
in the middle of columns falling down as i think tom and sung-ja
stuck with me somewhere in indiana or stuck with me against the roof
in flight from chicago heading nowhere, this great _minus_
of white light, this vector or crease in firmament, this tale
left without an ending, this moment when we know it all, owe it all,
this energy emptied of all thought at one hundred miles an hour,
repeating itself over and over again, i try to sleep, tom, sung-ja,
towns crowding themselves towards the entrance of the millennium,
this dash in space, this zero, this america
