Short description/annotation:  A series of short texts or poems that revel 
in structured and unstructured language, with all the gaps and excitement 
that happens when language is stressed to the limit.

Main description:  In Sondheim.s Deep Language, writing detours through 
digital and other media, returning with new forms and genres, new ways of 
thinking philosophy, the body, religion, and everything else. This is a 
series of poems that revel in structured and unstructured language, with 
all the gaps and excitement that happens when language is stressed to the 
limit.

These pieces cohere, interrelate, interpenetrate; they develop the concept 
of deep language in any number of fascinating ways, ranging from intuitive 
writing to the use of scripts, code, and programming to elucidate hidden 
meanings . where none may have existed before.

Excerpt from book:

bunnies

the bunnies made strange calls, odd calls, gruntings, not the thumpings 
but the gruntings - ..I say. .there is a chair.. . Wittgenstein in 
translation . right over the other lupus. ears, just like that! .->:anyway 
the rabbits did this five or six times in a row and it seemed fairlyclear 
they were playing and right in front of us in the middle of the night. 
Honestly, you should have seen them! I never saw such a thing! I never 
knew rabbits could do such a thing! .Do not try to analyse your own inner 
experience.. - Wittgenstein in translation -:i pucker my lips constantly 
in the absence of the shakuhachi. i know its murmuring burbling abbling 
brook. now i.m at a loss, having transformed bAbbling into something else 
entirely . in any case, when i die, these three instruments will huddle in 
a maddening corner, bubbling with mournful murmuring cries . .Not it.s 
looking like him.. - Wittgenstein in translation . ]]] here is a space. 
the one rabbit runs straight at the other and the other rabbit jumps 
vertically at the very last moment over the first rabbit and landf in the 
same spot.that.s .lands.. <..::

Write through my the bunnies made strange calls, odd calls, gruntings, not 
the thumpings but the gruntings . ..I say. .there is a chair.. - 
Wittgenstein in translation . right over the other lupus. ears, just like 
that! .->!


Unpublished endorsement:  Alan Sondheim writes. In fear of death . literal 
fear, real fear, symbolic fear . he uses anything and everything at his 
disposal to make and unmake himself and all of us as statements, words, 
part-words, characters. Alan Sondheim is one of the precious few who 
joyfully . and in abject misery . risks these terrors of writing for us, 
for our pleasure and our undoing. What happens? Language disposes of us.

As if that were not all that is required of any writer, Alan Sondheim is 
also the poet, the artist, the maker who has most profoundly immersed 
himself and his work in the life-changing code-forms . of networked 
computation . that have the world and its .genesis redux. in their grip. 
John Cayley
 

Unpublished endorsement:  Pioneer of experimental sensibility in multiple 
performance media Alan Sondheim tangles us up in these hypnotically 
repetitive, abject, slyly humorous and childishly gleeful, 
philosophically, aesthetically, theoretically and psychologically dense 
and insightful poems that are also essays, diasporic riffs and 
incantations, true confessions, Platonic dialogues, shtick, tantrums, 
aphorisms and manifesti. And that.s just the first 5 pieces! Maria Damon
 

Biographical note:  Alan Sondheim was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; 
he lives with his partner, Azure Carter, in Brooklyn NY. He holds a B.A. 
and M.A. from Brown University in English. A new-media artist, writer, and 
theorist, he has exhibited, performed and lectured widely. Sondheim's 
writings include the anthology Being on Line: Net Subjectivity (Lusitania, 
1996), Disorders of the Real (Station Hill, 1988), .echo (alt-X digital 
arts, 2001), Vel (Blazevox 2004-5), Sophia (Writers Forum, 2004), Orders 
of the Real (Writers Forum, 2005), The Accidental Artist (Fort/Da), 
Azure/Nature/Digital (Blue Lion, 2009), and The Wayward (Salt, 2004) as 
well as numerous chapbooks, ebooks, and articles.



Arab, ode, oud

"Drum asks whether there are any Republicans who are "willing to just 
quietly and frankly defend traditional American notions of religious 
freedom and traditional American notions of tolerance and decency."

"It's a good question, and by all means, pressure Republicans. But what 
about the Democrats who are refusing to condemn the opposition and call it 
out for what it is? What about Dems who won't stand up for the 
aforementioned traditional American notions of religious freedom and 
tolerance and decency?"

Mt. Tremper performance (sound)

Mt. Tremper performance - Foofwa d'Imobilite dance (you can hear the 
footstps); Azure Carter, voice; Alan Sondheim, violin, electric-acoustic 
oud, cura cumbus:

(There was a lot of echo in the space, but you get the idea.)



Folk songs and katydids

3 small 1980s sampling keyboard folk songs - we found a Casio Sk-1 at a 
yardsale in Phoenicia, NY, near Mt. Tremper, for $2, and it works nicely.

Followed by the northern song of the common true catydid - we did a number 
of recordings, but I think katydid2 is pretty good.

Buzzes and chirps coming soon to a Second Life installation (always) near 
you - 

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ folk mp3s
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ katydid mp3


(short, dirty) Fugue

The SK-1 has volatile memory that vanishes when the synthesizer is powered 
down. I recorded a short sequence of 'white' notes, placed them in memory, 
played them back with an overlaid layer of 'black' notes; the result is a 
structure which remains dissonant almost to the end, coupled tracings 
turning in. This is an image of the coherent body, always on the verge of 
resolution, never completing the totality that would (uselessly) continue 
its life forever.

the captain

the beating of the great heart, the captain says,
it's the great heart of the soul, it's always there,
it makes your machine talk, it becomes you, 

when you enter the great heart, your machine sings,
as if everything in the world were moving flesh,
the captain says, flesh coming into your own

for your home is not your home, and your life is ours,
and we live in the midst of the great beating heart,
and nothing happens for sure, the captain says,
until you come around, until you come down into it

and you become the great beating heart, hums your great machine,
and your moving flesh come into ours, the captain says,
our own is yours, your own is ours, until you come down into it

oh so many words, so much murmuring, when you come down into it,
your own, our beating heart, our moving flesh is yours

Lonely Unix Fortune (quoted)

Eleanor Rigby
        Sits at the keyboard
        And waits for a line on the screen
Lives in a dream
Waits for a signal
        Finding some code
        That will make the machine do some more.
What is it for?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Hacker MacKensie
Writing the code for a program that no one will run
It's nearly done
Look at him working, fixing the bugs in the night when there's nobody 
there.
What does he care?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?
Ah, look at all the lonely users.
Ah, look at all the lonely users.

would i murmur and caress you
would you be my parent process

oh everyone has a number

when you see meat it is not meat
when you don't see meat it is meat

my invisible flesh

are questions always questions
are there answers to no-questions

meat is returned always otherwise
what falls off-world is history

what is history, what is forgotten
cannot be stored, leaves no traces

think of residue which doesn't move
in masquerade, it appears otherwise

otherwise than being is the virtual
being virtual is always already otherwise

we are always within the virtual
we are always otherwise

but we move in the life and here we do not move
but we seem otherwise moving, and not appearing unmoving

BODIES: WRITE AN ASSIGNMENT

yes there were bodies in the debris
drawn from the same tired template they remain
they remain then fade out before the corporate structure
 of the virtual world fades out or rather disappears
 given the downward spiral inherent in the worldwide
 economic crisis
ALL VIRTUAL OBJECTS, AVATARS, WORLDS, ARE SUBJECT TO THE
 DIFFEREND
and it's here that the status is fundamentally ambivalent
 for nothing speaks here, moans, complains, files suit
 against any other
where that might occur is on the other side of division,
 no matter how porous, always bleak
meanwhile virtual bodies pile up or spew in virtual debris
 spores assigned nothing, lifespan governed arbitrarily
 up to thirty seconds
some things live longer than that
some things make their feelings known:
LIFE HAS A FUNDAMENTAL IMPETUS TO EXISTENCE
LIFE HAS A FUNDAMENTAL IMPETUS TO EXIST
watch the virtual cartoons governed by corporate life
picture them

Saturday August 14 - 3 PM SLT
"Flesh Meat - With Coastal Avatars"
Alan Dojoji/Alan Sondheim with Sandy Baldwin
FINAL EVENT of the 2010 Odyssey Performance Art Festival.

"I'm still looking at being-avatar in terms of sexuality, flesh, language; 
I do this through the lone avatar who goes nowhere, gets nowhere. There's 
no plot, nothing to reveal, nothing you don't already know, getting up in 
the morning, looking in the period. What's staring back at you has a 
name."

(apologies for cross-posting; odyperform is up for a short time only, due 
to space contraints)

http://www.alansondheim.org/odyperform.mp4 - very large file, gives a good 
idea of the organization of 'chaotic/fluid' architecture/organism. Text 
organized by Sandy Baldwin, performance by Alan Sondheim/Sandy Baldwin

http://www.alansondheim.org/odyre1.mov - short section from rehearsal 
showing two computers interacting; I ran two avatars together, so that 
performance could alternate with script/object/animation changes etc.

A A-Non-Anti-Un-Manifesto for Talan Memmott

Non-Manifesto

Be it enacted here [by whom? for what? under what authority? what diegetic 
form constructing the appearance of truth? enacted where? < inscription is 
always already virtual; inscription is the _only_ virtual >] that the 
concept of the manifesto is already - has always been - outdated, useless, 
nonsensical - through its very presence, the harbinger of an untoward 
tendency towards an Absolute that is Father-in-arms with inerrancy - the 
result and residue of a backlash in association - entwined with - religion 
and Enlightenment < simultaneously deconstructing the appetition of both 
> as if wounds were there for a _fundamental suturing_ -

Manifesto = structure = guidelines = bracketed territory = symbolic = 
purity = cleansed = asservation = truth tables = null incision between x 
and ~x = coagulation-fantasm as singularity = death = writing degree 1 = 
deadwood = protocol statements = Nicod's formulation of the propositional 
calculus = homesteading within the Sheffer stroke and its dual = Web 0.0.

Where there's emission /\ spray /\ spew /\ spawn /\ slough /\ swamp /\ 
stutter | shudder | sputter | spatter | spitter | spotter | splatter | 
splitter | clatter | clutter | scatter ... What is uncountable (is) 
unaccountable, unaccounted-for = > denying the dead territorialization of 
the manifesto. I don't want to know you and your manifestos.

I don't want to know your interspersions of logical numbering, as if 
Wittgenstein's TLP were something other than the scattered remnants of 
classicism and I don't want your candles' burning the last prop as if 
mysticism somehow were the fabric of space and time. I don't want your 
pseudo-math as if mathesis justifies anything you have to say. I don't 
want your neologisms as if the world weren't on fire, as if greed and 
competition were in the guise of truth beneath the true-real sign of 
superstructure. I don't want your dead nineteenth-century manifestos, 
enormous philosophical structures based on concepts crash-landing in the 
midst of local wars, neo-colonialisms, monstrous religious visions of 
futures and gods. I don't want your concepts. I don't want your 
manifesto.

Things fall apart. There's no good time to die. No one dies before her 
time. No one dies before his time. No one lives on borrowed time. Every 
death annihilates a world. Every killing is an apocalypse. Every culture 
is abjection. Every abjection is a slaughter. Every slaughter is a life. 
Every life is culture. There is no organism without culture. There is no 
organism without inscription. Inscription sloughs into abjection. Organism 
collapses into annihilation. Manifesto is an ugly carapace. Manifesto 
kills the thing it loves. I want to live forever. I want non-acts of 
loving kind. I don't want your inscription-abjection. Nothing there is I 
want. I want for nothing. I don't want your manifesto.



New Blown Reconstructed Self-Generated Avatar at Humlab

avatar locked into a movement- and spew-generating object as well as 
several others among hir

I see those same figures but the organization's different, Julu said, 
they're attached to you and the wind, you're blown up, blown about, 
there's no you there, nothing, the rim of the bowl of the world's dark 
matter has you in its grasp, everything's prey, the universe preys on 
itself - dark, it has no knowledge, no fore-knowledge, no learning of this 
and many other things - you're swooped upon, always in the talons of the 
world, this world which you hope is one of many - as if you're spread 
among 'em, Julu said, you're not, you're not, you're not, you just do the 
best you can -

maxims, laws of form

you can't draw a distinction without the meat
if a distinction is equivalent, it's a fissure
if a distinction is different, it's a negation relative to the meat
once crossed, a negation is done
from negation emerges the other
negation is on the way to inscribing the other and the meat of the other
from a fissure emerges the slow creep of the other 
from the slow creep of the other emerges the matrix of the fissure
the matrix of the fissure is unstable
different distinction is stable to the extent that negation is stable
negation of negation is somewhat of something else
a fissure is abjection in meat, is meat-abjection
different distinction renders meat-abjection taut
taut abjection is at the breaking-point of slough
substrate shines among broken meat
crossing a fissure makes no difference
the non-difference of fissure is the foundation of culture
the fissure, meat-abjection, is always imaginary
the imaginary of the fissure is uncountable, unaccounted-for
the imaginary of different distinction is surreal number
among numbers are numbers, among the fissure is defuge
fissures are reducible and irreducible
different distinctions reside on the plateau of mathesis
mathesis is extruded from the plateau of different distinctions
schemata are imaginary and unaccountable
schemata are meat-fissures

dear monster, there is nothing left of me
everything has fallen through and i cannot die for hir
s/he will be bereft and that is the worst of the token
s/he says the laws of form are the out-laws of form
s/he says the out-laws of form are meat-forms and 'no matter what'
s/he says ontology is a muscle memory
hir rightness is monstrous and true as meat is true
the truth of meat is the cleft and fissure of meat (s/he says)
i will never get back to you on this
(there is nothing to get back to)
(it is impossible to return)



Four unusual solos (raft-zither, viola, piccolo)

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/raftzither1.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/raftzither2.mp3

The raft-zither is a grass-based zither from Western Africa; see 
http://orgs.usd.edu/nmm/Africa/1245/RaftZither.html
(mine is identical) - I received this from Stephen Dydo.
Reverb is added. The raft-zither has an amazing beautiful, soft sound.

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/viola1.mp3

So far the viola sounds similar to my violin playing, but much more 
resonant, deeper. I'm tuning it CGcg, holding it vertically. New works 
coming shortly.

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/piccolo1.mp3

Piccolo solo which I can only describe as truly annoying. Hiss reduction
and reverb are added. It's as if another music, in another register, 
suddenly made itself manifest.

Death Dirge Viola


how would I listen?

viola1 replaces the other viola1.
viola2 is the _matrix_ from which viola0 is the result.

I would listen first to viola0 which is the result of a dream, produced 
from another matrix:

Azure and I waiting outside a (university) hall in Canada or Europe; our 
unknown friend is speaking. The cellphone rings; I hit the answer button 
more assuredly than usual. My mother is on the line, Hello Alan, this is 
your mother, I just called to tell you I'm doing well. How are you. I'm 
doing well but I thought you were dead. I am but I wanted to say you're 
doing a good job and Azure is doing a good job as well. I began to pass 
the phone to Azure, somewhere saying, this is Mother, her voice was fading 
out, the line was open but emptied, there was nothing. I think she was 
calling perhaps from New York, I'm not sure, I woke up in tears, I know 
this is the oldest scenario in the world, predating our world, awakening 
to my deepest fears. My mother died in 2000, my uncle and cousin just 
died, my sister is going to my uncle's funeral, earlier I composed these 
pieces which are mournful, calling out. viola1 was the first recorded, 
repeating and repeating as if something would emerge, it emerged later in 
viola0, viola 2 a diversion. Somewhere I was hearing You Are My Sunshine, 
Sheila Jordan and George Russell, but that's not here, that's gone, that's 
elsewhere, elsewhere.

80th birthday celebration.

The Sparse Dance at Humlab


Avatar Julu Dojoji performing Sparse Dance at Humlab. Of all the avatar 
dance videos I've done in SL, this seems to me (at the moment) to be the 
most interesting - certainly the dance makes sense. Some of the materials 
are worn by Dojoji, some are activated by hir; the movement is fluid, 
camera work extraordinary thanks to the Snowglobe 2 Viewer. I wish to 
thank my entire production staff for this. If you have ONE avatar Dojoji 
film to see this year, THIS IS IT!

http://www.alansondheim.org/sparse.mp4

Seriously, it's beautiful and close to the kind of hypostatization I've 
wanted to work towards, in terms of solo performance/choreography. Not to 
mention the sound finally comes together. The beginning and end of the 
piece demonstrates the construction and deconstruction.




Introductory Essay to the Humlab Artist-in-Residency Project in 
Second Life


( Created for an installation at Humlab, Umea University, Sweden. )

I begin with the original project description. Notes are bracketed.

Project name - either Well or Brane -

The first refers to something that is low/beneath the surface - but 
reflects the sky; it also taps into something hidden.

The second references a dimensional object in string theory that may or 
may not exist. From Wikipedia:

"Originally string theory was a theory of 1-branes called strings. By the 
mid-1990s it became apparent that the theory could be extended to also 
include higher dimensional objects. Typically these objects are 
non-perturbative features of the theory (meaning they do not appear in 
perturbation theory)."

Think impossible or inconceivable objects, objects nonetheless that may be 
fundamental to the cosmos - think fundamental ontology.

Avatar names:

My first avatar is Alan Dojoji.
My second avatar is Julu Twine.

[ Originally, Julu Twine was simpler in appearance and accouterments and 
was used for building and everyday tasks. Then for a reason I no longer 
remember, Alan Dojoji took up the role, and Julu Twine was outfitted for 
complex movement, self-installation, and performance. Now both perform; 
Alan Dojoji is the everyday avatar as well, and for the most part is 
simpler.

Even with avatars, there are bandwidth issues; the more complex the 
avatar, and the greater number of particles s/he emits - the more 
bandwidth is taken up, which affects slower machines and the Second Life 
parcel in general.

The avatars go in and out, taking their self-installations all about. ]

Description of installation:

Well/Brane is both installation and performance space. with the former, I 
want to extend the idea of "negotiated space," a space in SL that is 
inherently uncomfortable, impossible to move through. Negotiated space, 
which is also a supple and continuously-changing architecture, first 
appeared in my Odyssey installation, "The Accidental Artist" (also the 
name of a publish-on-demand book produced by Fort/Da Press). The basic 
concept is that, within the space, one is utterly lost, among the 'alien.'

[ The concept changed; I was less interested in negotiated architecture 
than negotiated performance, and what I've termed "ontological mashup." 
Negotiated performance references inordinately complex movements and 
costuming - which is activated (i.e. moves on its own, has scripts 
attached. I wanted to explore not only inconceivable movement, but a kind 
of inconceivable movement that might reference our own condition in the 
world - what happens when we carry destructive ecologies with us. A series 
of oil and "oilamina" videos and still images resulted; the avatar became 
hir own ecological catastrophe. I related this to the odd and abject 
sexuality and fluidity of the BP oil spill videos, creating "spills" and 
spews in the Humlab space seemed to wash away landscape, consciousness, 
and intentionality. There's a buried politics at work here, based on the 
majesty of large-scale environmental catastrophe and the horror that 
ensues. ]

The space Well/Brane is narratological, since objects will possess labels 
or signs appearing in the vicinity of avatars. It will also be aural, and 
in this sense more complex than the space in the first installation. Using 
the Beta 2.01 viewer (and its successors), I should be able to directly 
add webpages and videos to objects - videos that are differentiated from 
each other (in the first viewer, "media" allowed objects in a region to 
play only one video at a time). This gives me the opportunity to develop a 
narratology from within, based on differences among videos - not just, in 
other words, what occurs in a specific video, but what occurs as a result 
of difference among them. The same should hold true for audio.

[ The narrative elements I used were based on several sources. Aurally, 
I've worked with music, spoken narrative (both my own), and natural sounds 
recorded in Colorado; these sounds have been remapped into the Humlab 
space, creating interlocking realms. Visually, I've worked with language 
and signing texture-mapped on objects - the language constantly changing 
(it's imported from external directories). With all of this, the 
"ontological mashup" described above becomes evident - it's hard to tell 
what the _origin_ of speaking or writing is in the space - i.e. _who_ is 
speaking, and to _whom._ Offline and online worlds are deeply entangled - 
which is to say that inert and idiotic (Rosset) physical reality becomes 
deeply entangled with online abstract and completely constructed virtual 
reality. 

A visitor to the site - or someone watching a performance with this 
material - follows a complex diegesis which stumbles and backtracks upon 
itself. The nature of language and communication are called into question 
as signs appear and disappear at high speed, the avatar's gestures seem 
corrupted, and the negotiated performances seem completely out of hand, 
certainly out of touch. 

All of this is also connected to issues of body and sexuality; with 
texture-mapping, I was able to create reference points, intensifications, 
Barthes' puncta, as a kind of seduction. So whatever happened in the chaos 
sometimes seemed to resolve around sex, around flesh or meat, around 
bodily contortions reminiscent of everything from torture to sexual 
ecstasy. But these resolutions never held; what's visible is always in the 
midst of a turn towards an other (Other) that remains both internal and 
external, as if there were a coherence - where in fact there isn't any, 
and as if there were inhering - whereas things tend to disperse, fall 
apart, turn out not to be things at all. ]

This work will continue to use modified bvh animation files; at this point 
I want to use both older ones, and newer ones created directly in Poser. I 
want to explore "behavior collision" more systematically: an avatar 
following more than one animation structure at a time.

[ I stayed with the older files; I was more concerned with audio, with 
video texturing, with interspersed texts, with the problem of narrative - 
the imaginary of narrative - within virtual worlds. All of this adds up to 
a phenomenology based on relevance theory and attention economy.

Relevance theory is concerned with the hermeneutics of an environment - 
how are complex spaces interpreted, and what is relevant within the 
interpretation. Relevance is related to action and function: How one 
behaves in a space is connected to how the space is read.

Attention economy references the "bandwidth" of attention - one might say 
the political economy of attention - of the performer or online/offline 
spectator. (The online spectator may be _within_ Second Life, or observing 
Second Life in a public demonstration, i.e. on-screen.)

One only has a limited time to do anything, see anything, exist; the 
attention economy considers how this time is deployed, actively or 
passively. Within the Humlab installations, videos, and graphics, the 
issue is connected with negotiation - is it worth moving through an 
overly-busy space? What are the rewards? How does one _feel_ moving this 
way? What are the detriments? What is the politics of what might be read 
as overcrowding and ideological confusion? ]

I envision several public performances, with Foofwa d'Imobilite and Sandy 
Baldwin; the results will be documented in video, audio, and stills.

[ These performances were carried out at Humlab and in a space in East of 
Odyssey, with great success. Foofwa d'Imobilite performed in front of a 
screen projecting videos from the Humlab space; Sandy Baldwin worked with 
me "in world" - in other words, within Second Life. ]

The points of all of this:

1. To further explore dance/choreographic/behavioral issues in SL.
2. To further explore these within complex negotiated environments. 
3. To explore media-modified environments with contradictory video/audio 
materials.
4. To explore narratologies and performances in these environments.
5. To relate all of this to a developing philosophy of difference and 
contradiction.

[ This was done. I feel like a pioneer in virtual worlds, creating utterly 
"alien" performances, spaces, and avatars - i.e. without reference in our 
real, physical reality. Second Life gives me the opportunity to create, in 
a sense, ab nihilo; by doing this, I feel I can return to the older 
phenomenological states of bracketing - not taking the world for granted, 
but exploring all manner of other worlds. We are so used to considering 
avatar and virtual worlds as mockups of our own, emphasizing surrealism 
and fantasy - here, I explore worlds and states that aren't mockups, that 
are something other, something unaccountable. This is exciting research / 
work / art, and as far as I'm concerned, on the forefront of exploration 
into virtual spaces. It's filled with wonder for me. It draws me in, and I 
hope, draws you in as well. ]

Double (musical) Seance for Stephen Dydo and Adam Tobin


Rhythm from the Casio SK-1 with lead viola

Best yet because of accompaniment; in 4, it's a continuous chord and 
in 3 it's a series held in the SK-1's limited memory - starting and
stopping create the stanzaic structure of the piece.

Ah if I could only make money from my God-Given talent, what I would
do, after paying off my debts, to better this beautiful world!

Knots and Twirls in Super Second Living Space

http://www.alansondheim.org/knots.mp4

This goes on and on. So far so good, these are abacuses, objects counted, 
not too much out of line. If metaphor's involved, it's indexical. But then 
perhaps I bring in libido (Dionysian, analogic) and superego (Apollonian, 
digital), and I'm off and running. Before long I'm tied in Lacan's knots, 
a slippage that's always productive - how can it knot be? Language begins 
to curl, everything proceeds with a poetics of the real, and I'm lost, I'm 
lost... weather" or knot strings: used for knots, Borromean knots, imperm- 
anent subjectivities woven out of clotted postings.

And of the theory of knots. The midst of the embraiding of sheaves with 
mass knots, a story or displacement of organs, the linking of knots, and 
I'm off and running. Before long I'm tied in Lacan's knots, Borromean 
knots, impermanent subjectivities woven out of clotted embroidery. The 
midst of the embraiding of sheaves with mass flagu flagv *knotsu *knotsv 
*bezt charidx kern nurb *bevobj *taperobj knots, in knots each other into 
violent knots. They do go back.

A hollow tube closed with knots at both ends, Pestilence's canoe was 
quickly, Borromean knots, impermanent subjectivities woven out of clotted 
postings. I hung them from the window, I've tied myself in knots ... you 
could see the s/ms as 'controls': bondages, knots, sheaves, sadisms, 
ideological part- clots of subjectivities, knots and noted - each other 
into violent knots. They do go back to the knobs of the trees and their 
roots.

This topology with me, knots unraveling, coalescing no, you are many, are 
gnarls or knots in the timber, to an insufficiently high cutting-speed, so 
"Soften your sharpness, loosen your knots."

And my stomach's in knots. I'm falling over. I'm crawling, knotted up, 
knotted, so ill, they twirl, buckle and unbuckle constantly, forming and 
unforming, raveling and unraveling - with rafters, with the bark on high, 
the bark on high above.

Whose Bodies

http://www.alansondheim.org/whosebodies.mp4

I can't stand this piece, non-white bodies, like Auschwitz smoke of a 
future Amerika where "anchor babies" become synonyms for things, Mosques 
are carousels of debris, white Amerika cleanses and scours the newer more 
natural you. The virtual world is a perfect harbor for white fears, human 
smoke, violence changing the (apparently Jewish and liberal) fabric of 
space and time itself. What happens in Amerika doesn't stay in Amerika; it 
spreads like cancer, like there's no tomorrow and there might not be. I'm 
sick of humans, sick of slaughter, hatred, hunting; I'm sick of death and 
destruction, sick of fundamentalisms, sick of ignorance and rumor. Welcome 
to Kristallnachtundtag, worlds of pain and analysis, annihilation to the 
limit. And all I can do is make stupid videos I can't stand.



concentration-camp cafe

the jews have to play to stay alive
moslem-islam-yid music everyone's dancing
world war two plus 65 and look who's counting
someone's gone by the end of the day
burn the constitution and kneel down to pray

the poor orkestra tries again and again
fights break out between shtetls and atonals
drown out bayonetted anchor-baby screams
drop dead, go on and on, drop dead

someone's dead by the end of the day
burn the constitution and kneel down to pray

they're tearing up our street now and our building is shaking.
no surprise at that either.
i think we're going to have to move as the building falls apart.
thank god i'm white and wealthy and live in white america.
gotta learn to play, just in case the orkestra needs me.

let's beat up some jews and kick them out for being beaten.
tie anchor babies to the boats, nothing cleans like disappearance.
me i'm gonna suck up jesus christ any way i can.
he wants a blow job i'll give him a blow job.
i think my muslim friends better do the same.

What is a C C. They were clad there, how would you call it... C Cs, the 
violence of in/scribing; the _trap_ of public Cs for nearly a year. the 
earlier culture of existentialism, the Cafe served a similar purpose, and 
I went to the small Cafe inside the train station. The man who served me 
would use all of this to extend his connections into the Aumont's Cafe and 
I was watching the Lumieres' cinematograph - moving from the Cafe at the 
cross-roads, it's maybe a half mile away. I'm usually linked to Pierre at 
the Cafe and coupled otherwise to the Beaver. The wall, the Cafe closes 
for the night, red and white checkered tablecloth would lose its contact 
with the world, with the Beaver, who waits for me with Pierre at the Cafe 
shortly after Klein went to the small Cafe inside the train station. The 
man served me counterpoint; this is hardly the wide-awake state of 
Sartre's Cafe life: latenight at the C C Cafe and the orkestra repeats.

yearning


just barely escaping human smoke but angels beautiful in chorus
in chorus embers ever higher and soft slow sweeps of sky
'more planets' julu cries, 'more planets' jennifer remembers
and every day another with its smoke and moons and bother
there comes life in choral embers and lives apart in dark departures

http://www.alansondheim.org/yearn.mov

dreaming arches full of mist and someone's painful sadness
there are ones of sadness thinking everywhere among the stars
the cosmos bears and burns uncanny flesh and tissues
and someone's striking someone and someone's world is disappearing
o smoke, o human, o smoke of others' embers
of songs, o singing, singe-ing, o smoke of dying others



Katydid Slowed


Digitally slowed katydid songs - according to Darryl Gwynne, Katydids and 
Bush-Crickets Reproductive Behavior and the Evolution of the Tettigon- 
iidae, katydid songs can range (in certain species) to 135kHz, and it 
seems from the book that the true common katydids recorded at Mt Tremper 
probably sing up to 50kHz or so. In any case, here are the files slowed 
from the two forward mics of the four-track .wav, new music all its own. 
(25% original pitch.)

Thinking About Retiring

I'm considering retirement; I'm asking for advice (back-channel); I'm at a 
loss; I never thought I'd reach this point; it's a point of solitude; no 
offline community, students, teaching; useless beyond occasional online 
talks. I write too much, play (music) too much, think too much; it's too 
much for me; too much for anyone; it's me. My friends don't return calls; 
why should they; school's starting; all those residencies; commitments; I 
sit in this loft (assume it's "this loft"); face the computer screen; the 
viola; the keyboard; the video editing software; the guitar; the oud; I 
decide what to do; I owe nothing to anyone. People visit on occasion; use 
one or another of my pieces (video or music), disappear. I haven't seen 
Myk (lap steel) for months; he's gone. I put work up at ESP-Disk; assume 
someone listens; it's gone. Grants are gone; jobs are gone; I tire from 
calling friends who don't have the time to return calls; I sit here; I 
think this is a bother; admire my father who watches tv day in day out; 
takes rides in the country; babbles; never did a creative thing in his 
life; gave me chances I wouldn't otherwise have had; psychologically 
abused me; has been retired over forty years; reads sometimes. I need to 
know what to do; I'm getting suicidal; I live in vacuum; compose in 
vacuum; think philosophy or dance or art in vacuum; push my own work like 
an arrogant fool; wait for no returns; wait for the money to run out; the 
building to collapse around me.

I don't want to go back to school as a student; tour aimlessly around the 
country; volunteer for non-profits; my mind's still active. Invitations to 
schools; for performances; for equipment use; have stopped. I'm sick of 
the screen; this forced retirement; my sins have caught up with me; my 
numerous crimes have taken their toll; you know where to find me; you just 
don't know why.
