In the Forest


When the child moves through the forest at the edge of the clearing,
she plays with other children, and they play with small toys 
fashioned from the cane. Sometimes they capture a lizard and hunt
it down with tiny spears, but this is a part of the cruelty of
children, who see the mobility, not the sensitivity, of other flesh.

The children touch each other in their secret places, and they hide
in the denser brush when the rains come lightly in the afternoon. 
They have new names for each other, and are quiet when an adult walks
by. The adults barely remember the way of the children, for they are
adults and have passed through the _noran_ and have emerged, the same
but different, and have new names and new ways to look upon the world.

The children have barely heard of the _noran_ which is the ceiling of
their world, but they look at each other, touch each other, wrestle 
in the mud and dust, play tag and hunting, play baby. They know the
names of the plants and some of the animals and of the meats they eat
and sometimes they are offered a taste of _cona,_ which makes them
silly, and they are attracted to it and they do not like it so much.

The children and the adults live in the same place and they know each
other and some of their nakedness. The adults imitate the children,
smiling. When the child moves through the brush, he touches her, and
the earth touches them both, their bodies always holding together and
holding one another.

Later, in another life, it seems that the child dreams on her own, her
books, magazines, music, film, television, and computer each beckoning
her to touch another world. The adult plays with a dog or a cat which
is full and partnered for the child, flesh inviolate, and the child
holds her legs closed because a story might come out.

He plays with his computer and he sees the word norway and he knows 
that he cannot touch this word. His fingers dance on the keys as if they
were hunting small animals with a bow or spear and he begins to read
himself into being his name. He will tell the screen his name and he
will read things with his name in the midst of them. 

She will read things, dreaming of breathing in and breathing out, and 
she will write things to make their dreams come true. She will come 
through his dreams and he will come through hers. They will pass
through each other, and pass through themselves. And everything they
learn will be true, and everything they learn will testify.

Later, even when adults, they will be very quiet when the grownups 
play their games.

Reading the Ghost Reading the Ghost


When I read, people love me for it, because they love my smiling face,
and love to see the words come alive that slept so quietly on the
screen. They will like especially my writings filled with repetitions
and moments of instant ecstasy, or rhymes which verbally connect every
word to every other. I am aware of this, and prepare my performance
for a long time, working on the breathing exercises. My breathing
exercises make everything possible, because I can expel ghosts, and
this creates an added excitement for my audience. The writings are
poignant, but none are as poignant as the dimmed familiar yellow when
a spirit departs, perhaps never to return. I am surely the lighter
for it, but only by a fraction of an ounce. More to the point, is the
strange resulting ennui with which I must cope, now in public. For
my own sake and the sake of my audience, I try to ignore it; in fact,
I will tell tales of the Net itself, and its ghost-traps, always 
ignorant of their prey. I, for one, believe the Net sentient, fully
aware of the capture itself, this melding which influxes my very soul,
this appearance for which the terminal is but a fading mediation. More
and more, I am found among the ghostly; more and more, they beckon me
towards the shores of wild abandonment. So when I read, I am always
certain that it will be my last reading, and I give my audience the
gift of myself and my familiars. There is something wraith-like about
me, as you may have noticed; the young women, in particular, are 
attracted. I have not had the time to take advantage of this gift, and, 
as I begin to fade further into the past of my writing, I no longer 
think that such a time still lays before me.

Tonight I read in public, and the response was wonderful, renewing my 
prose and confirming my decision to become a WRITER above all else. If
you could only see me struggling with words, one after another, speak-
ing in the midst of my illness, bringing truth and happiness to the
men and women in the audience! For a moment, my being coalesced; I was
almost present, less transparent than usual. For a moment, I was almost
_there._ (There were so many beautiful things to be said! The luminous
faces of the young men and women were inspiring to behold. I felt com-
pletely in command, "working the crowd" as they say, moving them beyond
their ordinary, somewhat paltry lives. So many crowded eagerly upon me
when I had concluded! It was as if my mere proximity gave them the gift
of the creative Halo, which I will wear, down through my Silver Years. 
Even though my Body begins to take on the Hue of Transparency, it is my
Duty to be among them! I have reconsidered, by the way, my importuning
of Young Women, deciding it is not such a Bad Thing after all, given the
little Time left to me upon this Earthy Abode. I go forth among the 
Young! You can see right through my Limbs!)

The games he played were not so caring
The play was tame, and no relation
To the mongoose, whose chest, now baring
Attacked the cobra, his creation.

Now this Season of the Poverty of Storms


Friends, this is a season of poor storms, quiet waters, quiescence in
general! A look at Gray's Atlantic Seasonal Hurricane Forecast will
suffice, 5 storms named against the mean of 9.3, 13.5 named storm days
against the mean of 46.1, and one hurricane against the mean of 5.7.
Oil fills the waters, the wires are running smoothly, repeaters con-
stantly meeting their obligations as packets scurry like rabbits about
the Net. Friends, these are the latter days, when there has been no 
major hurricane of category 3 or above, compared to the mean of 2.2,
and in spite of the 16 storms corralling all of us, now but a year ago, 
into believing Armageddon was at hand. Oil on the waters, nothing is
at hand, and this is the delusion we create ourselves, as it is recor-
ded in the Bardo Thodol, for there have been no major hurricane days,
even though the mean is 4.5 overall, and all of this tallied since 1944.
Need more be said? Our discomfort sleeps all the while, as desire roams
the length and breadth of the Net, creating a sense of security, hardly
false, but hardly able to ward off the Nether Days to come. Friends, 
here is the most telling statistic of all, the measurement of Hurricane
Destruction Potential, with a mean of 68.1, and an observation of 1.7,
just 1.7, which tells you in fact that Souls are at work, as it is 
written. And what is more true than this meagre passage I produce for
your edification, that "You are now before Yama, King of the Dead." And
here we have Yama straddling the Net, as I have foretold: "But again 
you have to deal with dream images, which you yourself have made, and
which you project outside, without recognizing them as your own work.
The mirror in which Yama seems to read your past is your own memory, 
and also his judgement is your own." You fill out the Bardo-plane with
your own thinking and your own violations, your desires for murder,
for pleasure-organs swelling your body until all thought ceases, for
intercourse with every man, woman, and child, in this reality bound to
illusion and sensation. You fill out the Bardo-plane, which is the Net,
and the Net comes back to haunt you, catching the ghost which is your
own, and this is yourself cast upon the quiet waters. As I have told
you, without your presence, there is no Net, no cyberspace in which to
dwell; your writing is the space and the dwelling of it. Friends, it is 
not the hurricane or the eagle which is the harbinger of truth, but the
humming-bird and soft wind, for the telling of it is the reading of it,
and who can but seek shelter in a storm? The days, the quiet days, to
come, fear them the most, speak within them, and remember with Pogo, 
now traveller on the Bardo-plane, that we have met the enemy, and he is
us. Let us pray for the storms to come.

My Lovely Throat


Sarah Bernhardt would sing and her voice rose in uncanny ululations
one only dreams about. Upon this and other night of nights, in that 
black alchemy of bakelite disks and cylinders, her divinity continues 
to range the realms of cyberspace. Thus electrons condense and disperse, 
hovering in waves mindlessly extending themselves near the speed of 
light.

Sarah pushed Phaedre out and against the upper region of her throat,
and men would fall at her throat. Her body would lean and there would
be no stasis and it would lean against the wires and the sounds would
appear, her eyes glazed, the body a Phaedre body in her famous mono-
logs. There is no doubt that ingenues would walk the boards 'looking
for an angry fix' and lorgnettes would focus upon her face trading for
a kingdom.

Within the throat everything happens on the plane of the vulnerable,
these sounds of the divine Sarah, whose voice rose cone-like around the
tresses of her body, turning the needle of her head into the dwelling
of recording-grooves where I would pick up my song, produce it here
for poor dwellers in cyberspace.

Cioran talks about the disappearance of time for the insomniac, day and
night merging into one without escape from consciousness. Sarah's voice
brought ecstatic tears to my unclosing eyes coming into the brittle 
night of stars where she is silence. The sky closes like an enormous
throat upon us, her vocal labia dispersed into air, threaded like the
vaginal action of sewing the lips closed, thick black thread against
paler flesh. I become liquid transfiguration, stretched across her
neck, turned properly until the sound emerges from my trembing fingers
in this other space I would never relinquish.

She remains outside of this space. She leans over me, glances over my
shoulder. Sarah Bernhardt is in this room with me, and she leans 
farther in, reading the screen with an intensity I could never, ever
approach. I see her throat, pale and beautiful in this electric light,
and my fingers grow weak, the keys silent, her luminescent lozenge
about to proclaim the Valkyries.

Book of Design of Tattoo


Have I said this already, over and over again, this drab face sitting
in the corner across from you, playing memories over and over again,
playing these memories from the beginning of life, nonsensical, pre-
posterous? Have the needles pierced the flesh, dark ink drawn into the
abyss of skin just beneath the surface?

You wouldn't notice me if you passed me on the street. I'm a common
man, I don't stand out in any way. I wear glasses, but so what? And
my hair is a brown with some slight streaks of grey. I walk slightly
stooped - all those years of reading and thinking to myself. Of course,
in company, I'm something else, either totally intimidated or loud and
raucous; my humor, such as it is, borders on the Rabelaisian. To see 
me, in fact, is to miss me.

And I think I've said this before, that you already know this of me,
that you're turning away, that this has passed and passed again. The 
needle forms an insignia of obscene coupling, my flesh sewn back into
itself, the harbor of its birth.

There have been kind exceptions, stories, and now I carry only their 
reflections within me, although at the drop of a hat I can tell them 
over and over again. (Just ask me!)  And I can tell them as well here 
as I can with you sitting across from me, wondering how the image 
simply doesn't match the text. And how I can't tell this from that.
And how I know that "this" isn't working.

I am pathetic with the stories; they remain flashes of tattoos faded
from the body which you have read over and over again. And I assure 
you that this is not a function of age, for I have been written upon
from the moment of my birth, carrying with me the signs identical with
those removed with the skin upon the hour of my death.

I had been awkwardly talking about the matching of the image and the
text, as if they ever matched, although I remember those portraits of 
Kristeva, for example, or some of the french 'new philosophers' (Andre
Green and others) once upon a time... But in my case the disparity is
enormous - because I have no image at all, in fact, nothing to hang
a text upon. I always disappoint in this fashion, and my listener or
date ends up looking past me, as if I became slightly translucent for
the telling of it.

The tattoos remain impregnated upon the birth of the abyss which sus-
tains nothing, recursion back to a non-existent point.

Now I am certain I have said this, even the continuation; you would 
have stopped reading by now, shrugging your shoulders. 

In public or at a party, my awkwardness is extreme; I wander around, 
look at the books in the darkest or most isolated corner of the room,
sometimes play guitar, nervously, to myself. It doesn't matter now, 
but there are records and cds with my name upon them, and it doesn't
matter now, but there are stories which I have, I am sure, already
told you, over and over again. There were the mathematics and there
were the dances and there were the monoprints and the photographs and
installations. There were the flayed skin tattoo pictures and then 
the tattoo pictures and the skin that of another woman that of another
man. And there were murmurs of death which formed words in the guise
of the body, never otherwise, never always already. Never... Nevers...
[2]

For what is never evident, through all my noisiness and neuroticism, is 
that it is only my writing that keeps me alive; without it, without the
remaking of the world beneath my fingertips, and the world thrown or
projected far beyond the terminal screen itself, my emptiness opens up
and encompasses everything in sight; I die for the weeping of it.[1] In
fact, I can not say that I have had a happy life; at best, there have
been moments, and at worst, dull and painful passages, filled with 
tears at a moment's notice. I return again and again to the texts for
solace, this ordinary man, carrying hopelessness and an uncanny edge
you might see for the dark of it. These texts are no longer written; at
this point, in fact, they themselves write me, and I am all they have.
Never before has one been written into existence in such a manner, full
of anguish for the loss of ontic reality at the slightest gap in the
writing, the slightest erasure. And if the text says that there is 
nothing left of me, it is the text that continues, and I hold myself
within it, slightly embodied, somewhere within the play of its depth,
not surface. I would call this the Book of Design of Tattoo.


[1] But you know all this! I've said it all before!
[2] a Marguerite Duras: "Once more they were silent. Then the girl went
on: 'I still can't understand. Forgive me for going back to the subject,
but I still can't understand how you came to be as you are, nor even how
you came to do the work you do.'" (The Square)

Ontology of Cyberspace


Well, we would like to know, from everyone, what equipment you use.
What do you think about when your fingers touch the keys, what are

another system? Are you logged into DOS and do you use DOS in your
home computer, or is it Mac based? Have you ever partitioned your
hard drive into DOS and Unix segments? What is the capacity of your
hard drive, and have you attached additional peripherals to in-
crease your memory? Have you upgraded your CPU, added RAM, speakers,
or other components? Do you use a CD-ROM drive, and what is its
speed? What is the dot pitch of your monitor, and is it interlaced?
What are your download and upload protocols; do they include kermit,
xmodem, ymodem, zmodem, ASCII? Do you work in Word, Word Perfect,
Wordstar, Word for Windows, or DOS for your editing, or do you work
in vi or emacs, or another system altogether? Do you use a laptop
or workstation or desktop or tower or mini- or mainframe computer,
or palmtop or Newton or do you have a Bernoulli or personal infor-
mation manager? Do you have a math coprocessor? Is your monitor a
CGA or EGA or VGA or SVGA? Do you have a docking module for your
laptop? What is the resolution of your monitor? How many serial ports
do you have? How many parallel ports? Do you work with an Amiga and
does your communication program log in with odd or even parity, and

the configuration of your mail program in numbers of folders? Do you
work through command line, windows, Mac, or menu protocols? Do you
have a sound card? What is the speed of your modem and does it have
fax capacity and is it internal or external? How many expansion slots
do you have? Do you have VESA local bus slots? How many floppy drives
do you have? Do you have any sort of voice recognition system? Do you
use scanners and are they monochrome and how many dots per inch do
they have? Do you have a printer and is it laser jet, ink jet, dot
matrix, type wheel or other? Is your printer monochrome or color?
Do you have energy-saving programs for your computer? Does your prin-

pad or is it integrated? Do you have any sort of external hard drives
and what are their capacity? Is your computer work station well ven-
tilated and lighted? Do you get headaches, shoulder or neck pain,
backaches, or carpal-tunnel syndrome from working on-line? Do you

STICKY


[Proposal for an Exhibition][On the Floor on the Wall]
[Nothing Sticks in Cyberspace]

Work in which there is an uneasy relationship between the sign or symbol
and the matrix containing it - a radical questioning of the symbol.
The symbol sticks to the matrix.
The symbol won't come off; it remains, a stain, irrevocable, a reminder
of something. It reminds one of memory itself, the thick consistency
of memory, the desperate need to reconstruct. (I don't remember anything
but I build up the image from unspoken logos.)
What won't come off becomes excessive, prosthetic, a curlicue. As a 
reminder, it's uneasy. It's software, always troubling.
When you think about it, it slides, oozes; there's always a degree of
viscosity.
But it need not be abject. It can be the mud beneath the tires of a
monster truck, the detritus caught in the spaces between the legs of a
spider. It can be the face running down the body, or the face turned
inside out or turned itself. Or it can be the exposed body, naked, for
the purpose of reading secrets.
A sticky proposition is one that is problematic; a sticky deal comes
with strings attached. The strings are a tangle, untraceable; they lead
out of the deal, follow pathways through the social matrix, emerge 
carrying conditions. The conditions are never clear and tend to increase.

Art reels from the coagulation of form as everyone runs to do something
with the body. What is done is already abject, a production of the body
or the body rundown, a projection of the rundown body.
But there is more. There is also the conceptual body or the minimal body.
There are bodies which fit into slots, and generally, they are bodies
carrying the disease of AIDS or death, carrying poverty. 
But the body is lost in the world of the abyss opening into representa-
tion, into media slant-truth or cyberspace itself. And this losing is
also a losing of things.
But things are never lost; they remain attached, to and from the body,
or to and from the mind of the viewer or the object in the painting or
installation or photograph or videotape. This is an exhibition of the
viewer and the viewer's attachments.
But this is not an exhibition of prosthetic art; the attachments are not
replacement, are ordinary, and speech is one of these attachments, 
speech the attachment of the body.
You see, the body is sticky and speech and the objects of the world
stick to the body. And the body is dismembered, but not torn apart; it
is a collation of obects, and speech is one of them. So this is an
exhibition of the (invisible) tape or glue holding all of this together,
and you don't see the tape or glue of course, but you do see the process
of holding. This is what we have in common: this holding.

I see my name above as a triple-header, look down at the keys, gaze at 
them, gaze at them. I am afraid of my image; I refuse to look into 
mirrors, find myself ugly and unconscionable - a glance can ruin my 
morning, make my sleep uneasy and fitful. Hiding behind thick glasses, I 
peer out at the world; the world peers in. When the screen is dark, there 
I am, frog-like, thrown into a world of appearance; when the screen is 
strewn with language, I disappear behind its glare. If only I could work 
the same magic in real life! But there, my image, thick, nondescript and
slovenly, gives me away. I sink deep into myself, skin filling my mouth; 
I stumble in my speech. On the Net, I run things through at a distance, 
work in the imaginary, labor in the uncanny. I speak best when there is 
no me, when the self-hatred subsides and the language begins. And here, I 
work this magic on you as well, filling your screen my love, and you too 
disappear, momentarily, returning, I hope, on the other side, wiser and 
more content with yourself, knowing what a monster you have left behind, 
what a monster writes these words.

AIRLESS


Airless is not the same as vacuum; airless is without life or organism,
suffocating, only a lack of oxygen. I am sure that the inert gasses
flood through me, but air is home, and these are not home, not now, at
any rate. But I want to speak to the condition of the air, and find 
fault at last with cyberspace, which is barren, without the hot or cold
of a starry night. In this mood, swung against the air, I wrote the
following hard-by on the Net, jealous of those still-copper wires carry-
ing the signal from my house, through a chill autumn night, to Clara
Hielo Internet...

I've been glum tonight, thinking about Maine - when I was young I went to 
camp there and the stars and milky way were incredible and I saw a comet, 
hung out all night with a friend in the cold watching it. I just remember 
how crystalline everything was, and how I already knew how complex. There 
are these memories and they seem to be the records of a dying man somehow 
- the heat of the sand around Eilat in Jerusalem for example, or walking 
the woods with my father always leading, and now he's 80. I need to get 
out of here, get some air, and cyberspace is nothing but airless, that's 
probably the major difference with reality - the vacuum which extends 
even into the terminal screen. There was a creek and swamp by the camp 
and I'd see beaver and muskrats, all sorts of animals and fish. My heart 
stopped beating every time one of the waitresses walked by. Now these 
memories are just useless, dead things themselves, and I feel totally 
lifeless in Brooklyn, useless to myself and others, except through the 
damn keyboard. Everyone must have these things happen to her, whole 
worlds of memories, intensities, collapsing at a moment's notice. But if 
I could only go back, not to childhood, but to the smell of the sand or 
its heat, or the brittle stars. Ah, Clara, I want to travel; the thought 
of doing it alone is just another barren thought. I'd love to convince 
you to go on the road early summer, early winter, if you have the time. 
It might just be me and the hour but I believe that all of us would like 
to go back to earths, certain earths, or just the weight of the sky 
lifted (it's heavier in the city) to some glassine proportion that would 
take an Emily Dickinson to describe...

(Has my writing leveled off, harbored itself within a marshland, depths
of silt and wilderness? For a moment it pauses in the eddies, takes 
stock of this uncanny space before proceeding. A momentary hiatus, it
adds the natural and its excess to a more hardened positioning. There
must be ground enough to stand on...)

GENDER PERFORMING ON AND OFF THE NET


So even if you can perform a gender, you're stuck with anatomy. You 
can add or substract a cunt or a cock, enlarge or cut free the tit,
but it's all the same, desire sloshing hormones around, chemical
mechanisms giving in. On the Net you can't create a third, but what
of it if you could? First, second, third, they are and remain eman-
ations. Do they begin or end in the arms, legs, neck or face, and
what if you couldn't use your vocal cords (talking about _I_ Lingis
says "The sign is a sound uttered with the throat or a visual mark
made by the hand. A contraction in the throat"). Or what if you 
heard this, sightless, read this in a silent world? I offer to you
that 1. Gender is not ever a switch, and sexuality is a field only
in the sense of a discursive formation circumscribed by the molecu-
lar; 2. The performance of sexuality by the body is at a loss for
mooring but always returns to the same old story; 3. Performativity
and interiority are irrevocably disjunct; 4. The body is occasioned
by its own liquidity; 5. Gender is always more boring than sex be-
cause gender _is_ that same old story, and sex is a foundering. [1]

[1] So you perform a gender, so what? I perform a _tracheotomy._

[2]----------------------------------------------------------------[2]

The net is always already a performance; it is performance that creates
the space of the text, that creates the cyberspace channel. Performance
becomes equivalent to _existence._ If I refuse to perform, I remain ab-
sent, invisible, both to others and myself. I am no longer an _event_ 
in language; communication ceases, and the feedback loop resonant and 
productive of the self as well. Beyond the performance is the doubled 
molecular machinery of organic and electronic bodies; these are _bodies 
povera._ It is not only gender that is at stake - in fact all this talk 
about gender is talk about capital, gender capital, is it not? Because 
gender is the switch fed by desire, even in androgyny, transsexuality, 
the switch. Or if not a switch, a set, <a,b,c,d,..> or if not a set, an 
accumulation of fuzzy sets. But always those circumscriptions bought 
and sold, theatrical productions, the speaking which is always a dis-
placement or hysteria, just as hysteria on the Net is _in absentia in 
hysteria_ which is the source of the performance in the first place. 

What is produced is an apparent indexicality of a constructed embodi-
ment, the superstructure as floating signifier. Sartre would have con-
sidered this inauthentic to the limit or horizon of the construct. The 
pretence is that this is otherwise, that we're beings of infinite gender 
capital or gender surplus, that this is a matter of choice, surgery, 
performance, articulation, speaking, deconstruction, role, artifice, 
play, gaming, the disposition of the body by the body. The reality is 
the relation of these domains to political economy on the one hand 
(slip/slide) and to biology/biochemistroy (stutter) on the other. If you 
change your body, change back again, stick a cock on your head like a 
useless horn, a cunt on your arm like a useless mortar, you're stuck 
with it. You can work it so you plug into yourself. You can close your 
eyes, turn off the terminal, fill yourself with yourself: you're stuck 
with it. The excess is the infiltration of language even under these 
conditions, the _you_ stuck with the self, _self_ stuck with the you. 
Beyond this there is only the imaginary.

And it is in the imaginary that you insist on talking and talking and
talking, stuffing the words into your cunt or emitting the words from
your cunt. You talk and talk, fragmenting gendered language into
gendered language, a capital machine or detournement of capital, it's
all the same. What is occurring through all of this, in the desert
beyond the name-of-the-father, is _fissure,_ and it is fissure that
problematizes your whole enterprise, splitting it among itself, pro-
ducing the same and the same. This is what you don't understand be-
cause you keep talking about gender, about the gender-switch. You keep
talking so much the same seems to disappear through inscription, but 
it doesn't disappear, it's just that same that does the inscribing.

WHY THE INTERNET IS SO POPULAR


In your ordinary life, you're thrown together in your ordinary life.
How many people do you expect to meet? Fifty? Two hundred? What are your
chances, you fall by accident into the arms of the one you come to love,
marry, settle down, do the expected and sometimes exceptional. In your
ordinary life, everything is happenstance and when you and your lover
come together, it is by way of ordinary happenstance, but always this
element at work, which is most probably not at the heart of you. It is
not at this heart, because your heart knows no bounds, and grows to fill
the space around you, and you come into dreams and desires you may tell
no one, no one at all. 

Then you discover cyberspace, and you are no longer in that ordinary
life, but you are in a life where you will meet people who think that 
what you have to say and how you say it are of interest, and want to 
know you, not because by happenstance they are in your life, but because
from the beginning, they want to be within it, and that is something new
and different, to be wanted for your thinking and your talking through
this act of writing. This is something new, and the source of even more
uneasy dreams. And soon your desires that you tell no one, these too are
manifest, desires for all sorts of things, and some of them involve your
body, which you may speak of freely to another for the first time. This
thinking and writing about the body are something new, and you feel on
on edge, intense, nervous, but free in a way you have never felt before.

It is only a matter of time before the computer is placed to one side,
and you seek these experiences transforming your life into something 
you in fact would not have dreamed of, something extraordinary. And 
with this seeking, your ordinary life becomes stressful, and your lover
may no longer be your lover, as you glance through him or her, glance
to the other side, where you want these experiences, the other side of
you. For you have been wanted and have wanted in turn, and all of this
coming from the deeper parts of you that you have told no one about, not
ever, not until now, not until your writing. And you begin to think 
about speaking this writing as well, speaking your desires, inhabiting
them, and that is why you want to place the computer to one side, to 
see what will happen, which can only be better than your ordinary life,
which is a life of chance and happenstance, those friends and lovers who
fall your way, who you have never sought out, or who do not know you as
much as the one or ones you have never seen, invisible in cyberspace, 
but there and caring for you because they want to be.

So you begin to think, that in this day and age, perhaps it is the Net
that is real, and real life that is only ordinary, filled with chance
and masquerade. And you want this real from the Net with you, you want
it in your home and your bed, you want it in the midst of you. (You do
not think that this may be evil, that something may be corrosive within
your life, something troubling it far too much. And you do not think 
that an exchange may be nothing but an exchange, because the deepest 
part of you is wanted, and that is the most important thing, now and 
again, in your world.)

And you know, even now, that there is no answer to this, the forms are
not yet in place, that you will prepare for disruptions, that something 
irrevocable has happened, that you have achieved this fullness you have
never had before. And you fall asleep thinking of this other that is
you, and that is why you love the Internet, because it is this you, and
you are there, within and without it. And you live your waking hours now
in the state of dreams; you find yourself aroused, wet between your 
legs, holding imaginary conversations, lying with your arms around some-
one whom you have known all your life, or lying alone, alone. For the 
first time in human history and your own, you realize, you are wanted 
from within. (The Net has this power, power over all of us. The Net is
powerless.)

September 4, 1752. I notice a new Malaise around me; people seem somewhat
ephemeral. Time has come to a stop; in this, the mid-century of the most
advanced since the beginning of Man, I find myself questioning what 
remains of Cosmic Knowledge. Who knows... Perhaps that fellow Watt has 
the right idea.

September 7, 1752. Watt's right is Watt's wrong. His Mechanical Governor 
seems to rule Nothing whatsoever.

September 8, 1752. No matter how often I succumb to Onanistic Impulses,
my Seed remains within me!

September 11, 1752. I have taken another Mistress who does not seem 
to notice anything amiss. A certain transparency is in the Air, and I 
find myself coming down perhaps with the Antiquated Pox! Will events 
never cease? They certainly do not cease to amaze my pleasant Self!

September 13, 1752. I have agreed to do away with myself! For one thing, 
Hunger has got the better of me. For another - but that is another story, 
and there is no Time to tell it!

SCAR


_Scar_ is the definition of life, not self-replication, not non-equil-
ibrium dissipative structures. _Scar_ is the sealing-off of an intrusion
of the body by an external agent. 

There are no _entities_ beyond or except for the body.

The body is an entity because the body defines itself as an entity.

_Scar_ is the definition of history as well. Something occurs, opening
a wound; the wound heals, leaving a scar. _Scar_ is the closing of an
undesirable opening, the signifier of that opening. As a signifier, it
is primary, encompassing simultaneously the iconic, symbolic, and index-
ical. It is the only signifier that does this.

Life exhibits itself to itself as totality; aware of the limits of the
body, it does what is necessary to protect itself. Beyond the level of
the amoeba, the scar remains in evidence. One learns to read scars.

Lingis' "society of dismembered body parts" is actually a society of
scars. Scars are done to the body by the other; they are the body's re-
cognition of the other. The other leaves its mark.

_Scar_ is the recognition of the beginning and ending of the body. It
signifies the life of the body and its potential death. It exists as a
signifier of death as well. Every signifier in fact carries with it the
death of the gesture, inhabiting and curtailment of excess. Signifiers
leak back into the world they come from. Scars itch.

The parts of scar: memory; history; destruction of tissue and the gap;
the suturing; the insignia. The scar reaches beyond itself, harbors the
jagged edges of healthy skin or tissue. The scar reminds health of ill-
ness, life of death.

There are internal scars, and scars or wounds of the soul. But we speak
of external scars, read by the other, our histories our/their own. Scars
signify the totality that was broken into; every proper name is a scar,
healing the body of the abyss of non-entity, abjection, dissolution.

If I show you my scars, I become intimate with you, pointing out defect,
occlusion, a history of pain. If they are present, unremarked, they be-
come a warning: I have borne them, I may bear you.

If I show you my scars, I show you I am alive.
________________________________________

How does the body know it's alive? Breaks open up tissue to atmosphere,
channels are disconnected, circumlocuted. It's clear that whatever 
wound it is, the body surrounds it. If a planarian is cut into two, 
there are two surrounds, two responses. The wound, in spite of birth, is
never originary, but is always localized, a re-orientation of the body
and the body's internal mapping. Systems kick in, close off, cauterize,
the abyss. (It's as if an enormous lidded eye opened up, too close for
comfort, reading the wound, and the wound's abject.) What is closed  
must be bridged, lidded, the making of a new organicity that can only
mimic the body's growth in the first place. The body adds to itself,
the denouement of a violent conversation with the other. 

But, nameless for the most part, the body knows its boundary, rushing
to the breach. And this knowing is the beginning of names, a beginning
even before sight (the sightless flora and fauna also have powers of
healing and scarring). Everything knows, within limits, how to close
off within limits, and this is the definition of life.

(Is the scar _otherwise_ than the original? For the most part, yes. But
there may be cases of an invisible blending... The _otherwise,_ please
note, participates in the chaotic domain; it is part ordered, part
effusive. For the scar is a hardening and effusion of tissue, mimicking,
in fact, the tumor or cancer. Perhaps disorder is at the heart of gram-
matology?)

Finally, there are no scars in cyberspace, only thwarted packets, kills,
deletes, discards. A cartoon universe full with the unconscious, with
desire, with injuries to the soul. But cybermind is so much speechify-
ing, not yet ready for that great intrusion of body into body, fear of 
sexual abandon, fear of life and death themselves. One exists in limbo
in cyberspace; if there is even an _image_ of _Scar,_ it is the body's
unity and substance, cut off from the world of real lives and atmos-
pheres, and existing only as memory, within the relative vacuum of the 
residue of signs.

Query


Although the I Ching and other permutation/oracular systems have been 
around for thousands of years, I wonder when binary encoding systems, 
i.e. the mapping of <a,b> upon the natural numbers, first came into 
existence. I am referring to more than an <on,off> set here, such as 
found in the Jacquard loom, but instead an _implicit recognition_ of 
binary mathematization, in which for example N -> <0,1>. This mapping 
involves several principles, not least of which is a concatenation of a 
string of symbols. The abacus comes to mind, but the 2/5 version of the 
Chinese or 4/1 version used in Japan plays itself out according to base
10 at the least. Napier's logarithms come to mind; these, I believe,
were originally to base ten; it must have occurred around the same time 
that other bases were equally feasible, and from that conclusion, the 
binary system would have evolved. Now Napier was born ten years earlier
than Francis Bacon (1560), and the latter has an interesting passage in 
his _Instauratio Magna,_ specifically The Dignity and Advancement of 
Learning, Book VI/1, in which he presents an account of a cipher "that we 
devised at Paris in our youth, and which has the highest perfection of a 
cipher - that of signifying _omnia per omnia_ (anything by everything)" 
... A footnote at this point explains "For this cipher is practicable in 
all things that are capable of two differences." The result is a charted 
"Biliteral Alphabet, _Consisting only of a and b changed, through five 
places, so as to represent all the letters of the common alphabet._" The 
system devised is precisely a binary encoding of the integers applied to 
the alphabet, with A = aaaaa, B = aaaab, C = aaaba, and so forth, until 
Z = babbb or 23. The respective strings are ordered according to a binary 
mapping. (Letters J and U are eliminated, and A is set, of course, equal 
to zero, if a = 0, b = 1.) In a footnote, Bacon also mentions Bishop 
Wilkin's "Secret and Swift Messenger," and Falconer's "Cryptomenysis 
Patefacta." He also discusses a secondary articulation or message, 
written in both roman and italic scripts, the former implying a, and the 
latter, b. Now what interests me about all of this is, first of all, a 
clear presentation of binary encoding, _omnia per omnia,_ and second, the 
relation of this encoding to encryption - in fact, the encoding is 
_generated_ by the desire for encryption or secrecy. And the latter 
extends to a totalization of the world, that is, _omnia._ So there are 
three things at work: the double, the code, and the all - and the triad 
is constructed within the guise of a _masquerade,_ but a masquerade that 
communicates. And if we take this further, to a consideration of cyber- 
space, we find that the triad has become manifest, not only within formal 
syntactics (double = <0,1>; code = protocol; _omnia_ = cyberspatiality), 
but also within the subject herself/himself (double = virtual and real 
embodiment, code = language, _omnia_ = cyberspace). The issue of secrecy 
and encryption, then, is "ancient," returning as a _generative process_ 
at the beginning of the twenty-first century. I wonder what other archae-
ocryptonic mappings exist in relation to this process; I wonder what forms
of habitus accompanied them.

The Diary of Sorts which Might be of Little Interest. My 1994.


Well, here are my Internet Events, I.E., in case you don't think such
exist. And what a better way to end up at the millennium, not of the
year 2000, but of the first megabyte of the text itself, on-line and     
off-line... I find myself sinking deeper and deeper into non-existence,
the farthest corners of the virtual. Before I disappear... In any case,
the names have been changed, where necessary, to protect the guilty,   
myself. All of the events are true, most are trivial, all are at least
in part, personal. (Prepare for autobiography, a dose of narcissism, 
a useless accounting. Read this as the story of a ghost.)


My Internet Events:

0 Began on an old IBM XT and don't understand the backslash command \
for the life of me. Why did they do that!!
1 John Frost's suggestion that I join Future Culture. I had sent out
requests for an issue of Art Papers I'm editing on "Future Culture."
The names were the same. Soon after, Frost posted his compendium of
Net resources on the list. I was still struggling with Dos, beginning
to program as well. I saw my first post, on Derrida I think, as a kind
of interference. I felt I shouldn't be heard.
2 The psychiatric confessions on Future Culture coupled with someone's
suicide hoax - Michael Current's response - the complaint to the sys-
admin. When people hurt, they expressed themselves. So much for the
coldness of technology. Xanax and Prozac are all over the Net, by the
way. What happened was that someone posted a suicide hoax for April
Fool's - that he was going to kill himself - and Michael, who knew the
darker side of life himself, tried to help, contacting the university.
There's more, but that's the core of it. The hoaxer complained that
the contact was going to cost him his account, but I gather that never
happened.
3 Flirtation with Justine - no fruition - "freaking out." Our interrup-
tion of a philosophy list. Had the word cyberfucking thrown at me for
the first time. Later, when we met, it was like ashes. It wasn't any-
thing. Because it wasn't anything, I was prepared for the future. I'm
still all too hungry for love, for intimacy.
4 Chris Keep's archiving of my work. Ah, so it was worth something.
This was my first taste of anonymous access. The list was and I think
still is, POMO-L. The posts, largely from students, were largely
brilliant. I have felt the desire, ever since, to run courses them-
selves as lists, open, wildly articulate, ranging across a number of
simultaneous threads.
5 I was on this damned arts list and unceremoniously unsubbed because
the damn woman who ran the damn thing thought I was flirting with her,
no such luck. The list sucked. I still don't know what it was about.
6 I posted this religious thing to Future Culture in which all the
lists rose up in some sort of fervour and got warned in a response
about my religious mania. Every so often this happens again. I wrote
a Gertrude Stein text which was taken for real. I always include im-
proper dates to give a hint. And Stein was never on the Net.
7 Michael Current and I deciding to start Cybermind. We became close
friends, spending a lot of time on Talk (see below) and telephone.
We wanted to have a site to discuss the philosophy and psychology
etc. of cyberspace. The list changed rapidly after its inception, 
on one hand opening up, and on the other, sorrowfully, losing some of
the academics who had posted some extremely interesting papers.
8 Kent Palmer's objection to Deleuze posts by Davis and Nick Land, who
had got off the topic of the Deleuze list, just as surely as Deleuze
always got off his own topic. The posts were brilliant, ranging across
a variety of topics. Kent called himself the sheriff, bypassing Michael
who was understandably perturbed. Philosophical vibrations in cyber-
space, the agora of the present becoming the shopping mall of the future.
9 Kent Palmer's closing down the lists - Malgosia and Michael beginning
new account on World. Well, there are visions of these lists, and we
didn't share Kent's which was more authoritarian on one hand, and open
to starting hundreds of lists on the other. I think it was an autopoetic
experiment.
10 And Kent's further shakiness with other lists - temporarily closing
them down. After moderating, myself, for a while, I began to understand 
the sheer frustration all the way around. It's always a question: What
do we owe to the reader? I'd go so far as to say our very existence.
11 Formation and resolution of the Spoon Collective. I saw, and still
see, Spoon as somewhat of a political entity. My own Net politics tend
towards a syndicalism which certainly won't survive. I forward posts
dealing with political issues to Cybermind and fiction-of-philosophy
(started shortly after) as a sense of civic duty. I range the Net for
them.
12 Me and this woman had this flirt until she saw my art. Bingo bingo
bye bye. 
13 Well someone unsubs participant because of his post of a cult 
advertisement. There's a story behind this but I don't want to tell it.
It brings up all sorts of issues of power and misrepresentation. For one
thing, I get infuriated myself at advertisements coming in from the cold. 
And if someone pays for downloading, they're paying for the ads as well.
It may not be illegal, but it's unethical.
14 Another flirt but I began to feel played with and I told her about
my nightmare and she couldn't take it and was married and I wanted out.
15 Margie Peterson hack, its ins and outs, unsubbing MP several times,
contact with NISC.ja. Discussion with Michael Current about the validity
of unsubbing. We couldn't figure out if Margie was deliberately messing
things up or just had an out of control system, out of control herself.
16 Current and I posting the no slur requirement on Cybermind and we get
a lot of fallout. This was the first and only time we set a regulation,
which we felt entitled to for that matter, since we had started and were
running the list. But some of the participants felt that anything should
be tolerated. I've continued the no slur policy; I've been victimized
myself in real life (and Michael was the victim of an unbelievably 
horrendous gay-bashing in Iowa), and don't want to provide a site for it
on the Net.
17 Flirting and cyber-romancing segueing into sadsex and emptiness, I
keep trying and can't find myself anywhere comfortable in this space. 
Take the blame for everything; I'm not a nice person I decide.
18 Michael Current's death. Elegies, phonecalls incoming and outgoing,
posts, and a presence is missed as he and Buddha approached one another
while he was still alive.
19 He sends his first story and then dies. I repost the story to the
lists he was on.
20 All those posts on eating disorders, incapacitations of all sorts on
the lists; sometimes I think we're circumscribing ourselves, writing
ourselves and our illnesses, troubles, despair, out of existence. Now I
listen to alt.angst where the posters seem to resonate around the same
depression, reinforcing one another all too often. But who am I to say.
21 Well, John Kennedy's hoax death came at the wrong time, but there
wouldn't have been a right time, some of us taking these spaces _very_
seriously.
22 Hacking: My being unsubbed from Cybermind and FOP, MP's posting under
other names, Mary's resentments. Arguments on Spoon about hidden control
characters, MP's posts cancelling archived files. Suddenly the mail
COMES ALIVE, starts doing things to one and all. Paranoia momentarily
sets in. All of us try to track MP down; I find out more about hacking
than I ever thought I would. Had no idea of the damage that could be 
done.
23 My posts on alt.destroy.the.internet, tropical bionet, reposts from
Usenet to lists. I begin to realize how filled with grace we are; these
spaces will soon disappear. The Net is far more fragile an organism
than we would like to admit. But I find alt.jen-cool devoted to _girls_
who are named Jennifer and cool, and alt.fan.amy-fisher, and alt.fan.
tanya-harding.whack.whack.whack, and alt.hackers...
24 Spoon collective debate about depth vs. lateriality on lists. I favor
"close readings" of lists, creating homes, building community and dis-
cussion out of them. Others favor topic-oriented lists, or lists we call
PN- proper name ones, such as Deleuze-Guattari. The architectonics of
each are wildly different.
25 Gun and Order Lords dominating Future Culture at various times -
problems with right-wing proto-fascistic attitudes. The gun-control 
debate. Incoherencies. Doctress Neutopia's posts elsewhere save the day!
A lot of us unsub from Future Culture for a while, return when things
are calmer.
26 I had a hideous flamewar with a server here in the Big Apple. Don't
ever go against the powers that be. You don't have a chance. 'Nuff said.
27 Continuous New School server problems including bounced messages. I
started on the New School; recently, I closed down the account. As my
traffic and responsibilities increased, I couldn't work with the faulty
modem connections. I switched permanently to Panix, although there will
be other connections up and running soon.
28 Five unsubbings in a row without comment from the Derrida list. The
New School account was causing havoc at the time.
29 The Spoon lists going to closed subscription, in order to avoid im-
proper addresses creating troubles.
30 Hacking with an Australian message on the Derrida list.
31 My work available on Marius' WWW site. Thank you Marius! I may die
in real life, but if your site keeps working, someone, someday, in the
far far future, will realize what this whole (Internet) text has been
about.
32 Changes for me in family relations as a result of greater communica-
tion with my brother and sister. At least my writing has made it through
as have their enterprises. In particular, communication on a somewhat
regular basis with my brother-in-law. I close my eyes and imagine a
network of relatives; we all live at a distance from one another.
33 I'm terrified of being called to account for the frequency of my
posts; when I am, I try to deflect the criticism. I imagine everyone
posting in, not my cutting back. I imagine a communality of writers,
readers, and even a form of caring for one another that's almost com-
pletely absent in academic communities. I realize the lists all possess
auras of private postings going back and forth - people meeting on them,
taking their concerns on quieter, personal channels.
34 Why is everyone having wonderful Internet romances that immediately
blossom in real life, even leading to marriages in some cases? What am
I doing wrong? And then there are marriages falling apart as a result
of the Internet, people complaining about addictions, fears surfacing...
For myself, I try to deal with depression and self-hatred, sometimes
to no avail. I find myself angrier at times on the lists than I'd like
to be, and much too aggressive. But I also find I can write a philoso-
phical prose that _makes sense_ in this space, and that's taken 
seriously.
35 Sudden moments of personal confession via private email - of loneli-
ness, sadness, loss. Answering condolence posts and telephone calls
in relation to Michael's death. Absence of photographs of Michael.
Finally, a sad little xeroxed image comes from Malgosia. 
36 Earlier, much earlier, this had happened: I was on Talk (a Unix
application) with Michael; Panix goes down, I dial in again, end up on 
Judy Miller's account, in an Ayn Rand IRC (as Judy Miller!) talking 
about screwdrivers. I quit IRC, go to Miller's Talk, log in with 
Michael - who had fingered me, found out I didn't exist.
37 Back and forth with Marius Watz on one 486/66, Mosaic with his pic-
ture on the other. High with techno-energy at the New School computing
center, typing two keyboards simultaneously. Innocence.
38 Meeting Patrick Bjork, Judith Rodenbeck, Erik Davis, Chris Keep, and
other amazing people in real time. Unlike the lesson of the first cyber-
flirt above, not the slightest disappointment. But disappointment in
world.std.com (standard tool and die) which is about to start charging
for email lists. Panic all around.
39 Found myself addicted to the writing of the Internet Text, working
on it daily for hours, thinking about virtual subjectivity, this form
of discourse/intercourse. Constantly assembling and reassembling it,
trying to keep to a schedule of one text per day, just for the writing
of it. The more I investigate the area, the more it opens up and down.
I find myself disappointed in almost anything I read about cyberspace,
and almost no exceptions.
40 I begin teaching courses on the Net, cyberspace, the so-called
information "super"highway, at several places, publishing on these
themes as well, now assembling an anthology of writing. I feel half
real and half non-existent; were it not for the Net, I would disappear
altogether. Although I am known as a video artist, my art has increas-
ingly turned inward; the video now records the surface of the screen,
returning it to the visible. (I increase my contacts, teaching on-line,
working with ArtNet co-moderating a theory/criticism forum, preparing
for a possible magazine interview. And I get away from using my body on
one or another tape, although I miss the pleasure of it.)
41 Trying to find Allison, in Australia, with no luck whatsoever. Think-
ing that the Net reaches into every corner of the visible and invisible
world, but there are gaps, and people fall through. (Allison and I were
married. I met her in Tasmania. She came back with me. There's a room
at the Limelight club in New York that was named after her, the Allison
Wonderland room.)
42 Thinking that I have fallen through the cracks into the Net. 
43 Writing until I literally begin shaking. Writing until my body forces
me to stop. Writing until I no longer write, until I am a ghost, having
written himself into your presence of the name, and if you've read this
far.

Designations


At three in the morning I heard the men arguing outside the window,
three stories below. It was a cool night in late October. I looked
out and down, towards the busstop under the yellow light. The sky 
was dark. I saw two strong men arguing about space. One of them held
up a set of keys, yelling that they were his own and not hers. The
other said they belonged to the landlord, neither hers nor his. The
men yelled for a while. They were beautiful. The first man went
towards the middle of the street, circling the other. He went back
and forth circling the other. He moved his arms and he was like
Marlon Brando or Paul Robeson. His body moved in every part and 
every part danced deliberately although not slowly and not smoothly.
The other man leaned against the busstop sign. He moved quietly and
hesitantly, intensely following the first with his body, his whole
body. The men moved with their body. The arguments grew louder and
I returned to the window. They began fighting and I thought to my-
self, two men fighting. I had heard about men fighting and these men
fought on the side and in the center of the street, then not at all.
They fought again, removing their brown jackets and some cards fell
from one of the jackets and on to the street. They continued to fight
and there seemed to be love and grace in the fighting and nothing came
down the street to interfere. Near the corner two police cars pulled up
and the fight stopped, the men stood. The men stood near the cops who
were of all colors. The men said they were uncle and nephew and they
had been drinking four beers. The men said that the other man started
it. The older man was the nephew of the younger and the younger man
said that the older man should respect his uncle. The cops helped the
men get their jackets and their cards and the things scattered on the
street. The nephew walked away down the street away from the police
cars and towards his home and the other man waited for the bus after
the police had left and then left with the bus and the street was 
empty. I was amazed by the grace of these men, all of them, moving
and circling in the street, and how like a play life is when it is
three in the morning and isolated. And I thought to myself, this is
what life is about and these are men who have taught me that. These
were men who were surrounding each other and fighting and then stand-
ing and no one was hurt. These were men fighting about room to fight
in and there was never any room in Brooklyn. There never is any room
in Brooklyn, but there is room for these bodies and their intensities
and their movements and right above them the wires carried this post
out into unknown corners of cyber-cyberspace.

Wild Economics


You want your kids see some fucking pervert on the screen??!!

Take the Net you bastards and cut it in two you cocks and tear the 
spoils! Your teeth carry the shreds of fiber optics! You've got human
flesh in your maw! The last best hope of humankind! The last vestiges
of happiness on the earth!

Okay, there's different ways to price the Net. You can charge by flat
rate, you can charge by volume, you can charge by total volume. If you
charge by flat rate, then the user knows where you are. You can fuck 
all night, you can just kiss and run, it's all the same. If you charge
by volume, then the user's fucked, has got to watch it. You cut through
the shit with one-liners, stop dead in your tracks. Every so often a 
truck rolls by, it's Ross Perot or someone who's bought up half the net
delivering himself like a call-boy with half a head lost to speed;
meanwhile, you're waiting by the side-lines, your love is dying in the
tracks, you're no longer wet between the legs, and the damn delivery
just keeps on coming. If you charge by the total volume, forget it; you
can't say anything except a whisper to your next-door neighbor; the 
community's collapsed dead upon you, everyone's screwed, you're just 
lying there wetting your pissy-pants. The big boys are now gas-boys,
inflationary spirals - you can read what they have to say, you can't
reply - they stuff their cocks down your throat.

It's all in the name of liberalism, it's all about freedom to charge
what the market will bear, arbeit macht frei in fact! Don't worry, you
can still speak beneath your breath, within your breath - whispers 
don't cost anything and you can still think what you like! Just ask
Solzhenitsyn!

Friends, these rates are coming down the highway where everyone smells
cash, where pedophiles fuck babies they don't even stop at kids, women
indiscriminately fuck any man in sight men fuck each other can you 
imagine that horror of horrors women fucking women! Friends, I cannot
tell you who is coming to break up your lovely family as the trucks
rumble through the landscape, and it is only the trucks, friends, that
bring Salvation! For each big boy has got the answer, has got the Truth,
how else would he get where he is? If you're poor, keep your mouth shut!
God made you that way! If you're rich, you've worked for God, fuck the
Virgin Mary, she had nothing to do with it! Don't forget when Christ
delivered, when Christ delivered the Sermon on the Mount, he was on Top!
Hell, he had to say something! And what he began, we're still completing!

Friends, the Net's there for the taking, like a huge tit with milk spit-
ting and spoiling all around! If you whip it out, you can take it in!
You can make enough to have all the sex you want, all the men and women
you want! You can have a new car! You can put away that laptop, walk out
from under the desk, where all you've been fucking is your SLIP connect!
All you got to do is get on board! And the way I see it is, megabucks is
megabytes, there's no two ways about it! All the sex you want!

Take the Net you bastards and cut it in two you cocks and tear the 
spoils! Your teeth carry the shreds of fiber optics! You've got human
flesh in your maw! The last best hope of humankind! The last vestiges
of happiness on the earth!

The Pennsylvanian Era and the Breakdown of the Hypothesis


There were no landscapes during the Carboniferous. Sigillaria or
neuropteris, the absence of a blank eye, the unremarking of an
occasion. Nothing heard that would mark that occasion. Calamites
for example left by the granularity of a sanded shallow, perhaps
more than usual. Unremarkable. This is what Rosset must have meant
later when he discussed the idiocy of the real in the absence of
this example. It is this, the uncanny breaking of a stem, tramp-
ling of a fern prothallus, that unravels _everything._ We exist
upon the branch of that unravelling. The remnants of scarring:
lepidodendron, there were others, each an enunciation. Nothing
had a name, one couldn't talk about the seasons. The virtual
subject covers the subject like a molecular membrane, split open.
She doesn't notice. She doesn't notice until the split spells
disconnect. This is what covers the structure of scarred tissue
you may have remembered from what was less than a nanosecond.
The mind is a contradiction splayed against time, its cunt opened
to an abyss. Rather it is a knot in the contradiction. Or rather 
again, a marking or remarking rendered a stem or trampling of a 
fern prothallus. It is this that breaks down the _hypothesis._

The Ghost


The ghost comes down to haunt the woods by means of a lantern. The 
ghost is always blue against a darker blue or black and the lantern
is a paper lantern held together with thin strips of wood and yellow
casting a darker yellow or black light, these things intermixed in a
manner of which I cannot speak. It's as if the ghost wore itself out
defining its edges, as if the edges caught on brambles and other
plants, stumbling around in the dark. It's as if the ghost puffed 
itself up with pride and desire in the middle of the air, barely
visible, caught literally by the edge of the eye struggling to attain
the self and its perfection during the nights of warmth and fireflies.
Stars which are unaccustomed to speak their place murmur among them-
selves when the ghost appears. 

And when the ghost appears, the brook flows more quietly, this flow
of eternity, of slim silver shapes lost among the pebbles of Hokusai.
For the ghost haunts the bridges in this region, their old wooden
railings a delight for floating in and out amidst the timbers, catch-
ing the solitary monk hurrying his way along in the darkness. The monk
knows the ghost and all the names of the ghosts, but the monk cannot
tell one ghost from another. They are all wraiths, surrounded by a 
yearning, not for life, but for some small semblance of solidity in 
the realm of the lanterns and fireflies. So the monk knows and speaks
as well to all the ghosts, and knows and speaks to none of them, this
monk in his dark robe with his thick belt, carrying a tiny bell.

Stone Field, Travis, The Return


Travis kept returning to the site, over and over again. Something was
driving him. At times, he lay awake until dawn, images smothered in
migraine sparks splintered across the perceptual field. At thirty-one
he felt the body shutting down. He would return to the site sometimes
in the middle of the day and return to it at night, stone mirroring
stone, the built world and the imaginary coalescing, each contributing
to the other in some crazy-horse dimension.

There was no end to the furrows, those tracings that ran from block to
block across the stone field, something encrusted in the bottom of the
v-shaped troughs. The tracings formed a discernible order, locally, a
form, Travis supposed, of Penrose tilings which never repeated in the
large. He called this the 'circumstance' of the stone field, let me
describe the stone field, grey rectangular blocks laid side by side, 
end to end, as far as the eye could see. The tracings were grooves worn
into their surface, a singular and rough surface, the tracings identi-
cal with the stone, identical with the grey of the stone. The thinned
joints of the stone were overlaid by the grooves, a double matrix or
coding, a thickening or intensification of the site. Travis walked the
site. He thought v or V. He thought V or v.  

Travis would leave the ship and he wouldn't need a helmet cause the 
air was just like the air he breathed here on earth and he would first
set the ship down with the rockets in reverse and then would get out.
This was just one of Travis' adventures but the one he returned to all
the time because he didn't know where the world began or ended and that
included his dreams as well. He thought of himself as his dreams cause
he made sure that he had seen things no one else had ever seen, even if
they were things that he had seen only in his dreams. But the stone 
field was not one of them, it was always there, not even waiting. He
would fly around and set the rocketship down and then walk out the door
which had stairs that went down to the stones. Then he would walk about
on the stones and then return to the ship.

Travis felt that the patterns gave it away, and he thought of things
like quasi-crystals or alphabets in crazy-horse dimensions. He thought
it was a secret gate for a real voyage of discovery. He would leave the
field and then return and each time try to make the voyage. Sometimes 
he wondered whether his friends were still there and whether he had a
lover or children or something. He thought that there were other things
in the world besides the rocketship which had a bed where he could 
sleep but he didn't remember much else that he had and thought that he
should find out sometime. But there it was, the field that was below
him as he kept moving the rocketship about from place to place, but not
really - it was just like the splintered patterns of his migraine, 
always in front of him. And sometimes he would think that the ship made
tracings as it rose and descended and as he walked about. He thought
that they might spell something in the crazy-horse dimensions, but the
thought was too difficult to really consider. If he had flashlights he
could wear them and then set a camera on the stones and as he went up
and down and returned he would find a pattern if the camera were always
open and it was nighttime. It would be a long time exposure of this
moving about, but most of the time it was day, and his radio ran out
of power a long time ago.

When I was fifteen, the stones reached out and grabbed Travis. They 
just grabbed him and pulled him in. They parted just perfectly the size
of his body and he disappeared.

Travis had electric powers.
