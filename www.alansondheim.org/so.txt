Qin Again

These were more difficult to me and on occasion 
I'm missing the note or harmonic, but not to any
great extent, I think whenever I hear what I record,
the faults resonate more than the rest, which 
almost disappears into the background, the faults
appear like stumbling blocks, but also signify the
body itself, for example, here I was out of tune, 
the fingers slipping or the position forgotten, or,
here, the harmonic touch was slightly off, the
higher ones are so unforgiving, and this is again
my fingers off or sliding on the side of the 
string which is suspended taut above the board, so
it comes down to hands, memory, confusion, mislaid
left or right hand positions, something amiss, not
to be taken lightly but hopefully for others who
have just come to the pieces, the background will
become foreground, the errors slurred over, the
music emerging, and so much more difficult on 
these instruments without the easy convenience of
frets that place the fingers just so for you, on 
the other hand or fingers, allowing for little
deviation, the qin, guqin, ch'in, is more than
that, encompassing the world between the upper 
and lower surfaces, the pillar of earth and the
pillar of heaven holding both in harmony, and on
mine, the hui position markers slightly out of 
skew, perhaps I am living the year of fourteen
months, perhaps my qin has come from another time
or another qin altogether, perhaps someone else
is playing when I had murmured, mine.

down qin

http://www.alansondheim.org/qintune7.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/qintune8.mp3

playing down, towards the left, thinking about
Twin Peaks and the music, qintune8 from that,
the other from the depths

and qintune8 is perhaps of beauty and the 
sublime, coalescing, inhabiting mindfulness,
listen past the silence, and qintune7, everything
lowered, lowering, lowered

sometimes i surpass myself, something else playing


Please help me with Wikipedia!!

There's a stub article on me in Wikipedia. I've asked a couple 
of friends to expand it, but no luck. The problem is that we're 
all unemployed here and it would help to have something more 
substantial. I'm throwing this open at this point; perhaps one 
or more of the people reading this would make some changes? It 
would be greatly appreciated; I'm tired of working under the 
radar so to speak, and need employment (which is admittedly 
another story). I could change the entry myself, but that's not 
only frowned upon; it also reflects a vanity press approach to 
the world and I'd rather not go there for ethical reasons.
Anyway if you have the time, please do make changes, enter 
something, turn the stub into an article, and I'd be literally 
eternally grateful, at least until I die (which precludes 
eternity, so I'm thinking along the lines of a sliding scale).
Thanks, Alan

I could have saved you, Paul Celan. I can't imagine your pain.
Was it pain? What happened, when I read you I wonder if you
could speak at all. I sound stupid here. But I have plumbed
depths and I hate writing you like this when you won't read 
it and our ages would be radically unequal. I'm used to that,
radically unequal ages, but not much else. The world is hell.
No one will know what has been wrought on this planet. I know
everything awaits slaughter. I know slaughter is painful and
nothing has asked for this wager. Everything waits for the 
curtain to fall, often at the bidding of something else. We
have no control over this. So you would have to accept this.
It is evening here and it is not evening where you are. If 
you leave the earth it is not evening either. You must know
what it is like, this lack of evening, this night into which
the cosmos descends. Or does it. It does for you and me but
there are others waiting for eternity. They will not have to
wait that long. There are technologies at work for those who
have the means to escape slaughter. They never live where you
live or where I live. But you did not escape and my mind does
not let me escape. At night my mind condemns me. I wrote so
mundane a style. You understand me. I mean you would if you

1907 Radio Station in Operation !!

http://www.alansondheim.org/radio046.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/massie.mp4

East Greenwich, RI, has The New England Wireless and Steam
Museum, home to the earliest operable radio station in 
existence. The antenna has a dummy load so the spark 
transmitter doesn't interfere with contemporary broadcast
(highly illegal); for the most part, the signal goes 
nowhere. This is a short video of it in operation; the
operator is Robert W. Merriam, who is responsible for a 
good part of the collection (housed in five buildings 
outside of town). The station is Massie Station "PJ" 
from Point Judith, RI. PJ is in its original building, 
which was moved to the museum site. It's remarkable to
see and hear spark-gap transmission. The museum is
maintained by a group of volunteers and the collection 
of extremely early radio artifacts is the best I've 
ever seen. The Corliss steam engine (developed in RI)
is amazing as well, but I'm personally more interested
in extremely early radio; I have a loose coupler,
variometer, and other equipment from 1910-1925; I used
the equipment at an installation at Eyebeam in 2011.
If have have a chance, visit the museum!

reach. arise.

"Philosophy does not let things alone. It is constantly raising
questions about them. It is not willing even to let itself 
alone."

"Philosophy is the unremitting restlessness of thought. It 
penetrates every sphere, searching for ultimate comprehension."

- Albert Hofstadter

in an abandoned MacGrid arena, I arise to 11.6 km.
nothing changes, clouds flee, falling is a surety.
I reach out in an occurrence.
the world occurs, rising and reaching out.

. . .

it is in a continuous process of reaching. it is in
a continuous process of rising. rising continues to 
rise and the world rises and arises. one endures and
endures dreaming. one occurs.

MIGRAINE <<<<\\\|^|///>>>>

Playing sarangi during a full-blown optical/faintness
migraine attack. For me the piece is remarkable; 
towards the end I was able to match the visual flicker-
rate with the sarangi, and the patterns were modified
into a dark pulsating square which moved to the upper-
left of the visual field. I felt fainter and fainter.
The music becomes more rhythmic and persistent in time
with the visual pulsations. The colors also shifted to
ones I had never seen with migraine before. I'm 
fascinated by the results.

Earlier, experimenting with a madal Nepalese drum,
working through patterns and textures. Slow at times
and clumsy but thoughtful? (The drumming did not
contribute to the migraine, which I still have,
somewhat ferociously.
