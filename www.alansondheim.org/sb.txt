I'm sure they're genetic. They're the rhythms of DNA.
They're the coherence of microbial communalities.
They're the anguish and excitement of the shtetl. 
Yes they are! They're Shestov and Benjamin and

They're Arendt in her first and last encounters.

Begin from Last Principles

End from First Principles.

Begin with music: what I am capable of doing, i.e.
the fingerboard or instrument as a sonic _field._
It's possible to be safe here: within the field.
It's possible to be alive: i.e. the recording of 
the fact that _I am still alive._ That I am weaving
what no one else can, that this is _my song,_ and 
for me alone to pass on, i.e. the recording. That 
the same is true for a text that _is not a response
to an other_ but proceeds from within, a territory
that internally coheres. It is _here_ that I am
comfortable. That the order of letters is mine and
mine alone, _during the production of the order._
What occurs later is of less consequence. 

Still, there is the desire for acknowledgment:
_This_ is the music you have created? How wonderful!
This text - it changed my life! Vistas opened! And
within, I think it should always be this way. And
without, it never is: without, it is alien, vacuum,
unresponsive. Therefore I continue, turn inward
farther, if that were possible, create and recreate
my little worlds, present them - and the cycle
continues, endlessly without grace.

The Last Principles are those surrounding despair
and death, the curtain, the barrier, rendering 
everything else useless, blank, emptied
demarcation. They can be anything you want, I want;
they make no difference, except for a ritual I 
might call the Scattering of Marks. It's nothing
more than a momentary thing; in the scheme _of
things,_ it is not a thing nor a scheme. The Last
Principles might be the glance once sees as one
is dying, the glance between two of the living, 
before one, or slightly to the side, so that the
seeing is, eternally, incomplete. But in the 
scheme of things, this is as before; the Last
Principles might as well be the first or the
middle; logic has no place - no foundation - in
its incompleteness. I would call you unto me, but
can no longer speak; I would speak, but can no
longer murmur; I would whisper, but the barrier is
that which refuses, itself, burial, but comes for
one and all, an enclave or particulation better
left for better poets than myself.

So I will do music and I will hear music, and 
within it are incredible structures, novelty,
something new sounding for the first and last 
time as well. And this is surrounding by the
beginning and ending of the recording, by the
placing and tuning of the instrument with me, and
its release and releasement within the sonic,
within the realm of being-in-process, the file
only something, thing or scheme, to be raked,
articulated according to the proper signatures 
of time and codecs, and as proper, as possible,
however considered, the feedback of the sound for
this moment, into another place and another time,
such as might be heard, the slight exfoliation of
a world when I have gone from it, leaving this
trace, this holograph or signature, this check-
mate and chiasmus where appearance conceivably
rises, only to fall, collapse again, and the 
cycle continues, endlessly without grace.

Of First Principles, nothing can be said, after
the fact or scheme, the emptying of the word,
the sign.



First explorations of MacGrid: The Albatross

http://www.alansondheim.org/macgrid1.mp4

The MacGrid is a massive server farm, I entered
into alien territory, albatross have colonized
there already, towards the eastern end of the 
small experimental space _which they will not
relinquish,_ placing instead mournful cries of
ontological containment at the very edge of the
seawall-landwall; it is here that I found them
and traveled among them, in such limited space
that it were not possible I would return home-
ward, or that the comforts of home were even 
among the possible. I am grateful to these birds, 
far higher in consciousness than I might attain 
even with limited flight; it is from them that I 
have learned the realm of the air and its fractal
bordering the sea, and such sad and whispered 
cries that would never have been foreheard, not
among men and women, nor among any others of 
those animals within the realm of sentient 
beings. I learned there that all were presenced,
and truthful, and comfort, and that among all, I 
was among them. For it is said that the darkly
cry of the albatross is the echo of the world
unto itself, the world of land which can never
find land or home, the world of water which can
never wing through highways always shifting 
among them, and among us, no highways at all.

What's better than one viola? Two violas! No jokes,
honestly, the melding of the instruments is amazing.
James plays sparsely with every note conjuring up
scale and unmarked territory; I tend to fill in my
breathing with more breath, to the choking limit.
Azure sings beautifully; we worked with one of the
older songs. I love these pieces; he extends the
saz scales with viola, crawls all around the Cminor
harmonic harmonica, roams while the voice sings 
song. Against the saz, the viola has no equal -
clearly it's one of the most beautiful instruments
around. Enjoy, if you have the time.




Communication with the Other


http://www.alansondheim.org/xeno.mp4

The signals received and sent, only what seems
to be a life-form - in a random? pattern? No
recognizable pattern but preferred places -
prime grid? Not that, nothing.

Technically, my avatar has no body in MacGrid.
Distorted motion capture files manipulate 
attached invisible objects; the avatar has no
gestures, but the objects emit light. It's the
light that's moving. It's the light that's the
source of communication. It's the light that
expects light in return.

The light sings

"X-ing x-chromosomes, x-rated xenoias never collapses - but 
turned local, regional - a xenoic capital like never collapses - 
but turned local, regional - a xenoic capital like never

- and the light awaits an answer.




everything softly falling


This is the communication in regard to the first video of the 
alien; the link here is to 

http://www.alansondheim.org/testingalien.mp4 

and it constitutes of a series of tests of the alien structure 
within the MacGrid in an attempt to determine its fundamental 
properties, and whether or not the object/process can be 
considered a life-form and further, whether the life-form may be 
considered sentient. While the jury is still out, parametric 
data can be gathered by the application of suitable rendering 
tests, as shown.

Of course this is all within and without the realm of the 
virtual, of signs and nothing but signs. Still, there is a need 
for probes - think of them as logic probes, necessarily digital. 
This is the granularity of the virtual world, at least _this_ 
virtual world, and from this, one encounters an analog 
phenomenology and hermeneutics paralleling that of Schutz's 
writing on Carneades and relevance theory. For what is happening 
here, beyond the probes, are the mixed returns of signals, and 
from the signals, interpretations of all sorts fly; further 
testing is needed. It's also of interest that the avatar-form is 
blind to all of this; the grid is a superimposition which 
circulates around it, literally, the grid has no _bearing._

Tro so solo *

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1159 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/trosor.mp3

The bridge has been moved, an erhu lower string
replacing the tro one, the tuning has been 
raised a whole tone, and the skin protection
band (which I put on myself) has been adjusted.
This has allowed me to succumb to the instrument.
After a long search by the way, I found no other
tros available online, and very little material
relating to playing technique, rosin, strings, 
and the like. This is strange, since the erhu,
the original Chinese version of the tro so, has
numerous online resources. I quite like the new
configuration and solo. Enjoy.

Erhu

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1162 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/erhu1.mp3

the bow is a much lighter and a bit more difficult
than that of the tro; the sound is less nasal but
also slower. so far I prefer the tro, but this is
what I can do on the erhu, much with double-stopping
which is interesting and the pizzicato is resonant.
it sounds like a 'finer' instrument but doesn't have
the cut. one lesson learned - it takes at least 
forty minutes to prepare a new erhu bow with rosin;
there are no shortcuts. and I do like the fact the
instrument talks to me and talks back. enjoy.

somebody hopefully sees the value of so much music,
most of it solo or small group, on the ESP site. 
it's a form of pilgrimage continuing for many years.
I don't think there's anything like it elsewhere on
the web. that doesn't make it beautiful, but it 
gives it at least an ethnographic interest. and yes,
I think much of it is really worth listening to.

Warning. I'm here to warn you. We're here to warn you.

I'm here to warn you. We're lights and sirens, we're signals. 
We're the warning signs, the early-warning signs. We've seen 
enough. You ignore us at your peril. We warn you here in this 
world and in the next, in the real world and in the virtual. Our 
signals travel slower than the speed of light or travel at the 
speed of light; it doesn't matter, we're earlier, we've arrived 
first, we're here to warn you, to tell you, implore you, we're 
here to bear witness. The first warning: This is not a repetition. 
The second warning: This is not an extrapolation from an origin. 
The third warning: This is novelty. The fourth: This has never 
been witnessed before. We bear witness to the lack of witness, to 
the invisible witness, to the dead witness, to the wounded 
witness. We bear witness to the disappearing witness, to the 
witness who would see and demarcate every juncture, who would 
arise with the power of the signal, the density and momentum of 
the word. The sixth warning: That the density is not noise, that 
noise is the warning, that noise is the horizon, that the noise is 
_this_ noise is dense. The noise is dense: This is the seventh 
warning. That it is dense and _it is not noise._ That is to say, 
that is to warn, that is to declare, it is something somewhere 
else, it is a moment when history transforms noise into signal, 
signal into noise. So this is the next warning: That the signal is 
noise, that the signal is useless, subterfuge, that the signal is 
circumlocution with a hollow center, without a center at all, 
without the surrounding walls of data-accumulation, with piles of 
dirt-data, with unruly piles. That the noise is the signal, that 
it is within the midst of the noise, Heidegger's little hut in the 
mountains, in the midst of the noise, constructed from noise, 
developed and engineered from noise. That the hut is noise 
transformed into noise, that there are none others, that there are 
every others, that is to say, that there are virtuals. That is the 
warning, that the noise are virtuals, that the virtuals are noise, 
everything replete, nothing beyond or within the mountains or 
chasms or dry deserts on any one of a billion exoplanets. That the 
warning is noise and not signal, that the warning is throttle and 
not code, that the warning is a rough patch, that the rough patch 
is real and that the real are virtuals, that the rough patch are 
virtuals, the warning somewhere in there, that there are noise, 
that there is density, somewhere in the warning there is density, 
somewhere in the density a warning, of something or someone or 
other, of some time, something that's there, a rough patch ...




When I need.

I sleep when I need to sleep. I wake when I need to wake. Some- 
times I sleep when I need to be awake and I struggle. Sometimes I 
need to be asleep and wake perhaps in the middle of the night and 
there are the disturbed remnants of a dream. I feel my body 
clotted and abject and I can say it almost always is this way; I 
loathe my body and write of its death immediately beneath me, even 
before it or I touch the ground. It's this that stops me from 
being a man; I am arrogant and angry and despairing, but I am not 
a man; I flee even from the position of the coward. I am cowed. In 
the face of other men I cannot urinate or breathe; in their face I 
remain awake until sleep brings its nightmares to bare down on me. 
I consider all of this existence, and ordinary existence, mediocre 
existence. I have nothing to gain and always everything to lose, 
even in the state of exhaustion or penury or just having finished 
an improvisation. I attempt to improvise a life out of debris and 
scar and sometimes I succeed on a momentary basis. I look around 
and create an epistemology and it is the epistemology that lies 
just beneath the surface, an abject epistemology within which we 
bleed to death. At the moment of dying, if we are old, we are 
transformed, and someone said we are no long human, we are things 
sliding into the abyss. I am on the lip of the abyss and I write 
of the lip. The writing makes me uncomfortable but I am the one 
and many doing the writing and you are the one doing the reading 
but it is my writing you are reading as control slips from me. 
Control goes nowhere; it slips like my skin slips from my 
shoulders and the rest of me slips away; I an always pooled on a 
ground or foundation not of my own making. It is there now in my 
sleep. It is this that makes men turn from me, an abjection easily 
mistaken for the tawdry or sleazy, but in actuality that which 
grips all of us in our moments of fear when we piss ourselves or 
collapse somnolent to the ground. It is this that makes women turn 
from me, or those of any other sex or sexuality, or those of any 
other species or kingdom or queendom, or those of the earth or 
sky, or anything needing or avoiding breathing. I am seen as 
untoward, creepy, something or someone, if I am lucky, smelling 
not quite right, putting forth an odor or stench which accompanies 
me everywhere. I am kept out of institutions which rake their 
borders clean. I am kept away from collegialities which are 
dependent on the cleanliness of capital abstractions replacing the 
shit of corporeal monies and standards. The toilets I should say 
are also cleansed. The stalls and urinals are cleansed. The 
stirrups are cleansed. The needles are cleansed. Everywhere there 
are flows of brilliant fluids monitored for impurities; I am 
removed from the flows. Everywhere I am removed from what might 
have been, from the possible, replaced by semblances of security 
or comfortably controlled leaks. To leak a secret is seemly; to 
leak in ones pants is unseemly. The first leases life, the second 
releases death. You will know me by my red stains, my menses I 
have not hidden, my lymphatic nodes, the phlegm that steels from 
my eyes, the hardness of tears, the tearing of tissues as death 
and only death penetrates me. I am the gate of death, of spent 
semen and sweat, of useless language. You shift from foot to foot 
and pry open shame in every direction. Of my tribe the four 
directions, the six directions, the eight directions of shame. You 
consign me to the rubbish bin: who would write such a thing? Who 
would read such a thing? Who would be such a thing? But I am such 
a thing, and I am a thing, and a thing among things, as are you, 
and the rest of you. Only the vulnerabilities here are within my 
skin and you see them and stretch them until I disappear. Until my 
work disappears. Until the ungainly sanctions I have tattooed upon 
my eyelids are no longer visible, not even to me. In other words, 
until I am stitched and sewn into a tattered ungodly thing. Then 
I will hear nothing you say. I will see nothing you are. I will 
smell nothing. I will touch nothing either.



So/aring

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/erhuandtro.mp3

Roughly fifty-three Cambodias constitute the area of China. The 
Chinese erhu is a somewhat complicated instrument complete with 
advertised fine-tuners, mutes, a variety of bows and strings, 
varying woods. The Cambodian tro so or tro sor is almost invisible 
on the Net; I haven't found any for sale, much less specialized 
strings. But the tro so has instantaneous response, as if 
emanating a clear light, and my fingers dance on the strings. The 
tro so bow is heavier and thicker than the erhu bow, and I delight 
in the weight and exactitude of the wood. The tro body is 
cylindrical, and the wood rests anywhere along the rim; on the 
erhu, the body is hexagonal (sometimes cylindrical, sometimes 
octagonal), and the light bow tends to flip over the 'corners.' I 
know this is a fault of mine, slowing me up, creating a rougher 
movement, although the erhu can be as sweet as you like. The tro 
so, on the other hand, has a broader tone, but one susceptible of 
amazing variation, and the tone doesn't imitate the violin; it 
holds its own. It's beautiful and I can soar on it. I'm awaiting 
the day I can do the same on the erhu, but perhaps a certain 
imperial history obscures my relationship, just as Khmer history 
transforms the tro so for me. It's confusing; I bring to both the 
collapse of an American Empire that's still busy poisoning the 
world, but no place is safe from itself and its originary 
violence. I keep all of this in mind as I move from one instrument 
to the other; the truth is, that the tro so is easier and lighter 
for me, and makes me happier - while the erhu remains a dark and 
complex challenge. The two seem so similar, and yet for me are as 
different as organ from piano, and I work on both with widely 
varying techniques and degrees of proficiency. Here are the erhu 
and tro so again, and here I am, again, lost in the music (as) we 
speak to one other.

From Heidegger's Nietzsche, "Rapture as Aesthetic State": "We are 
not first of all 'alive,' only then getting an apparatus to 
sustain our living which we call 'the body,' but we are some body 
who is alive. Our being embodied is essentially other tan merely 
being encumbered with an organism." "Rapture is a feeling, and it 
is all the more genuinely a feeling the ore essentially a unity 
of embodying attunement prevails." "At the outset Nietzsche 
emphasizes two things  about rapture: first, the feeling of 
enhancement of force; second, the feeling of plenitude."

Yes, and force and plenitude constitute a lifting out of an 
instrument or a "merely," a billowing when the fingers move of 
their own accord, when history is lost and absolved in the 
fecundity of sound. This is where we are, when we are there, not 
among either language or a mis-interpreted Wittgensteinian silence 
- but among Rilke's angelic orders. Something doesn't "have to be 
said" about this under any circumstances, nor does the music 
"speak for itself"; the music does not _speak_ and is hardly 
programmatic or the ordered sequence of a song-form. An other 
immersion is occurring and it's this that I'm interested in, with 
both erhu and tro so, with one country roughly fifty-three times 
the area of the other, One and an Other, neither with capitals, 
neither capitalized, capitulated.

recording with fan and air conditioner, then filtering
out the hiss with high reduction, adding echo, etc. and
the result is the hidden currents of heat while it's 95
degrees F out in this area we're in and inside maybe 
about 80 so we're lucky we're in tune at all, aren't we.
but in any case, what's exciting here, if you've been
listening - this is the tro sor again - is that the 
sounds utterly transformed into ethereal voices, as if
the notes were soaring on thermals, which, in a manner 
of speaking, they were; i'm always fascinated when i 
hear something new for the first time and wonder where
these sounds have been all my life - 



Alien Entities in the MacGrid networked sim

http://www.alansondheim.org/ghostfield.mp4

Backstory: Entering the experimental MacGrid sim and discovering 
that my avatar was being shadowed by ghost avatars; at first they 
were peripheral specks; eventually I recognized the anomaly. I 
explored for a bit. Ian Murray entered the scene and part of the 
dialog, including data dumps, is below. The phenomenon continues 
and as I walk thru the city I'm constantly glancing behind me, or 
in the sky above and to the left; I'm sure I'm being followed. The 
real is changing and resistance is futile.

[21:13]  Ian Murray: I actually laughed out loud seeing you coming 
between the buildings
[21:14]  Alan Sondheim: what's weird is (I seem to have a shadow 
image following me in the sky - been trying to figure that out - 
very strange, made some videos
[21:16]  Ian Murray: Do you mean the particle that move ahead of 
you?
[21:16]  Alan Sondheim: it's more like an image of the whole mess 
- seems to move at high speed -
[21:17]  Ian Murray: Your Avatar is often on 2 regions
[21:17]  Ian Murray: but in small particles - each slightly 
different
[21:17]  Alan Sondheim: it's strange - I'll put the videos up 
later.
[21:18]  Ian Murray: I assumed it was purposeful. It was there 
when Dennian and I were testing out your account
[21:18]  Alan Sondheim: wow - it seems really alien. kind of like 
it -

Research into the alien prims, MacGrid

http://www.alansondheim.org/research.mp4

I went back into the MacGrid and was able to locate and stabilize 
the alien prim complex that accompanied the configuration I had 
created in the MacGrid. The complex contained a mesh - please note 
- which was _not_ duplicated, and the duplicated prims were, 
themselves, only partially formed, embryonic. After I stabilized 
the complex, I increased its glow to 50% - in other words, giving 
it characteristics that the original objects did not possess. I 
tried at the same time to reposition, rebake, stretch, etc. the 
complex, but this proved impossible. The last two segments 
demonstrate that inherent glow of the alien complex now rivaled 
that of the setting sun, and in darkness, that the complex now 
behaved as a moon or satellite to the main objects which I had 
created. Note that the alien complex is only partially under my 
control, that it follows the kernel only of the objects I created, 
and that it appears to be in a constant state of examining them. 
Please note as well that this research was _carried out on the 
level of prim manipulation,_ not on the level of the underlying 
codework. What fascinates me is the ability to carry out 
examinations of this sort, which produce their own extrinsic 
surface phenomenologies, in the place of a codework whose 
relationship to the surface is tight, but whose effects are based 
on epistemological transformations.

Violin Tier Performance

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1172 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/tier.mp3

Based on the tro and erhu playing, each string of the violin
is used as the basis for roughly similar improvisations
related to a particular melody sequence. The strings are
played alone in the order 3/2/1/4, around GcgC, something
like that. I started this project as soon as I awoke; the
first quarter is out of tune and awkward, the other three 
are increasingly better. On the tro and erhu, it's quite
possible to improvise on a single string, and that formed 
the basis for the Tier. Eventually I shall perform live, 
moving from string to string, never returning, never moving
across strings or visiting older neighborhoods. In the 
meantime this is a taste of what's possible and as usual
and of course I quite like it. In that I'm probably alone.



cinders


- As for me, I had at first imagined that cinders where there, not 
here but there, as a story to be told: cinder, this old gray word, 
this dusty theme of humanity, the immemorial image had decomposed 
from within, a metaphor or metonymy of itself, such is the destiny 
of every cinder, separated, consumed like a cinder of cinders. Who 
would still dare run the risk of a poem of the cinder?

(Derrida, trans. Ned Lukacher)

I cannot make out, to my satisfaction, the iconography of the 
frontispiece to the 1929 Vilna Haggadah which I have discussed 
elsewhere, to the extent of appealing to some within the Rabinnic 
community. Fear circulates among those present at the Seder, order 
is disrupted. The margins of the book appear burnt, the margins of 
the image roughly drawn out. To have found this in the sterility 
of Salt Lake City, the Haggadah which has continued to haunt me: 
in my reading it's a transformation of my work, the virtual world 
circulations of deities re/constructed as hysterical symptoms
