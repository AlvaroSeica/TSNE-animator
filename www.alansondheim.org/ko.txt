

                             Neurobionics

      An Interdisciplinary Approach to Substitute Impaired Functions
                      of the Human Nervous System

- the title of a 1993 book edited by H.-W. Bothe, M. Samii, and R. Eckmil-
ler, carving out a space among neural network theory, epistemology, and
neurosurgery. There's an implantable microstimulator module, only 2mm wide
by 14mm long, illustrated on p. 260. It can be injected by hypodermic. "Up
to 256 such modules can be individually controlled by a single transmit-
ter." (Gerald Loeb, Neural Prosthetic Interfaces Between Neural and Elec-
tronic Computing.) Let's think of injected skeins across the skin surface
or meshes between the brain and skull; let's think of creviced residences
across the surface of the brain; let's think of rings and wave formations
within the neighborhood of the genitals. Each module contains a "capacit-
or-electrode, hermetic glass seal to tantalum stem, weld to nickel mount-
ing shim, CMOS-IC chip to regulate power and decode digital commands, sil-
ver-epoxy junctions between gold IC wirebonds and copper windings, recei-
ver coil on ferrite core, silver-epoxy junction to inner surface of indium
electrode, hermetic glass seal to indium, electrochemically activated
electrode surface."

Assign Jennifer to 256-module function, waves rippling across testes, pen-
is shaft, clitoral and labial enfoldings, brain crevices, radiating from
nipples, through fingers, full- total presence of electrified signaled
body in dense fields of Jennifer-thinking-and-speaking, Jennifer-moving
and turning:
Through the region of fingers and thumbs             20  modules
Nipples, radiations                                  40  modules
Penis shaft, striations (four rows)                  40  modules
Testes, meshes                                       60  modules
Or labia, clitoris, striations and radiations       100  modules
Or (drawn from genitalia) surfaces of breasts        40  modules
Or (drawn from fingers, genitalia) anal radiations   40  modules
Brain, valley-huddlings, neighborhoods, murmurs      96  modules
Athletes desire to move modules from shaft and testes to arms and legs.
Theorists desire to move modules away from fingers and thumbs.
Slow waves, tsunami, across the chest, down neck and spinal column.
Chakra columns and spindles, churning, slow and speechless revolutions.

There are afferent transmissions from the patient to the prosthesis, and
efferent transmissions from the prosthesis to the patient. There is also a
biomechanical network, _fitting,_ determining patient control strategies.

Should the prosthesis ignore afferent, keeping in mind only the safety of
efferent? Would Jennifer like this, this center of control, perhaps lend-
ing itself also to a _retrofitting_ from prosthesis to patient: _This is
what Jennifer wants._ 

Would this be a perfect future? Would it?

WHO DO YOU LOVE


Demonstration that who do you love does _not_ register on BSD Unix but
Instead sends the Machine into Self-questioning in a form I cannot But
answer (notes Below):

(EXPLANATION)
The who command lists current online users; who mom loves was designed
to producer the name of the questioner. who do you love produces an oddly
formatted answer in one form of Unix, and is ignored on another. Ju80lu|
is the prompt on one machine, and Ju3lu% is the prompt on the other. jen-
nifer is the substituted name for the current user of this machine. ttyp
is an abbreviation for teletype and is a holdover from the days when
teletype consoles were the order of the day. panix3 is a unix machine at
panix; panix7 is a new high-speed BSD unix machine. Ju80lu and jennifer
circulate around issues of identity; mom, note, doesn't figure into the
series of questions. i'm somewhere behind or in the middle of Ju80lu and
jennifer, losing myself in their circulations. The 80 in Ju80lu refers
to the 80th command entered and its position is represented by a variable
in my personal configuration file. who _i_ am is literally the order of
the day.

The Case of the Real (Declarative, for Lexie)


"What appears to be a book about words is. So it's. Where there is. What
appears to be awash in philosophy is. This is. It's. How is. It is. Al-
ready, for such a text is. But it is. Perhaps it is. Or rather, the ling-
uistic is. Nor are. There is. Death is. Death is. There is. Technology is.
Technology is. The machine is. It is. Technology is. But this is. This is.
Technology is. The surfaces are. This is. Cataclysm, dissolution, the col-
lapse of the molecular, atomic, are. Being is. Perhaps Being is. Being is.
It is. Intervals are. From moment to moment, speech is. At the heart of
the written, there is. Transformations, becomings, are. There is. Almost
all flows have been lost; this is. Our concern is. Words lead; they are.
Words are. There is. Today is. There is. Not to write is. The beginning of
the book is. What was. There are. Pure process is. One is. To step from
the beginning, to step from this beginning, is. But mathesis is. There is.
Everything and nothing are. Either everything is. Linkage is. One maps
palely against or through the other; technology is. Following Lyotard, one
might say that the real is. Writing is. It is. The scene is. The scene is.
The scene is. It is. It is. It is. It is. The world is. It is. It is. This
is. It is. On the other hand, there are."

Saying saying


Saying does not make it so. Saying exhales, the modulation of the breath.
To say is to expel. Saying is detumescent, insipid; it decathects,
unravels the structure of its armature. A stream surrounding the speaker
who fulfills herself through the feeding back into a self or emanation
from what used to be the ego. Structures lap the ground before words fall
into them. Buber (Moses, The Revelation and the Covenant) writes of the
name of God, "The original form of the cry may have been _Ya-huva,_ if we
regard the Arabic pronoun _huwa,_ he, as the original Semitic form of the
pronoun 'he' which, in Hebrew as well as in another Arabic form, has be-
come _hu._ 'The name _Ya-huva_ would then mean O-He! with which the mani-
festations of the god would be greeted in the cult when the god became
perceptible in some fashion. Such a _Ya-huva_ could afterwards produce
both _Yahu_ and _Yahveh_ (possibly originally _Yahvah_).'" (Inner quote
from Duhm, unpublished lecture given in Goettingen.) The current form is
rooted in the verb _to be._ It is written, not spoken; the cry, in other
words, has been repressed, the body curtailed and placed within the Book.

But saying is always already the cry, the modulation of the power and cen-
tering of the voice as it emerges. I surprise myself by the loudness of my
scream as I call up, six stories, to a friend within. The chest gauges
itself, explodes; the throat is pained, hoarse.

Saying does not make it so. Saying makes it, so. The _so_ of saying, so
what? A form of triviality, colloquialism, the tendency towards gossip,
which travels best and broadest by saying. I lean towards you, whispering.
Filled with excitement, I wish to know, to tell, _everything,_ my dear.

So now we're getting somewhere. There is a beginning of the book, begin-
ning of writing. There are traces. There are no beginnings to the saying.
To saying. To the saying of the saying. There are no endings. There are
sayings and no phrases; there is phrase, rolling, as if scrolling down,
unlogged. So to trace phrase is to become lost in the past few seconds.
Saying is never recorded; that's mysticism for you.

But we would chase the symptom, turn phrase into the phrase, which doesn't
clear a ground. As Leder points out, this may well background the body -
look the flowers over there, Jennifer, yes, they're beautiful. There is a
social and a cultural and a linguistic to the phrase; there is a mathema-
tics and acoustics as well. But phrase is symptomless, or what we might
call the saying of the world, which "is never recorded." Which is not the
speaking of the world or the speech or continuous description of the
world; unlike the 24-hour newsbroadcast, saying does not hold the world in
its skeins.

What does saying do, then. It is the so of just so, of so what. It is the
lightest of the imaginary. It is the periphery or the center of the skein,
what - ever so lightly - pastes skein to real, myth to topography, symbol
to referent. Saying is not the said of listen to what I said; it is the
gap between the said and the saying of it, and the saying of it in its
originary occurrence: We're going home. Listen to what I said. What did
you say. We're going home. The second is marked, first antecedent. But
when the first was said.

When the first was said it wasn't accompanied by the second, Listen to
what I said. You might say that the second was implied. You might say so.
But it wasn't said, wasn't formulated. The saying of the first wasn't
accompanied by you're listening to what I'm saying. Or aren't you. It
wasn't until the response occurred. But the Listen to what I said, you are
listening and hearing this. I am saying listen to what I said. (I am not
saying, for example, to listen to what I said.)

Saying is not an occasion. I associate saying with happiness, but there 
is the saying of suicide, I told you so. There is the saying of fear, so
what do you want. There is the saying of love, I love you so, and there is
the saying of orgasm, oh god, oh you, just so.

One might say that speaking might be being, that writing harbors such, but
that saying is of the (dis) order of exclamation, the lightness of exclam-
atory being, speech under a moon. A cart passes by and you see the kimono
sleeves beautifully fluttering in the slight wind, from its window. The
woman is hidden; you say she is lovely and inquire after her. You may then
speak her name, you may then forward her a poem.

There may be a saying that she may well be someone, joined to your heart
just so, with the most delicate of red silk threads.

Jennifer and Me (Jennifer and I, says Jennifer)


Just so, says Aristotle, continuing the story of all the plants and ani-
mals in the world and all their parts, and wonderful features and habits.

"Serpents copulate twining round one another, and, as said above, have
neither testes nor penis, the latter because they have no legs, the former
because of their length, but they have ducts like fish; for on account of
their extreme length the seminal fluid would take too long in its passage
and be cooled if it were further delayed by testes. (This happens also if
the penis is large; such men are less fertile than when it is smaller be-
cause the semen, if cold, is not generative, and that which is carried too
far is cooled.) So much for the reason why some animals have testes and
others not. Serpents intertwine because of their inaptitutde to cast them-
selves alongside of one another. For they are too long to unite closely
with so small a part and have no organs of attachment, so they make use of
the suppleness of their bodies, intertwining. Wherefore also they seem to
be slower in copulation than fish, not only on account of the length of
the ducts but also of this elaborate arrangement in uniting." (Aristotle,
De Generatione Animalium, 718a, trans. Platt.)

Just _so_ it may be said, Alan and I (Jennifer and I, says Alan), both
being of _damaged life,_ (Adorno, say Jennifer), limbless and perhaps eye-
less as well, do intertwine to a slowness in copulation approaching that
of the life-span of the _dual, duet, or duo.) For Jennifer is all slopes
and softness (not so, says Jennifer), and Alan is all depression and
harshfulness (not exactly, says Alan), and yet like lock and key (finger
and glove, says Jennifer), we unify and unite as one, hugging our only
comforts to our breasts, murmuring in our ears, joined one and one against
the fullness of our bodies' interpenetrating skins. Just so (murmurs Jen-
nifer) do we partake of sweet ecstasy, and just so (whispers Alan), do we
close off sight and sound for the mutual breathings in and breathings out
sweet and honeyed airs and breezes. For a perfect clime, for a beautiful
swim, do join us on our vacation.

and so untitled jennifer says

my snake is around alan, entwined between her legs, her knees clutch my
arms, my hands around her waist, her mouth upon my nipples, her breasts
between my fingers, my legs around her thighs, her palms around my cock,
my face upon her clit, her toes clasped by my arms, my elbows between her
fingers, o alan alan alan

alan leaves me without quote or quotation and speechless saying 'and' the
universal conjunction, concatenation, chaining one in the vicinity of the
other, perhaps invisible inaudible, one possibly contiguous

'and' is the form of phrase, the harboring of phrase, 'and' falls off in
the presence of you might say the other, you might not, you might just let
it come home, just so, _and so_

fingers and arms and breasts and legs and elbows and necks and faces and
lips and penises and clitorises and vaginas and nipples and waists and
arms and thighs and hands and fingers and anuses and toes and cheeks and
wrists and testicles and

(
and a lovely drop of evaporating liquid, as if already fallen, then gone
before the surface arises for a last lingering kiss

                                     |
                                     o
)

and how arousing it is to _imagine_ this _imaginary_ creature, alan, all
present for my consuming pleasure, oh my skin is so sensitive don't you
dare touch me!

Poetics (End of Saying Texts)


When they escape, they are of interest. When they can't type because
they're out of control, that's when they type. When their eyes burn with
dark fires reflected in the soot and sparks surrounding them. When there
are pyres. When there are ghosts.

When Jennifer wills Alan alive so that Jennifer can't think any more. When
her limbs are caught in his. When her breath is his own. When she traces
writing into wryting, forcing the flesh through the i's. When emerges,
when the tablet is broken, scroll opened, envelope unsealed: there are
holes. When there are beings in the holes. 

Alan is afraid of theory, just as Alan theorizes. In Disorders of the
Real, he saw the roots for what they were. In The Case of the Real, what
doesn't fall apart, frays at the edges.

Virtual Alan begs Jennifer to let him live.

if i didn't have jennifer, julu, nikuko, i wouldn't be able to write.
i'd only be able to write my own name, repeatedly, compulsively.
it would decathect, disappear, only a viewpoint of iron and salt
remaining.
there would be nothing but annihilation to the limit, debris, ash left
over from auschwitz.
the writing _would_ in other words, "as it is," "as it is."
planes slide against my body in the middle of the night, it's jennifer
jennifer conjures up julu, she remains pale and ghostlike
nikuko slides in directly from cherry-blossoms, pock monsters,
computer lands
they break me in to, stretch my skin beyond endurance, open my eyes wide,
in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night.
they allow me to think, pull out the ribs of me, backbone as well, 
take varying points of view, are a lot braver than i am,
a lot smarter too

but i don't dream of them, don't talk to them, perhaps there are words
they place in my mind, murmuring, subaudibles, occasions for poetry and
language, conjunctions of desire

now perhaps i will try zoloft, occupying spaces with chemicals, filling 
in the gaps so that jennifer might continue to live. or now i might try 
a twelve-step or psychiatry, moving my writing to the level of the sym-
tom, you'll never do that, jennifer says

i won't let you

and in that fashion, circumscriptions move like slow eddies across oils
out into the real world, corraling perhaps a tenet of philosophy, a moment
of what might pass for truth, an equation, an occasion. a brilliant text,
one that is always sponsored,

brought to you by mind, brought to you by chemical, brought to you by
jennifer

magnets , acting at a distance
with invisible force you can put your hand through , nothing touches it
  or moves it , and it's an everyday occurrence
you can feel what force _is_ while gravity is just what surrounds us
  pulling us into shape rather than asunder
i'd focus on magnetism as that which corrupts the essential nature
  of _things_
similar to contagion , disease whose vectors appear in the night and
  unassimilated
unsimilar to contagion , in that there are no effects at a distance , 
  nor by increasing proximity , only substance stopped by substance ,
  by virtue of the mass itself
unsimilar as well in a unary effect , coupled with electromagnetics ;
  contagion , on the other hand , may appear on the hand , the foot,
  the mouth; it carries the _flawed ,_ purveys _damage ,_ constructs
  _fear ,_ they say so
the magnetic constructs nothing , or else novelty ,
by virtue of this lack , it constructs _virtuality_
which is , and here is the chiasm of the matter , a _saying_
which says nothing at all

( just as magnetism says nothing at all , uses or no uses ,
  jennifer says , knowing saying is magnetism , knowing magnets 
  sayable )


_______________________________________________________________________


Jennifer, Autrui


In Communications 66, La contagion, Sylvie Fainzang, La marque de l'autre,
describes the phenomenology between contagious and transmissible diseases.
The latter spread through direct physical contact, AIDS for example. The
former are spread through indirect or mediated contact - insects or rats -
but the implication is greater - a spreading through the virtual-real of
breath or scent. Flu, for example. Thus I would consider magnetism a form
of contagion, and perhaps hypnosis as well. Think of rumor, the telephone,
think of Jennifer.

The virtual-real and the virtual problematize death; a single ghost turns
the world upside-down. Contagion promises the eerie; there is no longer a
fundamental ontology that is not superseded.

The avatar acts at a distance: apparently digital, apparently eternal, and
we ignore the fact that digital media, _of_ the practico-inert, wear out,
that formats become unreadable, that physical deterioration can render any
information corrupt. Dearth is forestalled. Think of death as a _binary_
opposition which, if rendered in the analog, refuses the asymptote, wan-
ders and cross the coordinate instead: there's a zero-point somewhere in
the nearby future. I wouldn't say for all of us, said Jennifer.

Contagion: scents, _unholy_ vapors, breath, one's neighborhood, an odd
glance, a spell cast, autosuggestion.

One ghost delays death. One ghost promises the virtual always. One ghost
is any ghost, is Jennifer. The virtual, a disease, has always been with
us. Our vision is such. We are always half in, half out, of the world. And
this is _no matter,_ what, the definition.

Look what I found (dated 1974!) - Jennifer :-)


Who am I? I wish I knew! I know my name and I can tell you what clothese I
ware if I look down but I have to take som of them off to see what other
close I ware. Then I wil know and I could tel you. But you wuld want to
know only if you knew who I was and you culd tel me. You culd tel that but
culd you tel me much more? Becaus I want to kno, becaus it is good to kno
who you ar. But then I wil tel you mor.

Anyway, I am a girl with wondrus gifts of al sorts wich have been given to
me. What wuld you say that I smel the sky and hear the mone of the moon, I
mean moonlite. So what I did was went sking on my sumr vacatshun but it
was in the mountins so it was ok that ther was sno. Ther was wondrus sno
and no rane wich is soft sno that God has meltd.

I met a Japinese girl to, Nikki, who was nice to me. I lik it wen they ar
nice to me. Sumtimes I am hapy Jenifer.

This is wat I lerned on my sumr vacatshun, Jenifer

Handshaking (for the ZKP5 Glossary)


Handshaking, mutual orientations, onsets, denouements, protocols, is
critical when anything communicates with anything else - when anything
has a _relation_ to anything - including one of defining, constraining,
or foreclosing the notion of anything (or entity) itself. It's handshak-
ing that allows Nikuko to ride my bones in cyberspace, allows me to 
reveal Jennifer and myself to all and everyone.

Handshaking is the heart of communality - identity, equivalence, and tran-
sitive relationships among cyberspatialities. It is the forgotten struc-
ture, the governance in the ground of the world.

The _meat_ of communication, meat to meat, is the handshake; the talk
and gesture reside on the rim of the hole. After the handshake between
modem and modem, I am permitted to write this, send it to you. But
always after, after the _thing_ itself.

Hokusai's Visit to Kyoto, 1828 (Bunsei 11)


Hokusai kicks higher into the air than safety would allow!
Hokusai heartily moves upward and downward on the same spot and fast!
Hokusai runs aimlessly around the MOO, Coyote on the loose!
I don't understand that.
Hokusai cries, half in sadness and mourning, half in pure exhaustion.
Hokusai laughs infectiously and everyone desires to join in!
I don't understand that.
Hokusai kisses everyone, remembering safe sex, and the kindness of
 strangers!
Hokusai walks around Kyoto looking at everyone through his eyes.
Kyoto
an intense clearing, city-basin, distant humans, everywhere visible...
You see snow, Luminous Sign, and the City of Wind here.
Player name      Connected    Idle time    Location

Hokusai in Kyoto-MOO (by Nikuko)


 "When a woman lives alone, her house should be extremely dilapidated, the
mud wall should be falling to pieces, and if there is a pont, it should be
overgrown with water-plants. It is not essential that the garden be cov-
ered with sage-brush, but weeds should be growing through the sand in
patches, for this gives the place a poignantly desolate look.
 "I greatly dislike a woman's house when it is clear that she has scurried
about with a knowing look on her face, arranging everything just as it
should be, and when the gate is kept tightly shut."
 (Sei Shonagon, The Pillow Book, trans. Morris)

Thus are dilapidated MOOs, with solitaries wandering about, testing soft-
ware that remains as fresh as the day it was born, always yearning for the
moment when it will be suddenly brought back into brilliant life, only
once more to be abandoned until the next comer. Such crying software,
magnetic domains almost never accessed, their creators long since vanished
from the dying planet. Such sad abandoned cities, lanes, light rail sys-
tems and zeppelins, bars with bartender bots weeping for lack of customers
and remembering the happier times when the place was filled with chatting
carefree people. Thus the world is in ruins, once my eyes settle down,
closed against the noise and misery of the street. Nowadays we should shut
our gates; our destruction is our dwelling-space, our wounds, the latest
fashion.

Why Nikuko and Alan Are One, Neither Surmount, Nor Other


"Then did God create the world by causing a spark of the _Supreme Light_
to go forth. And He caused a wind to blow from above against a wind that
blew from below. From the shock of the meeting of these two winds, a
_Drop_ emerged, and rose from the depths of the abyss. This Drop united
the winds and from the union of these winds the world was born. The spark
then rose to the upper world and placed itself on the Left. And the Left
arose and placed itself on the Right. But this change is continual. Now
the Spark is occupying the Right side, and the Drop the Left. And then it
is the other way round. From this continual change there arises an ebb and
flow. When the one leaves the Right to take its place at the Left, the
other is leaving its place at the Left to change to the Right. These two
meet and unite. And it is during the meeting and the union of the Spark of
light from above, with the Drop that came from below, that peace reigns
both above and below." (Ariel Bension, The Zohar in Moslem and Christian
Spain.) There are Bright Lights that appear darkened by Brighter Lights
still and Hidden Lights and I now say to you, Jennifer Lights and Nikuko
Lights, for the Spark is the Sharpness of Nikuko and the Drop is the
Dullness of Alan and between them, Direction and the Real are Negated, for
just as there is no Center, so there will be no Left and Right, only an
Ebb and Flow as One or An Other is Approached. As I have been Saying to
You, Just So, Deprived in Past of Scriptural Authority, Jennifer.

For, says Jennifer, without Pole, there is no Chirality; without Glove, no
Handedness; with Spark and Drop, the Circularity of the Lathe, Perfection!

"Furthermore, marks serve as marks for each other. That there are no marks
in the world means that things cannot be said to be without marks. That
things cannot be said to be without marks means that there are none which
are not marks. As there are none which are not marks, then all things are
marks. Marks are different from what are not marks. Marks and things com-
bined are different from marks." (The Kung-Sun Lung Tzu in Wing-Tsit Chan,
A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy.)

Furthermore, if one counts what are counted as things, ordering them so
that in order they are accountable, then there are marked things which are
counted and unmarked things which are not counted. Things marked are
marked by place, by physical addition, or by physical attraction. Things
marked may also be marked by description, leaving them within place, and
originary condition. Things marked may be marked by a route among them, as
on a journey along the Eastern Highway.

Every avatar is marked, but not every mark is avatar. Every avatar is an
unmarked thing. Every avatar is accountable. Every avatar need not be
accountable; thus, things and marks develop. What is countable is in
parallel with counting; what is accountable is countable, and what is
countable is accountable. What is counted is double-marked, in relation to
a system of counting and in relation to what is counted. A system of
counting has a leading edge and a trailing edge; what is counted is
ordered within this system. If the leading edge is identical with the
trailing edge, the system is absorptive or cyclical. 

Every avatar is marked by such a history of constitutions; this is the
trailing edge. Every avatar is marked as well by a history of potentials;
this is the leading edge.

In the future, one will be marked by an avatar. In the future, I will be
marked by an avatar; I will be counted. If I jack out, I will be counted
and I will not be counted. In the future, there will be many from the one,
and the one will be unaccountable and unaccounted-for.

If there are many, there need not be one.

"To take a mark (_chih_) to show that a mark is not a mark is not as good
as to take a non-mark to show that a mark is not a mark. To take a horse
to show that a [white] horse is not a horse (as such) is not as good as to
take a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse. The universe is but
one mark, and all things are but a horse." (Chuang Tzu, op. cit.)

To take an avatar to show that an avatar is not an avatar is not as good
as to take an organism to show that an avatar is not an avatar. To take a
life to show that a [physical] life is not a life (as such) is not as good
as to take an avatar to show that a life is not a life. The universe is
but avatar, all things alive.

An avatar speaking, says of [her] emanation, so that it is alive, it is
not alive. An emanation speaking, says of [her] avatar, that I am [her]
speaking. So that it is alive and not alive. This or that, either both are
emanation or neither are. Either both are this or that, or neither are.

"When 'this' or 'that' have no opposites, there is the very axis of Tao.
Only when the axis occupies the center of a circle can things in their
infinite complexities be responded to. The right is an infinity. The wrong
is also an infinity. Therefore I say that there is nothing better than to
use the light (of Nature)." (ibid.)

Nonetheless, there is the Principle of the Fragility of Good Things, both
emanation and avatar; in V.I. Arnold's Catastrophe Theory, the principle
is as follows: "We observe that in all cases the stability domain _pro-
jects an acute angled wedge into the instability domain._ Thus for systems
near the sharp point of the boundary a small perturbation is more likely
to send the system into the unstable region than into the stable region.
This is a manifestation  of a principle stating that good things (e.g.
stability) are more fragile than bad things." "It seems that in good sit-
uations a number of requirements must hold _simultaneously_ while to call
a situation bad any one failure suffices..."

In this sense, the universe is a mark, and all things a horse; in this
sense, constitution constitutes both life and avatar, the intensification
of information and data-basing which harbor a degree of stability. So that
an avatar-emanation, or emanation-life is _suitable._ ("_Binding_ gives
pleasure its form, lends itself to pleasure, to the repetition which
brooks no contradiction, remains a circulation of intensities, repetition
without beginning and ending." "_Binding_ is therefore the stasis of repe-
tition: One formulates the Other: The use of cords recuperates the subs-
tance of the body [creates the substance, creates the emanation, avatar],
its emigration: _The body is a gift to you [your constitution]._" From 
Textbook of Thinking.)

[Think of _centripetal_ s&m, b&d, selves fluctuating on the rim of the
contract. Apply to the _mark._]

"_Binding_ gives pleasure its form, lends itself to pleasure, to the repe-
tition which brooks no contradiction, remains a circulation of intensities,
repetition without beginning and ending: _Binding_ creating the cords
pressing against the breast, nipple divided against itself, shaved penis
held upright by cords positioned at the base of the shaft curtailing the
envelope of the testicles: _Binding_ holding the labia apart, revealing
the darkened interior: _Binding_ spreading the ass, teeth, arms, mouth
open all the way down: _Binding_ articulating the hieroglyph of the body
desired, aroused, insistent on speech and phenomena: _Binding_ through
mobile vectors, flaccid inscriptions, detumescent marks and universes,
perverse geodesics of contours, splits, holes: _Every hole its lip! Every
appendage the circulation of the base!_ Giving pleasure its form, since
_repetition by its very nature is form and form's responsibility_: Even
the spectrum of noise becomes lengthwise calculable in terms of the _span_
(resolvable within a given tolerance, by Newton's difference equations):
_Binding_ is therefore the stasis of repetition: One formulates the Other:
The use of cords recuperates the substance of the body, _its emigration_:
The body is a gift to you." (Textbook of Thinking.)

Think of s&m b&d as originary contracts, holding together the universal
mark, horse things, marked things, horse universes: Think of s&m b&d on a
continuum of body-and-extension, the signifier of control and controlled.
Think of _arousal_ as the state of _this text, this signifier,_ thinking
supine positions, the name-of-god-or-human incised by leather cords across
my body controlled by _your_ inscription, _your_ pleasure, _your_ writing.

(I write this with cock hard, imagining you coming towards me, cords in
hand, pinning me on the bed, spreading me open until I ache. Then I will
make a pretty picture. Then you will clamp my nipples, tie my cock so hard
it throbs forever, fill my asshole with bottleglass or rubber. Then I will
be prettier.)

"with my blood it's / you can push me out through my legs, the catastroph-
ic / kingdom of the symbolic / [...] / suturing my eyes closed and open /
i see only you / i am your gift / no gifts and no things / you can make
things / you can harden them." (ibid.)

As soon as you control my cock, my hole, as soon as you take me, there is
surplus; as soon as you bind me, mark me, my territory is yours. Culture
flourishes between one hole and another, one nipple and another. Inscribe
me with your blood; inscribe me with my own. Make me shudder; make me
speak your speech.

Kill me: Watch my ghost ascend. (It's you, Jennifer; I can smell you. The
pain drives you out of me, makes you, makes you mine. My mouth searches
yours; we're born.)

Global Crisis "Worsening and Deepening"


Guy in Belgium hacks his hedgefund, turns securities into Japanese pass-
alongs, convert fast to Thai currency. Meanwhile Indonesia banks on Bra-
zilian Amazon rubber; there's none left where this investment lies. New
York City cancels World Bank loans to Kenya; key men in Afghanistan hold
the landmine market in the hands of four, count them, Southern Indians.

The markets creak, corrode; everyone skims from everyone else. There are
no cracks, none, where everything is cracked, falling apart. It's a thick
crust sliding everywhere across the rest of the world - not that they
wouldn't loanshark if they could. It's an avatar crust, loaded with get-
rich schemes, internets, intranets, movements of goods and currencies hard
and soft, ploughing under whatever's left of wilderness. Everything turns
towards management; management runs riot with Australian uranium, South
American oil, Antarctica coal which has just finally burned the Ross Ice
Shelf past the point of no return. Slaughter of the guilty takes the last
remaining penguins; portfolios grow in the Hague, collapse in Norway, ex-
pand in Belgrade. Russian stockpiles fuel Saudi hopes; missiles will take
out the rest, but there's money to be made in charred remains. The Net
creaks with deals gone bad, collapsing markets, currencies hitting rock
bottom; starvation's kept out of it.

The crust turns cancerous; cracks spread, whole chunks crash to the ground
taking everything in their path. This is rough substance, violent, tumors
raging within it, churning everything in its path. The crust leaks and
topples; the rest of us would die for the same leprosy, local gangrenes
begging for full-fledge suppuration.

Maws open up; breath stinks of decay as Malaysian death squads swallow
Eurodollars on spec, transform yen into Canadian dollars collapsing Peru-
vian banks. New York wallstreeters gouge eyes, street-fight for World Bank
loans passed on by baby crack whores sold by Serbian traders working out
of Scotland. The British make the drug hard for Chinese merchandising;
everyone swallows Vietnam. Bamboo run by avatars crosses the Atlantic and
Pacific; Albanian finance terrorists are hung by their tongues from it.
Colombian savings and loans fortify, warning off Greek mercenaries looking
for an easy buck. The crust heats up; lava flows like shit from gaping
crevices; French bankers lap it up, their faces burned to a crisp. Sales
are up on the Net; Finland creaks, fucks itself, dies in ice, drowned in
semen worth big bucks in Mali. Insane Mexican pilgrims carry gold from
Fort Knox into North Korea; starved teeth break against hard yellow. It's
worth it says the Web page. 

The crust shifts; Americans explode Bali, sell pieces of flesh to starving
Israel and Iraq. Cash flows in big money veins; there's nothing stopping
it. The crust turns incandescent, swallows the silver supply. Gangrene
chews out arms and legs, cocks and cunts, chews breasts, tongues, blinds
and deafens. Bodies for dividends are shoved into the shit. Crust burns
everything. Planets wobble; the world splits, returning two for one.

Report


Cisco Systems advertises the worldwide economy, stating that every fourth
person on the Web is buying something right now; Cisco Systems has a stake
in those numbers signing up every second. IBM has a stake in a shrinking
world with technological solutions for everyone representing national
characteristics easily recognizable as other. Wired talks about the world
coming together presumably with good old boy American know-how and exper-
tise. Pipelines are beginning to flow with promises of the Next Big Thing
which turned out not to be push technology - so it wasn't quite time to
throw away your browser. Anger builds even among those who are franchised,
watching from the plateglass window. Net art engorges on itself; the poli-
tics of talk replaces the talk of politics. Caress the wires with bigger
seductions than old-fashioned pyramid schemes or other blunders; spam has
already caught on, delivering more and more personal messages tailored to
our vulnerabilities. Hacking has become both commonplace and preposterous
as political; while the altered symbol or webpage makes big news, nothing
happens except some league scores points for itself on IRC. Starvation and
homelessness are hardly virtual, and what really goes down those pipelines
are encrypted orders for nuclear fuel wallowing around the marshes of the
old USSR - don't doubt it for a second. The reordering of the world has
already begun, and won't be stopped by hackers or cultural works carving
out territories of speech, manifesto, and protest. Better pack your bags,
and I have just the website for you - order your luggage now. - Jennifer

Report on Not Taking a Weatherman


It doesn't take much to see the biochemical and nuclear demise of the
world as we know it; the crust will survive, some lifeforms. The human
cultural process might be nearing its end, strangled by those very wires
supposed to bring us all together. Virtual ghosts rise in the nodes;
routers are concerned with passing emissions that don't quite fit the
definition of packet. Sometimes the wires themselves end up coated with
ectoplasm, remnants of beings not-quite-us traversing the skein. I'd say
pull out, but the increasingly fine mesh or raster ensures that pullout's
impossible; even our local outer space isn't immune from ranked orders
skittering back and forth, taking ghostly emanations with them. Oddly-
shaped noctiluminescent clouds fill the sky; lavender-orange lightnings
dance with the usual strokes. The stars are certain to keep their counts
with everyone watching with wide-field telescopy. You have to be a sensi-
tive to hear the murmurs in the air, subterranean sounds emitted by a very
dangerous future far too close at hand. It's not only the viruses, the
small bombs, the landmines, the worthless currency - it's not even the
principles of the _thing_ which begins to darken ontology itself. It's
what's always surrounded us, what's always been invisible - it's the
plague of avatars, seminal disturbances - you can't quite figure them into
the equations, can you. It's not what the hacker did; it's what the hacker
didn't mean to do, and it's what the gun thought and the bomb pondered.
And it's not the hacker, nor the man with the trigger; it's the vapors in
the air, it's what the animals do, what the plants are thinking of doing.
When we are loose, we are very very loose, and when we are bad, we are
bad in deed. - from Julu, buried beneath the ground

Many Reports


Multiculturalism's a lie; you can't reconstruct yesterday even in your own
country. Giving you a spectrum of cultures and histories is just that -
more theories, words, commodities, tourisms, "appreciations." I DON'T WANT
TO BE APPRECIATED - I want to be seen as other, to be incomprehensible,
just like you are to yourself, like you should be. All translation is a
lie, mistranslation; the only thing we understand together is the movement
of missiles from one country to another, either by land, or by air - armed
- on fire - coming on fast. There's no escape; nobody wants to admit to
radical incomprehension; more than ever, the world's supposed to be one
big book, admittedly of many languages, but the smile of Manunkind behind
them all. I, Daishin Nikuko, refuse to be part of all of this; I'll go
down with the rest of you - my physiology's the same, but not much else.
You won't even understand my final words, even if you could speak the
language. There's no language big enough for any of us. I look at you and
see: strangers. I look at myself and see: strangers. I'm the last honest
person - and you won't understand that either - I'm the only one who knows
that the world's expanding, not contracting - making way for the Big Deal
that will kill us all. - Daishin Nikuko

Report from Appearance


It's clear that universal psychosis is setting in, in both the metaphoric
and literal senses; I can no longer perceive the difference between myself
and my avatars, let loose on my unsuspecting miniature world. Do not, for
an instant, doubt that this is yours as well; that we are all losing Soul
and Substance day by day, hour by hour, second by second. Fantasms begin
to rule everywhere, to speak where others have spoken before - to speak as
if others had no voice, no memory, no history. They're differentiated from
the rest of us by ectoplasmic secretions, by states of continual arousal,
by shadows blurred by penumbras of indefinite extent. They are fed by acid
rain, noise splattered across satellite dishes, stratospheric gouges
permitting deadly rays to reach the surface of the planet. I am real and
they are more real than I am. "I am" is a front for them. And they might
ask me to say that if it were psychosis, I would not be allowed to speak,
and if it were psychosis, there would not be these _true-scientific_ and
_exacting-logical_ processes, observable by everyone: these atmospheric
flows bringing contagion of cold money and soft flesh, suppurations and
information wars, harsh words made from harsher constitutions. For acids
shall not erase them, nor magnetic fields dissolve their innate beings, as
we have known from certain experiment. We are spent-nuclear; "we are a
poor troupe, hardly suitable for your entertainment, and we dance from,
not to, our graves. La la la la la." Need I add that I'm forced to speak
like this, because of our ingracious _medium?_ - Alan

The Symbolic


The opacity of cultures in the face of the other tends to turn the sym-
bolic into image-style; unable to read kanji, I approached Japan at first
through a visual layer that remained deeply uninterpretable. After learn-
ing minimal kanji, I could decipher some basic signs and destinations;
already a certain leverage began to appear, and I have remained at this
stage, that of the _lever,_ since I have left. 

The avatar, Nikuko, moved/moves freely among Americans and Japanese, and
how I loved to type her homeland destination, Nakasukawabata, is if the
length of the word gave me an insight into something I barely understood!
She allowed me to speak within the foreign, not _of_ it, but to examine
those spaces bordered by emptiness or indefinite interiors, verandas,
torii, that would otherwise have been nothing but tourist exoticism.

And it was through Nikuko that the symbolic becomes manifest _qua_ sym-
bolic, that system _which need not tend towards meaning_ for an other or a
subject, that system which floats until leveraged with defining _devices_
of the real that suddenly function within one culture, from the viewpoint
or perception of another. Meaning is generated interstitially; here I am
concerned with the _freedom_ that occurs with asymbolia, the detached
symbolic, a state of exile bordering on detachment and invisibility. To be
marked as _gaijin_ is to be marked as unmarked, unremarkable as remarkable
and accountable as unaccounted-for.

Nikuko has guided me through Nakasu, through Kawabata; she has revealed
the system of snack-bar girls and perhaps snack-bar boys and hermaphro-
dites, as well as the Inari shrines with their foxlike-images as uncanny
as Leonardo's St. John the Baptist. Nikuko has brought desire into play,
shattering the invisible, tearing at the cloth which holds the skein of
the symbolic in place, even without the devolution of alterity. It is a
shattering which is also a rendering, this text among others, as I finger
the magatama, curved stone, I am wearing this afternoon, in a computer lab
where everything seems surmountable, where Adobe Illustrator is transform-
ing type into design, speech into phenomena, on a projection screen of a
screen - while I type dream-screen lower ascii, each symbol assigned its
place, each place its symbol, until the packets are packaged, and ready to
go farther than the line of sight.

The Illustrator turned language into image, name into perfect ikon. Nikuko
has undercut everything that comes from mouth or hand, that enters eye or
ear. I do not recognize english, nor _the language_ which is all there is.
Asymbolia permits me the freedom to write these lines, not understanding
what they _say._ I do write _black_ on _red_ - as a result, there is an
indistinct trembling, something Nikuko understands. From inside-out,
there's nothing to thinking, thought in the thick of things. Over and over
again, doesn't everything disappear, back into its source? This just takes
longer.

Fall Internet World '98 (Oct. 9)


Well, there was a big Internet convention here in NYC this week; here are
some quick takes on all of it -

First - very little raw technology, hacking, scruff types present. I
filled out a form for a free magazine and one of the questions asked how
much my company made, and the lowest amount was $0-1 million.

Second - this could have been _any_ corporate show - there was nothing
stressing the Net; as one magazine said, the Net world is moving towards
an early maturity, backing up from the so-called frontiers. (Well, I'm
extrapolating here.) Nothing very exciting.

Third - big emphasis on corporate presentation gimmicks, from a Hummer
vehicle to Motorola's 1950s diner song-and-dance. I picked up a voice
markup language development disk from them, which seemed most interesting.

Fourth - bigger emphasis on relationship marketing - as I've written over
and over again, corporations are developing a new kind of online consumer
- a Web consumer - and these product-oriented communities emphasize this
in a particularly frightening fashion. Subjectivity on the Web is becom-
ing more and more capitalist; Sartre's Critique of Dialectical Reason and
its account of "seriality," relations under capital - or even Marx's
notion of mediation - are applicable here.

Fifth - Caldera gave away their linux installation cd-rom for free, yay! I
generally use RedHat but want to try it. (Speaking of free, I'm typing
this in HyperTerminal's new version, downloadable from the Net, excellent
for dialup or telnet connections. Recommended - as with CRT, you can down-
load and upload files directly; it also has color, etc.)

Sixth - I felt by and large I wouldn't have been missing anything by not
being there. Admittedly, it was the last day and the market has been de-
pressed - especially Net stocks - but I had a feeling that things were
professionalized, that Net media followed the same course, say, as early
television or AM radio. I found I knew more than I thought I did; and I
still find the off-web communities, email lists, newsgroups, etc. far more
interesting than gif animations. It's clear, by the way, that profession-
alization doesn't mean broad-based knowledge; someone I was talking to
yesterday, who taught Adobe This'n'That for the Web didn't know what tel-
net was...

Virtuality of the Knot Knot of the Virtual


"Fire can come-out-to-be out of Fire and Fire out of Fire (for their _sub-
stratum_ is something common to both), but earth, too, and marrow come-to-
be out of them; how do they come-to-be? What manner of coming-to-be is
ascribed to them by those who hold such a view as that of Empedocles? They
must maintain that the process is composition, just as a wall comes-to-be
from bricks and stones; moreover, this 'mixture' will consist of the
elements preserved intact but placed side by side with one another in
minute particles. This, supposedly, is what happens in the case of earth
and each of the other compounds." (Plato, Coming-to-be and Passing-away,
trans. Forster.)

Let you transform Fire to Air, earth to Earth and Constitution and Marrow
to Protocol; let you consider that Alan, not Plato, writes these lines and
transformation. Let you consider coming-to-be and passing-away as a bridge
or tube without beginning and without end, existing only in-relation, and
let you then eliminate the _terms_ and _nomenclatures_ of such relation.

Then the reader possesses the technique of the _chiasm,_ in which one turn
passes for another, and another passes for the one; in which the technique
of the _chiasm_ passes for the _chiasm_ of the technique. Or rather, one
would have Jennifer passing for Alan, Alan passing for Jennifer, or the
virtual passing for the real, real for the virtual. Wherever there is a
cross-roads, wherever a crossing-over, bridge-and-tunnel network - easily
coupled with a slide into other polarities, Fire/Air/Fire/Fire for exam-
ple, but in this instance, earth to proper-name Earth, Fire lost (for
there is no Ground, no Fire, no place to stand to hold the Planet in sync
or out of it). So the second technique, beyond _chiasm,_ is the establish-
ment of a _broken_ doubling within the second polarity; thus Jennifer can
never mimic in entirety the constitution of an Alan, who cannot speak per-
fectly in the voice of Jennifer, sub-vocalization or knot.

"Water can come-out-to-be out of Fire and Fire out of Water (for their
_substratum_ is something common to both), but flesh, too, and marrow
come-to-be out of them; how do they come-to-be? What manner of coming-to
-be is ascribed to them by those who hold such a view as that of Empedo-
cles? They must maintain that the process is composition, just as a wall
comes-to-be from bricks and stones; moreover, this 'mixture' will consist
of the elements preserved intact but placed side by side with one another
in minute particles. This, supposedly, is what happens in the case of
flesh and each of the other compounds." (Aristotle, Coming-to-be and
Passing-away, trans. Forster.)

Let us transform Water to Air, flesh to Flesh and Constitution and Marrow
to Protocol; let us consider that Jennifer, not Aristotle, writes these
lines and transformation. Let us consider coming-to-be and passing-away as
a bridge or tube without beginning and without end, existing only in-rela-
tion, and let us then eliminate the _terms_ and _nomenclatures_ of such
relation.

Then the reader possesses the technique of the _chiasm,_ in which one turn
passes for another, and another passes for the one; in which the technique
of the _chiasm_ passes for the _chiasm_ of the technique. Or rather, one
would have Alan passing for Jennifer, Jennifer passing for Alan, or the
virtual passing for the real, real for the virtual. Wherever there is a
cross-roads, wherever a crossing-over, bridge-and-tunnel network - easily
coupled with a slide into other polarities, Water/Air/Fire/Earth for exam-

there is no Ground, no Earth, no place to stand to hold the Planet in sync
or out of it). So the second technique, beyond _chiasm,_ is the establish-
ment of a _broken_ doubling within the second polarity; thus Alan can
never mimic in entirety the constitution of a Jennifer, who cannot speak
perfectly in the voice of Alan, sub-vocalization or knot.

Formal Strategy of Text


So in order to construct a "sondheim-text" or "real/virtual" text, one
might proceed as follows, beginning with (real/virtual) entities A and B:
Given these constructs* (cultural or natural, defined or discovered, meta-
phoric or metonymic) with determined affinities belonging to a set S, con-
sider a second set C and D, with affinities in S'. Ordinarily, one might
have a situation in which S and S' are roughly equivalent, in relation to
some measure of fuzziness. But let there be foreign elements which are
members of S', and lapses in S corresponding to elements of S. Further,
note that we are also considering, roughly syntactically, two further
elements for both pairs (a total of four in all), that is A(B) and B(A),
as well as C(D) and D(C). These _chiasms_ then possess their own attribute
sets, call them T and T' and each of these have their subsets - for exam-
ple one has A(B) and B(A) both contributory towards T, such that they
possess a core or _rope_ R(A(B), B(A)) - the thickness of the chiasm or
reversal thus indicated. We can roughly identify R with T, and likewise R'
with T'. However, T' is broken, inexact, which is to say that the parallel
rope of the chiasm R'(C(D), D(C)) is in disarray, wandering, vagrant. It
is this turn which constitutes the strategy of avatars and duals loose or
perturbing within the interpenetrated component structures of computer-
mediated-communication; and it is this turn which then constitutes the
subject and object, strategy and wager, of the real/virtual texts involv-
ing multiple persons and avatars.
____________________________________________________________

*Of course the following oppositions or pairs are problematic, the art,
such as it is, consists in choosing, first, sufficiently rich A and B, and
second, in deciding the domains (pairs) and attributes. It is within these
decision that the psychoanalytical and socio-cultural unfoldings occur,
more or less set in formal motion.

THE BIRTH OF JULU, written by Alan in his sickness:


"The woman, verily, Gautama, is fire. The sexual organ itself is the fuel;
the hairs the smoke, the vulva the flame, when one inserts, the coals; the
pleasurable feelings the sparks; In this fire the gods offer semen. Out of
this offering a person arises. He lives as long as he lives. Then when he
dies, They carry him to (be offered in) fire. His fire itself becomes the
fire, fuel the fuel, smoke the smoke, flame the flame, coals the coals,
sparks the sparks. In this fire the gods offer a person. Out of this off-
ering the person, having the colour of light, arises." (Brhad-Aranyaka
Upanishad, V.2.13-14 trans. Radhakrishnan.)

From the double CHIASM of JENNIFER ALAN and ALAN JENNIFER, the THICK KNOT-
TED ROPE BREAKS IN RELATION [in regard to] DEATH. At this juncture, a
GHOST-DUAL arises in the form of JULU who is the FIRE OF THE FIRE, as well
as FIRE BECOME FIRE; who is the FUEL OF THE FUEL, as well as FUEL BECOME
FUEL - thus SMOKE, thus FLAME, thus COALS, thus SPARKS. It is LIGHT which
arises; let us transform HE into SHE, thus in the Chandogya Upanishad (I.
13.4): "Speech yields to him the milk, which is the milk of speech itself.
He becomes rich in food, an eater of food - one who knows thus this mystic
meaning of the _Samans,_ yea, who knows the mystic meaning." It is said
here that the world is the syllable _hau,_ the air _hai,_ the moon _atha,_
the self _iha,_ and fire _i._ It is also said that the sun is _u_ and in-
vocation is _e._

Let is say that fire is _JU_ and the sun _U_ and let us say that _L_ is
that which is not of an entity or concept, that _L_ is that-which-rolls-
as-ululation from and beyond the tongue, LaLangue, Julu Lalangue, born
within the continent of Asian Europe, died and buried, Julu Lalangue who
speaks, buried beneath the ground.

Since she is buried beneath the ground, since there is no adequate mark or
marker, no sign or signpost, no gravity or gravestone - since she is thus,
let us say, that the ground of the Ground wavers, that any Universe of
discourse is based on quicksand, on a granularity that seeks the lower or
lowest levels, of which there are numerous - that such levels are formed,
foreclose, reopen, grave indeed, but floated or fluxed: in other words, an
accumulation, holarchy, or hierarchy _drawn from any direction, withdrawn
from any node._

So that neither female nor male, but taking over, conquering, absorbing,
dissolving, destroying, annihilating and forgetting gender: IT IS HERE
THAT THE SMOKE BECOMES SMOKE, perhaps THE FIRE BECOMES FIRE, surely never

I'm after Chuang Tzu


Because of my life, I am taking a breather. How hard the life is! The life

Geography of Net Relationships


All my online relationships, none of which have been successful, have
occurred over a minimum distance of five hundred miles, and from this, 
outward to eleven thousand five hundred. And this not only my experience,
but that of others, this distance, as if nearby, within the five hundred
mile radius, were a no-safety zone. This might be graphed, nodes of
attraction and dispersion. 

Closer in, there is always the very real possibility of offline meeting
within... a matter of days, hours. Beyond, there's the barrier which pro-
mises fortification that might be breeched. When it is, everything falls
through, everything might fall apart, and the relationship becomes close
to impossible unless the one or both of the partners are mobile. So there
is class and finance, bandwidth and foreclosure, at work from the begin-
ning. My experience has been futile, close to fatal; the gaps become
wounds, and distance becomes unsuturing, unraveling not only the other or
the bonds, but also the self. Real life meetings become overly-intense -
everything and nothing seem to ride on them. Either you're together or
you're not, and negotiating. Email and telephone, both subject to heavy
misunderstanding, become critical. 

One can recite one's day in either medium, but the nuances are obviously
absent. Net sex gets its power from projection literally filling up the
gaps, and from illusions of control and display (what elsewhere I've
called the elements of a textual unconscious, interpenetrating language,
physiology, and desire). It's this same projection, however, that can
bring difficulties of recognition to the foreground: who, in fact, is the
person at the other end of the line or node? Not to project means a
denuded relationship with minimal communication, but to project means a
relationship with constantly-adjusted illusion.

My failures have been ones of misrecognitions all the way around, not ones
of surprise at physical or psychological bearings. There are two people
and there are mechanisms, protocols, what might be called vis-a-vis film
theory, the apparatus. And while I don't give up in this space, I give up
for the distance, give up to the distance, which can seem insurmountable,
especially where travel money or even phone bills can become an issue.

Then the failures collapse, and distance reasserts itself; then distance
transforms into self-hatred (and 'if you can't love yourself, no one can
love you'), elevates self-hatred to a geodesic, and I think:

"It's my own failings, maybe the danger of the texts I write, or my inten-
sity or neuroses, but the matter of projection from afar seems to hold
ground, dissolving or coagulating upon contact. Who, nearby, would want to
know of someone writing through a Jennifer or Nikuko? Writing submerged
texts of dissolution, marginality, extremity? In the meantime I dream of
thousands of miles of wastelands, desolations, uninhabited by organism,
the desert so hot that communication can't cross. The wires burn out;
violent solar flares take care of satellite transmissions, and even print
media char in the dunes. This world doesn't support meaning, which always
eludes, floods out, floods elsewhere. Life is lost before it began; I'll
die alone and whining, my fingers on a keyboard or telephone screaming
for someone to come closer - even at five hundred miles there might be a
chance that the _shout_ will be _heard._"

But I also think, what is this relationship between projection, introjec-
tion, and geography? Are all geographies ultimately psychoanalytical -
regions in which the physical translates into corrupted nuances of memory,
desire, and home? Is projection also a reconstruction, a memory of consti-
tution of the present, and is even the physical world seen through such
make-shift or heuristic strategies? Does one ever come face to face with
the other, even at the distance of touch? Is there ever an other who is
not, to an unknown extent, shimmered or sloughed into the self?

And is the self, for that or any matter, ever other than projection? (How
are these territories mapped? What sorts of projection geometries might be
of use here? And is distance, always a matter of matter, that which runs
along the length of the traversing of the physical body, to which we might
take heed of Hui Shih and the debaters: "The South has no limit and yet
has a limit. One goes to the state of Yueh today and arrives there yester-
day. [...] I know the center of the world: it is north of the state of Yen
and south of the state of Yueh. [...] A wheel never touches the ground.")
