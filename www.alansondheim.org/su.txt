ISIS NEWFLAG

http://www.alansondheim.org/isisflag.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/isisflag.mp4

A new flag for ISIS. A cross turned, kindly bent to let
the bodies down, perhaps an arm remains, propping the
rest of the weight. the wounded. Perhaps an X, sign of
belonging, gratitude to the beautiful clean world. There
are no animals here. Perhaps an X which itself moves in
violence, the focus of someone else's dream: it was the
land and its god which did the dreaming. Perhaps an
occlusion of solar light, a moment's cooling. But a new
flag, new allure, new days and new bodies. 

The allure of the X as well, a new flat for the taking,
copyright patent NEWFLAG, new bodies, worlds to conquer.
New: forms of torture, ransom, violence, pillage.
New: nations, cleansings, war machines, prisons.
New: religions new-day dawning, new controls. 
New: cleansed women, children. New: thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God. HE almighty. Thanks be to God.

Perhaps an X, carved, above or through the eyes.




Poesis and Poetics of ISIS


http://www.alansondheim.org/isisdisk10.png

Poetics of terror, monotheism, inerrancy, cleansing. Analysis is 
dead, dying, decayed, not of but without the body. Theory 
collapses, repeats, repeats repetitions, classes, demarcations, 
subalterns, alterns, reifications, expositions, histories, 
colonialisms. Nothing prepare us for nothing. I try to work 
through poetics, poesis, abjure, poetry, schemata of language, 
watch language grind to a halt, work through poetics, poesis of 
language halting. The gaps are blankness & cannot be filled with 
our speaking, murmuring, our crying, our wounded, our dead, our 
torturers.

see how textuality = thanatopoesis = thee = tion = tions = topos

be counter-productive if it were not true. We will always fear

Sargon, the ruler of Bel, the priest of Asur, the darling of 
Anu and Bel, the mighty king, king of hosts, king of Assyria, 
king of the four quarters, the beloved of the great gods

and the mention of his name caused to go forth for the greatest 
deeds, the mighty hero girt with terror, who for the overthrow 
of the enemy sendeth forth is arms, the valiant warrior,

forgot and trusted in his own strength. Against the kings and 
governors whom in Egypt had installed the father who begat me, 
to slay, to plunder, and to seize Egypt he marched., Against 
them he went in 

city which the father who begat me had conquered and to the 
border of Assyria had annexed.

I summoned my supreme forces with which Asur and Istar had filled 
my ends

the way ...

he summoned his fighting men, With the might of Asur, Istar, and 
the great gods, my lords, who go at my side, in the battle on the 
broad plain I accomplished the overthrow of his forces. 

heard the defeat of his forces.

That city I took; my troops I caused to enter and I stationed 
them therein. had conquered

fortified cities, I captured. Their forces in numbers I slew; 
their spoil, their possessions, and their cattle I carried off. 
Their soldiers escaped and occupied a steep mountain

Of a vulture within the mountain had they set their stronghold, 
In three days the warrior overcame the mountain

he cast down the mountain, he destroyed their nest, their host

He shattered, Two hundred of their fighting men I slew with the 
sword; their heavy booty like a flock of sheep I carried off; 
with their blood I dyed the mountain like crimson wool

their cities I overthrew, I destroyed I burned with fire.

they came to make war against me. I fought them and defeated 
them. Their warriors I overthrew with the sword, like Ramman I 
rained a deluge upon them, into trenches I heaped them, with the 
corpses of their mighty men I filled the broad plain, with the 
blood I dyed the mountain like scarlet wool. 

The team of his yoke I took from him, a pile of heads over 
against his city I set, his cities I overthrew, I destroyed, I 
burnt with fire. 

mile and female musicians, the whole of his craftsmen, as many 
as there were, and the officers of the palace I brought out and 
as spoil I reckoned.

I besieged, I captured, I carried off their spoil.

The walls of that temple had fallen in ruins. I was anxious, I 
was afraid, I was distressed and my countenance was troubled.

Dual guqin improvisations.
I'm really happey with these, oases of sonic companionship
and amazing music, the likes of which I haven't heard 
before. Stephen is a wonderful musician; we played two of
his gins, tuned in unison, the recorder between us. Enjoy!

"The end approaches, now it's too late to tell the truth about 
the apocalypse. But what are you doing, all of you will still 
insist, to what ends do you want to come when you come to tell 
us, here now, let's go, come, the apocalypse, it's finished, I 
tell you this, that's what's happening."

What Happened and different music

We left Brooklyn suddenly. We returned for the images last week. 
The real estate bubble (we're across the street from the Barclay 
arena) seems to have burst and I imagine another landscape of 
despair and abandonment. We left the building on Dean Street 
almost a year ago. It's still there, deteriorating, sad. Here's 
a brief report:

http://www.alansondheim.org/varied01.jpg
Mail forwarding note fading, still attached to the door.
http://www.alansondheim.org/varied02.jpg
Our names still on the doorbells.
http://www.alansondheim.org/varied05.jpg
Electric unpaid for months, there are fines.
http://www.alansondheim.org/varied18.jpg
Nearby a magnificent fungus in decay mode.
http://www.alansondheim.org/varied23.jpg
Black pigeon next to the police station.
http://www.alansondheim.org/varied29.jpg
Our building old, front. Air-conditioners ripped out,
windows opened to the elements, are there squatters?
We repaired the roof before every major storm. Now...
http://www.alansondheim.org/varied31.jpg
The side. We had the top floor, our curtains still 
there. 
http://www.alansondheim.org/mantis01.jpg
Praying mantis on the side of the building, perhaps
praying for us.
http://www.alansondheim.org/mantis10.jpg
Over the street, the 911 memorial shines brightly,
killing birds on migration routes.
http://www.alansondheim.org/mantis12.jpg
The fungus, slightly earlier.
http://www.alansondheim.org/mantis18.jpg
And again, the color of blood. And I try to sleep,
thinking of beheadings and rapes, and feel lost
outside the city, and then think, how trivial is
that feeling, at least I'm alive, and it doesn't
help.
http://www.alansondheim.org/mantis22.jpg
Across the street, the Barclay center, cause of
it all; the new building is modular, the pieces
don't fit together, construction's stopped.

This is most likely of interest only to myself, my friends. 
Displacement is almost always traumatic but this felt violent. 
We protested and fought the takeover of the neighborhood but
lost. Our taxes were going up. We were forced out of Brooklyn.
I don't remember my name.

Some music on a small gimri without a string loop:
http://www.alansondheim.org/gimri.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/gimri2.mp3
Always a lost elegy.

Apologies for all of this, enjoy the different music.




My Qing qin (most likely, mid-19th-century or earlier)

for Stephen Dydo

http://www.alansondheim.org/illustrated.png

http://www.alansondheim.org/qingqin1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/qingqin2.mp3

Stephen restored my qin, it sounds amazing.
Recorded with an H4n Zoom beneath it, no effects.
Peaceful.



Lulu Guqin Music, please have a listen, share!

http://www.alansondheim.org/lulu6.jpg

This makes me happy: playing two qin together; the older one is 
the darker. The hui markers are out of position on both; the 
older is fairly battered. They're not tuned together; each for 
me reflects a different set of lu (pitches) - hence lulu, a 
movement from one universal harmony to another. Here, they're 
played together, dissonant, entangled in parallel strokes, 
mingled. I love the result which at times sounds like bells 
ringing changes. It's peaceful, energized, swirling. As far as I 
know, qin are never played like this, but the heavens will 
understand and forgive me, yes?

Thanks to Stephen Dydo -

Atlantic Silversides

Images and video from the Providence River, which had a bloom of 
Atlantic silversides. Years ago we'd see Atlantic menhaden, but 
these seem to have disappeared; they filled the river. The 
silversides are smaller, but beautiful; the light reflecting 
from their scales makes the river flash and glisten. (The videos 
are slight, fish almost invisible, something of Sung aesthetics, 
uncanny, empty.)

of deaths, always to a news station helps. The bed's to my rear; 
angering buzzing aroused. you can fawn them. you can come. I'm 
your buzz - and then you'd have your dead zone, but no dead. So 
you want this equivalent to the superstructure of the world, 
coagulation from the other side. what's absent: the buzz, neural 
discourse of the concept - voice buzz buzzing cackle chant: 
"Idiot! I'm still talking. The phone's buzzing, the sky's just 
there, in flight." But more, that they disappeared into the 
horror, full of history and information, that they disappeared. 
sludge-world, bodies. it's the head in them that names.

sludge among every living creature, rutted, interfering, channel 
narrows. it's the head in them that's named.

then nothing.

I'm tone-deaf. I write out of total ignorance. If I write about

feel literally under the gun, that if I slow up, I'll collapse. 
However much you tear my work apart, I'll tear it apart first 
and far more drastically. I'm untouchable. I'm jealous of anyone 
with a position and an income. I'm afraid of everything, my 
shadow, the shadows of others. If it weren't for Azure, I 
wouldn't be here and that's a terrible burden for her to bear. I 
lie in bed for hours in the morning, wide-awake, my mind running 
wild until disaster seems so imminent that I must get up, get

something physical. I'm completely invisible to others unless I 
blurt out, assert myself, jump into a fray of my own creation. 
Deep down I know no place is safe for me. I find theory so 
decayed that I believe I can produce it by rote with no 
consequence whatsoever. I can't get rid of corrosion of the 
world's horrors, until I'm eviscerated, until I disappear. I'm 
so frightened of death, I can't watch anything dealing with it, 
online or offline. My whole career is created from kludges, 
making-do, bricolage. Goodness is invisible to me. I can't 
understand religion, religious belief; reincarnation seems an 
absurd fiction. I believe that abjection, corrosion, decay, and 
suffering underlie everything, and everything I do; culture 
attempts a bulwark against the cosmos, and culture always 
collapses into violence. I'm not only not untouchable, I'm the 
most fragile of creatures - possessing no redemption, nothing 
but a deep belief in annihilation. I'm so inconceivably selfish, 
I give things away to prove otherwise. I believe we are all 
inhabited by destruction, that we all ride the nearest 
fetishized shiny surfaces, that we all believe we're beckoned, 
that whatever is said within the ecologies of the digital, 
disappears as soon as it is spoken. I think I'm so smart. I 
thank this is enough to prove I'm so smart and to prove I'm so 
stupid as to feel any insipid thought/music/image/video of mine 
is unbearably original. I'm unbearable. I'm tone-deaf and my 
music attempts to cover that up. I can't sing a note. I can't 
write either and I'm too self-absorbed to notice that. This spew 
isn't original, even within my own work. There's so much of my 
writing that it seems to be infinitely repetitive; it's 
certainly unreadable. My thoughts are borrowed, my words are 
borrowed; what's original with me is woefully inexact. I'm bad 
at plagiarism, worse at originality. I stupidly feel if I keep 
writing, it will start making sense, that brilliance is just 
around the corner. Brilliance is the other. My body sinks into

ISIS prehistory

http://www.alansondheim.org/damnthem2.png

The Assyrians publicized their atrocities in reports and 
illustrations for propaganda purposes. In the tenth and ninth 
centuries BCE, official inscriptions told of cruelty to those 
captured. Most were killed or blinded; others were impaled on 
stakes around city walls as a warning. The bodies were 
mutilated; heads, hands, and even lower lips were cut off so 
that counting the dead would be easier. These horrifying 
illustrations, texts, and reliefs were designed to frighten the 
population into submission.

[...] When surrounding the capital city and shouting to the 
people inside failed, the Assyrians' next tactic was to select 
one or more small cities to attack, usually ones that could be 
easily conquered. Then the Assyrians committed extreme acts of 
cruelty to show how the entire region would be treated if the 
inhabitants refused to surrender peacefully. Houses were looted 
and burned to the round, and the people were murdered, raped, 
mutilated, or enslaved - acts all vividly portrayed in the 
Assyrian stone reliefs and royal inscriptions in the palaces. 
The Assyrian troops regarded looting and rape of a conquered 
city as partial compensation. [...]

The annals of Assurnasirpal II vividly described such tactics:

"In strife and conflict I besieged (and) conquered the city. I 
felled 3,000 of their fighting men with the sword. I carried off 
prisoners, possessions, oxen, (and) cattle from them. I burnt 
many captives from them. I captured many troops alive: I cut off 
of some their arms (and) hands; I cut off of others their noses, 
ears, (and) extremities. I gouged out the eyes of many troops. I 
made one pile of the living (and) one of the heads. I hung their 
heads on tress around the city. I burnt their adolescent boys 
(and) girls. I razed, destroyed, burned (and) consumed the 
city."

This type of "psychological" warfare was especially convincing, 
and the inhabitants, "overwhelmed by the fearful splendor of the 
god Assur," surrendered.

John Skelton His Ash

http://www.alansondheim.org/EVE0636.JPG

Last night a great bash
So bright and so brash
With plenty of cash
And humping would clash
Until the big crash
Then all made a dash
Like Jumpin Jack Flash
And opened a gash
Their teeth did all gnash
And they swallowed some hash
In something like mash
The punters were rash
And hung from the sash
The curtains they slash
The chandelier smash
While they buried their stash
Away they did thrash
In a pile of trash
With Skelton his ash!

QinCave: New Qin Music from the Brown University Cave

The Qing dynasty qin was played in the Brown University Cave. I 
noticed that the Cave formed a resonant chamber or sound box. 
The goose-feet (yen-tsu) rested either directly on the floor, or 
on a wooden board - in both cases transmitting the sound 
directly to the chamber floor. For the straight-forward audio 
recording, an instrument mic and vibration meter were used; the 
meter was wedged against the chamber floor and a structural 
support, and the instrument mic was placed directly underneath 
the instrument. A second mic also led to an instrument amplifier 
facing away from the chamber; its sound was recorded with the 
video camera, but didn't interfere with the straight audio, 
which was fed into a Zoom H4n. The whole chamber was 'live,' as 
were the images; the Cave wand and control glasses were worn 
either by me or Kathleen or Azure imitating the qin moves. The 
other end of the qin rested either on a board or on my leg; 
playing the instrument in a dim colored light, close to the 
floor, was difficult but not impossible. The four images show 
the arrangement under various conditions. The three audio pieces 
demonstrate the use of H4n output; the sound was raised two to 
three octaves, so that the ambiance recorded by the vibration 
meter would be audible. In some cases I chose to raise the pitch 
of the instrument mic as well; the general contours of the 
improvised pieces changed with each adjustment. When playing, I 
also made use of sounding the strings to the left of my left- 
hand stopping; this produced a non-resonant high-pitched series 
of tones which were more controllable than I thought they would 
be. The session was two and three-quarters hours, during which 
thirteen videos and audio tracks, as well as over fifty images, 
were produced. I will release these as processed over the next 
few days. I'd never heard a qin sound so resonant as it did in 
this chamber; for this reason, I thought of 'crystal' as a 
generic name for the processed audio. Since the qin mythos 
reflects the cosmos, one way or another, it was fitting to work 
with sound inhabiting the space, just as the Cave writing and 
movement did. Together they created a miniature, fragile 
cosmology which needs more exploration. Thanks to John Cayley 
for the opportunity to work in the Cave, Kathleen Ottinger for 
assisting and performing, Azure Carter for performance, video, 
audio, and song, and Stephen Dydo for restoring the qin.

The Cave wand was attached to my left wrist.
I had the opportunity to play free-rein. 
The organization is Ch'an, koan-abrupt.
My fingers danced in Heaven. My fingers 
danced above the tone pond. The microphone
howled near the dragon pool; I moved the
microphone. My hands danced in Heaven. In
Heaven, my arms danced. My shoulders 
danced. Koan abrupt, my fingers danced. 
The organization had nothing to do with
Ch'an. I don't know where Heaven is. A
koan is corrupt. I had the opportunity to
play and here something emerged. Please,
it is eight minutes, play in background.



Crystallic Mystic Qins

http://www.alansondheim.org/crystallic.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/qins6.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/qincave03.jpg

recording of the qing qin with vibration meter and mic; 
the latter had connection problems in the beginning. 
the result was raised three octaves and echo as added.
the piece is crystallic.

The two qins - Qing and 1980s - were tuned about a semitone
apart. They rest on the same table with cushioning. Last
night, a strange event: I found them perfectly in tune with
each other. I've never had this happen before. I'd  made
minor adjustments to each instrument; one or two strings
tend to slip very slightly. But this experience is unique;
it's as if the qins were talking to each other, somehow
aligning themselves. The table wasn't vibrating and there
is no possibility of resonance between them; among other
things (besides the cushioning), they're kept covered with
a cloth when not in use. I think it's the new qin that
followed in the footsteps of the older; the string buzz is
slightly greater. But why would it do this? Just to be
clear, qin tuning isn't all that simple, and the pegs
themselves don't tend to slip. I treat this as a spiritual
response to the Crystallic piece, which motivated the 
spirits of the strings to greater alignment, a clarity not
seen in these more or less rational times.
