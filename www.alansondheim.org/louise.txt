
Louise:

Your plan sounds absolutely fine. I hope that you won?t be disillusioned by
the Atlanta these days.  There has been some great progress and not so great
progress.  Anyway, I?ll be interested in what you think.



Regarding Daniel?s curatorial profile at ?Atlanta Contemporary? (as it is now
called), he says that he is curating good art?which thus far has not been from
Atlanta.  The mission has definitely changed since we were there.  Daniel
does love artists and has made a ton of studio visits.  That is good.
  Several of us have been prodding the place to reinstitute the Biennale;
just not sure there is interest.  I suggested again that you join a
curatorial team if it happens.  Regardless of who curates it, I have made it
clear how important and strategic it would be.  Susan Bridges confirmed that
the other evening when we had dinner with him.  Anyway, I can only recommend
so much before I become a pain.  That is why I didn?t mention it in the email
I sent to Daniel.

Finally, I know that Priscilla Smith, who is now at Eyedrum, and Beth Malone
of Dashboard would potentially host some public event when you?re here.

I think it would be good to have a phone conversation about all of this.
Maybe over the weekend?  404-259-0416.
