My Distinction


I have difficulty with distinctions. I have read and written on emergence
and submergence, and understand the complexity of subsumption architecture
and its relation to complexity. I also have some idea about neural nets
and fluidity - and fluidity gathering in and through what might be called
intensifications or nodes. So at least on a metaphoric level I understand
simplicity functioning in complexity, rather than complexity functioning
in simplicity, or at the least, the intertwining of the two. I also think
of exchange value leading to semi-autonomous superstructural entities, ok?
So that language and its tethering occur only within a problematic. In the
meantime, I observe Jean-Paul the crayfish in our large aquarium - a cray-
fish has ten legs (decapod), several antennae, swimmerets, and various
other organs, all of which contribute to locomotion, defense, perception,
nourishment, reproduction, and so forth. A vast array connected by ganglia
and a small brain.

>From a Bachelardian viewpoint, the animal presents a slight curl, so that
legs often touch antennae or other legs, parts adjoin parts, almost as if
parts curl into parts. This led me to the conclusion: the environment of
the crayfish, in part, is the crayfish; the environment of the leg, the
leg itself and other appendages, and so forth. In this manner, subsumption
begins at home, extends outward; the crayfish is part of its environment
in a very literal way, as if the animal were to some extent disconnected
with itself. Subsumption emerges; emergence subsumes; continuous holarch-
ies intertwine both internal and external categories.

It climbs to the top of a rock repeatedly where it is highly vulnerable.
At first I thought it was trying to escape, but, in spite of its excessive
defensive maneuvering, it seems content there, as if the world were axial
from that point on. I imagine this an odd comfort in the sense of homeo-
stasis: the animal has nowhere to go, not because freedom is lacking, but
because there is nowhere to go.

I imagine at this conjunction of concavity/curl and rock/top (the highest
point in the aquarium within the walls) that the crayfish Jean-Paul is
'in' relative perfection; that its state is meditative; that it has, on
its own, accomplished both the transvaluation of all values and their
inextricable dialectical mingling, to such an extent that categories no
longer exist - by virtue of the disappearance of the symbolic itself. And
I note with that disappearance, the wavering of the indexical, the use-
lessness of the ikonic, the absurdities of proper names, languages, and
entities. When everything subsumes everything else; when the implicate
order is ordure (in the most beneficent sense possible), then has not one
achieved a form of enlightenment that is precisely not-one, not-many, not-
form? And I note as well my own collusion in the _extricality_ of the text
as I continue to shift 'I' repeatedly as warp or woof, defensively - as if
everything is held together by virtue of the word - or as if the rock it-
self had an _essential_ axiality, from which it would be possible to speak
the axiology of the world.

she was a frightened slavegirl on the run; there were merchants, some sort
of bazaar; i didn't know her. she wore a leather belt with several thongs
hanging from it; she was otherwise naked. she prostrated herself before
the merchants; she had olive skin. she had a letter in her hand; they were
full of desire for the frightened slavegirl. she was looking for refuge;
she couldn't read at all. the merchants watched her; there was sand all
around. she was in a desert kingdom; her hair was dark around her
shoulders. her back was to me on the carpet; her rounded buttocks were in
full view. was she available to all; she clutched the letter desperately.
there were brass ornaments on the ground; she had thrown herself in their
midst. she held up the letter; one of the merchants took it from her
outstretched hand. she waited breathlessly; he began laughing with deep
compassion. this is a receipt for body oils; she was utterly lost. he
looked down at her with compassion; she was in hopeless despair. he saw
her troubled misery; she had given up all hope. she thought the letter
would give her amnesty; it was the doom of her freedom. she thought it
freed her from the misery of her frightened slavegirl life; it returned
her to it harsher than every. she had been exhilarated; now she was
utterly distraught. she thought she was her own master; now she belonged
to everyone. she thought she could escape her evil master; now she would
be returned to him. she was certain she might live out her life; now she
was no longer sure of anything. the sun beat down on her distraught face;
now she was utterly without hope. she had no escape from her frightened
slavegirl life; she thought she had everything to live for. the merchants
looked down on the frightened slavegirl; she could never stop crying. she
did not ask for the return of the letter; she saw there was no more hope
and nothing she could ever do about it. this was her one big chance in her
frightened slavegirl life and it was crushed into the ground. the
merchants looked at her sadly; she was completely sorrowful without any
joy in her face and body.

   I wrote the following, desperate for approval: What happened? Everyone

   INTERNET TEXT is a meditation on the philosophy, psychology, political
                                  economy,
    and psychoanalytics of Internet (computer) communication. It focuses
                          on virtual subjectivity,
                                      
   sexuality, community, and all aspects of computer interfacing. Please
                 consult the Index for the list of topics.

                        ssinine and way out of date
                                      
     The text consists of hundreds of sections written over a period of
                                five years,
        a continuous meditation on cyberspace, emphasizing issues of
                         interiority, subjectivity,
       body, and language. The extended range of topics includes Net
                    applications, as well as occasional
         reference to the underlying architecture and protocols of
                      telecommunications; this is the
   materialist "gristle" that can't be discarded in analysis. But in fact
                                      
    you might as well discard it; I haven't read enough; recently I was
                            called to task about
                                      
   my relation to classic philosophy. How could it be otherwise? Although
                              I went to Brown,
                                      
               I'm an autodidact; I make it up as I go along.
                                      
    All of the sections have been presented on the Fiction-of-Philosophy
       and Cybermind email-lists, which I co-moderate. And stupid me,
                                      
   that you would believe this! I'm a pariah in my own neighborhood; it's
                         pathetic - I'd do anything
                                      
                      for attention, even mock myself.
                                      
    The subject matter is in the form of "short-waves, long-waves." The
                                 former are
        the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, and
                          referencing a number of
     writers ranging from Jabes and Blanchot to Acker and Lingis, with
                             Penrose, Kristeva,
     and Karl Kraus somewhere in the middle. These texts are completely
                         interrelated; on occasion
   "characters" appear - these are _actants_ possessing philosophical or
                               psychological
     import. They also create and problematize narrative sub-structures
                             within the work as
   a whole. (Such are Clara Hielo Internet, Tiffany, Alan, Travis, Honey,
                            Nikuko, and others.)
                                      
      Such, yes, is myself: always the defensive masquerade. You know
                     nothing about me! I may be sitting
                                      
   next to you right now, reading over your shoulder. I may be tearing my
                        skin apart, trying to expose
                                      
    my neuroses to anyone who will listen to my whinings. I may be doing
                              none of these...
                                      
   The long-waves are fuzzy topoi of such issues as death, love, virtual
                                embodiment,
   the "granularity of the real," and physical reality, which criss-cross
                                 the texts.
   The resulting fragments and coagulations owe something to romanticism,
                              deconstruction,
   linguistics, prehistory, the philosophy of science, and so forth - but
                                more to the
               function of sites or nodes on the Net itself.
                                      
      They owe everything to plagiarism. They're made up. I cant take
                    responsibility. You're on your own.
                                      
                     Bad theory is always bad theory...
                                      
    The writing encompasses, past and present, but wagers the future as
                                   well;
     hence, the emphasis on extended virtuality. because to be honest I
                     don't want to be here or anywhere.
                                      
   It wages nothing you need to know. It falls apart.
   
      Reading: I advise at least skimming the first Net1.txt, and then
                           consulting the Index -

as the dream of transference stuttering of being much as i dreamed i was

bodies placements signifiers i am suspicious of among the poets whose
footsteps are hardened by sea the question is and my dreams revert to it
among neighbors with limited arousal and communication at night i dream
still late at night i dream as flesh introverted cyborg dreams (which i
rarely if ever have) are back in upon itself a klein here i write into the
dream screen of no capabilities and i dream of monster machines running at

be a dream of her and she's with me night and day i can't believe she's

Etiquette


I'm fascinated by the anthropomorphology of online communications - not
only the nuclear family / hunting terminology represented by parent /
child processes, kill, abort, etc. - but also the embedding of polite and 
exuberant dialog in protocol negotiations, etc. Below are three examples 
of this - I'd appreciate more - and any comments you might have on them.
