The Book of the Word of Philosophy

http://www.alansondheim.org/wordofphilosophy.jpg

The word of philosophy presupposes it isn't uttered on the 
streets of Aleppo, under inordinate duress, by those near death, 
by victims of unspeakable acts; the word of philosophy 
presupposed the clarity and coherence of the well-functioning 
academy, of filters bringing those outside, within, of those 
within, enclaved, of the enclaves, exclusionary with the 
illusion of transparency and inclusivity, exclusionary with the 
surgical removal of the other, exclusionary with the differend, 
exclusionary within the hardly-recognizable superstructure of 
those who define themselves as the thinking or meditative class; 
the word of philosophy presupposes the architecture of clarity 
as well, the authority of proper equalization or the shout of 
the street brought within; the clean and proper footnoting of 
the clean and proper bibliography of the clean and proper 
archival procedures of the clean and proper cleansing class 
supported by these adjuncts to thinking and the thinking class; 
all that is entangled as such is tethered in the fragile 
solidity of air, conference, salary, health and healthcare; the 
word of philosophy presupposes everything and nothing, is leaky, 
coruscated, scabbed, troubling, insomniac; 

and in the pieces below, and others, I learn from the brilliance 
of others, I collaborate - and the word of philosophy is 
embodied and embedded, the word of philosophy is no longer 
lecture/lectern or stamina, is among itself, among its ghosts, 
the ghosts of Aleppo for example, ghosts of holocausts 
everywhere singing the praises of philosophy, the choir and 
chorus of philosophy -

and the word of philosophy is another word, a word from silence, 
from the metaphor of the heart and mind, of the organism - I 
claim further _this_ is the word of philosophy, were philosophy 
to speak -

were philosophy no longer to be spoken _for-

I understand that sublimation is the process of repressing the 
"baser" instincts i.e. the libido in favor of structure and 
cultural production of some kind, but it also seems as if the 
same processes and products are in play in the attempt to reach 
the highest point of metaphysical ineffability and failing; the 
music, art, high-level philosophical/mathematical thinking that 
results is the by-product of aiming *beyond* the point of 
articulability rather than having its origins in the realm 
*below* it. Of course these are the two sides of the same coin 
of, say, addiction.

Thus the _word_ of philosophy is its _doing and undoing_ within 
the world - like the rest of us - nothing more or less - resting
