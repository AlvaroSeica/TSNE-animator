I'm chucking values this evening.
The first to go is the transvaluation of all values.
This just won't do and besides makes a mess of some of the little ones!
You can get the best values for your money if you chuck the old ones!
There are always rooms for new values emptied of old ones chucked!
A chucked value is valueless even if it is a transvaluation.
No, wait! A chucked transvaluation is worth a lot of the little ones.
The little ones gather in a group as if they were capable of speech.
My values are my clothes! I chuck them and dress in transvaluations.
Everyone knows me here and understands I do this daily.
What others call contrary behavior I call value-chucking.
What others consider contradictory I find falls apart.
The contradictory falls apart because one thing follows another.
There are never simultaneous things in my world of transvaluations.
If there were, I could chuck them simultaneously.
Everyone knows I try to do this just about all the time.
I'm hated in some circles as a result, but that's just another value.
I chuck those values in each and every direction.
That's part of my transvaluation which does the chucking for me.
No value-chucking for my transvaluation! It will have to go!

The messages come from these keystrokes; I can see and hear them. All you

I couldn't think of a better topic since the hangman disappeared. Here I
am writing you at midnight! It's as if everyone stopped breathing just for
a moment. I know I did!
218:413) Julu            01:10:00:00:05
Hey Jennifer, I didn't know you were on! I feel that the air's cleared
around here. If I hear the word "ballet" I'm going to throw up! Enough
already! It was a stupid conceit!
218:414) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:10
Yeah, a conceit - that's exactly what it was. A trope or lever to explain
just about everything in the world. As if you could squeeze blood out of a
stone. Nothing is farther from the truth.
218:415) Julu            01:10:00:00:12
Exactly - but truth is simultaneously centrifugal and decentered. It's the
lack of the eye, all that perspectival machinery. We're just coming to
grips with it.
218:416) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:15
Just like those pirouettes, as if there were a body at the center of them.
Her skirt kept flying up, and there was nothing there. An avatar, or woman
of Lacan. In masquerade, burdened by the lack, shattered.
218:417) Julu            01:10:00:00:18
Well, there's no more to it, and his writing avatar discourse itself is
getting stale. He's taken you and I around the bend, and meanwhile there
is e-commerce to think about, all that corporate supernumerary exchange. 
It doesn't appear anywhere in his work; he's completely ignored the poli-
tical economy of the Internet.
218:418) Julu            01:10:00:00:21
He's placed bodies in the way. The Net's about "streaming video, it's
about streaming music," and he's back there with a vision or version of
flesh and disappearance. He doesn't realize even the imaginary is disa-
ppearing - everything replaced by the monetary clot.
218:419) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:24
That gets back to his theory of the self as a coagulation - now the imag-
inary itself is a coagulation, running between flesh and machine, swollen
with flickering and competitive protocols. There are no rooms left for the
avatars, and even human speech is always already stolen speech - from
selves, machines, corporate entities which are themselves streaming.
218:420) Julu            01:10:00:00:29
Do you mean our days are numbered?
218:421) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:30
At least our conversations are.

One day Nikuko was walking by the banks of a raging river. She was reading
the Diamond Sutra, and stepped dangerously near the shoreline. A passing
monk came up to her and said, Please be careful, or you will drown. Nikuko
said, The Diamond Sutra will save me. The monk said, The Diamond Sutra has
never saved anyone. He grabbed the scroll from her and threw it in the
river. Nikuko, furious, jumped in after it, and with much difficulty
brought it back to shore. The monk said, On the other hand, everyone saves
the Diamond Sutra.

There once was a lion who terrorized the villages of southern Kyushu.
Nikuko was walking near Kirishimayama one day, hoping for enlightenment.
The more she hoped, the farther she walked, and the farther she walked,
the more hopeless her condition. Mired in emotion, she vanquished the lion
in a dreamlike state from which she never recovered. Now enlightened, she
continued her terrorization of the villages, plundering, raping, and mur-
dering, without cause, with great effect. She knew there were no lions.

It was Hokkaido's darkest winter in a long time. Outside, the ground was
frozen. Nikuko sat by a fire inside the thatched hut; covered with skins,
she chanted Amida, slowly drinking tea. Her eyes were half open, her child
asleep in the corner. The wind howled; the flickering flames made eerie
patterns on the wall. But there was something else in the wind and the
snow, something not quite right with the night. Something was shuffling
around the hut, and, if she tried, she heard great wings beating. She was
certain it was a tengu, come to disturb her meditation. Nikuko felt a
great sleep come over her, her body covered by wings, not skins. She woke
in the early dawn; there were wings everywhere upon her, her muscles thick
within them. Nikuko moved the wings in great swatches; they beat in all
directions, and she remained immobilized. Her child had vanished. She
could no longer chant, could no longer speak. She huddled there, the fire
cold, beating her wings, again and again. The walls of the hut were over-
come, her soul was overcome. She continued beating. She beat the air into
clouds, beat the winter sun back in the sky. The day dawned warmer and
warmer; Nikuko, exhausted, fell back down into a deep sleep, enlightened,
as winter returned to the land.

Why dogs don't have horns. In bygone days, male dogs had horns centered in
their high and bony foreheads. The horns were symbols of their prowess,
and many a villager was kept awake at night by ferocious fighting - the
horns clattering against each other. One day Nikuko was wending her way
from the hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being, she allowed her mind
to drift. Suddenly, a ferret crossed the road in front of her. In a split
second, Nikuko and the ferret changed places, Nikuko now running low upon
the ground, working the roads as cross-walks, heading in and out of the
deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough, a dog approached, its horn hard
against the sky. Nikuko was sweating and naked, her skin scratched by
brambles, her breath hot and heavy from running. The dog lowered its head,
Nikuko exchanged places with the horn. The horn fell useless to the ground
and disappeared forever; Nikuko, astride the dog, changed places with a
bee, a bird, a plant, a butterfly, and a ferret, in just that very order.
Now cooled by the shadows of dusk among the bamboo, she continued on her
way. A monk passed by, laughing, and asked, Nikuko, after all this play,
are you any the wiser? Nikuko replied, not in the slightest, Izanagi, not
the least little bit.

Before there was the word, there was no beginning. Nikuko tried to think.
She couldn't think. She didn't have time to think, and she itched. Nikuko
scratched herself and flakes of skin fell into the water. They became
Japan. Nikuko, thought, I will take a swim. Nikuko said, I am swimming,
and her mouth filled with water. She spat it out and it became Lake Biwa.
Did I just say something, said Nikuko. She thought, now I can say all
sorts of things. Just as she thought that, all sorts of things appeared.
They were grey until she said, What a colorful life. They were dark until
she said, I wish it were sunny out. They were hot until she said, I wonder
when it will snow, and they were too shiny until she said Good night.

Another day Nikuko was walking on the long path from Sata towards the
mountains; the day was overcast and uncomfortably cool. She passed several
fishermen on the way, their nets heavy, their faces weathered, searching
the clouds. The sun was shiny metal in the grey sky; there were mists
about. Someone was walking towards her from the distance, as if in a
dream. Nikuko recalled later that the woman looked like a stranger, then
familiar, then a friend. It was Nikuko walking from the mountains, heading
towards Sata. It's not surprising that I met myself on the road, Nikuko
later said to Izanagi, but it was surprising that I would ever want to
return to Sata, after all.

Izanagi and Nikuko came upon a corpse lying by the side of the road. They
were on the way back from Kagoshima; it was the middle of the night, but
the moon illuminated the landscape. Look, said Izanagi, something is
moving. Sure enough, a thin shadow flitted across the body, which was that
of a young samurai. He is not yet reborn, said Nikuko, and is moving
quickly through rebirth after rebirth; he continues to commit seppuku,
waiting for the proper body. He is bound to the wheel, Izanagi replied;
see how the body freshens every so often, as he almost returns to this
life. With that, Izanagi took his sword and severed the head with one
blow. He'll have to go somewhere else now, said Izanagi, turning around,
but Nikuko was nowhere to be seen.

This is a story that has been told many times, but is well worth the re-
telling. One day Izanagi and Nikuko, for it is true that they traveled
together, were passing by a ridge in the vicinity of Dazaifu. The way was
steep, and suddenly, a white fox bounded across the path in front of them,
disappearing into the bamboo forest. Izanagi said, This must be an omen;
let us keep our eyes open for further adventures. Nikuko remained silent
and thoughtful as they continued on their way. All at once, the forest
grew darker, the birds stopped their singing, and the strips of sunlight
disappeared from the tall stems. Another omen, Izanagi said, and Nikuko
remained silent. A little further on, they came to a stone peculiarly
carved in the shape of a tortoise (Why, at this height, said Izanagi), and
beyond that, they saw a small stream reverse its course, wending its way
uphill. Izanagi spoke again, asking Nikuko, All these omens, what do they
signify. Nikuko replied, These omens announce one another, like the cycle
of births and rebirths; they signify nothing but each other, the eternal
wheeling of worlds. They continued along the path, passing two unicorns
fighting, a woman playing a ch'in in a most mournful manner, golden birds,
and dragons coursing through the air, as they made their way to the
summit.

A well-made shakuhachi is created from root bamboo, worked on for weeks
and months, lacquered inside, a hardwood insert in the mouthpiece. When
Nikuko plays the shakuhachi, whole worlds appear within the moist interior
air between the five finger-holes. Bacteria thrive, stationary waves hold
colonies of protozoa in perfect suspension. After the shakuhachi is
swabbed, smaller life-forms cling to the lacquer, and for hours or days,
cultures appear and disappear. One evening, while Nikuko played beneath
her basket, two robbers approached her. Her shakuhachi was made from a
single piece of bamboo without any joints, and, with the old narrow bore
and wide stem, it was a strong instrument. Nikuko, swinging it this way
and that, defeated them without missing a note. There are many silences in
shakuhachi music, and life-within, life-without, each contains histories
full of pathos, sweetness, violence and despair, lives clinging to the
sounds, suspended.

Nikuko invented the syllabic script; Izanagi threw it away. Nikuko inven-
ted the wheel; Izanagi rolled it out of site. Nikuko gave fire to humans;
Izanagi stole the flames. Nikuko invented clothing; Izanagi tore it into
shreds. Then Nikuko invented all the kanji, a myriad of signs; Izanagi was
overwhelmed. What can I do with them, he said, There are so many, they
will prove useless to men. But men read and reread the kanji, memorizing
each and every one, and out of the shapes of the signs arose the wheel,
fire, and clothing. Only the syllabic script remained behind, nurtured in
the lives of women, always a chance, in this or any other worlds, of sub-
verting, replacing, the kanji. Thus was hiragana born, as a reminder that
invention and memory can reside, not only in the signs themselves, but
also in the spaces between them.

How the snail got its shell. Nikuko pared her toenails, and a slug, ever-
fearful of death, crawled into one of the cuttings. Why the bamboo grows
so straight. Of all the plants, the bamboo first avoided the cycles of
rebirth by least inhabiting the world. Nikuko rewarded it by allowing it
grow the fastest towards the heavens (i.e. a straight line is the shortest
distance between two points). Why water flows downhill. Nikuko made the
reflection of water one of the three gifts, in the form of a mirror. In
order to reflect, water had to fill the land (i.e. flow downhill into
hollows). How the torii originated. Nikuko instructed a prince to build a
bridge that went everywhere and nowhere at once. Why birds fly. Nikuko
needed messengers to Izanagi. Why men are taller than women. One day Niku-
ko was asked what the greatest blessing would be. To see beneath the surf-
ace of things, she replied. Why there are births and rebirths. Once Nikuko
fell asleep, tired from the creation of beings and souls. She said to Iza-
nagi, perhaps there are too many, or perhaps there are still not enough.
Izanagi replied, let them find out for themselves. Why bees make honey. In
order to chant the Amidah in the winter. Why men fight. One day Izanagi
said to Nikuko, there are too many of them, and they take too long to die.
Why flowers open in the summer. To hear the bees chant Amidah. Why the
shamisen took so long to enter the floating world. It took that long to
steal three strands of hair from Nikuko for the strings; that is why the
shamisen plays music no one can resist (i.e. the strings tie up the man in
knots).

One day Nikuko left Wa to see the worlds she had created. She traveled
through Afghanistan and the outskirts of the Roman Empire, coming at last
to Palestine. Here she walked towards the Galil, having heard of a new
prophet, as prominent as Izanagi. She was disappointed; his voice was thin
and his message all too familiar; he also spoke of a poverty of gods. One
day she rose in the morning to the sound of weeping; it was the prophet,
Jesus, forlorn and weeping. I will lose my followers, he said to Nikuko, I
have prayed over and over again for a miracle, and none is forthcoming.
Nikuko said, I can help you; the trouble is that men can walk on water,
and there is nothing to be done here. With that, she created drowning and
forgetfulness; men no longer remembered the flowing of streams and rivers
beneath their feet. When the prophet walked on water, it was he alone who
did so; the rest, by diminution, worshiped him as the miraculous son of
God.

Nikuko was resting at Dazaifu. Izanagi said, Nikuko, how many kami, beyond
the eight or eighty million. There were kami everywhere, pouring from the
stones, from the blades of grass, from the hills. There were kami gathered
in the shrines, shadows swimming without a ripple, beneath the surface of
the ponds. Nikuko replied, Sometimes it's not even me who's speaking,
they're swarming within me, sometimes one or another speaks, their words
escape me and new shrines are built, one even even made a world so fragile
it destroyed itself. Izanagi replied, And I, Nikuko, what is within me.
Nikuko replied, The blades of grass, the hills and pools here, worlds of
inconceivable fragility. Suddenly Izanagi split open and the same world
emerged and settled down, with Izanagi in it. This is the 'Enlightenment
of Izanagi.'

Nikuko and Izanagi were at Kirishimayama, walking among the mountain

replied, It does not matter, there are none about how the Leopard got his
spots. Are there no female Leopards, asked Izanagi. Yes, replied Nikuko,
but the blemish clothed the male. Izanagi said, But who will write your
parables? Nikuko said, There are not enough things in the world for
parables. What would you have, Izanagi asked. More explanations, replied
Nikuko, as if causes had effects, and effects had causes. So parables lie,
said Izanagi, since they imply causes and effects tied together, as men
and women are tied in procreation. Exactly, replied Nikuko, the binding of
parables makes causes and effects, and out of these men and women thrive,
and make culture. What they do then, asked Izanagi? Forget both of us
after a while, replied Nikuko; and they continued on their way.

Izanagi and Nikuko walked through National Park Kirishima. It was a sunny

for a refreshing drink, said Izanagi. Certainly, said Nikuko. They paid
500 yen each, which seemed reasonable. It is good to have a park at the
base of Yamato, where this world began and gods descended and ascended,
said Izanagi. Nikuko replied, It is even better that the base rotates and
wobbles with the rest of the planet, sweeping the heavens above and the
oceans below. Yes, replied Izanagi, we never know where our ascent will
take us, but Yamato is friendly and grateful, and a good place to sit.
Don't spill your drink, said Nikuko, this world has gravity.

What would happen if I were blind, Nikuko asked Izanagi. You can see per-
fectly, replied Izanagi. Of course I can, said Nikuko. And I have all my
other senses as well. Do you think the gods have more senses than humans,
asked Izanagi. Do you think we are gods, asked Nikuko. Humans have five
senses, said Izanagi, and they are smell, taste, sight, hearing, and touch
in that order. Why in that order, asked Nikuko. Because they must smell
what they taste, although they are afraid of it, and what it might say to
move them, answered Izanagi. We have eight senses, said Nikuko, because we
can determine hot from cold, tall from short, high from deep, truth from
falsehood, and soft from hard. That makes ten senses, said Izanagi, Ah,
said Nikuko, but do we truly taste what we smell, are not both the most
intimate form of touch for us? And as for blindness, added Nikuko, for me,
sight is the least important sense of all; I walk and speak with eyes
closed, talk without looking at my neighbor, and listen to the world in
the silence of the night. Sight is overrated, said Izanagi; I haven't seen
for years. Perhaps there's nothing to look at, replied Nikuko.

what we watched


they're dark, flooded, also naked as in the fumbling movement of bodies
around or crossing, a kind of flesh against a night-time planet. azure
said they should be seen in blackness. i'd imagine the dance and videos
continuing in a space for hours.

it would be interesting to work for hours in the space, until everything
exhausts itself, everyone is exhausted.

until there is a speaking in the space, or murmuring, of dancers and doc-
tors and a variety of centuries. 

something rolling, roiling about the work, intense movement. sometimes i
think of azure and i naked for a week or a month, stumbling around equip-
ment always on, processing.

pitch-black, the audience moving from station to station, or a space like
a slab or monolith, i see the ghost from azure's makeup, the corpse of
dancing, memories of faces, bodies.

retrieving bodies for ecstasy that lasts forever.

darkness, the fragility of the retrieving. the labor (again, labor) in-
volved in the recuperating. images hardening into simulacra of performers.

what comes across the media and what's direct, in the space, a presence.
what is carried by beams of light, what's carried by scent.

spaces of the corners or creases of bodies, convulsive bodies, bodies
crossing savanna, grasping at straws, branches, climbing. the clambering
of bodies.

something of the nature of the dream, what begins to dissolve the real, a
huddling in the matrix, something about origins in them. as in the para-
bles, origins present by virtue of image or imaginary, then spoken or
speaking, sight the least of it.

the tension of movement which creates things or the tension of movement
during the creation of things.

exhaustion, as if waking from dreaming to work. returning to dream, or
rather, dreams which cut like stone into or from the real, a form of
hardness.

submergence, what comes out, is visible, in blackness, the midst of it,
what is seen as veneer, or by light, veering from the edges of movements,
or lips.

from origin to origin, among origins.

One day Izanagi and Nikuko were walking in the vicinity of Nara. They
passed a market full of merchants from Honshu and Silla, busy with their
wares. The clattering of soroban filled the air. When we count, said
Nikuko, we use our fingers up to twelve. And after twelve, asked Izanagi.
We count by by shells to one-hundred-twenty, Nikuko replied. Thereafter to
five-hundred-forty, we consider bamboo stalks, and after that, to roughly
two-thousand, we use rice-plants, that their yield may be great. Izanagi
asked again, and after two-thousand. There are lacquer boxes to four-thou-
sand-three-hundred, Nikuko said, and after that, scrolls to ten-thousand,
that we may properly observe the rites and rituals. After that, there is
only the counting by numbers and words, that goes nowhere, and means noth-
ing. There is a certain truth in that, said Izanagi. There are a number of
bamboo stalks in them, replied Nikuko.

What did you do with the atoms, asked Nikuko, as they left Nara, heading
south. Bad mistake, said Izanagi, there was a loophole, they'll destroy
themselves. Not again, replied Nikuko, we should readjust the cycles of
worlds; let them be born elsewhere, keeping the balance. Where do you
imagine, said Izanagi, adding, perhaps in another universe altogether.
Nikuko replied, Excellent, and if we leave gravity behind, they could just
float around if the atoms misbehave. Atoms, said Izanagi, this time I want
nothing but fluids; we could have two elements and a whole lot of informa-
tion. About what, said Nikuko. About where everybody's been before, and
where they'll be going, replied Izanagi. Then they might stay put, said
Nikuko. No, said Izanagi, they'll come back, they always miss the little
things in life.

Nikuko and Izanagi were walking near Lake Biwa. They were discussing the
parables of Nikuko, which were also the parables of Izanagi. He said,
They'll be known by your name, The Parables of Nikuko. She replied, Noth-
ing in this world exists outside of the sign, or everything exists outside
of the sign. If nothing exists outside, these parables will remain forever
in human memory, but if everything exists outside, these parables will
already have been forgotten. That is indeed a sentence, said Izanagi, or a
sentencing. It is only two, said Nikuko, and that is already two too many.
They continued walking around the shore.

Nikuko was wending her solitary way back to Dazaifu; she was tired, and
the path was wet from the recent rains. She came across an old man hobbl-
ing along; he moved slowly, his face twisted with age. Suddenly she felt
herself in the presence of an enlightened being. She asked him who he was,
and discovered he was mute (i.e. he did not reply, either because he could
not speak, or because he could not hear, or because he desired silence
above all else). It was then that she realized he had most likely lost his
mind, slowly withdrawing from the world by virtue of incapacity, which he
had turned to good purpose by focusing on the perfection and evanescence
of all things. She continued on her way, thinking that the emptier the
mind, the greater the flow; by the side of the road, a granite boulder
murmured Aum, and she was enlightened.

Izanagi and Nikuko were walking south, passing by Udo-Jingu. They were
lost in tought. Then Nikuko asked Izanagi, What, in this world, are you
doing (i.e. in general). He replied, I am creating mirrors and mirrorings,
moorings slipped from moorings, anchors from anchors, anchorages from
anchorages. Nikuko said, Please, explain. Izanagi said, What may be
launched and held in place, is released and brought to port; what is
deemed to be the truth held in a mirror, is the mirror dropped on the path
we are taking. The two of them were silent for a while. Then Izanagi said
to Nikuko, And you, Nikuko, what are you doing? She replied, I am slipping
from mirrors and mirrorings, creating moorings and anchors and anchorages;
indeed, there are so many that one may sail and not yet sail, may see and
not yet see. Izanagi said, Please, explain. Nikuko said, I have picked the

everything seemed so fresh and new. The woman replied, Why must we always
remember; it hurts so, to have something so close, yet out of touch for-

Nikuko and Izanagi were walking down from Aso-san near the Sanjo shrine,
when they came to a gate in the road. It was of unusual construction,
tall, almost like a torii. It was hinged and barred with an image of the
sun in the center. Sun or moon, what's the difference, said Nikuko, this
is a machine for capturing goryo, spirits of the dead; they cycle in and
out of this world, flickering between the sun and moon. How does it work,
asked Izanagi. Nikuko replied, They mistake the sign for the thing itself
- they expect space, but are confronted with iron. They walked around the
gate, and continued down the steep road, the volcano fuming behind them.

*i.e. the kanji for ma, space, is a gate with a sun in the center; previ-
ously, a moon would do as well.

This occurred near Ise, precisely during the rebuilding of the shrine.
Nikuko and Izanagi were walking as usual. They approached an old man with
a huge and comical hat, wide-brimmed, of a peculiar shape. Now what, said
Izanagi, smiling. Nikuko noted that the brim was very wide indeed, and the
flap on the left held the Minister of the Right, while the flap on the
right seemed to contain the Minister of the Left. Poor and deluded, said
Izanagi. The old man looked up, and tilted his head slightly to the left.
Whole trees fell down on the slopes and the ground rumbled beneath them.
Then he looked at Izanagi, and tilted his head to the right. The mountain
roared and great boulders crashed on the path all around them. Without
saying a word, the old man slowly continued on his way. This time, it was
Nikuko who was laughing, staring at the hat disappearing in the distance.
He's on the brim, she laughed, he's on the brim.

Mathesis (halfgroupoid with a corrupted unit element)

Let us define a mathematical structure with a set A of elements, an
operation on the set such that, for some a,b,c of A we have ab = c.
Let us also define an identity element e, such that ae = ea = a,
and ee = e. But let us also define e such that eee = e*, and eeea =
a*, where * is indeterminacy such that a* not= a and e* not= e. (We
can define similar structures with any length of concatenation, i.e.
eeeee.) Then the structure is non-associative, for otherwise one can
write eeea = ee(ea) = ea; it is also non-symmetric, since otherwise
ee(ea) = eeae = eae. e is only partially reflexive, since ee = e.
Note that this structure embeds the notion of process in any equa-
tion, since an accumulation of identity elements transforms the re-
sulting equation. What is produced can be constructed by steps - 
for example ea = a = ea = a = eea = a and so forth - each term cal-
culated in order. Note the relationship of this to the halfgroupoid
with a unit element, but it is a "corrupted" structure as such, and
overall an indeterminate structure. Phenomenologically, it repre-
sents an economy of means and perception for structures in the real
world of everyday life; this is even more so if the rule for e is
generalized, such that, for any element x, xxx not= x(xx) or (xx)x.
Thus "building" x by xx = y, xy = z is not= xxx = z*. What of all
of this? Creating a mathematical structure with a potential error
built-in, for example, one operation eee = e* throwing everything
off - then salvaging by prohibition. Isn't this in fact the way of
every testament, making a fence around the Torah, for example, in 
order to keep in bounds what is holy, what is profane, what is the
pathway of desire? Too much accumulation produces nonsense; proceed
by rite, carefully, and all will come out exact in the end.

Izanagi and Nikuko were crossing the famed Kintai bridge at Iwakuni. It

Nikuko, have you ever lain in someone's arms, delirious with desire, all
day and night, unable to sleep or eat. Nikuko was silent. Izanagi con-
tinued, In such states it is impossible to think; enlightenment seems a
long way off. Nikuko was silent. Izanagi continued, Time seems to come
to a halt, space collapses. Nikuko said, Once. Izanagi said, One lives 
in a half-dream, half-alive state. Nikuko said, Once I was like that, in
the midst of making worlds; it was a mistake to create like that. Izanagi
asked, What happened. Nikuko said, I made this world and its humans; that
is why they are so much out of control, contaminated by the small spit
that remains from their creation. Izanagi said, That is the way of fet-
tered ghosts, half-covered in soot, half walking through mountains. They
use electricity nowadays, said Nikuko, and the mountains disappear. We
should have thought of that earlier, replied Izanagi. They continued on

The games that are played here, said Nikuko, the great shooting matches.
And the counter of arrows, asked Izanagi. He is of no account, he has no
bow, and this is his fair livelihood, said Nikuko. Ah, said Izanagi, let
us do something for him, in order that the hall remain intact (i.e. the
arrows were eating away at the beams). Nikuko replied, let him die, reborn
a poet in another life. At that point in 1580, the counter of arrows fell

mountain-stream. Then everything was normal, just as it had been, except
for the yamabushi, who disappeared in turn. It's either the yamabushi or
everything, said Nikuko, one or the other, never both at once. Izanagi
replied, The yamabushi was Death, who has no viewpoint; we move among
worlds, our focus is tiny. At that moment Nikuko was enlightened; looking

Izanagi and Nikuko created many worlds. They were walking near Hakata,
where the Hakozaki shrine descended to the sea; there were several torii

shore, as if searching for land. It flew repeatedly between the pillars of
the torii, and seemed exhausted. Nikuko said, Look, it sees no land, even
though it is of the land, and a hard thing, made of the land. The bird
continued circling, growing weaker, and then headed out to sea. Izanagi
replied, It is breaking away, thinking of water, it doesn't realize that
water is nothing at all, taking the shape of the land. He added, The bird
sees its reflection in the state of the water, just as everyone does. What
is water, then, asked Nikuko. Izanagi answered, It is surely the form of
all things, before worlds, it came to be their form, following equally the
lay of mountains and valleys, and the flight of birds. No one can tell the
future, replied Nikuko. At that moment, a disturbance swept across the
face of the water, and a sound was heard, the beating of invisible wings.

sense of the interference of Fri Feb 4 14:35:09 EST 2000 the real. Process
transformed into entities by virtue of the Fri Feb 4 14:35:09 EST 2000
proper name; having ascertained this, the machine began: "somewhere, mov-g
beyond this or the other, story, _what happened,_ - moving constantly Fri

fault of the _proper Fri Feb 4 14:35:09 EST 2000 the story was made from

Report from the Conference

A discussion on the interference of language in the real, the violence of
proper names, the encoding of process, interval, space, and parable:

Proper names, through contour-enhancement in the broadest sense possible,
constituting entities from flux; it is this constitution that is the core
of narrative, its origin. Language is the embodiment of narrative; as such
it already constructs culture at the cost of the real. To say the uncon-
scious is proto-linguistic is to say that occurrences are recognized and
transformed into resistances. The noise of the world is translated into
the parasitic; the parasitic, as a third element, modifies or forecloses a
chain of events. Such chains are already a defense against this noise;
language is homeostatic, defending itself. The world becomes known through
its masquerade. 

Proper names are occurrences, uncanny in their relationship to the real;
generic nouns are happenings, imaginary in their relationship. The former
implies a logic of iconicity; the latter, indexicality. Consider the pro-
per name an actant, foregrounded - the generic noun, as environment, back-
grounded. There are dual logics of impediments and flows; these are fuzzy,
occupying the two poles of thresholding logics. Generic nouns emerge out 
of non-distributivity, gestural logics; they appear as an encoding of en-
hancements, just as proper nouns imply a decoding of language, a rupture
of strata. Narrative is a succession of encodings and decodings; the power
of narrative, its semantics, comes from the surplus of the latter, and the
syntactical aspect, from the restrained economy of the former.  

Thus within and without the world, language, the real, and narrative are
inextricably entwined, to the extent that any and all are thought; it is
through the gaps of language that the real emerges with the idiocy of
truth.

Intervals


What is the Interval at the outskirts of the Sector (which does not recog-
nize It, since there are no outskirts) but the remains of part-objects,
broken symbols, at the edge of discourse, just beyond any subjectivity?
Think of this as a world of couplings, operations such that if a coupling
C = abcde & a -> a' then C = a'bcde and not L = (abcde)' - a linkage. In a
coupling, every element is independent, only bracketed by concatenation or
contingency. (Whhy iy yhh Iqyhyyhq hy yhh qyyyqiyyy qh yhh Shhyqy (yhihh
hqhy qqy yhhqhqiah Iy, yiqhh yhhyh hyh qq qyyyqiyyy) hyy yhh yhqhiqy qh
qhyy-qhqhhyy, hyqqhq yyqhqqy, hy yhh hhhh qh hiyhqyyyh, qyyy hhyqqh hqy
yyhqhhyiyiyy? Thiqq qh yhiy hy h yqyqh qh hqyqqiqhy, qqhyhyiqqy yyhh yhhy
ih h hqyqqiqh C = hhhhh & h -> h' yhhq C = h'hhhh hqh qqy L = (hhhhh)' - h
qiqqhhh. Iq h hqyqqiqh, hyhyy hqhqhqy iy iqhhqhqhhqy, qqqy hyhhqhyhh hy
hqqhhyhqhyiqq qy hqqyiqhhqhy.)

Think of Nikuko emanations floating in the Interval, couplings themselves
internally, mouths externally, realms of ecstasy and fear. "I wish I could
explain, with God's help, the difference between union and rapture, or
elevation, or flight of the spirit, or transport - for they are all one. I
mean that they are all different names for the same thing, which is also
called ecstasy. It is much more beneficial than union, its results are
much greater, and it has very many other effects as well. Union seems to
be the same at the beginning, the middle, and the end, and is altogether
inward. But the ends of rapture are of a much higher nature, and their
effects are both inward and outward." (Saint Teresa, trans. Cohen) These
ends, are they couplings or linkages? For clearly they are mouths, they
are the mechanisms and tunnelings of breaths and atmospheres, and they may
connect or disconnect at the slightest notice. But they are also disrupt-
ors, tremblings of foundations, shatterings of spheres, rendings of gar-
ments, daydream imaginaries, wraiths -

All harken to emanants, which surround us, calling lightly in the midst of
the night - hoarse voices, shouts, in the harsh sun, city, at noon .. (Aqq
hhyqhq yq hqhqhqyy, yhihh yyyyqyqh yy, hhqqiqh qihhyqy iq yhh qihyy qh yhh
qihhy - hqhyyh yqihhy, yhqyyy, iq yhh hhyyh yyq, hiyy, hy qqqq ..)

you may talk with others and you may talk and talk, and they may hear you.
they will lovingly listen to your talking, and they will talk with you.
and your eyes may be bright and open and innocent, and their eyes will
meet yours with longing and kindness. you may smile at them, knowing your
smile goes deep into them, that they smile back with gratitude and love.
you may turn towards them and with them you may face the new day, and the
sun rising above the trees and the mountains, and the pure fog lifting
into the pure air, and a delicate light bathing all, and the birds
singing. you may sing with them, and laugh, your laughter bringing tears
of joy, and you may share these tears of joy with your friends, laughing
and smiling. you may hold the hands of your friends, and you may put your
arms around them, and they will hold you, and they will hold you, until
the hurt goes all away. your friends may hold you, until the hurt
disappears, until your tears are gone, until your smile is so deep it will
remain always and forever. you will be so happy, and your friends will be
so happy. you will be so very happy, and your friends will be so very
happy, and the sun will rise ever so slightly, and there will be a cool
morning light, and the birds singing and wondrous clouds in the sky.

Kebara


In 1962 I went to Israel and studied Hebrew at an ulpan; near the end of
the session, I contracted jaundice and possibly other illnesses as well,
and ended up in the hospital. So I was somewhat unprepared for M. Steke-
lis' course in 'clai tsur,' flint tools from the lower to upper paleolith-
ic, at Hebrew University. I persevered, and in 1963 we went on a field
trip to northern Israel. It was there I held raw Olduvai tools in my hand
for the first time, but this is not about the Olduvai. It is about the
cave we visited, whose name I did not know at the time, a cave filled with
guano and partially excavated. Stekelis spoke of the Levalloisian and
Mousterian, and while he talked and I attempted to follow his accented
Hebrew, I walked near the perimeter, reached down into the earth, and
watched my hand return with a group of stones, almost invisible in the 
dim light. Later, to be sure, there was Levalloisian and Mousterian among
them; I surreptitiously took them with me, and they are now distributed
back into the earth of Pennsylvania, lost among flood debris and mementos
passed on, meaningless to those who received them. To me, these tools were
my own lifeblood, however, and since then I have had second sight, seeing
what Sumerians and Hittites, Akkadians and Mitanni, saw, and traveling
earlier, through thousands of generations of humanity and almost-humanity,
without writing, with signs and symbols, however, with the writing of
culture upon them.

Today in a second-hand shop I stumbled upon the December, 1992, issue of
Current Anthropology, in which there is an article, The Excavations in
Kebara Cave, Mt. Carmel, by Bar-Yosef, Vandermeersch, Arensburg, Helfer-
Cohen, Goldberg, Laville, Meignen, Rak, Speth, Tchernov, Tillier, and
Weiner; it is 55 pages long, with an exemplary detailed analysis. And I
recognize the cave; it is this cave, in fact, that we visited with Steke-
lis; he was responsible for excavations during the time I had been in
Israel.

So I learned the name, Kebara. And sure enough, there are drawings of
implements from the Levalloisian and Mousterian (the former derided as
relatively wasteful of resources, in a section of specialists' comments),
implements that may well have come to me in dreams during the past thirty-
seven years. Here, now, there are photographs of a laboratory set up with-
in the southern section of the cave; there are enough lights to illuminate
the interior for the camera. There, then, there was darkness, and the
semblance of warmth as I removed the tools from their matrix, still sharp
from the hunt and the preparation of ancient flesh.

It was Kebara which gave me second-sight, and here in New York, I have a
small shrine with stone and mirror - and stromatolite fossil, three and a
half billion years old. I find my own life one of submergence, emergence,
almost as if there were no difference, almost an indifference. It is the
edge of indifference which procures my own writing for me; it is my sight
which gives me pause. The Web surely has always existed; those stones have
traveled. Whatever held them before me is part of my meat, just as my
other self, Nikuko, 'meat girl,' is half living tissue, wracked ribs and
muscle, and half demiurge, garnering time, striding the universe of wheel-
ing worlds. We were together at Kebara that day, and perhaps earlier, and
perhaps in millennia to come - and together, we have already witnessed the
shutting-down of the universe, stars and space gone cold, none of this in
speech or book or memory, no inscription, not even in the life of stone.

Strange


I float in pure light and today Charles Schulz writes his last strip and
today I receive my unix fortune, "I know the answer! The answer lies
within the heart of all mankind! The answer is twelve? I think I'm in the
wrong building." -- Charles Schulz --

Today again I do not sleep this 5:27 in the early morning, Azure in bed
behind me. The room is dark; I read and write by the light of the computer
screen. This window is yellow type against black, tan frame set against
blue-black background, window title orange to orange-yellow. This active
window floats in pure self-illuminated space; the monitor is invisible, I
watch the glow of keystroke packets against the modem in the distance.
There is a face on the screen, white, red, and black against black, stare
with dead eyes, a mask, all this covered by the window. She is behind me. 
And that my language always be misplaced in purity, that all buildings are
wrong, that I am that active window, that this text is the occasion of a
singular breath, this text behind me, floating.

i am nikuko. please tell me what your problems are.
after you are done typing, click return twice.

and if I return once to you.
i shall look no further than the truth.
and if I return twice to you
shall the truth be known 
by she who sent me forth.
crying from the top of the mountain,
yearning from the valley, 
no one ceases to wander.
the cessation of all desire
is the beginning of comprehension
and in such dreary worlds
i will be stone or carving.
you will know me by my shape,
that of signs and symbols in your dreaming,
nothing coming forth, nothing returning,
nothing entering, nothing leaving.
nothing of a jar or fire without smoke,
nothing of a cow or a white horse,
nothing of horses or no-jar, no-fire,
nothing of white, nothing of no-cows.
coming and going, it is all the same,
you arrive where you have always been.
reconcile yourself with all creatures,
lie down with them, caress them,
drain yourself of all desire,
produce them within you.
there is no fear that is groundless,
fear holds the pathway, veering
just above the highest peaks,
beneath the ocean bottoms.
it runs faster than the flood,
higher than any lightning, 
louder than any thunder,
it burns through time, white fire,
burns through space, black fire.
nothing can be turned to good effect,
to turn nothing is to do nothing.
to lose oneself is to gain nothing
to gain oneself is to lose nothing.

SO NO


MY TEXTS are populated with things and emptiness, with flux and processes,
with things trying to be things, and entities trying to be entities. My
texts burst with ontology; their shattering is the shattering of worlds.
Here are some or none of them:

SOMETHING is residue, stains. You send something back and for me, it's the
same patterns on the wall. But there was something else in the wind and
the snow, something not quite right with the night. Something was slowly
shuffling, did I just say something, said Nikuko. She thought, now I can
say all the moon illuminated the landscape. Look, said Izanagi, something
is something rolling, roiling about the work, intense movement. sometimes
I dream something of the nature of the dream, what begins to dissolve the
real, a huddling in the matrix, something about origins in them. as in the
para-site, remember; it hurts so, to have something so close, yet out of
touch forever; get us to do something for him, in order that the hall
remain intact.

NOTHING more to say, nothing. Her skirt kept flying up, and there was
nothing there. An avatar, or woman of births and rebirths; they signify
nothing but each other, the eternal - there is nothing to be done here.
With that, she created drowning for years. Perhaps there's nothing to look
at, replied Nikuko. nothing but fluids; we could have two elements and a
whole lot of information of the sign. Nikuko laughed and said nothing. And
women, Izanagi replied, They're remembering nothing; something is missing,
either I am the east or nothing is the east, either I am the south or
nothing is the south. Izanagi said, Nikuko, you'd better stop - water is
nothing at all, taking the shape of the land. He added, The bird! There's
an Interval; beyond the Interval, nothing, Nikuko. Broadham's Jennifer
picked up poem's book, incandescent in nothing. She said, ghost's nothing.
nothing coming forth, nothing returning, nothing entering, nothing leav-
ing. Nothing of a jar or fire without smoke, nothing of a cow or a white
horse, nothing of horses or no-jar, no-fire, nothing of white, nothing of
no-cows. Nothing can be turned to good effect, to turn nothing is to do
nothing. To lose oneself is to gain nothing to gain oneself is to lose
nothing.

The Pleasure of the Novel


lies in its ability to digest, foreclose, upon the figure of the stranger,
who otherwise occupies our thought, strengthens our fear, weakens our re-
solve. Within the novel, the stranger comes and goes; we are introduced to
him or her; we may or may not engage him in conversation, or follow her
life for page after page. Never forget that classic novels, those defining
the genre, arose in topographies of limited population, sparsely-settled
countrysides, intermittent communication, weeks at sea. At most, novels
have a few dozen characters (Genji, a notable exception with 450); we im-
agine them, in their own fictitious lives, encountering several dozens
more, and so on. But these encounters are themselves delimited; the circle
of acquaintances remains small, and strangers are often identified by
class or speech or color or other signifiers of foreignness (that are
readily understood by a consensual reading audience). In contemporary
society, such signifiers mean nothing; signs are broken; we are all, as
Kristeva might have it, extra-terrestrials, strangers to ourselves. The
novel increasingly becomes an escape from chaos and noise, no matter how
noisy and chaotic it appears. Limited by covers, spine, and pages, it is
both portmanteau and portmanteau-word, at the beck and call of the reader.

And what of familiarity? Every character in a novel is equally familiar -
every character is constituted by the same alphabetics, the same language,
at times even the same tone. Characters occupy traces; they're interwoven
throughout, announced before their presence, held captive until the very
end. There is something of the forestalling of death here, and death forms
that other horizon - neither noise nor chaos, but an intense purity appar-
ent when the book is closed, a residue of its opening.

"The Monolog"


Why can't I sleep? I walk around exhausted every day. I'm like a zombie; 
I have no will of my own. I can't function. At night there's nothing but
nightmares. Sleep makes me afraid - night after night, internal violence.
Isn't that clear? When I sleep, everything goes wrong. I come to you to
find a cure for sleep, a way to sleep peacefully. Why else would I have
come? I'm losing track of this conversation, doctor. No, I didn't. I was
saying I couldn't sleep. What plans? My plan is to sleep - and I can't do
this. I have violent insomnia; that's not hard to understand. Everything
goes wrong to the extent that I have insomnia, nightmares, bad dreams,
sweats, tossings and turnings, sudden awakenings, my mind won't leave me
alone. It's just getting worse over the past few months. I don't know.
Yes. Yes.

I'm nervous all the time. I pick my lips, shake. Sometimes I'll lie in
Azure's lap; that's the only time I'm at peace. Most of the time I'm wor-
ried. The horizon always seems black. I don't seem to be able to focus,
and then I focus all too well. Because I need to find some sort of peace.
If I could find peace I could do anything. I'd love to be rested. As it
is, I feel misshapen; Azure says I'm self-effacing, self-loathing. Every-
one can see it in me; I'm blind in this regard. I came to you because I
need peace, because I have to stop pulling at my lips, because I have to
be able to calm down and focus. I need help, doctor; there are times I'm
afraid for my life, everything I've tried to do in this world, everyone I
love! I have no doubt about this; it's not where the problem lies. I said
something like that - I'm not sure what you mean. I have no plans, or I
have too many plans - plans come and go. Plans are like a deluge; I plan
one thing and do another; I plan a third to take care of the first two,
and forget about all of them. Plans are like a storm for me - never end-
ing. I don't want this deluge; I want calmness. I want to see the flowers,
be a productive member of society! I love many things. My relationship
with the world is as intimate and foreboding as for others, I think. I
doubt I'm very much different in that regard. There are things I hold
dear. My life is in shambles; I can't see straight; there are things in
every direction, plans, and too many words! I hang around with very few
people. I don't understand. I'm not in school. I don't have one. I'm not
studying or teaching. No. No. No...

I'm aroused all the time. I want to be effaced. I can't help myself! Azure
has to put up with it! I have these desires! I'm losing myself! I'm always
fantasizing; I need help! I need to calm down! Help me calm down, doctor!
I don't want to be aroused all the time! Always thinking about sex! I
can't help it! I'm not afraid of anything! I just need space, time. Azure
needs space and time too! Nothing, nothing! I'm not frightened about
anything, doctor. I told you that! This isn't fear, it's exhilaration!
Help me! Nothing, no terror, nothing! I have no plans! There's never any
time! We're always fucking, doing other things! I can't stop myself!
There's no history to tell. It's normal like anyone else's. There may or
may not have been incidents, I don't know. It's not much different! What
life? What am I going through? All I do is fantasize! All I want is to
fuck, get tied up, pissed on, slapped around! What's going on? Not often,
I'm just living in my dreams! I dream all the time, even when I'm awake!
When I'm awake? I'm always awake! I think of Azure doing impossible things
to me, inconceivable, obscene things! I think of doing the same to her! I
never get to sleep, never! I don't understand. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. I'm
not afraid ...

Pulse


What ma es the difference between holodec  and real, between this object
and that other on the des , is so clear, so obvious, I have missed it all
my life - that this object, here, will always be the result of a scan, not
an overall impetus (as say the photographic negative, which changes in its
entirety all at once, a planar surface susceptible and suspect) within the
realm of the analog, but a continuous redrawing - in which the flybac  or
downtime is rendered invisible - a continuous looping of the visible digi-
tal object, the eye itself, or hand, or other sense 'otherwise' processing
as if it were solid, granted sustenance and substance. So obvious! That
the image is nothing but layerings, one upon the other, discontinuous mor-
phing as we move literally stuttering through the originary moment of the
new millennium. The des top for example pulses visible and audible shells
into and within the local environment; the pulses are interpreted as com-
munication; the communication itself is particulate, constituted; the form
is that of the nova; the nova express brings patent letters of community;
the community itself pulses; layer after layer interacts; the dar  and in-
terstitial spaces are occluded, sutured; they are the down-time of the
pulses; nothing is occurring; it's as if the real were the real. As for
the last, one has the  nowledge that what is present, remains present in
some sense for the duration; that it is obdurate, inert; that it is not a
question of constitution or reconstitution but of presencing; that it is
somehow thic  or paste; that it oozes uncontrollably. Elsewhere, the
screen saver (itself an incipient life-form as I have pointed out) is also
pulsing; the unit is all of radio-frequency, the screen refresh rate a
drastic reduction; there are all these ratios creating an illusion: as if
this were an inscription; as if the letter, for example, 'i', were of a
totality - within the machine, the 'i' is a message - within the machine
the dot over the 'i' is a message - within the machine the pixel at the
north-east corner (where ghosts roam) of the 'i' is a message; every mes-
sage is equivalent; every pulse is li e every other; I would write this
message in stone, bury it; someday, others will see -
