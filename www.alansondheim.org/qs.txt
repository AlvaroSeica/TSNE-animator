casting of viola


viola accompanied by electric piano matrix improvisation

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/casting0.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/casting1.mp3

casting0 = casting about
casting1 = casting out, setting the cast - short unaccompanied
  improvisation after the theme is set / cast

i am fronted with myself, casting aside the electron beam displacement
energies shadowing their spectra before me. a sickness like that of death
came over her, when, casting her eyes down, depression depth and misery
began their slow and silent songs, it is difficult to read this, to dance
this, seized by iremu casting themselves adrift, tethered by air, "there
is little room but such wind!" say the little fisherwomen, casting their
nets into the the room, around me, and there was a circular lamp, a
circular lamp casting its yellow light, overhead, warming the room in all
ways, the solitary pine trees between myself and the moon, casting the
shadow of the coals over which his worshippers are pulled. ah the wind is
in the air, the lamps are finally lit, and the shadows, the shadow of the
noonday sun... o the casting spell from blackened casting cauldron, cast
spell dead dead dead, this lives under some hillside, the soil aloft upon
timber, the semblance of dissolution, the annual slough, and the wind, the
wind is in the air; the lamps are finally lit, yellow glows everywhere,
casting the shadow of the noonday sun...

resonant phenomena, Undine with an explanation

http://www.alansondheim.org/undine.mov
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/undine.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/undine1.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/undine2.png

explanation - i first explored wave phenomena in undine.mp3, using 
electric oud, imagining emergent forms that interfered with each other, 
sometimes close to inaudible; the matrix is deep bass, as if the forms 
were rising to an uncanny surface. i then used second life to create the 
two still images, undine1.png and undine2.png, which represent the use of 
a 'pencil' that was given to me, and that allows me to leave trails or 
traces of objects behind a moving avatar. the avatar outlined a portal, 
which then produced its own bathos, own phenomena - intrinsic, through 
scripting, but also extrinsic, in relation to what the recording computer 
could accommodate. it took a great deal of time to create undine.mov, a 
looping video of the phenomena - which include both particle production 
and repeated texture mapping, to the extent that the computer, inworld 
parcel, and external net connection would allow. so the result is a 
mapping of complex interactions among a number of phenomena; the ideal - 
what was set - would be a total mapping of revolving textures, which i 
knew (even with overclocking the computer itself for example) would prove 
impossible. 

i imagine all these phenomena interlocked - the still images, as on a 
desktop background; the (modified) electric oud matrix playing continuous- 
ly, and the rat-a-tat video giving an inworld outworld dreaming of what 
might be a universal pulsing.

( such a pulsing is always broken, always confounded, always local - such
dreaming tending towards an absolute, romanticism suturing the anguish of
authentic loss )



Why Spencer Brown is Wrong


"The idea that everything is understood can be indicated by revolving the 
Pradesini (index) finger and also eye-sight and by pressing the Alapadma 
pose.

"The sound to be heard should be indicated by contacting the ear (with the 
palm) and the objects to be seen by appropriate looks. Things pertaining 
to over [one's ?] self, to others or to some one should also be expressed 
by the different looks.

"The performer should indicate lightning (the falling of) meteor, thunder, 
of the cloud, the sparks and the flame and the whip by contracting the 
body and narrowing the eyes."

-- from Priyabala Shah, Art of Dancing (Classical and Folk Dances)

It's impossible to believe that the logical foundation of the physical 
world doesn't originate (isn't tied in) with the Sheffer stroke and its 
dual; this isn't about the foundations of (abstract) logic, but the 
ontological nowhere implied by "neither A nor B" - expulsion - as well as 
"not both A and B" which, like negation itself, points elsewhere. Not both 
A and B however is constructed around a kernel or Pale; anything else, 
abstract or otherwise, is acceptable. But neither A nor B opens up an 
uninscribed and possibly fissured space; nothing is present. Both Sheffer 
and dual are generators of the propositional logic; both participate in 
the desert of ontology that ensues.

If S.B. is going to draw a distinction, he's already plummeted through 
Merleau-Ponty. If he's going to construct an imaginary, he's run through 
Husserl's internal time-consciousness as well.

"not both a and b. neither a nor b.": are nothing, tokens, graphemes, 
textual displacements, koan. S.B., there's nowhere to go; he insists on 
traveling, dragging the body with him, all well and good, but already a 
physics drawing a logic drawing a physics etc.

What's unmarked is marked as unmarked; what's marked is unmarked as 
marked. A mark is always already. A mark has nothing to do with this text.

or its dual for example as the basis - neither a nor b - not both a and b
the same, not both a and b, neither a nor b

dual: "neither A nor B"; Sheffer: "not both A and B"; the fundamental 

But meaning may be produced even out of tautology. For example, proposi- 
tional logic may be derived from the Sheffer stroke, "not both A and B"; 
it can also be derived from its dual, "neither A nor B." What can we say 
about these? Only that they represent, as processes or cullings of 
particular bounded universes, an unbinding/unbounding - "neither A nor B" 
points elsewhere altogether, and "not both A and B" points either else- 
where or towards an underpinning of union. At the heart of this reduction 
of propositional logic is a tendency towards dispersion, wandering, the 
nomadic, even though the symbols within the calculus proper are completely 
mute. The Sheffer stroke and its dual are related as well to the processes 
of inscription - for what is x^-x, than an inscription of an entity, a 
process of coding (and all coding is inscription of one form or another) 
the real for the purposes of comprehension, a process that produces, not 
only meaning, but all the meaning there is. There is no outside to the 
sememe, just as there is no landscape without a viewpoint. In this sense 
we are bounded, bound to be bounded.

not both A and B well I never stroke A|B, not both A and B, and its dual 
AYB, the hidden V conjoint, Sheffer stroke, not both A and B, and its 
dual, neither A nor B, as a domain. The work relies on the Sheffer stroke* 
("not both A and B") B' points elsewhere altogether, and 'not both A and 
B' points either 0: neitherness, not both A and B, neither A nor B (a 
priori mathesis) 0, 0': neitherness, not both A and B, neither A nor B (a 
priori mathesis).

emotions or prime numbers; bricks or philosophy. Obscenity is valuable 
in its valuelessness; it works, working through nothing; it is contrary 
or wayward, contradiction; obscenity occurs within the Sheffer stroke 

Therefore "by default": given that there is none, that there is none 
other; our ethos: subsummation of the other; recuperation of the other 
within the same; recuperation of the same within the other.

poetry remains elsewhere (neither A nor B). For that matter, text is never

Sheffer stroke, not both A and B, and its dual, neither A nor B. In order 
that h. is _neither here nor there,_ _neither A nor B._ So and its dual 
("neither A nor B") to construct a logical picture bolstered by "neither A 
nor B," which, I have shown in other texts, and B'; it can also be derived 
from its dual, 'neither A nor B.' What can "neither A nor B"; in its

Negation: chain/elsewhere/classical/non-classical/neither a nor b/a|b 
Chain: not-A goes somewhere else; not-not-A is not an automatic return, 
doesn't cohere.



ragtag


legions armed to the teeth emerge from the matrix
and they have no conscience and no wheres to go
they don't know anything they want to stay alive
they march in rag tag ways and means they leave

until the last microtome slice of tissue disappears
these things will be used and come to get you
they won't stay long they can't learn anything at all
try and teach them they leave but not before they slaughter

come and burn your eyes blind with what you have done
what you've done to everything on earth that still says no
they're deaf and gone they have their marching orders
you gave them that you gave the gift of birth

their lovely birth they've turned to stone survive
they cry their bitter tears won't take anything alive

Two Second Life Videos from East of Odyssey


http://www.youtube.com/OdysseySimulator#p/a/u/1/ppDASY7icxU

Liz Solo video of Odyssey performance with Alan Sondheim, Sandy Baldwin. 
This is one of the best videos, if not the best, of the installation/ 
performance work I've done. (The installation was up earlier, constructed 
and deconstructed during the performance as well; Sandy performed 
brilliantly with text and movement in the complex environment.) Do check 
this out, and it's on YouTube, making it simple and a joy to watch - set 
your computer at 720p if you can.

http://www.alansondheim.org/fleshpulse.mov

Yet another gloomy pulsing "fleshy" installation segment - from the same 
objects and space as the Solo video - pushing the notion of "avatar tis- 
sue" through an untoward looping of some odd phenomena. Source materials
include bowed yayli tanbur and Timpanogos Cave footage.

Video Microphotography in SL

I found an odd command in one of the SL interfaces that allowed me to make 
the following; it's eerily reminiscent of video-microphotography pieces I 
did in the 1970s. It gives me pause; surely these things are alive?

...Tomei

[ ...and then just last night, reading Ovid's Tristia, and his exile near 
Tomis also spelled Tomi, somewhere in Romania, the following begins to 
unravel further, uncannily adding another layer to the message/massage. 
"Tomis! Outlandish name! With what bitterness the storm-tossed poet speaks 
of 'The Tomitans, situated in some corner of the world'! [...] Tomis(1) 
((1) - Tomis, not Tomi, is indicated by the manuscripts and is the 
older form of the name.) (the modern Constantza) lay on an elevated and 
rocky part of the coast, about sixty-five miles south-west of the nearest 
mouth of the Danube, in that part of Roumania now called the Dobrudja." 
(From the introduction by A.L. Wheeler, Loeb.)

"In AD 8, the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17) was banished here by Augustus and 
died there eight years later. He laments his exile in Tomis in his poems 
the Tristia and Epistulae Ex Ponto. Tomis was "by his account a town 
located in a war-stricken cultural wasteland on the remotest margins of 
the empire". A statue of Ovid stands in the Ovid Square (Piata Ovidiu) of 
Constanta, in front of the History Museum (the former City Hall)." 
(Wikipedia.)

So Tomei is surely Tomi, an outland Italy; of course my mother had been to 
Romania, bringing me back two gifts, a photographic book of Bran's castle, 
and an hourglass... The original dream/text follows. ]

sometimes a dream heralds, not the debris of the day, but the residue of 
the future. this afternoon i had such, discordant with my life in the 
narrowed interval of hours, weeks, months. my mother was in the back, by 
the dresser in the bedroom; she said she's 84 or 85; dressed in a maroon 
1940's outfit, sleek, she seemed about 40. before this my father, in his 
brown bathrobe, was walking slowly through the kitchen, near the cabinets 
on the left - he's 96 (my mother died at 80), there were french legion- 
naires, in parade dress, surrounding him, emptying the cabinets, or 
perhaps looking into the cabinets 'already swept clean.' and i had walked 
down the hall to my mother, who said he was quite old, and near Tomei, or 
the cliffs of Tomei (pronounced toe-my), and he might have been lear, or 
shakespeare, and as for me, i was to flee the cliffs, the nubbed edge of 
the harsh sea, for that were death. and i woke, because my greatest fear 
is death, the thought of death terrifies and immobilizes me, i weep, out 
of control, i cry out, i turn to panic. and when i woke, i looked up Tomei 
on the net, and there were Tomeis in italy, seemingly without relevance, 
and less for those in madagascar. but there was a Tomei tollroad running 
near the sea in japan, and near tokyo and nagoya, and i followed it on the 
maps as it entered and left a mountain tunnel which seemed quite long. and 
i knew that something occurred in that tunnel, or would occur, or would 
have occurred, had i not already witnessed the name, that would have 
relevance for me. and now i am left with that, the name Tomei with no 
relation to the actress who was in a play by shakespeare to be sure, the 
name which so asserted itself as geographical, that i can only connect it 
to the nerve of the tollroad, and the unsupported, presupposed, event, 
already never happening, already lost, to me, already unaccountable.



The Ridings


Hegelung tuned with lowered melody string, Azure Carter:

The riding pieces.

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/riding1.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/riding2.mp3

These are fairly complex; the hegelung's range is extended and the number 
of independent notes is pretty much doubled. The result is something 
that's closer to taksim than dulcimer accompaniment. Apparently there's 
precedent for this sort of tuning in Mindanao as well.

These kinds of works seem to embody structures that might otherwise be 
approach philosophically - issues of phrasing, body, language, recursiv- 
ity, 'father-mother' structures, immersive phenomenology, relevance 
theory, communality - they're all present. I'm not always sure how to 
bring these back into descriptive/academic language, traditional 
philosophical discourse. Everything is presenced, and sound reveals an 
other not otherwise accounted-for.



9/11, 2010

this doesn't make sense, nothing happens, just brief moments,
almost expressions, in the middle of the air there is air,
in the middle of the ground there is nothing, quiescent dynamics,
above and below collapse into before and after, left and right,
up and down collapse into near and far, here and there, as in -
here and there, is nothing, beyond and before, is nothing, 
 and as in
previous to, subsequent to, nothing, dynamics, in the silence
of dynamics, two people holding hands, there were, in the air,
 and as in
so little time to go

Julu's Visiting

Julu Twine comes to visit and rattles the environment.

In short takes 1-3, s/he's running upwards and downwards from Humlab and 
I'm adjusting hir parameters.

In short take 4, s/he's shaking the environment in East of Odyssey.

Everthing in 1-3 is Julu Twine of course; in 4, s/he's coupled to the 
supple objects in the installation.

S/he tends to make a mess of things. The first time s/he motored, the 
gaming laptop crash, not a mien feat. The second time I overclocked so 
that s/he could do hir worst. S/he did hir cheap tricks.

They were hir mean feet, things were rattling around.

a deity that demands belief is a circular logic fueled by power.
other than the social, there is no gain in believing in a deity.
the social demands an absolute directly, the deity by proxy.
the social constructs the horror of disbelief and negation.
to negate the deity is to negate the absolute.
to negate the absolute is to relegate oneself to the abject. 
the abject transforms inherent value into disgust.
the disgusting is expelled.
the social erects expulsion and annihilation as divine command.
the social creates an absolute wall between belief and disbelief.

belief in a deity and belief in justice are inherently different.
the aegis of power entangles then as 1:0.
justice and laws are inherently different.
laws are constructed by the social under the aegis of divinity.
law is infinite and tends towards infinite closure.
justice has no origin.
justice is to law as 0:1.

it is the matter of belief which is a violation.
belief is always a violation and always a surplus. 
it plays a role only as the foundation of inerrancy.
there is no other foundation of inerrancy.
belief and inerrancy are as 1:1.

a deity has an ineffable and numinous name.
the name of a deity is tricked.
the tricked name is not the name.
the name is the power of the name.
the tricked name is to language as 0:0.
language is the circumscription of the name of the deity.
speech is always a circumscription.
speech and writing are the violence of language.
language is inherently violent.
language is to the world as 1:0.
the ineffable name grinds the law.
the law is such because it is believed to be the law.
justice is such because it is believed to be nothing.

i will not murder: that is to the good.
i will not act against others; others will not act against me.
i will or will not believe: that is the horror of inerrancy.
inerrancy dictates the horror of belief.
inerrancy inheres to language; language inheres to inerrancy.
inerrancy trumps inerrancy; inerrancy trumps contradiction.
the language of inerrancy sutures subject and contradiction.
the language of inerrancy corrals neither x nor y.
the corral circumscribes divine power; the boundary is abject.
the abject boundary is therefore the most violent.
beyond the abject boundary daily life is grounded in language.
the language of daily life is  fundamentally one of dictation.
the source of dictation, of speech, is divine power.
the source of divine power is power.

power locates itself topographically.
topographically, not topologically: building, not dwelling.
the building is always a circumscription.
the wall of the building is all.

...

'sources can be assumed by tracing trajectories back to origins.'
the trajectories are permanently unknowable.
the trajectories are errant.
according to power, the trajectories are knowable and inerrant.
mathesis and data are absolute.
mathesis may be stochastic or classical.
heisenberg is the dispersion of power and not its ungrounding.
knowing within calculable tolerances is the divine totality.
knowledge is division within language, capital, absolute.
knowledge is .5:.5.

the assumption of sources is divine.

bit of the old bowed swing

swingwest1 is a three-layered improvisation for yamaha keyboard,
with viola added as a fourth. swingwest2 shows what happens when 
a country beat is placed in the background. to be honest, a beat
was used in part of the swingwest1, and then taken out. so west1
turns into an odd pointillist improvisation and west2 becomes 
something with odd moments of modal swing. god gave me rhythm;
all the rest is bowed.

sizzle and crazylegs


sizzling avatars w/ tissue emergent about to take over
my father pinches me between his fingers & white grub emerges
i escape his & every other authority and run to sweden and california
these things are my friends and i make them dance the whoo whoo
he robs my brain and turns me into a monster who write the whoo whoo

no longer sleeping this and any other night these things fall from me
they clatter to invisible ground with torn emergent tissue
they make me do things and no one thinks i'm very nice
but i am smart and will outlive no one and they will be very sorry
they will dance the whoo whoo on my grave and spit on me
their spit will soon become emergent tissue and white grub emergent
they don't know i did this the whoo whoo
i'm dead i can't tell a thing

Liardon, either Foofwa or I held the camera and made the video and
effects reminiscent of G. Moreau come to life, the church is in the 
Swiss Alps, Rilke was buried behind it, murals of tormented hell,
angelic world of Elegies, we were transported

Tornado!


http://www.alansondheim.org/tornado.mp4 Original in HD. There were tornado 
warnings in Brooklyn around 5 this afternoon - rotating cells were seen on 
radar. So it hit around 5:20 and I went outside and shot this two minutes 
at the height of it. We went out tonight as well - there are trees and 
branches down all over the place as well as crushed cars and stuff like 
skylights and ventilators that blew off rooftops. The storm lasted maybe 
three minutes. As far as I know we have no damage, but the place across 
the street had aluminum siding torn off (you can see this in the video). 
We still have to go onto our roof and check it out. I have a lot of very 
clear stills as well, but this conveys what it felt like. The camera was 
completely soaked but luckily still works!

Life yesterday -

**eros and logos**


http://www.alansondheim.org/double-d.mov

With Sandy Baldwin at Humlab online in Second Life. I have two more days f 
the residency; Sandy went in with me, and we performed 23 gigabytes of 
material! This is from the set. I'm quite excited about the work. We used 
all sorts of animations, Sandy used script programs, I added and subtrac- 
ted objects.

I want to call the series 
**eros and logos**
or
**the merging of theory and desire**

And more on this later.

Earlier, made http://www.alansondheim.org/doubledance.mov solo - in this, 
the single avatar (Alan Dojoji) is taken over by the choreography-objects; 
at the same time, s/he is moved by an entangled second animation as well.

- Alan



Intro and Pool


Introdance - when Sandy and I first meet in the current performance round 
- in Second Life, such a delicate approach, I'm riding stuff, looking 
everywhere, jump off, approach, is it logos approaching eros, eros 
approaching logos, logos on logos, SL is nothing if not logos, what goes 
on in Vegas is true, necessarily - otherwise nothing would function - the 
world itself is a reconstruction - our physical reality as well - 
something for another time, another equation, group of equations -

Pooldance - what happens when there's dance dance everywhere, Alan Dojoji 
moods to jerk-music, jerks to mood-music -

Time's running out, what else can be done here, pioneers of the virtual- 
alien, not giving into the real, bringing us in and out alive -

I'd say more but there's so little time - these are bodies at work - I 
turn off the machines, put down the bow - I'm sweating like crazy, the 
brain twitches come and go - this is going to end before the dream does - 
something unlucky there -

Terror.mov

This was made about a month after 9/11, in Miami at FIU. It's extreme and 
if you're offended by sex and/or its equation with terror, please don't 
watch. It's up for a day and a half only; it's a work I just found again 
in my files. The equation of sex and terror and the con/figuration of the 
terrorist is a common trope; you find it 'in' Baader Meinhof, Weathermen, 
etc. It's also the terror of sex and sexual terror. I could go on theoret- 
ically, but prefer silence now. In Miami I was hysteric and exhausted; 
this inversion is one of the results. I made a number of pieces dealing 
with terror, anthrax, sexuality, pushing representation as far as I could. 
I 'like' this piece; I just don't want it in general circulation. - Alan

signs of in-visible power.


Three Guitar Solos - check them out -

Three solos recorded on an unusual instrument - a very cheap (plywood 
etc.) Rhapsody guitar that was outfitted in the 1930s 0r 1940s with an 
early electric pickup. The sound is amazingly good. Photographs and
three pieces follow. The guitar has an odd sound; I put new very light
gauge electric guitar strings on it. I wouldn't have been able to play
these pieces on any other instrument. The neck is very wide, the body
small. If you have any information on Rhapsody instruments (I found
nothing online) or this particular pickup (ditto), please let me know.
It's definitely not humbucking. The knobs etc. are bakelite and the
soldering style etc. seems very early.

for Humlab, to which you may visit one or another or in quantity; the
residency ends today, the 25th; and a very short portraitt.mov of older

raised another configuration of the avatar to a height greater than 40,000 
with a more complex result, to be sent out. the irresolving alan dojoji 
avatar has transformed into pure light. this is the last day of the Humlab

Sweetness

Chris Funkhouser and I were writing back and forth about riffs and I 
realize I rarely use them, at least not consciously, since they tend to 
repeat themselves uncomfortably; in any case, sweetness1 uses a riff one 
way or another for a little song; in sweetness2, the riff's dissolved, 
deconstructed, transformed, to no end, or one and another; just a little 
guitar music dealing with a "theme" of sorts, maybe time for a hit tune 
maybe.

be gone soon enough, and it's worth seeing. Humlab is at HUMlab

of azure and me last night performing after chris and amy

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/adamzperform.mp3

i'm playing electric-acoustic oud, electric-acoustic guitar, viola,
electric saz and i'm playing them all too well.

so now i can retire.
i hate retirement (since the last sentence).
now i can do all the things i've always wanted to do.
i can steal from anyone, jail will last such a short time.
did i tell you i was the one who burned down brooklyn?
no? well i'll keep you guessing.

now if brooklyn burns down tonight for any reason you can say -
he did it. he said he would do it and he did it. you know he's
retired and he thinks that gives him the right to do anything.
well maybe that's true, look what he did - he burned down brooklyn.

i should add that even though i have a deep attachment to brooklyn,
it is not my native land.

since i'm retired, though, the whole world is my oyster. 
however, it would be truer to say my oyster is the whole world,
especially if my oyster were our red-eared slider, who has not yet
retired (our turtle is very young). did i tell you i forgot my name?
did you ask me?

Fire Museum Presents:


Vavoom Quintet
 Alan Sondheim,  Helene Espvall, Barry Weisblat, Margarida Garcia,
 Azure Carter

Eric Carbonara

George Korein

Saturday, October 9th 8:00PM
Highwire Gallery
2040 Frankford Ave.
Philadelphia, PA $6

Vavoom Quintet:

Taking their name from a character from the Felix the Cat cartoon that 
could level a mountain with the sound of his voice, this is the debut 
performance of the Vavoom Quintet.

Starting with releases on the ESP Disk and Riverboat labels in the late 
60's, multi-instrumentalist Alan Sondheim returns to Philadelphia with 
this new group. About his Fire Museum release Ski/nn, The Wire had this to 
say: ?He wades into each track using a strong sense of rhythm to tame and 
shape his often harshly dissonant figures. Whether at a stately pace or in 
rapid scrabble, the music evokes an ethnographic hybrid of countless 
string instrument traditions, from koto to bluegrass, vigorously wiping 
past idiomatic technique as it does so.?

Perhaps best known as the cellist for Philadelphia psych-folk group 
Espers, Helena Espvall has collaborated with such diverse figures as 
Fursaxa, Oluyemi Thomas, Sharron Kraus, Ernesto Diaz-Infante, Lukas 
Ligeti, Samara Lubelski, Eugene Chadbourne, Pauline Oliveros, Scorces, 
Katt Hernandez and many others.

Recently relocated from Lisbon to Brooklyn, Margarida Garcia is a central 
figure in Portuguese experimental music. A member of the group Curia, she 
has collaborated in live/recording settings with Manuel Mota, N?el 
Akchot?, Otomo Yoshihide, Oren Ambarchi, Loren Connors, Marcia Bassett, 
Ruth Barber?n, John Tilbury, Eddie Prevost, Rhodri Davies, Matt Valentine, 
Alex Neilson, Mattin & (of course) many others.

Barry Weisblat is a sound artist and electronic instrument builder who 
extensively experiments with electro-magnetic devices, solar technology, 
homemade and modified circuits for application in sound 
generation/manipulation and audio engineering. He has collaborated with 
Tower Recordings, Mattin, Tim Barnes and Tetuzi Akiyama, and has built 
instruments for Peter Kowald, Toshio Kajiwara, Manuel Mota and Matt 
Valentine.

Azure Carter is an artist/performer/vocalist living in New York City with 
her husband/collaborator, Alan Sondheim. She has a bachelor's degree in 
contemporary art history from UCI and a master's degree in environmental 
conservation from NYU. She writes songs and texts, makes videos and 
costumes, and performs live.

Eric Carbonara:

Tonight is the pre-release party for Eric?s newest release, The Paradise 
Abyss. Eric Carbonara is a Philadelphia based guitarist, whose search for 
raw aural expression has led him far and wide ? from noise & 
electro-acoustic music to taking deep root in the bounty of the wooden 
guitar. Carbonara?s playing draws on the rich musical styles from 
Andalusian Roma-Flamenco to Hindustani & North African folk to form a kind 
of exalted pidgin style of playing that covers a wide emotional terrain 
from meditative calm to restless unease. He has developed a unique idiom 
of gypsy music for non-existent cultures by combining rogue self-taught, 
free-form classical and flamenco techniques with those learned from formal 
studies in India. His live solo performances range from contemplative 
acoustic meditations to aggressively loud electric sets; both encompassing 
Carbonara?s ability to draw the listener in to his world. He has toured 
extensively throughout the United States and Europe promoting his releases 
on Locust Music, Majumua Music and New American Folk Hero as well as 
various self-releases for solo guitar and solo upright-chaturangui music.

George Korein:

"How lovely is it that I can write, ?I?ve never heard anything like this 
before,?? Korein builds (his) unlikely themes from even more unlikely 
sounds? piercing electronic tones, dissonant loops of feedback, distorted 
horns, Helena Espvall?s cello, kissing noises, and a sizeable portion of 
his own unique approach to guitar. In many ways, the enjoyment of ?Another 
Corpse? is watching Korein keep it all up in the air. Overall, it reminds 
me of what my old driving instructor used to say, ?it?s a series of small 
adjustments?? well, expect when it isn?t. At times, particularly during 
the black metal drum pounding of ?Pulsing Corpse,? Korein crashes this 
bizarre vehicle just for the fun of it. ?Another Corpse? does seem to have 
a bit of structure to it, though, with the somewhat cold and austere 
beginnings gradually leading towards the introduction of more organic 
instrumentation. Clearly this cracked genius/800-pound gorilla can go 
anywhere he damn well pleases.? ? It?s Too Damn Early review of ?Another 
Corpse? (Majmua Music)

This evening is a benefit for Partners In Health's Haitian Relief Work.

Eros and Logos in Second Life
Erasure / Manque in Second Life

Quickly the installation disappears, objects deleted or returned to 
database. Deletion is absolute; in spite of appearances, virtual worlds 
have no memory. Digital bits are always negotiable, and what is gone is 
annihilated; even energy disappears. Scripts never return - they simply 
have never been, image/video evidence to the contrary. It is all 
constructible beneath the sign of capital; eliminated, there is another 
sign, that of genocide or the Phaistos disk.

http://www.alansondheim.org/okamiierasure.mp4

Earlier, these happened, as if eros had anything but a formal role to 
play. Listen carefully and a voice asks the expense of another skin, 
against impossible odds of sexuality manifest anywhere other than the 
articulated apparent membrane of the body. Someday this will change, and 
felt constructs will replace visual animations. But think about this as a 
reversal, and retroactive: think of skin and sexuality now, as already 
gone, or the production of something organic in a vastly ancient world. 
We're tumbling towards that, doing everything we can to speed things up: 
annihilation to the limit, or, as the world dies, to the limitless. 
There's no technological future, none organic. These dancing figure are 
simulacra, already ghosts, unrealizing before their virtual, and real, 
worlds disappear forever.

http://www.alansondheim.org/okamii.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/okamii2.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/okamii3.mp4

It always seems, even in the midst of artificial passion, suicidal, the 
gibbering of membranes without thought: we have never thought, in fact or 
otherwise. Look at the despair with which one grasps the last of 
Wittgenstein's Tractatus, as if mysticism somehow opens a gate. But the 
gate is gateless, a zen without recourse or koan, without the poetics of 
mysticism. Grown up, we can read Philo again as godless, someone finding 
meaning everywhere, someone always trying. There are others trying 
slaughter on for size.

It is remarkable how the _bending back_ of an ikon or avatar constructs
an offering, sexualized but beyond the Pale. No one is the victor in these 
encounters; everyone arises aroused, just before the erasure of the world.

in front of a fan.
i rock back and forth with a pearl-white netbook
that has the look of ipod, not odd, the base is
the same case.
in the air there, earnest music distributes itself
from a laptop shelf.
the bass boost level is over the top, as you'd
expect in any shop.
the man walks past me with a blackberry clutched
in hand, he's not saying much.
rain outside and another laptop arrives with
beret, hipster stir.
nothing goes on in america, we steal your wireless
mr and ms linksys for our own business.
i get email and reply, i see 3D right now, it seems
crawling in the room, out of the womb.
ready for action my arm moves away from the face,
away from the face, into space.
i can see my hand at a slightly greater distance
for instance.
turning my head, the display seems to play, there
are other things to see in 3D.
the sound follows me, will follow me, bad music
around the corner like a lurking sojourner.
closing my eyes puts my scan into sleep mode,
i hibernate next to the road.
i know no good will come from this, i look down,
frown, my finger lingers over a key, see?
the key with the question holds me in rapture,
it's a contraption.
philosophy is one as well, a contraption holding
no one in thrall, we're here that's all.
a moment to lament, the 3D lady has gone away
this rainy day.

"The often atrocious circumstances of our struggle made
it possible, in a word, for us to live out that unbearable,
heart-rending situation known as the human condition in a
candid, unvarnished way."

- Sartre

[13B hello hello. there is static on the line. it is difficult to ransack 
memory in this fashion. i am garcia. i understand there is a message.

worst, the very w worst of snows.
[7Cyes, we waited and waited for each other, didn't we. and it seemed 
almos almost as if it was to no avail. do yoyu u remember how man enacing 
the world seemed, how hopeless. and now. -

Rhapsody

i want to save this for you. 
i want you to know my hands moved thus and thus.
my fingers moved thus and thus. once upon a time.
when i was still alive. and then these sounds emerged.
these sounds from the movement of my fingers thus and thus.
that i did this. that i could do this. 
that at one time someone moved thus and thus. 
that these sounds emerged and in this order. 
that there was breath and all the signs of life.
that life produced these sounds, a living being.
a living being breathed and his fingers moved.
and his hands moved and his arms moved.
his hands and arms moved thus, this living being.
this inheritance, this sequence, this rhapsody.
this rhapsody of life, persevering after death.
this rhapsody, thus, and thus, and thus.

Rhapsody acoustic-electric guitar (originally made by Stella made by 
Harmony around 1947) played as acoustic, three studies

Virtual


[Thinking about the discussion on Netbehaviour, I did a cull of 'virtual' 
within a textual grouping, tightened the syntax, and produced the follow- 
ing - a form of virtual theory, circumambulating the subject and process 
of thought, production nonetheless.]

Virtual matter, one ends with ellipsis ... 'my three little dots' ... 
Nikuko: Social philosophy is always virtual. Julu: Every word you say is 
virtual; words are not for eating. The virtual world is described; it's 
choice / intentionality. The virtual world is chosen; it's within a 
potential well; it has both internal and external loci of subjectivities 
in relation to spewing-forth in real or virtual, however defined; in a 
sense virtual worlds, are subsets. Virtual worlds are always already 
as-if; there's nothing else to them. The body, inscribed, is already 
virtual; the virtual world, embodied, is polarities, circumscriptions, of 
virtuals and reals. Suturing in virtual worlds: coherent physics, 
discordant continuity, words; in virtual worlds, one's avatar is present 
or not present, 'alive' - but the virtual body is not always there.

One need not ingest or excrete (unless it is written into the virtual 
world itself); it need not sleep, does not get sick, and so forth. There 
are problematic issues of ontology of real life: virtual particles, 
information, and so forth, just as there are problematic issues of 
ontology of virtual worlds: mathesis/inscription - manifestations.

In virtual worlds, information may be classified, transmitted. But 
there's a distinction between the ontic emptiness of real and virtual 
worlds. Between dreams, hallucinations, etc. and a concrete or virtual 
arising there seems to be a radical difference, evident in the mixed 
ontology of of hierarchical data-bases, but virtual worlds can split.

Is mathesis the fundamental operation in virtual worlds? I'm thinking of 
virtual worlds as abstracted, split, chosen, programmed: given, born-into: 
thought as conceiving. Consider virtual worlds _not_ as subsets of real 
life - as fulcrums. Again, in virtual worlds, the body as entangled 
projections or introjections elicits non-traditional diegetic functioning 
or logical grounds. I argue this is a basis for being, not only in the 
virtual, but also within the real.

It's the complete seamlessness of virtuality that we have achieved - the 
artificial intelligence of virtual reality is well ahead of schedule. 
Virtuality is _driven_ in fact. (Could this be the difference, the 
_driven_ of the virtual, in relation to the obduracy of the real - i.e. 
against the the exigencies of virtuality, the age we find ourselves in?

The virtual bites into the visible; you never see the skeleton of the 
virtual, however; everything dissolves into inscription, mathesis. 
Everything in the virtual real world is inscribed, including ontology. And 
in dreams... real and virtual coalesce, ascii-dreams, livid dreams, maroon



Three Pipa Pieces

Three Koboz Songs

slow and simple, representing the sadness of the day
the decline of the social in the united states
the misery of the middle and lower 'classes'
creation of hopelessness, sickness, and poverty
the elderly longing for enough to eat
the virulant hatreds proffered as explanations

"The," Suzie said, "skein." Travis, "Yes."
Meantime, a slow fadeout occurs; the buzzing sensation is slightly a
nighttime wakening, fingers in me, golden metal nuzzling teeth
for "A fun relationship in Every way," the straw hair of Suzanne, 
eyes of ruffled cloth, there were moments of gauze, wet, you could see

(it's an outline of gauze, stretched to the limit,  it's always damp, as

buzzing puzzles!

Speaker says, "Cyberspatial buzzing .... huge amounts of ..." turn
always to a news station; it helps with the buzz. The bed's to my rear; 
when the buzz gets bad, I'll lie on it, setting my account to "biff y,"

two cormorants in the Gowanus Canal

^ i don't know how they survive in the misery
of poisoned waters, drained from death and horror
^ if i had talent i'd write a waka
about the memory of these brilliant cormorants
^ all i can do is play the pipa and struggle
with pipa, with cormorants, hoping that some, beauty

The neoliberalist dilemma of hiding behind a truck 
while a nighttime commercial is shot for American Express /
Mastercard at a posh toystore around the corner through 
artificial snow and many happy Christmas packages none of us
can afford but you'll be able to see our happy happy neighbor/hood
anytime you want on the local telly, special effects brought to you
by wonderful 15usd stoop sale mini-camcorder hiding in my sweater
while like a coward i avoided the great financiers groveling inside
and outside the windows of commerce and Christmastime spendfree
delight.
