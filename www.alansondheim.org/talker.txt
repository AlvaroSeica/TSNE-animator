around, a light mist starts to fall...You realize that you should 
soon make your way into the Virtual City that awaits you...

You are at the upstairs

Here in the upstairs corridor are the entrances to the office of 
the manager and to some private rooms for more secretive 
customers. If you want to reserve one of those, then talk to the 
manager. Floor is covered with soft carpet and on the wall are 
candle-shaped lamps.

You are at the blue_room

You are in the Blue Room. King-size bed dominates the room. Couple 
of chairs, a couch, desk under the window, cabinet in the corner 
and a bath. Everything you might need during a business trip or a 
love affair.

Laurie says: Gerald was somewhere around, I wonder where he's 
gone.
Laurie says: He was speaking of clouds and travel.
Susan smiles: Yes, of course, and windows to the abyss.
Laurie says: Always these spaces are so unnerving.
Susan winks: Now you sound like Gerald!
Laurie says: Men, remain at home. Women, explore the wilderness.
Laurie says: Tentatively we will all meet at the plaza.

You are at the central_park

It's a beautiful sunny day.  You begin to daydream as you gaze 
past the swans swimming around the the beautiful glass-like lake.  
A light summer's breeze blows in carrying the light scent of 
lilacs.  You lay down your blanket and open up your picinic 
basket, ready to enjoy a relaxing afternoon in the park. ...right 
now you don't have a care in the world....

[ A rewrite of a narrative; I spent some time looking for a talker, a form 
of chat and architecture popular before the Web, still online. This is the 
only one I found, in Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me a name 
and password. I went in and explored and rewrote the 'review' dialog, 
which was a remnant of Estonians who had been in the talker before. So 
they were ghosts. I didn't understand their dialog - it was in Estonian 
and I thought in any case publishing would be a violation of privacy. So I 
wrote my own dialog as a result, substituting for theirs. It was an eerie 
space. - Alan ]



The ghosts speak, themselves, the ghosts speak themselves


The ghosts speak, themselves: the ghosts speak themselves

done here and elsewhere in america in latvia
in germany in virtual city in estonia in arenaland
where i have misbehaved in deep misbehavior
:cries i can never absolve myself i have no freedom
:weeps i can move neither to the left nor right

cry my beloved homeland, weep lands of mothers and fathers
call me forth and call me back towards the winter walls
towards the wolves and foxes towards the merlin and eagle
for the eagle shall destroy the server and the wolf the client
i weep for nothing has prepared me for this coming forth
this coming towards the horizon of darkness
i carry this within me i break myself against it i log out
my name obscure see that thing there is weeping
those shoulders hunched the head bowed the folded body
bowed the arms and legs bowed the neck the torso crushed
it lies there it is a stain it folds up it disappears
the stars go on it isn't for them
it isn't for the sun or moon either it isn't for the air
it has wound itself tight it has spiraled into control
spiraled: into control
in estonia it is gone from me in germany it is gone in latvia
in arena land in lithuania it is gone from me in america
it has never been in america in virtual city
it has never been anywhere and will never be anywhere
it is gone weeping just as one might say
"He is gone from the city and maybe has left the country"
"And quit, I think he's quit now, I'm almost certain."
