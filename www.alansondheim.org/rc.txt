They form a set with the others. I've been thinking about avatar subject- 
ivity, about the relationship between subject and subjectivity, between 
movement and movement-deconstruction, about fauns. The sound in all of 
them has been separately edited; the aural space with earphones is 
somewhat in front of the movement-image, somewhat behind the viewer.

Philosophy of the Archive


Directory trees - paths and files - of my digital work in preparation for 
archives at Cornell. Interesting structures emerge. The trees have been 
edited to eliminate files that might incriminate others. I like to think 
about 'incrimination.' I like to think about that power. I like to think 
it is the last power I have. I like to think.

Sunset over Odyssey

http://www.alansondheim.org/sunset.mp4

Sunset over Odyssey, invisibility waving in the distance.
The Natural World, the World of Nature, has its own time and place,
presenting us with uncanny and peerless beauty.
There is no place for us in the Natural World; as Adorno would say,
we lead damaged lives.
Among these lives, these memories.

aaugmented

http://www.alansondheim.org/man2.jpg

1. aaugmented by the psychoanalytics of theatrical architecture, the text, 
perhaps aaugmented by telephone: voice in one form or another, always 
aaugmented by others; any response plays into or across, transgressive and 
assembled in another way, or otherwise media poetry, and aaugmented chor- 
eography. the event will be followed by a augmented choreography. easy to 
slip from aaugmented reality or virtual worlds or virtual reality techno- 
logy, aaugmented and diminished realities, theory and daily life. the 
categories are aaugmented by open content, which usually aaugments my 
inhabitation, devours me; i live as you dream a dream of a book of nature, 
aaugmented by a dream of universal reason. the body had been aaugmented, 
invaded, and now became a host aaugmented by global communications sys- 
tems. so i began using aaugmented chords, i began using diminished chords, 
i jumped, aaugmented by the psychoanalytics of theatrical architecture, 
the fifths, aaugmented chords, and a number of major unadulterated chords.

2. or are you tired of repetition. aaugmented by possibilities of teledil- 
donics, wearable computation, aaugmented reality, aaugmented moving space, 
monitor-goggles providing locative theory? circumscription is aaugmented, 
undercut here. it's incandescent anthropological theory, circumscribed 
enterprise, empire's sadly aaugmented screen. meanwhile on another contin- 
ent, azure's dancing a true computer-aaugmented dance performances. the 
yaw performance space series of computer-aaugmented dance performances. 
the yaw.

3. easy to slip from aaugmented reality or virtual worlds or virtual real- 
ity technology, aaugmented and diminished realities, theory and daily 
life. invasions of the imaginary, invasions of capital, of the aaugmented 
real, may be used in virtual worlds, in mannequin software, or for 
aaugmented ruptures of the body by an aaugmented real. and in terms of 
codes or replaced or aaugmented codes or scripts or objects, the basic 
operations of annihilation are completely reproducible - each is another 
take yet on the aaugmented human body, aaugmented prosthetically, by the 
market and creative possibilities of teledildonics. among the remnants of 
aaugmented reality maquettes - what was aaugmented is background, the 
abject which leaks, closure aaugmented by purity, revolving within, the 
horizon of death and despair, the dying avatar, the deadatar...

Big Failures of Identity!


How many avatars are there?
In the image? In the world?
How many things are they doing in the world?
Avatars drop like rain does from the clouds in the sky.
But like virga they disappear before they hit the ground.
"The mark of the blank is missing."
But what is equivalent here? I think maybe the pixels.
But aren't they addressable? Of course they are!
The avatars are another thing! Big failures of identity!

Virtuoso Guitar

parlor guitar, circa 1890-1920, recently reset; it has remarkable 
resonance (may be a Larson Bros. student model). I've recorded with
it before, but now it sounds more beautiful than ever and doesn't
need the contact mic I worked with. Enjoy.

Also, sounds from radio blackout from the heat-wave, processed:

they are furious distortions 



waves warez and Juarez

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/turnwav.mp3 Mathematica-
generated sound plus coda. this is over an hour long,
almost entirely minimal; the soundforms were created by
formula. around 2005.

http://alansondheim.org/juarez1.mp4 with Dawnja Burris,
shot in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, this is a somewhat
edited segment. around 1992-3. it stills seems prescient.



Why not. Why not.

Why not. Because the background doesn't move.
Those things just stand there. The front twirls.
My usual in an old-fashioned way. Just watching the twirl.
It doesn't go anywhere. It has the consistency of paste.
It's slightly uncomfortable. It's not uncomfortable enough.
Never ever works out in this wide world. 
There are Julu Twine and Alan Dojoji mocking each other.
And in the foreground, this rubbery creature.
This creature that looks like it might stick to you.
Like it might do something untoward.
Just by its presence, just by its appearance or appearing.

Do check out http://www.alansondheim.org/juarez1.mp4 if you haven't;
it's worth it. Juarez may well be the most dangerous city on earth
now - you can see why in this 1993 short segment of Postmodern 
Sureno, which I'll post later, when and if I can convert from the 
dvd I found.



I used to be good.

I used to 'really have it' as they say. That was 'really something.'
I could turn out the magic without even thinking.
I was master of the image, master of the image programs.
I'd have an idea, just like that. And I'd make the idea _happen._
Here's an example: http://www.alansondheim.org/stranges.mp4 .
Here's another: http://www.alansondheim.org/stranges2.mp4 .
Brilliant! I couldn't possibly do these now!
I don't know what happened, but I have a theory: the Republicans.
It must have been the Republicans. It can't possibly be a coincidence.
The Republicans come in; my images go south as they say.
That's not an insult to the South. That's just an expression.
I'm sure that's just an expression. And I won't be side-tracked.
The Republicans would side-track me. Look at these images!
Look at the skills I had! I haven't made anything this good for years!
Not since the Republicans came in! I can't afford anything any more!
My mind's a shambles. My mind's ground to a halt.
It's the fault of the Republicans! I'm sure there's more to say about
this but I'm not sure what it is. I used to know what it is, but I 
don't know; my mind's blurry, I can hardly keep track of anything and
I don't have any ideas any more. I don't even know to to end this.
All I remember is that I used to be brilliant and I look at these
stunning images and say wow to myself and I know I can't do anything
this good now and the Republicans are running around my mind like
vermin. In fact I like vermin but I don't like Republicans! I used to
be so good!



e-very

I propose the word "e-very" for electronically-very, as in "This piece of 
email is e-very excellent, don't you think?". From here it will be a very 
short step to "every" which parallels "email" as in, "This definition 
which I'm sending you now is every astute, I do declare!". Please spread 
the word on this and it will every quickly go viral! Thank you, signed, 
The Every Luscious Jennifer

wounded avatar. aporia.


it's always someone else who writes this.
it's always someone else who is sick.
up until the limit, it's you, not myself, who is sick.
at the limit, i am gone, not even leaving a gift, leaving nothing.
at the limit, it is someone else who receives a gift.
the gift comes from nowhere. the gift is an object in the world.
the gift is a labeled object in the world. or an unknown object.
the avatar who is sick is a gift. the avatar who disappears is a gift.
the avatar leaves nothing behind. or the avatar leaves everything.
the avatar leaves everything but leaves everything to no one.
the pain of a wounded avatar is infinite. an avatar cannot speak.
an avatar is always spoken for and hir pain is stolen.

the wounded avatar is at the heart of the problematic of culture.
the wounded avatar is the heart of the problematic.
wounding is the erasure of the grounding of inscription.
the wounded avatar is the inscription of wounding
and the wounding of inscription:
it is within this field that materiality dissolves, 
meeting oncoming death face to face, in the sense of alterity.
the field blocks everything; the field does not exist.
the avatar says: it is over when i say it is over. 
the avatar is wounded.
