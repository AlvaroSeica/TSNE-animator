10 Stelarc is an Australian artist who has revolutionized our thinking 
20 about being online, about the interface of body and technology, and
30 about the distinctions between humans and software agents - among
40 other things. This article is a series of fragments stemming from a
50 long-term interest in Stelarc's work; it isn't a review per se. For
60 more information on Stelarc, go to www.google.com and enter his 
70 name; as of this writing, 5770 sites will come up. Meanwhile, what
80 follows is a wandering through issues of real and virtual subjectiv-
/  ity,
90 Stelarc the dispersed and central focus of attention.

*/  a messy article. take The Cybercultures Reader (Bell and Kennedy):  
representative/canonic Stelarc on the cover, with the only images in
the book, carrying the body of net art, net.art, in the post-(cyber)bodies
section. Canonic, because clear, emblematic, and lucid work, a work whose 
doubts might be buried in the protocols themselves. on one hand, an isol- 
ated unique work (oeuvre, here); on the other, a work slipped among human, 
virtual, and technological interfacings. a work of simultaneous machinic 
and fleshly insistence: the alter/altar ego presenced uneasily on your 
machine, unnerving in a manner oddly reminiscent of Andy Kaufman's tele- 
vision network comedy performances. /*

<--  a work which grows with, towards the future - a body of work changing 
in relation to changing technology, miniaturization, nanotech, increased 
computer firepower. a work which is therefore never completed, responsive 
to technological innovation and growth, an increasingly immersive work - 
the periphery or the shadow of the body in or among computers or in or 
among nets. his recent Movatar piece (developing) engages him as an (off- 
line) agent of an (online) agent: a clear model for future developments of 
virtual subjectivity. From Stelarc's "From Psycho-Body to Cyber-Systems, 
Images as post-human entities" in ibid.: "Consider though a virtual body 
or an avatar that can access a physical body, actuating it to perform in 
the real world." this begins to take care of interface issues from a phil- 
osophical viewpoint; now philosophers will have to learn protocol ethos 
and aesthetics. i mean this literally. elsewhere Stelarc states "The 
nature of both bodies and images has been significantly altered. IMAGES 
ARE NO LONGER ILLUSORY WHEN THEY BECOME INTERACTIVE." in the next article 
in ibid. (Mark Dery, "Ritual Mechanics") Fakir Musafar is quoted: -->

# "Where I think Stelarc is missing the point is that ... [w]e've gotten 
to the point where we can synthesize magic, technology and science. You 
listen to the babblings of the best physicists we have today, [and] they 
sound like the alchemists used to." well, i don't think they do, but with 
the entrance of magic (or magick) into (what passes for) the equation, 
issues of fetishization come up. think of the dirt/bone/fingernail fetish 
or the wood/feather/tar fetish and immediately the categories of the 
imminent and unclean appear (something Parmenides brings up to Socrates as 
"mud"); filth, Kristeva's abject, breaks virtual/real and any other 
schemes down to _there,_ where holes and bodies are intertwined with old 
technology, dark aspirations, gleaming cabinets of viscera and far-future 
storage capabilities. categories are sloughed like snakeskin. there's an 
uneasy aura to Stelarc's work, conditioned in part by his past body-sus- 
pension pieces (with hooks through the skin); one might say that bodies 
float free (as in dreams) but always at a cost (as in dreams). #

[- "My concern about post-modernist deconstruction and appropriation is
that it ultimately becomes so self-referential that it falls into an
incestuous discourse and spirals back into itself and doesn't plot an
alternate or new strategies and trajectories. That's what's so intriguing
about new technologies." (Stelarc in Live Art Letters, #3 Feb. 98: "Obso-
lete Body/Alternate Strategies - Listening to Stelarc," Robert Ayers.)
Stelarc's OPTIMISM - an exhilaration centered on the indefinite explora-
tion of networkings, opened futures into opened futures. it's the next
step, and then and then - eliminate the exoskeleton (there goes robotics)
(there goes Panamarenko) - great loopings in the worlds - great openings -
you can see them beyond & among the clouds & where the pixels end, when
the pod won't move any farther, when the screen enlarges walls & mountains
to rectangles of bloated pixels & you're begging for greater bandwidth &
you've got to build more & add more apparatus & add storage STORAGE - -]

<!-- he's among centuries, among theatricality and 19th-century melodrama,
Wagner, Beuys, the diorama, spectacle (one might think of a futurebook
Spectacle of the Society, no?) - among mechanisms, especially hydraulics
(back to the Freudian model, applied to the motility of the body), elect-
ronics, pure MECHANISM - but also among virtualities (multiple presencings
of bodies, interiors and exteriors of bodies, inversions and transforma-
tions of bodies) --!>

# REM Brian Rotman's Ad Infinitum: The Ghost in Turing's Machine: Taking
God Out of Mathematics and Putting the Body Back In - just as it was
almost safe to sinter the other way around, turning byte and bite into ash
and powder - towards the elimination of the transcendental - i'd also say
the technological sublime. Stelarc poses all of this in clear models,
deficient, if at all, in considerations of gender - Irigarayan flux
replaced by confined air or liquid, fluid mechanics transformed into
digital horizons. the returning, re-turning, of the body is that of the
theoretically ungendered male, as in "mankind's technological progress,"
although one references Sandy Stone and The Cyborg Manifesto (Harraway) as
well. in other respects (sinter), he considers the body in pain, but the
pain is chosen, existential, necessary; it's not the surplus pain of
fibromyalgia or cancer, the unaccountable pain of war or wounding, the
accountable pain of thirst and hunger (as if agencies were disposed among
accountancies). the pain is related to what suspends or moves the body; it
is a residue or byproduct, but one can't over look the effect of pain on
the exaltation or fascination of the spectator. REM #

*// "PHANTOM LIMB/VIRTUAL ARM: Amputees often experience a phantom limb.  
It is now possible to have a phantom sensation of an additional arm - a
virtual arm - albeit visual rather than visceral." (Stelarc in "From
Psycho-Body" ..) teledildonics theoretically extends virtuality to full-
skin contact; bandwidth increases enormously beyond that of an addition-
al arm, robotics. i keep coming up against issues of flesh and bandwidth -
robotics, cyborg paraphernalia, works vis-a-vis a mapping of points or
nodes - not surfaces, certainly not the panoply of surfaces that consti-
tutes the real body in real space (it would take a riemannian topology to
even approach this. even the abstract mappings, then, return to an
earlier, nineteenth-century, era of formal (cartesian) geometries; pro-
sthetic arms reflect, for example, the arm-holders in some early mach-
ines (used well into the twentieth century) which had a human operator;
she (usually) would assemble, for example, parts to be punched out; the
punch would descend; the arm-holders would pull her arms out of the way;
the punch would ascend; the arm-holders would release her. one waits for a
new and radically different ontology, one based on pure dispersion (yet
somehow romantically embedding the full flesh of the body), networking,
absorption and integrations of others - of pure alterity. in other words,
there is a dream afloat, of womb-returning, of perfect security and
comfort, of losing oneself and living forever online. in this dream, the
Other is defused in fusion; there are no strangers ... Stelarc crosses his
body with early-early tech; parts are left behind; he'd perhaps leave the
whole behind; i'd bring the hole back in. *//

## interviewing Stelarc in Albany, 10/16/00. "Don't be so surprised!"
followed by the world-famous laugh. i can't hear my questions at the
beginning, but they concern pain. i feel idiotic; i _insist_ on the
relationship to pain, "I won't admit to that." he explains about the need
to support rather than suspend the body. "The skin would become kind of a
support structure for the body itself." the first suspension event
actually occurred in Japan, after one in Adelaide was canceled. there
were 27 of these. the performances came after a series of sensory
deprivation events, in some of which he stitched his mouth and eyelids
shut. there was "something psychologically difficult" for him to insert
the hooks (for the suspension events) - something related to the way the
hooks "slithered through the skin." levels of difficulty: inserting the
hooks, connecting them to the cables, putting the tension on them.  
Stelarc says "the body" instead of "my body" constantly here. "The body is
seen as a kind of evolutionary object, architecture of awareness." he
doesn't see the body as "a kind of individual" or "site of the psyche."
And as a performance artist "It gets kind of boring to say 'I did this and
I did that.'" i continue to wonder about this, the insertion of an
anti-shifter as "the" actually defuses the individuation of "my," creates
again a kind of distancing. but there is also a beauty in this trope; so
much performance art is centered (to whatever depth it may aspire to) on
_the_ body of _the_ performer, and perhaps we really don't need those
heroes. there's an enormous generosity in "the body" which could be
anyone's here. ##

<-!- "Most of these suspension events were done in remote locations or
private gallery spaces." ..."personal history becomes intertwined with all
of this." Stelarc was a squash coach in Japan; he also did yoga for twenty
years. for some reason, i find this fascinating - whether or not it
connects formally to his work. yoga helped him "do these actions with a
certain calm." he doesn't tense up, try to resist what was going on. we're
still discussing the earlier work. "I've never had an out-of-body experi-
ence." not expecting transcendence, he didn't get it. "The idea was to see
the body as a sculptural medium which was situated in a space with other
objects." i'm thinking of the piece Sitting / Swaying Event for Rock
Suspension, Tamura Gallery, Tokyo - 11 May, 1980, Stelarc suspended naked,
sitting in mid-air, held there by hooks (as usual) - the other ends of the
cables going to a ring of rocks surrounding him, also in mid-air. "The
process was extremely difficult" from the insertions to raising the body
to releasing the rocks which acted as counterweights. "All of these per-
formances were pretty much one-off." why do i recount this here, including
a performance in Japan in which the hooks were accidently inserted back-
wards, had to be taken out, and reinserted, to fair pain? because of an
insistence on simultaneous language and body - an insistence in which the
flesh, for the spectator, is up-front and personal. one moves through this
fullness across the apparatus, the cables, taking consciousness and mind
(if it were separable from the body, or at least connected somewhere
beyond the nodal points of the body) along; the cables - wires - are
everywhere throughout Stelarc's work, and they're not far behind, as well,
any Web art, net art, hyperlink or net.art, as well. connections and
potential connections, with their protocols and embeddings, are everywhere
in new media work; even cdrom work possesses the appearance of slippage,
linked files, transmissions. -!->

REM Marina Abramovich, Ulay, Chris Burden, Gina Pane, Vito Acconci. Stel-
arc lived in Japan 1970-89; he was "removed from both the American and
European art scenes." "I love Buto." Stelarc is close to it; he mentions
his interest in Noh, Bunraku, Kabuki, but the influence has never been
direct. "The focus on the western side of substance and material and the
focus on the eastern side of process" - and i cut him off, foolishly, with
a another question. "I would write the kanji on the windscreen and as I
was driving I would try and match up" (laughter). "I loved the fact I
could just simply switch off, that I didn't have to speak to people all
the time." "It was my father's ill health that I went back to Australia."
"The first things I made in artschool were helmets and goggles" that
created a "kinetic sound and light environment for the body." "I made a
film of the inside of my stomach, lungs, and colon, about three meters of
internal space, between 1973- 1975." "The third hand took five years to
construct." an "oscillation between physically difficult performances and
technologically complicated ones." "Sometimes the suspension events were
amplified. Sometimes my third hand was attached." "The third hand is going
to be sold by internet auction last week of October/first week of November
(2000). I've got a new arm that slips over your right arm, with a manipu-
lator at the end of it." "This new manipulator has thumb and wrist rota-
tion and each finger is a gripper in itself." REM

** "Switches that you're able to preprogram complex sampled movements."
"You play the hand like a keyboard." "That's counterpointed by my left arm
which is involuntarily jerked around by eight channels of muscle stimula-
tion." muscle stimulation is critical in much of Stelarc's work - a
translation from voluntary net/work into involuntary body/labor. what is
the exterior of the body? the interior? is mind in interface and wire? is
it remote? the _remote_ presence is also critical, sensing the other; i
wonder if there is a faceless alterity that doesn't devolve into Big
Brother. **

^ "I have thought of two remote bodies that would be in control of half
of the other's body." "Your suggestion is intriguing, the idea that
via the internet, via a website with vrml and a surrogate body as an
interface, one can construct an extended loop of operation within one
body." i begin asking about the performance aspects of the work - on 
one hand, concerned with internal issues and experience, and on the
other, work that's theatrical, really designed for an audience. "I
think what we would call the theatrical aspects, I wouldn't see as that
to the extent that the performance isn't really structured for an audi-
ience." i make another interruption here, Stelarc laughs. "What I'm
saying is that the intent is not, as it is with most theater, to enter-
tain an audience. Most people can't stay for very long; the sounds are
amplified excruciatingly loud." "The idea is how can one visually and
acoustically can one manifest this operation of the body and third 
hand" ... he talks about the performance i saw in Perth - Wagnerian,
intense, driven, sound occupying the entire enormous room, splashes of
video cuseeme on the walls, enormous depths of sonority, Stelarc re-
sponding to external muscle play. it was overwhelming. he talks about
sound-video-body-interplay as theatrical elements making manifest what
is going on - but not theater. he's clear about that. i continue inaud-
ibly on the tape. i hate, now, listening to my interruptions. "When I
first saw Buto it reminded me of seeing bodies as some sort of post-
nuclear zombie-like entities, where the way they functioned was not a
purely internally driven state of operation, but was inextricably 
connected to the other bodies in the space, the contour of the perfor-
mance area, and so on." ^

/* now i am given the mike for some reason, and we're talking about
karaoke. at one point Stelarc sang Waltzing Matilda. i begin with an
(audible) question. i talk about (re: above) robotics in general as
19th century - Cruikshank's images, etc. once you're past the input
stage, information stage - then i begin talking about Merlin Donald's
notion of the mind transformed (Stelarc interrupts; i hear "outmoded"
from the other side of the room) carrying intellect outside the phys-
ical body - databases as literal extensions of neural networks for 
example. i talk about internal and external a distinction no longer
worth making, that the mind is inside and outside, etc. i say to him
his work has an odd split - on one hand diorama 19th-century and on
the other 21st century epistemology - Andy Hawks' "mind in the wires."
i turn the microphone back to Stelarc. "Firstly the idea that the
technology is dated, firstly we have to remember that as an artist 
this person is not interested in sci-fi explanations of what might 
come but" what one can do now. "At the moment I'm not going to be able
to clone my own body, to create nanomachines to insert, to grow other
organs." "I can only do what is possible, what's accessible, what I
can experience now. So to that extent I'm using technology that's not
necessarily at the cutting-edge, but technology I can construct with
the help of others, and that I'm experiencing now." "People are in-
trigued by the mechanics of the things." "These technologies that I 
use aren't as clunky as people make them out to be. When the first
third hand was constructed, I was invited to give talks at JPL in
Houston. Even now, the third hand is the most sophisticated commerc-
ially-available prosthetic device." he talks about the stomach sculp-
ture, a site-specific work inserted into his stomach - one references
perhaps automatons, etc. - but only references; the technology is not
old-fashioned. in the distance, i press my case; luckily, i'm inaudi-
ble. */

"" i feel Stelarc begins with body; i begin with mind. i think mind 
is an imaginary inhabitation, which is not to say unreal, but irreal, 
problematic. Stelarc for me exemplifies behaviorism with mind follow-
ing, following suit; but it is a behaviorism of explicit cognitive
functions as well - it would be able to absorb, for example, the work
on scripts and goals in classical AI; it also dwells in Winograd's
microworlds - as well as in his later discussions of failure. in fact,
one might carry Stelarc's approach to "the mind is a muscle" (i forget
who said this), a comment out of dance - and there are great similari-
ties between his work and dance; i think of Cunningham's choreography
which often stems from computer programs, bending the dancers' bodies
into computed forms at variance from "natural" attitudes and possibil-
ities. (now i will listen to more of the interview, embarrassed and
pressing forward.) "If we're going to argue that certain technologies
are obsolete, we can also argue that the body is obsolete." we can't
rid ourselves of our bodies altogether. it's that "this body" - its
operation in an intense information environment where machines function
at incredible speed - the question is, do we retain this biological 
body as it is (as a prosthetic body) or do we think about more "intim-
ate" interface. in the past, prostheses were ergonomic. now we should
think about redesigning the body to fit the possibilities of machines
instead of the other way around. "What I don't agree with is this 
notion that we can start talking about minds and mental operations as
seemingly disconnected from bodies." "Projecting and extruding aware-
ness - does not cut the physicality of the body off from the mind." 
"What are we pointing to when we are pointing to the word 'mind'?"
"Some sort of floating intelligence which is nowhere located." Stelarc
is critical of this, of course. listening now, i find i agree with 
him, or do i? i can't hear what i'm saying. the apparatus is poor at a
distance, the earphones are picking up buzz from the plasma screen...
we talk about the recent Book/Ends conference here in Albany. "When the
language designates 'I' for most people what this actually means for
them is 'I' something spiritual something mental is using this body
to exist in the world." "But language only says 'this body does this,
this body does that.' It doesn't reveal a greater existence, a greater
essence." "If I say 'this body thinks something' what this body is 
saying is 'this body's behavior is a manifestation of a complex history
and interaction with other bodies and institutions at this point in
history - it's not an internal homunculus that is doing the thinking.
Nothing is doing, I mean when we think, there is nothing inside the 
body which is doing the thinking, it's the body's awareness in the world
that's constructing its intelligence and awareness." "I'm much more
sympathetic to a behaviorist approach than to a mentalist approach if
we have to make a choice." "I'm talking about how mental phenomena are
appropriated as if they are an internal essence or mind." "Language
doesn't designate or clarify; it also confuses us." "The word 'I' does
not designate an internal subject; it designates this body." am i writ-
ing what here? i keep up with Stelarc's conversation, i collapse lines,
phrases, coalesce without realization, try to do justice, i can't repro-
duce tone, the sound of the laugh, the occasional gaiety in the room.
there are others present, occasionally commenting, Nicole Peyrafitte,
Azure Carter, Pierre Joris, i think perhaps others, but i'm not sure,
there are cats certainly, the park outside, i worry about taking too 
much time up, we're all aware surely of bodies here, attitudes, affect,
i find myself aware of Albany, the conference dispersing. i'd known 
Stelarc since Perth 96, then through the Incubation conference in Not-
tingham, now here. there were hellos passed back and forth through
mutual acquaintances. i don't know him well at all. what comes through
is this generosity... ""

>>-- "To be an intelligent agent, I need to be both embodied and embed-
ded in the world." i can't hear myself again, i do hear the mention of
Lakoff and Lakoff, Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things, the embedding of
language in the body (Lingis would be another reference), i'm still 
hammering this point home, the primacy or latitudinality (at the least)
of the body. we're talking about the California ideology, "this mix of
spirituality and corporatism," this "yearning to escape the body, a lot
of Internet experience is articulated in this way and it's very irri-
tating." i'm mumbling again. now i'm really going on. is it myself or
my agent who is speaking? is it my agency? --<<

$$ "I really think it's a problem how we speak about these things." $$

[> "The body has been augmented, invaded, and now becomes a host - not
only for technology, but also for remote agents. Just as the internet
provides extensive and interactive ways of displaying, linking and
retrieving the body information and images, it may now allow unexpected
ways of accessing, interfacing, and uploading the body itself." (Stelarc,
Ars Electronica Facing the Future '99.) but it seems to me that this
interview (now _that_ interview) is already messing things up - who said
what, where, when. "When we speak, we speak in terms of convenience" - "as
long as we recognize the process of language and the fact that seemingly
speaking as a first person subject - there's no doubt it's something
convenient and of an evolutionary balance" - "but how much that free will
and free agency applies in the real world" - "associative chain of
operation" - "my decision is part of that" - "but it's only a part of that
complex interaction" - "knowing that you were here, that this might be a
good conference to come to" - "someone had to invite me" - "that chance
meeting in Perth" - "it's just that we function _as if_ we are minds in
the world _as if_ we have free will and agency - it's to our advantage to
function as if we have these things" - "a huge leap to appropriate the 'I'
as if it were an internal homunculus" - i think i'm pointing out here,
however, that 'the world has a certain style,' that the style is largely
consistent, that it permits us to function. <]

*/* i talk about subsumption architecture. i ask him if he ever thought
of taking the six-legged robotic walking machine and turning it subsump-
tion. "The fascination for me was that the modes of locomotion would be
controlled by arm gestures so that your bipedal walking gate would be
translated into a six-legged insect-like machine." "Having a sense of 
what it's like to navigate the world with six legs instead of two, hav-
ing to remap." "The body's not simply standing on the machine, the body
gets wrapped up in the machine mechanism, one that's sort of integrated
into the machine." "So that was the real reason of doing it." subsump-
tion architecture employs the idea of constructing simple robots using
insects as a model. in the 60s the idea was that if you had an intelli-
gent robot, you had to have one with a big brain that could model every-
thing around it. now you might have a robot with a limited or minimal
brain, existing within an intelligent environment and so behaving intel-
ligently. and this idea has excited me; i think about Merlin Donald 
again, and mind, not in the waters, but everywhere, and the residue of
mind being in fact certain behaviors of part-time entities within the
environment, which, again, extends, everywhere... "When you put that 
type of robot in the world you begin to notice emergent behavior. This
seems intelligent behavior. Then there was the realization that the
sophisticated behavior of the insect was the result of the complexity
of the world it's embedded in." "If one sees human bodies in a somewhat
similar way, their intelligence and awareness and operational possibili-
ties are determined by the technologies they've constructed, the 
institutions within which they operate, their cultures, and so on."
"There's a danger in going to one extreme or another." one might focus
too much on the homunculus inside or on the other, "if we go into an
operational holistic kind of viewpoint, you explain everything and
nothing in one go." */*

--| "The shadow projection of the body on the machine creates this
wonderful hybrid human/machine image." i keeping pushing my useless point
about adding subsumption architecture to the six-legged robot. "What
interests me are the ambiguities and slippages in the interface - I'm not
interested in being totally virtual or totally physical - the interest is
not on those sorts of realms of operations so on one hand I'm very
interested in the virtual domain and how one might function within it and
on the other how the physical body might interact with it. And with the
Movatar performance, an intelligence avatar can access a physical body and
perform with it in the real world. This body becomes a prosthesis in the
world for an avatar." i'm mumbling again. i know Stelarc's got to go. "In
a way it's neither art in the traditional sense or science in the
methodical research sense. You're performing somewhere in-between those
and you're exploring what's neither science or art in the traditional
sense of those words." "Exploring the interface in a sense undermines
either extreme." "It's neither virtual nor actual." ... "I haven't used
the walking machine outdoors although we almost did." i'm mumbling, i
can't hear myself again on the machine. i fade in and out. interviewing,
querying, is problematic in the first place, a question of mastery, of
playing to the wall, of simulated two-way conversation. phraseology and
power swim like rivers beneath the surface. conversation about the wonder
of Stelarc's laugh again. i love the optimism (in particular, in relation
to the mournful air of deconstruction at the Book/Ends conference). now
i'm louder, 'How much time do you have?' i ask. "I think she's coming
about 12:15" he replies. --|

~~ i'm back yammering about intelligent agents transforming into minds
beyond the julia bot on the internet, free-floating packets of information
- and i relate this to the Movatar piece. i say i think this is a way for
the Internet to play/display itself in the real world. 'Why do you keep
insisting,' I say, 'on this materialist viewpoint of body and mind' - when
your own work is developing a virtuality that doesn't have to have any
specific or specified material performance. as if there is no originary
point. "There seems to be this disconcerting desire to talk about the
mental as if it's discounted from the physical - I don't think you believe
in that yourself" 'no' "The interaction between humans and machines can
generate images and information that could be artificially intelligent
entities that proliferate, function, replicate, on the Internet. The prob-
lem with these entities is - are they going to be slowed down enough -
adequate interfaces with biological bodies that perform much slower -
within the constraints and parameters of what we call the physical world -
these packets of software code perhaps visualized" 'or maybe not' "in some
way - are we going to have adequate strategies of interfacing with these
entities, or not?" "It will get to the point where we will not be able to
depict them in any meaningful way." "But I agree with you that at every
different level of operation there are in a sense emergent possibilities
that we can't necessarily predict by through just examining the underlying
structure. It's just the seeming desire to escape from the body, increas-
ing ephemeralization." "For these agents to exist, proliferate, they're
still within an electronic medium. It's a way of talking about them that
we have to be careful of." i say it's not an escape from the body as an
escape from a naive materialism. i bring up the Soviet Union and diamat
and the reflection theory and the political consequences of diamat, etc.
how diamat floundered on cybernetics. Soviet philosophers weren't able to 
come up with a materialist ontology of cybernetic entities that worked - 
the nearest was the reflection theory. so there are consequences of going 
too far in one or another direction. (i'm all for compromise.) if the 
world is information, it's not all there and it's there. "But if we say 
the world is information, this can only be from an anthropomorphic view- 
point" 'absolutely' and he points out that information is such by virtue 
of interpretation - the "brute world is a series of events involving 
motion and mutation" etc. i bring up Clement Rosset, 'the idiocy of the 
real.' "I like that, a beautiful comment." ~~

**\ "To come back to that very simple statement I made at the beginning is
that the body is this kind of evolutionary architecture and biological
apparatus of awareness and operation in the world. It extends its opera-
tion in the world through technological bits and pieces, through instru-
ments to detect alien information, through machines to increase its
operational speed and so on. So in a sense technology is a strategy for
increasing operational complexity" 'making the fit, a phrase David Bohm
uses' 'i wonder if you couldn't say the body is _of_ the world instead of
_in_ the world' and Stelarc agrees, referencing Merleau-Ponty and the
notion of a contextualized body, and the sound fades out as the tape ends
on side 3. side 4. who do you like. Wittgenstein, Derrida hard but impor-
tant, Virilio and Baudrillard of the postmodern writers, McLuhan, Schop-
enhauer, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche who he finds seductive, Heidegger,
Hegel (we have all had troubles reading Philosophy of Mind). i mention
Kurt Goldstein and Alfred Schutz, i talk about relevance theory and Carne-
ades, a primary reference. Stelarc mentions Daniel Dennett, "a philosopher
of mine who I would sympathize with." "Off the top of my head I can't pull
any other names." i ask about other artists that might interest him - he
mentions Orlan who "does take the physical consequences for her ideas,"  
Survival Research Lab, a performance artist out of Barcelona - Marcelee
Artunez, then "someone I wired up, Arthur Elsinger, who has done a whole
series of works dealing with muscle stimulation of the face." i say what
fascinates me about Stelarc's work as opposed perhaps to these others -
Orlan and SRL are spectacle in a sense, Cartesian - i say that Stelarc's
work is messy, deliberately messed between epistemological regimes - i say
this is where the future is, is going, will be the horizon of the 22nd
century - "Even the construct of a cyborg, half body violently torn apart
- a medical military model [he's talking about Terminator] - but there are
other ways - the body swallows up its machines - the machines will be in-
visible - also a third notion - unmodified bodies but wired up, connected
to the internet." "We'll be able to physically hard-wire bodies." "One
could access my body at any time in a completely wireless environment."  
i'm thinking of a fourth model, bring up Ananova, Kyoko Data, these con-
figurations coming from the computer side, they're going to spread, dis-
seminate, those creatures from the other side, becoming more and more
autonomous. "Those entities would represent an interface between the human
body and other entities that might not look human or even want to inter-
act" - we're talking about agents again. **\

*/ i don't think i have any other questions. "I've survived" laughter, 
"without hitting each other with our microphones." "When you transcribe 
this discussion it's going to be replete with repeats and" and the voice 
has gone quite soft. but what i'm doing, it seems very different than what 
i thought i'd do. because i think to myself, it's in the errors, the repe- 
titions, that something else comes through in relation to the horizon of 
narrative, of virtual and real characters, of the saying and shaping of 
things. i'm surprised throughout the interview, throughout my reading as 
well, at the differences - the dichotomies of real/virtual or split bodies 
or even behaviorism / mentalism (or what have you) - when what i see is a 
mess, a messing-up of categories, as if clarity were a surface phenomenon 
or a residue at best. and i think - precisely in relation to this - of the 
efforts made, now, world-wide by various governments, to construct an 
early-warning system for the detection (and eventual elimination or re- 
programming) of near-earth objects which are on collision-tracks with the 
earth. i think about our fragility and, for me, the inconceivability of 
saying _anything_ with certainty, without a certain dis/comfort or dis/ 
ease accompanying the words and worlds. */

world lies, increasingly, in the laying down, and taking up, of wires. ~|
