

We Look at Zero


Writing degree zero, rhetoric degree zero, pure one-on-one denotation, 
stripped zeros, presence and acknowledgement - we must pursue this to the 
extent that information pervades ontology and origin - pursue it, in 
other words, until that theoretical bursitis reveals itself, inverts: at 
this point, something of the West will emerge.

"_Absolute degree zero,_ then, would be a discourse reduced to its _essen-
tial semes_ (by a metalinguistic process, since these semes are not dis-
tinct lexical entities), that is, to the semes that we could not suppress 
without at the same time depriving our discourse of all signification."
(A General Rhetoric, Group Mu, Dubois/Edeline/Klinkenberg/Minguet/Pire/
Trinon.)

If the "there you are" functions as a _practical degree zero_ for Group
Mu, then the Levinasian "there is" might further reduce to _absolute._
However, there are other, more practical, matters themselves, such as
logical tautologies to examine in this regard.

Perfection of Theory


As physical/neurophysiological/astrophysical/cosmological theory decreases
bandwidth and tolerance, it tends towards greater complexity, remoteness,
and difficulty vis-a-vis human comprehension. It is not that diffcult to
see a catastrophic movement in this trajectory, one in which theory ulti-
mately escapes _understanding_ itself (no matter the definition of under-
standing here).. Reading, for example, Dennett's Consciousness Explained,
produces both a sense of accomplishment and defuge; the world greatly
_irreducible._ It's been repeatedly pointed out that computers are the
most complex objects ever produced; they're still several orders of
magnitude beneath that of the brain. As the machines themselves grow more 
complex, they become equally irreducible; as they grow to imitate the 
input/output functions of the brain, their own functioning becomes 
increasingly remote.

The point here is that the increasing _perfection of theory_ need _not_
equally increase our understand of ourselves or the world we live in (this
applies to the Internet as well of course). So I ask, what _would_ charac-
terize comprehension? Is it always to be secondary or tertiary - necessar-
ily beyond the average human's comprehension - which then requires several
degrees of translations heavily distorting the original? And if this is
the case, what constitutes the "average human" and hir comprehension for
that matter? 

_It's the end of the world as we know it_ - the possibility that the uni-
verse is deeply incomprehensible, that as theory approaches _perfection,_
it recedes, becomes incomprehensible as well.

The Density of Death 


I have a small papyrus, framed, with a note stating it was bought in 1928
in Syracuse in Sicily. It is about 2" x 4" with a single image, perhaps a
votary. The hieroglyphics are rough; the sign for "homage" (?) seems a bit
legible and I can make out a few others, all using Budge's outdated dic-
tionary. There are four figures; on the right is a Pharaoh, throwned, with
a sun-disk; beneath him is a _sema-tawy,_ union of Upper and Lower Egypt.
He is faced by Thoth holding a scroll or papyrus; behind Thoth is Horus,
holding a _shut_ or feather, leading a man also holding a _shut._ This is
a symbol of death, also of Maat, goddess of Truth and Order, and the man's
_shut_ recognizes his life as such. Or so I read it in total ignorance.
There are three tables with papyrus clumps between the four figures. 

Outside there are identical stars. From my limited knowledge of the Mid- 
dle East to southeast, I am busy constructing myself walking in a semi- 
arid environment somewhere outside of Sumer. The triteness of all of this 
confounds me.

Not only confounds, but suffocates, for I am in Kingston, Pennsylvania, 
where I grew up, a small town across from Wilkes-Barre, in the heart of 
the hard-coal fields. (I collected Carboniferous fossils when I was a 
child.) More memories - the truth doesn't matter at all, only their nar- 
ratological import. The stories enter from the machine of the earth and 
repeat themselves within me. The machine in me listens, types this out.

This _is_ cyberspace, in apposition to the obdurate world. Narratolo- 
gical functions construct the stars, began my death thousands of years 
ago. I could go on; I already have.

Perfect Pupil

I now know that my time spent _here_ on the Internet is the direct result
of fear of real life. There are too many painful or disruptive memories,
too many regrets, for me to cope. On the Net, I can leave at least some of
them behind.  This is why, of course, flames and other forms of verbal vi-
olence disturb me so much - they remind me that real life leaks every-
where, that I must remain alive after I turn off the computer. Everything
is terminal;  the disease of life continues.

A Second Set of Answers


How many of you have had a successful cyber-relationship? what happened?
	I've tried at times; so far, they're only half-successful since
	the distance seems impossible, unable to be reconciled with the
	onslaught of daily life in New York.

How many of you have consummated it in real-life? how long did it take to
	have "full and satisfactory sex" (Gilles Perreault) after the
	initial meeting?
	It took almost no time at all; at times the full and satisfactory 
	sex was unaccompanied by otherwise compatibility.

How many of you have had phone sex as a result of a cyber-relationship?
	before or after consummation?
	Both of these.

How many of you have exchanged photos - dressed? photos - naked? panties?
	other items of clothing? other items?
	All of the above.

How many of you have moved to another city to be with someone you met
	on the Net? more specifically, met on these lists? has this, in
	your estimation, "worked out"?
	Have not yet done this for the reasons cited above. It would be
	hard to move into someone else's life...

/snip/	

How many of you have had an unsuccessful cyber-relationship? what 
	happened?
	I became afraid that I wouldn't be liked in real life; or I 
	panicked thinking I could not make the commitment that would
	result; or I felt that the distance issue would return with a
	vengeance.

How many of you have done things in Net sex you wouldn't do in real life?
	you haven't done in real life? you would do in real life? what
	sorts of things?
	I would do everything in real life (and have) except for obvious
	no-no's (!) such as cannibalism. Things have included shaving,
	tying, excretions.

How many of you subsequently did these things upon meeting in real life?
	Depends on the situation.

How many of you find cyber-relationships liberating? how many of you	
	have left a real-life partner as a result?
	They're liberating because you can be accepted for the way you
	think about things, before the physical chemistry enters into
	the equation.

How many of you find cyber-relationships disastrous?
	Very unhappy at times, but not disastrous.

How many of you have found them fulfilling within both virtual and real
	life? only within virtual life?
	I've increasingly found them less fulfilling because the virtual
	domain is so restricted; there's only so much typing one can do.
	I long for real intimacy beyond this space; the longer I'm on-
	line, the farther apart real and virtual life seem, even though
	there are always real consequences to the virtual.

How many of you are where I am?
	Where are you?

Lustmord: Murder and CMC


Lustmord is the name of a book edited by Brian King, The Writings and 
Artifacts of Murderers; it is also the name of an installation by Jenny 
Holzer. It refers not only to murder, but to murder coupled with desire, 
murder out of control, possibly psychotic, schizzy, hysteric. It occurs 
with a certain exhilaration of the lurid - that category of the night, 
torn clothing, and dismemberment that is both difficult to define and at 
the heart of human rapaciousness.

Murder may _out,_ but murderers may not be _outed,_ and a murderer may try
to hide the act; the act is often coupled with either secrecy or displace-
ment. There is almost always the curlicue of the _missing-person_ - the
cipher leaks, is rarely absolute. The cipher exists only as absence, sep-
arable in fact from the remnants of the body itself (there are cases of
cannibalism and freezing for example) - what _appears_ absence is the fur-
ther history of the body, the fact that it will no longer bear children, 
answer to its parents, etc.

The writings in Lustmord revolve around pain, retribution, and occasional
guilt, often wistful; by and large, they're not rants (less capitalization
than in the average Net flame), but discussions of a phenomenology that
has a foundation in both creation and annihilation. In this regard, they
remind one of Ballard, whose truth is that of a total decoding precisely
by overcoding, overdetermination. What passes in Ballard as a continuous
deployment of local color, translates into interior sequences in Lustmord;
in fact, these sequences dissolve the boundaries between mind and body in
a way one that deserves careful attention. If as Lingis might have it,
body and inscription, culture and natural writing (my phrase) are in a
problematic and diffuse relationship with one another, Lustmord provides a
mixed public/private key for unraveling the psyche. 

The key is contained by totalization, religion, sexual specificity, and
negation; in fact the last, the establishment and overcoming of barriers,
relates to proper-naming (of gods), prohibitions against speaking (proper-
names of gods), scape-goating, and the concept of sanctuary. Speaking and
writing interpenetrate as bodies (dead or almost dead) are penetrated,
wounded, opened up. _The body is violated by speech,_ and I contend that
this violation is 'primal,' inchoate itself; it is at this level of the
phenomenology that the problematic of text-based Internet communication
manifests itself. 

In this regard, one is reminded of the violence in Kristeva's chora, of
the violence seething just below governance in cyberspace, of the violence
of flaming. The psychoanalytical mechanisms that come into play are inter-
woven with themes of death, inscription, dismemberment, holes, absences,
part-objects, and devouring (cannibalism). Between Lingis and Chasseguet- 
Smirgel, lies the computer; between Ballard and Lustmord, only the hole.

Stupid Rage and Jury Duty in America


I don't believe in justice. I couldn't put anyone away. I couldn't
convict anyone. Give me a system where there's equitable distribution of
wealth and I'll reconsider. Give me a system at least with a safety net.
I'd be a criminal if I had to; everyone would be. You'd be stupid not to
take what's necessary to stay alive. If you don't get enough food you
get stupider by the day. If you let yourself go, there's no turning
back.

I'm here in this jury room. There are hundreds of people around me.
Maybe they'll send people to prison or award people huge amounts of
money for being victims. We're all victims, forced to serve in a system
that damns minorities and people generally bewildered in life.

If I rob someone it might take twenty minutes, ten minutes. If I rob
someone it might be an impulsive act, like a lot of murders are. Should
I then spend years in jail for those twenty minutes, ten minutes? I just
sit in jail. I just sit there, and do nothing. You can only meditate on
your crimes for so long. Guilt doesn't last forever; the body gets on
with everyday life, even in prison. Outside, there's always questions of
keeping a roof over your head, getting enough sleep.

I have rage against the country. It's not love it or leave it; like a
tumor, it grows on or with me. Without a safety net, it's obscene. With
the unequal distribution of wealth, it's obscene. Rage consumes me; I
fight it - it's useless, leads to nothing, a cancer itself.

Rage is serrated; it's got edges, grips the psyche, won't let go. It
keeps one awake at night, playing scenarios over and over again. It
contorts the body and mind. It makes the beautiful ugly, blinds one.
It's the result of obscenity, this rage. "Will the following jurors
report to the clerk's office?" A list of names is called; so far, I'm in
the clear.

------

I've just been up on the stand. I was asked if I'd been the victim of a
crime. Of course I had; who hadn't? I was asked if I could be impartial.
I said no, that I was self-employed, worked all the time, had another
course cancelled out. I said that I had to teach tonight until three in
the morning. The judge said that jury duty was an obligation and did I
take it up earlier for deferment and I said yes I had and she said that
she couldn't do anything about it but excused me anyway. I think because 
I blathered and blathered.

I couldn't argue for conviction. I couldn't jail anyone. The case was a
criminal one involving murder or attempted murder. I want to drop out. I 
don't want to give anyone big money either. I don't want to take any- 
thing away.

I want to drop out of this country, which isn't my country, doesn't feel
like my country. I want to drop out, become anonymous, roam the net from
unknown domains, always elsewhere, maybe hunted, maybe not, with virtual
bullets. I'll duck them, turn into another country, edu.qx for example.
I'll become a United Nations of countries, an alternative planet, solar
system, galaxy, universe.

"Attention jurors, attention jurors" - it continues over and over. Peo-
ple here have _jobs,_ professions, are on unemployment, wander about, with
or without children. Maybe their bosses pay them while they're on. Fifteen
dollars a day is absurdly beneath minimum wage. I close my eyes and see
myself out on the street. I wouldn't survive for a day; I'd find a way to
do myself in, end it all. I'd take a lot of crack or drink a lot of
whiskey and find some pills. I'd ask people how to do it. I wouldn't want
to be _there_ without work. I wouldn't want to be anywhere _just like
that._

Everyone in the jury room is dating everyone else; I'm sure of it. There
is lots of happy chatter. The inside of my brain is screaming for no
reason whatsoever. I have to teach tonight, do Net admin blah blah, get
back to this cold room tomorrow for more deployment. I'm sure my troops
are at their limits.

Inside the balcony of my skull, the audience is already filing out - but
wait, I have new brocades, chandeliers with candles, sumptuous curtains,
a thread of something that might turn into an author, steel mask, fero-
cious teeth and all.

Three of the jurors just got married... A fight's broken out in the
first three rows... There's a funeral. I spoke to the judge, told her
about the configuration, well relative configuration, of the American
justice system. It was her lunch hour. Her wide eyes opened wider; never
had she heard such elucidation. I told her about all the nations on the
Internet and asked her to move there with me. Which ones, she said, and
I really didn't have an answer; they all sounded good to me - no crime,
no people, no currency.

Everything's virtual anyway, she said, and faded into some alt.gov dream
of romance, relationship, and violence, while juror murders went unatten-
ded in the middle of the courtroom. 

I couldn't figure out if there was too little justice or maybe too much
of it.

There's an hour to go on lunch. I call in, hoping beyond hope that some-
how my Internet course was miraculously reconstituted like a lost packet.
No such luck, personal messages to be sure, but that rounded it out. I
heard a friend's voice on the answering-machine - almost a foreign land/
language. I'm totally and permanently out of touch; the walls of this room
might as well be a prison themselves. It's only temporary a week at most,
most likely two or three days if I can hold my anger in. 

It's as if night settled in the Big Smoky and I suddenly found out I'd
made the place up. 

-------

Later - Sometimes the intensity of abnormal normal life occupies an enor-
mous sector of one's everyday horizon. This is the case of course with
prison, which is a mutilated translation of the usual, but it is also the
case with the jury room, surgery, periods of mourning. In Central Jury, I
found I was writing _for myself,_ for the flood of words, which would
eventually become a text; the audience was distanced by the sheer force of
the _present_ jurors, all of whom seemed to mutate into couples by the
time the day was done. Throughout the entire proceedings, I sat alone or
paced like a mad secretary expecting to be called to the stand for the
crimes of humanity. (Robert Ashley did a piece like that). It was as if
time stood still; it was as if there were no tomorrow; it was if the force
of the state leaked from the walls; it was as if poverty and desperation
seethed from the floor; it was as if wise-ass retribution was just a
heartbeat away. 

Hey! -

The jury's still out on the cops in cyberspace, but the closing of anon.
penet.fi is already the first step towards permanent lockdown. Soon, our
beautiful nipples will carry the sunsets of Coca Cola, Microsoft will
gouge out gullet and intestine, and our brains will no longer answer to
anything less than Pentium 7. The corporate by the way was nowhere in
evidence in Central Jury - only minor hammers and the distant thud of
power. At least the phones worked. (This part goes nowhere because there
was nowhere to go.)

Central Theory Power-Structure Corps


Travis leaped up because he wanted to say something about the role of
structure in the bloated tumor that passed for the massive verbiage
describing cyberspace in all its ramifications, sentences growing on the 
surface of sentences, words descended from words. Even "cyberspace" had
become outmoded, however, replaced by nothing but a sense irreality.

Structure is/was already present at the creation, at the moment of crea-
tion, he said. The question of anarchy or a continuation of the hysteria
of style is no longer an issue. There are two genders from which dissem-
ination is a given, Clara replied, but there might be an other whose form
yet remains indeterminate. I'm not sure I understand your drift, one of
them said. 

you drift one of them said

I'm not tending towards the inchoate, but towards the pathological, Clara
interjected. There's no stopping it without ceasing to speak, to exist in
these untrammeled spaces. The name of the space is not the name of the
game, nor is the confabulation of detail. 

nor the confabulation of detail

There was silence in the room. There were people present, reading, who
hadn't spoken yet. They'd divided among themselves. Some would answer the
role and some wouldn't.

There was a loudspeaker in the room. It would disseminate the voice like
indirect lighting. It gave itself over to the source, to third-world
politics, to the other always dreamed of by an incoherent West. It called
like god called, voiceover, the name which would be spoken. The name was
connected to nothing or the calling would connect the name which would be
the address of the name. Between the name and the address, nothing. 

name, Name, god, God, address, Address, Nothing
 
The loudspeaker like indirect lighting spread the word.
The word diffused from numerous sources among the walls and ceilings,
from concealed loudspeakers that presented only a fuzzy and wide-open
target.
The word appeared from nowhere and everywhere at once, and the room
ceased to have either architecture or ornament.

Power: Let's say that there is one plug in this room, Central Theory. It's
called Central Theory because everyone goes there and waits until he or
she is called to a particular room. Each room tries another theory which
really means that each room develops and extends another theory. Since the
rooms extend into infinite virtual space, and since their doors are
locked, the jury can develop its own premises alone. 

This isn't a metaphor for anything, except for the fact that Central
Theory has only one plug. So there would be fights for the plug, for the
power, in order that you and I could use our laptops beyond their usual
battery life, which might not be enough time to dvelop a hypothesis. On
the other hand, it just might be exactly the right amount of time.

(This isn't a metaphor for Pangloss Panopticon, theory-power, power-theo-
ry, power-lunch, theoretical blindness or hindsight/foresight.)

There's always the issue of the voltage and amperage, and many are the
laptops that have met their glimmer-days, sparking wildly, across the
barrens of Central Theory. But now we presuppose the loudspeaker.

sparkling widly

The loudspeaker is used in Ciudad Juarez for politics and general ideo-
logical dissemination. Everyone stops and listens to the loudspeaker. It
sits on top of an old Volkswagen rigged for the occasion, parked near
the cathedral square with its churches and run-down businesses surround-
ing the elevated plaza. It carries the voice, from perhaps a very little
person or perhaps not. Is the voice always masculine? Is it always heard 
but is it still there?

Central Theory engenders the feminine voice which folds and infolds,
resonance upon resonance, reverberating through the hallways of the
building, entering even into the theory rooms themselves. But it's not a
voice of authority, it's a voice of disenfranchisement, a flux-voice, a
voice of infinite morphologies, chaotic and shimmering with sinusoidal
pulsings. It's the literally recorded voice of Luce Irigaray, applied to
a set of circumstances, which is the _structure of phonemes_ utilized in
this particular discourse.

this discursive formation, this particularity, articulation, 'ation'

Central Theory thus owes to Central Casting. Both owe something to
structure which delimits, defuses, diffuses both presence and presenti-
fication. The _output_ is the Internet_Text_Tumor, ITT, which increases
without regard to legibility, and it is precisely at this juncture of
image, text, theory, and giganticism that the power plug resides.

One may be called up and released from Central Theory. Then one types
forever.

constant typification, genetic algorithm resolutions, echolalias

Blanking Interval


Francois Villon's Ballade (_des dame du temps jadis_) contains this re-
frain, for each of the four stanzas: "Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?" 
Dante Gabriel's translation is the most melodious and famous:


The Ballad of Dead Ladies

Tell me now in what hidden way is
 Lady Flora the lovely Roman?
Where's Hipparchia, and where is Thais,
 Neither of them the fairer woman?
 Where is Echo, beheld of no man,
Only heard on river and mere, -
 She whose beauty was more than human? ..
But where are the snows of yester-year?

Where's Heloise, the learned nun,
 For whose sake Abeillard, I ween,
Lost manhood and put priesthood on?
 (From Love he won such dule and teen!)
 And where, I pray you, is the Queen
Who willed that Buridan should steer
 Sewed in a sack's mouth down the Seine? ..
But where are the snows of yester-year?

White Queen Blanche, like a queen of lilies,
 With a voice like an mermaiden -
Bertha Broadfoot, Beatrice, Alice,
 And Ermengarde the lady of Maine, -
 And that good Joan whom Englishmen
At Rouen doomed and burned here there, -
 Mother of God, where are they then? ..
But where are the snows of yester-year?

Nay, never ask this week, fair lord,
 Where they are gone, nor yet this year,
Except with this for an overword, - 
 But where are the snows of yester-year?


"Mother of God" is "Vierge souvraine" in the original, "Sovereign Virgin."
The difference is important, because the intact hymen, like snow, blanks
the intervals of the years, _remains_ intact or Obelisk; only the painted 
folds of her robes imply labia, activatity beyond the ob-ject of worship.

Now where is the snow from? Snow is both history and negation - the latter
of course in terms of the landscape itself, blanketing difference, subsum-
ing it. But it is also history, since snow is _inches fallen,_ more or
less, and more or less subsumption. It is a history which re-covers itself
after the covering, beginning after the ending.

Such history is always a disappearance and will be, until the final days
of frozen earth; by that time, evaporation will have taken care of every-
thing in the midst of the nova. There will be no traces, nothing to trace;
molten rock will return the planet to noise, not chaos. Neither smooth nor
rough nor nothing to figure it out. 

In the meantime, snow is both a history and a blanking interval of histor-
y, and this leads us to a brief consideration of email, and our users, who
have also disappeared, with or without forwardings, a loss which remains
archived at best, and archives themselves are suspect to destruction. Who
tallies archives of archives, remembers the names above, _all of them_ who
were famous in their times and places? 

"les neiges" haunt, implicate latitudes and weathers, the same chills in
the air, flakes garnered beneath the hood or cuff, working their way
against dry skin's desire, frisson of snowballs and falls. Heloise worked
her way through the snow, medievally giggling; Michael Current wrote the
final version of the Cybermind information sheet. When names fade, the
_where_ is more relevant here than anywhere else, since there is no _here_
and only an absence of text denoting death or just boredom with computer
communication. Absence rarely leaves traces; if presence can return the
body, continued absence needs the testimony and judgement of the peripher-
al. Does anyone ever know, for sure, anything in this regard, or anything,
and in any other?

Service Down


The only time television went out here (with, I believe, the exception of
Channel 2) was when the World Trade Center was bombed; it carries a heavy
load of television and radio aerials at the top. Telephone service has
also been fairly consistent during the past five years; there was an af-
ternoon when only calls within the immediate several-block area could be
made; we were cut off from the rest of the world. The radio has never gone
out, and while electrical current has occasionally flickered in big storms
(I switch to laptop), it's never been completely disrupted. All this over
six years. 

Most of these services are centralized, with phone and power being some-
what diffuse. Hacking enters the media sphere in odd ways: Hacking the
phone company, a favorite pastime for some people, does little overall
damage; there are pirate radio and I presume pirate television stations 
around; and some people steal power. 

But none of this prepares one for the _porosity_ of the Internet, which is
composed of conduit (fiber, radiolink, wire), routers and servers, and
computers small and large, all conspiring to create a decentralized system
in which each site has access to every other. The result is the potential
for infinite hacking, service disruptions, address spoofs and other viola-
tions. Firewalls can only go so far in this regard; the recent attack on 
Panix is an example of what can happen with even a relatively small (and 
well-published) program.

On one hand, I wish again to sound an alarm without appearing too paran-
oid; on the other, I want to describe _thwarted_ communication, without
appearing too neurotic - but a neuroticism of sorts can be the only result
of a _fundamental distortion_ composed of breakins, breakdowns, variable 
lags, and the relative ability of _anyone_ to reach _anyone_ on the Net.

Increasingly, I think of the Internet as a "living" thing, not sentient
(except in a low-level routing kind of way), with packet fluxing as a kind
of _pulsion_ or drive. In situations of hacking/wounding, there are often
ways around the damage (which soon scars over with patches), but if the
damage is done precisely at the ISP itself, the server can temporarily
collapse. 

What happens? At the user's end, silence, until an motd (message of the
day) is issued. Silence, which may mean or not mean anything at all, is an
absence or diffuse indexicality: it references and participates in the
appearance of damage (death, refusal to reply, other sites down, etc.),
but is silent as well in relation to cause. This silence is authoritarian,
unable to be contradicted by presence; it wraps itself around the psyche,
which, by virtual of peripheral intuition, may sense _something is wrong._
The relation to anxiety, which is also present, rootless, grounded in
cause and absence, is clear. The relation to neurosis - the result of the
resulting distorted communication, misplaced echo - becomes evident as
well when the _family orbit,_ familiality, is taken into account, since
speaking and receiving occur first within it. (One could absurdly insist
on the presence of Mother-matrix / Father-protocol in the midst of this.)

There are no conclusions. Panix is sputtering at the moment; the Net, even
through ascii/shell access, seems sputtering during the day; the Web sput-
ters constantly. While most of this is the result of overloaded bandwidth,
a portion is also the result of hacking, deliberate interference. 

(And this is so easy to do! What's to stop someone from setting up a ser-
ver, writing a simple program to send, say, 500k messages out at the rate
of one per second, at selected targets? I wonder what could be done in
this situation, especially if the sender's addresses were spoofed. I re-
member at one point Cybermind was spammed, and when I complained to the
sysop/root, I got back an hysterical message saying YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING!
I AM THE SYSOP!!!! Etc. etc.)

Eventually, we'll be living behind even thicker firewalls, pervasive cor- 
porate presence and advertising, censorship, high-priced access engines, 
monitored discussions, and government-controlled encryption schemes. Time 
to think about Fidonet again... Or give me a call at 718-857-3671... if 
you can reach me off-line...

Travis was listening to the news, and heh! he said it wasn't like it was

when he was a kid, how was it? You knew who you were then, he said, there

wasn't much doubt of it. When he flew he was a man inside a woman. The

ship, she asked, yes, of course, what else would you go in. And there was

always the enemy, the orcs she asked, yes he said, they were out for us.

It was always a battle to the finish, did it ever finish she said.


It finished, Travis said, it finished and that was that. He was silent.

It was night on the ship it was daylight. Splatter-rays raged around him;

the black hulk of the enemy cruiser passed between them and the sun. Huge

eyes pierced his brain and they couldn't remember who she was. For one

last vestigal second of consciousness, he pulled the lever and the uni-

verse exploded.

Ripple


I've been getting shooting pains up the back of my hands, buzzed sensa- 
tions across the palms and lightning flashes throughout the fingers. Is 
this stroke or carpal tunnel, arthritis or simple overwork? The desktop
machine's the worst, since my wrists touch the edge of the board support- 
ing the computer; the whole place here is ramshackle.

The arms and neck become stiff. The lower back hurts. But these are not
the symptoms I am concerned with, those other flashes when I attempt to
sleep, turning over and over, crawling through bodies, the glint of light
on skin somewhere where the mattress begins its descent to the floor. 
Sleeping is accompanied by voices, but when I wake, there are remnants,
phrases from cyberspace, leftovers from terminal dreams. 

There are limbs disassociated from bodies; labia emerging, swamped and
taut against the skin; naked backs; breasts with soft darkened nipples
against eyes, ears, throat - pressured, draining; there are the deeper
organs, hearts, vaginas, penises, the lungs themselves; I'm naked myself,
or rather stripped; I'm surrounded, it's a marsh of dismemberment, heated,
lukewarm - _nurui_ "is as a rule used with reference to liquids to mean
'not hot enough.' .. Sometimes, _nurui_ means 'not cold enough' in refer-
ence to liquids." (Miura) The hands hurt: lukewarm. The fingers hurt:
lukewarm. There is a section of my hand gone numb from being tied up, in- 
scription of sex. I imagine a future of numbed streaks across the body, 
its membranes and open topologies. They inscribe a mute and impenetrable 
sign. The more the body splays, discourses, the greater the illegibility.

Pain spreads in the form of sheets or ripples across the back of the 
hands. I dream of disks inserted, RAM doublers increasing my ability to 
feel, remember the felt, feel once again. The last of the body is always 
pursuant. 

These are my _mouths,_ fastening-fascinated on keys, swollen with your
reception.  You come in the front door, back door; I come in the front
door, back door. The space opens up with migraine flashes that cauterize
the screen, arrowheads of Vs that flash against the text. They are not the
said, add to the streaks attacking the joints, buzzed flashes streaking
lightly across the flesh, everywhere I'm streaking of you, this is not a
streak, this is text, cliff-side discourse-formation, I hate you word.

On


They have been on MOOs for up to 16 days, a record as I recall. They re-
main hooked in and out of IRC, and I remain here, late-night, waiting for
your mail to arrive. The screen always seethes; I don't have to do any- 
thing, except hit a key every once in a while to stop the time-out. It's 
the _potential_ which is a form of gambling, and I send you my picture, 
you send me yours; flurries of pictures intersect the Internet; I am you 
are everywhere. The screen puckers; a nipple appears, packet ID number at 
the least, hopefully my final destiny.

They remain _on_ because _on_ is life itself, being _on,_ the primacy of 
Heidegger's _Being on Time_ a prime example. Being on Time, as in: You're 
really _on_ tonight. What are you going _on_ about? You're always _on._

The edges of the screen furl, curl in towards black borders shading to-
wards an untoward center. Something might occur, as an absence for exam- 
ple. But the occurrence is linear; the mailq is queued in and out for my 
pleasure. Whatever happens, there will always be another, and the screen 
will be ready for it, the computer on.

It's an I/eye, cite/site (yes, I/inscription//agrios/domus*) in the corner
of the room, along the wall of the room, across the room, on the floor or
ceiling of the room. It keeps the room alive. I don't have to do anything.
I can read, write, hack with the biff y, and here you come across the
screen to take me away from myself, or if not now, when? The wait is a
temporal caress, cross and diffused kisses spreading across me. All of us
are perfect delight. 

To theorize the _on_ is to _endlessly_ theorize being as inconceivable de- 
marcation. Metaphysics appears, fantasy narratives, light anecdotes and 
Russian novels. The _on_ blocks/is blocked, the movement of the pratico- 
inert when no one is looking.

I know if I close my eyes, the screen continues, and that is a basic fact 
of life.

Bone

It feels as if my bones will crack. my bones feel it in my wrist bones
that will crack will break, twist sinew tendon muscle, arm bones crack
into shoulder boned cracked or fissured. I hear splitting; there are tiny
cracks finger cracks hairline fractures, maw gaped fissures, filigree
cracks, bored bone split or splintered from palm to neck crack broken bone
palm slammed shattered torn cracked bone. Now a new day and just the hand
back heated from nothing snuffling around beneath the surface, fingers
recovered from crack-attacks, key stumbling once again, dark sun out
bright light.

In writing I need a room of my own. In writing I need to clear a space. 
In writing I need silence, a vista, a view, a comfortable place where I 
can be alone with my thoughts. My writing is the most important to me. My 
writing is the most important.

My life is in opening spaces and open spaces. My life is an and, not an 
or. With my life and my thoughts, words get in the way. My life is in the 
coming of questions, and words get in the way. My life is most generous. 
Words are prisons. Everyone says this, and everyone saying it is part of 
penitentiary me. My life is more generous than this.

Is there a god? Turn to file <xyz>. Will you find true love? Turn to file
<abc>. Everything I write is all that can be written. You will close your
eyes and open them in this space and there will be no writing but you will
read all there is. 

Sometimes I will wait or you will wait in the midst of the rubble of text,
the text scrapes raw like whiskers against soft lips. The contusion of 
whispers, and you or I will ignore them, waiting for questions in a very 
plain space, a lovely plain space.

The questions will come like wordless butterflies.

Only one thing remains after the questions die, fall to the ground like 
rubble or text in a beautiful space, that is,

I can't tell what's you and what's the program. And years ago, I remember 
talking with Clara and her drugs and she said, I can't tell what's me and 
what's the chemistry.

I can't tell and I'll be silent and I need the very big space bigger than
me and you, and I can't see you. What's the program, what's the chemistry.
Jennifer said, my writing is the most important. This is writing.

War


With the repeated attacks on panix.com, the ISP is currently unreliable in
terms of guaranteed mail delivery. The attacks are simple and low-level
and can be done by just about anyone with a linux or unix machine; as has
been pointed out, there are plenty of scripts available, beyond that in
the current 2600. 

The disruptions are sufficiently severe, and the attacks sufficiently sim-
ple, that one may question just how much security has been built into the 
Net since, say, the Worm of '88. Note that the attacks aren't hacks into 
particular accounts; they're not carrying information back to the sender 
- which makes them difficult to trace. They're occurring for a purpose - 
to bring down panix.com and possibly other ISPs as well.

I don't buy into a conspiracy theory here, by the way, as some have pro- 
posed; I don't think these are the result of inter-internet corporate ri- 
valries. There is too much at stake, too much criminal intent.

Beyond all of this, I can only speak of the effect on me, as a panix user
for the past two and a half years. Panix is a relatively expensive ser-
vice, but it has been extremely reliable, except for some recent disk
crashes, which can happen anywhere. I've remained with it because of the
reliability; like television, I have almost always been insured of imme-
diate access when I've needed it. Now the attacks, of course, change all
that; I have on one hand my loyalty to panix, and on the other, the fact
that my own communications have become distorted, slotted back and forth
between panix and netcom, and not getting through, at times, on panix at
all. 

As I've pointed out, the Net is everywhere porous. A MOO could be brought
down just as easily by a telnet 23 attack. I gather from the newsgroups
that the reconfigured IP won't make any difference at all; the problems
lie with the design of TCP, which is carried on all sorts of datastreams.
The result is that I've become increasingly depressed and disinvested; a
part of my day is spent in dealing with ISP status - working, in other
words, on the sub-level, instead of that of the text itself. More than
ever, I'm aware of the breathing of Quartermain's Matrix, of its vulner-
ability, of its redundancy which also makes it susceptible. I move between
layers at this point, from text to machine to text, all the while entered 
by virtue of machine and its discursive formations. 

My nerves are on end (what else is new?); the stuttering has surfaced,
just as Jennifer predicted it would. Speaking and writing per se remain
the same as ever, but _distribution,_ alterity, is radically altered -
behind your real or virtual face now looms that of the hacker with blurred
intent. I would rather not deal with hir: Criminality, as Alexander
Essenin-Volpin might have pointed out, is in part the demanding of the
obligation of the other - E-V's _freedom 2_ is fundamentally the freedom
from coercion. By virtue of the hacker, I am coerced into fumbled or dis-
torted communication; by virtue of the hacker, my speech is not my own.

Labor


It's too much labor. There's labor everywhere on the Net, every instance
of text has thought and action behind it. Strands trace back from T1 lines
to teletype and earlier; totality is the result of production. The _shape_
of ASCII has been a decision, the result of conference and implementation. 
These fingers on these keys, interrupts all the way down. Subroutines call
up subroutines; there is no longer a level at the top, but only circula-
tion, some of which is evidenced as interface. Interface itself becomes
introjected; before long, the circulations will involve a totality which
is the result of production. The _shape_ of the world has been a decision,
the result of conference and implementation. This mind, interrupts all the
way down. Diffused subroutines, no longer localized, circulate among them-
selves; we're ensured that vision, somewhere, exists. No longer introjec- 
tion, the world, a result of production, continues as always.

You see a man coming down the street towards you. And you are wary of this
man, and this man is full of drugs. He is full of drugs and does not know
which way is up but he can walk fine and when he has to, he can talk fine.
But he is full of drugs and perhaps he thinks he is a bandit, which makes
him a bandit, or thinks he will kill someone, which makes him a killer.
You see this man and you think he is a man but he is drugs and he is a
drug man and you think he is like a machine because he is not like you and
he is not like a man who is a killer or a bandit because he is a man or a
drug man and he thinks different walks different talks different but they
are all fine. 

And you look around and you see there is another man and maybe there is a
woman and maybe there are drugs or there are no drugs but they are all
fine and they all think different. And they can talk fine and walk fine
and perhaps they think they are killers or bandits or waiters or nurses or
lovers or humans but they are waiter human or killer human or lover human
or they are not. And then what is a man, that he is a man, and what is a
woman, that she is a woman, or they are not. And I will call them avatars
because they are or they are not human, and I do not know what you will
call human who is lover human or drug human or what is morphine human sex
human, or what is loving human or hating human. I do know when I see a man
coming down the street and his eyes are not his eyes and I do mean that,
that I am afraid of avatars because they do not know my name and I am al-
ways writing human, always writing. And they are reading nothing and they
are drug.
