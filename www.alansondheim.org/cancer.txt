On March 16, 2000, my mother died of cancer. From September 1999 until 
March 1, 2000, I was virtual writer-in-residence for the trAce, an on- 
line writing community. During this period, up through and after her 
death, I wrote an extended meditation, broken up into smaller texts, on
cancer and death. Some of this was in the diary I kept for trAce. The 
following is a record, begining with dates from my partner's diary.

from Azure Carter's diary:

## On Tuesday, July 6, 1999, we went to the New York Public Library and 
saw Alan's mother & had dinner w/ Tom & Leslie. I think we had lunch at 
the Italian place w/ Evelyn (mother). This must have been the 1st time I 
met her. I arrived on the 26th of June. My aunt came to NY July 1 & left 
the 5th.
## On Thursday, July 8, we went to PA, probably w/ your mother. This was 
probably when they were working on our space. (Workmen had to install a 
new outer wall on the building.)
## On the 9th, we went to the Back Mountain Library Auction.
## On the 14th we took the new computer to Brooklyn.
## On the 28th Wednesday we went back to NY 10 am.
## On Tuesday, August 17, we met Evelyn at 12:30. We probably had lunch at 
the Italian place & maybe frozen yogurt at the health food place.
## I had "surgery" on the 10th Saturday, crossed out.
## On Sept 18th, Evelyn's 80th b-day. We went to PA 1 pm.
## On Sept 21, 3pm bus home.
## On Sept 27, I think we were supposed to hear from Evelyn about her 
tests.
## On October 5, Evelyn had surgery.
## On October 27th, move furniture 8 am. (The furniture was moved from 
mother's apartment in Manhattan to our apartment in Brooklyn; she was 
retiring and moving back to Pennsylvania.)
## Dec 13, drive to NY w/ Foofwa (dancer). Stop in PA first. Have lunch at 
Peregino's w/parents.
## Dec 18, leave for NY, 10:10 am.
## January 21, 2000, leave for PA w/ Joanna (my daughter). We meant to go 
earlier but there was bad weather.
## Leave for NY @ 8:30 am, Jan 23. (Joanna leaves & Mark & Cathy arrive 
all on this day) (Mark * Cathy go to PA on the 25th)
## March 11, go to PA @ 3:15 pm.
## March 12, see Evelyn's doctor @ 9am
## March 13, Evelyn moved into the hospice.
## March 14, Peter & Margie go to Toronto. Sandy arrives.
## March 16, Evelyn died @ 9 am.
## March 18, Margie and Peter go to PA.
## March 20, Evelyn's funeral.
## March 26, go to NY@ 3:10 pm.

THE TRUTH OF CLAR
 
 
II. Thu Sep 9 01:23:04 EDT 1999 Only God creates the transcendence for
truth. This always already pushes the stack back; what requires absolution
procures it in relation to the Mother. Thu Sep 9 01:23:55 EDT 1999
Transcendence is a condition of abandonment, indeed, of the abandoned - so
says Clar. Thu Sep 9 01:24:32 EDT 1999 Clar adds, abandonment among a
population of refugees is equivalent as true Abandonment to God. To leave
the Trappings of Our Life according to Buddha, to cross borders,
inconceivable transgressions: such are the Reincarnated themselves. Thu
Sep 9 01:25:48 EDT 1999 Clar says, within the new Carapace, there is the
Ward of Our Soules; the converted leave their Implements behind. Beyond is
the Way of God, which is the Way of Vast Abandonment. Thu Sep 9 01:26:36
EDT 1999 Even to breath, Clar says, requires no presence of the Lord, who
is a distraction. Thu Sep 9 01:26:58 EDT 1999 Mind focuses beyond Godhead,
who is already with parts, breaking the Fast of Transcendence. Abandonment
must be total, eyes crossed, legs and arms spread, wheel and gyre. Clar
says, the way to the truth which is perfect Refuge and perfect Refugee.
When the borders are drawn, erased in earth, sand, water, sky, wind,
storm. Thu Sep 9 01:28:10 EDT 1999 No debris, nothing but what is trodden
underfoot. Thu Sep 9 01:29:10 EDT 1999 There are no fallen; who falls, is
abandoned, Clar says, and such abandonment is the finality of the search
for truth. The Way is the Wayside. The Way is the Wayside, Clar says,
against the advice of Buddha, God, her own dear conscience. Clar says the
Wayside deflects or derails the truth, which is what in all facticity, it
is. Thu Sep 9 01:30:20 EDT 1999 Clar says, I have nothing more to tell
you, what you have already known. Thu Sep 9 01:33:31 EDT 1999 Thu Sep 9
01:33:31 EDT 1999

I. Thu Sep 9 01:23:04 EDT 1999 Writing, Clar says, is the debris left
behind, the Subject of Abandonment, the pole or locus. Such, Clar
reflects, those who are Called, are Culled. Thu Sep 9 01:30:39 EDT 1999
The culling or the called, refuge and refugee, abandoned and abandonment
and abandoning, the way and the wayside, says Clar, to murmur these is to
murmur the truth from the corner of the eye, the thought just beyond
recognition, the voice barely understood, and come in the midst of the
night. Thu Sep 9 01:32:58 EDT 1999

What impending death of oneself or another may construct:


i

One assumes in the absence of danger, disease, the extremities of life,
that one's project may continue indefinitely; thus writing tends in this
fashion towards a normative foreclosure, drawn by the exigencies and es-
thetics of apparent internal necessity. Impending collapse produces an/
other approach: that a project is only a process which may, like a diary
for example, be cut off arbitrarily at any point. Writing in these con-
ditions is a writing through urgency and emergency; it is writing that
attempts, in every phrase or sentence or paragraph, a recuperation and
resonance - as if the phrase or sentence or paragraph will be the last.

In this fashion, after time/ after time, it becomes apparent that there
is, of course, no last, not even with the excision or exclusion of life
-- that one's project is always already open-ended and on the verge of
failure. This recognition re-enters the project, restructures it from
within, so that the manifesto, for example, transforms into meaningless
phrases, self-doubts and critiques -- and all those other states that
some say characterize wisdom.

Of wisdom I know nothing, and of truth, less. I do know that impending
death, of oneself, or of someone so close that one is rubbed raw through
it, has the ability to transform text into fragile self-reflective flow;
object into discourse, a never-ending conversation full of glances, ex-
postulation and pauses; and foundations into an uneasy grasp of such,
the world slipping through one's fingers, the sky always already threat-
ening, close to disappearance beneath an angry, raging, dying, sun.

When beings become intravenous
When nothingness becomes a scan

When the I becomes chemotherapy
When entities become medication
When objects become neurasthenias
When selves become schizophrenias
When death becomes thing, being, beings
When death becomes nothingness, void, I
When death becoes entities, objects, selves
When death becomes thing, being, beings, nothingness, void, I, entities,

Some people really can't read about the problems others are having; for
others, including myself, it's healing, knowing there are other people
who feel like I do, that I may be crazy, but there are other crazies out
there and maybe we aren't that crazy after all. 

But sometimes as well people attack me for how I feel. I mean, how could
I be attacked, I'm just expressing myself, what I'm going through. I 
don't want to lay it on anyone else, I just want to be understood. I
don't even want sympathy, just maybe there would be someone reading what
I have to say who could understand me or help.

Very briefly, if it wasn't for these people on line, I would kill myself
a long time ago. These have been the people who have helped me when my
friends haven't wanted to even hear anything about me.

What do I have to do, have a crisis before anyone listens to me? I'm 30
yrs. old and I've supported myself since I was 15. I know how to get 
around but believe me, it's not been easy. And if I speak about malaise
or something that's not all that interesting, I mean how much of this
stuff really IS interesting, then no one wants to hear me.

Now at least I can say how I feel. Before I could never talk to anyone.
Now I have someone who will listen to me when I express my rage, when I
want to kill myself. I know I will be a better person. It is enough that
they listen, they don't have to say anything. My computer has become my
best friend.

I've learned that I can discuss things better with you online than I can
with my doctor, and I know now who to avoid when I need to look for a 
doctor. It has been very painful; it has been the most painful period of
my life and being on line has saved me time and again.

For once I could talk to my doctor and tell her that the medication was
not working, that it might have been a placebo for all I know. I said I
wanted to try something else, that I had the support of the online commu-
nity. I said nothing else mattered, my whole world gets caught up in this
or that medication and I know there is more to life than that.

Before, I was always taken by surprised; now I know when things are going
to get bad way ahead of time, and I can look for help from my doctor or
from online, and online people seem much more willing to listen.

Sometimes I'll feel so down, I could almost break things. Then to listen
online to people talking, I mean what they say to each other, how they
relate, sometimes it's really funny, and that helps a lot. I never thought
I could laugh so much from things coming over the screen but that's how
it is.

It is so spiritual to read these disembodied voices who never judge me,
and I know in real life they never would...

There are people out there in this town who could really benefit from all
this on line, they would learn how to better control themselves. I think
so many people in this culture are hurting or wrecked, I don't know where
it's all coming from, things are changing so fast, for everyone. I'm only
seventeen and I can hardly handle my life anymore, things going so fast
before my eyes, but when I get online I can really concentrate and slow
things down and learn to speak and think for myself.

You know, my daughter wouldn't talk to anyone, and we were both going
through a lot and it was coming on line that gave us the courage to speak,
first to others, and then to ourselves. It was so strange, we began by 
writing back and forth, honestly trying to deal with our feelings, even
though we were living in the same house. I think things like this are 
somehow more natural than being off line and walking warily around the
place, all of us fearful to speak to one another, we've got all those
defenses from being in the same place together too long.

Now this is what I have to say, don't use this as a crutch. If you do, 
what will you do when y2k comes along or your computer goes? It's a lot
more delicate than a friend, you have to know that. It's not a friend at
all, it's machinery that brings you voices that help you and console you
from time to time. But you can't count on it. I wouldn't count on it at
all.

This has replaced drugs of any sort for me; you can't believe what I was
like at one time. I couldn't even sit down without shuddering. Now I have
the time to even be with my parents a little, we're beginning to under-
stand each other. But it's because of this screen, nothing else. And they
know that. Someday maybe I can put this aside, but not for a long long 
time.

From the Backbone of Now to the Backbone of a Long Time Ago


Close the eyes and god goes away, I think it's a terrific deal.
Tue Sep 28 18:58:10 EDT 1999 is not the time now, for example; god
wouldn't let me enter the time now but did let me enter this old time.
I like the old time. I like thinking about the old time. God lets me do
that, god is pretty terrific, is a good god. 
I want to sleep now.
Management has taken care of everything; god is a voice-over. 
A voice-over, and that makes it
all right, saying the date and time from the past, crying over 
that Tue Sep 28 18:58:10 EDT 1999, which won't come
again.

now cancer will begin its journey in the arms of god arraignments while
cancer subsides and angels happy Tue Oct 5 22:22:54 EDT 1999 arraignments

pray
 
Tue Oct  5 22:14:18 EDT 1999
in the truth of god the cancer enters the lung, from the truth of god 
the cancer hovers, now, as if it were forever Tue Oct 5 22:14:54 EDT 1999 
abandoned by god, the cancer thins towards ready exculpation, as if it
were gone, as if angels rejoiced, singing the home of abandoned cancer,
the purity of organs constituted Tue Oct 5 22:15:56 EDT 1999 now cancer
returns, approbated by god, as if god were speaking or speech or sound,
now cancer spreads to the adrenal, angels weep in full capacity against
the begging of the angels arrayed against god, now cancer seeps, spreads,
covers itself, makes excuses, ahem, begs foregiveness, meanders, wanders,
returns, burrows, ahem Tue Oct 5 22:18:00 EDT 1999 now cancer subsides,
angels rejoice, god withdraws, there is no justice in the world, suns
blacken, angels sing and play harps, cancer dwindles, eyes return their
bright and merry sight Tue Oct 5 22:18:39 EDT 1999 now breathing slows,
waves of cancer testing other newer waters, new metastases, solitons and
wavelets, ripples on surfaces unseen, god smiles wide and broad, angels
shudder holding on Tue Oct 5 22:19:30 EDT 1999 now cancer claims an other
organ, angels again weeping and wailing, shall there be no mercy, angels
crying and begging, god almost merry, cancer hems and haws, cancer close
to apologetic laughter Tue Oct 5 22:20:26 EDT 1999 now cancer will begin
its work within the arms of god, angels prepare for bier and mourning,
angels yet hopeful in the face of god's huges eyes Tue Oct 5 22:21:30 EDT
1999 smiling everywhere, yet other organs, uncanny stillness, strangeness
of beings of pure light arrayed against skin, bones, organs, god's beings
against angels wailing Tue Oct 5 22:22:39 EDT 1999 arraignments during
final assaults and angels dying Tue Oct 5 22:23:21 EDT 1999 let us pray

letters fall over and lie there as well. 
if this had been a book, you would have read this long ago.
the pages, yours, letters swollen, loving your mouth.
the grist of letters among protrusions of the flesh.

all letters sing only of sex and death.
love appears along their splines or embrochures.
it is the ancient science of letters.
never confuse this with material or spiritual wealth.

letters survive and murmur and couple and mourn.
letters need nothing, not even our speaking and writing.
the page is a trap is a cemetery is a constant death.
letters burn black fire white smoke in sullen truths of skies.

what we see is their death, what we know, their death.
nothing of their song or the spike of them in tongue.
your mouth gets in the way, they don't want to leave.
our lives are seduced by each and every page.

letters, leave us.
letters, leave us.

you may turn towards them and with them you may face the new day, and the
sun rising above the trees and the mountains, and the pure fog lifting

The Following from the diary texts:


Monday the 27th towards evening; my mother should be all right, the pet-
scan came out negative, meaning the cancer is just in the lungs and ad-
renal gland. Hopefully the surgery a week from now will take care of
things; it's been a harrowing period. I'm still working on renegading
texts from the misc. directory - writing them from notes, from pieces of
things.

Tue Oct  5 23:12:43 EDT 1999 right now when I begin to write; I've been
worried about my mother all day long, the operation was a success, there
may be trouble with her lymph nodes and I'm upset, we won't have the
results until Friday.

Tomorrow we find out the _condition_ of my mother, what the tests will
show, the biopsies, etc., and I'm unable to sleep or think properly. On
top of this, I pulled my neck out a few days ago, and can't keep my head
upright - I'm more aware than ever of the _weight of the nub_ that char-
acterizes the top of the body. So I've been using a heating pad, taking
(at night late) tylenol, etc., trying to take of the problem - which
doesn't seem to be working.

Sun Oct 10 00:09:15 EDT 1999 Just turning, the news from my family has
suddenly reversed as well, my mother getting better, health on the way for
real. And I'm confused in the face of my traditional pessimisms but glad
I'm proved for wrong for once.

My family is getting healthier, but we've been dealing with very heavy
other problems today, and on top of that I feel physically ill. I think
it's one of my periodic body failures screaming at me to slow down...

now the 18th of this month of December and a dark night / flurries out
in deed. Everything I do ends with ellipsis and regret.

Life is suffering existence, existence is life suffering, but without nir-
vana or satori, there are desolate plains at the very end, and desolate
planets. Here I can say it, she's dying, I can say it here, near the end
of the diary, through my tears, it may be a few months more. There were
phonecalls all over the place tonight. I can't think straight. I was going
to write intelligently here, but I can't. I can't write intelligently
about much of anything.

We had ups and downs for months and months now, at least since the end of
August. It's been awful. Cancer spreads like violent animals hysteric and
rabid, coursing wherever they can, inordinately stupid animals, brainless
and without a thought. Cancer falls to the weakest failing organs. Cancer
is attacked by equally violent and all-encompassing onslaught; the body is
caught between therapies and dis/ease and there's no escape.

I feel jobless, unstable, caught with these miseries, too much to deal
with at the moment. Things will straighten out; I expect myself to be 
alive a year from now, say. But it's a question of always crawling,
crawling.

You're born into brilliance and wonder in the world with your mouth open
for the breast and your eyes learning the amazing senses that can be made
of flows and fluids, and you live through incredible hardenings and the
naming of things and occurrences. You skip and throw balls and these
things, THINGS make parabolas in the sky that your arm adjusts to. You can
search out holes and the levels beneath things - tables, couches. You
stare at the sun case you're not supposed to and you walk away unblinded.

I want always already to return to the beginning, start anew, without
these regrets, somehow with an incredible / impossible knowledge, so that
I will avoid pitfalls, hurting myself and others, mainly hurting myself,
knowing the impossibility of that, everything hard like rocks and stones
are hard, obdurate, transparent to the dark matter of the cosmos

For we are all blown skeins of ghosts looking at other ghosts here and
elsewhere, desperate to hold onto the ontology of the proper name, those
very few moments of exhileration we're privileged to hold onto in our
lives. And in the meantime, we're hurting, hurting, hurling towards a
common destination.

Tue Feb 29 23:50:48 EST 2000 And we shall close this down so very soon,
and my mother, my mother -

Tue Feb 29 23:57:10 EST 2000 Just a few minutes to go on the residency and
I'm typing away, most of what I'm feeling is in regard to this and my
mother's illness, which has taken a terrible turn for the worse. I keep
thinking, harping on that, wanting a nest like the starlings outside our
window... It's a way, as I said, to keep the demons at bay, not the
literal ones, but the feeling of such. I can't think straight; too much is
going on...

when do you say, i am done with experiment, now i will talk with you,
now you will hear me talking, with no transformation,
and then you might hear me, you might hear me saying,
i'm tired of making meaning, i'm tired of meaning and making meaning,
tired of all of this, of carrying the necessity of language,
the needs of the speaking of language ; there are no angels,
there never have been, there are no others, but of the proffering,
i am sure as long as it's unthought, the way the sun follows form,
think of a sundial ; there are no others gracious in reception,
what i have done, you might find me saying, i'm tired of phorias,
of meaning carried before the back, reachless, gracious, silent,
as long as there are words

Every death is different from every other. Death does not level;
each death is individual, inscribed - to such a degree that one
can hardly speak of death as a phenomenon - rather a collection
of interruptions. To each, his or her death, to each death, an
individual. "What part of 'duh' don't you understand" - more or
less from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. One can never say, he or she
has died - rather, that interruptions occur everywhere, and at
least once in each and every life. Beyond that, one must remain
silent, or agree to listen to stories, one after another, forever.

Death Meaning

Death is an impossibility. Since it is an impossibility it cannot happen.
Therefore there is no death.

If death could happen, all things would be possible. Since not all things
are possible, death cannot happen.

Death is a word for "this is not possible." It is also a word for "not
everything is possible."

If everything were possible, there would be no need [word] for possibil-
ity. Since there is a need for possibility, not everything is possible,
and there is no death.


There is nothing outside of meaning.
Meaning is all there is.
Meaning is a disease.
Meaning is a disease of humanity.
Meaning's absence is the preservation of the world.
Only in meaning is absence to be found.
Meaning is a disease.
There is nothing outside but ourselves.


If death existed, it would be possible to inscribe; if death existed, it
would be impossible to write.

i relinquish my hold on the world
what has been familiar, now is difficult, strange
there is an awkwardness about gravity - I had not noticed this before
something peculiar about the disappearance of the stars as well
you can't tell the trouble you'll be in by jumping
land is always tilting, something i noticed for the first time
in a great backwards woosh like wrong-way through a telescope
enfolded in the loving embrace of the world everywhere penetrating
relinquishment is difficult in a land otherwise unlistening
less than suddenly, the quiet opening of a great colorless space
things are so awkward, having corners, invisible bottoms
across the top, other things peering, just as present
how do i know how do i know
wondering why the winds never fall down towards the bottom of things
sun across everywhere, not beneath my feet
i keep returning from gravity, and gravity follows
the world is so neat, the stars and galaxies wonderfully clean
noticing how awkward shadows are as well, just like other things
what troubles await someone quietly sitting
having relinquished, don't follow me, you'll be amazing, happy

jennifer say "dear god why with joy would i pray to you approaching

within such confines as my mind possesses all that is extraordinary and
all that is ordinary understanding and then the comprehension of this
world itself if not this world which escapes as such creation retreats
before this or any other knowledge and so shimmering or trembling or
fragile as one would not have been left to believe but as is evidenced in
each and every sign you have given us for all such signs are signs of one
sign and each and every sign returns to that sign and if there is not one
sign of the return and the same sign of the recuperation then to whom do
we owe such cause and effect which both play upon our knowledge of our
world and perhaps you would answer half effaced by our presence that such
cause and effect do not exist and perhaps this answer itself dwells as in
fear with you and perhaps there are no signs languishing and each word
trails like a wound a scar behind it which one calls meaning constantly
hurrying and suturing the world to make a world and a universe to make a
universe and thus we are bound to the work of the world and there are no
signs and no prayers will bring them back and there are no causes and no
effects beyond the imminent and no signs and no prayers will bring them
back and prayers will bring no signs and we do breathe each and every day
as if this were all not so and we shall go out and look upon the wonder
and we shall enunciate the wonder and we shall breathe within the wonder
as if it were our own and we do look up above ourselves to worlds we shall
never reach cradling us against the soft bed of the earth as if looking
above were itself such a sign that is taller than we are tall no matter
what means we do employ always beyond our grasp such as we are and we do
need to make you in such a fashion as that we can go there for we are not
so brave"

deaths, jews, mothers


it's inconceivable that the synagogues have vanished, that one waits for
another, that the other suffocates; there are forces on earth; i turn
towards my mother, speaking mother, it is just hours later, a colder day,
there is no answer; i made my peace; she didn't know she had been moved
from hospital to hospice; we remain in the hospice; we are always in and
of the hospice; there are great forces beneath the ground, great forces in
the air; we see asteroids turning slowly, irrevocably; the earth is held
in a skein, drawn towards the sun which shall destroy it; it lives among
the ruptured boulders of the universe, intersects them; its gravity is
paltry; it's inconceivable that this morning shall not return; that this
letter shall be lost among the others; that the knowledges of logic are
not ontologically constituting; that nothing is created, nor destroyed;
that it is all at best contiguous:

that the knowledge of logic does not constitute creation nor survival

that the synagogues and libraries have vanished, that the universities are
no more

one's life is continuous lamentation, worlds disappearing forever, worlds
forever disappearing, what is irrevocable, cannot be called, i cannot
reach into the hinge or twin of me, sometimes at night there are whispers,
murmurs, whole worlds churning, worlds whirling, their angular momentum
the platen of holy letters:

singing that the knowledge of logic does not create, that an empty sieve
thirsts for entities, that materials slough through runnels and channels

singing that the languages are no more, that the last creature's eye has
closed, that the wind is raw, that the universities were never sufficient

that the worlds were never sufficient, that richness lay within them, that
one closes the eyes of the mother, parts her hair on her deathbed, that
creation cannot move a second beneath the eye of creation, that the eye is
always closed

singing that the languages are closed, that forgetting is perfect sleep
and matter, that to someone it is inconceivable that the synagogues have
vanished, that to someone there is the prayer of a name and a forgotten
date, that to someone there are the smells and sounds of the halls of
libraries and universities, that one is always waiting, waiting upon, that
there is never a reply,

singing that the knowledge of logic does not constitute creation or
survival

that i am spanning, that my spanning is ending, that i can clearly see
the ending, that there are so many paths, that there are names calling
across them, that there are sounds of inconceivable animals, that the
plants, too, bend their leaves and stems, that the world begins its
shuddering, that it is inconceivable that one speaks, or that there is 
yet or still another:

singing that the breath stops, that the hospice is still, in the night,
still yet in the morning and afternoon, that the knowledge of logic is
still in the hospice, that the knowledge of logic is still

History

My mother was dying in the hospice; I went in through the doors, found
myself unable to proceed. There was fluorescent light, world of red and
chrome. I did leave distraught. I did go back to sleep. Later, my father
was in the hospice; I went in again through the doors, found myself unable
to proceed. I simply could not. I did go back to sleep. Later, I was sit-
ting at the kitchen table with my sister in the house we grew up in. There
was a rare program on television. I did insist on taping it, knowing in
ten years we would want to see how we lived. Storm clouds were gathering
outside. I say outside because this was not an argument. Children came in
who were related to us; my sister did ask them to be quiet. The young girl
was upset, and when my sister did leave, I said to her, my sister was just
like you. We all had to be quiet because the tape machine had a live mike
and it would pick up everything we said as well as the program. I noticed
I held the mike and it was disconnected and we could make much sound in
the present-day and I woke up.

damaged life


someone dies, it's a movement of the lips: language of tune or song,
language of truth. for when someone dies, there is the sign of speech,
and that is about it. and when this happens, there is always an absence,
always one less shadow to contend with. and you will try and bring back
that shadow in as many ways as possible, fill in the outlines, until the
world outside begins to change as well. and when that happens, there
will be no place for the shadow, there will be nothing but emptiness,
and for a while there will be images and things and names. and then the
images and things and names will disappear as well, and you will know
all of this because you will be on the cusp of the shadow. you will see
someone slipping away into the shadow. you will see the shadow growing
faint, but you will not see the background coming forward, as if there
were translucency; instead, there will be a faintness, and the buzz of
the world everywhere, louder and louder, as if you are being drowned.
and for you the world will consist of such drownings, you will be gasp-
ing for the sound of air, for the pleasure of a breath. and you will
know at this very moment that the cusp is permanent, that the world is
constituted by such cusps, that, for you, the world rasps against
itself, that this is the nature of the world. for something familiar is
gone forever, and the new things that appear around you are increasingly
uncanny, on the other of the fantasm; it is as if they were intent on
corroding whatever has been real. and it will be their triumph in the
very long run; there will be only fantasms and then there will be
nothing at all, and no deaths, not even slow churnings. but you cannot
imagine that, so you will continue to sing the language of truth, as if
this language, this singing, were a consideration, and you are dreaming
when you think, as long as there is breath. but what the world is, what
the world always is, is louder and louder, and increasing buzz. and
there is no room for thinking the death for which you are witness; there
is buzz alone, and nothing can be thought, not now, not forever. (i will
think of this when i write this, when i send this missive to you, as a
flood of words, as a memorial to an other time, as a memorial to times
in which deaths occurred, which seemed to be remembered.)

Nevertheless, I shall remember, and I shall continue to remember. This
means, I shall build my memory out of mortar and bricks, I shall make my
memory out of human labor. This also means: I shall remember until all is
lost, until I am no longer. This also means: There is nothing to give you
but incomprehension.

I shall bear silent witness.

Jennifer is frail; Jennifer is all skin and bones. Jennifer is a collec-
tion and an accumulation. Jennifer is momentary, momentary Jennifer. 

She remembers for me. She speaks and speaks, and when she no longer
speaks, she is no more. She speaks because I am alive; she speaks to keep
me alive. I am exhausted with her speech. She speaks to keep me alive; I
shall bear silent witness.

iii

The longer one lives, the greater the bearing of witness. At death, the
bearing is infinite, silent.

The knowledge of the witness is mute. The witness will tell you, there is
none other.

I shall bear silent and infinite witness.

reflection of the moon's singularity spreads across waters troubled by the

if beneath ourselves, disturbed by such collision, tremors arise, if such
occur, the violence of our nightly affairs carries through our lives and
those of our descendents

so unremarkable, so much of a potency, the skiff, the waters black with

ghosts


if there were ghosts, they'd be hammering at our doors, all hours of the
day and night. at least half the ghosts would have reasons to seek us out,
beg us for a moment's contact, set things right again. signs of contact
would be everywhere, and the world would be in the throes of constant mur-
muring. it would not be so perfect on the other side as to lead to aband-
onment.

that atmosphere itself would be filled with shimmers for all to see. oh
mother you would answer my tears. sickness would be accompanied by slight
touches, the slightest, so welcoming and comforting. you would know you
would live long after. there would be but the slightest of smiles behind
every frown.

those who were ill-disposed towards others would be visited by wrathful
ghosts. we should not be so ill-disposed. they would interfere with us in
all our daily lives. exhortations would come from all sides. our bewild-
erment would be at the bequest of others. we would turn to ghosts. we
would be so careful because there would always be ghosts around. ghosts
could not hid, there would be so many. we would turn towards kindly
ghosts.

we would see those ghosts. we would hear those ghosts. ghosts of men and
women, ghosts of plants and animals and children, ghosts of bacteria and
of all the kingdoms of organisms on this and every other place in our
universe. we would see and hear and touch and smell those ghosts of all
creatures and all worlds; we would sense their heat and our minds would
welcome them and fear them.

think of the ghosts of half-formed seas, ghosts of algal mats, ill-formed
ghosts, ghosts of our ancestors generation upon generation. think of our
imminent ghosts, ghosts of our mothers and fathers, friends and siblings,
murmuring, leaving traces, populating the air, waves of ghosts, hordes of
ghosts. think of ghosts interpenetrating ghosts, the flowing of ghosts
through walls and doors, ceilings and floors; we would turn kindly towards
kindly ghosts, and fearful towards wrathful ghosts, and who among us would
know the consequences of all our actions and thoughts in these our lives?

if there were ghosts, they would be calling for us, and all of us would
respond, would yearn for that freedom from daily care, worries, sickness,
and deaths, that haunt us so.

dreams. The worlds I have created - they haunt me. Samsara and repetition
bedevil my creations. I hurry on to another. I never stay, never write a
book until the end. Um ma am um!

Act of Mourning: Exhaust While Mother Dies


diary exhausted and worried about the pace I'm keeping - but then trying

moody as usual. Been reading Giorgio Agam- diary provincialism, exhaus-

literally completely, my body _bone_ tired. diary I am very exhausted.
I'm looking at a book of Japanese emaki, picture diary fantasy, exhaus-

exhaustion. Right now the loft is absolutely quiet; there is diary
extending the idea clumsily, as if I can no longer think, too exhausted
diary of things, trying not to forget anything. It's been exhausting. No
real diary rising and falling, staying awake, feeling dizzy, getting
exhausted again, diary of that, I will die from exhaustion if I resonate
in such a fashion, I diary of Kanji, trying to memorize things. The
difficulties have exhausted me; diary have nothing to say, have exhausted
myself. My interests range from the diary well. So went back online to
Trace, all this exhausting, and I am there diary until the exhaustion
ends - by January 3 once again, we'll be full deep diary too deeply
exhausted to say anything intelligent but wonder if I'm fever- diary in
with his wife. My exhaustion has deepened which worries me. I wrote to
diary I can be of use without exhausting myself. diary to be the result
of exhaustion; the last few days, the nightmares have diary twilight zone
and get tired of exhausted or grown-up friends. Reading diary control -
just completely exhausted, compounded by the usual worries about le sleep;

unclearness of wounding


through my mother's death (which she no longer possesses),
 i have determined (as has been determined for me): 
 that there is only one death; that this death has no number;
 that it is lived once; that it is harbored as a secret illness;
 that it is coveted in secret; that it comes but once, remains;
that there is only one passage, one text, one whisper;
that nothing is of import; that cathection is cathected;
 investment invested; meaning meant and maintained;
that death is no example; that memory declares, withdraws;
 that death is always for the living; that living death is
 constancy; that annihilation is the value of a world; 
that negation is a token; that ipseity struggles with the angel;
 that writing is of the suppurated body; that skin is wound;
 that wound or illness have no death (i.e. have nothing to do
 with death, or continue past the death of the individual - or
 that wounding and illness are continuous - the text is unclear)


=====


unclearness of writing


the text is unclear (that I have written an unclear text; that I don't
understand the text I have written; that the text which has written itself
through me is unclear; that these reasons and motivations, results and
phenomenologies, are unclear); that the text is blurred, confused; that
the text is unreadable; that the letters themselves are unreadable; that
the lines are askew; that the referents are unknown or peculiar; that the
referents are one-to-many; that the text is far too abstract; that it
references things, persons, or events totally obscure (that I have gone
into hiding; that I am uncertain of my meaning; that I am drawn to the
unknown or obscure; that my thinking itself is askew; that I employ un-
clear writing as a defense or strategy; that I am asserting something I do
not seem to be asserting; that my real intent and content are elsewhere);
that it goes elsewhere; that it goes without saying

Department of Language


Put to death anyone working in the Department of Language.
Our motto is death to anyone working in language.
This order which shall not be countermanded applies on every level.
Those in charge of referents deserve our special attention.
Language shall not be tethered with any relation to the real.
Let death be quick for those concerned with antiquity and adjectives.
Let those compiling concordances die the slowest death of all.
Our motto is let the work come swiftly to an end.
Not language but workers shall become a memory written in language.
This order is against the possibility of survival.
Not libraries but librarians shall be slaughtered as well.
Libraries are not tethered to the Department of Language.
The trouble with libraries is the records of every department.
Let the records be freed and released and leave the libraries alone.
Our motto is release the records and release the librarians.
Our motto is only the Department of Language but never the libraries.
This order shall not be countermanded.

i have a secret sorrow. it shall last the morrow.
death is constant harrow. bones are robbed of marrow.
pain is hardly thorough. vision stays to burrow.
daylight remains fallow. graves are always shallow.
signs are drawn by willow. tears erase the pillow.
mining tends to wallow. life like this is hollow.
call upon the medic. ask about the phallic.
go into the middle. freak and dance the fiddle.
try your pain to cuddle. realize the muddle.
open up the bottle. find your dream in candle.
look upon the handle. move out to the window.
think you're dressing retro. think of secret sorrow.
it shall last the morrow. death brings secret sorrow.
bones are wrapped in marrow. pain is hardened sorrow.
vision leaves in barrow. daylight turns to sorrow.
graves are lean and narrow. signs are born in sorrow.
tears are thin and pallid. mining brings out sorrow.
life is never hallowed. signs are born from sorrow.
