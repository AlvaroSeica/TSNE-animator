Memory of a Walk


I walked last Wednesday night from the Modern Culture and Media building 
at Brown University to the train station downtown. I took the 6:16 to New 
York. It arrived around 9:50 at Penn Station. On the way I remembered the 
walk. I followed myself step by step, reconstructing as I went along. This 
was six days ago. Now again I remember.

What did you think you were doing?

Memory and reconstruction worries me. I wanted to follow myself. I didn't 
think of this at the time, that is the time of the walk itself, but only 
later. I conductor asked if I were a philosopher; I think I appeared deep 
in thought. I wanted to remember as much as possible. Later, several times 
in the past six days, I thought I would try and remember again, try to 
write everything down. But I thought this would take too much effort; it 
wasn't until now, Tuesday, that I've had the energy to proceed.

What did you take with you?

I'm clearing my belongings out of Leslie Thornton's office. This trip I 
took, in addition to what I brought up, a Cambodian bowed instrument, a 
pair of slippers, some extra toiletries, a white towel. The towel and a 
plastic bag were wrapped around the instrument and inserted into a cloth 
bag. It was damp out. I added a polka-dotted umbrella as well, in case I 
needed it.

Where did you go?

I went down the stairs and out the front door. Susan and Ellen were in the 
office talking. I didn't say anything to them. I walked out the door and 
turned right.

What did you do then?

I walked to the corner. I thought about going straight down as usual, but 
instead crossed the street. I began walking up a slight hill to the Brown 
Quadrangle. I passed two people as I turned into the Quadrangle. I took a 
diagonal left, which would leave me out between two libraries.

Wait, I remember crossing the first intersection. I think there was little 
or no traffic.

Then?

Then I walked diagonally through the cold mist, almost but not quite a 
rain. I went through the gates to the top of the street. I didn't notice 
the sculpture on the left; usually I look at it. I crossed the street. I 
was surprised there was no traffic. I thought that usually there was 
traffic. I began the descent of the hill. I passed the location of the old 
Brown Music Department, where I had played several times; I thought about 
that. I didn't think about the arts building that replaced it. I went 
straight down the hill. I arrived at Benefit Street.

At Benefit Street you had several choices. What did you decide here?

I crossed Benefit street; I believe there was some traffic, but I'm not 
sure. I continued going down the hill. I passed a corner building and 
looked in a window. I wondered whether the window was where my studio at 
Rhode Island School of Design used to be. I thought again about the 
accusation I had stolen equipment and wondered how S. could possibly think 
that since I had no place to take it but the school itself. I looked in 
other windows on the way down; they were studios. I think they might have 
been drawing studios; I'm not sure. I reached the bottom of the hill.

Now you're into the city itself, or at least the outskirts of the city, by 
Providence River. What did you do?

I crossed the intersection here. This one I remember being easy. I arrived 
at the bank of the river, the bank nearest the hill. I thought that the 
time before I had crossed and taken the other bank. I found that the river 
split, and that I was thrown off-course, that I ended up guiding myself by 
the Statehouse dome. This time I felt tired, and stayed on the nearer 
bank. I looked into the water as I walked towards the train station; I 
couldn't see anything. I reached the next corner.

Then there was traffic?

There was a lot of traffic. I ran across the street; I was almost hit. I 
continued on the other side.

Did you press the button for the traffic signal?

I remember a button, but it might have been farther on. I didn't press it, 
I think. Perhaps I did.

And then?

Then I continued walking. I think it was either this block or the next, 
possibly the end of this block, still by the river, that I heard foot- 
steps. Or possibly saw someone ahead of me. But I think it began with the 
footsteps. At the next intersection.

We're then at another heavily trafficked one?

Yes, the footsteps belonged to a woman, I think possibly a student, carry- 
ing a backpack or small suitcase of some sort. I didn't see her full-on; I 
couldn't identify her, but thought she might be blond.

What happened? 

She had crossed the street and I crossed as well, somewhat behind her. 
This was the second time I was almost hit; I wanted to make the light, 
since the signals were long.

And then?

The road curved up ahead. Wait, there was a four-way stop intersection. 
She continued up the curve on the left. I walked part of the way across 
the bridge, crossing the Providence River. I stopped and looked down in 
the water. I was looking for the herring or shad family fish I had seen 
there before, in large schools. It was dark out; I looked for ripples in 
the water. The week before I was guided by ripples. This time there were 
none. I couldn't remember the name of the fish, something like mulhagen; I 
still can't remember. I was frustrated, worried that I couldn't remember.

After looking in the water for a while?

I crossed the street. There was hardly any traffic. I looked up ahead to 
see if the student was heading to the train station. I thought I saw her; 
I couldn't be sure. I stopped on the other side of the street, which was 
the other side of the bridge. I looked again down at the black water; I 
was looking for the fish on the other side. Most of the time I had seen 
them on this, the other side. This time again there was nothing, no 
ripples, at least none visible. But wait.

Wait?

On the first, left-hand side of the bridge, I saw a leaf in the water; it 
was large, and looked like one of the fish on its side; I wondered if it 
was in fact one that was dying. When I looked on the other, right-hand 
side of the bridge, I saw several more, and it was clear that they were 
leaves, slowly going down the river.

Which way were they going?

I'm not sure; the river flowed slowly, but I believe from the right-hand 
side to the left-hand side and beyond.

And then?

Then I began walking up the hill towards the train station. I had again to 
go out into the street because the sidewalk was partly closed due to 
construction. I walked past a number of parked cars on the right, in this 
fashion. I noticed the construction was coming along, and remembered 
hearing that apartments were to be built here. As I walked up the hill I 
walked over a recently-asphalted entrance to the construction site, or 
near the entrance. I wondered why the asphalt had been poured; it could 
only be temporary and didn't seem to serve any purpose. I continued up the 
sidewalk.

Did you see any birds?

No, often in the daytime, particularly in the spring, I had seen birds 
around the site and in the trees directly to the left of the train 
station. But this time there was nothing. I looked down into the huge 
excavation beyond the immediate construction and noticed for the second 
time, the train platform, I think it was the platform for the number 1 and 
2 tracks, jutting out into it. The platform looked oddly spacious and 
beautiful in the dark. I continued walking past the trees.

This was near the taxicab stand?

This went directly past the taxi stand. I saw a number of drivers standing 
around; they were speaking a language I didn't understand. At first I 
thought, this might be Pakistani, but then I thought Italian; I couldn't 
hear well enough. The drivers all seemed to know one another. I wondered 
what would happen if a new driver came along, who didn't speak the 
language - would he or she be accepted in the group? Would the group, on 
occasion, speak English to him or her? Would the driver be ignored? This 
went on only for an instant. I reached the station doors and went in.

Just went in?

I remember looking at my cellphone on the way, at least twice, checking on 
the time. I was early as usual; I think I arrived at 5:34, for the 6:16, 
but I'm not sure. I was hungry.

How long did the walk take?

I think it took about twenty-one minutes, but I couldn't be sure. If I had 
gone directly, it would have taken between seventeen and eighteen.

You were hungry? Were you hungry the whole time?

I was hungry the whole time; I had only breakfast at Louie's, a #1 with 
orange juice extra, I think, beforehand. I was going to drink some Red 
Bull to keep me going through the day, but had a large coffee with skim 
milk instead; the Red Bull is still in the office.

So what did you do?

I went to the small cafe inside the train station. The man who served me 
wasn't there; the woman was. I had often wondered about their relation- 
ship; they seemed tight. I ordered, I think, something with apricot; I'm 
not sure. I do remember eating it without getting sticky; I didn't have to 
wash my hands afterwards.

And this whole time you were carrying both your camera bag with various 
things you had brought with you, as well as the cloth bag contraption with 
the Cambodian instrument and other things?

Yes. I believe I also took back a copy of The Structure of Reality with me 
on this trip. I had a copy of Claire's demo DVD, since I'm writing a 
recommendation for her. I remember I didn't change clothes; the clean ones 
were still in the bag. I had some trail mix left over from the ride up. I 
didn't want to order anything on the train.

And you were reading?

Yes, I had books with me, but I'm not sure I remember them. I definitely 
had Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, which I had read; now I wanted to 
finish Sanditon which was in the same Penguin volume, which of course I 
did. And I had a copy of David Hume's Enquiry with me as well; I had been 
reading about miracles. But I think there might have been a third book. 
The week before I had carried a relatively medieval history of the tantric 
schools of Tibet, but I don't think I had it with me this time.

What else were you carrying?

Other than the usual identifications, I had a small Olympus solid-state 
recorder for notes. I didn't use it - I had been hoping to. The camera bag 
was somewhat heavy of course. Another item - a small power supply for the 
phone.

Do you remember going down the stairs from the office?

Not very well. I do remember having to negotiate the stairs because of the 
awkwardness of the instrument package. Once outside, things were easy. I 
had been afraid of rain; the skies were threatening all day. But as I 
said, there was none, or rather just a light misting, slightly, nothing 
more.

Money?

I had taken sixty dollars with me, but had spent very little. I spent 
nothing on the train on the way up, so I had all of that. I spent little 
there, and little on the train. I had walked down to Wickenden or 
Wickendon street to go to an antique shop; I was hoping to find some 
useful books, but nothing seemed promising. So I had most of the money 
with me of course. I also had four rolls of unused Tri-X and Plus-X (the 
new Plus-X) 16mm movie film to shoot in the winter and spring. And on the 
way up I had brought a mini-DV tape for transferring the second roll I had 
shot, but the roll wasn't back and the tape stayed in the office.

Anything else?

Some recommendation forms from Claire; I had to fill these out. I was 
afraid they would get bent. I put them between the pages of something else 
I was carrying back - I don't remember, a pamphlet of some sort.

Were you tired when you walked down to the train station?

I was extremely tired; I had hardly slept the night before - I coughed a 
lot, there were sounds around, etc. I should add I sleep in the office to 
save money; there's a futon. So I was glad that the air was bracing. I 
went down to the train platform itself - #1 as usual - at 6:04 - I 
remember looking at the clock - because it was open to the air and would 
wake me up. I walked down; I haven't taken the elevator for a long time. I 
noticed that the construction inside the station was down for the first 
time - there were new escalators installed, but the one for track #1 only 
went up.

Anything else?

Only that I remembered, as I approached the station, that I would be too 
tired, and it would be too late, to go to the Border's bookshop in the 
nearby mall. When I went into the station, I wouldn't come out again, at 
least until the train I boarded left, which it did, two minutes late.

[This hasn't been sent out in over three years but might still provide an
introduction to the Internet Text project.]

==========================================================================

(periodic notice on my work)


Internet Text: Philosophy and Psychology -             11/07
                                                       (last was 10/04)

Recent work is related to human modeling, analog/digital distinction,
ontological/epistemological issues.

Older recent work:

"Recent work has been building on hardware software wetware outware
issues, especially the phenomenology of the virtual, motion capture, the
current political state of the nation; I have been moving into new realms
of representation in which body and substructure are mutually
problematized. I am also working on extending some theoretical work
dealing with cybernetics and (non) aristotelian logics."

===

This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. Some URLs:
recent http://www.alansondheim.org/
http://www.alansondheim.org/portal/.nikuko NO LONGER VALID
WVU 2004 projects http://www.as.wvu.edu/clcold/sondheim/files/
Trace projects http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm
partial mirror at http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
almost all of the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
partial or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

===

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 150 files, or 20,000
printed pages. It began in 1/1994, and has continued as an extended
meditation on cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures,
symptomologies of the edge.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Susan Graham, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, Azure,
and Nikuko in particular. Most recently, texts are created which are
aligned with still or video images, texts which surround them as uneasy
allies, texts which speak for the silence of representation itself.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death,
sexuality, virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical
reality, computer languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the
text; the resulting splits and convergences owe something to dance,
phenomenology, programming, deconstruction, linguistics, philosophy and
prehistory, as well as the domains of online worlds in relation to
everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions. I continue working on cdroms and dvd+s of my work, creating
samplers and live performances.
RECENTLY CDs HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY FIREMUSEUM, AN LP BY QBICO
FOR DVDs PLEASE SEND REQUEST
CHECK OUT WORK ON FACEBOOK, NING, http://nikuko.blogspot.com

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi,
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out
of performative language - soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces. Recent software used has included Blender, Gimp, Poser,
motion capture, Audacity, Cooledit, perl and awk programs, Calculon and
other Zaurus (linux) pda applications, and audio/video input from a
variety of cameras and other devices.

I have been working in collaboration at times, most notably with Azure
Carter, my partner, and Foofwa d'Imobilite, perhaps the artist/dancer I
feel closest to, in terms of concerns about exhaustion, injury, speed,
flight, politics, history of the body, human-avatar intersections.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

The texts are roughly in the order written; the last-entered at the moment
is ns. They may be read in any order, and distributed in any medium;
please credit me. I would appreciate in return any comments you may
have.

Small Incident at the Entrance to the Space


Nikuko: I couldn't wait for Him to come. I was Caught in the Traipsing of 
Desire. His magic Touch saved me from Incipient Void.

Travis: I was walking by. I had nothing to do. Suddenly this Avatar 
appeared before Me. She was Desperate. She was a Lost Hungry Ghost. I felt 
great Compassion. In the Midst of Emptiness, I reached out to Her. I 
pulled her back from the Brink of Samsara.

Nikuko: Now I can enter Higher Realms. Beings surround Me. I have Action 
Way and Knowledge Way. I am Ten-Direction Knowledge. 

Travis: I placed Her in the Center of the Residence. There is Nothing more 
for Her. There is Much to be learned. Within Her, without Her.

Nikuko: Within Me, without Me, Yoni and Lingam. I am sheave-formed, Yoni
torn from Me, Lingam torn from You. I couldn't wait for You to come. Here
I shall save you. Here, Movement, Suffering, Betrayal. There, Void-Touch 
of the Six Senses. 

Travis: I embrace the Twelve Links of co-dependent co-origination. I was 
crying for You. 

Nikuko: You were screaming. You are sheave-formed. Look at You! Look at 
What you Are!

Travis: I was Crying for Help.

Nikuko: I had Nothing to do...

Bondage of Existence


We were talking about Second Life this evening and I realized something, 
that no matter how much you critique the application/site, you talk about 
events there - and events as if they're happening in the 'real world.' 
What other environment generates such a self-created ongoing diegetic? 
Things falling from the sky, people griefing others, people wandering 
around, creating and destroying, talking and talking, maybe making a liv- 
ing. SL plays the 'real world,' of course however defined. And that is its 
strength - semantics and content moving among ordinary subjectivities.


"There exists not one being who is unenlightened from the awakening to his 
own nature By their very intrinsic nature the beings in hell, ghosts, 
animals, gods, titans, men and even worms and so on in the dung, are 
eternally blissful, for they do not merely experience the pleasure of the 
gods and the titans." (Hevajra Tantra, trans. Farrow and Menon.)

The Trial of Adolf Eichmann
Session 68
(Part 1 of 9) 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Session No. 68 
23 Sivan 5721 (7 June 1961) 

Presiding Judge: I declare the sixty-eighth Session of the trial open. 

Decision No. 72 

We confirm the request of the Attorney General and will permit the 
exhibition of films to illustrate the evidence of the Prosecution 
witnesses, on condition that the films will be sufficiently authenticated. 

For reasons of security, because of the blacking-out of the hall during 
the screening, the public, with the exception of journalists, will not be 
permitted to be in the Courtroom at the time of the screening. 

Attorney General: I would ask Mr. Dinur to mount the witness stand. 

Presiding Judge: Do you speak Hebrew? 

Witness Dinur: Yes. 

[The witness is sworn.] 

Presiding Judge: What is your full name? 

Witness: Yehiel Dinur. 

Attorney General: Mr. Dinur, you live in Tel Aviv, at 78 Rehov Meggido, 
and you are a writer? 

Witness Dinur: Yes. 

Q. You were born in Poland? 

A. Y

es. Q. And you were the author of the books Salamandra, The House of 
Dolls, The Clock Above the Head and They called Him Piepel? 

A. Yes. 

Q. What was the reason that you hid your identity behind the pseudonym "K. 
Zetnik," Mr. Dinur? 

A. It was not a pen name. I do not regard myself as a writer and a 
composer of literary material. This is a chronicle of the planet of 
Auschwitz. I was there for about two years. Time there was not like it is 
here on earth. Every fraction of a minute there passed on a different 
scale of time. And the inhabitants of this planet had no names, they had 
no parents nor did they have children. There they did not dress in the way 
we dress here; they were not born there and they did not give birth; they 
breathed according to different laws of nature; they did not live - nor 
did they die - according to the laws of this world. Their name was the 
number "Kazetnik".* {*23Kazett=Konzentrationslager - Katzetnik: inmate of 
a concentration camp} They were clad there, how would you call it... 

Q. Yes. Is this what you wore there? [Shows the witness the prison garb of 
Auschwitz.] 

A. This is the garb of the planet called Auschwitz. And I believe with 
perfect faith that I have to continue to bear this name so long as the 
world has not been aroused after this crucifixion of a nation, to wipe out 
this evil, in the same way as humanity was aroused after the crucifixion 
of one man. I believe with perfect faith that, just as in astrology the 
stars influence our destiny, so does this planet of the ashes, Auschwitz, 
stand in opposition to our planet earth, and influences it. 

If I am able to stand before you today and relate the events within that 
planet, if I, a fall-out of that planet, am able to be here at this time, 
then I believe with perfect faith that this is due to the oath I sworn to 
them there. They gave me this strength. This oath was the armour with 
which I acquired the supernatural power, so that I should be able, after 
time - the time of Auschwitz - the two years when I was a Musselman, to 
overcome it. For they left me, they always left me, they were parted from 
me, and this oath always appeared in the look of their eyes. 

For close on two years they kept on taking leave of me and they always 
left me behind. I see them, they are staring at me, I see them, I saw them 
standing in the queue... 

Q. Perhaps you will allow me, Mr. Dinur, to put a number of questions to 
you, if you will agree? 

A. [Tries to continue] I remember... 

Presiding Judge: Mr. Dinur, kindly listen to what the Attorney General has 
to say. 

[Witness Dinur rises from his place, descends from the witness stand, and 
collapses on the platform. The witness fainted.] 

Presiding Judge: I think we shall have to adjourn the session. I do not 
think that we can continue. 

Attorney General: I did not anticipate this. 

Presiding Judge: [After some time] I do not think that it is possible to 
go on. We shall adjourn the Session now, and please, Mr. Hausner, inform 
us of the condition of the witness and whether he will at all be able to 
give his testimony today. And I would ask you to do so soon. 

[The Session was resumed.] 

Attorney General: With the Court's permission, in view of the unfortunate 
incident that has taken place, I shall have to arrange the evidence on 
Auschwitz differently. It was intended that Mr. Dinur should give us a 
general description, so that the other witnesses could supplement it on 
various partial aspects. I ask the Court's indulgence if the picture now 
will not be presented in the manner in which we originally planned. The 
witness Dinur will not be able to continue his evidence, I understand. He 
has been taken away from this building and his state of health will not 
permit him to continue. 

I call Joseph Zalman Kleinman.

arbeit-world


Walter Benjamin and Theodorno in a discussion of Net-life, Second Life, 
and Crashland Tokyo. Just a snippet of intellectual work on the gritty 
industrial wasteland of the northern east coast. The view is always 
hallucinatory.

It's raining here among ordinary people. There's a sound of menace in the 
background; nations and peoples are stirring, not always with equivalent 
goals in mind. The species is out of control; roads are gouges of the 
civil, keeping the wild at bay. The primary characteristic of the human: 
an enormous inertia in the midst of plague, floods, fires, crusades, wars, 
slaughter. The human is always on stand-by. If it were otherwise, there 
would be different news to report.

It's snowing now, weather veering back and forth, downed wires. Pacific 
world, one world, inconceivable. Power seized is power held. Global warm- 
ing, peace overture, restraint, is always the face of the other. What is a 
poor primate to do.

Among the aesthetics of the grit there's the power of absence. This film 
never hurt anyone. The dead film: sightless, deaf, untouching, untouch- 
able. The occupants hurtling down the road have always already passed this 
way, passed that way. This is a new world which is identical with the old, 
the flattened world, flat philosophy, planar. He speaks, it's always this 
way. He answers with the same.

Image


What sort of object is my mandala-image? Certainly not symbolic; while 
elements represent, the mandala-image itself stands for nothing, neither 
power nor deity, fecundity, rebirth, emptiness. Nothing stands for empti- 
ness; nothing stands in for emptiness. And certainly not ikonic; nothing 
is there but the image within an aegis or indifferently existing. Then 
again, not indexical; let's say it's eaten, ingested, but there's no 
pointer, anything like that. Let's say it's of the true world, the image 
itself, and let's say it's the becoming of the subject, placed under 
erasure by the subject, placed under erasure by nothing, then of the gone 
world, then of nothing. Let's say there's neither mind nor emptiness, 
uncertainly not inherently existing image. Let's say the image is of the 
imaginary, that the true world is of the imaginary, but the imaginary has 
no inherent existence. Let's say the true world is under erasure, that 
whatever clings, clings to erasure. Let's leave it, but not leave it at 
that.



There were eyes in the walls. There were eyes in the table. There were 
eyes in the telephone. There were eyes in the keyboard, eyes in the 
computer, eyes in the mousepad. There were eyes in the ceiling, eyes in 
the floor. There were eyes in the clock that said tick-tock.
