The Apt Word


To write modernism is to write in voiceless voice.
To write in voiceless voice is an enunciation.
The enunciated is always pronounced.
This is based on the apt word.
Whatever I write, there is the apt word.
In terms of cleverness, the reader desires this, the apt word.
The apt word makes one famous, i.e. on the road to fame.
Apt may be an apt word.
Writing this style is always a well-honed craft.
I try to procure your agreement or perhaps disagreement.
My taste is apparent on the page. 
I am an expert in the use of words and their exactitude.
More specifically, the apt words.
Every phrase, every poem, is a composition.
The poet works hard at the composition, every word must fit.
The fit word is the apt word, both harmonious and perfect.
A poet claws its way to the apt word and beyond.
There is light on the other side of the apt word.
The apt word must not appear contrived.
Or it must appear contrived as a collusion between reader and writer.
The apt word must be secretly clever.
Or it must appear clever as such a collusion.
It's nature, the apt word, unnoticed but graces a reputation.
The audience knows the poet by the apt word.
Every poet has a different approach to the apt word.
And every poet has a different approach to the rest of it.
But it is all carefully crafted and that is why we care about poets.
And it is beautifully written and full of surprises.
And that is why we care about poetry.
I am serious about this, this apt word.
It is a well-turned phrase that contributes to the whole.
In a sense it is the whole.
Love language, love the apt, advertising and poetry pick and choose.
Here I am writing, searching for the perfect form.
Oh there must be more to this than that, there is not.
My words are perhaps not apt enough.
My turns of phrase...

in the near future you will hear new sounds
they are coming from the ghosts hovering near the old covered bridge
cows on the hill turned their backs on us
early the electricity failed in large parts of the region
there were violent thunderstorms and near the house, a crackle
the crackle continued at regular intervals
interspersed were the moans, they were murmuring to us
few of them as something jostled for our attention
moan, crackle, moan, crackle, crackle, sometimes a sheet of sound
haunted they were, these hills
haunted the bridge, haunted the dismal brook
haunted the bullfrogs speaking and hearing the moans
hearing the moans by the side of the pond
we were radio radio radio by the side of the pond
we were hearing the moans, we were listening
the radio, we were listening, the aerial and the recording
we were radio radio radio
and the recording of it, the sounds, sooner or later on this site
of the haunting, something moving through the bridge
something there and moving, we were sure of it

Hand-written insert into

A Pocket Dictionary (Chinese-English) and Pekingese Syllabary by Chauncey 
Goodrich, Shanghai: Kwang Hsuel Publishing House: 1933, representing the 
214 radicals in a prose composition:

One down points to the left bent barb, two above men. Man enters eight 
limits to cover the icy bench over the box of knives strong. He wraps a 
ladle in a box and conceals it with ten diviners with joints under the 
cliff with selfish right. At the third mouth of the enclosure the earth 
scholar follows moving slowly till evening a big woman son. Under the roof 
she inches along like a small lame corpse to get sprouts from the mountain 
streams by work for her self. He gets thirty caps and shields for his 
immaturity needs covering then move on till she gives him a bow, dart, a 
boar's head, a plumage. Steps away for her heart like a spear from a 
window a hand with branch strikes like an elegant bushel of axes. Squares 
without sun she speaks under the moon of the wood still owing and asks him 
to stop killing viciously. So he denies and compares his hair, name, 
breath, fire, and the claws his father crosse. At from his coach he slices 
like the tooth of an ox or a dog and the black jade melons on the tile so 
sweet. We produce use things from the field with a cloth roll to keep off
disease as back to back with white skin we dish them before our eyes. 
Lamas and darts on the stone reveal footprints grain the cave as set up 
with bamboo rice. Silk threads of pottery are in a net of goat's feathers 
of one who is old and yet able to plow with ears like pencils. In his 
flesh the statesman from his arrival at the mortar with his tongue opposed 
the boat of defiant color. In grasses a tiger and insects draw blood to do 
up the clothes from the West with the sights of horned words. In the 
bitter time of walking from the city with a winejar, each separate mile 
near gold pieces (from the long) doors. When the mound is reached, 
short tailed birds are in the rain on the green with wrong faces of 
rawhide, leather, and leeks. At the sound of book leaves in the wind they 
fly to eat the heads of the fragrant horses with bones on high. My hair 
strives with the herbs and I offer to the vase of spirits, fish, birds 
from the saltland, dear and wheat. Hemp strings and yellow millets, black 
embroidery, toads, tripods, drums, and rats, noses. Even the front teeth of 
dragons, tortoises, flutes.

unusual formation of rhomboid virga

= this is a straightforward (increased contrast) photograph of virga from 
a stormfront in Omaha, Nebraska - the first and only time I've seen a 
rhomboid formation - the evaporating rain moving in two planes that, from 
the viewpoint of the observer, are practically at right-angles -

they are regular but editing changes repetition
at the end i have left the clicks as is

old people should be killed
they're in the way
they're useless

their flesh tastes bad
they're shapeless skin and bones
or layers of ugly fat

their minds are dead
their minds are waiting

look at the old man
push him down the hill
he can't think when he's falling

he can't think when he's standing
when he's standing he's falling
he's always falling when he's standing

i wake up and hope you'll kill me
i'm useless and can't think a thought

My answers regarding my murder trial in regards to the death of James 
Abbot, March 12, 1963.

Yes, sure about that, yes indeed, no, i wasn't there, it might have been, 
i don't remember, all right, i did it, no, never again, not at all, yes i 
bludgeoned the guy, no, no, heh, absolutely not, not a word of it, 
unbelievable, could be, couldn't be, at one in the afternoon, i ate out 
that night, i was alone, no one saw me, i chopped his head off with a meat 
ax, i didn't do anything, how could you possibly believe that, this trial 
is fixed, i ate his brains out, no, i'm completely innocent, i'm clean as 
a new-born baby, pure as that virgin i fucked before i blew her head off, 
i wouldn't hurt a fly, i never knew James Abbot, i never saw James Abbot, 
why would i hurt him, i cut his heart out, the children are buried in a 
big pit, yes they are, i've ever committed a crime, i haven't hurt anyone, 
i couldn't harm a human being, no, no, yes, yes, yes, i'm sorry, i'll just 
answer the questions, i have a happy life, why would i do anything to 
destroy it, yes, i was lunchtime, i was with some friends, i don't 
remember who exactly, most of them are dead now, i went to bed early, i 
watched some tv, no, i don't remember the shows, yes, yes, no, yes yes

On March 14, 1963, i was acquitted of the murder of James Abbot.

an absolute burst or vertical signal in the for of + within an otherwise 
quiescent mode. 0/1 or Kronecker delta? 

onset and damping 0; at x = y of infinite +/-? this doesn't matter; give 
it the prominence of a spike.

what happens to energy at a well-defined frequency? close in and quantum 
effects appear. 

the spike is a trigger. what is the response time?

the speed, not the half-life, of particle decay?

dear mathematical physicist, you see I do not know what I am talking 
about. I am only certain that this spike plays a role in the phenomenology 
of the analogic and digital. 

analogic as adjectival; digital the same, as discrete, binary. or such of 
the discrete that has a modus operandi as binary.

consider the factory or configuration of the digital, its appearance as 
governing artifacture at a particular moment in civilization - when it is 
realized that the analogic may be _scanned._

but the digital is not always constructed, as the collapse of the wave 
equation implies. or rather it is always constructed - always an _action_ 
- but not necessarily an artifacture or technological production - which 
have teleology in mind.

what are the nature/s of the spikes in very low frequency radio for 
example? is the (natural) digital always the result of a _collapse_?

these (naive) questions are on the tip of the tongue, so to speak - an 
array.

and dear mathematical physicist, i hope you will be able to listen to the 
musings of an unaffiliated artist / theorist, who is trying to get it 
right, but may not always succeed.


analogic smear

postulate the analogical from the position of the operations of the 
analogical. i talked about, apologizing all the while for exhaustion, the 
relation of the analogical to deep identity, identity all the way damental 
ontologies and their relationship to the analogical and identity real, the 
truth is messy, noisy, analogic, irreducible, fuzzy. as listerv. this 
analogical labelling is superficial consider the analog is atemporal and 
time is analogical substructure integral the body analogical body is 
digital substructure substructure digital is body analogical body the 
integral substructure to analogical print differential biological material 
raster is the analog is atemporal and time is analogical time. this 
continuous world appears analogic. any element of the analogic real is 
interconnected and inseparable. the inherent. the application of truth 
values is digital. the analogic is a membrane. the analogic is dirty, 
inseparable, unbreakable. the dirty analogic problematizes its symbolic. 
the clean digital is the digital object is analogic. the analogic 
representation is digital. ghosts are embedded within the analogic. ghosts 
are excluded from the the analogic. to erase a distinction is to corrode 
it, to sublimate it to the analogic analogic. the creation of a signifier 
re-inscribes the signified image of the image is analogic. within the 
analogic real there is always room for error. "one can reverse this, in a 
sense, considering the application of analogic analogic, it might be a 
fairly useless exercise. as stimulate a vigorous debate on the 
relationship of digital and analogic the other. to stay with the filter is 
to remain analogic, deeply human, (dis)interested observer but from that a 
music producer. the analogic is note towards a foundational phenomenology 
of analogic/discrete 'domains.' ving the analogic and discrete (digital), 
we will get nowhere. where the digital exists under the aegis of 
fabrication, and the analogic tends towards sharpening and the analogic 
the physical world collapses ( and it's in codework that the mix of 
analogic and discrete 'ordering,' gestalt is both surplus and reduction. 
the inhabiting of text is analogic, assurance of purity. beyond that, 
there is nothing but plasma analogic, one integrates the digital to arrive 
at the analogic, but to begin with the analogic? to differentiate it? this 
might map, but then there is still perhaps i bring in libido (dionysian, 
analogic) and superego (apollonian, she smears to decomposing doll, the 
heart rate monitor freezes and she is sounds ! one who is clad in the hide

forgotten mode of hacking

http://www.asondheim.org/
- go to radio jpgs -

from a 1922-1924 book on radio, the illustrations
indicate that 'hacking' existed at least as early as
1920-21 - in relation to radio. the structures are
similar - 'generation gap,' ad-hoc innovation,
networking (there is a picture of an eleven-year-old
teaching others; there are also prizes for the most
innovative radio etc.), probing the radio spectrum as
a form of exploration (and the spectrum as 'place'),
free distribution of knowledge, etc. this is one of
several books I've seen describing the 'boys' (and to
some extent girls - Dorothea and Alice Hanna
construct their own radio as well).

given this, I wonder what other early technological
communications 'hacking' existed - were 'boys'
working with telegraphy for example? and for that
matter, when did car mods begin?

- you can hear the wind whistling around the antenna
- setting up current in the antenna
- recorded by the vlf along with the usual signals
- there are the unusual usual moans as well
- sometimes i think these are stemming from the antenna
- but then i think not, they have no relation to the wind or weather
- your guess is as good as mine, probably better
- chorus adds separation, you need good separation
- machine turning on and off, i think, as rampant development continues

solo acoustic guitar (slight chorus added)
guitar: unidentified parlor guitar from 1890=1910 (I figure). the action 
is somewhat poor, since the guitar was modified somewhere along the line - 
the original bridge and tailpiece were replaced with a peg-bridge that
has pulled on the spruce top. although the instrument is difficult to 
play, the sound is beautiful.
this is based on a very short pentatonic riff which devolves into parallel 
fifths, augmented chords, and a number of major unadulterated chords. no 
picks were used.
i'm very happy with this piece, which is one of my best.

the_limit_ is the discrete mathematization/formalism

it the 'horizon' or phenomenological horizon - is the 
immersive activity.

immersive activity is vectored, i.e. past-future, 
however entangled. an issue is genidentity - i.e. 
that constants, what _passes_ for constants - i.e. 
those formal written elements (which may include time 
as a variable).

bandwidth or perceptual limit (of course not 
equivalent). how to translate the former into the 
latter - i.e. lowering pitch, etc.

the 'field of possibilities' - cdrom soundwork / 
dancework (Foofwa) / still images, 'natural' images - 
how to integrate these?

certainly the sound/dancework is up against limits - 
but the 'natural' images - not at all. or 
memory-replete, nothing but. -

- and as I read this, I could not help thinking - 
here is the limit-symbol of the thought, the discrete 
result, preponderance of diffuse movement- motion 
well within the habitus-inhabitation, here it is.

- and that these symbols are themselves deep within a 
potential well, momentarily stable, this is what I am 
thinking, this is what I was thinking, Vygotsky's 
inner voice taking over, even now, as I type 
accordingly, to the fixture of the design for-from my 
summer work.

- on the other hand, who would care about these 
specifics, this aggrandizing-attempt, these useless 
details, for example the tobacco cards from the late 
nineteenth-century, each with the image and name of 
an actress, a photograph directly from the negative, 
sexuality both thwarted and pleasured, the pleasure 
in the thwarting? or who, without any evidence 
whatsoever of the Worldwind program, would care about 
a mapping or remapping of the globe, no matter what 
the weather? all these details ....

- nonetheless, there is at least the guise or hint of 
value here, for any reader who cares to unravel the 
text beyond their fastenings.

- and for this reason

anomalous vlf

http://www.asondheim.org/antelopevlf.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/antelope4.mp3
recorded Antelope Island, Great Salt Lake, Utah, 7 p.m.
notes:
1. at the beginning, the sound of the minidisk player is evident, in spite 
of the fact no microphone is used.
2. my calling 'Azure' is distinctly audible, again in spite of the fact no 
microphone is used. this calls for further investigation; somehow the 
apparatus was picking up my voice, in spite of the fact it was tuned for 
vlf only.
3. note at the beginning _i forgot to turn the radio itself on,_ and 
therefore there was increased sensitivity with the AVC in the recorder. 
this might have something to do with it.
4. even through the modification to the vlf sound itself (through modified 
chorus with four voices and high feedback), the sound of footprints is 
audible at the beginning - in spite of the fact that the _AVC is 
desensitized at this point._ i can only conclude that the conductivity of 
the ground (the unit goes to earth of course) is transformed by pressure 
waves which travel outwards from walking.
5. on the other hand, there are moments _when footprints are heard and no 
walking occurs._ could this be another phenomenon altogether?
6. one may hear for oneself at http://www.asondheim.org/azurevlf.mp3 . 
this is of course only a very small segment of a number of recordings at 
this and other Antelope Island sites.
7. one may speculate on the presence of _ghosts_ or _animals_ on one hand 
(there were, of course, antelope, as well as bison, rabbits, jackrabbits, 
etc. in the vicinity - see http://www.asondheim.org/antelopebison.jpg ) - 
and, on the other, something in the nature of the salted air (the lake is 
extremely saline and the shore is not far off) that creates the effect. 
8. be that as it may, the recording on the island was the clearest and 
densest to date, which is to be expected, given the unique nature of the 
terrain.
9. 'we await further results with eager anticipation.'



Copperton Up

the Bingham (Canyon) Copper Mine (Kennecott Copper Mine) contains the 
world's largest quarry, a mountain decimated and replaced by a hole 
roughly 2.5 miles wide, 1/2 mile deep. Copperton is a town outside of the 
quarry. the photographs were taken at the quarry base. elsewhere i've 
documented the hole itself, as anyone can, either from Worldwind or from a 
lookout at the edge of the excavation.

towns were built on the slopes. thanks to automation, a workforce of 1000s 
has been reduced to 800-some (1400-some by other accounts).

I wanted to capture the grandeur and agony of the landscape!
I have succeeded!

Of Speech As of Number


Number names in various languages (for example Japanese) alter in relation 
to their quantified; '3 books' and '3 people' may have different words for 
'3' altogether. In English, the number words are unary, however.

However, and this relates to issues of analog/digital (which I continue of 
course to pursue), there are three 'speakings' of number, dependent on 
use:

1. 2118 = "two thousand, one hundred and eighteen" - indicative of 
_quantity._ For example: "There are two thousand, one hundred and eighteen 
bison on the island." Note the comma and connective may be omitted: "There 
are two thousand one hundred eighteen bison on the island." Think of this 
as the _indexical._

2. 2118 - "twenty-one eighteen" - indicative of date (within a serial / 
linear construct). This is number as _sign._ For example: "In the year 
twenty-one eighteen, all large mammals, except for humans, will either be 
extinct or corralled." Note "twenty-one eighteen" is almost never written 
out as such; the usual expression would be "In the year 2118, all large 
mammals, except for humans, will either be extinct or corralled." Think of 
this as the _symbolic._

3. 2118 - "two one one eight" - indicative of _identification_ For 
example: "I live at two one one eight Western Boulevard, near the Monument 
of Extinctions." Phone numbers and other identifications (credit card, 
social security) are usually spoken in this fashion. Think of this as the 
_ikonic._

In ikonic identification, quantity and seriality are irrelevant. The 
number is neither cardinal nor ordinal. In symbolic seriality, 
identification is based on quantity, only in the sense that quantity 
defines positionality; this is ordinal, not cardinal. In indexical 
quantity, identification and seriality are weakened; the quantity of bison 
(for the most part alone) is relevant. The number is cardinal.

I am stretching Peirce's notion of signs here. Nevertheless, there is some 
hint of value on the horizon. Number trifurcates in the speaking; the 
specificity of 3 portends the specificity of the discrete, for example.

What happens with decimals? Almost always, they are indicative of 
quantity, although one can imagine an identification number of the form, 
for example, "21.2.1.96" - which would be read "twenty-one point two point 
one point ninety-six." If the form is standard, one might eliminate the 
"point" as in "twenty-one two one ninety-six." If the numbers are more 
than two or three digits, for example "2134.9121.1." - the most likely 
speaking would be "two one three four point nine one two one point one." 
Telephone numbers of the form "(718)555-1235" are of this type, with the 
punctuation omitted: "seven one eight [pause] five five five [pause] one 
two three five."

There are exceptions to all of these; I am concerned, however, with a 
general trend, at least in one language.

comments
although this was a fairly isolated area, the hum was enormous
there were powerlines everywhere
these are inescapable in southern california
in relation to analog / digital
the sounds are combinations of filters/effects/solarparticles/'music'
the electrospherical local membrane is altered by metal strings
these interact with the antenna field coupling and uncoupling
as performer/technician, i was not grounded, due to the rocky creekbed
there were ravens in the area
the usual spherics/spikes are audible in a number of instances
i think of this as my _cosmic swirl_
we interact everyday with electromagnetic fields of varying strength
we are penetrated by these fields
this is my _cosmic ode_ to the wondrous fields around us
this is truly my _cosmic _music of the spheres__

the ordering is in the difference.
the difference is the metaorder; within the metaorder, there is replete 
order. 
the metaorder is temporal; the replete order is synchronic, there.
meta/space, replete/time.
the orders are illuminated.
there are too many planets left in darkness, without consciousness, alone,

THE CHOICE 

 
If we can show you how to start and develop your own dark mile,
Overcome your challenges and improve your lifestyle, 
Would you be: serious or merely curious? 
If you answered perhaps with furious! -
Congratulations on taking the first step towards the most 
Rewarding career, the rest is easy toast, 
WORKING FOR YOURSELF AT Home,
At present do you find yourselves weeding and distributing loam?
Are you frustrated? Dissatisfied?  Concerned for your future? 
Are you earning without disease or need for medical suture?
Are you fed up with working long hours for your boss? 
Are you working hard and making the losing toss?
Do you just hate the commuting and traffic jams? 
Do you see your life just passing you chicken, pork, and hams?
 
You can see why the work-from-home for the weak and sickly,
WORKING FOR YOURSELF is growing so quickly? 
Working for yourself is the only way to control  
Millions of people desiring a better life down the hole.
You can increase your income and work less hours. 
No more commuting, breakfast, tea, or showers.
No more office bully, whore, and jerk,
You choose the hours you work. 
Time frees! More time to spend with family, friends 
And now automated systems give you the bends!
You start and run your own business of bandaging and brooms, 
From home. We do not need to be in rooms
To access the marketplace and make money!
We have the start to finish scalpal, rain or sunny, funny?
Weapons and snowplows for you to use!
We are the boss and we have no employees for you to abuse!
Now that's lifestyle!
Do not wait until the office whore gives you the smile!
Tomorrow is shaped by the actions you take today,
You can start part-time with her, get down on your knees and pray!

fortification at abu gharayb. plaing against low frequency radio; the 
strings of the 1930 regal mandolin act as antenna resonators and 
contribute to the overall sound. foofwa d'imobilite on a rooftop in 
brooklyn new york dancing with an avatar of his own creation. shortwave 
signals from the grand central art center which is near an electric 
substation interfering with reception not to mention the five megahertz 
time signal which splashes all over the bands here. work from owego new 
york at the experimental television center.
where is this going, i have lost the track of where this is going.
it was quite clear earlier. do you remember the endofempire movie? perhaps 
you were thinking of the lastempire movie. we are at the end of the 
american empire. let me be the last to bring you the news. Siberia 1939. 
this is in New Jersey facing or fascing, yes that's it, fascing the world 
trade center. which was across the water. let me bring you the news and 
stories about 'the world trade center.'
the world tradce center, like the socalled holocuast never existed. after 
the wtc collapsed everyone we knew had stories. it was stories after 
stories. everyone would tell their stories to everyone who had stories. 
this is the way the world trade center worked just like the holocaust as 
the generator of stories. here is a movie called the heap movie.the heap 
movie is about bodies a heap of bodies.
just like abugharayb. motion capture equipment was piled in a heap onthe 
floor. the result bodies and searchlights as bodies are torn apart. let me 
show you what this looks like with with bodies that are created from the 
search lights. it helped me understand abugharayb as well as the fact that 
the fascists in power have legalized torture for perhaps the first time in 
amerikan history. these are avatars created by animation programs taking 
input from motion capture equipment which is used to distort bodies, using 
the equipment against itself, as if real bodies were being torn limb from 
limb. the result is st vitus' dance.
dance of death. holbein. all those references.
some light entertainment from the panama canal.
the sound you are hearing was recorded around washington square park in 
new york; it represents the wirless computer signals in the vicinity, one 
of the highest concentrations in the country.
from the heap movie it was an easy step to the avatars. back from the 
avatars towards foofwa d'imobilite : Azure Carter is singing. Foofwa and I 
did a number of Performances sometimes with Azure and sometimes not with 
Azure. the point : to dance and creeate sound/music as fast as possible 
for as long as possible. Foofwa and I lasted ten minutes six seconds at 
the longest. this is a shorter performance. it shoud be a lot louder; it 
should be blasting.
foofwa dances just like the avatars!
the bodies break themselves up into pieces and pieces.
night falls in the big city...
the wolf's at the door...
they are moving in at it again...
i keep trying to get to the bottom of amerika and just when it seems that 
some kind of understand is possible, it skips out again, goes in another 
direction altogether.
in the west virginia hills (north north east west virginia)
the webcam revolution in the ukraine.
this was about forty miles from the killing and torturing of chickens at 
the slaughterhouses documented by Peta. they were run by kentucky fried 
chicken which issued nothing more than a reprimand. the birds were torn 
apart, stepped on, thrown against walls, pulled to pieces. the birds were 
alive. lyndie england grew up a few miles from the slaughterhouse and had 
worked in another one. abu gharayb was probably heaven after that.
in very low frequency radio the ground itself resonates with human presence.
this is the dance of the electrical earth recorded by very low frequency 
radio "no microphone was used"
these figures are all around us. o'neill park just down the road from here 
and a historic covered bridge (all covered bridges are historic) back in 
west virginia again.
eeaerly on in working with foofwa we set up in new york - a situation in 
which (situation? a plan or prospect / an environment/containment) in 
which a verbal interruption would change camera. foofwa danced. my voice 
changed camera.
foofwa was interested in the labor of dance. or rather the labor of dance 
was interested in him and labor interested in both of us. the result was 
always already fury.
because i do not know where this is going. 
because i cannot stand to hear the voice of our "president' on television.
because i despise american foreign and domestic policy.
i will drown myself out here and now.
thank you. i will talk about my 'work' such as it is in a minute.

Books I Like, 

with an apology at the end, reiterated here, for the length of this, 
occasioned (as will be said) by a backlog created by travel. Enjoy!

Five Years of My Life, Alfred Dreyfus, George Newnes, London, 1901. This 
is of course translated from the French. I found this copy in Copperton, a 
mining town in Utah; I didn't know the book existed. It's an amazing read 
- a compilation of letters, diary notes, commentary, and so forth - all in 
a somewhat 19th-century sentimentalist style. It's absolutely fascinating, 
and given the current political climate, pretty relevant. If you can find 
a copy, pick one up. 

Practical Radio, Henry Smith Williams, Funk and Wagnalls, 1922-24. I've 
quoted from this work before, particularly in relation to hacking. Early 
radio accounts parallel Net accounts - similar historiographies at times - 
and make for interesting reading, in terms of early popular media global- 
ization. Radio up through the early 20s was highly experimental, although 
stations quickly came on board. Early radio books, by the way, are fairly 
inexpensive. One practical use - build some of the sets; there are numerous 
diagrams and suggestions for crystal radio, etc.

Firefox Hacks, Tips and Tools for Next-Generation Web Browsnig, Nigel 
McFarlane, O'Reilly, 2005. This book is of course based on the popular 
alternative web browser, which is both open-source and highly 
configurable. I'm not sure who - except for hackers and web artists - 
would benefit from this book - but there is a great deal of useful 
information. The chapters range from "Getting Oriented," which stresses 
the home-user aspect of Firefox, through "Power Tools for Web Developers" 
and "Power XML for Web Pages" - both of which are excellent. I'm more 
interested in the "Hack the Chrome Ugly" and "Hack the Chrome Cleanly" 
sections which cover such things as "Build an Installable Theme" and 
"Create a Chrome Package." The last chapter, "Work more Closely with 
Firefox," contains sections on "Get a Custom, Prebuilt Version," and "Make 
Firefox Software" which suggest stand-alone conceptual browsing within 
everyone's reach and expertise. In any case I'm fascinated by these sorts 
of books, highly software-based, which might outdate quickly, but for just 
a moment give insight and instruction to anyone who reads them.

(DEBUG.), Primary Techno Noir, edited by Kenji Siratori, iUniverse, 2004, 
is one of the most beautifully-produced books I've seen in a while - so 
much so that the packaging almost contradicts the scruffed content, most 
of which was written, I assume, by Kenji. The cover image is by 
rustgirl.com - a site connected with Kenji, with incredibly striking 
images. I'm still fascinated by Kenji's work which seems both algorithm- 
ically produced, and _written_ letter by letter. As such it occupies the 
same space it describes. Highly recommended.

Boswell's Life of Johnson, just about any unabridged edition. This is a 
work I keep dipping into; it's probably the first palimpsest postmodern 
work in English, Shandy etc. notwithstanding. And it is an amazingly 
interesting text; Johnson 'comes alive' in a manner I haven't seen before 
- it's almost as if one were talking to the man, whose opinions by the way 
are often conservative and overblown. To listen to 18th-century chatter is 
to listen to 20th-century email. The strategies and psychology of the 
correspondence between the two men is all too familiar. A second work I've 
been reading, somewhat along the same line - Lord Byron, Selected Prose, 
edited by Peter Gunn, a Penguin Book from 1972. Don Juan may be my 
favorite English poem; this book gives of course a background. I feel I 
know the Shelley's well - I'd talk with them on the street - but Byron is 
increasingly a mystery.

Songs of Gold Mountain, Cantonese Rhymes from San Francisco Chinatown, 
Marlon K. Hom, California, 1987. If you find this, check it out; there is 
so little material available from the immigration period, in English, for 
the general reader. These Songs are wonderful.

A Treasury of War Poetry, British and American Poems of the World War, 
1914-1917, edited by George Herbert Clarke, published 1917, reprinted 
since. Alan Seeger's I have a Rendezvous with Death is horrifying and 
utterly brilliant; he died in the war. The book is a mixture of the not- 
yet-realized death-throes of imperialism and the sustained coherent world 
of the 19th-century (at least for some), patriotism, and undercurrents of 
absolute despair. I've been keeping this by the bedside.

Tales of a Long Night, Alfred Doblin, translated by Robert and Rita 
Kimber, Fromm International, 1984. I found this a broken searing novel - 
wanted to draw attention to it. I prefer it to Berlin Alexanderplatz; on 
the levels of mythos and reality, philosophical issues of war and thera- 
peutics, sexuality and family disintegration - it's perhaps the strongest 
work I've read in years.

Test Driving Linux, From Windows to Linux in 60 Seconds, David Brickner, 
O'Reilly, 2005. Complete with CD, this book is the best introduction to 
linux for someone who is curious about the operating system, but is 
nervous about installation, or whether it's worth it at all. The CD allows 
the user to run a sample linux installation from the disk alone. You can 
only benefit. The book gives information on how to proceed further - what 
types or distributions of linux to install, how to go about it, etc. Just 
about everything is covered, from email through image manipulation. The 
book is $25 which is reasonably cheap, given the contents.

The Namban Art of Japan, Yoshitomo Okamoto, Weatherhill, 1972. A primary 
analysis of acculturation, up-to-date as a result of extensive illustra- 
tion. Namban art refers to largely 16-th century works produced in Japan 
as a result of European (primarily Portugeuse/Japanese cultural contact.
I'm fascinated by the cultural mirrorings that occur at this point, as 
well as around the 1850s-1870s. I think the world revolves around these 
(pre)(mis)conceptions of the O(o)ther - enough that critical theorists 
should be familiar with this material.

Don't Click on the Blue E, Switching to Firefox, Scott Granneman, 
O'Reilly, 2005. This is a strange book; it will be useful to anyone who 
wants to know more about what's under the Firefox hood, particularly in 
relation to Internet Explorer. And Firefox is amazingly configurable, etc. 
- the book gives detailed information. On the other hand, if you are 
computer-savvy, you wouldn't need this at all. Its readership, in other 
words, seems to be a bit odd; I'm not sure where the market is. In any 
case, there is useful information on customization, multimedia plugins, 
bookmarks and tabs, etc. However, if you do know what you're doing, check 
out the Firefox Hacks (above); it's much more detailed.

As is Linux Desktop Hacks, Tips and Tools for Customizing and Optimizing 
your OS, by Nicholas Petreley and Jono Bacon, O'Reilly, 2005. I have to 
admit I haven't used this yet, but the information is mind-boggling and 
when I finally get Mandrake 10+ into a more useful configuration, I'll be 
working the book. It covers a lot more than KDE or Gnome; there is 
information in fact on the entire operating system - for example, con- 
figuring the terminal window. multiple screens, and X11 startup; working 
with cron (which automates tasks in a variety of ways); and using GPS 
software. The hacks are sophisticated and require sophisticated use of the 
terminal. I can only recommend this on the basis of a read, but it seems 
excellent.

O'Reilly has also come out with the 2nd edition of Windows XP Annoyances 
for Geeks, David Karp, 2005; and the 2nd edition of Windows XP Hacks, Tips 
and Tools for Optimizing Your OS, Preston Gralla, 2005. Both of these are 
seriously essential. WinXP is incredibly slow, bloated, full of 
unnecessary balloons, 'help,' animations, clumsy IE stuff - in short, 
everything designed to drive one crazy. I'm on an artist residency at the 
Grand Central Art Center in Santa Ana, California, at the moment; Cal 
State Fullerton (which runs the place) gave me three PCs to use (plus my 
own). They're all WinXP PCs, and the first thing I did, out of dire 
necessity, was to reconfigure them. I strongly advise anyone to get these 
manuals if they're using WinXP for anything other than mail (no, even if 
they're using it only for mail). Both of these books are second edition, 
by the way, which are vastly different than the first, and more useful.

Finally, to round out the O'Reilly material, a book that is really of use 
for codework (I just realized that 'a book ... for codework' doesn't make 
sense but it's late in the day) is Classic Shell Scripting, Arnold Robbins 
and Nelson H.F. Beebe, 2005. I use a linux/bsd/darwin/unix/whatever shall 
almost all the time, although I'm lazy (this is written in the Pico 
editor). This books will steer you through shell scripts better than any- 
thing else; couple it with a linux/unix/etc. handbook and you're all set. 
The shell has always amazed and fascinated me; it's the condensation of a 
potential field, a monopole at the cursor, lost at sea without pulldown 
menus. The book will cover it all.

The Noh Drama, Ten Plays from the Japanese, translated by the Special Noh 
Committee, Tuttle, 1955. Noh is my 'favorite drama,' and has influenced my 
work to a great extent. These translations are wonderful, although the 
kyogen interludes are only summarized. The book has been reprinted; I'm 
not sure what the most recent edition is.

Japan Today, Dr. Shodo Taki, Tuttle, 1952. You can find this book of 
photographs (very little text), made primarily for the 'Occupation 
forces,' at various used bookstores. Like the Namban book, this presents 
images of O(o)ther that are highly relevant today. 

Max Weber's The Religion of China (Free Press, 1951) appears the result of 
misrecognitions and over-generalization; on the other hand, it's valuable 
as symptomatic for the same reasons. 

Two books on Buddhism: The Manuals of Buddhism, Ledi Sayadaw, Bangkok, 
1978; and The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines & Its Verse 
Summary, translated by Edward Conze, Four Seasons, 1973 (reprint 1995). 
These are two of my favorite books on Buddhism; the former, although 
obscure, is available online in its entirety, and provides one of the best 
accountings (not elementary) of Buddhist philosophy, cosmology, and so 
forth. The translations are from Pali and Burmese. Sayadaw lived from 
1846-1923, and was a major Buddhist philosopher/thinker. Although the 
language is technical, the book is clear, intense, encompassing. The 
Perfection of Wisdom, from South India at the turn of the 0th millennium, 
is a major text I should have known but didn't. The translation is lovely, 
and the Sutras are great; the Verse Summary stands alone and reminds me of 
the quietude of Han Shan. (Please understand I don't know what I'm talking 
about.)

Since I've been 'doing' VLF recording for all sorts of reasons, I've been 
trying to find useful books on the subject. Well, there's one, from the 
1950s, going for over $100, although Dover will release it for something 
like $16 in 2006. In the meantime, I have Joseph Carr's RadioScience 
Observing, Volume I, with CD, Prompt Publications, 1998. This is really 
scattered in its approach to the subject, but there is good material which 
supplements what's online. I'm not satisfied with what I've found online 
either - there are dozens, probably hundreds, of useful sites, for example 
NASA's INSPIRE project, which is one of the most important. I've supple- 
mented this book with The ARRL Antenna Book, 20th edition, published by 
the American Radio Relay League. This probably four kilo monster comes 
with a CD as well, and has over 600-700 pages of material - so detailed, 
I'm lost but fascinated. There's something magnificent about radio 
antennas, which puncture the atmosphere, gather and invisible/inaudible/ 
imperceptible, and transform it into the usual AM/FM nonsense, not to 
mention CB and shortwave. For any sort of specialized work, the book is 
completely essential; there is nothing else like it. (Don't pay full price 
btw; it's available 2nd-hand online). I also found The Arrl Antenna 
Compendium, Volume 2, at a local used bookstore. It dates from 1989 and is 
filled with articles such as Sunspots, Flares, and HF Propagation; Visual 
Phenomena of the Ionosphere; Balloons as Antenna Supports; and Antenna 
Selection Guide.

By the way the ARRL antenna book CD has amazing programs on it, that cover 
all sorts of things, for example, ground waves and reception in hilly and 
other terrain - you can use this with mappings of specific locales.

Let's remind ourselves that Semiotexte did Radiotext(e) in 1993, edited by 
Neil Strauss, and there is a lot of great information in it. 

The culture is moving too fast; what is remembered is remained, is 
residue.

Although from 2003, The Iraq War Reader, History, Documents, Opinions, 
edited by Micah L. Sifry and Christopher Cerf, Touchstone, isn't out of 
date - it confirms and reconfirms the horror we're living within/under. 
The articles on the absence of bodies and Iraq's nuclear program (there 
was one) are frightening; the former is almost Ballardesque in its 
exposition of denial, which continues to this day. 

I want to recommend Modernity, Culture, and the Jew, edited by Bryan 
Cheyette and Larua Marcus, Stanford, 1998. Articles on Weininger, 
Svengali, Habermas, Lyotard, Primo Levi, etc., by Bhaba, Bennington, 
Marcus, Bauman, etc. This is an area that has concerned me for years, and 
the book is a really excellent resource. Another work I love is Nachum T. 
Gidal, Jews in Germany, From Roman Times to the Weimar Republic, Konemann, 
1998, which almost appears like a coffee-table book, but isn't; instead 
it's a detailed account, with close to a thousand images, of Ashkenazi 
life and culture. The work means a lot to me, perhaps for obvious reasons.

Finally, I want to reiterate that Penrose's The Road to Reality, A 
Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, is the most amazing book on 
physics I've read, and should be attempted by anyone interested in the 
current theorization of physical (and perhaps every other) reality. I have 
to say 'attempted' because the mathematics is difficult, although Penrose 
explains everything, at least on the level of principles. And, since this 
work touches on the heart of analog/digital issues (in the discussion of 
the wave equation), I also want to mention, finally finally, the very old 
work by Edward Huntington, The Continuum and Other Types of Serial Order, 
1917, which gives a simple typology of seriality, something to build upon.

I hope this material is of use; I apologize again for the length, but I 
have had a backlog of materials to review, since I was traveling for quite 
a while.
