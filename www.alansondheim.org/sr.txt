I want to write an article on playing fast, on making
so many pieces. My article would speak about death, my
fear of stopping in the midst of things. There are 
times my fingers hurt, and I wonder when they'll give
out, when I'll have to stop playing altogether. So now
I work furiously, every idea is carried out, and I 
know that every attempt might be my last. No one plays
the way I do, and I'll think, I have to play faster
now, push my limits and those of others. I'll make a
new sequence of notes, consciously try to remember it,
bring it to the foreground repeatedly in the midst of
other modules, creating a tapestry that blurs on the
hearing of it. Some instruments are faster and more
fecund than others - electric saz and guitar, oud for 
examples; some, like erhu and suroz seem deeper and
sleeker; some like sarangi record my stumblings, and
some like viola and Alpine zither carry incandescent
beauty at any speed. In the midst of all this playing,
however, I hear silence; in the midst of tuning, I 
feel the descent of the curtain, and I call to myself,
in the form of a calling, faster, slower, faster, more
beautiful than I have known. Here I play off Jon's
guitar and Azure's songs, and weave and surge towards
the end; it's as if everything is an elegy, and elegy
is all I know.

Azure Carter, songs
Jon Woodson, guitar
Alan Sondheim, sarangi, viola, suroz, 
electric saz, electric guitar, erhu, oud

Please listen soon; I'm not sure how long I can keep
these up. Thanks, Alan

Azure Carter, song
Alan Sondheim, shakuhachi

I've been nervous about recording shakuhachi, but I just had my 
best one recalibrated by Monty Levenson, and it sounds amazing; 
here are three pieces. I won't be playing this at AS220; it 
takes too much preparation. The instrument was originally made
by him, I think decades ago; it then went through a hard life.
When I found it, I showed it to Perry Yung who said it showed 
the hand of Monty; I sent him images and descriptions and 
finally the shakuhachi itself. It came back to me in beautiful 
sonorous condition. Mind you, my playing is hardly traditional. 
In fact it isn't.

everything sinks into confines, fecundity, what we already
comprehend and think through has always already occurred, 
Assyria has always already an occurrence; inconceivable 
that we continue to perform, broadcast, that activity
occurs elsewhere in our presence, unpresenced, that we 
respond, that our responses are insufficient. how can I
be a Jew in such violence. how can that matter. how can
being occur.

We desperately need feedback for our AS220 gig this 
Saturday night! What works above? What doesn't?
Good grief am I on the wrong track entirely? Should
I become a painter? Help unbelievably, enormously,
stupendously, gargantuanishly, incredibly, totally,
completely, phenomally, appreciated!!!

The color of time disappears without witness. But exterior - 
this requires transmission, a receiver, political economy, some 
means of noise control. The receiver must be receptive, must 
orient itself towards the message; otherwise the message remains 
noise, death. The receiver must have space place for reception, 
a moment off the network which in the very real, idiotic inert 
real, may be what has brought her to this moment. But the 
receiver is already dissolving and a hundred-thousand new novels 
are being born, and they are not novels, nor histories, but 
software biographies perhaps. Rather than monoculture, monolith, 
let us say multlathe, uncontrolled or multiply-controlled lathes 
refashioning, refiguring, configuring, what we are reading that 
was once literature. There is great exhilaration, great promise; 
multilathing, in its bypassing any and all absolutes, is always 
in process of permanent deconstruction. Think of the school 
essay, modified, bought, sold, dated, outdated, online and 
offline, assembled, reassembled, spell-checked, recreated, 
plagiarized, written on demand, printed on demand, behind 
wikipediatry, related to class, gender, sex, race, nation, 
religion, handedness, all or none. Think of the essay reader, 
the recipient, following through with programs designed to weed 
out the copy which is always already a copy, hacking his way 
through the sememe looking for miscreants, passing results to 
and from university and institutional databases, listening 
softly to the YouTube song, exchange of draft letter on Gmail, 
or just listening to Ipod Itunes with her Ii. The whole world is 
steganographic, embedded, uninterpretable, piecemeal, 
exchanged.** To create by speech ('and the Lord said') is always 
already to embody the** To declare an environment 'real' is 
always already to enter into a** What one desires is always 
already no longer, is always already consumed.** Whatever is 
constituted is always already binary or triadic within the** 
Which is always already a matter of reading, perceiving, 
ascertaining.** With codework, meaning itself is problematized 
as a result of entanglement. In Eco, it is the code which 
reaches a destination, not the message. The decoding of the 
message may or may not be equivalent to the source. Noise is 
always already present and is considered within the channel. 
This is the T-model of the parasite described by Serres. Eco 
states "When a code apportions the elements of a conveying 
system to the elements of a conveyed system, the former becomes 
the expression of the latter, and the latter becomes the content 
of the former. A sign-function arises when an expression is 
correlated to a content, both the correlated elements being the 
functives of such a correlation." Code is a collocation or 
system (not necessarily the same) of processes; processes are 
performative; both are temporally-embedded. A mapping f(x) = y 
is not temporally-embedded; thus the mapping of the even numbers 
onto the number system may be considered an ideality which is, 
regardless of temporal processes. The structure is given 
all-at-once within the formula (and its proof); its proof is a 
carrying-out of the truth-value, or a revealing of the 
truth-value, of the structure.** Within cyberdeath cyberin
