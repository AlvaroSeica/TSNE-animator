            I have never known this myself (or by myself) what it
          is because it is so much more than any one person could
          ever know.  The part i have found to believe, and value,
          in the role of architecture is its function as a cultural
          artifact.  And in its metaphoric quality, it can build
          bridges between people (or destroy these bridges).  The
          artifact can be realized in social|economic|political
          dynamics, and Architecture can realize these in its aim.
          Architecture is a culmination of building in nature, and
          that which Hugo says (used) to be the concretizing of the
          physical realm.  Architecture has lost this quality of
          understanding its nature, i believe.  And back in the
          his-story of the West, the Split between the Mind and
          Body (of any Architect) seems to be the same as that
          between the Sciences and the Humanities today.  This
          backtrack is relevant for Architecture because these
          also resemble the split between the subjective and 
          objective observations of Nature.  This is to say that
          in Architecture, because of its subjective relation 
          to Nature, May never be able to Prove anything as being
          Emperically True (or not false) in terms of the Whole
          of Nature.  And instead, has quality of an Architecture
          that is dependent upon being "right" or "good" nature.

          What is missed in this Architecture (non-existent today)
          is the emperical objective nature of humanity as can be
          realized in Science.  This is not to pretend that an all
          Objective understanding would be any better or worse, 
          but that, in combination of both the Nature more real.

          The Quantum world is objectively true for all of us, in
          some realm of acceptance, as that it exists, and yet for
          Architecture to deal with this fact as Nature would be
          an immense leap-of-faith for the many because of such
          depth and emptiness in this same space we "see" as full.

          It is the same leap necessary, or maybe seen as exercise,
          to look at the world and firstly see human's, and second
          to see wo|men, and fe|male.  It is not easy, and it maybe
          can only happen by practiced reflection, but the same is
          true for quantum realms of perception, conceptualization,
          and meditation.  It is an act of reflection.

          The same paradox is in the question What is Architecture-
          because the defining of nature has changed, and so has 
          the development of our own nature.  What seems to occur
          is actually like that said before--  people ignore it,
          and it may in fact be reality.

          The invisible (in the sense of a split-sense of nature)
          may actually be things that really do exist, and act as
          literal agents in architecture, in its form and order,
          material and health, and are actually necessary to the
          same question..  What is Architecture (today)?


          Invisible (objective) subjects such as Communication,
          Transportation, Energy all free fall in the Architects
          lap, to be puzzled together in unison.  And yet it seems
          the meaning of this is not the same meaning we would be
          giving to a field of grass and trees and a waterfall.


          This falls short, if it is even to fall at all, because
          Architecture is limited in its ability to place It-Self
          in the present space and time.  The Architect can try..
          but the Architect is not Architecture as a whole thing.


          The Architect seems to be trapped or at least limited
          in his|her ability to realize the outside world in its
          complexity, as it exists in the today.  The gap in an
          intention to make meaningful is limited by the subjectivity
          employed by the architect (as identity being in the world).


          Architecture is limited in its ability to re-cognize the
          Objective Nature of Science (and our World Nature) until
          the objective identity of Self (Wo|Man) is truly that of
          an Objective Observer (Human) in paradox.

          To pursue objective (scientific) nature with rigor today
          as Architecture is considered a private choice or "matter."
          The architect, as person, would need to re-define their
          il|logic-al, un|reason-ing, ir|ration-al in order to exist
          in relation to the whole, and the Universal Nature of Life.
          And no one can be expected to do this alone, as Architect-
          Architecture is much more sufficient in this function.



          From Hugo's accounts, the social and political included,
          and from my own feelings, it seems that Architecture is
          more a revealing of something that is already present.
          And to realize this present is to realize something about
          what Architecture is and is not.  It is easy to define
          what it is not, but that is not necessarily that it is not,
          only that it is no longer architecture, it is the Architect.

blah-blah
uh huh

>WHAT IS EXACTLY ARCHITECTURE? Then architects can start to work it out.


          i share my vision of architecture for the whole, in terms
       of my "not being the architect" but as that this architecture
       exists, and i can see it around me, and i assume, relative to
       where i am, others can see it similarly, in this context of
       architecture.  provided a broad enough definition, such as in
       building economic|social|political bridges, and extenstion to
       realms interacting with traditional (static) building, to now
       include things such as transportation, communication, energy..


       flying intro:

          if Hugo is taken literally (be worried, you might be called
       dyslexic for allowing your self this sight, but don't worry)..

       then something along the lines of the printing press can also
       be equated with something like the computer, and if it is a
       reasonable enough parallel, it is possible to see how many
       things are swallowed up inside a new technological way..

          to consider "computer architecture" itself, or even just
       a singular computer and its structure, order and form, its
       quality and quantification, and if we are to relate this day
       of architecture with this computer architecture, it is easy
       to see "architecture- as a whole" inside the "programming"
       of Computer Aided Design (CAD), [more with Virtual Reality].

          actually, it is funny to consider the "difference" between
       architecture and engineering that someone, sometime declared
       as being dividedly different, forever more.

          The vision of architecture is extended into geometries of
       CAD, and experience is explored via VR in representations of
       architecture.  In this sense, architecture is deep inside a
       computer, and is somehow being conceived and given birth to
       the outside in a strange enough paradigm as to what is the
       vacuum world (of an architects inside world) and what is the
       real world outside.  It is only a sense, but this sense is
       given to the "nonsense" of architecture in relationship to
       the computer itself, its architecture, form and order, and
       more than manifesting this relationship, architecture today
       is an output of the computers conception of what architecture
       is.  It "can" be this.  I have heard Frank Gehry and Peter
       Eisenman and have read Phillip Johnson (skipping the SciArcs
       and Coops) to realize this same mentionable trait of Architect
       and Computer.  Rampant is the Individual and the Computer as
       expression of Self, and the eco|soc|pol, the cultural art-
       i-fact of this Design (and reason) is still the Architect.
       If the architecture were to be taken as a personal vision,
       not for the whole but for the part, this CAD Design Ethic
       may also reflect something of the ethics and values that 
       reveal themselves upon the "outside" of the world-- that is,
       once the building stands-- what is it?  Is it Architecture-
       or is it the Architect?  It can be both and neither, and it
       may reflect this condition at the same time.  It seems that
       many of these "Architect|ure-s and|or Archi.txt" are in some
       way representative of a rift between what is architecture--
       (this is in referal to CAD Tabloid Private Architectures,
       and is more a phenomena and not intended to single out any
       desinger as representing Architecture as a whole, and also-
       not to avoid the positive aspects for any designer, more to
       get to those who think they represent Architecture as whole).

       i will not be able to successfully make any point other than
       that these private architectures do represent something in the
       rift of economics|politics|society as culture, and in this it
       is that they obviously represent the few like themselves.  A
       relationship exists that supports itself in this non-logical
       irrational design ethic and value that is self-corrupting for
       the whole, and meaning-less-than what is architecture, instead-
       what is Architect?

       In evaluation, Architect might be Holy-wood, Times, might be
       "a different class of man," even.  Whoa, and think of all the
       differences between people, how many different Architect-ure-s
       there are, and how uncommon we are to each other- Individual.


       The individual is stuck inside the computer, relating to the
       outside in a vacuum environment of factors, dependent upon the
       awareness and consciousness of the question of what is--..


       The choices these great private Iconic Designers of CAD show
       is also a relationship to the outside, one for movies, t.v.-
       print press, ..  it is a sort of exhibitionism of style.


       My point is that, as Hugo deciphers, Architecture exists within
       this CAD, as a state similar to subconscious or unconscious in
       relation to how Architecture (the idea) relates to CAD, itself.


       Architecture, as a whole, cannot begin to relate to CAD, which
       is one of many computer programs, in its specificity, without
       first relating to the computer, itself.  Architecture has yet
       to encompass the computer, to place it in its space and time,
       (while lips sink their ships using words like Relativity), as
       Architecture has yet to find itself in this objective Nature
       of science as a public reality of its place.


       But if this were to happen, that the idea of Architecture began
       again to take precendence over the idea of Architect, then we
       can begin to question, in common, as humans in the world, where
       and how we, what we are doing, how we see the immensity, while
       learning more about how to see the invisible world known to few.


       That is, (in the greatest combination of sense between that of
       Lewis Mumford and Jacques Ellul), to become self-aware of our-
       Self in the world of Modernism [etc.] and face our technology.
       And that is, to become Genralists again, to broaden our vision
       and to share our visions, to come out of isolation and work in
       unison, under the aim of What is Architecture.

     i apologize, i am still attempting to make my non-linear point..


>WHAT IS EXACTLY ARCHITECTURE? Then architects can start to work it out.


          i share my vision of architecture for the whole, in terms
       of my "not being the architect" but as that this architecture
       exists, and i can see it around me, and i assume, relative to
       where i am, others can see it similarly, in this context of

       realms interacting with traditional (static) building, to now
       include things such as transportation, communication, energy..


       Well, if it can be related to Hugo once again, that is, this
       question of architecture, and also to the above generalization
       of what it _can_ be-come (to be in the present space-time)..
       then i might allow myself to continue with what is a literal
       connection for me, and of the same eco|soc|pol parameters that
       once explefied more than just the Architect's Culture, but the
       Human Culture (limited by a civilizations visionings).  The
       World Culture is t|here what is within our experience, and yet
       only public rational and reasoning will allow us to "speak" or
       "write" it, and also--  to "build" this World Culture, and as
       a World Civilization, which i believe is entirely possible, as
       the foundation is already layed, existent, only to be realized.


       Here is a literal leap (of rational, logical, reasonable sense),
       and that is-  For Architecture to be seen in relation to the
       computer [on the outside, as ob|sub-ject-ive "it"] it needs to
       be able to recognize its definiton--

                          Architecture is [this]

       in this new world, this new awareness of what is nature, while
       retaining both Sciences and the Humanities in this definition.

       That is to say-  if Architecture, as a whole, is defined as
       being [this] form, structure, order, materiality, time, light-

       that these same definitions can be applied "in the world."

       Here there seems to be a gap in the "in|outside" realities to
       the question of what is architecture, and what is architect.

       It begs an Architect to believe that One can Encompasse Nature
       with their definition of Architecture, and humbling earthquakes
       and typhoons and fires make this clear of the order of things.

       But if we were to say Architecture is this-- _____________. 
       As we seem to do, and requestion and develop over centuries of
       questioning and answering, that there exists a body of knowing
       that can be funda-mental to What is Architecture.

       Assuming this is enough to make the leap, then, with definition
       of form, content, order, [etc.], we may also look around us, in
       the world, just to take "sight" of this architecture.

       Keyword search Architecture and maybe find something about the
       Computer Architecture, the Phone Architecture, Energy and also
       Interstate Architecture.  Something of the Scale of this idea
       of what is Architecture seems to have been assimilated into
       non-traditional (and scientific and engineered senses of what
       is architecture), and yet there are no Architects, per se.


       If one were to look, with some definition of architecture, in
       one aspect of the computer, say, computer networks, the Design
       based upon these structures range from the one to the many-
       and from the local ethernet or appletalk connection to local
       area networks [Lans], wide area networks [wans], bulletin board
       computer systems [bbs's], up to regional internet nodes.

       This "computer architecture", i believe, is also architecture.

       The television, telephone, computer, radio, movies, these are
       all similarly "networked" architectural systems.  And these are
       similar to the sustaining networks of energy and transportation
       that also complement, and are inseparable from these designs.

       The Architecture of the Present, today, building for tomorrow-
       would find the time and energy, strategize, to incorporate the
       "new" architectural building tools as a way to complement this
       whole design.  And this means that the Architect would need to
       be knowledgeable on a general level as to the "Architectural"
       quality of these specific architectures.  The Architect then
       could intergrate (and "plug-in") his|her building into the 
       system in a "cultural" way, and with recognition of dependence
       and awareness of the Potential to Design with these Tools in
       making, integrating an architecture of today.

       An example would be a ranging of net-building and building, of
       representations Designed as Architecture on and offline, that
       attempt to reconcile the rift between the in|out-side World(s).


       It will take co-operation, and it seems we act in isolation.


       This is my dream, and i conclude it by saying that i think the
       major question then does revolve around the realities of the
       importance of "public" ideas, and these not to be used for a
       "private" meaning system.  That is to say that no One Private
       eco|soc|pol goal can even attempt to touch Architecture as a
       Whole today, nor can One's Archi.txt, but together we can.

             The Transformation of Man, Lewis Mumford, c.1978
             ch.8  World Culture; p.138, [Wo|Man Translation]

    " Wo|Man's principal task today is to create a new self, adequate 
      to command the forces that now operate so aimlessly and yet so
      compulsively.  This self will necessarily take as its province
      the entire world, known and unknowable, and will seek, not to
      impose a mechanical uniformity, but to bring about an organic
      unity, based upon the fullest utilisation of all the varied
      resources that both nature and his|her-story have revealed to
      modern wo|man.  Such a culture must be nourished, not only by a
      new vision of the whole, but a new vision of the self [human]
      capable of understanding and cooperating with the whole.      "

     Human Being Bernard, i do appreciate your point of retaining an
     understanding of difference-identity, and this reminder leads me
     to firstly, revise my wording in my quoted material, and second,
     to bring up the question-  which identity comes first-  that of
     being wo|man and human, or human and wo|man, in a sequential way..


>>(Human Being) writes:

>>Human Being Bernard writes:

      I also come to difference with my quote above, based upon a
      paradox that your reply reminds me of, and helps me to see..

>> For myself, "seeing beyond gender- <wo>|man-i-festations" is a worthy
>>project providing it is not achieved at the price of Self denial. 


      Yes, certainly true, and this point is almost a conflict for
      the whole idea, in the sense that the dynamics of "seeing beyond"
      may be more complex than i first imagined, and find in conflict
      in the practice of having a human identity.  My understanding of
      this situation (both that of retaining wo|man and human identity)
      is that it is very difficult to maintain a "human identity" as a
      foundational understanding (as in-  human consciousness) because
      the world "we" are born into is based on wo|man.  Thus, for every
      interaction (and an attempt to maintain a human identity), One
      must be able to "project" human consciousness as identity so as
      to be at this level of awareness.  This is a conflict, i believe,
      because in a world culture, let's say, of economic, social and
      political structures that, on both the macro|micro scale, One
      encounters a base reality, foundational, of that of wo|man.  In
      effect, what i am trying to reveal about what i have realized is
      that this human conscious|aware-ness (as identity) can only 
      happen  in reflection, as identity.  [i am speaking from my own
      experience].  If the world culture [eco|soc|pol] was founded on
      One having a Human Identity, as base, then this awareness might
      not be so difficult to achieve in real-time conscious|aware-ness.

      So, as a start to this question of retaining a wo|man identity-
      i think|feel that this identity exists as the foundation of Our
      Modern world, and a little further back this could be noticed
      to be a world in its Ma-n|le-ness.  This is to say that the past
      has been built up upon this Wo|Man Identity, into the present,
      and offers some to the theory of Human Identity in the World
      as result of its own declarations, and identity assumptions.

      And these assumptions reveal the paradox i aim at revealing,
      in both the past (pre|as-sumptions) and in my present experience
      in trying to attain a real-time human identity in the world.
      Overall, i view it as an issue of sequence-- that is--  which
      comes first (chicken or egg, human or wo|man).  Here are two
      clues..


      First, a paradigmatic assumption from the past (his-story) of
      some kind of functional process in the Identity of Man that
      *ultimately* represents all of humanity..


      In a micro|macro world of Man, He says for the whole and for
      the part, and answers the question-  what is.  What is this,
      What is that, all of these answers are in relation to Man,
      and His Kind.  Man-Kind.  Upon the Identity of Man is placed
      the questions of the World.  Man answers these questions in
      terms of His Self.  His Story.  What is more, the Identity of
      the whole is completely Man (in a vacuum, for this example).
      Man has a Father (God, not a Goddess), a Son (not Daughter).
      This kind of Man, like Him Self, in His Story, is represented
      by the broad and sweeping Man-kind (not Wo|man-kind).  In this
      appraising of the Whole of Men, and the Universe It Self (all
      what is'), is the equally oft stated Representation of All of
      Humanity.  In effect, all of Humanity _is_ Mankind.  One clue
      to this pheno-men-a is not only All (sweeping generalization)
      Books written in terms of Man being the Representer of Whole,
      but also in the Liberated Wo- (Wo|man), and Her Books, and 
      Her Story, and Her Kind, Woman-kind, which equally is to 
      attempt to equate The Whole of Humanity within Gender Identity.
         
      The paradigmatic leap-of-faith is not only a question of deriving
      humanity *from* wo|man.. as is shown in a sequential presumption-

                     man ----->  mankind ----->  humanity

                   woman -----> womankind ---->  humanity

      it is also a question of whether this can actually occur equally
      in terms of gender (with paradoxical logic: and|or)..


                   wo|man ---->  wo|man-kind ---> humanity


      [personally, this is where i find the modern experimentation
      with alchemy as a testing of this hypothesis, and yet i have
      yet to realize this as a probable "wo|man-i-festion" identity]


      To make the paradoxical question more relevent to the Whole,
      in multiplicity this sequence would need to fulfill the many-


                 wo|men ------>  wo|men-kind -----> humanity


      Now, if we were to ask our-Self (as theoretic Wo|Man)..

      What is Wo|Man?

      What is Wo|Men?

      And set the parameters for our-Self, in our similar|different
      ways of being Wo|Men, we might find biological reasons to view
      ourselves objectively, and we might find that there exists no
      one definition of ourselves beyond our biology.  The case for
      this might be in the conflict (more base than gender) and that
      is- of sexual identity.  The enigmatic hermaphrodite (fe|male)
      challenges every defining of the "difference" and "similarity"
      of the gender identity of Wo|Man, Wo|Men.  And my paradoxical
      point here is that, over the thousands of years of this way of
      Identifying OurSelf, in terms of being Man (*or* Woman), is
      only that this is a Private definition, not capable of being
      True for all, and limited in its Public Representation in the
      World.  Maybe this is too undramatic a point to make, and the
      paradox is not well enough revealed-  but that the _fact_ of
      this Man Identity (and gender "I" as a whole) is insufficient
      to represent the whole (as a Public- in the World).  Again,
      the case being that in both the Equal Rights of Woman and Race,
      in the Whole, Man does not represent all, nor is He capable.
      At this point, it is clear in the Law that Man cannot hold His
      Identity above another, based on being Man.  And this is based
      on the paradoxical question of What is Man-  and the incapacity
      of any one Man to answer for the Whole of Humanity.  In effect,
      the Man was displaced within the Public Law (US), as being a
      Private identification.  And yet this still stands as our base
      identity in education and in culture.  We still teach ourselves
      to be Men.  Women are trying to gain their lost identity back,
      as Women, in this Private World.  We exist, to this day, as
      being Wo|Men in the World, and We still presume the leap-of-
      faith (pre|as-sumption) that this will equate, in the end, to
      a Human-ness of being-in-the-world.  As a result, an "ideal"
      of equality between wo|men is non-existent based upon the
      fact of the inequality between wo|men, and different kinds.
      Private wo|man is trying to represent the human whole in the
      terms of this identity, as a Public.  There exists no Public
      in the macro-micro world system (in terms of human).  Instead
      it is an oddity (unexplained by wo|man's sciences and humanity).

      The case for this inequality (paradox) in wo|men as a whole is
      that, in this world culture-  

      a rich wo|man is not equal to a poor wo|man in the world system.

      Wo|Men can try as much as they can to make this true, but it is
      truely an impossible and enigmatic task to pursue, as we are in-
      deed truely limited, finite in Our ability as wo|man.  We are a
      part of the whole, but by ourself (wo|man) we are not the whole.
      Alchemy again, in this paradox, in trying to find an identity
      that can bridge this gap (fe|male, wo|man) and yet, it is in the
      wordings of this "man-kind" that reveal the clue-- that is--
      the ideal of a thing called "humanity."

      
      With a basis of Our identity, what we are born with and die with,
      there indeed is a potential to evolve from fe|male-wo|man-human
      as a way of consciousness, much like the derivations made in the
      assumptions of man in his story.  Yet, as a whole, we have not
      yet learned to realize the futility (offered by this same past)
      in trying to derive the inderivable.  We end with the beginning.


      The reality of this point is in my own practicing of this theory.
      The aim, passed through time and space, in this world seems to be
      this human evolution, of mind|body, of consciousness, into the 
      world.  This schizophrenic split between the theory and practice
      is infinitely revealed in His Story, and I suggest this as cause.

      An example of Man's inhumanity to Man (Wo|Man's inequality to
      Humans) is exampled many times over in the American Story. There
      are many more sad examples of this subjective Identity of the
      Whole (private wo|man) presuming a Representation of the Public
      Whole (Humanity), when in fact they exist as only a Part.

      Sir Thomas Jefferson would be a "good" example of this paradox.

      And, at this time in the Human Story (Public), i think it is safe
      to assume that the Private Wo|Man is not capable of representing
      the Whole, only the part.  Unity is to be found in our Humanity.


      So, onto the second paradox.  To find this unity, in the real--
      to approach this ideal theoretic Human, and Humanity-- much as
      the alchemists approached this living paradox of wo|man limits.

      In this world founded on man, evolved into wo|man, is it *really*
      possible, for the whole, to derive a "Humanity?"

      What is Humanity?

      For One i believe it is an Identity, the Self being-in-the-world.

      To practice this, however, One will find an unceasingly Id of one
      self living in their private Identity (cosmology) of wo|man in 
      the everyday world culture.  A paradoxical derivation needs to 
      occur (for my self, through reflection), because We do not start
      with our Humanity, instead we derive it with our ending.  To "be"
      Human, in this world, is to be Human through wo|man, as derived.
      My limits to express this fact of this World's Identity of Self
      is frustrating, that is, between the ideal and the real practice.

      The second point of sequential paradox is regarding awareness and
      consciousness.  And although I am not well acquinted with quanta 
      in relation to the quality of being both a wave and particle, i
      think|feel this paradoxical phenomena has something to offer to
      the reality existent between humanity and an identity of wo|man.

      That is, in practice, to be human in this world, one must be in
      constant effort and evolution of their consciousness, so as to
      advance through the Identity of wo|man to achieve the Human.

      It all seems good enough in theory, yet in practice the paradox
      becomes truly revealing as this human identity achievable only
      through reflection, on the whole and in the part, of wo|man.

      An example of living in the private civilization of World Wo|Men
      and waking from a deep sleep of symbolic dream, to see the sun
      bright and feel cold crisp airs passing through the void-- into
      the day (I-human, i-wo|man) go, from the inside sanctuary of my
      self, into the world culture.  I dream big dreams of equality,
      and i face myself in this world of wo|man.  To a cafe, to sit
      infront of windows of faces, all relatives in the human sense.

      I *see* wo|men.  I *see* wo|man.  I *see* race.  I *see* class.

      i think, i feel.  i find my self think|feel-ing.  I am thinking
      in terms of wo|man again, dammit.  I resolve the conflict in my
      limits to *see* human, again and again, through this reflecting
      and i try not to identify my self as wo|man, but as human. This
      unreal expectation of myself is due to pains of effort, burdens
      of survival in this World System of Wo|Man.  I must retain my
      Wo|Man sense to survive, as Identity, and yet, for me, this is
      a secondary (and, in the whole, only a partial) consciousness.

      It is an illusion to *see*, so i remember the stranger who did
      tell this to me.  How can i *see* Human, how can i think|feel
      Human if what i see is wo|man?  The subjectivity of my Self in
      this is overbearing, but i assume, as other human beings, you
      will re-cognize the conflict between the ideal and the real-
      between the theory|practice, mind|body, trying to *see* human.

      As "Our" (Private) Public is Wo|Man, it is in every niche and
      corner, in our political-economic-social World Civilization
      that this Wo|Man consciousness exists on.  It is the Reality
      of Wo|Man in which the Human exists as the Subconscious Real.
      The absurd Unreality of Wo|Men directs Humanity as a Whole.

      Without the Whole, identifying It-Self as Humanly Conscious-
      it is due to the Part (individual "i") to practice his|her
      Human Evolution in every moment awake, that is, to find this
      Identity of Self, being-in-the-world.  It is a true gift, a
      treasure of life to be conscious of this beautiful equality.
      And yet, it is beyond any One (wo|man) to achieve this Self
      in the whole, alone, in conscious real-time, in this World.
      The World would have to change, as a Whole, to support this
      Human Consciousness, to make Public this sense of being.  i
      alone, as part, cannot achieve this "reality," sustaining
      this as "consciousness," because the World is not for Humans.
      It is a world culture for wo|man, their survival and success.

      For any one to be able to sustain this as consciousness, as 
      Identity of Self in the world, they would be the equivalent
      of a "normal" person being capable of waking up firstly to
      realize the quantum world as their beginning.  This is meant
      to convey the *unreality* of *seeing* as a human being today.

      Upon waking, i do not *see* what i *see*, i *see* beyond.
      firstly.  I do not "reflect", i "project" upon waking dreams.
      This is meant to say that, if i were to achieve all that is
      human reality, in the real-time, i would be beyond my Self.
      i would probably be very lost, as to the question-  What is 
      Human; alone and by my self, individual (wo|man).  I really
      don't know what this "i" am is.


      And It Is this sequential paradoxical situation of finding
      the Human Self in the World of Wo|Man, as a placement of an
      Identity of Self, that is what is.  <pretty funny really>  

      It is in the sequence of Identity, both Macro|Micro, that i
      find my Self in question.  As to the question, which is first?
      Wo|Man (as is) deriving Humanity, and|or Humanity and Wo|Men?
      To take it ever more basic would be to question this in terms
      of Humanity and fe|male, and place this in Micro|Macro scale.

      i believe that it is theoretically possible to attain a Human
      conscious Identity in the world, iff the Macro World Identity
      can be transformed (as a Meta-system) into that of being Human.
      but today, the sequence still exists, at its base, as a derived
      Identity, through gender (firstly), I am wo|man, then Human.
      This is the paradox of sequence, and your question is revealing
      to this already existant Identity that is necessary to Humanity.

      [i believe this can change, on the world scale, only that there
      exists such brutal conflict between the private wo|man in the
      world (due to limitless inequality), that it holds back any way
      of finding "similarity" through each of our parts of humanity.]

>> Probing myself and understanding myself in all my gender possibility 
>> and definition is the singular avenue to "seeing beyond" to the other,
>> my other self as feminine complement.

      With gender identity, i am more to believe in the issues of Race,
      Class, Creed, and Religion acting as forces which define a Wo|Man
      in the World as being uniquely "different" from any One Ideal,
      and in this, realizing the finite individuality of an existence.
      In an identity (i-Wo|Man), Sarte suggests that one realizes in
      negation what one is.  "i am not that" is a way of revealing to
      the self what the self is.  This same cognition is revealed in
      the identities of "wo|men."  This is to say, Man and His Kind.
      Mankind  is not  all wo|men, nor Humanity, We Humans' know this.

      In the same way (post-paradox), if One is to have Human Identity,
      as "i" am human, then upon the same being-in-the-world, as in a
      being-in-the-world system, world culture, and looking out from
      within--  the act of negation--  i am not, becomes "I am."  

      More completely, as an issue of the dual relationships between
      gender "i" and human "i", i am and i am not.  What is isn't and
      What isn't is.  <funny stuff again>

      The conflict exprienced in the sequential "i-I" (human-wo|man)
      Identity of Self, being in the world, is what is the paradox.

      To fully realize this paradox one can enter the sexual identity
      as path to *seeing* what is real and what is not about Humanity.
      If We enter into the fe|male question, we pose Humanity in the
      relationship to the very same limits and potentials as that of
      Wo|Man, and the question may become, can sexuality (fe|male)
      fully realize Humanity as a Whole, or is it existent only as
      being a part.  It seems that Humanity can be both and neither.
      The hermaphrodite and the Alchemical question and experiment.
      Also, the wave and particle theoretical paradox again, and if
      one could identify the logical understanding, it would be that
      similar, if not solely that of the Identity of the Hermaphrodite
      in the world of Fe|Male, Wo|Men, as Human.  It would be in the
      *Logic* of the Hermaphrodite to achieve this paradoxical limit
      of being either|or, both|neither, to understand Human Being, as
      being in the Micro|Macro-cosmo World.

      the "similarity" revealed in the sexual identity of one fe|male
      being in the world is a way of approaching the Micro|Marco-scale 
      of being in the world, but is it capable of defining-

      What is Human?

      i suggest it is a part, but not the whole of this being, nor does
      it fully encompass the Issue of Human Identity in this world.  If
      "i" am to look into the world of fe|male, can i derive Humanity-
      maybe i can, i don't know, but if i am to start by *seeing* my
      self as a fe|male, in the world of wo|man, will i conclude this
      exploration with my Human Identity of being-  i don't know.  It
      is in the probable sequence, if "i am" firstly fe|male, if "i am"
      firstly "wo|man", or if "i am Human" as a basis for understanding
      and being aware and conscious of my Self Being in the world that
      i find the question of sequential paradox, and yet this "choice"
      of Identity is not to lessen the reality of these Identities--
      only to bring into question their sequence.

      This is to say, that the Order of Identity is in question-
      
      Which is the top-level Identity of the Self being in the world?

                 I am fe|male, I am wo|man, i am human.

      If these were to be assumed as classes, can we make Our Self in
      a class without limits (that is, beyond sex and gender)--

      Up to this point in His-story (His|Her-story, The Human Story)
      Humanity has been "inside" [and outside] the Class of Sex and
      Gender.  In its' defintion of What is Human-  It is both able
      to be defined and it is limited in its definition by these 
      Classifications.  To give freedom to the question what is--

      There is probable evidence that being Human is more than being
      fe|male and|or wo|man on the micro|macro-scale, in the world.
      Being Human is being Human in ways not being fe|male, wo|man.
      It is an open-ended, boundless question-- what is human?  We.
      The first graphic is the present and past, and the second is
      the future, a Public Identity of a Self beyond sex and gender.
      We do not start here, in the world of wo|man, fe|male, as this
      is not our shared reality in the sense of being- but instead-
      We exist in Our Private Self as wo|man, fe|male, in the world.
      There is no Human Public.  The Human Public exists as inside
      the Private Realities of Wo|Men in the World, to be derived.
      Humanity is not our World Cultures' foundational Reality. It
      Is, instead, as always, that consciousness of being wo|Man.
      And, in comparison to Human Reality, this limited awareness of
      wo|man, fe|male, is comparable to being asleep, unconscious.
      This is not to say that any One Self could be perfect in the
      conscious Human awareness of Self (and Other), enlightenment
      even, and encompass everything of the whole, in their part,
      all at once, consciously, i do not believe this is an act of
      will, or a reasonable expectation.  Rather, it is seemingly
      possible, as a Part, as a Part of the Human Self, with Human
      Sense, to be relative to the whole, equally in this paradox
      of being fe|male, wo|man, within the Identity of being Human.

>> The point is to remove from the abstract  security in the

>>particularity of my given nature. 

      If this indeed were to the path, from human to wo|man, fe|male,
      and to gain this particular, i think|feel it would be much more
      to the health of the part|whole, one|many, to be able to begin
      with this Human Identity as the Self Awareness in the world.

      This is not the case yester|to-day.  i do not believe there is
      any security in the Human Classification, and maybe it is derived
      more from the insecurities of life in a world of wo|man more than
      anything else.  If Humanity was the basis for Our action, in our
      being and becoming in the World, We would exist as Identifying
      ourselves in similarity with the other, instead of being solely
      in a state of difference.  Until this occurs, on the grandest of
      "human" scales, i doubt that we can exist in a similar Nature.
      We exist in 5.5 billion Private Natures today, not as One World.
      A Public Nature, with Human equality, would mean to evolve "i."

>> The point is to remove from the abstract  security in the
>> universal of an abstract class (Human being) and gain entrance to the
>>particularity of my given nature. 

      So, it is that we already (only) exist in our particularity that
      the "me" represents, and to gain entrance to the "we" who are.

>>Only from that base is the "beyond" visible
>>and understandable.

      i agree,

      cordially,

      human bc
