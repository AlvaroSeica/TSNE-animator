Author: Claw (asleep) (#5578)       Subject: Quota Review Board Overview
Last Update: Always Valid

The purpose of this post is to give everyone here at PMC a general 
overview of the Quota Review Board and some idea of the general 
guidelines by which the QRB operates.

The Quota Review Board was formed to alleviate our wizards of the 
task of answering quota requests and examining objects built by the 
requesting player to determine if more quota for that player was 
to be given.  The deegation of quota related duties to the QRB 
gives our wizard team time to attend to more pressing matters.

The current members of the Quota Review Board as of May 2, 1995 
are aluminum, Ashley, Claw, Goat, ignatz, Lumper, Midnight, and Sedate.

Presently, to request quota, go to the Library Hub off the corridor in
 the
main PMC complex.  There, you will find a stack of quota request cards
and a QRB mailbox.  Just 'take card from stack' and follow the
 instructions
presented. Put your request in the mailbox when you are finished.  Your
request will be forwarded to the QRB for voting.

@more
When constructing your request message PLEASE include the following
 info:
  1. The amount of quota requested.
  2. What the quota will be used for.
  3. A general idea of the kinds of things you have been doing with
     the quota you already have.

The request information is then transferred to a ballot for voting 
and comments by the QRB.  This ballot allows each QRB member to cast 
a vote of 'Yes' or 'No' on the request or to 'Abstain' from voting on 
the request altogether.

When a quorum is reached on a request (A quorum being 50% or more of 
all active QRB members) the voting on that request is closed and the 
votes are tallied and the request is processed in the following manner:
  A. If the number of 'Yes' votes exceeds the number of 'No' votes, 
     the request is considered approved and notification is send to 
     the wizards indicating that the request was approved.
  B. If the number of 'No' votes exceeds the number of 'Yes' votes, 
     the request is considered denied and the requester is notified
     of that fact.
  C. If, after all active members of the QRB have voted, a request
     results in a tie vote, the request is automatically considered
*** More ***  27 lines left.  Do @more [rest|flush] for more.
@more
     approved and the wizards are notified of the approval.

Guidelines for Additional Quota (Minimum Standards)

  1. It is expected that any object owned by the requester:

     A. Has a description.
     B. Has been built without malicious intent (spam devices, etc.)
     C. Conforms to the standards in 'help quota-policy'
     Note - In addition to setting descriptions, any messages related 
             to the object should be set (entrances, exits and such)
   
  2. In addition, objects owned by the requester should (ideally) be
     accessible by the general public.  More quota will be given to 
     those players whose objects are useable by the entire MOO.
     While it is realized that *some* items are for personal use,
     publically useable, or at least publically accessable objects
     are considered a plus.

  3. The QRB is expected to consider points 1 and 2 above when 
      coming to a decision about how to vote on a request.

If you have any questions about the Quota Review Board or it's

Green_Candle thinks that anyone can read a transcript of the meetings
 though..it's difficult enough to have meetings with the few who do
 show up.

 sometimes weeks with no comments or votes"
