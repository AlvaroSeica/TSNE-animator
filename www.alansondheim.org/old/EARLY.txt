Depends on what perspective.. I probably *invented* the next
generation of network software (post-Java) in the early 70s.
I had an idea to have a computer program segment itself into
parallel and sequential bits and to distribute itself across
the network (on the basis of network timings and load
statistics).. Pretty cool for the early 70s.. Who said that
client/server came later?
I was inspired by the Illiac-IV.. And it was during a
doctoral seminar-- yea I used to attend these are UCLA--
that I got the idea...
My idea was even wackier since the idea was that the
"next generation" langauge (again we are in the early 70s)
would adapt itself to the individual programmer.. A kind
of self-learning evolving computer language that focuses
on the individual... The idea was to learn programmer
intent.....
A lot of people got upset since I had substantial ARPA
resources.. I had an office at UCLA.. The problem was that
I guess I never bothered to tell anyone that I was 16 and
not, as apparently was assumed, a post-doc researcher.. I
had more resources that the head of the network measurement
center who got declined.. Shit hit the fan when one of
assistents (who I did not like) stumbled upon the extent
of my resources and the head blew the roof..
Interestingly the head of the LLL (Lawrence Lincoln Labs)
in Cambridge-- the center node chosen since Kleinrock did
his research there-- continued to support my idea.. I then
ended up as UCLA-CCBS.. And at 18 I quit computers..
The funny thing about Kleinrock was that he was giving me
tutorials on stochastic networking.. And one day his son
was there and *surprize* I knew him from school.. It was
very strange... Everyone knew that I was young, but I guess
no-one really figured that I was a high school kid.. Since
no one ever asked I .. :-)
Anyway.. About my exploits.. Many people got angry and
paranoid.. And Minsky blammed me for *everything*. UCLA
NMS talked me that they would arrest me if I got within
1000 feet for their computers.. USC too.. I guess it
was a kind of scandal.. "How does a 16 year old kid
end-up with high budget support from ARPA".. ARPA found
it embarassing and cut my budget from one day to the
next....
Before that I used to *enter* computer systems like opening
a sliding door.. Choose a machine, I was in-- and that
includes the military networks.. 
I used to also spend time at UCLA medial center.. There I
just played to research units against one another.. Each
*thought* that I worked in the other.. Yea Yea my waky
days.. I had this idea for computer supported *human*
vision, which was either thought up independently later
or ripped-off...... But that's yet another story...

The Center for the History of Electrical Engineering is jointly run by the
IEEE and Rutgers. There is a staff of 6 researchers. We do various
historical projects for the IEEE (for instance, we're currently working on
a history of signal processing) and teach history of technology courses at
Rutgers. We have a small library and an archive of materials relating to
the IEEE and its history, but we don't collect any other materials. We do
have guides to finding sources related to electrical history. You can find
these online at our web site:

http://www.ieee.org/history_center/

I don't have a xerox of the full Scenarios, just 8 pages of it (including
the table of contents).  If you want a copy of that, send me your mailing
address. I think you would have trouble getting it from BBN, as their
library is not open to the public; I had to be sponsored by an employee to
get in. You might try the Charles Babbage Institute, if you haven't
already. They did that big study on ARPA a few years ago and have a lot of
relevant materials in their archives. Their email address is:

cbi@tc.umn.edu

I'm in the middle of writing a book on the history of the ARPANET, and one
of the things I'm trying to figure out is what the network was like to use
in the early days: what could you actually do with it, who used it, how
difficult it was to use, what kind of impact it made on people's work
habits or social interactions, etc. I've been finding it surprisingly hard
to piece together this information. Everyone knows the story of how the
ARPANET got built from 1969-1972; then there's this big gap until the early
1980s, when the Internet got to be widely used. Hardly anyone seems to know
what happened in between, other than their own personal experience. If you
happen to have any stories about early ARPANET use, I'd love to hear them.

By the way, what's BEING ON LINE?
