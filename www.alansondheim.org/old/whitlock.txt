Fuck Art, Let's Kill!: Towards a Post Modern Community

Terrorism in Cyberspace.
Authorless/Subjectless text recounting the deconstructive campaigns of the
virtually important (and infamous) Post Modern Culture MOO Terrorists.
By exploiting the tensions of community, and questioning the inherent
assumptions of MOO Space, the PMC Terrorists illuminate many of the ironic
ambiguities of virtual existence.

Why live the Modern in the Post Modern?
Why do words mean things?
Where do I put my eyeballs?
What happened to Sedate?

Another story from the Virtual World. 
Welcome to POMO City!

You pack the car with your comrades and explosives and peel out to hit 
Cyber_Dweeb and any other Programmer Class pukes in the Hot_Tub!!

PMC-MOO is a virtual space designed to promote the exploration of postmodern
theory and practice, a place for intellectual meandering. Here, we mix the
unstable "realworld" of postmodernity with the solid virtuality of MOOspace.

Last Update: Tuesday, January 4 1994
==================================================================
Obnoxious behavior is uniformly and universally discouraged here.
If someone is being obnoxious, tell that person to stop. 
If someone tells you to stop, take your act somewhere else. 
If you exhaust your personal resources in dealing with either
side of this problem, use @gripe as a last resort.
Let's be clear about this: repeated nuisance behavior will cost
you your player.
==================================================================

Sedate [to everyone]: Hey could I ask a favor? I'd like to read the boards,
 could you please go to another room?
Skeeter [to Nick]: s'pose it depends on what you said...
Miles [to Slash]: where are you from
Nick says, "She made me feel like a fucking dork though"
Skeeter [to Nick]: i wouldn'a cared....
Smack laughs at Sedate.
Slash [to Miles]: I go to Virginia tech. I live in Richmond
Sedate [to Smack]: lets see if this approach works first.

The Lobby
You are in the Lobby of PMC-MOO.  It is decorated with words, which stand out
starkly against the white walls.  Up above you, through the glass ceiling, you
can see the twinkling of stars, or perhaps those are geosynchronous satellites.
To the north, a corridor leads to the conference center, office space, and the
library.  A door on the east wall is actually the fire stairs of the PMC
complex.  To your west, light pours out of the open door of the coffee shop.
Behind you, to the south, is the sliding glass door that leads outside.
You see a clock high on the wall, a map under glass on a pedestal, a news
terminal in the far corner, a poster with instructions, and
POLICY.MEETING here.
Smack, Skeeter, Violet_Guest, Nick, Slash, Miles, and Sedate are here.

Violet_Guest says, "this is Stockholm calling"
Miles [to Slash]: I go to clemson but live in lynchburg Va.
Skeeter [to Smack]: interesting description.
Slash [to Miles]: Cool
Nick says, "I have missed to many classes trying to help her with her problems,
and I think that they were all fake"
Sedate [to Violet_Guest]: That's nice but I'd like to read, and you are
causing me much spam...
-----
Spam is a large volume of text that in some way imposes on the viewer.

Slash says, "I go through Lynchburg going from home to school"
Shaugnessy digitally reconstructs here.
Smack laughs.
Miles says, "I just moved there so I am not highly impressed"
Skeeter feels sorry for Nick and comforts him. 
Smack [to Skeeter]: thanks
look Smack

Smack
IF you only knew how many times he'd
{killed,maimed,disemboweled,deconstructed}
He's a danger to himself and others.
A form of infinite digress.
Purveyor of myths both minor and fraudulent.
[This player is wearing the distinctive MOO Terrorist armband]

Slash [to Miles]: Oh. Where'd you live before
Nick says, "Thanks skeeter"
Skeeter [to Sedate]: gag everyone.
Nick says, "I have to go to class"
Slash says, "Later Nick"
Skeeter says, "bye nick"
Nick says, "Bye all"
Shaugnessy says, "Goodbye, Nick!"
Miles says, "later nick"
Violet_Guest is wondering if Sedate can read with all these people here.
Nick hugs Skeeter with a warm and loving embrace.
Sedate [to Skeeter]: what if I want to hear something you say one day?
Skeeter [to Violet_Guest]: where did you say you were from?
Nick goes home.
Violet_Guest says, "stockholm, Sweden"
Skeeter [to Sedate]: I mean @gag all then  @ungag all when you're done.
Sedate [to Skeeter]: But what If I want to hear friends?
Sedate [to Skeeter]: They will think I'm mean cuz I gagged 'em.
Slash [to Miles]: Did y'all get into the NIT basketball tournament??
An echo comes drifting back, "stockholm, Sweden"
Skeeter [to Sedate]: then just gag everyone in the room.
Skeeter holds up a spam-banner reading:

Skeeter goes home.
Shaugnessy says, "Spam!"
Slash digitizes down to glowing electrons.
Sedate [to Skeeter]: But new people keep coming in.
The glass doors open automatically as Violet_Guest leaves the complex.
Miles digitizes down to glowing electrons.
Shaugnessy goes home.
Sedate says, "Gee you guys are swell."
Sedate says, "Well, who'd a thunk it?"
A chilling draft blows in from the south, but soon ends as the automatic doors
slide shut behind Junia.
A chilling draft blows in from the south, but soon ends as the automatic doors

Junia says, "hi"

Sedate says, "I'm gonna strangle someone."
Sedate has disconnected.
Junia says, "no killing in the moo"
Violet_Guest is thinking about emotions.
Miles digitally reconstructs here.
An echo comes drifting back, "in the moo"
Miles [to Junia]: How are you doing?
The clock begins making a small whirring noise.
>> imperialist fuzzy commodity! <<
>> dominant plebe culture! <<
>> self-subverting fetal labyrinth monologue! <<
You hear a small click coming from the clock.
volcano is thinking about whether emotions really exist in MOO
Miles [to volcano]: Only if you make them...
Junia raises an eyebrow at Miles.
Skeeter teleports in.
Slash digitally reconstructs here.
Violet_Guest says, "hi skeeter"
Junia says, "every character has an owner"
Skeeter says, "take it Sedate gave up..."
Miles [to Skeeter]: whatz up?
Skeeter jumps on Junia!
Slash thrashes his head up and down while playing air guitar.
Violet_Guest says, "he gave up..."

[Smack]
He gave up indeed... Shallow figure.
Sedate was the Fool, (who are easy to abuse) and *quick* to loose his head.
He lacks good judgement. 

[Ogre]
Sedate really needs a good beating.

[Lumper]
Sedate, allow me to confess here, that I appreciate the philosophy behind many
of your actions while for others I think you've egregiously overstepped simple
rules of decorum (i.e. violated supra-MOO rules of human behavior). I full well
believe that the MOO does not give you license to "do whatever you want."
Sedate, I confess here that while I understand many of your ideas and 
ntentions, I found many of them annoying For some, I am sure that was their
raison d'etre.

[glinda] (Wizard)
P.S. Sedate has been @toaded, in all his many manifestations, for clear and
repeated violations of extant PMC-MOO policies. Sedate acted under a regime in
which responsibility for @toading resided entirely in the hands of wizards, and
wizards have thus @toaded him, if rather belatedly.    

[Guest] 
What does Post Modernism mean?

[Smack]
Yipes!

[Sedate]
Is it some sort of gospel that PoMo theorists are looking to define,
is it truth that silly PoMo(amongst others) theorists are looking for?
does truth exist?
Who cares even if it does?
Will the truth affect your life or mine?  I don't care because I can
adapt to whatever the truth decides to be at the particular moment.
So please fearless leaders...lead on and show me the truth for I am very
interested in what it is.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
Post Modernism is a hoax, it defies logical representation. It is fraught with
paradox. It cultivates a de-humanizing, anti-subject, moral relativism. It is a rhetorical paralogy.


[bookish]
The generalized agnosticism that Sedate embodies as a possible characterization
of pomo is not an escape into unbelief. it is not a move beyond, if beyond
means outside. It's a matter of more fully engaging with the complexities of
everyday life.

[Post_Modern Guest]
Hell, I think to claim Truth, even as a goal or ideal, is a just reverberation
of our modernity. What can you know? Am I a girl or a boy? Am I white or black?
Rich or poor? Where can you even begin? Show me truth in virtual space,
even your 1,2,3's are a representation of me. 

[Deconstructivist Guest]

             TRUTH

               ?
               ^
           precarious
 
[Baudrillard]
The secret of theory is, indeed, that truth doesnt exist.

[Derrida]
There is no such thing as a truth in itself. But only a sufeit of it. Even if it
should be for me, about me, truth is plural.

[Post_Modern Guest]
I think you will find that your truth claims will change. They are products of
power games and constructed as such. They serve the interests of the powerful.
They are a form of psychological terrorism.

[Baudrillard]
They threaten and provoke.

[Deconstructivist Guest]
Truth is an "effect of discourse", a linguistic convention.

[Post_Modern Guest]
But I believe in a community; religious, ethnic, empowered, virtual, we may
establish a consensus on language and values. It maybe possible in our little
communities that certain vague truths are communicated. But even these fragile
truths are lost outside of their pickle, and fail a rerepresentation in entropic
systems.

[Sedate]
What is he talking about?

[bookish]
the difficulty is understanding how postmodern thinking/living might allow us
to go beyond our current situation while not allowing us to escape our
technocultural contexts. for that, the distinction between the condition of
contemporary society - what i'm calling postmodernity - with it's inescapable
technocultural coils and webs, and way of thinking/living/understanding -
various postmodernisms - which might actually allow us to hollow out new spaces
for other, better ways of living in the interstices (or non-spaces, like
MOOspace) from which to begin to contest politically - that is, at the ballot
box, the barricade, or in our everyday lives - the dangerous foolishnesses of
contemporary culture. precisely because of a dislike for dogma - and an
acknowledgement of the imperfection of all "solutions" - postmodernists are
very slow, it seems, to insist on anything except that folks look more closely
at the ways in which their worlds are structured.

[Smack]
We have no respect for paradox.

[Nihilist Guest]
You can never _KNOW_ anything. We are all fictions of a deranged culture,
burrowed deep in our skulls and packed tightly with bullshit. We may have
figured it out, if we hadn't been so busy screaming about the pain. Now
we're just fucked. There is no truth. There is no error. No one is innocent.
Everyone is guilty! All our truths are equal in the Post Modern world.

[Post_Modern Guest]
We are a reflection of our media, our technologies and worlds. The Modern
brought us through tubes and tunnels to be here today. Let us thank it and
leave it behind. We call for a radically new and different milieu.
 
Wait! We're here! Where did all this baggage come from? We need to
reconceptualize how we experience this community, I fear we still have our eyes
firmly affixed to the rear-view mirror.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
I think Modernity, as a project of the Enlightenment, as the expression of
rationality and reason, promises to liberate us from the tyranny of ignorance
and irrationality. If we ever hope to progress, what paradigm would you suggest
we use?

[Nihilist Guest]
Progress? Progress!
Western Cowboy Capitalist mentalities have ravaged our collective soul.
Nationalism! Industrialization! Urbanization! Social Decay! Enslaving
Technologies! The Objectification of Women, of People, of ME! The Brutal
Ecological Rape of the World!
The idea of progress is at an end. The debaters are making commercial
endorsements.

[Post_Modern Guest]
Nihilist Guest has a point. Modernity is no longer a force of liberation, but
a source of subjugation.
The relativizing nature of our electronic discourse shall end Modernity.
The world is indeterminable, diverse, complex and shall resist teleology.

[Nihilist Guest]
Our Post Modern age is fragmented, broken and scattered, an era of malaise,
a creeping vagueness, social decay, may I say CHAOS? May I also say, you are
meaningless. I just thought I'ld point that out.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
I don't understand. I am not meaningless. I understand that relativism and
subjectivity are perhaps inevitable, but this does not rule out communication 
of meanings. 

[Nihilist Guest]
You assume that words mean things. They too are arbitrary constructions. I'ld
explain it to you, but I see little use in trying to be precise.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
Of course words mean things. Your arguments are cop-outs.

[Linguistic_Conventionist Guest]
Language is relative and arbitrary. The `Real' is an illusion of linguistic
habits. There are no identifiable ideal or literal forms from which the
construction of meanings are derived.

[Constructivist Guest]
Well in so far as the mind furnishes these categories of language, they have
meaning. But I would agree that there isn't any absolute reality to any
communication outside of the meanings constructed by the perceivers.

[Contextualist Guest]
Well perhaps as our reality is a result of these processes, we can say that we
comprehend within our context.

[Nihilist Guest]
What context? Where is the context? We live in the present, in fragmented bits
of inauthentic meaning, like a stream 1's and 0's. A series of perpetually
identical and arbitrary presents.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
Why don't you see progress as a natural expression of man?

[Derrida] 
For one it presupposes chronophonism, the understanding of time as 
chronological, a construction of time that is both oppressive and controlling.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
You seem confused to me.

[Derrida]
My confusion is a joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the
innocence of becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault,
without truth, and without origin which is offered to an active interpretation.

[Sedate]
I am beginning to suspect that some people here should take a quick jaunt down
to the local Psychiatrists 'R' Us and maybe let a good doctor ask some
questions.


[Post_Modern Guest]
I would like to suggest that the relevance of the Post Modern to our virtual
communities is quite clear, regardless of its import to real life. It is
obvious we must construct our meanings in this non-space, that our notions
of time and space are of little use here, and that the range of ideas and
perspectives forms a Post Modern community of CHAOS.

[Smack]
Am I on a computer, in a MOO, or in a computer, on a MOO?

[Post_Modern Guest]
As Einstein's theory of relativity notes,
Concepts of time and space are relative to the observer.
The Post Modern space extends in all directions simultaneously, it transcends
our ability to comprehend or even locate ourselves in its bosom.

[Ogre] 
Theory
------
The name of this message base is *Theory-MOO. This leads me to believe that
it is the place to discuss post modern theory as it relates to the MOO and
vice versa.

Anyone who believes we know nothing, and can communicate even less, should
practice what they preach and stop writing altogether.
As well, anyone who has not made an earnest attempt at understanding or
researching the theories being discussed has no business criticizing them.

Deliberately using vague or bombastic terms, appealing to someone's authority
without citing or explaining the reference, or couching ideas in
confusing rhetoric is bad form, and, more often than not, leads one to assume
the writer has a poor understanding of the material.
If your goal is not to raise the general level of awareness and understanding,
you are wasting everyone's time.

This is a place to discuss "theoretical aspects of MOOs in general, and of
PMC-MOO in particular." The mixing of (postmodern, anarchist, marxist, etc)
theories to discuss how a MOO operates, how it should operate (its economies,
both symbolic and otherwise, government, communities, margins, etc) is the
thread of discussion. It will be systematically broken down by people taking
personal offense to comments, people posting who thought it was a free-for-all,
or who thought it was a place to vent their opinions.
----------------------------

Smack wonders what forms a virtual community.
Sedate says, "How about the words that describe a group?"
Sedate says, "Like geese come in a gaggle."
Sedate says, "What do we come in?"
bookish says, "lots of little packets"
Smack say, "the medium is the message... make it short and sweet"
Axel says, "I would start thinking, I guess, about the question of context..."
Axel says, "Situational meaning theory requires an articulation of the standards
implicit in a context...and I don't think we share a strong enough and common
enough set of norms or even descriptions to build with yet..."
Tarquin [to Smack]: That is a good question and deserves a looking into
bookish [to Axel]: There is so damn much to be rethought
Tarquin says, "What is the community context here?"
Heinrich nods to Axel.  "For example, what norms, if any, does this MOO have in
any way?
Tarquin . o O ( does this moo want a norm? )
Smack say, " It must have some norms"
Axel says, "I thinks there are many norms implicitly at work... there is an
expectation, for example that you and I will address each other in civil terms..."
Heinrich [to Tarquin]: Does it?  I think some discussion seem to implicitly
suggest norms on this MOO.
bookish says, "and can we call it a 'norm' if we share a desire to escape the
normative..? <eek!>"
Tarquin says, "the norm seems to be one of negation and smashing..flaming etc"
Heinrich [to Axel]: But have we agreed upon "Civility" as a norm?  How do we
define civility here?
Axel says, "When people start being uncivil, I notice everybody starts chiding
and yelling until the tone returns to a bearable level."
Heinrich [to Axel]: What has been agreed upon here as uncivil?
Axel [to Heinrich]: "Agreement is secondary to expecting each other to behave.
Tarquin . o O ( behave? )
Axel [to Heinrich]: "I was only offering an example to think with...
Smack say, "Not to willfully cause others to complain"
Sedate mutters, "Others complain too easily."
Tarquin . o O ( They love to complain )
Sedate says, "Maybe complaining is a norm?"
Heinrich [to Axel]: But complaining assumes other norms in order to complain.
Sedate says, "The idea of whining to a higher power, be it God or wiz's?"
Defender [to Sedate]: If that were true, nobody would stay here..
Smack say, "Complaining is a technology, for some the only one they have"
Axel says, "...to do a proper analysis, we need to infact start with that sort
of phenomenological question and analysis."
Tarquin says, "In the beginning we are all humans sitting at our terminals"
Sedate laughs!
Sedate says, "Yes we are."
Sedate grins.
Defender [to Tarquin]: How easy is it to forget that sometimes?
Tarquin says, "We need to remember that as humans we deserve a certain amount
of respect"
Smack says, "Then that is a norm? (respect)"
Heinrich says, "But complaining pushes the question of norms backwards.
What norms does one use for the complaint?"
bookish says, "I guess i'm willing to be bugged, pestered and annoyed, if 
it's in interesting ways... i'm a bit uncomfortable with falling back on
respecting the boundaries and comforting ourselves as our norm"
Axel [to Heinrich]: "It may be that we complain, but invoke different standards
when we do.
Heinrich [to Axel]: But doesn't the content of particular complaints need to
assume other norms?
Defender nods in agreement with Heinrich.
Heinrich [to Axel]: I'm wondering what norms we expect before we complain.
As far as this particular MOO goes.
Sedate says, "Obviously some norms have been dictated to us, no spoofin'
no spamin'."
Heinrich [to Axel]: But no need to be tedious.  However, I don't think this
MOO has openly discussed expected norms.
Defender says, "I've been accused a few times of bugging, because of some of my
more eccentric creations.. bugging certainly seems to be considered a violation
of some fundamental right."

Visual_Mark says, "She sure takes her time in writing her bitch letter!"
diehappy says, "do you think the Lumper will ever talk to us again?"
Visual_Mark shrugs his shoulders.
Lazarus chomps on his snickers bar nonchalantly.

news 12
Author: Samantha  
Subject: Careful! Someone's watching!
Last Update: Wednesday, November 10 1993
===================================================================
Hello.  I wrote this as a warning to all MOOer's because of a recent
MOOing experience.  I am fairly new to the MOO, having been on only seven times
or so. I figured out the basic rules, made my room, and met many nice virtual
people.

I got to talking with one virtual person quite a bit, and made good friends
with them on the MOO. As we talked more and more, we developed a trust between
us. I began to share personal details I would not normally share with a
stranger I cannot see.  This was fine and both of us were cautious in our
relationship.

Then I found out using the @sweep command on my room that my room had bugged
and that there had been more listeners than I had thought.  If I had known that
they had really wanted to partake in the discussion, I might have invited them
to join and not given out the information I considered personal. They obviously
had no concern for my thoughts on the subject. I might even have dropped the
whole issue if i could have @ejected the spy object from my room. These were
more advanced MOOer's however, and had made the object so I could not even do
that.

After the initial shock of being secretly watched, I wasn't mad or embarrassed.
I hadn't said anything that would embarrass me, but had given out information I
would rather have kept confidential.  What I did learn from this is that there
is NO privacy on a MOO.  A locked room doesn't mean you are safe from peeping-
toms.  Don't do anything or give out any personal information that you want to
keep private on the MOO.

This includes addresses, real names, phone numbers, shows of affection towards
other MOOer's and any relevant thangs in this area.  NOTHING IS PRIVATE ON THE
MOO. Everything you say and do is potentially public.  Beware, and Forewarned!

===================================================================
Some split, others lump.  Here comes Lumper over the hump.
Lumper says, "Howdy boys...watching any porn lately?"
Lazarus says, "ahhh!"
Visual_Mark teleports Hooter magazine in.
Lumper laughs!
Visual_Mark just sprayed Lumper with L. Ron Hubbard's pancreas full of sulphuric
acid!!!!
Lumper vanishes from the room!

Some split, others lump.  Here comes Lumper over the hump.
Samantha saunters in to check wazup.
diehappy says, "so why are you mad Samantha?"
Visual_Mark chuckles under his breath.
Visual_Mark is playing with his Spam!
Lumper says, "So what else is new?"
Visual_Mark shrugs his shoulders.
Samantha [to diehappy]: I am very upset at some people here.
Lumper says, "So...now that the masquerade is over...let's sort this out...
who is who?"
Visual_Mark [to Lumper]: Huh?
Samantha [to Visual_Mark]: Do you also go by Bookish, by any chance?
diehappy says, "what? where? who?"
Visual_Mark [to Samantha]: Nope. This is my only character. Whyzat?
diehappy says, "Did you do something to poor Samantha, Visual?"
Visual_Mark shrugs his shoulders.
Samantha frowns
Lumper says, "So...what did the NEWBIE do to deserve this?  That's all I
want to know?"
Visual_Mark says, "What?!?"
Lumper says, "Don't play innocent..."
------------
Sedate says, "Ever notice that VR people are nicer that RL people."
Axel agrees with Sedate's point that people on the Moo are on the whole nicer
than in real life.
Axel thinks it may be due to the time factor of typing and of needing to
communicate tone differently...but is not sure.
honoria thinks we are nicer because we can backspace.
bookish laughs
Axel laughs
Defender grins at honoria.  Definitely!
Sedate claps in admiration for honoria.
Blackhand thinks we are nicer because of the virtual masks we wear.
bookish suspects honoria has hit on an important virtual truth
Sedate says, "But in Lord of the Flies, the mask bit made them evil'er."
Tarquin agrees with Honoria 
Axel logs it in his book on the phenominology of vr.
bookish says, "Except when we're meaner... since 'nobody can get hurt'"
Sedate says, "But how mean can we actually be?"
Defender says, "One fact which may or may not have any value is that IRL, we're
more or less stuck with several things.  On the MOO, we completely define who 
we are (or appear to be)."
Tarquin [to Sedate]: We have seen Lord of the Flies reenacted here already
Sedate says, "Nothing physical can really happen..."
Axel [to bookish]: "Yes...the issue of different consequences plays a role here.
Blackhand says, "Isn't this a sort of 'game'? Isn't that the entire intention
of the MOO? To escape reality.....?"
bookish . o O (or maybe Smack really does kill people irl ;)

[Baudrillard]
Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest
is real, when in fact all of America is no longer real, but of the order of the
hyperreal and of simularion... It is meant to be an infantile world, in order 
to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the `real' world and to
conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere.

[Surfer]
Is it possible to integrate the holistic posthuman sensibilities of
cybernetics (like the one put forth by McLuhan) with the fragmented and 
specular contours of postmodern culture/theory? I'm kind of confused about
this...why is the moo "postmodern?"...For me, the moo is more of a holistic
phenomenon...that's what makes it a unique technology - that we interact with
the technologized space...Cyberneticians would argue that the moo is like an
organism, a self-regulating system that adapts to environmental changes as they
occur within that system.  I don't want to get too deeply into cybernetic
theories, but it does make me wonder if the moo is antithetical to postmodern
aesthetics.  It seems more of a pure or virtual modernism...a hermeneutic or
cybernetic system that reproduces reality inside a technological vacuum.  We
interface with moo space according to its restrictions and possibilities (ie.
programming, emotes, and the other ways by which we communicate in here). 
In this sense, the moo is a hermetic, structuralist environment (a cybernetic
effect)...which brings me to my question...how do we reconcile this tendency
with postmodern aesthetics and theory?

[Smack] 
I think McLuhan's suggestion that the Medium is the Message, (that our
understanding the medium, as a context, MOO as environmental extension of
ourselves, is of far more important that the content of said Message) is
affirmed by Post Modern theory. Specifically, Post Modernism suggests that
regardless of the cybernetic impositions, the rules of language or structure
of the community, that our experiences here are as valid as a reality as any;
that it is a constructed environment (like any other), and we are active
participants in the construction of its meaning.
PostModernisms suggest that every experience is just as real and valid as any
other... So we are no way limited by the nature of our cybernetic system, in
terms of our Post Modern Experience. But.
What was I saying?
Oh ya.
Wait.
Oh ya, FUCK POST MODERNISM!

[Sedate_In_Exile]
If you ask me, calling this MOO PostModern is just an excuse to have a MOO
there is absolutely nothing here which distinguishes this site from any other,
they're all same bloody MOO.
Hello?...Nothing
Absolutely nothing.
Wakey wakey people.

[Heinrich]
Is our vocabulary that limp that all we can do is cry fuck in big
letters when we try to get a rise out of someone else?  How unsexy.

Still waiting for more entertainment from the Beavis & Butthead peanut gallery

[glinda]
I can think of one quick and easy way to make PMC-MOO different from the other
places Sedate graces.   If it looks like a toad, and acts like a toad....

[Ogre]
The PMC world/community is just metaphor and does not exist to any extent in
which we do not empower it to exist, through our belief or willingness to
suspend our disbelief, I think this is generally the state of any human
society. Why do we see pictures when we watch TV, and not just a bunch of 
jumbled colored dots? Partly because we see what we are familiar with. We are
constantly interpreting and classifying our experiences in order to 
`understand' them. 

Our whole society is based on metaphor and symbolism: human reality is a pure
fiction. So this community is no less real because it is based on all these
same assumptions. In fact, the more we examine the two (real and virtual
society), the more we find them the same. The thing that makes the virtual
world so exciting and inviting is its immediacy; the way we can throw off the
physical bonds that make the real world so sluggish and unwieldy. We have a
real chance to create a utopian model here, if we can only let go of our 
appeals to false authority and the power hierarchy.

[Foucault]
We are subjected to the reproduction of truth through power, and we cannot
exercise power except through the production of truth.

%%  TERRORIST CLASS PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS  %%
Welcome to the Terrorist Player Class. Wear it proudly.
You are part of an elite cadre now, with special powers
and a duty to squash the bourgeois Programmer Class once
and for all! We must keep them off balance by striking
often. We must disseminate fear and confusion. To this 
end, you have been given the following verbs:
--
steal <anything> from <player>
   Do not be shy, steal from the PC as they have stolen from us!
   You have a 1 in 10 chance of tipping them off.
   Some objects may be well guarded and therefore not possible to steal.
ditch [player]
   Drop all your inventory or plant it on another player.
   This is good if you are caught stealing and have to get
   rid of the evidence, or if someone has planted objects on you!
echo <anything>
   Display any text to the room. Describe a mood, action, or throw you
   voice.
radio <any message> (or # )
   Send a message to all Terrorists with your TerrorCom(tm)!
   Notify Terrorists you are on the MOO, with `#' on its own.
salute (or sal)
   Automatically salute your fellow comrades in the room.
slogan! (or slo)
   Toe the party line with a host of Pro-Terrorist, Anti-Bourgeois
   Programmer Class slogans. The greatest enemy of The People is the
  complacency of the Programmer Class!

kill [player]
  Terrorists are trained in the lethal use of various weapons.
bomb <player>
  Get the comrades together for a drive-by bombing! Use this 
  feature sparingly, as it will bomb the entire location the
  target is in. The bombs act indiscriminately, whereas before
  they only killed programmers. No one is safe. We have upped the
  ante, so to speak, toward the end of the MOO.

--Comrade Sabat(Flipper) has given the Terrorists exclusive use of
  his SuperPets(which eat people). Thank you brother!
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!

[Ogre] 
We began by speculating on the nature of the new MOO, how it would be
organized, and whether the recent rash of `spying' and limited `intrusions',
as well as the dissatisfaction of a lot of veteran PMC-MOOers with the recent
`quality' of conversation, would provoke a stricter code of conduct. People
were unhappy. They complained that new users were more interested in playing
around and making things than talking about Post Modern Culture. (I thought
this was a shallow take on the situation, because we were *living* PoMo, and
more often than not it was a chance to explore it more deeply than exchanging
notes with other people verbally. I've always objected to the paper-trail of
academe. (Experience fortifies theory.)

I programmed the MOO Terrorist Player Class, I take complete responsibility
for it. (though many of the ideas we came up with were shared) 

[Post_Modern Guest]
Note that nothing as ever being original in the sense of being the exclusive
work of a particular author; everything is a copy, a simulacrum. An effect of
our intertexuality.

[Derrida]
The reading of a text has nothing to do with the author as a real person.
What an author writes is generally not what s/he mean anyway.

[Deconstructionist Guest]
Authorship constitutes an ideological status, a privileged interpretation.

[Ogre]
We were experimenting with factioning the community, developing semi-tangible
classes which mimicked history or real life.
The result was a surprising parallel to it.

Our first concern was that the Terrorists not use up the system resources,
and that we keep things simple. The second was that we should not attack new
users, visitors, or anyone who did not have Programmer status. After all, this
wouldn't be fair to the user in the real world. Someone learning the system
should be allowed to do so unmolested. So we targeted the Programmers. Here,
we thought, was a group of people with enough experience and the wherewithal
to handle themselves and the situation. The Programmers would have the knowledge
to `deal' with Terrorists and appreciate them. Everyone else was a
brother/sister, a comrade. The lowly Player and Builder Classes would be
`avenged' by us. The Programmers, second only to the wizards in the power
hierarchy (and this is still a tangible hierarchy), naturally fit the role of
the upwardly mobile bourgeoisie, and thus the Revolution was born! It was 
fitting that the Terrorists were reared from both Programmer and non-
programming stock. Almost too real.

To protect the system and the end users, we agreed that `spamming' (flooding
someone's terminal with text) would not be allowed. Nor would any attack on
newbies (new users) or non-programmers. To ensure this, it was coded into all
our verbs. Our bombs quite simply did not work on anyone who did not have the
Programmer Class parent. During a bombing attack, the most that might happen to
any non-programmer in the target area was that they would `hear' and `see' a
long black sedan race in and lob a molotov cocktail in their midst. They would
then be told that they were not the target, and the Terrorists meant them no
harm. If, however, you *were* a Programmer, you would be `injured' in the raid,
and the bomb would attempt to move you to room #310 as eMOOgency services tried
to cart you off to the hospital to recover.

But this wasn't all the Terrorists had to offer.
We had a brief sense of community too. When you logged on, you could type
`@twho' and get a list of all the Terrorists logged on at the time with you.
Upon entering a room you could `salute' all the other Terrorists. You could
shout (not a MOO-wide shout mind you, just a simple emote to your location)
`slogans', which were invariably some nonsense like The Programmer Class has
grown rich off the backs of the Builder Class for too long!

The Terrorists also had radios with which they could contact each other,
regardless of location. They could `steal' other people's possessions, but
always ran the risk (10%) of being caught. When this happened, the player was
told they had been clumsy and their victim was told they had been bumped
suspiciously by the assailant. Lastly, Terrorists couldn't attack Terrorists.
It was impossible. If the verb you called tried to move another Terrorist it
was instantly rerouted. All these features made me think people would enjoy
the idea of the Terrorist Class; its spontaneity, sense of community, and
ultimate harmlessness. 

In our heyday, the Terrorists had 77 members. That's 77 individuals who thought
the idea was fun and interesting, compared to the 3 or 4 complainers who 
*hated* `us'. And I mean HATED. These people were so bursting with bile and
aggressive hatred that they wouldn't listen for one second to my explanation of
what was going on, or how they might avoid any problems (and even gain a few
features) by joining up. You can imagine my relief when I found out they didn't
really hate me or my intrepid comrades at all, but were confusing the Terrorist
name with the activities of one or two other people who had formed a rival
group called the PoMo Subversives.

*aside*
In a moment of poor judgement, Ogre had informed Sedate of his plans to
launch an experimental player class (Terrorists). Ogre then planted 
the thought in Sedate's mind, that he should do the same. In this manner,
Ogre hoped to add another catalytic disruption to the apocalypse. He over
estimated the Sedate's zeal. Sedate (as well as others) is known to have
spammed players with 10,000's of lines.

[Ogre]
The immediacy of the virtual environment and the lack of emotional and other
textual references allowed a small group argument to escalate to a war
literally over night. And even now, with all the hype and lies and rumors and
rhetoric, I have to come to the same conclusion: nothing really went wrong.
The MOO did not fall apart, or drastically degenerate. The Terrorists were
erroneously held responsible for a personal war between a handful of people.
This scapegoating actually resulted in the @recycling of the Terrorist Class.

[glinda]
Please Note:  Beginning January 27th and continuing through February, anything
you say on PMC-MOO may be presented, without attribution, as poetry. 

It is designed initially in conjunction with an upcoming issue of the _Chicago
Review_ on "Poetry and Mass Culture."  It is not at all assumed but it is hoped
that some of the work generated here can find its way into that forthcoming 
issue.  To which:

Project one: You're in it. As indicated in the login.welcome_msg, between
January 27 and February 28 all utterances in PMC-MOO are subject to blatant
and indiscriminate quotation, unattributed, as poetry. (pages and whispers are
not subject to quotation, unless you page or whisper to me.) 

[Sedate]
I *really* don't like the idea of having my conversations recorded. Now I know
the arguments: You don't have to come here, its just for a poetic purpose, none
of this is real so you really shouldn't mind. If I want someone to hear a
conversation of mine I will invite them, if not then I don't think they should
spy. Yes I know, its not my MOO and I should just go along with what's being done,
and be a good little MOO'er. But if the wizards haven't read Machiavelli's
Prince, then I think it would be good for them, but then again I'm just a stupid
prole, what do I know.

[Smack]
Fuck Poetry.

[Nomad]
I'm doing research for a prof who works on issues of privacy surrounding new
technologies.  Most of his work focuses on databases containing personal info
and similar things like that.  It doesn't interest me too much (got a student
card?  You can be found), but the issue of privacy surrounding the idea of
recording everything I say (regardless of whether or not it's being used) is
rather bothersome to me.  Perhaps, now that I think about it, what bothers me
the most is that nobody is going to care to ask me or anybody else if what we
say can be used.  A tedious task that would be.
Another thing that would bother me - and I'd like to know if I wasn't alone on
this - is the idea that I might say something that means quite a bit to me, and
if it gets ripped out of context, I'd be rather annoyed. But, you say, death of
the author!  Fuck that.  
And to the person who said 'Fuck Poetry,' I think I'm with you.

[glinda]
Glad to see that the poetry project is garnering so much interest. I do want to
clarify, however, that the moo is *not* being recorded. Ee-gad! Can you imagine
the tedium! The only recording device is "Funes' Ear" at present, it is located
in the Welcome Mat, but is likely to meander from there. Nothing said in
private rooms will be recorded, unless of course, you'd like to host Funes' Ear
for a day or too. 
If you are ever worried about being listened to @sweep should indicate any bugs.

[Heinrich]
To Those Who Have Fucked Poetry:
Could one of you please tell me how to engage in safe sex with a book of poetry? 
Upon the wonderfully intelligent advice of Smack & Nomad, I spent most of this
afternoon fucking/trying to fuck Wallace Stevens' _Collected Poems_.  Now I have
a book with stuck-together pages and a cock with a plenitude of papercuts. 

[Smack] 
Note that the logon message clearly states that _anything_ said is fair game.
Somebody should notify the management to change that to Fune's Ear...
which by the way, doesn't seem to work.
I also wanted to mention that I got Permission Denied on a listappend verb. 
That is hardly the first time I have been denied permission. I was wondering if
anyone could explain this to me in a Post Modern context.

It seems to indicate a power elite justified and disguised by the nature of the
language... It never says permission granted. It also seems to indicate that
those who have chosen to perm those verbs privilege their readings.

[bleary]
Yes, Smack.  This is all part of a wizardly conspiracy to keep the masses of
programmers down, under our control.  Aren't programmers much easier to deal
with when they can't listappend?

[Smack]
You seem to have read a paranoia bent to my post. I never alleged that there
was a conspiracy or even that I was being oppressed. Rather that I am being
controlled both by the invisible forces of the language as well as the
anonymous decisions of the Wizardry.
Listappend used to work. Why did it all of a sudden become a problem. Who
decided it was a problem. Was the decision based solely on an `efficiency'
question? 
So it seems I have missed the "SECURITY" implication of the listappend verb,
as well  as many other privileged verbs and functions. So much for the open and
unconstrained development of a post modern community. We are under a
dictatorship which does _NOT_ represent our interests.

[bleary]
Exactly whose interests do the wizards represent?  The Mafia?  The CIA? 
Am I a government prop set up to subjugate the net?

[Smack]
The interests of bureaucracy, efficiency, authority, hierarchy, patriarchy,
technology, commerce, social engineering and power. Wizards represent wizards,
they cannot _RE-PRESENT_ anything but themselves. They certainly can _NOT_
represent me... Are they representing anything? Have they constructed 
themselves as anything other than `administrators'. What interest do they have
in even responding to my mindless gibberish. Nobody else did. The interest is
obviously maintaining the status quo... that seems obvious. 

When wizards make anonymous decisions about what verbs will be made available
to the "populous" they are the final arbiters of fact regarding the "value" of
the free exercise of our programming bits. 

[bleary]
Yes, perhaps we should allow everyone the same access.  Everyone should be
allowed to inflate the DB, to crash the MOO, to toad other players, to 
eavesdrop at will, to spoof forever, to cause gigantic amounts of lag.
*Everyone* should have all the powers of a wiz. that way we could ensure that
the MOO wouldn't last much longer than a week.

[Smack]
Let me clarify the point about access. I wasn't talking about @toad or other
such omnipotent powers... In fact I'm not even sure what all is reserved for
the Ubermensch. Perhaps here is an issue as well. Perhaps the Wizards should
down grade to a lower access level that denies them any such powers as
`eavesdropping' at will.
Maybe we could explore these issues at greater length, but never in the
_Cave_.  The issue is Post Modern Evolution vs. Technocratic Social 
Engineering. Progress is not necessarily the greatest `END' or is that my
misreading of Post Modernism.

I maybe a Post Modern fool, but I don't see how the declared "purpose" (if
this is even an option for Post Modernism) of the exploration of post modern
theory can be achieved or even attempted in the face of such arbitrary and
logocentric "governance".
Do not legitimize this relationship... Do not submit. Cease you programming.
Demand all access to all non-administrative `procedures'.

People ... must know how to resist a diversity of representational practices
that would traverse them, claim their time, control their space and their
(virtual) bodies, impose limitations on what can be said and done, and decide
their being.

[bleary]
Perhaps you are making some sort of comment on how the need for administrators
somehow negates the perfect postmodern space of the MOO, or how the idea of
overseers corrupts the cyber-Utopia of PMC-MOO.  If you were, I apologize.
If you were not, and you infact were disparaging me and my wizardly brothers
and sisters -- boy would i be steamed.

[Smack]
Well I am not a Utopian, and I certainly applaud the Structuralist efforts of
the Wizards (after all, your reality is valid too.) But to even approach the
idea of Post Modernism with your chocolate in my peanut butter, is a 
total(itarian) pain in my virtual backside. The world's imploding!
I rebuke the Terrorism of Words.

==================================================
There *are* no changes in listappend. 
Provided you use it properly, it should *always* work.
Anyone who says otherwise is looking for a fight.
================================================== 

*Aside*
Visual_Mark, creator of the Rumor Mill (a devious device for disseminating
mis-information), had found that for some reason the crank on his mill was
broke. The traceback (error message) reported that the line which appended
the name of new users to its bank of names, (listappend) had been permission
denied. Sedate had earlier in the MOO month ported a virus from Lambda, and
spread a venereal disease through the population with some effect...(He had
manually removed the cure.) The wizard bleary had actually unwittingly helped
this plot, but quickly realized his mistake and @recycled it. Smack theorized
that perhaps bleary had temporarily permed (denied access too) listappend, to
prevent Sedate from spreading another disease. Smack noted in public 
conversations that he really had no idea whether listappend worked or not, he
only knew what Visual_Mark told him and felt that the truth of his specific
claim was irrelevant on any account.
-----------------
[Rumor Mongers]

Visual_Mark says, "Anyone with eMOOtions, or any of BigBrother's numerous 
features are bugged. Least as far as I know..."
Lazarus says, "YOU GUYS!"
Visual_Mark says, "Where's Newton when we need him...?"
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: That's crap.
Smack thinks rumors are potent tools...
Visual_Mark shrugs to Ogre.
Ogre says, "Okay, please, everyone listen up."
Lazarus says, "I dumped all but the most reliable features... including MOO-Wide
and eMOOtions... I couldn't find any bugs."
Ogre says, "Just 'cause you have a verb called `monitor everyone', doesn't mean
you can..."
Smack says, "BigBrother is just a rumor magnet."
Ogre says, "You CANNOT bug anyone with a @feature."
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: Ok. Whatever.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: So I suppose next you're going to say that the Wizards
can't watch us if they want to...
Ogre says, "Let's not get paranoid here. If you want to hold a `private'
conversation, create a new room, lock it, and talk."
Ogre says, "Wizards can watch anything they want."
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: And I suppose a locked room would stop a Wizard?
Lazarus [to Ogre]: even locked rooms aren't secure...
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: Not at all, but frankly, no ones conversations are so
great that a wiz would give a damn.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: Only us sorry programmers and builders, eh?
Lazarus [to Ogre]: Well I've seen firsthand the power that a wizard has
(by accident) and I for one will take everything with a grain of salt
henceforth.
Ogre [to Lazarus]: Like I said, the wizards can do anything, but they are
hardly on.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: Oh? You know this just because their CHARACTERS are
hardly on?
Lazarus says, "and how do we know that you aren't one in disguise Ogre?"
Smack says, "YA OGRE!?!"
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: You're gullible as hell if you think ANYONE's safe
here...
Arius says, "all this paranoia is getting to me man.  Fuck I can't take it
no more they're everywhere man  FUCK!!!"
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: I think I know a little of what I'm talking about.
Lazarus says, "and it was YOUR 'fresh dope' left in the Convo pit that was a
listening device ogre..."
Visual_Mark points at Ogre.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: Like you're completely fuckin innocent yourself!
Ogre says, "Innocent? Moi? "
Smack yells, "I am shocked... shocked!"
Visual_Mark says, "Pull this bus over to the side of the pretentiousness
turnpike. I want all the shiny people over here, and all the happy people
over there..."
Lazarus points at Ogre.
Ogre [to Lazarus]: So I can program, that's proof I know what I'm talking
about.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: So what the big beef?
Ogre to Visual_Mark]: You're the one spreading rumors, paranoia and insults.
I should be asking you that very question.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: Ask NEWTON about the fucking features! I saw his
bloody 'leaflets', though. And I've seen Sabat's 'thing'....
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: BB copied a bunch of programs from the wizards that he
thought he could use. The perms won't let him.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: And, so....?
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: I never said you didn't know anything, I said I *did*
know something.
Visual_Mark [to Ogre]: So where's the insults come in? Who sez I'm spreading
paranoia? People should KNOW the joint ain't safe. Is that your problem?
Visual_Mark says, "Is it WRONG that I warn people that the safe's been cracked?"
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: Wait, just hold on a sec.
Visual_Mark says, "I didn't make a fucking NEWS post! I just told a few
friends...."
Visual_Mark says, "So what the hell's the fucking problem????"
Visual_Mark says, "Anyone who knows SHIT, knows this place isn't tighter than
a hooker's crack..."
Ogre [to Visual_Mark]: You obviously have it all sorted out clearly. Sorry to
trouble you.
Smack says, "virtual opinions cause virtual actions... You rumor mongers!"

Comrade Smack shouts, "Death to the bourgeois Programmer Class!"

[Heinrich]
Radical terrorist, Smack?  C'mon, you wouldn't know fascism if it fucked you!

Comrade Smack shouts, "Long Live the Revolution!!! Viva! Viva!"
Smack whips out his stiletto and viciously stabs Heinrich.
Heinrich is severely wounded! E-MOOgency services cart him off to the hospital
for treatment.

[Hopelessly_Modern Guest]
It really seems to me like you suffer from a sort of rampant banality.

[Sedate]
BANALITY!!?!?!?!
PMC banal?!?!?!
Ever since the recent influx of Lagda refugee's our beloved MOO-space has been
inundated by the banal, and inane. Have you ever been in a room where all the
bloody players are kissing and hugging, and ooing and ahhing about group hugs
and just tittering away about anything and everything that exemplifies the
banal?
PS Try saying banal about 20 times and define the meaning of the word.

[Ogre] 
Sedate is quite right, I must confess. After saying `banality' 20 times, you
can't help but arrive at the most certain truth:
The word `banality' comes from the term `banana', meaning `something you buy
in bunches because you forget they don't last and wind up throwing away.'

[Goat]
Oh Sedate, do you need a hug? Why fight the system? As you do so well. 
Do not be antisocial, All this Vd, colds, misdirected pages, spoofing,and who
knows what else. Original need not be anal, get a grip. I'm sure you can do some
very good things. Maybe all you need is a hug? Who knows? Let me be the first. 
Goat hugs Sedate with a big manly hug.

*Aside*
Spoofing: intentionally attributing virtual actions to another person's
identity, (sometimes with humorous intent).
example...

>Spoof Foobar farts.

Foobar farts.
You say, "Gross!"
Foobar is turning red with embarrassment.

The illusionary and representative mechanics of virtual space allow such
subturfuge to appear as `reality' to the uninitiated.
But spoofing is the operative principle of virtual reality, the key to a
programmers ability to create the illusion of space.

The DarkWhole
I've created a new object... Try it, you'll like it.
It's just east of the Lobby, under the trapdoor.

You open the trapdoor and lower yourself into the Burnt_Out_Bunker.
It smells burnt and musty.
Piles of charred MOO and rotting code are strewn about the room.
In the center of the room sits a table.
On the table is a glass bowl.
In the bowl are tiny replicas of all PMC residents.
In the corner of the bunker, much larger than not 
A group of blacker and black DarkWhole of holes.

You lean close (but not too close) to the DarkWhole, for a listen.
@Feed DarkWhole with Guest@
You choose the simulacrum of Guest and drop it on the floor.
A large black rat runs out of a pile of burnt debris, grabs
the tiny Guest and leaps down one of the DarkWhole of holes.

                     now in the computer lab if you were here
The DarkWhole emits <Guest is so hot, the pain he loves it, he 
                     loves you
The DarkWhole emits <Violet_Guest kisses your mouth hard.  She
                     seems to be pulling you in her tongue 
                     searching your mouth
The DarkWhole emits <Guest thrusts himself in and out until we
                     climax
The DarkWhole emits <Guest says, "love"
The DarkWhole emits <Violet_Guest pulls you into her and lets out
                     a howl.  Her nails did into your back. She bit
                     your lip too.. she may even have drawn blood

A miniature Guest climbs out of the DarkWhole, runs across the floor and leaps
into the bowl of copies.
Smack grins.

[Smack]
The whole `MOO as poetry' thing got me thinking about a project of my own...
I openly deny the pretense of theory... nothing is predictable.
Rather I prefer the image here, rather than function or philosophy, MOO as Art...
I created the DarkWhole which can silently spy on any unlocked room in the moo,
all automatically. Learn the heighths and depths of MOO life, dare to go to where
you only just yesterday longed to be. The MOO is your Oyster.

Hurry, Hurry, It won't be around for long.

It appears the boat has been rocked on the eve of the apocalypse!
For all those lovers out there that don't have some form of 'talk'
command on their computer systems, I'd suggest using e-mail or some
other form of dialogue like the Inter Relay Chat to carry out those
steamy interludes. To the best of _my_ knowledge, which _is_ limited,
I know that locked rooms cannot be breached. There are ways of making
it appear so, however. If you're serious about keeping those trists
on the MOO, use whispers, pages, or private emotes to keep those nasty
messages private...

Subject:  Sedate's newting

I've newted Sedate because he has created a feature object, which although
it comes with disclaimers, has been built for the sole purpose of spoofing
other player's pages.  This is clearly unacceptable.  His object is fraught
with !r verbs, which mean that only a wizard or sedate can read them. 
Also, his verbs which make his insidious little random-page thing work are
spread far and wide across his objects, and equally !r, so that they too
are in hiding.  It's obvious that Sedate knew that what he was doing was
wrong, and I've done something about it.
What I'm asking for is this: for the other wizards here to back me up on 
following up on the @newting with a toading -- Sedate is causing too much
trouble, and this time he's gone over the line.
---- End Forwarded Message ----

*Aside*
@newt/@toading. @newt is a Wizard level command that prevents a person from
connecting to a specific player. Actually they can connect ever-so-briefly,
and then are disconnected. But, individuals can still connect to the MOO,
just not with the quota/programming abilities of the @newted player.
Sedate has been @newted. @toad is a Wizard level command that prevents a person
from connecting to the MOO from any of his/her known addresses and removes the
@toaded player from the Player List. Sedate will be @toaded.
  
[Sedate_in_Exile] 
The other day there was a fight about my random page feature object #4077.
Players were using it the way it wasn't meant to be used.
The purpose of the pager was for players to randomly page other players 
with word of greeting and encouragement. Thus elevating the level of comraderie
on PMC.
bleary teleported in and I asked him a couple of questions about
$string_utils:pronoun_sub(), I don't remember if he answered.
He left, and on went the debate on MOO-Wide.
Five minutes later...
Your player has been temporarily hosed.
Disconnected.
And that is/was that.
No warning, no wizardly rumblings, just silence.

[Sedate_In_Exile]
Day two, fourty-eight hours later.
I still have not heard from a wizard.
I still have no indication as to the duration of this.
I still have no answers.
I am still in Exile.

[Smack]
I hesitate to invoke the imperatives of rights, so perhaps I should speak in
terms of the norms of this community. The wizards seem ill informed, evidenced
by their lack of interaction, of the _daily-life_ here at PMC... Sedate is part
of our community.
Whether we are Post Modern enough for you or not, we believe he has a right to
know what you are doing to his (virtual) body.

[Sedate_In_Exile]
When I was young, friends and I would sing a song, here's a snippet:
I don't care what the white man say, Santa Claus is a black man.
I'm not to sure what it means and y'know what? I don't care either.
I just thought it was fun to sing.
I don't care what PoMo is/was, it was just fun to be here.
One used to be able to differentiate from here, and other MOO's, now I/we know
this not to be true. You (wiz's mainly) have been living in virtual postmodern
denial, manifested in the ridiculous idea of taking snippets of MOO text and
calling it poetry. This just goes to show that once you put your mind to it,
one can make anything into anyotherthing. Everyone knows that this poetry idea
is just garbage. And to try and pass this site off as "Postmodern" and for the
purposes of "postmodern discourse" is just a load of hogwash. 

[Heinrich]
All the cries against the wizs for their supposed injustices to some players
suppose certain norms. What norms should frame this MOO as a community?  What
model of rationality are you supposing? What is normative, if anything, for
this MOO and this list?. Your complaints presuppose some standard(s) of
fairness and justice. Might you define your conceptions of justice and fairness
for this list?  Is that too much to ask?

[Smack]
Why do you insist on such precision of language. We are readerly. We construct
each other. But words are important, as they are all we have. It seems that our
norms are as invisible as our context. We focus to often on the Message of our
words, to the exclusion of the effects of the unique medium that presents them.
We are desperately reliant on this limiting medium (that dissects our thoughts
and expressions). Perhaps we can trace some of our norms to our experience of
ourselves in MOO space. We are connected by our words to a communal space.
Words have replaced all sensory input. We live moment to moment, packet to
packet. 
For instance:
Your demands regarding precision of what essentially are constructed abstract
categories (norm/words).
Player complaints about the absence of clarity or even civility in the wizards
discourse, and their rejection of the interactive definitions of our community.
Player complaints about other players usurping their textual/personal space
(spoofing and spamming).
Our (dissenters) concern with retaining as many of our constructive and
communicative technologies as we can (spoofing and spamming).
It is a delicate balance of community that we must maintain if we ever hope to
elucidate these norms. It's hardly relevant what our model(s) of rationality
are when they have all been subverted by the privileged of the wizards.

[Ogre]
I think a lot of the common assumptions we make are actually built-in to the
MOO apparatus and the assumptions are perfectly justified. The elements of the
MOO are constructed for the most part to simulate a real physical community.
Ideas like `privacy' and `ownership' are constantly implied by the descriptions
and properties if not the actual programming of every object. 
 
After listening to these normative `whispers' from the machine again and again,
I don't think it is uncommon to be upset by lapses or intrusions in the MOO's
(however illusory) physical laws. These are reflected in the decrying by
players and wizards alike of spoofing, spying, spamming and system hacking.
The assumptions have already been made. 

[Flipper]
Do you find the words 'totalitarian' and 'power-hunger' coming to mind?
Somehow, it all sounds like an excuse to control us. Look at the new quota
policy -- Don't violate the PMC-MOO theme.  This MOO has a very definite
and well-defined theme; the theme is described in 'help PMC-MOO.' 
The creators of PMC-MOO would like to see that all new building holds to this
theme; for this reason, the wizards will be considering the 'themeliness' of
any building you do.

Does this ever beg a question!! So, we're to take it that the local wizardry
has an all-encompassing definition of PoMo -- never mind that even Foucault
found this beside the point and hardly doable -- and that anything we build
must fall into what are apparently strict categories? Of course, there's no
way to know for sure, since Help PMC-MOO, where we are to read the statement
of theme, does not work. But it's principle I'm speaking of here: sure, there
are limits because of machine space and other considerations, but since
post-modernism is all about pushing limits and questioning assumptions, why
the hell do we have such arbitrary walls suddenly slapped around us?

And please do not argue that it is because of some war of the apocalypse, as if
anyone was actually injured, even virtually, by a misunderstood, short-term
simulation. This wasn't a reason to impose regulations -- it was clearly an
excuse.

[Surfer]
The moo, because it's more about creating and reifying an architecture that
surrounds and informs its spatial limitations and possibilities, necessarily
involves a cultural and political  agenda. As Foucault has taught us, space is
incumbent with power and vice versa.  Every  space needs to be colonized - to be
imbued with meaning - in short, to become  a social environment. Historically we
have seen many different models of  power and their effects on cultural, social,
and political spaces: from  despotisms to pure socialisms. The question is, what
do we do with the moo thing. I personally would like to get away from this
notion that the moo is in place to simulate real life. That would totally
demolish the alternative possibilities of this space. What makes the moo
interesting is not how well it can reproduce rl conditions and relations.
Rather, it's interesting because of its alternative possibilities and
characteristics. It's because the moo allows the possibility of a new 
(sub)culture to burgeon that makes it interesting (for me anyway).

[Heinrich]
Some of you seem to assume that this MOO should be at the whim of your desires.
Sorry, it ain't like that. Instead of assuming that the MOO should be
democratic, why don't you make an argument for such a thing? (Are you capable
of making such an argument?)

To simply assume that you should get your way without providing a rationale
leads me to believe that some of you really are children, children who whine
and pout when they don't have "freedom."  (Believe or not, freedom to do
whatever you want to do is only one type of freedom-- negative freedom.
If you don't know what negative freedom is, get off your lazy ass and go
to the library.)

If you really believe that this MOO should be unregulated, free, democratic,
etc.--make an argument for it.  If not, fuck you.

[Ogre]
Heinrich, you consistently ignore the essentials in people's posts. Give me one
good (fucking) reason why this MOO shouldn't be democratic. Give us some
credit, please. Smack's comment about the MOO never saying `access granted'
and only `access denied', while humorous, also poetically addressed the need
to re-examine our interaction with technology and social structure, which
applies directly to the stated purpose of this list. What happened? It was
ignored. In fact I would say there are scores of pleas/questions/postures which
were ignored in the past, so please spare us the `are you capable of making an
argument?' rhetoric.

[Bookish]
aren't we naive to assume that a society lodged in computer memory somewhere
- and particularly a community that claims a certain experimental purpose -
would necessarily have the same givens of "nature and/or law" (my dictionary's
categories of rights)?

there is, on the other hand, a large body of cyperspatial "customs" and
"netiquettes" that make up part of the social baggage of MOOspace, and the
rights allegedly protected by western democracies - but is pmc-moo
*necessarily* or *inherently* like those other social collectivities, or is
there merely a superficial resemblance? and are we really satisfied with the
way those RL "rights" play themselves out?

understand that i am not finally against player-participation in
MOO-governance. quite the contrary. but i *am* against unthinkingly, or at
least too simply, importing already much-abused notions of rights and such
into a space where we ought to be forging a postmodern POLITICS OF POSSIBILITY.
the issues we're wrestling with hand never come out."
glinda [to Barney]: of course not, but not these kinds of problems perhaps...
Barney says, "well, we moved the MOO once and changed some rules for a single,
simple reason... harassment. I don't want people to come here and get harassed."
---
Comrade Blackhand's bomb just put 6 bourgeois programmer class pigs in the
hospital!!
---
glinda dittos, obviously.
Barney says, "I'm not, nor are you all, running this thing for that purpose."
Daffy nods and nods
oura says, "of course not, but it is a side effect not entirely avoidable...?"
Barney says, "no one owes anyone anything here: you all are donating lots of
time and energy to this place, and I trust your judgement."
Heinrich . o O ( Part of the problem is anti-intellectual understandings of
pomo as negative freedom, and negative freedom only )
Barney says, "If Sedate is a butthead, then get rid of him. if others do the same, ditto. I don't have a
problem with this.  They know what they are doing."
oura is skeptical, but doesn't know the situation at hand
Barney says, "I'm entirely with bleary on the toading of sedate, and I think
others who behave the same way should simply be booted."
---
[bleary]
I was opposed to the absolute @toading of Sedate, I thought that
Sedate_In_Exile made some good points.
---
glinda has already recommended that both sedate and his alias set notation be
@toaded.
Barney says, "shall we do it, then?"
Bakunin [to Barney]: It's the `getting rid of' mechanism we're trying to
formulate, isn't it? I have no problem with a means of removing abusive
players, but I am interested in exploring how the society here to some extent
constitutes it (I've not seen terrorists anywhere else), and how to avoid
encouraging such an influx of players.
Barney says, "actually, my own regrets run in the direction of not being able
to tap into that terrorist energy in some way..."
Heinrich suggests again that part of the problem is, Hein's humble opinion,
the name of the MOO as pomo . . .
Barney says, "sure."
Heinrich says, "And the understanding of Pomo as negative freedom"
Barney says, "but what the hey..."
glinda [to all]: to follow up on bak's comment: 
Barney says, "we shall change the name to ArbitraryAndCapriciousMOO and then all will be well."
oura says, "it seems, kinda like glinda was saying, that moos themselves get
perceived as based on negative freedom, as instances themselves of "pomo" and
that the prob isn't unique here..."
Heinrich [to Barney]: I'm trying to point out that we've kiddies here who
haven't thought more than 20 seconds about pomo
glinda [to all]: I recommend that we @toad sedate and set notation because
there is at present no other mechanism in place. AND then immediately implement
@banishment. It is unfeasible, it seems to me, to wait for banishment to be put
in place as lots of players have lamented our inaction ... 
Barney says, "removing genderfuck from PMC-MOO is in line with a general policy
that says you have the right not to be fucked with..."
Barney says, "agreed, glinda."
Daffy nods 
glinda [to all]: and I think we need very much to make a public statement to
this effect. 
Heinrich says, "could sedate be appealed to one more time?"
Barney says, "and the right *not* to is the one we want to focus on."
Barney says, "he's had his chance."
Barney says, "and more."
Heinrich says, "or has he done things I don't know about?"
Heinrich nods
glinda [to Heinrich]: yes
Daffy says, "most likely"
>@toad sedate
Sedate(#2803) is now a toad.

Author: glinda (#1203) 
Subject: policy changes
Last Update: Friday, February 25 1994
===============================================================================
Brief summary of PMC-MOO policy changes and/or clarifications:

HARASSMENT: It remains a central policy of PMC-MOO that harassment of
one layer by another is not condoned and ought not be permitted. However,
a central reason behind the clarification of policies that this $news_item
represents is the desire to distribute the responsibility  -- and hence the
power -- to adjudicate abusive situations from the wiz-staff to the collective
of active users. ALL PLAYERS, especially the more novice ones, are encouraged
to familiarize themselves with available defensive tools such as @gag, @refuse,
@eject, and @check (this latter requires "@paranoid on," unfortunate wording
that).

RESPONSIBILITY FOR @TOADING ABUSIVE PLAYERS: A mechanism which begins to
shift responsibility for social discipline from the wiz-staff to all active
users is being implemented.  This mechanism -- @banishment -- is essentially
a voting data base which tallies users' complaints against a player and will
@toad that player when a given number of users have opted to @banish.  For
further information see: help @banish, forthcoming. 

SPOOFING & SPAMMING: All spoofing and spamming is explicitly disallowed.
Shouting verbs are considered spammy. Any verbs suspected of performing these
tasks will be @copied to $badverbs for review, and @rmverbed from the player. 

QUOTA INCREASES: The granting of increased quota will follow the guidelines
already available in `help quota-policy' with this addition: a review board 
will be set up to assess the *requests for additional quota. Anyone interested
in serving on the review board, @send mail to *wizardry and *politics. 

WHAT WIZARDS DO IN CONJUNCTION WITH @BANISH AND IN REGARDS TO THESE 
RECENT POLICY CHANGES:  Wizards will investigate site_lock issues that
accompany the @toading mechanism of @banishment.  A @toaded character is *not*
expected to reincarnate him/herself as Asshole-II.  Wizards are responsible for
investigating spammy and spoofy verbs and @rmverbing them to $badverb. 
Wizards will monitor email address registration and multiple-characters.
Note: Wizards retain the power to @toad abusive characters under extreme
circumstances. This latter statement is meant mostly to acknowledge that
@banishment is as yet untried, and may present unforeseen problems.

P.S. Sedate has been @toaded.

[Smack] 
As if @banishment was even an issue. Who cares about a Quota Review Board.
Are these our *rights*? Thanks for the mystification.
I hereby renounce my MOO Citizenship and Programmer's Bit.
I hope that you don't @recycle me, because I'ld like to come back and laugh 
at you... Here's to Law & Order... 
The anonymous @toading of Sedate was the penultimate example of poor Wizard
judgement. You (Wiz) lost alot of _VERY_ valuable members of your community
when you killed just one.
Reflect and Remember.
I leave you to the Cyber-Sheep and PoMo Posers.

[Ox]
Wow. What a bunch of dribble that all was. Sheesh.

[Nomad]
It sure was entertaining dribble, wasn't it?
'The MOO as Spectacle.'

[Flipper]
I agree, and I'm one of them. 
But the thing is, folks, the people who run this place don't care as long as
they're in control, and as long as they get to  demonstrate this when the fancy
strikes them. No, they won't admit it. But they know.

I'll see you all elsewhere.
---------------------------

Endless Flames...
Fuck your Post Modernism!
Fuck the Wizards!
Fuck your anti-intellectualism!
Fuck all you newbies who think you are God!
Fuck you Lambdites for invading our home!
Fuck you posers!
But *theory remains...

[Ogre]
So spoofing and spamming are not allowed. Well there go room descriptions.
There go @messages on doors and objects. After all, we don't want anyone being
offended by "So_and_so saunters in happily", "trips over the door sill" or
"picks up A and puts it in B." That is purposely misrepresenting a player on
the MOO. Sadly, this is what makes a MOO what it is. Text descriptions are all
we have.

As with so many societies, we see the legislation getting longer and more
convoluted, and less practical except to many things are to be disallowed,
why are so many preventative (and in most cases, more efficient) methods put
in place for dealing with them? It is a fact that the and @paranoid, are
extremely effective and simple ways of dealing with the raised issues. Why must
they then set up all these forbidding rules which are not enforceable and/or
contradict the very nature of the MOO experience (spoofing, for example)? They
claim they are overtaxed and overburdened running the MOO as it is, well why
then trouble themselves more?

The new MOO doctrines are ill-conceived.

[bookish]
if we're talking about the praxis of a critical postmodernism - one that
is engaged in a battle against the political and personal constraints of
contemporary society, then we have plenty of praxis going on here. teaching is
praxis - and us poor, inactive chatterboxes are, dammit!, teaching each other.
allowing our own preconceptions to be challenged, or allowing ourselves to 
drift outside the tracks that our education and socialization has attempted to
lay down for us, is praxis! and there are some folks here very bravely taking
on stuff which is pretty hard to swallow.

my biggest disappointment with this place is the way that it has been
factionalized - usually quite unnecessarily - and the way that normative modes
of critical engagement or praxis have been held up by various groups of if
"we're the revolution, damn it, and you're not doing it right!" that's more 
than unfortunate - it's wrong-headed. and it's not very postmodern (at least
in the critical sense that i want to use it in). there have been "active" folks
here - like Smack and Ogre - who have done work in code which was interesting,
which school up the community. but has it resulted in a more postmodern space
(whatever that might be.) i've never been able to quite grasp what
postmodernism means to the activist tendency, and - for the most part - they
haven't been talking about theory.

[Post_Modern Guest]
Further the textual environment allows us to explore the Post Modern perspective
of all events as text. A reader and text are interreferential, meaning resides
in the interaction between them. The resonance of words. The signing of signs.
An immersion of ourselves. The text read/writes our brain.

[Deconstructionist Guest] 
Virtual Reality is an intertexual technology. Every word/action affects every
other taffy pull. Where do you eyeballs go when the Lag Monster comes to town?
We have no hope of reaching the end of our rope.

[Nihilist Guest]
No cause! Chaos! We can hardly untangle our words long enough to say our names!
And you ask me what TIME it is! Moral Agency is a is impossible in a swamp! The
State of Nature! Read about it!

[DeMann]
Ethical choices cannot be regarded as the normative choices of a moral person.
They are simply a linguistic category, a construct.

[Post_Modern Guest] 
We must exploit our tongues! We must discover how little we know.

Subject: Petition to stop Sedate and Terrorism
Last Update: Tuesday, November 16 1993
====================================================================
Many people on this MOO have been subjected to a variety of insulting invasions
of privacy, or other annoying insults, etc. Almost all the spying attempts have
been conducted by Sedate, as far as we can tell, and the recent upsurge in MOO
'Crime' (Spamming, attacks, and having your character tampered with in other
ways) appears to be led by Sedate, as well.
Thus, We, the concerned wanderers of the MOO, have banded together in protest.
We have created a PETITION, Which can be signed by anyone, which will be
presented to the Wizards, suggesting that they remove him from the MOO, or
otherwise prevent him from perpetuating his chaos.
If you would like to add your signature to this list, type:
        SIGN #5718
and your name, object #, and the date of your signing will be recorded. Thank you.

I logged in as a Guest on the (then) new system on 'hero' and Defender 
paged me and said, "Is that you, Lothos?" Not wanting to miss an 
opportunity to spy on the enemy I replied, "Yup." I ended up spamming the 
shit out of Newton by making a macro that used his own object against 
himself (as seen here when used on me as Blue Guest). This resulted in 
another heated discussion on the PMC-Theory newsgroup.
November 17, 1993  10:53am EST
..............................
Newton enters through the double doors.
Newton says, "Lo."
Blue_Guest says, "hi"
Blue_Guest says, "quiet over here."
Newton nods.
Newton is glad.
Newton says, "Hmm.. There was some random MOO violence.. Then Armoire and
Bookish, neither of whom have been involved with Sedate's antics,  complained
about my suggesting such a authoritarian method of overkill.."
Blue_Guest says, "Who's Armoire?"
Newton says, "Piece of french furniture."
Newton says, "You see the point.."
Blue_Guest says, "Will all of my stuff be moved over, Defender?"
Defender says, "Maybe they're moderately inclined. I would  personally rather
see Sedate restrained than ejected. Maybe removing his programmer privileges
would do it.."
Blue_Guest says, "maybe."
Defender says, "Not if you've created it recently (after the 10th).  The new
MOO is based on an old database."
Newton says, "Only if they zap his verbs, too."
Defender Agrees with THAT!
Blue_Guest says, "is he the only guilty one, though?"
Newton says, "No, but he IS the ringleader.."
Defender says, "Not on your life.. there's the kids of the POMO Subversives, 
the whole lot of 'em."
Blue_Guest says, "all of them?"
Defender thinks it's likely.
Blue_Guest shrugs.
Newton says, "No POMO Subversive kid!"
Defender says, "Check it out.. that particular object WASN'T ported!"
Defender laughs out loud at this.
Blue_Guest says, "has Winky had any more trouble lately?"
Defender says, "He'd been getting sent to the INTERPOL room by someone's
object.. I nipped that in the bud as well."
Blue_Guest says, "wow, how'd you do that?"
Defender says, "Easy; I wouldn't pass(@args) if the dobj for the moveto verb
was from a Subversive."
Blue_Guest says, "you can reverse that kind of stuff?"
Newton says, "Well, when Lothos got on, 'Winky' set off about a dozen loud
spammish bombs in his general direction.."
Defender says, "In laymen's terms, it checks if they want to send him there,
and puts a stop to it."
Blue_Guest nods.
Defender says, "If the bomb is a single repeating line, the verb will stop it
dead in its tracks."
Newton says, "Beats me, sounds like a nasty stunt."
Blue_Guest says, "what if it's more than one line?"
Newton says, "It isn't.. it's a molotov c'tail type item with a lot of varied
announces."
Defender says, "Bummer.. he can still @gag the item, though."
Blue_Guest says, "do you think the wizards will do anything about this whole mess?"
Defender says, "Also, if someone in his nospam list owns or carries it, the
verb will put a stop to THAT as well.  In fact, it'll reflect it back at the
firer."
Defender shrugs.
Newton wonders.. Do I know you, Blue?
Blue_Guest says, "Lothos."
Newton calmly types some formulae into his Magick Notebook PC.
Newton's voice booms cheerfully from above!
Newton states: Blue_Guest, go to hell..
A hole opens up and swallows Blue_Guest!!! You hear daemonic screams!!!

Newton says, "Lothos is 15' away from me, asleep, because I'm using the terminal
he gets on by."
zoneranger says, "hello"
Blue_Guest says, "Fuck you fascist pricks!"
Newton says, "Lo."
Defender thinks things are bound to get interesting..
zoneranger says, "did I enter a war?"
Defender says, "Nah.. just a case of mistaken identity."
Blue_Guest says, "Not yet."
Blue_Guest laughs!
Blue_Guest cackles.
Blue_Guest goosesteps.
Newton says, "No, it didn't start, yet.. Blue's a spy, and a liar."
Blue_Guest says, "Fuck you too!"
Defender says, "See ya."

This is a dark, cramped closet. Or perhaps that is only the way you see it.

*Theory-MOO Before Apocalypse
Date:     Wed Nov 17 1993
From:     Newton 

Allow me to describe the experience I just had on the new site:
Newton: Do I know you, Blue_Guest?
Blue: I'm Lothos.
At this time, the RL Lothos flips a page of his book, waiting for me to get off
the computer..
Newton: Lothos is sitting next to me, not at a PC!
Blue: Have fun, Nazi fuckers.

Followed by 30 minutes of solid, uninterrupted spam from repeated use of one of
my own verbs, during which time I was incapacitated, as was Defender.
>Blue_Guest logs out.
>Violet_guest logs in.
Violet: (nazi insults)
 Followed by 10 additional minutes of spam, same method.
>Violet_Guest logs out.
>Orange_Guest logs in
Orange then attempted to spam me in the same manner, however, I immediately
gagged him, the command carrying through after a mere 45 seconds.
>Orange_Guest logs out.
Now, really! The Nazi insults are the trademark of the Terrorist group created
by Sedate. (They actually have a PoMo Terrorist/Subversive Player Class!!)
I HARDLY call half an hour of constant spamming a minor thing! And ALL the spam
was ROOM announces, IE, EVERYONE THERE GOT SPAMMED!
I may have better things to do with My time than create Anti-Spammers!
Newbies may have better things to do than be subjected to global-shout
profanity, and area-effect spammers and traps!
I am NOT being unreasonable, here. Even in the most LIBERAL, FREE societies
imaginable, violence and terror tactics are NOT tolerated. if one's home is
being riddled with machinegun fire, it is NOT an Authoritarian idea to wish for
it to be stopped!

Well, Newton, you seem to have brought this on yourself. You're surprised that
you're getting such a violent reaction when you and your little friends started
this petition thing. You think that people are going to stand for your kind of
ostracization and oppression? Get a clue! Maybe you should take UG's advice and
find another MOO! If you can't stand the heat, get outta the fucking kitchen!
Every kingdom has its Sedates. And every kingdom has it's Winkys and Newtons.
I think if we tried to call a truce on this whole war thing, it'd be for the
better. Or we can go on writing up petitions for everyone on the damned MOO!
You decide, bud. I'm ready to wage war or peace. Either suits me fine. I think
the petition thing was a bad idea from the start. If you wanted to ignore
Sedate, use @gag, @refuse page, and all that other stuff. And warn everyone.
Like I'm sure you already did. Like Kurtz, your methods are 'unsound'....
Long live the revolution! Destroy old thought, old culture, old ways!

Well, it's been interesting.  And annoying.  And frustrating.  And enlightening.
For better and for worse, things are about to be different, though.
In the new MOO (ten days away):
You will have to do email registration, and give your real name.
You will not be allowed to be a prick.
You will be ejected for interfering with other people's business, and if you do
it much, you will be toaded.

Sorry, wesley-wanna-be's, there are lots of places on the net where you can eat
up somebody's cpu time, RL time, and disk space to play out a terrorist eg
fantasy: PMC-MOO has unintentionally been one of those places, but it won't
continue to be.  No ogres, no elves, no dwarves, no terrorist class of players. 
I know, I know: I can hear all the (barely) theoretical objections, and all the
other kind too...but hey, we know what MOOs are like when they have no focus,
no purpose, and no direction, cuz we did that.  Now I'd like to find out what
a MOO is like if it has a reasonable code of behavior, a pretty academic
purpose, and a fairly narrow thematic focus.  As one terrorist was recently
heard to say: if you don't like it, go find another MOO, or start your bloody
own.

Barney, the proprietor
--------------------------
Smack and Flipper led an exodus from PMC to Point-MOO where many former terrorists 
took up residence. Both were shortly thereafter granted wizardship for their MOO 
prowess and heroism during the PMC Terrorist Wars.

Ogre remained at PMC, launching a petition for his own wizardship with a new plan
for PMC development. After garnering a large number of supporters including several
wizards, he was not suprised to find Barney completely unsympathetic. In an act of 
political protest and assisted by the new Wizard bookish, Ogre immolerated himself 
during a public performance.

Sedate also remained at PMC, somehow weasling himself a position on the Quota Review
Board, where he still delights in irritating the masses.

The community of PMC has spawned many groping attempts to come to terms with what 
happened. Different player movements have come and gone. The refusal of the wizards 
to address grievances or to foster a new direction has set PMC adrift in a limbo of
player apathy.
