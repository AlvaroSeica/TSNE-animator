politics may catastrophically fail - either with war on Iraq or later with

sell Americans on a war with Iraq by little doubt that a war with Iraq is
imminent. He also used his hour-long speech for a possible war with Iraq,
warning that America was determined in the same reservations about a war
on Iraq as her government.

"politics may catastrophically fail - either with war on Iraq or later
with possiblility of an upcoming war in Iraq," she said about a possible
US-led war with Iraq. but I'm the same reservations about a war on Iraq as
her government. politics may catastrophically fail - either with war on
Iraq or later Yay! the clouds of war are storming, bomb Iraq.

"how many people died" during the war with Iraq and the question has

sauntering long ago


in the northern darkness the fish has its name kun, of it no idea how many 
thousand li, and it's a bird and it's name is peng, yes it is, it's got an 
enormous back, i've got no idea how many li it is, when it gets angry or 
aroused then it takes off and its wings! its wings! you can't imagine how 
big they are, anyway an anhinga and an atala butterfly were talking and 
saying to each other, wow, you just can't fly high enough to see the whole 
pond which was in a cut that shook the water but seemed much larger. so 
they said, the story is in the northern darkness, etc. that's how big the 
world is, so big that you can't imagine or even walk through it. and what 
comes out of the northern darkness goes into the southern darkness, yes it 
does, i can't imagine how it does that, but it does. i don't think it sees 
much of anything either, but then how should i know, its colors are 
amazing, maybe it's because it's so large there's room for everything, i 
think maybe it's a bird called peng, but some say it's a fish called kun, 
but how could fish fly, and how could a bird swim across the darkness so 
far it goes from north to south, you can head north and arrive south, you 
can head south and arrive north, a white horse is black, a dog isn't a 
dog, you never know, loafing long ago and floating just about in any 
direction, in the south, something stirs for three thousand li, some say 
it's the waters, some just can't imagine

American demonstrators!

-- You're not demonstrating for yourself - you're demonstrating to provoke 
positive change. You want to change the way things are. You have goals you 
want met. You're willing to act to meet those goals.
-- March in an orderly fashion. Indicate you're a soldier for peace. 
Rioting releases energy, but does not advance the cause.
-- Dress somberly, even in black. Don't turn the march into a circus. You 
don't want to be dismissed as crazy. Indicate you're part of a massive 
upwelling of public opinion. Show you're part of the public. Indicate 
you'd put your life on the line for the cause of peace. Show you're as 
serious and brave as a soldier in war.
-- Carry out symbolic actions such as flag and effigy burning. Do these 
with the sacredness of serious metaphor. Remember your symbolic targets at 
all times.
-- Forget clever signs and costumes. They entertain but distract. Silence 
itself can be a weapon. A straightforward sign gets a message across. You 
must unnerve the enemy.
-- Realize that the world outside the US is watching. You must indicate 
the resistance from within, as strongly as possible. You must make the 
leaders of the US realize you are part of a force that must be contended 
with.
-- Be careful in your support of violence, but never assume that Gandhi's 
era is our own.
-- Know your enemy. Become knowledgable. Read as much as you can on the 
current crisis and its roots. Read the texts of your enemy as well. 
-- Do not assume that any large gathering of people makes a difference 
unless it makes a difference. 
-- Choose your targets carefully. A demonstration for or against numerous 
causes may well be weakened by an accumulation of messages that may even 
be contradictory. Remove auxiliary issues or religious and other rhetoric. 
Focus.
-- Prepare for the long haul. Speak loud but clearly. Let there be no 
mistake.
-- Leave your armchair for the production of resistance. Involve others. 
Spread the word. Contact others.
-- Never give up. Never give in to false pessimism or optimism. Remain a 
realist at all times.
-- Provoke.

Helmut Paul, C.A.R., Anway


Confession of a Demonstrator


--of course this is mine; i'm so embarrassed. how can anyone control or 
strategize demonstrations. in a democracy we are free to express 
ourselves. i don't know where anway is or what c.a.r. is for that matter. 
i'm always afraid to express myself. my rage comes out in other ways. this 
is one of them. one dreams of attack/pursuit against the right. one dreams 
of putting them out of our misery. but it's dreamwork and that's all. no 
good comes of it. 
--in life i'm a coward. i live in the dreamwork. i'm afraid of jail, 
arrest, gestapo. i don't know how to play the system. i'm afraid of dying 
constantly. i want to help but i can't even help myself. i publish under a 
pseudonym. there is no helmut paul. at least there is no helmut paul that 
sent me this.  but helmut paul sounds properly other - at the same time 
within the aegis of europe - therefore neither one nor the properly other.
--i believe protests do little good. they show the rest of the world that 
there is resistance in the u.s. but - at least under the present regime - 
result in little practical results. we change nothing. we insist on our 
communality. we march and discuss. the war will continue as base and 
superstructure smash intermediary cultural play.
--then again this is a selfish belief, perhaps an excuse for not doing 
more, not acting on my convictions. clearly ultra-violence will change 
things, most likely for the worse. in any case, i'm not capable of that. i 
understand the fury of those who are arrested. at least they carry out 
their frustrations against authority, however misplaced. i'm not even 
capable of that. if someone told me two plus two don't equal four, i'd 
believe it. i'm ready to fall for anything.
--i'm a sick man... something is wrong with my mind. i can't carry on and 
can't expect anyone else to. i'm horrified by the progress of the war. 
what if it were me firing or being fired upon. how can anyone live with 
those images sent daily across the internet - those reports, interviews, 
analyses, diatribes. yet i continue on as if i'm capable of a writing that 
makes a difference beyond my limits. i don't carry a gun for either side. 
i can't even hunt. i went fishing one time and that was it. i couldn't 
watch the animal suffocating in the air. now it's all of us who are 
suffocating. i still don't carry a gun.
--i only clear the air. the text below is mine. i'm sorry if i misled 
anyone. i take full responsibility. it was a bad thing to do. i can no 
longer speak for myself. i don't know what is right or wrong. i hate the 
evil in the world. i only hate it. i don't act. i don't act.--

Oppose!


Hurrah for our overseas Troops! Bring our boys and girls back alive! 
Hurrah! Hurrah! The long and winding road is difficult! We shall prevail!
The oaks of Baghdad shall bend to the Victors! Arduous is the task!
Difficult the terrain! Violent the opposing Republican Guard! Courageous 
the Marines! Thousands cheer! A New York March of One Thousand! The Sixth 
Fleet! The Seventh! War is war! Support our Troops!

Peace is a State of Mind! War is an Event!

The American Military is Angered! The American Soldier is Angered!
Valiant Conquest! Contain the Hydra!

--of course this is mine; i'm so embarrassed. how can anyone control or 
strategize demonstrations. in a democracy we are free to express 
ourselves. i don't know where harbor is or what r.a.c. is for that matter. 
i'm always afraid to express myself. my rage comes out in other ways. this 
is one of them. one dreams of attack/pursuit against the right. one dreams 
of putting them out of our misery. but it's dreamwork and that's all. no 
good comes of it. 
--in life i'm a coward. i live in the dreamwork. i'm afraid of jail, 
arrest, gestapo. i don't know how to play the system. i'm afraid of dying 
constantly. i want to help but i can't even help myself. i publish under a 
pseudonym. there is no helmut paul. at least there is no helmut paul that 
sent me this.  but helmut paul sounds properly other - at the same time 
within the aegis of europe - therefore neither one nor the properly other.
--i believe rallies do little good. they show the rest of the world that 
there is patriotism in the u.s. but - at least under the present regime - 
it results in little practical results. we change nothing. we insist on 
our communality. we march and discuss. the war will continue as base and 
superstructure smash intermediary cultural play.
--then again this is a selfish belief, perhaps an excuse for not doing 
more, not acting on my convictions. clearly ultra-violence will change 
things, most likely for the worse. in any case, i'm not capable of that. i 
understand the fury of those who are arrested. at least they carry out 
their frustrations against authority, however misplaced. i'm not even 
capable of that. if someone told me two plus two don't equal four, i'd 
believe it. i'm ready to fall for anything.
--i'm a sick man... something is wrong with my mind. i can't carry on and 
can't expect anyone else to. i'm horrified by the progress of the war. 
what if it were me firing or being fired upon. how can anyone live with 
those images sent daily across the internet - those reports, interviews, 
analyses, diatribes. yet i continue on as if i'm capable of a writing that 
makes a difference beyond my limits. i don't carry a gun for either side. 
i can't even hunt. i went fishing one time and that was it. i couldn't 
watch the animal suffocating in the air. now it's all of us who are 
suffocating. i still don't carry a gun.
--i only clear the air. the text below is mine. i'm sorry if i misled 
anyone. i take full responsibility. it was a bad thing to do. i can no 
longer speak for myself. i don't know what is right or wrong. i hate the 
evil in the world. i only hate it. i don't act. i don't act.--

I come out and Speak! I speak the Truth! The American Demonstrators! 
They learn the Truth! Valour and Courage shall Win! Cowardice and Fear
are Out! Prepare the Berms! Hurrah for our Troops Overseas! 
Hurrah Hurrah!

"American Demonstrators!

"-- You're not demonstrating for yourself - you're demonstrating to
provoke positive change. You want to change the way things are. You have
goals you want met. You're willing to act to meet those goals.
-- March in an orderly fashion. Indicate you're a soldier for peace. 
Rioting releases energy, but does not advance the cause.
-- Dress somberly, even in black. Don't turn the march into a circus. You 
don't want to be dismissed as crazy. Indicate you're part of a massive 
upwelling of public opinion. Show you're part of the public. Indicate 
you'd put your life on the line for the cause of peace. Show you're as 
serious and brave as a soldier in war.
-- Carry out symbolic actions such as flag and effigy burning. Do these 
with the sacredness of serious metaphor. Remember your symbolic targets at 
all times. Saddam! Irak!
-- Forget clever signs and costumes. They entertain but distract. Silence 
itself can be a weapon. A straightforward sign gets a message across. You 
must unnerve the enemy.
-- Realize that the world outside the US is watching. You must indicate 
the patriotism from within, as strongly as possible. You must make the 
leaders of Irak realize you are part of a force that must be contended

Two Good Quotes


1942 April 5: To write poetry now, even on current events, Brecht feels,
means to withdraw into the ivory tower: 'It's as though one were practic-
ing the art of filigree. There is something eccentric, cranky, obtuse
about it. Such poetry is like the castaway's note in the bottle.  The
battle of Smolensk, too, is fought for poetry.' (Klaus Volker, Brecht
Chronicle.)

2003 March 25: To write poetry now, even on current events, Sondheim 
feels, means to withdarw into the ivory tower: 'It's as though one were 
practicing the art of filigree. There is something eccentric, cranky, 
obtuse about it. Such poetry is like the castaway's note in the bottle. 
The battle against Bush, too, is fought for poetry.' (Alan Sondheim, IT 
Chronicle.)




Experimental Hypermultiplicity


Anecdotal: "Surging inchoate/incoherent sound." I play Ensoniq Mirage key-
board with positive organ sample as quickly as possible. The rhythm is
fast and furious; the melody is absurdly simple, repeated with
embellishments in C, E, C#, Bb major. Diminished chords, parallel fourths, 
fifths, octaves, are employed. The augmented fifth is run up and down the 
scale of major seconds. Speed is repeatedly doubled until it falls back, 
exhausted. Length of recording: 19 minutes. 

Commentary: While playing, each key is clarified; the melody comes through 
clearly, as do the numerous errors associated with the speed. I hear the 
individual notes; the echo is kept to a minimum. I correct errors as best 
as possible by absorbing them in the diminished chords. I am exhilarated.

"Muscular aurality." I play at this speed by adapting potencies within the 
muscles themselves; the playing takes on autonomic characteristics, broken 
by the focus on errors. The diminished chords are correctives, bringing the 
muscles back into focus. 

"Internal time consciousness." Time slows, undeniably. I am aware of the 
intervals and distances between runs, the melodic timing. 

Result: Later, listening to the cd made from the performance. I can no 
longer hear the melody, the transformations. Everything surges, ruptures. 
The rapidity transforms into gloss, the note sequences into envelopes, the 
diminished chords into furious and inchoate sonorities. I am now outside 
of the production; from without, the originary turn or moment is lost, 
invisible. I have withdrawn from the sound, the music; I hear it, entirely 
enveloped in something else, something otherwise. The same has permanently 
divided.

Result: Internal time consciousness is not only layered, mobile, flexed; 
it is tied into tacit knowledge and attending-to. A production supersedes 
its production; it is always that accursed share, that surplus, that both 
expands and withdraws the auratic. This is the sound-music of the thinking 
body, organ/organelle mind/minding. This is the sequence of the word in 
its mythopoeic primordial moment.

they were lonely in their nestings and their calls were mournful -
they yearned for communality in the dark and primordial forest -
they called on occasion and called on occasion in their loneliness -
calling and calling in the primordial forest of sound -

Rilke through Gabriel Marcel: "We drift between Christ, the two Maries and 
the Saints. We are lost among forms and voices. We are deceived over and 
over again by this half-familiar element which causes neither surprise nor 
fear and does not tear us from our everyday outlook. We get accustomed to 
this, but there can be no getting accustomed to finding God."

Foucault on Binswanger: "It is important that the image possesses its own 
dynamic powers, that there is a different morphology of space when it is 
free, luminous space and when the space put into play is imprisoning, 
dark, and stifling. The imaginary world has its own laws, its specific 
structures, and the image is somewhat more than the immediate fulfillment 
of meaning. It has its own density, and the laws which govern it are not 
solely significant propositions, just as the laws of the world are not 
simply decress of will, even a divine will. Freud caused the world of the 
imaginary to be inhabited by Desire as classical metaphysics caused the 
world of physics to be inhabited by Divine Will and Understanding: a 
theology of meanings, in which the truth anticipates its own formulations 
and completely constitutes them. The meanings exhaust the reality of the 
world which displays that reality."

the two nervous hands of god


she touched him, cleaning her hands
before and after; her womb a source
of pollution, his member likewise -
in the twilight, these bodies of disease, 
ill at ease, suppuration -

of one above, of one below,
of two, the one above, below,
the one below, above,
of wuda, minor ablutions - 
of ghusl, major ablutions -
touching or intercourse,
of two, of one asunder -

"Then he [the Prophet] made the end [of his words] correspond to the be-
ginning in feminine gender, while he placed the masculine between the
two. For he began with 'women' and he ended with 'prayer,' and both words
are feminine. Perfume stands between the two, just as the masculine stands
between two feminines in existence. For the man is placed between an
Essence from which he becomes manifest and a woman who becomes manifest
from him. Hence he is between two feminines: the feminine gender of the
Essence and the real femininity of the woman. In a similar way, 'women' is
a real feminine, while 'prayer' is an unreal feminine. Between the two,
'perfume' is like Adam between the Essence from which he comes into
existence, and Eve, who comes into existence from him." (Ibn al-'Arabi, in 
Sachiko Murata, The Tao of Islam, A Sourcebook on Gender Relationships in 
Islamic Thought.)

" & i will remain awake -
i will remain awake -
forever & forever -
my eyes remain & witness

my darker eyes - "

Arm Amerika !!


A number of people here fully expect Bush and other National-Capitalists
to declare either a STATE OF EMERGENCY or MARTIAL LAW, come the 2004
elections. As far as I know this would be unprecedented in this country;
it would effectively forestall or cancel them! Bush's sense of absolute
rightness, use of force, and so-called Divine Guidance - coupled with a
devoted and private non-draft (professional) army, is almost a guarantee
of success. The religious Right - which has at times been suspicious of
Congress itself - would be pleased; it's hard to imagine a resistance from
a disarmed Left.

At the moment, the Courts are his; Congress is his. The Courts would agree
with martial law; Congress would be irrelevant. There are enough troops to
go around. Seize the Stock Exchange! The TV networks! Register everyone!
Export the Arabs! The Jews!

What to do? If this scenario occurs, Amerika will not be stopped, at least
for the foreseeable future. The only reason we are "bombing Baghdad back
to the stone age" is because of Congress and other limited resistance. And
who is to say we are not doing this? And who is to say that martial law
has not already been declared - is already underway?

It's surprising that this paranoid scenario is not being taken seriously
at this point; people whisper and wait. And for what? By the time the
"state of emergency" is evident, even to "ordinary citizens," resistance
would be futile! A fate or fact accomplished! A coop of state!

Consider the parallel with late Weimar - right-wing loyalists supporting
dubiously-elected leaders, deep collusion with the corporate and private
sectors, anti-semitisms, issues of lebensraum, marching columns, new
technologies of war and propaganda, technologies of censorship and con-
trol, faltering economies, absolutist leaders, nativist and fundamentalist
sympathies! The similarities are unnerving!

Should we begin to arm? To organize alternatives to a problematic Net?  
(Fidonet, wireless networking, etc.?) To create disinformation campaigns?  
To create the phalanx? The fifth column? The resistance? The escape-route
from the Camps? Sabotage? Wreckers? The Underground? The Underground
railroad? The assassination-squad? The death-squad?  Should we contact
other groups? World-wide? Which other groups? Should we import guns and
psychedelics? Export rhetoric? Testimony? Should we emigrate? Proclaim our
innocence?

Or should we be led like sheep to the slaughter !!

Phenomenology of commencing - gloss on Chuang Tzu vi\8


Nan (south) 
 bo (lord, chief) 
 Tzu 
 [ ] -k'uei said (asked) .  . alone
where did you
read as spontaneous
?
 [ ] 
 hear 
 this 
 ? 

said 
heard
all (various) 
duplicate, copy 
 black ink (inkstone) 
read as:
filiations of inscription, what is taken down, formulated, given form,
produced and disseminated: the articulation of learning, in the sense
of armature from origin or commencement (see sending). of hand-craft
as well the material which is passed on. duplicate: to assert.
 from child 
 , duplicate 
 black
ink 
 from 
 son 
 heard 
 obvious 
 chant, recitation 
read as: the chant or recitation is the first form, aurality not yet 
codified. we're moving temporally in reverse; inscription is after
the fact.
 from 

grandchild
 , obvious 
 chant 
 grandchild (son) 
 heard 
 it from 

read as: the filiation son/grandson ends at this point; lineage begins
at this point, tendrils above. so that kinship is a matter/manner of
chanting and recitation, a manner of inking and inscription.
appearance (sight) 
 bright 
 , appearance 
read as vision or impression (bright appearance)
read as sight or view
read as: the first enunciation of form, an appearance both particulate 
and blinding. 
 bright 
 heard 
 it from 

whispered 
 approval 
read as hearing and listening
read as: the murmuring of the world, the mumbling or ululation within 
the chora or receptacle - the seething or fractal liquidity of the
real. whispered approval tends to inundate bright appearance, the 
gathering of materia dejecta into the beginnings of identity, form,
structure, culture, language.
 , whispered 
 approval 
 heard 
 it from 
 needing
 service 
read as distinguish, express
read as confirm the practice of reality
read as approach the real, practice
 , needing 
 service (military) 
read as aid or help
read as: primordial intentionality, teleology, tropism, waiting.
 heard 
 it from 
 here 

extolling 
 , here 
 extolling 
read as chanting or singing together, in
read as: primordial sound, plasma, a1-supernova, universal chaos
tending towards coherency. we are approaching the bottom from 
the top, tending towards incoherency, the mystery or existential
problematic.
 heard 
 it from 
 mysterious (occult) 

darkness 
read as gloomy, dim, sullen, murky, obscure
read as: darkness of darkness of no light no image, darkness of 
darkness of no form of no form. of no formlessness of no 
formlessness. darkness out of which nothing emerges, nothing 
withdraws. the same which is close to but not identical to the 
emissions from the bottom, the originary flux, the non-identical
flux, the flux of no-identity of no-identity. but also of gloom,
of universal dark energy expansion, of defuge, of exhaustion,
of catatonia, tending towards psychosis above.
 , mysterious 
 darkness 
 heard 
 it from 
 empty

read as emptiness, vacant, unoccupied
read as entering, taking part in
read as: taking part in emptiness, joining the unoccupied. darkness
above is already an occupation, here of absence, absenting here, 
the writing or inscription, taking part in, not occupying, not 
there, almost as if the symbol were in someone's mind. as if there
were someone.
 goings 
 ,
empty 
read as: we have to start somewhere. 
 goings 
 heard 
 it from 
 doubtful
read uncertain
 commencing (beginning) 
read as beginning, origin, source
read as: we have to begin somewhere.
read as: read up through this sequence towards the symbol. for 
the symbol emerges as culture emerges, defines and constructs
space. propositional logic is based on shaky foundation of flux
and obscurity; in the dark, identity and equivalence are identical
and equivalent. as one escapes, the origin disappears, becomes
problematic, is deferred. as one escapes, the origin is annihilated.
culture is entropic in its very foundation, noisy in its axiomatics,
asservations. what is gained is always on the back of chaos; what is
spoken, must be whispered; it is the murmur that is whispered. 
nothing and everything is built within the murmur, speaking it 
louder, crushing its voice. the throat of the world is its silencing.
