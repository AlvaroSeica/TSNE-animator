Commands for Internet Access - mainly Unix: 


1. telnet

Telnet allows you to connect to another computer or server as if it were
your own. You can, for example, log into your account from another account
through telnet. The general command is
telnet <hostname>
as in for example
telnet panix.com
Once in, you'll be asked for your login name and password. In some cases
you'll get something that looks like
telnet>
This means that the telnet program is activated; to enter a hostname you
type
telnet> open panix.com
and to end the session you type
telnet> close
You can generally get out of a telnet session, crash it, by entering
control-bracket as in the following (where ^ is the control key): ^]
Note it's the right bracket.
When you're done with telnet, type quit, and you'll be out of it.

[In Netscape, you open telnet <site> by typing 
telnet://<site> . That's all. For example, to log in to my home account,
I would type
telnet://panix3.panix.com  ]

[Note that your Netscape needs to have a helper application in order to
do this.]

2. finger

Finger gives you more or less limited information about someone on the
Internet. To use it, type
finger <email address>
at the prompt; for example:
finger sondheim@panix.com
will give you information about me. A lot of places have disabled finger.
If you are using a basic Unix account, you can modify two files, called
the .plan and .project file, to give additional finger information.
You can also use finger to get general information:
finger @panix.com

[Often you'll find finger in a graphic environment, asking for both
hostname and user. For hostname, you would put down (for me) panix.com
and for user, sondheim.]

3. ftp

Ftp is file transfer protocol, useful for getting files. There are a number
of ways to use this and the easiest is through the lynx text application 
for the World Wide Web. At the prompt, however, you can use it as well,
particularly for _anonymous ftp,_ which gives you access to public files at
a server. Here are some commands. To begin, type
ftp <server>
at the prompt; for example:
ftp jefferson.village.virginia.edu
You will be asked to login, and you do so by typing
anonymous
at the prompt. You'll then be asked for a password, which is your own email
address. Once in, here are some commands:
dir - lists the contents of the directory you're in with full information
ls - lists the contents with almost no information
pwd - tell you which directory you're in, in case you're lost
cd - change directory as in
cd pub (change from the original directory to a subdirectory called pub)
get - get a file from a directory
put - put a file in a directory
cd .. - move up one directory
cd / - move to the root directory
help - for help
binary - tells ftp you will be downloading a binary file
bye - leave the ftp session
mget - get several files at once (uses wildcards like *)
hash - lets you know the transfer is active

[Anonymous ftp is automatic within Netscape. To use it, for example to do
ftp to oak.oakland.edu, you would just type
ftp://oak.oakland.edu and that would do it. Note the :// syntax again.]

4 lynx (entrance to the World Wide Web)

[If you are using a graphics browser, ignore this entire section!]
Lynx is the main text-based entrance to the Web. There are a number of basic
commands, including ones running from the option bar.
LEFT ARROW - takes you back a menu
RIGHT ARROW - takes you forward a menu
UP ARROW - moves you up the page
DOWN ARROW - moves you down a page
b - moves you back a page
SPACEBAR - moves you ahead a page
v - allows you to view your bookmarks file
a - allows you to add to your bookmarks file
g - allows you to go to a URL (uniform resource locator) of your choice:
  Most URLs begin with http:// but you can do ftp and gopher and some email
  within this command:
  ftp:// - allows you to ftp to a site within lynx. Far easier than at the
    command line
  gopher:// - allows you to gopher within lynx.
  mailto:<address> - allows you to email within lynx.
  telnet:// - allows you to telnet within lynx (no particular reason to do
    this)
^G - pulls you out of a "hung" lookup
q - gets you out of lynx
You can also set options for yourself, with o; for example, you can give
yourself an editor, an automatic email address, and by changing from novice
to expert, you'll have the URL of wherever you are always available.
\ - shows you the original html document and hitting it again returns you
  to the hypertext form
p - allows you to download to your home pc or your account, or email the
  file to yourself.
/ - allows you to search a document for a particular word or string of
  letters
del - hitting the delete key takes you to the history list, which you can
  use to access previous menus from your current session

You can also do lynx . to get information on your home directory; it
can be used as a general file reader.

5 email

Email runs from a number of different programs. When you send a post you
can:
Cc: (carbon-copy) it to other readers who will be listed on the header
Bcc: (blind Cc) it to other readers who will not be listed on the header
You can forward a post, and reply to a post, quoting or not quoting.
In Pine, you can have an full header option installed, which allows you
to see the complete addressing - so that if an anonymous post comes in,
you can see where it is from.
Lcc: List carbon copy - Bcc which will put the list name into the address
header
You can often have a .sig file set up containing a specialized signature
that will be attached to your post.
Your addresses should almost always be of the form
<email name>@<server>.<domain> and the domain can be any number of:
com (commercial), org (organization), edu (education), mil (military),
net (network), etc.
You can save your mail in _folders_ which can be deleted and manipulated
in various ways.

There is, of course, an email program within current Netscape versions.

6 mailing lists

Mailing lists in general work from two major pieces of software: listserv
and majordomo.
You subscribe and unsubscribe to mailing lists by sending requests to the
software, not to the list. 
The command generally in listserv is:
subscribe <listname> <your name>
To unsubscribe, the command may be either
unsubscribe <listname>   or   signoff <listname>
For full information for a listserv list, write to the listserv, for 
example: listserv@listserv.aol.com and say in the body of the letter
info refcard
The command in majordomo is:
subscribe <listname>
Other commands are
who <listname>  who is on a list
lists  what lists do you carry
info <listname>   for information pertaining to a particular list
unsubscribe <listname>  for getting off a list

7 Usenet groups

Newsgroups must be read through a newsreader. I use tin, which is very 
popular in Unix. Here are some commands:
RIGHT ARROW - go to the next level
LEFT ARROW - back up a level
DOWN ARROW - go down on the same level
UP ARROW - go up on the same level
/ - search
y - Yank in all newsgroups (usually to do a search)
w - post to a group
R, r, F, f, reply to the group quoting or not or reply to the poster, ditto.
<number> - jump to a particular number
m - mail the article to yourself or anyone else
s - save the article in a file (you may have to uncode it)
t - tag the article
b - back up
TAB - jump to next unread
s - subscribe to a particular group
u - unsubscribe to a particular group
z - toggle as unread (keeps the post present in the index)
q - quit
g <groupname> - go to a particular group and subscribe to it

[Netscape and other browsers also have Newsreaders which allow you to
organize the message base according to author, thread, date, etc. Read
the instructions carefully. Note that there are different ways to see
_all_ the newsgroups, and to search among the titles to find which ones
you might want to subscribe to. In Netscape, graphics in Usenet will open
up immediately.]

Usenet hierarchy:
biz, business; comp, computers; news, general news; rec, recreational;
sci, science; soc, social; talk, debate; misc, miscellaneous; alt,
alternative (the largest category by far); also humanities.*
Usenet smileys (just the common ones): :)  :-)  :(   :-(  
Some acronyms: LOL (laughing out loud); ROTFL (rolling on the floor 
laughing); RTFM (read the fucking manual); BRB (be right back).

8 talk

talk, ntalk, ytalk all allow synchronous communication with someone; 
ytalk allows multiple logins
To use it type
ytalk <email address>
and wait. It may or may not be allowed on your machine.
When you are in talk, you can often use ^z which places talk in the
background, and takes you momentarily out of it (to look up information
for example); hit fg (for foreground) and it springs back up. To exit
talk, type ^c .
You can get a simple menu in ytalk by hitting the escape key.
You can make a .ytalkrc file and set your preferences in it.

[There are also talk functions available with some graphic interfaces;
these work roughly the same way. Some clients such as Powwow are graphic
elaborations on talk. Various Web chat applications are slow and clumsy.]

9 gopher

Gopher presents large sections of the Internet as a menu; you type 
gopher <address> at the prompt, although you can also do this within lynx,
and some servers have a pre-installed gopher for you. Gopher searches
gopherspace using search mechanisms such as Veronica, which take in string
queries.
ARROW KEYS work as in lynx 
v - view bookmark file
a - add to bookmark file
b - back a page
m - mail
o - options menu
^c - gets you out of hangup (prompts for ^g)
s - save
d - download
SPACE - down a page

[Gopher is also accessible through Netscape and other Web browsers. If
you want to go to the main gopher site, for example, at the University
of Minnesota, you would type, in Netscape:
gopher://gopher.tc.umn.edu:80 or something similar. See the various
URLs.]

Other forms of talkers and muds have different commands; you can try
to get help by typing one of the following: ?, h, .h, .help, help,
.h, .help, .?, /?, /h, and so forth.

Note that almost all MOOs, talkers, MUDs, etc. have various internal
messaging systems. You can get information through the help menu. These
systems include:
Welcome message (what you see when you log on)
Personal internal email (between participants)
Bulletin boards (public messaging systems that you can write to)
News (messaging systems that you can't write to)
Email lists (on MOOs for research; you can join and write to them)
Paging/answering machines (on MOOs for leaving messages)

There are various clients usable for entering MOOs, MUDs, etc. such as
tiny-fugue; these are beyond the course.
