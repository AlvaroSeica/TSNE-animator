pack

meters in whatever space this is really. you take it with you, carapace 
cloth, it hides you, you move, you move it, it moves. you can move things 
totally gainormous, no leverage involved, only the usual matrix transform- 
ations or maybe perspective all mixed up with sins, cosines, tangents. 
it's all appearance, this thing with its smoke and rafters, balsa struts 
and paper kite folding, the greatest moving freely as the smallest. blown 
air a transformation factored into object emission-spigot movement, it's 
all functions, high-speed rendering gaming physics does. it's that. but it 
give you freedom as well, set up, perform fast, don't even bother to take 
down, just detach, move on before they catch you. audience applause is 
what you live for, every show more spectacular than every other, there's 
no repertoire, just these things that flood, flow about, all going back to 
the dimly-lit (it was dimly-lit) room in the virtual environments labora- 
tory, a few people shuffling about, wires everywhere, up and down them, in 
and out of them. it comes down to files and interrupts, data and keystroke
and mouse, some site and sight involved.

Compression of Originary Bodies

Consider 4 avatars:
f, m, F, M.
F, M, full bodies,
f, m, articulated armature figures
M parents F: F(M)
m conforms to F: F[m]
f conforms to M: M[f]
substituting with liberty:
F([m]M)->F([m]M[f])
F in relation to M, M root:
F(x,y,z,t), where x,y,z,t are real coordinates in 4-space
now consider this a compression of an originary body, B:
B:F([m]M[f]), B in movement from two bodies F' and M',
independent of each other such that H1=F'(x,y,z,t)+M'(x,y,z,t)
H1 = bvh dynamic motion file
now there is a transformation function 
G(H1(F',M',x,y,z,t))->H2(F',M',x,y,z,t), 
filtering H1, resulting in H2
now we have B(t):(H2(F([m]M[f]),F',M',x,y,z,t))
in other words:

The phenomenology of the originary body is dependent on a transformed
dynamic movement file applied to the compression-avatars.

this says nothing mathematically (and is poor math at that); however,
it describes the site of intrinsic performance, evidenced in over.mp4

what does this say but movement files composed of many bodies are
applied to bodies composed of many avatars

we might think of such bodies as matrix-bodies or skein bodies:
what we are witnessing are communities of the virtual body, somewhat
equivalent to the body of virtual communities
think of these as dispersions and coalescences

correct my math.

(The) Only Cosmic Music.

http://www.alansondheim.org/tambura1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/tambura2.mp3

(Please do listen, I am happiest of this of all.)

North Indian tambura digitally descending and ascending.
Perhaps this is the closest one comes to an image-universe.
Artifacts appear and disappear as descent and ascent continues.
For example, audio lissajous towards the end of tambura2.
Of course these are always there.
All music and all sound tends towards this, not towards tambura steady- 
state.
Entanglement with observer and apparatus, intrinsic and extrinsic.
What my ears tell me is what is heard.
What my eyes show me is what is seen.
Loop these for perfection.
There are small events among the continuous movement of the fingers.
Mind in the fingers, among them.
For as not to see after and through eye surgery, the hearing.
And trying not to focus and not to focus on trying.
For the Natyasastra says nothing about the drone.
And the drone is present today with sruti box, melodeon, tambura,
electronic software and hardware.
And is always present.
And is always present and in motion and there is motion in the computer,
there is always motion.
There is always motion that collapses and motion that contracts.
Some motion can't get out, some can't get in.
Some motion can't get out, can't get in.
Sometimes there are objects and states as if existing and these are 
somewhere in the background.
As if existing for all time, to give existence a meaning.
Or huddled-cuddled around themselves, as if there are objects, objects,
objects.
And now you can hear them, there are no objects at all.
As if there were something to hear.
What is heard is the hearing of it.
What is heard are all the times and spaces of the hearing.
Let us call this beauty, untoward.
Let us call.

brooklyn with the left eye


because i'm write/right/rite-eyed-sight/cite/site dominant and now forced 
to use the left, camera tilting w/fixed-focus eye/I/eye-lens with fixed- 
focus lens: what can go wrong? bundling up the color against a u-shaped 
brightness-curve. because neighborhood brooklyn is spring/ing flowering as 
such. but eye/I can't see what i've done, perhaps u-can.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ bklynd jpgs

not only have i taken site for granted, also rite-i-dominance. i think of 
vision as byproduct, a peeling of the surface of the world/whirled, world 
and whirled are me. with my left eye, eye had to search for the view- 
finder; eye-hand coordination was non-existent, as was the remnants of any 
horizon i might have held before me. the whirled veers, precesses, me 
inside the schwarzschild radius. i can't say enough of the virtual; it's 
the area or dream screen that carries entropy. check the equations. my i 
holds off, peels symbol after symbol among balls and spheres. at horizon, 
information is just out of reach, symbols peel off as memory, nothing more 
and nothing accurate. they're heated. the hole collapses, bang boom with 
untoward heat, forget it, just now, I read the text, and it was mine. At 
least for the moment, pre-sent to present. Brooklyn's already disappeared 
- I can't say enough about memory.

Adventures in the Sim Trade: 

Accidental Art and Performance in Second Life


June 2008 through March 2009, I worked in an installation/performance 
space called Odyssey in the virtual world Second Life. I changed the 
environment daily, reflecting dynamic (moving, shuddering) complex spaces 
that were narratives in their own right, difficult to navigate, built on 
phenomenologies of being virtually real, really virtual. I will walk/work 
my way through these transformations, presenting videos and images of 
installations (with Azure Carter), dance (with Foofwa d'Imobilite and 
Sandy Baldwin), and performance (with Sandy Baldwin). This work is unique 
within and without Second Life.

From the original information sheet (all this and more will be explained!)


How to view The Accidental Artist exhibition in Second Life

The exhibition is quite complex; here's some suggestions when visiting:

1. Try turning the glow off. Go to preferences, graphics, and uncheck 
basic shading, if it's on. Basic shading seems to use up more resources 
than anything else with the rendering engine. You can also set things like 
rendering distance; the lower the distance, the faster the loading.

2. Turn the video media button off. This on the lower right-hand corner of 
the screen. If you turn it on, the texture-mapping consumes a huge amount 
of resources. On the other hand, the audio for the parcel (the audio 
button) runs fairly lean.

3. If you find the space too cluttered to enter, try flying in.

4. If you find flying in too cluttered, fly higher, and drop in. There is 
a dome in the center of the space which you can enter.

5. Most objects on the ground level (and some beneath the ground, on the 
seafloor) will flee from you - what looks crowded from a distance might 
well clear out.

6. If it clears out, look up - you'll see all sorts of things above you.

7. Fly vertically to see the rest of the exhibition. If you can't fly as 
high as you want, click control-alt-d, which opens up an advanced menu. 
Open the menu and get rid of camera constraints. You can then move the 
camera at a great distance from your avatar body - your viewpoint moves 
independently, and you can move at least to the top of the exhibition, 
which is maybe a mile or so up, SL measurement.

8. If you get stuck anywhere, teleport back in.

9. Try moving inside the objects; the interior textures are often 
different from the exterior ones (this is almost always the case with the 
spheres).

10. You can push objects vertically into the sky by moving beneath them 
and flying; they flee upwards.

11. You can see the exhibition 'differently' by using the advanced menu, 
going to render, and then looking for info - clicking on any one of the 
info options will give you different viewpoints.

12. You can often sit on moving objects, which will whirl you around; if 
you sit on an object that moves vertically as a result of your proximity, 
you can ride it up. When you stand up again, you can fall down back into 
the space. The riding height seems to be around 4117 SL units, but unless 
you have a flight bracelet or feather, you probably won't go that high.

13. Moving about on the ground level, keep the sound turned on (lower 
right), and you'll hear a variety of songs about SL and language. These 
mix with a number of looping sound modules embedded in the space.

14. If you've been moving around SL a lot, go to preferences, and empty 
your cache; this might speed things up. You'll have to restart SL again.

15. If you see a sign for teleporting, try it. Sometimes it will lead back 
to the ground level, sometimes to the seabed, sometimes to a skysphere. 
All of these locations have clickable objects which will take you else- 
where (or back to the same space but at a slightly different location). 
You might have to right-click on the object, then click on teleport - or 
you might just left click - it depends on the object.

16, Try different 'lenses' - click on control-8 to make the image wide- 
angle, control-9 to return to normal, control-0 for telephoto. Repeated 
clicks work as well - with control-8 you can create extreme distortions.

17. Try moving into 'small' spaces and look about. You can save snapshots 
of anything you see, on your hard drive.

18. That's about it. The general idea is to run lean, fly about, teleport 
back if you're stuck, play with the controls. The architecture is constan- 
tly changing and deconstructing itself - play with that....




eye focus elegie last teyeme now

http://www.alansondheim.org/gluon.mp3 dotar 

this is the last teyeme eye'll be able to _focus_ my eyes,
 one, right, remaining yet for surgery, muscles and lense still
 working fyene,
 Sun Apr 19 23:21:51 EDT 2009
someteyemes working on music eye will come across
eye will come across a piece based on a particular musical deveyece
such is the case with gluon, releyes on a steyele of fingering
breaking out with small sections of revereye murmuring
as gluons spread across the world, a universe
what black hole horeyezon beckons us forward, eye'm coming, going
 nowhere and everything normal, just outseyede every universal
 thinging dissolved or dissolution
so this is elegie to normal eyes, eyes within eyes, within glass,
 so this is a moment before the brittleness of the world
 furiously announces itself, eye would remain deaf, 
 were eye could, seyete already issues with surgereye, oh the one
 completed, 'one to go and fixed,' but what eye shall speak about,
 when music moves from steyele or technique to moment,
 the world holds still, my father in hospital, and
there is no tapping, there are sections, small eyevents, you listen
and you listen with care to these and other small eyevents
for though deaf eye may become and tinneyetus spread, yet sound holds
 supple
sound holds supple and bending with deleyet, no crystalline
and no world and no seyete elastic more than pre-sent now
and eye play for you
yes, eye play for you
wheyele meye eye still moves, wheyele the world still swirl around me

new zone to wander among
high-speed elements captured in such a manner that position 
 is untenable
what is posited is invisible
rotation at 700 rpm +/- and in other words, due to approximation
 configurations constantly change
weathers constantly change

yet another model disseminated from a limited number of parameters
too many models, defuge, useless, one after another, parade of models
wheels or go-karts with no track, no trek, all trick
in such a world self-hatred stands one in good stead

wandering among zones
models of nothing in particular

Romeo Di Giorgio guitar solos

I'm writing an article for Signal to Noise magazine on the 1949 Romeo Di 
Giorgio guitar I own and have used for decades now; it's always been my 
main instrument. As a way of preparing, I recorded the following four solo 
(songs) with it; I was in an odd state and able to actually able to play 
complexly without too much difficulty. This is unusual - it allowed me to 
inhabit the music in a different way than unusual. I've also included 
notes on the instrument - images will follow, at least for the magazine. 
Thanks for listening - Alan

1949 Di Giorgio classical guitar. I bought this instrument in Cambridge, 
Mass, around 1967, and I've had it ever since. I started playing music 
after a disastrous relationship; this was 1962, and I was influenced by 
Lightning Hopkins. I learned chords in alphabetic order, A,B,C,D,E,F,G, 
and the sharps/flats in due order. I went through a number of guitars, 
settling on a Gibson electric and the Di Giorgio. In the Cambridge scene, 
Al Wilson considered me a 'city blues player' because I played fast, but I 
was more John Fahey than Charlie Patton. Other instruments came and went, 
but the Di Giorgio has stayed with me. When I bought it, the clerk at the 
music store cried; he'd been using it himself in concerts. It cost $75. It 
came with 17 cracks and still has 17 cracks. It's gone through two floods, 
one in a closet in Providence, Rhode Island, and one in a warehouse in Los 
Angeles, after having traveled back from Tasmania. 

The guitar is remarkable: inside the soundhole, there's a hyperboloid 
surface extending to within an inch of the back. This is from eighteenth- 
century guitar experiments, but I haven't seen any other contemporary 
guitar with the device. This device is also found in the current Di 
Giorgio Tarrega model (which however has an oval soundhole).

Parameter sets and their construct of the visual

Slowly changing the parameters in Second Life, modifying the dynamics 
accordingly. Note the central vortices towards the end of param.mp4 and 
the rough double helices which reverse themselves earlier.
The three variable arenas:
1. The parameter sets of the dynamics built into the atmospheric space 
of the virtual world; these change over time, hence higher derivatives.
2. The parameter set of the revolution of the invisible armature carrying 
the particle emission nodes.
3. The parameter sets of the emission nodes themselves.
The result is, at least visually, chaotic sets of particles confined 
within parameterized frameworks; for example, no particle lasts longer 
than 30 seconds before disappearing.
"An interesting experiment with close to immediate results."

Death Accompanied by Double Dissipations


The matrix of the habitus corrodes almost from birth.
Nothing is left but memories which are necessarily filtered.
Filtered memories are cauterized.
The corrosion is absolute and complete.
The past is a state of permanent withdrawal.
People as well as environments disappear and most of either have 
 a last time or moment deeply unrecognized: I don't remember when
 I saw him last; you can't see him again.
When did the war end, when did any war end?
These are the deaths of others within the aegis of my death, events
 are always on the horizon.

My death among the lives of others: dissipation of the habitus.
The collapsed habitus, fading out, expands. .
Trails begin without ending; these trails end for no one.
I am no longer around for the trails and their meanders, events are
 always on the horizon.

The trails are objects, processes, scents, sounds, sights.
My life connects them; they're blurred, communal among themselves.
It's always a masquerade, this communality.
A masquerade and a fantasm, always already dissolved and dissolute.
Isn't it like this, holarchic structures observed, created, recreated.
I have so much to tell here, and time runs out.
Worlds and words and levels and what remains, an invisible skein.
Structuring is destructuring, events are always on the horizon.
 
Goodbye to everything who know me, I release you, you release me,
 just as I release you, just as we are unknown among one another,
 unknown among ourselves, ourselves unknowing, events are always
 on the horizon.

the lost Lost text

The main text from the Lost Project created for the trAce online writing 
community; visitors to the site were asked to enter their email address 
and then describe something they lost. On "playback" the list of email 
addresses was separated from the list of the lost; in other words, the 
tether was broken. The text of what was lost is a form of literature 
itself; it had disappeared in my files until now. What was lost is now 
found, what is found can never be recuperated. I think the Lost Project is 
still located at the trAce archives; trAce ended as a community headed by 
Sue Thomas, a few years ago. The project was created around 1999-2000, 
when I was trAce's second virtual writer-in-residence. Please check out 
the text; it's oddly beautiful, the result of so many minds.

and the tambura's going downhill until the end of the world now
and I wonder where the next event will be
and I wonder how long until something goes normal once again
and I think who will be left when radiation kills the world
so once and for all I've escaped to pure processes

terpsichoreographic unit (t.u.)

there are two types of t.u.s - one possessing the pylon of the sleeper, 
the other a black featureless sphere.
a dancer/performer sits on either and an animation takes over until 
s/he rises. there are five animations for each t.u. chosen at random.
spherical shells of particles embed the performer.
the black featureless sphere is a black hole with an inverted event
horizon. the particles may trap the display driver into crashing.
the display driver enters overload and the interface enters crash mode.
the pylon sleeper t.u. is a dream production machine trapping the 
dancer into useless dream production particle phenomena. the particles
may trap the display driver into crashing.
the display driver enters overload and the interface enters crash mode.
a t.u. DANCE consists of 4-5 t.u.s in an environment with performers on 
each. performers may stand and move to other t.u.s.
the t.u. INSTALLATION may be placed anywhere at a moment's notice.
variables include animations, particle textures and stream intensities.
of course one may dance in the vicinity of particle streams which 
continue for at least thirty seconds after the performer stands.
one may also assign physicality to the pylon or black featureless
sphere, in which case the object may be GRABBED during particle 
emission and moved; this creates temporary particle FLORA within the
performance space.
videos below give some indication (between computer crashes) of the
mechanism; stills give a few closeups.

fifth solo most difficult of times

when beginnings fall short of endings
when endings erase beginnings
when origination is a memory of origination
when the end disperses for an other
when time penetrates galilean relativity
then and only then is everything beginning always
and what ever any of us think is only an afterthought
say things, surely i can't hear them
and then about beginnings and endings and originations
and then about time and origination's relativity
nothing anyone can hear but
there are beginnings and endings all virtual and lovely

and it's called 'when beginnings fall short of endings'
and it's called 'nothing anyone can hear'

Levinas in brief

ukulele with 25% pitch lowering
the speed remains the same.
i'm fascinated by the 'lumbering' quality of the results.
it's as if one projects massivity onto the apparent materiality
of the instrument - strings as thick ropes, etc.
most of the harmony is lost or appears hazy.
physical projection i assume is _always_ present in listening.
it's strongly here.
who is writing about this? not even Helmholtz.
it's as if sound appears disconnected from mass, 
just as philosophy appears disconnected from health.
here is a reversal then dedicated to Levinas' existence and existents.
enjoy.


===


I've been following this discussion and thought the best way I might 
participate is to describe the work that I've done with Foofwa d'Imobilite 
and others over the past decade or so. We went from using video and audio 
tracks accompanying choreography, to work in Blender and Poser. The Poser 
work was created from bvh (Bio-Vision Hierarchy) files produced with 
motion capture (mocap) equipment that used 21 sensors electromagnetically 
interacting with an antenna. The antenna fed sensor signals into a hard- 
wired 486 microprocessor that output coordinates; these were fed into a 
second computer that created the bvh files themselves. we modified the 
sensors in a number of ways - some through the software interface, and 
some with limb assignment and position. We did a piece called heap for 
example - the sensors were dropped in a heap and the bvh file fed into 
Poser. We did a star piece, arranging the sensors in a star formation on 
the floor and inverting it by exchanging +r from a sensor position to -r. 
We also reassigned sensors in several ways - dividing them between two 
bodies, remapping inversely onto a single body, and so forth. All of this 
produced bvh/Poser mannequins that were used as projections in live per- 
formance, or chroma-keyed over dance/performance video.

All of this work was at West Virginia University's Virtual Environments 
Lab, headed by Frances van Scoy. I received an NSF consultancy through 
Sandy Baldwin and NYSCA grant; through the former, I had a grad assistant 
from software engineering, Gary Manes, to assist me. We went into the 
mocap software itself and Gary rewrote it, creating a dynamic/behavioral 
filter interface, which would produce transforms from the sensor output - 
before the 3-d assignment to bvh was made. This was modeled on graphic 
software filtering, but the assignments were different - we applied a 
function f(x) to the coordinates and/or modified the coordinate mechanism 
or input streams themselves. The bvh files that were produced were sent 
into Poser for editing; in some cases, Poser mannequin video was output. 
But more and more, we edited in Poser to format the bvh for upload to 
Second Life; this way we had live 3-d performance based on the transforms. 
This performance could interact within Second Life itself - with other 
online performers and audience - or through projection, without Second 
Life, in real-space where performers might interact with the avatars.

The bvh files are complex and avatars perform, most often at high-speed, 
with sudden jumps and motions that involve them intersecting with them- 
selves. The motions appeared convulsive and sometimes sexualized. Foofwa 
d'Imobilite used projects direct from Poser - about 100 files - as part of 
Incidences, a piece produced in Geneva and widely shown. Foofwa, along 
with Maud Liardon and my partner, Azure Carter, also imitated avatar move- 
ment - and this fed back, from dance/performance into programming and pro- 
cessing; at times it has been impossible to tell whether a particular 
motion stream originated on- or off-line.

I've always been interested in the psychoanalytics of dance/performance, 
beginning with Acconci's and Anderson's early work years ago. With Sl/ 
live performance, we've been able to explore these things - particularly 
issues of abjection and discomfort, sexuality/body/language - directly. 
Two other modes of representation have been of great use - modified 3-d 
scanner modeling programs (also from the WVU VEL), and Blender assign- 
ment, for example, of metaballs to nodes; using both of these, we've been 
able to create avatars that have no relation to the body whatsoever, but 
whose movement is impelled by mocap files. These appear almost like dream 
objects undergoing continuous transform.

In SL, everything is pure, digital, protocol, numeric; by 'smearing' the 
animation input, avatar appearance, and location, we create in-world and 
out-world experiences that stray from body and tend towards choratic and 
pre-linguistic drives. We've performed a lot at various limits of SL - on 
sim edges for example, or at 4k 'up', where the physics changes. The 
output is the usual - audience in-world or out-world, as well as video and 
stills. I've had great help in SL programming, and Sugar Seville gave me a 
very large gallery/museum space to experiment with these things - this was 
from June 08 until March 09. I created complex performance spaces that 
were literally impossible to navigate; for both audience and performer, 
everything was negotiation. The results of this work can be best seen in 
my files at http://www.alansondheim.org/ or at http://odysseyart.ning.com 
or through Foofwa's site http://www.foofwa.com .

Foofwa, Maud, Azure, and myself all traveled to the Alps where avatar work 
was re-enacted live; the performances were on the edge of the Aletsch 
glacier. (This was sponsored by a Swiss grant.) What was interesting most 
to me here was the development and performance of a field - Foofwa dancing 
with a VLF (very low frequency) radio antenna, for example - his body 
coupled and modified the electromagnetic capacitance surrounding the wire. 
We had done this indoors with Foofwa and Azure; outdoors, against the 
glacier, spherics formed a deep part of the content. This also paralleled 
work we did with the mocap sensors at WVU - using high-strength magnetics, 
we modified the local fieldlines, almost as if we were modeling general 
relativity's 4-space gravity/mass interaction - the results were similar. 
I'm fascinated by these 'cosmologies in the small'; at the same time, want 
to avoid any easy and false metaphoric equivalence with scientific theory. 
As for the theory of the work we're doing, at least from a phenomenologi- 
cal viewpoint, I've put up http://www.alansondheim.org/sltheory.txt which 
has also been published as a book.

At the moment I'm working with sim overload and self-reflexivity: on a 
simple and neat level, what if a performing avatar connects to an object 
('prim' complex) designed to move away from hir? The result is a total 
[avatar/complex] that flees indefinitely - at least until the complex goes 
out of world.

From sondheim@panix.com Sat May  9 23:45:03 2009

My Father's 95th birthday and why I might not be up to par for a while.

My father's birthday started out with Azure and myself taking a 20-year- 
old Accura in to get a tailpipe replaced and reset after I backed the car 
into a curb yesterday. I still have no proper eyeglasses and was nervous 
after difficulties with the family over my father - we're in Pennsylvania 
helping him, along with my nephew and his partner, since he had a pace- 
maker put in on April 20 when his heartbeat dropped to 38. Ok, we ate at 
Denny's waiting for the car, got the car, went back home, and I lay down 
to take a nap - we were returning to Brooklyn this afternoon. About ten 
minutes later I was wakened by Azure who said there was smoke in the 
house. we couldn't find the source. I went down into the basement and 
found a fire in one of the rooms - furniture burning, specifically beds. 
Azure and Amie got my father out of the house (which was decorated for his 
birthday) and onto a lawnchair in front. I screamed for water, ran 
upstairs and found some tonic which I threw on the fire - the flames, 
about two feet high - were too much for it. So Dan and Azure started 
bringing water down to me and in about twenty minutes to a half hour I had 
the fire out, dizzy from smoke which filled the house. I found a sink in 
the basement that made filling the pots we used a lot easier. The firemen 
arrived and I convinced them not to use their hoses - I was still pouring 
water on the fire. They didn't and we left the house. I returned to the 
house and met the firechief who told me someone had been smoking in the 
basement. No one smoked so we realized someone had broken in. After the 
firemen left we looked around, found no one, called the police and a 
locksmith. The police had no idea what happened and the locksmith 
installed a very heavy deadbolt on the basement door and left. Azure tried 
the deadbolt and it broke internally and the locksmith returned. The cat - 
Katski, my father's companion for nine years - had run out of the house 
and to this point hasn't returned. We looked all over for the cat. We 
locked up the house and opened everything to let the smoke out. Neighbors 
came over. Tonight a circuit breaker turned part of the house dark. We 
have no idea what set it off. We have had three ghost cat sightings in the 
house but no cat and nowhere to hide we haven't looked. My father is 
distraught. We got all the burned furniture out on the back terrace. Azure 
is distraught. We have to figure out what really caused the fire, who 
might have broken in, was it deliberate, we don't think so, we didn't even 
hear anyone in the house at all. We have to have an electrician come to 
give us some idea if the circuitry had anything to do with it. Other than 
the furniture we managed to save everything and clean the place up. It's 
odd to think I saved my father's life given our horrendous relationship 
over the years. I'm the damaged oldest child of three sib- lings. I 
negotiate as much as I can with my brother and sister, my brother 
negotiates with my sister, my sister talks to my father, my brother and I 
try to talk to my father. The house is now under lock and key and Azure 
and I keep going out looking for the cat. Sandy, I'll be on tomorrow; 
Foofwa, I'm going to try and get the grants done; Myk, please let me know 
what night i can call you. I have problems seeing which didn't affect the 
ukulele pieces since I really don't need vision for that. I'm neglecting 
Second Life for a bit. I apologize to everyone for being out of 
commission, I seem to live from crisis to crisis, should not be down here 
so soon after eye surgery for example. Please if you need a response from 
me, be a little patient. I can't see straight and tomorrow the problems 
we're sure will start all over again. We're going to return to Brooklyn on 
Monday if we can.

The really sad things, the cat is gone, my father close to tears, and the 
house all decorated by my nephew and his girlfriend for a nice 95th birth- 
day party. He was getting better and better after the surgery (there were 
complications) but now is repeated a lot more, ever since the cat ran out 
of the house...

firm and meant

having been given the locus solus of a place empyrean within the firmament 
surely to establish basecamp manipulations, here are initial setup results 
which spew yes as usual but provide dance/performance e-poetry poetics 
platform for future digressions, no matter how small or large fractioned, 
at least for momentary production overflowing buffer and boundary alike. 
these construct entrapment modules within which permitted dance/perform- 
ance are necessarily displayed until avatar walks away, yawns, gets ready 
for another emission-mototron. how trapped one is! a cage of one's own 
protocols repeated uselessly as we have shown these many hours. behaviors 
align within the wisdom of the old which rumbles tumbles along. this is a 
continuous transfiguration always returning to the ghost of an origin 
"sitting alone on a couch, reading and visible to a neighbor peering 
through the foggy windows." an avatar in a virtual world controlled surely 
by an avatar in a virtual world. avatar thought is always "caught and 
bought." here things jump around the platform which seems to exhale, but 
nothing very serious. aren't we all tried of psychogeography, don't we all 
wish that something would, once and for all, break? if i'm not careful 
we'll be that thing, the dance of the 'royal-we.'

where that somewhere is, you know what it's good for, it's good for 
nothing, you know that's the truth, nothing whatsoever, it's good for 
nothing whatsoever.

Thanks to Hans Brandeis, I was able (more or less) to repair the Philip- 
pine boat lute, which most likely is a T'boli hegelung. I added three 
frets and a fine-tuning mechanism, and Azure attached the tassel. I 
changed one of the two strings to a b/h and tuned the drone an octave 
lower. Finally we found a matching mirror for one missing, and I waxed the 
body. I placed the frets according to harmonics, keeping the lower four 
(including the 'zero' fret, which acts as the nut for the playing string) 
more or less in the position they came in. The replacement frets were made 
from beeswax and bamboo; Azure painted them, since black beeswax wasn't 
available. In any case here are some images of the (somewhat) restored 
instrument, as well as two pieces, the second based on a riff of the 
first.


Another round


This time, the frets were moved, following Brandeis' measurement of a 
T'boli Hegelung in the field, and the two strings were in unison. 
Musically, I'm fond of these more than the others (which have been 
removed) - hope you like them. - Alan

traditional tuning!)


Story 2003-present

[I have a small Linux PDA, Zaurus 5500, and am often in the terminal. I've 
kept a record of terminal commands since I've owned it; they're listed 
below, as a narrative of activity over 6 1/2 years. Duplicate commands are 
eliminated but indicated by the numbering. The whole is a sad legacy of 
mistyped commands, bad directory addresses, and so forth. 'p' stands for 
telnetting into my panix.com ISP account, 'h' for command history. Hope 
this is of some sort of psycho-geographic interest, wandering in the 
protocols. Apologies for the length - Alan]

Froth


When I went through my collected writing in the Internet Text for a 
forthcoming book, I found far too many of the pieces were depressive, 
almost suicidal in nature. The irreconcilable logic of the family leaked 
into a theoretical that would have been, by far, the better had it been 
purified; I look towards Carnap, Wittgenstein, Jabes, rather than Lingis 
or Freud. Lacan took refuge in distorted mathesis; I tend towards the 
diagram below/elsewhere, another leakage from power into the register of 
cleansed perception; when dirt enters the eye, vision suffers, but not 
within the aegis of dirt.

Below: Filth is hammered among polarities.

Of course pama-mapa is certainly a case of entanglement, strings attached.
The Other continues an afterimage. Just an afterimage.

There is always a blankness, flatness, to the image. The real is already 
flattened at the horizon/on the horizon: 

The real is the horizon.

{ Appearances: falling into the real.
( The inextricable alienness of the world: non-Aristotelian.
{ Dasein.

Someday a post-phenomenologist will begin with the human and devolve, 
backed up against particles, replete with awkward metaphors.

{ As if particles were generated by organism.
{ As if scales implied hierarchies and emergence.
{ Think of submergence, details lost per particle, recuperated in the
{ irretrievable ensemble.

{ Our humanities: struggling with bad metaphors.

For cause skims the surface of froth, organization is the masquerade of 
afterthought.

{ We bring masquerade to the masquerade of the world.

{ Instead of nothing, so many things for so short a space and time.
{ We have no concept of their persuasion.

{ Of persuasion, anyone; of concept, none.

World

String theory knocks a loop into analog/digital, nothing remains certain 
that is one way or another, what occurs can be read accordingly pre/sent 
or sent/from. Holographic theory knocks a loop into ding-an-sich, / Ding 
an sich Ding an sich is unknowable though certainly /: The roads to the 
visible real are tortured, one can't say anything. This is the dead-end of 
philosophy, with the exception of the social - you have justice and ethics 
beneath the aegis of situational heuristics, but one ultimately appeals at 
best to primatology without teleology or theology. What happens to the 
episteme, epistemology, around the circuits of a black hole? The ontology 
of strings and information scattered (presented, coded, irretrievable) 
might as well devolve into mathesis where ideality itself is problematic: 
At the end of the day, nothing remains, but everything is present; nothing 
is everything, and so forth. The broken ontology of the middle way is 
broken in another and more radical way: Nothing can be said, because what 
there is, is literally unsayable. Try translating equation into language, 
language into everyday doxa, dark matter into descriptors, descriptors 
into primitives, primitives into foundations. Give it a go: That the movie 
we watch is ourselves watching the movie, that projection is sourceless, 
that every four vector carries the potential of an imaginary. There's no 
'it' to go farther than this: We are the dream-screen of an unconscious 
universe, no matter how far, how many conventions, dimensions. Convention: 
What we call as a past posterior. Accountability: Unaccountability. It's 
the knife-edge of good things in catastrophe theory transmuted through 
classicism into the anthropic principle, mythos of origins. Cause and 
effect: Scattered. Hallucinated projections named 'real' by hallucinated 
projections. The buildup of dimensions, topologies, branes, dark-matter, 
virtualities: No buildup at all, the baroque edifice of something given 
meaning by something naming by some fantasm or an other. Membrane/brane 
among Planck's lengths, masses, times, embedded seethed or froths as if 
non-embedded. You can always: Add, subtend, augment, the pressure of 
mathesis, eventually loose consistencies, heuristics, seem to dominate: 
The four-color theorem as example. What of this? In the small: Classical 
logics, set theories, Ptolemy and Kepler: Reductions because math can do 
that. Divide and spread, emit, spew, sourceless, targetless, broiling, 
then what might be phenomenologies of coagulations: Maybe Wolfram's 
automata giving shrift to these, cells falling apart, failing, location- 
less. So we're: Present and accounted for as-if 'among us': Therefore a 
literary as if 'object and process' or one or another ontology, creaky but 
functional epistemologies: As long as the hallucinogenic withdraws, 
'doesn't look too close,' as if 'there were looking,' as if 'there were a 
ground of one sort or another,' of which: None of these, they're knot.

World ii

Fields appear to have no touch, nothing germane to the body; one thinks of 
action at a distance because distance seems emptied. Heat transgresses for 
example; nothing happens in mediated space. Magnetism implies qualitative 
distinction; the field attracts or repels, depending on polarity and just 
what is brought into the vicinity. An approach may be +/0/-; two out of 
three attract. Epistemologically, ontologically, difference is drawn out - 
here is something out of the ordinary, perhaps non-Aristotelian, who 
knows? In any case, it's neither 'spirit' nor a thing of the world, 
although clearly it is of the world, within the world, part and parcel of 
the real. No hands push or pull the metal; were it not so common, it would 
be miracle, but it seems to 'come along with' everything familiar. Even 
boundary is contradicted, and one might be sure that the attractive 
impulse, presence, is there, even in the absence of the Other. It just 
_is._ This should, except for that familiarity, already have signaled a 
break, bringing the edifice of thing and logic down. How is space and time 
- how is space-time - when something so common is there that is not within 
as an object is within, that is not graspable, except by effect? Energy 
already seems something other than the world's thinging, yet just as 
concrete. It's not far from these considerations to an aporia of three- 
dimensionality, not to mention mass, image, light, heat, all those spatial 
fillings that seem neither possessed of projection or ordinary physical- 
ity. The clues are there, have been there. Yet again, the dream is an 
Other whose ontology isn't simply a mapping for or against a real (which, 
yes, might be the dream itself) - we're back where we startled from, 
making harmony and fit where none exists in the life-world, where bridges 
are ad-hoc at best, still taking on the characteristics of extensions and 
truth. Then there's dirt, filth; I remember Socrates' bypassing mud as 
ideality - already a fly in the ointment. What simmers beneath the surface 
isn't just abjection; it's also froth, roil, wisp, membrane, magma, clay, 
plasma, species productions and particle rains. And it's here that the 
dissolution of things is the clearest, that humans are capable of tempor- 
arily reining-in, a momentary act of meaning-generation. Yet we're invaded 
by our knowledge; our projection bodies are processing, in the process of, 
corrosion, of being-vanquished, of always already disappearance of memory 
and noise. When lines are drawn, analog/digital, they're dependent on an 
alien phenomenology of potential wells: Existence is always bypassed, and 
bypassing characterizes existence. Fielding and being slough and incohere; 
to be sure there are formings and swarmings and no one can say much more.
