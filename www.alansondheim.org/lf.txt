

the russian ballet dancer nikuko states her case


i am nikuko, tell me, nikuko, about your self in the silence of my ques-
tions and the murmurs of your answers

i am nikuko, i am a ballet dancer. i wear a lovely tutu and i love to rise
into the air

when i rise into the air my head swells and fills all heavens like a mon-
goloid idiot

my love alan comes and takes me from nijinsky's arms, he's an idiot too

alan does a perfect cabriole and my heart sways in time to his inner music
and it is so very beautiful it takes my breathing far away from me and i
swoon, sometimes falling to the ground in ecstasy

he will play with the edge of my tutu's fifth and outer layer, moving
slowly in across the ruffles until he reaches my innermost thigh. he is
pure instinct, his thinking absurd, his hands the measure of any delicacy

my body opens, petal after petal, ruffle after ruffle, until i am exposed
to him and audience, his naked flesh hovering in perfect cabriole, in warm
damp air

if i had a gun, i would end my ecstasy, i would return sigh to sigh, 
breath to breath, i would be alan, knowing pure flight, as i rise up,
above my slippers, above the flooring and the eyes of the ambassador

the ambassador would clothe me, take me from the boards of the stage and
make me his very own. but i am lighter and more ecstatic than air, and my
rising is rising forever, and there are halos in ice-crystal clouds around
my tresses, my eyes opened to the sun and moon

nikuko has come to speak to nikuko, nikuko who is not there, hearing my
thoughts rustling along the bones of my cheeks, the tendons of my neck,
the muscles of my back and legs, the tendons of my feet and toes, and air,
so pure air

watching alan at his perfect cabriole makes me yearn and cry, watching
nijinsky reach the heights of his profession fills me with tears

alan in his perfect cabriole, his body touching his body at the height of
the leap, staying taut and there forever

nijinksy in his pirouettes, his neurotic body twisting, nijinsky will have
none of me, i will have none of him

above nijinsky, i will rise, beneath alan, i will serve, i am a female, my
rising limited by my perfectly formed tendons

my perfectly formed tendons touch my perfectly formed legs and calves, my
thighs beyond perfection my waist beyond comparison, my breasts and neck
exhilarating, my face shining with the light of pure air

my body unfolds like petals, there are girls in me, girls speaking through
my mouths, girls listening through my ears; there are girls searching
through my eyes, girls dancing through my legs, girls everywhere in ecs-
tasy

i will rise up before you and i will rise up before you and there will be
no understanding and no thought and the world will be white milk and yel-
low light and halos in skies of crystal and eternal day

Film on the Eyes


There's a blasted landscape in the rain, a small seaside village, asphalt
road soaked in the downpour beneath dark grey skies. Azure sits at a table
where a man is dissecting a fish over and over again in a shallow rectang-
ular pan. It's being filmed, and she has to sit there, the willing student
for twelve hours at a go; we need the money, she needs the experience. The
cameras are nowhere to be seen.

I'm jealous, all twisted up inside. We're supposed to go to Pennsylvania,
to see my mother who's quite sick. But this is an excuse for me, for my
insecurities to rage. I want her to work, remain independent; I want her
to come with me; I want to possess her; I hate myself; I want her to be
free; I want her independent of what I want for her, from her, in her.  
I'm all twisted up inside; it turns nightmarish, revolves around all too
familiar tensions; I can't think straight; there's no way out; everything
is run-on, turning back on itself; I wake up, sweating; the room is light.

Azure goes down to get the mail; I'm writing this; in the back of my mind
there's that sea-side town; everything is dark; there are trees with
cragged and broken branches; the trees are blasted by the wind; they're
outlined against the dark and violent sky; the man at the table and Azure
are soaked; I see them from a point of view slightly behind her, above
her left shoulder; she's watching the dissection, slightly distanced; the
camera doesn't move, just swings on occasion to the street, which is also
the main street, shops with small windows, dark wooden fronts; nothing
happens except my emotions; they're turning around inside; the sea is an-
gry and frothing; there's a small sea wall behind the man who sits facing
Azure and dissecting; it's cut stone, the terrace in front of the wall is
also cut stone; the two chairs and the table are the only furniture; the
terrace is empty otherwise. In the background, the contract; Azure will
remain there for the duration of the film; the film will be made in the
wind and the rain. Further in the background, my emotions, out of control,
impotent, churning and devouring me. Further still, the dream, the bed,
the room, the sun shattering the street outside, Azure and I waking, my
telling her the dream.


(I think of a film, The Phoenix and the Squid, the animal writhing and 
dissected on the tray, cream-white belly open, I'm working hard at the 
wounded child inside me, clawing at my throat, my brain, my thighs:

The film ends in electronics sputtering out, the tray full of organs 
and liquid debris, logs in the water, ruined exports.)

Doctor Leopold Konninger


Doctor Leopold Konninger says to Nikuko: We understand each other
perfectly.

Nikuko smiles. She has heard so much about the doctor. She says: You are
mine for the evening, doctor. I will dance for you and no one else.

The doctor wears thick pince-nez. He wears a black top-hat. He carries 
a cane. The doctor is silent. His eyes glitter.

Nikuko says: But you must do one thing for me doctor.

The doctor is silent. He is waiting. Waiting gives him an advantage.
Nikuko says: You must remove your clothing. You must remove your 
eye-glasses. Who watches me is also watched.

The doctor is silent. Nikuko continues: I will wear my tutu. It is 
embroidered with the flags of all the European nations. I will create 
a free and independent Europe. My entrechat speaks eloquently of free 
and sovereign states. My cabriole carries happiness to the skies.

The doctor is silent. He does not know what to think. Nikuko begins to
dance. The doctor removes his pince-nez. The doctor puts down his cane.

Editorial


Humans have always desired the sculpting and illuminating ray that is
capable of cutting perfectly through enemy territory, carrying the victor
along its trajectory. But our rays are noisy and corrupting; radiation
sloughs skins everywhere, out of control; pollution sends tumors and can-
cers raking through entire populations; guns spray random bullets into
unsuspecting crowds. We believe in brilliant red and yellow power strokes
or force-fields; then we create lasers that run into the obdurate inertia
of the real - heating, absorbing, reflecting.

We believe in flight by caped invincible transforms of the human; we find
our aircraft unbearably heavy, the potential of fragile coffins, cracked
by the slightest jarring.

All and everywhere, we run into the stolidity of the real; our attempts at
purity are dirtied, soiled, by abject infiltration. Our dreams are fascist
- of perfect power and cleanliness, of functional empathetic shamanism and
nuclear families eternally glued together; we ignore or downplay the real-
ity of disagreement, disagreeableness. Whatever is unaccountable or unac-
counted-for immediately turns into an attack on science, on rationality,
as if ancient forces are waiting in the wings for technologies to just go
away.

We are desperate to become anime heros, to draw a pentagram in the air and
watch something _happen._ Our dreams are of actions and times at distances
- with no intermediary, with the potential for full regression. Eternity
appears to loom in every direction. The reality is the blemish on the skin
and the ravages of age; the reality is the frailty of the body against a
bullet or falling brick; and the reality is a pentagram drawn in the air,
the fingers desperate to make meaning, the mind at total loss, angry and
already making detours.

AGENDA


The Ambassador announces the Report of the Committee on Relations with the
Host Country and the appointment of a member by THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESI-
DENT acknowledges. The Ambassador announces the Report of an International
Atomic Energy Agency. THE PRESIDENT nods his head.

Doctor Leopold Konninger is supposed to be chairing the meeting on Human
Rights Questions, Including Alternative Approaches for Improving the
Effective Enjoyment of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Where is
Doctor Leopold Konninger asks THE PRESIDENT and the Ambassador turns his
head.

Doctor Leopold Konninger has drawn up the Vienna Accords in relation to
their Comprehensive Implementation. The Ambassador eagerly awaits the
Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture and Human Rights in Afghan-
istan. THE PRESIDENT goes to a closed meeting on the Rights of Peoples to
Self-Determination and the approval of a draft pursuant to that effect. 

Doctor Leopold Konninger, says the Ambassador, is worrisome these days.
The Ambassador is in charge of Special Human Rights Violations in the
United States of America. He is also the Special Rapporteur on the Sit-
uation of Human Rights in the Sudan.

Doctor Leopold Konninger is considerably weakened; he has not eaten for
several days, and promises not to eat for several days more. He is still
naked and quite cold; he has eyes only for Nikuko, the beautiful Russian
ballet dancer and her cabrioles. Nikuko is stunning in a lavender tutu and
matching tights and slippers. 

Doctor Leopold Konninger has killed many people. He watches Nikuko close-
ly, his pince-nez back in place, his legs and lips slightly parted. For
the past two days, he has not been able to think of death, nor his work
promoting Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought
and/or Desertification, particularly Those Countries South of the Standard
Equatorial Zone. He believes he owns Nikuko, grown her like a plant or
animal or human. He believes he has fed her body and thereby owns those
transformations of her body pursuant to proper nourishment, Nikuko eating
during her pirouettes, drinking during her entrechats.

Doctor Leopold Konninger cannot imagine speaking a single word. He cannot
imagine anything. The Ambassador says to THE PRESIDENT, who has returned
from his closed meeting, to the subject of Doctor Leopold Konninger, there
no longer corresponds an object.

THE PRESIDENT nods. He and the Ambassador leave for the Meeting for the
Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the
Prostitution of Others. They pass by a door, imagining Doctor Leopold
Konninger and Nikuko within. THE PRESIDENT says to the Ambassador, just
as Doctor Leopold Konninger is a subject without a corresponding object,
so does this meeting have an object without a corresponding subject.

Hit? n You have 19 Dealer has KC+AD+2D+TC = bust You win $2 Action $6
You're even New game 5C up 4D+5S Hit?

They are both thinking of Nikuko. They cannot imagine what is Nikuko's
and what is not Nikuko's. Nikuko cannot imagine either. She is at the top
of her form.

wanting to move the panorama, and the fields of dawn and dusk,
into the realm of eternal night, where there are killings
gone underground or bomb-blast night in the dark distance,
shattered hard and splintered, against icons raging in the desktop sky -
there's knowledge in thickets, someone is hanging there -

for a moment humans shrink earths and worlds, planets and moons,
and for a second a single shaft of sunlight makes us beg - 
that a savior will come, or a plague or pure annihilation -

i compress the panorama, place it in my pocket, harden it -
it's a thing of memory, i'm hiding down there in the thickets -
you won't ever find me, there more than one body -
they're in the trees, swaying - they're on the side of the road,
they're a comfort to me, i lie among them -

in the distance, a voice - who is hanging there?


===================


watching the project develop, i go inside me
i don't know what i'll find there, things reveal themselves
things push themselves out, there are always new things pushing
i want to burrow in the ground, i want to hide there with you
i'll give multiple births, i'll eat soil, my hair turns matted
i'll go further than any of you although it will seem like i'm
  standing still
my dreams push themselves out, shinto begins to give way
the spaces are cluttered like the nikko shrine
my chest tears out from within, others strip me of my clothes
i go in as far as i can
there's no more room
looking out, panoramas everywhere, i suppose there are suns
tell me about the suns, i can't speak
what can i tell you when my arms are bound, mouth close against you
turn around, i'm pressed into your back
i'm in you, dark and loving comfort, panorama black, countrysides
  disappear
in the distance, a voice - who is hanging there?

Lecture: Natural Kinds

 
Sat Nov 6 01:07:18 EST 1999 first off, I thought of a single node with
numerous links; only one was connected, as if the others were absorbed in
it. the centrality of it, the vulnerability of the other nodes, this was a
misrecognition. i would have diagrammed this, a shimmering of the real in
which each entity is affected. Sat Nov 6 01:08:29 EST 1999 further, it had
to do with natural kinds; the question came literally to mind - is a
"natural kind" a natural kind? what sort of universals occur? for example,
think of water. Sat Nov 6 01:09:24 EST 1999 I then went to think of water.
there are names in every language, in all possible worlds, but they are
tied to water, water then remaining at the node, the shimmering of the
forms, and connectivities, node to pointer of the proper name, but this
seems insufficient. why so inefficient? let's say it has to do with data
storage, a kind of stability generated. I'd lecture on this, improvise,
continue, go ahead with all the ramifications. in my imagination, I
pictured the audience, myself pacing back and forth on the stage, gravity
taken for granted. Sat Nov 6 01:11:25 EST 1999 because the style of the
world is that it remains, its obdurate nature, that things remain
sufficiently in place for life to promulgate, memory to use devices. the
subtexts of the devices are the encodings of the real, which are stable.
it goes back, all of it, to non-equilibrium thermodynamics on ultra-fast
time-scales from within. it goes back as well to nearly-decomposable
hierarchies of the real, the impossibly slow decay, if any, of the proton,
the relative emptiness of space, our planetary luck with our collisions.
Sat Nov 6 01:13:02 EST 1999 more than that, the node as generator - all
those names. or as if the node itself generated the names, locale after
locale, their interdependencies and modification occurring on a
superstructural level, but always already connected to the real. that's
the inherent tendency of language, always - towards the real. Sat Nov 6
01:14:07 EST 1999 language of the real and towards the real; it's not
disconnect, but connect so tightly that it literally becomes unimaginable.
language and the real bound, not through parallelisms or empathies, but
through natural kinds based on hyperstable tendencies of the universe as a
whole. Sat Nov 6 01:14:59 EST 1999 fading from culture is fading from
language, returning from culture is returning from language. where the
returning or fading transforms, what teleologies, what places or spaces,
is unsolvable - there is no solution, just as there are no places and
spaces as such. Sat Nov 6 01:17:06 EST 1999 the solution is in the absence
of the solution, in spite of which, worlds work away, as with the three-
body problem - the world works, no matter the mathesis, which in our eyes,
follows suit. Sat Nov 6 01:17:33 EST 1999 the descriptions are non-imagin-
ary, unimaginable.Sat Nov 6 01:18:36 EST 1999 Sat Nov 6 01:18:36 EST 1999

Sat Nov 6 01:07:18 EST 1999 one that is realized, sensory bandwidths and
relativisms become more and less important. less important, since techno-
logical or linguistic extensions are literally that, on the deepest imag-
inable level. more important, since the relativisms point to superstruc-
turality in need of deconstruction, which can never be completed; every-
thing is equally always already in a state of fading from culture. go
where no one has ever gone before, to the deepest couplings and linkages
of the world. then you might lose your grips on natural language, as you
slip towards natural kinds. Sat Nov 6 01:18:09 EST 1999 the descriptions
are non-imaginary, unimaginable.Sat Nov 6 01:18:27 EST 1999

to ring, we're not home, we might as well be: no one sees us anymore. no
one calls; people make arrangements, never follow through. it's as if we
don't exist. it's as if we're pure electric, ghosts in real life. it's as
if we're on the wrong end of language, curled in upon ourselves, foetal,
self-absorbed, self-devouring. friends have disappeared one after another.
the phone doesn't ring. no one calls and soon there will be no way to call
and no one to receive anything. potentials fray at the edges. i carry mem-
ories of spoons in my eyes; you can see them. there's nothing else realis-
tic or 'non' in the world. transforms Your on me...

your lost-body-skins are mine. lost-body-skins are catastrophic, cracked
in dim places in the midst of mother-boards; everything stops as cells
slough, dna replicates among the integrated circuits. inside we burn; i
hurry to the phone hour after hour - no one is there.the mail slows; even
advertisements aren't dropped into the vacancy of the house where we con-
tinue to eat, less and less. azure and i turn anorectic; thinned, our
skins show us more than naked, every pore exposed. azure says we're punct-
uation marks; i think ellipsis.there are no dissenting voices; our famil-
lies have given up on us. walking out of doors on occasion, we're invisi-
ble to everyone.no one sees us anymore. no one calls; people make arrange-
gements, cancel them out. it's as if we don't exist. it's as if we're pure

hanging text iii

i've gone in as far as i can go. i'm choked on all of it. i'm waiting for
you. i'm waiting for the line to hang up. i'm waiting to hang from the
line. i'm kept hanging. i'm in there. i'm pressed out of your back. i'm
pressed out between our legs. i'm broken in there. i'm all colors of the
rainbow. i'm in shame. i'm hiding myself. i'm exposed. i'm troubled with
all of this. i'm nowhere. there are no suns to tell. i know i'm bound to
tell you. there's nothing to look at left or right. there's everything to
look at which empties it all out. what could be, what is emptied out.
there's no truth but i'd at least include this in what might be seen as a
search for it.

i stop by the nikuko shrine. it's ornate, ornamental, elaborate, convolu-
ted, repetitive, baroque, rococo, encrusted. it's all over me. i dream of
a black line through the deep carvings, gravures. it carries me like a
lightning fork through it. i realize - in real life - i've swallowed frac-
tal energies churning in me. they're black carrying my holes into unknown
tunnels i enter to find myself hanging there.

my words huddle together in the tunnels azure and i make into each other,
forking. i can't hear anything and scent dominates, chemicals pressing
into closed eyes. so i remember any scrolls i come across, there are a lot
of them and i'm thinking about them. they unravel into a luminous eye:

to be chanted by burned and hanging bodies:

large and luminous eye, detached, in its fullness, circumscopic, sphere 
of surrounding waters

reflecting within towards diffusing centers, there you would find,
invisibly, coalescing of emanants

we would not be acquainted with the emanants and their coalescing, 
nor of the large and luminous eye, lidless and always open 
to its internal light

nor would we speak of size in this indeterminacy of the sphere, emptiness
surrounding, nor would we speak of the quality of this emptiness, nor of
diffusing centers or diffusing center, nor of number before number

nor of the moments, before which time moved exponentially from infinity,
into and out of infinity, nor primordial concepts of into and out of, nor
primordial concepts of infinity

thinking when time beginning exponentially, thinking 
of the singularity of the vector or ray, 
the direction among sphericities,
growth of a circular nimbus on the exterior, primordial exteriors, 
waves of circumscriptions, splittings and emergent emanants

primordial names among with nikuko emerging, of wisdom and ambiance,
turning back towards diffusing centers, submerging, primordial pulsings 
and rhythms

and meanings the beginnings of shrines and primordial powers,
emergences without beginning, paradoxes of progress and development,
the eye, i, i, i, i, i

now so sadly hanging burned upon the tree, 
now turning slowly in the wind,
now long gaunt arm descending, now long fingers 
almost touching the ground, slowly turning around the object,
slowly grasping it

thinking  f   i think  f a h le in the gr und in y u in me in the text.  
t day i did self-cens r after feeling cens red, having fielded a request
t  rem ve my w rk fr m a c llab rative site. it was explicit transf rmed
images, it was images, the w rk was a singular, it was the descripti n  f
c l rs in relati n t  interc urse fractally transf rmed, splayed acr ss
the b dy  r cut / inscribed,  r appearing t  be inscribed in the b dy.
what  f this, this is  nly news, n t  f great interest. there is a back-
gr und pan rama  f c untryside, yes, i was reacting t  this, imagining the
hanging  f children and w men, the hangings  f dissidents, the vi lence in
every c untryside that is settled and humanized. and i wanted t  burr w
beneath the gr und int  thickets and h ll ws and fuck crazy there, turning
my b dy inside- ut with azure's, t p l gically entwined, alm st murder us
fits am ng  utselves in the seepings  f the black earth and shad ws  f
 vergr wn trees and limbs cragged, encrusting the gr und. 

we stumble among the roots, twigs scratch us and cut us open, we grab each
other bleeding, our lips are torn, azure's breasts, my cock covered with
thorns, we're screeching beneath the surface, grabbing at o's, reinserting
them everywhere in the text, we can smell the fecund earth reproducing,
seeds growing, stems thick with syrup thrusting their leaves into our eyes
and mouths, we can't see anything, the scent is so thick.

flash flash go the images then churned and exploding across our bodies and
all colors in the glorious light and i make beauty-photographs and place
them lovingly in wonder-directory where they are desecrated and misunder-
stood WAAH WAAH! and i take my images and hide them in me and take them
away from all the people and place them on my eyes and no one can see them
and they're all i have in this great world and we scuttle back into the
undergrowth and bury the images in the black earth and we grapple each
other and there is sap pouring from our mouths

this is my last time here. 
these languages begin to fade. the transparency of skin. 
your shadows, pens and pencils, are outside my inherent languages.
your love destroys my languages.
they churn dark in the valley where you huddle.

your dead words are your pens and pencils, skin and languages?

before I die.:yes sure, whatever, eating each other, it's the stuff of
typography, what makes lead, what poisons the body, you wouldn't know

"Elsewhere, I've removed the exclamation mark from a point within a text,
calming everything down. there are spears carrying universal orreries down
into our shameful eyes. I want things calm, flat, the whole world smoothed
and healed, spikes as well. no lead typography or dead trees. thinking in
very many streams, flowing without ripples, sheen."

"Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger"

"Last night I dreamed of famous Russian ballet dancer Nikuko still slowly
pirouetting before Doctor Leopold Konninger, the two locked in mutual
fascination, obsession, to the exclusion of everything else. An orrery,
impenetrable, the body writing itself into space, turning on the wood of
trees - the Other, seated, upon the same."

"I don't"

"I don't want to murder anyone's words.:silence anyone. :I don't want to:I
don't want murder or death.:I don't want to murder anyone's words. Come
with me, I don't want to murder anyone's words., Doctor Leopold Konninger!
dark eyes and blind shamefulness:so yes, through my eyes, your spike I
cannot see alas:so very shameful eyes:your doing with me:your taking me
Come with me, dark eyes and blind shamefulness, Doctor Leopold Konninger!"

Re-Port


I am very exhausted. I'm looking at a book of Japanese emaki, picture
scrolls. The women lean in Heian images. Their kimono are jagged. My mind
is jagged. Something is wrong with me. I don't know what's wrong with me.
Azure says I walk around tired all the time, and I know I need help. I
can't afford it. I'm used to reeling around. It's late in the day for me.
I'm reading Akutagawa Ryunosuke. Read some Shinto texts today. I'm going
away tomorrow with Azure to my parents' house. I'm hopeful for rest and
meteors. I'm drinking green tea. I never sleep right. I would lean over
into the jagged kimono, my cheek cut and bleeding all over the tatami, no
one would ever notice. I see these letters in "double." I think, I say to
Azure, English is like kanji; look at the expressions "I get to go to the
movies." "I've got to go to the movies." Both are completely different
idiomatically than their formal syntax would indicate. I'm trapped by the
grammar of get up, get out, get in, get down, take up, take down, take in,
take out, done in, done for. I'm done in, feel done for, a bit down in my
get-up. It's all memorization; there's nothing left to English but the
plurals. I'm sure, I say to Azure, that all will become a row of monads,
singularities; the syntax will crack, fall through to the floor of the
chora. I'm afraid I'll wear Azure out with my own wearing-out. I want to
play guitar faster than ever. I wonder about the confusion of being in a
plane falling at .86 the speed of sound in any measurement. I have three
small woodcuts taken from a Japanese book; I bought them yesterday. There
are three women, each leaning, each Heian in appearance, stylized. I
imagine the tensed energy of the curved body beneath the minimal dozen of
layers, slim fish through currents of dyed orange, white, and purple
cloth. I wait for the angry sun. I fall to the floor, not tatami but sad
rug and wooden boards. This building dates from 1870 at least; there are
photographs. I crawl towards the window; just beyond, I see Murasaki
suspended and leaning, and what could be so beautiful. In the midst of
fantasy, exhaustion is very very real. I tremble; my muscles ache. I can
barely see the words. A port in any storm.

Once More, with the Usual Feeling


He's going to do it again, there will be some dismemberment, said Jenni-
fer, said Julu, he's got all these attributions of talk, no one's really
saying anything, he's trite, talking to himself, repetitious, it just goes
on and on. Someone throws a bowling ball, said Alan, and down goes Julu.

Someone said something about being really tired and hadn't they heard that
before, anyway, those who were left? People left the reading "in droves,"
although Nikuko (kill her!) had no idea how many that was. We're all tired
said Doctor Leopold Konninger; Nikuko, the "famous Russian ballet dancer"
(as if we didn't know!), was unable to wind down. Alan thought the narra-
tive demanded this continuous state of being-in-motion on one hand, and
the Doctor Leopold, on the other, rather static and uncomfortable in his
wooden chair on the wooden floor.

For all I know, said Jennifer, a vowel change is imminent. It's a way of
avoiding content, making a whole lot of noise. At this point the noise has
become a signifier or trademark of Alan as well. It's as if everything
conspires to guarantee the singularity of one text, written over and over
again, each version equally correct, coherent, well-written, more or less,
but without any sort of advance. Doctor Leopold Konninger, who came to me
in a dream, said, Alan, concurs; I'm obsessed by these texts, I can't stop
the texts, but it's almost as if they stop me.

A quotation from an obscure source, always askew to the point, "They will
come for me, / their faces screened, / mouth-banners high, silk carvings /
in or around the square shrine. / They will come for me, / banners of grey
faces, / dusk-cloths, embrochures of stone / in or around the square
shrine. / Follow the earth's fold, / wary of legs caught in crevices, / in
the air of autumn, / in the autumn air."

He's going to do it again, these stupid stupid voices, these broken limbs,
blind flutterings about the womb. He's going to keep on going, they're
massive, they're useless, they're glued together by a constant intensity,
the repetition of a monologue insistent on building the world from word.
His interest in programming is 'peculiar,' the minor satisfaction of out-
put to some extent not his own - but he short-circuits this by insisting
on writing his own. Everywhere, his own. His tentacles, Jennifer, Julu,
Nikuko, Alan, his own. His blunt texts, his own. Doctor Leopold Konninger
resists any temptation towards either the analytic or the therapeutic, and
Doctor Leopold Konninger has killed.

"When Last We Dashed Across the Fields, To Celebrate Our Savior's Birth"


When last We Dashed across the fields, pulled by One Horse and Hir Sleigh
wHEN LAST wE dASHED ACROSS THE FIELDS, PULLED BY oNE hORSE AND hIR sLEIGH
Urging the Horse on, Screaming against the Wind, all of us Buried in SNow
uRGING THE hORSE ON, sCREAMING AGAINST THE wIND, ALL OF US bURIED IN snOW
And not paying Attention to Whatever the HOT STEED stumbled across 
aND NOT PAYING aTTENTION TO wHATEVER THE hot steed STUMBLED ACROSS 
The SCREAMING OF SLEIGHBELLS, the ragged WHINNY and FROZEN BREATH 
tHE screaming of sleighbells, THE RAGGED whinny AND frozen breath 
To this Day, I cannot imagine Hir LUNGS, the Sleigh half overturned 
tO THIS dAY, i CANNOT IMAGINE hIR lungs, THE sLEIGH HALF OVERTURNED 
In the Rotted fields, the Horse, as if Pursued by Violent Strangers 
iN THE rOTTED FIELDS, THE hORSE, AS IF pURSUED BY vIOLENT sTRANGERS 
The Sleigh filled with drunks in Celebration of the Birthday of God 
tHE sLEIGH FILLED WITH DRUNKS IN cELEBRATION OF THE bIRTHDAY OF gOD 
-- To this Day, I scream now, Fuck God! The horse died because of Hirm 
-- tO THIS dAY, i SCREAM NOW, fUCK gOD! tHE HORSE DIED BECAUSE OF hIM! 
Falling in the Fields through which He was hard compelled to dash: 
fALLING IN THE fIELDS THROUGH WHICH hE WAS HARD COMPELLED TO DASH:

tHAT SUDDENLY THE BREATH hALTS, THE HORSE CRASHES INTO THE SNOW, LEGS
BROKEN, eyes TURNED BACK vIOLENTLY IN THE head, THAT goD CRASHES hIMSELF
DOWN AGAINST THE sWOLLEN BELLY, THAT THE rUNNERS HAVE CUT THROUGH THE
mERRY-mAKERS tORTURED bodies, SKEWED LIMBS lOST IN THE general mayhem.

Bending, - Stooping!, Tlingit, Konninger


"A man at Auk went on the lake after firewood. On the way round it he saw
a woman floating about. Her hair was long. Looking at her for some time,
he saw that her little ones were with her. He took one of the children
home. When it became dark they went to sleep. It was the child of the
L!enAxxidAq, and that night it went through the town picking out people's
eyes. Toward morning a certain woman bore a child. In the morning, when
she was getting up, this [the L!enAxxidAq's child] came in to her into the
house. The small boy had a big belly full of eyes. He had taken out the
eyes of all the people. The woman to whom the small boy came had a cane.
He kept pointing at her eyes. Then she pushed him away with the cane. When
he had done it twice, she pushed it into him. He was all full of eyes.
After she had killed him the woman went through the houses. Then she began
to dress herself up. She took her child up on her back to start wandering.
She said, 'I am going to be the L!enAxxidAq.' When she came down on the
beach she kept eating mussels. She put the shells inside of one another.
As she walks along she nurses her little child."

(Swanton, Tlin- oing beaut iful movi ng maelst rom perso ab Konninger gjen

What have we here. We have a MOTHER and an abducted CHILD who eats eyes. A
second WOMAN may become the MOTHER after killing the CHILD. A second
CHILD, of the woman, completes the transaction, and one must never forget
MUSSELS look like EYES, said Doctor Leopold Konninger. Consider this the
Devolution of NIKUKO, the beautiful Russian ballet dancer, who continues
day and night after night and day to pirouette for him. She flickers in
and out, her pirouettes brilliant coiled energy; it is this energy which
creates the mutations and transformations that fascinate him. Doctor Leo-
pold Konninger imagines Nikuko gathering eyes, bending - stooping! - for
mussels; he is enraptured by the twists and deformations of her tutu as
she steps into the tidal pools of Swanton enAxxidAq mornig enAxxidAq's

( "steps gingerly into the pools, bending, stooping! - stooping! - gath-

sea-water" )

Background / Foreground 


(I sent this out, in a shorter version, to the Writing & Psychology con-
ference on Trace; it's be relevant here as well.)

I was thinking of this first a couple of years ago in relation to objects
and multimedia channels, and then looking at Miekal And's flash work
(which I love) and some of the other URL sites I've posted here - I've
been wondering about the relationship among: 

1. Multimedia OBJECTS, and their protocols, codings, animations/visuals/
audios, etc.;
2. The framework of the SCREEN or page, which holds the OBJECTS; and
3. The embedding of the SCREEN within the apparatus of the COMPUTER and
its input devices (keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera, etc.).

It seems to me that emphasis on the first relates to modernism, in the
sense that the background is assumed neutral or irrelevant, and that the
object itself forecloses on its own interiority; that the second relates
to deconstruction, to the extent that the margins and protocols are fore-
grounded as much as the embedded objects (all of this is presuming that
background is visible and somewhat well-defined); and that the third
relates to postmodernism, to the extent that it is also cyborgian, inter-
ior and exterior simultaneously. In any case, I'd like to see a phenomeno-
logy of this issue (which might be related to, say, Sherry Turkle's or
Brenda Laurel's work), somewhere, sometime. It seems to me that emphasiz-
ing the domain or tenor of a site instead of its components (which are
emphasized especially on those webpages, that, say, ask if you have this
or that plugin) is a way of approaching both experiential issues, and
issues of virtuality which rely on encompassing the spectator and her or
his body, in relation to the coding, the writer, the producer, the artist,
the director, etc.

One might consider levels of interaction, moving from the user's body and
its own foregrounding/backgrounding (see Drew Leder, The Absent Body),
through a phenomenology of the lived environment. Change the focus to the
"digital apparatus" itself (in the sense of the "cinematic apparatus") -
to the increasing diversity of displays. From displays, it is a difficult
step to the internal margins of the visual (and are there parallels in
sound as well?) - and the introjections/projections associated with images
and flash and other multimedia components. (As the case may be, extend
this farther to actively responding joysticks, teledildonic apparatus,
etc.) I would be interested in the ways that such introjection and pro-
jections (what I call "jectivity") operates in internal world-building -
where, in other words, is the user, psychologically, in the midst of all
of this. We know that one can easily inhabit the reduced audio-visual
bandwidth of a MOO or MUD, and even a novel; in multimedia, the singular
experience of reading is broken up by mouse-clicks, attention structures
across the screen, and so forth. How does this heterogeneity function in
terms of worlds? How does one move within these spaces, which can often
appear, as the modernist gallery, as an accumulation of objects against 
presumably "irrelevant" white walls? Does the white background of the
screen function as such a wall? Does a background color create a different
kind of experience altogether? What is the phenomenology of jectivity in
general, across the various sensory modalities?

The point of all of this is both practical - knowledge of the psychologi-
cal processes that are involved in world-building, from both a design and
a user viewpoint - and theoretical - how do we make sense of _any_ world,
foregrounding and background what we ascertain, for ourselves, are objects
within it? How, in other words, _are worlds inscribed?_ Multimedia pro-
vide profound tools for research here; there's always something behind the
holodeck, waiting to be fished out.

Note on forgotten space -

Let us talk about the _forgotten space,_ the space between the object and
the frame, the space neither of containment nor the intensity of edges.
It is this space which shimmers, always present, even if driven to the
suicide of the line as the object fills the frame - it is this space
which is the true screen, never present, an inexplicable absence, were it
to be named. If the dream screen is presumed always to background, this
forgotten space is _neither here nor there,_ but virtual, in the sense of
the virtual particles of the vacuum. Its presence is its annihilation; it
is most likely white or black, perfect absorption, perfection emission. I
place this screen certainly the side of the analytic; it is just as like
ly to exist as a token for the diffused or exhausted, the turbulent. Nei-
ther the matrix out of which the symbolic object arises, nor the symbolic
itself - neither the chorus of indecipherable languages nor the chora it-
self, the forgotten space is always already named, discarded, the origin
of /dev/null to which useless output is ascribed. So to talk about this
space is that which is most natural in the world, since it is the space
of the object's jostling within or among places, spaces, others. One
might say it gives birth to the burden of the proper name, and measurab-
le, it is of no size whatsoever. Before you look at the matrix of media,
look at the forgotten spaces, which make or break inhabitations - and the
more forgotten, the better.

A coupling is defined as (a,b,c); if a -> a', then (a,b,c) -> (a',b,c)
as opposed to a linkage in which if a -> a', then (a,b,c) -> (a',b',c').
In forgotten space, objects are combined as couplings or concatenations
without an intrinsic linking. Forgotten space is neither matrix nor con-
tainer/chora; it is the of-jostling, nothing more nor less. Think of the
spacings of multimedia objects.

A coupling in this regard may be considered a generated perceptual group-
ing of relatively well-defined objects. An object is defined as a rupture
or insertion into forgotten space. An object is also a skein of bits and
bytes, ranging from the performative to static files. The former is al-
ways triply encoded; the latter, more often than not doubly encoded. Text-
ual insertions into forgotten space (i.e. ascii text) activate the space, 
i.e. it becomes gotten space, the sheet of assertion or subtextual matrix
of structure 'holding' the ascii in place. Movement in dhtml across for-
gotten space is in relation to the screen or object boundaries; the space
itself carries no distinction.

Or perhaps the space, like the phallic masquerade itself, assume identi-
ties, forgetfulness taking on the characteristics of the current diegetic
in relation to the viewer's dialogic - in which case, one might well turn
away in disgust, there's no hope for it. Still, I wouldn't call it a space
of potential, it's there, forgotten, stillborn in relation to the objects
contained - in fact, it's charted, mobilized, for their location in terms
of window percentage (30% vertical say) or pixels (400 horizontal say).

The charting is for them; they're tracked across the forgotten space. Any
landmark is charted as well; there is the forgotten space, and the chart-
ing of the landmarks. And there is nothing else, the forgotten space hard-
ly nomadic, on the verge of presence, neither shifting nor present.

The image is of the gotten space, always of such. Everything is coupled
within the image.

the tourmalines of dreams murmur, deeper reams

Accidental


I have seen several violent accidents in my life; today was another, an
older woman struck by a car at high speed, bounced about on the hood; the 
car coming to a fast halt, the woman sliding down the road. I spoke to 
the driver, directed traffic, others called ambulance, police, and fire
department, all of which took far too long to arrive. Thinking the inci-
dent through, beyond the obvious warnings about pedestrians and traffic, 
I realized the following -

First, there is a moment when _the anomaly of the accident is simply in-
visible_ - I saw a bundle bouncing on the hood, violently, heard odd
screams like mourning doves' 'wooo wooo wooo' (I still don't know where
these originated) - and I _could not recognize anything._ I was far from
thinking _accident._ Once I filmed a ball of fire rolling down a road, not
realizing it was a smashed car with three people burning alive in it. I
filmed it as an event, an ecstatic meteor, and nothing whatsoever of the
content occurred to me. (This is of course based on the assumption that
the content is the burning bodies.) In all of these cases, there is a mo-
mentary fascination with _reality gone awry,_ as if the comedic had sud-
denly come to life out of nowhere. Oddly, my mind has never gone in search
of film or television media and their car crashes, real or fictional; the
inertness of the real, instead, asserts itself, the mind trying desperate-
ly to find a place for the event. Scripts and tags tend to fall apart fast
under such circumstances; it takes a mode of circumvention, circumambula-
tion, to produce the _accident_ tag that brings everything crashing in or
down as the inertia of the world in relation to organism. (See below.)

Second, there is a wave of vertigo and nausea (slight or pronounced - when
I saw the family lying in pieces in body bags on Flatbush, it was the lat-
ter; today, the former), as in 'virtual reality sickness' - things no
longer add up, and the accident filters the real into the abject (as the
body or bodies have both intrinsic and extrinsic boundaries broken), as if
any witnessed violence involved a degree of _veering._ This transforms in-
to a general shakiness, trembling; I am still extremely nervous now, a
good hour and a half later.

Third, there is a _community bound by injury or death, circumscribed by
the accident,_ of onlookers, many of whom assume formal and traditional
roles of counsel, warning, calling for help. In this case, the driver of
the car that struck the woman was most concerned that he be not to blame,
and I aided him by walking him over to a bus driver (beginning to leave
with his passengers) who saw the whole thing and blamed another vehicle;
they exchanged names and information before the bus drove off. I then
spoke with another MTA woman who blamed the car driver after all, and had
seen the whole thing. I stopped traffic for the police; I counseled the
woman, like numerous others, to lie still, I spoke with the driver of the
car.

Fourth, one may consider the leaving of the bus part and parcel of the ac-
cident _vectors,_ all after the fact, which includes the formation of the
community of onlookers slowly dispersing, the arrival and departure of
ambulance, firetruck, police vehicles, others involved in the regulation
and salvation of the city matrix. One might think of these gatherings and
releases as the sudden formation of a standing-wave, fed by the external
energy of the anomaly, then just as quickly dispersing after the nodes,
the bodies and cars, are removed.

And the virtual? All indications are that we live generally in the virtu-
al, that our perceptions of the real are autonomic at best. It takes a
large anomaly to challenge us, illustrate the internal drives that guide
us through the day as if we were conscious. The restoration of equilibrium
- nausea slowly ending, nervousness subsiding - takes a great deal of
time, as, for several hours, one has the distinct feeling that _reality
can no longer be trusted._ The mind can't think this way for too long,
however, and sooner or later, we're coasting, we're coasting ...

Equipment


The old Sony professional cassette machine mutates with the AIWA DAT rec-
order to produce our music. We will record on our two Sony Hi8 camcorders,
sleep(1); what we have to say and write. Azures and Alans will appear
there and with two Quickcams connected to Compaq laptops and desktops, the
latter with print "Are you satisfied with your $name?\\n"; Sony monitor.
We will use a 360 degree lens on the Panasonic video cameras at the Exper-
imental Television Center, within which Foofwa d'Imobilite chop($answer=
<STDIN>); will capture the spherical glare. Note: Do tell him we have
picked up RCA and Sony 3/4" tapes for the Sony 3/4" machines, so there is
no need to if ($answer eq "no") {print "You're violated with $a[10+$pre]!-
\\n";} purchase more and newer, since these are one-pass. We will take the
Casio digital camera and Pentax 35mm camera as well, and will give Mark
our NCR if ($answer eq "yes") {print "A $a[10+$pre] and $a[15+$pre] night-
mare!\\n";} laptop and possibly get a lens or camera from him. A polished
fog filter is extraordinary production. A Psion 3a will be useful for
note-taking as print "Your gully mined, burying you and Azure.", "\\n\\n"
if 3 < $g; Foofwa imitates the impeccable Nikuko, the beautiful Russian
ballet dancer and we can hardly wait to see it. We will use the Paik Wob-
bulator to make print "$name $pid is the fate of corpses.", "\\n\\n" if
3==$g; him shake so and we will produce music on Mirage sampler keyboard,
shakuhachi, and Fender Cyclone guitar with Marshall amplifier and effects
boxes. print "... $a[$non] $name $$ - don't tell me different.", "\\n\\n"
if 6==$g; Add-on telephoto and wide-angle lenses will create the percep-
tion of closer and farther Azures and Alans in relation to Foofwa d'Imobi-
lite print "Your $name $diff flesh is your tomb", "\\n\\n" if 4==$g; dan-
cing his heart away, as if judged by Doctor Leopold Konninger, comparing
everything and everyone to Nikuko, the beautiful Russian ballet dancer.  
print "You fucked for $time hours?", "\\n" if 2==$g; New strings are ready
for the Fender Cyclone guitar, especially the highest thin string, which
breaks so readily under the speedy fingers of the sleep(1); Alans. A Zip
drive and cables will provide backup for everything, and even new images
of everyone having a good and perfectly artistic time. A Sony print "$name
and $$ and $pid - Azure is still alive!", "\\n\\n" if 2==$g; shortwave ra-
dio provides International Background! We will bring many texts to read
and there will be new things in Alans' brains waiting to sleep(1); come
out. Alans will bring three Linux floppy disks for pocket Linux to run on
PC desktops and DAT tapes and Hi8 tapes and S-cables and other print
"Wait! $name and $pid are fucked.", "\\n\\n" if 1==$g; chords. Alans and
Azures will bring their beautiful selves to Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Kon-
ninger, Nikuko's last name is Daishin, Daishin Nikuko, FINAL: and Foofwa
d'Imobilite will be there in immanent creation of perfect form.

P:: for this is the furthermost point of my advance, through and into your
time, the time of this mailing, before i return to the tenth century. oh,
it has always been assumed that time travel goes from present to past,
present to future, and return again, but i am writing to inform you that
there are those of us who prefer living in the past, and on occasion
venturing to a future already past for those living in the present: this
is the safest existence possible, and i am breaking our tradition by
informing you, here, and now, of this exigency. for we live safely in a
world still populated by numerous plants and animals you have driven to
extinction, not to mention numerous ethnic groups which you have violated,
eliminated, torn from their native lands, destroyed in every conceivable
fashion. our world is still whole, and as long as we move back and forth
within it, never venturing beyond, let us say, the date and time of this
missive itself, we shall be ensured of permanent domicile, even with the
threat of your nuclear war bringing everything to a halt. P:: in the
meantime, what is it i wish to say to you? nothing, but a greeting; there
is no way to respond, no place of residence within which you may find me.
or rather, you might trace one or another life across cities, nations,
continents; such a life may or may not cross my own, but at least, if you
return to the tenth century, you will be far closer than you are at this
very moment. perhaps if i told you my name? it would mean nothing to you
of course, although you may call me saki. of course there are many such,
and there is no guarantee that this word is properly transliterated, and
among us, transliteration is all that exists. so you may think of me as
this text, ignoring the consciousness from the past, roaming among lands
and centuries, that has produced it. nonetheless, i do call the tenth
century my home; i have so many friends there, and the comforting ring of
familiarity continues eternally. P:: of course you may, there is always a
kindness in that.

Tale


Two [shinto] priests were walking down a steep hill; they met a [budd-
hist] monk walking up. "Where are you going?" one of the priests asked.
"It is near the end of the world," said the monk, "and I am going to the
top of the hill to observe." "Don't you know," said one of the priests,
"it is the same everywhere?" "But not to the hill," answered the monk.
When I was telling this story, the rabbi [jewish] asked, "But why were
there two priests?" "Because, I answered, one of them might have for-
gotten the script." The rabbi answered, "But the world is the script."
And I replied, "If the world is the script, it is the hill which is
writing and the priests who are reading." The rabbi said, "But it is the
monk who guides the pen." A [protestant] minister, happening by, gave his
ear to the tale. He said, "The hill has given the pen to the tale." I
answered, "But it is christ himself who has given the hill, who has as-
cended the hill as the holy mount, to preach to one and all." The monk
said, "By what authority do you speak? For you seem to be jewish by cul-
ture, if not religion, and hardly catholic, to speak of the christ." I
answered, "It is my belief that christ is within all of us, that we are
all our sons." The monk said, "Thus we repeatedly give birth to ourselves
over and over again, generation upon generation," to which one of the
priests replied, "Yes, but it is the latter that speaks to the former,
since the latter carries the wisdom of the former." The minister said,
"It is upon such that the gospel was written." I answered, "It is upon
such that everything is written, from the beginning to the end of the
word." The rabbi answered, "Thus is the word made world," and the monk
said, "And thus the catholic, the word made flesh. For what is the flesh
of the word?" One of the priests said, "To be cleansed and purified, for
the circumspection of the living." I added, "Thus for the circumspection
of the dead," and the monk replied, "From here throughout our ministra-
tions." The rabbi said, "For who is to be believed, properly speaking,
but the holy script itself?" A nearby jainist answered, "In relation to
the fecundity of the earth, to which we should give as little pain as
possible." The monk replied, "What is universal has no recourse among the
individual." The rabbi agreed, saying, "And who is among the enlight-
ened?" I replied, "Those who know the value of this, not that - and that,
not this." "Exactly," cried the monk. The minister, perplexed, ended the
session by stating that suffering and enlightenment are both in the hands
of god, to whom we give thanks. The priests nodded in assent.

My Teeth in Nikuko's Pirouettes


<Jennifer> My teeth take your tricks, turn them inside-out.
<Julu> I want to make bridges among beautiful people and everything in
the world.                                                              
<Jennifer> I wake up in the middle of the night and *sob* and I think,
I think to myself: We have been abandoned.
<Julu> Whatever is said, nothing matters, our words splinter our teeth.
<Alan> Do you want to play cards?
<Julu> No thanks.
<Jennifer> It's hard to concentrate; I keep thinking about returning.
<Jennifer> *sob*
<Alan> It's the frozen state of things; think of us as subjects, Nikuko
and Doctor Leopold Konninger as objects.
<Jennifer> They are subjects without objects, and we are subjects with
objects elsewhere, fully described, out of touch.
<Julu> As long as Nikuko remains the beautiful Russian ballet dancer,
doing amazing pirouettes, one after another, before the obsequious
Konninger.
<Jennifer> He would do anything for her...
<Alan> They were released into phase space; there's nothing we can do;
until Nikuko and Konninger decide otherwise, she'll keep rotating.
There's not even a question of nourishment or dizziness. She's an
operator, garnering degrees of motion.
<Jennifer> She's wrapping the whole universe around her.
<Julu> She'll pull it in.
<Jennifer> She'll pull it in like a woven garment, binding her tutu to
her fragile body. The universe will stream across the surface of her
flesh, tighter and tighter.
<Julu> Only the universe will feel it.
<Jennifer> The universe will feel nothing, nor will its inhabitants,
particles and planets, stars and quasars, galactic clusters...
<Alan> It will be the same as ever.
<Julu> It will be identical to itself.
<Jennifer> And yet...
<Julu> The universe will be winding and winding as Nikuko pirouettes.
<Alan> Much to the delight of Doctor Leopold Konninger.
<Jennifer> So we will wait, in dreams of the imaginary, in the imaginary
of dreams.
<Julu> We will wait forever and a day, it is all the same to us.
<Alan> *laughing* Because Jennifer has all the time in the world.
<Jennifer> *sob* And nothing to do with it.
<Julu> Nothing at all.
<Alan> For there's nothing to be done.
<Jennifer> And no One to do it.
<Alan> I'll say amen to that.
<Julu> I'll say amen to all of us.

You danced for 262255 hours?
No no no, it was longer and shorter, 
No no no, i don't remember
and my dissolutions are those moments of re-entry, when i find myself on
mother earth father moon, when i find myself dreaming of doctor leopold
konninger, my eyes fixed on his solar visage, my dancing perfect and
continuous and 1021 and 1047 - Nikuko is still alive!
Use of uninitialized value at ./.julu line 130, <STDIN> chunk 8.
For 4 months of dissolution, we have been and buried
and it has taken us 3.000 minutes to speak our very last ...

and my dissolutions are those moments of re-entry, when i find myself on
mother earth father moon, when i find myself dreaming of doctor leopold
konninger, my eyes fixed on his solar visage, my dancing perfect and
continuous; the universe is my traditional object, the universe is my
breathing in and breathing out, space is inhabiting me; i am Nikuko the
beautiful russian ballet dancer who is winding the universe around her 
as she pirouettes for doctor leopold konninger; i alone recognize the
confused topologies of embedded space-time around my waist and breasts 
and thighs, my tutu enmeshed in nebulae and stars; oh ballet, o ballet,
hanged_man with hours of sexual fury!

<Julu> As long as Nikuko remains the beautiful Russian ballet dancer,
she'll pull it in.
<Julu> Only the universe will feel it.
<Julu> It will be identical to itself.
<Julu> The universe will be winding and winding as Nikuko pirouettes.
<Julu> We will wait forever and a day, it is all the same to us.
<Julu> Nothing at all.
<Julu> No thanks.
<Julu> I'll say amen to all of us.
<Jennifer> My teeth take your tricks, turn them inside-out.
<Jennifer> I wake up in the middle of the night and *sob* and I think.
<Jennifer> It's hard to concentrate.
<Jennifer> *sob*
<Jennifer> She's wrapping the whole universe around her.
<Jennifer> She'll pull it in like a woven garment.
<Jennifer> The universe will feel nothing.
<Jennifer> And yet...
<Jennifer> *sob* nothing to do with it.
<Alan> I do want to thank you for this display of wonder.
<Alan> In the morning, after stars are stretched to the limit.
<Alan> The universe nestled among the folds of organdie.
<Alan> *sob*
