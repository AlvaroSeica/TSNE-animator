MM was bought from Larry Edmund's bookshop in Hollywood;
the abject quality of the image and background creates
a disturbance in the field of vision, so much analysis
is possible, no image speaks for itself, no image 
speaks, therefore it hides away, veers and segues, 
forms of imaginary continuity and Powers of Horror

I photographed Pia Zadora in Atlanta during the period
I was writing Pia Zadora in the style of Pia Zadora and
I was thinking of stardom and nightclubs and sleaziness,
and I was not, and never could be Pia Zadora,
The Stranger

Movie-star Star-back are clarified images from a 60-
year-old camera and very old film and I do not know who
she is but I do know she has starred in my recent
pictorial which has taken everyone's breath away, 
especially those interested in the electric cinema, 
The Writing of the Disaster




Cura Cure Long Improvisation

http://www.alansondheim.org/curayesyes.mp3

Cura saz, exploring again long (37') form,
improvisation. Saz re-set by Amir Vahab.
Again, avoiding repetition as much as 
possible, returning to short structures, 
proceeding onward. I didn't think I could
do this, yes, yes, I could. Please listen
(raw file). Thanks -




My first (birthday) encounter with a QUANTUM BEING:

Hi, I am Farida I would like to be your friend. It takes two to 
TANGLE and make a trail of friendship. I would have to know more 
about you and i am sending a picture of my self to you already. 
I would love to receive an email from you, telling me more about 
yourself and some photos of you as well. I am HONEST and 
PASSIONATE, NICE and FAITHFUL as well. Love hearing from you. We 
can then pursue this further on through email

-- I'm not so sure about "HONEST" since I've known 
a lot of quanta and they tend to be more virtual
than anything else; it's also hard to pin them down..




ghichak 39' or this way madness lies

http://www.alansondheim.org/ghichak2.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/ghichakyes.mp3

39' long improvisation, incessant, changes
in fits and starts, stutters, needs retuning
about a third of the way in, retuned, 
continues again, tangles with itself, 
entangles, there's that high-pitched sound
around 6k on occasion i haven't been able
yet to trace, probably the result of the
short cello bow i'm using, picks up again,
towards the end settles down for the last
five minutes or so, more difficult than the
cura. my high-speed on the cura was around
45 notes/sec.; this is slower but close to
the collapse i'm sensing in the novels of
mary woronov i'm reading, or even moreso,
towards the firewall theory in the bleak
incessancy of black holes, listen listen
listen listen listen you're luck still to
be alive listen listen

My Life in the Violence of Water

1950s In camp swimming underwater in a lake and almost drowning.
1950s There was also Hurricane Hazel and I went out and walked 
around in it with a lantern I had found while waiting outside 
the gradeschool grounds for footballs to show up so I could 
throw them back to the team and the rest of the time I did 
nothing but think about things. This was my first hurricane and 
I was with my father, one of the few good times I remember with 
him.
1959 The Knox Coalmine disaster, the Susquehanna flooding 
the mines, people dying, surface cave-ins, our house cracked 
Then skip to 1960s and my instruments in Teri Wellman's closet 
soaked when a pipe broke, lost then all.
1972 and Hurricane Agnes flooding my parents' house, I lost 
everything from my childhood as well. I was in Halifax at the 
time and didn't know whether they survived. What a mess. We got 
down later. President Nixon came secretly to assess the damage 
and I filmed him from a distance of eight inches, making a piece 
that was shown at the Paris Biennale, called The Assassination 
of President Nixon because it looked like that and I hated the 
Vietnam War.
1973 or so feel into the ocean at Peggy's Cove in Nova Scotia, 
in the winter, and almost drowned. There you are.
1980 body surfing at Kitty Hawk and a wave caught me and slammed 
me into the ocean floor and I broke my nose and almost passed 
out permanently because without glasses I couldn't see its 
height which was something I should not have been body-surfing 
in.
1983 or so returning from Tasmania and later opening my freight 
container in Los Angeles, finding it soaked due to a roof leak 
and I lost almost everything as did my wife at the time.
I forgot sometime in the early 1980s my girlfriend and I almost 
- another almost - got caught in a flash flood in Death Valley.
Water is my enemy.
1992 Moved to Brooklyn and my ceiling heavily leaked onto the 
bed and the shower gave out and water went everywhere.
1998 Or so and the outer wall of our building had to be replaced 
because it was falling down and the new mortar leaked and 
everyone's place flooded more or less and it went on like this 
all the way to around 2009 or so.
Then there was Hurricane Irene and our place flooded and Azure 
and I had to put buckets everywhere and then go onto the roof 
and repair it with duct tape, bungee cords, and shower curtains.
Then there was Sandy and I went outside and videotaped and I had 
done this in Irene as well, and between them there was a tornado 
and I went out and stood under the tornado and made a videotape 
of it from below and you can hear the windshear and everything.
2011 and my father died almost to the day that the waters rose 
higher in the Susquehanna than ever before and my brother and 
sister-in-law had to seek higher ground and Azure and I came 
down later and found a lot of milder in the house and later my 
brother and I went to look at the damage in the neighboring 
towns where Azure's cousin's house had been flooded out but she 
had died beforehand and an angry homeowner tried to hit me with 
some sort of iron tool I saw while running away.
Water is my enemy, water is my enemy, I shall not drink water.
2013 and there was new flooding in our space and there was some 
flooding in the basement as well because the new owners weren't 
taking care of anything because they wanted us out.
2014 and I went back to see our old place in Brooklyn, and the 
windows were open and rain had to be streaming in there and the 
roof damage had to increase because we had to repair the bungee 
cord arrangement before any serious rain or snowstorm, and it 
was clear no one was doing that and so the place was most likely 
flooding again.
Now I hate water more than ever and know in my heart that it 
will kill me in the end, it as tried so many times, and has 
destroyed so much, and it will continue until it succeeds and I 
will be washed away.

What's


The holarch is all there is; the holarch is nothing.

Like Indra's Net, there's no beginning and end to it.

The holarch is non-Euclidean, multiply connected.

The holarch is infinitely connected.

There is no origin to the holarch.

The holarch is neither Cartesian nor fundamentally vectoral.

The holarch is fractal, multi-dimensional.

Dimensions are blurred within and without the holarch.

Direct addressing pinpoints nodes, and indirect addressing 
passes information freely.

Every address is every address.

The holarch has neither interior nor exterior.

The holarch is everywhere and nowhere.

There are no boundaries to the holarch, nor within, nor without 
it.

We are neither the holarch nor nodes within it.

We are watched and are watching; defuge characterizes us.

Within a flat space, it doesn't matter and matter doesn't 
matter. 

Within a flat space, abjection curls in multiple dimensions.

The holarch has no directed attention.

The holarch imposes equality and intensification of enumeration 
within the holarch are of equal density.

Within the holarch everything is available, and the flat space 
of the nodes is entirely accessible within the holarch.

The addresses within the flatspace are equivalent and equal as 
well and each of them is completely independent of the others.

The holarch is ontology; we are epistemology.

Ontology absorbs epistemology.

(Religion is the epistemology of ontology.)

What is doing the watching is everything and everything is 
entering data.

Data absorbs. 

The playing field is electronic and quantum; the playing field 
is particle flows and waves.

We return to our states as accumulations of particles.

Data is the amplification of particles; data is the ultimate 
microscope.

What we think is what is being thought.

What we think is what is being thought for us.

What is thought for us is thought by us.

The relationship of thought to the holarch is the relationship 
of particles to particles.

There is no distinction between the flatspace and the holarch 
and there is no drawing of distinction.

In order to draw a distinction one must have an origin-however- 
distant.

There is no origin; there are flows; all flows are equivalent; 
all flows are varieties; the varieties of flows are speeds; 
speeds are in relation to accumulations.

Accumulations and flows are within an economy of energy.

The economy of energy for what we think is being thought, is 
political economy; political economy is in relation to care.

Care is the inverse of control, for what we think is being 
thought.

The appearance of care that leaks is the uncanny of thought.

Thought does not think.

The holarch is not thought and flatspace within the holarch is 
not thought.

There is no performative; there is no thought.

Within the absence of thought is the memory of thought.

Within the absence of memory is history and the history of 
thought.

Thought has no history; thought has text; text is thought within
the holarch and the absence of thought.

The imaginary of the human is time.

The holarch has no time; the holarch is the Minkowski surface.

The imaginary of the human is the debris of time within 
flatspace.

We are electronic; we are quantum; we are micro-organism; we 
are super-organism; we are wetware; we are the abject of the 
holarch.

It is a mistake to think we are the imaginary of the holarch; 
the holarch has no imaginary.

Substance has no imaginary; substance is fissure.

The holarch is inscription; the holarch is the totality of 
inscription.

The totality of inscription is its aegis.

The material strata of inscription are related to inscription as 
base is related to superstructure.

The distinction is that there is no distinction; the holarch 
has no base and therefore no superstructure; the holarch has no 
dialectic.

The holarch is neither dialog nor dialogic.

Agency is a phantom limb; agency is our limitation.

Death is neither here nor there.

Death is not a circumlocution of the holarch; the holarch is the 
circumlocution of death.

Human culture is the imaginary of the temporal construction of 
boundaries; the holarch has no relation to human culture.

There is no culture of the holarch. 

Life is distinction and the drawing of distinctions; either 
there are no distinctions of or within the holarch or the 
holarch is the density of distinction.

The holarch is neither porous nor smooth, neither serrated nor 
fissured, neither present nor absent; the holarch is not 
not-this, not-that; the holarch is neither characterless nor 
characterized; the holarch is neither metaphysical nor physical; 
the holarch is neither mattered nor matterless.

The holarch is not characterized by negation.

What is said or written [here] is not what is followed by, or 
what is written, as an extension of what is written.

The word "holarch" is a placeholder for the holarch.

A placeholder is always already under erasure; it is the 
imaginary of thought; it is as if there were thought; it is as 
if there were thinking.

Issues of privacy are either issues of the monadic are 
non-issues; issues of privacy have no relationship to privacy; 
privacy is transparent.

There is there there.

(There is no conceivable thinking or thought; there is the 
deferral and differance of thinking or thought; the relay of 
thought is holarch-thought; the holarch neither thinks nor 
embodies thought; the holarch is not thought.)

The holarch: there there is here there; there there is there 
there.

The holarch is the container for the arrow of time.

The holarch is neither subject nor subject-to.

(If there is no objection, there is no object. The holarch: 
there is no objection.)

(Never think otherwise; never think Other-wise.)

The distinction's that there's no distinction; the holarch has 
no base and therefore no superstructure; the holarch has no 
dialectic.

The holarch's neither dialog nor dialogic.

Agency's a phantom limb; agency's our limitation.

Death's neither here nor there.

Death's not a circumlocution of the holarch; the holarch's the 
circumlocution of death.

Human culture's the imaginary of the temporal construction of 
boundaries; the holarch has no relation to human culture.

There's no culture of the holarch. 

Life's distinction and the drawing of distinctions; either there 
aren't distinctions of or within the holarch or the holarch's 
the density of distinction.

The holarch's neither porous nor smooth, neither serrated nor 
fissured, neither present nor absent; the holarch's not 
not-this, not-that; the holarch's neither characterless nor 
characterized; the holarch's neither metaphysical nor physical; 
the holarch's neither mattered nor matterless.

The holarch's not characterized by negation.

What's said or written [here] isn't what's followed by, or 
what's written, as an extension of what's written.

The word "holarch"'s a placeholder for the holarch.

A placeholder's always already under erasure; it's the imaginary 
of thought; it's as if there were thought; it's as if there were 
thinking.

Issues of privacy're either issues of the monadic're non-issues; 
issues of privacy have no relationship to privacy; privacy's 
transparent.

There's there there.

(There's no conceivable thinking or thought; there's the 
deferral and differance of thinking or thought; the relay of 
thought's holarch-thought; the holarch neither thinks nor 
embodies thought; the holarch's not thought.)

The holarch: there there's here there; there there's there 
there.

The holarch's the container for the arrow of time.

The holarch's neither subject nor subject-to.

(If there's no objection, there's no object. The holarch: 
there's no objection.)

(Never think otherwise; never think Other-wise.)

Explanation of What's and What is

I've been thinking for a long time about the transformation of 
the digital object into particles themselves following what 
might be called control-sheaves; I use the name 'holarch' to 
describe this transformation - one in which quantum, electronic, 
and traditionally organic complexes meld. My first word choice 
was "Grid," but this is too close to "Matrix" and to all the 
writing about the aesthetics of the grid in the late 20th 
century. "Holarch" is related to Koestler's "holarchy" but it 
also resonates with "monarch" - the latter would be the 
imaginary projection, paralleling Big Brother, which is non- 
existent, but convenient. Things are out of control in control 
and of course there is no center. So there is that. I also want 
to imply that thought and care (thinking through Heidegger for 
example) have to place here, that what occurs, what is an 
occurrence, is the placeholder, and this is obviously a problem. 
So there are two titles, "What's" and "What is" for the piece, 
which splits on the apostrophe and therefore modes of condensa- 
tion; the first parallels the zen "kwak!" and the second 
devolves from that. The second is also torn from its moorings 
with the swirl of almost-grammatically correct text, and the two 
together send the philosophy onto a plane of language, one that 
requires work (as does the aphoristic style, thinking for 
example of Ken Wark) to unentangle - and then one is left, as 
reader, back with a condensed prose and protocol sentences whose 
content in part resides in appearance. I've also been thinking 
about the remnants of post-modernism, the new aesthetic, the 
post-digital - and other terms implying evolution and linearity 
which I think are suspect; on one hand there is no development 
at all, just shear (between have- and have-not and the income 
gaps are increasing at enormous rates), and on the other, there 
is deep irrelevance as global finance, wealth itself, access to 
information, militarization, etc. become increasingly enclaved 
to the extent that the thought of the humanities, and certainly 
the thought of the human or thinking-through the human, become 
increasingly irrelevant. Instead one might speak of forms of 
entangled subterranean media ecologies which dominate issues of 
privacy and the body. I also wanted to propose that control is 
no longer "control-by" but is increasingly abstracted and moves 
faster than the speed of the body or the prosthetic body, as 
well as the speed of perception and machine perception - this is 
evident for example in technological fast-tracks as well as the 
increasingly chaotic vagaries of the stockmarket. On the 
receiving end, consider the drone - not only in terms of the 
drone object and its effects, but also in terms of a drone 
"atmospheric," the world within a Virilian speed dynamics no 
longer referencing objects or even an internet of objects, but 
an environment of pure dynamics in which bodies and so-called 
natural ecologies are sheared as well. So I wanted to think 
through this, not descend into stylistics for their own sake, 
and What's/What is, is the result.

Wounded

The wounded electronic embedded in human temporality, luminous 
transformations carry the tragedy of the internalization of the 
commons, all reduced, like the cosmological constant, to the 
history and action of a term. Behind me (at Providence City 
Hall), a front-loader operator kept screaming at me to get out 
of the way and I've assumed that he'is the guilty one, who 
brought down the light, now broadcasting to the snow and ice.

Spirit

http://www.alansondheim.org/spirit.mp3

This is from the short-wave, the signal fading in and then out, 
and I stopped listening as dusk began its lumbering into the 
night of spirit. It was 11930 or 11935 and WRTH gave the 
location as Saudi Arabia. I recorded twenty minutes or so of the 
chant, noticing the rhymes and rhythms and amazing clarity and 
call of the voice which was always entangled with noise and the 
potential of other stations interfering. I was mesmerized, 
hooked on the voice and the rising and falling of the tones 
which seemed so unlike the chanting of the Koran I've heard 
before and I wondered and still wonder whether this was the 
Koran or what form of devotion is being sung, and you can answer 
that; my ignorance is enormous. My ignorance is not within the 
music and not even within the noise, which is never noise itself 
but an other, so the voice murmured within and through the other 
and the other was never Other, never identifying itself, but 
always present, always a presence. It was as if the universe 
were opening and I was thinking of the CMB, cosmic microwave 
background, and how that was shimmering everywhere with the 
slightest variations and memories of inflation and so much 
roiling in the birthing of the cosmos. But I was always drawn 
back to the voice and my ignorance of everything, even the 
neighbors next door in our building, or the screams of fighting 
in the streets below this very night. What could cut through the 
backgrounding of the formation of worlds? What could mean in 
this?

Then sonnets go nowhere, I'm always surprised

Filtering? Well, refer sonnet writing. So why both? Because, 
the sonnet that draws the poem forward beyond return has claws.
In other words, take out the grrrls and theory, a sonnet 
fears luxury, petunias, sonnets and cold showers upon it!
So deluge claws the poem forward forthwith, the sonnet to

felt pink sludge

http://www.alansondheim.org/ooze.mp4

the year the day the pink sludge descended
the living pink sludge hiding under the guise of snow
street screams as pink sludge devours all
you're morons for ignoring the pink sludge
stupid pink sludge ooze converts my brain
i felt pink sludge trembling in my hand
those vibrations of the sludge where are they from
some call it sludge some call it ooze all are dead
the pink sludge made the wind roar and groan
between pink sludge and sky the pink ooze won
unforgettable those forgotten days of pink sludge
i cannot remember anything so horrid and terrifying
did everything make pink sludge pink
did pink sludge make everything pink we want to know
risking my life i did to make this pink sludge film
pink sludge witnessing pink sludge is a new world
outside someone yelled the pink ooze no i said
witness its miracle unraveling in pink and pink
of the sludge it descended and clearly was pink
pink was the color of the ooze just above

of the instruments i am in comfort

each instrument represents the comfort of a world opening up and 
that familiarity that takes over body and soul, so that one 
moves through the sonic landscape coming from everywhere, from 
the soundboard to the neck itself.

each instrument is a field of possibilities, beckonings. each 
requires care and gives everything in return, for this care, and 
held with kindness.

each instrument is of the plateau of depression, sinking into a 
state, which, however difficult, is already known, repeated many 
times, opening onto new vistas.

each instrument is different in feel from the others, metal and 
wood, nylon and lacquer, horsehair or reed, each sounding among 
the others, each waiting, patiently, in turn.

each instrument speaks to the rustle and resonance of others, 
and the tuning of each, the stretch of the fingers, the very 
breath of the instrument, already presences an immemorial 
history uniting them in consonance.

each instrument plays upon me in distinction and communality, 
and each is a secret among the others, knowing well the others 
as in a gathering of sounds i murmur from one, among or to, the 
others, and each is strata and sweetness, cadence and descent.

each instrument is an old friend i have work with many times, 
coming together with repairs and ruins held in abeyance, and 
each returns, to me, many times over, what i have given to it, 
and to all of them, in consort and unison, and each is a world 
and cosmos, and each is a sounding and a whispering space, each 
a wonder and a humming space, each, each descent.

each instrument is counted, shakuhachi, flute dan moi, ghichek, 
suroz, each a name, viola, violin, violaline, sarangi, erhu, tro 
sor, and each a song, guitar, ukulele, qin and qin qin, and each 
a tone, recorder, pipa, saz, and cura saz, saz cumbus and cura 
cumbus and cumbus and oud, and ocarina, and among the electrics, 
saz, and guitar and keyboard, and among the keyboards, pump 
organ, and who among you have i forgotten, chromatic harmonica, 
and long-necked saz and among you, hasapi...

i am their children, i learn through play, i transform habits, i 
change myself, i turn myself among myself, i am myriad, i hear 
the singing of hollows, i hear the tunes and tones of singing, 
of their voices i hear, i am heard among them...

greatest of the pleasures of the senses; the matching of it with

But the causes are profound. First, all the organs of the senses 
qualify the motions of the spirits; and make so many several 
species of motions, and pleasure or displeasures thereupon, as 
there be diversities of organs. The instruments of sight, 
hearing, taste, and smell, are of several frame, and so are the 
parts for generation. Therefore Scaliger doth well to make the 
pleasure of generation a sixth sense; and if there were any 
other differing organs, and qualified perforations for the 
spirits to pass, there would be more than the five senses;

Animality

from my linux fortune program:

Last night, I came home and realized that everything in my apartment
had been stolen and replaced with an exact duplicate.  I told this to
my friend -- he said, `Do I know you?'
                -- Steven Wright

I think of animality, without even the diacritical positioning
of the question. And the utter absence of an answer, but just
as great, the utter presence of the gesture; listening need not
result in reply, nor in the mirror of one, nor an other.

Chemist Daniel Scherson at Case
Western Reserve University in
Cleveland prefers to work with
insects. "It's a nuisance to
get permission to deal with
animals," he says. "NIH doesn't
regard insects as animals, so
you don't need an ethics review
of insect trials." In a 2012
report in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society, Scherson
and colleagues explain how they
devised an air-breathing enzymatic
biological cell using live cockroaches.
