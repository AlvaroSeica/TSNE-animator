Note on Hsun Tzu


"By saying, 'There are no names necessarily appropriate of themselves,' 
Hsun Tzu means that at the time when names were first invented, a certain 
name was used to indicate a certain thing according to the free will of 
those who made these designations. For example, men agreed with one 
another that they would call a dog by the word 'dog,' yet at the beginning 
they might just as conceivably have agreed upon the word 'horse' to 
designate it. When these designations had once been agreed upon, however, 
so that people used a certain name to indicate only that certain thing, 
this became customary. Thereupon names and the things they designated had 
their necessary appropriateness, one to the other, and could no longer be 
changed at pleasure. Even when the names were first being made, however, 
at the time when 'there were no names necessarily appropriate of 
themselves,' there were nevertheless some that were 'especially 
felicitous.' Names which could be readily pronounced, for example, would 
be more felicitous than difficult sounding names." (from A History of 
Chinese Philosophy, Fung Yu-Lan, 1952) - Saussure two millennia early.
But what is missing is the institutionalization of names - for example, 
who or what declares the 'Axis of Evil'? The distortion of names is the 
reification of an empathetic magic in which earlier designations resonate 
with later; the result is a population, ourselves, unsure of any meaning 
whatsoever, or even if meaning is ever applicable - perhaps it is nothing 
more than an operator, a function ...

Time-Date-Stamp

Wednesday, February 13, 4:15, 2003I need everything; I need an end to
this.I need nothing; I need a beginning to This.Somewhere when i am worn
out and have nothing left to lose, i call on my lover, and she comes;
there is smoke in the air - grenades, mortars, screams of the dying and
wounded, the two of i collapse together, as one, you're both safe for the
moment -Thousands die everywhere around us; we're alone, there's a single
bright spot in the sky...We're breathing for our own deaths - we're
exhausted, frightened, Maria's pregnant... I crawl towards her, I'm
wounded, bleeding, we're together now, forever, together at last... We're
crying, we can't say anything. Weeping for language, weeping for ourselves
- we promise everything to each other - we give everything to each other -
We make our final vows - we wait for the end - it's almost here - it's
coming -Our final vows - without language, in silence - there am no others
-We're silent - we can't hear you - don't say anything else - it's time
for - it's time for nothing at all - silence, once again, we suppose,
we're sleeping, the baby...

Now everything gone, inscription after the fact, our epitaphs, our ruined
lives...

adjust one itself

the moment i tuck my clothes in, there are disturbances across its
surface, don't one continually adjust itself?

or like when an itch, someone else's scratching getting rid of it. or a
tickle, one can't do that to oneself.

body holds itself together as plastic sphere, they know when a disturbance
arise, when Other appears, disappears. some say it all depends. i say it
is very controversial.

body is very complex. you put a hat on and it fits not so right, you know
how that feeling is bad for you. it's not even the site for you, it's just
my bad feeling.

body always huddles and collapses into this sphere, you don't want
anything bothering it, i bend my head and feet into it when it is very
snowy, you are warming it.

what a thing i take for granted, i mean i don't think about you when it
happens, then it happens that i tuck it in, all of it, and then you are
very fine and it is a nice day. or you can go and do what you want.

narcissism

we're speaking for the moment - online and offline conversations - analy-
ses - manifestos - signs, marches, puppetry - it goes on and on - they're
silent on the other side - use the royal 'we' - they include us - we're
being led to the slaughter - we're taking the world with us - we'll use
weapons of mass destruction - tactical nuclear against the bunkers - 10 to
15 percent of our weaponry gone astray - our own military reports expecta-
tions of over 3000 civilian casualties - in the name of liberation - blair
too - the whole lot of them - cold warriors - compulsive-obsessives -
madmen - another futile protest here -:they're getting stronger by the
moment - our performances are just that - select audiences of hundreds of
millions - they can't do anything - we're speaking into our own skin -
already the fear's upon us - they're nameless - they hide behind acronyms
- they lie, they fabricate evidence - tapes - bin laden's muddy voice -
we're supposed to believe all of this - we're under the gun here - we're
under warning - we're a declared state of emergency - :resistance is
futile - useless - we're bringing out blocks of writing - reams of it - to
no avail - the only measure that carries weight - violence, armed
resistance - i'm not up to that - we're unused to the brutality of our own
government - help's got to come from elsewhere - stunning revelation -
bush cancels 2004 elections - declares state of emergency - he's already
backed by the army - we're allowed to speak - our voices give out - the
strongest among us will be taken away - you've got to help us - you've
seen it all before - :: there aren't any miracles - stock market's falling
- construction's down -

madness of organs


the madness of organs. the organist takes care of things. the organist 
watches the keyboard. she watches her hands on the keyboard. she takes 
care of higher keys and lower keys. her hands move apart and return in 
fugue. the organist is in fugue state. he commands the air we breathe. he 
siphons the air. the air is siphoned by the organist. his passion is 
controlled by the process of pressing a key. the key is pressed and held. 
holding the key down, the organist controls a column of air. he commands 
the reeds of metal and bodies of wood. she is obsessed over a beautiful 
boy. her hair streams in the wind. she plays the organ naked. her breasts 
thrust forward with the stroke of keys. the boy is wounded in flanders 
field. the boy is dying. he is obsessed with her. he thinks he is ugly and 
disfigured. he plays madly. he is in a state of fugue. 

i am that organist in a state of fugue. i am surrounded by beautiful girls 
and boys. i am utterly mad in my columns of air. i command the atmosphere. 
i command the world of metal and wood. the organ towers above me. the 
organ is a great loudness in the world. the organ broadcasts my obsession 
and passion. the organ is a great tower unto mankind. 

my long hair falls on the keys. my thick blond hair falls on the keys. my
thick black hair falls on the keys. the beautiful boy will come and hear
my playing and take me in his arms.

BOASTS AND SHAMES


i am one of the best writers in the world. i am working on an entirely new
mode of writing. my writing is the most intense in the world. it is a com-
pletely new direction for political discourse. it will be years before i
am recognized.  long after i am dead my writing will be read. new audien-
ces will discover new ways of reading my work. my work is not recognized
as poetry, fiction, non-fiction, net-art, non-fiction, or codework. i am
not recognized as the last romantic or the first harbinger of the future
of all culture. i will be recognized as all of these. scholars will search
through net archives, print sources, remnants of film, video, recordings,
for the slightest trace of my work. my work will be attributed to others.  
there will be academic journals devoted to my work, and reputations will
rise and fall based on competing hypotheses. my works will be searched for
clues of identity, madness, influence, primogeniture. and i am ashamed of
this. i am ashamed for my contemporaries who find me arrogant, crazy,
dismissive, depressive, hysteric, obscene, furious, a nuisance, a pest,
useless, demanding, hyperbolic, obsessive, full of myself, elitist, vile -
a bad writer, a writer with too much writing - a non-writer - a videomaker
with too much video, filmmaker with too much film - an obscene organist, a
manic fake... i am ashamed for myself, who can only plead guilty to these
charges, these horrendous accusations. i am ashamed for our country, which
refuses me the honors i deserve. my work is subject to misunderstanding;  
it requires patience that no one has and no one wants to give. i am
ashamed that i will no longer be alive when, in the troubling and far-
distant future, my work is rediscovered, for its insights, genius, range,
and all-encompassing worlds of philosophy, psychology, literature, and
fields not yet discovered. and i am ashamed that i must admit to this
truth, still so early in my career.

::write boulders herohero::

:my best friend
listens all the time to the radio and television, she knows what the war
is all about, i don't know what the war is all about. so i ask her and she
tells me and it's all right. we decide the only thing that would work is
some other person being president fast and we can't remember how far down
people would have to die before that person brings an end to the horror.
and i can't sleep at night now and no one i know has a job and we're
victims and we repeat the same old stories all the time and nothing takes
away the pain. this country has nothing to do with us, this is a new
country and an old assyria country. please help us and tell us what to
do.:saviorsavior:saviorhero

:you can't do anything
now, you have to know that. thinking about people dying is against the law
and our president will live forever and no one will have to vote again
which is okay because very few voted before if you remember. almost no one
voted before but those who did had to brave the weather. now we have to
brave the war under our president but that is easy because our president
tells us what we have to do. please remember there is no horror and there
will be no horror. this is a new country and an old hittite country and
our president is our servant and we are his presidents.

:thank you for your point
of view, i now can sleep easier and i know my best friend is wrong, and
thank you for making the radio and television. we know what the war is
about and she is not speaking now and she has left. it is all right and i
cannot sleep because of worry from her but i sleep soon and i will not 
have to speak to her.

state of mind


"the carrier is ready to leave, with thousands of americans ready for 
war." (WCBS)

my friend and i think we will die in the next two months, from some as yet
unknown violence. new york is under furious regimens, the alert level
remaining high in spite of the rest of the country. almost everyone i know
is out of work. george bush rides hard with the shield of his presidency
into other countries; we have become a traditional 19th-century colonial
power overnight. i fear disappearing, the sudden knock at the door, the
brute force of anonymous men. every text i write points to my guilt in
this and every other matter. america has transformed within the hour;  
there will be no next election, as the country is placed under trumped up
emergency powers. the soldiery already sides with bush; every evening,
patriotic soldiers, who have never voted anyway, appear on the evening
news. new york will have the highest building in the world, in five years,
another target, as the city continues its doomed path to armageddon. we
are certain there is nuclear material here, ready to explode. i no longer
sleep at night, instead replaying the rhetoric of massacre and slaughter i
hear daily on the radio. the government has become monolithic, the
president listening to three or four men at the most. the cadre is
inspired by god and the mission of god. the country is held captive, as we
protest, realizing only violence will end violence, only slaughter will
end slaughter. as citizens we live in confusion and anxiety, watching our
nightmares turn real. we have abandoned the community of the world, the
internet a pale reminder of what we might have been. smiling earnest
troops are filmed leaving on enormous carriers. we offer billions in aid
to countries that accept our troops, while the stock market continues to
crash here, and the number of homeless rapidly increases. the nation is
thrown off balance, all formal energy tending towards military action. it
is hard to focus as we walk in fear of domestic terrorists from above,
other terrorists from within. for the first time we live in absolute
impotency, speaking to ourselves, waiting for everything and nothing at
all. this morning i saw two flashes, then nothing. sometimes there are
sounds. the meaninglessness of the world asserts itself at every turn. we
will not have to wait much longer, we will wait forever. the cadre has the
names, and dates. the cadre is absolute, and every absolute is evil.

>> I have been constructing sound and text for this work; I have also
constructed two videotapes, danl - about the construct of order from
space-time, and anja - about Lacanian ecstatic states, and Jean d'Arc.
Further, I have constructed a series of 95 still images. In addition, I
have constructed a number of pieces using the 1878 Beatty pump organ, and
the 1987 Mirage Ensoniq. I have also performed on the organ for a video
constructed by Foofwa for part of the initial section of the piece.  In
addition, I have constructed a short series of videos of Anja and Foofwa 
for a new piece to be constructed with the Blender 3d program. The text I 
have constructed is initially in French; I constructed a further English 
translation, replete with errors paralleling the fecundity of the French. 
Foofwa has constructed a videotape of my reading of the French text, as 
well as the second variant of the French text, which I constructed from a 
computer program I constructed from a program constructed by Florian 
Cramer. In the organ performance for Foofwa, the camera was focused on the 
pumping feet, placing the constructed piece under the aegis of labor. If 
music is a construct, I am that construct. If one can speak of a piece of 
music, one speaks only of an instantiation of the institutionalization of 
a segment of sound lost in the world. If one constructs a piece based and 
biased on the losing of the world, one begins the construct of a poetic 
based on mourning and labor. If labor is the beginning of the loss of the 
world, mourning is the end. If the word gains in the reification of labor, 
ululation is its loss and the mourning of that loss. If we can no longer 
speak of 'french' as an active, but must employ 'freedom,' then France is 
called Freedom. If my work is silent with the fullness of the mouths and 
interiority of dance, it speaks with the emptiness of speech and the 
exteriority of dance. If it is silent, if it speaks at all. If it speaks, 
if it is silent at all.

Jinns and others


Confucius, Analects, XV.II.1-3. 'The Master said, "Ts'ze, you think, I 
suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memory?" 
Tsze-kung replied, "Yes,--but perhaps it is not so?" "No," was the answer; 
"I seek a unity all-pervading."' (Legge.)

Al-Ghazali, The Recitation and Interpretation of the Qur'an (The Revival
of the Religious Sciences (Ihya' 'Ulum ad-Din). 'Anas Ibn Malik said, "It
often happens that a man recites the Qur'an, and the Qur'an curses him."'
[...] 'A certain religious scholar said, "When a son of Adam [i.e. man]
reads the Qur'an, then mingles [good with evil], and then turns [to God]
and reads it again, he is asked [by God], 'What is your relationship with
My speech?'"' (Muhammad Abul Quasem.)

Genesis P-Orridge, Interview with Carol Tessitore, Painful but Fabulous,
The Lives and Art of Genesis P-Orridge. 'It's all very public; everything
is about being available and having access to everything. The web is
supposedly fantastic because you can find everything and everyone is on
there, you can talk to everyone. It struck me that in a way privacy is
taboo.'

Marco Polo, Travels. 'Having concluded his prayer, he cried with a loud 
voice: "In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I command thee, O 
mountain, to remove thyself!" Upon these words being uttered, the mountain 
moved, and the earth at the same time trembled in a wonderful and alarming 
manner. The khalif and all those by whom he was surrounded, were struck 
with terror, and remained in a state of stupefaction. Many of the latter 
became Christians, and even the khalif secretely embraced Christianity'...

Concept/Choreography: Foofwa d'Imobilite
Dancerunners: Franziska Koller, Anja Schmidt, Foofwa d'Imobilite
Some music/text/image: Alan Sondheim

{working notes and phenomenology on the piece, which appeared in two
forms at the Kitchen in NY and will be on tour in Europe, 

a work which is difficult to visualize in spite of its relationship to
dance and running, terpsichore and sport. in the latter, one might say
that the spectator watches (in the sense of competition) the signifier
left behind by the runner - the overall time of the event. in the former,
the signifier is internal - what the body _does,_ not what it accomplish-
es. or the means as opposed to the end - or the process as opposed to the 
state (x = time-constant) - perhaps operator/operation as opposed to 
stating/state. the _regard_ of the spectator at the dance or race. or an 
exercise-running or a competition. or the submerged competition among 
dances, companies, choreographers, dancers, and the overt competition 
among runners. or labanotations opposed to any-winning-articulations of 
whatever form. 

a work divided into two sections as well - exterior and interior, the
former brought into the proscenium, spectator arena. what of a reversal -
the audience along the route, mobile video carrying the interior section
itself. do we need theaters? do we need theaters any more? the route is
the flow of information, mitigated information and performance among the
city, citying; the route is negotiated, dialog, dialectic. the interior 
part is institutionalized, financed, already an economy. within the 
interior, the audience-organs perform specific roles; the dancers are the 
lungs and feet - the dancers in this instance are the bodies of the 
audience, we want to run.

neither dance nor running, but an alliance or allegiance with the air, the
atmosphere, the spacing of the globe. they're a breath of fresh air, who
let the air in, we're giving ourselves airs, the air's a bit thick in
here, the air is the window of the soul. wavering among forms and among
bodies poised for dance, competition, running, adulation, exhaustion,
dying, rebirth, presentation, re-presentation - the event or eventing is a
becoming, not of deconstruction or disinstitutionalization, but of a
loosening of territories, not a territorialization or deterritorializa-
tion, but an opening, which is also an opening, in these dark times, of
_gladness._ it's this gladness which breathes of landscapes without
viewers, of eyes without minds, of a natural world without tending, with
tendency.

a work shaking loose notions of _work,_ at the same time tending towards 
exhaustion - dancers taking breaks when necessary, covering and recovering 
similar grounds when unnecessary, always _untethering,_ from running, from 
dance, from dance-run, from run-dance, run-run and dance-dance, a broken 
cartesian skein. - then again, this prowess and opening towards gladness.

How easy it would have been towards accolade! Carlyle's bowing figures in 
the early moment, pushed beyond their limits, arms in the air, breaking 
the ribbon at last! Such that England wins!

...drowned or ruined cities, submerged accolades, momentary stases, the 
coming recognitions, flooded sports arenas, flooded theaters, homes, 
palaces, bunkers, markets, cathedrals, the world gone upside-down...

in which the body is found between function and form, or rather form into 
function which returns to form, or rather decathecting and looking (rather 
than watching, i.e. watching a dance or watching a sports event, we looked 
at this performance

which keeps continuing, as if there's no end to the variations, nothing of 
imminent logic for example, nothing of teleology (rather than figures of 
violin, of tamboura or something slowly borrowed or roughly pulsing, of 
which this is a segment

in which the body keeps continuing, or finding or found, or running or 
drowning, as if there's no end and nothing of it (muscle, not brawn

submerged

MOAB TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISRUPTION
now listen to me. if we don't remove Saddam, who will? I'm tired
of the complaining. If you don't want to be here and support us,
you can always leave. There's not enough said about the other
side on these lists. It's time we took a stand. This is the best
country on earth with the most freedom. We have to protect it.
We have to strike at anyone who would take us out. Look what 
happened a year and a half ago when we let our guard down. That
was the liberals' fault. They believe everyone loves us. We know
better than that. A country prepared is a country that survives.

Jimmy no Carter


"Our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home, and we know
that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here
that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.
   To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. We will not behave
   in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at
   home, for we know that this trust which our nation earns is essential
   to our growth." (Jimmy Carter.)

"We can have an American government that does not oppress or spy on its
own people but respects our dignity and our privacy and our right to be
let alone." (Jimmy Carter.)

"The United States should give more vigorous support to the United Nations
and to other international bodies in order to attract world attention to
the denial of freedom. These bodies are limited in power, and I believe
that's best; but they can serve as a conscience of the world community, 
and they deserve far more support than our government has given them in 
recent years." (Jimmy Carter)

poem

waiting against the wall, i crawled out from under sun;
his gun betrayed a single eye cocked in my direction.
it followed me. i walked still. i could never run
in the midst of constant insurrection. in such will,
war is made. the tracers followed me upon the sea; we
were all betrayed. the worlds' erasers turned the mill,
crushing bodies hurled and burned for liberty; we drank
the whole night through. our bodies stank. our rank
betrayed us. underground, the metals clawed, churned
up without a sound, ready to crank the war's spurned
death in the mound of spacers. bones broke, eyes sank
breathless in the muck of screams. life at the seams
couldn't give a fuck. with luck we came home lame.

- j.r.

k23-29


k23% tomorrow is a moment of truth for the world
ksh: tomorrow: not found
k24% nations have voiced a commitment for peace and security
ksh: nations: not found
k25% france is still threatening a veto
ksh: france: not found
k26% we cannot have a situation where we have an endless discussion
ksh: we: not found
k27% war is just days away
ksh: war: not found
k28% innocent parties leave the area
ksh: innocent: not found
k29% iraq citizens stockpiling food
ksh: iraq: not found

tomorrow does not exist; nations are falling apart or cathecting 
boundaries in the face of distributive networking; france no long exists;
we is no longer a collectivity or communality; war is not found but 
created; the innocent no longer exist; if iraq did not exist, it would 
have been created; iraq has not been found; iraq is just days away; 
truth is no longer; nations cannot speak; food does not exist;

"Sometimes," Travis said, "you don't have a choice. But I wake up in the
morning and there's, just for an instant, a sense of hope. You don't know
what to do with it; it begins to fade just as soon as you're alert, as
soon as you realize what the day is going to bring." Sue-Ann felt
otherwise. "I keep the whole day like a bouquet of precious flowers," she
replied, brushing her hair back. "It keeps me going. These aren't hard
times for a lot of people, no matter what you read in the news." Travis
said, "I'm going to pay for the espressos," thinking "with my life in this
era of inconsequence when you can already hear the military band over
there in the Plaza." Sue-Ann was listening intently. When he returned, she
went on, "Brass instruments make me nervous, even in an orchestra. And
marches are so, well, plodding, as if we've nothing better to do than go
around walking in the sand." "Dragging our cannon," replied Travis. He,
too, was ill at ease, glancing at a table across the cafe. The General was
sitting with his Chief of Staff. They, too, heard the music, and smiled.
They were prepared for war. The Chief had laid out a series of maps and
diagrams on the small table. He pointed excitedly. "We're here, but we'll
be here by fall," he said. The General could only agree. All the
satellites carried fresh news of victories. The Chief thought of the
desert. In the desert, Claude had his legs shot off. He screamed. Didn't
the Chief know what was going on? Surely, Sue-Ann must have filled him in.
"Oh, this is a sorry sight," he thought. "I won't survive much longer." In
the distance he could hear cannon-fire; it sounded like a military band,
all that brass singing for the showdown. He wondered where Travis was,
what was going through his mind. Travis was thinking. "War is god-awful.
There's no escape; it fills the air, contaminates everyone except the
righteous. Anyone who can 'die for something' has never lived for
anything. Sue-Ann, thank God, has no illusions. Sue-Ann exists, like I
exist, like the men at that table over there, like Claude. Claude must be
bored out of his mind, all that sand..." He paused, lit a cigarette,
waited for the Resistance to kick in. "Can a desert be ruined," he
wondered. "Can anything?" Claude died. The last radiotelephone call to the
Chief concerned a flock of black birds over the horizon. "They're
everywhere," he said. "They're coming closer and closer. Enormous talons,
black as night, red beaks almost glowing in the sun. The birds." "The
birds" were his last words. The sand was stained red. His black uniform
stood out like the sky. It was inescapable, obscene. The General was
pointing. "Stop thinking about Sue-Ann," he said. He pointed at the maps.
"Over here, and here, and here." His fingers moved quickly across the
landscape. Jean was alone down there, somewhere down there. The Chief said
"Don't think about time. Or space, for that matter. This is dead land, a
dead map. Someday the sun will disappear. In billions of years it will
disappear. That's not much time in the scheme of things. A lot can happen,
but then nothing happens at all. Once you realize that, you're saved. You
don't have to believe anything, and you're saved." Sue-Ann thought of
Jean. "He was my first love," she said, to no one in particular.
"Unbelievably empty. That's what kept him going. That's what destroyed
me." Travis nodded; he was distracted. "Jean" was a name to him, nothing
more. A syllable of affect, like "fuck." It collapsed of its own weight;
it was lost, spoken, unspoken. "Jean," she said. "You know it's Jean." She
paused. "He's nothing to me." The sand covered the body. The army marched
forward, here, and here, and here. The army passed children with their
eyes gouged out, women with the arms and breasts cut off, men without
ears, noses, legs. All alive on the back of the beast. The dead were
indescribable. The birds covered the sky, an enormous migration. The birds
kept going, north to south, east to west, west to east, south to north.
The birds kept flying. The desert, shadowed, cooled. The trace of the army
across the sand... "Let's go," Travis said. "Let's get out of here."
"Okay," said Sue-Ann. "Enough memories anyway. And it's getting late."
They slowly made their way towards the Plaza. The General and the Chief
were already gone. A single napkin remained on the table. "Here," it said.
"The guns here." An arrow pointed to the north-east. Sue-Ann turned it as
they crossed into the street. Louder and louder, the band! Stirring music
and marches! The brass in step! The woodwinds backing up! And the drums!
The drums! Night fell. The waiters chained the chairs down, cleared the
tables. The band played on. A Story for All Times ::
