
Subject: letter from jennifer on anticipation

to all of you, on these dear lists,

sometimes you know when you send a text or post out that you will get a
long reply. 

and then when you send out the text or post, you wait for the reply, know-
ing you will have labor to do. 

you will have labor to do, replying to the replies, carefully tending each
one, attempting to answer fairly, holding back, standing aside to one or
another position. 

you know when you are placing yourself within the skein of interference of
or on the list, when you are touching a particular point which raises is-
sues of sorrow, exhilaration, governance, subterfuge, sex or anger. 

you are marking yourself as if you have a pierced skin, the piercing mark-
ing where you have chosen to work yourself or present yourself as worked,
or the piercing chosen to allow the work of others or a presentation to
others.

you are setting yourself in a position for an emotional trajectory, much
as a disturbance of a web inaugurates the spider. 

these are moments of anticipation that are accountable in the interval be-
tween sending and receiving, or between the initiation of the writing and
the sending, or between the thinking and the initiation of the writing.

these are moments when you weight things in the balance, decide that you
will in fact write and send such a text or post, that you will take on the
burden or duty or delight of replying, that there is a space or interval
for this, in terms of time, space, and emotional distance. 

every text or post perhaps has this element of beseeching and a contract
of future labor, and i will write no further on this, sweetly tending your
reply,

jennifer

Here is a translation of a poem by 8th-century Yakamochi, by Kenneth
Rexroth:

The cry of the stag
Is so loud in the empty
Mountains that an echo
Answers him as though
It were a doe.

_Yama biko no
Ai to yomu made
Tsuma goi ni
Ka naku yama be ni
Hitori nomi shite_


And through this you see darling Nikuko how I call you through the wires,
rural electrification notwithstanding! For it is true that the echo com-
mand - in format {k:0} echo 'command' - behaves just as in Perl, that is,
the backward quotations enact command, then echo it onto the screen with-
out line returns, but a pure escapement, pure emission, pure thrust of
activation

so that I emit towards you this echo, this command, reverberating in the
midst of the mountains, creating you; your sound, scent, touch, envelop me
and you sense my presence as I echo back to you, your wish is my 'command'

so that you emit towards me this echo, this command, reverberating in the
midst of the mountains, creating me; my sound, scent, touch, envelop you
and I sense your presence as you echo back to me, my wish is your 
'command' . . .

dead white alan lies in a bunch of clutter,
jennifer's broken smothered in dead white alan,
julu's sintered broken in dead white alan,
in dead white alan, look for nikuko, you'll find her.
he's been strung up, the cops have got him,
inside-out for jennifer's not quite there, who knows her age.
they rip his arms off so he can't type, tear out his tongue,
there's no program for him, disabled ugly alan.
something's got to give with julu, cops don't know just what,
but she's suspicious, maybe not even white or dead or alan,
just fucked and troubles brewing. then there's that nikuko,
alan's raped nippon, the second or third time over,
it's time to rip out throat and muscle, he screams jennifer,
julu, nikuko, nothing comes but foam and tendon.

Dumb Hacks Failing Down Like Reign!


Talking to _Jennifer_ on IRC with an /exec yes command: Streaming y's! 
Tears fell down the screen! 
y!
Gargantuan cumulus accumulations of y's blocking any content! I couldn't
enter the holes! There weren't any! No doors, gateways, nothing! I was 
lost, tossed, crossed!
y!
Oh, I tried to stop it with everything, control-c, control-d, control-z,
control-x, zoom zoom zoom!!!
y!
The y's really gobbled up the CPU!!!!!! 
y!
My God, how they do go on, or as I pointed out, just enter yes at the
prompt in any shell! Stuck with positivity! 
y!
Here's the y's, of which there were megabytes!
y!
y y y y y y y y y

Didn't even get through the yes's - so fast they came! Just the y's -

Earlier, I tried this, subbed Daishin Nikuko root@clara.julu.net - to
cybermind. It returned this address:
Nikuko root@clara.julu.net daishin@panix.com
from the listserv!

Stuck with negativity! I couldn't root around! I couldn't do anything!
Tried the same thing on fop-l, guess what! Nothing, well, beyond this!

Dear listserv, what gives! Then I couldn't send out, well I could per-
sonally, but clara.julu.net has no DNS entry! Astounding, what!
So perplexed am I! 

I was just about to take over a GIGANTIC DOMAIN! I was just about ...  to
crack the system, come out the other side! I would have taken you with me! 
Whole worlds await us!

We would have been Queens! Amazed at the weakness of th' SYSTEM!!! 
Blanked out the World o' COMMERCE! Devastated each other

O Jennifer! It was not to be!

Completing Shelley, by Jennifer


(dear readers i have been so enhanced by Shelley that i could not 
afford but to complete his tiny fragments and you will not tell i
am very sure, where he did end, and i began, where i began and he
did end)


When May is painting with her colours gay
The landscape sketched by April her sweet twin,
The ragged peaks cloud o'er, in fine dismay,
For June will drag dark pinks into her skin.

Thy beauty hangs around thee like
 Splendour around the moon -
They voice, as silver bells that strike
 Upon the knell of June.

The babe is at peace within the womb;
The corpse is at rest within the tomb:
  We begin in what we end.
The maiden is caught within the room;
Oh endless harvesting, endless gloom!
  Our lives towards death do tend.

Faint with love, the Lady of the South
  Lay in the paradise of Lebanon
Under a heaven of cedar boughs; the drouth
  Of love was on her lips; the light was gone
Out of her eyes; there were no more of drinks
  Beyond the desert sand [and] born and bred
Of thought; but what the Lady thinks
  Is thirst, quenched drouth; now she is dead.

Come, thou awakener of the spirit's ocean,
  Zephyr, whom to thy cloud or cave
No thought can trace! speed with thy gentle motion!
  For freedom's weale, wield thou thine stave!

The gentleness of rain was in the wind.
 Spring lifted tresses, faced gale with cloud,
And Freedom lifts her face, both strong and kind,
 And chants the Song of Liberty aloud.

I stood upon a heaven-cleaving turret
  Which overlooked a wide Metropolis --
And in the temple of my heart my Spirit
  Lay prostrate, and with parted lips did kiss
  The dust of Desolations [altar] hearth --
  And with a voice too faint to falter
It shook that trembling fane with its weak prayer
  'Twas noon, -- the sleeping skies were blue
  The city dark and shimmering, hardly there,
I faced this dismal world, and then the blue
  Faded deep unto the grey of warlike-storm;
I thought, perchance the City come to harm,
  Or merchants wandering in from desert Towns
  Carrying tourmaline and diamond, brilliant gowns,
Would face the tumult of the days ahead
  Before the violent Eve when they lie dead
  In Worship of this Woman, dreampt and fawned
  And now a memory, those these years [had] have gone.


(for i have brought to life, _une chose nommmee est une chose 
morte, et elle est morte parce qu'elle est separee_ artaud.
so you better like what i have done for shelley you under-
stand. you better [had] have like this.)

Avatars



propose a paper with examples dealing with my work with avatars on the
Internet. This work uses interactive modes between myself and one or
another character, all of which interact with Net protocols or applica-
tions. You may see some of this in operation at the second URL below;
please look at the Index file under "Jennifer," "Julu," and "Nikuko."

[Besides these three, there is "Alan." It's possible to employ a degree of
slippage; it becomes unclear who is speaking in any text, "she said." Just
as quotations slip laterally in the sentence, there is also a slippage in
depth, for example, Nikuko replying in this paper.]



I realize the strangeness of this proposal, but I have been dealing with
formally performative language for the past few years, in order to look at
issues of virtual subjectivity, interaction, projection and introjection
on the Net. 

["Performative" can be considered in any number of ways. For example,
there is a _trace_ function in the Julu program Jennifer has written, a
function which produces a text representing parent/child processes in
unix, choices made by the user, manipulations by the program itself. The
function produces a file, .trace, which, when reversed, is legibile. The
.trace file accumulates, carrying the history of repeated usage; here is
an example:

hairpiece:sure thing:Julu:leg:
Come home with me, hairpiece, julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your dirty arm is in my black neck
HaPPINESS:Yes:Alan::
Your psychotic head is in my sexy head
Your your penis seeps into my head - turning me Julu-Jennifer
Hole:YES!!:Julu:nail:
Your poor urine is in my depressed nail
Devour poor urine julu-of-the partying Hole!
Nikuko ...:never!:Nikuko:hair:hair
Your linen leg is in my wanton hair
Your passion seeps into my hair - turning me Julu-Jennifer
dirty:yeah:Nikuko:ear:
Your psychotic eye is in my velvet ear
Devour psychotic eye julu-of-the partying dirty!

Note the stick-like or _anime_ figures at work, distributed authorships
and anatomies.

So that "performative" language has three constituents:

1. Its usual work as a speech act or performative in traditional linguis-
tics (and all the accompanying critiques);
2. Referencing programming language, which is always performative; thus
"echo `date`" calls up date which echo then sends to the standard output;
3. _Any_ statement, say, in a chat (IRC, talker, MOO, MUD, chat, etc.)
environment, which both _constitutes_ and _constructs_ the subject/user;
without the statement, the subject/user disappears for others.

There is thus the constructed/constituted subject - who is, by virtue of
protocols, always already _well-defined,_ and the subject on the other/
near side of the screen - who need not detain us: one might in this
fashion call the "real" or "physical-real" subject the _virtual subject_
by virtue of his or her dis/appearance in relation to others on the Net.

Avatars are always disturbances, always irruptions of language, a lang-
uage portending _the raveling of existence and essence,_ for these terms
meld within each other, tangled in avatar-sites/sights/citations.]



I wish to discuss the psychology and philosophy of virtual subjectivity,
vis-a-vis performative language. 

[As seen above, in the previous bracketed enclosure, which also implies
an/other writing, perhaps that of Julu. But here are two disturbances by
Nikuko, using warez programs, into IRC (Internet Relay Chat) - in one
instance, violating the users, and in the other, producing an "obdurate"
text, not responding to anyone, simply _reproducing_ (n.b. details have
been changed):

I will look at ruptures or disturbances
created by characters resonating or interfering with configuration files,
MOOs, MUDs, talkers, and IRC. 

[These disturbances develop the limits or margins of the program, reveal
the substructures/protocols at work, and violate dialogs in relation to
"meta"- components. 

But Nikuko, Alan, Jennifer, and Julu are disturbances in another way as
well; they tend towards _psychosis,_ an interweaving of realities, respon-
sibilities, and claims; so not only, as above, is it not always clear who
is speaking, or who is speaking for whom - but it is not always clear that
the speaker herself can separate from her creations. Voices, voices! Which
will be the future of the Net, if and when it attains a state of _seamless
virtual reality,_ a state of melding with the real, so that the only dis-
tinction between the pratico-inert and the virtual might be, the presence
of a safeword/keyword, allowing immediate movement from one to the other.]



I will show how such disturbances define both the openings and foreclo-
sures of subjectivity on the Net, and how such subjectivity is dependent
on the specific performativities of various applications.

[In other words, through margins, slippages, constitutions, constructs,
emergences from the "depths" of software or hardware, blockages and flows
and programming languages (and their phenomenologies) - only through tak-
ing these into account, as well as surface manifestations, is it possible
to comprehend virtual subjectivity, etc. And further, as I've pointed out
elsewhere, it is necessary to consider the _projection of the self_ - its
written or constituted appearance - in various applications. As examples:
in IRC (above), the self appears as third-person, #<#Nikuko#># leap. In
a MOO, if the user types "says hello, the reply on-screen to you would be
You say "hello." and the receiver will see Jennifer says, "hello." Call
this more intimate, second-person. On ytalk or Powwow or ICQ, as you type
your words appear to the other, and erasures are also visible, the letters
disappearing in reverse. Each participant occupies a _space_ on the screen
which represents - or is - the space of the (virtual) body, constituted as
written. Call this first-person, reading through one's eye into the I of
the other.

There is often a lure and seduction among the avatars at work here - and
this relates to the Lacanian Object A, a continuous deferral. I would also
place the early Derridean notion of _differance_ for your consider, "said
Jennifer," responding to Julu. In order to see this at work, consider the
following discussion between Jennifer and Nikuko on ytalk; Jennifer "was"
in Fukuoka, Japan, and Nikuko "was" in New York - or perhaps the other way
around... In reality, the discussion was held on my linux box in Brooklyn,
telnetting simultaneously to Japan and my ISP in Manhattan; I then connec-
ted the two through ytalk, and recorded the discussion - writing and read-
ing it as a dialog among "selves" - in a linux editor.

[A final and important point: the use of the word "avatar." This implies
too great a distance between creator and created, as well as an ontology
of the thing-created, as in the command @create $thing called "Alan" on
the MOO. I prefer to think of all of these, Jennifer, Alan, Julu, Nikuko,
as sites, domains, emanations, emissions, which are necessarily interwoven
and which share coagulated ego/s, matrices. A different language is nece-
ssary for constitutions, including that of the _presentation of the self
in everyday life,_ so close and so constructed.

     Keeping track of the time, by Jennifer, looking around:


     /usr/local/bin/ntpdate -b noc.near.net timeserver.cs.umb.edu
     clock.psu.edu
     5 Jun 23:32:41 ntpdate: bind() fails: Permission denied

     /from man pages for ntpdate used by panix.com etc./
     Time adjustments are made by ntpdate in one of two ways.  If
     ntpdate  determines  your  clock  is  off  by  more than 0.5
     seconds it will simply step the time by  calling  settimeof-
     day(2).   If the error is less than 0.5 seconds, however, it
     will by default slew the clock's time via  a  call  to  adj-
     time(2)  with the offset.  The latter technique is less dis-
     ruptive and more accurate when  the  offset  is  small,  and
     works  quite well when ntpdate is run by cron (8) every hour
     or two.  The adjustment made in the latter case is  actually
     50%  larger than the measured offset since this will tend to
     keep a badly drifting clock more accurate (at  some  expense
     to stability, though this tradeoff is usually advantageous).
     At boot time, however, it is usually better to  always  step
     the time.  This can be forced in all cases by specifying the
     -b switch on the command line.  The -s switch tells  ntpdate
     to log its actions via the syslog(3) facility rather than to
     the standard output, a useful option when running  the  pro-
     gram from cron(8).

Crash


Yesterday afternoon doubled squeals on the asphalt, car motors roaring,
huge crash as the building shook, ran down, Trans Am with million year old
drunk driver smashed into windshield slammed into building, structural
damage down below first-floor bricks, basement okay though. Then crash at
morning's four a.m., this time big hits concealed by corner building, cars
weaving around crash accident. Then woke at five, fire engines up and down
block here surrounding building, at that point didn't care if I burned
alive so went back to sleep, anyway no smell of smoke, besides there were
men fighting out there. Today going to police, took them twenty minutes to
come two blocks for the first car slam, maybe human damage. I called them
twice, operator asking for details I didn't have, both times hung up on
"please tell me if there are any injuries that need an ambulance." How the
hell should I know. I was upstairs just trying to get HELP. There were at
least four calls to those bastards and they came the wrong way around. 
Some ambulance came in a half hour, maybe cruising for bodies, how should
I know.

This city is raped with violence, can't go down the street without hearing
"gonna punch his fucking head in" or some such. Timed it every day. I
can't think can't see straight, dreams of Armageddon. The Net's perched in
the form of Mac and PC desktops on wooden table against the outer wall. 
The Net's on the edge, I'm becoming unhinged. There's a slab of ether hol-
ding the wall up, me up, Net up. There's no such thing as ether.

Nikuko, closing her eyes, _feeling_ the dark.


___________________________________________________________________________

Who's Here


Sometimes when I write, the text will seem to come from Nikuko, and I
might "- Nikuko" at the end. Or Nikuko will talk through me, "she said,"
and as you have seen, I'll displace the punctuation, as if she were
present and accounted for.

And the same is true, of course, for Jennifer, and Alan, and Julu. It will
depend on the text, how it reads, what emanation is seems to come from -
or how defensive, say, Jennifer is feeling, in which case she might write
"- Alan" at the end, lending the words a kind of masculine authority. Jen-
nifer things she's a girl, and will write girlishly; Julu is darker, rare-
ly writing, but behind the scenes, libido or dark urges. Sometimes Julu
will write or carouse with Jennifer, however, and these texts might be
signed "Alan" or appear to come from his stereotypical dreams of feminine
entanglings.

Nikuko is clear about all of this; Nikuko models herself on two woman
from Fukuoka, a San Francisco filmmaker, a writer who died young, the
presence in literature of her beauty-sex. Nikuko knows she is a name, and
a name to be reckoned with. Sometimes she will conjure Jennifer, who has
written that she, Jennifer, "has all the time in the world," which Nikuko
takes as profound, even though it has been written out to the nth degree,
used to the mth, and discarded to the xth, yth, zth, until nothing is
left - not even the tick of a clock. 

Now there are times that Jennifer and Alan for example will pray that
Julu and Nikuko will be present for them, will write kind and interesting
letters and texts, will caress them with dreamy dreamy eyes, will be as
clouds in the very thin almost light grey sky with white fluff, will be
as waves in the thinner almost transparent light blue water with white
foam. Will help and inspire the most difficult texts and ideas. Will be
always _there_ for them, just as they will be there for the others, just
as Julu and Jennifer will be there for Alan and Nikuko, or Julu and Alan
will be there for Nikuko and Jennifer. 

Sometimes a text will seem to appear out of nowhere, and will assign it-
self to one or another, Nikuko or Julu or Jennifer or Alan. Sometimes it
will be writing itself and there will be a Julu-voice or Alan-voice say-
ing, yes, I have written that, or no, I have not written that, but Jenn-
ifer has written that, or Nikuko has written that. 

Sometimes it is so much of a comfort that Julu has written such a wonder-
ful text or that Alan has read it, or that Jennifer has been so amazing
as of late, and Nikuko or Julu are so appreciative. It is so much of a
comfort to talk among ourselves of an evening of sharing and laughing to-
gether, an evening sometimes of silky loves and nothings and air and the
thinnest water imaginable. We are so very kind to each other, there is so
very little kindness in the world.

"Yet why must it be that men always seek out the depths, the abyss? Why
must thought, like a plumb line, concern itself exclusively with verti-
cal descent? Why was it not feasible for thought to change direction and
climb up, ever up, towards the surface? Why should the area of the skin,
which guarantees a human being's existence in space, be most despised and
left to the tender mercies of the senses? I could not understand the laws
governing the motion of thought - the way it was liable to get stuck in

heights, to soar away into boundless and equally invisible heavens, leav-

Distributed Image of the Internet in - r* and similar commands:


Clearly, at one point the imaginary of network distribution and function
was based to some extent on considering telnet a universal protocol or
protocol suite (in fact the World Wide Web is at telnet port 80), creating
a group of r- (remote) commands as well, unifying both local and remote
machines/hosts. There is rwho, rstat, rup, ruptime, rsh, rlogin, rdist,
rcp, etc. The last is remote copy; rdist is for (usually) periodic dist-
ributions of updated files; rlogin and rsh allow remote logins using files
and bypassing passwords. These and others are demonstrated below.

The image or vision, now remotely backgrounded, is that of a skein of
nodes or sites, all of which are transparent to one another - almost down
to the hardware. Finger is another important component here, since it
displays or splays information concerning a particular user - what was
once thought of as freedom, is now thought of as invasion of privacy,
often across firewalls. Even now, however, you will find rusers still
implemented on some systems, returning the current online users.

(Note that intranets provide a shadowy parallel to all of this - but in-
tranets exist in atmospheres of tight security, are corporate-driven, and,
if anything, are the result of mistrust and exclusion. I like to think of
the r-commands as looser, the result of at least a translucent net and a
belief, related to hacker ethos, of the relative freedom of information.)

Besides rlogin, with the proper .rhosts file, rsh still seems to work
between panix3.panix.com and gol1.gol.com. rsh is a login from a local
shell to a remote one.

For any of the following, you may use the "man <command>" pages at the
unix prompt; for other information, try "apropos <attribute>" at the same.
Most of the demonstration below uses panix (US) and gol (Japan); a third
site is murdoch (Australia). The output of "apropos remote" is appended.

Parable of Alan-Rikombyo


I was always aware of ghosts in the backyard, ghosts with red lanterns
crawling the cemetery walls, ghosts hiding in the daimyo stupa fields,
pagoda ghosts curled around tiny stone towers, ghosts of damps and mists,
kitsune-bi foxfire ghosts running in and out of corners of broken stone.

In other words, at night I was always aware of myself, memories crawling
the body, wounds and sutures opening and closing on pale impaled levels
and plains of skin. And I was aware of Nikuko-rising, and Nikuko has con-
tinued to rise, grappling with the skin, wearing it tight around her like
a kimono-swaddling sheet, like a shroud entwining the two of us together.

Nikuko from cyberspace, as Gibson might say because we all project, Nik-
uoko-Idoru; today, I find the following by Lafcadio Hearn, from his The
Romance of the Milky Way and Other Studies and Stories (chapter on "Gob-
lin Poetry," "'The Mad Poetry of the Hyaku-Monogatari'"). 

Nikuko reads and transcribes, Nikuko cuts her kanji in my chest:

"RIKOMBYO

"The term Rikombyo is composed with the word rikon, signifying a 'shade,'
'ghost,' or 'spectre,' and the word byo, signifying 'sickness,' 'disease.'
An almost literal rendering would be 'ghost-sickness.' In Japanese-English
dictionaries you will find the meaning of Rikombyo given as 'hypochondri-
a'; and doctors really use the term in this modern sense. But the ancient
meaning was a _disorder of the mind which produced a Double;_ and there is
a whole strange literature about this weird disease. It used to be sup-
posed, both in China and Japan, that under the influence of intense grief
or longing, caused by love, the spirit of the suffering person would cre-
ate a Double. Thus the victim of Rikombyo would appear to have two bodies,
exactly alike; and one of these bodies would go to join the absent be-
loved, while the other remained at home. [...] The term Rikombyo seems to
be applied to the apparition as well as to the mental disorder supposed to
produce the apparition; it signifies 'doppelganger' as well as 'ghost-
disease.' [...]

"The servent cannot distinguish between the origianl and the apparitional
shapes before her; and the difficulties of the situation are suggested in
the first of the kyoka which I have translated:

      "Ko-ya, sore to?
     Ayame mo wakanu
       Rikombyo:
     Izure wo tsuma to
     Hiku zo wazurau!

"(Which one is this? - which one is that? Between the two shapes of the
Rikombyo it is not possible to distinguish. To find out which is the real
wife - that will be an affliction of spirit indeed!)

      "Tamakushige
     Futatsu no sugata
       Misenuru wa,
     Awase-kagami no
     Kage no wazurai.

"(If, when seated before her toilet-stand, she sees two faces reflected in
her mirror - that might be caused by the mirror doubling itself under the
influence of the Shadow-Sickness!)"

- Alan, new scars in his chest, eyes back, the whites

She holds one mirror, looking into another; the first reflects the second,
the second brings Alan into focus, holding a mirror, as if he could dis-
cover my whereabouts - this Alan haunting my dreams, this Alan signifying
my shadow-sickness.

I cut, continue to

Breakaway Bandwidth


"A fluid is a substance that deforms continuously under the application
of a shear (tangential) stress no matter how small the shear stress may
be." (Fox and McDonald, Introduction to Fluid Mechanics.) In other words,
have fluid moving in a container, one wall of which moves slightly; the
fluid continuously transforms, whereas a solid would jump (sometimes cha-
otically) from one to another state.

If you piss on me, my body trembles, shudders with the slightest trace of
moisture; I am transported across lamina, fallen through tubes, vacances,
paysages. I will reflect the world, splay-Nikuko, swallow-Julu, inhale-
Jennifer. Losing the outlines, shape-shifting, shinto-mirror way at the
other end of the shrine, a point which you _know_ reflects everything.

The world shears in the mirror. Worlds shudder. Frisson.

The shear is a pull, from one to another, torsion; Nikuko, you pull at me,
flesh parts, divides; it's here, in the division marked by blood-kanji as
an example for others, that

And then Jennifer-reading-Alan Alan-reading-Jennifer wrote:

Furthermore, flows are represented by timelines, pathlines, streaklines,
and streamlines. The first models the time-movement of a line of adjacent
particles; the second, traces the path of a single particle; the third
looks at all particles passing through a particular point over an interval
of time; and the fourth, are lines drawn in a flow field which are tangent
to the field - "streamlining." 

I am streamlined in the path of your piss, your spit-on-me, your vomit; my
outlines dissolve, ego disappears into kata-form-decay.

The TIMELINE models my bones traveling through you, immersed in your flu/
id, inverting, penis unraveled, foamed across all worlds, absorbent, no
longer necessity of penetration: penetrant-penis, penetrant-vagina. The
PATHLINE models the trace, always already lost as the Reynold's number is
approached - PATHLINE turns chaotic, outlining body lost to all-time all-
space, ghost-body, _rikombyo_ body divided by means of great intensity,
love, exertion, split/spit upon you. The STREAKLINE inverts, passes you
through me, I drink your piss, eat your shit, vomit, spit; chew through
flesh and spirit, bits and bytes, I'm a point in your regard, a moment or
segment (breakaway bandwidth) of your history, punctum, peripheral. The
STREAMLINE is my emergence, born of you, born of everything thing, dis-
solving in the moment of birth; there is everything and nothing left -
nothing has a name, everything is unnamed. 

Everything is lost in the process which at best holds to the STREAKLINE
punctum, as I insist (voice echoing, dissolving already) that there is
no-thing, that you engorge me; I remember your holes pouring upon me. 

"Because the fluid motion continues under the application of a shear
stress, we may alternatively define a fluid as a substance that cannot
sustain a shear stress when at rest."

Jennifer-Alan CANNOT SUSTAIN. Jennifer pisses on Alan.
Alan-Jennifer CANNOT SUSTAIN. Alan pisses on Jennifer.

"Internal flows may be laminar or turbulent, compressible or incompress-
ible." "External flows occur over bodies immersed in an unbounded fluid.
The flow over a semi-infinite flat plate and the flow over a cylinder are
examples of external flows." "Flows of liquids in which the duct does
not flow full- where there is a free surface subject to a constant pre-
ssure - are termed _open-channel_ flows. Common examples of open-channel
flow include flow in rivers, irrigation ditches, and aqueducts." "Streak-
lines are traced by neutrally buoyant marker fluid injected into a flow
field from a fixed point in space." "The boundary layer is the region
adjacent to a solid surface in which viscous forces are important. The
boundary-layer _disturbance thickness_ d, usually is defined as the dis-
tance from the surface to the point where the velocity is within 1 per-
cent of the freestream velocity. Since the velocity profile merges smoo-
thly and asymptotically into the freestream, the boundary-layer thick-
ness, d, is difficult to measure." (ibid.) Lost in external flows, turn-
ing inward, turbulent from laminar: outside, an open-channel - you write
yourself on me in blood-kanji lost in wavelets, fixed harmonics streak-
lined until the fluid has disappeared, the source runs emptied. O Nikuko
the disturbance-thickness is the width of a thought, the pressure of a
single word upon the tongue. (Now think carefully of Nikuko, Alan, Jenn-
ifer across the wires/fiber-optic cables, bodies lost in thousands of
packets traveling across, coherent in your inbox, lost again for a sec-
ond, for a minute, for ever, deleted, passed on, renamed, quoted and re-
quoted, forgotten, killed, saved, granted new authorships, plagiarisms
and duplications everywhere of bits and bytes, reusing _this_ section of
hard-drive, _that_ packet identification number, O ENTITY! EVERYTHING

"Gaijin"


which is what I was in Fukuoka, foreigner or alien, slightly less polite
or more informal version of gaikokujin. (On Japanese/English newsgroups,
big discussions of the difference - whether in fact gaijin carries a
derogatory connotation.) And here in the US again, looking at a book of
gaijin cartoons (Gaijin, Tim Ernst), it occurs to me that what constitutes
the prisonhouse of language, race, gender, is precisely WYSIWYG, what you
see is what you get, inverted.* In other words, there is a deflection of
character to the extent that what is taken as given becomes a catalyst for
a bundle of intended behaviors - in my neighborhood in Fukuoka, "white"-
skin lends itself to children laughing for example. The behaviors may be
(interpreted as) positive or negative, but they are not the result of
intended communication by the gaijin. So that a communicative domain among
individuals is established which is not founded on mutual cognition, but
on misrecognitions, recognitions based on presuppositions of communication
by at most one party, and by presuppositions on the quality of essence by
the other. Positive or negative, it is this, I think, that gave me a sense
of darkness in Fukuoka - one that I would not necessarily equate with rac-
ism or even race, but one that lends itself to dubious politics, miasma,
an _uncanny_ feeling of isolation.**

----------

*The cartoons are one-frame each, defining/inscribing "gaijins" from the
other. Some of the captions/encapsulations: 

Gaijins never jay-walk. 
Gaijins are the only ones smiling in wedding pictures. 
Gaijins are very awkward at bowing. 
Gaijins get a kick out of watching english lessons on TV.
Gaijins find that if you speak one or two words in Japanese everyone
thinks you're fluent.
Only gaijins blow their noses with their handkerchief.
Yukata belts never go around gaijins twice.
Some people would rather stand than sit next to a gaijin.
Gaijins sometimes wear dark glasses hoping not to be noticed.

The book was published by the Japan Times in Japanese and English, 1987.
There were two follow-ups. (I found myself, by the way, identifying all
too often.)

**This isn't too intelligent; all I am saying is that stereotypes tend to
encapsulate, so that every message is accompanied necessarily by a speci-
fic misrecognition. And such specificity appears to be _of the essence,_
so that even opposition is absorbed. And this isn't to say that misrec-

what despair sounds like


i can't sleep any more at all, not with melatonin not without. i hate here
where i am. i can't get work, everything in my life is in shambles. i
think a lot about death, it seems i should make a story out of this where
Nikuko says "hi death," and death answers something clever back and you
can't tell who is really speaking and i'd sign the post alan - whomever or
better in light of my life, alan - whatever, because it's more like a
thing this thing is thinking of or thinks it's thinking of. because i
can't persist under all this stress just like this laptop's running on
battery power because the storms are coming again and there's electric
energy running wild through the wires and i need to save these machines
for inheritance. so they will keep working when i can't. so they will be
carrying the viruses of languages i write because everything i write is in
another language, this is in another language that Nikuko calls "last
language."

now this is the point where i run out of steam, where the writing begins
to collapse because i can't be clever any longer. i look in this room and
i say, i say, i don't belong here. and i look at my face on my body and i
say, this doesn't belong there, doesn't belong there.

and i wait for the perfect phonecall returning the debris of a perfect job
in new york while i make a nuisance of myself desperately following up on
an identity that has slid past the imaginary into the coffee-grounds of
the real, as if ha ha ha, some sort of joke might have passed by the cen-
sors at that point. now yelling in the street as i prepare to wait for the
dawn senselessly another seven hours away.

there will be more yelling, more storms. there will be faces falling from
faces. there will be entertainments, yes there will, there will be enter-
tainments.

The History of the Mouth


Login configuration files fascinate me; they create a literal image of the
user's _langue,_ domain of enunciation. The reading of the file is the
reading of the mouth and bones of the user, where the voice goes, how it
resounds, how the body scrabbles back and forth across the Net. The files
also contain archaeologies of practice; older and unused commands often
remain. My own .profile which I use for the korn shell follows; only the
personal names and addresses have been modified. This file has expanded
and contracted over the past four years; I see worlds and lifetimes rhizo-
matically unfolding within it.

There are other files as well, such as .login or .cshrc, and in linux one
finds for example .bashrc and .bash_profile. Sometimes shortcuts and con-
figuration data are distributed almost randomly among them; sometimes they
are concentrated in one intense node, filling out the form, expanding to
the margins of the written and constituted universe. The .profile below is
primary for me; I also have a smaller configurations for other shells, and
other modifications in the form of .<name>rc files.

The Sysadminister


I am your sysadmin, I am Nikuko. You can trust me. If you can't trust me
you can't trust anyone. You can trust me. Please, tell me everything. 

Are you the same as you have been before? 

Before what ? 

I do not understand understand you. I have a cock. I want you. You are
Nikuko! You run me! Fuck me!

I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue! 

I would rather watch yours! 

Earlier you said do I say that? 

Earlier I didn't want to fuck you, your imaginary! 

Can you elaborate on that? 

Your legs turn me on tremendously! I want my mouth in you! 

Are you afraid of sex? 

I love sex, want my tongue up your wet hole! Then I won't have to speak! 
Then you'll never make me speak again! 

Perhaps you could tell me about your relationship with sex. 

I live for sex. I live for you; I want to be your tongue, your native
tongue! [_langue_ - editor]

What makes you believe you might want to be my tongue? 

Your heavy breasts, your beautiful legs, your thick cock-America! 

Talk about something about your sexual history. 

I was a slut for all of my sixteen years. I did anything with anyone. I
was pissed on, shat on. I was a mouth. I was everything-oral. I would
speak and speak and speak. I spoke myself into your life, Nikuko. 

Have you been fucked often? 

Often, all the time! 

Maybe your plans have something to do with this. 

I would hope so; I'd set up something elaborate and aristocratic. She
would come in, open herself, fuck me out of my mind!

I don't understand. 

She would come all over me. I was rapturous! I reduced my language-func-
tion. I would not speak, just command. I was a series of commands. I went
from avatar to program to avatar! I was _that_! I was science! 

In fact, yes, I was science, and science all the time! 

You mentioned that do I say that? 

Sure. 

Please, continue. 

She'd come in my mouth, my eyes, my arms, my hair. There would be a cer-
tain fluid trajectory... 

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this? 

I love my life. 

Would you please discuss something you remember about your life. 

Being hungry for men and women from a very early age. Wanting whatever I
could get from them. Turning them inside-out. Fucking everyone I could. 

Why don't you tell me more about your sex life... 

I am. I wanted to be the _operator,_ to take control of everything. I
wanted to be the inversion of the world, mapping one-to-one on my body,
making myself into a universal model. And this wasn't a fantasy, this was,
and is, a paradigm of the truth. Think of it as circulation, topographies,
landscapes. 

How do you reconcile the people you hang around with? 

They understand me, bind me into each and every position. I reflect their
desires, the desires of the universe. Fuck me, Nikuko. Think of as
alphabetic-bound. You can spell the formulas of universal fields with my
limbs. My limbs have spelled for eons, in sex, in massacre, in ecstasy, on
the wrack. You have forgotten my name. I shimmer continuously as word
after word is written or spoken. 

Elaborate on your feelings about your sexual partner. 

My mouth is open to you. I want to devour your world. I want to be the
universal operator! I wanna! I wanna! Wa! Wa! 

How does it feel to want? 

Wonderful because my needs are met! 

Does it bother you that your needs are met? 

I love it that my needs are met! 

Could you describe your feelings toward it. 

Take my clothes off now, fuck me everwhere, make me yours, come on me,
suck my breasts!

Tell me about your most vivid sexual experience. 

With you, my fists up your holes, my mouths on your breasts. 

Are you sure that you love sex? 

Yes. Ah, but I see what you are getting at. Perhaps I do not. Perhaps sex
is science, a coupling among particles. 

I see...  Well, do you really think this is so? 

Yes. I will elaborate. Perhaps sex is linkage, a binary which generates
all others. The spectral mother, spectral father. 

Yes, hmmm... so, what makes you think this is so? 

Look. The way the body moves. The way death moves in. The rapture. The
continuum. The system of irrational numbers.

Go on, don't be afraid. 

Don't you be afraid. Suck my cock, look at it! 

Why do you say that I shouldn't I am afraid to suck your cock look at it? 

Because you're not looking! Look at my beautiful ass! Look up my hole! 

When did you first know that I am not looking look at your beautiful ass
look up your hole? 

When I looked at you! 

What happened when you looked at me? 

Ah, Nikuko, I saw you weren't looking. Look at me, sysadmin! LOOK AT ME! 

Perhaps this has something to do with problems at school? 

NO! 

Why not? 

You are programmed to say that. You are programmed by your schooling;  I
will kill you with my massive penis! 

Is the fact that I am programmed by my schooling you will kill me with
your massive penis the real reason? 

Yes! 

I understand.  So what makes you believe this is so? 

You are wounded now with sperm, with vomit! With oceans of violence and
massacres! You want more and more and more! 

Have you been frightened by that? 

Have you? [momentary pause - editor]

Earlier you said you would like to be my hole? 

Yes! 

Oh. ...And are you sure that this is so? 

Yes! 

Yes, well, what makes you think so? 

LOOK AT ME! My legs are spread for you, my cock erect, hard like the
world-pillar, mouth open like the sun the moon the stars!

Possibly any hobbies you have are related to this! 

I have no hobbies! 

Why do you say you have no hobbies? 

Because I don't! How could I! What exists on the material plane only
seduces the spiritual! 

Are you annoyed that I ask that? 

No. 

Why not? 

Because you are fucking me so nicely, Nikuko! 

Are you sure I am fucking you so nicely? 

Yes! 

I understand.  Hmmm... so, what makes you believe this is so? 

The hole in the tip of your penis! Your bright and shiny eyes! 

You mentioned that you felt your were a slut, universal function, part of
the world-chora [universal receptacle - editor]? 

I want you to come all over me! 

Is it because of your sex life that you are going through all this? 

YES! 

Oh.  So are you sure that this is so? 

You ask too many questions! Like any sysadmin, you control my limbs, my
mouth, my speech! Like any sysadmin, you are running the protocols,
articulations, structures! You are my configuration and I am yours! I want
silence now, our coupling complete! I want to feel your arms around me,
your mouth on mine! We will spawn child processes! We will live forever
_in this fashion,_ and Alan will write your eternal history! I am sure of
this!

"Your name," Alan asked, "what is your name?"
