No, don't you do that. Don't you do that. Don't you slap my hand.
No, don't you walk that way. Don't you street the street. And don't
You corner the corner. If you corner the corner, you whichaway.
And don't you whichaway.

If you slap my hand, then you mouth my palm. Then you fill my mouth
And you speak to me. And you say this, Thus. And you say, Thus this.
If you speak to me. If I hear you speak. Don't you whichaway.

Don't you throw that rock. Don't you dare that rock. That rock goes
Whichaway. That rock goes down the road. Don't you touch that rock.
If you touch that rock you will hear from me. You will hear from me
If you touch that rock.

If there's a million years. If there's a billion years. That the rock
Will hug. That the rock joins the rock. That it is itself. Don't you 
Tell it that. Don't you speak to it.

That it's in your hand. That you slap my hand. That my hand signs you.
That you read the signs. That you turn the corner. That the corner

Dream of the Planet, Something Else


All day all night I search for driven images, image drivers, cutting deep
into files gouged out of binaries, splattered across equidistant grains
refusing resolution. They move and sputter across the screen; someone from
Japan gestures impotently at this lurker nude and detumescent as male after
male presences himself in front of dulled and shuttered eyes. Later I turn
back to planets, marbles run dark, despairing across the screen, sixty-one
million bytes for the inaugural of shuffling Mars. Reading Kristeva's anal-
ysis of the drives among psyche and somatic,* I think blood and spears cut-
ting, deleting file after file. I am sinking into a miasma of the visual
which refuses to relinquish its hold upon the real, in spite of packaging
turning towards emptiness and noise in the depths.

Noise held down. I move across a field, a frame, return to the frame, con-
dense or hold the field, monochrome the image, store/unstore it, but I am
concerned about the _driver,_ non-interoperability, incommensurability,
nothing fits as the real turns into the purity of _technique._ Which is 
what I mean by techne defined by the _core_ which itself suddenly pulls an
ontological shift: guess what, the real as video chips, simms, cpus, and
other fauna of the machinic suddenly come to life...

(The planets _glow,_ edges slough from the rim, datagrams pouring off their
sides, uneasy dreams... I toss and turn in a planet-dory, oars smattered
against the vacuum; they're tethered. Moving them (three-hundred-meter oars
disappearing into the darkness around us), I push against their inert mass,
whiplashed by discordant interiorities - I can almost hear the chattering 
of the oars, responding chattering of the stars themselves... This is the 
_metaphor of the boat,_ I dream the boat a body, scaled back by raster-
matched, recombinant compression DNAs. Planets roll down the length of the
hull; they enter me bilged and swollen. My cock is rudder and keel, my eyes
prow the surface of the sea, and conditions worsen.)

*Kristeva holds to Freud, oh vicissitudes; my semen coats the sea like oil;
Jesus walks on it.

Carol


Carol: After thirty-five years, I never heard from her again.* I remain
the bumbling fool I must have been in high-school. It's true, I sent her
my book (Disorders of the Real) with a personal note in it. This work is
the least offensive of all... But perhaps it proved too much? Nothing,
not a word back - and I even signed it for her! Or signed it over - after
all, she didn't ask me! The Net is so much safer, none of these misunder-
standings, nothing but a quick delete, or someone writing in the night:
Do you write to strangers? This enticement... 

But Carol was face to face, _there,_ and I shuffled around, holding my
breath. I saw her... first in Venice, I waited for the car to pull up! 
I ran over to her, walked actually - I was afraid to run. She's tall...
And face to face... I didn't know what to say, but words came quickly -
perhaps too quickly, too much too soon. And her reserve, the _enigma,_
was there as always, remarkably short of passion - I wrote her about this
too, a letter in the book, accompanying it. Oh, I worried over that let-
ter, worked over it, it was a labor of love... Sent out two weeks ago
perhaps - she was to send me something she's writing on.

And then? Nothing, nothing, nothing, and my face and body collapse, just
like they did years ago, decades ago, a full third of a century, time
enough for hundreds of histories in fact. My soul becomes painful, twis-
ted all over again. And her silence isn't even deafening, it's a state of
non-existence, she isn't there, that's all, there's a gap in the world
which nothing will fill. And I feel like such a fool, wasting my money on
the postage, carefully packing book and letter up, my heart beating, 
sending them on their way through the mail, air-mail even. I don't even
have many of the books left! The mail remains empty day after day, after
day, and Carol has disappeared once and forever more. Another thirty-five
years, perhaps... I'll take her address out of my book, there's no reason
to torture myself any longer - it makes no sense. 

It's over; I won't live that long.

---------------------------------

*Remember? I told you about her, high-school friend, actress, I searched
for her, lost track... Then, I'm speaking at Beyond Baroque in Venice,
California, she shows up that afternoon, she'd seen publicity, knew every-
thing all at once...

Julia


"Hence, although the interest that psychoanalysts have in the linguistic
and translinguistic expression of psychic determinants can sometimes make
analysis appear abstract, this abstraction ends up personalizing each 
treatment as much as possible. Each treatment becomes an ideolect, a work
of art, as well as a temporary installation of a new theoretical creation 
within the Freudian world. As a result, we would like to know which fea-
tures of this discourse can be identified with Freudian thought, as well 
as where we can draw the line between loyalty, innovation, and dissension.

"The history of the analytic movement combined with the current ecumenism 
of its tenets (Freudian, Kleinian, Winnicottian, Lacanian, and so forth),
shows that despite various misunderstandings and impasses, Freud has 
staked out a path that all innovators must respect if they lay claims to
psychoanalysis. It is admittedly a narrow path, one in which sexual exper-
ience resists language." ...

(Kristeva, New Maladies of the Soul.)

Always this appearance of structure in the name, Freud in this instance,
identity and loyalty which has no parallel beyond those institutions pro-
mulgating discipleship; it is this analysis which "never lets go" (Rous-
tang) that lends itself to the American inability to _represent_ to the
extent that, for example, Baudrillard becomes precisely that grounding of
the simulacrum that forgets and reifies him simultaneously. For Julia, as
if there were no thought without the name, precisely the name-of-the-father
which resonates top to bottom with structure...

Think of it as a protocol suite, layered, well-defined. Think of it as a 
substrate still resonant above the chora, Father-name splitting into the 
hundreds of thousands of addressing throughputs in the routers. So that 
there is a dispersion known as TCP/IP: which never lets go. Do protocols 
function as unconscious, in relation to the ascii unconscious I described 
in Third Sex? Hardly; they are automated as mobile structure themselves, 
invisible touchpoints. But Freud is visible in name and flesh, Kristeva's 
passion and resurrection, where theory lends itself to articulation of 
language and somatic phenomena.

Carried on the wind. Sprockets. This post. Frames. Out against the. 
Control track. The wires of which my fingers. Blood under the nails. I 
throw them out. The post. Which carries my skin slit. Words pour from the 
wounds. Which claw at the wires. 

You see how it is, words, wires, wounds, wind. The wires wrap themselves 
around me; it's that which stiffens my cock, holds it in place. This is 
the secret of males; this _holds it._ When we speak. When we are silent 
or when it collapses.

The words heat the wires. The helix was born. The cunt churns through the 
central core: core of MUD, kernel of Unix: wireless, the wind packages 
itself. 

"O hurry wind!" the little fishermen say as the wind froths their tiny 
oceans, whipping their rods taut with the energy of the deep. "O I am 
such wind!" say the little fisherwomen, casting their nets into the 
thinnest ridge of all, that between the anus and base of the testicles.

The ridge is where the words joined the words. All three sexes have it. 
The ridge slopes down where the wound wires wounded, the base of the 
musculature of the legs. 

There where the mud seethed from the hole. Where the bloody fingers held 
the glove of the post. Where the post searched itself for you. Where you 
held a memory. Where I was.

L'Etranger


He didn't appear crazy or homeless or within any other urban category. He
always stood there, outside, an Algerian or Egyptian, I believed, doing
nothing, either against the wall of the unemployment office or within the
subway. The nothing included tics, vocal mannerisms, smiles, gestures of
any sorts; his eyes followed no one, looking neither in nor out, hardly
blank. He would stand in spaces neither liminal nor central, focal; he
placed himself or was placed nowhere at all. His dress was nondescript. 
He refused both the name and the cipher, and never appeared to be waiting,
either for someone else or for drugs or other _materiel._ He did not exist
as _neither_ nor as presence nor absence; he was there without presence,
but without its absence as well. There was nothing that was was nothing
and there was something that was something and nothing as well. But it was
never interstitial, nor was there time. 

Because there was no time, there was the occurrence, continuous, and you
can find him now still present at Pacific Street and Fifth Avenue in the
Borough of Brooklyn in the City of New York in the state of the same name
in the totality of the United States of America north, just beneath Canada
against any sort of weather. You can find him near the unemployment of-
fice, but it is clear that he has no _relation_ to it whatsoever, never
entering nor leaving it, nor speaking to the people who enter or leave it,
or simply pass it by. You can find him on the stairs of the subway, or 
just in the vicinity of the turnstiles, but standing not so as to see 
down the subway corridor itself or to wait for anyone; you can find him 
at the base of the stairs, near one wall across from which is another, 
and nothing else but something which is the space between. You can find 
him nowhere else but most of the time you could find him.

News


The news is that the water wants to be the water. The news is that the 
water no longer touches the shores of the Harbor of New York. The news is 
that it wants to be the memory of the water, always plural in the Hebrew, 
always replete with water.

It had the memory of the water, the news goes on to say, that it wants to 
become again. It had the memory, the news goes on to say, that spread 
from shoal to shoal, reef to reef, vent to vent. It wanted to be the 
water again, that's all there was to it, the news went on to say.

All that the news had to say was that it remained off shore, that the 
water remained off shore. All the news said was that it had remembered 
and no longer wanted to be on shore at the Harbor of New York. All the 
news said was that it wanted to be the memory of the water.

Origins of Anti-Semitism


Obviously this has been on my mind; it was on Lenny Bruce's. I can't buy 
any longer into the relationship of A-S, my initials, to the Crucifixion 
which never led to the disparagement of the Italians - far from it, the 
Vatican the locus of that ecstatic intensity which I believe calls for 
the examination of the other end of the body, its origin, feet, or birth. 
For it is the grounding of Christ in Judaism, the infant problematic, 
that constructs a legacy of hatred, the Jews representing the _stain_ of 
the birth in the body (and the crooked hook-nosed Jew leaves the legacy 
of the crooked hook-nosed Christ, who threw out the money-lenders but not 
the religion). I am sure of this, the birth uncovering the birth, anti- 
semitism recovering the birth which becomes simultaneously present and 
effaced. What about this body, this somaticism of Kristeva's which still 
requires Freud, of course, but even there an origin castrated from its 
sources? 

Christ increasingly becomes the subject-object, the _jectivity,_ of
ecstatic passion, the enfolding across, crossing, the Virgin Mary who is
reduced all the way back from the inheritance of the father. The Josephs,
Arimathea included, disappear, Mary Magdalene recuperates without loss
(except in the gnostic Philip, another but central story), the apostles
are graduate students, Christ becomes the focal-point of medieval anorexic
sainthood - and what would the Jew be, but a reminder, much as the parents
of a rock star occupy an interstitial position always already apologetic,
forgotten except to autobiographers. 

With Christ the need arose early for the simultaneous presentification 
and effacement of the origin, an impossibility - which then becomes the 
impossibility of the Jew - which the _signifier_ of the Jew _is._

The Marys get lost in the process, recuperated themselves for the simul-
taneous effacement of sexuality (Mary's a virgin, Mary's no longer a 
whore) and its presence in the ecstatic union with Christ, burrowing out 
through the feet of one body, up through the marrow, brains, and halo of 
the Other...

Travis does a Wide Area Information Search and Retrieves Something!


I think you should know that I have cyberspace for sale, not the entrance,
not the exit, but the space and the place itself, that it's down by the
swamp there where the hosts and the legions of servers are there for you
to serve, for you to serve and be served,

And it won't cost you more than a dime of your time, but the money, Honey,
that's another thing, you'll see the packets whizzing by on the fly, you'll
breathe in and one thing or another will happen, it will make all the pa-
pers, and you'll breathe out in a great shout and your name will be there,
your name will be everywhere

And the legions of servers will be routed and returned, echoed across the
wires and fibers of pure information, and you'll have a perfect body of
that, you know, just a perfect body - you can't imagine how perfect the
skill will look - so that you should just produce a little bit of cash,

So the carving can begin, you'll have your own great state in no time, can
have another star on the flag if you like, it's nowhere at once, can have
your name on it - you'd like that, wouldn't you -

The beautiful girl stood by the side of the Ferris Wheel wondering who Mr.
Ferris was and how he got to fly so high that he touched the sky and didn't
die, he didn't. The beautiful girl had long black hair, eyebrows bridged
all the way from one site to another and the angelic hosts played teardrops
from up above down below.

Mr. Abernathy doffed his hat. Travis watched all of it, gathered Honey into
his lean muscular arms, and whispered that he'd win another stuffed animal 
if he did anything at all. He was good with a gun but faster with the joy-
stick or boystick as he called it. His sailor uniform matched the cirrus 
clouds girdling the sky.

The girl said there weren't enough domain numbers to go around, everything
was going down. Sell them again, then, the men said, some of them are dead,
you can have a split, it makes no difference. She said well she said.

She said that when that happened that there would be a-weaving and a-sewing
and everyone would share skin and bone and hair. And that would be fine
with her, with her long black hair, there was enough to make a pair. What
was for sale would go from the keeper to the reaper, from the administrator
to the fornicator. Everyone would benefit.

There was cotton candy on the little boy's fingers; he lingers in the shad-
ow of the sideshow. Travis felt cynical, no, he didn't. The girl walked 
away in the dusk that was gathering in the hemline of the evening's cur-
tain. Mr. Abernathy felt for his cravat, fell for the girl, folding into
her just as the names coalesced. Wasn't there a need to feel even further?

The wide area information search had just expanded, nodded to the node, 
contracted just a little bit in the great state with Travis' name on it.
It would be the State of Travis which had the little boy girl Mr. Honey
everywhere around in a single sound. They'd move elsewhere, there was the
Cyclone and the 'Lectric Cars, and the streetlamps made of lime. What a
show for a day when the Tattooed Lady gave him a kiss on the noggin! Sam
danced a little jig all his own! The little boy was sure he made it up!

come to me


How many of us are bored, looking for danger, wanting the secret post in
the middle of the night, as I said, do you speak to strangers, as I said,
help me help me, as I said, do you do fantasy? These demarcate fields of
play, moments of hysteresis outlining the boundaries of things; and how
many of us hope that the next post will be the last, that nothing further
need be said, that everything is either out of control or under control,
that it is _this_ post, like the book I keep trying to read, which tells
the truth, sutures the body, heals the lame and halt?

It would be the next post, the secret post, and if that, the one after,
such posts carrying the great burden of the interstice in the midst of the
pornographic, breath held until the orgasm from which one never recovers.
Here the symphonic tends towards death itself, but it is not death which
the post conveys, only the grounds of meaning, circulations which need no
other justification.

Waiting for the existence of this existence-post, for meaning and being 
are intertwined, one settles for the magic-post, of the same or other 
era, as time is no longer culpable. The waiting collapses time, collapses
the interstice; one is born, looks around, dies: [   ]. But it is the 
boredom which plays itself out in _specificities_ here, I mean that of the
Internet email list as an example, this particular set of lists or this 
list at this moment in particular. So I would say: we are all waiting,
resplendent and capable of seduction, a double flux - we _await_ you, her-
alded by a particular post, that which will be the next, touching us in
our hearts of hearts,

That post naked and alone, which will be ours, which will have arrived in 
the midst of our files, neither looking to the left nor to the right, bor-
ing down upon us; that post which we swallow in our dreams, which spreads
among the seas and shores of the untoward chasms of the body, that tsunami 
post, awash in the debris of our uncanny:

This hidden text, this unknown text, is concerned with the _economy_ of
the post, magic, secret, existence, the _economy_ of this text coming to
you, heralded, unheralded.

Spell


Spreading my body open, letters, graphs, descriptions of all sorts, poured
forth from my hole, first the S, then the p followed by the r; shortly af-
ter, the e, then the a followed by the d, i, n, in that order, g lending
itself to the following space beginning the m which was shortly followed by
the y and then, behold, an other space, then a b to be sure, an o, a d,
succeeded by a y and another space, more to the point of the o leading to
the p, the e, the n, after which a mark of punctuation, , followed by that
blank space portending a recommencement heralded by an l, an e, then two
ts in whatever order they desired, it made no difference, subsequently an
e producing the effect of an r and an s, then immediately another comma, ,
and the whole thing begins again with a g, subsequently r and an a leading
to the p ...

And to cut into this infinity, my legs spread to the utmost, my hole divi-
ding into one, two, many holes, into a fractal dissonance of holes, my
ear enlarged, reaching down towards the vicinity of their rims, where I
could just perceive, sustained, the h, the s, followed by the pause and
silence of the comma, the huge space or chiasm bridging the arrival of the
third d, the fourth e, the fourth s, and my tongue as well

And to cut this into finitude, sustained elongation towards many, many 
holes, only to twist within and without the rim, seduce the rim, bend the
rim towards the mouth, towards speech, towards the reception of the c, the
r, the i, and I had better slow to a halt here, at this point of the tongue
or other organ, this clitoral or vaginal movement, silencing the sound
which the ear caresses, dimming the light on the chiaroscuro blush of the
rims, opening only into the murmuring of touch, the whispering of taste,
the almost inaudible smell, musk, fragrant, the p of pleasure, the t of
tongue, the i of sight, the o of elongated breathing coming to an n ...
s reverberant, space

Dark Nighttime Thoughts With Beautiful Thoughts Opening Up


(Every night I work on these texts, appearing as posts, and this work is
necessarily a _work-of-writing,_ which I am considering as well in its
entirety. This consideration involves resonance, the cross-referencing of
these texts on a theoretical and literary/narratological level. And 
throughout all of this, there are always these fears.)

That I will never learn anything but no longer have the herb to speak.
That I will recline in the force of memories and the glances of the dead.
That my writings will descend into nonsense without their customary edge.
That I will no longer understand the language of canyons and arroyos.
That my writings will be buried, forgotten, the labor of delusions.
        in the land of the labor of delusions.
That my writings my limbs will be broken and burned.
That I will never feel passion for someone again, or she for me.
That my senses, eyes, bodies will close down, dissolved into the thing.
That I will never celebrate the year 2000 or the year 3000.
Or that I forget the knowledge I have and its endless ambulations.
        ambulatory river blood stiff-walking on double legs.
Or that my wager with this knowledge and descent will be lost.
That my eyes will forget my eyes, my ears forget the space of birth.
That everyone will die around me.
That it is conceivable that my language admits of nothing but conception.
Or that there is a gift or a tool for this language, breaking it on rocks.
Or that I will never see a coyote again in the wild, or another tornado.
        tornado mouth of river blood tongue in ambulatory lands.
That vibrating words transform into noise in the midst of nuclear plasma.
That I speak only to myself; disillusioned, that I am filled with lies.
That my writing will descend to the anecdotal, that I will settle for this.
That my writing will become effect, sparks, not the kernel of absence.
Or that my depressions and sorrows will blind me to truth's absence also.
        to truth's blue-dark tornados of blood-blue dissolutions.
Or that I will find or lose meaning in the presence of the past.
Or that I no longer can swallow the beautiful thoughts of the night.

(I would say that every text is _occasioned_ by these fears, but not that
these fears are the occasion of every text.)

Theoretical Work in the Internet Text (Locations)


Everthing I write must be read with this doubled meaning:
0. Clara Hielo Internet.
avatar of the uncanny scattered throughout her text
1. Concepts of address, protocol, recognition: the tuning of subjectivity,
instrumental reason.
from the very beginnings of the Internet Text, these terms focused upon
the entrancing and frameworks of cyberspace, first files
2. Rewrite and the opening of the space of the I: inscription and fissure.
nearly the very beginnings, inscribing which continues and thins throughout
the other texts, the alphabetic as well
3. Emission, spew, and sourceless/targetless communications.
focused upon well early enough, presencing of speaking without author or
text through until and beyond the end
4. Hysterical embodiment and the variants of reading the other.
third sexualities located from the middle of the Net files on, centered in
the alphabetic texts
5. Synesthesia and the transformations of senses across the Net.
substratum everywhere in the Net and alphabetic texts, discomforts of the
body against the particulation of the symbolic, stuttering of packets
6. Defuge, burnouts and anomies on the Net.
recently, and harbored primarily within the alphabetic, wandering against
theory which refuses the function of the suture or I.
7. Third sex and the ascii unconscious.
beginning early on, circulations, and stuttering, Tiffay, Travis, others,
narratologies as well, recent focus within the alphabetic texts.
8. The uncanny/imaginary, fantasms, and the reading/jectivity of the other.
increasingly relying on borderline states, what could only be imagined in
the Net files, descending into the substance of the imaginary in the more
recent work.
9. Communities and communalities on the Net.
mid-sections coming together with false promises, premises, delusions, the
largest middle-third of the work harboring occasional files.
10. Disruptions of community and self, web inversion and power.
conflagrations and violent outbreaks, deaths and dissolutions, from the
mid-early Net texts on to the present.
11. Liquidities of identity, identity shifting, shape-riding.
Travis and others occupying the final science fiction stories going nowhere.
12. Appearances of cybermind elsewhere in literary/philosophical texts.
intensity of recent investigations in which the textual body and the body 
of texts simultaneously presence the curlicue on the margins, almost
afterthoughts.
13. The phenomenology of the architecture of the Net TCP/IP itself.
running through the fourth and fifth sevenths of the total work, concerns
about Net sentience and the clean and proper bodies of the datagrams.
14. The chora/maternal: towards the symbolic, murmur/stutter of the world.
more recently, emerging with emergence, the convolutions of a text breaking
in upon itself, the splintering and stuttering of the teeth and tongue.
15. The presymbolic as an interpretation or regression from the symbolic.
everywhere in the more recent work, where text devolves into non-text,
where politics begin with the word and endlessly end off-screen.
16. Addictions, censorships, obscenities, and other topical issues.
addictions always already from the endings of the first few files, but the
obscene a continuous return, aware of the politics "beginning with the 
word."
17. Death on and off the Net, the physical body as obdurate and/or residue.
from several files in, real and imaginary deaths, the deaths of texts and
spaces later and later on.
18. Virtual or veiled subjectivity, phenomenology and psychoanalytics.
all the way through the Net files and alphabetic texts, the subject 
approached and withdrawn, introjections and projections merging into the
wares of the terminally-screened.
19. Detemporalizations and the problematic of time in the virtual subject.
recent thinkings towards the center of the alphabetic texts, the last few,
destabilizations, the beyond of the earlier Net files, groping towards a
theoretical resolution.
20. Generalized mesaure geometries and dissipative communications.
the computer-program texts in the Net files, concentrating in particular on
the series fgfffgfgfgfffgfffgfffgfgfgfffgfg... and its relation to the lost
almost-symmetries of Net exchanges.
21. Phenomenology of emotional states, behaviors, and discourses on the Net.
everywhere beneath and upon the surface of the files.
23. Source and phenomenologies of the voice, mouth, organs.
everywhere beneath and upon the surface of the files, breaking-out in the
midst of the other, narratological descents.
24. Phenomenology of cyberspace, of its "inhabiting."
everywhere again within and without the totality of texts and files.
25. Looping, blackholes, the blind password, the 'great beyond.'
in the earlier works, and in the middle seventh, reoccurring losses in the
occasion of the framework itself and those farsighted enough to delimit
the absent boundaries of these multiply-closed multiple topologies.
26. Events in cyberspace: wars, peace, origins, dissolutions.
irruptions when they occur; they manifest themselves as tears in the fabric
of the hole, which is sutured upon them; a certain hollowness pervades.
27. Part-objects, entities, proper-names, and totalizations in cyberspace.
the fourth and fifth seventh moving through the name in relation to the
earliest accounts in the Net files of the same.
28. The granularity of the real.
the first three-sevenths of the Net text and alphabetic files, carrying the
memory of its beginning, the initial post, the surrounding terminal screen,
the dawn of the night and dusk of the relative day.
29. Relationships of the above to everyday life, philosophy and sociology.
drawn forth in a process of withdrawing, throughout the textual domain.

"or they're not sure of their virtuality"


Tiffanys want to be sure about herself, the edges in her mirror, her
breath on a cold day, her sounds her feet make in the snow, her shadow of
her body against her lover. Her space was full, and there was so much to
do!  Her life, like ours, a question-mark.

"'Their vision came all at once. Perfectly they saw, perfectly they knew
everything under the sky, whenever they looked. The moment they turned
around and looked around in the sky, on the earth, everything was seen
without any obstruction. They didn't have to walk around before they could
see what was under the sky; they just stayed where they were.' And there
is more: 

"'Their sight passed through trees, through rocks, through lakes, through 
seas, through mountains, through plains.' And finally:

"'They sighted the four sides, the four corners in the sky, on the earth,'
so says the Ancient Word. 

"Their limits, then, were those of the world itself. The only thing such
beings might miss would be something that lay outside what sky and earth
could comprehend - or 'skyearth' as the Book often has it written, bring-
ing the world to a single word. Or else these beings might miss something
that happened even faster than they could turn their heads to look around,
or look up in the air or into the earth. Whatever space may have been for
them, it was no more than turnings and twistings of their heads; there was
no need for the measures of hand or foot. Whatever time may have been, it
was no more than the time it took to do those twistings and turnings" ...

Psychotopography


Nietzsche isn't working, neither Holderlin nor Wagner, nor destiny, nothing
superceded; the directions of the four-fold world encompass the folds and
hems of a white tablecloth, slightly uplifted at the corners. Neither above
nor below:
                                here
                    -----------------------------
                                 we

Nor the quality of those divisions which suture the text as a totality; in
its place are multiply-connected lines, dispersions, with _tendencies,_ and
the tendences, tropisms, tropologies, lend themselves towards speakers and
listeners. This is a form of circulations, eddies, not turbulence and not
flows necessarily, but locales, intensifications where processings are ac-
complished: the acts of reading and writing, further acts of decoding and
filtering. So that _identities_ are equivalences to a degree, and there is
no space to occupy, but the speaking of your own space in the midst of the
speaking of the space of others.

It's worthwhile to understand this, the absence of circumscription, and in
this fashion the MOOs and MUDs are already antiquated, relying on sets of
rules, broken or not, delimitations and centralized storage. Elsewhere, I
connect to you or vice versa, and this is not even always already a negot-
iation, as it might be in real physical space, real hard space, but some-
thing done with a degree of lag, picking up the debris, searching through
whatever residue has been left behind of a day or a week or a month; you
may or may not know that I have been there, presenced you, just as adverti-
sing occurs for the _they_ who no longer announce themselves. There is no
site for such an announcement, not necessarily a need. One can imagine an
advertisement in fact requiring nothing, not even testimonial or conceptual
presence, but something operative on the level of problematic being, a dif-
ferent category in relation to capital.

But here this arrives with you, and it is broken on its way, taking many
paths perhaps, a skein rather than a road, hardly a high-way much less a
superhigh-way, ultrahigh-way, these terms reflecting more the metaphor of
governing: us | them or here | we in the vertical, than the reality of 
multiple, fragmentary, momentary connections, intelligent connections which
not only connect but _perform connectivity._ And what has this to do with
the foundations of the classic nation-state, with its barriers, walls,
taxes, tolls, tariffs, visas, passports, protocols (diplomatic and other-
wise) designed for simultaneous communication and separation? Only that the
local _now_ prevails, a local in which there is no territory to be won or
lost, no capital accumulation, only the flood of platelets through the 
supine and unrecognizable body of the Net, with its holes and probes and
penetrations, with its caresses and discontinuities. It is not that Bey's
temporary autonomous zones need be established or dissolved; it is that the
net itself _zones,_ unfolds, in a manner that outstrips circumscription.

So the Nietzschian model, the Deleuze-Guattarian model, all fall short;
what happens to lines of flight when they're transformed into packets and
there are no routes but thinking through destinations, circulations, clus-
ters? and what happens to far-sight, when all sites become a matter of pro-
tocols, and what happens to protocol when it no longer separates, but is
destined for a destination? That all destinations are approachable? That
passwords are only necessary for those concealments of power that travel
elsewhere or beneath the Net, that PGP and other encryptions themselves 
meander throughout the same or similar skeining?

This is not even a form of democracy, given conditions of access and clos-
ure, but it is different than nation, which we have become accustomed to
over several centuries, and so occupies a different phenomenology, one
giving notice to empire and boundary. The lesson is this: in order for com-
munication to succeed, the boundary _necessarily_ splinters, like an active
and temporary membrane always already in the process of dissolution. How 
can we think in such a space/skein, and how can we think through it?

Dot-Org


Nietzsche fumbled through the spittle of remembering the shapes he was
riding. Fuck them. He didn't believe that had anything but jelly. He knew
about the jelly. The jelly threatened to swamp him. "That way lies non-
sense," he'd learned that from Heidegger maybe, Kristeva's cleansed body,
the Parmenides certainly. Or was it Kristeva's cleansed boy? The boy was
lovely shaved, skin inscribed with Nietzsche's troubled dreams;  he'd
fucked his sister, moved his language everywhere across her. But he wrote
bad, what was that he had said. 

The contusions were breaking out across his body, he needed AIDS. He
fumbled, German yes, but weren't they, it was like a Jew calling kike,
he'd loved the Jews, yes, slavered over them, like Lyotard or brother
Blanchot. He fucked Lyotard, liked the man, what a devil. Something moved
in the corner. He'd do the posts he figured until everything got lost. His
asshole whimpered the way of women. 

His asshole whimpered and he knew he was a woman and a Jew. Nietzsche
laughed, there wasn't any difference, both menstruated, had their periods
of blood and doubt. He _ached_ there, he _ached_ there. He did his walk
across the room again. He sat down in the chair again and began to write
again. The pen wouldn't cum the paper. He made a line again. He wrote a 
word again, .org then tore it up. There was nothing to finish the word. 

His sister the Jew spoke to him, spittle. She says: .org. His body caves 
in. He can't write good. He can't write well. He makes marks. He marks 
his cock. He knows about the jelly. Overman breaks the pen. Ubermensch 
drills the hole. Superman cuts the skin. He bleeds like the Jews, men and 
women. He stuffs his holes. There are more holes. He can't stuff them 
fast enough. He can't write either.

Dear Everyone,


I am going to take a break from the texts, maybe an hour or a day, maybe
forever. I have written five- to six-hundred within the past year and a
half, focusing on cyberspace, cybermind, and the result is evident to
anyone who has been to my page off of Spoon's home-page. This is an
impossibly bulky work, and I constantly wonder its effect, if any; I am
looking for a publisher for at least part of it at the moment. It has
extended my ability to work through difficult philosophical issues, since
I set for myself a heavy rate of production. I have refused to settle for
simple solutions to problems of virtuality, and the pieces have had to
simultaneously cast their own shadow, and resonate with the others. I find
myself empty in relation to solutions in general, except in tightly-
defined domains, where solutions are all but impossible to avoid, the
necessary consequences built into the apparatus from the beginning. So
that what has developed is an odd discourse, which has kept me returning
to the notion of the chora or receptacle, not as a waste-basket, but as a
pre-oedipal or pre-symbolic staging-area where I can work out the origins
and their lack, of inscription. I do believe that reading the hundreds of
texts, ordered/disordered as they are, is more than instructive; I wrote
with my understanding that they had a worth in relation to one another,
and in relation to philosophy or literature in general. They may disappear
in their electronic frailty, which worries me, as if the weight of a book 
carried more consequence, and perhaps it does. 

Now that I have stated thus, I search for new material, new texts. And
there are sound and images as well at the home-page tethered to Spoons,
since I am working through the non-inscript non-descript, 7-bit ascii
extended into the imaginary flux of the senses. What else? That another
text will surely follow this, and another as well, that the habit of
writing, for me, has become the constant habit of thinking and of thought
as well, that I am chained to it, just as I am chained to writing and
speaking everywhere and for all time. Without this prisonhouse of language
I would never be able to affect the escape into sound, image, and even my 
existence as something desirable, worthwhile. Another text will follow.

Confession of Writing

I write because if I don't, I'd kill myself. I write because I don't want 
to think of my past. I write because I had good times then and depression
now and I don't want to think of the good times. I think because I don't
want to think. I write because something will bring back a memory and I
don't want memory, nothing from my life. I write because I was alive once.
I write because I can never figure out enough. I write because there is no
other reason for my cyborg existence. I write because if I don't I'll fall
out the window. I write because if I stop I place the bag over my head,
set fire to the world. I write because the saying of the world stops the
world. I write because I don't want the world to stop. I write because I
am without hope. I write because the earth becomes darker with each passing
year. I write because there is no culture, no first, second, third cul-
tures, no first, second, third, fourth, fifth worlds. I write because there
are photographs I cannot look at, images that surround me, haunt me, invade
my dreams. I write because I am invaded. And I write because I do not know
the truth about this, or any other thing.

ARHALU: Archives, Rupture, Homer, Alexandria's Library Unmentioned


Unknown to me, the migraine is just beginning.

"We went to the tomb of Tjanefer, who had been the third priest of Amun. 
We opened it and brought out his inner coffins and took his mummy and left
it in a corner of his tomb. The inner coffins we took in the boat, along
with the rest, to the Island of Amenhotep, and we set fire to them in the
night and made off with the gold which we found on them; four _kite_ fell
to the lot of each man." 

(Ancient Lives, Daily Life in Egypt of the Pharaohs, John Romer)

What is the point? Only that this occurred three thousand years ago, that
there was a desert village near Thebes where the workmen who built the
Pharaonic tombs lived. That this circulated around a series of names which
appeared all over the village, graffiti, hieroglyphs, incisions, there and
elsewhere, that this is a window for us into families and politics. That
the window shut, that there are ruptures between them and ourselves; a
chapter ends "We know nothing about Ankhefenamun's household, or his
brothers, or their descendants: the entire family disappears: how tenuous
our connection with these people, how valuable the ancient frag- ments of
their lives." We are disconnected from Medea and Phaedra, from Samson or
Delilah, from any names one might place in one's lineage. There are
breaks, ][, gaps which foreclose, Roots which are always already in
abeyance; only by tethering names to names do we exist. I don't believe
any of this, I believe all of it. The names are our records, stuff our
mouths with religious ecstasy. I am receiving preliminary migraine visual
anomalies writing this: the screen skips incisions: I become catatonic. 
There is no recourse to history: I die: ecstatic. 

The screen develops an untoward depth. I wish I could tell you more about 
this. At night, files appear to me in my dreams: they're tagged. ][ tags 
everything which is why the stuffing of archives is important. To this, I 
would say, who are your own?

"The tombs and chambers in which rest the blessed ones of old, the citi-
zens on the west of Thebes. It was found that the thieves had violated
them all, dragging their owners from their coffins so that they were left
on the desert, and stealing their funerary goods which had been given to
them together with the gold and silver and the fittings which were in
their coffins." Op. cit. This happened centuries before Homer. I'm becom-
ing temporarily blinded myself: the migraine interference sends spear-
thrusts across the visual field. 

"But I said to them with an air of boldness 'My brother will not let me 
be interfered with,' and Amenkhau gave me a blow with a spear on one of 
my arms and I fell." Amenkhau and the brother got the treasure after all.

Now I can't see, touch and follow the keys. Nothing opens.

This is terrible, terribly written, I couldn't see what I was doing, I
come across as an idiot, illiterate, hardly able to speak or write, forget
it, I didn't mean any of it, even the screen disappeared, I used the word
"there" far too often, the philosophical underpinnings are ridiculous, if
this is the best I can do, I should go back to gradeschool, I apologize to
everyone for my musings, this insane need to write, ground myself in this

Only the Good Die Young


You know where this is going but I don't. Anyone who went through the 60s,
rubbed themselves raw in the middle to late 60s and early 70s, against the
right in America that's now breathing down our necks with the fury of
missed and regulated life - anyone who went through them caught in the war
of the peace - has been traumatized, amputated, has learned to bury well,
never say "far out" again because it's all reigned in, has learned to walk
the walk, talk the talk -

Has learned to bury early on Janis and Jimmy and John and John and Al and
Robert and Abbie and Martin and Marvin and those who burned bright for a
second, just when we were beginning to learn to fuck them, open our
bodies, insurrections of the flesh -

How did Jerry survive so long, get away with it, these little murders
splitting out bodies open - we weren't taught that life was one long
series of deaths, only that death was there on the horizon, present yes,
but not these little murders -

We're fucking survivors, the Net's a commune, the last Free Press, we're
on the edge, waiting for insurrection, of the other, of ourselves, splin-
tered on the bones of a country we barely recognize -

Cause otherwise we're all sleep for the slaughter - little murders on down
the line - take us -

'She wander'd in the lad of clouds thro' valleys dark, list'ning
Dolours & lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave
She stood in silence, list'ning to the voices of the ground,
Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down,
And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.

'"Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?
"Or the glist'ning Eye to the poison of a smile?
"Why are Eyelids stor'd with arrows ready drawn,
"Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie?
"Or an Eye of gifts & graces show'ring fruits & coined gold?
"Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?
"Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?
"Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, & affright?
"Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?
"Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?"'

The Images' Imaginary


I have been putting .gif images up on my semi-home page, sending them to
Image email list, working them through various programs. So that the in-
terior space of the terminal appears to make itself present as a space of
potential, a space otherwise of absolute darkness. Within the space I can
hear the accounting of names, appearances which define contouring, which
define and demarcate their own, much as email demarcates its own space,
forecloses without ignition, non-existence and not even annihilation. 

The language of the images glows from within, inner fires; they're images 
of the interior, and the fires light themselves like blown bubbles or 
skeins. It's necessary to remember their origin as pixels, each a clear 
delineation of a position upon the screen, the cartesian asserting itself 
invisibly and at the very last moment.

The images attempt to spell my name but the name's refused, stuttering,
rolling like a never-ending _rrr_ and I build them, construct them, as
images or email must be, and as speech appears elsewhere, as these images'
or emails' alterity. I build them from pornography, which is always al-
ready a form of denial, cauterization, and as bodies meander closer they
too dissolve, and spaces continue to splay themselves, operate, open up -
it's the surgery upon cyberspace that fascinates me, the impossible
wounding and suturing, there's no anchoring, tethering, for threading. 

There's nothing. I write "i tell you all my secrets" on one image, "you 
tell me all your secrets" on another. Stereogram technology gives depth. 
The words are on the surface; the rest goes into the terminal, deep into 
the illustration of membranes, dampness, excretions and fluids.

I can't open the holes up, can't insert, can't stream down the folds of
labia sputtered from the tube, and the darkness returns to the chora,
which could be anything at all. Penis shafts swim like fish in spaces
emptied of analytical debris. The words are borderline tags, sublima-
tions, withdrawals, luring the viewer away from the precipice: the
symbolic beckons. Aren't those secrets (and I give myself away) the
inversions, perversions, of the hidden contours of flesh that some say
constitute the body? The body writes itself into pieces... 

Some of them are the taste, touch, and smell of cyberspace, the rest that
imaginary beyond which you picture me, if you do, naked, ruptured, in the
midst of the organic imaginary.

Speculum


The breakdown of the law of distribution, which only holds in classical 
domains, is at least one index of organism; this is the collapse of the 
Boolean lattice with the law an(buc)=(anb)u(anc) and its dual, au(bnc)=
(aub)n(auc). With the inequality, it is possible for a gestural resolu- 
tion of bandwidth, such that a finite bracketing <---[x]----> in relation 
to a similar bracketing <------[y]---->, i.e. <---[x]----[y]--->, repro- 
duces a larger, almost complete, bandwidth spread, i.e. beyond that of
<---[x,y]---->, towards that of <[x   ,     y]>. This is a triggering 
based on activated threshold decisions, and now one might add intelligent 
agents, within a well-defined domain. If in addition (x,y) are taken as a 
semiotic system defined perhaps by complementarity x=y' and y=x' etc., 
then it is also clear that the breakdown of distributivity is connected 
with a certain leakage or residue/extension of the sememe itself. Note 
that in quantum systems, there are superpositions such that, given atomic 
propositions e1 and e2 (discrete), there exists an e3, also discrete such 
that e1ue2=e1ue3=e2ue3; thus "We can now understand why the validity of 
the superposition principle is so characteristic for quantum systems: It 
implies the non-Boolean character of the proposition system." This quote 
is from Jauch, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, an older book already 
from 1968; he also says

"Let us examine some of the mathematical consequences of the principle of 
superposition. A first remark: A lattice which satisfied the principle of 
superposition cannot be Boolean. Indeed, let e1, e2, and e3 be as in 
[above]. If the lattice were Boolean, we would have, for instance,
e3n(e1ue2)=(e3ne1)u(e3ne2). But this relation cannot be right, as one 
sees from the following: Since e1 and e2 are two _different_ minimal 
propositions, e1ne2=0. Hence the right-hand side is equal to 0u0=0. But 
the left-hand side is equal to e3 since e1ue2 contains e3. Thus the 
equation is incompatible with e3 not= 0." 

This is the heart of the matter, which as I have mentioned elsewhere, I 
have located in the phenomenology of color vision according to Land, 
Horn, Marr, etc. In the Land experiments, let e1,2,3 be separate fre- 
quences; then any two discrete intersect at 0, i.e. e1ne2=e2ne3=e3ne1=0. 
Hence again the right-hand side is equal to 0. Let us look however at 
e3n(e1ue2); because e3 is a subset of e1ue2=(+-)U, where U = the band- 
width in its entirety, we are given the contradiction e3nU=e3=0.

In its dual form, distributivity breaks down more radically; consider
e3u(e1ne2)=(e1ue3)n(e2ue3). The right-hand side is equivalent to UuU=U; 
the left-hand side is equivalent to e3u0, or e3; we have then e3=U, a 
contradiction.

These things show up, creating fuzzy situations, whenever an attempt is 
made to construct a clear differentiation/difference in semiotic situa- 
tions interacting with the "real." Such situations imply an observer; 
hence the spill mentioned above.

Cyberspace is totally spill in this sense, totally a situation of super- 
position. As yet I am unsure of the mapping of distributivity and quan- 
tum logic onto the structure of email and other postings, but it is clear 
that what I have called "hysterical embodiment" is based precisely on 
this spill, the reading-through of well-defined limitation. I would go so 
far as to say that all human language is double-edged in this fashion: on 
one hand, it is characterized by redundancy (heavily documented by cyber- 
neticians of the 60s-70s), which results in expansion - and on the other, 
it is precisely this expansion which spills speech and textual acts into 
the gestural unknown. What Benjamin calls the aura always already exists 
by virtue of organism; quantum logic and mechanics are caught up in the 
human far beyond the reaches of Bell's theorem.

On Shaky Grounds


Thinking further about the breakdown of distributivity: the gesture always
already implies an ontological shift, from the plane of the real to that
of the symbolic. Measurements made during the Land experiments reported
only the classical substrate, not the perceptual bandwidth which was the
result of the intelligent agents of optical processing coming into opera-
tion. This bandwidth (even down/up to the level of the psychological) is
produced unconsciously, although the Freudian divisions of c/pcs/ucs are
problematic wherever vision comes under scrutiny. 

The ontological shift is on the threshold of the symbolic, and according 
to Tran duc Thao, it is precisely this shift that calls forth language: 
the gesture produces the excess which is named by it. Pointing with the 
index finger, for example, is already a floating signifier (almost but 
not quite a _program_) which implicates the targeted entity (and which 
also _defines_ the targeted entity _as_ entity). The real takes on value, 
as it does for all organism, but here it is a shared or consensual value, 
dependent upon the interpretation of the pointed finger. Thus the body's 
framework, which physically extends from arms' and feet's length, becomes 
other as the real (vis-a-vis the Lacanian mirror-stage) is recuperated, 
absorbed, through the signifier. Note the ontological jumping here, which 
is going to remain impure, in spite of Saussure et. al. The difference in 
the signifier, among the signifiers, is the difference in the real. The 
finger targets game for example; something loses its existence as alive, 
as entity.

Rather than [x] [y] as positions, discrete or otherwise, one imagines a
_jumble_ of positions, chaotic, melding into one another, flickering,
somewhat transparent. (I wrote about this in The Structure of Reality.)
Think of this as a field of thresholds, intensities which are defined
(through simultaneous cathexis and decathexis) as names. Think of rule-
governing across the field, say linguistic geodesics; these compose syn-
tax. This field mediates among the real, among itself, much as pure
mathematics bastardizes (who is the mother/father here) in applications
which nonetheless speak an uneasy alliance with the physical. 

I'd say that this is the birth and homeostasis of language, a nonequil-
ibrium thermodynamic plateau held in place by the energy necessary to
maintain organism and culture. I'd say that this is gestural at its heart,
and that the shifts within it are similar to those in cyberspace, result-
ing in hysteric embodiment. And finally, I'd say that this hysteric embo-
diment, as horizon, is suspiciously what we know, even in the midst of
alterity - to the extent that it harbors the deathdrive; we are simultan- 
eously easy and uneasy in cyberspace, and for less than obvious reasoning.

Resonance, Gesture


Looking through writings of all sorts, religious, anonymous, worked and
reworked sublimating the particularities of the dream, who knows what
repressions beyond the archaic are carried within them? It's here I run
the search-engine, transforming species into families, families into
the resonance of the purported real. These writings always reference 
elsewhere, sympathetic and internalizing the other through empathetic
wandering. Plagiarizing Kraus, plagiarism existed from the origin itself,
duplicating, splitting, and splintering - preserving, resuscitating,
reconstructing. Eventually everything gets lost; what remains is the flux
with which I concern myself, the hollow within which the particulate sem-
iosis of the proper name is ultimately formed. In the meantime there are
clusters and bandwidths of ontologies; nothing is well-defined. Call this
the condition of the plasma, the ur-universe, ur-universals.

Anything tenders towards this, for example:

"sg=j dd wr=k m nm ntrw I will begin to say your greatness as lord of the
                        gods
 m bg stg hrw wr sfjjt  as "ba" with secret faces, great of majesty
 hmn rn=f s[hgp] ssm=f  who hides his name and conceals his image
 n rh.tw qj=f m zp tpj  whose form was not known at the beginning"

Earlier the author states "These passages illustrate the original meaning
of the lexeme _bg_, explained by E. Wolf-Brinkmann as 'capacity to assume
forms.' They designate an aspect of the complex ba-concept, which distin-
guishes the ba as the one (potential) power from the many (actual) trans-
formations or forms. Ba is the power that 'happens,' materialises (hpr) 
in forms." (Jan Assmann, Egyptian Solar Religion in the New Kingdom, Re,
Amun and the Crisis of Polytheism." I do my best to render hieroglyphic
transliteration into ASCII.)

The Evening Text states in part:

"The rays of Re are in the earth,
the inhabitants of the underworld receive them in joy.
The ways with secret things are opened for the Great Ba,
that he may settle in the land of life.
It is caused that the gods go to rest in the earth
through the secret speech in his mouth."

The Western ba's are the jackels that belong to the sunset, and the eas-
tern ba's are the baboons that belong to the sunrise. Continuing this
meandering, we note that in the Book of the Celestial Cow, Assmann trans-
lates:

"The ba of Shu is air
 The ba of Neheh is rain
 The ba of darkness is night
 The ba of the primeval ocean is Re
 The ba of Osiris is the Ram of Mendes 
 The ba of Sobek is crocodiles
 The ba of every god is snakes
 The ba of Apophis is (in) the eastern mountains
 The ba of Re is throughout the entire land."

And he says "With the possibility of the aspect change inherent in the con-
cept of ba, the expression [Amun-Re "'as "ba" with secret faces, great of
majesty'"] also refers to the plurality of the cosmic manifestations and
not only to the one life-giving principle in and behind them. Thus his 
'ba's' are the life-giving elements and they can be experienced in the cos-
mos as the ways in which god works. By making use of this concept Ramesside
Amun-Re theology refers not to a specific power, but to the concept of ab-
solute power, responsible for absolutely all effects, whose visible mani-
festation is the entire cosmos."

Moving from the historical _reality_ of these texts, it is possible to
construct a ba-dialectic, splintered into manifestations, remaindered in
the absolute, actualities/currencies and abstract theology. What of the
originary power found in so many classical mythologies, out of which
narratives emerge? Even the Rig Veda's X,129 portends a beginning in
ba, unencumbered by proper names (I quote in full, because of its rele-
vance and central role here):

"There was neither non-existence nor existence then; there was neither the
realm of space nor the sky which is beyond. What stirred? Where? In whose
protection? Was there water, bottomlessly deep? There was neither death 
nor immortality then. There was no distinguishing sign of night nor of 
day. That one breathed, windless, by its own impulse. Other than that there
was nothing beyond. Darkness was hidden by darkness in the beginning; with
no distinguishing sign, all this was water. The life force that was covered
with emptiness, that one arose thorugh the power of heat.
   Desire came upon that one in the beginning; that was the first seed of 
mind. Poets seeking in their heart with wisdom found the bond of existence
in non-existence. Their cord was extended across. Was there below? Was 
there above? There were seed-placers; there were powers. There was impulse
beneath; there was giving-forth above.
   Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it produced? 
Whence is this creation? The gods came afterwards, with the creation of 
this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen? Whence this creation 
has arisen - perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not - the one who 
looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he knows - or perhaps he 
does not know."

(Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism)

The absolute in dialectic with itself, somewhere there had to be time (a
problem with _this_ universe as well), somewhere the story had to begin.
When the story begins, there are characters, actants, narratological mom-
ents. Only then does the collapse into everyday life, the origin, begin,
not as an origin, but in the process of beginning. (And this occurs in
relation to _negation,_ the thud [below] given as a continuity from which
there occurs a withdrawal or decathexis. Decathexis? The world emerges out
of a loss of interest. Take note.)

Plagiarism appears as soon as division occurs, the namings which are du-
plication, the magics, fetishes, seeking out the other, the uneasiness of
alterities that are introjected back into the body. Beforehand, it's the
world of substance, Flaubert's St-Antoine's froth: beforehand, that is
before the signifier. Already the appearance of the absolute splinters it,
are you following me?, as trace-ing, following back into the absolute is
impossible, time forwards itself, in spite of the presence of people, in
fact, in relation to the presence of people; time is always already peo-
ple's time. (While, bi-directionally, across the membrane or field, there
is no conclusion.)

Ontologies skitter, existence thuds, resonates; resonance emits signals.

It being, it begins.

Signals, Skittering of Difference


If we understand what physically exists, in terms of the filtering, 
editing, and isolation of a signal, then we can understand the bracketing 
that creates a firewall around it, and the means for maintaining it. In 
Digital and Analog Communication Systems, Leon W. Couch II specifies the 
following attributes of "practical waveforms that are _physically real- 
izable_" [my comments are in brackets*]:

"1. The waveform has significant nonzero values over a composite time
interval that is finite. [There must be presence in the first place; a
null waveform is equivalent to no waveform at all. If the waveform is a 
signal, there must be a symmetrical substrate of one sort or another, 
Peirce's sheet of assertion, carrier wave, etc. This is part of the 
delivery system.]

2. The spectrum of the waveform has significant values over a composite
frequency interval that is finite. [These values would be carried in a
particular medium. Everything depends in #1 and #2 on "significant" of
course - when is a waveform noise, and when is it relevant as a signal?
What constitutes relevancy?]

3. The waveform is a continuous function of time. [The waveform takes on a
value for every subinterval within a specified interval, and further, it
has a beginning and an end.]

4. The waveform has a finite peak value. [It can be contained within one 
or another receiving/transmitting unit.]

5. The waveform has only real values. That is, at any time, it cannot have
a complex value a + jb, where b is nonzero. [The waveform is observable in
the real world.]" 

Can we say that a signal embodies a delivery system, and is therefore both
bracketed temporally and temporally dependent? This is a question of con-
touring. The maintenance of signals constitutes culture, and the mainten-
ance of culture employs the redundancy of signals. The embodiment of sig-
nals vis-a-vis interpretation involves secondary narcissism. A signal is
never totally defined by difference; as pointed out elsewhere, indexical
pointing towards an object skitters ontologies but does not necessarily
operate as relay against other gestures. Embodiment is always already an
issue; sememes are never totalities. Even Baudrillard's simulacra exist as
such in relation to practices in the real world, and such practices, de-
terminative or not, "solvable" or not, are finite. If we begin with these
practices, instead of the debris of structuralism (dyads, difference, 
etc.), then totality is quickly recognized as construct itself. The anal- 
ysis of gesture I have presented in the past few days is precisely that 
of the construct of totality. 

There is a politics of engagement embedded in this, which I leave to the 
imaginary.

*I don't, by the way, pretend to the mathematical sophistication of this 
text, and other phenomenologies would have worked as well here.
