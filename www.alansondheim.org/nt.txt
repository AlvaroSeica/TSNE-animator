you bloody girlie and my empire
http://www.asondheim.org/girlie3.bmp
someday you will move at my command
you are carrying the blood of the others 
they will separate you
you are separated and while i cannot write, my darling,
i can assemble you among the cellular debris that characterizes us
forgive my lack of style, my clumsy hands
you will not be in order when i put you back together
even empire has its limitations

The death of a small wasp


How wonderful the work of Nature is!
I looked at the tiny wasp through an antique microscope.
The wasp was our pet.
It lived with us for several weeks.
Then one day, it died, of natural causes.
The bristles are perfectly arranged on the legs.
The lenses are crisp and beautiful, the eyes! the eyes!
Everything is as it should be.
Such structures! Such configurations!
The wasp is thread-wasted and quite small.
I will pray for the wasp.
Such perfect design, such eloquence!
Nothing is happening here, nothing, nothing!
It is all useless, it didn't multiply, emptied.

And the World is emptied of meaning.
And we are the hard-scrabble savanna primates who did it.
Before us! Everything little thing!
Inconceivable structures, amazing configurations!
Now, nothing corrodes, nothing coheres.
We violate the universe, we slaughter!

I believe nothing, I will pray for the wasp!
I will pray for the wasp!




o violence! o melody!
my nightmare that blood-darfur that blood-iraq
consequence of http://www.asondheim.org/mynight.bmp
that i cannot bring myself to starvation
nor can i bring myself to sharp and injurious sense
i work in this village and i produce
one after another, these images
lurid and furious and stereotyped, i draw them
over and over again, from templates supplied
& that there is no face
& that there is no skin
& that of obvious consequence 
of o violence! o melody!
of obvious consequence of the production of this village
and the supplier of templates and numerous darfur and iraq

the drive, look how pretty it is

it's happened that i've pushed this work into obscene discomfort, what 
were they in abu gharayb, what were they in the beheadings, the darfur 
killings, the rapes, the slaughter, what's the sex in it, what's sexy 
about it, what's the desire, what's the impetus. i have nightmares, don't 
we all, see these things in them, there's something in control, in broken 
things, something pushing us to our limits, and their bodies past their 
limits towards death. in spite of the stereotypes, these horrors emerged, 
calling us in, making us complicit, highway accident gawkers, kick the 
corpse, take the teeth, the ear, the prick. in war everything from bullet 
to cock impales, and these are my war, sloughing them out to you with all 
the power seduction can offer when the result is murder and murder alone. 
then to remember these aren't bodies but polygons, nodes, but structures 
that like skin bear witness to years of violence. this is what people do 
to each other, look how pretty it is.

what happens inside, when the body turns its fury against itself, when 
it's all over, when this scenario has the uncomfortable ring of truth. 
more difficult this, watching for light among the shattered organs, 
imaginary, chora, all that cultural debris hanging by shreds to flesh torn 
from its moorings. if these are uncomfortable to watch, they are 
uncomfortable to make, each loophole closing before i can proceed, if it 
is 'i' and not 'one' if it is all day all night if it won't stop if it 
can't stop

i don't know if the gender is right or the right order but i have been in 
there but not in there, this fantasm, this uncanny
this political assault this slaughter
this ragged hinge

distraught, i second and agree


i second and agree with Ryan here although he's not responsible for this 
post and i dream of Canada. the past few days I've sent out what might be 
my best image-work, certainly work relevant to our position today in terms 
of both phenomenology and politics, no one comments on these works, there 
might be a small spike, i don't know in website access. but what can i 
expect, sending out so much work all the time, no matter what the quality. 
it loses its relevance by surplus. it's useless like this post is useless. 
occasionally a friend will reply, but that's all. at least i hope you're 
ordering your neighbors to vote. this isn't a time for niceties. i third 
and agree with Susanne here and would if possible stop the paranoia and 
hatred, albeit my work is brilliant and invisible to you as is this post, 
a form of mea culpa or bootstrap starting with an inconceivable ab nihilo 
- the quantity of thinking that expresses itself outside the body returns 
within, in the recent images which i have created, which are not so much 
created as a kind of reportage on the state of interiority in relation to 
digital incursion. of course one never knows what one misses and there are 
my own personal attack dogs out there who will point out the disaster of 
cross-posting, my evil in general, flooding their mailboxes with unwanted 
spam. i fourth and agree with Murray here that they could simply place my 
address in delete or kill or other filter, say procmail, as i have done 
with them, in order to protect myself psychologically, since some of the 
ugliest attacks have come personally to me at one or another conference, i 
remember in particular a nasty smirking talentless individual who wanted 
above all to appear in the know following like a dead dog after another 
dead dog, perhaps there is no name for that. i am far too vulnerable to 
these people whose idea of humanity is unbridled and highly applied 
machismo in situation where discourse should be the rule of the day. i 
fifth and agree with Carole that every text should stand on its own, that 
every text is a file, that the entire digital world is composed of files, 
of strings of symbols, ordered somewhat coherently in a world order that 
exudes very little self-defense. not only is a chain determined by its 
weakest link, but the weakest link also turns the rest of the chain into 
literal garbage, polluting the earth, although otherwise perfectly fine, 
which is one reason to recycle constantly, just as almost everything we 
own is from one or another recycling, due to constant poverty and stress. 
but i note that Tom or Jennifer will place a work up for gracious comment 
and much discussion into the night and my form of daily dosage of tv's 
worst journalist moments transformed into text goes almost entirely 
unnoticed, as for one thing, it actually at times requires download or 
attentive reading, and who has the time for that when probably half a 
billion are online now or getting online, and spam reaches a good sixty to 
eighty percent of all packets down the line. still i hunger as the 
election approaches for a morsel of positivity that i'm doing something 
right, instead of hearing from the usual attack dogs who surely could for 
a moment change to hotmail and send me violent and uncontrollable email as 
if my life were in danger, or my mental health, already suffering from the 
incipient fascism in this country and trying, as we all are, to do 
something about it. i am a president and i do what a president has to do. 
i am an artist and i do what an artist has to do. we all have this 
selfishness built into our genetic structures, however usually it's not so 
much on the surface, most often there is a modicum of super-structural 
cultural configurations on top of raw libido. political esthetics, wolves 
on the attack both here and in real-space, even though the animals are 
misused, some of the most beautiful on earth. i agree with James that the 
same isn't true at all for the current human species, which is hardly 
humane, none of us are, in any sense of the word, and perhaps i go farther 
yet in praying for extinction, which the current regime in fact might 
authorize or abet. the value of this is incalculable, since, if there is 
no reason to save forests or whales, there is even less reason to save 
ourselves, and in fact reason has very little to do with it. it's a matter 
of taste, and mine goes to the majority, and it's a matter of the least 
pain, and our elimination will certain savage the earth to a considerably 
less degree than is going on now. i agree with Mark that this pessimism 
might not be warranted, but there is little else, given the vagaries and 
vandalization of power in the hands of a few, which will increasingly be 
the case as the wealthy turn towards encasement and gated communities, 
control and command and communication centers, the rest of us allowed to 
fare in poisonous air and misguided weaponry. one man, one woman, one 
atomic bomb, and one child, and nothing more is ever or will ever be 
necessary. in the shadow of this, my misguided attempts at writing or 
imaging or programming or sound or video, light or smell, scent or odor, 
touch or travesty, lend themselves to nothing whatsoever, but it's my 
genes speaking that keeps me on the move, hoping for a missive in return 
and a kinder or more gentle one at that. i agree with Adrian that this is 
hardly likely, that one has only so much time in the world, and the time 
of the world seems increasingly limited, and how much attention can you 
pay to any one human, and there are just so many minutes in the day. as 
well, there is always the danger of repetition, or psychosis or neurosis 
setting in, moving out of control so subtilely that it's hardly noticeable 
until suddenly one awakens, as if from a dream, finding oneself in a field 
of slaughter or unparalleled violence in the midst of an all-too-familiar 
world. it's there that the missive arrives, in a ruined mailbox or inbox, 
read by eyes almost blinded by a surfeit of ultraviolent, and it's there 
that the last reprieve appears, for a minute, and almost a minute too 
late. i agree with Eleanor that the time is always already gone in future 
anterior, that the future has already happened. i am too late, myself, as 
usual, and will not garner your respect.

VOTE NEW YORK!!!


It's easy to vote this election! Vote the New York way! We're the smartest 
city in America and that makes New York State the smartest state! (In 
spite of Albany!) We have the major museums! The biggest shows! In this 
city we have neighborhoods from over one hundred and twenty countries! 
Where I live we have the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Mark Morris 
dance studios - a huge building devoted to one company, built from the 
ground up! New York Dolls! Bella Abzug! We have radio stations for every 
taste! Our cultural economy is tremendous - where else can you find 
regularly, at a thrift shop, Benjamin and Frege, Pavese, and Madison's The 
Hermeneutics of Postmodernity? We have the major newspapers, magazines, 
cultural journals, anywhere in the English-speaking world! We are the home 
of Yiddish theater and hiphop and just about every form of jazz ever 
created or discovered! We're the city that produces around the clock, that 
never sleeps at night, that constantly moves, dances, and thinks! Our 
daily news is almost always political, and our ball team is one of the 
best in the country - so good in fact, that we let Boston have the series 
this time! And we're liberal enough to tolerate a bit of fascism as Bush 
and his cohorts coughed their way through a national convention! Bill 
Clinton! The West Village! Civil right and wrongs! We've got the best 
artists, and poetry begins and ends here, no matter what you heard about 
the west coast! Our art's so important Terry Allen had to make fun of it! 
We've got institutions like St Marks and the Met (which? opera or museum, 
take your pick) that are nowhere else to be found on the continent! And we 
take our politics seriously without moronic lip-service to god and 
country! We'll pledge allegiance if the country deserves it! We know the 
flag's a piece of cloth! We'll stand tall for or against the powers that 
be, and we'll lead the country in demonstrations if we have to! Vote for 
us and let us decide! A vote for us is a vote for justice everywhere - 
we've got the best law schools in North America here - even Derrida came 
and spoke over and over again, Kristeva just did her heart-stopping tour! 
We take nothing from no one! We've had the Talking Heads! If we're going 
to have a mob, we're going to have the best mob in the world! If we're 
going to dig up dirt on someone, we'll do it to the bottoms of our 
pockets! If we're going to riot, we'll be second to L.A. but nowhere else! 
Saturday Night Live! Springsteen just across the river! We move furiously 
on public transportation! We have one of the lowest crime rates in the 
nation, and one of the smallest ecological footprints anywhere! We have 
some of the best universities in the world, some of the most committed 
filmmakers, and our writers are second to none! Look at me, at Franz 
Kline, at Charlie Parker, look at the Harlem Renaissance, look at Walt 
Whitman, look at the Brooklyn Bridge, and marvel, marvel! And of all the 
places in the country, we never lost our cool over 9/11 but took it 
bravely and intelligently in stride, even when our thug of a president 
came down to make political capital of things! We have Olmsted-designed 
beautiful parks, we've got the Jamaica Bay marshes, the Rockettes, even 
dancing Santas! We tolerate heterosexuals and just about anyone else; even 
men and women can get married, and there's never been a question of gay 
rights, which is our fight and yours, although you might not know it! We 
question our race relations, our sexual relations, our religious 
relations, up front and in your face! We don't file style but make it, and 
you can't follow it if you don't live here, because you don't have the 
energy! Everyone comes here sooner or later and does something, and even 
if they leave, they're never the same again! We're smart when it comes to 
voting, we know the ecological score, the home security score, better than 
most; we know the foreign policy score, we've got the United Nations, and 
there's less trouble in the streets in that regard than anywhere else in 
the USA! We're remarkably tolerant and we recognize our faults and work on 
them, hard as hell, even in the onslaught of Republican slaughter in an 
unjust war! Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground! And we'll tell you 
this, that Bush is NOT our president, that his country is NOT our country, 
no matter what you hear! We're too smart for that! Sorry Toronto, 
Montreal, L.A., Chicago, we're the cultural capital of North America! 
Kathy Acker! Apollo Theater! We're the synaptic pulse coursing through 
your heart and your neighbor's heart and everything good and bad brought 
to you in the name of capital, progress, liberality, liberalism, 
liberation, fury, rap, fashion, power, electric culture, Broadway 
universe, WiFi universe, mass transportation, just the good life with 
thrift-shop books and the headquarters for the Daily Show! NBC ABC CBS and 
radio radio radio! Forget Hollywood, that has-been home of cocaine creeps 
and heroine harries. Come visit, bring your cash, you'll need it, and we 
need it too! Whatever you heard, you don't have to watch your back here! 
We're the Soul of the world! We invented Soul! We got Catholics, Muslims, 
Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, Witches, Warlocks, Santeria and more! 
And when you vote Democratic, just think, you'll be voting with the best 
of what this place has to offer, this United States, which may not be much 
outside of the five boroughs, but it's all we've got! So let us lead you 
to the promised land, and Vote New York, Vote New York, Vote New York!!!!

ruling

ruling everywhere the three women determined our fates in the future 
world. they were the dixie chicks and they were incredibly hot. they sang 
and sang and the audiences were full of heart and sometimes they disagreed 
but they held their ground. there were religious revivals and unbelievable 
moments of ecstasy as amazing high notes were reached and held. what could 
be more beautiful than to hear the incredible dixie chicks singing their 
hearts out and the hostile audiences responding with care, love, and true 
caress. i would love to be at their concert and would love to swoon in 
front of the dixie chicks. i would be their slave forever, each of them 
equal to the others, and none of them would be ahead of the others and i 
would worship them equally.

my name is jennifer and i want to second this account of the love and 
beauty of the dixie chicks and the ecstatic wonder and delight their 
performance inspires in me. every performance has its own beauty and its 
own wonder but every one of them is what i call weather-beauty because 
just like the weather the beauty stays forever inside me.

i am nikuko and i can only agree and i do understand the many languages
that are sung and spoken by the dixie chicks and they do wonder-weather
me as well. someone said, well why don't you say something about the 
dixie chicks and so i am saying it here, this beauty they inspire and the
religious revival they set in motion wherever they speak and sing. 

i am jennifer again and they do speak and sing so well. and i am nikuko, 
no this is really jennifer, i am having a wonder-fun with nikuko.

we are the dixie chicks and we inspire with our singing and our talking,
and our religious revival work which we do so well and full of heart and
our audiences are full of warmth and heart-felt caring and we love them so.

Subject: Notes on the election -




Notes on the election -

0. The Republican win was predicted and predictable. Now the infinity
of analysis begins, an infinity that has already missed the point.

1. There is nothing the Democrats might have done 'better.' The country
voted its conscience.

2. Its conscience is founded on a morality-based worldview, which is
rural in origin, and relatively rigid.

3. 9/ll played a critical role, not only in revealing the extreme
vulnerability of the country, but also in the production of an Islamic-
fundamentalist alterity that could not be dismissed.

4. With the religious right, fundamental ontology replaces the episteme.

5. Bush appeared, alive and life-like at the World Trade Center ruins
almost immediately after, conjoining his image with the intensity of
destruction.

6. The left continuously focused on the negative aspects of the
Republican party, over-determining, at least in print, the violence of
a world-view at odds with the rest of the planet.

7. Absolute morality is not concerned whatsoever with opinion.

8. The right has been organizing, in the US, for at least a century 
and a half; this election and the last have been in preparation for 
decades. With the elimination of the 'fairness doctrine' under Reagan, 
and with monopoly ownership of local broadcasting, the right has been 
able to dominate the 'heartland' without opposition. The corporate and
Christian merge, to the benefit of both.

9. In the 60s, which for many of us appears to be a history of the left,
the right quietly embraced both technology and structural compromises
that increased and solidified its power base, in rural and impoverished
areas of the country.

10. A fundamental flaw is the assumption that so-called minority votes
are liberal and leftist; in fact, the opposite is increasingly the case.

11. The 'American dream' is both part of class distinctions, and a
force in their elimination. Don't underrate its influence; no matter
how hard we try, there is no revolutionary class, but only power,
desire, economic status, and diffused and focused oppression.

12. Corporate America is far more diverse and problematic than the left
assumes; it also presents a very real world of almost infinite choice
and identifications. Its collusions and corruptions are our collusions
and corruptions, and have absolutely nothing to do with God and God's
State.

13. Cultural capital in the US is far more important than economic
capital, and its boundaries cut across the latter in terms of class. We
are all white trash and we are all intellectuals and theorists.

14. Far too many judgments are made 'for' rural and so-called back-
water areas, which are almost never heard themselves. The information
discourse networks and religious institutions of the majority of American
voters are concretely effaced by abstraction. The water of baptism is
not H2O.

15. Morality and fear are interwoven; it is the abject stereotyped
image of gays fucking that appears to corrode the 'clean and pure' body
politic. Your marriage wrecks my marriage. It is a failure of the left
not to deal with this; dismissing the violent imaginary out of hand
ensures its force within the political arena.

16. In conservative America, the negation of negation is not dialectical,
but also a return to a rapturous positivity.

17. If one's religion insists that abortion, for example, is murder,
then any means, including murder as literal self-preservation, may be
used in return as a defensive and pre-emptive action. It is not ever a
question of one side listening to another; it is a question of war to
an infinite degree.

18. The church in rural and disenfranchised America is a communal and
cohesive force, one of the few institutions capable of lived-community
and defense against the rest of the world. But more than this, the
church is also the locus for community activity and identity. To dismiss
it, even in its intolerant and sometimes evangelical varieties, is to
miss the point of its existence. For the individual, the church is
salvation, explaining and preserving morality, even forgiving and
abetting the temptations of sin.

19. The church overdetermines the rest of the world; rural and other-
wise isolated communities have a surprisingly low degree of information
flux. The church provides stability in a late-late-capitalist world of
postmodernity, where selves, ideologies, and languages are contested.
Within testament and testimony, there is no contestation; the church,
in other words, 'puts a hedge around the Torah' (Pirke Avot).

20. In my opinion, the image of Kerry hunting (and killing) was not
only hypocritical and distasteful, but also a premature sign of defeat.
However, this had no affect on the election per se, which was already
determined, way back in the late 60s and early 70s, when Billy Graham
created the first automated post-office in the US - a religious
embrace of technology that forecast the future of the country. Perhaps
the left 'created' - i.e. the hacking manifesto - but the religious
right utilized, entrenched, constructed a primary embrace of individual
and instrumental reason that guaranteed the supple application of power
when and where needed. The only real question here is why it took so
long.

21. The left has been hampered by split ideologies and critique; the
right, which permits no critique, has worked constantly with umbrella
ideologies.

22. What has been exposed and contested in the US is often business as
usual in the rest of the world. We are witnessing a movement from
republic to empire, from the primacy of voting, to the primacy of
dominant interests.

23. On a personal level - I have lived in West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
and the Bushlands of Texas and Florida. What happened was no surprise.
I voted early yesterday, and felt a sense of relief at the minor
_punctum_ I experienced. But I had no doubt that Bush would win, that
my voice was primarily personal therapeutic. Instead of despair late
last night/this morning, I've felt that our work, that of an opposition,
has only just begun - that it could only just begin. We have to
recognize, above all, that the US has done the will of the majority;
the more we overlook this, excuse this, theorize this, wonder 'what
went wrong,' the more we are weakened. Perhaps this is a positive sign -
in the sense that the enemy, if it is an enemy, is clear, and no longer
can be dismissed as an aberration.

24. The 'cultural war' is war.

25. Terror is an instrument of war.

26. Religion sublimates terror.

27. I live, you die. Vote or die holds no truck with the faithful.

28. Language is not action. Belief is action. Belief is not language.

29. The explication of fact in Michael Moore is replaced by the
internalization of sin and the body in Mel Gibson. Old Testament, New
Testament.

30  What the right knows: There is always already closure.

of your behaviour under Jewus Christ Glory Be to God
    
of Jewus Christ Glory Be to God I have nothing to say. of Christ at the 
point of a gun. Of the stricture of the Law of the Land. if the Founding 
Fathers had remained true to their Cause, God, E Pluribus Unum, in God we 
Trust, would have been part and parcel of our otherwise poor Heritage. for 
we have escaped Old Europe in order to find God and pursue Him in our many 
Ways. God will listen to all but the Pagan, the Heathen, the Atheist. The 
Heathen lives in Foreign Climes and has no purveyance. The Pagan is 
misled, and in that Misleading thereby lies a crime and sin of Omission. 
of the Atheist, there is no Misleading, but a sin of Commission, and he 
should be punished accordingly. of females of the pagan persuasion, let 
them be led back into the Faith or crucified at our disposition.

Christ was mean to be at the point of a gun; to render unto Caesar is to 
observed the armed constabulary, one Truth for all, and all for one Truth, 
which is the One, to be indeed worshiped in many ways. for it is said that 
the filter of a needle keeps cleansed waters for rich and poor alike. and 
those who own the waters, they are our Masters and are Men of God.

for Jewus Christ created the chemistry of explosive and the chemistry of 
nuclear process, and it were for that chemistry to be employed against the 
Pagan and Atheist, otherwise such creation would be useless. and the Pagan 
and Atheist, to be sure, those who have heard the word and of it rejected 
in Full, they are Fools as well, full of fornication and gambling, of sex 
among men and animals, children and women, of sexual Jewus Christ himself. 
and of gambling, they shalt be killed by the Righteous at the point of a 
gun. and of the reading of evil deed and promiscuity, the same. and of the 
misinterpretation of the Christian law of this land, the same. and of any 
wilful that moves against the Maker of all there is and all there will be, 
the same. and of dwarves and giants, and all who refuse to fulfill the 
expectation of the human being, the same. and of those who partner or 
befriend animals, the same. and of those who refuse to exploit the 
resource and fecundity that God has intended upon the earth, the same. and 
of those who refuse the eating of meat and fish of the sea, the produce of 
the husbandry of Jewus Christ God Himself, the same. and of scribblers and 
rumour- mongers, the same. and of writers and artists who do not Glorify, 
the same. and of singers who do not sing the Praises, the same.
