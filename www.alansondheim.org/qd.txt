New Jewels in the Metaverse


Sweeping everything aside and starting over.
Things are ephemeral of course, but ephemerality is imminent,
inhering.
Particles among particles, or fields, or anything else,
neither this nor that, not both this and that:
The entanglement of the Sheffer stroke and its dual.
The particles have more or less specific lives.
Memo to self: make these half-lives, bring probability in.

The _bridge_ is the difficulty moving from _description_ to 
_phenomenological theory._
"Here I am: I made something, let me tell you about it."
"Metaverse says: Making and unmaking, telling you nothing."
"No I, something, you, metaverse, nothing."
"Yes, now and to get on with it:

The _bridge_ is the difficulty moving from _description_ to
_phenomenological theory._
Otherwise _this_ describes nothing more than an instantiation.
The _accurate_ performance is a _mess._
A stupid question: Does the universe perform? Now if one considers
perhaps 10^500 universes, the metaverse, one can rephrase: Does 
the metaverse perform? 
Well the metaverse performs for itself.
And the metaverse is its performance-for-itself.
Which is no performance at all, but roiling.
Therefore the metaverse performs in our heads which are subjects
of metaverse performance. 
Yes, well, this is the tenor of all. Tenor of all of what, how can
we do anything but continue to speak in a projected night 
projecting cold; hereabouts, one might speak of the _project_ 
of the night. 
The project of the night is our performing performance; of course
it is _our_ project.
One wants to make it clear: This is the intellectual property
of the metaverse.

After the performance, these images.

And I think about _the slush fund of neutrinos._



pre-sent

from the viewpoint of the one, here i am writing this with closed eyes, 
concentrating on the thought putting itself forth, as if i were elsewhere, 
and from this point of view, all is interiority, just as sight records a 
permanence unlost in time as hearing is lost, as touch is not, and warmth 
is intermediate; smell is a motion and a process, just as taste; smell 
might remain, but taste disappears with the capacity to ingest perhaps. 
you can see the embeddings of time in the senses, and in the roiling of my 
constructions in virtual worlds, time is dissipated just as hearing is 
always already a disappearance and smell or taste are embodied only in 
memory, only present in memory, never presented, never in a present: the 
knowledge of the organism is the knowledge of the present as pre-sent.

but what i give you, can give you here, are the captured screens, the shot 
snaps, the death of the imaginary, the dead-roiling always on the move, 
ghosts without feet, just ghosts.

(Review of Julu Twine from Aquarius records)

Porter Records
 to me, myk_saintdirt
	
Hi guys, really nice review from Aquarius records...

Alan Sondheim is a legendary writer and critic, he's also quite the
accomplished musician, his fantastic Ritual-All-7-70 album was recently
reissued on ESP which we should get around to reviewing quite soon. This
collaborative effort is in fact not archival but a brand new record,
released on the insanely prolific and always impressive Porter Records, on
Julu Twine Sondheim teamed up with lap steel guitarist Myk Freedman for
some improvised folk, that manages to bristle with energy, sounding quite
abstract at moments, but surprisingly composed at others.
Incorporating a unique arsenal of instruments, including zither, banjo
slide guitar and even something called a parlor guitar, the duo crafted
this gorgeous songsuite, the playing is often quite percussive, and
aggressive, subtle strumming and abstract finger picking is all tangled up
with intense strumming, and atonal scrabbling, here and there the
instruments are wreathed in thick buzzing feedback, other times the
melodies are spidery and abstract and allowed to unfurl lazily. Sondheim
contributes a kick ass banjo solo, that sounds simultaneously like classic
bluegrass, but also slightly chaotic and seat-of-the-pants sounding.
Freedman counters with a gorgeously languid slide guitar solo, all drifty
and woozy and ethereal, but the record works best when the two play
together, and off of each other. Lots of reverb and room sound, strange
haunting Eastern sounding melodies, occasional squalls of detuned
hillbilly psych freakouts, stumbling lurching atonal melodies drifting
into soft shimmering avant Appalachia, squiggly slippery slide wound all
around off kilter chromatic riffing, and once in a while, the two come
together perfectly and unfurl a warm washed out drone-y guitar raga, that
we wish would just go on and on and on.
Everyone into Blackshaw and Rose and Bishop and Baldwin and Ahmed And
Akiyama and other modern acoustic guitarists should definitely check this
out. Same sort of sound, but way more tripped out and otherworldly and
mysterious and jazzlike. RECOMMENDED!!!

===============================================================



WORLD


"It's based on the two World texts (World and World ii) I wrote recently, 
about a philosophical phenomenology of string theory, particularly in 
relation to text. The two World texts come at the end of the attached 
text. Above, are various code/work manipulations of the texts - as you go 
from the beginning, incoherence of style transforms into coherence of 
content. In other words, the later portions are 'easier' to read than the 
earlier. The whole embodies a world or Worlding, an attempt to contain 
meaning and syntax which are leaking out in all directions." 

(From an email. I quite like this piece I wrote for a chapbook; it turned
out to be somewhat long. Enjoy hopefully! - Alan)

World

String theory knocks a loop into analog/digital, nothing remains certain 
that is one way or another, what occurs can be read accordingly pre/sent 
or sent/from. Holographic theory knocks a loop into ding-an-sich, / Ding 
an sich Ding an sich is unknowable though certainly /: The roads to the 
visible real are tortured, one can't say anything. This is the dead-end of 
philosophy, with the exception of the social - you have justice and ethics 
beneath the aegis of situational heuristics, but one ultimately appeals at 
best to primatology without teleology or theology. What happens to the 
episteme, epistemology, around the circuits of a black hole? The ontology 
of strings and information scattered (presented, coded, irretrievable) 
might as well devolve into mathesis where ideality itself is problematic: 
At the end of the day, nothing remains, but everything is present; nothing 
is everything, and so forth. The broken ontology of the middle way is 
broken in another and more radical way: Nothing can be said, because what 
there is, is literally unsayable. Try translating equation into language, 
language into everyday doxa, dark matter into descriptors, descriptors 
into primitives, primitives into foundations. Give it a go: That the movie 
we watch is ourselves watching the movie, that projection is sourceless, 
that every four vector carries the potential of an imaginary. There's no 
'it' to go farther than this: We are the dream-screen of an unconscious 
universe, no matter how far, how many conventions, dimensions. Convention: 
What we call as a past posterior. Accountability: Unaccountability. It's 
the knife-edge of good things in catastrophe theory transmuted through 
classicism into the anthropic principle, mythos of origins. Cause and 
effect: Scattered. Hallucinated projections named 'real' by hallucinated 
projections. The buildup of dimensions, topologies, branes, dark-matter, 
virtualities: No buildup at all, the baroque edifice of something given 
meaning by something naming by some fantasm or an other. Membrane/brane 
among Planck's lengths, masses, times, embedded seethed or froths as if 
non-embedded. You can always: Add, subtend, augment, the pressure of 
mathesis, eventually loose consistencies, heuristics, seem to dominate: 
The four-color theorem as example. What of this? In the small: Classical 
logics, set theories, Ptolemy and Kepler: Reductions because math can do 
that. Divide and spread, emit, spew, sourceless, targetless, broiling, 
then what might be phenomenologies of coagulations: Maybe Wolfram's 
automata giving shrift to these, cells falling apart, failing, location- 
less. So we're: Present and accounted for as-if 'among us': Therefore a 
literary as if 'object and process' or one or another ontology, creaky but 
functional epistemologies: As long as the hallucinogenic withdraws, 
'doesn't look too close,' as if 'there were looking,' as if 'there were a 
ground of one sort or another,' of which: None of these, they're knot

Fields appear to have no touch, nothing germane to the body; one thinks of 
action at a distance because distance seems emptied. Heat transgresses for 
example; nothing happens in mediated space. Magnetism implies qualitative 
distinction; the field attracts or repels, depending on polarity and just
what is brought into the vicinity. An approach may be +/0/-; two out of 
three attract. Epistemologically, ontologically, difference is drawn out - 
here is something out of the ordinary, perhaps non-Aristotelian, who 
knows? In any case, it's neither 'spirit' nor a thing of the world, 
although clearly it is of the world, within the world, part and parcel of 
the real. No hands push or pull the metal; were it not so common, it would 
be miracle, but it seems to 'come along with' everything familiar. Even 
boundary is contradicted, and one might be sure that the attractive 
impulse, presence, is there, even in the absence of the Other. It just 
_is._ This should, except for that familiarity, already have signaled a 
break, bringing the edifice of thing and logic down. How is space and time 
- how is space-time - when something so common is there that is not within 
as an object is within, that is not graspable, except by effect? Energy 
already seems something other than the world's thinging, yet just as 
concrete. It's not far from these considerations to an aporia of three- 
dimensionality, not to mention mass, image, light, heat, all those spatial 
fillings that seem neither possessed of projection or ordinary physical- 
ity. The clues are there, have been there. Yet again, the dream is an 
Other whose ontology isn't simply a mapping for or against a real (which, 
yes, might be the dream itself) - we're back where we startled from, 
making harmony and fit where none exists in the life-world, where bridges 
are ad-hoc at best, still taking on the characteristics of extensions and 
truth. Then there's dirt, filth; I remember Socrates' bypassing mud as 
ideality - already a fly in the ointment. What simmers beneath the surface 
isn't just abjection; it's also froth, roil, wisp, membrane, magma, clay, 
plasma, species productions and particle rains. And it's here that the 
dissolution of things is the clearest, that humans are capable of tempor- 
arily reining-in, a momentary act of meaning-generation. Yet we're invaded 
by our knowledge; our projection bodies are processing, in the process of, 
corrosion, of being-vanquished, of always already disappearance of memory 
and noise. When lines are drawn, analog/digital, they're dependent on an 
alien phenomenology of potential wells: Existence is always bypassed, and 
bypassing characterizes existence. Fielding and being slough and incohere; 
to be sure there are formings and swarmings and no one can say much more.

OldNew Hegelung

Finally have the hegelung down right, I think, although there are only 
seven frets (1st for nut, then six above in a pentatonic scale). The two 
strings are in unison; one is played against a drone (although I fret the 
drone on a couple of occasions). Everything depends on ornament, hammering 
on / pulling off / bending the string / harmonics. I'm still amazed at the 
resonance of the hegelung. (The hegelung normally has nine frets, but two 
would cover and ruin the glass-bead ornament; from what I can gather, this 
one has always had only seven, although Hans Brandeis feels differently.) 
There are a few videos of traditional hegelung playing online, which were 
helpful; my own playing however is improvisatory.

http://www.alansondheim.org/hegelungoldnew.mp3



Joke.

With new glasses I know that the world is full of sharp edges. I am think, 
what are sharp edges but everything in the world that fog is enemy of. I 
fight fog with sharp edges. I use knife and it cuts fog through easy too. 
But never enough is knife. Fog love knife I think. I can cut many fog with 
knife and blade happy and never "dull" moment of blade. See I make fog 
blade joke.

s/Mattering

1. the only thing that Matters is understanding the universe.
1a. this is a matter of connoisseurship as well as 'ultimate questions.'
1b. every ultimate question is not ultimate and all questions are the 
wrong questions.
2. arts and humanities are no use whatsoever in this regard. at best they 
may pander metaphors; embody them; critique the embodiment.
2a. yet any understanding is a prior a misrecognition, false translation.
2b. we are not equipped for anything more; we are equipped for survival, 
not comprehension.
3. Lyotard never went far enough; it's not the sun's death which is 
paramount, but the dissolution of a universe so utterly alien as to resist 
both hermeneutics and phenomenology.
4. human culture is fluttering among the surfacing of the skein. culture 
is all the way down; every organism is cultured, historic.
5. the future of the surface of the planet crudely parallels universal 
dissolution; one tends to construct rear-guard defenses for this or that - 
anything to retard decay.
6. from the moment of birth, decay begins; later sight and sound diminish 
in amplitude and bandwidth; the world with draws to where it always was.
7. withdrawal from the world is impossible; instead, the body moves from 
subject to object along a broken trajectory.
8. heaven is impossible because only the injured and traumatized blindly 
arrive there.
9. understanding the universe, no matter what strategy is employed, comes 
down to mathesis increasingly cut off from the everyday; ontology shifts 
accordingly, subtlely, until one is as ignorant as ever, even with 
conscious assimilation of equation, structure, fact.
10. facts are not all that contestable in the small.
11. one is increasingly led to believe in roiling heuristics, anthropic 
probabilities (miniscule in the large), and an utterly deep inelegance - 
perhaps including the abandonment of Occam's razor as well. 
12. what is simple falls through itself, crosses epistemologies, ontolog- 
ically slinks elsewhere.
13. what is simple is false.
14. what is inelegant is glorious.

[9:30:47 PM] Star Spider says: Are you around?
[9:31:23 PM] Alan Sondheim says: I'm around, sorry, playing music here
[9:31:36 PM] Star Spider says: hey no worries, quick question - do you 
have a title for your performance?
[9:31:44 PM] Alan Sondheim says: mess
[9:31:57 PM] Star Spider says: whoops haha
[9:31:59 PM] Star Spider says: sorry
[9:32:05 PM] Star Spider says: ok cool!
[9:32:08 PM] Alan Sondheim says: Mess is title yes
[9:32:11 PM] Star Spider says: Thanks!
[9:32:32 PM] Star Spider says: also...
[9:32:35 PM] Alan Sondheim says: No problem. Things seem more or less 
under control here. We should be coming in, barring the car breaking down, 
on Wednesday I think
[9:32:48 PM] Star Spider says: Sandy and I AvaTanz together ..
[9:32:55 PM] Star Spider says: What does this mean?
[9:33:07 PM] Star Spider says: Sandy and I AND AvaTanz?
[9:33:10 PM] Alan Sondheim says: Sandy Baldwin and I do an avatar dance 
together
[9:33:17 PM] Alan Sondheim says: Avatanz isn't a name.
[9:33:18 PM] Star Spider says: oooooh
[9:33:19 PM] Star Spider says: hahaha
[9:33:22 PM] Alan Sondheim says: Maybe use avadance instead
[9:33:26 PM] Star Spider says: cool :D
[9:33:31 PM] Alan Sondheim says: Maybe Sandy won't get on - don't know
[9:33:59 PM] Alan Sondheim says: He's in Austria which is why I need as 
much of an exact time as I can get either very early or very late so he 
can get up very early or go to bed very late
[9:34:03 PM] Alan Sondheim says: it's six hrs diff
[9:34:16 PM] Star Spider says: Do you mind if I mod the discription a bit?
[9:34:24 PM] Alan Sondheim says: actually so he can go to bed very late or 
get up very early
[9:34:25 PM] Alan Sondheim says: howso
[9:34:44 PM] Alan Sondheim says: ***MUST PASS CENSOR***
[9:34:50 PM] Alan Sondheim says: ***NO DIRTY WRDS***
[9:35:20 PM] Alan Sondheim says: asshole Sondheim and fucking Baldwin will 
perform shit ...
[9:35:25 PM] Alan Sondheim says: NOT TO BE USED
[9:35:50 PM] Star Spider says: hahaha
[9:35:52 PM] Star Spider says: nope
[9:35:54 PM] Star Spider says: 
Sandy Baldwin and Alan Sondheim AvaDance together, triggering objects to 
take them over, splurge on the chat, maybe have some sound at work beyond 
the usual click-clack, and work those altered mocap files at around 800 
meters transparent space. It is a piece about eroticism, memory of 
neighborhood, being-mess.
[9:36:36 PM] Alan Sondheim says: how about "prim-triggering takeover 
Dance"?
[9:36:43 PM] Alan Sondheim says: sounds too prosaic
[9:36:58 PM] Alan Sondheim says: I'm really too stupid to know what I'm 
doing so I have to dress the description up
[9:37:08 PM] Star Spider says: haha
[9:37:32 PM] Star Spider says: Um... like this?
[9:37:34 PM] Star Spider says: 
Sandy Baldwin and Alan Sondheim AvaDance together in a prim-triggering 
takeover Dance, splurge on the chat, maybe have some sound at work beyond 
the usual click-clack, and work those altered mocap files at around 800

neighborhood, being-mess.
[9:37:48 PM] Alan Sondheim says: anyway at my end what I do need for Fri 
and even Thurs rehearsal if poss is time -
[9:37:58 PM] Alan Sondheim says: Yes, but I'd run together as such:
[9:38:18 PM] Alan Sondheim says: "transparent space about erotics, 
neighborhood memory, being-mess"
[9:38:29 PM] Alan Sondheim says: instead of two sentences there - if 
that's ok
[9:38:48 PM] Alan Sondheim says: I have an audience to disappoint!
[9:41:13 PM] Star Spider says: So what?
[9:41:15 PM] Star Spider says: sorry
[9:41:43 PM] Alan Sondheim says: sorry practicing music again
[9:41:43 PM] Star Spider says: 
Sandy Baldwin and Alan Sondheim AvaDance together in a prim-triggering

[9:41:46 PM] Star Spider says: ?
[9:42:00 PM] Alan Sondheim says: yes great!
[9:42:34 PM] Star Spider says: oh Yay!
[9:43:55 PM] Star Spider says: Thanks Alan!
[9:44:06 PM] Alan Sondheim says: no problem. as soon as you have times, 
please let me know?
[9:45:51 PM] Star Spider says: The performance starts at 8pm!
[9:46:29 PM] Alan Sondheim says: that's for everyone, yes? but if I had an 
idea when I was going on, I could tell Sandy & send an announcement out to 
Sl - otherwise it's iffy of course.

Con/stall/ation

Check these out; both platform and cube move slowly; the viewpoint also 
went askew, everything tilted against the horizon. A performance might 
tilt just like that, certainly if some activated the stuff visible and 
invisible. So it goes.

My Hubris in Writing Itselves


A description of a talk for the Subtle Technologies gathering (Toronto), 
unpacking the following short abstract:

'The world, the body, the existent, have information in common; informa- 
tion is always already inscribed. The real and the virtual commingle; they 
appear separated only by virtue of a phenomenology of technology that 
emphasizes prosthetics and cyberspace as "additional" fields of research 
and perception. My work in the virtual world of Second Life describes 
space, sexuality, and body as problematic inscriptions which require 
negotiation within and without the Second Life environment. Inscriptions 
have no beginning and no end; they're holographic in a holographic 
universe. I'll explain, we'll look about.'


Information is a way of looking at the world; in-formation characterizes 
the world. The body looks at the world which is of and not of the body; 
the world is therefore abject, debris - almost, but not quite escaping. 
What escapes is articulated by mathesis; mathesis is our window on the 
existent. Mathesis grasps everything and nothing; an equation cannot 
_directly_ move an object, but describes its structure to the extent that 
its structure is nothing. Mathesis is what lies beyond the reach of the 
_gesture._

The _existent_ is almost entirely unobservable, process at a distance; 
beyond the imminent, the existent and mathesis coalesce. Neither copula 
nor protocol statement apply, and the verb 'to be' devolves, itself 
abject, inconceivable. (In fact, what is abject is inconceivable; what is 
conceivable is potentially parameterized.)

Information is always already inscribed: The world as imminent totality 
(which for us is a broken totality, broken immanence) possesses an onto- 
logy of inscriptions and an collocation of nearly decomposable epistemolo- 
gies. The ontology of inscriptions devolves as well to collocations of the 
ordinary.

The real and the virtual commingle, since there is no split, only a 
dividing-up of ontologies of the ordinary. Inscription is always virtual, 
always real; inscription is _neti neti,_ Sheffer-stroke and its dual 
fundamental. Don't mistake this for an ontology based on propositional 
logic - that, too, falls by the wayside.

'The real and the virtual commingle; they appear separated only by virtue 
of a phenomenology of technology that emphasizes prosthetics and cyber- 
space as "additional" fields of research and perception.' Let us think 
this through together. Technology implies progress, procedures, split, 
free and bound variables, mathesis, 'materiality'; phenomenology implies a 
deep and potentially fundamental structuration of 'world' in the broadest 
sense possible. We can define _broken phenomenology_ as a combination of 
phenomenology and heuristics of the imminent. Broken phenomenology _cannot 
be extrapolated._ Prosthetics is what engenders from exteriority; what 
might be diacritical, addendum; what bridges world-body and body-world; 
what in-forms body, forming-body. Prosthetics is sited, gestural - as 
usual in this thought, prosthetics is imminent.

All space is cyberspace, helmed, to the extent that space is _thought,_ 
related to the thinking-of space. All space is steerage in this sense. But 
what is at stake in the quote above is that of '"additional" fields of 
research and perception.' Research is not necessarily perception and 
perception is not necessarily research. Fields in the sense used here are 
ideological-cultural constructs, discursive formations, loosely defined 
domains. Now I am questioning through this '"additional"' separations that 
are explicate, not implicate (in the sense of Bohm's implicate order), 
and whose entanglements can ultimately, theoretically, be separated. Let 
us replace 'additional' with 'mess,' with 'more of the same,' with 'rasa' 
or 'tenor' and let us think through fields or fielding as wide and wild 
indefinite domains (wildernesses) of inscriptions, fields, particulations, 
intensifications, strange and other attractors. Let us think of the world 
as inherently _lossy,_ and by world I refer to potential 10^500 universes.

Here is the rest of the quote, which is fluff, descriptive of one project/ 
ing among many by many, and which doesn't necessarily map into the above: 
'My work in the virtual world of Second Life describes space, sexuality, 
and body as problematic inscriptions which require negotiation within and 
without the Second Life environment. Inscriptions have no beginning and no 
end; they're holographic in a holographic universe. I'll explain, we'll 
look about.' And what 'about' this? Second Life is a 'virtual world' in a 
technical sense that is a world which has a broken imminent ontology in 
relation to the avatar operator organism; it's a projection based on 
fundamental protocols and matheses. Within the server++ domain, SL is a 
totalization, total institution, and in this sense a _seriality_ (Sartre) 
as well. In a very classical sense, it is always already inscribed, 
channels of information constructed from binary encoding within deep 
potential wells. So my 'work' in SL is addenda, supplement - my 'work' in 
SL is the appearance of installations-within-the-virtual of SL, bending 
the local fabric of SL into patternings which are fundamentally the usual. 
Nothing new here at all. The installation then 'deals with' - is 'about' - 
inheres within the sememe - of body, space, sexuality, and deals with 
these in the in-forming of abject fields of indexicalities, negotiations 
of process and movement, crude effects of avatar presence or absence, and 
so forth. There's nothing more than the narratology implied, which, if it 
is a form of research at all, is a form depending on the psycho-analytics 
of inscription and inscriptive processes anywhere at all. But there's 
more: I argue that inscriptions and inscriptive processes are 'problem- 
atic,' problematized, by which I mean, there are no problems and no 
solutions, only the inhering _mess_ of entanglement and imminent domains. 
Now the negotiations of the subject organism (not object/avatar) are 
within and without the SL environment, by which I mean they are flux- 
states that are basically irresolute as well, and that tend to corrode law 
and justice (as well as subject and object) _everywhere,_ just as 
intellectual property is corroded among reals and virtuals, duplications 
and instantiations, variora and holograph editions, everywhen and 
everywhere. Think of such property as extended inscriptions and remember 
the old adage that there are no authors (bad paraphrase); one might see 
everything inhering, and in that sense might read Dufrenne's phenomenology 
of literary worlds as not only indefinite and imminent, but gesturing 
towards an inauthentic immanence, and in this gesturing, corroding 
everything: Literature, then, is a corrosion, not construction, of worlds 
(in the sense of worlds as habitus, inhabitations).

Again, 'Inscriptions have no beginning and no end; they're holographic in 
a holographic universe. I'll explain, we'll look about.' 'Holographic' 
references Susskind's theory, of which I have nothing to say (not being- 
physicist, string or otherwise), but it also references a modeling of 
entangling in such a manner as perception (read 'theory' as well) is 
blurred, domainless, holography modeling itselves within itselves. Sooner 
or later these 'quick' broken epistemologies and ontologies will replace 
the older classical models; sooner or later the universe (world, cosmos) 
will be recognized as fast-forward fast-backward slow-forward slow-back- 
ward among inconceivable (broken) orders of magnitude; psychoanalysis 
pales as domains fall into alien abjections which are deeply unknowable. 
The hall of mirrors requires quick-depth disorderings.

I say 'I'll explain' but there is no explanation, not on this level any- 
way, nothing of the physics or mathesis of it, embedded almost as if in 
defiance of the 'real.' Or the explanation is without concept of origins, 
neither punctum nor 'turtles all the way down' nor mutual creating and 
recursion. Or the anecdotal is all that's left. 

I say 'we'll look about' this is nothing but a reference to the particu- 
lar installation, 'about' the usual confine. And of course in looking, am 
I not your prosthesis, to the extent that I am not?


(Note in relation to a discussion on wryting-l: I think that cyberspace is
the same old space, and that scientists are the only philosophers perhaps
that s/matter. And perhaps all of these terms are dead; in any case, what
I was getting at is the notion of a broken phenomenology, broken philoso-
phy, certainly to the extent that these terms are still in use. The
physical world is beyond comprehension, except for mathesis, which doesn't
model back into the (perceptual) real. I find myself more and more
interested in physics, mathematics; these seem more illuminating than
literature per se does, especially given the utterly alien nature of the
world; how does one perceive, for example, Planck space or time? D-branes?
It's there in the math, not in the hand - I can't make the leap, and I
don't think it's a failure of imagination.)



How I Cheat


I'm forever borrowing scripts and remaking them, impressing big important 
people with my programming ability when I have none at all.

A few tiny bounce commands when an avatar comes near and I have a super 
fantastic interactive installation.

Particle physics gone just a bit amuck makes it look like I crafted models 
of black holes and Large Hadron Collider targets.

Weird twangy objects make everything look lumpy and complicated just like 
the early pre-galactic universe.

Importing abject and bizarre body textures makes silly shapes appear 
really risky and out of control.

Borrowing terms from psychoanalysis and science gives my stuff a legitima- 
ted edge.

A few wobbly movements and it seems as if I've taken physics in hand and 
bent it to my purpose.

Taking down buildings and other stuff and calling it deconstruction gives 
it theory-advantage.

Endless advertising pumps up my things like inflationary universes in 
their own tiny bubbles.

Referencing other artworks by not referencing other artworks is so cool I 
gain panache.

Keeping words out of the installations makes them appear mysterious and 
dark.

Making things slightly transparent increases their complexity without 
really doing anything much.

Letting stuff rotate beyond raster limits makes movement appear incredibly 
sophisticated instead of it being just the inability of video-cards to 
keep up.

Obscure names for shows act like ultra-cool sunglasses hiding nothing 
much to see.

Confessing pain and obsession creates empathy and guilt in an otherwise 
critical audience.

Networking makes me seem like a real know-it-all who knows it all.

There's nothing like an avatar jumping about to make it appear that I'm a 
master at script-writing.

Leaving some stuff unfinished shows what a busy creature I am.

Weird sound creates shortcuts to making environments out of very little.

Silence gives things a deep conceptual edge.

Making stuff transparent so avatars bump into it gives an illusion of 
control and brilliant but invisible architecture.

Just build something as big as possible and it seems like you're a master 
of a virtual universe.

Never imitating 'real' objects creates the feeling of real unworldliness 
as if the alien is under my command.

Ending lists like these abruptly makes it appear that I have so much to 
say I don't really know when to stop.



clumped radiate music on the Toba hasapi


rough steady-beats with micro-events 'throwing things' off - 
it's like a particle counter determined by mistakes, boredom, rhythm
changes: things appear against background radiation.

(as if the metaphor holds).

so that the sound/work is organized, not by melody/harmony/rhythm or
improvisation, but by _body twitches,_ derailed muscle-memory,
momentary fugue-states.

it's as if the listener were _inside-me,_ listening to the body in a
mode of production, likewise listening to the production itself, through
the body.

the hegelung playing is similar.

the problem with fretted/chromatic instruments: the second or third are
obdurate: march and waltz, mourn and yearn. 

they slide on the hasapi, paralleling hegelung and anything that comes
to mind, but a problem with hearing the intervals: i'm constantly 
correcting, not all that well indeed, but quickly, 'one way or another.'

but music organizing itself against a background of music organizing
itself in any case.

organizing through not unorganizing but a-organizing, it happens, it
murmurs within, the result of what's usually taken to be supplement, 
diacritical noise, the curlicue.

never the same but always within the clumped radiate.

later i might say elsewise, some when, where, else, others. 

as if we're talking and something 'just came to mind.'

or something 'just came to mind' between us, we're not sure who thought
of what, who had the first idea, the idea first. 

or talking to oneself, the same; you're breathing, your breath seems to
stop for a moment, what might have appeared to be an event.

but always for a moment, then gone, then background maybe shaking a bit,
then dampening, then settling back in, perhaps the same or something
slightly different or something one might not remember, maybe not that
different, maybe so.

Erosore


What can one say about an image with _an inverted punctum,_ _as if there's 
no tomorrow,_ _as if the skin sees and withdraws, blushing, avoiding, what 
exists beneath the eyelid?_ The image is _too perfect for theory,_ _not a 
blemish to be seen,_ _text from the past for you,_ _past text somewhere in 
the future,_ to _draw out its implications,_ _unveil its perfections for 
one and all._

Talking points (OCAD talk)


1. The virtual and real are united by inscription: inscription is a form
of mark. 

2. The body is always already inscribed.

3. A 'metric' is associated with every phenomenology - a certain _tenor_
of behavior, style of inscription.

4. The 'metric' sets forth 'geodesics,' paths of least resistance; it's
easiest to construct along them - in which case what might be considered
'corporate style' dominates.

5. There is always the possibility of the cheat, kludge, or hack:
a. Cheat: something appearing as more or less than it is, something
'magical.'
b. Kludge: making do, using available tech: the clumsy.
c. Hack: beneath the surface, something doing something it wasn't 
'intended' to do. Along this line: reality was intended to _do nothing_
of course. 

6. Inscription is information; the more information, the less entropy.
Information is of various sorts:
a. Autonomous: Information within event horizons (black holes, universes).
b. Intended: Information created by _agency_ - in which case one might
speak of residue and parasitism.
c. Unintended: residue or trace.

7. In my work I want to make a mess, something apparently disordered,
something _abject._
a. Abject because impossible to disentangle.
b. The world is deeply entangled.
c. Outside of narrative, the world is _inherently_ entangled.
d. Through reduction, narrative tries to make sense of the world.
e. Through expansion, non-narratives inhabit it, i.e. are _equivalent_
'one way or another.'

8. Intended or interpreted information:
Information is a way of looking at the world; in-formation characterizes 
the world. The body looks at the world which is of and not of the body; 
the world is therefore abject, debris - almost, but not quite escaping. 
What escapes is articulated by mathesis; mathesis is our window on the 
existent. Mathesis grasps everything and nothing; an equation cannot 
_directly_ move an object, but describes its structure to the extent that 
its structure is nothing. Mathesis is what lies beyond the reach of the 
_gesture._

9. The ontology of mathesis is neither real nor virtual: Mathematics, in
other words, is elsewhere.

10 The more the universe is 'comprehended' in terms of fundamental
characteristics, the greater the mathesis required.

11. Eventually mathesis dominates and the use of 'proper models' falls by
the wayside.

12. The question: 'How are we' within the alien - i.e. within a knowledge
that we occur, inhabit, the alien?




Enjoy. I kludged. I make mistakes.


Some text of Sandy Baldwin and myself kludging through performances -

This includes last night's which was terrific at Subtle Tech To.
Sandy logged in from Austria, a small village which looked terrific too
on Google but the connection was slow on and off, anyway.
I did many mistakes.
At my end I bounced around. I had:
Julu Twine on laptop one, not projected, particles turned off, sound
turned on.
Alan Dojoji on laptop two, projected, particles on, sound turned off.
We were all in the same space. 
Sandy ran text. Sometimes it showed, sometimes not.
I ran minor text. Sometimes it showed, sometimes not.
When Sandy's text showed, mine didn't.
When my text showed, Sandy's didn't.

[2009/02/11 8:35]  sandy Taifun: where are you by the way?
[2009/02/11 8:35]  sandy Taifun: aaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2009/02/11 8:50]  sandy Taifun: i keep bumbping into things and getting 
teleported away
[2009/02/11 8:55]  Julu Twine: lways to set a landmark, teleport out of 
there.

nevertheless bound by someone's concept of physics, virtual and otherwise.

physics of ostensible three-dimensionality and ordinary phase rules.

no magnets but seduction of voice and image beckoning you onward.

the performance is a gaping maw in the gaping maw of Second Life.

all orgasms possess kernels of fantasy, terror, loss and recuperation.

this is a beautiful installation which will be rendered harmless in its 
absence.

the width of a skin is a pixel.

the width of your body is four centimeters.

can do things - im when you want me to start in
[2009/06/12 16:56]  Julu Twine: hi sandy, technical difficulties here
[2009/06/12 16:56]  Julu Twine: had to change laptops at the last minute

are before yours did mine didn't

1. The virtual and real are united by inscription: inscription is a form
of mark. 

2. The body is always already inscribed.

3. A 'metric' is associated with every phenomenology - a certain _tenor_
of behavior, style of inscription.

4. The 'metric' sets forth 'geodesics,' paths of least resistance; it's
easiest to construct along them - in which case what might be considered
'corporate style' dominates.

5. There is always the possibility of the cheat, kludge, or hack:
a. Cheat: something appearing as more or less than it is, something
'magical.'
b. Kludge: making do, using available tech: the clumsy.
c. Hack: beneath the surface, something doing something it wasn't 
'intended' to do. Along this line: reality was intended to _do nothing_
of course.

8. Intended or interpreted information:
Information is a way of looking at the world; in-formation characterizes 
the world. The body looks at the world which is of and not of the body; 
the world is therefore abject, debris - almost, but not quite escaping. 
What escapes is articulated by mathesis; mathesis is our window on the 
existent. Mathesis grasps everything and nothing; an equation cannot 
_directly_ move an object, but describes its structure to the extent that 
its structure is nothing. Mathesis is what lies beyond the reach of the 
_gesture._

9. The ontology of mathesis is neither real nor virtual: Mathematics, in
other words, is elsewhere.

10 The more the universe is 'comprehended' in terms of fundamental
characteristics, the greater the mathesis required.

11. Eventually mathesis dominates and the use of 'proper models' falls by
the wayside.

12. The question: 'How are we' within the alien - i.e. within a knowledge
that we occur, inhabit, the alien?

There are networks everywhere in my work: networks of viewers, collab- 
orators, responsive objects, negotiable spaces, Biovision Hierarchy files 
(.bvh), parent/child relationships. Generally, networks are characterized 
by deep and surface metrics and geodesics. The dynamics of networks are 
characterized by the cheat, the kludge, and the hack. Physics is the clean 
hack.\net

\net

A phenomenology is a description of a landscape and habitus in dialog. The 
tenor of a phenomenology is its dynamics, its 'rasa.' \net

\net

The metric of a phenomenology is its underlying fuzzy structure; the 
metric undergoes continuous transformation since habitus and landscape are 
dynamic. Transformation sends f(x) -> f(x'). There are surface and deep 
metrics. The deep metrics constitute protocol space where x is always 
preserved. The surface metrics constitute a supple space dependent upon 
the deep metrics for their dynamics. The surface metrics may undergo 
'ragged' transforms within which information is created or annihilated. 
\net

\net

The surface metrics are dependent upon the deep metrics. The deep metrics 
tend to exist as mathesis; in other words, they are, more often than not 
related to the metrics of space-time. The surface metrics are cultural 
artifacts. The surface metric tend towards _corporate style._\net

\net

Geodesics in the surface metrics are paths of least resistance; their 
determination is both psychological (i.e. 'this' choice and not 'that') 
and topographic ('this' choice created through the metrics is the simplest 
choice possible). An example of the former: rectilinear text and graphics 
within an html environment. An example of the latter: an avatar 'falling' 
a kilometer in Second Life. \net

\net

The surface metric is susceptible to habitus short-cutting: Cheat, kludge, 
and hack. The cheat is 'something appearing as more or less than it is,' 
something 'magical.' The cheat involves symbolic manipulation which may be 
constituted by a formal series of (fuzzy) operations. The kludge is 
'making do, using available technology, employing the clumsy or inelegant 
if it produces acceptable results. The kludge is abject. The hack is 
'beneath the surface, something doing something it wasn't "intended" to 
do.\net

\net

The habitus of the real is the cheat, the kludge, and the hack. The cheat: 
Manipulation by proxy. The kludge: Manipulation by experiment 'at hand.' 
The hack: Exposure, subterfuge, the cleaning-up of the kludge. Physics is 
the clean hack. \net

\net

The 'true,' the 'beautiful,' the 'good,' are names of legitimation 
processes applied to phenomenologies. Otherwise of course: There is no 
intention or meaning 'to' or 'of' the real. \net
