new years 2010, let us hope for better

and the approach of the occidental new year's day. we continue to hear
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926,
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
hangup (0:00:00) "can't be helped! it's a new year and teachers revolve!"
january, 1859, on the first day of the new year, willsey writes:
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
architecture for a new year:
architecture for a new year:
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 

the distant sounds of the vehicles, as if there were something more, to 
the new-born world beyond the lanes of highways tremulously cut through
wilderness such as no man or woman had seen before.

it was as if cities of wilderness, great trees and thoroughfares, emerged
quietly through the hushed mists of distant waterfalls, where teachers 
revolve.

let us hope for a new year's architecture, tremulously gliding among
the soft loams and mosses of our memory, let us hope for pain's cessation, 
for a brief and murmuring time when worries disappear, so many waterfalls, 
so much beauty and wonder in the new-born world.

it is january, 1859, and, trembling, january 2010 is heard among the 
flares of distant trumpets.

silence, and being whispers, darkness, and being softly illuminates the
new-born world.


Radical Disconnectivity

I imagine a _radical disconnectivity_ characterizing the fundamental tenor 
of the cosmos; if one grants event horizons their proper epistemological 
status, this is where one ends up, literally. (Bell's theorem, EPR, has 
their limits.)

In which case, A and B have _no_ relation whatsoever, no communicative (or 
other) potential whatsoever. A simple symmetric operation, within which a 
chain might exist - for example, if A@B symbolizes this, then one might 
possibly have A@B but A-@C & C-@B: but this is mythology. Precisely 
because this is mythology, the disconnection is _radical_ and irreducible.

We have become increasingly deluded by models based on Indra's Net, or 
internets: skein- or membrane-models where every node conceivably reflects 
every other, and where every node is conceivably accessible from every 
other. Further, this models implies an organicity, an influence-machine or 
holism, a unification of effect, if not affect - something of comfort.

As thought experiment, one can imagine a radical disassociation with 
oneself, such that one is relegated to regions far beyond the panoptical, 
or optical for that _matter._ Here one is safe with one's regrets and 
errors; here, catatonia is the natural order of things. I say that the 
catatonic is the _natural_ order of things; I say that stillness and 
isolation are the basic elements of life - not Gaia and integration, but 
something unnamed characterized by _differentiation._ 

This is the natural state of humankind, the natural state of organism, 
which masquerades as network, not defect. Left to its own devices, human- 
ity continues with the radical disconnection of its home planet, a taking- 
apart beginning with children and watches, ending with slaughter and 
corroded memory. (This if the world is 'all that is the case,' its latch 
is broken, and what was within has been always already desecrated and 
stolen.)

(I will leave you with this, as if I were to leave myself.)
I will leave you with this, as if I were to leave myself.

last

it's not the last time i saw her was simply the last time she appeared to 
me, but more, that she disappeared into the buzzing information-laden, 
and entangled world, that no extrication was possible, that death 
consisted in multitudes of disappearances like these, the last flash of 
lightning or glass milk bottle, or earmuffs and shoveling in one's final 
blizzard - there are any number of examples, and as death approaches, the 
lasts increase in quantity, until the whole vast world is an inaudible 
chorus of lasts, an event horizon beyond which there is nothing to be 
heard, or remembered, or retained. our lives pare away at our lives with 
the incessant mumbling of the addicted, and we live in exhaustion holding 
the world at bay. always the supports give out, always the last confused 
sounds, sights and smells, always the last murmured word, but always the 
last.



you might have seen these somewhere

just found these hiding, from the avagasm series which was mainly
mp4s. at least i think they were hiding. are all those bodies the
same - really? s/he jumps about running through film frames in
unison. what's that about? i find my eyes wandering to what appear
to be genitals in rabid duplication. are they? why the color of
candy? edible?


fucking bad luck

for the third time our building got hit with a vehicle today
this time it was a van slamming into the front, smashing the first-
story wall, you can see daylight through it, another day in the fucking
neighborhood
goddamn the bastard driving the fucking useless van may he rot in hell
for the first time we're being fined for having scaffolding for two
years on the building
we're trying to repair the leaks which are the result of porous mortar
put in by a maverick company which cut corners
the building had to be shored up after being hit by a car
fuck the driver of the car may he rot in hell
the leaks can't be fixed, the whole wall leaks
we're broke and we don't want to take the scaffolding down and put it
up again
goddamn the city bastards and the corporate bastards who are out to 
get us
more people i know have no health insurance and health problems
goddamn the republicans and democrats who didn't pass the public option
i hope they die of painful diseases begging hospitals to take them in
without a cent in their pockets
just like my friend who died of cancer wallowing in his own shit
for that matter let's kill all the republicans and their concentration
camp followers
let's kill everyone
i want to kill everyone what's wrong with me
i want the rich to fucking suffer until they're screaming with pain
i don't give a shit about ideology, i just want them to fucking suffer
fucking religious bastards everywhere making life miserable for just
about everyone
i don't give a shit about analyzing our 'current condition'
fuck our 'current condition'
across the street ratner's finally building his huge stupid project
people i know were kicked out of their apartments because of eminent 
domain
goddamn motherfucker ratner i hope he rots in this life since there's 
no hell i hope he gets unnameable diseases and crawls to hospitals that
won't take him in but fine him for his scaffolding and run him over
repeatedly with an out-of-control van as the goddamn building wall 
falls down on top of him crushing his skull against the soon-to-be
homeless people he's making along with the big banks and their
fucking limos that cruise this areas looking for a lousy fix from
goddamn government usa, i hope ratner rots and his body gets eaten by 
rats that are all over our street, and they pluck his eyes out and
eat them too and then the rats can see what kind of a fucking world
we're making, last time i knew neighborhood boys were hammering them
to death with boards
i liked this place better when crack was around



now what

rendering exhaustion complete, labia
perform tropism, clustered molecular
channels woven from axiomatic under-
lain that fabric too popularly named
the grid, matrix, or other fanciful,
word on the verge of collapse, there
is no other, that's the problem. no really, there is no other, what on
earth stupid sloop, just shows what
tiredness brings, on when you least 
expect it

Foofwa d.Imobilite/Neopost Ahrrrt
Musings and Involuntaries 1.6
January 21 . January 23 at 8:00pm, January 24 at 3:00pm
Post show discussion moderated by Nancy Dalva on January 21st

The efforts of Foofwa d'Imobilite and collaborators Alan Sondheim and 
Azure Carter result in Involuntaries 1.6, a world premiere that saunters 
along the edge of reason. The US premiere, Musings, is a collaboration 
with lighting designer Jonathan O.Hear and reflects on the ideas of icons; 
John Cage and the late Merce Cunningham. The performance will also include 
the screening of videos by Foofwa d'Imobilite and Alan Sondheim.

Musings should have been a duet and will bear the mark and weight of 
absences, hence its subtitle: "solitary duet." The piece is structured in 
a succession of several "musings," separated by nothingness.

The title implies the notions of "daydreams," "meditations," "reflec- 
tions," "studies" and "introspections." Each "musing" includes a moment of 
meditative study around some of Merce Cunningham.s and John Cage's ideas - 
independence of dance and music, using chance as a way to make artistic 
decisions and Zen Buddhist philosophy applied to theatrical art = adding a 
curious and lively look to it. - Foofwa d'Imobilite

"If you want to understand what they.re about, perhaps these works will 
open up the vast chasm of comprehension on the edge of falling apart - I 
can't think of any better pieces in this regard, and, for that matter, in 
the sheer beauty of fractured movement." - from Breaking New Ground by 
Alan Sondheim


For the DNA performance, we are screening several videotapes illustrating 
body performance in real and virtual worlds.

One of the things that has been most important for us has been the bridges 
between "real" and "virtual" worlds. The two are intertwined, and I 
believe that the "real" body is a cultural production, virtual in a way as 
well. Foofwa moves among any number of worlds, as do my avatars and online 
work; at times it is difficult to know where virtual worlds begin and the 
real ones (for there are more than one) end. We have been able to explore 
these issues, as well as those of "technological" and "natural" movements, 
consistently throughout our projects.



Foofwa d'Imobilite

Born Fredric Gafner in Geneva in 1969 from parents in dance and 
photography, Foofwa d'Imobilite studied at the Ecole de Danse de Genve and 
was a member of the Geneva-based Ballet Junior. He danced professionally 
with the Stuttgart Ballet in Germany (1987-1990) and with the Merce 
Cunningham Dance Company, in New-York (1991-1998). In 1998, he started his 
own work with solos and duets. Basing himself in Geneva, he founded

Archive Index Text and My Avatars


here's a list of all the digital work I have done online from 1994-pres- 
ent, in tree form, assembled for archiving. it also includes files from my 
collaborations (with Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure Carter, others), and 
various other files, texts, etc. it's longer than I thought it would be.

http://www.alansondheim.org/archex.txt 
http://www.alansondheim.org/archelim.txt (gross eliminate of duplicate 
names)

2000-3000 videos (different)
28000 images (around, different)
900 sound/music (different)
1400 texts, programs, digital obj files etc. (different)

it's weirdly interesting. it doesn't include iso files, Second Life full 
.avi video files, personal stuff. it runs about 830 gigabytes, would be 
larger w/ the additions.

I am a shaman without redemption or belief.
I am pummeled fingers and blue electric hair.
My hair wraps your eyes when they leave your body.
My hair of cobalt on leashes of zinc and tin.
I have done enough to bury my body in text.
My body of text is my body of noise and hair.

lullabies with babies breaking branches
yet surprisingly surviving all the fall
and wondering at the pondering of number
skittered song across the floor of 
regulated number, strict upon haunches,
close to the wall, yet thriving,
creaking stanchions, nothing more than
may-bees, so many wrong, loss, deriving,
set, quaking, peeking, long

some things on the music borne towards and around this performance


==================================================================


I play what I cannot play; I play at the limits of what I can play; 
I play into those ragged limits; I play within the seduction of
failure. 

Every time I play, I play what I play every time, that is, the full
potential of what I can play at those limits. Every time is duplicate
of every other; every time is absolutely unique.

At the edge of failure, the ragged becomes the content - what can't
be controlled, understood, subsumed - what might never come again -
what are permanent limits (and what are limits to be overcome).

If I know how to play this, I will abandon this. If I know how to 
structure that, I will leave that behind. My music is a music of
deconstruction, dissimulation. My music is not a music of completion
or virtuosity. My music takes virtuosity to its limit, not through
a flatness of unknowing, but through a landscape that denies
organism itself, forbids entry. I rage at the ragged gates.

The signature and style of my music is this raggedness, which is
mine. You hear the limits of my ability, the limits of my body, 
the delineation of these limits. This is a unique aesthetic which
goes nowhere but embraces failure.


==================================================================


avoidance of noise ,then how to schedule fury
or furious ,how to subtend silence

i don't want this thinking: that this is exploring instrument,
instrumentality ,nor a field ,subtended by fingers or mouth ,no more
than body

it is all resonance ,surprising ,metallic overtones ,ringing: i
remember just several sounds slowed into what seemed right even
then emptied virtuosities

stringed, it is stringing ,perfect tautness ,resistance of parallel
field ,tension of endpoint separation ,tension of separation

i do not want to duplicate this ,i do not want to duplicate an other

something informing ,hypnagogic as if you might dream this ,an other
or dream an other this

but not tiring ,tirade ,more of a space of a sounding or what might be
'some of a sound'

of mewling ,howling ,whimpering ,murmuring ,seething ,then this release

tending the wood ,nylon ,skin ,metal ,plastic ,catgut ,horsehair ,wax,

O'Hear used his modified computer program with a 6x8 grid of Fresnel 
lights above the stage; these left positive and negative fields with 
trails, shudders, and so forth. everything seemed possible. the space 
became a sweet soup of movement, light as performer. the theater 
disappeared of course, a memory or secondary emanation dying out, 
architecture of event horizons. it was as if light itself was illuminated 
by things, light escaping or returning, light questioning being, not 
(only) the being of light itself. the stage _veers,_ being and Beings 
dissolve in organism's embedding.

Wildman and Sometimes Poet

   "Foofwa d'Imobilit?/Neopost Ahrrrt"
   Dance New Amsterdam
   New York, NY
   January 22, 2010
   By Martha Sherman
   Copyright ? 2010 by Martha Sherman

   Foofwa6_FlorenceBaratay His adopted name sounds like an exhalation of
   breath propelled by a laugh or a punch in the gut. Foofwa d'Imobilit?,
   Swiss-born as Fr?d?ric Gafner, has deep roots in ballet and in the
   movement and legacy of Merce Cunningham, who he honors along with John
   Cage in the US premiere of "Musings." The first segment of a three-part
   evening, this piece was a fanciful wander through strong, disciplined
   ballet and Cunningham-inspired movement, splashed with Foofwa's own
   particular jerks, undulations, and quirks. It was an endurance test for
   the audience as well as the artist.

   Each of several scenes had its own character, notable at first by his
   verbal accompaniment of the movement - in noises, hums, clicking or
   poetry. Foofwa played a chess game of movement cross a white stage,
   with light grid lines. His leaps and turns drew horizontal, vertical or
   diagonal lines along the grid. Characterizing the piece as a "solitary
   duet," his partner was the light (designed by Jonathan O'Hear) which
   tracked Foofwa's direction and motion. He seemed to be keeping himself
   happy company, as well, a private smile playing on his lips.  When he
   occasionally alerted the audience that he had messed up a complicated
   word sequence, it was clear that he didn't really feel alone.

   Foofwa created his eye-catching costume, a brightly painted body with
   collages of flotsam. Big blue arrows trailed down his muscular legs,
   and his torso, legs, and arms were a riot of color. Watching his body
   move and sing, he evoked mythical creatures, a satyr with pounding
   hooves or a prancing faun. He transformed into a multi-colored creature
   with a beautiful entrechat paired with a backward crab walk. Later, his
   body sank into a deep squat; his vocalizing of "bums" deepened from a
   quick tune to a slow tolling and his legs framed an enormous body bell.

   As the dance progressed, the melting body paint smeared the white
   stage, papers pulled from his body; as his voice and lungs were
   impacted by the exertions of the movement, the vocalizations were laced
   with heaving.

   After a crisp set of balletic extensions, Foofwa sang a quick folk song
   "Skip, turn, and tilt," then collapsed heaving to the ground into a
   blackout. In the long final scene, the dancer played with a series of
   toys - balloons, mushroom shaped pieces, musical media (CDs, audio
   tapes.) He played, recited texts, spoke to us, checked a watch
   frequently. The complexity and interweaving of ideas were impressive,
   but tiring.

   Foofwa5_FlorenceBaratay The earlier movements were accompanied by noise
   and hums, later by poems and declarations, most to or about Merce
   Cunningham. The transformations were a cacophony of choices; this was
   not Cunningham's movement in its pristine clarity. Although a master of
   the core movement, Foofwa's choreography is anything but cool or
   removed.

   The world premiere of "Involuntaries 1-6" was presented after a
   30-minute interlude with video, while Foofwa showered and changed (one
   of the many updates he offered the audience, as he shooed us out after
   the "Musings" curtain call.) The videos were short scenes of live body
   shots interlaced with computer-graphically generated images of
   impossibly twisted limbs, elbows and knees, figures floating out of
   gravity. The accompaniment was by Foofwa's talented musical
   collaborator, Alan Sondheim. It was a useful entr'acte, because it
   eased the transition into a very different second live performance, one
   that moved from tiring to painful.

   On a bare stage, with windows to the outside world visible and the
   rehearsal mirror reflecting from stage right, Sondheim sat, strumming
   one of the many exotic stringed instruments that surrounded him,
   including an electric Egyptian oud, cura cumbus and yayli tanbur, along
   with a recognizable classical guitar. Foofwa, standing at the edge of
   the lit stage, wandered casually in his street clothes, although
   several costumes were strewn around the floor. Azure Carter joined
   them, first at the microphone, providing strange spoken-sung lyrics.

   The same twisted limbs of the video came alive in this piece, images
   that were clearly created not from imagination but from Foofwa's body
   and its capacities.  Now we saw this body's harsh edges and disturbing
   imbalances. Over the course of the six scenes, Sondheim played edgy
   exciting compositions, as Foofwa danced increasingly disturbing
   movement. From jerking in large frantic kicks and slapping his body, he
   moved to a rigid chair which he used as the fulcrum of wild diagonal
   motion. The leaps and gyrations were powerful and exhausting to watch
   (and listen to, as his breath became more labored.)

   By the fifth and sixth movements, his body slammed wildly to the floor
   and across the stage, a modern full-body version of religious
   self-scourge. Sondheim moved from instrument to instrument in a
   relentless parade. Carter, floating through the piece as in a dream,
   preened in a red dress in the rehearsal mirror,  distanced from the
   punishing central movement and energy. Finally, Foofwa looked at
   Sondheim and exhaled "that's it." In the middle of a musical line, the
   dance stopped, the lights went black. The piece, and its raggedly edged
   ending left the audience panting, too.

   In addition to re-naming himself, Foofwa is not shy about naming and
   describing anything else in his production. The on-stage music
   creations for "Musings," are entitled Cage a cappella; his body painted
   costume is called Close to Rauschenberg's skin. His program notes
   include descriptions of these "titlings" along with several poems. The
   movement itself, from powerful clean physicality to torturous body
   slamming, doesn't retreat an inch: a challenge rather than an offer.

   The naming, the dense program notes, his urge to converse with the
   audience from within the piece and around its edges are among the many
   ways Foofwa yearns to reach us. In the aggregate, it is all too much -
   but, sometimes, through all the cacophony, he succeeds.

Wryting and


Wryting is clotted inscription, that is, writing inextricably merged with 
flesh, body, organism; culture is the systemics and poetics of wryting.

On one hand, writing is digital, discrete, disconnected; on the other, it 
is analogic flux, debris, corroded, syntactics pervaded by aura of scent, 
gesture, tonalities, and so forth. Writing is always wryting, always 
entangled with the fuzzy modalities of its production, virtual and 
material.

Wryting spews through sexual fantasy, obsessive thinking, compulsion 
behavior; it is never the purity of signal and channel. Even with digital 
code, interpretation blurs and moves through striations and membranes in 
an irreducible hermeneutics.

The kernel of wryting is encoding, hermeneutics, protocols, and protocol 
membranes or suites; legible code is illegible, illegible code is legible. 
There is no coding without temporal coding, no wryting without immersion, 
no wryting in time, no time for wryting. 

All wryting entangles with poetics, poesis, autopoesis, impulse and drive; 
all wryting accounts-for, is accountable, is unaccountable. Death and 
untoward pain are wryting's dissolution; healing coagulates wryting in 
similar formations. Death is the cessation of wryting formations, and the 
promulgating of skeins of new wryting formations, among cultures and 
organisms. 

Culture is all the way down, from one life-form to another; culture is 
always inscription, always wryting. Wryting wrytes and is wrytten; what is 
wrytten and what has been wrytten, wrytes.

It is impossible to isolate the discrete on the quantum level; think 
instead of the granularity and corrosion of the symbolic. Interpretation 
is meaning; wryting is never meaningless; the presence of a sign is 
already a deconstruction of presence.

(A boy sees a mark in a field; a boy sees a mark on his body; a girl sees 
a mark in a field a girl sees a mark on her body. A girl has a history; a 
boy has a history. A boy reads a history of a girl; a girl reads a history 
of a boy. A girl reads a book; a girl scents; a boy reads a book; a boy 
scents. An organism sees a mark in a field; an organism sees a mark on its 
body. An organism has a history; reads; scents.)

All protocols are protocol suites. (All readings and wrytings and hearings 
and scentings are protocol suites. The organism hears the boy and the 
girl; the boy and the girl hear the girl and the boy.) All protocol suites 
promise the premise of fit; the premise of fixture; the premise of corral; 
the premise of potential well; the potential of fetish; the maternal 
premise and the paternal premise; the premise of home; the premise of 
meaning; the premise of comprehension; the premise of hermeneutics; the 
premise of spirit.

All codes are entangled in all bodies; all bodies are entangled in all 
cultures; in all codes; in all protocol suites. The poetics of the world 
is what one might think of a day; of a night; what one might think. The 
poesis of the world inhabits death; death inhabits the poesis of the 
world; poetics is a casting; poetics is a casting-off; is unnecessary; 
think the poesis of the virtual vacuum; think the poesis of the black 
hole; of information; of the corruption and corrosion of information; of 
the body and the death of the body; of the recuperation of the body by 
bodies. (Of the recuperation and decoding of the sexual body: sexuality is 
always a decoding.)

The protocol sentence is a half-truth; is an institution; what is declared 
has disappeared; what is declared is declared unentangled; is declared 
discrete. Poetics recuperates poesis for an organism of interest; for an 
interested organism. What is declared is lost; is already lost; is always 
already lost. Loss inhabits the symbol; inhabits wryting; wryting inhabits 
death; death inhabits writing. A inhabits B; B inhabits A; A portends B; B 
portends A; A interprets B; B interprets A; A entangles B; B entangles A; 
{A}{B} entangles { }. Wryting and culture inhabit rites of purification; 
purification makes a hedge around the symbol; around the symbolic; the 
hedge makes the symbolic possible; the hedge is the potential well of 
meaning. How may one wryte wryting? One may not; wryting wrytes elsewhere; 
wryting wrytes otherwise; wryting never just wrytes. Wryting is the 
wrything of the hermeneutic; wryting is imminent and immanent; wryting is 
a long way off; how may one wryte otherwise? (Desire wrytes otherwise, 
does it knot?)

A story is that which has no story to tell; a story which is all the story 
there is; a wryting.


Bones

In honor of the American (US) television show, Bones, with its 
irresolution of psychotic relationships among the main characters.
"Not to mention a fine SL video, if I do say so myself."*

*Is such a statement performative; is the subjunctive always performative? 
(In the sense of evanescent fading. The performative doesn't lie in the 
fineness of the video, but in the potential for speech proffered and then 
withdrawn - or perhaps not withdrawn. The statement itself presences such 
speech; it's already stated, give status as possibility. But because it is 
_me_ saying it, then in fact I do say so, but not as declarative, only as 
subjunctive, as if it might be sight / might have been said. The outcome 
is never clear (nor is the quality of the video), making such a statement
uncanny, ontologically wavering, neither made nor unmade. Perhaps the "if 
I do say so myself" underlies _every_ utterance, undercuts and withdraws, 
as if the perceived and heard world were fantasm. And that is the truth, 
since it is death that may cut, cauterize, deny the _second_ saying, as if 
"for I do say so myself" - but that is not the case - the case is _if,_ 
presupposing, without cause or reason, that the utterance might be spoken, 
might still be spoken, that the speaker is still alive.

Wryting, Culling Wryting


Inscription tethered _concretely_ to wryting, protolanguage, body parts, 
and the fetish, that it is a _function_ thereby of wryting and not ideal- 
ized. Think of it as substance, with a certain inertness, sturdiness. Thus 
truth as function of wryting shines with the wryting of sheep, goats, 
grain, rice, papyrus, jewels, and other tabulations. So wryting is a term 
configured for _this_ space, extending backwards and others come into play 
here; mathematically, it encompasses the abacus and phenomenologies of 
enumeration. And wryting is any and all of this, intensifications, terri- 
tories, the accountancy of natural kinds, never the preclusion of the 
ontology of the written. In other words, becoming-wryting - spelled with a 
"y" - a state of material / maternal writing, and so forth. And so forth: 
Wryting is the accounting of the desire of the subject. I call "wryting" 
the impulse towards _concretion_ or the _grain of the inscription,_ 
however configured; I wryte myself out of it; I wryte through writing, and 
the act of wryting. Again, writing, which embodies a projected body, I 
call _wryting,_ since it might be considered a performative personality or 
body, Julu said, structured against defuge, or the depressive harboring of 
impure flesh: but then of these as well. And culture itself? flesh, body, 
organism, gestures, tonalities, and the systemics and poetics of wryting. 
Thus writing is always already writhing, and its kernel is encoding, 
protocols, hermeneutics. There is no coding without temporal coding, no 
wryting without immersion, no wryting in time, no time for wryting. All 
wryting entangles with poetics, poesis, autopoesis, impulse and drive; all 
wryting accounts-for, is accountable, is unaccountable. Death and untoward 
pain are wryting's dissolution; healing coagulates wryting in similar 
formations. Death is the cessation of wryting formations, and the promul- 
gating of skeins of new wryting formations. Always inscription, always 
wryting, wryting wrytes and is wrytten; what is, is meaning; wryting is 
never meaningless; the presence of a sign is already an accountancy. Now 
loss inhabits the symbol; inhabits wryting; wryting inhabits meaning. How 
may one wryte wryting? One may not; wryting wrytes elsewhere; wryting 
wrytes otherwise; wryting never just wrytes. Wryting is the wrything of 
the hermeneutic; wryting is imminent and immanent; wryting is there is; a 
wryting. It is thereby tethered _concretely_ to protolanguage, body parts, 
and the fetish, it is a _function_ and not an ideality. There's a certain 
inertness, sturdiness to the symbol. Thus truth as function of wryting 
also shines with the wryting of sheep, goats, grain, rice, papyrus, 
jewels, the wryting of natural kinds, epistemologies, ontologies; wryting 
is split, shunted into decentered lamina, the _said_ of it. "defuge," 
"ascii unconscious," "emission," "wryting": These are coherent and lack 
across domains; the limb is beyond wryting, objet a, already tossed and 
lost. Everything and nothing escapes a wryting without conclusion, culled 
and tossed and lossed. Death is the diacritical of the text, theory-sub- 
stance, wryting, nothing. And I call _wryting_ and it occurs in the world.

A point about interactivity: Every writing, wryting, upon reading 
constructs both things and orgasm, a wryting into the body of the true 
world rewryting the image or text as internal or other phyla, other 
processes. We might use "wryting" to reference the effacement of the 
interface, production of wryting the body. And wryting the body is always 
the wryting _of_ the body and wryting _on_ the body; all texts are 
pornographic, broken texts of pornography, sutured texts of death.

Wryting relates to poesis, poetic-generation, since the words always run 
among dismemberment of body and sign, trace or hymen lost among spaces, 
body parts among totality. Wryting is a movement towards text/ure become 
autonomous and everyday, Merlin Donald's extensions of neural phenomena. 
It cuts through the body/textual body/body of the text and inscription. 
Wryting-space: because one takes the desire of the subject into account. 
Wryting is clotted inscription, that is, writing inextricably merged with 
spews through sexual fantasy, obsessive thinking, compulsion, again always 
inscription. (It wrytes otherwise and never just writes.) "And I call 
_wryting_ and it occurs in the world."

continuous generation of these snapshots

that perhaps some ontological discovery were at work
or better yet a new all-encompassing epistemology

nothing like this was the case, which is only
the flattening of models so they might appear
before you or beyond you as if those truths
were generating models, algorithms, amazing expansions

you might retreat into hallucinations or dream
to promulgate the notion of veracity or shamanism
here or in other similar instances
escaping truth values, look-up tables, idealities

the mathematics is only that of representation
and nothing fundamental, speaking cosmos or physics
just those representations of physics in mathematics
designed to mimic uncannily a statement of the real

physics, all the way down, the coherencies are atomic within the emanants 
of plasma, of the disarticulations of clear but complex relationships. 
what emerges from cosmology or particle physics: what is a particle 
physics phenomenology, by and large behind the scenes - quantum mechanics, 
computer science and taxonomy. exchange, like quantification, parameter-

emanants of plasma disarticulate the world transformed by example.

cull: but the joist of particle physics, muons as virtual dissolves in
