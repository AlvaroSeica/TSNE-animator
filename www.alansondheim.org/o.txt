Heidegger Takes His Time


"But prior to all calculation of time and independent of such calculation,
what is germane to the time-space of true time consists in the mutual
reaching out and opening up of future, past, and present.  Accordingly,
what we call dimension and dimensionality in a way easily misconstrued,
belongs to true time and to it alone. Dimensionality consists in a reach-
ing out that opens up, in which futural approaching brings about what has
been, what has been brings about futural approaching, and the reciprocal
relation of both brings about the opening up of openness. Thought in terms
of this threefold giving, true time proves to be three-dimensional. Dimen-
sion, we repeat, is there thought not only as the area of possible measu-
rement, but rather as reaching throughout, as giving and opening up. Only
the latter enables us to represent and delimit an area of measurement." 

The threefold, beginning, middle, and end, is built in to the Euclidean
measure polytope, the line/square/cube/hypercube/ etc., so that for any
dimension N, the polytope has 3^N elements, not unreasonably the binomial
coefficients as well. If dimension is potential through reaching, giving,
and opening (not unlike the reciprocity of the gift), then is it nonethe-
less the harboring of time? What seems a misrecognition on Heidegger's
part in the every day, seems true, however, in cyberspace, where spatia-
lity is defined _precisely_ by reach, by wryting, by an opening that is 
equivalent with transmission. Transmission = epistemology oddly associates 
cyberspace with plasma, the normative state of matter in the universe. 
What separates the two are data-bases, temporary repositories of informa- 
tion, and well-defined binary modes of communication.

Body Parts


"@describe Alan as gaunt, limbless, wryting texts" (PMC2-MOO construct, 
1995.)

"There is in the country a spittoon which belonged to Buddha, made of
stone, and in colour like his alms-bowl. There is also a tooth of Buddha,
for which the people have reared a tope, connected with which there are
more than a thousand monks and their disciplines, all students of the
hinayana." (Fa-Hien, A Record of Buddhist Kingdoms, A.D. 399-414.)

"However, what the matter of philosophy should be is presumed to be deci-
ded from the outset. The matter of philosophy as metaphysics is the Being
of beings, their presence in the form of substantiality and subjectivity."
(Heidegger, The End of Philosophy, 1964.)

"Let me be clear, then, that 'the feminine' represents more than an
arrangement of specific bodily parts. Linked to the female genitals that
invoked the dionysian realm of anti-organization, the metaphorical femin-
ine denotes a defiance of the reality principle, the other side of civil-
ization, a call to the outside of meaning." (Mary Caputi, Voluptuous
Yearnings, 1994.)

"Your limbs heavy and limp lay immobile like the body parts of another, of
anyone at all. You felt the rain of her hair pass over your face, then
falling in streams over your throat. You felt her warm breath over your
ribs." (Alphonso Lingis, Abuses, 1994.)

"Another person, with paranoid tendencies, upset by the sense of loss or
displacement of organs, accuses a surgeon of having removed his stomach,
or his heart, and of having put machinery in its place. He threatens,
seeking to restore justice by the mortal revenge he is contemplating." 
(Henri Michaux, The Major Ordeals of the Mind, 1966.)

"Meanwhile the woman closed all the chinks of the house. Then Xausgana
entered. Raven put on his skin and tried to escape, but Xausgana caught
him and killed him. He broke his bones to pieces and threw him into the
latrine. On the following day when his wife went to defecate Raven spit
upward at her genitalia. He took the body and struck it again, and he took
a large stone and pounded it to jelly. Then he threw it into the sea. It
drifted about on the water. One day many people went out in their canoe. 
When they saw the body they remarked: 'Why is that chief drifting about on
the water?' And the body replied, 'A woman is the cause of this.'"  (Raven
Traveling, John Swanton, Haida Texts and Myths, Skidegate Dialect, 1905.)

God I couldn't believe it, I had this video class tonight and I went out
with three of the women in it afterwords and we went to the Greenwich
Village Halloween parade and there were queens just like those in Prisc-
illa Queen of the Desert, and we had this great conversation and the class
wants to keep meeting every couple of weeks after it ends and there were
some great videos we looked at and I have this crush on this woman who was
there and she was an extra on Saturday Night Live and makes these amazing-
ly intense video tapes and I had a nice glass of red wine at the White-
horse Tavern after walking the length of Christopher Street and I kept
thinking every .45 block, what the fuck with cyberspace? Why all this pain
and blockage 

when the night was drizzly and for the first time in weeks I felt actually
happy and that things were momentarily the way I always thought they
should be, at least every once in a while and for once I'll dream happy 
tonight and I thought think

the hell with Spoons the hell with theory when it wraps itself around pain
and politics and squeezes the hell out of life and that got me going so I
could come home, capitalize "I" even, and write a post about intuitionism
and natural numbers to Future Culture, staying with the subject, not the
wryting dripping from the glass-glass screen -

o wish this baby luck

Truth


Truth is always mistaken as an exact concept, based on the principles of
mathematical logic, truth tables, the results of Wittgenstein and Beth. 
But there is no a priori reason to presuppose the exactitude of truth, its
foreclosing upon the case, even in the case of tautology A = A, which in
fact may be rendered problematic in the physical realm, due to Heisenberg-
ian principles, Bell's work, and so forth.

I would like to proffer that _truth is always already poetic truth,_ that
it is thereby tethered _concretely_ to wryting, protolanguage, body parts,
and the fetish, that it is a _function_ thereby of wryting and not ideal-
ism: that truth is its inscription. On one hand, there is no satisfactory
_formal_ definition of truth, and on the other, there is a poetics of
truth upon which the body is distended as a transparent membrane. Truth 
is always the harbinger of a politics of bodies; even A = A possesses a 
certain inertness, sturdiness. Thus truth as function of wryting is also 
a function of _intersubjectivity._ Even in an "obvious" situation such as 
"it is true that 2+2 =4," the truth of the statement is based upon a de- 
gree of consensus: the axioms of ordinary arithmetic in the small, con- 
ventions of language and symbol, dialog, and so forth. Like negation, 
truth is a _potential-in-the-world,_ a supervention or operation upon it, 
even in the case of mathematical reality.

Such a potential brings mind, albeit abstract, into play - and even if 
certain truths are universal (the properties of natural kinds under equi- 
valent conditions for example, in all possible worlds), they are still 
processes of semiosis. Thus it may be that, through the mathematization 
and even technology of truth, that the body may be recuperated; it may be 
the machine which is producing the body, not the body extruding the cy- 
borg. In fact, I would argue that we are drawn forth by the machine which 
wrytes the body, that the body is always already wrytten, encoded _all 
the way down_ - but I would also argue that the body is not _machinic,_ 
offering a critical resistance to its truth.

Thus poetry also wars on truth which is its dominion; it resists by the 
productions of negation and the lie, and there is more than a _certain_ 
truth in both.

Parmenides

It arrives unannounced at the beginning of the twentieth century:
It arrives unprecedented at the ending of the nineteenth century:

the symbol of the car crash hurries to establish itself in its intensity
nothing before 1922 squealed with the sound of shattered brakes
bodies fell against gashes of 1895 steam: Concordia: Silence!
every wire didn't glue to any other: in 1914 steam tiny copper ends
searched for tongues attached to mouths! a program waited for its radio!
Stagefright!

Just so ectoplasms, dioramas, melodramas, daguerrotypes, table-knockings,
produced those flags of which our sight was so grateful: Visual semaphore! 
Things occurred between signals, voices were conjured and recorded through
the British Census of Hallucinations. Houdini, my brother! Arthur Conan
Doyle and the faerie folk! German dwarf-sightings all the way back! She 
was tied down, clitorectomy to remove the impulses of masturbation; he 
was only whipped! Their little bodies carried us across St. Elmo's Fires! 
To this day, the smell of burning flesh around the corner, the Dodge and 
the Chevrolet: I saw three people die that way. When I was very young, 
the beautiful blond woman hugged me in the air!

_They are where none are._

Heraclitus.

Abacus


Among them I click five, click one; among them I click ten.

Hollow, I echo five, one, ten; hollow, I am in demand, this one or that one.

I carry the incisions of the earth tethered to the socius.

The earth is the lower portion, the heaven the upper. I click myself upon 
the matrix. I participate in syzygy. Click, I tally among them.

I tally among them because I tally among the nodes. The nodes configure
1/1/1/1/5 or 1/1/1/1/1/5/5, one or another system, binary and above. 
Among them, I click now and then, here and there. I shuffle the double
position.

The double position maps binary onto bases. The double position wrytes 
heaven and earth, portends a click against the upper or lower framework. 
The lower click is a release, withdrawal, decathexis; the upper places me 
in accountancy. The configuration is always all that is accounted for.

My biography is the totality of positions, [o-] to [-o]. Sometimes a 
group of us move, [-oo] to [oo-], and in fact our community as a whole is 
limited to 8 or 10, as we say, on the line. The line is at work, clicking 
tens, hundreds, thousands, clicking ones, tenths, hundredths. The line 
holds; we hold the line.

We wear ourselves out against the dust; the grooves deepen, the rock
shines with the wryting of sheep, goats, grain, rice, papyrus, jewels,
transistors. Against bamboo we make a stuttering sound as we speak the
syzygies of mercantilism, the consensual tagging of species beyond what
the hands grasp. (We are blind to the broad faces like suns that surely
loom above us dreaming of lines extending the quiet fullness of distance.)

Each shift opens or closes a space, a time, an object. The earth vibrates 
sonorously with tallying, spending itself through exhaustion and death as 
its products disappear, replaced by the foam of the new. Mines compress, 
extrude substances wielded and shuttled themselves across longer lines;
the earth vibrates and vectors.

The most beautiful thing is the shift constructing the cathexis of a 
space, a time, an object, the gift of foreclosure. 

The sounds which will occur at always the same rough intervals.

Definition of 'Wryting'


This neologism is used in my recent work to refer first of all to an in-
scription which is necessarily performative, and constructs its own sheet
of assertion (Peirce's term). It acts by virtue of its existence. Wryting
is cross-ontological, cross-platform; it implies multiple communicative
domains. As in some current theories of metaphor, it implies the body, and
becomes related to suspect poesis, semiosis, and fetishization. It is used
to describe the text/ure of cyberspace, especially in regard to issues of
hysteric embodiment, which I have described elsewhere (reading through the
text to the alterity of the other, a circum-reading which takes direct
description into account as only one of a number of portents). 

Wryting relates to poesis, poetic-generation, since the words always run
full in excess of themselves, referencing incantation. It relates to semi-
osis, since it inputs into extensions of semiotic domains which are
brought to a (previously) non-existent and inflationary space. It relates
to fetishization, since it an inhabiting which becomes empathetic/magical,
moving towards foreclosure, completion. And all of this is suspect, purely
in the realm of text/ure in a space which cultivates, prohibits, and car- 
esses no /other.

Wryting is the dismemberment of body and sign as well, the pure trace or 
hymen lost among spaces, body parts among a totality. Wryting is proto- 
language, feminin ecriture, the writing of the body, embodiment; Nicole 
Brossard and others configured wryting, as do those texts beginning with 
the W/w/ord. Wryting itself is the obdurate of the ascii unconscious, 
which also connects to verbally-transformed hypnotic states, identifiable 
eidetic imagery. It is procured from the imaginary, the chora; it is not 
_of_ the imaginary, nor symbolic. 

Wryting is a movement towards text/ure becoming autonomous and everyday,
Merlin Donald's extensions of neural phenomena. Wryting is therefore al-
ways in the process of becoming, a production among fuzzy and indistinct
polarities. Wryting cuts through the body/textual body/body of the text; 
it produces _wrything,_ which is frisson/jouissance simultaneously of the 
cut, body, text. Wrything tends towards argument, aggression, pathos, 
empathy, flaming, desire, net sex - the psychoanalytics and submergence, 
fluidics of the keyboard itself. The screen already wrythes.

So wryting is a term configured for _this_ space, extending backwards 
through the history of grammatology/inscription/graphemics, describing 
texts and their productions within/without cybermind. Irigaray, Derrida, 
Lakoff, Bickerton, Brossard, Eco, Barthes, Chasseguet-Smirgel, Lingis, 
and others come into play here; mathematically, wryting encompasses the 
abacus and phenomenologies of enumeration. In CMC, wryting is involved 
both in the performative of programs, and the performative of _any_ CMC 
inscriptions (i.e. as if in unix chmod -x is always implied). Wryting is 
the act of building, speaking, page, legislating on a MOO/MUD, but it is 
also the act of saying on IRC, of telnetting, of composing on-line. Wry- 
ting is its own sheet of assertion, information 'all the way down.' And 
finally, wryting is any and all of this, intensifications, territories 
always construed on the edge of cyberspace, co-extensive with that edge, 
which constitutes cyberspace, within and without.

Wryting-space


"Starlight asked Non-entity, saying, 'Master, do you exist? Or do you not
exist? He got no answer to his question, however, and looked stedfastly to
the appearance of the other, which was that of a deep void. All day long
he looked to it, but could see nothing; he listened for it, but could hear
nothing; he clutched at it, but got hold of nothing. Starlight then said,
'Perfect! Who can attain to this? I can (conceive the ideas of) existence
and non-existence, but I cannot (conceive the ideas of) non-existing non-
existence, and still there be a non-existing existence. How is it possible
to reach to this?'" (Chuang Tzu, Legge)

Request for Lovely and Ill-Gotten Fame


I don't want to be safe, I want to be famous. I want my texts distributed
across the Internet. And I don't care if I'm right and I don't care if I'm
wrong. I want my texts forwarded everywhere and to everyone; I want the
Net coated with effluvia from my fingers, my mind, my troubled thoughts,
neurotic intentions. I beg you to accommodate me in this: Forward my wri-
tings, my precious children, to everyone you have ever cared for, everyone
you have ever loved, just once, just this once, as a gift, as a form of
gratitude! I am frail, I will die! My skin will burst into a million pie-
ces, the length of an unread text, length of a forgotten utterance. But I
will come forward and not furious! But I will come forward, obdurate, out
of this or any other safe place, I will insinuate myself into your think-
ing. My writing will grow swollen with disseminated presence, with the
dissolution of site, with the participation of the nomad, taking it one
way or another, one or another node beyond you; already this reaches
beyond you, as you, catalyst extraordinary, hurry it along, tag-team,
relay-race, so that it takes me beyond myself as well carrying my signa-
ture sondheim@panix.com immersed in the core of all of it, the perturbed
soundings of the syllables of my name, Alan Eliot Sondheim, following
suit. Such a long sentence! Such a long long begging! A long long prayer! 

Thus because of frail frail life, this must move from screen to screen to
screen, and you may choose, any one of my texts is yours for the sending,
the asking, texts accessible through http://jefferson.village.virginia.
edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html - You will accommodate me if I beg you? You
will send for one or another file, pass it onto a friend, say someone you
like very much and want to please, give pleasure to, and you will think to
yourself, you will think, this is a lovely text and I will forward it to
my friend who will have much pleasure and will appreciate me, and my
taste, and my kindness in forwarding it, such a lovely thought without
recompense. 

And I am taking such a chance with you, I am no longer safe with you, I am
just making this simple request, so that I may be famous, so that my texts
will live a breath past my own, so that I may continue for a second a min-
ute a day, so I may stop this somewhat serious degradation of my ambitions
- this expostulation. And such a long long sentence! And such a short
short request!

Simplicity of Wood and Silk


Recently I was mini-flamed on PMC2 for saying that I actually programmed
in Pascal or Qbasic. As some of you may know, I have been working on and
off with what I call generalized measure geometries, which produce semi-
fractal, semi-chaotic patterns that suddenly shudder into symmetrical
forms - something like cellular automata, but not quite. Well, Qbasic and
Pascal are excellent for the task, as are any formats that can handle
things like primitive recursive functions - they all map the same classes,
whether or not the languages are elegant. So this sent me back to the aba-
cus again (approaching the void, simplicity, bamboo), which, as I pointed
out here, can be programmed as well to work with any number base less than
or equal to the numbers in any column plus one - the Japanese abacus then
can handle up to base 10, and the Chinese, all the way to base 16. Well,
it also seems that one-dimensional cellular automata of sorts can be prog-
rammed on the abacus, although not in a particularly elegant fashion. So
now I'm sitting working beads, Netscape for some reason inoperable this
evening, listening to the clicking as columns are added and subtracted, a
tiny music not unlike that I sometimes play on the ch'in, a Chinese medi-
tative instrument I have owned for years. (Like the abacus, it is divided
into heaven and earth, unlike the abacus, it is of the class of silk.) And
I think to myself, forget Netscape, Qbasic, C: We are always, always, al-
ways, moving towards the void (the ch'in is often played silently, some-
times untouched...) - we are always moving towards the void, unmoved, and
soon we will be ceaseless as well.

Extinguishing Extinction, The Violence of Living/Mechanism


The violence of living (in which our lives are viral):
The violence of being-alive (in which we are taken out once and for all):
Everywhere extinction is:

Given the genetic determination of life, given the principles of the sel-
fish gene, viral memetics, empty apocalypse: as in the principles of socio-
biology all the way down.

But this occurs in the midst of the production of top-heavy nearly but not
quite decomposable structures - free play everywhere, up and down. Lang-
uage, religious, other domains; these are foreclosed. Truths strike like
lightning within them; truths exist only within, veins on membrane
surfaces. 

Bounding and bracketing within and without. There are always the questions
of origin.

Why would the possible manifest itself?

(The preclusion of altruism is not the preclusion of altruistic content.)

Call the genetic imperative, mechanism: Either mechanism is not the entire
answer, or one proceeds from mechanism to nearly-decomposable realms which
then, in reversal, fall fallow. So that there is no truth in them except
the truth of the absolute vacated other. (Which may be defined as the
absence of teleology, life-force, God, concepts that, imminent, immanent,
recoil from the cleansed body which provides answers through their fore-
closing.)

(The preclusion of art is not the preclusion of aesthetic content, inde- 
terminate, stochastic, roughshod, symmetries and means notwithstanding.)

Or how does it manifest itself?

If it is a question of truth, it is a question of otherwise. It is not 
necessarily accountable. It is not necessarily accountable-to. It is not 
necessarily the case, then, that the case of genetic mechanism is all the 
case there is; the return no longer exists. It is this that is culturally 
productive, the lack of the return. 

(The preclusion of ethics is not the preclusion of ethical content.)

If explanation tends to fail within the realm of the cultural, or at least
fail in terms of mechanistic linkage, does it fail all the way down? Does
mechanism change course, deflect, as other forms of life are considered? 

Is mechanism itself viral?

(The preclusion of poesis is not the preclusion of the truth of poesis.)

If information or programming, how does foreclosing occur? Striations tend
to loop around themselves; dependencies are tethered at best, language en-
compasses description past the amusement of Godel. Wryting problematizes
the linkages. 

(Was Deleuze's line of flight a genetic disposition?)

(The preclusion of language is not the preclusion of the ontology of the 
wryting of natural kinds, nor the preclusion of the ontology of writing.)

Is the definitive blindness of the natural equivalent to the presumptive
blindness of speciation, cultures beyond the human? Is excess the result
only of chaotic dispositions? How does unsolvability work within the
picture? 

Is the picture which develops from the negative, then, foreclosed, only to
open on another truth which cannot be contained within it or any other
domain? Is this a form of releasement? 

(The preclusion of religious dominion is not the preclusion of spirit.)

These are not idle questions, asked in idleness. The question itself calls
forth nothing but a shuffling of what would be constituted grounds;  shuf-
fling dissolves entity. 

(The content is not the domain. The domain is not the content.)

Experimental Prosthesis of the Real


In 1975-77, I worked on a formalism that relates on one hand to the
abacus, and on the other, to neural networks; while the details aren't of
interest here, the phenomenology might be. The formalism consisted of
markers which were always conserved within structures, and channels which
designated marker flows; at every hypothetical clock tick (and synchronous
behavior might or might not be necessary), the markers moved according to
the channel vectors. The whole was describable by matrices. An additional
and critical element was the gate; if a marker was in the switch position,
the gate was open, and otherwise closed. An open gate facilitated a chan-
nel; gates, channels, and markers constituted structures which behaved as
neural networks, threshold logic devices, and the like. The threshold
devices were of particular interest, since they could possess variable
thresholds and connections, operating within continuously transforming
networks. 

Additional structure divided into strata and meta-constructs; these all-
owed the possibility of bound or unbound markers, and rules for creation
or annihilation of structures. There was mathesis, but not mathematics,
associated with these structures. The result, the formalism as a whole,
appeared very much like fragmentary logical structures, accumulations,
which could model in the small, associate and disassociate with each
other, and so forth - somewhere among Minsky's society of mind, neural
networks, and Petrie nets. A model of the life world and its interpreta-
tion was the overall result. 

At the bottom of which, of course, was the marker and the channel - on the
Net, the packet and channel. Unlike the packet, the marker was neutral,
although I later considered addressable markers, what it would mean for
one to carry a name, and the relationship among that name, language, and 
exteriority. 

What was the ontology here? Markers, gates, and channels were essential,
as was the possibility of clocking. Stratification permitted "vertical" 
operations such as binding, creation, placing units in and out of memory. 
As the formalism developed, it became more and more baroque, eventually
turning into a description of what was termed the "topology of intention," 
subjectivity positioned within the world. There were distinctions among
strata of language, thought, and the real, but there were analogs, conser-
vations, cutting across. Consider _conservation_ as a cultural foundation,
in the sense of reasonably stable data-banks, limited syntactical rules, 
physical objects which possess a relative degree of stasis. Consider 
anomaly, forgetting and meandering, wryting and poesis, catastrophe and 
chaotic physical behavior, as driving force. One is not so far off from 
the "slaving principle," unstable modes driving configurations, as 
described in Klaus Mainzer, Thinking in Complexity, The Complex Dynamics 
of Matter, Mind, and Mankind. 

Consider conservation as circumscription among a small finite group of
elements, and anomaly as the fissuring of circumscription. Wryting tends
towards anomaly of course, and it is through the dialectical interpenet-
ration of both that culture arises.

Thinking


I was thinking, but then I was thinking I was thinking. 
<Tiffany> It is enough that you were thinking. 
Honey: That it had been thought.
Mind rolls on the floor, laughing. There is a joke about a rabbi.
<Tiffany> That it would have been someone else in the midst of the sea.
Or that the sea had foam, forms across it. 
Pedicures, ripples.
[Honey is no longer listening.]
[Honey plays with the abacus.]
Alan is reaching the point where he can use the abacus in place of the
calculator. The beads take on identical configurations. It is but a 
moment from here
Alan says "to the construction of distributed one-dimensional artificial
life forms." Tiffany rolls on the floor, laughing.
There is a joke about a farmer's daughter.
Honey says "Why do you say one-dimensional artificial?"
HELO
sondheim@panix.com why do you say hello?
Bang bang, there's death in the distance.
Alan says "I opened up the camera, slid the TRI-X cartridge in, closed
it with a satisfying click."
Alan whirled off a few frames, cinema on the go; he thought she'd look
good in grain black and white. He remembered seeing her loose in the 
door. Her name was Jocelyn. She was from Montreal.
There is a joke about a madcap singer from Berlin.
He waited forever for her. The two women struck up a friendship. It 
wasn't that she was in an asylum as much as an institution; he was 
impressed by the business of it all. 
Alan thought she knew science.
Alan says "I knew you understood the basic calculations. I gave you my
depression like a mineral."
Dirty and smeared with blood, he wandered naked in the landscape of 
lepidodendron, sigillaria, stigmaria, calamites. Subluminary buzzing,
the result of melatonin, was audible everywhere, continuous among the
neuropteris.
I was thinking of Tiffany among the neuropteris. Recently we felt close,
were to meet where? 
Alan rolls on the floor laughing. Alan doesn't know.
The joke continues, rolls on. The camera rolls on. Thinking rolls on.
The floor is pineboard, one of the few to survive the flood - hardwood
expanded, pushed out the walls of everywhere else. Like rain, the walls
fell. Thinking pushes out against the brainstem.
Honey says, "Well, Alan knows about the business of it all. It comes in
cycles, following the Rossler attractor, an endogenous nonlinear system.
But everything here is endogenous - it's the definition of all of us,
Alan thinks."
Alan .oO (incorrectly)
The genal spine of the trilobite, either for burrowing, barbing against
enemies, or a swimming foil. Tiffany had no idea; she would ask about it
later. 
Being crazy is being a bureaucrat, regulations among the fields. In this
world everyone loves science.
There is a joke about a class of animals at a popular laundery-spot.
The violent burst of gunfire decimated the harvesters. Burning iron falls
from the sky. Lava rises from the pool. Everyone's eyes catch on fire,
red-orange flames invisible to everyone else. Everyone's screen is orange
and everyone thinks the same color. The color is all of everyone thinking.
<Tiffany> Thinking is what is going on here. We are all thinking, the 
process of thinking. We are coming-together, thinking together. We are
thinking the same thoughts.
The orange-red, red-orange has started to disappear. No one thinks the
disappearance of absent color, that which as been annihilated as to root
and stem, a totality by virtue of invisibility; here negation is no 
longer potential, but the collapse of worlds rendered
Honey is no longer listening. Jocelyn...
Suddenly, I am harassed by some difficult equation. Closing my eyes,
several beads of the abacus seem to move by themselves. But the equation
is nonlinear, and the beads shuttle off, fractioned, to the right. 
Eigenvalues disperse, the continuum shudders to a halt.
<Honey> The continuum is thinking here between everything. The continuum
is thinking among us.
Honey is thinking about Jocelyn. Honey and Jocelyn kill Alan. Honey and
Jocelyn are eastern european and french and they have an understanding.
They live together like adults. Someday soon they adopt Tiffany who no
longer looks for her real parents after the war. Abandoned churches sur-
round them. The cathedral of Durham is hard and harsh; the Brothers Asam
remain dark in Munich, even among the rebuilding. Anglo-Saxon England is
peripheral to Tiffany's thinking, even when bending over in a light 
spring rain on a cloudy day, her fingers tracing the runes on a stone 
cross still upright after all these years.
Later, these will be known as the years of Tiffany, when she was coming
into her own. A sad sweetness, smile, accompanies the inner world. She
was Jocelyn.
Jocelyn thinks lingulella possesses a somewhat vertical groove within the
pedicle valve. Jocelyn from Montreal continues to think
Honey thinks Jocelyn and Tiffany are thinking.

whispers to me on the telephone; listen, you should hear how she writes
whisper whisper to me everywhere on the screen: if it is passed over by
silence, it does not exist: if it is spoken, it is brought forward, a

beautiful conversations throughout the day and night, sometime we are very
silent: what is consigned to silence is annihilated--listen! what do you
hear of this woman who is beside me, this woman who carries a gun? so much
is lost in the silence, so much isn't language, so much chokes the mouth,

Current Reading Cemented


"Let us continue: if we need a literary theory at all, it is a theory of 
playful discontinuity." (Ihab Hassan)
 [Rupture which relies on totality is hardly that; nothing fissures but
 words break, collapse, stuttering Egyptians:]
"Na, Na, Na, Na, is thy name, Na, Na, is thy true name." (Leyden Papyrus)
 [Incantation rightfully restores discontinuity to the perseverence of
 the world's materiality, language or no language:]
"The impossibility of re-evoking the foreclosed experience arises from 
the fact that the psychotic never really had access to the principle of 
symbolization: one signifier is put in the place of another which it is 
not." (Anike Lemaire)
 [Na Na Na! Who's symbolizing anything! Trip me up! Break everything!]
			{Part II}
"What would Goethe have said about a mathematical model of his beloved 
metamorphosis? In this context, pattern formation is understood as a 
complex process wherein identical cells become differentiated and give 
rise to a well-defined spatial structure." (Klaus Mainzer)
 [Discontinuities arise from totalities, delimitations of pressure,
 anomalies, rhythmic dissolutions.]
"Selfridge (1959) proposed a pandemonium theory of perception built on 
primitive constructs called _demons._ What's a demon? It's a rule, a
procedure, an agent in Minsky's sense, that responds at once when 
appropriately stimulated." (Stan Franklin)
 [Everything breaks down! Everything builds up! Totalities arise from
 discontinuities, arrhythmias.]
"My reasons for seeing the universe as meaningful lie in what I perceive 
as its built-in necessities." (Christian de Duve)
 [Compression/decompression agents are continuously activated. Need
 obviates totality, particulations, flows, granularity. Or rather these
 are needed after the fact, foreclosing on psychosis.]
"When Heaven puts forth its power of putting to death, the stars and 
constellations lie hidden in darkness. When Earth puts forth its power of 
putting to death, dragons and serpents appear on the dry ground. When Man 
puts forth his power of putting to death, Heaven and Earth resume their 
(proper course). When Heaven and Man exert their powers in concert, all 
transformations have their commencements determined." (the Yin fu King)
 [Or rather, psychosis.]

The sexual work we are engaged in.


I can't believe that any of us who are normal would do this kind of work.
Sexuality at the rim is composed of incidents that occurred very early in 
one's life, or a continuous battering or restructuring later on. We have 
only our bodies to offer. We have their uses. They come from elsewhere and 
impose themselves upon us. We stare at foreign landscapes branded with our 
names. We paint them, upon them, shed our skins for you; you take them, 
place them upon you. You wear our abnormalcy; you become the monsters we 
have always been. Soon there is no difference, and we can pass for anyone.

Subject: Future on the Net




Where are we at this point of time on the Net? This is surely a time for
Net histories to be collective - the machinery on the verge of decent
video; I downloaded readers for Vdolive and Streamworks tonight and ran
them successfully - on one, Finnish jazz, spoken word, and images; on the
other - corporate executives. The former also had continuous Ottawa live
feed on the audio only. Powwow is more advance; Iphone sounds good - all
of this stuttering across the Net of course, not to mention MIRC, Global
Chat, all the other competing forms. So this is the time for someone more
skilled than myself to take a snapshot of all of this, including Worlds
Away, all the MOOs, MUDs, Moose, Talkers, MUSH, all the machinery out
there, all the Newsgroups, the beginning of tidalwaves of spams - the huge
increase in gopher sites, email lists, Usenet up around 14,000 on Netcom
alone - a swollen maw of language, images, sounds, shrieks, programs, and
it's time that all this is recorded - someone running continuous download
or logging of pictures, texts, someone running videocameras or gathering
software as antique, someone capturing the deadspace of the MOOs. On PMC2
MOO there is a device called the Monopticon; everytime you blink in it, it
takes you to another site; type "exit" and you can end up there. But PMC2
like other spaces has a lot of older disregarded abandoned machinery; it's
more a house of ghosts, even with the surface life. Who or what is recor-
ding this? Where are the necessary parallels to oral history? We are about
to step into cyberspace, those crackling voices reminiscent of early rad-
io, broken tiny images reminiscent of early television (Felix the Cat was
the first transmission I believe) - soon we'll forget the origins, just as
television-now is a land of forgotten histories, as we uselessly devour
the new. We are about to step into cyberspace, and someone, somewhere,
must record the footprints, abandoned, our always already forgotten
selves.

Turning Point


At this point, there are more and more incursions into the textuality of
the Net - the Web, audio, video, control-command factors. Communication is
elaborated among software enterprises, each of whom, like Powwow, gathers
a group of dedicated users around them. Communities like ecosystems, grow 
just about anywhere.

As an early user on these systems, like Global Chat, I find myself at a
loss for words - and on the audio systems, find myself sometimes speech-
less, reduced to the usual platitudes of ham radio. I've written of this
before. But these experiences of audio, video, alternative talking for-
mats, are becoming more and more common -

And to this extent, we are, all of us, becoming more and more consumers, 
placed in a passive position in relation to others' programming frame- 
works, some of which, now, are including advertising borders. So the 
question is: What is the Net delivering, at this point? And the answer, 
as indicated elsewhere, is that the Net is delivering _us,_ that we are 
engaged in what Smythe calls _audience labor,_ which ties into issues of 
consumption and capital almost immediately. 

The World Wide Web is an example of this, almost a caricature - because,
here, _in order to see an advertisement, one must labor at it_ - one must
connect, wait impatiently while the graphics appear... This is the world
of Baudrillard, the world of the seduction, the lure, deferred expecta- 
tions, deference which is _not_ differance, but which is at the heart of 
orgasm, placing to one side, the lurid attraction of the margins. (And so 
we wait, then _gaze_ at corporate pages, products, promotional materials 
not unlike MTV music videos which serve to sublimate the revolution or 
what might be left of it, into capital as well. Look what we settle for! 
A relatively bland ad will hold our attention if it has bright and quick 
graphics - in print, we wouldn't give it a second's thought. But once on 
the screen, we are spell-bound until we actively link elsewhere, enter 
another URL, do _something_ beyond turning the page. Our computer be- 
comes the ad in fact, our bodies our selves; we're turned on by it. Not 
necessarily _this_ ad or that one, but as the _condition_ of advertising 
here.)

The Web is not only packaged; it is packaging, packaged programming, just
as all language, all programming, all creativity, is packaged. Tzara's
Manifestos are hopelessly dated today - instead of breakage, they refer-
ence the early years of the century - one reads them for clues of closure
and not the splintering of bourgeois life no longer in existence (with
little thanks to dada by the way). But the packaging on the Web is tight-
er, more insidious, because it seems to proffer a freedom which turns, in
the Sartrean sense, towards the inauthentic.

In fact, one can go so far as to say (oddly in agreement with the Frank- 
furt school here) that the consumer is finally being refashioned in the 
guise of the avant-garde (Wired, hotwired rewired), that capital is 
beginning the final foreclosure upon the revolution. Or the final fore- 
closure, to be precise, within the technosphere, because elsewhere, 
things rupture, break apart, splinter, beyond even the conception of 
audience.

In fact, what are at stake here and elsewhere, are _bodies just beneath 
the surface,_ and it is for this reason that, within microterritories, 
email lists and other "primitive" communications protocols are critical, 
forming, like notes left by refugees, the possibility of a certain 
resistance.



[I want to add that, rightly or wrongly, it is ruminations and potentials
such as I am sketching here, that makes a certain Net history necessary,
not merely a luxury. Beyond the usual historiographic references, I would
say that this history, collecting, is critical because it is _obdurate,_
because it offers the potential of a past which is _always already_ inert: 
we need the debris. There is no purity in cyberspace; there is a fallen
purity that passes elsewise perhaps (and only perhaps), and this is beyond
us. There are crucial problems as well in any gathering/collecting, oral
historicizing, even of the present, but without the attempt, what then? 
For myself, I would love to see archives of early email for example - what
was discussed in 1972? And what would that tell us today?]

Loving Tonya


I have been thinking about Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, Oksana Baiul, 
particularly in light of a new book, Women on Ice, Feminist Essays on the 
Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle, edited by Cynthia Baughman. And 
in light of or critical reading of this book, which often presupposes a 
reading of artistry/athleticism/femininity at the deconstructive heart of 
things, I wonder instead if an alternative analysis could not be based on 
issues of lapse and control.

In this regard, Baiul constructs the body; dancers I know (muscular athle-
tic dancers from the Merce Cunningham company) admire her, not because of
femininity/grace, but because of total control over the body, every ges-
ture lending itself towards the other, no limb considered solely as weight
or counter-lever. To the extent that Baiul constructs the body, she total-
izes it, and it remains ironically external to codification and lapse; 
Baiul is simultaneously mirror-stage and mirror.

Kerrigan is all linkage, moving effortlessly from one leap to another, but
always in preparation for nodes, paralleling the World Wide Web. Like the
Web there is raw power involved, media apparatus, princess-construct, and
like the Web, money is an imminent symptom. Beyond the double image of
grace/princess and soured speech, there is a Kerrigan we can't recuperate,
the competitor, who is denied the "purity" of men's athletic discourse, 
and placed into impossible positions. 

And Tonya gets things done; like Unix, she evades the sum of her parts,
turning her camcorder back onto the cameramen and women who tracked her
down relentlessly. She problematizes truth, sexuality, the lurid, class -
like Andy Kaufman, and just as genuine, she problematizes television and
the publicity apparatus. Even now, her power is such that rumors abound as
to what she is currently doing, from singing gospel to topless Japanese
wrestling. I tend to believe in the truth of her movements, or her untruth
which as I've pointed out elsewhere in these texts, deconstructs other so-
called truths, those of linkages, lapses, and the body. Kerrigan, in fact,
is become the odd one out, following a wedding-dream with the rest of us 
in darkness. And why should we know anything about any of these women?

And why fault the feminine, the masculine, the American, the Ukrainian, 
the athletic, the artistic, as if these categories are not already late 
in the day, in the process of disappearing, or becoming politicized to 
the extent that bodies are everywhere disappearing? It is on this level, 
that of the fault, that we should be most grateful to Harding, who has 
brought the body back into play, from the knees of Kerrigan to her own 
difficulties with her shoes, to tears, resistance, rebellion, nudity, 
anger, intensity? I love Harding for this, the very real recuperation of 
body in one or another form of cyberspace - not the body of Baiul which 
lends itself, not only to control, but also to (Russian balletic) tradi- 
tion - but the body of waking, sleeping, eating, fucking, moving - not 
the body of the real, but as real a body as you're likely to get.

Sentenced to Place


I am typing this on my bed, leaning into the laptop, thinking about the
loving effects of gravity holding everything in place. Gravity holds the
computer against the white wool blanket, holds my naked body against the
same; there is a river of wool between us. Gravity holds the skate against
the ice, the mouse on the pad where the mouse was left, and the other 
mouse in the hole, fearful of the cat, relying on gravity to create a 
semblance of order in her world. The way to proceed is already deconstruc-
ted: representation of a real-world site or citation transfigured into the
textual realm (body, mind, intention, love, hate): in this case, bearing
with Shakespeare and the gravity of the situation. Therefore to consider:
gravity in cyberspace, the pull of the wires, thin shafts or beams of 
microwave transmissions across the bleak atmosphere, the bounce of fiber
optic light, beauty of the pulsing of the world. Gravity plays little
role; everything is held in place by direct addressing, surprisingly di-
rect addressing. Everything therefore follows, not the geodesic, but the
path of the matrix, discrete elements, markov chains, isolated instances,
what C.D. Broad called "sporadic cases" in his analyses of psychic phen-
omena. So there are grains, but no granularity as I repeatedly point out,
and there are matrices, but no tensor descriptions of states-of-affairs,
except perhaps within the electrodynamics of transmissions themselves. 
But not in the sense of the river of wool on the bed, not in the sense of
what we have learned, and then applied elsewhere, off-line to on-line:
that everything has its place, that place contains, that things remain in
containers unless removed (all of which resounds with the echo of MOO
programming), that in fact things _are_ places, and places _things,_ by
virtue of gravity's solicitude - and, once accepting this, then an eti-
quette emerges, gravity's protocols lending themselves to protocol suites,
the idea of such suites, to the bed of the Net itself, TCP/IP or other-
wise, not disparate, maternal as gravity's rainbow upon the woolen mam-
moth of the bed/rock, but unified codicies, presences tending towards the
communication whistled or whispered, _said,_ among the beings harbored by
the lap of the earth, earth's quiet shout and recompense, each and every
to its own, the challenge thereby built in, built inwards, as evidenced
by rupture, still contained within the sweetness of the protocols, still
witnessing, evidenced, presenced for us as soil, as the beds of verbs and
nouns and gardens, as the beds upon which we open up to each other beyond
address, beyond the _moment_ of address, silence seeking tongues.

Subject: Learning Tonya


TONYA: True story badly told



UNCANNY: I have always felt an uncanny relationship with Tonya; like 
her, I tend to err, bluster my way through situations, fear down my 
back, knowing all along the violence of the world.

COINCIDENCE: Tonya was born in Queenstown, Tasmania, a grotty place
of about 3000. This is where A- and I fucked for the first time and
almost got killed in the process.

STORY: A- was my fourth wife; we are still technically married, separ-
ated for a decade. I went down to Hobart, Tasmania, to teach, after two
years at UCLA; the job was supposed to last for three years, but ended
after three months. A- and I fled Tassie at that point, living our 
first few days back in Los Angeles, underneath Kim Abeles' and George
Stone's table.

A- had bright red hair and lived with three people, one of whom has 
since died from AIDS. She dressed wild and I fell madly in love. She
moved in with me on Bath Street; she was a student, not mine, and I had
walked up to her roommates in the cafeteria asking to be saved - I 
couldn't take Tassie's conservatism.

PROPOSAL: I told Moira and her other roommates about my feeling for A- 
and there came a time when a vacation occurred and A- and I decided to 
to join in thunder, to Queenstown Tasmania, little knowing that it had
given birth to a then ten-year-old Tonya. Q-town had around 3000 people
and a gravel Australian Rules playing field (the game is played in 
shorts) because these people were ockers and proud of it, mate. So to
be sure we were warned by one and all not to go, the full eight hour 
trip into and through the mountains, because we'd be killed.

OUTSKIRTS: The outskirts were orange, from sulphur fumes, the mines. 
They mined arsenic among other things. The mines were gone. The land-
scape was out of Ballard, out of the wastelands of the moon. The moun-
tains, there were mountains, were unbelievably rugged. A- came down in a
black-purple wig and we wore ribbons, New Romantics veering into trash
punk, getting off the bus on the way down into the place.

STREETCORNER: Let off from the bus, we saw the hotel caddy-corner. We 
began to cross the street.

THE CROSSING: Approximately four meters out, we were seen by the first few
cars approaching the intersection. They pulled over and stopped. Other
cars followed suit. The light changed. No one moved. The town was a silent
town. 

SILENT AND FEARFUL: Silent and fearful we ran into the hotel, a victor-
ian affair, where we registered, ran upstairs, peered out the window, 
undressed, dressed, primal prime-time. We went for food. 

THE FOODING: At the restaurant, we sat in the back. Everyone stopped eat-
ing, sat silently, staring. A crowd lined up looking in through the win-
dow. The fooding continued.

DOWN THE STREET: We'd run down the street from place to place, scared
with beautiful energy. We'd tell people we were fashion people, fashion
photographing, but it was hard to explain to people who didn't know and 
didn't care but loved to point and stroke our hair. Did they want us.

TONYA: Where was ten-year-old Tonya? Where were you? Were you part of 
the group screaming at us at the playground? Had you already left? I bet
you were gone, there were relatives, there must have been Hardings? I
need your life, Tonya, this explains my love for you.

NIGHT: The night we went to a disco, everyone ran towards us screaming.
Screaming always already happened in Queenstown. We escaped.

NEXT DAY: We visited a house full of photographs and a mine train. We 
hid. We filmed some kids. They showed up in art later. 

NEXT NIGHT: We finally made it to a bar. A Belgian hairdresser picked us
up, took us to his place, made out of discarded television sets. He kept
buying us things and things, giving us everything. He would have given
us his life. But the next morning the attitude was more threatening. The
town was moving again, it had been moving for a day now, and it was
gathering strength. Didn't we have to leave.

BACK: Back, we had fucked, fallen in love or at least groped our way to
something. Queenstown had the rep for the most redneck place in Tassie,
all the way down. Employment was minimal. The isolation, in the middle of
mountains so steep some of them had negative curvature, was total.

REBACK: In one of the windows, all the clothes were gold lame. They looked
like an ice skater had left them. The glitter was tough in this place,
real in a landscape hallucinated from a Tonya Harding story. 

BOTH, ALL THREE: All three of us lost our innocence there. 

NOW: Bad stuff happened to A- back in the States. I curled into my work,
and women went through me and they didn't care. A- went back to Tassie
cause of everything and then went to the mainland where she is. Tonya went
on to become something of a truth I learned. As Ellroy pointed out again
and again, it's the truth of a wonder, and wonder is the only truth there
is.

Peering


Minor technical considerations contribute to the sensation of spatiality
in user interfaces. I want to point out first of all the apparent flat-
ness of almost all Web pages, in lieu of the fact that they are written
against white, grey, cream, etc. backgrounds, or wallpaper - the sensa-
tion is almost overwhelming. In relation to them, those pages that use
black backgrounds seem only, by virtue of default, to have change the
color of the paper itself. On the other hand, telnet helper applications
often use dark blue backgrounds, white lettering - or even more common,
black backgrounds, white letter; these backgrounds appear to come from
the depths of cyberspace, to be part and parcel of the mirror stage,
exuding text; at the same time, they participate in the chora, the text
alone, illuminated letters, riding the surface. _This_ is the sensation
that has led to the notion of lurking or peering, something emerging 
from the darkness, chiaroscuro outlines of your body, the presence of
seduction, the maternal beginning of the things of the world in relation
to the humans who envelop them. 

In the Unix shell, and whenever possible elsewhere, I work with dark
backgrounds; anger and sexuality, however, lend themselves towards black
upon red, both swollen with the presence of skin and membrane, membrane
stretched across the forgiving screen. Never, however, the queasy black
against white of traditional texts: what would be the point of such arti-
ficiality tending towards death and your absence?

An opening: What configuration do you read this in; what are the effects?

Opera Oppressions


"Is this philosophy of language nad of the limitations of science pessi-
mistic? It is not, because Lacan himself is pursuing his question for 
knowledge. But in his eyes it is without doubt pessimistic as regards us,
the adepts, pupils and mere vehicles of the Master's thought. We are for
him, during our brief lives, at least the clumsy links of history in
which the golden ears are threshed. And if a little bran becomes mingled
with the flour, that will not prevent a future genius from making bread
if he uses the sieve carefully." (From Anike Lemaire, Jacques Lacan)


"The real future, I think, manifests itself like a "thing," beyond the
abyss that separates it from the present, beyond the value judgements
of the present. For example, if a man from the fifteenth century could
return to life today, would he consider the present hell or paradise?
Whatever he thought, one thing is quite clear and that is that he would
no longer have the competency to judge. It's the present, not him, that
judges and decides."

"In order to understand the future, it is not enough simply to be living 
in the present. We must be clearly aware that there is real evil in the
very commonplace order of things we call everyday living.
  Perhaps there is no such thing as a cruel future. The future, properly
speaking, is already cruel by virtue of being the future. The responsi-
bility for this cruelty lies not on the side of the future, but on that 
of a present unable to accept the abyss that separates the two."

"The most frightening thing in this world is discovering the abnormal in 
that which is closest to us." (From Kobo Abe, Inter Ice Age 4)

  
Nothing will save us, neither you nor me nor her nor him, nor language. 
Time flies, it stops for no woman, such an imprisonment, man dies, no
depth, the cruelty of the future devouring us. Obdurate future and obdur-
ate past, blurred by the invisibility of a present _placenta_ which gnaws
and grows, tumor-like, dissolves and decays. We are shunted by the ines-
capability of language. 

Our bodies are sliced open, stretched throughout cyberspace; it has never
been any different. What the wires make manifest is the uncertainty of a
present measured close to, or slower, than any speed of light in any medi-
um. Within time there is no explanation.

Axiomatics are antiquated, heuristics. Platonism moves from the naivete 
of a table to the obdurate of imminent temporality. Evert Beth describes
mathematical platonism (the unsolvability hierarchies among other things) 
as requiring a "Supreme Intellect": I say, not at all, only the ordinary
fudged laws of the world. I say: Action does not require knowledge.

Ghosts: Are the proper signifier here. Cutting through the past into the
future, simply a less _substantiated_ form, as implied by our own fading
away, not even photographs or videotapes, much less e-list archives hold-
ing back, holding forth, speaking and speechless.. 

Or think of it this way: The present is always opera oppression. Or think
of it this way: The present is always already abject, neither present nor
absent, nor accountable, the tabulation of the body which effaces itself,
is effaced. Neither passive nor active. What we are trapped within: An
accumulation of mucous; it spreads, glues, adheres, coheres to things, it
is the _condition_ of spreading, our fascination with slime molds. It
always refuses to declare itself for or against, no semantic tableaux, no
truth tables, hardly distributivity.

Lacan? She could be anyone, one lends herself to another, there is always
this confusion, forestalling, foreclosing in the name of the other, the
matronymic, metonymic. I consider Ballard's crystal world to have already
occurred. This is the writing of a dead man, splintered from itself, a
continuous splintering, mucous dried into the semblance of sharpened spi-
cules at the edges. The pierced bodies of the saints already had their
Internet addresses; they only lacked the protocols.

Froth


heheheheh... what if we're only creating froth here, I mean not wryting/
writing at all, but those mnemonics spoken of my Nietzsche/Kittler (Dis-
course Networks), repetitions inscribed in the body/not the body, hope-
less inscirptions, I'd say, froth and spittle, the mnemonics of refuell-
ing, maintaining lists against inevitable decay. when the tribe begins to
acculturate, the first to go are the societies based on secret knowledge: 
no one to pass the stuff on to, the songs are forgotten, ownership becomes 
useless, no one cares any more. or then later is revived; in this space,
however, there's no possibility of revival - the archives are already spo-
ken and spoken-for by people long since departed; there's heheheheheh an
ill wind that blows through here, you can't discount it... froth and spi-
ttle, froth and spittle - the rest of us down below want to ensure our
lifelines through it, give it substance, feed its maw - no such luck - it
decays in the blink of an eye - why look how it's transmitted, packets and
all running around independently in the networks, some of them may never
make it. 

here's N/K: "Mnemonic inscription is, like mechanical inscription, always
invisible at the decisive moment. Its blindly chosen victims are 'virtual-
ly compelled to invent gods and genii at all the heights and depths, in 
short, something that roams even in scret, hidden places, sees even in the
dark, and will not easily let an interesting, painful spectacle pass un-
noticed.'" (Kittle op. cit., Nietzsche, Genealogy)

empathetic magic uses froth and spittle, combinations of things, fetishes, 
the earliest signs haven't escaped yet, they're askew, powdered outlines
on cave walls, hands, then footprints down below, they're just the way 
things are, the word creating the body, you can see it's all mixed up. in
any case, heheheh, laughing echos itself back as the rush to memorize be-
gins the work of collapse from divinatio through hieroglyph, ideogram, 
maybe the alphabet on the way to pure binary. then heheh, the binary, 
froth and spittle: the roar increases, balloon flies away with the symbo-
lic: what have we here? well we've got something to rub all over us, no?
froth and spittle, heh! that's what we've got!

The Structure of Reality


This text which I wrote in 1976 worked through the assumption that infor-
mation parallels can be achieved through threshold logics, and that such
logics can be read ultimately in terms of channels, gates, and markers -
not unlike the Net itself. Thresholds were _constructed_ units, not basic
building blocks; they could be reset and the threshold level could also be
altered. It was assumed that there was noise inherent in the system, which
would lead to new operations and circuitry. It was also assumed that a 
_container,_ like electrical circuits, was always in flux, just as a CRT 
screen needs continuous refreshment. It was also assumed that a degree of 
"jostling" occurred, and if a marker _could_ move, it would, one way or 
another. 

From the basic elements and the threshold units, more complex networks
were developed, and here the assumption of parallels came to the fore-
ground; if subjectivity, mathematical thinking, and the physical world
could all be considered domains of transformation and conservation, then 
one could construct parallels vis-a-vis artificial languages among them. 
This did not prioritize the languages, but only pointed to both the unity 
of the domains and their ontological differences.

It seems that the Net can also be described in terms of subjectivity,
mathematical thinking, and the physical world replaced by textuality
itself. Textuality would be the uppermost level of a layering determined
by well-defined protocols which behave as pure agents of transmission. 
Subjectivity refers among other things to psychoanalytical and reception
theory concerns. What we are ultimately concerned with is _what is brought
to the subject,_ the reader/writer, and what is given in return.

It was also assumed by the way that the logics and parallels were fuzzy 
to the extreme; that semantic tableaux and truth tables would fall apart 
or be useless; that gestural logics (non-distributive lattices in partic- 
ular) were present to an extreme within the subjective domain; that the 
entire scheme would result in a _topology of intention_ vis-a-vis the 
subject. At that point I also defined my interests, not in terms of pure 
theory (i.e. 'hard' theory), but in terms of the subject's _introjection_ 
of such theory; even here on the Net, my interests lie more in the inter- 
pretation of community here from within, rather than theorizing from 
without. This is one reason Jon Marshall's work is of great importance, I 
think, on Cybermind - because it is from within, not even participant- 
observation, but participation itself, more a situation, say, of Taussig 
or Lingis than of Malinowski.

How I'm not a Universal Listening-Post to the World-Wide_Web


I've developed tinnitus, a continuous ringing of the ears, the sound of a
high-pitched motor, in both. I have been to the doctor who said that my
hearing was normal and that I would have to live with this. I am living
with an engine, always present, not so loud as to block other sounds, but
a disturbance nonetheless. There are two interacting frequencies and long
drifting waves of amplitude, and the tinnitus seems insensitive to temp-
erature and humidity; the sound, like that produced by the drone in Indian
music, is always _there,_ which translates into _here,_ a kind of intimacy
that I have tried to relate as well to the background radiation of the un-
iverse, the originary Word creating and destroying. No such luck, nor is
it, no matter how much I want to believe, a sound truly electrical in na-
ture, reflecting my time spent on the wires, the net, square-waves demon-
strative of packets roaring down the wires somewhere near the speed of
light in vacuo. Instead of ringing the transendent, in fact, tinnitus only
imitates and configures it; instead of re-sounding with absolute and univ-
ersal truths, tinnitus reflects a malfunctioning physiology of the subject
refusing _all_ truths, including the problematic of its own being. Since
there is no discernible damage, the tinnitus will continue until either I,
or _it,_ whatever that happens to be, burns out; in the meantime I can 
pretend to a hampered and very minor god.

Useless Biography


My Compaq Aero 486/25 began registering a video rom i/o error #101; today
I called the company after running diagnostics which indicated a serious
fault in the rom itself, not the setup configuration. The system board has
to be replaced. On the AST Bravo 4/33 I get video errors in the AW5vga.drv
and qtrle.qtc files over and over again; the SVGA monitor connects at only
16 colors indicating the alpha.exe file for Alphaworld won't run, the AVI
PRO won't run, the Quicktime (QT) for Windows won't run, and Xing runs in
16 colors although Xingstream had some difficulties. I downloaded Netscape
20b3 on top of Netscape 1.1 which worked and finally could get Xingstream
to produce images; it was Finland, not me, that was down. On the Aero I
downloaded winsock.dll from AOL to test and it's true; with a Ewan telnet
client I also downloaded I could telnet to Panix. But the connect was too
slow and stuttered; I wrote Daniel at AOL who agreed; it had to do with
the configuration of the winsock. I also ran Netscape 1.1 through it to
see if it would work, and it ran immediately. I then transferred Anzio-
lite, another telnet client, from the AST and could run that also from AOL
- in short anything, but slow. Back on the AST I tried to contact someone,
anyone, on POWWOW, no luck; I used Globalchat to listen to some channels,
empty as usual. Now I'm back on PCPLUS which is still the best way to con-
nect to the Net, through the korn shell on Panix running fast and smooth.
I have been learning the listserv commands and writing in my spare time,
listening to Lauren Hutton at the moment. I think everyone should read the
current issue of Scanning the Future 21/C, issue 3/95, which has R.U. Sir-
ius on Mondo/Wired, Kathy Acker, the Visible Human Project, Andrew Ross,
Frank Tipler, and Mike Davis, as well as Mark Dery and SRL (Survival Rese-
arch Laboratories/Mark Pauline); this, my writing, and Balzac are keeping
me busy. Today I found the first issue of Miles Davis Sketches of Spain. 
I've got to get Alphaworld running but should probably give up. I'm going
to shoot some film.
