the word shudders from the body of the uniformed man, and some might say
it's a uniformed word, but i jennifer say no, it's a body word full of
spit and sweat and moisture from the lungs barked into the air;

it's tongue and langue and lung simultaneously, clothed in the body of 
the swell-dressed man in a uniform of black and red for anarchy and com-
munism or blue and black for skies and soils of the motherland;

it's languor and lunges and a tong altogether, dynasties of tongs and im-
plements just as the uniform is carapace not character / armor, but true
and real revelation in the blacks and whites of the fatherland;

and it's line and length and tinged altogether, tainted with scents and
odors of the true-real body supporting it above and atmospheric, against
blood-red plant-green, the khaki family desert fairy-tale untrue;

and that is the tail of the bodily word, i jennifer always do say.

magic (in the form of poetry slam)


a text, one of several thousand
hopeless, eh
sometimes i close my eyes and think ill never have to open them again
blindness can pervade every organ
thinking off lamps going out all over europe
my writing is my hell
disentangled from the matrix that produces it as if there were a nipple
were in the middle of this black bleak space
were there for example downing aircraft
were there driving out villagers by means of ravaging floods
deprivations cholera foodstuffs disappearing like the banks
droughts nuclear devastations reservoirs of viral technologies
it might be a single o cross of t dot on i or j
as if id be dead when you reached the end of this sentence
ill be dead when you reach the end of this sentence
fooled you
cant fool you for long can i
were there firestorms over forests and cities
firestorms across the plains radiations everywhere
third arm breaks out through my chest third eye closes for the last time
legs wilt it wont be long now my last prediction
brakes are on 
cars in reverse embankment looms
downhill looms in the middle very middle of the air very air
im holding on that o or cross of t dot on j or i
its down there fiery black of the screen death white of the screen
sucking sucked away lips bared teeth against one or another bitter letter
hopeless eh
should have dropped out years ago
letter clanks at the bottom of the page theres no bottom no sound
hallucinations setting in schizophrenias schizzing
jagged x across the chest eyes mouth ears
didnt fool you this time did i 
cant keep this up forever

tremulous connectivity, final internet


planetary populations suffused across polluted boundaries, net surviving
through blackhole loops run by thermal generation. there are the last
heaves of carbon life, nothing to replace it. earth transforms into re-
pository of final information, data-bank earth temporarily engulfed in the
remnants of organization. it will be that way for some time. I can feel it
in my bones, time's _quality_ assuaged into the inconceivable. time mur-
murs through me, veins suffused with planetary populations.

let that be a beginning while there is still the space to write, the time
to tell. 

the nothing to tell. buried in time's tel. the truancy and interpenetra-
tion of systems: ecological, war, economic, medical, immune, technologic-
al. I place my plattered texts in this space only to have it denied; never
mind. I place my texts _here_ let us say as asteroid hits earth, nova ex-
plodes, icecaps melt, zero vacuum spreads, another war. the lights are go-
ing on all over europe. (what is silent, _silenced_ in space is not within
the sound itself; plasma reverberations hear themselves in the midst of
transvaluation of all values, thonged, timed out.)

what would turn them off is idle time, remission, server disconnects,
timeouts all over the Net, sparkling hacked computers remaining for their
million hour hard-drives. energy wouldn't end, wither; it's a done/gone
deal.

there are no creatures to grapple with time, with serrated edges, with
strength against gravity, with silicon brainstorms. pinball circuitry
sends my texts with the proper deathdrive. soon all is still when all is
still. 

I don't call an address _millennarian._


________________________________________________________________________



Very very last time, I say


What I mean is we're all going to die and then the planet will have a huge
death but of course we won't be around to see it, nothing like that. It
will be amazing and suddenly things like painting and music won't be that
important; they've got no intrinsic value. But maybe the machines will
continue for a while longer and things like my beautiful texts will just
revolve among some dying nodes for a bit of time and then nothing. And
there won't be anything around either to mourn the passing or to say that
after all _x_ and _y_ were said in the midst of the silence of speaking. 

So if we assess and reassess, now's the time; now is all the time there
is, which is why I also say, Jennifer has all the time there is, because I
am Jennifer and this is quite, extremely, serious. 

We must seize meaning because there is no meaning beyond seizure, no
thought beyond contusion, no language unborn in useless violence. My sex
places me in the middle of things, of me; out of hollow, nothing comes. I
sing when I cum, do you?

So you see, this teetering world, these texts, these cultures, pollutions,
nocturnal and otherwise, it's all the same, pasted against the image of
the world. And that is all I've been saying, except that my panties are
wet from the ground, or the ground is wet from me, and my frock spreads
all around.

Oppositional Structures, The Voice


Between life and death, a horizon or certain cessation.
Death carries the trace of memory upon its body.
Non-life or clays merges into life.
Death in opposition to non-life is the perfection of all existence.
Nature, culture, and artifice form an uneasy continuum.
What culture lends to gender, sex borrows from nature.
Artifice crackles and inscribes, where nature fissures.
The narrow defiles of life and culture spew down among natural death.
The dissolution of memory is the transformation of inscription into
 fissure.
Energy is everywhere among the speakable.
Nothing is unspeakable.
Lost in discourse, the physical body reinscribes as virtual.
Between physical and virtual bodies, a horizon or certain symbolic.
Death ceases and seizes the body in a paroxysm of absolute rupture.
Death is always already the grand narrative, inert and obdurate.
Non-life is an invasive procedure.
The absolute disconnection of the symbolic reinscribes on the plane
 of eternity.
The bias of language, the body, the gender, the sex, the culture.
The bias of language, the absence, the real, inscription, the nature.
The bias of language, the fissure, the fissure at the end of the rope.

(I can't abide lists like these, says Jennifer. It's just like Alan. No-
thing ever gets done. It's sloppy. The aphoristic disguises what exegesis
reveals. But I'm lying. I love wild theory. I love lists like these, what
they do to me, thrill me up and down the spine. I love the guise or mas-
querade of the real, present in each and every case. Alan will never speak
of thrills. One of these days, I'll insert him in me, in a sentence. I'll
name my cunt for him. One of these days, and so much for oppositional
structures.)

N*-Gendering Discourse


Squeezing my Susans, I wrapped my Clara around Tiffany's slim Honey.  Tra-
vis, Alan closed, turned towards me, his Joan aroused, while she inserted
her Jennifer into his Susans. Oh Clara, his Tiffany cried, your Honey is
the most beautiful Travis I have seen! Alan moaned, spread his Joan almost
to the point of pain. Jennifer gasped, her Susans deep in her Clara, Tiff-
any, and Honey, her Travis erect. Her Alan heaved in deep passion as she
whimpered and cried, her Joan and Jennifer visible to the Susans, Clara,
and Tiffany. Honey opened her Travis wide, sucking Alan's Joan, her Jenni-
fer deep in his Susans. Clara screamed Tiffany!, Honey yelled Travis!,
Alan whimpered Joan!, Jennifer whispered, her Susans thrusting Clara, her
Tiffany in his Honey, her Travis on his Alan's Joan, her Jennifer, hey
that's me!

Michael Current, Difficulty


As you know, Michael Current and I co-founded Cybermind, and he died
shortly after. Now, more than two years later, there is a minor industry
created around his death. I reprinted his story in Being On Line, and Mia
Lipner created an audio piece based somewhat on his posts to Future Cul-
ture. She is interviewed about it (in part) in Women and Performance. Greg
Ritter has written about him, and Katie Argyle has described events around
his death in a recently published essay. I've talked about the same in va-
rious lectures. Being On Line is dedicated to him, as was the Cybermind96
conference to a certain extent. I'm certain there is more. 

I don't know exactly how to think about this, the expansion occasioned by
sudden death. And by "minor industry," I mean in the sense of culture, not
production, but even here it is as if the tragic requires discourse or
creates it. Cybermind is not haunted or framed by his death, nor is it one
of those seminal / founding moments disseminated all over cyberspace - or
is it? And is there in fact a haunting? In any case, something makes one
uneasy about any reiteration of memory, and these thoughts arise again and
again as new texts or works surface, my own included, culpable and dis-
eased in their inability to absorb, efface, exhaust.

Tell us about memory, death, suture, discourse, and the tragic here.

Jennifer Writes, not Wrytes, of Implication


What are the sites of contestation here? What nodes/intensifications or
circulations exist, say around the body itself, gender? For a videotape I
wrote, "When I fuck, I think: dust," referring to desertification and
postmodernism, the former as populations increase, and the latter, as dust
becomes a category of mathesis, close to chaotic percolations. Now, in
_this_ space, to impede the dissemination of difference and disconnect, to
construct a _contusion_ of the real. Invasive practices of institutions,
power, generation, recapitulating, inscribing the subject which/who is
produced within the very machination; it's the curlicue of representation
(secondary sexual characteristics, "beauty," race) that continues the work
of hegemonic struggle. But not necessarily to overcome with the quicksil-
ver of theoretics; the flesh of the Other is in the dust itself, and there
is _that_ difference between turbulent entities and objects which might be
otherwise assumed. If my work has not borrowed from the mythos of chora
and pre-symbolic, where would be its stuttering effacement as this space
is dragged down beneath etiquette, protocol, existence?

Circulations are not always already inscriptions, and what argument I re-
tain emphasizes fissuring, the division of same and same, breaking-down of
categorial scripture; this occurs even _here_ with elements of lag, eras-
ure, protocol, activated elements, image and sound files, video, the in-
terplay of proper names. And it is within this _here_ that hysteric embo-
diment occurs, as I have elsewhere indicated, a projective ikonic semiosis
rupturing the symbolic; I'd say _in spite of the eye,_ that no one has or
is the phallus, or that the appearance as such is a promulgation of a par-
ticular period, masquerading as the real.

Alan finds it difficult to get around what gets around, all necessary
strategies implicated in one or another literary strategy; I would argue
for Alan that he, as an example, is one such, some such. Which is not to
take away from social construction, but to proffer it would that sense of
discomfort and dis-ease resulting from a stressed body that might still,
for example, be cut in to by any random bayonet, laser, shock treatment,
above and beyond the call of duty. 

These are elements that necessarily impinge, fissure, and, discursive,
participatory in discourse, nevertheless remain imbued with silent immo-
bility.

He'd say it is always already too much to say anything.

Advertisement


Between or in the middle of the advertisement, among the enunciations of
product names, phrases such as the following, a-historical, totalizing,
enumerating, are found, doing their work upon the subject. In this realm,
all subjects are virtual. For a long time now, Jennifer and I have been
concerned about this aspect of _parole,_ invisible insertions, catch-
phrases, cliches gluing together the modern psyche; no wonder language
also revolts, inverts - the chora becomes anti-capital, almost already
another theoretical marketplace. While advertising is endlessly analyzed,
these phrases are not; their effect is a done deal. Jennifer and I be-
lieve that they have prepared us, years ago, for cyberspace and beyond;
they are the constitution of the invasion of capital into virtual embodi-
ment, and they procure the body itself within capital. We have written
elsewhere about capital as the production of the virtual; these are the
bones and tendons of the operation itself.

Testing the Real


Walking down the street, I count my footsteps until passed by a moving
vehicles; the number of steps indicates how long I'll live, and I really
believe this. Every trip outdoors is another line of fate. Walking down
the hall in my parents' house, where I spent a good ten years of my life,
I keep my eyes closed; I can feel my way into any space, familiarity
opening up haunted speech. On occasion, less and less, I play tetris,
pinball, and count numbers of logon attempts.

I remain a child, testing the real; it's almost sutured, almost complete.
I have paid my dues to some unknown ISP; there is work to be done, but
_this_ virtual space is almost sealed tight. What could pass as a meta-
phor of absurdity proves itself over and over again; as participant, I
make sure the game has rules, boundaries, etiquette, walls.

I have never stepped out of the game. Cyberspace is only a subset.

It's the testing that proves the point, the footstep counting. If every-
thing were perfect, the game would be implicit. Within it, what I have
discovered of course is of no consequence. (This might have been written
by Barry Malzberg.)

And so forth. (Defuge ends it.)

confession


i write myself into oblivion; sometimes i end up trembling, ill, forcing
these posts out, hoping they're more than psychosis, private meanderings,
_my_ sex or gender as opposed to yours, ours.

in the middle of the early sunday morning, late saturday, stress grips me
with iron claws; i cannot think properly, peering out into the vastness of
this empty space.

i think of the circulations that will continue after we are dead, after
this realm ceases functioning, after the wires rust, fiber optics tear at
the heart of coded desire, avatars, words.

my life is a violation fabric, torn in two, thinking itself through this
emptiness, desperate for it to come alive, just as i'd love a good fuck
_here,_ not across any more wires, cables, airwaves. not any more wires,
not any more, unhere.

in the midst of these dark nights what looms is one's own hideous pres-
ence, unmediated by conversation, other voices, other rooms; the maw that
drools, spits language, belongs to me, and me alone; there is none other,
there never was.

my own hateful audience, i can only repudiate, penetrate my texts, their
nakedness conveying nothing, rows of stillborn words spewed from my mouth,
cock, ass, organs gendered and ungendered; i wait here for your word, hate
its arrival, it's only word, signifying everything, ripped and fragile.

wait and wait for the knock on the door, the roof blown off, sky imploded,
crashed down on _this_ body with burning heat and violent sensation, skin
slammed across mountain and valleys, raw nerves yours for the taking;
steamed. 

there's no yours, there's no yours anymore, days are nights, nights are
days; like this alone; days are lies; there never was; whatever one makes
of it, whatever i say; i say nothing; speechless, lost in vacuum horror. 

abyss; tomorrow i'll abjure, repudiate, leave alone, deny, sublimate; this
death is done; depression's not the half of it; chemistry not the quarter;
i'll burn my hand off; some sort of pain; i'll burn my heart off.

i'll do nothing; nothing of the sort; you'll be there on-line; i'll make
myself suffocate on your words; i'll cum on your words; my body explodes; 
travels the wires; they're hard, hot, fray; splinter; i'm born into a
thousand pieces; you'll find me worldwide; i lie.

you'll find me worldwide; i lie; pathos of this emptied space; spewed;
australia, africa, where are you; asia you are my fond asia; orientalism
spikes aortas; i bleed for you argentina. 

stop writing and i'll die; hold it; these pliers never lose their grip; i
can sing; black night; wires cutting firmament; not as if you see again;
repetition's the use of language; no psychosis when i speak the world.

i'm afraid; i can't say anything original; words wound the screen; my
hands are there; in the middle of the early sunday morning, late saturday,
stress grips me with iron claws; i can't think properly, repeating in this
empty space.

Jennifer:

I destroyed the poem. Open Jennifer Alan open open open. It was bad. The
spaces were ok. They didn't fill well. What the lines said. The between,
legs or lines. I want to put everything into me. Limbs. To ride the world. 
Stuff falls out. Rivers down my legs, stuff. Valley mud. My cunt smells of
world. I'm not Phaedra. I'd scream that. Not to be that. 

Nights are hardest. Screams from ankles knees. I walk down streets spread
myself naked, labia into perfect circle. No light. Murmur, cup your ear.
Alan, cup your ear. Pour into you. Screams from legs, asshole. Your mouth
open. Open open Jennifer Alan. Open up.

I destroyed the poem. Atoms burn. Charred flesh in me. I rage in me. Tear
my skin apart. Breasts jut. Jennifer Alan. Skin stepped from skin. A
single foot. Ripped open. Splayed. Nights are hardest. My cunt fucks dead
worlds. In Jennifer's time. Alan Alan. See Jennifer sit. Jennifer Alan.
See Jennifer; run.

I'm wearing your panties at the moment. 
I have a big letter A carved into my chest.
I've got the Slits playing again and again on the record-player.
There's an all-night bar playing darts and tunes.

I've got the hots at the moment.
Whirl around with darts against the walls and panties, chests.
I've got the record-player strapped to my back.
There's a crowd where the panties should be and be and be.

This moment cotton of beautiful cotton tatters lasts.
The bar clock strikes the Slits with a letter A.
Records whirl like darts in your panties and your hots.
The letter A strikes back with walls and chests.

Furniture skips a note and disappears
When I'm wearing your panties in A carved on my chest.

741


This afternoon I went next door to see Mark, an artist who also works for
other artists. He was building an electronic circuit that would respond to
audio signals, setting a mechanical mouth into motion. The mouth was dri-
ven by solenoids. Mark was using op amps.

The amp he was using was the old 741, which apparently are still consid-
ered rugged, inexpensive, and enormously flexible, after at least 27
years. I circuited myself with them in the late 60's, building an analog
synthesizer with Greg Johnson. I was amazed then, and still am, over the
beauty of these ICs; feedback/feedforward devices, they can control just
about anything, and are in fact at the heart of voltage-responsive de-
vices. They can be considered analog gates of a sort, a T-structure with
which a _parasite_ or parasitic voltage modifies a reception/transmission
channel; the modification can be tightly controlled, feeding back onto
itself. (See Serres, The Parasite, for some philosophy/theory here.) 

While computers go out of date before they leave the showroom, the 741s
and their relatives continue working in all sorts of places. This fasc-
inates me; on one hand, the fast and out of control feed-forward aspects
of the electronic industry - and, on the other, the strange attractors of
small perfect devices, as operative as neurons, that remain amazingly
constant for decades.

If you've never played with an op amp, you're missing cybernetics in ac-
tion as well as the beauty of process aesthetics... (You can find texts on
these devices in just about any electronics store.)

Here's how the net works. You get attracted to someone. You write back and
forth. You start to have net sex. The net sex gets heavier. You're dying
to know what the other person looks like. You send photos. Now you've got
the image imprinted. You want more. You want the body. At night, sweats
and fevers. Now you've got dis-eased, violation fabric. You write: this
is, this is not. You write and write. You have net sex. The net sex gets
heavier. You explore. You want his holes her holes his extensions her ex-
tensions. You write everything opened. You push and push at the writing. 
You pull at the writing. The writing doesn't give. There are no anymore
images, not these twists. The twists tie a noose around your neck. You
write back again. You push at it. You push so hard you're through her,
through him, on the other side. You're "on the other side." You realize
everything is quotation, parenthetical. Your sweats increase. You want the
body. He or she wants the body. In lieu of the body. In lieu, you take
things to the limit. He or she takes things to the limit. You have never
been there. There is no limit. You're "on the other side." Frantic tele-
phone calls, dilations, screams. You're in a dark tunnel and you dream
you're in a dark tunnel. You agree to meet. You set a time, date, place. 
It's a motel, hotel. It's in somewhere city. You agree: this is the room. 

You go to the room, he or she is there. You have furious sex. You find
your body following you. You've written your body so many times on screen.
You've written the footnotes and the headers. You've written the page num-
bers and colophons. Font after font. You've filed them away.

You do what you write. It's language all the way down into his or her bo-
dy. It's language all the way up and down. You find yourself doing things
you have never done before. You find yourself inverted, perverted. You are
used and use. The couplings are hysteric, furious. The quotation disap-
pears, the parentheses. For a second you see something. For a second you
really see. It disappears, your seeing, what you've seen. You go home.

You both leave the city. You go to one place and he or she goes to another
place. There is a taut line between you. One call. You have arrived safe-
ly, he or she has arrived safely. You get on line. He or she gets on line.
You communicate. You take up where you left off.

You take up. You continue to penetrate his or her body. You wrap the body
up, write and rewrite. It's all mixed, text and scent. It's mixed, weight
and paragraph. You develop psychosis. He or she is or is not text or is or
is not he or she or is or is not body. You telephone or he or she tele-
phones. Just to make sure. You make certain. You continue. You write and
penetrate. He or she writes and penetrates. You devour each other on line.
There is no perversion too strong. Anything to make it real. Anything to
make it come, recuperate, absolve, return, cathect. You write cannibalism.
He or she writes necrophilia. You write shredding. He or she tears. You
exhaust one another in blood, feces, urine, membranes, tissues, lymph,
bile. You reach a limit he or she calls uncanny. You agree to meet again.

You agree to meet again and there are again all these words. The words
meet each other and bodies follow. Your body is written on his or her bo-
dy. His or her body is written on your own. It is no longer your own. It
belongs to him or her. 

You do not know who you are. Your body is torn from limb to limb. You want
to make the body real. You want to write it into space. You write the
tearing and then find it is torn. You live and shatter in two worlds. 
There may be more than two or less than two or any other number. You are
other and yourself. How could you love and hate. You will have to ask him
or her next time you are on line. Next time you can arrange a meeting may-
be. Next time you can pick a hotel or motel in his or her or your city or
any other city. Next time you can meet and sort it all out. You will be of
frantic and ferocious sex.

I get notes. What's wrong, Jennifer's gone violent. Other notes, why at-
tack John Cage. John's got his problems. He terrifies me. I can't and
won't tell you how much he terrifies me. He comes out of terror. He
pronounces. What he says is beauty truth. There is no discussion with the
koan. Jennifer doesn't attack Cage.*

Jennifer doesn't attack Cage but would with her claws. She'd strike Cage
in the face, tear his cheeks to ribbons, retreat into her corner. The
corner's made of cement. There are brick ceilings fifty-five feet up. The
ceilings are vaulted. There is huge weight upon them. Jennifer has been
there, has seen them. There are two ramps to the left. There are enormous
circuit-breakers for the bridge. Jennifer could turn the lights off. Jen-
nifer could ruin the bridge. Jennifer could pull and pull with all her
might.

I get notes. What's wrong. Jennifer mouths through her nipples. Her body
speaks. She jumps on Cage and pummels him. She saves her energy. Cage
falls into brickdust, water, mud. She's on top. She's screaming.

Jennifer's voice carries for a fraction of a second fifty-five feet up to
the very top of the vaulted ceiling. Jennifer's voice carries for a frac-
tion of a second, crashing down.

Jennifer wants to stop hiding behind Jennifer. Alan is sick of the whole
thing; everything turns -J. He'd turn it off in turn, but an odd turn,
he's in love with her. It's Valentine's day and they hug and hug and hug,
turning over and over again. It is a relationship of pure delight and
mutual sharing and compassion. Alan feels that Jennifer is under his skin
and she feels that Alan is under hers. They refuse to listen to noise of
codependency; things could never be so perfect. Sometimes they cry out of
pure happiness. Alan wants to stop hiding behind Alan. Jennifer is sick of
the whole "Jennifer-Alan" thing but she is very much in love. Jennifer
loves the smell of Alan's panties and Alan loves the smell of Jennifer's.
Sometimes they play in puddles or just role around giggling. No one has
ever heard such happy giggling in Brooklyn loft before. No one has, bring-
ing a smile to Alan's and Jennifer's faces. People see them and are also
so happy. They say that Alan and Jennifer are just the very way for happi-
ness. Jennifer and Alan smile and laugh, they are so very much in love.

On the Verge


Jennifer says: To hold on to the man of my dreams I would do nothing. He
would either accept me for myself or he could disappear down a long thin
tube. People should come together because they want to be, not because
they need to be. When they come together out of need, they compromise and
that leads to resentment. It is like air. I know I want to breathe and
live to run around in my frock. I will not compromise and resent air,
moisture, delirium. That would be wrong.

I can tell you a story. Once there was a beautiful princess who was sound
asleep until a prince with a thorn came up to her bed and pricked her and
drew some blood. When she woke up, she would not marry him, because her
dream had been beautiful. She dreamed there was a beautiful princess who
was sound asleep until a prince arrived, pricking her with a thorn and
drawing blood. When she woke up, she would not marry him.

Life is like that circling and cycling, month by month, as a little more
of us can no longer reproduce, as progeny are wiped clean on sterile cloth
or towels. The man of my dreams will recognize my cycles and be responsive
to them, not out of need, but out of desire. 

Jennifer says: I can tell you a story. I slept poorly last night, tossing
and turning in my bed. When I woke up this morning, I disovered I had been
the victim of a violent storm - immobile, in the center of a tossing and
turning bed.

Life turns the world around, my breasts droop, my cunt will no longer
stream someday. But I remain constant, true to the language of a child. 
The man of my dreams will love this language, and cherish it forever, and
when we are together and alone, the two of us, it will be a common bond of
pure love of freedom.

Jennifer says: I can tell you a story. Once there was a princess who slept
very little, only several hours a night. Because she was a princess and
very sensitive, when she was eighteen and on the verge of womanhood, she
felt very tired. She slept for months and months, her new-found hours
spilling out across her supine body. Penetrated by time, she gave birth to
cold currents, warm winds, lazy funnels in sea or air.

I will walk in solitude to my machine and I will watch its glow, taking
Alan's shape, joining us together at the limbs. I will tell story after
story as the man of my dreams becomes the dreams of my man, and the woman
of his becomes his woman's dreams. Silence will flow like water and winds
and thorns, silence will flow like blood.

Is there a moment suspended from the bar when psychosis provides the edge,
when identity and masquerade become one, swelling the skin, pressing out
the awkward hinges of the body?

Psychosis invests, infests, Jennifer and myself, as if there were two in
place of one, as if identity loses itself in spoliation.

it's valentines day, a day for couples and threesomes
bubbles come out of jennifer's and alan's mouths
loops of saliva on their surfaces form canals

spilled cum on keyboards fingers chairs
silicon dreams in silicon valleys breasts
jennifer alan lie side by side undressed
puddles drying on shared skin and skinny brains

they're flat against the earth which pushes them
into one long shadow merged hysteric
back down against the ground where their ass cracks
open into tunnels tendrils lost in one long shadow

shared holes and noggins they've got nothing lost
but sanity says nursing sue just come upon 'em

Beginnings from Outside Beginnings


in this universe amazing left-hand turn
square tilings get thinner corners as jennifer ups the dimension
your penis passes through the poem

She began, but wanted to talk about psychosis, or rather, once again, that
passage of Chasseguet-Smirgel's: "The hypothesis I would put forward is
that there exists a primary desire to discover a universe without obstac-
les, without roughness or differences, entirely smooth, identified with a
mother's belly stripped of its contents, an interior to which one has free
access." And, her quoting of Melanie Klein, "the sadistic phantasies di-
rected against the inside of the (maternal) body constitute the first and
basic relation to the outside world and to reality. The child expects to
find within the mother a) the father's penis, b) excrement, and c) child-
ren"...

She began, but wanted to sleep that dreamless sleep of incorporation and
abjection, that sleep where universe and breast merge, where she is safe
and perfect, disorganized, open, a memory or a word losing meaning and
forgotten. Incorporeal, Jennifer floats within the Alan floating within
the Jennifer: Names and texts are applied, oh how to explain this to you.

Not psychosis after all, not the worlding of worlds, not all the time in
the world but perfect-time, holding-breath-time, snuggle-cuddling-time,
petal-open-time. Oh, that others would find us crazy! Murmur-mumble-time,
tiny-time, rolling-time, cradle-time, the time of the amazing-left-turn-
universe.

Maternal principles outside the nexus, constructed by literacy, nomen-
clature, division, differend. Within, the milky screen itself within the
milky screen itself. Outside: principles of fabrication, the Sheffer-
stroke A|B, not both A and B, and its dual AYB, the hidden V conjoint,
neither A nor B - signifiers of expulsion, building blocks of the propo-
sitional logic, _to be sure._ Inside, churnings, chain-negations, moving
along, percolations: where a beginning is no-beginning, no _timing,_ only
perfect-time. 

Here joined Jennifer Alan, here the non-inscribed (leave that to the prin-
ciples) epistemological/ontological turbulence of bodies, parts, mereolo-
gies. Here the pasting of names, names and texts applied but not _here_
but _there_ among the _principles._

The Principles are the Principles in the Theater of Desire. They wryte
themselves into every/thing, they are here-for-you, not within; they
think: _Within._ (It's _here_ that they hear of the snuggle-cuddle space
and time.) It's _here,_ as the Principles in the Docudrama of Inscription,
that they unravel Threads, motivations, intentions, the assignments of
neurosis and psychosis, the Draining. (I, Jennifer Alan, am one of them;
otherwise this screen, as should always be the case, would be blank, only
a hint, residue, or supplement of interior. But humans do not leave such
alone; given a space, there is scrawl, and given a sheet, there is scrib-
ble.) Jennifer thinks, an amazing left-hand-turn in a Universe of Desire.

Useless Routines


Learning pinball for Win95, the delicate timing of the ball release plun-
ger, for example: learning real-life pinball in Kingston, Pennsylvania
and Atlanta, Georgia: the quick movement of tensed fingers on a sopranino
saxophone: pressing into Margaret's back releasing tension _just there_:

Life and lives constructed from finesse, worked and reworked into worlds
opening beneath one's fingertips, through tonguing, arm-movement, the
shudder of palm against wood, skin against metal: worlds and worlds for-
gotten, lost forever, dim memories of movement embedded in flesh and its
urgency: negotiating complexity of glance, disgust, refusal:

Adapting to isolation of Tasmanian mini-bushwalk routing on hungered
nervous walk to university: rewriting the problematic of art and its
word ("art") as conceptualism moves into high gear: learning all those
California type-setting tray positions: air-gun loft-wall firing in
Montreal, Quebec: loving the complex topography of clitoris, labia,
openings, sites of pleasure with sound, and my scribbled flutters of
obeyance: 

Oh, it is time to say goodbye to these worlds, these tiny meanderings un-
folding into universal geographies, cosmic roadmaps, highways and biways
and sweet visitations: these perfections of care: these narratives of in-
habitation:

And oh: it is time to understand them, worlds without death, with skill,
with the beauty of comprehension, inscribed: emptied of everything: lost
with the loss of the body: the exact measure of throwing a discus, hard
rubber or wood tugged at the whirling arm: slimmed underwater torpedo-
body, breath held for the duration: sucking-penis dreams, my own curled
back into my eager lips and mouth: writing one or another runic alphabet
in numerous scripts, some self-created: understanding the deep taxonomy
of carboniferous flora as my hands tremble above another yet-unopened
stone: increasing speed of tetris:

Taping the Virtual Jennifer Taping the Virtual Alan


It would seem the easiest thing in the world, to construct a tape around
virtual subjectivity, but it's proving incredibly difficult. I talk to the
camera, my face and body on CuSeeMe. I spend time with Jennifer on CuSeeMe
and I recite extremely sexual/abject texts from the on-line screen. I wear
Jennifer's panties in closeup, and reproduce a section from an interview
with Amy Fisher on television. I talk about SYN attacks, my finger moving
over the diagrams in a book. I chat with myself as Jennifer on CuSeeMe,
but nothing _comes_ properly, nothing pushes the thing elsewhere, not even
videos and voiceovers of daughter, or myself pulling out my nipples, sing-
ing opera, nor a background an incessant beat that thrums its way with
vocals all the way through the forty minutes. A melange or stew, Tom Zum-
mer on temporary autonomous zones and Net communities, the workshop home
of Mark Esper, Maureen Wong asking about Net identity, myself rumbling up
and down the stairs in _this_ very building you could see if you looked
behind the screen. A few voices discoursing, myself included, reading Jen-
nifer's parts, all for naught; the images remain on the screen, first/
second/third generation, representations of representations, would there
be no end to them? Ugly colors and finishes to the thing, the camera wink-
ing on and off, the obdurate viewer attempting the impossible, the dis-
appearance of the world, the thin pastiness of virtuality: nothing works. 

Even theory takes a backseat as improvisation insists on Jennifer where
Jennifer clearly is _not._ The nuances of the text are lost in ex-postula-
tion, phenomenology behind the usual uneasiness of the body. The _surface_
is so insistently present, tumescent, that voice and sound falter; for
that matter surface is corrupted as well. What can be _said_ except that
the text doesn't matter all that much, that the voice gets itself quickly
lost in screen-writing, tentative gasps towards prescience, remaining in-
complete? Like the Mobius-strip/tease, there is no end to it, but one
might drill _through_ presence, through the intermediary of absence, to
the antipodes, coming across Jennifer or Alan, literally dependent. Such
isn't the nature of the screen nor dream, however; everything, including
the viewer, remains glassy and glassy-eyed.

So I bounce and trounce and flounce and Jennifer won't emerge. And I speak
and creak and squeak and Jennifer remains silent. And I slip and strip and
flip, and Jennifer remains out of sight, a name on the screen, never seen,
almost translucent, hardly transparent. Deeper voice gives everything away
- I try to bury it in the music, mumbling, continuous explanation. The big
empty wobbles on its pivot; I can't shake Jennifer loose, and hysteria re/
veils itself as symptom. I'd roll out of bed for her in the morning, I
honestly would.

in fact to say, "I'm Philostrata, dead a virgin at fourteen; let him who
loves me, cherish me forever."

Let him who cherishes Philostrata send a message to our children, that we
are our future; our children, our past - and that we have prayed to Orph-
eus, "She vanished like the wind." We're saying, "She vanished like the
wind," when we should say "Earth to earth," and "I, dust, am light upon
you..."

Well you can see what happened... look carefully at the framing of the
kill-file... I must have tunneled through a number of vaginal entrances
and exits... it's becoming clear... all these avatars between us... 
mediations... bots... simulacra... hardly a player among them... suddenly
in the last line... quantum-effects... more than a cameo appearance...

Writing the


With Jennifer, I attempt to _write the virtual,_ implying _writing virtual
wryting,_ discovering a certain poverty of theory or theoretical strategy,
along the way. For it is a commonplace that one _writes the body,_ _writes
the feminine,_ _the masculine,_ that one need no longer write per se, but
may writes the positioning of the writing (or its deconstruction and/or 
problematic) per se.

_Here_ as well as within the closure of the sememe, in spite of rigid des-
ignators/proper names/natural kinds, writing is always already virtual, a
state of affairs which binds wryting as well. So there are _lamina_ of
content and ostensible content at work, Jennifer lost in the interstices.

The failure of _every_ account I have read of virtuality, virtual subject-
ivity, is also the failure of representation to deconstruct itself, or to
deconstruct itself to the floor of nonsense, noise, udderance, chora/ab-
jection. This failure is also the strength of representation, which can't
resist its minimal doubling.

The results are discursive formations that attempt either anec/dotage or
circumscription, circumambulation, an entanglement of epistemological pro-
cesses. There are no other. 

There are no other because there are no boundaries, only borderlinings
which may or may not possess interiors. Borderlinings are porous, tentac-
led, dissolute; every application has been hacked, extended, reconstruc-
ted, operative as aural core. Virtual subjectivities (beyond subjects)
extend through names, attributes, sites, discursive formations, search-
engine listings, home-pages, links, citations, image/audio files; and
within the theoretical, _here,_ _writing the virtual_ dissolves, proble-
matizes, borderlines itself. The same is true for _any_ medium, which
automatically falters, just as _writing the masculine,_ say, is a falter-
ing or a positioning (even ideological) beyond a writing which might,
stereotypically, be taken as _masculine writing._ (And such a taking or
prejudice already prejudices the strategy, erects itself, collapses.)

So the writing _of_ Jennifer, to the extent it's claimed by Jennifer, Jen-
nifer's writing, may succeed as borderlining, but the _writing of Jenni-
fer,_ with its implicit _wryting,_ lends itself to a variety of styles,
approaches, elsewhere than the analytical, which then becomes a form of
talking-analysis or transference. And as for writing the virtual in gen-
eral, that tends towards the anecdote, CMC itself a tangled knot of narra-
tives, Jennifer said. (This is one reason that progress already foreclosed
in the beginning; on-liners tend towards compulsive repetition, email
lists cycle themselves, MOOs rise and collapse, avatars come and go...)

(I've written previously on the strategy of ", Jennifer said" which _pre-
cisely_ confuses categories, performative strategies, and actant; the in-
verse is the re/presentation of dialog as cohering, slipped through with
_meaningless_ or inconclusive subjects.)

Losers


For a lot of us, coming on-line is the sign of defeat, that real-life,
physical-life, material-life, pratico-material-life, has failed us; we
translate that into our own failure, immobility, handicap. So for many 
of us, on-line is already a tragedy foregrounded as community, good
friends, neighborhood bar - but a tragedy in which fate remains behind
whatever scene we choose to construct. 

There is always a bifurcation, decision to be made: turning on the com-
puter, signing in, entering a password into pathos. This is the inherent
sadness of this space, for those of us not here purely for research or
recreation. Every moment huddled over the keyboard is another moment in
shadow, out of sunlight, comradeship, loving partnership, engagement to
the fullest in the social.

Thus many of us are shadowed here by those who have denied us, turned us
down, rejected us, for often very good reasons. And in the gloom, many of
us spy beautiful and healthy bodies and minds, just beyond our reach, or
perhaps in the far distance - in any case, turning us inward once again,
towards our distorted mirrors.

Shell Interface

The shell has a number of advantages over the graphic user interfaces, in
spite of the fact that the latter support sound/images:

1 Almost always faster than ppp or slip connections
2 Many more options for every application
3 A HUGE number of commands unavailable elsewhere: traceroute, rusers,
rev, whois, etc.
4 Extremely sophisticated file manipulation tools
5 On-line storage for files
6 Extremely fast ability to leap between applications
7 Ability to _work_ a lot more mail options
8 A _homespace_ which foregrounds all other operations
9 Secure chat such as ytalk
10 Access to all the telnet ports
11 Nothing beats yet the Unix news readers which turn newsgroups into
easily accessible content, _news_
12 Total ability to configure your own account; I run memo programs here,
for example, that I wrote myself - and they reside on Panix, using Perl
13 With traceroute etc. the ability to really test the health/waters of
the Net
14 An interface that is coherent and easier to understand (I know this
from teaching)
15 Coherent and extensive help is available through man or apropos
commands
16 Runs on _every_ computer I've seen through straightforward communi-
cations software.

{k:1}


Teaching tonight, I found a number of students did not know what a prompt
was, in any format. This will become more comment.

The _potential_ screen or space implied by 
C:\>
will have been replaced by <a> <b> <c> options, already preconfigured.

Instead of the quasi-programming commands like sed, debug, grep, awk, or
availability of Perl, Qbasic, etc., preconfiguring will function as both
filter and puncture. No longer a body of space or text, computational
space becomes a tangle or hierarchy of links.

As with Network television, this space, pre-constructed, constructs the
subject as well: into consumption, continuous upgrade, format.

And as with all consumption, seduction is critical - using sound, music,
memories of revolution. The space of the Turing machine has disappeared.

The task no longer draws itself forth into the blankness of creative mis-
management; instead, tasks are already enumerated, packaged.

Consider these _packets of (post)modernization,_ (Berger); the effects are
already lost, efface, a deconstruction of sublimation. _It_ scatters.

_They're_ gone.

Dirty Secrets, Dirty Nature, Dirty Nature of Dirty Secrets


Given the nature/culture division;
given the dirty/clean division:
we have incommensurable inscriptions here, passing as bifurcations:
dirty nature (dirt beneath a plant / saps within a plant)?
clean nature (ocean, sea, longing of pond)?
dirty culture (lumpenproletariat, _other_)?
clean culture (homebase)?

So that the categories appear not to apply, but;
we have incommensurable inscriptions here, passing as bifurcations:
trashed nature (intersection with dirty culture)?
cleansed nature (intersection with clean culture, suburbia)?
stripped nature (second-growth forests)?
stripped culture (bricolage)?

So that the categories appear dissolute, but;
we have further incommensurable inscriptions, passing:
female nature (male <feminine stereotyping>)?
male nature (red in tooth and claw masculine stereotyping)?
female culture (masquerade <feminine stereotyping>)?
male culture (masculine stereotyping)?
or dirty females cleansed males <fascisms, Leviticus>?
or dirty males cleansed females <sports, cheerleaders>?

So that we have prejudices, stereotyping, divisions always already askew. 
And so of course our divisions are faulty; I was led to this through a
consideration of _dirty nature,_ one might consider _dirty fish_ as well. 
Here is a site always deconstructed, yet intersecting with doxa, the they,
everyday life. The assertion is _that on the other hand._ The assertion is
not _that on the other's hand,_ which may be the left hand, the hand left
behind, as well as the hand behind the back - or the left hand, which I
write with, re/produce as instrument, my dirty little secret.

I would say that division depends on inscription, that categories are not
always complementary, that a null set is not always a null set. I would
also say that the problem of division is: Who is holding the mirror of the
other? Who is otherwise holding?

The universe preserves chirality.

Remnant


This I found, recent, buried in my files on my hard-drive, a tomb or epi-
taph from Jennifer, doubling of pico file structures, account crashed out
and down during the denouement, the tail of the bodily word. It is a mem-
orial for Alan, hardly for Jennifer, writing case-sensitive jennifer,
sensitive to everything about her, the languor of her body as she works
through mosses and worts and lemmings. It is, in short, the _nature_ of
the _culture_ <here>:

   UW PICO(tm) 2.9                    File: z                        Modified

it's languor and lunges and a tong altogether, dynasties of tongs and im-
plements just as the uniform is carapace not character / armor, but true
and real revelation in the blacks and whites of the fatherland;

and it's line and length and tinged altogether, tainted with scents and
odors of the true-real body supporting it above and atmospheric, against
blood-red plant-green, the khaki family desert fairy-tale untrue;

and that is the tail of the bodily word, i jennifer always do say.
