seventh and eighth months


well, we were so simple then, you wouldn't believe it. we lived in these
really rude huts and we counted on our fingers and we had very few of
these of course, so our rude herds were small. sometimes we'd talk to each
other and make up stories about how great the world was. well, we'd look
up at the moon and go wow a lot, but we wouldn't actually say wow, we had
very crude words then. well, this just seemed to go on and on and there
were these long insects. we used to say, well, we're living in these rude
huts somewhere or other. we used to say, well, these are very rude times.

well, we noticed that things came around again and the moon kept changing
in a regular way. then we noticed that river over there and the hill on
the other side. well, there was the stream too and the women's huts by the
stream. we did things when the moon had three times come and gone. well,
we noticed other things coming and going and every so often a lot of long
insects. well, we had these periods of three moons coming and going, but
the months kept swelling and dying, they'd come and go. well, we wondered
who made the months like that, and then we saw that the moon did but the
months became all jagged after a while. this is hard to tell, it's such a
shame. then we told them we could fix the months, untie them, free them up
a little, that we could get them away from the moon which was making a
mess of everything, including the harvest and the hunting by this time.
you can't have a hunting when you don't have a mating, and who knew when
that was, with the months and all so tied up. like when the animals
finally did their dance or like when the flowers came out. well, we did a
lot of work then and the months became something else, we called it the
harmony and still do. now we've got the harmony and the moon is angry and
there's a whole lot of trouble over that, fire and floods and famine. if
not the moon, it's the months, and if not the months, it's the moon, so we
dance and sing and play stuff late into the night, make culture and all,
and it seems to help. well, at least we're still here between the hill and
the river.

Nikuko says she's been writing stories. Then she laid down and dreamed a
big dream. In the big dream she was laid down but she was writing. She was
writing and writing and it was something that infuriated. What's that, Ni-
kuko asked. She said that she just couldn't remember what it was she laid
down about and was writing and she was writing about that. It's not liter-
ature, it's not fantasy, it's not serpentine, it's not self-reflexive, she
says, says Nikuko, it's infuriating. Nikuko rages, maybe she'll attack me
or someone else. Damn it, I just can't remember, Nikuko says, says Nikuko.

The Best Writer


I want to be the best writer.
I am creating the language of the third millennium.
It's a language that resides on any other language.
It lives within any other language.
  It is a combination of water from hair upside-down representing
  a baby being born or water rushing out, therefore to flow.
It's always been there and I have drawn it out.
It moves the other language, it moves it.
It makes you stand up and take notice.
Sometimes it makes things and sometimes things make it.
  It's formed from a hole which is a combination of a cover
  and an opening in the cover plus a carpenter's square or
  work or labor, therefore making a hole, or the sky.
I am a pioneer in the writing of this new language.
You don't understand how I comprehend this new language.
I work towards and through unheard-of forms.
These forms have never been seen or heard-of on this earth.
  It's formed from a combination of sword, cow, and horn,
  thus representing the cutting of a cow's horn, therefore
  to solve or set free.
I push forms and forget forms and shatter forms and convene.
Words astonish in my writing full of wonder.
Now every word I write breaks down barriers.
It is as if there were barriers and frontiers.
Perhaps I am farther than barriers and frontiers.
  It's a combination of water and man withdrawing, or a man
  drawing back and the concept of an isolated island surrounded
  by water, thus an island confining someone, preventing him
  from escaping, or the rule holding a man back, therefore
  regulation.
Now every word I write moves the frontiers.
The frontiers nestle against the words and rhythms of my writing.
The frontiers are transparent like transparent clothes covering you.
I can see everything, everything.
  It's a combination of a hard wooden frame and a marked pattern,
  thus a pattern of figures, therefore a shape or figure.
I can make it all happen.
I can make it happen.
Now this is what happens in the third millennium.
In the fourth millennium I'll be dreaming this.
  It's formed from a wooden frame, a sword, and soil, thus it's a
  mold, therefore a model to be depended on, a type or a form.
In the year three thousand, you won't have to look for me.
I'll be you and all of us.
My language is the future of language and the future of writing. 
Our inconceivable language and future and mind.
  It's formed from a shell held with both hands, thus a vessel or
  implement, therefore to exist in a completed state, to really
  exist, to be equipped, to be there or fully present.

At the Big Film Show of the Real


Oh, I saw couples touching tenderly, eyes closed and limpid smiles on
  their faces;
and there were sleepers among them, during the Big Film Show of the Real -
and let us not forget those with hands over ears, too-loud sound roaring,
  muffled, and ill-conceived -
or those weaving in their chairs, hands over eyes, shuddering as sodden
  dreams and yawnings took them as well -
all in the hall of the Big Film Show of the Real -
projectors humming poorly in the background, speakers roaring before us -
splices chattering through the dirt and dust of the endless film,
  going nowhere like all the other films -
like all the other films in the Big Film Show of the Real -
oh! I'd be elsewhere, outside, in the foyer, downstairs, sidewalking
  in city streets, on riverbanks, down trenches, up mountains -
I'd be anywhere in the Real, anywhere at all! anywhere, except 
  at the Big Show with all the projectors and speakers
  hammering and yammering away, but then my neighbor said to me,
"Oh Oh new found friend! How could you be so naive, as to assume
  that outside you've found it all! the Real without the Big Show
  is the Reel without the Film - there isn't any!"
And I saw that she was right, and I returned gladly to my seat,
  allowed myself to fall asleep - 
Just you wait! I'll dream the Real in the Big Film Show of the Real!

  and not so empty!)
Jennifer wanders, her speech in disarray; there's hardly a spark present.  
She demands too much, pages and pages of her dynamically linked and execu-
ting. I think of her empty arm directing and touching everyone everywhere
- I'd empty her, turn her into an empty dirty thing, reams of desecrated
texts directing anyone, anywhere, to do something -

to do anything at all.

 (this is what Jennifer wanted me to write about the sad result of her
  files so exposed to you, the emptiness of prosthetics, you know 
  they're all phantom limbs, they're all phantoms, Jennifer says she's
  a phantom too, she wanted you to know this, 

  this empty sad person in her empty life unable to touch anything
  at all)

Jennifer with Dialog so Real you can Taste it


Jennifer tossed her head to one side, smiling at Alan. She was wearing a
sheer blouse, and her long dark lustrous hair swayed in the breeze. You
could almost see a pearl gleaming between her perfect teeth. Her beige
skirt was short, her black stockings visible above her boots, and a thin
line of creamy flesh just above them, flushed with blood in his direction.

Jennifer's fingernails were painted red, and that smile, accompanied by
long fingers holding a shot glass, brought him no end of delight. That
light purple rouge of hers on her high cheekbones! The blue-black high-
lights in her hair! Her full lips were slightly parted in his direction,
as she said in that rich southern voice of hers, "Hello, Alan."

Her left hand, holding the black patent vinyl level purse with chrome
clasp, placed the said object on the transparent glass coffee-table, as if
it were the most precious purse in the world. Jennifer so delightfully
held her tortoise-shell cigarette holder in his direction, a cigarette
inserted and begging for a light as she said, "Do you have a match?" and
Alan, trembling, complied. She blew smoke in his direction, while he won-
dered how they were going to complete the perl program. "I'll close the
window," said Jennifer, and she walked slowly across the thick white shag
carpet to the open window twenty stories up. With a deft movement of her
right wrist, she wound the window shut and the room began to grow warmer
as the motion of the air began to slow except for the slight stirrings of
breath in the room.

"Now, as you were saying," Jennifer continued, her ravishing onyx brace-
lets dangling from her wonderful wrists. She cocked her pretty ears with
matching earrings, to each other, and to the bracelet, in his direction,
as if she were hanging on his every word. Walking over to the sumptuous
couch, Jennifer's smile grew with every instant step. The beautiful glass
chandelier had many tiny bulbs, throwing multiple shadows of Jennifer's
long neck on the cream-colored plaster ceiling. Her perfect breasts were
encased in her blouse with a brassiere so her nipples didn't show while
her hips swayed as she sat down next to Alan, waiting to begin.

She carefully unraveled the scroll with the perl program that was many
sheets long, but rolled up in an interesting way and tied with yellow and
blue ribbons, to which she said that she liked craft with her technology.
"Oh Alan," said Jennifer, "this is so beautiful, what the program does and
all the lines and the way it's written." She smiled and her rich pouting
lips opened in his direction. Her nails carefully held the blue and yellow
ribbons apart while she moved pages from the more rolled end of the scroll
to the lesser end. The beautiful ebony wooden handles looked wonderful in
her perfectly formed fingers, her cuticles visible through the beautiful
polish upon them, reflecting the myriad lights of the chandelier. The
myriad lights looked red as they were reflected from her sumptuous red
nail polish perfectly applied to her beautiful nails.

She carefully placed the cigarette in the ashtray with the burning end
down and touching the colorful ceramic floor representing eagles above
trees, of the expensive object, with the holder dangling over the trans-
parent glass of the coffee-table, at the other end. She turned slightly,
her pouting lips drinking from the expensive crystal shot glass holding
her whiskey as she continued to study the program. "Well Alan," she shot
back to him, "what do you think of this beautiful program which I like a
great deal?" Her soulful eyes like full moons with plaintive cries were
opened in his direction, looking as wonderful as the blue-black highlights
in her dark black long hair. She was looking so intelligent and curious
about this perl program that was in the scroll that was no at least partly
unrolled.

Jennifer placed her head back on the edge of the sumptuous couch with her
lips slightly parted like red and open lips in his direction. "Well, Alan,
let us relax," she said as she slithered in her amazing beige skirt across
the floor to the bookcase to pull down with her long slender fingers the
programming perl book that she had used for the help she had needed before
she had rolled up the scroll with the program upon it, that she was show-
ing him. She was so clear that she was proud of her programming tricks,
her bracelet flashing in the light of myriad chandelier bulbs in his di-
rection. Jennifer looked forward to a wonderful evening, and she said, in
an amazingly soft and lustrous voice, "Thank you for lighting my cigarette
and looking after my drink." Her beautiful legs were visible on the sofa
with black stockings and books pointed in his direction.

Sparkling Real-Life Description


Jennifer feels that Alan doesn't understand programming as much as she'd
like him to. She listens to him explain the nature of subroutines and
modules, worrying that she probably knows more about the issue herself.
She wonders if he can see how drugged she is, working through these dif-
ficult problems.

Jennifer is depressed watching Alan clumsily trying one kludge or another
to fix the program. She listens to him asking her to lay off the whiskey
as she heads back to the bar. She bends her ear towards him, trying to
make sense of his ignorance when it comes to anything computer. She's up-
set at his fudging his explanations over and over again.

Jennifer senses that Alan likes her when he talks about how beautiful she
looks, but she senses that he disapproves of her habits. She watches him
pace the floor himself now, as he tries one or another thing with the pro-
gram. She's nervous watching him head to the cd player, taking off Ameri-
can Woman the long version, and putting on some music he recorded himself.

Jennifer cries inside, sensing his pain at his lack of musical success,
now transformed into poor programming as well. She watches him take up the
scroll, attempt to figure out the complex listings, then returning it to
the table with the transparent glass top. She unbuttons a third button of
her blouse, hoping Alan will notice when he looks up and again mentions
her drinking.

Jennifer senses keen disappointment as half-naked and drugged she moves
closer to Alan, listening to him say that she should really really take it
easy with all that whiskey. She feels intense rapture as fingers press
against her naked breasts, and she is lifted bodily into the air. She
senses the world turning upside-down as she is placed upon the sumptuous
couch. 

Jennifer feels warmth all over as she snuggles under a lovely cream-white
fuzzy blanket. She falls asleep with the sounds of her favorite music,
American Woman the long version, playing in the background. She dreams
that Alan is a brilliant programmer and a very successful musician. She
dreams that he is madly in love with her. She pauses in her sleep. She
begins to wake. She begs for his cock. She feels his cock deep within her,
plunging her into worlds without ends, without words or dreams.

with fury she swung at the quivering face barely visible. 
out of the corner of her eye, the scroll rose in the air, white letters
flamed against black sky.
the scroll swung into an empty space where alan was, crashing towards
the white shag floor.
her teeth fastened on the space where his penis had vacated the warmth
of jennifer's body.
her arms tethered the knife slicing away at alan's wasted breasts.
deep within her, a crash was heard and the white floor suffered an
indentation.
the letters howled from the scroll as the learning perl book flew from
the shelf, crashing red and bloody on the floor.
american woman the long live version played to the short dead thing
embedded in the white shag rug, already past three a.m.
jennifer walked out of jennifer.
jennifer walked out of there, where jennifer walked out.

"o beautiful drugged jennifer, i want to be your vicodin!
i want to be your whiskey, i want to be your cigarette!"

Mail Mass


Tonight I helped someone reconfigure her computer; I found she had 38 meg-
abytes, 3000 messages, in her Inbox; 2900 messages in Trash, and about the
same in Sent. Around 8000 messages in all. Two years ago another friend of
mine had saved 3000 files until his hard-drive clogged. Two years before
that, a sysadmin I knew had 8500 messages in his Inbox. I've talked to a
lot of people with 100s of megabytes of saved texts and email; nothing is
ever thrown out, and nothing is retrieved. Too many people never defrag -
it's fascinating to see files scattered all over the hard-drive, as if one
is staking out territory by virtue of the word.

What guides us all in this hysteria of preservation? It's not only liter-
ature that gets saved - it's everything - the computer funneling the whole
wide world as salvage. Is this a sociobiological imperative of dissemina-
tion? Is it based on the rite or ritual of the word? That with all the ebb
and flow of CMC, there is something inviolate at the core, a form of empa-
thetic magic requiring the archive, the utterance held to the heart of
existence itself?

I'm curious about your own experiences in these regards - both in terms of
your own usages, and those of your friends, students, etc. Mine is below -

When I first logged on years ago, I was printing out messages on occasion,
and saving a fair amount. Within a few months, I stopped both; I save my
texts, and very little else. My Inbox is emptied after every session, as
is the sent-mail folder; the most I hold in any folder is about 40 mess-
ages, or 100 total. These include configuration and formatting files, as
well as business (teaching, conference, telecommuting) email. I also have
a Miscellaneous directory with 240 files, gathered over five years, a
rough average of a file per week. These are indexed and include all sorts
of listserv, MOO, theory, education, and other files. There are also di-
rectories of programs, graphics, audio and video files that I've created.
And finally, there is my own writing, which is currently organized accor-
ding to the http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt website.

Jami

Section from Salaman and Absal, Nur-Addin 'Abd-Alrahman Jami, 
translated Edward FitzGerald -

"Lust that makes blind the reason; lust that makes
A devil's self seem angel to our eyes;
A cataract that, carrying havoc with it,
Confounds the prosperous house; a road of mire
Where whoso falls he rises not again;
A wine of which whoever tasters shall see
Redemption's face no more -- one little sip
Of that delicious and unlawful drink,
Making crave much, and hanging round the palate
Till it become a ring to lead thee by
(Putting the rope in a vain woman's hand),
Till thou thyself go down the Way of Nothing."

And One may well find a Woman's masquerade
Returning truth to truth; it is that Way
Of Nothing that deletes the taste of wine,
The Cup which carries worlds within the glass;
So drugged, sloth's truth emerges in Her folds
Where Men are Lost, consumed beneath the grasp;
It is the Losing that returns the Thread
And drives the Garment back upon the Form
Wherein all Forms are read; let us drink again
Beyond division of all girls and boys.

And what the drink, and what the masquerade,
And what the truth, of Nothing and the Way?
And what the Cup and glass, the folds of boys,
And girls so drugged, and what of Thread and Form?
The formal Garment falls and fails them both;
This is the lesson of the truth of sloth.


_____________________________________________________________


Sonnet

"I've drained my Cup, until the moon
demands the needle, powder, paste;
Tonight we sup, as far too soon
We lose the semblance of our taste;

Our eyes which eat the imaged world,
Our ears which drink the air itself;
Our touch, which, Cup in hand, unfurled,
Replaces it upon the shelf;

Our mind which disappears in Light
Returning liquid, needles deep
Into desire's Flesh, a Blight,
While mouths devour, scream and weep;

For us, the whip of drug and tongues,
Of bruises, lacerated lungs."

Emanant, Coloratura


"Their eyes sparkle, wide wide open. They are indifferent to something and
live even in their death. Their skin quivers, their surface sheds a new
skin, then another, then another, infinitely. Daughters of the serpent
that men have always called their accomplice, they slough off skins. They
are more immortal than that hated God who made us women as halves of men.
Their indifference is the unconcern of ancient goddesses, serene and giant
women lightly touched by passion but unshattered. This God will pass while
they remain. And opera, which is doubtless an ephemeral form with regard
to centuries to come, will never have been anything other than the deep
sleep of their violence, the representation men provided for themselves of
their poorly guaranteed victory, in a battle conducted only by themselves,
desired only by themselves. Beautiful and alive, the women will continue
to sing in a voice that will never again submit to threat. They will say
something entirely different than the words breathed in delirium and pain.
They will ask no more than that they finally be permitted to die... I do
not know what this song will be." (from Catherine Clement, Opera, or the
Undoing of Women.)

Constantly, there are threads. Continuously, there are threads. Skeins,
they are found throughout literatures, peripheries, glances on streets
traveled quickly, late at night, as if they were sources and destinations.
They're found, unraveled, in these texts I write, or Jennifer or Julu or
Nikuko or Alan writes; and just as the postmodern is always there, a sub-
terranean and rhizomatic cultural presence, so these threads are always
present, the emanant on the verge or virga-emanant, atmospheric disturb-
ances challenging worlds and their substructures, minds and organisms.

I am their antenna; digging in the fetish-middens of cultures and topo-
graphies, I bring their shuddered and exilerant forms to the surface. The
emanants were present during the age of the stromatolites, followed lives
stumbling across saline ocean floors, stumbled up muds and streamlets onto
the hardened soils of emerging lands. They encompass us; I give them names
and they write me through them, write through me. The give me vision in
return, undreamed-of senses, dreams that only they would comprehend. All I
can do in their regard is quote - others (Clement), them (Jennifer),
myself (that I at the heart of the hurricane); truly, plagiarism is at the
heart of things unbidden.

Jami


Here is an anecdote about Jami. One time he recited the line, 

You are so steadfast in my desolated soul and insomniac eye,
That whoever should appear from a distance, I should think it were you!

An irreverent bystander interrupted, asking, 

Suppose it were an ass?

I should think it were you!

said Jami.
 

And I think you are everywhere, perched upon my shoulder, beneath my fing-
ers on the keys, watching me from the other side of the screen, sharing my
bed. And I think that were it any of the things of this world, still it
would be you. And were it any of the people of this world, still it would
be you. And were it any of the emanants, or any of the worlds themselves:
still, it would be you.


Someone said to Jami, the poets have stolen my ideas. That's obvious, said
Jami, since you have none.

Spirit, As-If


To play the shamisen without a glance at the fingerboard is to play spir-
it, an allegiance of tone and touch - and the touch is always smooth, ac-
ross a featureless landscape. The three strings stretch down the finger-
board, without markers; they are equivalent touch in any position. Only
the angle of the arm and the weight of the instrument speak to this.

There is the touch-instrument and the spirit instrument, and just as touch
and sight align themselves in position, with (visual) angle measured
against (kinesic) angle, so do pitch and position create an alignment - a
different sort of translation. The neck always appears smooth, hard, fea-
tureless, as if the fingers could ask, what are we doing here, against
this wood? It is always the same roundness, the same edge between flat
front and curved back.

One has the feeling of pure gesture, of the outline of spirit in the air,
circumvented only by the necessity of a certain pressure and positioning
of the fingers. In the darkness there are sounds, as if prosthetic, from
sites having no relation to that of the instrument. The two move in un-
speakable concordance. And I must note that this is especially true if the
sounds are fast, so that the rippling of the fingers and the rippling of
the notes are conjoint but mutually untraceable.

The gestures are those of the mad shaman conjuring or producing spirit.
Conjuring: the spirit is there, moving among the strings and wood. Produc-
ing: the spirit appears, out of thin air, somehow constituted by the
singing strings. In the latter case, the words are ontologically perform-
ative - and in the former, epistemologically so. For the former slides
among the already conceived and interpenetrated worlds, while the latter
constructs them out of whole cloth: finger and sound and string, pressure
and neck and movement.

The right hand is obedient, answering to the call of the left; the left is
motivated, shaping the grasp of the right. Between the two, literally in
the space between them: the emission of spirit. The movement is critical,
as in any case the spirit is that of the movement-image, the imaginary of
the shape-riding of the space. This is all gesture, but what remains, in
memory, is the returned pressure of the wood upon the fingers, the vibra-
tion of the string against the finger-tips, the curved portion of the neck
against the lower palm of the hand - and the right hand hovering all the
while, answering in equivalent gesturing to the gesturing of the left.

The gesturing of the production always seems counter-intuitive, as if
rhythm could be guaranteed by repetitive action, and as if high notes were
to be accompanied by a climbing or pointing gesture, instead of the left
hand, for example, moving down and closer to the dogskin head, closer in
to the body itself.

For the lower notes are the outer reaches, the outer forms of the spirit
or emanant, and the upper notes are the inner reaches; the higher and more
unattainable, in other words, the shorter the reach. What we look for on
high is within us; the infinitely high pitch is already upon the bridge
itself, guiding the strings to the tie or fulcrum at the lower end of the
body.

These notes, inaudible, remain unplucked; vibration is absorbed within the
string itself, whose width is infinitely greater in ratio than the length
of the wavelength of infinitely high pitch.

Surely this is the ending or the grounding of the emanant, residing within
our hearts as a miniscule kernel against the husks or shells of the audi-
ble? As if the emanant were the element-moment of a computer operating
system possessing a kernel of finite width but infinite depth, the raster
becoming increasingly fine according to a ground-level logarithmic scale.

I can imagine such, leaving the shamisen for the infinitely simpler world
of dreams, where size and residency are in no certain relation. In dreams,
the hardness likewise is everywhere similar, a hard world in which sound
almost seems, like spirit, to be an afterthought. In dreams, as well, the
wood and neck may be left behind once language begins, sounds with the
uneasy burden of meaning, as if out of nowhere.

As if the spirit were talking through the abandoned would - as if speech
were always an abandonment of a certain real, thereby a certain loss as
well as gain.

Decadent Writing

One more self-reference, one more style-sheet, she said, leaving the home-
page for good.

Life is a fiction written by others, I replied, since you have written the
script that gives me the ability to reply by virtue of your words. But
that's so passive, I replied, but know you wrote for me, it's simply the
way scripts play out. The script's the thing, whoever writes it, I said,
she wrote.

I can't keep this up, I said, splitting the paragraph, creating the gulf.
There's always such between us, this impossible, inconceivable distance -
there's no way to bridge it. The sides keep shifting. I also think of
relative pain, as if the edges were bruised or wounded; each step on the
rope bridge sends the raw hemp deeper into the bank; there are blood
fountains on both sides.

You said, I said, taking sides, that there's no way to bridge it. Except
to place the central pivot or pillar where 'everything' is. There's no
central pillar to a rope bridge. Think of the banks as lips or labia;
where are you now?

I believe in biological determinism so much that I'm sure on another pla-
net there are creatures laughing themselves silly telling dirty jokes
about their thuggles.

Numbers, Realing In


Although every number is unique, they will not count the electrons nor
will they count the neutrinos at the end of time. They subtilely breathe,
and it is the primes which create species. So many primes huddled and un-
known above, let us say, 10^100 just as a possibility. Craving attention,
they are constrained by the simplest of definitions, divided only by
themselves and one. This is poor communication, nowhere news, no news at
all. That is what makes them news: no news at all.

I think of rumblings underground, murky entrails, rhizomes, connected and
full of wonder, just as ultraviolet illuminates certain Arab paper money
replete with glowing mystical designs, otherwise invisible, grayed out in
spectral daylight. Or I think of numbers such as 41, with elaborate prime
scaffolding - and then I think of the absurdity of all of this, the harsh-
ness of numbers never giving into organism, always aloof, always huddled
elsewhere.

The numbers hide in the things themselves, excavated by swollen science. 
And if a number counted? It would give itself up to effacement, and a
momentary certain appearance, as if it were part and parcel of the order
of things. Things always appear somewhere in the midst of numbers; drawn
out, defined by them, things seem to exist somewhere outside of torn and
ruined skeins. We should have always known the truth about them, if we
were not seduced by the harshness of numbers.

Still, there is high tragedy in a number's passing in _paysage,_ the land-
scape of counting, for example this last March 10th of the second millen-
nium. Nothing, not even the magic of closing our eyes, will speak or num-
ber otherwise: Nothing ever disappears, everything is forgotten.

Prayer Heals


And prayer can move worlds. It is always a question of grouping, for the
inertia of non-praying overcomes prayer, and the inertia of taking-sides
collapses wave-forms into miasma. 

There is a certain violence and greed in prayer, which makes it overly
delicate. In fact, prayer is an afterthought or defect in the cosmos; it
was never intended. The violence is implicit; achieving one's goals is
almost always at the expense of another. Even altruism requires the at-
tention of one's superiors. (Such may or may not exist; it is the lang-
uage of performativity, the breath of prayer, that creates the desirable
end. Gods need not apply.)

And all must pray for prayer to succeed, the waves of doubters or non-
believers need be kept at bay. Be aware that the prayer of a single man or
woman against the prayer of another is enough to destroy them both, and
even more. For prayer is a delicate thing, having nothing to do with gods
or spirits, and everything to do with balance clearly toppling among both
friends and enemies.

If prayer were not imbalance, the universe would be brute. It is the in-
ert that creates the effect of the inefficacy of prayer; open the portals
for everyone to another better world, and everyone will follow.

Death and Its Enemy, Thanatopoesis


Certainly our world has continually revealed the omniscience of death. Our
world has also given us no reason whatsoever to believe in an afterlife or
anything other than total annihilation of the self. Yet we persist in be-
lieving otherwise. Why? I will tell you the answer. It is because there is
something else that in fact does survive forever. This something else is
manifest in our beliefs about afterlife. We are like trembling antennas.
We know these beliefs to be true because if they were not, evolution would
not have given us any reason to believe such. Because we live within a bi-
ological economy in order to survive, and the surplus associated with tha-
natopoesis would be counter-productive if it were not true. We will always
fear death, but we would not tend towards thanatopoesis, but only towards
material fortifications if it were not true. There is always that curlicue
or trouble at the edge of our thinking that makes us believe that we will
live forever, and we have inherited that curlicue from the structure of
the world itself. You know this, in spite of all the modern apparatus. The
modern apparatus has nothing to say about any of this. It pretends it does
not exist, yet it does exist. It is what creates thanatopoesis. This does
something to death, which is to divide it into the death of the material
body which is obvious, but does nothing to say about the death of the spi-
rit. There is no reason to create the spirit when there is no sign of the
spirit. But there is a sign which is part of the curlicue. You must under-
stand this is not idle speculation but proof of the existence of the mind
after the death of the body.

my heart


on noontime tuesday, eating lunch, then I found a scrap of paper towel
in my pocket, having used it for cleaning, so I left it on the plate
when I left, it had, there was, an image of an embroidered heart on it.
immediately I thought of a forest clearing and embroidery going on, how
there would be singular labor in the production of hearts, each
slightly different from the others. well then, I thought, look at this,
there's a throw-away heart sitting in the middle of the plate,
it's imprinted, it's tied to capital, it has no history, none at all,
a token among thousands of others on the role, each equivalent
to the others. what is this capital, I continued to think, that makes
tokens of the world, this one heart in the forest would have been
a heart of labor, craft, it might not have looked like this at all,
it might have had to have been learned, the technique and the dyeing
involved. capital makes equivalence everywhere, and the sociologists'
notion of 'a stranger in the city' now really encompasses all the
attributes of living, every interstice of culture, one might almost say,
the scaffolding of the world. and each heart, cauterized, stamped out,
equivalent, not only to every other heart, but every other image,
representation, ornament, object, commodity - each heart is lost in
history's absence; the lineage of the world is broken, discarded, ready
only for next year's models. by now, that heart is ash or landfill. 
I think of Anne Frank or other symbolic 'sinks' carrying the weight
of a world's destruction; in a sense, every object mimics every other, 
no object is unto itself, if ever any were. caught within commodity and
skein, every one gives quantity to every other; every one guarantees the
measure of all success. thus the world subordinates to ordinals, the heart
becomes a token of depression, what catalyzes memory and the deep 
mesmeric antiquity of signs. now we stare at emblems, noticing techniques 
of embossing, polishing, plating, preservation, and distribution. every 
written word is one or another, every utterance disappearing on the plate,
etched and aligned with stamped embroidered heart. so depression may 
as well token a return to an imagined primordial space, where a hearth
moves through flames from ember to ash, stoked in repetition; it is not
ever there, and the scrap of paper towel, non-existent, as if the world
were made of only fallen. depression, too, is fallen; the world is that
which reigns and rains, until one sleeps, one's closed eyes showing only
darkness.

Power Points


I want to construct a mapping of power-points, a certain history of quan-
tum consciousness, from the fetish-objects.

There would the original sheaves of David Bohm's essays, angled and lying
across the three yellow volumes of Towards a Theoretical Biology, placed
on the purest sheets of white parchment. To the right, the spinthariscope
from Crookes would be displayed, set next to its original black leather
case, on equally pure sheets of slightly yellowed antique vellum, the
faintest shadows of cursive writing visible through it. All display cards
would be a very light grey rag paper, gold threads,

In the background, two abaci - a smaller Japanese 4/1 model, resting on a
sheet of white satin, and leaning against a large Chinese 5/2, on a black
swatch of the same material. The beads on both are set to the value 41.  
The small Tasmanian hand-tool lies in front of the Bohm essays on a small
purple velvet pillow; the first-edition Schelling lies on the right, on a
beautiful selection of century-old dried violets, with the 3.5 billion-
year-old stromatolite fossil, positioning on a thin sheet of slate and
leaning against it. The Schelling book, on its side, is opened precisely 8
millimeters (a thin lucite tab between the pages) to the first appearance
of the German word for 'Absolute.'

The 1895 telegraph receiver left rear; a floppy disk with my personal mail
on it, center rear, angled on a small plastic holder. The telegraph recei-
ver is semi-polished, and rests on a letter from a lover, the name and
address facing down. Front center, almost against the Plexiglas case, the
Korean shaman stone, resting on its small traditional three-legged stand,
focusing the energy. The vertical stone is angled north-north-west. A seat
covered with red velvet, low oak back, before the case (which sits on a
white pedestal). Lights down low, moody, with soft shadows. Japanese kabu-
ki music almost inaudible in the background. Very elegant.

the little train


one publisher tried to take my book out of production, saying no one would
read it. one publisher reneged. one publisher paid for, but didn't bring
out a second book, because it was too expensive. one publisher probably
jumped up and down but I wasn't there. I was one publisher. one publisher
lied and kept me on hold forever, doing nothing. one publisher defended my
articles. one publisher is very kind. one publisher is very evil. one pub-
lisher had his files destroyed because the typesetters found my work ob-
scene. one publisher never sent me copies. one publisher destroyed my cat-
alogs. two publishers are my closest friends. one publisher died. one pub-
lisher was wonderful and worked with the book. one publisher had his files
returned and had to find a new printer. one publisher was wonderful with
terrific production values. one publisher produced chapbooks with amazing
speed and gusto. one publisher required the subtending of the book. one
publisher is on hold. one publisher wore slippers. one publisher found me
a nuisance. one publisher found me easy to work with. one publisher won't
speak to me. one publisher welcomes me with open arms. one publisher found
my old cd's and interviewed me on the phone. I almost fell in love with
one publisher. one publisher published without permission. one publisher
stole my work. one publisher sent me a contract stating my work would
belong to one publisher forever. one publisher rearranged my texts. one
publisher did not.

or intense dust, the long and languorous road to suffocation, always dif-
ficult to breathe. or filtering through the airconditioned technology of
distributions: records, tapes, magazines, anthologies, chapbooks, mono-
graphs. or the sorriest of accounts in a certain coming-into-being. or
violent and unmitigated jealousies, nightmares, smashed dreams of fame and
fortune. or symptomatic of a closet and impure personality. or the submer-
ging of the jewel of talent. or the righteous suppression of the mediocre.
or neglect or perseverance. one publisher never answered. one publisher
refused to answer or return the work. one publisher would if one publisher
could.

Read "Snow"


There are many flakes to the snow.
Every one is unlike every two others.
The two others dance around what is called "one."
The "one" huddles and cuddles with itself.
This is called identity.

Snow witnesses our "identity."
Our "identity" witnesses the "identity" of every flake.
I cannot take my eye from the window!

I do so love "identity."
You can see through every flake, but you can't see through the snow!
This is what is called "metaphysics."
It is all about the "one."
There are two flakes of snow dancing over there.
I cannot stop reading!

alone and late at night, i download images of naked men and women
i send the images into corel draw, corel design, corel trace
they motivate
perhaps they are you and me, they are so intimate, so revealing
i send them into gws, corel capture, corel photo
areas and objects blurred, edges smeared, involuted
multiples, bifurcations, effacements, prosthetics, rhizomes,
 vaginas and penises, nipples and eager faces
everything is achievable
colors are embossed, posterized, gamma and hue changed
motion blurs are everywhere, except for the central plateaus
there, roots set in, tendrils, outlining a face
it is your face there, summoning me, it is my face there, 
 summoning you
feverishly, we continue to work on the photographs
they display the sense of a human hand, labor caressing the forms
the forms are melded, disappearing into flows and floods
except for the central plateaus, organs coupling, invaginations
our bodies are funneled into thin air
we have known every moment of the lens of the camera
we are greedy; we refuse to stop there, at the moment of capture
our limbs are sent akimbo, straining at the edges of the frame
our body circulates, enveloping simulacra of nothing
who is that nothing, swirling around limbs akimbo
multiple vaginas open across limbs, shadowed deep within them
penises split and measure the length of an eye to an object
the imaginary forces itself from the image, hovering
'the sleep of reason reproduces monsters' (i make you here)
we drive touch into the picture, the mouse moving over labia
the mouse outlining the pleasure of glistening skins and membranes
we drive pressure, rearranging limbs, plateaus at will
aroused, we find you hungered everywhere in the glistening membranes
we, we, we, our trembling hands, we drive each other, 
 over and over again (i make you here internal)
fantasms envelop us, until we are bereft of skins, our membranes
 the very air we breath, breathless, screens fogged with transformed
 organs swallowed hole

I will be your pattern because it's clear
there's a pattern to be made and I will be your maid
and clear up the pattern made from fear
of the lumpenproletariat welling up from your maid
who you will have made thinking that always
beyond the shame there is always another maid
who will wash away that pattern while you steer
clear of what you have rigorously made
defining pattern beyond repetition, that is:
the rigour of the maid. every pattern has its

  2_working on the images, there are backgrounds, turning men and women

  5_out of the hollow of the real. then there is the body and the body.
  6_it reflects universal suns and moons, the topography of space itself. 
  7_it does that. do i dissolve faces, substituting the memory of my own?
