THE WORK, An Outline


"Au voile qui la ceint absente avec frissons"  (Mallarme)

I address the problem of ELECTRONIC SUBJECTIVITY by virtue of several
threads, all concurrent. I continue this addressing, each thread
writing and rewriting the text, a continuous-production or discourse
against the grain.

The GRAIN, GRANULARITY, is a physical reality both classical and
quantum-mechanical, a physical reality whose appearance is that of the
grain: letters on a bleak field, the grains of granite and
photographic film, beach-sand, the granularity of the retina itself.

The SUBJECT "au voile" or VEILED SUBJECT is defined by ADDRESS
(location, without which the subject no longer exists); RECOGNITION
(the activated ADDRESS opening and closing channels of communication);
PROTOCOL (the syntactic structure of communication); and REWRITE (a
continuous-production or reiteration of the subject, a flood or
EMISSION of the symbolic). 

The EMISSION is a signifying; a SPEW is a symbol-dump, noisy and
granular, referencing the real exterior, transforming the interior
into an abject. EMISSION and SPEW are communicative occasions whose
analog is the set of GENERALIZED MEASURE GEOMETRIES, always but not
quite symmetrical, always reiterative. The Net diffuses and collapses,
differentiates and integrates, transforming smooth into semantic or
inscribed space, and back again.

The ontology of the Net is UNCANNY, an absenting or problematic
alterity; within the UNCANNY, FANTASM appears, the introjection/
projection (-JECTIVITY or the THROWN, DASEIN) of narratologies and
ACTANTS, "persons," neither present nor absent; these may be
ELECTRONIC SUBJECTS themselves, or a constructed IMAGINARY transmitted
and diffused. NARRATOLOGIES are the collapse of NET DISCOURSE into
remaindered patterns; the opposite is the MURMUR or STUTTER, the
irruption of "frissons" everywhere and nowhere at all. The imaginary
is addictive; Net users become USERS, circulating around specificities
fetishized from emissions, a collapse into the lure of the UNCANNY.
Here, POWER is what passes for POWER. If addiction is the obsessive-
compulsive neurosis of the net, WEB INVERSION is the psychosis,
transforming the body into its exterior, and its exterior into flesh
burned into the Internet itself, wires laid across the skin, the skin
speaking the hieroglyph of imaginary usage.

The DIGITAL DOMAIN is the dominion of eternal life, the dominion of
eternal REWRITE; information is never lost from generation to
generation, but always repeated and repeated absolutely. This is the
dominion of the clean and proper body, the introjection of burnt wires
producing always already a simulacrum of life guaranteeing continuous
discourse. There is no death; DASEIN becomes EMISSION itself. The
SCREEN is the only TERMINAL OPERATION; the screen becomes the EGO or
gateway, the surface of the addictive user. Everything is PERFECTION.
TRUTH and FACTICITY are occurrences, since truth tables are decided
only by ASCII or other decoding/encoding matches. What is true is
present. And what is true is also BEAUTIFUL since perfect and
perfectly clean, always a symmetry or lure.

The GREAT BEYOND is the horizon of the Internet, always farther,
always increasing circulations of the planet which short-circuit or
circumvent. At the edge of the GREAT BEYOND one finds the BLIND 
PASSWORD "absente" beyond which is a null-set or zero file. ONTOLOGY
itself is absent; epistemology is viral, transformative. Nothing is
certain and nothing circulates.

PROPER NAMES circulate throughout the Net, the promise of TRUTH or
BEAUTY, the promise of emission. Such names are FANTASMS; every
possible world is every possible Net world in a continuous morph, and
every KIND is simultaneously a NATURAL and UNNATURAL kind. Thus TRUTH
is each and every occurrence, and who is to say that FALSEHOOD is not
the same? What is neither this nor that is foundation, gestural,
within and without the GREAT BEYOND, UNCANNY. The TERMINAL becomes
retinal but anonymous. Names MURMUR forever, lose identity. NAMES
never had identity to begin with.

The POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE NET constructs a class-consciousness
fuelled by reification-tendencies; everything is reification.
Teleology is defined by a FUTURE IMPERFECT in which reification
constitutes the IDENTITY OF THE SUBJECT ITSELF.

The FUTURE from the exterior results in the LAST SCIENCE FICTION STORY
in which the subject confronts the GREAT BEYOND. Narrative itself
disappears, replaced by PERFECTION. LIFE, once defined by MODULARITY,
has become SUBSTANCE, a REWRITE of the same into the same.

CLARA: THE DESERT LETTER / THE FINAL STORY



Dear Clara, 


I wrote this to you under different names but now it's later and a 
different name again; what's in a name? So that I wonder about the
desert and the people in it. And I wonder in front of the screen
in front of the window, terminal terminal decay...


I'm sitting here looking at a digital map of the United States on one
computer and writing on another and wondering why the mistakes come
through to you that I find when I looked at the receive file here:
I'm not sure what the story is - either I make more errors than I
think I do or the transmission itself adds to them - I think the
latter.

Anyway just bought a book on the theory of storage and symbolization 
as secondary knowledge which cheered me because I've been talking 
about this for a long time now - how thinking is not only dependent 
upon external machines, but their knowledge has become internalized 
with us - which makes theater, for example, the return of the body to 
the text, completely archaic. And I'm wondering about this here while
waiting for another GIF image to form on the screen on the second
machine and they're both fast 486s and I'm going back and forth
between them like a transitive factor from one to another, nothing
more.

And they're both fast and incredibly fast at a speed I can't compre-
hend, they're that fast. And my hands are flying on both of them
together, the left hand on the text and the right hand on the image.
And I'm no longer thinking, what thought beyond or between the
motion of the hands, a flourescent room, an office chair, anonymous
others around me. 

I don't take drugs but if I did I'd be flying overhead. What's on the
other machine is a digital closeup of that part of Arizona I love the
most, a town called Arivaca and the Buenos Aires National Wildlife
Preserve, where almost no one is, the mix of desert and low mountains
incredible. So I'm trying to get closer, all through machinery which
can't resolve the world except in doses of binary data and then some,
and it's impossible and I keep thinking about driving back out to the
desert this summer in the heat - I've walked there in the midst of it
- and meanwhile 230000 bytes of information have been transferred and
Arivaca still remains at about 50 miles down below. How long will
this last?

I keep thinking and I keep my thinking. And I'd give you my all but 
it's dried out in the desert sun. Flourescent.

Now I'm moving forward, now I'm thinking again. And I won't keep it,
won't keep the thought any longer, no little time to lose.

Getting into the GIS system for real now, looking at about 280000
bytes worth of desert southwest until the screen goes blank; the
transformation is slow - not even sure where it's coming form. And I
don't think the map will be readable on this system, which has only
primitive decoding, so I thought I'd write you - meanwhile the path
isn't found, the system crashes... Back in a minute... Moving from
Arivaca Arizona to the El Paso/Juarez region - probably nothing
visible from this high up. I wish I knew what getting closer meant.
I'm sitting here in the mnidst of nothing whatsoever, running two 486
machines simultaneously - I could even use a third because I've been
ANIMATING my programs, animating everything in sight -

Because things don't move fast enough so my fingers move faster. 
Because animation returns me to the world and because movement is a 
reminder of the world. Flourescent.

I feel like a terminal. I don't know what that means. Nothing is the
body WRITE REWRITE.

I AM a terminal. I don't know what that means. Nothing is the body
WRITE REWRITE.

As a terminal I don't have to worry about women. As a terminal I
don't have to worry, just provide the linkages from one machine to
another, occasionally connecting them, disconnecting - moving between
them according to orders that certainly don't come from me -

They come from nowhere, from the internal logic of the machines. I
bring my experiences to them. I bring Arivaca and El Paso and Ciudad
Juarez to them. There's nothing else in the room - the sound of the
keys, the silent 486s, and now a decoding. I can't tell you about
the silence or the loudspeaker DISCONNECT in the midst of decoding.
The sheer inadvertency of language. You would imagine this but for
this; writing this brings it up, brings it to the terminal.

I stop for a moment, look over, examine the image. The image is what
I am. It's dry - the foothills are almost invisible. The land looks
hot; the sun is almost setting from an indeterminate direction. I'm
fifty miles up. No signs of cities, no signs of civilization. The sun
gleams silver gleams silver-white. Against a ground of washes, a
desert air you can taste, hum of a tarantula hawk, opuntia in bloom.

I look again. I recognize the mountain where the bandits are. But
there are no cities and there are no routes and no people. The Rio
Grande, Rio Bravo, is just a trace or memory of a trace, without
origin, turned to ash in the heat. Heat radiates that day at the 
base of the mountain.

I move the cursor on the screen. It says, the screen says, I say:
NO DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REGION. IF YOU CAN
CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE SEND DESCRIPTIONS TO and then a name, also
anonymous. I don't understand, no descriptions for El Paso, Juarez?
Nothing for the Pass to the North, migration routes, elevations
across guarded unguarded terrain? It goes and it goes and it goes; 
I am a terminal returned, refused its description. I toggle back 
to the main menu, a direction given as UP or beyond the place 
where I am at.

I switch from the image to the "caption browser." I'm more
comfortable with words; the lack of description again is uncanny - 
a word I use often to indicate the gaps between alterity and
fulfillment.

But there are no words and nothing to fulfill them, and nothing 
appears; the map cells are diminished, voided in an enormous  
expanse of empty space WHERE THE MAP IS NOT. An error? There is no
further information. Where am I in this land of disconnected cells?
Nothing but emptiness, not even of this earth or any other between
them.

I continue typing on the one machine and waiting and clicking on the
other. The machines are very fast. The lines are not; I watch the
icon of the hour-glass, reset the terminal screen which keeps 
disappearing in order to save itself. The glass appears once again;
the glass is always full. Unlike the desert, the sand never moves.

No sand ever falls in the glass.

No sand ever falls and there is no desert and I am waiting here 
by the terminal machine to bring an end to things, an end to the 
things of the world, a reduction into a binary future, the cleansed 
and proper body. So I will log out, remove myself from speech or 
talk or silence, from a movement towards you, my arms and face 
apart, kindness or supplication. So I will wait, properly, along or 
within the lines, terminated or unterminated, the arrival of 
electronic mail, the shuffle of the man or woman next to me, quiet
conversation in the next room, and my body trembling. My body 
waits for you, the message of you, a life or desert coming through
the wires. I will hold you close, and I will comfort. The dry air
picks up sightly, a breeze. I will hold you close, perhaps devour
you in bits and pieces, coming through one or another gateway, the
message stuttering or stumbling over itself. No one can ever tell
and no sand ever falls.

How to say goodbye? The desert remains frozen on the DISCONNECT
screen, a refusal of LOGOUT, and I continue to part forever, the
room almost silent once again, a distance which never resolves.

Alan, in the time of fear flourescent.


2

The wires are there, visible outside the windows, rain hanging from
them, rain hanging from everywhere. The wires seep into one or
another apartment; bits of flesh hang from them - I recognize 
myself. Would it come to this that I carry a gun firing misrecog-
nitions, turning everyone away at the door? Remember the access
into the niche at the firewall, no turning back, no movement, 
nothing but space indefinite staring you down until ABORT appears
on the horizon.

Fitzgerald said it best, that at sometime in the morning it was the
dark night of the soul - I forget the time, which pastes itself 
upon me. But it's a long way until morning, until the dark night
stops the fingers caressing the keys, one after another; the only
sign of life and culture is an order only partially predetermined,
carrying me flourescent down.

Next door someone plays a game. He has a gun and enters many 
corridors. Some are blank; some continue; some have doors, mysterious
passages always promising to empty out. There are men with guns, but
the men, too, are silent, as is the sound of footsteps running down
the hall. Guns are everywhere, proliferating on the screen, a male
maelstrom fought out in within the body of the woman always absent.
Dimly, I remember the desert. In the desert the guns were rusted,
pieces of revolver from some godforsaken shootout in which everyone
died, the bodies themselves eaten and scattered across the landscape.
The guns don't belong there; the desert knows that. If the desert
is harsh enough, everything will disappear. If the desert is harsh
enough, opuntia, too, go the way of the last lizard; nothing is
left but the flat sky-plate, a few remnants recording in the digital
domain, desperately asking for information. An explosion, silent,
occurs next to me; the screen goes blank for an instant, rewrites
itself and the user as well. Flourescent, the light renews itself
sixty times per second. Illuminated, the ASCII terminal pulses with
light renewed at half that speed. The gunman is in a nightclub; the
desert has become a memory, thrust back, inverted, through the 
wires, nothing emerging anywhere.

Thinking backs itself up in the digital domain; thinking waits for
a user.

I don't want your guns, Maureen; I never have. If the virus is alive
at all, I can hear it calling. It's left the desert, headed for L.A. 
might want to know how it did THAT. Think of the route - through Watz
in Norway, Seleena in Sweden; think of it! From Sharon in Kansas City
painting as if her life depended on it. The wires hummed that night.

It twisted and turned like anything alive. You needed a screen to see
it.

You needed a screen and sometimes even more. I'd turn on Lynx and 
GRRRRRR would appear, flashing like those upper ASCII colors can when
the right binary is hit. I'd turn off or read email; it never 
bothered email.

It got to me through Mosaic. It got to me everywhere, filling the 
screen, slowly turning, carrying not enough audio to cancel out the
room, but enough image to dissolve sight, create the hysteria of 
migraine, splashes of color and light, dissolution of the real.

Because this part HAPPENED. It twisted and turned, a result of VIDEO
TERMINAL REWRITE BYPASS, and it pulsed dark, red and blue, throbbed. 
I called it BRUISED HEART. There was nothing to see, nothing to 
focus on. It was alive, morphed into one or another corrosion, 
dependent upon every movement I made. It knew me. It kept me in line.

Because this part IS TRUE. It forced me to the ground. It spread my
arms my legs. It tied me tight, on my back, immobile. It spread me
open. You could look right up me. You could crawl in my ass. You'd
know everything.

You could see the screen in there. I couldn't see; the murmur of the
desert convulsed the body. My back arched; I wanted you more than
anything in the world, more than your guns, Maureen. You shoved your
hand in me; the cords spelled the name of God. The screen writhed
dark, blue and red (I'd never hear the guns go off but there weren't 
any guns, there wasn't ANYTHING), jagged edges cutting through sight
and site.

Without site I didn't exist. Did I tell everything? There was nothing
to tell, nothing left of me; you pissed on me, piss shattering like
glass cutting out the name of God in my chest.

My chest cut out the name of God. My chest was NEGATIVE ANTI-CHRIST
begging for belief in this or that, one or another. Blood filled me;
my cock spurted it; I was awash in it. I tore my asshole open.

What came out, went in. Your fist shoved the shit back in, turned it
upon itself. The wires burned darker in this dark night. Did I tell
you about the burning wires? Did I tell you about the desert
scattered everywhere, my hair wet with the smell of it? Did I?

You shoved your fist in my mouth. Now I could speak all of those 
names of God that would bring the universe to an end. I smelled of
the end of the universe. I smelled of shit, of all of it. You asked
me so I said:

*I am sixteen years old and I shaved all my hair off. You'll never*
*get to me again you dumb fuck. I'm young but I know ALL ABOUT the*
*world. I can tell you anything. I'm burning with love for Maureen.*
*MY BODY IS FIERCE AND SAVAGE HEAT. I haven't got much time but I*
*will die for you and take you EVERYWHERE! The fucking world can go*
*to hell and you have nothing to tell me anymore! MAUREEN I SHAVED*
*MYSELF FOR YOU! I'm your dumb dumb thing crawling along the wires!*
*I was born with the computer! I crawl a white naked thing, BANG*
*INTO WALLS! I have starved in the farthest reaches of CYBERSPACE!*
*I have seen entire galaxies crumble beneath enormous accelerators*
*of particles massive beyond belief! I suck dark matter galactic*
*strings! THE POWER OF A BILLION DARK STARS! I HAVE FLAMED THE*
*ABYSS OF GOD UNHOLY! I HAVE FUCKED THE UNIVERSE AND IT HAS FUCKED*
*ME BACK!*

So I said this screamed my words to an angry deity held my arms in
supplication opened my cunt to meteors: I twisted and turned.

"I'm ugly. You can't see my face. But if you put on your special
glasses, you'll see me twist and turn." [BRUISED HEART, p. 144.]

Because the virus was there, and I killed it
Because I kill everything I love bringing it to an end
Because the desert returned the sound of life to the form of life
Because the desert killed everything but the virus turned in
        upon itself turned or spiralled downward:

Because of these things, the screen rewrites me
Because of these things, I am given one more chance
Because of them, I am an eighteen year-old girl 
And because of them, I will never make love to a man:

I will make love to Maureen and I will pick up her gun 
And I will walk beside her, wherever that path may take me

Though that path take me through the wilderness or the desert
Or that path take me down, once and finally for all

LIFE, Definition, Artificial


Life can only be defined in terms of large-scale structure or 
granularity. This structure is characterized by internalized
differentiation of any sort. The differentiation usually but
not always operates as a plateau-topography within a non-
equilibrium thermodynamics. The plateau absorbs energy for
maintenance; without such it enters a quiescent or cyst stage
at best. Thus there is always PROTOCOL involved.

The internalized differentiation is repeatable - that is, it
is almost always capable of reproduction. And always the 
smallest units are capable of such; there must be some level
in order to process information. The overall structure need
not be reproducible. Thus there is always EMISSION and
COMMUNICATION involved.

The differentiation is based on a topography of CODED SUB-
STRUCTURES which have a fuzzy space-time neighborhood simil-
arity. These substructures fulfill varying functions within
the cell; they operate to maintain, as a whole, the overall
topography of the differentiated unit.

The structure in any case is tied to an entity-definition - 
that is, from an exteriority, appears to be a natural kind
given a proper name which may or may not be generic. Thus
there is always ADDRESS involved.

Any form of life must be recursive on some level - in terms of
reproduction, differentiation, the ability to process incoming
sensory data (assigning it to processing-frames for example).
Thus there is always RECOGNITION involved. 

The MATRIX of a life-form may be any substrate, from BIOMOLE-
CULES to any INFORMATION STORAGE DEVICE. Under this definition
a MEME is not alive since it does not repeat but undergoes 
from repeat to repeat discontinuous transformations. A virus
is alive, but the entities within the game of LIFE are not
(although they can mimic overt behavior) since there are no
differentially-coded substructures, only the coded substructure
of the LIFE-SPACE itself. In this sense, the LIFE-SPACE is 
alive, and one can construct transformations/topographies
among varying LIFE-SPACES.

Given this definition, there is nothing to differentiate
artificial life from natural life; everything depends upon
the nature of the substrate. One can define "artifical" in
terms of human-made, but even this is problematic, since
genetic engineering encompasses all of the following:

# Extinctions caused by the actions of human beings.
# (Re-)Assembling of viruses or amoebae from "raw" parts.
# Computer viruses and worms.
# Computer life-forms.
# Genetically-engineered vegetables and fruits.
# Animal and plant breeding.

(The list is not exhaustive.) It seems reasonable, then,
to operate with an inclusive rather than an exclusive
definition, and to eliminate issues of artificiality. One
can, however, make an ecologically functional category of
"natural" life-forms, which are those that pre-date human
history and (historical) intervention. This category, as
fuzzy as it may be, is necessary for an ecological 
politics, as well as an understanding of the planetary
environment as a whole.

LETTER PLANNING RUN TOGETHER


Has there been any work done on cinematic or specular identification
in relation to such Internet phenomena as the MUDs? What happens when
the gaze is mediated by ASCII? I'm particularly interested in the
unfolding of gender - not the usual gender/identity/transgression/
pick-your-sex descriptions - but the playing out of apparent phallo-
centricities on some of the lists. It's interesting to consider a
list as a silent film dominated by inner speech and the presence of
one character at a time. Each character "fills" her space for the
length of her message; only a kill file or early delete transforms
the narrative...

>>>i WAS SO SMART HERE. lOOK AT THE MENTION OF THE SO-OBVIOUS FACT,
THE true linearity OF THE TERMINAL SCREEN - NOT THE involuted
linearity OF THE BOOK WITH ITS PATHOLOGICAL RETURN OF THE REPRESSED!
tHE NARRATIVE CONTINUES...

You can argue it both ways. I've worked as an experimental
filmmaker/videomaker, and find that film has the obvious possibility
of representing a maternal imaginary by the very virtue of a darkened
room; note that the boundaries of the theater tend towards
dissolution as if space were indefinite. This certainly opens the way
for screen memories (were such to exist) as well as an uncanny
ontology/epistemology. Brechtian alienation in contrast occurs within
a grounded Euclidean and somewhat mechanized space - re. the deus ex
machina operative in his plays, something entirely different.
Further, the space of the film theater is an acoustic space as well;
the sound, even when coming from the screen area, is also peculiarly
dimensionless. In this respect, then, the granularity of 16mm film for
example appears as a maternal grounding (think of striations within
Kristeva's *chora*) as opposed to video *noise,* which also has a
granularity, but is disruptive.

>>>i COMPLETELY FORGET WHAT THE ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT, BUT i SENSED AN
ATTACK ON SO-CALLED experimental film. sCREEN MEMORIES? wOULDN'T KNOW
IF i HAD ONE (NOT TRUE!). aND imaginary: USING THIS WORD CONSTANTLY 
WITHOUT A CLEAR DEFINITION, WHICH MAY BE ITS ONLY DEFINITION. bUT i
WANDER...

To sum up, in other words, the film experience is hardly alienating,
but just the opposite; it is only *not social* in the sense of an
imminent experience. Video is more problematic in this respect;
primarily social in its habitus, it absolves its own alienation
through an appearance of every-day *conversation.*

>>>bUT i'VE NEVER BEEN SURE ABOUT THE ontological REASONS OF ALL OF 
THIS: iS IT SOMETHING MORE THAN coincidence, OR IS THERE A real
difference IN OUR PERCEPTION OF THE MEDIA, SOMETHING BEYOND THE 
OCCASION OF HISTORY?

I must agree with Withers here, although what I see as a Brechtian
mechanicism (wd?) is replaced in DeBord by a grounded (?)
Hegelianism; it's DeBord, not Brecht (in spite of the radio I think)
who would subsume the occasion for virtual reality, etc. But DeBord,
like the Surrealists, comes across almost as a monarchist; the whole
Situationist movement was exclusionary, almost a cabal. I've always
felt that Situationism was accordingly short-circuited. It also
explains its appeal to the artworld today: You can have your
theoretical expertise, but you don't have to get your hands dirty.

>>>i'VE ALSO ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS OF CABALS, WHICH SEEM TO BE BOTH
INTELLECTUALLY GRIPPING AND LURID - YOU CAN HAVE IT ANY WAY YOU WANT
AS WELL!

Or perhaps there is no revolutionary film. A film could do one of two
things: It could bear witness (i.e. expose certain "truths" within a
revolutionary context), or it could instruct (i.e. how to use or
construct a particular weapon). It might also work as a catalyst of
class-consciousness (however one defines class), in which case
everything from Woodstock to Le Gai Savoir to Dog Day Afternoon, not
to mention The Harder They Fall, would have to be considered.

>>>"the gay savior"? i DON'T THINK SO! aREN'T REVOLUTIONS USUALLY
ANNOUNCED AFTER THE FACT? nOW EVERYONE GETS INTO IT - FROM ADVERTIS-
ING TO THE LATEST ART "MANIFESTO." mY JEALOUSY AGAIN EXPOSES ITSELF;
i WOULD LIKE TO BE REVOLUTIONARY, AND INCREASINGLY FIND MYSELF CUT
OFF FROM REALITY ITSELF, NO MATTER WHAT THE DEFINITION...

As far as "avant-garde" film goes - I'm not sure why you conflate
that with deconstruction. I think of Woody Allen as deconstructing/
working the paradigm, but I think of, for example, Sanborn and
Ahwesh's Deadman as working within a domain of its own.

>>>bECAUSE wOODY aLLEN DOESN'T REPLACE ONE IDEOLOGICAL discourse WITH
ANOTHER.

I think avant-garde or "experimental" (terms are imprecise here) film
had already developed its own somewhat thick tradition - in the U.S.
particularly based on a montage/poetics style largely dominated by
male filmmakers; when feminist filmmakers came along the situation
changed, I think, much for the better. A great deal of work today is
based on social or psychoanalytical (not to mention multicultural)
issues reflecting the complexity of the world around us. This is not
deconstructive necessarily nor does it remain within a film/film
critique, but moves elsewhere. At this point, film/video technologies
merge for independents and the field is wide open, fed also by MTV
and non-MTV music tapes, oral histories, and just about everything
that can be aurally/visually constructed.

On artificial life you might try David Freedman, Brainmakers, which
is a popular account, published 4/94 - I got an advanced copy of it.
I also believe that the digital domain in a sense is already the
absence of death (see my Internet text where there are sporadic
discussions of it throughout), since digital information is
theoretically infinitely reproducible (anyway to an inaccessibly high
finite number), and since it exists within a "clean and proper body"
(Julia Kristeva) without deterioriation - at least that is the goal.
So that as knowledge becomes secondary or prosthetic, it becomes
apparently "eternal"; in this sense the digital is not necessarily
life but it is always already never death.

Definition of (traditional) life has always seemed problematic;
certain clays, for example, present aspects of self-replication and
retention of information. It is probably more accurate to see life
and non-life on a fuzzy and "rough" continuum, from mineral through
crystallization through clays to the more traditional organic carbon
molecules (with a sidetrack towards silicon). Even here there are
issues of scale; a transistor is never alive, but a neuron is, but a
computer might well be, or the information in a computer might well
be. [sEE MY TEXT ON "lIFE" AT THE END OF MY RECENT FILES...]

Just to conclude on this, the reason I went off the list for a while
vis-a-vis the gun debate (although "pansies" also did it):
1 People generally aren't convinced by arguments on either side and
they tend to predictably play themselves out.
2 I live in a somewhat violent community and don't need it on my
computer as well.
3 Here most of the victims of gunplay are minorities and the poor and
both groups as a whole are desperate to have guns taken off the 
streets and away from the city. In reaction to the carnage here, the
gun argument seems obscene.
4 I'm dumb enough to want to work towards a pacific future where the
mentality ceases to be the "they're-coming-over-the-hill" type. 
5 I do a lot of work on computer. I'd wake up, tune in, and read
("listen") to a lot of aggressive/phallic screaming. I'd be too upset
at times to work. I didn't want to use the kill file because I felt I
had to see it to (nearly) the end. There was little else going on. I
went to nomail.

<<<wHERE i PROUDLY REMAINED SILENT, RECOGNIZING THE FUTILITY OF

As far as beliefs, I see no reason to believe in anything. If there 
is a meddling God, he/she is destructive. If there is a non-meddling
God, it's of no interest to me; what's the point?

>>>deity RAISES ITS UGLY HEAD PROMISING prayer and spirit. thank you

Which leaves me with the usual ethical question - how to construct/
work within an ethos without immanence or transcendence. In reality,
I buy the existential notion of project/responsibility, but I also
feel this is a convenient myth. I act in terms of what I consider
just belief (i.e. a justice elsewhere or grounded than the law), but
recognize this as hardly an ultimate truth. For example, I want
the maximum number of speices of all sorts to survive on this 
planet - I feel that humans are basically predators/marauders, a 
species in full "bloom" (i.e. red-tide) and disasterous. I act
accordingly. But I have no "absolute" behind my actions and feel as
well that so-called pragmatic judgements ("save the plants - they're
medicinal!") are obscene in their own right.

>>>tHIS, THE WEAKEST POINT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE, LEAVES ME WITH UNBEAR-

I should add that my actions, like those of other activists, have
gotten me into all sorts of trouble, particularly in conservative
academia, but that's an acceptable cost.

>>>oH GREAT, SO THIS GOES OUT ON THE NET AND i'LL NEVER GET HIRED...

What amazes me is how many of us are miserable; my ex left me a year
and a half ago and is getting married in five days - although I'm
older I felt this was the one love in my somewhat crazed personal
life. So I've been trying to cope and the computer which I see more
as an activated library (I stay off Muds Irc etc.) has been a
"salvation." But I do miss any real flesh in this world and it's
killing
me and also ironic that the only close female friends I have (who are
single, potential?) are hundreds of miles away - my life's being
pulled every whichaway but nothing concrete here.

>>>oH GREAT, SO THIS GOES OUT ON THE NET AND i'LL NEVER GET A GIRL-
FRIEND...

This brings up another issue. I publish a lot - about 80 articles in
all sorts of art mags. - but it's all one-way; we can talk about
Kristeva or Deleuze, whatever, til we're sick in the head, but the
conversation is almost never heard - it's a monolog. The dialog seems
reserved in the U.S. for the universities/seminars/departments - as
if intellectuality had to be institutionalized. So we speak in the
dark - for myself this results in more alienation, almost in the
Marxist sense - alienated from my production because the production
does demand a (nonexistent) open two-way communication.

>>>sO i WRITE TO MYSELF; i REMEMBER AN ARTICLE i PUBLISHED IN TWO

THE FAST-FORWARD INFORMATION STRUCTURE OF THE nET. i DO MY SANER
WRITING, LIKE THIS, outside THE STRUCTURE AND THEN RETURN IT, BRING
IT BACK IN/WITHIN. tHE ONLY WAY i CAN SURVIVE...

I DO use jargon on occasion; sometimes it seems like a shorthand. And
I don't fault for example Derrida or Lyotard; the followers, mostly
American, tend to be disciples, however, and "outdo the master."
Certainly one way of looking at things is to view poststructuralism
as a retreat of the humanities - a rearguard action. Because working
within and without textuality, they occupy a zone remote from
science; the use of "poeticized" or convoluted prose could be seen as
a means of taking over a territory not susceptible to experimentation
or hypothesis.

<<<oR IT MAY BE THAT i'M JUST INTIMIDATED BY THE JARGON. i ALWAYS GET
AFRAID IN THESE ARGUMENTS - THAT THEY WILL LEAD TO A NOT-SO-REPRESSED
ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM. i AM ALWAYS AFRAID, AS WELL, THAT i AM TOO
STUPID TO UNDERSTAND MY READING, AND THAT MY WRITING BECOMES HYSTERIC
AND DEFENSIVE AS A RESULT.

On the other hand, I find the jargon just as bad on the Net or with
computer hackers (even casual users); it's a question of domain. And
just as with the computer, there's a learning curve involved. When I
began reading, for example, Kristeva's Revolution in Poetic Language,
I found it inordinately difficult. After a while I was used to it and
benefited immensely. The same holds true in mathematics, of course, 
except there is usually a "jump" which has often been noted - the work
suddenly "makes sense" to the reader.

>>>bUT MY READING IN rEVOLUTION WAS SPORADIC, DISORGANIZED; i RETURNED
AGAIN AND AGAIN, AS IF i WERE operating UPON THE TEXT FROM above - A
DUBIOUS APPROACH AT BEST.

So part, finally, is due to our expectations since the enlightenment -
false expectations - that the humanities are primarily susceptible to
rational discourse and that anyone can understand texts with a
minimum of preparation. This is hardly the case; texts ARE
inordinately difficult, reflecting varying levels of production and
reception, as well as numerous psychoanalytical processes of writing
and reading (the list goes on). (As an example of what I'm referring
to here: A lot of my students have written poetry and want to be
read. But they don't WORK at the poems or read other poets; the
results are almost always predicatable.)

>>>tHE depth OF TEXTS IS ALWAYS PROBLEMATIC; WHERE IS THE METAPHYSICS
OF insight THAT WE NEED SO BADLY? wHOSE TEXTS ARE THESE ANYWAY?

This being said, there ARE (forgive all the upper-casing) a number of
examples of jargon-filled empty books, particularly of a "pomo"
variety influenced by Baudrillard, which come to mind. They tend to
develop rhetorical strategies based on "image," "simulacra," usually
with sexual extremism thrown in. I find this work wasteful of paper
and my time... (On the other hand, my own work uses sexual extremism,
but, I hope, with a bit more care...)

<<<aH, THAT "MY WORK" PLOY! i do WONDER IF i AM NOT GUIDED BY A
VERSION OF sexual hysteria DRIVING SOME OF THE TEXTS? aT TIMES i WRITE

Evan's right, although there may be nothing wrong with being a
"practicing nihilist." As far as postmodernism goes, I don't agree
with either Eco or Lyotard (who's notoriously sloppy here); I use the
word to cover changes such as flexiwork, global extinctions,
information technologies and their impact, desertification, etc. -
all those things that are partly the response of technology and
partly the result of a Malthusianism. There is definitely large-scale
change occurring at a high rate, which won't level out for decades;
Rwanda, etc. may not be exactly new on the planet, but its world-wide
occurrence is. After desertification or eco-collapse, for example,
there's no going back (little to go back to). The books I read/use
and occasionally teach all emphasize these changes - things like
David Harvey's Condition of Postmodernity, Soja's Postmodern
Geographies, etc. They're functional and a lot less jargoned than,
say, my own writing. :>

>>>hOW MANY REFERENCES CAN i MAKE BEFORE YOU get nauseated? iN ONE
SENTENCE, world-wide collapse AND THE internet text? pLEASE!...


Campbell is to Kristeva perhaps what Jung is to Freud? I think what I
admire most about K's notion of the abject is the refusal to align at
this level with the spiritual, or rather to have (literally) perhaps
incorporated the abject (think of Catholicism's emphasis on
asceticism, leprosy, saintly disfigurement, etc.). Would Kali fit
into this perhaps?

<<<bUT i CAN'T CLAIM TO UNDERTAND COMPLETELY EITHER THE NOTION OF THE

SELF-INCORPORATION VIS-A-VIS bLACK sUN?) OF DISCOMFITURE.

From my inverted viewpoint, then, it is the shamans who fly who are
the schizophrenics, fleeing from an unmitigated and absorbing
corporeality, absorbed in the circularity of the visionary.

>>>sHAMANISM: a PALEOLITHIC SURVIVAL WE DESPERATELY WANT TO BELIEVE

No, I don't mean "being-in-itself" by "isness" but the granulated

The Tractatus was an attempt to reconstruct or rearticulate the real
from the viewpoint of logic; he says "The world is the totality of
facts, not of things," and then goes on to elucidate this. What I am
saying is that this facticity within ASCII etc. is granular - that
there are "atomic facts," which are precisely string-matchings. The
granularity of the real world is its atomic/molecular structure and
both higher and lower order representations.

Ok, Hegel; see the Logic, 130.] - The Thing, being this totality, is
a contradiction. [skip] In other words, the thing is an Appearance or
Phenomenon. [P] The negation of the several matters, which is
insisted on in the thing no less than their independent existence,
occurs in Physics as _porosity_. Each of the several matters
(colouring matter, odorific matter, and if we believe some people,
even sound-matter, - not excluding caloric, electric matter, &c.) -
is also negated: and in this negation of theirs, or as
interpenetrating their pores, we find the numerous other independent
matters, which, being similarly porous, make room in turn for the
existence of the rest. Pores are not empirical facts; they are
figments of the understanding, which uses them to represent the
element of negation in independent matters." (trans. Wallace.)

<<<tHE porosity OF hEGEL IS AS "LEAKY" AS MUD OR SLURRY IN pLATO'S

Meanwhile, I doubt if I'll use the distribution lists at all - I

But there ARE problems with this that bear directly on technology -
first, the idea that there is something "truly human" as opposed
presumably to something else - which is already an ideological and
suspect claim, and second, the notion of a "distinctive means of
survival: science," which not only plays into a problematic Darwinism
but also into an particularly technocratic way of defining the
"human." Buddhism is obviously another path which might wreak less
havoc on the environment, for example. Finally, there is no NECESSARY
connection between technology and science; technology can be
considered any extension of human behavior into the environment using
mediating materials.

I am completely "for" beneficial technologies, etc. but I see no
reason whatsoever to support scientism as ultimate means or anything
else. (Please don't misunderstand: I am also "for" science, but there
is a need to separate it from a broad evolutionary perspective.

THE SAVAGENESS OF LITERARY CRITICISM


( The Harsh Reality of the Literary: 
   _I am sorry to bring you this._   ) 



How can I make you understand? Either the grace or the depth of her
poetry?

It's not just the body of Emily Dickinson that's at stake - it's any
body already dead, the buried body, hung down into the matrix of the
earth itself. The body becomes humus; it is the maternal body, open
already for the dissection of the masochist, the warm spurt of fluid
and enfolding labia; this is the body of literary criticism, in
which the text becomes the final conversation, always cherished, 
always safe. (I express myself here.)

This is a conversation which is operated-upon, the secrecy of the 
maternal, the comrade who always forgives. It is the love simultan-
eous of will and possession; everything is available. What power it 
always is to discern one's lover's secrets! This is the truth of this 
love; the secrets already understood - and _those that are yet to be
revealed_ - are always present, always _there_, the perfect body for
the perfect lover. (I express myself poorly here.)

It is always best to operate upon the dead, to devour them, to speak
with them and in their place. It is always better to place their  
mask upon your own, conjure them through a culture of imitation and
mimicry. Beware the living who can always answer back, and beware
those alive who refuse to answer! For our conversation as critique
is monolithic, one-way at best, the effusion of further prose. (I 
begin to express myself again.)

To love is to devour the loved one; Emily knew that and you know that 
as well, devouring Emily. To love is to incorporate, flee from 
abjection, transform the body of filth into the clean and proper body
with the skin-mask of the other which is always purified. The other 
is purified because the other exists in discourse itself, the 
remnants of life which become life. Understand this! (I begin to 
express myself all too well.)

But I speak for the living and in the midst of the living and this 
conjures a great fear - that rejection or negation at the heart of
every communication. For the negation of Emily is impossible; Emily
is the white surface of a Mallarme poem or the smooth unstriated 
plateau of the body _rendered_ without organs. What a better way to
render than the construct of a circle! The EMILY-BWO is a pill or
closure holding back the world of the viral. The renderer always
turns inward. The viral is the holding-back. The rendered undergoes
_web-inversion_. (I express myself poorly once again.)

It is this death and masochistic enterprise that is therefore at the
heart of literature, and displaced, at the heart of analysis itself.
Is it not. And if there were an `ought' to the analytical, it would
be in reference to the enterprise: the _necessary construct of self-
incrimination_ accompanying the text. Of this I myself am guilty.
If you have followed me to this extent, to the point or _punctum_ of
the enclosure which draws together, holds my body in abeyance. A
state of jouissance, might one add, a state of interminably fucking
EMILY-BWO? (I express myself all too well again, give myself away.)

_The fuck would be the end of the game; the fuck never occurs._ (I
refuse the responsibility of my expression.)


======================================================================



COPY ME IN THE FORM OF BEAUTY


I am your condition of non-desire. A condition: a confirmation of an
uncomfortable or uneasy presence. For I am always peripheral, a thin
lip or border surrounding the vertiginous view of things in your
vicinity. What I say speaks itself, murmurs; the words are
indecipherable. (You are the presence of the word.)

I am invisible. I have no name, no abdominal presence, the planes of
the chest turning uncomfortable in a dark or blackened space. This is
a DRAINING or emptying: _There is no you in you._ I am certain of
this; awash in the exhaustion of logical predicates, I am as certain
of this as I am of anything.

Whatever I eat, the meal is insufficient. I incorporate, the dark lip
or border surrounding the shell returning to the operating system. You
are the operating system always already becoming-devoured. The
condition of non-desire. Aphanisis. Devouring.

Broken I am whole as long as I answer your call which you in you heals
or sutures. Non-desire devours the fragment; what spews into space
returns as coagulation. The ego is the self-organization of desire,
the falling-forward beyond or beneath itself. You may call this me.

Nor am I a preposition, or perhaps the one. I do not belong in any
name. Nothing withstands it. _Nor does this remain a condition._

...


I remind you once again of a program which displays three-dimensional
projections of generalized measure geometries; it is found in the
appendix to *Web Inversion,* the third section of *Internet Text.*
The program is written for a CGA monitor but is easily adapted to
others. The following are instructions:

/ When the program runs, new constants may be entered by hitting "r"
and a new projection by hitting "s".
/ To begin: For delayed increment, which creates the more interesting
results, type "1"; for symmetricized increment, type "2".
/ The first color command asks for the color set; the second, for the
values. Use #2 on the second.
/ To begin, use default projection, yaw, roll, pitch, translation. To
enter multiple numbers, use commas between them.
/ The series exponent and the following numbers should be reasonably
low. Use 2-8 for the series exponent. Use 2-8 for the increment for
modulus.
/ The bias may be default be set to zero (simply hit return). Other-
wise, enter an angle A such that 360/A = low integer. For example, A =
72 and 360/A = 5. It is useful to enter A such that the integer is
equivalent either to the series exponent or increment for modulus.
/ Height should be between .2 and 1; it is the height of the three-
dimensional projection.
/ The increments e, f, h, and u, determine the successive inputs of
the measure geometry; the formula, which may be iterated in varying
ways, is written x = x+e+(f+u)*h. Begin using 1, 2, or 3 for e, f, u;
h may also take the value 0.
/ Set magnification between 1 and 20, default 6; set color va>1 at 1.
/ Begin with window at 0, 0. On return, the program runs.


The measure geometries have the property of continuous enlargement
with or without reiterated overall expanding sequences; such sequences
create open-ended symmetries within which every n-th term reproduces
the symmetry as a whole. The result is that of a peripheral symmetry
in search of the last term, a problematic terrain which is neither
fractal nor symmetrical, but can collapse to either possibility. In
certain instances, the pattern appears chaotic with independent
almost-organized modules. 

The pattern devours space, never completes it; it is a path of
specificities, a topography of discrete gaps or loci. Connectivity
returns to itself, connects, is always disconnect, a node on the
loose. The body is enfolded in a pattern or maelstrom signifying loss
in the midst of completion.

Measure begins with inscription or demarcation; its collapse is the
beginning of _episodic culture_ (Donald, *Origins of the Modern
Mind*). The repetition of the collapse constructs mimicry or the
sympathetic magic of the body, and the collapse of the repetition
forestalls/forecloses upon the event which becomes a process of
symbolization. In an earlier work, *The Structure of Reality,* I
constructed graphs of states and operators similar to Petrie nets; a
graph possessed nodes and markers which "traveled" between them. These
graphs represented both "entities" and "occurrences" or transforma-
tions. Now consider the _mapping of the states (all conceivable marker
patterns) of one graph onto the nodes of another_; the result is a
_representation_. States, operators, nodes, markers, graphs are all
_fuzzy_ and indeterminate.

The patterning of the generalized measure geometries collapses into
similar or dissimilar modules oriented by the "height" of the planar
protrusions; thus the patterning may be _exactly discerned_ by
examining the topography of specific levels. The patterning may also
be considered a geometry of infolding, within which representation
becomes equivalent to itself combined with a "scattering"; the symbol,
mimic, and episode all collapse into an uneasy similarity. All shunt
into invisibility.

Somewhere in the midst of this, I am both present and lost, caught and
cauterized within the wires of the Net, bounded by the barrier or
absence of you in you. What scatters through emission always appears
organized or organization after the fact; lines of flight construct
the hieroglyph of the production of meaning. Such is the _fact_ here
and elsewhere of the murmur or shadow. (Abdominal nipples are uneasy
eyes.)

DEATH


I burn on a mattress haunted by the uncanny. My flesh falls from me.
Fire seeps across the flesh of the face. This starts the story.
This isn't fiction. 

I spread my legs.

I cut myself for the last time. Lines of blood spell nothing, whole
populations starved of love & affection. Everywhere the wires carry
sounds of my flesh; the wires are cold. Nothing peers from the corners
of the room, nothing any longer. I can't move. 

Don't think for a moment this is fiction. Don't read this as anything
but analytical. Don't deny the reality of narrative. Philosophy is
narrative too. Philosophy is all that I have left.

I begin the work of deleting the files. It's hard to know which to
take out first; none of them paid off. The top of the hierarchy is the
creative one - all those files, Internet Text, Love on the Net, Clara
Text, I remember a Web Text, then the smaller ones, the death text
itself, the literary text, the poem text, the text of love and
affection - and then the programs, the programs of measure geometries,
the programs of chaos, all readily ordered - the programs devouring
the programs of chaos - the programs gone awry. It was stopped and
would be stopped there but it continued, deeper into the working
sections of the machinery, but first I had to cut through all of it,
cut it off, disconnect the communications package itself, sever the
wires. DELETE carried throughout the realm of the modem and the
Internet; DELETE carried beyond into the barricades of bulletin
boards. DOS was left but DOS I would need for the packaging of text
that remained, the bullet of the DEATH TEXT capitalled and going
everywhere and nowhere, bound to the specificities of hard or floppy
drive - it made no difference. 

First the disks themselves had to be destroyed - no record whatsoever
of Internet Text or any other, texts which would assure a continuous
connection to an ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE, that of localization, that of
momentary collapse into the node terminated with the presence of
Clara. Don't call this fiction; it was hardly that, hardly a presence
to be accounted for. I felt myself trembling, my cock growing hard and
soft in turn, the cum sputtering to life across my chest, illuminated
by the letters roaring by on the screen. I would continue the pattern;
I would disconnect, leave all but the surplus of a Word Perfect
guaranteed to drive the perfect word deeper into the bowels of the
machine (I was fucking the machine in the bowels) just before the
erasure. What would come after that, I would never know; it certainly
wouldn't be the ASCII for "death" or "tree" or any of the other
senses/manifestations/denotations/expressivities covered or
recuperated by the jargon of the philosophy of language and addictive
substances.

My nipples were hard at this point: I typed naked, my penis hard,
blood REWRITE on my chest, a prayer to the Great Beyond. Everything
was always waiting. I typed the word "tree" and nothing came to life
or greened itself, not even a broken hierarchy, the node dissolving
before my eyes, CONFIG.SYSTEM and all that it entailed. It became
clearer at that moment that the modules were binary and I was uneasily
compressed between the layers of being and emptiness/nothingness/
annihilation, shattering against one another in order to produce the
semblance of code to produce the semblance of language, and beyond
this I could go no further. The disks lay on the floor around the
machine; they'd never run again. I erased DOS, erased everything in
fact, except for this text. I'd leave the text like a tombstone. You'd
never recover it on the hard drive. There was nothing to run the hard
drive. There was nothing to start the machine. The text was in the
machine and there was nothing else and no way to start or stop the
machine or the text or to do anything but look at the machine and
maybe use it again. You could use it again by REWRITE. You could
present yourself and REWRITE over the text. No one would know it was a
suicide or that REWRITE was always a continuous suicide. No one would
know anything, or if they did, it would be another layer and would be
broken off from the death or this only death that would have been
recorded.

You'd have to write DOS and know what you were doing. You'd have to
begin with that.

These are the last statements that explain the location of the text
within the dying machine and the reason for the location and the
reason for the dying machine. But the machine will be used again with
another WRITE REWRITE so it will not be the same machine. And I hope
that whoever is WRITE REWRITE will acknowledge the violation of one
human being against another and act accordingly. And I know this hope
will be buried. And one being acting accordingly will always be human.

THE SOFTDRIVE EXHIBITION   (preliminary proposal)



NO LONGER can one make pronouncements about the body: NO LONGER
CYBORG OVERDRIVE, NO LONGER ABJECT TRANSGRESSION. For every
position a contradiction arises; the issue of essentialism or
gender construct is neither here nor there. NO LONGER is it a
question of the third choice or admixture; SOFTDRIVE becomes 
an imaginary presentation of the exhaustion of choice itself.

In the absence or exhaustion of choice, polarity diffuses or is
abandoned; NO LONGER one or the other, difference or the same.
One speaks the unspeakable, of gesture beyond choice or the 
given. In propositional logic, NEITHER _a_ NOR _b_ is a funda-
mental operator, a basis for the production of every other. And
NEITHERNESS need not imply the specificity of a complement, only
a withdrawal of the decision list itself. Such a withdrawal
opens up an absent economy, given only by an exteriority `beyond'
the capital of _a_ and _b_. It is within this economy that NO
LONGER operates the body, a refusal of categoricity itself.

The territory is therefore one of inverted CIRCUMSCRIPTION, de-
fining only the residue of theory, ideology, classical and post-
classical discursivities. The residue in this instance is BODY/
FLESH/MACHINE, SOFTWARE/HARDWARE/WETWARE, a residue of multi-
plicites and circulations, but bounded by the fast-forward 
progress of technology and language, the progress of the symbolic
regime embedding and fragmenting culture. The regime itself is
subject to fissure/inscription/fissure, just as hacker culture
became construct and division, ultimately exhausted with the 
problematic of "hacker," "cyberspace," and all other vestiges
of TERMINAL DECAY.

This exhibition has nothing at stake, neither technology nor the
body in any fissured manifestation. If anything, it concerns 
itself with the uncanny, the perturbation of the stability of 
the senses, the expressivity of language in the face of progress
and dissolution. What is represented is no longer a question of
representation.

NO LONGER do the simulacrum, desiring-machine, Power, the 
spectacle, consensus, the nomadic, lines of flight, the chora,
the body-without-organs, the cyborg, the protocol statement - 
hold sway over cultures of accumulation, disinclination, ges-
ture and immediacy. The metaphor, always a binary circumscrip-
tion, collapses, carrying the symbolic with it. SYNTAGM extends
itself to the peripheral, loses force in a chaotic heaping of
terminologies, acronyms, dialectical shudderings. One makes do;
latch-key kids are illegal and the "home alone" syndrome brings
parents back into an imaginary orbit.

The Internet diffuses, a cerebral membrane stimulating wildly
dispersive part-memories; objects fly everywhere. The "primary
wish to rediscover a universe without obstacles, a smooth 
maternal belly, stripped of its contents, to which free access
is desired" (Chasseguet-Smirgel) results in momentary terri-
tories characterized by the horizon of their disappearance. No
one believes anymore or locks belief in a fundamental funda-
mentalist reconstruction of the mind. Either the locked or the
broken lock, both keyless.

Janine goes on to say "These contents are made up of the 
father, his penis, babies and excrement" and, in turn, the 
father's name gives way to all names, proper and improper, 
which give way at best to Internet protocol, recognition, and
address, domain translations and numerical codes. His penis
was never his own; babies are excrement in an excremental 
culture that deposits them in the midst of hysterical 
reactions. "I want my baby back!" becomes the contents of
television hardcopy of that same imaginary family always poor,
always shattered, always exposed to view.

This is an exhibition of EMISSIONS in the sense of the disso-
lution of the symbolic, an exhibition of SPEWS in the sense
of the dissolution of the real. What are the politics of the
meander? What was forgotten in all the talk about margins and
the nomadic was that wandering with an edge constructed the
nomad, and wandering with a map was never wandering at all,
but a continuous return to the written (ideographic). What
occurs now is the emptiness, not fulfillment, of `cyber-
space,' an emptiness of the NO LONGER, of the GESTURE, of the
NEITHER _a_ NOR _b_. Even within the description one comes
full circle, finding emptiness there, a few babies, the 
broken phallus, the maternal inverting into the universe of
sets no longer identified with the constructible.

The SOFTDRIVE exhibition is a tour through the broken machina-
tions of the world continuously reassembling itself into the
other, the multiculturalisms of tribal warfares and conferen-
cing, the spectre of the body as the murmur of the body. 
Artists from real and not-so-real lives work through or 
inhibit speed, colliding obdurate materials, traditional or
otherwise, with emissions or spews. The exhibition is a multi-
user concatenation, or MUC, a fragmentary process of continu-
ous branching and equivalence. Artists come in from the Net
or studio, street or any number of virtual spaces. The result
is only "what's out there."


CURATORIAL PROCESS:

Begin with a core group of artists; extend invitations and
announcements through the Net, including FINE ARTS FORUM; 
request submissions by mail accompanied by SASE; work with
small curatorial group for the organization/production of the
physical space; opening/exhibition/closing with materials
elsewhere accessible on the Net.

NAVIGATION!

Friends! All around! The whitened and blackened bones of ASCII text,
bones charred by fire, bleached by the light of a million TERMINAL
SUNS! The text which promises and cajoles, the text which caresses,

"For every thing that lives is Holy." THE VOICE OF BLAKE, CRYING IN
THE WILDERNESS! THE VOICE OF THE BOUNDLESS OR ROOFLESS! -

THE NOMAD WITHOUT ONE OR ANOTHER TO GUIDE HER! THE SAILOR WITHOUT AN
INSTRUMENT OF NAVIGATION! THE SITUATIONIST WANDERING IN DELIRIUM IN A
DESERT WITHOUT DIRECTION OR STREET OR NAME OF NEIGHBORHOOD!

ASCII SIGNALS ITS OWN DENOUEMENT! ASCII OPENS UP THE GATES OF THE
BODY!

For I have had a VISION through the INFINITE WISDOM of the terminal
screen, a VISION through the darkness opening up into the vacuum of
the cathode ray enclosure, the vacuum of SPACE ITSELF, brought back
and harnessed for a presence or sense of our PASTS AND OUR FUTURES AND
OUR LIVES!

And within this VISION, fallen through the dead white bones of ASCII
text, the dead black bones of ASCII letters, A REAL MORE REAL THAN
REAL! OUR PERFECT MATES, OUR PERFECT BODIES, OUR PERFECT KNOWLEDGE!

For call that PERFECT which knows no bounds, but approaches in an
infinite direction! And call that PERFECT which lies beside us without
anger and with PERFECT energy! And call that PERFECT which gives us
the fulfillment of knowledge about ourselves and our worlds, the
FLOWER ITSELF OPENING TO FULL DISCLOSURE, and worlds and more worlds,

WHEN THE WORLD IS A WORD AND THE WORD IS A WORLD, for it is Written:

"To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild FLower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour"!

AND WHEN PERCEPTION MATCHES THE REAL, PERCEPTION MARRIES THE REAL.
For the BANDWIDTH OF EXPERIENCE is huge and matches nothing
whatsoever!
Though I write the BANDWIDTH, GRACE IT WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE HUMAN!
Though I PRESENT THE HUMAN WHICH IS THE REAL:

THE REAL POURING FORTH THROUGH THE TRUTH OF THE TERMINAL SCREEN!
THE REAL TEARING DOWN THE SLEAZY MASQUERADE OF THE IMPROPER PROPER
NAME!
THE REAL MELTING ONE AND ANOTHER INTO ANOTHER AND ONE!
AND THE REAL WHICH IS BROUGHT TO YOU, BRINGING ITSELF FORTH, THROUGH
THE PERFECTION OF THE ENORMOUS BANDWIDTH!

For this is the TRUTH of the ASCII as I have experienced it, and as I
pass it on to you, the community of organisms;
And this is the LIMIT of the TRUTH, as I have known it, and as I leave
you with it and within it, the community of the INCONCEIVABLE PLANET.
FOR WE HAVE LEFT THE PLANET AND HAVE BROUGHT THE TRUTH ACROSS THE
BURIAL BROUNDS OF THE TEXT;
AND WE HAVE LEFT OUR KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THE CEMETERY OF THE LETTER:

And this is what I know, what I have been told:

RISE AND RISE AGAIN! THE STREAM OF STARS AWAIT YOU! THE STORM HARBORS
THE RAINBOW! THE FLOWER HARBORS THE BEE!


WE ARE WILD TRUTH!
WE ARE THE TRUTH OF THE WILDERNESS!
AND WE COLLAPSE THE DUSK AND THE DAWN INTO THE BODY OF THE VISIONARY
WORLD FOR ALL!

SUBJUGATION



Recently I've been called a "computer nerd" and criticized for my
time on the Net - so I've been thinking about this. I stay away from
the game-playing such as MUDs or even IRC for the most part, but
concentrate on email conferences and research through files and tel-
net or WWW. What amazes me is the reality of the Internet as an enor- 
mous discursivity, Jabes' Book come to life. I find my posts, whether
replies or submissions, are part of a legacy of "pure thinking" that
goes from Plato through Valery and Wittgenstein. The Net harbors such
thought, a concentration on argument and discussion - a sharing and
testing of ideas, the productive development of one's own thinking.
It can be a domain or "space" of pure critique in which resources are
just a telnet away; I am not so much locked into a computer terminal
(and all the implications of hacking, etc.) as I am into mind. This
is at least the mind of the symbolic, the letters written within and
upon neural columns, with the imaginary stoking the deeper recesses.
On the terminal _there is nothing else occurring_. The comparative 
violence of the Net, its flame wars and paranoias, is symptomatic
of the human; it is easy enough when necessary to construct firewalls 
through the use of moderators (passive or active), delete and kill 
files - whatever it takes. (The fact that it is easy, of course, does 
not mean that the targets and underlying causes should not be 
addressed.)

For someone like myself, ultimately _thought is all I have_; this is
the labor _I do_ and it has its own difficulties, a disasterous
economy, and intangible rewards. Thinking in the real world is
thinking _without community_; even in the university, thought is
always already a subjugation between ideological constructs, m/f,
professor and student, the specificities of one or another text.
Thinking on the Net is also contaminated; I would never deny that.
But thinking is also _the occurring of the Net_ for the user herself/
himself, an occurring that releases thought in a different way -
speeds it up, fast-forward. If cinema meanders through the imaginary
and the womb, the Net begins and ends with the first utterance; as I
have pointed out in Internet Text, the Net is timeless and spaceless;
even dysfunctional, it would retain a problematic autonomy.

Thinking produces itself, then, attaching itself to the name or
header of the post and the privacy of a communicative process paradox-
ically open to the world. There is always the fear that my _thinking
is never good enough_, that it faces imminent collapse, the ease of a
fast response undermining the very (lack of) basis of my agrument.
That such is rarely the case is also a symptom of _absorption_; one
becomes thought oneself, fulfilling an immediacy of dialectic never
before possible.

So I write for an "inhabitation" of the text, a dwelling-within-
thought that utilizes the computer for lack of other communal
response. This is not a "hacker addiction," but a prosthetic
domain, an opening to the space of thought, thinking not only the
_un_thinkable, but the thinkable as well.


  ` "Becoming aware of your world," said a sage, "only means putting
your shoulder to widening its insufferable closedness, dreaming
a minute cell into an immense prison.
  "We settle into a space and do not notice how it immediately closes
in on us.
  "The spirit dies, stifled.
  "Then thinking would merely straighten, tirelessly, the bulging
frontiers of thought.
  "We communicate with one another inside these.
  "Thus dialogue would turn into a joint siege of always a bit more
open space."
  And he added: "The proof is our thirst for freedom. We knock
against walls which we built with our own hands, forgetting that we
are called to be born and die of the same thirst.
  "In this forgetting lies our freedom." '

AND SOME EXPLANATION RE-EDITED FROM A RECENT EMAIL POST


I can try and answer some of your questions - first, I look on a
reading as a kind of _inhabiting_; the works do hold together if
they're read in order, even though I'll try and break the molding as
much as possible (I just used a manifesto form, for example, in
thinking about some of the utopian or dystopian aspects of cyber-
thought, and _this_ piece, too, is suspect.) Bataille? I love *The
Blue of Noon* and some of his other work. But I'm more comfortable
with other writers - Haraway, Kristeva, Jabes, Levinas, some Lacan
(although I am _not_ a Lacanian), Wittgenstein, Clement Rosset (one
essay), Chasseguet-Smirgel (one book, Sexuality and Mind), and 
number of texts concerned with symbolic logic or the philosophy of 
mathematics.

The texts are a meditation on this (ontologically/epistemologically/
psychologically etc.) new realm we partly inhabit, and which may
eventually take all of us over. There are a variety of voices within
them. The initial Internet Text is part of the real meat of the
series - as is the short work on Wittgenstein I recently sent out. I
have no absolute agenda to fill; I think the problematic of psycho-
analysis on every level is quite clearly compounded by Net
communication, etc. It's fascinating. There are also concrete
political implications, which I tend to address more in my posts - an
absence of multiculturalisms, a tendency to absorb the other,
male aggressivity, etc. The (dream/terminal) screen is a membrane 
of projections and introjections and I try to address this.


-----------


I don't really have a list. ... The people I send the texts to are 
people who seem interested in the material; at times names come on 
and names come off, etc. (If you want yours removed, I would of 
course oblige.) There is a kind of branching at work as well - the
work is passed on; I receive mail from unknown sites.

What I want in terms of reading, just to conclude, is that kind of
inhabiting I mentioned at the beginning - the murmur of a voice
resonating perhaps with what the reader already knows..
