
Lovers

I am fifty-two; I can't even write the number properly in Arabic num-
erals, discovered long before I was born. I remember the arrival of the
hydrogen bomb, keeping a photograph of the first explosion near my bed,
something to tell me stories; it still does. What I remember is always 
of no consequence; I will die carrying memories, I will carry nothing. 
But what I will carry, like the plague or permanent virus, is this:

That I have had the last of my lovers. I could lie upon the Net, pass
myself off as a twenty-four-year-old cock named Kent, but in reality, 
I'm dead, gone into ashes. I make love hard and constant, better than
most, dream of a solid relationship, a partner for the next twenty years
or so. But the real intrudes like the heavy lid of a sky, my neuroses,
my intensities, edginess, and everyone wants what's safe now, don't 
they, even safe pain, whatever. I'm not safe, even to myself, don't hope
to live that much longer, this world's not worth it.

But I could lie upon the Net, pass myself off, this temptation to be a
twenty-four-year-old cunt, hard for the asking of it, but in reality, 
there's not much reality. I have already been discarded, but the truth
is that it's an _always already discarded,_ from the moment of birth all
the way through the mistakes, to the moment of death. Nothing but the
seepage of this link from one to another painful day, something they
would churn over on alt.angst or reassure me on some other alt.talk.show
made up just for the occasion.

You are all my lovers, and none of you are my lovers. My attempt at 
transformation from wire to real-life failed miserably, always already
after the fact, and wasn't that predictable? My last lover was 42, was
24, was 27 and I was forty-nine. My last lover was dark-haired, blond,
and wasn't that predictable? I am everyone's mentor, no one's mentor,
I am a shell, a fake, organs devouring organs from within, nothing in-
trinsic in this body, nothing believed, believing, believable. My last
lover would be my first lover, beyond that a dark impenetrable plateau
receding into indeterminate distance. I would return there, fall there,
fall over there, fall over the cliff of the past, die, fool, die.

Amazed that any Net relationships succeed, even for the five minutes of
life it might take a bacterium to divide. My work plunges me into my
work; without that I'd be lost. I used to imagine myself in prison, 
learned to think/hold this vile mind together, gaming to stay alive. 
Now it seems pointess; if I've learned anything even later, it's that
intention too dissolves. At 52, I'm dead.

For my Secret Love

The screen stares at me. What does it say.
It says little Alan wants to come out and play. 
It says you haunt me. It says I am prey.
The flower is green. The stem too. Slay
The contrite edges, the glass. Stay
The growth of the grass. Your footsteps may
Furrow or cleft so that I follow, at bay
What Whitman meant, electric body a day
Turned from the night. I am not an easy lay
But for you at lunar edge I howl, bray
At moon, from terminal depression turned away,
My arms akimbo, my legs a split or splay,
My voice a neigh upon the sward or ley.
This is an image of a world gone clear and grey,
Gone queer or gay, gone straight or bent, a ray
Turned as well from crazed and lunar night? Nay,
The two of us entwined, and happy? Yay!,
Of course we are! While sun shines, making hay
And overhead amidst the blue, a jay
Floats by the sky. It's a lovely time to pray
Each of us to us, and in both senses, "fey":
Whimsical, disordered, near-death body-flay,
Towards beautiful food for us, perhaps cray-
Fish or not. We found it sleeping by the quay!
Delightedly, each offered the other to pay
For this dark morsel launched upon the tray
For lunch, now happily returned to sea, a stray
Just like ourselves! We're now so far, hooray!
From terrors, pains, ennui, the sickness of decay 
Remains behind. I call you by your true name, Hey!
You laugh, toss back to me the pearlescent spray
I left with you so long ago. You'll bless and spay
Me and I'll die, whistling tensely in the clay,
And knowing you lead or follow, this dark way
Where we have loved upon deserted paths, ay
Dark with memories, black stems no God can fray,
Repay, betray, today.

Eyes Closed and Speaking -x-x-
  

Towards the end of Merlin's prophecy, recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth, 
we read:

"A grievous mortality shall sweep away the people, and the walls of 
cities shall be made desolate. There shall be given for a remedy the city 
of Claudius, which shall interpose the nurse of the scourger. For she 
shall bear a dose of medicine, and in a short time the island shall be 
restored. Then shall two successively sway the sceptre, whom a horned 
dragon shall serve. One shall come in armour, and shall ride upon a flying 
serpent. He shall sit upon his back with his naked body, and cast his 
right hand upon his tail. With his cry shall the seas be moved, and he 
shall strike terror into the second. The second therefore shall enter 
into the confederacy with the lion; but a quarrel happening, they shall 
encounter one another. They shall distress one another, but the courage 
of the beast shall gain the advantage.

Then shall one come with a drum, and appease the rage of the lion. 
Therefore shall the people of the kingdom be at peace, and provoke the
lion to a dose of physic. In his established seat he shall adjust the
weights, but shall stretch out his hands into Albania. For which reason
the northern provinces shall be grieved, and open the gates of the
temples. The sign-bearing wolf shall lead his troops, and surround
Cornwall with his tail. He shall be opposed by a soldier in a chariot, who
shall transform that people into a boar. The boar shall therefore ravage
the provinces, but shall hide his head in the depth of Severn. A man shall
embrace a lion in wine, and the dazzling brightness of gold shall blind
the eyes of beholders. Silver shall whiten in the circumferance, and
torment several wine presses. Men shall be drunk with wine, and,
regardless of heaven, shall be intent upon the earth. From them shall the
stars turn away their faces, and confound their usual course. Corn will
wither at their malign aspects; and there shall fall no dew from heaven. 

The roots and branches will change their places, and the novelty of the 
thing shall pass for a miracle. The brightness of the sun shall fade at 
the amber of Mercury, and horror shall seize the beholders. Stilbon of 
Arcadia shall change his shield; the helmet of Mars shall call Venus. The 
helmet of Mars shall make a shadow; and the rage of Mercury pass his 
bounds. Iron Orion shall unsheath his sword: the marine Phoebus shall 
torment the clouds; Jupiter shall go out of his lawful paths; and Venus 
forsake her stated lines."

Ending with: "The seas shall rise up in the twinkling of an eye, and the 
dust of the ancients shall be restored. The winds shall fight together 
with a dreadful blast, and their sound shall reach the stars."

Apparently Merlin "caused in all that were present an admiration at the 
ambiguity of his expressions." But Vortigern wanted more, and heard his 
own fate recited.

Clara Hielo Internet, back from the northern state of Chihuahua, reports
on Merlin's use of compressed narrative, so typical of oracular speech; 
beyond that, she notes, the symbols clash, drag one another into the
clearing: where there is nothing but room, there is no room at all. Men
and women closed their eyes and Venus or Mars played upon their eyelids; 
hysterically affected, they twisted under the onslaught of mute metaphor -
a language conjured, sloughed out of the world's things, the first, stum-
bling over itself, the assignment of occlusions to desperate or inimical
measures. 

The measure of the eyelid is the measure of the cave or cyberspace, the
world always already fallen when it is told so. The _cartoon_ is the 
sign of the world, the sign's horizon, unreachable debris. The cartoon is 
the world gone awry in the face of the symbol; the oracle was the first 
cartoon, which still (Mickey Mouse) carries something (Donald Duck) 
prophetic (Krazy Kat) about it. This is why cartoons anger us, draw us 
within their stumbled power. This is why clowns, clawing the world apart, 
beg us to kill them.

Merlin Ties the Threads Together -o-o-


From Geoffrey of Monmouth again:

"Upon this the messengers hastened to the governor of the city and ordered 
him, in the king's name, to send Merlin and his mother to the king. As 
soon as the governor understood the occasion of their message, he readily 
obeyed the order, and sent them to Vortigern to complete his design. When 
they were introduced into the king's presence, he received the mother in 
a very respectful manner, on account of her noble birth; and began to 
inquire of her by what man she had conceived.

"'My sovereign lord,' said she, 'by the life of your soul and mine, I 
know nobody that begot him of me. Only this I know, that as I was once 
with my companions in our chambers, there appeared to me a person in the 
shape of a most beautiful young man, who often embraced me eagerly in his 
arms and kissed me; and when he had stayed a little time, he suddenly 
vanished out of my sight. But many times after this he would talk with me 
when I sat alone, without making any visible appearance. When he had a 
long time haunted me in this manner, he at last lay with me several times 
in the shape of a man, and left me with child. And I do affirm to you, my 
sovereign lord, that excepting that young man, I know no body that begot 
him of me.'"

Later, Maugantius explains: "'In the books of our philosophers, and in a 
great many histories, I have found that several men have had the like 
original. For, as Apuleius informs us in his book concerning the Demon of 
Socrates, between the moon and th earth inhabit those spirits, which we 
will call incubuses. These are of the nature partly of men, and partly of 
angels, and whenever they please assume human shapes, and lie with women. 
Perhaps one of them appeared to this woman, and begot that young man of 
her.'"

Now this all occurs mythologically around c.e. 477, but who are we to 
question the authenticity of what so clearly constitutes a cyber-romance 
with attendant consequences? As the telecommunications membrane grows 
across the planet, specters appear (re. Derrida), disappear, repeat them- 
selves; they carry desire with them, our own reflected through the 
matrix. It is ourselves we see in the screen, our projections sloughed 
into cartoon/clown cyberspace (see previous post), entangled in the 
mythos of Honey, Tiffany, Clara Hielo Internet. We bring Merlin into 
being through the year c.e. 477, our neighbor. Every year is our neighbor 
- every year entwines us around its history, which is of our making. What 
is clear in this account, that the "young man" had a modem.

The Oracular, Death and Mourning in Cyberspace, Veronica of Truth


The speaking of it brings the body close to the things of the earth: It
starts and stops with the body. It is never a reproduction, but a touch
of yarrow-sticks: "Woe to the red dragon, for his banishment hasteneth 
on. His lurking holes shall be siezed (sic) by the white dragon, which 
signifies the Saxons whom you invited over; but the red denotes the 
British nation, which shall be oppressed by the white. Therefore shall 
its mountains be levelled as the valleys, and the rivers of the valleys 
shall run with blood." (Beginning of Merlin's Prophecy in Geoffrey of 
Monmouth.)

The poetic starts and stops with the body; the final run of language is 
to: Get the _things out of it_!

...

If prophecy is already the feed-forward of earth, the will-have-been, 
then, caught within its skein, the act of mourning for one's own death 
co-exists with the project of speech itself. I mourn the past of my own 
death which is brought to me. In prophecy, the future has never been a 
future; more than an announcement, it forecloses with the expulsion of 
the body's speech.

"The exercise of religion shall be destroyed, and churches be laid open to
ruin. At last the oppressed shall prevail, and oppose the cruelty of
foreigners. For a boar of Cornwall shall give his assistance, and trample
their necks under his feet." Merlin's terms become those of the antiquar-
ian, countermanding the terms in which they are stated. A period of incom-
prehensible longing sets in, one which sallies forth through Tennyson,
Dungeons and Dragons, MUDs and MOOs, into every corner of cyberspace, Doom
and doomed, where the voice that whispers is our own. 

For it is the _prophetic_ that cybermind hears, the always already fragile
disappearance of language, our own mortality in the sad and languorous
fate of our posts. Each one prophesizes, becomes and represents, _expendi-
ture,_ a fiscal economy based on an inert impossible substance existing
only within the future recipient. With every post, the death of the writer
/death of the reader is announced as a _curlicue_ or diacritical sign, and
someday there will be nothing but silence in the midst of broken letters.
("In question is a spectralizing disincarnation. Apparition of the bodi-
less body of money: not the lifeless body or the cadaver, but a life
without personal life or individual property." Derrida, Specters of Marx.)

Merlin knew all of that always already, the vagaries of his words encom-
passing the world and its uneasy abutment of objects difficult to
swallow. But Merlin has disappeared, like ourselves and our words, and
this is nothing more than the _matter_ of the shifting of proper names.
... "Menevia shall put on the pall of the City of Legions, and a preacher
of Ireland shall be dumb on account of an infant growing in the womb. It
shall reign a shower of blood, and a raging famine shall afflict mankind." 
... "There shall be a most grievous punishment of men, that the natives 
may be restored."

The restoration appears through the _agency_ of Search-Engine Veronica,* 
shape-riding the gophers into the antagonisms of sexuality, allusion, and 
death. In bull-fighting, "La Veronica": "The Veronicas are always used 
_for the purpose of calculating the bull's action._ The veronica executed 
holding the Cape in both hands and bringing the bull to charge close to 
his body. It is one of the oldest movements of the bull-fight. It can be 
given with the feet close together or slightly separated; the latter is 
called "with the open compass." (sic, and "con el compas abierto" - 
italics mine.) And in bull-fighting, "Media Veronica," half Veronica: 
"The groups of veronicas performed by the matador are usually ended with 
a half veronica; it is similar in all to the veronica except in its final 
tempo in which the hand that guides the bull in his way out, after the 
charge, gets near the body almost touching the other hand, thus closing 
the cape which is no longer ready for another veronica." (sic) ("Una 
Corrida de Toros con fragicas a colores.")

The interplay/dance of the Veronica is the calculation of substance/bull
and sign/cape, or the torsion between matador/cape/bull, the _calculation_
of the sign in the face of death, the sign already the sign of mourning,
the cancellation of the future. The Veronica has the auspices of the
portent, the calculation of the chaotic future. The sign outlasts the bull
just as signifier and transfiguration outlast death itself. One last cry 
from the wounded Merlin: "The fox of Kaerdubalem shall take revenge on 
the lion, and destroy him entirely with her teeth. She shall be 
encompassed by the adder of Lincoln, who with a horrible hiss shall give 
notice of his presence to a multitude of dragons. Then shall the dragons 
encounter, and tear one another to pieces. The winged shall oppress that 
which wants wings, and fasten its claws into the poisonous cheeks. Others 
shall come into the quarrel, and kill one another. A fifth shall succeed 
those that are slain, and by various strategems shall destroy the rest.

"He shall get upon the back of one with his sword, and sever his head 
from his body. Then throwing off his garment, he shall get upon another, 
and put his right and left hand upon his tail. Thus being naked shall he 
overcome him, whom when clothed he was not able to deal with."

bases.

Here's Some Really Great Stuff!!!!!!


Aphorisms from Friedrich Schlegel, translated by Ernst Behler and Roman 
Struc (in Dialogue on Poetry and Literary Aphorisms) \my commentary 
corraled\

(From the Lyceum 1797)

54. There are writers in Germany who drink the Absolute like water, and
there are books in which even the dogs make references to the Infinite.
\The absolute as signifier, token, absorption, nothing more! incredible
that GOD becomes a word! Wow!\

(From the Athenaeum 1798)

24. Many works of the ancients have become fragments. Many works of the 
moderns are fragments at the time of their origin.
\Merlin constructs the fragment within the whole; Schlegel constructs the 
whole within the fragment! German Romanticism begins the fragment under- 
mining Hegel before _its_ time!!\

42. Good drama must be drastic.
\Yes, Heiner Muller, John Young, Karen Finley, what the times call for!! 
This is so exciting!!!!\

77. A dialogue is a chain or a wreath of aphorisms. A correspondence is a
dialogue on an enlarged scale, and memorabilia are a system of aphorisms.
As yet there is nothing which is aphoristic in matter and form, altogeth-
er subjective and individual, simultaneously completely objective, and a
necessary part in the system of all sciences. 
\Unless you can combine the protocol with the post, the machinic with the
reception, feeling the wires with the wires themselves!! How I love the 
wires warped around my naked supine body! Wrapped in chains, a wreath 
crowning each and every limb!!! You gotta love it!\

(From Ideas, 1799-1800)

20. An artist is he for whom the goal and center of life is to form his
mind.
\O how I struggle over this one! Forgive the "he/his" for era, but O how
otherwise true! Alas, my Mind grows to fill the Fragmentary Real, coming
like Drastic Debris towards you as Imminent and Immanent! I am left
speechless, O alas!\

Texts


Receiving _this_ space of reading which is always open, penetrated, a
perforated space splayed for reply or deletion and therefore fragile, the
space of a membrane, torn-space, there is always _this_ space on the other
end/other hand, space of writing which is foreclosed, null after sending,
re-articulated in archive or hard-copy. This project which presses against
my limbs, a discursive formation, is rooted in the begin- ning of the
Internet Text, which is rooted at an unknown measure; I have no record of
chronology and the start of distribution, before cybermind and fiction-
of-philosophy, possessing only the text's entirety, all fourteen files
1-14, beginning now a second alphabetic set with extended subject matter.

If you have followed me so far or are tired of losing me, turning around
by the birch (denuded by illness as the species slowly disappears), to
retrace the path where the roots begin, you might want to once again
examine those sequences of the initial text as prove relevant or summary,
in particular the introduction and vocabularies or outlines scattered
among the whole. It is in these sections that notions of address, protocol,
recognition, spew, emission, uncanny, imaginary, web inversion, violation
fabric, indexical embodiment, rewrite, and so forth are developed;  and it
is these sections which foreground the current texts, which cannot repeat
what has gone before, but exist as a twisted birch dying by the side of
the path, without the nourishment already given. 

The following sections of the files are useful for any revival, and may 
be retrieved through http://www.uio.no/~mwatz/cybermind/texts/sondheim.html

Oh momma, he is the most beautiful boy you could ever hope to meet. His 
hair is so dark and he seems so strong. And he has a wild look in his 
eyes, but I know he will work hard, momma, because he always has. And you 
know, he is good to me, not like the others. He is always good to me 
brings me presents, why just the other day he brought me flowers and a 
small cake, momma, like the kind the bakery has around the corner. And he 
is going to finish school this fall and set out on his own, and oh I want 
to go with him so badly. He is so beautiful, you would not believe how 
the other girls look at him. He is the smartest boy in the world, and I 
know you will think so to, he is as smart as poppa, and he's so young, 
and he's mine, he's mine! I love him so!

Oh Johnny, she is so wonderful. I can't believe how she looks at me, how 
her eyes say everything in the world and she has them just for me. And 
she has such large breasts, she looks incredible in a sweater, and she 
presses them up against me. I lose my breath when she does this, I can't 
believe how lucky I am. She is so beautiful that everyone turns around on 
the street and when we walk together, I'm so proud. And she's smart, too, 
smarter than anyone I've ever met, the smartest person in the world. I 
know the two of us will go far, there's nothing like it in the world, oh 
I can hardly talk. And her legs are strong too, she walks all the time, 
her hair is long and black just like stars were in it. Every night I 
dream of her, and she's with me night and day. I can't believe she's 
mine, that she has eyes for me alone, that she's really mine! I love her 
so much!

Oracle, Prophecy, Heterogeneity, Writing


In searching through the two volumes of Pritchard's The Ancient Near East,
An Anthology of Texts and Pictures, for prophetic literature, I stumbled
across the "Akkadian Observations on Life," A Pessimistic Dialogue between
Master and Servant, trans. Pfeiffer, some of which bears quoting, particu-
larly in relation to writing, prophecy, and space: 

`(I) ["Servant,] obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. ["Bring me at once the] 
chariot, hitch it up. I will ride to the palace." [Ride, my lord, ride! 
All your wishes] will be realized for you. The [king] will be gracious to 
you. ["No, servant,] I shall not ride [to] the palace." [Do not ride], my 
lord, do not ride. [To a place...] he will send you. [_In a land which_] 
you know [not] he will let you be captured. [Day and] night he will let 
you see trouble.'

`(V)... "I will not build a house." You will not build it.'

`(VII) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "I intend to start a 
rebellion." Do (it), my lord, [do (it)]. If you do not start a rebellion 
what becomes of your clay? Who will give you (something) to fill your 
stomach? "No, servant, I shall not do something violent." [Do (it) not, 
my lord, do (it) not.] The man, doing something violent is killed or 
[_ill-treated_], or he is maimed, or captured, or cast into prison.

(VIII) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord yes. "A woman will I love." Yes, 
love, my lord, love. The man who loves a woman forgets pain and trouble. 
"No, servant, a woman I shall not love." [Do not love,] my lord, do not 
[love]. Woman is a well, woman is an iron dagger - a sharp one! - which 
cuts a man's neck.

(IX) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "Bring me at once water for 
my hands, and give it to me; i will offer a sacrifice to my god." Offer, 
my lord, offer. A man offering sacrifice to his god is happy, loan upon 
loan he makes. "No, servant, a sacrifice to my god will I not offer." Do 
not offer (it), my lord, do not offer (it). You may teach a god to trot 
after you like a dog when he requires of you, (saying), "Celebrate) my 
ritual" or "do not inquire (by requesting an oracle)" or anything else.'

`(XI) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "I will do something helpful
for my country." Do (it), my lord, do (it). The man who does something
helpful for his country, - his helpful deed is placed in the bowl of
Marduk. "No, servant, I will not do something helpful for my country." Do
it not, my lord, do it not. Climb the mounds of ancient ruins and walk
about: look at the skulls of late and early (men); who (among them) is an
evildoer, who a public benefactor? 

(XII) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "Now, what is good? To break
my neck, your neck, throw (both) into the river - (that) is good." Who is
tall enough to ascend to heaven? Who is broad enough to embrace the
earth?" "No, servant, I shall kill you and send you ahead of me." (Then)
would my lord (wish to) live even three days after me? (Colophon) Written
according to the original and collated.'

(2334-2279 b.c.e.)

Hielo Internet not a name mentioned. The lid on the cambrian catastrophic
bends planetary rubble nowhere but petrifies a tear formed from the
tiniest thing as space distends the body, breasts blows them apart.
Swallow my seed before another web crawls its way across the glass. Pull
my nipples into filaments gone across Centaurus Cluster Virgo Cluster gone
towards Great Attractor. Lost in Lyman forest Virgil would kill himself,
Dante, Florence, Italy, Europe, each and every continent; lost in Lyman
forest time slices and reverses the eye. Look at myself don't like what I
see, check out 3400-3700 Angstroms for the remnants of truth. The farthest
the universe goes is a mark that gnaws past the plate or ccd, erodes the
sign just when signifying, Kantian sublime disappearing in magma turned
plasma, 400 neutrinos to the cubic centimenter but I ask you only one
nucleon to the cubic meter? What does space say when space comes out to
play. It says nothing. Its cunt is stitched shut, its cock torn from the
moorings. And me, I say to you, kill yourself, descend into the matter 
with the matter what's the matter. The farthest thing is something you 
say, spit, swallow, vomit. 

Vegetation, animals, rocks confounded.

Flaubert knew this in La tentation de Saint Antoine. It's the end of the 
book. The world vibrates, heads towards pure mass. Delirious Antoine:
"O bonheur! bonheur! j'ai vu naitre la vie, j'ai vue le mouvement 
commencer. Le sang de mes veines bat si fort qu'il va les rompre. J'ai 
envie de voler, de nager, d'aboyer, de beugler, de hurler. Je voudrais 
avoir dea ailes, une carapace, une excorce, souffler de la fumee, porter 
une trompe, tordre mon corps, me diviser partout, etre en tout, m'emaner 
avec les odeurs, me developper comme les plantes, couler comme l'eau, 
vibrer comme le son, briller comme la lumiere, me blottir sur toutes les 
formes, penetrer chaque atome, descendre jusqu'au fond de la mateirere, 
- etre la matiere!"

The penetration-descent into the primordial, complete with carapace, the 
crystallization of the body, petrification of the cock and cunt into a 
singularity! But the truth wasn't enough! The truth wasn't enough! 
Flaubert has the dawn appear, the sky, the whole bloody works! Everything 
designed for _Man_! And in the middle of the sun, the face of Jesus 
Christ himself! The corroded signifier, the Mother of all signifiers, as 
Antoine coagulates back into Antoine, even remembers his name I suppose. 
Antoine does what? At the very end, makes the _sign_ of the cross and 
returns to his prayers. The sign's sucked out by the sun, nearby star, 
where we don't have to worry about the Lyman alpha forest, everything 
neatly organized, temperature a balmy 72 degrees fahrenheit of delightful 
bandwith. The hell with it!

Antoine could have gone farther, succumbed. That would have been the 
first sign of truth in the world, petrified, obdurate truth. Returned to 
language, the stupid muttering of prayer, nothing was left. The book 
ended and Flaubert should have killed himself. He didn't but returned 
himself to write and write and write.

Doubling ( The Fanning of Extreme Distances )


From Jean Duvignaud, Change at Shebika, Report from a North African 
Village:

In the South night does not fall, it comes up out of the earth, creeping
like a fog over the desert. A last remnant of day still lingers at the
hour of prayer, a prayer which she has not said for a long time and which
the others barely murmur. Nothing has much meaning at Shebika, now that
they have been told that everything must change, even if as yet the change
is invisible. People have no respect, any more, for tradition, that is
true. Marriages are haphazard affairs, holidays are celebrated with
indecent haste, hardly any money is given for the marabout of Sidi Sultan,
and the young people talk of nothing but the city. Yet nothing new has
happened. Everything goes on, but not the way it did before. 
  
There is very little doing these days at Shebika. Once upon a time, there
were the religious holidays, and the marriage rites, and even a tradition-
al way of working. Now the women stay in the courtyards, occasionally
dancing, and the men sleep on the square. They are waiting for they know
not what. The radio says they must wait, that everything is going to
change. Surely the voice from afar is not mistaken. 


From Rainer Maria Rilke, beginning of the fourth Duino Elegy (trans. 
Spender):

O trees of life, when will your winter come?
We're never single-minded, unperplexed,
like migratory birds. Outsript and late,
we suddenly thrust into the wind, and fall
into unfeeling ponds. We comprehend
flowering and fading simultaneously.
And somewhere lions still roam, all unaware,
in being magnificent, of any weakness.

The Calling of Weber, Future Capital


You're the boy, I'm the girl.

You're even, I'm odd, throw one and one you won, throw two and two, you 
too. Throw one and two, I won, throw two and one, I too. 

Paper scissors rock, beginning of the endless cycle, stopping off after
destruction, absence, lack. Rock smashes scissors; scissors resurrect, the
return of the repressed, cutting/frameworking against the dream-screen of
the page. Scissors in fact divides paper into part-objects, incipient ego
coagulation. Paper slips out from rock: unheralded, the beginning of the
chora, just as the signifier slips from substrate itself. Or page covers
rock: simulacrum, only for rock to emerge once again, smashing scissors,
saving the signifier. Rock has nothing against paper; paper lovingly co-
vers rock - it's a caress of sorts, kindness. Only rock escapes unscathed,
its darkening momentary at best as paper slips from the surface. But a 
rock is a rock of no significance.

You're the girl, I'm the boy. Girl is even: multiple, feminin-ecriture,
frisson, repetition, duplication (boy says duplicity), zero or two. (And
zero is two: zero/nought as well.) Boy is odd: stick, unmirrored, barren
(girl says phallicity). If the throw is one or two, girl is two or four,
framework harboring the intensity if recursion. If the throw is zero or
one, girl is chora, the uneasy paper covering rock, smashing scissors'
edge through transitional object, go rock. (Everything is odd in the
world, nothing is that even.  Or everything evens out in the world, even
the odd.)

And boy? Boy is one and three, the former anomic-catatonic as the finger
fingers itself in the exchange. The latter, a phallic trinity for the
rock-cradle rocking, one-three-bough breaking. 

Or boy is two and four, the completion coming from single digits, girl one
and three, which boy knows all along. Boy is invited into the human, or
not. 

Cyclical games, over and over again, games of destruction and resurrec-
tion, neurotic-compulsive games played on every planet up to redshift 5. 
Games of frameworks and intrusions, games of chora and entity, games
emptied of all content, visitations of games. Games dreamed in the midst
of their cycles, the scissors slipping out from the rock cut by paper
bearing boy covered by girl. Games of the manufacture of odd and even
capital. Games called on account of rain covering games, covering girl and
boy.

Tiffany and Redshift 5


Tiffay returns to speak to me, and it is wonderful, all other silences 
flooding in distant wavelets, solitons, turbulent steady-states, what 
rapture. Tiffany whispers the rapture of new birth, and you must whisper 
too, in order to hear these lines, and I can almost bear the rest, the 
news brought from the Lyman alpha forest at the edge of the universe, 
known and unknown

Tiffany says at redshift 5 we confront our own death, not that of bleak 
eternity or annihilation, nor the heat death of the universe, nor the 
dissolution of the body

But Tiffany says at redshift 5 we confront the splayed and irrevocable 
beginning of everything, the forgotten bone and gristle of us, the proper 
names held, Tiffany says, in a skein of words and fabric

And Tiffany says, and you can almost hear the leaves growing as she
speaks, in so quiet a murmur, the world murmuring at the distant three
kelvin degrees with those slight imperfections, birthmarks of the universe
- she says o cosmology ingests death, this death-in-birth at the limit,
pervades it - the universe bears the burden of death, the hand arcs to the
sky, the finger-tip vector never ending but in chaotic circulation

Tiffany says life is always already residual, a glancing blow stained with
decreasing temperature and the slow release of information into orbits
encrusted with stochastic barnacles, inconceivable ocean whose language
ourselves is under erasure

She whispers, we have nothing else to remember. She whispers, we have 
nothing else to remember. We are forced to remember

We live together with ourselves, a temporary arrangement of birth, death, 
a temporary arrangement of desire at redshift 5. At redshift 5 Tiffany's 
voice grows louder and longing but o so far away. At redshift five the 
fog darkens and lifts 

Tiffany says, annihilation is the only truth, but dead carries with it no 
realization, and she says that we remain alive to carry the falsehood of 
the experience of death. Slowly speaking, the wave cuts the prow of an 
absent ocean soliton, tsunami splashing against universal origins. Within 
the quasar, the noise is monstrous silenced elsewhere, the barrier of 
virtual vacuum, virtual space

So slowly speaking, that Tiffany speaks of slowly speaking, giving weight 
to the words which are pillars of a longhouse buried one-hundred-thousand 
years on the banks of the French Mediterranean, and this is not at red- 
shift, not at redshift at all

O we contort, Tiffany whom I love before all others, we flail uselessly 
at the barrier of the other, desperate in the eyes for recognition of 
the name which haunts us constantly in its absence, unsounded always 
already at redshift 5. Tiffany says we melt within the useless passion of 
her body, and that language too is a game mouthing itself at our expense, 
expenditure, the relative cost of nothing on a universal scale

(I listen to Tiffany forever. As long as I am alive, and as long as 
Tiffany will speak, I will listen. I swear it.)

Caught in the Meshes of my Stockings


"Anamorphis and the discourse of the analysand as a kind of hiding:  some-
thing, which will only be revealed to the subject if he shifts his posi-
tion, is hidden from him - hence his discomfort. The subject is implicated
in the reading of the spectacle, the deciphering of discourse, precisely
because the thing he is not at first able to hear or see concerns him
directly in his capacity as subject." (Severo Sarduy, Written on a Body)

The _sleazy_ leaks from any framing-device, even bandwidth itself, a
refusal of categoricity, and _cybersleaze_ categorizes cyberspace to the
extent that the sleazy occurs on the margins of the _illuminated body._
Sleaze appears in the fullness of the night, the night of subterfuge, of
torn or hallucinated clothing, revealing the sheen of flesh by virtue of
the bearer of the flesh. Sleaze appears in clubs, in the half-measures of
culture, shifty deals, the margins of the law, gender, cult. 

Torn clothing reveals the organs of the body protruding, distended, at
every turn of the subject, movement producing jewels. The images are
screen images, exposed by virtue of the light which is always artificial
night, obsessive images, cathected and inflated with the melding desires
of voyeur and exhibitionist, obscene couplings where truth no longer has
its tables. 

Cybermind is sleazy, the body as hysterical enchantment, embodiment
flapped open by scarred text, unexpected revelations, illuminated by
screen light, by what I write you, what you read. Cybermind is half-
light, frisson of the body, trembling of half-eyes and their dreamings.
Electric women, men, others, stumble through self-descriptions in the
narcissistic realm; text no longer mediates, becomes organs grappling for
presence on the dream-screen itself. Ghosts are always sleazy, sneaking up
on one unexpectedly, disobeying basic etiquette in half-spaces trapped in
the _hauntology_ of repetition, the mouth of the body splayed open to the
keyboard, ear of the body splayed to the terminal labia themselves. 

Subterfuge is half-light existence here; we hover, beg for pleasure as the
wires freeze, packets stutter in their own darkness, the territory of
_exactitude,_ protocols, recognitions, addresses. On the surface, emis-
sions coat and define their bodies, the belly of cyberspace always conval-
escent, always convulsant. 

Is always outside the law, in the Pale of it, Bey's TAZ the confluence of 
subjectivities, organs: 

For here, our totality is threatened -
for here, we are always lonely in cyberspace -
for here, we are told we do not exist -
for here, we illuminate with dreadful acumen -
for here, we do not recognize the other we have become -
for here, we hold on desperately to a life lost long ago -
for here, we are all club kids, denizens of night-time petty-larceny,
small-town punks on a rampage, knocked-up and crying, ignorant of the face
staring back in the mirror, torn stockings, shaved body, nipples pierced
with the wires of everything we have ever ever said.

"The transvestite does not copy; he simulates, since there is no norm to 
invite and magnetize his transformation, to determine his metaphor; 
instead, it is the non-existence of the worshipped being that constitutes 
the space, the region, or the support of his simulation, of his methodical 
imposture between laughter and death." (Sarduy, Written on a Body)

When I'm In Love


When I'm in love I gotta write better than ever before because I wanna be
with the woman I love and want her to know in all that I do how much I
love her too. When I'm in love I gotta write so well that my words fill the
earth the air the ocean, the wires gotta sing and the birds gotta cheep. 

When I'm in love her beauty smile comes and visits in my dreams and my
eyes travel the world in search of that certain smile, I gotta see that
certain smile. 

When I'm in love I lie all twisted with her body curled up with nothing 
but glass and that smile between us. When I'm in love I wanna touch that 
body wanna touch that body wanna be that body wanna be that body's touch.

When I'm in love the fish gotta sing and the birds gotta fly, the dogs 
gotta howl and the cats gotta cry. When I'm in love I gotta wanna be 
with you, when I'm in love I'm naked and new. When I'm in love I wanna be 
with you, when you're in love, I wanna see you naked too.

existential anxiety of being in love in cybermind


the anxiety of _being_ simultaneously _being otherwise_ as in _being-in-
love,_ always this dread appears, a reversed emission from the rimless 
hole: this is what appears out of cyberspace, the challenge of loving 
against an absence of barriers, each and every barrier

sick of the spirit, sick of the heart, heart-sickness, twisted by the 
non-being, the absence of sound for most of us in this realm of twisted 
text: this is what is forthcoming, illuminating the body of the other 
only through sight, intention, perspective, the deciphering of alphabet 
upon the screen into language, into the presence and grain of the voice, 
flesh, taste, touch, smell

the sickness unto death, cauterized self against an unhappy horizon
granted as death itself is granted, what is touched is never ever other: 
this is the pull of the syrupy abyss, the dulled coating of the wooden 
tongue clattering its name into the void

the gilded headdress, suffocating, immobilized, suspending the head in 
the midst of chaos, the torn creature of the neck: this is the sugar of
language, photograph, lock of hair, brush of the cheek against a page
emptied of all other, this is the missive and its invisible arrival

the anxiety of _being_ the anxiety of the mater/matrix, the framework 
of the legitimizing other, just as it is the _other_ who tickles, 
massages, caresses, envelops, binds, decathects: this is cohesion of 
imminence recuperating text as cries and whispers, the murmuring of the 
fullness of the world

murmuring of the sound of the fullness of the world

romance in cyberspace producing the perforated body, awash in the sym-
bolic: this is the projective surface of fantasies, imaginary dreaming,
uncanny tears coating the lavender of the suspended neck, the swift 
sureness of the sugary abyss

the miniscule body suspended seen out-of-body, viewpoint somewhere near 
the ceiling or corner of the room, the whirl of symbols like jeweled bees 
surrounding the night-time illuminated face with wide-open eyes: this is 
the reward of love, longing and waiting for the first and always already 
final meeting

always already meeting, the reward of love

April 1918, Mayakovsky to Lili

 Dear but hardly sweet to me Lilik!
 Why don't you write me a single word? I've sent you three letters and I 
haven't had a line in reply.
 Is four hundred miles really so much?
 You shouldn't do this, my child. It doesn't suit you!
 Please write, I get up every day with the melancholy thought: "What's up 
with Lilya?"
 Don't forget that besides you I don't need anything and nothing 
interests me.
 I love you.
 I escape in the kinemo. I've put an awful lot of effort inti it.
 My eyes ache, the scum.
 Next Monday I'm going in for an operation. They're going to cut my nose 
and throat. When (if!) you see me, I'll be all neat and clean and newly 
repaired. A steam-engine straight out of the shed!
 The cinematograph people say my acting skill is unprecedented. They 
tempt me with speeches, glory and money. 
 If you don't write me again it'll be clear that as far as you're 
concerned I've croaked, and I'll start getting myself kitted out with a 
little grave and some worms. So write!
 I kiss you
		 your Volodya
 I kiss Osya!
 Regards to Shura and Jacques.


April 1918, Lili to Mayakovsky

 Dear little puppy, I haven't forgotten you.
 I miss you terribly and I want to see you.
 I'm ill: every day I have a temperature of 38; my lungs are ruined.
 The weather's very good and I go out a lot.
 I'm envious of you with your filming - Yakov Lvovich promised to get me 
into the cinematograph too.
 I've got some very pretty new things. I've papered my room with black 
and gold wallpaper; I've put a red damask curtain on the door. This all 
sounds luxurious, and it really is rather pretty.
 I'm in a dreadful mood because of my health. To cheer myself up I've 
bought some red stockings, and I put them on when no one can see - very
jolly!!
 After the operation, if you feel all right and if you want to - come and 
visit. You can stay with us.
 I terribly love getting your letters, and I terribly love you. I never 
take your ring off, and I've hung up your photograph in a frame.
 Write to me and come and visit, only don't put your operation off in 
order to do so.
 I embrace you, Volodenka, my child, and I kiss you
				Lilya

Waiting
 
_attente_/ writing

Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to 
trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).

1.  I am waiting for an arrival, a return, a promised sign. This can be 
futile, or immensely pathetic: in _Erwartung (Waiting),_ a woman waits 
for her lover, at night, in the forest; I am waiting for no more than a 
telephone call, but the anxiety is the same. Everything is solemn: I have 
no sense of _proportions._


( From Roland Barthes, A Lover's Discourse, Fragments, trans. Howard )


_____________________________


In this regard, I only want to point out the matrix of the _solemnity_ of 
theory, as the discourse itself scatters a world simultaneously jolly and 
miserable. Our lives, made up of small effects, wait upon the telephone 
or modem with joy and terror, breathing the world undone.

Cipher

I am in love with someone for whom I will be an empty cipher. Ciphers
develop like cancers on the biographies of men and women everywhere. 
Loops are formed holding taut against the neck or constriction of events
which slip through. In the mid-nineteenth century a child was born to a
woman outside of Scranton Pennsylvania. The foreclosure of love upon the
body is terrifying. There is no inheritence. Writing is out of control. 
Stars form pinwheels in the snow beneath our feet. The animals are here,
are not the animals that were. The cipher is in the middle of _o_, _or._ 
I want her memory to continue forever. The _o_ begins expansion, opens up
carries impossible charges. The rim spins out beyond the orbit of the
farthest planet. The rim dissolves within a typical quasar illuminating
the galactic cluster. Her name is written on the rim, her name is written
everywhere, I know, I wrote it. It spins maybe out of control, it occupies
the clusters of space, it sings nowhere and everywhere at all, but I do
not know this, I do forgo this, I am gone, empty cipher, long long gone.

Alan Sondheim


Alan Sondheim lives in another world, just like our own.
He could not tell one from the other.
He was sure they were joined at the horizon.
Alan Sondheim saw the world was his.
He'd say, "Hi, world!"
He saw the world in a mirror, except for a corner,
a hinge. He couldn't move in that close.
There was always the mirror to contend with.
Alan Sondheim would listen to you speaking and would
listen to Alan Sondheim listening to you speaking.
Sometimes he would miss a sentence or two.
He would catchup when he stopped listening.
Alan Sondheim knew that the world was doubled.
He saw that it was halved. He had half of
everything but he could always skip a line.
He had half of everything but nothing puckered.
It puckered where everything was.
Alan Sondheim would watch it burst, but it would burst
in one world and not the other, not even fragments
would burst from one world to the other.
Alan Sondheim was not joined at the horizon.
He did not hear or see so well. He heard his own
heartbeat when he could make everything quiet. He
could make everything quiet and even his own death
quiet. He would see the stuffing of the world first 
and then the world. Alan Sondheim would hardly hear
because of the stuffing of the world. He could hardly 
see, either.

across the sky, slowly floating down to earth, a silk feather, even in 
this space of "silk feather" floating across the streaked summer storm

Breasts, breasts

I've got butterflies there, I've got blueballs, I gotta bang come the 
rain come the thunder, gotta tie me up hold me down spread me open, gotta 
dress the dress

Gotta dress the wound gotta bandage the sky, honey, baby, lover, babe, 
Al, big Al, cutie-pie, snooky, roonie, Alwie, big guy

The territory of the signifier is _marked off._ Period. From the Pirke 
Avot: Make a hedge around the Torah. The intensification of the 
signifier, elsewhere, its dissolution. Period

Puppy love spread your legs, gotta suck you now, tongue your menses, 
transfusion of worlds upon worlds, Shekinah slowly floating down to 
earth, drenched silks everywhere

I wail and beat my little hands against the pillow, my tears flow like 
rivers I'm crying you sailing upon alone on a skiff, sucking my tit with 
my little mouth, sucking my nipple blue-black

Hold tight to the peepee, nothing will take me away from taking me away: 
The sails fill, rudder turns, bow rises, motor hums, captain sings, first 
mate smiles, second mate walks the plank

I'm not innocent! I'm not innocent! I cry, I've killed everyone! I've 
killed everyone! All the little butterflies!

Double Rotation and None at All


From various sources it became clear to me that the body itself presents 
paradoxes difficult to portray in cyberspace. In particular, there is the 
"plate trick" related to the "spinor spanner" it is here that a quantum- 
mechanical property touches on the macro-world, RL, in an easy demonstra- 
tion. If I hold a plate on my palm, I can rotate the plate 720 degrees, 
during which my arm returns to the original position. From Francis, A 
Topological Picturebook: "Half way, your arm will have one full twist in 
it, which disappears, as you continue twisting your arm in the same way. 
Another version of this phenomenon was popularized by Dirac and explained 
by M.H.A. Newman with the help of braids. Dirac used it to illustrate how 
the Lie group SO(3) of rotations in 3-space is doubly covered by the 
group S^3 of unit length quaternions." And in Silverman, More than One 
Mystery, Explorations in Quantum Interference, "All physicists at some 
time during their study of the quantum theory of angular momentum 
undoubtedly encounter the seemingly peculiar property of spinors that a 
rotation of 4pi, rather than 2pi, radians is required to return them to 
their original state. A rotation of 2pi radians [a full turn (A.S.)], 
which intuitively ought to correspond to no rotation at all, multiplies 
the spinor wave function by -1, or equivalently by the phase factor 
e^(i*pi)." 

I don't claim to understand all of this, but am disturbed and fascinated 
that the plate trick results in a _continuous rotational motion_ of the 
plate in the same direction, while the arm returns to the resting state 
over and over again. This defies "common sense," which insists that, with 
the plate held securely, it could only rotate a slight amount before the 
arm becomes hopelessly twisted.

In fact this 720 degrees or 4pi revolution is a fundamental property of 
space related to the quaternions, a system of "imaginary numbers" which 
interlock beautifully. You will find much on this in Kauffman's Knots and 
Physics, as well as his On Knots, which is somewhat simpler; at least I 
can follow most of it.

Still what's amazing is, to use that word again, the _obdurate_ nature of 
the trick, defying common-sense logic, and revealing a property of funda- 
mental particles. Dirac's spinor spannor is a similar demonstration, 
connecting a spanner tool with three cords to two parallel walls; it is 
possible to create a continuous rotation of the tool without the cords 
becoming increasingly tangled. Silverman's book shows a nice diagram of a 
neutron beam with the required 4pi property, contributing to our sense of 
eeriness of lived space, that all is not quite what it seems to be...

And in Sarduy's Written on a Body, Giancarlo Marmori's Storia di Vous is
described. "As Francois Wahl explains, Vous, the protagonist, is 'pro-
gressively dispossessed of her body, which is transformed little by little
into a _thing_ by the strange ornaments that are gradually encrusted on
it, making it impossible for her to move at all.'" Sarduy states, "The
officiants, the goldsmiths, will keep adorning, encrusting her with
strange jewels, setting her with stones and metals, until she is immobile,
asphyxiated. The ceremony has no meaning other than the horror of the
void, the confused proliferation of signs, the reduction of a body to a
baroque fetish"... 


Glittering jewels, monstrance, chalice, simultaneous profusion and disso- 
lution of inscriptions, carvings into the flesh soldered in the form of 
tourmaline crystals, spelling out the name of Clara Hielo Internet:

The chalice of Antioch in fact. Everywhere the body is sutured, covered 
with language, scars, penetrations, burnt flesh where the sword tips in, 
bleeding cock where the sword comes out. The surface is frozen, 
brilliant, _brilliant,_ reflecting and splintering the universe within 
redshift 5: EVERYTHING DRIFTS.

Me, I lie naked, shaved and splayed, the last fringe of hair razored from
the text, last shadow gone from the body like the body's shade;  dully, I
glisten white and wide beneath the full moon, coming to you with a dull
translucency of being melted against matter's hardness. 

You read me, unornamented at last, my holes and crevices, the first and 
last opening into the return of speech (like the return of the repressed) 
to the inchoate. The tubes into me, mouth, nose, penis, anus, become a 
library of decodings; my face remains on the outside of the hollows, 
tipping towards the void. I can't see into me and I can't be me. _I can't 
see into me and I can't be me._

It is the _primordial history of flesh,_ the loss of time like a loss of 
money, the lurid distended into the last text, read with rigour mortis:
I am your sheathe, your gold come from bad-iron. I no longer speak in 
this space, mouth pierced with swords, body rendered from itself: 


_I signify._


"When I burnt the bodies, Shelley's heart was not consumed when other
portions of the body were. In drowning, the blood rushes to the heart; 
and the heart of Shelley was gorged with blood, so it was no miracle that
it would not burn. Ultimately I gave the heart to his wife, and she
inconsiderately gave it to Leigh Hunt, and some years ago it was given to
Sir Percy Shelley by the Hunts. Mr Barnett Smith says the heart was buried
in Rome. It never was in Rome, and it is now at Boscombe, and, for any-
thing I know to the contrary, in an ornamental urn on the mantel-shelf."

Having Moored, Having been Moored


I can't ever come to grips in being in love in this medium; I don't know 
how you do it. I feel tears and laughter, feel the world give out from 
under me, sleep dreaming of a face I have never seen. I am surrounded by 
vaginal walls pulsating with secret codes I can never decipher; when I 
want to be silent, I am forced to speak, to continue to speak, to express 
silence. And you are always so far away, as if I am contaminated within a 
circle with a radius of 500 miles; nothing is within shouting distance. 
Further, there is always the Other, as if you could never love me, were 
you completely detached, emptied of commitments, available as they say. 
So I surmise you come to me out of boredom, dissatisfaction, something 
twisted in your life and in mine, and what could emerge from that but 
more pain, more twisting, among the three of us? It is not as if I lived 
across the street in a wooden apartment, comfortable with myself, excited 
to see the lights go on in your flat when you arrive. I'm an absent wit- 
ness, nothing more than that, a voice, a witticism. I am no help to you; 
your lover or husband or ex-lover arrives, turns over in his sleep, calls 
your name concretely within hearing distance; no matter what, your hand 
reaches out in return, perhaps dead skin against dead skin, but the 
pressure is there and the memory of pleasure.

What do I have to offer you against that? Nothing but voices, whispers of 
commitment, promises given alone in cold rooms facing glass screens, the 
harboring of reality being just that, peninsular. I am no force, no 
matter how much love is exchanged, how many promises. I am nothing to you 
but a presentiment; I can't be anything else, and surely, you say, I 
cannot expect you to act simply on the tenor of a voice? 

Falling towards the ocean, I become more entangled, a Sargasso sea lost 
in its absence of moorings. Five hundred miles away, I imagine you with 
your lover, a small white sailboat with clean sails bobbing in the waves. 
Or that even the boat is drowning, lost forever, sinking like volcanic 
ash obliterating everything before it, it matters little; there is no 
between for the two of us, nothing but waves, not even the ruins of death.

It is safe for you at five hundred miles, safe to be vulnerable, safe to 
open and close yourself in the midst of an epistolary novel. I am 
weakened, lost. There is no other other. There is nothing in my life that 
has ever happened, and there is nothing that will ever happen. All your 
life you have happened without me, and will for all of your life.

I am no longer in the sea, but of the sea, drowning in itself. I have no 
names for this, no names for you, returning, having never left. Antigone, 
I bury myself.

Eternal Love in Cybermind


How can I write you before I write you? I think only of telling truth,
disbelieving its inchoate impossibility. Our life together has covered
our bodies with language, sharp daggers of sex, constriction of the
shaft, the nipple, clitoris; everything defines by lag, deferrment,
manumission. My words obey your words, my fingers your fingers. Do you
write a story or displacement of organs, the linking of knots, and
cybermind is a borromean structure, any ring undoing the w/hole. Those
images that appear, appear constantly, and they inhabit love; narcis-
sistic at the core, they reflect the body's longing for itself made
w/hole again. (Being your hole, being whole.)

The phenomenology of cyberspace is not one-hand jerking, not dirty 
words - those, too, but the uncanny body-double conjuring love out of
thin and dirtied air, full tawdry histories. Mutually, we control each
other's fantasies of masturbation, bringing the dominance and freedom
of the other, the contractual, the borromean into play. _There are no
safe words and each and every word is a safe word,_ shattering contract
if necessary, unravelling what we have agreed to ravel. There is always
a _binding_ in cybermind, the hieroglyphic of the body asserting itself
through the addition of a new symbol/ic, a grapheme withdrawn from the
continuous production of text.

For text in cybersex is always one of dissolution, collapse, speaking 
the debris, materia ejecta, which corrodes every symbolic. It is the 
closest one can com/e to langue, to tongue, a movement always in escape 
in abeyance, feminin ecriture, mouths and labia touching, opening to one 
another. As long as we speak, our breath is closing in, we fasten/ate, 
devour each other, the immediacy of words transformed into sound. 
Through text, my cock is silent speaking, through text, your cunt is
breathed reply.

(This is the edge of every text, one-hand jerking on the keys.)

---

How can I know you intimately, that scar on your clitoris, the exact 
shape of your nipples, and you in return familiar with the exact 
contours of the ridge between my penis and anus? The appearance of love
blossoms in the secrecy of revelation, the intensification of nodes
between the two of us, yet we do not know each other's taste and smell,
middle names, the flick of light on a shoulder as the sun comes in the
early-morning window. We are trapped in our longing, the mesmeric qual-
ity of this space, we are drowned in it.

Typing to you late at night, I am tied to you, obeying your every word.
Typing to you late at night, I am distended, ferocious, obsequious, an
actor in a play desperate to write his lines upon her body in his mind.
Unravelling me, you shall never see the results inscribed in lines of
sweat, claw-marks across my breasts, liquid everywhere across my body.

And typing to you late at night, we are always already returning to 
ourselves, and out of the true appearance of loneliness we construct 
the semblance of eternal love.
