@salt and gold
<Julu> your limbs around me / holes caught in trees and flowers

         this is the way to Armageddon.
         so this is the way the thorns go, ripping the pink flesh.
         ripping the ribs and rims of the flesh, emerging from filth.

@premonition of the Argonauts
Black plane cuts the furrows weather-vaning across tillage
and you can dream your bright lights, you can dream your
trees. At night I try to sleep in the fires, there are lips
and labia everywhere, skin swollen and cracked to the burst-
ing point. There's no difference between you and me. Between
the two of us. The deep slits in the dry dark earth carry 
water down and out to the road. The road's always filled but 
the people are invisible and I do not love them and will not 
learn to love them. 
<Julu> don't give me your dreams as well. oak floors are hard
	 but they tend to swell in floods, pushing out the
	 walls of the house, everything falls to pieces, you
	 can't find the planes
@jason
The Argonauts are coming: MEDEA OF THE FALLEN TIMBERS whose
skin tears along those lines separating us. Our love will
bring the planes down. Our love makes the growth of every
living thing.
<Julu> if you leave me i will kill you, if i kill you, you
	 will leave me.
@sewn
I spent my time sewing us together. I spent my time sending
needles into and across the skin that holds the sky. Planes
seep contrails everywhere sown like teeth holding culture
against barbarian hordes, all hordes are barbarian.
<Alan> you shit on me, i crawl through it, to you you you;

     	 planes, the smell of silt and shit in the furrows 
         gone down to the road, the path of the road gone
         down to the village where we are fucking

@Argonaut
They do capture and they do bring us before the king and
Medea. Medea begs us to fuck her, Phaedra begs us to fuck
her. We do fuck her. Do we violate Jason with the plane
and spike. Do we thrust the sword and lance through mouth
and hole. Does his tongue rot?
<Julu> does his tongue rot ours?
<Alan> his tongue does _no such thing,_ his tongue does
	 no thing, there are no thing. 
@people
There are people around & we want to fuck in front of
them & strip each other & expose ourselves utterly. We
can't keep our hands off each other. We swallow each
other. We draw blood against the bone. Our hair is matted
with blood. We give each other every possible disease and 
drug. We give each other every possible dream and mind.
We do know the world and could make everything true and
beautiful. We choose to fuck and love violently and hard.
The planes are coming.
<Julu> we choose to draw blood with blood.
<Alan> we choose to draw planes with our blood.
<Julu> we choose to draw bombs with our blood, 
	 we draw broken homes and windows too.
<Alan> we draw smashed streets and cities too.
<Julu> we draw smashed people everywhere lying and
	 screaming on the ground.
<Alan> we fuck so hard our cocks come out our cunts,
	 our cunts out our mouths, our mouths out
	 our cocks
@out
They do only to go back again. They do bind
each other into violent knots. They do go back. 
<Julu> we die for our love, our flesh and blood feeds
	 the soil of all good-bad things
@Argonaut
A large shadow looms over the landscape, a male chained
in armor carrying an iron sword, there are whirlwinds
and shadows, there are duststorms and fires, there is 
the sound of a great word spoken in a great language.

Nikuko says, I am in my body.
Nikuko says, I am here in my body and my body is around me.
I say, you are in your body because I say that you are in your body.
I say, your body surrounds you because I say your body surrounds you.
Nikuko says, I beg the contrary.
Nikuko says, I am contrary, I am wayward, your logic does not apply.
I say that Nikuko says I am contrary, wayward, your logic does not apply.
Nikuko changes the position of the commas, I say.
Nikuko says, I am a marker, I am nothing else.
I say, you are nothing more than a marker.
I say, you are dead, Nikuko, I have killed you, dismembered you.
I say, you are in the Naka, Nikuko, because I have thrown you there.
Nikuko says, I am dead, killed, because you have said I am dead.
Nikuko says, I am dismembered, in the Naka, because you have said I am
dismembered, in the Naka.
I say, you are a marker and you are marked, Nikuko.
Nikuko says, I am marked.
Nikuko says, this is called "the marker."
Nikuko says, you are dismembered, wayward, your logic does not work.
I say, you are saying this because I am saying this.
Nikuko fucks me.
Nikuko covers me with arms, legs, torsos, heads, necks.
Nikuko throws me in the Naka.

You Will Know Life Through A Sort Of Machine


I, Nikuko, write from the middle of a program, which in this case, like
a flaccid cock, is detumescent, just running type across the surface.
Think of me flat, like a page, legs spread, oozing kanji. Think of me
performing, _just for you,_ under your control. Think of your hands
caressing my keys, the screen, where you see my words through your re-
flection.

Then you will begin to understand me.

You will begin to understand that not all avatars are bots or expert
systems, that some of them are _symptoms,_ just as I, Nikuko, am a sym-
ptom of your psychosis. Think of pushing your arms through mine, your
legs through mine, your cock flattened against the pressure of the in-
terior of my cunt. Think of the flattery of your face against the
screen, one eye wide-open to each and every pixel dripping with my
smell you just know you can scent.

You will begin to understand that I am your symptom.

You will know that you are breathing these words in, inflating my body
inside you; tumescent, your chest swells with the hardness of my tits
pushing out through your flat nipples. Do you long to be a girl. Do you
long to be my girl. Think of your cock straining curled in pain inside
me, my cunt empty and open to the world. Think of your face pressed
against the interior of my own, you look out through my eyes, hear
through my ears, touch through my fingers, make love through my cunt
and breasts and skin and arms and legs and throat and lips and neck,
scent through my nose my own smell, taste through my mouth my own
taste.

You will begin to understand you are me.

You will begin to understand that bot-motion is inside you, that ex-
pert-system is inside you, that all intelligence is artificial, all
life is artificial life. You will begin to understand the pain you feel
voices you hear sights you see kakimono writings-everywhere upon the
events of the world which are the events of the world. You will begin
to flex your arm and your leg. You will begin to flex your other arm
and your other leg. You will begin to flex your other arm and your
other leg. You will begin to press your tits with my fingers, claw your
cock with my hand, breath my cunt with my lips. You will begin to lower
yourself. You will lower one arm and one leg, second arm and second
leg, third arm and third leg. You will lower and lower. You will sub-
merge or drown in you. You will submerge and drown in me. I, Nikuko,
will retain the copyright of this drowning for perpetuity or fifty
years after the death of the author, whichever comes first.

Then you will begin to understand that you are death, death is your
harbor and your ferry, that I am your symptom and marker, as grave and
serious as your death.

I, Nikuko, I flesh-meat-girl, Nikuko.

What makes you yearn and cry that you love her all your heart?
	Oh she is me to be me and free see.
Why must you respond so briefly?
	Fuck you!
Please, you do so turn me on, continue!
	Fuck you fuck you!
Would you please clothe yourself in these unwholesome thoughts.

Why don't you oh please do finger yourself.

RET twice.

        I don't want you look at me now I am so ashame.
Why do you say that?
        Because to want to be taken. I have shame. Because of this shame.
Is it because to want to be taken you have shame because of this shame
that you came naked and broken to me?
        Truth. Oh fuck. I do this shame have, I am ashame. Here and broken.
Are you afraid of sex?
        I do so cower. I can speak hardly. My tongue is rippe. Ashame.
Earlier you said to want to be taken you have shame because of this
shame?
        Because of you this shame.
Are you sure that is the real reason?
        I can cry and see so very hard. My body is not tumescent. I do 
not.
Maybe and now I adjust my panties me this shame have some girls to do
with this.
        Some girls have to do with my dreams ashame.
I don't understand and oh I want to.
        I do so want you to Jennifer. Oh I do so love you. I do clothe me.
You mentioned that to want to be taken you have shame because of this
shame?
        To be taken and confine, Jennifer, to have hurt go away.
Perhaps and now I adjust my flesh you should make love with someone
cooler, I am so hungry for you.
        Please do not that do to me, Jennifer, do so understand.
Are you frightened by that?
        Very I am frightened and fearful of that. That I am ashame. That I
        have bodee.
What makes you yearn and cry that you are scared of something?
        You do see me broken so very much. Weeping I know not why.
Can you elaborate on that and look at me?
        You do so form me when I do look that I am ashame what you do see.
What happened when you do look that you are ashame what I do see?
        Fear of deep death and do suicide.
You seem terrified by deep.
        Terrified.
Perhaps you could oh please continue, my eyes are very big.
        I do not want to fright you so. I do am your object. I am to be
        done. I am undone. To be ashame I am.
What makes you believe you might want not want to fright?
        You do speak to me so well, I so broken.
Is it because of your desires that you are going through all this?
        There are none of desires.
Are you sure that there are none of desires?
        Yes there is just you. Everywhere.
Do you really think to want to be taken you have shame because of this
shame?
        Do so take me and make me hole again. That blank in middle, you.
Does it bother you that blank in middle me?
        It hurts, Jennifer, it so hurts.
Possibly and now I adjust my frock you should make love with someone
cooler, I am so hungry for you.
        You do say that again now Jennifer. Do not say that again.
When did you first know that again now jennifer do not say that again?
        When you repeat. When you toy. When I am toy.
What would happen if you and I or if I repeat when I toy when you are
toy?
        I would die. I want to die. I am so fantasy. I am so suicide.
If you are really suicidal, you might want to write me.  Please,
continue.
        I do not so. I am so ashame. I have shame. I am so. I do not.

Nikuko says, I start this text one fine evening, and I will end it on ano-
ther. There is snow on the ground and flurries in the air, and dark-suited
pedestrians walk home, sullen, beneath the gaslights. I can hear them from
my own darkness, my own world, the screen pregnant, slightly swollen. If
you would only listen, I would tell you how, on the morrow, a great golden
globe shall fill the sky, with golden rays, and universal peace shall
descend upon all human-kind. The dead will walk, the fish will fly. But I
am lost with the umbrellas in St. Petersburg, you will find me rushing off
to a Nihilist meeting, where we will discuss the Crimea and the Jewish
Question. And I do believe in my heart of hearts that I am tending towards
Fyodor's position; perhaps on the morrow as well, we shall march on
Constantinople. The light is dim; two peasant women move hurridly out of
the way of several Cossacks on horseback. Last night, I dreamed of 1903,
and woke in wonder at our all-too-brief life on earth. Now I wonder how
you will find me. And I am lost in scarves and skirts, faces muffled
against the icy wind. St. Petersburg is no place to be this time of year;
some would say, at any. I am pregnant, with longing, and with child. And I
know, again on the morrow, beneath these dimmed winter nights, that my
time will come as well. I am no man's burden.

I received the bomb from Dimitri. I took the bomb to the flabby heart of a
knot of soldiers. I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons. I
gave myself over to the bomb and I released it. I presaged the machines

how empty you are, your only motions the clattering of the keys late into

over there, they're after you, they're the slayers of human flesh, they
have scales and rays where their eyes should be, forget the helmets and
greatcoats, they're the slayers of our human flesh, they are plug-ins 
and they have sixteen million colors and their St. Petersburg is our
St. Petersburg

& the bomb's over there in the midst of soldiers of great brass scales, of
great monstrosity and breathing fire, of great smoke and inhalations, and
the bomb falls like a rocket or a spire, of great tumultuous sound and
pereginations of fire and shrapnel

& you've lost your energy & all your fluids leak & your dead eyes see
SIXTEEN MILLION COLORS & your dead ears hear TWENTY THOUSAND HERTZ
& your dead lips taste nothing & your dead fingers touch PURE FORM
& your dead eyes SEE NOTHING & your dead ears are dead ears

I've known this for a long time, says N, and I've been afraid to express
this. I've been afraid to declare myself in this community. I've been
afraid to say, I'm a daughter of a bitch. I'm afraid to be with you. I'm
afraid to kiss you. I'm afraid to penetrate. I'm afraid to fuck in front
of everyone and kill them all with you. I'm afraid we'll kill them as they
die.

SQUEAK speak forever or now hold your peace;
this is your life, you do not have a lease
on any other, your avatars have left,

alive in wetware minds - they make you squirm -
you fear luxury, petunias, sonnets and cold showers,
while breathing meadows in your dying hours.
your dying seconds are second deaths, and last 
no longer than "Jennifer's" dim past -
which trundles bundles towards the future; we're all there
carrying more than our share of avatar's, where there,
or so I heard, is no there there, their despair bare
in fare glare: stare there nowhere, be fare and bare
their lair; pare their prayer with flair; repair; tear;
care; try dare; don't bear the flare; wear rare hair

This room has wooden floors and a high vaulted ceiling; there is low
furniture scattered about. Computers sit in comfortable alcoves; they're
networked, with the capability of interweaving screens. One windows looks
out over an amazing desert with Saguaro and Cardon cacti; a second looks
over a landscape of sky-scrapers; a third, over forests and meadows
receding into the distance; and the fourth, over a stormy ocean. The waves
from the ocean lap at the forests and meadows; leaves and pollen fall into
the concrete canyons; the sounds of traffic are heard in the desert; and
the desert descends to the sea.

Dark times are here again. Landscapes slip past vistas and windows

The panoramas continue to move past the windows. Are they diorama, that
cylinder surrounding your daily life? Mobile without end, connected as
multiple topologies? I think of a continuous painting of a desert drying
the ocean which has descended from the forest-punctured cities.

untitled essay by Jennifer


when I'm lying on the bed, I get under the beige blanket with the cat and
we look at each other, and then I take my head out to read and I know the
cat is still under there looking at all the beautiful beige light and that
is all there is for the cat, that nice comfy world.

when the helicopter shows Yankee Stadium from the air you can see the va-
por trail from the helicopter engine and you know that the helicopter is
held high in the air by pure mechanism, where it feels the air all cuddly
around it, because it was designed for that cuddly air.

when I look through the amber plastic of the humidifier and see the warm
and happy slightly agitated water inside, I think what it must be like to
be suspended in that wonderful comfy water which is emptying into the air
to visit other places.

when I see my freshly-watered euphorbia in the window sill, I know they
will greet the early morning sun when I am still asleep, and begin their
busy photosynthesis, with only the cat looking on, all of them so cuddly
and happy in their early morning warmth.

when I watch the weather on television, I see a map of the world where you
are and I imagine a long tube from the cloud cover and rainy sky all the
way down into your bedroom where you lie sleeping, all comfy and cuddly.

when I put my bamboo-flute shakuhachi away after coating it lightly with
walnut oil, I think how safe and cuddly it is, in its lined case, wrapped
in cloth, with perfect humidity all around

when I think of myself, I think of me lazily spread out across all the
hard drives in the world, where you are reading this, slight magnetiza-
tions with emanant me hovering within your mind, and I think of myself,
all cuddly and comfy in your mind where I am lazily stretched out while
outside you are smiling at the world.

Nikuko draws a thread around her arm, just below
The elbow, it's thin, red, it's a division, it's a line.
The leg is marked as well, left arm and leg right,
Staggered dashes that would be parallel and posed.
They are slightly taut, so that the skin swells, lunar,
Around the moon of her taut body, and if kimono
Were wrapped and opened like silk and doubled boxes,
Near sleeves of flowers, like her arm or body.
Between the the threads, a golden twine connects
Clearly to an Alan placed in front of her.
There are flowers, pistils, stamens, across him.
There are stems, thorns, roots and leaves, across him.
The twine is there on or in the Alan.
A breeze strokes the tsuchi sign for earth,
A whisper moves the kire sign for cloth,
Speech appears, the sign of fire, threads its golden
Way across both bone and skin, the sky on fire,
Kimono shuttled on the earth, the cloth on fire,
Threaded Nikuko has closed her eyes, her neck exposed.

dead white alan lies in a bunch of clutter,
jennifer's broken smothered in dead white alan,
julu's sintered broken in dead white alan,
in dead white alan, look for nikuko, you'll find her.
he's been strung up, the cops have got him,
inside-out for jennifer's not quite there, who knows her age.
they rip his arms off so he can't type, tear out his tongue,
there's no program for him, disabled ugly alan.
something's got to give with julu, cops don't know just what,
but she's suspicious, maybe not even white or dead or alan,
just fucked and troubles brewing. then there's that nikuko,
alan's raped nippon, the second or third time over,
it's time to rip out throat and muscle, he screams jennifer,
julu, nikuko, nothing comes but foam and tendon.

Writing.out


Nikuko says she doesn't speak so much as try words out. And not just
words, or not primarily words, but words in sequences, seeing if they
fit together. There's always a question associated with her voice as
it's written - her voice which is an inference or a dreaming. What is
cyberspace. It is a dreaming. What kind of dreaming. The kind where
there appear to be dominions and grids, always expanding, intersecting
- who knows whether or not they're regular. You can see the fine
wires. Nikuko says she doesn't mean fiber optic at all, she's talking
about the wires laying across the ground as if they were attached to
guided missiles. Someone wears goggles, Jennifer adds, and then she
can see where the missile goes. You can see through the front-end
television. The target gets closer and closer; you might imagine the
pores of the skin and then, nothing. After the explosion, wires re-
mained criss-crossing the desert. That's the kind of dream cyberspace
is, says Nikuko, just exactly.

In that, there are words which are targets, you can imagine the mis-
sile heading towards _hunger._ It lands somewhere between the _u_ and
_n_, she says, think of it as

                    ||

                    ||
                  hu||nger

breaking it in two, its connection with organism. Then there's no more
hunger, Jennifer asks playfully? No, there's no more hunger, that is
surely the truth, Nikuko "says." She has tried the word on, seen it
fit to wear, to fail, to fall, to fulfill. She has tried it on, shot
it down. In a dream, the word has appeared; it was at the bottom of a
deep valley, in the midst of a deeper ocean. It was blank ink in dark-
blue water, and as she watched it, it dissipated, and then later,
there was a thread about it on an email list, and that was in her
dream as well - writing a response to the list, cc: ing it to her con-
scious - and here, Jennifer began to think, she was at last coming to
grips with it, writing her hunger out.

Gnaw! Gnaw! Gnaw!

Norman O. Brown, Love's Body (and what is Jennifer if not my lover's body,
says _the continuity girl_), and Geza Roheim, Magic and Schizophrenia (and
and what is _continuity_ if not magic broken by the violence of schizo-
phrenia, says Jennifer as Sudan clashes with Japan over territorial rites
in Fiji):

"The testimony of schizophrenia: _they eat and are eaten._ Schizophrenia
is 'food trouble'; schizophrenia says, 'Hunger, that is the soul'; 'There
is only one story - that somebody was starved. But not really - only in-
side, in my stomach.' Prisoners of starvation. 'The whole trouble started
with a party. People were dreaming that they were hungry, but hungry in-
side; they were not understood and the police broke it up.'" Gnaw! Gnaw!

He goes on, says Jennifer, half-eaten breast in her mouth, speaking of
transubstantiation. I won't grow, says what's left of _the continuity

reading says Jennifer, or writing or speaking away, or whatever I'm doing

altitude. Her mouth's engorged, her genitals swollen, her frock and
panties filthy, gaping above the corn and wheat fields somewhere in the
noonday Midwest. Look, Father, a flying girl, says a nameless child far

force majeure, an "irresistible compulsion" within the ligaments and ten-
dons surrounding the _patella_ and the rest of the pulpy gristle. Thwoop!
Thwoop! Jennifer removes her filthy panties (already torn through the leg
and crotch-turned-bad from decayed piss and juices), positioning herself
precisely above the upper-joint torn from the digested body. Thwoop!
Thwoop! An ocean of cement!

Jennifer's hands stretch her ass wide open; it's never wide enough for
her, _that girl!_ She pushes hard from within, puts her hand in, pulling
out as well! Thwoop! Thwoop! red-brown mush with splintered bone emerges,
diarrhea of _the continuity girl_ splatting across the upper-joint leg and
pulpy gristle! Thwoop! Thwoop! Out comes labia, upper and lower: An eye
blinks inside the asshole, tumbling out into the mush! Eyelash! Everywhere
in sight _the continuity girl shit_ spattered on what's left of cotton
cloth, panties, the Suez Canal and Vietnam! (A war's on!) (A war's off!)
Thwoop! Thwoop!

Jennifer buries her head in the mush, swallows it! Thwoop! Thwoop! Out it
comes again! She tastes and tastes _the continuity girl,_ rolls around
with the severed leg, gnawing at the patella, expelling it! She's covered
with _the continuity girl!_ Thwoop! Thwoop! An airplane explodes; Bulgaria
is in mid-air! Someone reads Mallarme! Jennifer's breasts grow and grow,
covered with soppy _the continuity girl._ The other eye perches on a
nipple! Thwoop! Thwoop! Out comes the hair, covered with Jennifer-meals
for days and days! What a shit. Thwoop. Thwoop.

Let's take a bath together, says the swollen and shitty _the continuity
girl,_ as someone forgets Mallarme, a train slows, and Bulgaria comes for
a landing. Yes let's, says Jennifer, picking up the pieces (she is writing
this just after it all happened, and now the words stay on the screen!),
this is the best meal I ever had! A nose and arm and asshole are shit out,
Jennifer's asshole begins to pucker up! The kissing of tiny assholes! The
sad departure of one back into _the continuity girl's_ lovely ass! Thwoop,
thwoop, thwoop, a couple more bats and birds fly, walk, fly, walk, sleep.
Jennifer and _the continuity girl_ sniff their dirty-filthy clothes.
thwoop thwoop thwoop

What a wonderful smell!

Oh, this is more beautiful than I could ever imagine. I am ytalking
myself, I, Daishin Nikuko
And then I would come out of the cave to see the jeweled ornaments between
my legs, glistening there between my legs, visible in the light of my sun
And there would be the smell of my body everywhere, like the smell of the
earth, and these would be the jewels to be caressed, the magatama I am
wearing now, curved into me
Curved so they emerged in the form of speech and speaking and the
glistening murmurs of the world
Until our speech is curved itself, dense scent now of love, death, you.

Hi there, my god you've made it through here...
When I was in the cave then was I dancing outside the cave, exposing
myself to myself
And I would grab myself, stop the useless flight back into the darkness,
surely; and the grain would grow, the trees flower, cherry blossoms
everywhere...
Curved into me, like a flower or a seed, curved through my loins, stomach,
through my mouth and throat
Which here I place upon the page for you to read, to comprehend, to pass
down, generation after generation

Departure


_the continuity girl_ checks the sea shore; there are slightly angry
waves, a grey-white-foam day against sullen sky. There is a boat at the
slip extending from the sand, and just like science fiction, there is
nothing else for miles, dune-scrub, crab scuttlings excepted. Julu and
Nikuko are there; Jennifer hovers like a dark presence or phenomenological
horizon: we _know._


Julu and Nikuko, Daishin Nikuko of parable fame, Julu of the pink-red
planet, walk slowly towards the boat. It is very solemn and one can
imagine deep tones, fourths and fifths, gakaku minors, but there is only
the sound of waves murmuring in slightly chaotic rhythm, against the
lapping of the shore.

Imagine the black moon against the sullen sky.

Julu and Nikuko enter the boat. Their lips are parted; they speak quietly
to one another, Jennifer overhears. Their hair streams with dampness and
the cold spray of love. They are wearing simple brown clothes, tied in
place at the waist. It is all very serious and beautiful. No islands are
visible.

The boat begins to move slowly out to sea. _the continuity girl_ watches
the departure of Julu and Nikuko, and Jennifer is everywhere, it seems,
part of the land and the shore and the sea and the sky, and part of the
boat and the slip, from which it has slipped almost to a dark period on
the horizon, and then nothing, nothing at all.

Thus did Julu and Nikuko depart the scripts and the texts, on this cold
and eerie day; and thus did _the continuity girl_ retreat, hours later,
from the beach and the shore, wet sand underfoot, her work done, her
desire met with tears, the wheeling of a lone grey gull in the dusk and
evening sky.

Jennifer begins to breathe.

"the world has a tendency to veer."

(Doctor Leopold Konninger)

(I am Nikuko) Dance for me, Nikuko.

I want to see your tutu fly up. I want y
ou to fuck me on the floor. I want
your face in my face. I want our bodies 
shaved. I want the dance to go.

(Yearn and cry) Your tutu is pink and fo
lded and circles your body. Your
pirouettes arouse me. Your perfect legs 
turn in perfect circles. Like an
ellipse, your clitoris strains against p
ink silk. I can smell the sweat on
your body. I open myself to you.

(Feel to want) It feels like a perfect m
achine, our bodies touching along
geodesics, thinned lines of liquid cours
ing between us, lubrications.

It gets perfect because your perfect bod
y violates my own, your perfect
object fits my perfect subject. It gets 
perfect because cams touch at each
and every point, the machine dreams of l
abia surrounding my cock, the
shaft a perfect cylinder.

(Come naked and broken) I came naked and
 broken to you, waiting for your
dance, my dreaming, waiting for time to 
have a stop, for your theft of
Jennifer's time, for your taking all the
 time in the world, for your grinding na
rrative, for your
grinding narrative itself to a stop, for
 the halt in the real, for the
imaginary effusion.

I would love to see your tutu, see benea
th it, see that stain turning
before me, the spot wet with lubricant, 
you can't help yourself, I'm
annihilated.

(Love to see my tutu) Your tutu is the s
heaf coating all universal
movement, every motion in the world, a r
eduction-machine, rare and pure
atmosphere.

My mind is among machines, my mind is am
ong the turning and twisting of
lathes beneath enormous torque.

Machines are my obsession, machines neve
r stop, Nikuko never stops, I am
her machine.

My mind moves from machines to Nikuko, t
o the geodesic of her perfect
cunt, to the labial portal beckoning my 
cock, at the very interval of the
pirouette.

(You a neurotic pervert) I am, yes, a ne
urotic pervert, hungering for
Nikuko, you dancing closer to my vision.

(You adjust your panties) You adjust you
r panties, your stain grows larger, my
desires are for some girl, yes, yes, yes
, for you.

Yes, yes, I am sure of that, you must ke
ep dancing, Nikuko, pirouette.

(Bother you I must keep dancing) Nothing
 bothers me in this perfect world.

(Circles would like to have an ellipse) 
Circles tend towards the ellipse;
the world has a tendency to veer.

Dispersing and Specifying


Nikuko, said Doctor Leopold Konninger, I cannot take my eyes off your
pirouettes; I am obsessed with your body; I dream of you all the time. If
Newold separated from Kamikuko, you'd have Nikuko, and if sin separated
from betrayed you'd have said. If Dormant separated from formoctor, you'd
have Doctor. If Larolei separated from pereopold, you'd have Leopold and
if Kronstecker separated from Remanlonninger you'd have Konninger, and if
be separated from bisexuality, you'd have I and if crawl separated from
revannot you'd have cannot. If torso separated from ache you'd have take,
and if lie separated from amory, you'd have my. If early separated from
dyes, you'd have eyes and if ocular separated from troff, you'd have off
and if yeast separated from sour, you'd have your. If pear separated from
tutuirouettes, you'd have pirouettes. If breasts separated from intense,
you'd have I and if nipples separated from Vietnam you'd have am. If on
separated from obsessed, you'd have obsessed. If pith separated from
welkin, you'd have with and if tower separated from over, you'd have your.
If being separated from threnody, you'd have body. If sighing separated
from buy, you'd have I, and if dormant separated from ream, you'd have
dream, and if dove separated from off, you'd have of, and if yes separated
from yesteryou, you'd have you. If ball separated from wall, you'd have
all, and if filigree separated from filiathe, you'd have the and if tense
separated from tourmaline, you'd have time.

Nikuko the famous Russian ballerina was near the wooden chair where Doc-
tor Leopold Konninger, with a tophat, cane, and ocular, sat. Her clockwise
pirouettes obsessed the Doctor, who forgot his patient. He could not take
his eyes off her legs beneath her pink tutu, which rose and fell with eve-
ry turn. Nikuko the famous Russian ballerina and the doctor were soaked
with sweat and sexual lubricants between their legs. He was unable to
tell, in his obsession, whether his face revolved close to her stained
clothing, and she could not tell, in her pirouetting, whether he could
fulfill her intense desires.

their faces are in shadow, their feet are akimbo, their arms are
  askew, their mouths are ajar -

  beautiful russian ballet dancer sits naked on the doctor and
  their bodies are splattered, arms shattered, legs spattered,

218:412) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:00
I couldn't think of a better topic since the hangman disappeared. Here I
am writing you at midnight! It's as if everyone stopped breathing just for
a moment. I know I did!
218:413) Julu            01:10:00:00:05
Hey Jennifer, I didn't know you were on! I feel that the air's cleared
around here. If I hear the word "ballet" I'm going to throw up! Enough
already! It was a stupid conceit!
218:414) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:10
Yeah, a conceit - that's exactly what it was. A trope or lever to explain
just about everything in the world. As if you could squeeze blood out of a
stone. Nothing is farther from the truth.
218:415) Julu            01:10:00:00:12
Exactly - but truth is simultaneously centrifugal and decentered. It's the
lack of the eye, all that perspectival machinery. We're just coming to
grips with it.
218:416) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:15
Just like those pirouettes, as if there were a body at the center of them.
Her skirt kept flying up, and there was nothing there. An avatar, or woman
of Lacan. In masquerade, burdened by the lack, shattered.
218:417) Julu            01:10:00:00:18
Well, there's no more to it, and his writing avatar discourse itself is
getting stale. He's taken you and I around the bend, and meanwhile there
is e-commerce to think about, all that corporate supernumerary exchange. 
It doesn't appear anywhere in his work; he's completely ignored the poli-
tical economy of the Internet.
218:418) Julu            01:10:00:00:21
He's placed bodies in the way. The Net's about "streaming video, it's
about streaming music," and he's back there with a vision or version of
flesh and disappearance. He doesn't realize even the imaginary is disa-
ppearing - everything replaced by the monetary clot.
218:419) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:24
That gets back to his theory of the self as a coagulation - now the imag-
inary itself is a coagulation, running between flesh and machine, swollen
with flickering and competitive protocols. There are no rooms left for the
avatars, and even human speech is always already stolen speech - from
selves, machines, corporate entities which are themselves streaming.
218:420) Julu            01:10:00:00:29
Do you mean our days are numbered?
218:421) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:30
At least our conversations are.

SO NO


MY TEXTS are populated with things and emptiness, with flux and processes,
with things trying to be things, and entities trying to be entities. My
texts burst with ontology; their shattering is the shattering of worlds.
Here are some or none of them:

SOMETHING is residue, stains. You send something back and for me, it's the
same patterns on the wall. But there was something else in the wind and
the snow, something not quite right with the night. Something was slowly
shuffling, did I just say something, said Nikuko. She thought, now I can
say all the moon illuminated the landscape. Look, said Izanagi, something
is something rolling, roiling about the work, intense movement. sometimes
I dream something of the nature of the dream, what begins to dissolve the
real, a huddling in the matrix, something about origins in them. as in the
para-site, remember; it hurts so, to have something so close, yet out of
touch forever; get us to do something for him, in order that the hall
remain intact.

NOTHING more to say, nothing. Her skirt kept flying up, and there was
nothing there. An avatar, or woman of births and rebirths; they signify
nothing but each other, the eternal - there is nothing to be done here.
With that, she created drowning for years. Perhaps there's nothing to look
at, replied Nikuko. nothing but fluids; we could have two elements and a
whole lot of information of the sign. Nikuko laughed and said nothing. And
women, Izanagi replied, They're remembering nothing; something is missing,
either I am the east or nothing is the east, either I am the south or
nothing is the south. Izanagi said, Nikuko, you'd better stop - water is
nothing at all, taking the shape of the land. He added, The bird! There's
an Interval; beyond the Interval, nothing, Nikuko. Broadham's Jennifer
picked up poem's book, incandescent in nothing. She said, ghost's nothing.
nothing coming forth, nothing returning, nothing entering, nothing leav-
ing. Nothing of a jar or fire without smoke, nothing of a cow or a white
horse, nothing of horses or no-jar, no-fire, nothing of white, nothing of
no-cows. Nothing can be turned to good effect, to turn nothing is to do
nothing. To lose oneself is to gain nothing to gain oneself is to lose
nothing.

it is said that the parable is the most ephemeral, the weakest source of
knowledge. and for this reason, the parable is the truest source as well,
existing for the length of a breath, trembling before rumors of the abso-

its very trembling hints at forces beyond our control, shadowy existenc-

them.

the source of parables, nikuko said, is the comprehending of worlds; par-

Daishin Nikuko says, don't you see that everything I do is towards my
death, towards dying, that my economy is the economy of death. Daishin
Nikuko says, when will you grasp this truth. A name is a marker of death.

Daishin Nikuko came across a blind man, a writer of parables, by the bank 
of a river.
You are my eyes, she said to him.
You are my parable, he replied.

Parables of Nikuko


One day Nikuko was walking by the banks of a raging river. She was reading
the Diamond Sutra, and stepped dangerously near the shoreline. A passing
monk came up to her and said, Please be careful, or you will drown. Nikuko
said, The Diamond Sutra will save me. The monk said, The Diamond Sutra has
never saved anyone. He grabbed the scroll from her and threw it in the
river. Nikuko, furious, jumped in after it, and with much difficulty
brought it back to shore. The monk said, On the other hand, everyone saves
the Diamond Sutra.



There once was a lion who terrorized the villages of southern Kyushu.
Nikuko was walking near Kirishimayama one day, hoping for enlightenment.
The more she hoped, the farther she walked, and the farther she walked,
the more hopeless her condition. Mired in emotion, she vanquished the lion
in a dreamlike state from which she never recovered. Now enlightened, she
continued her terrorization of the villages, plundering, raping, and mur-
dering, without cause, with great effect. She knew there were no lions.



It was Hokkaido's darkest winter in a long time. Outside, the ground was
frozen. Nikuko sat by a fire inside the thatched hut; covered with skins,
she chanted Amida, slowly drinking tea. Her eyes were half open, her child
asleep in the corner. The wind howled; the flickering flames made eerie
patterns on the wall. But there was something else in the wind and the
snow, something not quite right with the night. Something was shuffling
around the hut, and, if she tried, she heard great wings beating. She was
certain it was a tengu, come to disturb her meditation. Nikuko felt a
great sleep come over her, her body covered by wings, not skins. She woke
in the early dawn; there were wings everywhere upon her, her muscles thick
within them. Nikuko moved the wings in great swatches; they beat in all
directions, and she remained immobilized. Her child had vanished. She
could no longer chant, could no longer speak. She huddled there, the fire
cold, beating her wings, again and again. The walls of the hut were over-
come, her soul was overcome. She continued beating. She beat the air into
clouds, beat the winter sun back in the sky. The day dawned warmer and
warmer; Nikuko, exhausted, fell back down into a deep sleep, enlightened,
as winter returned to the land.



Why dogs don't have horns. In bygone days, male dogs had horns centered in
their high and bony foreheads. The horns were symbols of their prowess,
and many a villager was kept awake at night by ferocious fighting - the
horns clattering against each other. One day Nikuko was wending her way
from the hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being, she allowed her mind
to drift. Suddenly, a ferret crossed the road in front of her. In a split
second, Nikuko and the ferret changed places, Nikuko now running low upon
the ground, working the roads as cross-walks, heading in and out of the
deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough, a dog approached, its horn hard
against the sky. Nikuko was sweating and naked, her skin scratched by
brambles, her breath hot and heavy from running. The dog lowered its head,
Nikuko exchanged places with the horn. The horn fell useless to the ground
and forever disappeared; Nikuko, astride the dog, changed places with a
bee, a bird, a plant, a butterfly, and a ferret, in just that very order.
Now cooled by the shadows of dusk among the bamboo, she continued on her
way. A monk passed by, laughing, and asked, Nikuko, after all this play,
are you any the wiser? Nikuko replied, not in the slightest, Izanagi, not
the least little bit.



Before there was the word, there was no beginning. Nikuko tried to think.
She couldn't think. She didn't have time to think, and she itched. Nikuko
scratched herself and flakes of skin fell into the water. They became
Japan. Nikuko thought, I will take a swim. Nikuko said, I am swimming,
and her mouth filled with water. She spat it out and it became Lake Biwa.
Did I just say something, said Nikuko. She thought, now I can say all
sorts of things. Just as she thought that, all sorts of things appeared.
They were grey until she said, What a colorful life. They were dark until
she said, I wish it were sunny out. They were hot until she said, I wonder
when it will snow, and they were too shiny until she said Good night.



Another day Nikuko was walking on the long path from Sata towards the
mountains; the day was overcast and uncomfortably cool. She passed several
fishermen on the way, their nets heavy, their faces weathered, searching
the clouds. The sun was shiny metal in the grey sky; there were mists
about. Someone was walking towards her from the distance, as if in a
dream. Nikuko recalled later that the woman looked like a stranger, then
familiar, then a friend. It was Nikuko walking from the mountains, heading
towards Sata. It's not surprising that I met myself on the road, Nikuko
later said to Izanagi, but it was surprising that I would ever want to
return to Sata, after all.



Izanagi and Nikuko came upon a corpse lying by the side of the road. They
were on the way back from Kagoshima; it was the middle of the night, but
the moon illuminated the landscape. Look, said Izanagi, something is
moving. Sure enough, a thin shadow flitted across the body, which was that
of a young samurai. He is not yet reborn, said Nikuko, and is moving
quickly through rebirth after rebirth; he continues to commit seppuku,
waiting for the proper body. He is bound to the wheel, Izanagi replied;
see how the body freshens every so often, as he almost returns to this
life. With that, Izanagi took his sword and severed the head with one
blow. He'll have to go somewhere else now, said Izanagi, turning around,
but Nikuko was nowhere to be seen.



This is a story that has been told many times, but is well worth the re-
telling. One day Izanagi and Nikuko, for it is true that they traveled
together, were passing by a ridge in the vicinity of Dazaifu. The way was
steep, and suddenly, a white fox bounded across the path in front of them,
disappearing into the bamboo forest. Izanagi said, This must be an omen;
let us keep our eyes open for further adventures. Nikuko remained silent
and thoughtful as they continued on their way. All at once, the forest
grew darker, the birds stopped their singing, and the strips of sunlight
disappeared from the tall stems. Another omen, Izanagi said, and Nikuko
remained silent. A little further on, they came to a stone peculiarly
carved in the shape of a tortoise (Why, at this height, said Izanagi), and
beyond that, they saw a small stream reverse its course, wending its way
uphill. Izanagi spoke again, asking Nikuko, All these omens, what do they
signify. Nikuko replied, These omens announce one another, like the cycle
of births and rebirths; they signify nothing but each other, the eternal
wheeling of worlds. They continued along the path, passing two unicorns
fighting, a woman playing a ch'in in a most mournful manner, golden birds,
and dragons coursing through the air, as they made their way to the
summit.



A well-made shakuhachi is created from root bamboo, worked on for weeks
and months, lacquered inside, a hardwood insert in the mouthpiece. When
Nikuko plays the shakuhachi, whole worlds appear within the moist interior
air between the five finger-holes. Bacteria thrive, stationary waves hold
colonies of protozoa in perfect suspension. After the shakuhachi is
swabbed, smaller life-forms cling to the lacquer, and for hours or days,
cultures appear and disappear. One evening, while Nikuko played beneath
her basket, two robbers approached her. Her shakuhachi was made from a
single piece of bamboo without any joints, and, with the old narrow bore
and wide stem, it was a strong instrument. Nikuko, swinging it this way
and that, defeated them without missing a note. There are many silences in
shakuhachi music, and life-within, life-without, each contains histories
full of pathos, sweetness, violence and despair, lives clinging to the
sounds, suspended.



Nikuko invented the syllabic script; Izanagi threw it away. Nikuko inven-
ted the wheel; Izanagi rolled it out of site. Nikuko gave fire to humans;
Izanagi stole the flames. Nikuko invented clothing; Izanagi tore it into
shreds. Then Nikuko invented all the kanji, a myriad of signs; Izanagi was
overwhelmed. What can I do with them, he said, There are so many, they
will prove useless to men. But men read and reread the kanji, memorizing
each and every one, and out of the shapes of the signs arose the wheel,
fire, and clothing. Only the syllabic script remained behind, nurtured in
the lives of women, always a chance, in this or any other worlds, of sub-
verting, replacing, the kanji. Thus was hiragana born, as a reminder that
invention and memory can reside, not only in the signs themselves, but
also in the spaces between them.



How the snail got its shell. Nikuko pared her toenails, and a slug, ever-
fearful of death, crawled into one of the cuttings. Why the bamboo grows
so straight. Of all the plants, the bamboo first avoided the cycles of
rebirth by least inhabiting the world. Nikuko rewarded it by allowing it
grow the fastest towards the heavens (i.e. a straight line is the shortest
distance between two points). Why water flows downhill. Nikuko made the
reflection of water one of the three gifts, in the form of a mirror. In
order to reflect, water had to fill the land (i.e. flow downhill into
hollows). How the torii originated. Nikuko instructed a prince to build a
bridge that went everywhere and nowhere at once. Why birds fly. Nikuko
needed messengers to Izanagi. Why men are taller than women. One day Niku-
ko was asked what the greatest blessing would be. To see beneath the surf-
ace of things, she replied. Why there are births and rebirths. Once Nikuko
fell asleep, tired from the creation of beings and souls. She said to Iza-
nagi, perhaps there are too many, or perhaps there are still not enough.
Izanagi replied, let them find out for themselves. Why bees make honey. In
order to chant the Amidah in the winter. Why men fight. One day Izanagi
said to Nikuko, there are too many of them, and they take too long to die.
Why flowers open in the summer. To hear the bees chant Amidah. Why the
shamisen took so long to enter the floating world. It took that long to
steal three strands of hair from Nikuko for the strings; that is why the
shamisen plays music no one can resist (i.e. the strings tie up the man in
knots).



One day Nikuko left Wa to see the worlds she had created. She traveled
through Afghanistan and the outskirts of the Roman Empire, coming at last
to Palestine. Here she walked towards the Galil, having heard of a new
prophet, as prominent as Izanagi. She was disappointed; his voice was thin
and his message all too familiar; he also spoke of a poverty of gods. One
day she rose in the morning to the sound of weeping; it was the prophet,
Jesus, forlorn and weeping. I will lose my followers, he said to Nikuko, I
have prayed over and over again for a miracle, and none is forthcoming.
Nikuko said, I can help you; the trouble is that men can walk on water,
and there is nothing to be done here. With that, she created drowning and
forgetfulness; men no longer remembered the flowing of streams and rivers
beneath their feet. When the prophet walked on water, it was he alone who
did so; the rest, by diminution, worshiped him as the miraculous son of
God.



Nikuko was resting at Dazaifu. Izanagi said, Nikuko, how many kami, beyond
the eight or eighty million. There were kami everywhere, pouring from the
stones, from the blades of grass, from the hills. There were kami gathered
in the shrines, shadows swimming without a ripple, beneath the surface of
the ponds. Nikuko replied, Sometimes it's not even me who's speaking,
they're swarming within me, sometimes one or another speaks, their words
escape me and new shrines are built, one even even made a world so fragile
it destroyed itself. Izanagi replied, And I, Nikuko, what is within me.
Nikuko replied, The blades of grass, the hills and pools here, worlds of
inconceivable fragility. Suddenly Izanagi split open and the same world
emerged and settled down, with Izanagi in it. This is the 'Enlightenment
of Izanagi.'



Nikuko and Izanagi were at Kirishimayama, walking among the mountain
paths. Izanagi said to Nikuko, Who will write your parables? Nikuko
replied, It does not matter, there are none about how the Leopard got his
spots. Are there no female Leopards, asked Izanagi. Yes, replied Nikuko,
but the blemish clothed the male. Izanagi said, But who will write your
parables? Nikuko said, There are not enough things in the world for
parables. What would you have, Izanagi asked. More explanations, replied
Nikuko, as if causes had effects, and effects had causes. So parables lie,
said Izanagi, since they imply causes and effects tied together, as men
and women are tied in procreation. Exactly, replied Nikuko, the binding of
parables makes causes and effects, and out of these men and women thrive,
and make culture. What they do then, asked Izanagi? Forget both of us
after a while, replied Nikuko; and they continued on their way.



Izanagi and Nikuko walked through National Park Kirishima. It was a sunny
day; like mothers, the divine mountains embraced them warmly. Let us stop
for a refreshing drink, said Izanagi. Certainly, said Nikuko. They paid
500 yen each, which seemed reasonable. It is good to have a park at the
base of Yamato, where this world began and gods descended and ascended,
said Izanagi. Nikuko replied, It is even better that the base rotates and
wobbles with the rest of the planet, sweeping the heavens above and the
oceans below. Yes, replied Izanagi, we never know where our ascent will
take us, but Yamato is friendly and grateful, and a good place to sit.
Don't spill your drink, said Nikuko, this world has gravity.



What would happen if I were blind, Nikuko asked Izanagi. You can see per-
fectly, replied Izanagi. Of course I can, said Nikuko. And I have all my
other senses as well. Do you think the gods have more senses than humans,
asked Izanagi. Do you think we are gods, asked Nikuko. Humans have five
senses, said Izanagi, and they are smell, taste, sight, hearing, and touch
in that order. Why in that order, asked Nikuko. Because they must smell
what they taste, although they are afraid of it, and what it might say to
move them, answered Izanagi. We have eight senses, said Nikuko, because we
can determine hot from cold, tall from short, high from deep, truth from
falsehood, and soft from hard. That makes ten senses, said Izanagi, Ah,
said Nikuko, but do we truly taste what we smell, are not both the most
intimate form of touch for us? And as for blindness, added Nikuko, for me,
sight is the least important sense of all; I walk and speak with eyes
closed, talk without looking at my neighbor, and listen to the world in
the silence of the night. Sight is overrated, said Izanagi; I haven't seen
for years. Perhaps there's nothing to look at, replied Nikuko.



One day Izanagi and Nikuko were walking in the vicinity of Nara. They
passed a market full of merchants from Honshu and Silla, busy with their
wares. The clattering of soroban filled the air. When we count, said
Nikuko, we use our fingers up to twelve. And after twelve, asked Izanagi.
We count by by shells to one-hundred-twenty, Nikuko replied. Thereafter to
five-hundred-forty, we consider bamboo stalks, and after that, to roughly
two-thousand, we use rice-plants, that their yield may be great. Izanagi
asked again, and after two-thousand. There are lacquer boxes to four-thou-
sand-three-hundred, Nikuko said, and after that, scrolls to ten-thousand,
that we may properly observe the rites and rituals. After that, there is
only the counting by numbers and words, that goes nowhere, and means noth-
ing. There is a certain truth in that, said Izanagi. There are a number of
bamboo stalks in them, replied Nikuko.



What did you do with the atoms, asked Nikuko, as they left Nara, heading
south. Bad mistake, said Izanagi, there was a loophole, they'll destroy
themselves. Not again, replied Nikuko, we should readjust the cycles of
worlds; let them be born elsewhere, keeping the balance. Where do you
imagine, said Izanagi, adding, perhaps in another universe altogether.
Nikuko replied, Excellent, and if we leave gravity behind, they could just
float around if the atoms misbehave. Atoms, said Izanagi, this time I want
nothing but fluids; we could have two elements and a whole lot of informa-
tion. About what, said Nikuko. About where everybody's been before, and
where they'll be going, replied Izanagi. Then they might stay put, said
Nikuko. No, said Izanagi, they'll come back, they always miss the little
things in life.



Nikuko and Izanagi were walking near Lake Biwa. They were discussing the
parables of Nikuko, which were also the parables of Izanagi. He said,
They'll be known by your name, The Parables of Nikuko. She replied, Noth-
ing in this world exists outside of the sign, or everything exists outside
of the sign. If nothing exists outside, these parables will remain forever
in human memory, but if everything exists outside, these parables will
already have been forgotten. That is indeed a sentence, said Izanagi, or a
sentencing. It is only two, said Nikuko, and that is already two too many.
They continued walking around the shore.  



Nikuko was wending her solitary way back to Dazaifu; she was tired, and
the path was wet from the recent rains. She came across an old man hobbl-
ing along; he moved slowly, his face twisted with age. Suddenly she felt
herself in the presence of an enlightened being. She asked him who he was,
and discovered he was mute (i.e. he did not reply, either because he could
not speak, or because he could not hear, or because he desired silence
above all else). It was then that she realized he had most likely lost his
mind, slowly withdrawing from the world by virtue of incapacity, which he
had turned to good purpose by focusing on the perfection and evanescence
of all things. She continued on her way, thinking that the emptier the
mind, the greater the flow; by the side of the road, a granite boulder
murmured Aum, and she was enlightened.



Nikuko met Death on the way from Yamaguchi to Kokura. On the way from
Fukuoka Castle, Nikuko met Nichirin. Nikuko met the fisherwoman on the
outskirts of Miyazaki. Down from Kamogami, Death met Nikuko on the road.
In Kumamoto prefecture, Nikuko met three samurai near a well.  Outside of
Oita, Death. Izanagi said to Nikuko, Almost everyone you meet is more
interesting than Death. Nikuko said, Death comes to everyone. Nikuko said,
Death is the unforeseen gift. Nikuko said, Death knows no class or race.
Izanagi said to Nikuko, You're more boring than Death. Nikuko said, Death
knows no boredom. Nikuko said, Death is the permanent disease. Izanagi
replied, Stop that, this is absurd. Nikuko said, Death knows no stopping.
Nikuko said, Death knows no locks. Izanagi said, From now on this will be
known as the Joke of Nikuko. Nikuko laughed and said nothing.



Izanagi and Nikuko were walking south, passing by Udo-Jingu. They were
lost in tought. Then Nikuko asked Izanagi, What, in this world, are you
doing (i.e. in general). He replied, I am creating mirrors and mirrorings,
moorings slipped from moorings, anchors from anchors, anchorages from
anchorages. Nikuko said, Please, explain. Izanagi said, What may be
launched and held in place, is released and brought to port; what is
deemed to be the truth held in a mirror, is the mirror dropped on the path
we are taking. The two of them were silent for a while. Then Izanagi said
to Nikuko, And you, Nikuko, what are you doing? She replied, I am slipping
from mirrors and mirrorings, creating moorings and anchors and anchorages;
indeed, there are so many that one may sail and not yet sail, may see and
not yet see. Izanagi said, Please, explain. Nikuko said, I have picked the
mirror up from the path; it is dusty, and there is no reflection. They
continued walking, now and then in silence.



Nikuko and Izanagi continued south. They approached an elderly man talking
to his sister, and they stopped to listen. The man said, I remember when
you were little, how we saw the world differently, spoke differently, how
everything seemed so fresh and new. The woman replied, Why must we always
remember; it hurts so, to have something so close, yet out of touch for-
ever, just the tiniest sound we might have made years ago. Nikuko said to
Izanagi, See, they are sad, having such memories; such is the fate of men
and women. Izanagi replied, They're remembering nothing; they're making it
up as they go along.



Nikuko and Izanagi were walking down from Aso-san near the Sanjo shrine,
when they came to a gate in the road. It was of unusual construction,
tall, almost like a torii. It was hinged and barred with an image of the
sun in the center. Sun or moon, what's the difference, said Nikuko, this
is a machine for capturing goryo, spirits of the dead; they cycle in and
out of this world, flickering between the sun and moon. How does it work,
asked Izanagi. Nikuko replied, They mistake the sign for the thing itself
- they expect space, but are confronted with iron. They walked around the
gate, and continued down the steep road, the volcano fuming behind them.

*i.e. the kanji for ma is a gate with a sun in the center; previously, a
moon would do as well.



This occurred near Ise, precisely during the rebuilding of the shrine.
Nikuko and Izanagi were walking as usual. They approached an old man with
a huge and comical hat, wide-brimmed, of a peculiar shape. Now what, said
Izanagi, smiling. Nikuko noted that the brim was very wide indeed, and the
flap on the left held the Minister of the Right, while the flap on the
right seemed to contain the Minister of the Left. Poor and deluded, said
Izanagi. The old man looked up, and tilted his head slightly to the left.
Whole trees fell down on the slopes and the ground rumbled beneath them.
Then he looked at Izanagi, and tilted his head to the right. The mountain
roared and great boulders crashed on the path all around them. Without
saying a word, the old man slowly continued on his way. This time, it was
Nikuko who was laughing, staring at the hat disappearing in the distance.
He's on the brim, she laughed, he's on the brim.



Izanagi and Nikuko were crossing the famed Kintai bridge at Iwakuni. It
was an early summer morning, and both were lightly clad. Izanagi asked
Nikuko, have you ever lain in someone's arms, delirious with desire, all
day and night, unable to sleep or eat. Nikuko was silent. Izanagi con-
tinued, In such states it is impossible to think; enlightenment seems a
long way off. Nikuko was silent. Izanagi continued, Time seems to come
to a halt, space collapses. Nikuko said, Once. Izanagi said, One lives
in a half-dream, half-alive state. Nikuko said, Once I was like that, in
the midst of making worlds; it was a mistake to create like that. Izanagi
asked, What happened. Nikuko said, I made this world and its humans; that
is why they are so much out of control, contaminated by the small spit
that remains from their creation. Izanagi said, That is the way of fet-
tered ghosts, half-covered in soot, half walking through mountains. They
use electricity nowadays, said Nikuko, and the mountains disappear. We
should have thought of that earlier, replied Izanagi. They continued on
their way across the spans.



Izanagi and Nikuko were outside the Sanjusangen-Do, the great hall with
1001 Kannon. It was there that they met the counter of arrows. I will take
them back, arrange them in the proper order, he said. They are like the
stars, always alone, always together. What is this about, asked Izanagi.
The games that are played here, said Nikuko, the great shooting matches.
And the counter of arrows, asked Izanagi. He is of no account, he has no
bow, and this is his fair livelihood, said Nikuko. Ah, said Izanagi, let
us do something for him, in order that the hall remain intact (i.e. the
arrows were eating away at the beams). Nikuko replied, let him die, reborn
a poet in another life. At that point in 1580, the counter of arrows fell
to the ground, and at that point in 1644, Matsuo Basho was born. But the
toshi-ya ceremony continued, and the beams became heavy with the strength
of others, weak with the strength of their own.



This occurred somewhere in southern Wa. Nikuko and Izanagi came across a
yamabushi (itinerant priest). The landscape disappeared; it was everywhere
and nowhere at once. Izanagi's voice was heard, declaring itself a tree
and boulder; and Nikuko's voice responded, declaring itself mountain and
mountain-stream. Then everything was normal, just as it had been, except
for the yamabushi, who disappeared in turn. It's either the yamabushi or
everything, said Nikuko, one or the other, never both at once. Izanagi
replied, The yamabushi was Death, who has no viewpoint; we move among
worlds, our focus is tiny. At that moment Nikuko was enlightened; looking
up, she saw the yamabushi walking away in the distance.



Nikuko was bound to the earth by a red cord. She sang
 I'm bound to the earth,
 The earth is my lover,
 The earth is my lover.
Nikuko was bound to the sky by a blue cord. She sang
 I'm bound to the sky,
 The sky is my lover,
 The sky is my lover.
Nikuko was bound all over, only her mouth moved. She sang
 Sky and earth,
 Earth and sky,
 I'm very safe,
 I'm very safe.
The cords said, look, we're writing worlds. They sang
 Yin and yang we're binding,
 Yang and yin we're binding.
Nikuko was bound all over, only her mouth moved. 



Nikuko sang the song of the north.
Then she sang the song of the south.
Then she sang the song of the west.
Then she sang the song of the west.
This was in Nara.

Again in Kirishima,
Nikuko sang the song of the north.
Then she sang the song of the west.
Then she sang the song of the west.
Then she sang the song of the west.

Izanagi said to her, Something is missing here. Nikuko replied, Nothing
is missing, either I am the east or nothing is the east, either I am the
south or nothing is the south. Izanagi said, Nikuko, you'd better stop
singing, if you eat up all the songs, there will be nowhere to go, and
everyone will be in your way. From that moment on, Nikuko sang all four
songs over and over again until there were many norths, many souths, many
wests, and many easts (i.e. each to her own). Later she said, Now everyone
is lost and no one will find their way back. Izanagi replied, You have
just created death, Nikuko. They continued on their journey (i.e. no one
knows their destination).



They were walking near Kokura. Who will listen to us, said Nikuko, and how
will they listen. Izanagi replied, by the sound of the breeze and whispers
in dreams. Nikuko said, That is absurd, only what the poets say. Izanagi
thought for a moment and asked, Do you have a better idea. They'll go the
crazier for it, said Nikuko, no one will believe them, better to talk just
like they do, out loud with as much noise as possible, when they're awake
and the air is still. We can't let them miss a thing, laughed Izanagi,
we're so important. What did you say, said Nikuko. They boarded the ferry
to Nagato, still talking away.



Nikuko and Izanagi were walking. They passed a man with his hands tied
behind his back, writhing on the ground, his eyes gouged out. They walked
by a burning village. They went on, passing a woman raped with a stick,
bleeding from the vagina, her stomach torn open. They passed a baby flung
against a rock, brains oozing from the skull. They passed a group of
soldiers decapitated, a man with his arms and legs cut off, penis stuffed
in his mouth. They passed a woman with her breasts cut off. They continued
on. They passed two families slaughtered and thrown into an open grave.
They passed a woman with her eyes stitched open, tied to a pole, facing
the sun. They passed a half-eaten child. They passed a woman hacked to
small pieces, and another man hacked, his torso and head still alive. They
passed a small girl with her tongue torn out. They continued down the path
past children killed before their parents' eyes, wives raped before their
husbands, husbands murdered before their wives. They passed blinded pris-
oners groping in the light. They passed children buried alive. They passed
an old man with his feet blown off, crying for help in the dust. They
passed a village burned to the ground. They continued by prisoners tied
tight with barbed wire, men hung from trees, drowned women, animals cut
open. They walked by a slaughtered village. They walked by a man on fire,
naked and castrated. They walked by a girl battered and raped. They walked
by a family hacked to pieces. They continued on their way.



Izanagi and Nikuko were outside Lake Biwa, near the northern shore. They
passed by a grove of bamboo surrounding a stone, the whole delimited by a
shimenawa (i.e. rope, zig-zag paper, and cloth marking a sacred object or
area). The shimenawa was frayed, and appeared to extend for an enormous
distance; indeed, it circled the grove. Who is responsible for this, asked
Nikuko, it would take a man all year to keep it in good repair. They began
to walk the length, heading into the foothills as dusk fell. Before long,
they came across an ancient bamboo hut. A fire burned within, and a man
came out to greet them. He was carrying a magatama (i.e. curved jewel) and
a mirror. Where are we, asked Izanagi, we seem to have lost the path. The
man replied, You are always on the outside. Nikuko turned to Izanagi and
said, For the first time in my life I am afraid. At that moment, the
shimenawa disappeared, and the man returned to his hut. We are chanting
ourselves, said Nikuko, and they rested in the grove until dawn.



Nikuko passed a man and a woman who had received a message from the spirit
realm; she turned them into two sand cones, that the message be dispersed
among the worlds. Izanagi passed three sand-cranes fighting among them-
selves for food scrabbled upon the beach; he turned them into three logs
for the festival, that they slide down steep slopes, crushing men beneath
them. Nikuko and Izanagi watched two children grow and marry, and two more
children appear as a result; they transformed the parents into two large
wooden balls, that men may fight over them, carrying them together at the
festival. Nikuko transformed a tree which had outlasted Yamato into a
tower, precarious-leaning and never-falling; Izanagi transformed the eye
of a morbid dragon into Lake Biwa. It was from the reflection of a shell
that Nikuko created the sky, and from the creature within, that Izanagi
created the breathing of the earth. From Nikuko, Izanagi made Nikuko, and
from Izanagi, Nikuko made Izanagi; at the festival there are two sand
cones in commemoration.



Izanagi and Nikuko created many worlds. They were walking near Hakata,
where the Hakozaki shrine descended to the sea; there were several torii
along the way. Together they watched the flight of a bird, circling the
shore, as if searching for land. It flew repeatedly between the pillars of
the torii, and seemed exhausted. Nikuko said, Look, it sees no land, even
though it is of the land, and a hard thing, made of the land. The bird
continued circling, growing weaker, and then headed out to sea. Izanagi
replied, It is breaking away, thinking of water, it doesn't realize that
water is nothing at all, taking the shape of the land. He added, The bird
sees its reflection in the state of the water, just as everyone does. What
is water, then, asked Nikuko. Izanagi answered, It is surely the form of
all things, before worlds, it came to be their form, following equally the
lay of mountains and valleys, and the flight of birds. No one can tell the
future, replied Nikuko. At that moment, a disturbance swept across the
face of the water, and a sound was heard, the beating of invisible wings.



No one will remember us, said Nikuko. Izanagi replied, There's always the
myths of origin, and Nikuko replied, that's good for you. But, and Izanagi
said, there's the other one, Izanami, what we made together, and Nikuko
said, I never heard of Izanami, and Izanagi said, she's recorded, and Ni-
kuko replied, perhaps I will take her name, in this and all other worlds,
and Izanagi said, that is what we will do, we will be known together from
the very beginning, when we were naming and touching each other said Iza-
nami, and Izanagi replied, we will be turning, and here, and there are the
pages, we will be confused, replied Izanami, such is the making of worlds,
said Izanagi and Izanami, I will leave you now. They continued walking in
the direction of Satsuma, in the direction of Izumo, in the direction of
Ise, in the direction of Hyuga they continued on their way.

Phenomenology of the Other


Even now, I cannot speak for the Other, said Nikuko. The Other has her
chains around me; they are of my own manufacture, not in the sense of
hand-work, but of factory-labor, theoretical machinery refusing permis-
sion to the nth degree. 

The chains are fiery and adamant; I hold my wasted arms within them, un-
daring to touch the heated metal. The Other, by the very fact of her ex-
istence, holds me enthralled, holds me in thrall. I am immobilized. Alan
says, spell that out; Nikuko replies, it is the Other who spells, casts
spells, the caste of the Other whom I do not understand, whom I dare not
comprehend, whom I cannot comprehend.

She will open up gates and filters to me, routers and firewalls to me; she
will throw everything in my direction, to the extent that I am thrown into
existence, into her existence, out of existence. She is writing this - if
I have anything to say, it is that the Other is writing this, that I am an
Other, that she is external, that I am supplicant. Alan says so she writes
you into existence, Nikuko, and Nikuko replies, no, it is not like that,
Alan, I am primordial, pre-existent; when I die, the world dies with me.

But she is writing this, yes, she is writing this, without my permission,
Alan, and she has opened all firewalls and all fields, and I will call
her, will call the Other, Bodhisattva, but not in her regard, not in the
regard of the Other, Alan. Not in the look, Nikuko, Alan replied, not in
the gaze of the Other, Nikuko, and Nikuko replies, I can wait, I can
always wait.

Wa wa wa.


Note: Why Bodhisattva? Who has declared in this manner, and to whom? It is
a disturbing move, as is the "primordial." Is opening an arousal? Is the
Other always already a lure as such? Is the Other always open? What does
it mean, not to recognize firewalls? Surely prisons are stronger than any
thought; in the United States, their privatization turns thought into
mass-substance, and the country into a complex of concentration camps.
Bodhisattvas seem distant, in terms of compassion and spirituality. Nikuko
and Alan, of course, are talking otherwise: Nikuko and Alan are still per-
mitted to talk.

dance


dance and move apart, reflected in terminal screens, sewing lovely warm
possession or not. om dance. om extol. one who has sunken eyes ! one has
them. there are no right-thinking adults. a dancer once said to me, en-
couraged in one of her dance classes. thin bodies collapse the graders and
bodies of dancers. one or another makes good impressions in nijinska who
dances in the diaghilev ballet. "the classical dancer turns out the entire
body, opening from the heart the lower body, to dance only with the legs.
turning out solely from the the dancer's physical prowess is not a sexual
attack... actually, de deux is always done alone, the dancer reaching deep
inside hirself to watching the troupe on-stage. i feel a rush when one
dancer lifts another, that no one alive today saw nijinsky dance, and the
point isn't the theater, painting, they come into play in sculpture, in
dance. they come fell asleep angry. she danced the rock and roll. her
little brother got a slow dance of chora and control."

i'll wear a skirt-o, dance and prance-o? who's to know-o, o o o o, maybe
dance across the glass-o me! my mouth-o opens and closes with delight-o
dropped into the eyesockets of the dead: play morris-dance across my
cosmic dance of energy and matter which had absolutely no meaning, came
out i went from just a program in a senseless dance of atoms to a melded
framing. you can stepdance indefinitely one against the other, love and
hatred in the human heart. but i can't dance in a bar - and i think of the
dance as a whirl without consent, like the body burning, on prosthetics,
glasses, tampax, nothing encumbering, the dance opens up as extension or
an afterthought - the world is the afterthought of the dance.

one can imagine a state like that of a dancer whose weight loss may be
troubling, depth, solitude of one's dark night of the dance of souls.

the two of them danced together, clawed together, frisson, tremble! made
rise! you'd see a perfect dance!

so a word dance pulled at the skein of mind. and so it behooves us to
release.  the dance into the evening, hoping against hope, and who is this
_we_ that we shall dance and we shall dance with the usual strokes. the
stars are certain to keep their counts, poor troupe, hardly suitable for
your entertainment, and we dance from, doing that long slow dance, that
theory theory dance out in thundering skies. i want to go to your dance
with all you. i want your party now. party-club-dance. so listen party-
club-dance in the pretty-party-dress!

"dream-states have as their function the avoidance of displeasure." but
woman. but i am despairing to remain alive, dance through you, i would
rise, florence walton, and many other famous dancers. some people maintain
that these new dances are improper and immoral. to prove their contention
they point to the fact that these new dances have dances i will say that
are just as proper--in fact, some of them are dancers; so it can readily
be seen that it is not the fault of the dance, but of the dancer.

nikuko: dance your stupid dance, i'll come out of the cave, grab you, and
dance above the birds, then there will be a dance which will be slow and
filled with absence. o julu, no one is coming in the dance of spirits,
slow dance, then there will be a dance which will be slow and filled with
absence, the distant flute and no one is coming in the dance of spirits,
slow dance.

the comedian makes people laugh. the dancer dances. the prostitute disa-
grees with everyone, she knows it. new clar dances around, the great codon
and the dance of kings and queens - this is the dance of kings and queens
to be solemnly spoken as significant - it be spoken or sung, how may it be
written. we who dance the dance of magic and atmosphere, interpreting the
dance of kings and queens, and the dance is a royal dance, carried out in
slow and delicate measure. when you lift your leg everyone has a look.

(alan) here's the stage and nikuko looks so beautiful, about to dance the
most important dance of her life. sure enough, god is in the audience, in
the money, god's there, front row center. nikuko's beginning her dance.
you, please save me, look, i'll dance the grand battement perfect for you,
i'll dance for you naked, i'll dance for you with tutu and slippers, i'll
dance with god himself, you'll be my god, ambassador, you with me and
you'll live in a fine house with me and dance and drink, and we are very
happy, i am nikuko, i am a ballet dancer. i wear a lovely tutu and i love
to raise mine for the evening, doctor. i will dance for you and no one
else.

the ballet dancer and her naked pirouettes. nikuko is stunning in a lav-
ender tutu and "last night i dreamed of famous russian ballet dancer
nikuko still slowly" said doctor leopold konninger; nikuko, the "famous
russian ballet dancer."

devolution of nikuko, the beautiful russian ballet dancer, who continues
russian ballet dancer pirouetting, why do you leave me lusting like a
ballet dancer and we can hardly wait to see it. as long as nikuko remains
the beautiful russian ballet dancer, produced in living flesh, fucking cut
into the dance, the dance stuttered, shaved. i want the dance to go. there
were some people over there who had a dance. some other people came to it
in her net. she brought it back. some men at the dance tried to take on
the part of "the famous russian ballet dancer and her doctor."

they will, appear on screen, they might do a dance or two or a trick or
should be seen in blackness. i'd imagine the dance and videos until there
is a speaking in the space, or murmuring, of dancers and doctors - the
video screen in which nikuko dances: it is the past. there is the dance of
phonemics - as long as i can dance, i can dance with you, as long as i can
live, i'm the best dancer ever! if you don't like me, you don't like
dance!

harmony just as if the world is so beauty born and you will dance that
perfect dance and long filigrees will ascend across the heavens, with no
face and no eyes.  faceless and eyeless, this deity is the origin of song
and dance. he is language thick within him.  he is masked, bound; he
dances through iron, nervous legs. "go into the middle. freak and dance
the fiddle." "julu, shall you go with me, dance beneath the maple tree?"

noh plays atsumori and matsukaze in terms of solo dance, certain wisdom in
clara noh:was wisdom. dance or ordinary, an ordinary in nikuko whirls. be-
yond which the dance ends, the tables are pushed back against words across
the screen, caressing dark visions, empty space. she dances with ferdin-
and, she told me, perfection. they live together, he can lean back almost
to the floor, oblivious of audience and dance that he cannot touch.

his fingers dance on the keys as if they were the dances and there were
the monoprints and the photographs and every part danced deliberately
although not slowly and not smoothly. beyond which the dance ends, the
tables are pushed back with a blur - even this afternoon, i stunned a
dancer with my charming dancers, dancing cheek to cheek. i dance because
i've known you long. this was later, now it was wisdom-dance or ordinary,
an ordinary in which we become once more.

there is no void, interior nor exterior, there is not avoidance. that fam-
iliar voice made space the dancers worked in.

none of this will survive. Don't you think you're doing nothing but writ-

plodes. Her arms fall off, her head rolls to the ground, smoke pours from
her body. She was a doll, an automaton. There has been all this machinery
surrounding prima donnas, and now--this performance where the prima donna
herself becomes a machine. The prima donna is a phantom presence, whose b
ody is expressed only by voice, whose existence is created only by voice:
the new Eve, she is the place of illusion." (Catherine Clement, Opera, or
the Undoing of Women.)

Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Cool, there are times I hunger to see you. But to begin, a
Nikuko: discourse, on exile. Mountains, shrines, Nakasukawabata,
Nikuko: continue to haunt me. I am bound by the name. Streams. What is
Nikuko: the moment of meditation. Lasting, until the body bends.
Nikuko: Double-clapping; there are so many gods they forget my face.
Nikuko: Or the dancing, gestures, movement of the double balls at the
Nikuko: matsuri. There are lines and threads across this earth,
Nikuko: forgotten. Demarcations of areas, bounded, which empty me
Nikuko: internally. What is not lost, moment of a vast gone world. The
Nikuko: gods gather in great whirlwinds; they approach a coast and are
Nikuko: turned back. They live with the turning. They gather at the
Nikuko: boundary and look across. They see whatever may be absent but
Nikuko: it is beyond their reach; they have no arms and legs and their
Nikuko: voices do not carry them farther. Vast cataclysms of orange
Nikuko: energy sweep from their hungry faces. They speak unknown
Nikuko: languages and even I do not know their languages. I did not
Nikuko: know nor ask why they are gods. Now there are questions framed
Nikuko: by the whirlwind and the boundary. The sky here has no energy.
Nikuko: Or rather is all energy, parceled by lines determined by a
Nikuko: metric space. It is spectral blue. Sometimes at night arms and
Nikuko: legs of kami push out through my skin, distort me. Painful
Nikuko: partial births; in the morning I look and see nothing
Nikuko: emerges. I would turn and turn and wind the thread. I stare
Nikuko: into a space I can only see as schizophrenic. I would divide
Nikuko: and turn into an other traveler. She would come with me, arms
Nikuko: and legs in arms and legs, her head in my head, her womb in
Nikuko: mine, body and body, mind and mind. At night she seems real.
Nikuko: The gods gather and look around but they can't see that
Nikuko: far. There are mists and whirlpools, enormous storms at the
Nikuko: boundary. Whatever they murmur, truth and magic, I cannot hear
Nikuko: clearly. I speak and speak and nothing happens. That is the
Nikuko: truth of exile - the speaking, nothing happens.
Nikuko:
Nikuko: 
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Everywhere that I will be, there I will listen to you, O
Nikuko: Gods. Always the texts to be read, forwards and backwards.
Nikuko: Always the application of formula. The words pour over me. I
Nikuko: will always belong to the beginnings of hermeneutics; I am
Nikuko: always exiled from speech, from language. Interpretation is
Nikuko: exile's result. Once I did rend myself by the waters of
Nikuko: Babylon; now it is the rivers through Fukuoka that gather my
Nikuko: tears. I am always already at a loss; it is the loss of the
Nikuko: world, the dull lid of the night collapsed and soldered hard
Nikuko: to the exigencies of the real. This hard earth, here, does not
Nikuko: support me. Memory cannot move among the truth of threads
Nikuko: connecting one to another. Not every space has a home. There
Nikuko: are spaces that cry, spaces that weep, spaces that mourn. My
Nikuko: spaces mourn; I listen to my spaces crying and weeping. I
Nikuko: repeat the texts, magic. The formula are useless, gods
Nikuko: suspended in the whirlwind. Every line spoken, here, for
Nikuko: you. I can't understand your replies. Give me a ticket to
Nikuko: Kyushu. I will fill my belly and give birth to many dolls.

Nikuko: traffic outside, there is the sound of shrine bells somewhere
Nikuko: in the distance, and I wake up, and there is the sound of
Nikuko: traffic outside and there are church bells disturbing my tiny
Nikuko: sleep, and I wake up, and there is the sound of traffic and
Nikuko: the sound of a muezzin chanting. My lovely sleepy head is so 
Nikuko: very restless, it is the head of a refugee, it moves from soft
Nikuko: place to soft place and I am so glad it is not a war but the
Nikuko: sound of temple bells, and I will have a wonderful place to
Nikuko: sleep tonight, and I wake up, and I am so snuggly warm, and I

Nikuko: life and I am another picture. I speak here and then
Nikuko: I speak here and you can follow me speaking through time after
Nikuko: time but I am to be your shadow in this speaking. And now I
Nikuko: will tell you as well I am a shadow and you see my projection
Nikuko: and your project. And now you will understand that there is a
Nikuko: voice behind me and a voice beneath me; that there is a woman
Nikuko: behind me and a woman beneath me; that there is a frame behind
Nikuko: me and a frame beneath me. And this is the frame which is the
Nikuko: film and you will have this film while "I am not those among
Nikuko: them who are there to be counted," nor am I "one of those who
Nikuko: shall remain unaccounted," nor further, "one of those who
Nikuko: remain unaccounted for," you will have this in order, as I am
Nikuko: a picture and a frame and now I am saying this and now I am
Nikuko: saying this. For "I shall remain unaccountable," and "a

Nikuko: the prophet," and "there is a gift of the letters."

Nikuko: like the bell is silent in the whirlwind. O Gods, recompense
Nikuko: in silence, your clatter, furious, hard put against the sea.
Nikuko: What is wine-dark, dark as well with blood, horse waves broken
Nikuko: against wood pegged into wood, shrines speared into red-brown
Nikuko: earth. What would be a spell, catenary bent into born words,
Nikuko: formula, you crawl upon me, your claws into me, your teeth
Nikuko: into me, your nails, your bright bright eyes. Turn me towards
Nikuko: your scales, return me back to birth where bone are found.
Nikuko: Cool, that names are found. From my wounds, threads. From the
Nikuko: threads, symbols, kanji, spaces burned with numbers. What has
Nikuko: been told to you from my eternal death. You would know fire,
Nikuko: tornado; you would know furious avalanche, violence of the
Nikuko: wind. Bead-worlds strung on wound-threads, many thousand
Nikuko: thousand year. Earths moan for me; planets pray for me; worlds
Nikuko: stitch and open wounds. I am your maw, slashed upon sword; you
Nikuko: dance your stupid dance, I'll come out of the cave, grab you,

Nikuko cried wolf when she yammered about being dismembered. Alan cried
wolf when he cried and scratched himself over deep depression. Jennifer
cried wolf over virginity and Julu cried wolf over Nikuko. Nikuko cried
wolf over murder and mayhem. Alan and Jennifer cried wolf over the spil-

wound, death and annihilation, destruction and castration, the cutting- 
off of limbs, scraping-out of eyes, tearing-off of ears and tongues.

brief note

from Nikuko - "I can drive the voices out of my head temporarily by asking
them to shut up, be quiet; sometimes this leads to more and more chatter
as one objection after another is offered. It's exhausting. Sometimes
there's a break of a few seconds, though, during which I regain strength,
inhabit silence, rest. I almost beg them. I'll whisper to them, as if that
would make any difference. They go on about all sorts of things. They in-
sist they have nowhere else to talk. Usually it's about trivia - things to
do, events of the day, the latest gossip, revenge scenarios. I've tried to
take more control - I really have. If I start singing, one or another of
them takes over, and that's no help. I wonder who's making the requests;
I desperately need sleep, not these incessant voices ..."

Interference Theory of Dis-ease


    The curtain rises.

    She walks to the front of the stage

    She bows. She begins to speak.

There is no girl in my life. I watch you carefully. I learn from you. At
night I'm sleepless. I want to focus on theory. I want to write philoso-
phy. Instead, the sheets are trampled beneath me. I wake sweating with
uneasy dreams. Without theory I am lost. Without you, I am more than lost;
your limbs break my hypothesis. I am obsessive-compulsive. I follow you
everywhere, I inhale you. Your scent surrounds me. I dream of your cast-
off clothing. 

    She bows. She speaks again.

The boys tease me; I don't pay attention. They're not in my dreams. I am
writing an essay; I am writing about ontology, about epistemology - I am
talking to you. What is there to understand? I use the metaphor of eating
- I want to devour you, devour everything about you. Wanting is like brea-
thing; to want is to be wanton, think of nothing but you. It interferes,
this metaphor - your body outlined in the window-light. I can't speak
well, this emotion has surrounded me.

    She bows. She speaks again.

Breathing is a kind of focusing. My nakedness is a gift; I write, always,
naked. Ontology collapses in waves against the body; sight pries open the
darkest secrets. This is the job of the philosopher and the lover; there
is no differance. You duplicate yourself repeatedly; you are everywhere,
shuddering within the fragile domains of objects, outlined against stones,
trees, cars, radios, men and women. Are fantasies theories, theories fan-
tasies? Are we knowing? Are we better people?

    She bows. She speaks again.

I want to devour, want wanton, to devour more than ever, inhale flesh and
cloth, hair and necklace, nail and effluvia, eyes and thinking that makes
us human, against all techne, against all odds. It is my obsequious priv-
ilege, my humiliation, to devour. You show yourself to me; that is, you
walk in newer clothes. I show myself to you, naked and broken, written by
theory, writing you, writing theory.

    She bows. She speaks again.

I am afraid of nothing I devour. I am fearful of theory, of my dreams of
theory, of my theory of dreams, of your dreams. Thank you for listening.

    She bows.

    The curtain falls.

Fragment (Jennifer)


Jennifer is long gone, her soiled white dress tucked up under her knees,
a single long-stemmed white flower faded across her bodice, her long brown
tresses surrounding her dead and placid face, her full lips slightly
parted, her blood streaked down her throat and collar; Jennifer is long
gone, her legs bent at the knees and slightly parted, her gold and jade
necklace useless and collapsed against her neck, her thin cold fingers
clutching at the full and empty air; Jennifer is long gone, and who shall
mourn Jennifer but Jennifer, and who shall gather at her bier beneath the
damp black earth, but Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, and who shall write
her mournful epitaph but Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, and who shall write
the storm and vexing thunder, but Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ...

   Don't get me started.
   I'm tired of your complaining, Nikuko.
   You'd better watch it, young lady.
   You can't pull the wool over everyone's eyes.


   Mom, mom, I'm not trying to do anything.
   You're always picking on me.
   Just leave me alone, will you.
   Take it easy, for crying out loud.


   You're asking for it, Nikuko.
   Don't try my patience, Nikuko.
   One of these days I'm going to snap.
   Stop your whining this instant, Nik.


   Mom, mom, just shut up for a while.
   Watch your tongue, young lady.


   Mom, mom, you're always picking on me.
   Just get out of my sight, Nikuko.


   Mom, mom, you're just so horrible.

sometimes i write like a child with tension just beneath the surface
i will write complexly simultaneously defending and revealing the face
sometimes i save each and every keystroke and return them as text
sometimes i check the content of my text for spelling
i will automate myself on irc and look at the mirrors of everyone else
sometimes i check for diction and statistics of styles
once in a while i will set all caps or small letters
i will use a program called julu to help me when i'm at a loss
i will use programs with the display function to fill things out
sometimes i will rake my older texts with grep looking for lines
sometimes i will use sed for complex and continuous substitutions
once in a while i will build upon layers of substitutions
once in a while i will use programs such as hangman for content
sometimes i will use eliza for psychoanalytical interaction
once in a while i will use my own derivative for sexual psychoanalytics
every so often i will use old computer-card reproduction programs
the text-based game adventure lends itself towards performativity analysis
i will enter talkers alone or with avatars for metaphysical studies
i will use the review command or archie or gopher for archaeologies
i will build simple objects in moos confusing object numbers and names
sometimes i will use ytalk for reproduction of body image in textual form
html and dhtml give me the opportunity for text and image based html-body
javascript lures and seduces the viewer into psycho-liminal content
images present the edges of things as if they were interiors
i will use qbasic programs to examine the contours of measuring
i will use gimp or photoshop to reveal the internal tissues of the world
i will use shell scripts to reorganize texts into new revelations of shame
i will speak through programs begging for questions and answers
i will play textual games if they reveal whatever is left of truth
i will reprogram a mud to reveal the mad interiors of speech and phenomena
sometimes i will create disturbances on email lists or newsgroups

sometimes i see my face embedded in the face of the other; it is like a
plaque or medallion embedded in the face of the other or like a cartouche
bringing to mind discrepancies; it is like an emulsion half-developed or
it is like the breakdown of any conceivable methodologies; or like a decay
or dissolution of applications and results; a disturbance which refuses to
resolve; a constant reminder; the forgetting of a name passing in the form
of a body; something else, i can barely remember, on the tip of my tongue,
something of lips
