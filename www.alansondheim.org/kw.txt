

phenomenology of internal time consciousness within online worlds,

about going out and leaving
about leaving, there are two clocks next to my computer
they are westclox clocks
they are drowse dialite clocks
both plugged into the east coast electric grid
both registering five minutes until two o'clock
(of the clock) more or less and
i'm glad always to see the _hands_ in sync
you should see them! still in sync!
this give me reason to be alive, waiting
for just one of them to take off or go to sleep
just like that! - you know the feeling, suddenly
everything's askew!
wow!

__________________________


I do hope one of my hands will be broken. 
I do so want to wait until one of my hands will be broken.
Then time will stretch between one hand and the other.
Did you know you can smell time.
You can smell time.
Then I will be so free and happy and can do a wonderful thing.
No second will pass in my lifetime!
I will do that wonderful thing!

how i see my work on the level of deepest down


following the paths until they unfold at the extremes
 (brilliant extremes, the diffuse specificity of flowers)
splaying body and consciousness to the point of disappearance
 (opening myself up to the lure of the reader, hir scent)
occupations, circumscriptions
 (taking over territories of language, flesh, dreams and hardened reals)
fulfilling the formations
 (playing the games of imitations, philosophies, sexualities, mining)
fulfilling expectations all too well, wait a minute
 (perhaps something else, something unwholesome, where truth lies)
perfections of positions
 (world everywhere around the hollow of the one and the other)
undercuts, undertows of positions
 (where the truth lies, it is always dirty)
wait a minute
 (wait a minute)
refusing to cheat either of us
 (a textbook of thinking on how to see and hear)
submergences and emergences
 (taking on myself the discomfort of the soiled, logical substructures)
masterworks of preparation
 (brilliant writing resonating with brilliant writing)
the future anterior and the warding off and on of death
 (writing my hold on existence, writing myself out of death)

this full and empty space


writing online, with biff y, mesg y, I allow myself the pleasure of in-
tervention; the editor becomes porous, messages and requests passing,
passing through it. I keep the _leave_ command on as well, which begins
sending me messages fifty minutes into the session, hurtles them faster
and faster until fifty-five minutes are up. Perhaps in another window ICQ
is open - but what I'm speaking about now is _this_ window in the shell
account, and its transparency in relation to the activity of the online
world.

words and commands and requests for ytalk enter through apparent openings
in the screen surface, which is the potential surface of the editor it-
self. there is a flow through my writing, often peripheral to the intended
content, modifying it languorously.

there is a flow through the shimmering of skins, emergences interweaving
with these processes of cold construction. this is still another version
of the performative of online language, where each sign may be replaced by
any other, through portals drawing my attention elsewhere.

to theorize this, in the midst of incoming fire...

letter to me from me


did you ever wake up on the road, and think
everything in my life is a mistake,
I'm living out of cartons and sleeping on plywood
and the floor's never been properly taken care of,
the ceiling's got problems with stains where there might be
liquid or animals begging to get in, to this empty space,
without soul and almost without reason and certainly without
rhyme. well, this

is this morning's thoughts from indiana, wanting the cat
out of the *loft, the loft burned down or otherwise occupied
by some other people who are really nice and good, as I 
am not, as most people will tell you. these nice people
will live there with lovely rugs and furniture, and good
books, I'm not joking about this at all, and a sense of smiles
when they look at each other, a sense of smiles at least once
a day.

in the meantime maybe my life will simply disappear behind me, 
some smooth function catching up to my present, changing my life
into someone else's, forever.

I wonder what Kanses wil be like. I imagine roling hils and high
chaparel. I think there will be very many misile silos in the hils like
white pointy flowers coming up thru the hils. They will be very sad to
leav this place and the medows wil be empty when they do. O there are such
flowers as you can not imagin wheen they are ther like that. They leav
long pointy stems behind them wen they go up in the air lik that. You can
see such flowers. The stems grow and then they are gone and the flowrs to.
Then it is sad in the medows becaus they ar al gon just like that. I do
think kansas will be lik that so butiful.

Now I am in Omaha and that is just like Kanses I think but ther is 1 big
diferns. That is, the misiles are so quiet here I do not kno wher they ar.
Perhap they are alredy left. I do so hope not. Now I wil go and wach the
war. Alan.

seeing links


talking about hypertext at Omaha yesterday I found myself (as if I didn't
know beforehand) concerned with the notion of the internal world of the
work, and how that operates for most people, who want the work, not linear
(no writing is every truly linear), but presencing and developing - almost
as if the writing were a _symptom_ of the world, instead of its true-real
description. and that this is an inordinately powerful tool, not an ideo-
logy, for presenting complex ideas and experiences, taking the reader with
one. I certainly didn't feel that was the case in graphic or indexical
texts - which in fact allow the reader to formulate a path through poten-
tially disparate material, a path that resonates with the reader's pre-
sumed (since the linking can be contradictory, contra-intuitive) inter-
ests.

on the other hand, there are relationships between hypertext and jump-cuts
in film - which can also re-present the mechanisms of thought. Within film
theory, suture plays a role as representative of cohering across cuts and
diegetics; within hypertext, there is always a move towards manipulation
(by mouse or other means) in order to activate a link. All language is not
the same in hyper-text, but divided into flat and programmatic - words
which _do_ things, much as performatives do things - and words which are
inhabitations within the textual domain.

hypertext then would require a double-suture - between page1 and page2,
content1 and content2 - they are co-dependent but not equivalent - and
language1 (this here) and language2 (this (this there)). one may think of
page2 as subsidiary to page1, but content1 and content2 are within the
logical order of inclusive-or; language2 is subsidiary to language1, as
well as exclusionary to page1 or content1 - in the sense that a reader may
treat a link as a non-link (continuing on page1), as if language2 were
language1, but once language2 is called forth, page2 and content2 appear,
and page1 and its contents are abandoned.

briefly (because I'm tired;  because there's a war on - which bears on
things hypertextual and suture; because I'm on the road), it comes down to
the mechanisms for constructing meaning - in relation to the working-
through of meaning (meaningwork as in dreamwork) within a constituted
world - since meaning takes meaning from attributive domains. a constitu-
ted world (or generalized diegetic, say) requires maintenance, coherency,
distinction, quasi-transparency (a Brechtian world for example crosses
itself everywhere at the limit), and so forth - roughly the same attrib-
utes as might be applied to the signifier itself. since the page is / has
an image, linked images tend to remain within coherent domains more easily
than linked texts which require double articulations collapsed and opened
up again. any medium which appears at least in part iconic (the image as
image, the sound as sound, the video-motion as video-motion) moves within
and without its ontological exigencies; doubly-articulated media such as
language are at a loss during the interstitial break between one and the
other. Sound segues are not equivalent to linked pages of texts; the phen-
omenology are different.

there are political issues here as well - based on concerns with rational-
isms, proof-theory, nonlinearity, orality within and without written soc-
ial orders, the ideological underpinnings of discourse networks... but
this is as far as I can go, given, say, the literal smoothness or envelope
of an SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, whose skin appears twisted and turned, as
if extruded from something purely human and dreaming - but whose internal
organs represent the infinite conflation of semiotic discourses, labor,
and second/third/fourth sightedness - I thought of this object, straight
out of the imaginary (if the imaginary be allowed vectors) shooting for-
ward at the tip of a solar flare, part of the greater hole, the final es-
cape from meaning.

the beautifl planes at the strategic air comand musum were parked next to
shel casings, also a big red barel for an h- (hidrogen) bomb. and at that
point i did think to myself that a god shuld be punished for making it so
simpl to destroy a planet or at leest the remanes of life upon this very
one. becaus we were never given the Wisdom to understand how to dele
wisely, we are agresive animals, as i was saying, to dele wisely with
enormus forces that shuld be under no ones control. i think also that
these forces made us hav cultur to. i think always the world culd explod
very easily beacaus it is so volatil (redy). it is the same flaw that made
the world this very beautifl world becaus that is the enrgy of the sun.
the sun needs that enrgy to run and we do not. but ther we hav it becaus
we are made of the sun but hardr because not acting like the sun does. but
then wen life gets to a place it can act like the sun does and it does.
and it can do that without Wisdom becaus the sun is not wise but very act-
ive. but wen life does that then ther is a war wher evryone wil die be-
caus we hav no tools to stop us. becaus we have cultur from blak cole and
oil and that is from the sun and the h-bomb is from the sun, it is al this
flaw that makes us smart but wil kil us and we dont kno how to stop it.
becaus it is so enormus. now i do think we are dieing to do that. we wil
al die becaus cultur has kiled us. but without cultur we culd not write
this. we culd not do anything. so we can do things for a litle whil and
that is Wisdom. and then we wil not. now i want you to kno this is al ther
is, i mean in this univers this is how it gose. i kno ther are other
universes wher it gose diferent and i herd ther are other universes wher
nothing gose but this is not one of them, this is our swete univers and
i do think we ar lerning to say goodby.

Defensive Exhibitionism


I write like a child because I need to defend myself, because my thoughts
are too simple, because I haven't read all I should have read, because I'm
too neurotic to expose myself directly. I write in constant fear. I write
under avatars because I'd rather be a woman, I want to step out step out
step out step out step out step out step out of my skin, moving into
yours, turn my own inside out, cauterize my organs. I don't even know what
I don't know any more; that's why I write through performatives, misshapen
characters which may as well be inscribed into my flesh. Because I can
write from the position of my flesh. I can take refuge in autobiography -
Ah, if you only had the experiences I have had - as if that were some sort
of an argument. I know that it's not - but then there's the spelling as
well - manipulating e's for example, singling ll's (i shal kil you today,
do not fere). Think of small letters instead of capitals - think of a
quality of breathlessness, as if what's being said _has_ to be correct
because - for example - there's so little time to say it. Surely no one
would contradict a writer on his or her deathbed - a writer unsure of his
or her gender, her or his persona, his or her personal pronouns.

Another tactic is the assumption of innocence - misspelling signifying a
naivete full of wonder for the world. It's an open door - philosophy from
the mouth of a child, often bratty (Jennifer), personal (Alan), dark and
sexual (Julu), striding across continents (Nikuko). And I can pretend to
have each of these characters write as if she or he weren't me, what fun.
So a miniature narrative is set up, a tiny diegetic and unfolding world
which also deflects critique, protects me in the long run. And through
this I can pretend I'm doing something _with language_ as well - a sorry
and broken language though it be. I need only make it appear deliberate,
as if I were writing my heart out in one or another form, and everything
comes back to me in roses. 

There's also the questionable function of my depressions, illnesses, neur-
oses, etc., all of which are intended to garner sympathy - not to present
the real me, which remains hidden behind all the lower ascii texts I pro-
duce out of habit. The real me is ignorant, plagiarist, arrogant, carries
a certain unhealthy odor, not something you would want to identify with. I
have to avoid it. So I would deflect again (my whole life is one great
deflection), offering instead the presumption of a wounding _which only
you can heal_ - as if you _could_ heal me - and in this manner, I win your
sympathy, and again the intellectual aspects of the work are protected -
they remain unexposed, my ignorance safe as usual.

In fact, my insomnia is the irrational fear that _I will be found out,_
that the Maker of All will descend, point His or Her long and beautiful
Finger at me, saying in a manner both gruff and stentorious: Thou art
Nought. My mind trembles at the thought; I remain awake drenched in sweat
all hours of the night, hoping for absolution. But I know it is not to be;
in the long run I _should_ be found out, since any such subterfuges, de-
flections, and bypasses I practice on a daily level, lead only to an
increase of ignorance in a world badly in need of the opposite. I perse-
vere out of a foolhardy and destructive need to survive, taking care that
my texts remain a masquerade.

Black plane cuts the furrows weather-vaning across tillage

the two of us. The deep slits in the dry dark earth carry 
water down and out to the road. The road's always filled but

<Alan> his tongue does _no such thing,_ his tongue does

@people
There are people around & we want to fuck in front of
them & strip each other & expose ourselves utterly. We
can't keep our hands off each other. We swallow each
other. We draw blood against the bone. Our hair is matted
with blood. We give each other every possible disease and

We do know the world and could make everything true and
beautiful. We choose to fuck and love violently and hard.
The planes are coming.

big winds dust storms out of Omaha near Kansas everything quiet and sul-
len. I do my reading, worry that the audience might assume that Jennifer
and company are too Net dependent. I worry about the ethics of everything.
it's a kind of writing they haven't heard before. I'm hardly there before
I'm gone on the road through ultra-fast Missouri back to Lafayette. sullen
rain on the way. I get irritated at "sullen" and pass a pickup truck at a
stop-light at 60 miles an hour. makes me feel good, hungry for more. I
dance over some hills on two-laned blacktop at 70. makes me feel better.
Jennifer's my co-pilot. _she tells me what to do._ I hear Julu shrieking
beneath the sloped and tilting fields. she's saying the whole world's on
edge. she's saying _speed._ sullen and nervous I pull in but there's a
bright spot.

Confessive-Repulsive Disorder


Says Jennifer, which is exactly what I have - she should know, I'm wearing
her dirty panties... Ah well... These are notes from _all over._ Jennifer
can't stand the fact I'm writing all the time. I find it yummy. But it's a
disorder, disorderly - my life's a mess. I'm a piece of shit.

In those painting crits, I tell her, I'm always reminded of other people's
work - _this_ painting surrounded by flows and images which inundate it -
just like this editor, interrupted by incoming. I'm made entirely out of
such information - call it _composition,_ call it fresh-woman composition.
Call it fresh-man.

The sea of images and the sea of imaginaries. But this is crazy. Guilt at
being part of the war-machine, hopeless and decomposed - nothing stops it
but arbitrary actions by arbitrary old white men. Their white is the color
of death. Their cocks are violent and filled with poison. They shit on
themselves because they can't help it so they clean the rest of the world. 
The mouths of the rest of the world are filled with missiles. They starve
to death with metal shit. Don't forget how a bomb works: it expands.

They have no imaginary. They have to make everything real. They have to
make everything hard. They are hard workers. They fuck metal with metal.

I will push the dirty panties up into my hole. I will enjoy myself. I will
show you everything at a big party. You will see me and touch me and hear
me and smell me. I am yours forever.

Every five years in this big world of ours, there is nothing to write any-
more. Every thousand, there are no readers.

             computers are made?

   ANSWER:   Meat. (Get it?)
                              * * *

   QUESTION: Why do boys like computers more than girls like
             computers?

   ANSWER:   Because it is easier to write games showing
             bombs exploding that it is to write games
             showing relationships exploding. [Maybe this
             isn't a joke.]

war, the substance of the world is the world


it's not autonomic but close driving
when close driving across the country
in the middle of 100 kilometers ad hour
in the middle of 120 kilometers an hour
when thoughts become things
substances grained and soft like a body
  wounded by the side of the road
or when thought compresses down
  into the substance of asphalt or concrete
you might notice the lines down the road
you might notice the lines across them
the field turns, turning another field
there are fields of wheat and fields of sight
you find you looking for a number
then you find the number and find you looking
there's a crow in the tail of the window
there's a word on the radio and a roar
the fm station skips roaring in thick chunks
the am station fades like the maternal function
you're crawling but feel a constant skid
it's always like flesh and always like substance
you now know that the world disappears
  when the world appears
you now know that the world has always been
  high speed
you now know that life is a slow-down and 
  attention to detail
you forget the detail and listen to the noise
the noise of the motor is maybe a new noise
you worry the noise like exit-signs passing
there are foods and lodgings and gases
there are nitrogens and kryptons and neons
there are carbon dioxides and oxygens
you are running down a slight slope and you
  are running up a slight slope
for a moment a thought: there is no thinking
  in the world, this is a symptom or a syndrome
for a moment another: thinking is a virus
  or contamination
the imaginary shuffles beneath the floor 
  of the car 
the floor of the car is the floor of the world
  sliding against the world where everything is:
  grit, gravel, rough and wounded surface
i am a vector in this here now car, it's making
  noise

war, T-junction


you're hurtling down the road,
one-hundred, two-hundred miles an hour
suddenly, you come to a T-junction
you brake hard, come to a halt
you're facing across the road
it's like an open field
the road goes to your left and right
where are you facing, furious person.
you see across it, you know
  it doesn't go anywhere, you know
  it's uncanny, this wide opening
  to nowhere, it's as if
  the world skids around the world
each and every structure
  you've ever heard about
  suddenly is naked, maybe you,
  mumbling:
    "There isn't any!"

this message is written in code.
it says i hate you.
no this message is a translation.
this message says i hate jews.
the message is written in code.
it says i hate black-americans. no, this is a code.
do you know what a code is. i am addressing
this to _you._ you know who they are.
this is why i remain silent. you know
what you know. you know what they know.
you know this message is in code; it says:
we hate serbs and albanians. therefore
this is a double message - decode:
i am so very hated for everything
that i do believe in my heart:
that you may put more holes in my body:
you may sew them up again.
that you may put more holes in my body,
so may you sew them up again.
so this message is written in code; 
and it says: tonight we will eat human meat,
and tomorrow we will finish the rest of the
animals.
we shall decipher the world,
then we shall decipher the rest of the world.

War, Lafayette to Wilkes-Barre


my hurting arm from twelve-hour Indiana to Pennsylvania drive
but I'm not a refugee, not carrying anything, not losing anything
not fleeing anything, not ducking anything
nor swerving the car to avoid more than semis careening down 80 at 80
not bomb craters, people, buildings -
can't sleep so go to melatonin, but not fear of flame, fire, scream
might take vicodin for the fever but it will pass -
once again outside in the cold air going driving through storm
but not shrapnel, missiles, bullets -
driving through construction, traffic, backed-up semis
but not like this and not like that -
not like the others or the red-haired woman by the beach
or the lonely e-flat clarinet in the antique shop waiting for a mouth
not like the rim of fire -
high winds, not like the high winds from the rim of fire
not like this, not like that -
but not like that, not like this
oh fuck I can't write about anything
nothing has ever happened to me
not like that, not like this
we'll all write about the war which isn't the war
we'll all feel we're doing something 
we're passing on mail, passing on information
don't read this, move on, there's a ball of fire in the sky
which I can't even imagine dragging herself through the ruins

in this dream there were walls and waves beyond, and there were objects
come forth from the walls, hardened electricity, ready to burst, of all
sorts, some of which my friends could see, all of which were visible to
me. and oh, upon waking, all those energies from the storms about, brood-
ing and sullen - all those energies collapsed into perfect writings from
other worlds, of which I am grateful to be the conducer, the channeler,
the flow-by-night-and-day, the dream-weaver, the shape-rider. in truth it
is your shape always behind me, always within me, that turns with the
force of several horse-power, an alternating-current motor running my
images against the inert and shattered real of everyday life. so in this
dream, there was a patent number, and that patent number was you.

her dark places (earl of rochester)


thin panties without holes for breathing cocks
(tight against the shaft and open hole)
make landscape, slope and field - nothing blocks
the cotton white outlining the dark soul
of this white land; you might restrain the male,
keep him down and hard and self-inserted -
those spurted missiles turn to words and fail
the death of stories, climax blown and blurted.
goddess, make us women, shave us, grow our breasts,
spurt milk, let hardened shafts converted
into the depths of cunts from which the words shall crest;
let panties be the first and last of our inverted -
i wear your smoothness, blank order, your bequest
upon which dreams and poems are made, perverted.


JULU AND NIKUKO'S HUMBLE PRAYER (THEY HAVE WRITTEN IT TOGETHER)


THE THING ABOUT BEING-HUMAN IS RELIANCE ON THIS SMALL BAG OF FLESH, ITS
VORACIOUS NEED FOR FOOD, WATER, OXYGEN, SUNLIGHT, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS,
TRACE-ELEMENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE, OTHER GASES, GRAVITY, TIME FOR SLEEP,
SUFFICIENT NEARBY SUBSTANCES FOR HOME AND CLOTHING, SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY
FOR SUSTENANCE AND PROCREATION. THE BAG HUNGERS AND DEVOURS, MAKES BOUN-
DARIES, DOESN'T RECOGNIZE BOUNDARIES. THE BAG IS SO SMALL THAT A ROCK WILL
CRUSH IT, SO NEEDY THAT WATER WILL DROWN IT. THE BAG CAN'T REACH MORE THAN
A METER AWAY IN JUST ABOUT ANY DIRECTION, BUT IT HAS LEARNED TO EMPLOY
VECTORS. THE VECTORS UNDER ITS CONTROL ROAM THE EARTH AND SKIES, RETURNING
BOTH TO STATES OF ABSOLUTE CHAOS. THE THING ABOUT BEING-HUMAN IS THE MIND
AS WELL, BUT IT'S EASIER TO SERVICE THE MIND THROUGH MIND-CANDY THAN THE
BODY THROUGH VILE DESTRUCTION. LET THE MIND THINK WHAT IT WILL; GIVE IT
PICTURES OF THE DAMNED AND IT WILL BE CONTENT; SATISFY IT AND IT WILL
CEASE ITS YAMMERING; FEED IT ORGASM AND IT WILL SELF-ANNIHILATE. IN THE
MEANTIME, LET US BREAK THE VECTORS IN TWO; LET US CRUSH THEM UTTERLY. LET
THE BAGS ROAM THE EARTH NAKED AND WITHOUT THE POWERS OF SPEECH, LET US
BURN THEIR EYES AND EARS, LET US AMPUTATE THEIR POWERS OF MOBILITY, LET US
AMPUTATE OUR TONGUES AND GENERATIVE ORGANS AS WELL. LET US CEASE THIS PURE
RELIANCE ON THE NATURAL AND UNNATURAL WORLDS AROUND US; LET US TEND
TOWARDS PURITY BEFORE SLAUGHTER ITSELF BECOMES INCANDESCENT, WITHOUT CAUSE
OR REASON. LET US BE PURE; LET US YEARN FOR THE TRUTH OF BEAUTY AND THE
BEAUTY OF TRUTH. LET PURITY REIGN UPON THIS EARTH. LET THE BAGS CEASE. AND
LET US WORK TOWARDS THIS END NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT, UNTIL THE TWO
ARE ONE.

credo, ray, me


in lawrence where i read my work in chapel, i got to talking
with someone, uncertain of myself, i thought i was squawking
trying to explain that my writing has to convey my certain desperation
or else nothing will emerge out of the philosophical situation - 
more explanation. that it is always a matter of life and death
to set it down, and then there's the centering of body and breath.
because flesh is at a certain limit, where everything comes together
in my work; without that intensity, it seems like cooler weather
when nothing happens. i've got to make every text my last,
almost suicidal, reflecting future, present, past -
i want them to succeed, even when they seem colloquial, turned out
too quickly - but in reality they're formal, almost burned out
of me - the content is everything; i place myself on the line
where my discomfort dominates, where i philosophize and whine
about the world which needs such whining. there's nothing left
of me after the text is finished; memory as well bereft
and sullen. in lawrence it was also clear that depression, pain
give me a field to write within; there's a certain gain
when the world turns tense and violent. my writings soar
at that point; the ontological bones are sharpened, bore
within epistemology. i find myself whittling on the ledge
where the bones are, pushing my writing closer to the edge.
and this, i would go on to say, pushed out a certain anger
in relation to writing, where style turns for me a certain danger
or seduction; it's the meat of the text, not its expression,
if the two may separate at all, that burns in quick succession
all homes where i take refuge against the truth; instead,
"destroy, she said" surveying, building, destroying, the homestead
which is the only home there is - it is a sorry flight
but necessary, my texts fleeing deeper into night;
whatever's seen there is visible by virtue of a light
intentionally lit by one or another creature needing sight.
think of my texts as manifestos, as witnesses, of dire plight;
you'll be half wrong - they're meditations, but you'll be half right -
they settle in sodden pools, analytical examinations of their blight
which takes me from despair and drowning to an unknown height
from which both space and time and elsewhere are dismal and delight,
describing the possible, emanations, death - so that i write
the darkness darker, the depths deeper, with lurid fear and might.
this was the gesture in lawrence, where i spoke
of the political economy of writing and its terrifying yoke
(although only now i write clearly my intent,
at the time hardly understanding what i meant.)

"There are, to be sure, examples where a gross masochism _is_ involved.
The most notorious is the penis tattoo - a form of decoration that accre-
dited tattoo masters refuse to have anything to do with. The glans penis
itself is tattooed to resemble a peach or an eggplant; the shaft is often
also decorated - tendrils, leaves, and sometimes even the testicles are
shaved and decorated. The pain of such a cosmetic operation must be so
extreme that few can bear it. In fact, only the masochistic can ever have
the penis tattooed. The tumescence necessary for the tattooing operation
is insured by the masochism of the customer. A tattooed penis thus indic-
ated, to the devotee of the art, a man whose eroticism is confined simply
to the masochistic form." (The Japanese Tattoo, text by Donald Richie,
photographs by Ian Buruma.)

"The voyeur is very careful to maintain a gulf, an empty space, between
the object and the eye, the object and his own body; his look fastens the
object at the right distance, as with those cinema spectators who take
care to avoid being too close to or too far from the screen. The voyeur
represents in space the fracture which forever separates him from the
object; he represents his very dissatisfaction (which is precisely what he
needs as a voyeur), and thus also his 'satisfaction' insofar as it is of a
specifically voyeuristic type. To fill in the distance would threaten to
overwhelm the subject, to lead him to consume the object (the object which
is now too close so that he cannot see it any more), to bring him to org-
asm and the pleasure of his own body, hence to the exercise of other
drives, mobilizing the senses of contact and putting an end to the scopic
arrangement." (The Imaginary Signifier, Psychoanalysis and the Cinema,
Christian Metz.)

Don't stop taking your medication. Please, John, don't stop now. Please,
it's not too late. Please - you know what happens - you know what's
happened before. For God's sakes, John, please listen to reason. Please,
we're here for you - you know that. We're not your enemy. Don't you know
that? Don't you remember how much fun we used to have? Please - I'm
serious, I've never been more serious in my life. Please, there are just a
few pills a day - it doesn't take much time. You're so much nicer then.
Please - I'm worried what can happen to you. I'm worried what you'll do.
You remember what you did last time; I know you remember. Everyone
remembers. My God, John, I'm begging you personally. Do you want me to get
down on my hands and knees? Look, I'm getting down on my hands and knees.
I don't know what else to do. I spend all day and night crying over this.
Terrible things will happen if you stop taking your medication. Oh God,
please please John, please don't stop.

As The World Turns


I come to Bloomfield College. I go to the Computer Science Building. I'm
nervous; I'm preparing to teach. I've got a new account. I turn to the
Emacs doctor - wouldn't you?

I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.
I can't believe this is running here - for sure!
Why do you say that?
Because I haven't been in this lab before.
Is it because you have not been in this lab before that you came to
me?
Yeah, to find out how things work.
Can you elaborate on that?
Not really - you're the doctor.
Earlier you said you have not been in this lab before?
Yes.
I see...  Well, what makes you believe this is so?
Because I'm new here.
Does it bother you that you are new there?
No.
Why not?
Why should it?
I would appreciate it if you would continue.
There's nothing more to say.
Maybe your plans have something to do with this.
Yeah, teaching here Saturday.
Are you sure that yeah teaching there saturday?
Yeah.
Go on, don't be afraid.
I'm not.
You mentioned that you have not been in this lab before?
True enough!
Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?
God only knows...
Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say god only
knows?
Yes!
Yes, hmmm... so, do you really think this is so?
Yes.
I understand.  So what makes you think this is so?
I wish you were more intelligent...

I worked and worked. I loaded the personal H:\ drive with numerous files.
Yes I did. And I found myself playing with this version of Emacs, as well
as telnetting to my Panix shell account - both familiar, comfortable, and
neighborly. Panix, with its distraught hi-intensity personal email mixed
with list and business messages, was a homestead brought close. Emacs,
with the usual escape and control meta-commands was simpler than I had
remembered - but then it was running in a Win-9? environment complete with
X-window-like drop-down menus. I could bounce around and see my image
everywhere. I used the same login on the three Bloomfield accounts that I
did on Panix. I roamed through the high-speed T1. I breathed Webpages. I
saw dynamic-html miracles. I saw cleverness I had only dreamed of. There
were these circular twirling animations... There were things crawling up
and down the screen... I looked at the shell account - black on white...
It looked tawdry. But I'd never seen such intensity. Ah... I went back to
the Web; it beckoned me. I saw hybrid life-forms, tentacles pulling me
towards the screen. The Doctor, bigger than ever, her hand outstretched,
beautiful white lab-coat, red hair... I almost fell through the screen...
Suddenly, more mail... Mail beckoned; the sleazy black and white, the
poverty of it all... But I fell for it... I was hooked... There were these
letters... There was business all around, some list-mail as well. My eyes
clouded over... My eyes teared... There were these others... I could have
been anywhere... I knew I was home... I knew what was inside of me... I
knew I was the doctor and I was the patient... I knew I could cure myself,
cure the world... I knew what to do... I was reading and writing, I was
crying and smiling, I was singing and sighing... It was all there, it was
me, it was my life boiling out of the screen... Everyone I ever knew, half
in and half out... Everyone...

your you connects my mesh - oh so using

We Could Not Be @War


I am sure the war is a virtual war. I am sure Clinton and Milosevic are
virtual presidents. I have never met them. There is no "them" to meet. I
am sure that Kosovo or Kosova is a virtual place. I do see it spelled both
ways so the RFC, request for comments, hasn't been settled yet by the In-
ternet Task Force. I am equally certain that issues of virtual subjecti-
vity are applicable to cruise missiles, which create equally virtual co-
rpses; apply @cruise <destination> and see what happens; a random number
function determines <collateral damage> <n/e/s/w>. I am positive that such
corpses return to life in the Chapel, after a suitable delay spelled by
the Wizard, with the command @pray. Then there is a discussion between the
Wizard and the Devil and the corpse is released, wounded, and weakened,
without gold, but intact and @alive. 

And I am sure that Albanians and Serbs are guilds of bots, just the same
as NATO-USA, that they have fought for months over the same quota, without
the aid of a QRB, quota review board. The only things at stake are a few
small sectors of hard drives on machines probably tucked away in the back
of some university computer lab. I am certain as well that the machines
are real. I do want to assure you that @bomb is entirely reversible, no
matter what you may hear. Did you believe the Good Times virus? Did you
wise up? Have you _seen_ any 'collateral damage'? What you have seen is a
lot of @satellite bitmaps, a great many @fighter gifs and jpegs. I am cer-
tain these are virtual images. I am certain this is a virtual text. And I
am positive this is a virtual text as well.

Shiki


A roof is a combination of a spinning-jenny and an overhanging cliff;
therefore it references a cliff with the turmoil of water far beneath. A
beam is a combination of a carpenter's square and double-bamboo; I smile,
thinking of the uprightness of the bamboo-grove on the mountainside above
the shrine. A wall is formed from the hieroglyphic representation of a
hand, coupled with magatama, the curved jewel in the hand which makes a
wall around the wearer. A floor is simply a field without stakes, and a
corner is a nest with a mirror reflecting the beauty of the room. A room
is a skein of thread holding shellfish deep within it. A great sky is the
murmur of a greater shout with the radical for root. Here I will take my
wall down and build a new wall. Here, I will spin silk for a wonderful
sash, and here I will wait out the storm of my passion beneath the spears
of rain, a combination of jewels beneath ancient double-arches, heading
towards the east.

tired of stuff of the world?


when i'm tired it's a great wheel plane, not an avatar which drives me
slightly nauseous at the edges, weathers, plains, mountains and wheels
the plane's wheeled out on the plain
the plane's on the ideal plane of the plain
the great wheel of the plane intersects the plain in a rumpled line
i can follow the line but i can't think about anything except "much"
every line is sentenced to be a sentence
every rumpled line is at fault
my grammar follows into the fault, my nerves are on edge
my eyes follow my eyes around the stares in the room, down them
who are they now, where are they now
i'll follow everyone in the whole wide world, i'll lose myself
i'll be your path behind you
i'll be on your path crossing the plain at the edges
sooner or later, there will be a great apology on the plane
i'm trying to think when the pilot's too tired to follow the wheel
the pilot is me and i'm crossing the plane of you
now i will climb the very great towers of fire
there are flames above and below me, there are great flames surround me
now i will survey the lands of all these letters of terror
from the towers, consumption, consumption from plains and edges
forgive me my thinking, i'm trembled from too much exhaustion

here is some more


well, as i was saying, if i were the most beautiful person in the world, 
i would never have to do anything. there would be many people who would do
everything for me just to be near me. i think everyone would do everything
for me because people like to be near beautiful people and even beautiful
people would like to be near the most beautiful person in the world. i do
think there would be very many jealousies but my beauty would be so great
that everyone would just feel in awe of it and want to be close to it no
matter how it made them feel, because they would feel incredible, just
being close and able to see all that beauty. 

people would feed me and offer me things to drink and they would be the
best foods and the best drinks because everyone would want me to look my
very best all the time and a healthy diet would make me look my very best.
but there would be the most delicious foods in this diet because people
would want me to be perfectly happy all the time and i would have many
boyfriends and girlfriends and they would all share me all the time be-
cause my beauty would be such a very strong light that it would glow with
them wherever they would go and people would say, look at them glowing
from all that beauty. and they would be friends with one another and so
happily would they love each other too, but not as much, but love each
other because they would be so very happy just being near me. and you know
it would all be wonderfully warm and comfortable, being with me, because
my beauty would be inner beauty too.

Folds, Pleats, and Ribbons


There are three people who know all of java.
There are one hundred seventy people who know every unix command.
Every perl command is known by approximately thirteen hundred people.
Four people understand all of c++.
Alan, what is the point of this. 
For there are many who understand english, but few who comprehend it.
Once I went up a mountain looking for a hermit; I found a hermit looking
for a mountain. Where is Yamaki, said the hermit. 
It was then I knew what the mountain knew, that the hermit knew the
mountain.
He knew the paths and the pools, maps and the meadows. 
For to understand that only an extreme frenzy drives the self from the
other, in vibratory form.
You are searching for a subject, said the hermit. 
I am searching for languages, which act, which do not speak.
These languages have no subjects, said the hermit; that is their nature,
just as it is in a subject to have a nature. 
Nor do I understand; it is of the manner of clothing which takes the form
of the body, adding recompense of its own, folds, pleats, and ribbons.

Why I Can't Write Like I Used To


It's difficult to write in a loft which is being torn up. The outer wall
of the building has been buckling for years now - the building swells in a
simulacrum of pregnancy. Three layers of brick built upon subsidence
coupled with possible mortar decay, internal leaking as water/blood runs
down the internal courses. Suppurating body of the building. Ectoderm and
mesoderm asunder. So the three layers have to be removed entirely and a
new wall put into place.

The building would collapse without internal support; this is under con-
struction. A heavy temporary wall is placed three feet in from the current
one (which is about twenty-five feet long); the loft-side of the latter
had to be cleared of cabinets, bookshelves, light fixtures, and so forth,
since it will be torn out and replaced. The cabinets are now piled front
to back at the foot of the bed; the books are piled everywhere; there is
hardly space to move. Dust is everywhere - demolition dust - human mite
dust - dead rodent dust - cockroach dust - and it's been necessary to use
an inhaler to breathe at all. When I'm not taking antihistamines I'm
breathing medical mist. So I can't concentrate hello who are you, you are
who said hello, and writing becomes a moment of holding on to the margins
of the building. Which is only temporary; I estimate seven weeks to the
four then five then six offered by the construction company. It's love
in the temporary ruins, just as more enduring violence occurs in another
part of the world perhaps forty-four hundred miles away.

Well, this is the turn in the narrative as many of us online tend towards
thoughts of war and peace lying heavy over everything. As if there were a
permanence to the war, as if there were an obligation. And this building
with its triple course of bricks is now surrounded by a scaffolding to
protect those troops on the ground waiting for the bus to come by. You can
see it from a distance in the form of a grey rectangle, the application of
cement in an orgy of final fortification.

it's a dirty hole that the loft has become in my mind, teetering between a
perfect refusal of beauty in escapades to the elements and the detritus of
the decay of teeth and gums rubbed against those elements of the curb
heading towards illness. what a home is, space that is thoughtless and of
perfect transparency, the bone of the body. what is here, the exposure of
the tumor which, for one last fling, that decay within the brick itself,
is a declaration of buildings falling down, a category or synopsis. in
cyberspace one might have erasure, sudden disappearance of a database:
there you go, there's nothing to hold onto. yesterday, they said, don't
bother with the door and hallway, the door won't be there. i said, well,
people might hide in the hallway. they said, don't worry, there won't be 
a hallway either.

it is a weakness of mine to write couplets, not facticity:
oh there may be a distinction or there may not be:
all these terms already shorn of their long hair,
placed within the discomfiture of a porcelain mortar:
but this is a land of extreme enervations,
and there is an enormous doorknob, very subtle sounds of clicking

a cylinder:
i am waiting for survival

1.

Beginning with a world, W, which is a site of a world, that is, a moment
of inscription, ripples expanding - or a sign or bracket or eidetic re-
duction of a world, or a signifier foreclosing upon itself as an experi-
ment - then I continue within that inscription, which is this and any
other - therefore a wobbling. And it is clear that W has a certain style,
that is to say, there is a style to the world, a tenor, which is of the
order of a meander, or following. So I would begin with that tenor, that
certain style, noting in passing, all that I can say, which is that the
world has this tenor, the site of this writing, of my positioning, which
is expansive, rippling across or through an implicate order, which will
do, as if in the manner of holography.

Such is the potential well of W, that this writing resists, impedes, re-
mains, at least for the length of time to establish itself within a mes-
sage base. Such impediments present the appearance of entities undergoing
change, one might say continuous change - change among bases. It is here
that in my work something similar to category theory appears - bases and
transformations among them, all cohering to a certain style - and I can
speak of a kernel or unity possessing certain properties within and with-
out these bases: look, as Weyl said, to the automorphisms for the struc-
ture. But I would also say, look towards the ontological claims and in-
variants of the message bases for the tenor. And it would immediately be-
come clear that many of the bases are mutually incommensurate; such, for
example, might be the imaginary in relation to the symbolic, the world of
dreams appearing mediate, as a router searching backwards and forwards for
the proper addressing.

I may create graphs representing states of entities, with each node char-
acterizing a different state. Or there may be tree diagrams, representing
causal or possible linkages from a given state. Finally, it is possible to
relate an _internal_ graph of an entity - its imminent transformations -
to an _external_ graph representing the relationships between these trans-
formations. And there is in either case a hierarchy of such graphs which
represent a turn of consciousness towards the entity, which is also the
construct of the entity. These layers relate to Bateson's learning levels,
for example.

Think of the external graphs as mappings from the states of one graph onto
the nodes of another, and think of the state representation graphs as com-
plete and internal. Think of the former including noise, 'foreign' graph
elements, redundancies. Think of the latter as integral to the definition
of an entity.

There is resonance with the position of the letter and the word, as well
as the rooting of the letter and the word within consciousness; I would
not have entities without the designation of contours and contrast algo-
rithms. The rooting of the letter is inextricably phonemic, related to
drives, chora, rupture, and the landscape of the imaginary; it is as well
the pressure of the finger on the eyes, delirious figuration, stutterings,
ectoplasms, emanants, emanations. Again it is as well the expulsion of the
breath from the body, the inhalation and exhalation of the world and its
admixing. The byproduct of the letter is the word; syntax is an energy.
There are both couplings and linkages at work, the former referencing a
certain form of contiguity in which the transformation of one element need
not affect the others - and the latter, in which there are chain processes
across all elements whenever one is affected.

It is the couplings of letters that result in the differential order of
the symbolic, and it is the linkage with the real that tends towards sym-
pathetic magic and fetishization. Both couplings and linkages may be rep-
resented within external or internal graphs; the latter obey a rule of
conservation of tokens (political economy) and the former, a rule of jos-
tling and decoupling (Bataille's economy of surplus accumulation).

I think of _primary processes_ of couplings and linkages integral to
graphs; these graphs represent _exchange-strata_ and operate within and
without threshold logics. I think of _secondary processes_ of inscription
and perceptual processing, contour enhancement, the transformation of the
letter to the word, the word to its full semantic and syntactical embodi-
ment.

Couplings and linkages are subject to _fissuring,_ the division of the
same by the same, the gnawing of substance at construct. Graphs are sub-
ject to _inscription,_ the division of one by the other, or division of
one by the one, the construct of entity from substance.

In this manner, language and phenomena, are intertwined; phenomena with-
out language are intertwined; language without phenomena are cursor-bound
dream-screens of the imaginary real.

2.

W is a seizure; the world is coma. To think the world is dis-ease; there
is no uncoupling. By the most tenuous of threads... Holography, the grain,
constructs defuge, the paste broken by inscription. Dis-ease is that of
the abject, the world internal and external, broken graphs; one can never
rid oneself. Everyone exercises; nothingness as in the rest is linked. A
link shudders when an element shudders. A coupling never says goodbye;
elements remain in ignorance. Consider this an opening to the text stum-
bling across vocality. To write of the world which is always already pros-
thetic, such writing +ill+ at ease.

says the sign outside the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens where Simon and I
wander into the Japanese portion, only to face mono no aware, this sad-
ness and pathos of wabi and sabi at the torii from which hangs a single
bird at the edge defining the elder meaning; I had not realized in the
distance the presence of a shrine itself, abandoned, emptied internally -
none of the resident kami, but then in the midst of Crown Heights' edge -
what would I expect, none of the shintai; by now you recognize I do not
know any of this but the red-orange colour of the torii burns into the
trailings of Grand Army Plaza coupled with grey-green bronze patina rococo
shields, horses, and soldiers above the arch; I'm here in the tea house,
there are turtles and carp, the festival is even ever after the double-
blossoming cherry have lost their bloom this early-warning-warming year.
