 What I'd like to do is present specfic texts through your text, which
 means we'd take turns; when I write single lines they tend to get lost.
 I've also been working with video overlay but I'm not satisifee with that
 and might take it out altogether. I'd want as much of the 'Tibetan' and
 'mantra' to come through as possible. We have an hour so we can go slow,
 we don't have to present things quickly; I can even change sound
 mid-stream. The idea relates to the competion and generation stages of
 Tibetan tantra, constructing the deity, which inolves illusion and empty
 space and negation. I could see repeating a mantra repeatedly for a while
 with nothing else - I'll be on two machines; Julu Twine is very heavy
 particle-producing -
 
 sitting's important and using those longer mocap sequences I've got, as

[2012/12/21 15:10]  Julu Twine: The signifier's not in the place of pain except for the observer; for the
 person undergoing (severe) pain, there is no place at all: that's the
 numbness. The signifier's the report; the distance between the report and
 the pain is also painful...
[2012/12/21 15:10]  Howl Yifu: shouts: The first diagram should be described on a hhurjja- patra with gorocham and the name of the woman desired, should be written in it

[2012/12/21 15:10]  Julu Twine: I would say it is beyond reading or non-reading to realize that the
 emptiness of all signifiers. Every reading fictionalizes this, tells a
 story of it, but it is only in non-reading that I really approach the
 alterity of your pain.
 
 So, I agree that for the person undergoing the pain there is no place; I
 would go further: it is this inarticulate boundary that concerns me. The
 signifier of pain as your pain - can I feel this? Only as reversibility,
 as my pain (which in a Cartesian sense I would see as like your pain)?
 
 As reader or receiver, I can push reading to impossible limits. I can
 strip everything away from the report of the pain, every connotation,
 every signification, to the point where I touch at the incised flesh of
 the signifier and find the continuous flesh of the world, the great
 surface where we all feel. And here it is no longer your pain / my pain.
 Here signification is a kind of perturbation, wherein pain and pleasure
 blur and float, pleasurepain.
[2012/12/21 15:10]  Howl Yifu: shouts: mathematical ontology and its dynamics (in the sense of mathesis) constitute the=basis for our world, our multiverse: every domain is entangled.

[2012/12/21 15:12]  Julu Twine: I think, I think the beyond where "I feel your pain" no longer is
 determined by the symbolics of intersubjective communication is Levinas'
 "beyond being," or also, I think, these are the encounters that Lingis
 writes of. This phrase "I feel your pain" implies such a beyond. I mean: I
 must feel your pain even in the absence of the signifier (and it will be
 absent, it is absent). Impossibly so, since pain is always pain for you,
 for the one incised. I must feel impossible pain. (I would say this
 relates to love as well.)
 
 Not sure I'm going anywhere.
[2012/12/21 15:13]  Howl Yifu: it's true, i became subdued, i relaxed on the divan,, i smoked a joint and held a coors in the other hand, i'm challaxing i'm slave to you ready to turn over, role over for whatever you want whatever whatever
