engorged, never devoured, never devouring. The gate-keepers float, it was 
absolutely gorgeous today. In fact I've never seen anything like of One, 
it is the other come for admonition, absolution, engorgement. Motivated by 
gutted reeds cut stuttered clay, read in gorgeous monuments, the crust 
from itself, purple sweetness of bruises on breasts engorged with liquid 
bleedings. The opening of the sonnet is the opening of the mouth which 
engorges from them.

They're _all_ in this pattern, engorge/disgorge: the _anorectic future,_

mouth's engorged, her genitals swollen, her frock and in their currency, 
in 2010, we're engorged with her, eyes blasted from world burns. The 
Engine burns, swells, disgorges; it is the world returned Engorged. You

Now gougings, gnawed of living words, these phrases engorged, descended 
from crags and split-swollen engorged spew of letters, oh grateful! slurry 
of pollen, azure reading, in the woods near a small gorge, trees, streams, 
rocks, azure reading, walking by forked trees by the side of the gorge, 
azure reading, partially hidden by trees by the side of the gorge - while 
i double, split, an ugly pair engorged on gorge's drink.

topple, it topples disgorges; it is the world returned to vomit. The

Spray


(as far as I know 1st internet-text dated post specifically to Cybermind & 
for Lawrence Upton who edited some textual confusion of mine re: "9. 
Therefore I produce as well st-* texts, which stutter, stumble, shudder, 
sputter, and so forth, texts simultaneously within "jouissance," anxiety, 
"frisson". (st-VC^2, "st," vowel, doubled consonant, referencing an entire 
category of words, which may go back to the origin of Indo-European words 
describing the oscillating, arousal, and contamination of an organism.)")

**********************

Date: Sat, 2 Jul 1994 01:41:57 -0400 (EDT)
From: Alan Sondheim <sondheim@panix.com>
Subject: Chatter



SPRAY


The relationship between chaotic distributions and a totalized phys-
ical source of emission is prominent in a class of words character-
ized by the format [<s><C1><V><C2C2><er>] as in the following
list: _stutter, stammer, scatter, shudder, shatter, spatter, sputter,
skitter, splatter,_ etc. (_Scanner_ inverts the series, _spackle_ and
_simmer_ transform it.)

A second similar form produces: _spew, skid, scud, spot, spit,
split,_ etc. These forms are constructed around a _lateral topo-
graphy,_ a laminar spray distributing over a more or less wide and
irregular domain. The spray possesses a phenomology of dissolution
and disruption; it also exists on the fuzzy interface between
interior and exterior, and hence involves abjection.

In every instance, the body is compromised laterally, a veering from
side to side, or the stammer from the region of the throat. Some-
thing is _withdrawn_ violently from the organism, which convulses.
Convulsions shatter, fragment.[1]

The lock-up of the terminal screen in Net communications is the
result of packet flow; email appears from everywhere; interrupts are
common; the Net harbors impeded laterality. Better to consider it a
convulsive body as well, the neural interconnectivity of nodes
serving as obstructed gateways choked with binary debris. The body
migrates to the edge of consciousness, received and processed by
one or another correspondent who circumscribes the messaging,
returns it to the relative fulfillment of sense.

The return occurs within an insriptive domain, part and parcel of
a potential well where meaning is construed. Within the well,
meaning develops the ontological being of language; without it,
meaning sputters, its attributive scattered among the remnants of
indirect addressing.

Only the shuddering of the human shatters the human; the human
stammers or stutters its way through debris scattered across the
splattered or spotted landscape. Deep within the throat the
promise of a primitive root is murmured or mumbled. Culture con-
structs itself upon the elimination of debris; the abject, now
gathered within the shamanistic fetish for the expulsion of male-
volent spirits, echos in the hiss of the cat or snake. These
animals are regarded with awe; they hold the mirror to culture
itself, the thin veneer of language and civilization binding us
to the symbolic. The hiss is imaginary; having no meaning whatso-
ever, it holds the meaning of the world. There are no boundaries
or borders, beyond what we make of them. There is no language
beyond our speech of it.

[1] See *Art Papers* 1/2 1994, "Throat: Leslie Thornton's _The
Great Invisible_": "_In the film,_ speaking is caught in the maw,
glottal stop, Edison and the _mechanical_ insignia of existence.
Early [20th-century] representations [of movement] operated with
mechanism throughout [as in the mechanics of the melodrama]; they
stuttered. Repetitive pistons and cams moved locomotives and film;
intermittent motion is translated into rotary motion and back
again. Throughout the century, mechanism gives way to electricity,
which gives way to the electronic, cyberspace and beyond. Thought
leaves the material domain" ...

If _beings_ are mechanism, _Being_ occupies an uneasy territory.
Aristotle stumbled through the part-objects of a generalized symp-
tomology of the world and Pliny followed suit. But organism never
spoke clearly and _always_ stammered; the hiss of steam, the
volcanic fissure, and the cat are _identical_.

Measurement and Ethos 


Give the Schrodinger's cat paradox, think of the mixed state as the trag- 
edy of the commons which ultimately reproduces itself through capital 
accumulation. What should be taken as the constituents of the wave equa- 
tion tending towards the sudden collapse with a particular eigenvalue. 
Wave towards state, spread over E3 space towards specificity of value. Set 
judgment equivalent to measurement. The field of behavior, environmental, 
particle, cultural, human, tends towards those moments of relative inter- 
ference. Measurement is performance judgment; the human sutures, closes in 
upon itself, defends itself. The wave equation collapses, the commons is 
bought out. Environmental factors of scale surely play a role; a murderer 
is punished as a result of the collapse of a nearly=decomposable hierar- 
chy, a moment in time when the bullet flies, the knife slips, burned into 
the genidentical four-space of an organism. Measurement is presumed, 
stated, neutral; judgment is presumed measurement, according to the law, 
i.e. according to the justice of an N-dimensional manifold and its fields. 
What mixes in the real cat, mixes in the law; what mixes in physical 
description is accompanied by a disclaimer, i.e. 'not a real cat,' which 
is part of the description. Nature abhors a vacuum but abhors as well the 
many-worlds approach of continuous splitting; it's messy, as is absolute 
and total relativism. Just as physics possesses no intrinsic ethos, ethos 
possesses no physics. Morality is situation- and ethos-dependent, event 
and law. Experiment is theory- and measurement-dependent, event and world. 
World and law, Law, are orthogonal, disconnected; to measure is not to 
adjudicate, but measure is to adjudicate. The stakes and foundation-spaces 
are orthogonal. Given culture, every judgment is orthogonal to itself, 
self-orthogonal, totalizing and split. Physics and ethos are entangled at 
the level of the cat; it is the cat that is at stake, dragging quantum and 
cultural theories with it. Both approaches reside within language; law 
pretends towards the exactitude of physics, with insipid results. Both 
tend as well towards mechanism: beam-splitters versus the panopticon, 
collapse of wave-functions (coupled) with incarcerations. Neither cat nor 
prisoner escape. In a hyperreal sense we are both; therein lies the 
paradox.


Collapse


When the wave-function collapses as a result of measurement, a quantum 
state results, for example cat-lives | cat-dies. What was entangled sud- 
denly takes itself elsewhere, to a value in the everyday world, a value 
that affects us, an effect. Knowledge unmoving, but knowledge given across 
solar systems, galaxies! What happens if an alien intelligence measures a 
pale - look, the experiment's hijacked! But we don't know this, we're 
doing, what, measuring away here, but we're the second? Meanwhile else- 
where, an observer watches... nothing... Disappointment! The experiment 
has failed! He makes a phone-call; it takes hours! What then? Perhaps the 
alien is just... barely conscious... on the order of a gastropod... a 
paramecium... Something just nudges the apparatus, perhaps not even paying 
attention... Perhaps it sends a signal back to us! Yes, well-done! A 
signal hijacked from the other observer! Wait, it gets worse! It's not 
conscious at all, just a pebble! Something falls, but since it's almost 
gravity-free, a level has become loose, perhaps the rockets... It slides 
slightly, what then? The button is pushed, we get a signal, the elsewhere 
observer gets nothing, we don't know we've gotten a signal, we've gotten 
nothing, we think we've gotten nothing, we think the other observer gets 
the other state, a different state - wait a minute, there's no response... 
We're on earth, a sunny day, we're waiting here, or circling the earth, 
replete with waves, acoustic, electromagnetic, the space-station shudders, 
the sun shortly disappears behind the earth atmosphere, just for a minute 
or two, a please twilight, my mind goes back to a walk in an Appalachian 
forest, somewhere in Virginia, we're holding hands, now she's so far away, 
elsewhere with her measuring, waiting, nothing is happening, did he forget 
me? I'm on the station, memory collapses, wait, I'll measure now, the 
first, just as I'm supposed to! A clean value, if yes here, no there, and 
if no there, yes here! But I hear nothing! Still, the situation seems 
clear enough, isn't it? A cliff, collapse, is produced, big entropy 
change, memories disperse, I'm focused now, waiting for her response! 
Nothing ever comes, the alien, slug, paramecium, lever, shuffles along, 
walks away, flies out, shifts, it doesn't matter. Has the world split? Of 
course not! It's the same old world! Think of the economy of multiple 
universes! But then in quantum cosmology, value's elsewhere, hardly 
calculated, split, split, and no split, it can go on forever...

Analog has moved to digital value, but where? Why? From whom? At what 
cost? Just how exact? Perhaps there's an error, perhaps there's a leak, a 
short-circuit, an alien...

Another run at it -


Consider the wave function collapse from the viewpoint, not of a cat or 
(dis)interested observer but from that a music producer. The analogic is 
devolves into one of two modes, say, either Y or N. Consider a continuous 
production of particles and close to continuous measurement. The result is 
a series of Ys, Ns. Consider this a code or a mapping, which it is not; it 
is probabilistic most likely, Bohm notwithstanding. Then say {Yn,Nm} or 
some such represents the resulting series. Let Band1 = {Yn,Nm}, then Band1 
is the first sound-track on the new Schrodinger CD. Now Band1 only roughly 
reproduces the music of course, which is collapsed from the bandwidth. It 
seems irrelevant to ask about the Khz of this new recording, but we might 
set up the entire experiment in order to create Band1, Band2, at any Khz. 
The question might be, what are we listening to? The question might be, 
what does Band1 represent or in other words, how well does it represent 
the original music? Band1 is the music. Band 1 is random. Is it white 
noise? Does it require encoding? Collapse the spikes to a spectrum; 
listen. With the beam-splitter, send part of the wave elsewhere. Then one 
might speculate as to alien intervention. This is a way for an alien to 
accompany or construct music here on earth. Or rather, to interfere. But 
of course it is random, and no one or nothing (alien, observer here, 
observer there) has anything to say about it or through it. It is hardly a 
signature, is it?

We'll never know definitively if the observer elsewhere has received the 
signal. The alien is good at mimickry. The alien perhaps hasn't interfered 
and hasn't measured. But she sends a signal, it takes years. She says, 
What did you receive? The local observer says Y or N; the alien, aha! I 
knew it. This goes on and on. Collect those Ys! Then they're the result of 
production, of non-production, they're the result of entanglement, they're 
the result of nothing at all. I'm lost here, forgive me. I want to make a 
song, I want to call it Band1, from Schrodinger. Forgive me.

I wander up and down in my father's caravan.
The camels are old   they are laden with wine and cloth
And the ground yes the ground is stony and hard to traverse
The camels move and I   I work back across the limits
from one end to the other covering double the distance perhaps
Perhaps covering half   or now a slow wave my father's caravan
and I walking   the route of the stony ground

""Ankara is a wife, Istanbul a mistress"" (Murat) that is to say
Ankara geveret Istanbul isha    no that is incorrect, it means
nothing in no language    I walk back against the dark order

the cliffs

Between them there is a woman

Among them a woman  More and more is forgotten   the brass

Cat taC


Set up the Schrodinger experiment as before. The cat-space contains food, 
a cat-box, water, a place to sleep, all comfort comforting. Conduct the 
experiment. Wait two weeks, check the result, then open the box. The cat 
is either dead or alive. What about the cat? If the cat has died, surely 
it would have died with the arrival of the particle. Naturally the cat 
would have decayed. If the measurement implies consciousness, then 
consciousness is retroactive, an absurdity. If the cat is alive, the same. 
Say it is the consciousness of a cat; use a plant, with lights, water, a 
happy atmosphere. If dead, then wilted; if alive, the same. Conduct the

anything for some stability. i want to continue to live here. i'm a mess. 
everything is changing. we are going away for three and a half months. 
almost four months. our cat will be left behind. where is my daughter, my 
father, where are my closest friends. i know how to walk anywhere here 
with my eyes closed. i want to work on my essays. i'm too tired. i want to 
think clearly. i dream of a clean white university like a pure white room 
with space for writing and students at the door. i dream of conversations 
well into the night and a community of thinkers and advancements i could 
never have conceived on my own. i think of adequate health-care and no 
more stress or insomnia or pains or those troubles which tender an early 
death. in the white room where there is health care and good meals and 
azure and i take walks in the bracken and it is in the middle of new york 
city and there is the latest and greatest coming down the street marching 
down the street and every street in fact. i am a misspent and 
misconfigured life and a life that has missed down to the very root of 
things. i want to wake up and not feel desperate just for a day an hour 
just for a minute. i want to keep despair to keep age illness death at the 
door. do not mind me if i die but not at the door not at the door of the 
white room while we travel across the country in a high speed old car and 
crash somewhere outside nebraska before kansas after utah below montana to 
the right of ohio to the left of arkansas. we will survive and we will be 
stable and just as now and computers and cameras will scatter furiously 
and disappear in this most unstable of dreams i cannot leave and which is 
killing me. i am always in a state of mourning a continuous state of 
mourning and when did i begin to write in run on sentences as if the comma 
were another prison. there is mourning and there is mourning and it is yet 
the nature of depression to mourn for the smallest things the tiniest 
things in the world as if the world were in the constancy of failure which 
it is. we ignore the world to breathe and if we saw the world with the 
clarity of true and proper vision we would back fall in a false swoon the 
breath gone out from us. we would back fall because we would unstable 
because the world would sadden and unstable us. oh for a stable world for 
a white room where i can think even just for a moment even the slightest 
thought. of which this is not one. of which this could not possibly be 
one. or could it, i just don't know.

Note towards a foundational phenomenology of analogic/discrete 'domains.'


Until we understand the deep ontological and epistemological issues invol- 
ving the analogic and discrete (digital), we will get nowhere.

It must be within the wave equation and its collapse that the solution to 
these conceivable orders will be found. 

Measurement = judgment, culture; the collapse is to the discrete. Wolfram 
remains there; the wave equation and its ontology otherwise; Penrose on 
the cusp of the dialectic; Hawking dismisses the problem through positiv- 
ism. But the orders remain such, effloresce on the level of the life-world 
where the digital exists under the aegis of fabrication, and the analogic 
prohibits the jump-cut outside of mental phenomena.

Certainly it is within the collapse of the wave equation that the phenom- 
enology of consciousness, the abstract and the physical, meet. Contradic- 
tions appear almost across the board. Each tugs at the other.

One is unwilling to give up the primacy of the physical because of its 
immensity. It is difficult, even from a platonic viewpoint, to comprehend 
the immensity of the abstract as well - it pales by comparison. As for 
consciousness, it seems the weakest of all, certainly the most fragile. It 
is within consciousness that the annihilation and creation of historical 
memory occur.

There are no events in the abstract. Consciousness and the physical are 
temporal; the physical and the abstract describe spaces; consciousness and 
the abstract describe networks. Within consciousness, from the network to 
the membrane. Within the physical, from spacetime to its incoherence. And 
within the abstract, axiomatics to their dissolution.

Mathesis tends towards rounding and the discrete (digital); consciousness 
tends towards sharpening and the analogic; the physical world collapses 
among them.

Perhaps the collapse is incomprehensible in terms of a unifying theory. I 
agree with Penrose that both U and R are real physical processes. (I have 
no proof of this of course; it _fits._) In any case measurement brings out 
the artifactual nature of the digital, as well as the choice of variables, 
tolerances, apparatus, etc., and all in relation to background noise.

Thinking gets to the bottom of everything. Thinking gets to the bottom of 
nothing; it is both full, replete, and absent.

To think _fully_ the a/d divide/continuum (along with this infinite reg- 
ress) is to assume familiarity with mathematical physics, phenomenology, 
engineering, neurophysiology, as well as philosophy, aesthetics, computer 
science. Without these backgrounds, analysis remains on the level of life- 
world phenomena, the symptomatic. As the symptomatic expands, so does the 
metaphoric superstructure; before long, one is off and running in any 
number of useless directions as image builds on image. This is the wave 
part of the phenomenon; the collapse is absent as testability recedes. My 
personal danger is to avoid confusion on one hand, and these metaphoric 
ruminations as anything but fantasy, on the other.

There are also the results in microsound, in digital audio reproduction, 
in compression algorithms and raster scans at the limits, in the mathe- 
matics of human cognition, in cellular automata. Expansion frays at the 
edges; nothing is achieved. Just as confusion is the result of metaphoric 
expansion, it is also the result of an efflorescence of roots.

( And it's in codework that the mix of analogic and discrete 'ordering,' 
with resulting 'broken' image and imaginary, that the aesthetics of 
expansion and collapse - of metaphor and binary for example - plays out. 
In this sense all communication among organisms, participates in signal 
and emotional contexting, reduction and aura.

Gestalt is both surplus and reduction. The inhabiting of text is analogic, 
no matter the discrete (ascii, tcp/ip) elements (protocols) at work. 
Between inhabitation and the seizure of the symbol lies anxiety, dis/com- 
fort, the political.

The collapse of the wave equation, Penrose's U -> R, Bell's theorem, 
_bother_ us. Communication leaks; the mechanics transform (in Irigarayan 
terms) from fluid to mechanical to the uneasy gnawing of a _mix._ Think of 
Kristeva's abject for example, or Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel's work. Think 
of a kind of transitional object carrying the all-too-evident seeds of 
decay within it, the teddy-bear leaking stuffing.

The bothering is political; we would do anything to erase it! Purity, the 
sensual absence of corruption, is primary to governance, where, for 
example, justice is forced into equivalence with law.

One should learn from the R Yes|No measurement that decision, at the 
bottom, is independent. 'The best-laid plans of mice and men often go 
astray'; and are _inherently_ astray. They are never plans until observed 
- when the secret's out. Code hides and reveals, checksumming a relative 
assurance of purity. Beyond that, there is nothing but plasma analogic, 
and the digital grave. )

....A./D.


...Analog digital / analog discrete, but also Anno Domini; one can only 
point out that linear time from 0 moves through both negative and positive 
numbers; the years are integers, the continuum backgrounded. A/D: Monothe- 
ism's gift, this or that, before or after; A/D: the continuum of time 
re/produced as discrete. The year 0 of our lord, the year 1 of our lord. 
This is the trouble with religions or ideologies with monolithic and 
linear narratives apparently grounded in specific and human events - 
everything proceeds like a white hole out of them. Of course every system, 
however broken, has its accountancy; I am punning here on A./D., the 
ferociousness of this division, and from the viewpoint of believers - as 
if humankind were waiting for this, the insertion of our lord into 
history, breaking history, remaking the codex of dates. Islam is similar.
With monotheisms it's all gone bad; the fabrication carries a suspect 
political ideology, as if the world has waited for year 0 and the 
insertion of a related temporal framework. This is what happens when 
there's a guy - Jesus or Mohammed or whomever - involved. The construct of 
absolute time is equivalent to absolute negative and positive, right or 
wrong. Clearly history doesn't start or end with the guy, so one counts 
forwards and backwards from him. But he's there as a stopper, 
transformation, wave equation collapse, as deadly as Schrodinger's cat 
might be.

Somewhere Weyl wrote about the last vestige of the self/ego in physics - 
the Cartesian origin. The guy hangs out there, claims the origin for 
himself/itself, refuses to recognize the tensor algebra of the thing which 
isn't a thing. It's be-all and end-all for him. Time begins, marches 
forward or backward, a permanent light-cone. The rest are its children.

( Note that this absolute time is _finite,_ that it begins and ends, that 
the origin is _historical._ And note that so many other systems portend a 
creation behind/beyond which numeracy was non-existent; the numbers begin 
in mythic time. So there are configurations that are lost in essence - not 
a guy hanging out, as if known by one and all. There's always the problem 
of the divine with historical time; mythos turns to miracles, Jesus doing 
this or that, almost like a party. Three and one is one by the way; for 
any absolute finite X here, X -> 1, I believe it is called a _kernel._ )

Why I am narrow.

I am narrow, minded; it is difficult to follow any stream, much less any 
particular stream, of thought. On an analog/digital forum I have been 
reading, there was already a worry expressed, take the division and run 
with it as if something were being said/done. It's on the edge/verge of 
nonsense. To be strict with oneself is to mine the sememe, abandon it in 
large part. What's left is practically non-existent. For example, issues 
of raster: increase the digital raster to the infinitely, small and create 
an identity map - that seems simple enough. But then quantum effects come 
into play - in fact the wave equation collapse enters here as well. Back 
out and try the other - the digital to the infinitely large. Then one has 
monotheism, totality. Try from the analog side - nothing occurs. Surely 
one integrates the digital to arrive at the analogic, but to begin with 
the analogic? To differentiate it? This might map, but then there is still 
the question of the raster. The raster? The question of the wave equation 
again. Try the abacus. Base 1: counting, enumeration, matching one-to-one. 
Base infinite: each number a symbol, memorization of ideograms (English 
spelling, kanji). But given infinite memory in the latter, zero memory in 
the former, they are both procedural; it's just that in the latter, 
nothing carries.

This goes on and on. So far so good, these are abacuses, objects counted, 
not too much out of line. If metaphor's involved, it's indexical. But then 
perhaps I bring in libido (Dionysian, analogic) and superego (Apollonian, 
digital), and I'm off and running. Before long I'm tied in Lacan's knots, 
a slippage that's always productive - how can it knot be? Language begins 
to curl, everything proceeds with a poetics of the real, and I'm lost, I'm 
lost...


Subject: Thai Calendar

The Thai Calendar is from the time of Buddha. My Netscape in OS9 won't let 
me cut and paste, anyway - it's the Thai solar or Suriyakati calendar - 
"The year however is counted from the Buddhist Era (B.E.) which is 543 
years earlier than the Christian Era (A.D.)." - Alan

So here is a split from an historical figure.

Can one say there are three types of calendars -

0 -> X, in which the origin only goes forward (i.e. from creation)
-X -> 0 -> X, in which an historical figure marks a zero point origin in 
historical time which is registered in terms of negative and positive 
integers
0 -> A(n) B(n') C(n'') in which emperor or other eras A, B, C, are locally 
enumerated by n, n', n'' - note in this case, there's a presumed origin 
which may or may not be of the first or second type above (i.e. an emperor 
may be at the origin of a mythical creation, or an emperor can be only the 
delineation of the beginning of imperial time)

I'm not sure where this gets us/me, whomever - but I'm fascinated by these 
systems, and the relation they have to monotheisms and/or historical 
lineages - Alan

charm


we're barreling down the highway it's late at night
headlights towards us veering is it us or them
we can't tell who's awake one direction or the other
there's no time like in the duel to think
we smashed against the rail just a second in midair
falling and hardly breathing before everything disappears
we've got a truck to the left of us throwing things
first small than larger than screaming slamming against us
we've got a small car we can't fight them off we spin
we slalom crashing over the edge we're in midair
just like in easy rider we're dead along the highway
i'm driving sleeping i'm seeing double seeing lamposts bend
everything filtered and shaky i can't think what's that now
the radio's off the radio's on i don't know the difference
is it you talking or me wait you're not moving
i'm not moving the world turns fast suddenly it's all over
we're rounding a bend furious lightning sudden crack
we're startled slide into the traffic down the embankment
just like in crash we're jammed and careening no stopping us
brakes give out no nothing eighteen wheels coming up fast
no stopping them we're crushed beneath no moving now
motor halts we're hard slammed through the windshield
my throat's cut i can't see anything where are you
we're hurt screaming the car's heaped on top us
night the rain the search dead cell phone we're out of luck
the pedal won't ease up we're out of control skidding
hailstorm shattered glass i swerve too fast
engine light's on gaslight oil light brakelight too
we're bullet hurtling night we've got all day
to get there
