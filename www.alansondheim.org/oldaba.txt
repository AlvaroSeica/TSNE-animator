Millennium bring plentitude anywhere, our bellies full of packets, our
minds full of food.

Once More, with the Usual Feeling


He's going to do it again, there will be some dismemberment, said Jenni-
fer, said Julu, he's got all these attributions of talk, no one's really
saying anything, he's trite, talking to himself, repetitious, it just goes
on and on. Someone throws a bowling ball, said Alan, and down goes Julu.

Someone said something about being really tired and hadn't they heard that
before, anyway, those who were left? People left the reading "in droves,"
although Nikuko (kill her!) had no idea how many that was. We're all tired
said Doctor Leopold Konninger; Nikuko, the "famous Russian ballet dancer"
(as if we didn't know!), was unable to wind down. Alan thought the narra-
tive demanded this continuous state of being-in-motion on one hand, and
the Doctor Leopold, on the other, rather static and uncomfortable in his
wooden chair on the wooden floor.

For all I know, said Jennifer, a vowel change is imminent. It's a way of
avoiding content, making a whole lot of noise. At this point the noise has
become a signifier or trademark of Alan as well. It's as if everything
conspires to guarantee the singularity of one text, written over and over
again, each version equally correct, coherent, well-written, more or less,
but without any sort of advance. Doctor Leopold Konninger, who came to me
in a dream, said, Alan, concurs; I'm obsessed by these texts, I can't stop
the texts, but it's almost as if they stop me.

A quotation from an obscure source, always askew to the point, "They will
come for me, / their faces screened, / mouth-banners high, silk carvings /
in or around the square shrine. / They will come for me, / banners of grey
faces, / dusk-cloths, embrochures of stone / in or around the square
shrine. / Follow the earth's fold, / wary of legs caught in crevices, / in
the air of autumn, / in the autumn air."

He's going to do it again, these stupid stupid voices, these broken limbs,
blind flutterings about the womb. He's going to keep on going, they're
massive, they're useless, they're glued together by a constant intensity,
the repetition of a monologue insistent on building the world from word.
His interest in programming is 'peculiar,' the minor satisfaction of out-
put to some extent not his own - but he short-circuits this by insisting
on writing his own. Everywhere, his own. His tentacles, Jennifer, Julu,
Nikuko, Alan, his own. His blunt texts, his own. Doctor Leopold Konninger
resists any temptation towards either the analytic or the therapeutic, and
Doctor Leopold Konninger has killed.

On Number-Systems


"And reading Knuth on number-base systems which include, for example a
ternary system with +1, -1, and 0 as the symbols. Such systems can absorb
the positive and negative numbers; there are others, such as ones based on
2i, that can absorb the complex number system as well (i.e. a single num-
ber of the form ax^n + bx^(n-1) ... +dx^1 +e). This is an amazing economy
of means. The book is my favorite in the Knuth programming series - the
volume on Seminumerical Algorithms - since it goes into the construct of
arithmetic processes and algorithms we all take for granted. In my own
work, I've always been fascinated by the possibility of base-1 and base-
infinity systems; in the former, of course, addition becomes concatena-
tion, and in the latter, the addition of any two unique symbols results in
a third, i.e. J + K = L. There's an easy translation from the decimal sys-
tem; say 25 * 26 = 650 - one would just look up within the infinite multi-
plication table, [25] and [26] and see [650] where the [x] represents the
unique symbol. One goes from algorithms to infinite memorization or look-
up. The phenomenology of this is really interesting, I think. For multip-
lication with base-1, one returns again to concatenation, for example 1111
* 111 = 111 111 111 111 which is the same as 4 * 3 = 12. There's nothing
to learn in terms of memorization or lookup tables here; there's nothing
to look up or memorize. Think of this as an infinite abacus of sticks
placed in a single row; one moves from base-infinity with its pure economy
of place and infinite symbols, to base-one with its pure economy of symbol
and infinite place. This material is fascinating; it says something about
the stability of the world itself, the Aristotelian logic at the heart of
the almost-disconnected plateau of the life-world. I wrote years ago ex-
tensively on such phenomenologies; it's great to see the structures them-
selves in Knuth."* To place sticks in the row, letters in a row, one
counts (literally) on the stability of place and demarcation - _these_
sticks are counted - _those_ remain unaccounted-for and uncounted. The
sticks need not be in a row; there's no need for geometry, positioning,
since what one is concerned with is the pure quantity of sticks, not a
positional relationship. Interestingly, positionality also disappears with
base-infinity, since every operation and quantity involves only _one_ pos-
ition. In The Matrix, there is considerable discussion about "who is the
One" - in base-one, everyone is, and in base-infinity, whatever is _there_
is the one.

What is going on here? On one hand, with base-one, there is the fact and
phenomenology of _substance_ and the quantifiability and stability of the
world; on the other, with base-infinity, there is the problematic of the
proper name in the Kripkean sense of rigid designator. In the former,
names shift towards processes; in the latter, processes harden as names.

One might also consider issues of perception: exactly what constitutes a
stick or a symbol? Could, for example, two trees represent 2541 and 1734,
a third representing 2541^1734 base-infinity? Is all of nature, in fact,
the mathematics of base-infinity write large? At the other end, what might
one say about typification, standardization: What constitutes a stick and
what doesn't? Sticks are related to tallying, of course; they are indexi-
cal in relation to the quantification of the real, a one-to-one relation-
ship with other physical objects. On the other hand one might consider the
base-infinity symbols both symbolic (standing-for quantity as proper names
or summarizations) and "quasi-ikonic," the coagulation of quantity itself
as unary.

And there are issues of memory: _Where_ is the place of counting - which
sticks have already been marked, which remain unmarked? This depends not
only on the stability of place, but our knowledge of place as well. Since
base-infinity relies on individuated symbols, place, even the place of
_announcement,_ becomes less relevant; memory of place is replaced by
symbol memory: 2541^1734 = [2541^1734]

Between base-one and base-infinity, the structure and variety of the world
appear - not the infinite and obdurate variety of base-infinity, nor the
pure quantifications of base-one, but gatherings, foreclosings, metaphors
and metonymies. It's at the limits that nature becomes simultaneously mute
and revelatory; in-between it's all culture and our image writ large,
rubbed against the structure of the world.

Lecture: Natural Kinds

 
Sat Nov 6 01:07:18 EST 1999 first off, I thought of a single node with
numerous links; only one was connected, as if the others were absorbed in
it. the centrality of it, the vulnerability of the other nodes, this was a
misrecognition. i would have diagrammed this, a shimmering of the real in
which each entity is affected. Sat Nov 6 01:08:29 EST 1999 further, it had
to do with natural kinds; the question came literally to mind - is a
"natural kind" a natural kind? what sort of universals occur? for example,
think of water. Sat Nov 6 01:09:24 EST 1999 I then went to think of water.
there are names in every language, in all possible worlds, but they are
tied to water, water then remaining at the node, the shimmering of the
forms, and connectivities, node to pointer of the proper name, but this
seems insufficient. why so inefficient? let's say it has to do with data
storage, a kind of stability generated. I'd lecture on this, improvise,
continue, go ahead with all the ramifications. in my imagination, I
pictured the audience, myself pacing back and forth on the stage, gravity
taken for granted. Sat Nov 6 01:11:25 EST 1999 because the style of the
world is that it remains, its obdurate nature, that things remain
sufficiently in place for life to promulgate, memory to use devices. the
subtexts of the devices are the encodings of the real, which are stable.
it goes back, all of it, to non-equilibrium thermodynamics on ultra-fast
time-scales from within. it goes back as well to nearly-decomposable
hierarchies of the real, the impossibly slow decay, if any, of the proton,
the relative emptiness of space, our planetary luck with our collisions.
Sat Nov 6 01:13:02 EST 1999 more than that, the node as generator - all
those names. or as if the node itself generated the names, locale after
locale, their interdependencies and modification occurring on a
superstructural level, but always already connected to the real. that's
the inherent tendency of language, always - towards the real. Sat Nov 6
01:14:07 EST 1999 language of the real and towards the real; it's not
disconnect, but connect so tightly that it literally becomes unimaginable.
language and the real bound, not through parallelisms or empathies, but
through natural kinds based on hyperstable tendencies of the universe as a
whole. Sat Nov 6 01:14:59 EST 1999 fading from culture is fading from
language, returning from culture is returning from language. where the
returning or fading transforms, what teleologies, what places or spaces,
is unsolvable - there is no solution, just as there are no places and
spaces as such. Sat Nov 6 01:17:06 EST 1999 the solution is in the absence
of the solution, in spite of which, worlds work away, as with the three-
body problem - the world works, no matter the mathesis, which in our eyes,
follows suit. Sat Nov 6 01:17:33 EST 1999 the descriptions are non-imagin-
ary, unimaginable.Sat Nov 6 01:18:36 EST 1999 Sat Nov 6 01:18:36 EST 1999

Sat Nov 6 01:07:18 EST 1999 one that is realized, sensory bandwidths and
relativisms become more and less important. less important, since techno-
logical or linguistic extensions are literally that, on the deepest imag-
inable level. more important, since the relativisms point to superstruc-
turality in need of deconstruction, which can never be completed; every-
thing is equally always already in a state of fading from culture. go
where no one has ever gone before, to the deepest couplings and linkages
of the world. then you might lose your grips on natural language, as you
slip towards natural kinds. Sat Nov 6 01:18:09 EST 1999 the descriptions
are non-imaginary, unimaginable.Sat Nov 6 01:18:27 EST 1999

our friends have disappeared, one after another. listen: the phone refuses
to ring, we're not home, we might as well be: no one sees us anymore. no
one calls; people make arrangements, never follow through. it's as if we
don't exist. it's as if we're pure electric, ghosts in real life. it's as
if we're on the wrong end of language, curled in upon ourselves, foetal,
self-absorbed, self-devouring. friends have disappeared one after another.

thinking  f   i think  f a h le in the gr und in y u in me in the text.  
t day i did self-cens r after feeling cens red, having fielded a request
t  rem ve my w rk fr m a c llab rative site. it was explicit transf rmed
images, it was images, the w rk was a singular, it was the descripti n  f
c l rs in relati n t  interc urse fractally transf rmed, splayed acr ss
the b dy  r cut / inscribed,  r appearing t  be inscribed in the b dy.
what  f this, this is  nly news, n t  f great interest. there is a back-
gr und pan rama  f c untryside, yes, i was reacting t  this, imagining the
hanging  f children and w men, the hangings  f dissidents, the vi lence in
every c untryside that is settled and humanized. and i wanted t  burr w
beneath the gr und int  thickets and h ll ws and fuck crazy there, turning
my b dy inside- ut with azure's, t p l gically entwined, alm st murder us
fits am ng  utselves in the seepings  f the black earth and shad ws  f
 vergr wn trees and limbs cragged, encrusting the gr und. 

we stumble among the roots, twigs scratch us and cut us open, we grab each
other bleeding, our lips are torn, azure's breasts, my cock covered with
thorns, we're screeching beneath the surface, grabbing at o's, reinserting
them everywhere in the text, we can smell the fecund earth reproducing,
seeds growing, stems thick with syrup thrusting their leaves into our eyes
and mouths, we can't see anything, the scent is so thick.

flash flash go the images then churned and exploding across our bodies and
all colors in the glorious light and i make beauty-photographs and place
them lovingly in wonder-directory where they are desecrated and misunder-
stood WAAH WAAH! and i take my images and hide them in me and take them
away from all the people and place them on my eyes and no one can see them
and they're all i have in this great world and we scuttle back into the
undergrowth and bury the images in the black earth and we grapple each
other and there is sap pouring from our mouths

The Gully, Final Report


Tears smear dirt on our invisible faces where proper names are killed!
Other's breasts, mark ourselves all over, we feel the torn skin, our teeth
our eyes are torn by pebbles, granite occlusions, inclusions of crystal-
line tourmaline, constant tears smear dirt on our invisible faces where
proper names are killed, our dead words spike us in our throats our nip-
ples our holes, we're worms, we tunnel into the corpses, there are corpses
everywhere, this is the night of being human, what do you want from us,
leave us alone, Azure and I naked, smeared with each other and with black
earth, in the gully covered with roots, in the gully where dirt fills our
mouths and eyes, we can't see each other, we can hear them just above,
they're coming for us, we're fucking, you already know that, we bit each
other's breasts, mark ourselves all over, we feel the torn skin, our teeth
sinking into each other, there's no time, we're fucking, we can't talk,
broken fingers

hope and last fury
dead burns on skin sloughed against dirt
rope marks on necks arms cocks breasts legs

You're violated with shame!
Wait! Our eyes are torn by pebbles, granite occlusions, inclusions of
crystalline tourmaline, constant tears smear dirt on our invisible faces 
where proper names are killed and 25361 are fucked.
Use of uninitialized value at ./.julu line 130, <STDIN> chunk 8.
Last_fuck is rope marks on necks arms cocks breasts legs, in the 
black earth, proper names are killed and 25361 are fucked.
For 6 rubbled days, we have been buried
and it has taken you 4.967 minutes to speak your last ...
Crawl darkness broken fingers dirt-eaten through our eyes are torn by peb-
bles, granite occlusions, inclusions of crystalline tourmaline, constant
tears smear dirt on our invisible faces where proper names are killed!

winter logs in hokkaido

honshu incense kamogami smoke calls forth hysterias 
  and the last_time beyond the endless roll of days, 
  answering and calling forth
beyond the shame, honshu incense kamogami smoke, 
  dead words in beauty-smoke kyushu 
last_time is kitakyushu in black earth, the long_lost_time 
  and refugees and dreams and you walked for 261796 hours 
honshu incense kamogami smoke and we are still alive
for 6 days of comas, we have been dissolute and buried,
  and it has taken us 23 minutes to speak our last 
honshu incense kamogami smoke, dead words in beauty-smoke kyushu
winter logs in hokkaido, kitakyushu, moji
your hysterias, fukuoka, are outside my shame
and kitakyushu
our lost_love destroys the smoke of kitakyushu

the last of it

distance along finger tips. 
beginning over again, emerging. the translucency of skin. 
we speak to one another with our skin. the opacity of skin. 
  your love is grabbed by azure and you - 
  keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.
this is my last time here. 
these languages begin to fade. the transparency of skin. 
your shadows, pens and pencils, are outside my inherent languages.
your love destroys my languages! 
they churn dark in the valley where you huddle.
  your love is grabbed by azure and you - 
  keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.
your dead words are your pens and pencils, skin and languages? 
we speak to one another with our skin. the opacity of languages.
pens and pencils, machines.
the transparency of words, your shadows.
  your love is grabbed by azure and you - 
  keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.
