And even though the real physical world isn't written, it's full of  writing and our bodies themselves are always already written, inscribed -  full of tattoos, scars, burns, abrasions, wrinkles, salves, perfumes,  calluses, and so forth. I think it's from these things, particularly from  scars, wounds, abrasions, scrapes, etc., that language descends - that  language is first and foremost a reading of the history of the body, that  the body, the physical body, carries its own primordial memory upon it. That's important, since it's this memory, these scarrings that bind us to the earth, to the world, the analogic. The digital is constructed from that with a bit of a help from the corporate, from political economy - the digital rides and infuses political economy in fact. So there are digital standards for sampling, for encoding and decoding and checksums and so forth, and these guarantee that a parsing of the world in one part of it can be a parsing of the world in another. Think of the digital as an  extrusion, and think, even, of writing as always digital or at least  always discrete, one symbol differentiated from another, from the other,  as all of them together generate meaning within organism and consciousness, generate culture.
