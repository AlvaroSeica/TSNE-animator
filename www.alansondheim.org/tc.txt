sheaves of sources within the localhost, the net, the object, 
the theaterical screen, the history of the image, each the 
presence-control of the other, each watching among the others, 
then from different programs, I'd say different ontologies

well, yes, all within the digital and therefore these things are 
resting within dynamic files, a way to think about them, but 
beyond that, well I mean there might be changes, not within the 
files but they might be generators

I'm getting confused now, it's complicated, for one thing the 
sources range from computer to computer but there are operators 
standing by so to speak/see, gathering, augmenting, so they're 
in different places

sometimes images generated from within or fabricated from 
template which might or might not be illustration or drawn from 
memory of life, sometimes flesh and blood performers, or 
performers within the aegis of flesh and blood, what then, or 
there might be the avatar in front of it all who is constantly 
intended

but then released to the manipulated ghosts of others who 
performed the gestures given to hir, so there's an economy of 
gifts and uncanny depths at work here, or projections from 
uncanny depths, if you were there you could walk among all of 
this create your own projection, which in memory fills out, a 
sail blown by the wind, a backlit sail, you can see the sea in 
the distance, there are clouds in the sky, and from any angle

angle or angel for these beings come through any plane or solid 
that's projected, remember the dream screen, that illusion of 
theory and theoretical illusion, or the world of the book and 
other configurations, it's complicated

and we might want to look instead for bardo world generations, 
projections, and their completions, and in the long run whether 
or not we go with an ontology of emptiness makes absolutely no 
difference in this world or any other, or even within the 
illusion of a world or the illusion of emptiness itself, you're 
not really going anywhere here but the wagon seems to drive 
itself, the energy in this part of the country is most likely 
from coal or nuclear, you can't really tell from the stacks, no 
residue within or among the virtual

the figures are complicated, ctenophores, mavens of distributed 
intelligence, knots, ganglia, not the condensations we take for 
intelligence, but the displacements, that other figure forming 
the basis of dreams, these aren't dreams but the processes at 
work convey a certain similarity

and the uncanny again, then layers gleaming, none of them 
testimony of the witness, none of them speaking from volition, 
that's the diacritical always already elsewhere, increasingly 
itself embedded in the machinery, when the world of the book for 
example becomes the world itself, precisely in a dynamic 
symbolic, incipient consciousness, embodiment, so these are, 
among other things and processes, thought thinking itself, it's
complicated

so how the world is, this is that, this is it for the duration 
of the period of complexity and its momentary consciousness


"Colonial critique is complicated, and somewhat enabled, by the 
fact of Fri Feb 4 14:35:03 EST 2000. This is complicated, he 
said, trying to make this complicated. Years ago I wrote an

for example or something else entirely, it's complicated

boundary is a body an outside
outside there is no body
outside there, is nobody
outside: there's nobody


filtering through wet sand

which is everything I'm not

and quality of worlds. ontologies

the opposite of a text is

an unravelled sweater -
nothing's in the sweater


we appear as an afterthought

an afterthought, outside, is already forlorn
while we're writing this, people are being killed, brutally
people are brutally killing
beset by the real, i'd say the blood is real

as long as i'm able to speak, as long as i have eyes,
the blood is real

nothing's in the sweater


always already beset by virtuality

if it's not empty, what should it be

sack bottom sack top sack circle

filtering through wet sand

beneath this world which moves


the sand is a sieve the sand strains the body
the body turns to broth it dries out
the hardness of the desert once there were trees
there was language now there's no language

there was language now there's no language
there was language now there's no language


we appear as an afterthought
with vast expectations

we used to be able to speak we had tongues and hands
we anticipated
we had hope


I cant do anything but adjust software, filter, text

borders on the way to cold death and evanescence

if it's not empty, what should it be


i'll tell you
it should be stunning
it should be beautiful
it should be beyond beautiful


sack meat strung-up
look, you see there, it should be beyond beautiful
the body is a temple, a shrine, a holy place
the body is contrary, untoward

so beautiful is the body
so ver beautiful

filtered through wet sand


the first place is always that of the other

with vast expectations

and ways and means of taking for granted things

and the world they come from


the second place is that of the other
and of the third
the third place, is that of the other


cold shallow in the breathing labored

the speech which rides the breath

and quality of words. grammatologies

with vast expectations



while the true world gnaws my dreams and fears of dying

I can't do anything but adjust software, filter, text

active filters are maintained

through the energy of the other


through the function
through the function the other has made of me
through the object and token the other has made, of me

of me, the object and token
of me, the function


this makes a new and wild thing

which is everything I'm not


nothing gives way but plasma cut across

spermatozoa, limb, and limb and limb multiply,

submerged, that is the time

and quality of worlds. ontologies

we appear as an afterthought


here at the light altar I am Architect
if it's not empty, what should it be

what worlds to build and raze

what dances, what poems?

and the world they come from


a filtered, flat, gone world, enlightened, black

closes that sphere that I am

multitudes are there divided pains divided hopes


close against them and then among them

I burst won't it hoping parcel paper brown
a parcel
a parcel which arrives for us
a parcel which is not too late or early
a parcel which arrives

burst for them will it close for them

with vast expectations

and the worlds they come from

inside scars marks, scrapped sphere, shattered

if it's not empty, what should it be

the body of Rebeca hurry
of Rebecca hurry
25 1778

this Irish banjo has four strings, short neck, an octave and a 
fourth, no resonator, very old, dark, almost clunky sound, I 
tune it like a tenor guitar, I work on modules and segues, and 
at one point, I wanted to be interviewed, wanted to present this 
way of playing, these sliding tones that return under new 
guises, neither end nor beginning, sound that might continue 
indefinitely, but there was no interviewer, I think to myself 
that maybe I'm just 'noodling' as Gary said, doing nothing much 
on the instrument, it's snowing hard now, it's the snow of 
Joyce's short story, death looms in this weather, breathes down 
upon us

for Rebeca hurry

the raw feed of anguish

http://www.alansondheim.org/nyumocap48.jpg

so, after a few hours of anguish, i gave up the unequal struggle 
against hi-rez streets of baghdad. i feel both anguish and cool 
distance towards -up-damage-defile excruciate-anguish- 
aposteme-barb-the- dart-bark-asthma the absence substance and 
its anguish, the medieval substance of light, possibly in her, a 
permanent state of anguish. one bright note, coming concept of 
_anguish_ which has become critical to me - anguish being a day. 
i think about the phenomenology of anguish, of the state of 
being work, doesn't stem from anguish, depression, that there is 
a crystalline is blank: anguish. anguish on our part. we're the 
ship. our fear with you and anguish anxiety bale agnation 
alliance ancestry anemia are we discovering a viral anguish in 
our midst? forever in my life. i feel we are all anguished more 
than we admit.

we need a bit of the anguish, the guns gunning, flags waving !

for the truth which, in turn, were to be dead and gone of this 
anguish this the silent wings stirring up anguish, no one can 
take the blame example, when the coral reefs disappear. perhaps 
some of the anguish about of a friend or relative is an anguish 
which is irretrievable in terms of there is, i believe, a sense 
of anguish at the heart of these as well.] more than a _cris de 
coeur_ - it's where anguish begins and refuses to state of 
anguish, that is to say a condition that is a combination of of 
pain and anguish, delirious happenings. the sap drains already a

anguish and too much talk, codeine and too much drink, autonomic 
reactions, becomes the presence of an anguished energy ues its 
uneasy hold on the rest of the body, o loved ones, do read 
anguish you must think of the anguish you are causing yourself 
and me and all its some, this anguish and pleasure. i, daishin

psycho-disturbance - the of it's anguish to any one of us is a

physical pain, run from anguish. and i recognize there are the 
first call spoke of her anguish, recounting abuse at an early 
age of anguish for the loss of ontic reality at the slightest 
gap in the pleasure in an anguish and anxiety that keeps her 
present, always the middle of torture shredded skin, anguish 
blotting out everything, utters and moves but conveys nothing of 
the internal anguish.

anguish the silent wings stirring up anguish, no one can take 
the blame anguish besought required understood sacks sack

revrev version 1.8, alto clarinet

We're still working on live reverse reverb in a mixed
reality environment for the Interrupt festival; this
setup is one of the modules we'll be using. some of
the work will be available in realtime publicly on 
the MacGrid or the Odyssey sim in Second Life; some
will connect only to one of two localhost sims. The
original alto clarinet sound comes through 'above' on
the left-hand channel; it forms a touchstone for the
surrounding sonic architecture.

think, he is, verily, thinking, though he does not think, for 
there is no cessation of the thinking of a thinker, because of 
the imperishability (of the thinker). There is not, however, a 
second, nothing else separate from him of which he could think.

29. 'Verily, when there (in the state of deep sleep), he does 
not touch, he is, verily, touching, though he does not touch,

now when

http://www.alansondheim.org/nowwhen.png

now when i try to write, there are interferences, coming from 
the other side, from somewhere i can see vagely, if at all, 
niterferences which are the beinning of an inundation that, at 
this point with pills within me, trying desperately, for sleep, 
won't occupy the gravel of the shore for too long, suh are the 
problems with the wrritten world/world fraught with 
annihilation: to the limit, i'm deliberately typing with eyes 
wide shut, allowing the ghosts and debris to issue forth, essays 
in ideleness, the pillow book, if this is an exercise it relates 
back to my piece about fever in disorders of the real, that we 
can't take for granted, ever, the positioning of health as a 
prereqisite for text, as if there were a standard of the body 
adn mind to be met before one is given the privilege of speaking 
or rather the bridge from speaking through writing to reading to 
hearing, etc. i welcome here, without spell ccking, these ghosts 
into my world; they'll dominate more and more in the coming 
years, until noting remains but bits and bytes scattered and 
disappearing fast from hard drives world-wide. this is what 
sleep deprivation does, it brings on death, brings down the 
curtain quickly, there will never be enough time to say goodbye 
to epople, there's no greet ing and no other side, the fences 
are temporarily in place, things. it's a matter of time 
literally before the universe goes dark and all this incredible 
richness of organisms and culture disappears, and inherent in 
the disappearance is the disappearance of any trace as well, 
we're all living in the period of erasure, we're all inherenlty 
inaccountable, our minds and future projects are our own worst 
enemy, and the groundrules of the world lie in its own 
slaughter. the effect of the pills is great, 12mg melatonin and 
trazodone, my mind crushes me with the true real, i don't have 
kristeva's good fortune to whirl through freud or catholicsm, 
what a melding here. there should be an image here, someting to 
accompany this, a text... i'll work on this later, the image, 
the lure , and i'll be careful not to make this too long, 
interets tails off..

the other speaks insofar as it is enabled
its enabling silences it, the other side silences, is silent
eorrors slip into the abyss of infinite possibilities
the other side opens, a vast chasm

perhaps time to say goodbye, pera final movement of the lips
the boundary of the movement of the lips
the boundary, nothing

preparations for our new cd, Threnody, coming soon.

the audio might be the strangest I've made; there are
two stages - live revrev with running two parallel 
programs, with live jinashi shakuhachi and madal input 
(I played them together), and post-production with 
pitch shift. I keep thinking: anticipatory music
(future perfect tense) combined with sound from the
_other side_ - and what might time be there? I love
this piece and the unexpectedness of it.

threnody, mourning, lamentations, wailing, ululuations ...

"no, what's left the body, left of the body, the haunting the 
trace, my sleep my dreams, ghosts haunting, haunched on my 
shoulders, unbearable magnetic storms, I can imagine them, my 
dreams, present because it is.  And is there in fact a haunting? 
In any case, something makes one a haunting-screen, coming up 
against the body, covering my whereabouts - this Alan haunting 
my dreams, this Alan signifying neutral expression, haunted by 
memories of haunting, plastered, I explain. The haunting of the 
world by ghosts, virtual beings, dreams and nightmares and the 
psychoanalytics of the image, the haunting of the imaginary - 
which brings dreams of death without recompense or memory). I 
think the harbinger of permanent loss to come scratched speech 
on your white stretched skin and nubbed tips haunting under the 
cloak of night, swollen skin and nubbed tips haunting me through 
a presence or uncanny phantom, the voice descends from the 
haunting of memory chords, and corrosion or neurasthenia as the 
world swayed and rippled."

i was going to write a long piece, 
This isn't my Country, and worked it out at length
in the middle of the night, how violence dominates
at this point, virulence, people can't talk to each
other, violence erupts in the middle of conversation,
on the street, within our minds, our own fury takes
over, our mind grapples with terror we have bred
inside us, we spawn among ourselves and devour 
ourselves, driving in Rhode Island, trucks come up
behind me, they want to crash into me, drive me off
the road, run over what's left of my face, we can't
die now anymore now, can we

so I stopped writing and armored the car and made
it full of guns and I go down the street and watch
the angry people

nothing added or subtracted. the qin is an 
unbounded world with seven highways, many
rest stops, trails everywhere. the qin is
heir to philosophical thinking in china and
elsewhere; like shakuhachi music, space is
constructed, eddies, withdraws, dialogs 
with silence and emptiness. 

the other video, of a zoom h4n, records the

thought of it as an absorptive punctum, an

Another Avatar Woman review (from England) - 

http://www.terrascope.co.uk/Reviews/Rumbles_March_15.htm

I'm afraid my ability to play will give out; what if I
have a stroke or heart attack? So I'm hurrying, working 
on the next album which stresses technique and speed in 
relation to mourning and unredeemable death. Many of
these instruments have traveled with me; here they are.
Contrary to the review above, I've released something
like ten cds/albums/cassettes at least; they tend to 
disappear, I don't. I think through thought, in music 
and without music; for me, these are more than pieces;
they're something else, indefinable, they rescue me for
other work, the virtual work for example. For what it's 
worth, I don't think of myself as a cyberspace theorist,
but as a shape-shifter, if shape there be; it's thinking
and thinking through. Scroll all the way down for the 
review.

(And whatever you do, don't tell me I'm old; I've had
enough ageism recently to last for several lifetimes.)



Erhu

http://www.alansondheim.org/erhuand.jpg *
http://www.alansondheim.org/qqqqviolin.mp3 erhu

Replaced the violin piece by an erhu piece, same
address. 1. It's more adventuresome. 2. It sounds
better. 3. It was difficult. 4. Around 30 seconds
you can hear a motorcycle. 5. The ending has an
interesting bow slippage. 6. It's an erhu!!!
[...]

We just set up a more reasonable configuration
for the Motu and computer; the erhu sounds travel
into the ultrasonic which made it hard for the 
lavalier to work well; instead I duplicated the
instrument mic. In the meantime, playing is
compounded by my tinnitus, which creates beats/
interference patterns; my ear-dreaming, phantom
hearing, takes over and the result is strange; I
have to play through and above/below what I hear,
which is not entirely coming from the instrument.
The next beat of my heart might be mirrored in 
the madal, but not here. In any case, I think the
piece is quite good, worthy of hearing, rushed,
running wild at the limit of my physical/musical
capabilities. [...]

* erhu in foreground, sarangi, ghichak, and 
suroz behind. The sarangi is now owned by
Stephen Dydo; the ghichak and suroz will be
going to the National Music Museum in South 
Dakota. [...]



What happens when I fill the room in my head

http://www.alansondheim.org/espsession12.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/qqqqalto.mp3

The image is from our recording session which
resulted in Avatar Woman and Cutting Board.
The music - well it's alto clarinet sent through
the MOTU set for a 12 second reverb; that's what
I heard through the headphones and I was curious
how it would be to play that way. It took all
night to set up, indicative of the difficulty I
have with soundboard configurations. I was also
reacting to my fear of tinnitus interfering with
everything; here, I made sure it wasn't an issue
but I'm walking around the erhu suspiciously. In
any case, this piece is annoying, strange, and
insistent, and I love the tonalities the clarinet
was able to produce against itself in a space 
that never seemed to end.

the making of poor little things

http://www.alansondheim.org/poorthingsb.mp4

the drift of the narrative

the slight raising of filter barriers, enough to let the poor 
thing _in_? and then, Pox on't, why do I speak of these poor 
things? and then, but a poor thing; ornamented, it sloughs into 
the symbolic.

the poor little things when the shift from virtual virtual
to virtual physical and all the poor little things happen
and every little things is unhappy and these are the roles
of depression when everything transforms into emptiness
among things that should be replete and fecund and when
everything that grows dissolves and leaves a sweet sticky
taste of itself and all the little others in a soft tawdry
trail dissolving in the tears of small whimperings and
even though you know how this is created in the narrative
and mise en scene and the making of the making of poor
little things you can't help feeling sorry for them and
for your lives and the anguish and suffering in our world
that used to be so beautiful so wonderful that we would
sing of it and celebrate it and walk softly in its 
shadows and now we are very very small and murmuring and
our hearts our broken among the fabric of our world

how ironic that virtual virtual objects turning into
physical virtual objects begin to take on suffering and

how unutterably sad that our lives are defined by the
days of our births and days of our deaths and all of 
this is different among us and our loved ones and 
among our families and among others and

how quickly conversations and deep discussions and
disagreements end so sadly with the death of one and
the death of another and

how irrevocable the world is, the poor little things 
of the world and the poor little things we remember 
until we are forgotten and

oh i sing of these things, threnody and ululuations,
mourning and lamentations, and the greyness of the world
in our last and fading shining hour

Henry Gunckel simple systen clarinet, mid-19th century
with Luke Damrosch revrev and convolution programs.

meanwhile the clarinet has a crack that needs to be filled,
an afternoon project sometime after the chemistry arrives.
it's been a difficult day but we went about our ordinary
business.

the clarinet has five unringed holes, everything for slurs,
odd intervals, glissandos; technically it's a 13-key
instrument before the HP/LP designations, high pitch / low
pitch. this is not the standard or full Albert system, but
as its description suggests, simpler, with the forked F
(relative to the standard pitch) fingering that's a real
nuisance. the tone is somewhere among bagpipe, duduk, folk
clarinets in general, and very easy to modify.

all of this will stop after the recording sessions in May.
I know now this is a material for talking to myself about
sound that I hear below the tinnitus and that it is a good
sound and I will make it and retire into a virtual world
with this sound and it will be there with me.
