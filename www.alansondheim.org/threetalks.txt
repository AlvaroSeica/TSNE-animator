1. Uncomfortable notes on the poetics of captured human behavior:


[for Epoetry 2011]


The following is an outline of my recent work, which is based on a 
semiotics of the human body that relates to political and environmental 
concerns, choreography, and so forth, but is not based on particular 
graphemes or vocabulary. [Because of illness, I wasn't able to give this.]


I use motion capture in a variety of ways, emphasizing a poetics of 
movement that works through motion-transformation, motion-invention or 
discovery - in other words, I use motion capture for things beyond the 
standard reproduction of human movement.

Think of a set constituting the range of human actions, as described by 
Rudolf Laban:

Then think of different sorts of transformations T, that can be applied to 
 this range through modified motion capture.

The result is an unlimited range of actions, preserved in files, which can 
 be used in virtual worlds, in mannequin software, or for augmented 
 realities. I describe this as:

{range of human actions, Laban A} 
> T > 
{unlimited range of actions B}

What is T?

a. software interface (dynamic behavior filtering) transformations
 - WVU changing the software itself, some node remappings. 
When I was at WVU, we reworked the software for the older motion capture 
 equipment at the Virtual Environments Lab; the result was the ability to 
 create dynamic filtering, which modified the original actions.

b. hardware (distribution, remapping) transformations
 - remapping the nodes on one performer, distributions as in c.
Or the hardware could be mapped differently - the nodes could be assigned 
 different positions on the body, than the usual.

c. social transformations (many into one, distributed mappings)
Or - and this is most pertinent - the nodes for a SINGLE AVATAR or 
 representation could be distributed among several people, resulting in a 
 SINGULAR BEHAVIOR, assigned to one avatar, but representing a social 
 confluence - many people controlling one body.

The REAL BODY bound by skeletal connectivity, Jordan surfaces; 
But the transformed body bound by skeletal connectivity, twisted/tangled 
surfaces

In other words the links in the transformed body can bend in any 
 direction; the links in the real body are confined by human skeletal 
 potentials + topology
 (topological embedding in four dimensions):
 think of this as a tensor calculus of human movement
 think of this as a topography of flesh and sinew

The following typology emerges - this is where my work is taking me:

Ruptures created by the general calculus above, ruptures through the 
 calculus or in the calculus. This breaks down as follows:

Ruptures in the calculus:
 the tortured or wounded body
 the body convulsed in pain
 the catatonic body
 the terrorized body
 the broken or 'defective' body

Ruptures through the imaginary:
 the nightmare
 the orgasm
 hysteria/ boundaries of laughing and crying
 the confined body/ body of s/m
 the forgotten or abandoned body
 the hyper-sexualized body transmitters/ receivers
 hallucinations and other phenomena (Dendy's Philosophy of Mystery)

Ruptures of the body invaded by capital:
 prosthetics
 X-scopic surgeries
 rfid implants

Ruptures of the body invaded by the imaginary:
 (capital of the imaginary, imaginary capital)
 psycho-tropics/overdetermined associations/disassociations

Ruptures of the body by an augmented real:
 sports, steroids, body-building, and so forth

Think of all of this together:

Invasions of the imaginary, invasions of capital, of the augmented real,
 invasions through the imaginary: invasions or invaginations, 
 incorporations or intensifications? These terms entangle and return to:

Either the proper body, or the body as heap;
 the articulated body, or the dismembered and reassembled body;
 the body characterized by a real, or the body chararacterized 
 by an imaginary;

Either the fundamental topography of the body, 
 or the fundamental topology of the body - invasions, dissolutions, 
ruptures.

Ruptures as returns of the repressed - some questions to be considered:

What lexicons are at work? What economies?
What is it that motion capture captures? 
What is snared, what abandoned?
What is the vocabulary of behavioral dynamics - voluntary, autonomic,
 involuntary, intrinsic - or involuntary, anomalous and axiomatic, 
 extrinsic?
In other words: What is going on with us, within and without the world?

=========================================================================

Part 2: the Wringing. This is where I consider types of ruptures in terms 
of Rudolf Laban's "efforts" in dance choreography:

Laban, in Modern Educational Dance, distinguishes ``eight basic efforts'': 
Wring, Press, Glide, Float, Flick, Slash, Punch, Dab. ``Each of these 
efforts contains three of the six movement elements: strong, light, 
sustained, quick, direct, flexible.'' Four of the group are strong: Slash, 
Wring, Press, and Punch. Wring and Press reconfigure the avatar; Press 
preserves both topology and topography, but Wring transforms at least the 
latter.

Wringing slides one against another, in combination with pressure: 
Wringing distorts the body. With physical bodies, wringing breaks 
connectionns (slashing can also break connections).

Now, think of:

The wrung body, the hobbled body. Wringing occurs when the body is 
simultaneously twisted and restrained.

Gravity restrains and locates the body. With mocap, gravity may be 
'eliminated' through the use of harnesses, or through edge phenomena that 
carry the body elsewhere.

The heaped or pressed body: the body as thing, as material: the body of 
the slave (wrung from and within capital, wrung from the socius).

From the viewpoint of capital, of war, the dehistoricized body - the body 
becoming element or token, demarcation of nothing but position, mined for 
its materiality.

The finality of the dancing body, the dance of death - the heaps of 
Rwanda, Auschwitz, Abu Gharayb.

Similarity, in the world of the simulacrum, the disappearing body: 
Argentina, U.S. prisons.

Not similarity: the world of the (natural) catastrophe, the disaster: the 
heaped body, but the body (perhaps) recuperated for/within history.

One might think through all of this as the historiography of the body. 
Where do we go from here?

=========================================================================

 Part 3: the Wringing: Part 2: Addendum: Quotes from Rudolf Laban:

V. WRINGING.

wringing--is flexible, sustained, strong.


Wringing can vary from a pulling to a twisting movement,and is felt more 
easily in the shoulders, arms and hands than in the hips and legs. The 
feeling of strength must not be lost, as the slow muscular resistance felt 
in pressing is also present in this effort, but wringing produces a 
different sensation as the joints move more flexibly.

At first, wringing should be felt in the hands, as in wringing out 
clothes, and then extended, using different parts of the body. The whole 
body can be set into a wringing motion--for example in yawning.

Wringing movements of the arms can be directed into various zones, the 
most important as far as exercises are concerned being down forwards 
outwards, but there are many possibilities--with each arm separately, or 
both together, wringing downwards, upwards, across, sideways, forwards and 
backwards, extending into space in all directions.

Wringing should also be experienced in other parts of the body, such as 
the shoulders, trunk, hips, legs, not only extending into space away from 
the body, but towards it. Other possible variations are wringing simultan- 
eously with both arms in different directions, or wringing with different 
parts of the body into various directions; for example, wringing the trunk 
in a backwards-bending movement and doing the same action with arms 
sideways high, _et cetera._

[...]

"Indulging with" Space and Time, and "fighting against" Weight, which is 
the essence of wringing, develops a valuable control and gives and 
entirely different movement-experience from that gained by doing simple 
twisting exercises. The counter-tensions involved produce a different kind 
of bound flexibility from that met with in any other form of physical 
activity.

(Rudolf Laban, Modern Educational Dance, 1948, pp. 63-65.)

On Number

Mathesis boils down to 0 and 1 , presence or absence, + | - , and so 
forth. The structure/function of the world swirls around beliefs connected 
to and contained within the polarity. Does anything exist beyond it? Does 
anything exist between the symbols? .0001 for example is mathematically 
between 0 and 1, but it doesn't 'fit' with the symbols, just as + and - 
natural numbers, have no blurred distinctions, for example that .0001 of a 
negative. Is there a container, then, as far as you're concerned? such 
that one might have [ 0 1 ] or some such? Is there lookup, so that 0 might 
be assigned X and 1 Y? Is there a form of genidentity such that 0 and 1 
retain their forms, or, through pure ideality, is such a thing even 
necessary? How are 0 and 1 contained / represented in the physical world? 
What are their tie-ins? Do they provide a primitive indexicality of being? 
Is such an indexicality arbitrary? How do we position ourselves with 
regard to the primacy of 0 and 1? For example, are these primordial, 
absolute? Are they relativized to particular domains? What role does the 
flesh-and-blood man or woman play in relation to them? Is gender involved? 
Abjection? Is it necessary to consider the grapheme involved in particular 
instances? The referents? Are referents necessary? Sheets of assertion in 
any consideration? If we consider for example the calculating subject, 
does that subject possess a generalized genidentity? Does the particular 
of that subject - beyond gender, individuated history for example, play 
any role? Any primordial role? Is it necessary to go farther in mathesis 
to arrive at an understanding of mathematical ideality in relation to 
concrete physicality? Would a singular 1 do, or is the step necessary? I 
believe the step, differentiation of any sort, is necessary. Then is the 
distinction between one and the other, 1 and 2 necessary? Might one 
consider instead 1 and 0 as two stages in a process? Then why the "two" in 
two stages? Is 0 then determinative only of absence? Might one begin with 
1 and 2, then, considering 0 as fictional, as-if? Something in fact and 
fancy derived as a backward calculation from 1 and 2? If differentiation 
is necessary, might one find the concrete, flesh-and-blood, ontology to 
lie in the step itself? Considering 0 and 1, or 1 and 2 as the boundaries 
of the step and nothing more. In any case, I have no problem with 
induction, with extensions, fractions, irrationals, transcendentals, 
infinitesimals, surreal numbers, infinities, transfinites, etc. etc. Once 
an existence appears, so does its absence, at least historically? Are 
these things discovered or invented? Does concrete physical historicity 
play a role here? Is there a conceivable conflation between abstract 
ontology and historiography, parallel perhaps to the conflation between 
the ontology of fundamental particle physics and the economics necessary 
to generate increasingly high energies, as Brillouin had it? Let us return 
to the Brown's drawing of a distinction, perhaps, or at least to any such 
demarcation of + and - ; one might then ask if action is prerequisite, and 
if so, does this involve temporality, and if so a priori? So that action 
might appear, and then genidentity or some form of keeping-track - of 
calculations, of individuations, tokens, symbols, mathesis, even the 1 and 
2. But if 1 and 2 exist independently of all of this, as ideal, then does 
a subject appear at all? Is the subject that-which-ties foregrounding and 
backgrounding, substance and structure, subject and object? Does this 
result in position masquerading as solipsism? Is it in fact solipsism? 
Would an utterly emptied universe, think of no-universe, still harbor, 
without place, mathesis? Is mathesis prior to no-universe? Is 0 and 1 and 
1 and 2? Might one consider 0 and 1 as primordial ontology _in any case,_ 
and 1 and 2 primordial epistemology _in any case_? Why do mathematicians - 
why does mathematical philosophy - generally tend towards an absolute? 
Towards Truth? Towards the Absolute Subject as characterless and 
fundamental? Towards a basic primary of relation as in Pythagoreanism? Why 
is this _tending_ when tending itself implies temporality? Does this 
involve flesh-and-blood subjects in the final position? I think not. I 
think in any universe, 0 1 2 are already already present and accounted 
for. That they are present and accounted for in no-universe. Are they gods 
then? They are what passes for gods, in that they are constitutive. They 
are not what passes for gods, in that they are nubs, mute. They are 
whatever description might be applied, to the extent that the application 
is characterized by the negative, neti neti. But that characterization is 
for us, and has nothing to do with them. And has nothing to do with the 
gods either.
