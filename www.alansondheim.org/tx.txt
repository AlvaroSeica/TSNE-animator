assessment of a failed career

( for Azure who is all goodness and keeps me going )

http://www.alansondheim.org/gltcha.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/gltchb.png

i can't forgive myself for failure after failure.
my work is too complicated and abject for a coherent series.
i'm incapable of creating a solid and unique style.
my only coherency is incoherency.
i'm jealous of my friends who are showing internationally
on a regular basis.
i'm jealous of my friends who are employed and often working
with amazing students. 
i'm attracted to death and i'm frightened by death.
i, i, i, i, i,
i, i, i, i, i,
i keep pushing my personal boundaries and keep thinking 
i'm making a real contribution to thought itself.
i'm too filled with grandeur and despair.
i've never been able to have a consistent and productive life.
i've failed myself and failed others.
i have no idea how to behave and have to constantly think
of what i'm doing.
i'm far too frightened of the world far too pessimistic.
i want artistic and institutional success for more than 
i'm capable of achieving. 
i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm i'm,
i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm i'm,
i'm far too overwhelmed by fear, anxiety, and depression.
i'm like a child who can't get its way and use the work 
i do as a bad excuse. 
i'm afraid of everyone else and thirst for approval.
i give talks that are too long and too scattered.
i can't sleep properly and worry about being irrelevant.
i'm frightened of ageism and have no defenses against it.
i don't want to continue if i start to develop dementia.
i'm far too career-driven given the failure of my career.
i think everyone else is doing better than me.
i'm far too self-absorbed and too spoiled.
i'm far too ambitious and believe in the magical power 
of words.

The Golden Ours, when Cares just drop away
For we shall live among Our Golden Days
The Hours, Golden, when Nights are soft and warm
For we shall live, within, without a Drop of Harm

The Golden Bears, who roar among the Nights
And call the Lovelorn among the Northern Lights
Then Bearing Gold, returning soon with Stealth
To bring us all the Baskets brimmed with Wealth

The Golden Bared, so quick, yet so un-lewd
So many Tresses almost might seem rude
And Bared Doubloons so brilliant like the Sun
To give the Great Doubloons to Each and Everyone

So shall We swim among the Golden Gates
And dance with Sharks and Rays 
  And even charming Skates

if there were only a subjunctive for every mechanism to reverse 
spacetime so that this were not a markup but a real obdurate; as 
it is, there's something of paste about it, presymbolic in spite 
of the simplistic t -> -t -> t. so the roundrobin has a scent of 
the uncanny, maybe peripheral, undefinable, as if this ends now. 
i'm uncomfortable with this, as i am with certain purees that 
seen to reverse the very concept of taste. the idiocy of 
reversal rides me, won't let go of me, such an vapid trick 
smelling of lassitude, languor, dampness and wilting. why is 
this such a fundamental magic, in spite of its everyday quality? 
i'll sleep uneasily tonight, no closer to the answer than 
ever. (i can approach this with shorter and shorter intervals 
and someday i'll inhabit one of them, and just for a fraction of

the wake

http://www.alansondheim.org/thewakes.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/memento07.jpg

the keyboard is limited: one note at a time, no 'return' (i.e. 
holding down C, then F, then releasing F, doesn't sound C 
again), but the clack of fingers and nails on the keys, and the 
_wake_ that the melodic leaves behind create imaginary envelopes 
- as if there were a dynamics descending from the imaginary. 

i've been thinking about _wakes_ - the wake of a human or other 
organism moving through a space (gases, liquids, sounds, sights, 
pressures - in short an expansion of schlieren optics through 
electromagnatic, chemical, and acoustic spectra) -

how, for example, several notes of equal volume and no dynamics 
beyond the usual onset/offset (an inexpensive keyboard here) can 
create the sensation of musical shaping, almost a voice -

& as in a wake for dearest friends, in this deep and mournful - 
our senses leave a wake in the world. boot-strapping occurs 
throughout the wake among sentient beings; the re-mark of the 
wake is history; the mark of the wake is death.

Melting ice means no rest for weary polar bears

Apr. 22, 2016

http://www.alansondheim.org/roches20.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/acdc.mp4

As the Arctics ice continues to melt away, polar bears are 
increasingly being forced to swim for days straight to find food 
and rest, The Washington Post reports. Of more than 100 bears 
monitored by a Canadian researcher, 69% took a swim of at least 
49 kilometers in 2012, up from 25% in 2004, according to a new 
study in the journal Ecography. One bear in 2009 was observed 
swimming 402 kilometers in a 9-day journey during which her 
year-old cub died. Though polar bears are adept swimmers, they 
are not built to swim long distances, and they were rarely seen 
making such journeys in earlier decades. But the continuing 
break-up of the Arctics sea ice means that polar bears must do 
more marathon swims over open waters to find food.

(Usually I don't make assemblages, and this one, unfair as it 
is, is something I've been thinking about recently. Consider it 
propaganda at its worst. Do note the ucannily beautiful rust- 
belt landscape from downtown Rochester.)

necessity

http://www.alansondheim.org/necessary.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/necessary.mp4

(the necessity of surrealism = the lack of imagination)

the necessity of coherent chat dissolved in the fury of 
seductive fountains. the amusement of drizzled sound in the 
midst of curious lozenges. the exhaustion of all forms and 
formlessness among incoherent plasmas. the chaotic casings of 
spews of spews. the murmurings of incoherent violas. the 
necessity of seductive fountains. the necessity of amusement. 
the necessity of curious lozenges. the necessity of all forms. 
the necessity of casings. the necessity of incoherent violas. 
the necessity of spews. i go all surrealist on you. i hate 
myself. i go all surrealist on you.

the stories of interiors and bifurcations

http://www.alansondheim.org/bifurcation.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/interiors1.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/interiors2.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/interiors3.jpg

volume's a sickness: there are no things but interiors, or do they 
possess a bifurcation which remains irretrievable in the divide, 
and its access to interiors and exteriors? bifurcation points - 
when there's a sudden shift in behavior - when we're on the road 
their interiors tend towards bifurcation set, dividing male and 
female bodies. you know that. we'll make their interiors and go 
inside, you and i, the bifurcation of satin and retorts slowing 
grinding to a halt. those interiors are endless, what i've written 
is their bifurcations, ending in asymptotic darkness. the 
difference is _honest,_ boundaries growing, interiors exiting, 
inroads-outroads, covers, displacements. it all returns.

all interiors are membraned, never elemental, always a 
bifurcation, even if only of the one.

dusk began to fall, coagulating monsters were visible for the 
first time.

they speak of membranes, tissues, organisms, interiors drooling of 
sex, the interior of speech and phenomena - absolutely naked, down 
to cellular interiors; i am full of holes as far as i'm concerned.

copula. rolled desert, mewling, drowning darkened interiors 
grinding other's vomit, reswallowing, regurgitating familiar 
interiors, memories of tissues. new membranes and interiors. new 
conical objects. new objects.

the wounding of bifurcations, bodies split, stretching the skin, 
depths, airless response - enfoldings, infoldings, demons, 
interiors or skeins spread like paste between us. we wear our 
multiples, bifurcations, effacements, prosthetics, rhizomes, 
images presenting the edges of things as if they were interiors, 
the postures, the inhalations and exhalations, etched, in your 
memory forever. there's no way out.
 
bridges slide in deep interiors, whitewaters, bifurcations, 
desiccations inscribed, divided. interiors: invasions. members: 
invasions.

the only thing that happens, is _steam._ interiors spread like 
paste between us. biogenetics smooths bifurcation happens, 
_steam,_ stretched, swollen, distended interiors, all glistening, 
reflecting your interior, bifurcations, your interior 
bifurcations.

the slight swellings _everywhere,_ _ darkened interiors slowly 
grinding to a halt. the debris of the real. then explored and 
unexplored. then knotted interiors. then bifurcations. the 
_knotted._ the _sheave-skin, sheave-organism._

they_ have no limits. _they_ secrete interiors, exteriors. _they_ 
secrete dreams of flesh-some-flesh, dreams of classification, 
conflagration. when were they made. who made them. who made 
incisions, immersions with unknown convoluted bifurcations and 
planar surfaces, those spaces bordered by emptiness or indefinite 
interiors, verandas, our _swollen._

organs passing _through._

through borderlining clara says, bifurcations, they're not 
smoothed. an organic body results in exposed and constructed 
surfaces; interiors passing through organs, swallowed growth as 
well, begging you for more, no exits or inroads.
