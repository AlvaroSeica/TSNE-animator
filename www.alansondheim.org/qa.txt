sadness, last, fullness


distraught at the ending of a nine-month residency, the work disappearing 
in two days, at least in its intended state; I've gone in and maximized 
the number of objects on some of the parcels, the last gasp of a form of 
hysteria awkwardly connected with creative stumbling among virtuals and 
reals. I didn't expect to feel this way, but I've explored every milli- 
meter of the place, such as it is, analyzed and written through it, taught 
classes with it or even there, inhering; I've exhibited it online and off, 
in galleries and film or video venues, and now the curtain's over and 
habitus almost but not quite yet removed. What you'll see if you enter the 
place, more a state of mind than anything else, is something unique now, 
the overflowing or abundance of the virtual and the struggle of computers 
to keep up with the flow which seems simultaneously endless and confined.

Sometime, somewhere, histories of these works should be preserved; now, 
they're ephemeral, at the whim of curators, owners, whomever, anyone but 
the artists who spend hundreds of hours creating them.

The sound of the Odyssey Installation: Azure Carter orchestra


Azure's sounds and songs are throughout the installation; I was finally 
able to get a good audio recording (line in, into the a digital recorder) 
- showing how voices are employed in the space, a rather beautiful piece 
in itself. Do have a listen. (Changes in the recording are a result of 
moving through the space.)

Tired of Second Life Tires First


After making and monitoring an installation for nine months, artist runs 
into murky politics, land-vandal issues, and aesthetic interference. He 
counters "what SL [Second Life] is all about is what I'm not; you [I] work 
day and night on something to have effect canceled by someone else." His 
masterwork "The Accident" [sic] was removed earlier this week, by himself. 
"During the removal process," he rejoined, "not by design I removed far 
too much, opening myself to great criticism, luckily countered by the gen- 
erosity of others in quickly repairing whatever damage may have accrued." 
He then went on to build anew, a work in part based on a momentary access 
to another part of the great SL universe. Such was the case that he turned 
it over from one parcel [parcel] to another in a matter of moments coupled 
with obsessive tuning. "I liked what I did," he declaimed, and my friend 
Selavy Oh interspersed his work with mine, something we had spoken about 
after his work appeared earlier with "The Accident" creating indeed an 
accident that made it difficult to finish final film and video-vertigo 
which I had desired for the remnant of documentation opened to me. Thus he 
withdrew at that earlier moment in SL time [not real time] and reinstalled 
at this later date and thus it stood for all time [not real time] meaning 
perhaps a day in quality." At which point double prismatic interferences 
first made everyone inaccessible to everyone else and second made the 
overt effect of the work ultimately unmalleable and unsupportable. Artist 
continued with broken statement about what he co-termed "defuge": that 
state of decathecting, disgust, exhaustion, and disinvestment after every- 
thing goes awry." True to his turning away with "disgust," he intoned his 
inability to continue making things in a world that simultaneously re- 
quired investment and release: "doing something and then forgetting about 
it or that one has done it or that one need welcome any subsequent change 
by others." For the construction of large-scale possibilities, he thought 
it far too much to think through when nothing would remain even in an 
immediate future but for alterations by others in an already unstable 
situation. "I have learned my lesson," he finally replied, "I am not free 
nor will I be nor are you [you] nor anyone else I know. We write our own 
programs in the language of the other and my behavior searches for asylum 
far from the maddening crowding confusion of protocols, programs, codes, 
languages, scripts, textures, and prim-prims." "Let me sink into thought," 
he cried, "let me sink! let me sink!"

for some reason the word turf makes me laugh
i thought of a good joke two buddhists went into a bar and said nothing
well it might be better if they went into a cave or monastery or something
anyway one of them - anyway it could go like this
two buddhists went into a bar and one said nothing to the other
but because of english maybe the other said something
but then you might say that one refers to either of them and both
instead of one referring to either of them but not both
so the joke might be confusing to people who don't know logic
but the rest of us might find it funny maybe they went into a house
why would they go into a house or a bar for that matter
two buddhists went nowhere and one said nothing to the other
now it's just stupid and the joke's gone out of it
there's got to be a way to bring it back
i'm too feverish to find a way

	teleported away
[2009/02/11 8:55]  Julu Twine: lways to set a landmark, teleport out of 
	there.

nevertheless bound by someone's concept of physics, virtual and otherwise.

physics of ostensible three-dimensionality and ordinary phase rules.

no magnets but seduction of voice and image beckoning you onward.

the performance is a gaping maw in the gaping maw of Second Life.

all orgasms possess kernels of fantasy, terror, loss and recuperation.

this is a beautiful installation which will be rendered harmless in its 
	absence.

the width of a skin is a pixel.

the width of your body is four centimeters.

ill knots


i'm fascinated by the knots, aporia, that buckle and unbuckle constantly 
in the current installation

and in their imminent formation as soon as the drawing-out begins, as if
objects were generated anew, given the instance of each and every entrance 
into the virtual world

at the same time in the real, my illness, however it be, has become viru- 
lant, and it refuses me the responsibility of a cure

i have had blood tests, eegs, x-rays, sleep studies, ekgs, prescriptions, 
regimens, vitamins, exercises, consultancies, to no avail

between miserable vision and hearing, and these odd temperature drops and 
flu-symptoms without cause or reason, nothing lies

but i will die i am sure of it, with a whine and a whimper

and the knots will continue forming and unforming until an administrator 
cancels quite correctly this homeland and turns it over to someone else

this temporary homeland, this temporary life

to see this before it disappears, please do, it's the culmination, apex, 
aporia, nadir, of all that came before it, within it, upon it,
the accident @ http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22

pathing, diadem, and electric saz


before you end up hating me
know i'm better at berating me
try a bit of tolerating me
my ego kills inflating me
thank god you're never dating me
or flirting now or baiting me
you think i'm only stating me
i'm zero when i'm rating me
don't come i'm never mating me
the rhymes collapse i'm plating me
to pack me up for freighting me
for meat where you'll be grating me
already i'm predating me
depressed i find you're gating me
don't bother with deflating me
across the pond you're skating me
i'm through the ice awaiting me
for human you're not slating me
now you've divided spating me

i like to imagine a world where touching and seeing are in harmony,
a world of friendly things and friendly aires, where pathing comes
and goes to pathing places, where every path a home, and every home,
a path

waif, smeared dead

left behind smeared across the universe these orphan waifs
smeared and left without address or something fine
something fine for you smeared across the staining universe
the staining universe is the universe
the smearing universe is the universe
the waif is the waif

Ontology Something or Other

Found 2 more emmiters today, Returned them to you.
I removed so many objects that I think they got lost in a server sync lag
and are showing up a long time later.
Also found 3 objects of mine that were deleted last week.
It is like time warp in the world...
Aliens appear
I saw that today for the first time.
Remember I rezzed your whole installation there as a test and then
had a hell of a time finding all the pieces. It probably is from that.
I left it there because I wanted to talk to you about it.
Very nice. Would be good to install it next to the other piece.
Found one of my pieces floating somewhere above the old platform - it's 
mostly invisible but with particle trails. have no idea how that got 
there but quite like it. 

(SL discussion with Ian Murray)



the flub series 

a new work installation beneath the accident installation

a fitting conclusion to works which never survive but apparently
fade away
"for works which never survive"
homage to those works!
they never survive!


"smile though your heart is aching"

i realized i was beginning to die when my foot began hurting two years 
ago; i was teaching at brown university, walking across the pembroke 
campus, and suddenly was hobbling. second event, when we put our cat 
boojum down; she had been my companion for eighteen years, and azure's for 
almost ten. and third, when i noticed a flash in my left eye and went to 
the opthamologists, knowing something had gone wrong. nothing ends up 
reversible but early on, the body pains would have been part of a phenom- 
enology of healing, not disablement. now i'm on the slope towards death 
and want it like this, suicide when i can't work any longer, when i become 
a burden to azure. i live in the fear of death, watching my body drop out 
from under me. buddhism doesn't help in the long run and even lyotard had 
a fearful cry from the heart towards the very end. the world turns dark 
and second life is no cure, just diversion from failing senses, failing 
health. i'm preternaturally scared to the point of disability at times and 
i wonder why everyone isn't like this, how everyone else manages to get up 
in the morning and life seemingly goes on productively. i can't live in 
the morning; i live in fear of the curtain falling rapidly and violently, 
the curtain falling on nothing, nothing whatsoever. i woke up in tears 
again; http://www.alansondheim.org/ flubb pngs and find i can barely work 
through these.

so the sign of the body is the body of the sign, the sign-body or body- 
sign, and these are meaning by virtue of the signature but doesn't this 
collapse with the incipience of death - meaning towards non-meaning as 
asymptotic towards death - when does meaning collapse - disappear - what 
constitutes the falling-away of meaning - the disappearance of locus - 
it's towards classical physics that one takes comfort in the return - the 
replete or fecund sign - let's say signifier, pointing-towards - but there 
are many histories - let's say an infinite number - intrinsic pointers - 
at the other end, defuge, exhaustions - let's say, from the appearance of 
the subject - the apparency, appetition, of one - singularity reined in by 
virtue of the corral of the sign-body - what appears to be genidentity - 
it's here that the masquerade begins - all those tendrils towards death - 
what happens when the subject loses the fecundity of origins through its 
disappearance - from the viewpoint of the subject, the world is over- 
wrought - now one might turn towards the virtual or inscribed body - a
collocation of confused signifiers - the mind and its disappearance - 
eternity inhabits the virtual - that's the _subject_ speaking - death 
comes but death comes about - when signs come and the signs are unnamed - 
when the signs are innumerable - when the signs are a-signifying, inert, 
obdurate - when the signs are speechless - then death appears - death 
appears without significance - the anguish of death is this - the lack of 
significance - abject spew of the lack - neither this nor that - not both 
this and that - but one's not around for any or all of this - the anguish 
of death is this - that one's not around - neither for the news or the 
weather -
