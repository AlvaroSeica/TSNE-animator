On the Genealogy of Machines


Given that machinery is in general (and I am only speaking in general)
created from machinery, one might begin by specifying a chain A -> B -> C,
or, more generally, Mn -> Mn+1 -> Mn+2, of machines. Consider every such
chain a lineage, noting, again in general, that Mn is temporally prior to
Mn+1. Thus Mn "makes" Mn+1 and so forth. [Of course there are issues of
maintenance and repair, and the production of component parts for these
purposes. Before long, the formalism becomes a thicket; hence a beginning
direction is a consideration of a temporally-linear holarchy of fluid sets
and subsets, without contradictory feedback.]

First, -> is transitive; that is, given the series above, Mn -> Mm,
provided Mn and Mm exist within the same lineage, and n < m. [Is an
intransitive lineage possible? It depends on the meaning of ->. One might
consider, for example, an exploding-machine, or a machine whose implicate
ordering is permanently lost, or a stochastic machine. For practical
purposes, this would create a break or rupture in the establishment of
lineage; for theoretical purposes, however, the lineage, on a
practico-material level, remains intact.]

Second, note that -> is non-symmetrical; if Mn -> Mm, then not Mm -> Mn.
And third, -> is non-reflexive; Mn cannot build itself (self-bootstrapping
ab nihilo). [Of course Mm could build Mn at a later time - Mn is then an
equivalent, but not temporally-equivalent, machine. And just as genident-
ity is described by Reichenbach for states and objects, one might have a
genidentity of processes or chains of processes; a machinic lineage is an
example.] [Along with non-reflexivity, identity as a noticing or operation
also disappears. We are dealing with incipient industrializations,
typifications, and so on - see below.]

Now in general, every production is a splay, such that Mn -> {Mn+1}k,
where k references a set of equivalent machines. And further, {M}j ->
{M'}k. This is to be read - a group of disparate machines M operate in
series, parallel, or another holarchic configuration, to produce a series
of equivalent machines M'; the first are indexed by j, and the latter by
k.  Here again it is to be assumed that {M}j are temporally prior to
{M'}k. This formulation is a general lineage; the components j are
transitive as well as the ensemble in its entirety. The ontology is that
of the practico-material substrate of the world-order. [A splay, in this
instance, is a particulate emission. Thus the production of a new model of
camcorder is a splay of equivalent, but non-identical, machines. The
operations of the disparate machines collapse into the fuzzy singularity
of splay - the production of a particular model. Note that any one of the
disparate machines is transitive in relation to the splay and the
descendents of the splay, but this is all sub-set; no one of the disparate
machines produces the splay in its entirety. Every technological object,
every machine, inherits from numerous disparate machines, even if it
itself produces only a singular descendent (for example, a series of
videotapes of a particular format, from a camcorder).]

Given the potential for continuous production, it should be noted as well
that feedback loops of a sort may also be realized. Thus, if M'k itself
produces a component x that can replace a component Mj, then a new
collapse {M}j' is initiated, in which Mx occurs, continuing the production
of M'. Of course this contradicts the ontology of the practico-material
substrate, since we are now talking about a temporally later splay; the
feedback is negated as such in relation to the temporal linearity of the
production. [I see this as a red-herring, whose analysis, inordinately
complex, falls under the aegis of the social philosophy of technology, the
consumption and production of new models, issues of fashion and
functionality, etc. For the moment it is only to be noted that feedback is
never a-temporal, but always after the fact; in an operational amplifier,
for example, the speed of feedback - close to the speed of light in the
return loop - may appear to act synchronously upon events, but this is
only the result of the relative difference between the temporal magnitude
of events and looping - a difference of great magnitude.]

There is no first tool N1; every tool presupposes another. There is no
originary tool N0 as well. [The presupposition is, of course, as fuzzy as
everything else; one might carve a hand-axe with 'natural' elements, or
make a walking-stick by breaking a branch. But the machinic itself is part
and parcel of the body; culture is always technological. Likewise, just as
there is no origin for language, there is no originary tool; the
pointing-finger is a tool for direction, the turning-head a vision-tool,
and so forth. Likewise, there is no implied transcendence as well - only
an inchoate series of fuzzy shifts.]

There is no identity operation; equivalences are defined by models,
typifications, tolerances, and the like. There is forking which results in
equivalence, and collapsed forking which results in collapse-production.
The moment of production is always contains a parasitology of noise and an
energy input; the moment, in fact, plays/splays into issues of
thermodynamic and cybernetic entropy. [Thus the machinic is the self-play
or jostling of the world. And the world is a world of information,
encodings, ruptures, and dissolutions: The world is the aegis of the word.
The world is the aegis of the world.]

According to this model, the machinic is inseparable from the bodies which
augment, prostheticize, and catalyze it; technology and biology are
mutually emergent. [And both are mutually submerged as well - tacit as
well, within the originary non-existent moment of language. The
epistemology at work is one of elision, ellipsis, erasure, gliding...]

Who has traced back even a single lineage, for example, that of a
needle-nosed pliers, into its components, ancestors, materials, entropies,
production energies? After one or two generations, everything is lost; the
machines among us carry the signs of lineage, but these become quickly
inchoate, lost in the heat and fire of molding, forging, mixture, and so
forth. Every machine is an erasure, appearing as if born from nothing,
tending towards everything. Every machine is a stranger among us,
including our own flesh, our own bodies; the world is transformed into a
re/productive mirror. [Every machine cauterizes, eliminates, its ancestry;
in a sense, that is a major characteristic of machinery, whose domain is
that of functionality - a domain within which both history and memory are
intrusions.] [A memory machine is a contradiction in terms; a memory
machine reproduces the other. Within the chain A -> B -> C, every machine,
every term, is isolated; A operates and conspires in the production of B,
but A is already a withdrawal, a cleansing. B has entered another
sub-world altogether, another domain or phenomenological horizon. It is
always the case, and it is in this sense that the world is always the
case.]

( Production note: I wrote this originally as stand-alone companion piece
to the genealogy of machines. But then I disguised it through various
irreversible (many-to-one, one-to-many) transformations, as if I were
afraid to reveal my thought to you. Now I find it again, in the backwoods
of another computer; it holds its own, and I return it, unencumbered, to
you, as if for the very first time. So I might thank David Bohm here for
his discussions on making, art, harmony, and fitting, and the early 70s
Brown University Systems Group, to which I somewhat belonged. - Alan
Sondheim, Alan Sondheim, what are you afraid of? )

Everything goes into the [component of the] machine.
The machine is composed of nearly decomposable subsystems.
Each subsystem contributes to the whole.
Each fits within a harmonious fit or art. 
The whole is the fit or art.
Within every component there are substances.
Within every component there is substance.
A machine is a functional substance.
The machine is a collapse of components and substances.
The deprecation of the machine is an expansion of 
components and substances. A great breathing is the machine.
The machine! The machine!

"Yeah, but what if Matrix Reloaded is whack?"

Death and Mr. Griffith

Death, the consequence of Adam's sin, universal, characterized, inflicted
as a punishment, vanquished by Christ, prayers and exhortations
concerning, excluded from heaven, persons exempted from, spiritual,
deliverance from by Christ, eternal, the second death, salvation from by
Christ, of Christ foretold, voluntary, its object, of saints, of Abraham,
of the wicked, of Korah, of Hophni and Phinehas, of Absalom, of Jezebel,
of Haman, LEST I SLEEP THE SLEEP OF DEATH, PLANTED IN LIKENESS OF HIS
DEATH, O! Adam, why hast thou done this to me, O! Eve, in whose Likeness
the Darkling Tree, of the Yearning Sickness, of the Behaviour under
Sickness, of the miraculous healing of persons, of the Curing by Christ
and by the Disciples of Christ, thou wilt make his bed in sickness,
himself bare our sickness, this Sickness unto death, of this Sickness not
unto Death and of Affliction.

'I adopted the flash-back to build suspense, which till then had been a
missing quantity in picturedramas. Instead of showing a continuous view of
a girl floating downstream in a barrel, I cut into the film by flashing
back to incidents that contributed to the scene and explained it.' (D. W.
Griffith)
 
(The above is a left-over phrase from another piece. Think of a GIRL
FLOATING in a BARREL: think of sensory-deprivation, the immanent womb, the
GIRL going DOWN. What explanation could be necessary? On the other hand,
the text itself is an explanatory regnum, applicable to any situation
requiring a CUT or division.)

Jack got up. His "considerations," as he called them, had
taken all morning. The new sun-room was warm and inviting.
He closed his eyes and dreamed. Mary would be home from the
university in an hour or so.

my new life by inspiron 3800


i had winme replaced by redhat 7, which ran lean, in spite of lack of 
sound support. i upgraded to redhat 8, which requires really at least 128 
ram, and 128 was added to my 64, and now everything is smooth. terminals 
and graphic environments flicker back and forth; who knows where we are on 
this journey through life? as basho says, 'days and months are travellers 
of eternity.'

Moshi Moshi

Hello Nikuko. We will make an agreement. Your presence will be in my echo.
You will be a reflection of my language, otherwise a disappearance. Is
this a political gesture? I'm not sure. It will be up to you to decide.
I'm fine. How are you? I'm here to see if you can live through me. I
recognize this sounds absurd, but who knows? Stranger things have
happened.
I didn't come naked and broken to you at all! I came in good will, just to
see if your erasure will effect anything. After all, people don't think
you're alive in the first place! Moshi moshi?
I thought you might speak Japanese, a language I don't know, but then this
standard telephone greeting, a pause or gap in the conversation.
Why should it bother me? Nothing bothers me at this point.
It doesn't, Nikuko - you're confusing, your mixing my words.
Yes, I did say that. You'll be erased forever except through this text.
Your words will be a dead whisper. Nothing will remain...
Yes, it is such a healthy way!
I have no desires for you at all, Nikuko, no matter what you do with your
panties. I don't even have desires for "panties" or any other seven-letter
word!
What don't you understand? I'm trying to draw you out of yourself...
Yes, moshi moshi! What do you think of it?
I'm not going through anything in my life! Hell, everything is good at the
moment! You're not helping very much with my project.
And I have no interest whatsoever in turning you on or fucking you! What's
got into you? Nikuko, whatever are you about?
The boys don't say anything about this. They're elsewhere. I'd ask you to
look around, but I don't think you have eyes....
There's no real reason to any of this. It might be just a pre-text to a
text, a pre-text to writing a text -
I'm not yearning or crying, Nikuko; I'm not programmed to do that -
I've been looking at that, or rather looking at the screen. Moshi moshi,
and nothing happens at all. No matter what I do, nothing happens. Even my
imagination is at a loss here. How absurd!
I'd love you like crazy if I had to pay! What do you have in mind?
What makes me believe that? That you keep coming on to me, as if all you
want to do is fuck. Nikuko, this is print, nothing more. And you're not
really saying anything at all.
It doesn't explain a single thing!
If there is some girl, it's not you!
Positive!
Moshi moshi?
Yes, and now you're going in circles, the dialog is closing in, closing
down, we're all near the stage of disembodied memory and loss.
Your frocks are irrelevant here, your politics are more important,
whatever is embedded within you.
I'm not afraid; there is no pain or perhaps too much pain to go around.
I don't think so.
I'm sure from my own experience and travels. I can hear the voice now, but
it's not your voice of course...
I didn't come any way, broken or naked or otherwise... I'll end, I'm
coming to an end now, and goodbye...
Goodbye

Please please don't ever leave me.

Transmissions and Empires


the following list of representative countries and domains was gathered
from google - the first 100 entries of the (anglicized) country name
filtered to the domain. the british commonwealth has a strong showing; the
u.s. is weak, taking .com, .mil, etc. for granted. some countries divide
among others. google of course is never neutral, and the search was in the
linguistic empire of english.

the boy stood on the burning deck
his father brave was dead -
the ship was sinking rapidly -
the chaplain turned and said

sing out, my lad, the tearful strains
will god almighty reach -
it's time to pray and time to die
no longer time to preach -

the boy took heed and left his perch
against the stalwart mast -
and boy and preacher sang to god
the words that were their last -

dear lord bear us to heaven fast -
our worldly cares are passed -

Cranial


These texts are cranial; they spider google, collect/collapse, as if
google were the world-lightning of the net, those waveforms pointing to
convulsive solitons, moments of sudden and implicit revelation, turned out
matrices of phenomenal submergences. The world-lightning ruptures, creates
symptoms without direction, shadow-glows of truths close to toppling,
anything but absolute facticity. Furious cumulonimbus cauterizes any
conceivable functionality. You've got to understand the incomprehension of
the symbolic, and google is such evidence; the world temporarily gives
way, only to close again on confusion, cues and clues. Of this I haven't
learned but a name which collapses: "Alan Sondheim" or a new hiatus: "at",
"7" "au", "56" "br", "2" "ca", "19" "cc", "1" "com", "245" "de", "18"
"dk", "3" "edu", "139" "hu", "1" "ie", "1" "it", "1" "jp", "3" "net", "40"
"nl", "2" "no", "1" "org", "352" "ph", "6" "pt", "1" "to", "1" "uk", "98".  
Within the top thousand, a collection of domains centered on organization,
followed by commerce, and not a military sighting in the group. (Of the
full list, include me in your army!.)
