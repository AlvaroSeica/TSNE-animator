Unable to draw a distinction among wire, body, fraud, I die wracked
against the triode that belongs to your presence. This is a capability of

towards the asymptote of a complete stop as a black hole opened between
us. My clothes fell open, and I could feed her forever. And in that manner
of landscape, breasts worthy of slip-fault, milk: desire in the house of 
death, dead of speaking wires, "Cloth."

Jealous of other theory, of the difficulty with theory, I proceed with
fear, with care, delineating/inscribing a territory I can call my own.
This is the only work I do comfortably; my life _elsewhere_ is a matter 
of confusion, and anxiety that leaves me sleepless. I am well aware of 
the fragility of theory, its past-anterior ex-formation which slots it
back into the death 				    constituted as a

I don't want to watch the decay of these words, epitaph as they are, the
worn-out of the world, carapace or skin sloughed to the bone. I want to
die when Jennifer dies. Jennifer wants to die when Julu dies. These are
moments of little purport, but they present the world, and not only that:
They are the world's pillars, without which nothing would survive.

Dear Everyone,

Ah hell, I'm just worn out. I've been trying to put courses together for
the coming fall and spring, and getting just about nowhere. I go through
intensive negotiations and hysteria on my end for a basic access course on
their end, or a course dealing with Net psychology paying almost nothing,
and I've been trying to do this over and over again at any number of ins-
titutions in four different cities. I'm getting worn down by this. I just
don't care. I think of starving myself. I've actually lost twelve pounds
but I needed to lose twelve pounds because I was up to one sixty which is
high for me mainly because of continuous depression. Now I'm going down I
hope to one forty-four but I weighed down only to one forty-eight which
comes through if you do the math or even if you don't.

Some of this is funny, like talking to myself, catching myself up because
I sound either like my father or that old bachelor (me) that lives up-
stairs on Dean Street which I pretty much am, but don't want to own up to.
I do spend some of my time secretly thinking I'm a genius, but even more
time wishing I had a girlfriend here so that I could finally relax with
someone so that even if I'm homeless or not eating all that well there
will be someone to talk to without making a long distance call, but even
Jodee has moved away and everyone else is in the protective custody of
their own coupleship, so who cares. I can always do another text. I hear
from Alice by snailmail who says I don't respond, but my printer doesn't
work all that well so I try calling her but I never get an answer; either
I'm calling at the wrong time or something's up with the phone. I do have
other close long-distance relationships, but they are always splintered,
never quite real, no matter how extreme the occasional writing.

The lists don't hold me like they used to - there's a lot of repetition of
course, and I need more than the presence of disembodied language at this
point. And I always feel responsible for some of the administration, now
ongoing for more than three years, as well as advertising, etc. It's
never-ending, and doesn't seem real. I get up around noon (nights are hot,
sleepless, insomniac), sometimes in tears, get on-line, do whatever cor-
rections I need to do for the day, send out personal letters and impers-
onal answers, etc. I eat at a place called the Silver Spoon for lunch. I
return here and nap or work on-line. I eat at home for diner, or "find
something" cheap at a bodega. I watch the news. I nap. I read all the time
through this. Out of pure defensiveness, I'm never without a book, without
reading. I may watch a sitcom or two at night. I continue writing, answer-
ing letters, reading on-line stuff, reading off-line stuff. I go to sleep
now around dawn. I stare where the clouds are light. That is my life.
There's usually a phonecall a day, but this is over-compensated for by
three-hundred messages or so. I send out around forty still, sometimes as
little as twenty, sometimes as many as sixty. I live half-disembodied,
have drowning in writing. Eric Anderson, Danish Fluxus artist years ago,
told me I was destined to be a "bookmaker" (screamed Buchmacher). I think
I've more than fulfilled this useless ambition - useless, because the
writing's without context.

I eat tofu, applesauce, instant coffee, cold cereal, light pasta, bamboo,
artichoke hearts, peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches. I have two luxuries
- a cordless phone (I'm always pleading somewhere) and sending my laundry
out - it comes back folded. I buy almost everything used. I pass on what-
ever I can, whenever I can. I take losses, get more reading. I need a new
modem, PC monitor, battery for one of the laptops. They'll have to last me
a few more years. I'm still married to Allison, but when I find the time,
I'll apply for divorce; I feel too encumbered by everything around me,
still, to do this at the moment. I will probably stay in New York the rest
of my life, living close to the edge. It's a _bad_ existence, in the way
that existence itself, in Sartre's early imagination, might be said to be
_bad,_ the stuff that Nausee came out of, but without recompense or money
for the tune. (I do stay in touch with my family. I couldn't survive with-
out them. They're across two countries, however, and it's difficult. Noth-
ing is _within the reach of an arm's lenght._ Nothing at all.)

(Speaking of _arm's length,_ I fell asleep last night trying to think of
the longest words with one vowel - from "length" I went to "strengths" -
this is of course including _y_. There is also "syzygy" which could be
considered voweless, and my favorite "cwm" which has to be, in spite of
its Welsh origins.)

Meanwhile I try and think of new things to teach; I could teach PC stuff
at this point, linux, creative writing, theory, studio, and tons of other
stuff but no one wants to hire someone fifty-four because I'm supposed to
be past retirement; anyway, there must be something wrong with me because
I've taught part-time at I think 16-17 institutions so far and I don't
have great clothes even for interviewing, were I ever called. So I'm dis-
placed in the social order of things, but then again everyone my age is -
although the others my age (I don't know anyone who's not a lot younger
than me, so I have to change the "others my age" to "others in their
forties") are all relatively secure with houses and lofts and apartments
and galleries and stuff like that. (I'm supposed to be be not only past
retirement, but useless, abandoned, collecting my rewards, relaxing, an
old man in a leisure suit. I'd _literally_ rather be dead.)

So there are two people, small press people, who said they were bringing
out some of my Jennifer stuff in hard-copy, but I think one of them is
screwing around with me, and the other is delayed because of no money so
it won't ever happen. Now I'm supposed to get a book out of my art and
theory stuff, and there is a publisher lined up and all that kind of thing
and it will be my fourth commercial book, not to mention all the other
published spew, but you can see that and about $.75 will get me a cup of
coffee at least for the time-being, not much more.

I can't help but dream of getting involved with everyone for friendship
sex love within four-hundred feet of me walking down the street, because I
can't see clearer much farther. And my long-distance relationships remain
long-distance and there's nothing I can do about them, whether they're
hate, love, friendship, raconteur, or colleague, although I've never had
the last which seems the rarest. Sometimes people say they want to collab-
orate with me; that would pass for colleague, and there are two dancers
here in the city that want to work with me, and I keep think of surgery/
prosthesis as part of the content of what would be the dance. I can't keep
up with them because they're both brilliant dancers, well-known here, and
I'm submerged in my loft. Sometimes when I walk around now, having lost
twelve pounds, I feel an enormous freedom in my body, as if it's leaning
against the air, and I dream of going anorectic so that I can finally make
an exit; the grandfather of someone I was involved with starved himself to
death after and when he felt useless, and I don't know what the family's
attitude was about that, but it seemed to be one of acceptance, I'm not
sure.

I'm going to my brother's home in Victoria in about six weeks, August 19,
if any of you are up in B.C. I hope to get back to the old-growth forests
which create stability even for the most borderline of us, and I can pre-
tend I'm moving there, to somewhere civilized, to teach, climb, and think.
In the meantime, I wait by the phone for a call offering relief, a real
job, anything here. I dream at night of sexual enslavement, taking on the
position of the masochist; I move in and out of Jennifer-July identities,
and all of this is admittedly escapist - there's nothing to worry about if
I'm tied up, controlled by someone, or churning through the J-J files in
linux, or losing myself in the obscure vagaries of emacs, the linux editor
which I've been using for my recent work.

It's always the work that carries me, that gives me a reason to exist, al-
ways trying to break new ground, before the ground breaks me. Sometimes
it's a stand-off, and sometimes I feel I've actually done something. While
I have a fear of academically-trained theorists, who can recite far better
than I can, I continue to hope that I'm still moving ahead in this regard
as well. I'm most frightened of being left behind, of my work becoming ir-
relevant, and the longer I write about "cyberspace," the more I think it
won't hold up in the end - the last thing I want to be is a social commen-
tator, broke, with now around three thousand pages of relatively useless
writing sitting on a site.

Then secretly I'll turn around within myself, and think, I'm making pro-
gress, I'll get a job, I'll be in a loving relationship, there's even a
community around the corner - I just have to get the next phonecall, try
again for that elusive perfect text which will cement everything, fore-
stall the depression at my door. Like believing in a talisman like the
object of Lacan, always out of reach, sliding in and out of the imaginary.
It's the teaching in fact, as well as programming errors, that keeps me in
bounds, allows me to function at all. (And it's not that I expect happi-
ness at this point - I don't - but just the opportunity to exist with
_the presence of another voice_ and a sense of stability.)

In the dead of winter, I would still like to make it up to Newfoundland,
but I'm out of touch with Lisa - I'd love to go and see the icebergs, feel
the gales. I've been in blizzards before, and never so much alive.

love to Everyone, and say hello for me,

Alan

Subject: Dance Collaboration


			All dancing is diirty.

( bodies sweat, contact, anorexia sets in, a dancer just died here today,
the body wants from nothing )

I think of the dance as a whirl without consent, like the body burning, on
fire, like frozen in hysteria: and then I think I do that and my heart
bursts open, and blood everywhere, this burst heart! And then I no longer
	   think, my whirling body-heart, body-burst-heart!

( like a singer without a song, totally open to the world, no computer, no
prosthetics, glasses, tampax, nothing encumbering, the dance opens up as
if there were no need, as if there were heavenly bodies, as if there were
floats and floatations, as if suspensions )

    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this
 burst-heart-body, world roiling and heaving system fast rotation and
				wobble

( the world's subsumed within the dance, it's a symptom, it's there as an
extension or an afterthought - the world is the afterthought of the dance
- it wobbles on varying pivots, it gyroscopes in varying axes, it twists
and turns, it turns away the face, the face of the world is the dance )

I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be
		  quite dangerous wobble turn around

Losing Track


At the age of 25 I decided I wanted to write philosophy. To write a 
text implies working through domains without guideposts, recuperating
older strata, looking up through the dissemination of the wide world's
information. Part of me believed that I was writing the world itself, 
that a secret would manifest its bones, and with that would come power.

Never earthly, the power would equate knowledge with interstitial
longings, and hence with a triumphant mastery of death. Space and time
were not far behind.

I could never listen to music with pleasure because of textual ab- 
sence; instead, music became a dialog I abandoned after a furious
wager with high-speed sound. Music took far too much for granted,
lending itself to pure jouissance. I would head towards video, film,
writing, and always writing - writing which could describe the world
in a singularity, the compression of everything into - not only the
symbolic, but also a token such as V, a set-theoretical universe.

Once V was announced, it was criss-crossed by rules which in fact
exhausted V: V was nothing but the domain of those rules, Godel not-
withstanding. The rules of the real of course prove much more intract-
able; in fact, they may not be rules (which are top-down) at all, so
much as part-objects, bottom-up operations with superstructural mani-
festations that take on the appearance of relative simplicity. The
unsolvable n-body problems are good examples.

Eventually, I became certain I had nothing to contribute on this level
- that is, to the concrete progress produced by science and technology
- for example, solutions or heuristics for fundamental particle the- 
ory. I was too undisciplined, too resistant, for that.

Instead, I became concerned with the interrelationship among these
abstract systems and consciousness, the interstices of structures,
bodies, minds, and the symbolic, plateaued throughout by an imagin- 
ary. Such was the case that _muck_ necessarily surfaced in this in-
vestigation, a muck that created _discomfort_ among those workers on
the surface who took the mines for granted.

My work has been in the mines, in the shafts, across the occasional
surface irruption. It explores the depths, not recursively, but with a
sense of ennui, longing, and the depths are not infinite, just as the
symbolic is not an infinite concatenation of broken strings.

More like a Sierpinski Sponge imagined without the recursion, depths
are unfounded, unfounding, and as I am fond of saying, unaccountable,
and unaccounted-for: hence, an other. And more than or to this, I am
also fond of saying that they generate and reflect _the neurotic style
of the world,_ a style necessarily repetitive, obsessive, scarred and
sutured, a style which has always already effaced itself, just as
language as the appearance of each and every determination.

Thus the neurotic, not schizz, may have a hold or grasp on the world,
just as the paranoid comprehends sociobiology in its entirety.

In relation to everything here, there is institutionalization, the
conundrum of institutions. Wild theory is incomprehensible in the face
of the propriety of regulated reference, footnotes, and a dedication
to reasoned argument. I would argue, wildly and unsuccessfully, that
this reasoned argument always already precludes, firewalls, forecloses
the _muck,_ which is not just a matter of a psychoanalytical and/or
rational approach, but also a seeping, oozing, within and without the
discomfort of the (borderlined) reader. In this regard, the muck-text
is as much performative, process, as it is discursive formation. And
in this regard, it remains difficult to translate, suitcase.

On the other hand, it is easy to descend or ascent to a superstruct- 
ural surface that purports, through skimming (surfing) to present a
laissez-faire chaotic mapping of nomadic chains, in lieu of comprehen-
sion. And it is easy for me to fool myself that something has been
accomplished, beyond the demonstration of a new command, application,
or Net phenomenon: And if anything salvages these texts, it's the
embarrassment, shame, dirtiness, muck, psychotic flirtations, that
refuse to let go, after the command, application, or Net phenomenon
has been deciphered.

When I began years ago, I developed the notion of two regimes, the
construct and the experiential. The former was external to temporal
systems, and an idealized graph of equivalences or transforms; the
latter was messy, carried motility within it, and problematized the
very nodes and vectors that created the appearances of entities and
processes. The two modes intersected in what I later called state or
process-oriented graphs. Within this scheme, wild theory is, of
course, experiential; traditional discursive formations, on the other
hand, appear as-if-grounded in the construct. Thus an ideal academic
discourse might be considered a database, allowing the recuperation of
argument, revisitation rights/rites, and footnoting allowing the dis-
course to partake of others observing the same protocols. While this
constructs a language-practice ultimately based on the Enlightenment
(or for that matter Euclid), it also precludes both the problematic of
reception (beyond reception-theory) and those very cognitive proces-
ses that grant the text its semantics in the first place.

So that, by harboring texts within the experiential as primary (as my
texts attempt), grounds and reasoned discourse are instead problemati- 
zed - not in favor of anarchic feeling - but in terms of those tradi-
tionally analytic part-objects (such as this text to some extent) that
appear within them. 

This certainly reduces the necessity of grounds for 'em. *

* And also unfortunately reduces the community of readers, who are no
longer guided by those tokens of footnote/reference/etc. that I have
referenced here, and that provide the ability to cross-translate, as
well as reaffirm a foreclosed but relatively friendly academe. _This_
work, instead, is wounded, refusing to heal, apparently establishing
no discourse, critique; and in this sense, it is a corpse of work, not
corpus. Later, a corpse will give birth to new forms of life; now, it
is an uncomfortable object in the room, leaking onto the table, spil-
ling onto the floor.

Two Consecutive Spam Posts Forwarded From Jennifer:


Let us examine this. From Jennifer - who forwarded the spam, not created
it. And the spam, as part-object, has a beauty of its own, reference to
Jennifer, back into the matrix. As the novel itself (Austen?) was trans-
formed into matrix itself, devolved and splayed across newsgroups, turn-
ing ISP connections into overload, collapse. 

Who is Chris Lewis? I knew him, one of him, in Atlanta, but hardly a
pedophile, Canadian or otherwise. And why his name across this group,
what sort of revenge, or is it in fact disguising other structures? For
not all of the posts (and there are many of course) utilize the same 
subject; in fact, the subjects are scattered in parallel decoration in
columnar format.

But there is enticement as well: the _broken speech,_ _broken subject_:
"When I was a girl at school "

Which falls from a _visual cliff_

Into ?

I downloaded pornographic image after image tonight, from several news-
groups, trying each out as desktop, central or tiled. Nothing worked; the
woman, Jennifer, perhaps, was absent; there was no sign, no signifier,
nothing but parallel attitudes, the bodies inscribed by genetic differ-
ence, lure (which elsewhere I have related to primitive mathesis across
dyads, strange attractors, absorptions, as in rings and other structures).

One found a causeway in the breast or raised and open eyes. But here, in
alt.2600, _across_ other groups, grouped others, a skein pours plateaus,
lineages. The body has become transparent membrane, much like the Net
itself; it can be said truly of this novel that there is no author; it can
be said it is a writerly text, writing itself, performative; it flexes

On Fire


I have been working on the Internet Text for the past three and a half
years. There should be 3000 pages of text, 50-100 images, some of which
are at Paula Davidson's site, and some of which are scattered among the
Virginia and ANU URLs. I have written daily, with perhaps 3-5 days break
during this period. Posts have ranged from 1-4 per diem. There has been,
not so much an evolution, as a circumambulation, roaming from community
to community, OS to OS, up and down layers (protocols, MOO hierarchies,
languages), across sites (Jennifer and Julu accounts on clara.julu.net,
surfing the Web, Netscape from 1.0 to 4.+) and machines. I have pushed
neurosis, hysteria, depression, and psychosis to the breaking point; I
have turned discursive formations into performative spew, wild theory,
Marianne Faithful, Broken English.

I am on fire; I am hot on-line, burning through letters to the hard core
of something indecipherable, monstrous. I place ice in my hole, one hole
and my body tenses, hardens into perfect arrow. Hair burning, language
sears itself in the stars. (Burn of first, second, third degree. Your-
skin-graft across me, your surgery-gift, sutures. Death, crystal, mud,
sound, feather, web-server. My last memory of lights gone out.)

But why the constancy of writing, the obsession against which the text is
measured by ream, weight, megabyte? This addiction underlies all others;
it rebuilds the world, and fills it. The condom-balloon of semen-text,
sement, hangs the skein together between myself and what penetration you
succeed in, what bullets hole the skull. I can never see through your eye
nor would I want to.

Younger, speech was my fear and hysteria. I'd prop the world up until I
discovered the violence of humor. The prop moved to the talking-cure,
self-employed. I wouldn't let myself alone. I'd rip my chest open, demon-
strate my organs; blooded text guaranteed some truth, now replaced in the
Internet Text with the pain and sweat of continuity.

For it is an accomplishment, a continuous meditation that won't let go. I
have never spoken so consistently, or for so long, before. I have never
worked so carefully, uncompromising, pressing face against the window as
the train pulls out. It's a smoggy night in German, 1943, and my con-
sciousness is slamming out in small-town Pennsylvania.

Now I must go to sleep and attend to my Jennifer.

The Writing


"Writing is a kind of Black Mass he celebrates every evening (before, when
he did nothing else, he preferred writing late at night, between midnight
and three in the morning) when, alone in a room he thinks of as a hole in
the world, a room silhouetted against universal darkness by the single
pool of light from his lamp that reveals a white page, he annihilates the
world and himself merely by the corrosive work of his mind, constructs out
of ink a universe which is drawn from - outlined against - the real and
which, in a bundle of pages greedily accumulated and counted, is the only
one which belongs to him: the Non-Universe, the annihilated universe."

( From The Traitor, Andre Gorz. )
( You will recognize his name, the illuminated screen. You will understand
the mode of reminiscence, the open hole, the corrosion. You will read into
annihilation that violation-fabric which constitutes the building of the
tawdry, sleazy, world, from the remnants of drooled ink, tattered pages,
dim bulbs against a war-time real. )
( You will know that all real is always already war-time. You will think
through this, the mode of reminiscence, into another scene. But there is
no other. )
( And you will call this _the curtailing._)

			 Woman, Writing, Hand



				  i

Are you going to tell me I'm the first one to have discovered this stuff? 
That it was hidden for centuries, for all time, that no one but me had the
slightest clue? That this simplest of things, trivial, really, was com-
pletely unknown, or at least relatively so - that it was just a matter of
time until I came across it? ( The beauty woman has left the room; if she
was reading this over my shoulder, if she was listening to my heart beat,
she gave no sign; not a movement or expression was out of step; she seemed
placid, calm, in the face of my usual hurricane, wreckage, debris. She
took no notice of me, my face, hands. ) 

				  ii

I'm sick of textual gaming when people are dying. Every word is worth its
weight in gold; it may be the last cry of someone heading into the darkest
space of all. Anything else is surplus, privileged, the wealth of the rich
over the violent anger of the poor, hysteria of the starved. Beware the
game which sutures the wide smiling face.

				 iii

I'm ill; the apartment temperature is 90 f; I can't think, went to bed at
7:30 this morning, woke up on the floor near the airconditioning with bad
dreams; shuddering and nauseous, unable to think; what happens to writing
in this condition; _it_ vomits; whatever I say, passes out. 

				  iv

Dreaming of a girl who doesn't exist, meeting her at a non-existent party
in Victoria, pale with glasses, short; she presses her body against me; I
can't remember writing like this; there's a future in it while the alarm
goes off; scene changes and she's dead forever. What did she say that I
can't write? Nightmares of solitude.

				  v

Wasting time when there's no time to waste; I have 25 more years, that's
all, and I find myself playing games, reading detective novels, not work-
ing, not thinking; thinking, in the sense of empathetic investigation,
should be full-time; otherwise, my project collapses. Writing should be
peripheral, on the horizon, the result of careful, planned thought and
experience. Writing is called forth in the continuous face of death; I
remind myself that some text will always remain unfinished. 

				  vi

A _writing-jag_ when the text no longer matters, when it escapes, takes on
a foolish life of its own: _I_ escape into triviality; it sustains me;
later, I erase.

				 vii

What I come across is myself, in the form of a _featured_ woman across ap-
plications, desires, protocols, softwares, regions, countries, internets.
This is never a matter of pure comprehension; she allows me to take on a
life of my own; she pushes me into the borders; the borders had not pre-
viously existed; I inhabit DMZs; I wander; stuttering, I chant her words
or the words of the other. She gives me name. I give her head.

				 viii

What I come across is another, sitting across from me in this computer
lab; she is typing with one hand, and I notice her other hand, resting
comfortably on her lap, remains fixed in a singular position. I cannot
help but wonder if it is prosthetic, at rest; if it is in fact a sculp-
tural implement; or if it is simply cramped. It is a beautiful hand, at
easy with the body that contains it. ( She is about 30, lightly dressed in
the heat, brown hair. She sits sideways at the console. ) 

				  ix

The writing, uncontained with the body, seeps out across the editor. The
distinction, one editor rubbed against another, is what creates writing's
_stuff,_ its weight, its exhaustion as it imitates breath. _Sounding_ the
depths of a text transforms it back into the body's resonance; your speak-
ing is the breathing once again of the space of your throat and lungs into
me. I dream of our slow and mutual exhalations.

				  x

Her hand has still not moved; perhaps her arm, her right side, in fact, is
entirely artificial, attached, just as the other approaches across the do-
main of writing, of and not of me, a disturbance in the field of this con-
sciousness.

				  xi

When I save this text in Pico, Control-O, there is a fast and furious er-
ror, a quick scrolling adding hundreds of empty lines, until I bale out.
Writing constructs its own void through misapprehensions, misrecognition;
I remain elsewhere, fielding correction, as if there were an inherent eti-
quette to the text.

				 xii

The woman has left the room, her arm extended, her hand remaining in the
same position; her everyday life reveals the limits of her prosthesis, no
longer what is or is not essential. Writing is my equivalence, all that
keeps me from death, borderlined as my dreams are of dream-screens, spit
language, splintered teeth, the raw roar of unencumbered sound.

				 xiii

The woman has left the room, her chair, computer vacated, blanked, dark.

				 xiv

The woman has left the room.

EARLY IMPORTANT NET DOCUMENTS (1972)



SCENARIOS for Using the ARPANET at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUT-
ER COMMUNICATION (ICCC) from 1972 is the first guide to what later became
the Internet. The front page of this is illustrated in Peter Salus' Casting
the Net. The conference ran from October 24-26 in Washington, D.C. The 62-
page SCENARIOS was published by the ARPA Network Information Center of the
Stanford Research Institute, in Menlo Park, California. 

A copy of the guide is with the BBN Library, and I have been tracking some
of the material down. The ICCC was the first real introduction of the Net
to the (professional) public, and this then becomes the first how-to, with
examples indicating the thinking of the Net community vis-a-vis usage and
implementation. This is the sociology, not the technical history of the
Net, then. At the ICCC, there were a number of terminals; participants
could walk among them, and log in. Each "scenario" connected to a differ-
ent application, located somewhere across the United States.

The following, which I have now in xerox form, are the programs and the
scenarios:

PROGRAM				SCENARIO

English Language Conversational Programs
DOCTOR				BBN DOCTOR     [Eliza-type program]
SCHOLAR				SCHOLAR
PARRY				SAIL PARRY
TIMMY				UCLA-NMC Sigma-7

Data Base Query
NIC				SRI-ARC  ["general intellectual tasks"]
NETWRK				MIT-DMCG PDP-10
APE				SAIL AP HOTline    [Associated Press]

Games
CHESS				BBN CHESS
CHESS				MIT-AI PDP-10
LIFE				BBN LIFE     [Conway's game]
JOTTO				MIT-AI PDP-10

Network File Transfer			[developed later into ftp]
SMFS				SRI-ARC
RJS				Remote Job Service

Miscellaneous
ABACUS				UCLA-NMC Sigma-7
HELP				UCLA-NMC Sigma-7

Programming Languages
SPEAKEZ				SPEAKEASY
PPL				HARVARD PDP-10
FORTRAN				BBN Tenex
FORTRAN				UCLA-CCN 360/91 TSO

Remote Job Entry
RJS				Remote Job Service

Symbolic Algebraic Manipulation
MACSYMA				Mathlab's MACSYMA

There is a table of contents, which also lists MIT H645 Multics, which
apparently provided mail; mail was also available through BBN Tenex
itself. For those not familiar, BBN is Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc.,
responsible for the first IMP, basically routers, that were the founda-
tion of the Arpanet. IMP = Interface Message Processor.

SRI-ARC (NIC) was set up at HOST #2 in the room. Control characters were
indicated by an up-arrow sign, which later must have transformed into the
current ^. For example, Control-a allowed backspace with delete; Control-
c returned control to the TENEX EXECUTIVE SYSTEM (which roughly parallels
Control-c for ending execution in Unix, linux, or DOS); and Control-t
"checked to see if the system is still there," similar to the "are you
there" command in some telnet programs.

Other commands included, of course, DEL, CR (carriage return), etc. Com-
mands were preceded by @. 

The SAIL AP Hotline was at HOST #11, "a direct Associated Press news line
carrying national and international news. The AP Hotline has been
interfaced to the SAIL system at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory. Any terminal on the ARPA Network can be turned into an AP news
line by running program 'HOT' at Sail."

The following setup had to be performed first:
echo remote;
insert linefeed after every carriage return
login to SAIL
LOGGER says you're being connected
T R OPEN says you're connected, both transmit and receive.

Then a second login opens the particular program; the word is "hot" with
some other commands:
r hot <CR>
(in other words, type r, space, hot, carriage return).
You then get the linefeed from AP until you type...
Control-c.

Finally, let's look at the UCLA-NMC HELP at HOST #1. The description is
probably that of the first on-line example of hypertext (and very very
early hypertext as well):

"HELP is a subsystem at UCLA-NMC which permits a user to interrogate a
database which is organized in directed graph form. Each vertex of the
graph has a paragraph of information, including some information about
further details which can be obtained from vertices which are reachable
from the current one.

"Thus, the user moves from vertex to vertex, investigating each item as his
interest directs."

The login sequence is six steps. You then login:
LOGIN iccc <CR>
and get a return:
JOB STARTED
Then you type
help <CR>
and get
NNN HELP STARTED
where NNN ps the PID, or process number assigned to HELP.
You next read
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM?
no <CR>
and you get a tutorial.
Or you can answer yes, and then read:
ENTER A SERVICE NAME, X, or ?
to get a list of things you can get help about...

Here are the help functions:
HELP - short description
LOGIN - ditto
MSG - "how to use our message processor"
NETWORK - "tutorials on network resources"
SRVYGRAPH
TELNET        -       note this early appearance of TELNET for the public!
SURVEY - "some random comments"

-----------------------------------------------

One of the critical papers presented at this ICCC is "THE NETWORK CONTROL
CENTER FOR THE ARPA NETWORK," which monitored the IMPs. It was written by
Alexander A. McKenzie, Bernard P. Cosell, John M. McQuillan, and Martin J.
Thorpe. I have a copy of the preprint.

Here is a list of node from it, from TABLE 2: SUMMARY OF NETWORK OPERATION

May 1971	15 nodes
June		15
July		15
August		15
September	18          2,892 Average Host Intersite Output
October		18	    5,329 (packets/node/day)
November	18	    6,473
December	19	    5,679
January 72	19          9,055

The average line outage during these segments ranged from .59% to 3.21%.
The average IMP downtime ranged from 1.77% to 5.50%.

Here are some of the reasons for the IMP downtimes:
Main frame problems, repair, unknown.
High voltage, test, repair power transients.
Intermittent core stack IMP move.
Software, repair, site Host test.
Site power down.
Blown fuses.
Software bug.
New system reload, NCC error. [NCC = Network Control Center]

Then as now, the questions at the end of the paper concerned issues of
bandwidth:

"What are the peak hours of network use and what is the peak-to-average
traffic ratio?
"What percentage of network traffic do single-packet messages constitute,
and how does this percentage vary from Host to Host?
"What is the ratio of weekday use to weekend use?
"What percentage of line capacity is used during peak hours, and during
weekend?"

Note the oddly religious overtones from the capitalization of "host."
Processing of information was done by paper tapes; BBN had another Host
for dealing with the tapes, which was going to be used for analysis as
well.

Finally, here is the abstract to the paper:

"The ARPA Network allows dissimilar, geographically separated computers
(Hosts) to communicate with each other by connecting each Host into the
network through an Interface Message Processor (IMP); the IMPs themselves
form a subnetwork that can be thought of as a distributed computation
system. To detect failures in this system each IMP automatically and per-
iodically examines itself and its environment and reports the results to
the Network Control Center (NCC), at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., for
action. The NCC computer, like any other Host, can itself fail without
affecting network integrity; further, the NCC central processor can easily
be replaced, in case of failure, by any standard IMP.

"The present paper briefly describes the NCC hardware; discusses such
software issues as NCC-related routines in the IMPs, data-collection and
interpretation mechanisms, line status determination, IMP status and pro-
gram reloading, and Host and line throughput; details NCC operations (man-
ning, problem-handling procedures, track record); and summarizes overall
NCC experiences and future plans."

Thanks to Janet Abbate of the Center for the History of Electrical Engin-
eering; Alexander A. McKenzie; and BBN itself.

Note in relation to a timeline: the first four nodes connected in late
1969; the growth was slow at first, as the machines were tested. These
nodes were UCLA, UCSB, SRI, and UTAH.

Two final points - the NCC hardware used a central processor with only 12k
of 16bit memory! And this was at the core of the net at the time.

Second, and more important, according to Abbate's handwritten notes on the
xeroxed pages she supplied (for the Scenarios), the BBN Tenex had, in add-
ition to mail, games, etc., the commands who and talk (in one or another
form) - so there was real time chat in operation at a public demo in 1972.
This means that both synchronous and asynchronous user-to-user applica-
tions were being rapidly developed by then.

Speed


How fast everything changes! From the viewpoint of evolution, the medieval
period collapses upon our own, yet no one reading Jacobus de Voragine's
The Golden Legend could mistake one mindset for the other. There is no
bridge, no comprehension possible, across these plateaus; the gap is per-
manent. Time layers upon layers; moving across my life, as across a pla-
teau, I come across moments or habitus that remain without explanation; in
fact, I am lost among them, currying incidents only as examples, leverages
for present argument. Further, I am well aware that time past is only
construct for time present - that is to say, tags occur which create the
semblance of past environment, but this creation proceeds by means of
algorithms, reconstruction. One no longer thinks reconstruction-_of_ since
X may or may not have existed; assuming it _did,_ it has bequeathed only
name (address) and tags for future assemblage.

I would not know myself now, that is, as I once was, that is, five years
ago or less; I would recognize only similarities, equivalences even, but
no deep identity. I would _scan_; it's a scanning that skims laterally
across history, the Web, a life "my own," bringing to the surface only
incommensurabilities - and these, not from any depths, but from the rub-
bing of wounds that will not heal, stitches that fall out before their
time, suppurations. The leakage of the past always results in a surplus of
documents, part-objects, glances, and the political economy of historio-
graphy, _as-if,_ and _as-if_ the present were capable of recuperation.  We
do, literally, _anything,_ to absorb the other, construct it in our own
image (and perhaps lower on the scale which we also construct, as proof);
other-wise/ways, _it_ will not let us go. Staring at a saint in stone, a
shard of pottery or last year's novel, everything appears to come
together. We make the glue from inscription, desire, foreclosure. We make
a world we call our own, a world with a past. On the Web, the past seems
no longer necessary; the world's propped up by other means, not least of
which is the fast-forward heady rush of capital. But it is all the same:

But it is all the same, because it is all _precisely_ different, and we
are incapable of tolerating that. Men and women in fact are not siblings

hysteria, were that, for a second, to be universally acknowledged. (We

Pico-boo!


Written in dana:

It's like this, this and every other editing system, imposing the com-
plexity of memorization upon the format. Here, word-wrap seems useless;
all that happens is that the margin turns in upon itself, while the
images at the left-hand side of the screen do nothing for me but take
away the size and shape of the whole. The control-j of blessed pico,
allowing for quick and easy formatting is missing; dana does some min-
imal wrap, but I'm not sure where the decisions are made - they seem to
be somewhat nonsensical - as if the structure itself were reading from
a dictionary and deciding where and when the breaks should be placed.
But that's not the whole of it; emacs at least creates the phenomenolo-
gy of _sliced grids,_ in which everything is accessible, half drawing,
half image, while pico, similar to the edit in DOS, scrolls. Here is
what?

Is a picture or a window, is a frame. Emacs has the minimal, pico next
and of course one can simply write at an empty linux prompt. The less,
the better, as text defines its own space, sutures its world close to
the memory of wilderness. Everything is deconstructed, but lines in
dana are already subdued, in pico transformed into rhetoric, in emacs
deepened with always-present buffers and plateaus, with vi, a case of
construct. (But I'm ignorant of dana! Ignorant of emacs fine-points,
sliding back and forth among major and minor modes, or vi modes, or 
simply common usage...)

Think of _word-wrap,_ absent, say, in teachtext or DOS edit. It's word-
wrap that constructs the scroll, invisible breathing of the text; with-
out it, the materiality of the letters asserts itself - the line devel-
ops _length,_ disappears from the edge of the screen, or the beginning
disappears as the line takes cursor with it, continuing indefinitely.
Word-wrap is a function of geometry, nothing more; still, it references
the positioning of the body, the bandwidth of the screen and subtended
viewing angle.

Languaging in these editors possesses: graphemes within the symmetrical
substructure of the grid; the _stuff_ of the text, its materiality; the
_sound_ of the stuff; the _breathing_ of the sound; the apparent flood-
ing or _spew_ of the text; the text's _inscriptive tropology_ across
applications, nets, editors, etc.; its existence as binary coding; its
existence with specified hidden symbols such as <CR> or <LF>; its po-
tential performativity (program-text, script-text, html-body); its sem-
antic universe and semiosis (semantic function-construct); and all the
usual linguistic structures, deep/surface, etc. (not to mention the is-
sues of the full graphemic lexicon, the language lexicon and dialect,
its synchronic and diachronic relationships etc.).

Continuing, one should also bring information theory into play, not to
mention psychoanalytics, deconstruction, reception theory, issues of
gender, class structures, Chomsky's language (as a dialect with an ar-
my), and everything just _pours_ across screens, with or without tab
marks, rulers, gridlines, icons, menus, scrollbars, help commands...

I am an idiot.

Migraine


I type e zz, taking me into an editor with auto word wrap and not much
else. I type at the laptop. A migraine has started, flashes of electric
light on the right-hand side of my visual field; there are V-shaped
striations, and left-right arrows as well, gathered in an irregular
flight-formation pointing to the upper right of darkness. I type with my
eyes closed now, wondering if the field will change as the migraine
migrates into deeper areas of the brain, from vision to pain. In the
meantime, a slow fadeout occurs; the buzzing sensation is slightly
off-screen, internal screen, now, and the field turns to that maroon
darkness typical of everyday behavior. But skull feels placed in vice,
heavy, the neck holding up an irregular region of thick pain, not yet
all that strong; perhaps it won't get there. My eyes still closed, I
wonder how the headache starting to begin above the eyebrows will carry
itself; the fingers type, touching plastic as if there were isolated
pieces of the real down in front of me, nothing connects as finally the
striations begin to fade, there is a pulsing region not bad however in
the upper right, I promise myself I will correct this, slight increase
in sped in that region. So I find my way across the keys through the
indentation or nipple in the center of two of them, differently
positioned  on this laptop than on my Mac, so that hands need to adjust,
one to the other. I continue to type, feeling nothing. I wonder if
words emerge the same way, violent and hateful, beginning with visions
of death, leading to darker things. It's like rain on the plastic keys;
the real doesn't give, everything including the headless body, remains
roughly positioned, close enough for the exactitude of text. I've taken
aspirin immediately, anything to thwart the onslaught. I'm getting
tired. I note this, before signing off, only that there's not that
correlation between thought and the patterning; they're from different
regions, motivated differently, trajectories not crossing anywhere in
the neighborhood - otherwise, I wouldn't be able to hear the rain of the
keys, type as if there were a fluid descendent, think the migraine
away...

Later: Two corrections in the text, the headache continues, on and off; I
feel weak, slightly impaired eyesight, nauseous, filled with wool. I am
quite susceptible to these headaches, usually giving in totally; this is
one of the few times I pushed the envelope, insisted on working through.
The only insight was that there is relative disconnection between think-
ing and visuality in terms of migraine; working through the text trans-
ferred sensory input into synethesia of tapped rain, and the visual phen-
omena continued to dwindle.

These phenomena of course are transitory, leading to the headache proper,
which is somewhat upon me; there was a window of activity available, then,
as long as I didn't _see._ 

( And of course, how could I fail to remind myself of Robert Morris' blind
drawings, Morning Glory's blind texts, or anything that might swamp the
increasingly impoverished appearance of the world? As the headache in-
creases, I remain physically unclothed here, cloth stuffed throughout my
body, encasing brain and other organs; sight as returned, but:

It is _painful_ to see, just as the _stuff_ of the world is the carapace,
not herald, of pain. )

JULU-WORLD


begins through Corel World* with a template; beams are severed, textures
and planes, including a box, added; pictures are hung, spaced; the whole
is papered, cutting into acute angles in a deliberate tangle overhanging
an edge of the building; there you my find secret images. Sexless legs,
pubic hair, grace the outside; quadruple foetal-boy lies within the dark
and reddened chamber, mouth open for the visitor. The second upper sec-
tion of the building is separated from the lower; difficult, but possible
to move between the two, peering at the closed box with its reproduction
of those crotches. Here one huddles in a black sky against the blue-black
ground, ill-reversal. 

The beams are close to failure; everything hinges on the imaginary. From
flagstone, weightlessness, carrying that tangle; all over on the building
outside, those crotches illuminate closure (genitalia invisible, nothing,
no holes, guardians of the chamber).

The chamber has four holes below, two above, a confused puncture on the
wall with the tangle-burden. The latter seems excreted; images crash
against images, harboring that shattered interior where Jennifer hugs to
the outside, almost invisible. And there is nothing else in this world,
this landscape, but the floating-debris of the signifier's expulsion and
mouthed Julu-interior.

It's the interior of the carapace generating all those sticks which con-
stitute what it knows of the world; here, seed, it's hardly begun. Lacking
direction, the bulge-debris is the first stage of the establishment of the
vector. From the vector, the compromising hand might find a direction,
even sex and the confusion of wryting, inscription, text. But that would
be another world, not this, at

http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ab.wrl, and its surroundings.

---

*This is an _editing program,_ which simplifies VRML considerably. Unlike
HTML, VRML is labor-intensive, since every point is defined by three par-
ameters, i.e. x y z, for example. The _accountancy_ involved is enormous.
The VRML editor allows one to move with higher-level objects, of course,
constructing planes, boxes, cuts, etc. - the _surfaces_ which are produced
become the frames for images, sounds, animations, textures, etc. So that
the _surface_ places a phenomenological role as the _index,_ not _ikon,_
and that literally makes all the difference in the world. Of course, I
write this in 1997, and _things_ and their definitions / inscriptions are
changing rapidly.

Words Worth


I would love to lie with Julu, unfold
Her flap of skin from where it joins
This perineum, or Jennifer, unstitched
In that vast region between one nipple
And the other's vacancy and stare;
Still, somewhere bleak I recognize
These impulses as extra-current voices
Ceasing precisely at a certain temperature,
Beginning once again as world and room fall quiet
And my too comfortable bed holds all at once.
O Julu, I would cry, O Jennifer, and turning
Then from one unto the other, homeward-bound,
I'd once again be whole and hole identical,
The perfect rose within the perfect vase,
Or perfect home within a perfect vale.
But now, I wake, another scar appears
Across my bleak pleateaus of sheltered skins,
And it will take until my death reigns down
For such writing to complete, to cease - 
Then, and only then, will others come
And read my body, what I could not, across
The corpse of Alan, Julu, Jennifer.
I write myself for you, and you, I think;
I cannot read these letters that I write - 
They were not meant for me, what may contain
The vast appeal of great uncertain worlds,
Which I could be but vessel, channel, woman,
Of Julu, Jennifer, Alan, tribe of woman,
Not that a story would not have started forth
From half-dead lips, breath, pale exhalation;
The flap of skin, the surgery, is all
The fuel I have left, as well as memory
Of fuel, triad, scar, and conflagration.

Source and Fetish


Writing some of the people who have worked on the early Net, or have
written about the history, I feel closer to the source (to the Source).
But there is no source (Source), only a sense of my self-importance as
heros and heroines rub off on me for no reason (concatenation, contin-
gency, absence). I wasn't there. I ignored the signs. I had been hanging
around the MIT artificial intelligence lab, meeting Minsky and others.
They rubbed off as well.

Rub-off lights the fetish, shines the body, polishes the skin so it re-
flects the world (jump-start on mirror-stage affiliating) in the eyes of
its owner. Nothing more happens; the rest is literally dead meat. You
could draw and quarter it, "as far as its ideas are concerned." There
aren't any, only epidermal slough. 

At the apposite end, there's always fiddling. I own nothing to no one. I
download linux, substitute the latest kernel, reconfigure, smooth and pol-
ish (immolation of the _cubist fetish_). At least it's under my control. I
have the perfect operating system (smoothed, polished, reflective) until
the next X Window, gcc, or kernel release.

This last is a lie; I've loaded and stayed with my RedHat 3.03 system all
along. I don't want it to function self-reflexively; there are other uses. 
It reaches out into the world of the famous and powerful. Some of you are
on SGI. Some of you are on T1. (I have a hunger. I hunger for you.) (I
speak to you, become you. I stalk the dark corridors of sex, time, and
space.) (Continuing along the lines of _least resistance._) 

On another list, there is a discussion of intellectual power. I pointed
out and believe firmly that in North America at the least, intellectual
power can only be defined as affiliated power: recompense of the univer-
sity department or literary agent. Lacking affiliation, I play up to all
of you, want your gender, book contracts, conference monies, grants,
breasts and vagina. I can't identify myself as male; I am left blank for
others to fill in, although I am bound, legally inscribed. Some would say
this is a position of privilege. (Some would say this is an institution.)

I say it is a position of the fetish, polished and reflecting. I am going
in deeper, closer to the source. I believe that a light glimmers in the
darkness. I believe that I am on my way.

First Internet Guide:


The following is the first user's guide to the Internet, ever, dated Har-
vard 30-Apr-71 ; the indenting is changed, and underlining is given as
_x_. 

----------------------------------------------------




	PRELIMINARY USER'S GUIDE TO THE ARPA NETWORK


1   	_Overview_

The socket connection is viewed as a device and setting up a connection is
analogous to mounting a disk pack or, in the 10/50 system, to assigning a
logical name to a device. The user establishes a connection (via the UUO
given below) and performs normal I/O, including file manipulations (initi-
ally not implemented). The connection is permanent for the life of the
user's job (unless it is explicitely closed). The user interface to the
network is a pseudo-device labelled an "IMP". Each IMP is capable of a
transmit and/or a receive socket connection. The IMP has been constructed
to resemble as much as possible the device types on the PDP-10 timesharing
system. Thus existing programs can be expected to work over the network.

2 	_Implementation_

2A 	NCP Interface

2A1	The user interfaces with the NCP via a single UUO. The calling se-
	quence is:

	MOVE AC,[ (<FLAGS>B8) + <CODE> ,, E]
	CALLI AC,-5   OR CALL AC,[SIXBIT -IMPUUO-]
	  ERROR RETURN...	ERROR CODE PLACED IN E+1
 	OK RETURN...		FUNCTION COMPLETED

		...

	E:	SIXBIT /NAME/	;DEVICE LOGICAL NAME
		O		;RETURN ARGUMENTS
		<SOCKET>	;LOCAL (8 BIT) SOCKET NUMBER
		<STATE>,,<HOST> ;INITIAL STATE(BYTE SIZE,
				;   ETC.), REMOTE HOST
		<REMOTE SOCKET> ;REMOTE(32 BIT) SOCKET

2A2	Operation

Upon execution of the IMPUUO, the exec first identifies the requested
function and verifies that the user is privileged to use the facility. The
device identified in location E is then found and assigned by console to
the user. If the device cannot be found and the function is of the
connection type, then a free IMP is given to the user. If the specified
name is null or "IMP", then the physical name of the device (IMP1,  IMP2,
IMP3,  etc.) is written over it. Otherwise, the supplied name is given to
the IMP as a logical name.

The NCP(Network Control Program) is called to generate the proper control
messages and the current socket state (see section 2A5) is updated, as ap-
propriate. If the function is one of those that wait for a reply from the
remote host, the user's job is placed in I/O wait until that reply arrives
or a timeout occurs (timeout occurs) timeout not yet implemented). When
the operation has been completed, the skip return is taken. Whenever an
error is detected, the proper code is deposited in E+1 and the non-skip
return is taken.

2A3 Function Codes

The function codes are not yet fixed and are subject to immediate altera-
tion. The current set is:
0	Return the status of transmit socket in left half of E+1 and the
	receive socket in the right half of E+1. See 2A5 for an explana-
	tion of the state codes.
1	Start making the connection specified.
2	Start closing the connection specified.
3	Same as (1), but wait for completion.
4	Same as (2), but wait for completion.
5 	Listen for external requests for connection.
6 	Flush all requests.
7	Get the next external request.
8	Accept the latest request.
9	Reject the latest request.
10	Connect the user's teletype to the specified socket pair. Both	
	must be open.
11	Specify a translation code. (unimplemented)
12	Send an interrupt on link.
13	Trap to specified address on receipt of an interrupt on link. 
	Address is in E+!.
14	Return the version numbers of the IMP service and the NCP in the
	left and right halves of E+1, respectively.

64	Send a "RST"
65	Send an "ALL". Arguments in E+1 and E+5.
66	Send a "GVB".
67	Send a "RET".
68	Send an "ECO".
69	Send an "ERP".

2A4	Error Codes

	When the non-skip return is taken, an error code is deposited in
	E+1 as follows:

0	The function is not available (illegal or not implemented).
1	There is no such device (IMPn with n too big).
2	The device is not available.
3	The device is not an IMP.
4	The socket must be closed for this operation.
5	System error -- socket wouldn't open.
6	Socket must be open for this operation.
7	System error -- socket wouldn't close.
8	Socket must be listening for this operation.

2A5 Socket States
0	S.CLOS	Closed
1	S.LSTN	Socket is listening for incoming requests.
2	S.RFCN	An RFC has arrived on a listening socket
3	S.ABRT  A CLS was received for a socket in S.RFCN state.
			(aborted request)
4	S.RFCW 	A RFC was sent. An answer is expected.
5	S.OPEN	Open for data transfer.
6	S.CLSW	A CLS was sent. A reply is expected.
7	S.RFMW	Waiting for a RFNM before issuing a CLS.
8	S.CLRC	Awaiting a CLS for the logger
9	S.RMLW	Awaiting a RFNM for the logger.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
[This constitutes the first 3 pages. Punctuation has been preserved. The
fourth page is handwritten and contains a diagram, Module interaction for
a Telnet-logger Connection. The date on this is 12-May-71; both are from
Harvard. The diagram demonstrates the central role of the IMP, NCP, Data
Control, and Logger modules, as well as Server and User Processes.

Thanks to Peter H. Salus for the xerox. It's unclear whether the diagram
is part of the Guide. Salus states that Guide is "four pages long," but
the diagram is dated later, and is not necessary for access. The third
page ends half-way down. 

I recommend Salus' Casting the Net; he is also producing two larger vol-
umes on the early history of the Net, which will include various repro-
duced documents.

Badly-Written Text: What can we learn from the early history of the Net?


It's here that we can study the first usages of computer-mediated-communi-
cation, the domination of equally-spaced text, message bases, and an ab-
sence of excess/curlicues such as might be found in ordinary letters. In
other words, literally, what happens when the fullness of speech becomes
constricted - and what happened when this first occurred in CMC? (Note
that a _symmetrical substructure_ is always present as well, with the ex-
ception of vector graphics, at this stage.)

It's here also that we can examine the first appearance of virtuality,
virtual embodiment - the body taking its first steps onto the wires. When
was the first purely online relationship? How was it constituted? How and
when did online sexuality develop, beyond the obvious later newsgroups?
(How does this relate to early uses of the telephone? What sorts of lib-
idinal investment occur in either? Note that a call promises the imminent
presence of the voice/vocal body of the other, but email permits the
_caress,_ as text is saved.)

What did it mean at the time to log into another machine at a distance, to
have this sort of control? What did it feel like? What was the phenomen-
ology in the beginning? How was the horizon of the subject constituted?

In other words, one has to shed the current tacit prosthetics of CMC,
withdraw, begin again without familiarity (as if this were possible). Such
is a phenomenological wager, here within the deployment of historiography.
For it is a culture-in-the-making that we are concerned with, a culture
beyond the face-to-face epistemological structures of everyday life. There
had already been a series of stages - telephone, television, radio, phono-
graph, etc. - but CMC is different in its relative fullness: 

Even given party lines, telephones quickly became a matter of one-to-one. 
And television, radio, phonograph can be considered _delivery systems,_
control systems (in other words, similar to theater), rather than _lived
spaces._ For in spite of proscenium-space, the notion of an inhabited spa-
tial alterity did not really take hold until the Internet. (I am not con-
sidering the spaces of dreams, shamanic spaces, the Bardo plane, etc., al-
though all of these are relevant.)

And there's more: The enormous quantity of information that slid from ma-
chine to machine, slides today. The postmodern collapse of space and time
(or rather their fragmentation or deconstruction). The new political econ-
omy of the planet that may emerge as a result of _contact._ The realign-
ment of the socius as a result of a reweaving of personal and impersonal
relationships. The new networkings and potential empowerment that may em-
erge as a result of physically-dispersed populations suddenly finding
themselves as communicative-body. The interweaving of protocols into hu-
man affairs, the deepest concerns of the heart...

In short, a certain _voyage_ started in 1969, always with dispersed roots
elsewhere, back and forward. Shedding ourselves, we live the adventure
again.

(I couldn't resist this. I recognize how badly this is written, how little
history or historiography is considered relevant to the current state of
the Net, in spite of Salus and others. What we forget leads to a decay of
freedom here, a deep ignorance of roots of any sort. Thinking through the
early Net and its uses helps. We're not "living the adventure again," but
recuperating our own (textual/virtual/physical) bodies along the way.)

alan writes to derrida list in his first-ever email 4-5 years ago, a true
account:


when i come on, and begin to write, there is great fear. i will be writing
to derrida himself. there will be others laughing at me. perhaps they will
not allow derrida to see my writing. perhaps yes to have a good laugh at
my expense. but they are deep inside my skin where my writing is made
from. they are too sharp for me but now when i write my Postal they are
silent. they wait. they see the first mistake. they see the second mis-
take. they see more and more and they wait. they are so smart i am scared!
i want to write about the hymen-infiltration. i want to comment because of
my thought! they will catch me out. they will know what i know, that i'm
a fraud, that i'm dumb, ignorant, dumb. i'll be sure to be found out.

ii

i hit the control and x keys and i hear a silent wooooshh as the Postal is
sent to derrida. perhaps he will be kind. i will see. i will wait. now
this is what i'm doing, waiting.  now nothing comes, only the Postal re-
turned to me from derrida-l or l-derrida, that's all! i read my Postal! i
wait patiently for derrida's reply to me about my Postal on derrida-l or
l-derrida, and i'm so excited!

iii

i await you o great derrida of derrida-l l-derrida! i am so scared because
this is my first Postal! i imagine you see the image of plato on one side,
combined with saint socrates and van gogh shoes too, all pictures! there's
a beautiful full header frame! i'm so excited! 

iv

tooovooo later i'm no longer waiting! i've grown, he will not write to me,
i'm sure! maybe didn't read my Postal! i no longer write derrida-l or l-
derrida. i move on! i am no longer scared tooovooo to write, and when i
write Postal now to someone, where, i hear back. i am a valuable person to
them! i do know the transubstantiation of all linguistic categories! i
know nouns never reply beneath the proper power of the proper name, but
there is much excitement for me, and i am tooovooo! tooovooo be sure, i'm
no longer scared, and say more whenever and wherever i want! i'll be with
you, be you on net-l, l-net. i'll tooovooo be derrida 

tooovooo your derrida!

Deflationary Culture: Weather Report, Which Way the Wind Calms Down


{ For the past few years, I have served on an jury for the experimental
section of a film festival. This year, there were around 150 entries in
the category. The specific festival is irrelevant here; its demographics
are broad-based, and calls for entries are distributed by mail, brochure,
and the Net. The following is a somewhat biased, somewhat open, weather
report; errors in interpretation are totally my own. }

Jurying films creates a cultural image, for better or worse - a landscape,
and the landscape this year, built on those of previous years - is that of
a _deflationary regime_ - not postmodernity's _implosion of information,_
but a regime of exhaustion, in which collapse combines with expulsion or
DMZ (demilitarized zone). Implosion intensifies, the key to nuclear weap-
ons; deflation weakens (one might speak of _weak theory_ again), the pres-
sure reaching _degree zero,_ an entropic balance with the surround envir-
onment.

Cinematically, this is reflected in stereotypical reiterations of style,
ennui, boredom which doesn't kill, images of breeze-driven waves, oceans
beneath grey skies, a neutral, somewhat politically-correct sexuality,
confused boys, boys and girls concerned with _the look._ Script-urally,
look for the voice-overs, confessionals, flat voices which have nowhere to 
place emotional registers, no _site_ for them.

They're historyless, because history has overdetermined them. They're ahi-
storical, occupying the neutral zone as well. With Warhol it was the _oth-
er_ that was boring, within the factory, looking out; now, boredom has
been replaced by the inoculation of novelty; the planar (lateral) skimming
of the Web immediately comes to mind.

A deflationary regime levels epistemological domains, confuses ontologies; 
the _same,_ Irigarayan and _other_wise, dominates. The signifier turns
tentative; the signified is recuperated as a stain against a backdrop of
unnamed fetishization. Virtual/real, in/out - these terms, and others of
similar structural import - are not only deconstructed, but turned barren,
as if the distinction had never mattered at all. Acts of violence are mu-
ted; the wide-angle, precise-angle replaces the camera too intent to
probe. Texas-flat, midwestern-flat scenery suffuses content, which turns
back, not towards, say Michael Lesy's Wisconsin Death Trip family tragedy,
but towards the anecdotal, story-telling, autobiographical. Being-born
replaces the annunciation; bearing birth replaces enunciation.

Where we are in the culture is waiting for Terence McKenna _to be right,_
knowing exhaustion perhaps only goes so far - but then remembering, say,
Duvignaud's Change at Shebika, where exhaustion was all that went...

During day 2, the piano music was marked - slow, moody, in so many of the
films, somewhat romantic, slow or absent rhythms, the quiescent decay of
European/classical tradition. A shorter category included digital image
manipulation, often reminiscent of blue-screen effect, but harsher, fast-
er. Female nudes, very little frontal, no frontal male nudes. People a-
sleep, _arrayed_ beneath sheets, of course lent back into the dream. More
non-sync voice-overs - a result to a great extent of increasing difficul-
ties obtaining funding. Foliage, or aestheticized cityscapes. Meadows
without direction or vector, wandering. Figures in black. Very few rela-
tionship or overtly queer works. A largely young white demographics, but
with new work from Asian-Americans. Flowers, opera, exhausted magic. 

As if our culture were no longer doomed, as if there were "our" culture,
say Corso, Burroughs, but was past all memorization. As if there were few
others, cultures, multi-cultures, multiculturalisms, those tentative with-
in this our Euro-American topography. What to do when the advertiser comes
carrying no promises, but occupying the landscape with improper media
noise (and that landscape of impropriety in collusion). Every body has a
shell, that is to say ectoplasm migrated from the mouth to desire's image
as coating or masquerade. Little energy, as if to speak were fear, or
rather to speak were theory, but theory has gone to sleep as well. It's as
if everyone dreams everything. Capital _fits_ less than in past years,
that is it's no longer clear that everything is beneath the Sign. As for
signifiers, now of the plateau itself - the plateau signs itself, languor,
lassitude, loosened. A certain loss of saying _I_ in these environments
designed for the precision of _eyes,_ occasionally undercut by female pain
or rage - _there_ at least the voice crosses space, defining it, id, loud
or pleading, as if no one remains within hearing. Surely there is work to
do if a cultural fulcrum were evident - the symptoms are all present, lend
themselves to the Web, zines and anti-media, media, fractally spiraling
everywhere. But what to do, what to do, fretting. Pacing where the bed's
unmade, the breeze flows through the window open to the meadow, white cur-
tains stilled in a landscape perfect for cinematic recuperation. There are
numerous drones, almost metallic, on numerous sound-tracks, and they muf-
fle, sometimes suffocate, almost by accident, perhaps by accident, some
voices of _telling_ display. (Perhaps by accident, perhaps by accidental
purpose, perhaps a purpose.)

The fulcrum, lever, requires a structured topography and a subject of
means. Playgrounds were not in evidence, but a seesaw metaphor might hold
in these withholdings. It is a question of what can be done on the planet,
within certain domains where the signifier has spilled, leaked, dried up -
where the signs are, even the simulacra, and where the crust has broken
through. Weakly theoretical in the undoing, deflationary culture spreads
globally, absorbing inscription itself in its path. There's nothing to
fear but the closing of film labs, increasing hunger of the empire of the
digital; soon hunger becomes consumed by bytes, and both human and other
uneasily coexist within the threat of extinction's future anterior.
