bows), bowed afghan miniature rabab (4), found the violin with

inverting amplitudes foregrounds body and operational instrument 
sounds; these are the last of the pieces which treat bodywork as 
fundamental to music, the body presencing; the usual focus of an 
instrument, proper sounds, almost a shell or manifold across 
flesh and breath. i haven't made work like this before, interior 
and exterior exchanged in an incredible sonic mapping tending 
towards possibilities (at least for me) of new modes of sound 
and musical philosophy.! i'm including viola and shakuhachi urls

http://www.alansondheim.org/qq.mp3

perhaps the most successful of the inverted dynamics pieces;
qqq is the final result, qq is the original. i recorded this
last night, couldn't sleep, six in the morning, took a lot of
sleeping pills and trazodone, checked the tuning of the 1980s
qin, played what might be my best piece in any case. so this 
is the body and qin, the 'scratchy' sound is actually audible 
in both version, part and parcel of the music and its making.
i've been thinking (admittedly ignorantly) of the relationship
between category theory and 'older' mathematical foundations,
in relation to sound modifications like echo, filters, on one
hand, and revrev/inverted dynamics on the other; the latter
brings otherings into the foreground (temporality and body for
example), while the former remains within the traditional
embeddings of the subject (player, listener). ...

Interference

http://www.alansondheim.org/interference2.jpg

abstract -

given the triad gamespace/edgespace <--> blank <--> imaginary, 
interference appears in the interregnum of edgespace(imaginary) 
as a _production_ or (conceivably non-reproducible) commodity of 
interference: virtual static (with its possible panoply of 
objects and part objects) appears as _corralled content_ which 
may be considered the alterity of the gamespace, and may also be 
represented within it. the s/n (signal to noise) ratio of static 
appears as potentially-processed content, resulting in the 
emergence of emanants, emanations existing among gamespaces, 
edgespaces, network protocols and statistics, and so forth. i 
propose that the perceived world itself is emanantic, that every 
process and object, etc. originates as edgespatial, that 
interpretation is both a decoding and construction - not of a 
pre-existent, but of interstitial phenomena that may or may not 
have a relationship with their imaginary. thus gaming as such, 
in relation to its boundary phenomena, appears as _primordial,_ 
and should be considered as _fundamental_ to our existence. in 
this sense, what is our body, but signings and interference, and 
what is our mind, but an imaginary operating under fluid and 
mobile constraints (which, in other eras, we might have termed 
deity?

(aside) from what -

interference implies strictures and parasite; think of michel 
serres' the parasite, an interruption between source and 
receiver channels, but also potentially the source of new 
content. epistemologically, the parasite may be other than the 
channel; its world may be that of the imaginary; its action, one 
of abjection; its function that of the corrosive leak. does 
this lead us astray or complement gamespace/edgespace analysis? 
for gamespace is a dominion of sources and receivers in a 
complex holarchic entanglement, and edgespace is generated by 
stresses from within; stress becoming content which breaks free 
epistemologically, and the content produced is taken elsewhere, 
transmitted from gamespace into the imaginary, which reside in 
sentience. (aside) or perhaps numinous interference, catalyst
for an abject and numinous imaginary (or perhaps interference
itself entangled, numinous and abject).

inverted dynamics foregrounds background/body sounds, parasite 
and interference, abject re/constitution of sonic production; 
azure sings thru her sickness, pauses filled by screams 'out in' 
the street below; her voice loses sonority, breaks down into 
gravel/grating coughs and gaspings, she makes it thru the song, 
the someone screaming has moved on, sounds of traffic, body; the 
song is marriage to language, language broken by sickness; we 
remember the catastrophic and fragile peak of goodness in the 
midst of what might go wrong, returned and foregrounded here as 
parasitic content. enjoy, despair, enjoy.

was. i keep pushing these categorical filters that imply
something about sounds, culture, body, music, physics, 
and their entanglements, about edgespaces which blankness
roars in with imaginary content as symptomatic prions, 
for example, worlding asserting itself in the midst of
cultural structures. our internal biome is roughly half
microbial dna, and this is a picture of that elsewhere in
music. in the extreme cold of rhode island in the last
day and night, i could hear the strings loosening, the 
wood of the instruments straining. we now use three

Some Recent Fragments on Music

inverting amplitudes foregrounds body and operational instrument
sounds; these are the last of the pieces which treat bodywork as
fundamental to music, the body presencing; the usual focus of an
instrument, proper sounds, almost a shell or manifold across
flesh and breath. i haven't made work like this before, interior
and exterior exchanged in an incredible sonic mapping tending
towards possibilities (at least for me) of new modes of sound
and musical philosophy.
