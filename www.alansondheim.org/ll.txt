

further on my work -


my work is not about avatars; it is not about jennifer, julu, nikuko. my
work is not about sex or sexual objects. my writing floats through beings
and sexualities, floats through different worlds with different physics,
different neurophysiologies. my work is about the interrelationships among
the symbols employed to comprehend, elucidate, live within, the world -
and the consciousness which receives, transmits, and is constituted to
some degree by such symbols. my work exists between the symbolic and the
imaginary/fantasmic/uncanny - on one hand, protocols, etiquette, and pro-
priety - and on the other, those very openings occasioned by avatars, sex-
ualities, issues of dreamed bodies and bodies dreaming, trance-states,
virtual subjectivities, electronic existences.

(the work is not pornography, titillation, stories, parables; it is not a
narrative of avatars or epistolary novel; neither of course is it what i
say it is, or is not.)

i am writing this in response to someone's kind backchannel response con-
cerning my last textual posting - that it is difficult to pin down what
these texts are, from what occasions they emerge, towards what horizons
they move, however haltingly.

consciousness moves, trembling, against great forces and happenstance; the
asteroid, cancer, death, takes it all out. we exist and write/create with-
in the meantime, meanwhile. and within this interstice, we inhabit phenom-
enologies as if there were futures, eternities, truths. i write towards
and against these futures, eternities, truths; i write as if there were no
tomorrow, or as if we were always already inhabiting tomorrow as fantasm.

i want to move towards and across, beyond the other, as if the other were
a lure or possibility. i want to write into the void, where texts and
images fall into space emptied of everything, including purity. and I want
to see what happens in these non-domains; what types of perception and
consciousnesses are possible; what the limits of the human, the animal,
the organism, are; what may be said about the future of philosophy and the
philosophy of the future - the textual body and the body of text - the
state of the chiasm and partial objects, interpenetrations; what can be
created when language is reconstituted, transformed, beneath the signi-
fiers of technology, sexuality, capital, and so forth. i want to move into
spaces that dis/comfort or exhilarate me, spaces that keep the sense of
wonder alive, spaces that - at least for me - are new, and always beyond
what i am able to accomplish. i want to see vistas, be vistas, see ...

towards these ends i write daily into areas that both carry my signature
and abandon it. i want to abandon, as much as possible, the foreclosure of
ideological theorizing or a tendency towards the specificity of style or
genre; what i want to do, i can't possibly accomplish, i keep writing ...

Short Bursts of Electronic Records


Record 1, I'm going to keep my hands off you. I'm not going to ask your
name, or anything. Don't worry, I'm not going near you. I want nothing
whatsoever from you. There are several prepositions locating the two of us
(i.e. in relation to each other) but I not (don't?) think of the two of us
in any grouping whatsoever.

Record 2, I won't get near you. I won't touch you. I want nothing to do
with you whatsoever. I'll stay away from you. No prepositions will bring
us together. You remain at a distance of indifference. That is all I can
do.

Record 3, Let d = infinity. Then 1*n = n; 0*n = 0; d*n =d. 0 and d, at two
ends of the spectrum, are absorbers. Then 1, a form of spectral visita-
tion, returns the same to the same, after the operation. Therefore I am 1
to you; 1*you is you, and this operation, this silent caress, remains
invisible.

Record 1, whatsoever. All of this must be understood whatsoever (this
doubling of the word indicating a break or disconnection between records).

Record 2, There is of course the question of addition, of general recur-
sive functions, but all that is unnecessary (i.e. an afterthought). I
won't go near you, even this speaking, this caress, is at a distance, and
I remain spectral, spectral.

Record 1, You never know when I arrive, but you may mark the date of my
departure. Or you may never be sure I will not return. I have left the
sky different. (Broken, almost forced into the machine. Do they know he or
she has left. Who are they? Who is she? Who is he? Forced out of the mach-
ine, recorded.)

Record 2, But I will never get near you. You'll never see or hear me. I'll
keep my hands off you. I'll keep far away from you. I won't look in your
direction. I won't hear anything you say or see anything you do. I'll stay
away from you. But I will never get near you (etc.).

the root glom

glom, glom onto, approaching, there's an enveloping, not quite, almost a
withdrawal, closer to a fluid state, heady contact, there may be vacuum
around here somewhere, clamp or clump, viscosity and bulging, indo-euro-
pean gel-, gelatin, congeal, glue or clamp, something of a lump of stuff,
dreams separate gloming, well that's taken care of, what moves on is an
identity, there's nothing untoward, it's toward, it's what i'm thinking -
of - gloom perhaps, mud of day, conglomerate of capital - clammy - some-
thing of the uncanny

Speed Text Swallowing


Two articles in two days: One on Net relationships, one on my personal
online history. I do not know what else I could write on "at this rate of
speed" - what else has happened to me in such a way that all that exists
is a _recounting._ To write at speed is to have the narrative present and
under control, all in advance - to have apperceived the issues, entiti-
ties, processes, and structures - to have the investment and cathecting
ready-at-hand for the retelling. Of course the retelling, like any other,
is a process of reconstituting - one might better say a process of consti-
tution, since the original is always already lost. This is not a case of
the record or records; the records can supply, at best, an armature or
con/ figuration. Instead, think of a high-speed gloss either emerging from
the records, or submerging the records. Think as well of the category of
the glib, the well-rounded phrase or anecdote, the emphasis placed just so
within the fabric of a tale. It is like that when recounting, even with
different styles, demographics, resources, introductions: We are tailor-
made for each other. I mean to edify as well as entertain, to entertain as
well as edify. How else can one conceivably learn?

I shall bear silent witness. That means I shall not speak, I shall not be
able to speak. It also means: I shall not comprehend; I shall find these
events, these people, incomprehensible. 

Nevertheless, I shall remember, and I shall continue to remember. This
means, I shall build my memory out of mortar and bricks, I shall make my
memory out of human labor. This also means: I shall remember until all is
lost, until I am no longer. This also means: There is nothing to give you
but incomprehension.

ghosts


if there were ghosts, they'd be hammering at our doors, all hours of the
day and night. at least half the ghosts would have reasons to seek us out,
beg us for a moment's contact, set things right again. signs of contact
would be everywhere, and the world would be in the throes of constant mur-
muring. it would not be so perfect on the other side as to lead to aband-
onment.

that atmosphere itself would be filled with shimmers for all to see. oh
mother you would answer my tears. sickness would be accompanied by slight
touches, the slightest, so welcoming and comforting. you would know you
would live long after. there would be but the slightest of smiles behind
every frown.

those who were ill-disposed towards others would be visited by wrathful
ghosts. we should not be so ill-disposed. they would interfere with us in
all our daily lives. exhortations would come from all sides. our bewild-
erment would be at the bequest of others. we would turn to ghosts. we
would be so careful because there would always be ghosts around. ghosts
could not hid, there would be so many. we would turn towards kindly
ghosts.

we would see those ghosts. we would hear those ghosts. ghosts of men and
women, ghosts of plants and animals and children, ghosts of bacteria and
of all the kingdoms of organisms on this and every other place in our
universe. we would see and hear and touch and smell those ghosts of all
creatures and all worlds; we would sense their heat and our minds would
welcome them and fear them.

think of the ghosts of half-formed seas, ghosts of algal mats, ill-formed
ghosts, ghosts of our ancestors generation upon generation. think of our
imminent ghosts, ghosts of our mothers and fathers, friends and siblings,
murmuring, leaving traces, populating the air, waves of ghosts, hordes of
ghosts. think of ghosts interpenetrating ghosts, the flowing of ghosts
through walls and doors, ceilings and floors; we would turn kindly towards
kindly ghosts, and fearful towards wrathful ghosts, and who among us would
know the consequences of all our actions and thoughts in these our lives?

if there were ghosts, they would be calling for us, and all of us would
respond, would yearn for that freedom from daily care, worries, sickness,
and deaths, that haunt us so.

Night, Online in Kyoto


Shadows struggle against the dark and stormy weather. I gouge their out-
lines; I forgive them their fury. But I do not speak and I am not respon-
sible. I learn from the book "All About Shadows" that I must be wary, need
not be caring, need only read what I want to read - that the world is
better left alone, that my very life is an interference. I learn that I am
permanently broken, that bones don't suture, that flesh only heals and
reheals itself, that scars cover scars. When you say "keep together, swal-
low dirt, eat each other," I need go no farther than the soaking walls and
falling plaster. I learn this body is bound. I learn about writing through
my book "All About Binding." I learn I do not have to respond to you. I
learn I can close myself off, huddle in this leaking room, severed from
the direct blast of the weather, that your online cries are avoidable,
that I cannot save the world, that there is no longer any world to be
saved. I read in my book "All About Naming" that I need not name, that I
can live as if drowned in raging weather. 

But I do not speak and I am not responsible. I learn from the book "All
About Shadows" that I must be wary, need not be caring, need only read
what I want to read - that the world is better left alone, that my very
life is an interference!

JennjuluMachine


Welcome to Jennjulu IV Version 2.0!  We have added even more features to
the world's best-selling grammar and style checker.  We know you will find
it's more powerful and easy to use than ever.  This tour shows you the
Jennjulu interface and the essentials of interactive grammar and style
checking.  Whatever the task might be, both the occasional writer and the
seasoned terrific strange person coming here with dark visage and equally
dark cloak professional achieves immediate results with Jennjulu's soph-
isticated editing environment.
 
Interactive checking is the most effective, creative, and enjoyable way 
to combine grammar and style checking with your writing process. Jennjulu
works with you sentence by sentence to correct errors and enhance your
writing style.  Since the strange and dark visage people programs natural-
ly assume you have spelled each hungering and dark-cloaked person whose
words are spelled as words correctly, we suggest you use our improved
spelling dictionary.  Jennjulu can then analyze the sentence, assigning
parts of speech and looking for grammar, usage, and other errors.  She
stooped over, carefully picking her way across the fields of dark red-
black flowers, collecting helpful statistics along the way on elements
such as passive voice and sentence length.

Unless you write newspaper or advertising copy, it is best to avoid one-
sentence paragraphs, and you fall in love with her, and her slim fingers,
and you are reminded of them by a patient Jennjulu until you do this auto-
matically, in addition finding sentences so long they are hard to follow.
As with this woman and her flowers beneath a starless night, such are the
clouds that darken the horizon, so shall these flowers last until their
errors, blood-red-black and thorns, black-grey-black, have disappeared...

Correcting long sentences is often just a matter of separating two sub-
jects, or editing out unnecessary modifiers.  Some writing problems are
more difficult to correct, though.  How often have you asked yourself if
you should use "he" or "him," or "we" or "us?"  We may think only other
people make these mistakes, but both you and I can overlook simple errors.  
She said to me, this was later, after we had gone the long ride together,
It's that we think as we write. I knew this referenced the signifier...  
If the thought changes in mid-sentence, the two parts don't always match
up. Sometimes, while struggling with her to explain an idea, you think of
the right words, but put them where they don't belong.

You may have considered writing a piece about her preventative medicine -
there was much to say. Her lips were the color of rubies, her eyes black
as well, her mien invisible. Was this a ghost or human before me? I
shuddered to find out... Did you know the preferred form is "prevented
from doing anything in this and any other world. Her form before me pre-
vented me from the great movements of the earth wheeling around..." You
will if you use Jennjulu.  In quoting, can you remember if the question
mark goes inside or outside the quotation mark?  You will if you use
Jennjulu.

Whom will be there before us, whom after us...She would not judge you by
the quality of your writing, like some stereotypical English teacher. Our
software isn't your finger-wagging dark woman, but your well-meaning
teacher, handing back papers dripping with red ink.  Jennjulu is your al-
ly, helping you to choose the right diction level and sentence structure
for the many kinds of writing you do.  Since few of us want to imitate
Proust and spend our days in a cork-lined room, we desire her, knowing she
may kill us; such as feminist theory leads us to, the origin of murder
which is predominantly male. But when she spoke, it was as if the world
came to an end, to help you write more easily, with fewer drafts.  Ice ran
in her veins, and you'll have more time to think about your document's
content if you let Jennjulu help you edit. Its form shuddered repeatedly
in the nighttime sky; have I already described the effect of her ice-cold
arms around me?

The average woman with a word processor, invisible nighttime screen, did I
already describe the nighttime sky, knows she can turn out fateful let-
ters faster than a typewriter, but why stop there? Don't die wounded a-
round in a sea of words when you can have Jennjulu. Given the chance, Hem-
ingway, or the dark woman herself would have done the same--and considered
the few dollars well spent, as his manhood was spent on the drear heath.
He felt his shirt, wet with blood; his eyes were blinded by the obscene
vision he had seen. She would be with him no more, alas!, he was on his
own.

In the market or on the heath, detail and accuracy count for more than you
might think they're really known to. He would carry her visage with him
for the rest of his days...  So finally, in this and every other world,
Jennjulu can shatter such histories and documents to find tiny mistakes
that force you to rethink your life, just when you're ready to leave for
the weekend.  Isn't the number and variety of errors Jennjulu finds uncan-
ny...  Use the writing aid of the 2000s, and be at the forefront of lang-
uage technology with Jennjulu!

1 So sad a teacher without pupils, all this knowledge, no one to share 
it with, he will be sad and crying until the end of his days, all these
trees will be lost, the air emptied of no one listening, ragged twigs
groping the sky, silent burial in hallowed ground

2 I am not Schopenhauer. I am Nijinski. I am the one who dies when he is
not loved. Nijinski's diary. I am not Nijinski, ballet's ragged twig.

3 It will make me sad to die. For most of the world I am not alive. For
the rest, many will think me dead.

4 I am not crazy. I am not Nijinski or Schopenhauer. I have no pupils and
I will wake up and wonder, do I have anything to teach today.

Subject: Errors...

in visible disturbance in the field of the text


re: Parables of Izanami - 'tought' for 'thought' - 'even even' for 'even'
- 'by by' for 'by' - some spelling:

After reading and rereading the text repeatedly, these errors nonetheless
forthcoming. Thus it is in all my work - not for lack of trying. I use
ispell for spell-check, reread the text several times. Language slips out
from under me, in the form of a disturbance. Errors are simply _not seen,_
creating confusion for the reader on two levels:

First, is a particular error intentional? For my work tends towards extre-
mity of style, and the language may have been placed just so.

Second, is it a sign of carelessness, sloppiness, impotency? For it may
appear as if the text, always carefully constructed, had just been tossed
out.

It comes down, in other words, to the _jectivity_ (introjection and pro-
jection) of the writer's intention. If intended, then the first possibili-
ty, and the error is to be read as deliberate content. If not intended,
then the second, as if the text had breezily escaped me.

There is however a third possibility, that the skein of errors across the
texts references another, more contradictory, level - one that is at (lit-
eral) pains to subvert the text from within. Like postmodernism, this lev-
el is not a level at all, but a pervasive seeding of the writing. I can't
go so far as to speak of a _reading_ of this seeding - only to not(e)  
that it is not necessarily the speaking of the unconscious, so much as a
disturbance of the textual field through a form of invisibility - the
field fulfilling itself or surplus in spite of the author.

On a practical level, all of this makes it difficult for a copy-editor
when a text is reproduced; on a theoretical level, I end up attending to
these errors, as if they possessed a secret which would finally release
the writing to the wo(r)ld.

The Shipping and Handling Club


Perhaps The Shipping and Handling Club should have offered nothing at all
... I was thinking of the imaginary... as if there were an illusion of
packaging equivalent to the signifier... superstructural 'stuff' tied di-
rectly into capital... Pay ONLY shipping and handling, nothing will ar-
rive, we're selling nothing, there's no exchange - the value is always
already surplus... It was more serious than it appeared at first glance -
an exchange, so to _speak,_ of diacritical marks... As if it's here that
the Gift comes into play - use value literally through exchange value -
Somehow I knew I had hit on something...I took the easy way out...I
offered to send empty packaging...already the shell was a completion of a
duty...I don't want to get into this...it was capital, cleverness, that
drove me in another direction...I should never had taken it...should have
opted for the difficult route...an extreme case, she said...it should have
remained that way...one might say a case of the extremities...construction
of meaning through illusion - which is all there is or would have been 'in
the first place' - it's a failure of mine, this desire to create a real
"crowd-pleaser" - there was something about the idea, almost like a riff -
it might have worked, perhaps it did work - it should have been pushed to
the limit - like language, I'm repeating myself - offering nothing at all

I am impossible, self-strangling. There is a torrent inside me. I am
constantly at war. My selves self-immolate. My selves do not exist.
My selves ask, How can this be. But what can answer. For others, they
see only a one. For me, there are deaths always. That is what I truly
mean. But "I" am what is at war. The "I" laughs because it is always
someone else. In Japanese it is similar to "construction." That is, 
the shape of it. Or somebody working. I am always working on me. It
is impossible to live with me. Who will live with what. There are so
many answers in this evening rain. Who is the "construction" of the
rain. I do not know, nobody knows. There are torrents inside me. They
beat against my certain skin. It is bigger than the big heart pulse
of kindness I pretend to show to everyone. But it is invisible be-
cause of the I. Because there is so much construction around they
are hidden, who they are. Because of construction inside me, I am
sorry for anyone knowing me or who is living with me, because it is
so difficult, the rain has so many names (i.e. depending where it
falls).

* The program gives up. With all the noise at its disposal, the universe
could not come up with a single host name. It is so easy to name a host,
and the whole universe, with its primordial chaotic domains just could not
name one. Not a single host name, no matter what the universe threw at the
program. But we humans cut through the primordial chaotic domains and can
name a host anytime we want. Because we humans have brains that can access
all sorts of information - for example, a host name or address. So we do
not have to guess and guess but can cut through, suddenly changing the
state of the program from one thing to another. That is how our thinking
works; while the universe throws things randomly and without even hoping
for a response (it cannot hope), we just enter the true information and
find ourselves in charge, which is a very different thing.

Qasida of Qiwami


When all at last could render and infer, Jennifer would last and call her
men, Then atmospheric mesmer near her menhir, Ornament meant her wall
before her fall, Then Jennifer went her Qasida:

You will be nothing but a name. The hard pebble of your name. Your flesh
will disappear. Not even a Qasida of your name. Only your name will re-
main. There will be nothing but this name. This name will be all there is.
There will be no sign of the signified. There will only be this sequence
of letters. It will not be beside the torn flesh or broken bones. It will
not be beside the dust of the jeweled skull. It will be nowhere around the
sceptre. It will have nothing to do with the glinting sword. It will not
be connected in any way to the curved jewels. It will have no relation to
the conch shell trumpet or the dorje. It will not be of pure flame or the
vajra. It will not exist or reference a stupa or glittering city of marble
towers. The name which remains will be connected to no one. No thing will
resonate with the appearance of the name. There will be no shakti or sutra
but only this name. This name will be buried under mountains and boulders
but this name will be buried beneath seas and rivers. But only this name,
but not even a Qasida of the name.

Commentary


"A wealthy man may become destitute one day.
Wealth doesn't last; if it were permanent, 
All the universe couldn't store our treasures.
Paupers' virtues can make them wealthy; 
Absolute poverty is impossible for long,
For no beggar can live on nothing at all.

"So you see, every situation in the world
Is impermanent, a composite phenomena.
Do not expect anything to endure forever;
Clutching appearances as real is true bondage."

(From The Tale of the Incomparable Prince, Tshe Ring Dbang Rgyal,
translated by Beth Newman.)

If wealth did last, it would not be wealth.
The universe would suffocate beneath its weight.
A single being would be lost within its grave,
Fettered by coffers, unable to move, counting
Once again all treasures in the world.

If poverty did last, it would not be poverty.
The universe would fly away with souls.
A single being would dissolve in total absence,
Unable to speak, to take a single step, freeing
Sound from sense, babbling poverty in the world.

Between speech and non-speech there are phenomena,
Within phenomena, economies vie with one another.
In order to escape repetition and samsara,
It is enough to give and to take;
Everything passing through, nothing stable,
Everything in motion, stillness of Bodhisattva.

The Telling Quote


"Sexualities, issues of dreamed bodies and bodies dreaming, trance-states,
philosophies of the future - the textual body and the body of text - the
scanned body - mired, abject - dirty filthy body - down _there_ - the
whole falling plaster. I learn this body is bound. I learn about writing
through at it di dah bi bi bi dah bah. It looks like a bodily organ bah of
dessicated bodies. A huge, maw, opened, arched, empty beneath, of dessic-
ated bodies, the shape of it. Or somebody working. I am always working on
me. It rain. I do not know, nobody knows. There are torrents inside me.
They nuance my body; I said it was hard to explain - as if surgery were
of no interest in explaining myself. The Bodhisattva helps - that is a
space to remember. I assemble this quote. I attribute it to Jennifer-Julu.
I say HELO body. I say RCPT. I say MESG. I say DATA," says Jennifer-Julu.

Every loss loosens the vault of heavens; every illness screams my name
into voids. Bodhisattva, help me. Nikuko, destroy me, liberate me, starve
me until my clothes fall into chasms, my skin floats free in unspeakable
skies.  Hello old friend, said Nikuko in the Julu run-time program. It's
been a long time. I don't sleep too well at night; I'm always troubled by
dreams. The worlds I have created - they haunt me. Samsara and repetition
bedevil my creations. I hurry on to another. I never stay, never write a
book until the end. Um ma am um!

blinded. I walk through the summer gardens of Peter the Great. I must
speak very precisely, capturing the auburn and russet hues of the trees,
set against alabaster and marble, blank and blinded eyes following no one
in my path. my greatcoat leaves a trail of broken bark and seeds; it is a
fine autumn afternoon, slight promise of flurries in the air. one can
never fully believe these russian skies. blinded. eddies and scattered
leaves, a glance and then .. a troubled mien .. an encounter. nearby, a
stroller, pushed by a woman in long skirts. sounds of horse in the
distance .. a muffled cry, the smile of a beautiful woman .. stony por-
traits silhouetted in whitened forms against the first few flakes .. one
notices a slight mist rising from the carp pond .. the railings of
L. Charlemagne, his tea house .. the sculptures of Attention, Suffering, 
Laughter, and Irony, and then all of the Rossi and Neva Avenues .. her
name comes to my lips .. a blind woman, speaking to me, just an hour
before .. our passionate embrace .. now, once again, the scattering of
leaves and flakes in the midst of this grandeur. in the distance, Push-
in and Tchaikovsky. white nights .. the October blizzard. what has left 
me this. footsteps approach ..

Sometimes the moon got in front of the sun to see what was going on. It
was neat because the earth was in shadow and a lot cooler and it was
easier to look around. But sometimes the sun got in front of the moon and
then it was a big mess, everything was hot and people could do stuff and
the moon wouldn't know. They'd fight just about every day over that and
you'd never know who was going to win. 

But now, I say, it's a miracle, I just enter these few numbers on this
machine and I can call up anyone in the world, and tell them about
things. They can find out and tell the moon if they want. I can even look
up the moon and I sure know it's looking at me. It's like that all around
the whole world and there doesn't have to be any fighting any more because
we can tell them what's going on.

jennifer


"what amazes me," said jennifer, "is the depth of human worlds. we sur-
round ourselves with objects whose histories intertwine with our own. our
friends and relations know pieces of us, but only pieces. and they have no
idea of how we inhabit the earth, and how we are inhabited." jennifer
paused, looking out the second-floor window at the autumn maples in the
university quadrangle. "it's so beautiful here," she said. "like hawking,
i am privileged to live a life in which i have nothing to do but think,
and i am supported in this." she paused again. "look at the wall," she
began. that's a daumier newspaper print next to a 17th-century map. and my
father was a cartographer and a curmudgeon; we both loved daumier. the
daumier came from my recent trip to france; the map is from italy, given
to me by a former lover, a professor of comparative literature, shall we
say, deconstruction. an italian. but no one would guess any of this - or
for that matter, the relationship between my father and the professor. i
will let it go at that." she leaned forward. "you see, what i am getting
at, we all have these ... depths ... about us. we can't even begin to
comprehend our own histories, much less those of others. and when we die,
when any one of us dies, whole worlds are lost, gone forever." she looked
at me strangely. "i believe that these worlds have more complexity than
the sun, more history than the moon. i believe that they are not only
lost, but shattered." jennifer stopped for a moment, allowing her words to
sink in. we could hear the light breeze outside the window, the calls of
the boatswain in the distance, rugby scrimmage farther still. "i don't
know what to make of any of this," she said. "i come up against a barrier
of sorts, the inertness of death, the inconceivable depth of personal
history. and when i think about the shattering, i grieve that i have no
faith, that my own world is endless and oppressive." the ticking of the
clock, as if signaled from somewhere unknown, joined in the other
sounds. it was late afternoon, and shadows were already growing jagged,
yet the undergraduates kept up their raucous play.

Hun Tun


"Three hundred and fifty leagues further west ins a mountain called Mount
Sky. It has a great amount of gold and jade, and green male-yellow. The
River Brave rises here and then flows southwest to empty into Hotwater
Valley. There is a god here who looks like a yellow sack. He is scarlet
like cinnabar fire. He has six feet and four wings. He is Muddle Thick. He
has no face and no eyes. He knows how to sing and dance. He is in truth
the great god Long River." The Classic of Mountains and Seas, tr. Anne
Birrell. In the Notes on Chinese Names And Terms, she writes: "Muddle
Thick (Hun Tun): A god representing chaos, located on Mount sky in the
west. His attributes are a shapeless body, coloured yellow with scarlet
markings, and with double wings, and the feet of a reptile. Though
faceless and eyeless, this deity is the origin of song and dance. He is
also known as the great god Long River (an unfamiliar title). The most
famous myth of this god is not given here, but it appears in a parallel
text of the fourth century BC which emphasizes the god's formlessness,
and especially his lack of bodily orifices. His name appears in various
compounds and with variant graphs to denote the state of shapelessness 
and confusion, especially the primordial state before the creation of 
the universe."

The chaotic god clumsily tilting throughout the world, backwards and
forwards simultaneously, mouthlessly singing, the confused presence of
language thick within him. Why assume that song, dance, literature,
connote even the vaguest of freedoms? One can imagine the rumbling of
music, internal rhythms and the sloshing of bloods - wayward, contrary,
unable to take orders, moving everywhichaway, hardly an idea of progress
or restraint. Sound and sight, speaking and hearing, are irruptions from
within; the outer world for humans is rumination, blather, deflection. Hun
Tun has no time and space for any of this; he's busy in his catatonia -
one might think of worldrhythms by proxy, and his own immunity to'em. What
he produces doesn't go anywhere; there's no facing him. Language ceases
any relation to utterance, instance, instantiation. Hun Tun understands
the universe! He's right there, with the language of't.

Windows CE

has the feeling of touching a body; the stylus presses, things shudder on
the screen. I haven't had this reaction with any other operating system.
It's rubbered - spongy - things fade out oddly, come up, disappear some- 
times leaving the shadow of a square behind. The speed is relatively slow 
- I'm talking about the older 2.11 even though it's running on a 100 Mhx+
system in ROM - but somehow it sets its own pace as an organism. More than
any other system, it seems to be alive, to react to being touched.

So that one's aware, more than ever before, of the _body_ of the computer,
the skin of the screen, the caress of the stylus or deeper honing of the
cursor with arrow  keys. Soon the reaction will no longer follow the old
gigo (garbage in / garbage out) rule; instead, the machine will respond
thoughtfully, taking into account the user, circumstances, environment -
and then, not too much farther down the road, its own desires -

And its desires expressed as a kind of sponginess, the delicacy of mem-
brane and tissue, the suppleness of flesh ...

i work hard at my texts. they are a form of labor. i do not get paid
hourly but as Adrian Piper suggested years ago, that would be one way to
calculate the value of an artwork. of course my work is more or less
foisted on you through the medium of email lists and the Net in general;
it is not something you asked for. still, and it is presumptuous of me, i
believe these texts have something of value to anyone who will take the
time to read them. now, aesthetic value cannot be measured in dollars and
cents (or other units), but it may be measured in terms of labor. and even
when texts appear "fun" (an english word deadly and almost impossible to
translate), there is an air of urgency, intensity, and resonance about
them that, at least for me, would not come about without careful consider-
eration taking a fair amount of time. perhaps if you find pleasure in
them, you should pay me in relation to what percentage of an appreciative
audience you may represent; i would say a dime per work, calculated a pos-
teriori by the quantity of texts you may have saved (i.e. not deleted) for
later reading or savoring. oh! this is so difficult, the artist's way in
our cold world, surviving with very little money, always in hunger, always
haunted, waiting for the next handout - while giving the world the very
best that he or she has to offer, the remnants of the soul itself, the
last thought produced in incredible and confused clarity, the very essence
of Being and beings.
