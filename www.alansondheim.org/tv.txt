A 1987 Sony Watchman tuned to the cosmos, signal processed. 
Analog tuning, either UHF or VHF band and bandwidth. It's easy 
to breathe the air of the cosmos, skein of cosmic networking, 
mirrored by fungi down here where we live and die. It's easy not 
to die, become forever space and time dependent on universal 
destiny of our universe. I name our universe among multiverses 
Our Neighborhood = ON, and within 6000 languages here and 
billions elsewhere, the translation of ON or ON within a 
parenthetical, the performative of nomenclature, {}ON{} to be 
dissipated and interpreted or discard as unfit or fit. I pray 
and {s}pray particles and configurations that this might be the 
case. I {s}pray that this might be the case.

Birthberth Our Neighborhood, continue the Young Explorers


http://www.alansondheim.org/birthberth17.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/birthberth18.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/birthberth19.png

The first raindrops that fall in a storm are called Young 
Explorers.

But where does the storm begin and end? ask the Young Explorers.

And has it been before, is it reborn anew, is it ab nihilo from 
primordial chaos, from nothing, from virtual vacuums? continue 
the Young Explorers.

And who is to say what is first, if the mountain is higher than 
the valley, if the valley is lower than the mountain, if the 
plain is wider than the sea, if the sea is bounded by the plain? 
continue the Young Explorers.

And who has been here before us, what other drops might exist in 
other plains, on other mountains, on other seas, and how would 
we know or not know? ask the Young Explorers.

And who might be after after us or long after us, and would they 
be the first, and would they think of themselves as the first of 
the Young Explorers? continue the Young Explorers.

The first raindrops that fall in a storm are called Young 
Explorers.

license of calatysis and cheers.

The cat recuperates this within ON, our neighborhood, and the 
immediacy, imminence, of our habitus, our lived environment.

This feline recuperation is exemplary of Freud's uncanny, slips 
of consciousness, deja vu, slippage of consciousness, and the 
knowledge (of the ontology and epistemology) of _otherwise._

On Universal Attributes {UA}

http://www.alansondheim.org/nord2.jpg  

ON = our neighborhood universe, by projection, on top of, on the 
bottom of, our universe.

NON = not our universe; therefore either 

N = nowhere if no multiverse or

NON = elsewhere, within one or more universe in a populated 
multiverse

ANON = elsewhere, within a designated but unknown universe in a 
populated multiverse, ANON as in "a not our neighborhood 
universe"

V{ANON,ON} = the set of characteristics of all multiverse 
universes including our own, which may be written V{(AN,1)ON} 
which neatly simultaneously emphasizes our home base ("1") as 
well as V, "all" and note that

V and ANON are slippages which may be restrained by relays 
within AN

This is at best a game which depends on the useless 
clarification of language: nothing lost, and nothing gained. It 
is a sloppy game: N = "not" but also "neighborhood" and A = 
"all" but also resonates with the poetics of anonymity which 
excludes ON, but recuperates it, to the extent that our universe 
- "The Local" - itself is perhaps minimally accessible and 
infinitely unaccessible. Rather than continuums (Peirce or 
other) we might refer to _percolations_ of accessibilities and 
inaccessibilities. In the meantime, there is _no way whatsoever_ 
to grasp the immensity (ON) and immensities (ANON) at stake, 
except by virtue of a poetics of extrapolation and 
inaccessibility, as if the granularity of percolation were 
fundamentally irreducible. We are swallowed whole by these 
considerations, and the languaging, which may appear to possess 
sense of one or another form, turns out to be nothing more than 
a _cipher_ that is discernible only by name (ANON, etc.), and 
not at all, whatsoever, by content or reference. All of this 
might be rewritten

^ = {[0-9, A-Z]} =

in some regular expression, the bracketed terms replaceable by 
anything whatsoever, and the equivalence or substitution in the 
third position, emptied of all content.

Whom Are Julu Twine

http://www.alansondheim.org/whom1.png

Julu Twine transformed from my encounter, inhabiting Julu Twine. 
S/he, my 2nd avatar, had extensive alpha transparencies; now 
when I returned as hir, I found hir with a new outfit and body, 
which I didn't create or use or even see before. It's unnerving; 
what sort of intercession has this been, between one session and 
the next? What has been done to hir? And what, if anything, does 
this say about race in America? Black Lives Matter in virtual 
worlds as well; I'm torn between promulgation on my part, and 
violation on someone else's, perhaps myself? Did I violate 
myself? Did I somehow inherit this body, this outfit, as a gift 
or grief from another participant in Second Life? Did I accept 
this? Did I assume these contents as confluent with my own 
avatar, Julu Twine? Does Julu Twine run me? Do I run Julu Twine? 
Am I deeply forgetful here? Is that possible? Perhaps I accepted 
the transformation gladly, transformed hir myself? The image/ 
imaginary is uncanny, does not respond to my animations 
(technically, it locks them out, unless they're attached to 
object scripts). I don't know who did this; was it myself, was 
it meant as a prank, deep gift, was I aware of what I am not 
aware of, now?

But it is in fact, a package, the first in a choose an avatar 
panel, a commercial construct; I can only conclude, that when 
the Second Life browser updated, it removed the attributes I 
assigned to Julu Twine (including attachments, illuminations, 
activations, texture mappings, transparencies, scripts, and 
alphas, all my creations) in favor of a packaged imaginary of 
race and sexuality, which becomes even more problematic. On the 
other hand, I have no proof that the updating, read Linden Labs, 
did this; it might well have been an intruder. At least I 
realize now, it hasn't been my own depressive conscience at work 
- when anomaly appears in the world, look towards capital as at 
least one of the underlying causes.

graphs of NOH - Julu Twine in a brand new outfit discernibly 
awkward in relation to the old. S/he is in our Neighborhood, 
Not Our Hood, Not Only here, Noh were. Everything in fashion is 
garnered by repetition, interstitial assignations, Barthes' 
semiotics detailing the foundations of the body. Of course, 
beyond fashion, the body has no foundations, only interiority; 
here July Twine has only exteriority, coding and protocols all 
the way down. There is only here here. Here here curls like a 
crazed Riemannian manifold greeting itself in the repetition of 
capital. There is nothing to enjoy in these images, which are 
available to everyone for hundreds of dollars, individually, or

water sloughed from shores of pond or quiet pools, darkening 
Nikuko across Ohori-Koen, bridged the pond on the stone-bridge, 
form saguaro and pond growth; life begins its long cycling into 
still-born mist rising from the carp pond .. the railings of 
shallows following the pond that wasn't there now or then or was 
it her inferiors - the thicket will rise up, the pond become a 
great flood, and at midnight, and the sound of wood stork 
winging, - the drowning pool of thought - the rusting pond of 
mindful thinking - among a spacious and distant wilderness - ice 
and heat - odd phenomena - winds moving inconceivably slowly, 
here and across the pond, lower, and lower still, O! storm a 
river, lying at her feet, a lake, a stream, a rivulet, a 
trickle, a pond, a sea, an ocean - all these soundings - and of 
Jennifer - she says - a pond an ocean, an ocean an unpleasant 
one, and nothing sounds in water but of Jennifer! says Jennifer 
says I! n a lake a pond a ocean. a ocean a storm a river. they 
lie at her feet n a lake a pond an ocean. when you among a 
stream a storm a river. they lie at her feet n a lake a pond an 
a pond a ocean. a ocean a unpleasant one. nothing sounds in 
water but her feet in a stream a storm a river. they lie at her 
feet n a lake a pond storm a river. they lie at her feet n a 
lake a pond an ocean. when you - in infamy - in bondage - when 
you dwell within the calm and full - the strutting universe of 
me already calm and still and full

and full silence falls silence, and blossoms thrive, and fall



the redolent cellular automata and fractal debris

http://www.alansondheim.org/automata1.jpg

these older programs are running in dosbox in linux mint; i 
wrote them originally in qbasic. some of them are fractal, some 
are cellular automata, some entangled i was exploring everything 
from wolfram's take on automata in a new kind of science, to 
pattern recognition. the programs run great in dosbox, but it 
stops screen-grabs; the images and video are from an external 
camera. the frack video and image is oddly redolent of a 
swastika, which unnerved me, and led to the processed images.

the programs are relatively simple and lead to complex results. 
they operate on an x,y plane, although i also worked with 3d 
models of the same. i'm fascinated by the traces things leave in 
the world, the relationship of traces to evanescent and fragile. 
the estimates of the number of life-forms on the planet have 
increased almost beyond belief, the largest perhaps at four 
trillion. better to think of dynamic and overriding processes, 
absorbing and restructuring everything constantly, speciation as 
the establishing of temporary plateaus with fuzzy boundaries and 
terrain. all of this is a mystery and fantasy on my part; every- 
thing i think is farthest from the truth.

miasmatic growth in lovecraftian woods, scurryings everywhere
beneath the surface, wintered desolation, poverty, ecstatic

badly wants the truth of romanticism, already gone as the world
curls inward, almost touch itself and those around us

On the Diffusion of the Blank and Blankness


http://www.alansondheim.org/cl1.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/cl2.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/heli.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/cl3.jpg

This is the closeness of your other 
 
writing this revelation: that blankness is among gamespace, 
edgepace, the ledge, the abject, the archival impulse, the 
elsewhere, the elsewhen, that it is neither slate nor fluid, 
that in other words 'there is no there there' or the speaking 
voice, or a language, phonemes, marks, traces, gloss. arms 
gather space within and without, space surrounds arms, 
organisms, space ruptures and breaks, the mythology of the 
blank might do here in its (space and blank and rupture) 
disappearance.

This is the distance of your new Clar 
 
the blank screen is anywhere, beyond or as relay elsewhere than 
the surface fabrication of detail. the screen always designates 
an edgespace which is within and without, giving us, always, a 
sense of unease; think of it as shimmer or stutter, the 
entangled conjuring of the abject or tawdry -

and so a sense or senselessness of abandonment, as if there were 
an other/wise beyond/ one/'s habitus. abandonment is a falling 
out, falling forward, the l/edge of the building, the descent 
where nothing occurs. the blank, ab nihilo, corruption of 
gamespace, production of edgespace, yes, all the way down.

is not pessimism absolute? again a relay or detraction occurs as 
if momentary. the blank screen on the wall remains, succumbs, 
proffers itself. we are there for it, among it. one must write 
in plurality to occur. one begs for the past, because it 
encapsulates, carapace, hovers, b{l}anked capital, lodged, at 
one point articulated: i don't remember, but i recall this about 
it nonetheless. the blank is always our past, coming toward us, 
always our future, leaving us behind.

so that internally, as heated organisms, one might speak of the 
_inferno of gamespace_ and the _blink of an I_ and from there, 
onto the ledge.

i want to add something about pessimism and truth, but pessimism 
or optimism or other states are neither farther nor closer from 
that diacritical mark (which seems a safe habitus, but as we 
know from mathematics, it is not) - truth has nothing to do with 
it; the blank is a blank slate that absorbs inscription and its 
denouement, ignores inscription and the archival impulse; 
perhaps an evanescent model would be neutrino entanglements or 
virtual particles, and what might be called a _non-memory of 
non_ in the mood or mod of the subjunctive, in a mood.

one returns for the allotment 

the shame lies in this, that we behave and believe otherwise, 
which is also the shame and the hope, the closed shameful eyes 
wide open, the debris roiling, coagulating, into the semblance 
of (momentary) orga(ni)sm, that the organic is always an as-if, 
and that blankness has no more presence than the virtual, the 
blankness of the blank for example, a regression meaning nothing 
but collapse.

so the return to the immensity of differentiation of the real 
and its obdurate. so that given the organ or human project/ion - 
nothing remains but the ion, already unstable, faltering; it's 
this pretense, circumlocuted and circumambulated by the curtain 
of death of consciousness, that permits us to occur, be, in the 
first place, always the misrecognition of the real.

or the parabolic whose boundary itself is fuzzy, roiled, 
coagulated, virtual, dividing the uneasy plane without the 
benefit of finite closure, as if the gamespace edgespace 
elsewhere elsewhen blank were something to be _swallowed_ and 
here the swallowtail catastrophe comes to mind -

{ adding: that it is always a fear that such poesis is taken as 
a poetics of the world, a more or less scattered or useless 
description, instead of: the deep harboring of poesis as an 
accurate response to a blank which inheres, adheres, within and 
without our presencing, circumscription (if to circumscribe were 
_parabolic_ without the steadied and finite circumferance). }
