"I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you. What do
I mean? That I want to be free of this Net, that I want to release all the
words and articles and images and video and web pages I've written or
collaborated in, that I want to release them forever onto the wires, that
I want to do other things, let them slowly disappear, I went from 2110 to
2080 sites on google.com (under "Alan Sondheim" not under the Myouka or
Jen stuff, see how I boast, sickeningly, even now, half-collapsed); I want
to let the words become part of the bone and marrow of the Net, my name
effaced, everything gone. I want this freedom desperately; yet I am bound
by furious clamps on my brain; I can't escape; I can't get away; I type
and type into the night; it's my compulsion; it's my obsession, my
addiction. I want to let the words float like seeds, like sails, like
wings, like birds, like albatross, do they ever land on land, do they fly
forever? I want to fly, I want to die, knowing the words are burrowed deep
in magazines; this is the century only proceeding the next. Listen to me; 
I'm talking from the dead; I'm already dead."

"Don't you know the third millennium's already half over, the fourth is 
breathing down our throats? Listen to me, I'm speaking from the past - 
please help me; I'm speaking from the past."

"I want to see the fourth millennium, the third's tiring, the second al-
ready gone and dead, dead, dead; I want to see the fifth; I'll write and
write, preserve my words for thousands of years; if you read this in the
future, recite them, let others hear them: these are the words of a dead
man still yearning to be free. Please bring me! Please bring me back! I 
want to see you! I want to see your face!"

Your point should be inscribed at this point?  I consider the following
again, your ... Would give you a graphological mechanism? Incision paints
me beneath your point! How would you define your freedom?

My wings, like birds, like albatross, do they ever land on land, do they
fly, do you understand my language...

I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you. What I do
calls forth streamed imperative, hungered, making things. Beneath the
falls, I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you.
What do I is mountains, ... imperative is mean? That I want to be free of
this Net, that I want to release all on black stone, it's imperative. 
Please try and understand this. I can't help it that my words are getting 
lost. I'm sitting here, crying; my mouth is filled with nonsense. Please 
try and understand this; I'm sitting here crying.

Are you satisfied with wanting to be free. This is the most basic truth I
can write you. What do I? Wait! I want to be free. This is the most basic
truth I can write you. What do I and 29990 are written down and you don't 
understand me and I want you to so understand. Please please try. I don't 
have time left, I'm already dead, I need you, I need you.

For 4 days, we have been streams and written and it has taken you 0.167
minutes to write your last -

I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you. What do I
forever? I want to die, return, the known words are burrowed deep, words
and articles and images and video and web pages I've written - Write
wings, streams, like birds, like albatross, do they ever land on land, do
they fly through my freedom. This is the most basic truth I can write you.
What do I want! God help me! Bring me back to life!

but really, don't you feel we're clumsy? we're all clumsy, struggling
around, crawling in the muck. we need a century, another century, another
millennium. I'm appalled at our ignorance, all of ours -

and these forms of communication are hopeless, limited bandwidth - the
best flash moves clumsier than the worse movie; we're still working things
out, we may never get there, it may be centuries, five years -

this is the worst time to be alive, just the stuttered beginnings of
things, we'll never see fruition, and no, I don't think it's always been
this way -

just look at the net, at these machines! they're slow, painful, complex,
they can't speak, can't see, can't hear!

WE NEED TIME!

=====

We fill in their gaps, but it would be incredible, if we didn't have to -
and that will come, after us most likely - we won't know - just like
theories of universe - they've got the genome, but not the cosmos - it
feels like we're on the brink of something - that will come after us -

it's odd with Azure - she's 33 years younger than me - people take us as
father and daughter, it's understandable but disturbing - but we do well
together - for me there's always this thing, though - that she'll live
probably more than 40 years past me - she'll see things, like my daughter
will see things - that I can hardly imagine -

nothing's been solved, I was looking at live crayfish in a tank today,
watching and understanding their territorializations and thinking, we're
all so primitive, we can hardly speak -

=====

none of it is bad of course, but it's frustrating; I'm greedy, I think a
lot of us are, I want it all: I want to know how things will emerge, and
then how they will emerge after that, and after that...

and with Azure, to be sure, it's a thing that is always there, that my
death will almost definitely precede her by decades; for me this is an odd
emotional and inconsolable state, a broken future; I think to myself,
always, _I won't know, I won't know_ ...

I have to say who could understand me or help a long time ago. There have
been the people who have helped me when I had to get in a bad way ahead of
time, and I can look for help from my doctor or friends. Relate one way
because sometimes it's really funny, and that helps a lot. I never thought
of it this way, it's machinery that brings you voices that help you and
console you. ******* she's screaming and no one can hear or can help her
******* But then there's no interest in explaining myself - she almost
comes alive through health; oh Nikuko, help me escape with the liberation
of all beings into voids. Bodhisattva, help me. Nikuko, destroy me. Bodhi-
sattva, liberate me. Nikuko, starve me. Please help me; I'm speaking from
the past. This is a different text. This is a help function in the program
of Nikuko-life. Please try and understand this. I can't help it that my
words are getting muddled, that I repeat myself. When I look out, it's
******* through a cloudy visor. ******* Nikuko, drown me. Bodhisattva, 
save me. ******* she's right in the next room and no one can see her in 
such terrible pain ******* Nikuko, burn me. Bodhisattva, comfort me. 
******* she's being nailed to the floor or a wall or a ceiling i am almost 
certain ******* ******* such terrible pain ******* I have to say someone a 
long time ago could understand me. It's the machinery in me that's of a 
speech or a talk, machinery that's of a word or a phrase, machinery that's 
of a noun or a verb, machinery that's of a prayer or a sigh. ******* no 
need to hurry i'm almost sure of the silence in the next room one over and 
one down ******* Nikuko, stab me; Bodhisattva, cure me. ******* liberate 
all beings and for all times ******* ******* such terrible pain *******

i wanted to write about killing a man but i was afraid for my life. my
life cautioned me, do not write about this thing; they will come and get
you. i wanted to think this thing, but my thoughts were overwhelming. i
did hope for this thing, but i would censure my thoughts, even in the
guise or case of the good cause, even in the alleviation of oppression and
misery. i would write about such a thing and hide behind my writing; too
often i have faced authority and too often censure has been my lot in
life. but this is something otherwise; this is a case of theft and aban-
donment, banishment and extinction; these are all cases and i would write
this as a last writing in the search for justice. i wanted to.

Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                           Jan/Feb 01


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:  
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the work; readers
may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing may appear
fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole. On my
end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists, partial or
transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction. 

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 4500 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and Nikuko, in parti-
cular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, sex,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, prehistory, etc., as well as to the
domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions, relative to philosophical concerns. I continue working on a cdrom
of the last seven years of my work (Archive); I also have additional
video materials, created with Azure Carter and Foofwa d'Imobilite, on two
cdroms, Baal and Parables. Most recently, I've been working on a text for 
publication in a month or two, ".echo" - as well as "cancer.txt" which 
deals with loss, mourning, and death. And I've finished articles on Stel- 
arc and Panamarenko. I want to write once again on radio and radiations.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, Cu-
SeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act and
engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out of
performative language soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound, 
and flash pieces.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

It may be difficult to enter the texts for the first time. The Case of the
Real is a sustained work and possible introduction. It is also helpful to
read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (lq, lr)
as well. Skip around. The Index works only for the earlier files; you can
look up topics and then do a search on the file listed.

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

Current cdroms are available for $14; if you've have an earlier version,
they go for $10. Baal and Parables are ach $15 (video format is .mov with
Sorenson compression). (Costs include shipping.)

You can find my collaborative projects at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual 
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community.

Rapture


Chapter One

A big storm and a bus flips and 35 are injured. A train swooshes down the
track and kills a man. Another bus flips over. A plane slides all over the
runway. Cars slide into things. People stay in cars and planes. People are
taken from buses. The man is removed from the track and the train swooshes
on. There are three people in my life. One of them walks ahead of me; one
of them walks behind. Sometimes they take different forms. Sometimes they
walk in other directions. The one behind me carries the past and the one
ahead carries the future. When I am inside they wait at the bus-stop below
to go somewhere else; I imagine they do this on shifts. The mother of
James Ellroy was murdered when he was a child and his work is obsessively
built out of that event. Most of us have no defining moments at all and
become jealous at the possibility. Birth and death are insufficient; we
wander endlessly looking for narratives. Without plots, things fall apart
from what little glue we had in the first place. Our culture is one of
hunting and gathering, and the writing of narratives held tense and trem-
bling in books, on walls, in brains. Nothing ever prepared us for this.

night after night i burn in this place.
i sit at the keyboard and try to tear the world apart.
i look for wounds and spread them.
thinned cuts turn into holes, i can't stop myself.
on and on, i'm thinking to myself, there is no tomorrow.
i was supposed to die at twenty-five; i tried earlier.
my flesh chars at the edges of the wound.
it curls outward grasping at any oxygen.
completion is delusion in the midst of obsessive chain.
write me out of this existence; i can't.

Stew and Fruit


Who are you, you touch the blue you stew and stew you do accrue and wonder
vocals all the way through the forty minutes? A melange or stew, the lies,
the thefts, she's in a stew - her takeoff and approach. The stewards knew
she was arriving. The pilot's bulk is bent under the burden of its fruits
of thick juice tasting legs.

I wanted to write you and say sweetness falls from _this_ fruit with the
time of ripening. So there are stews freed from the unknown, never coming
to fruition.

Text: Pallas told him not to harm the fruitful lands. Boredom - the fruit
of the mind's inert, incurious tree. I do this so well (i.e. modify prev-
ious work in relation to specific searches and reassemble them into new
and more meaningful texts of wonder and surprise; so that one might use a
command such as "grep -h *?? fruit >> y" over the entire internet text in
order to create an initial assemblage; "-h" suppresses file names; "*??"  
makes sure that files are searched only if they are 2 or more letters; the
spill is appended to file "y"; if "y" were, say, "xyz," there is the poss-
ibility for a feedback loop creating an exponentially-growing and useless
file; doing this i managed to run up 38 megabytes in a few seconds; what a
mess; i might have brought the server down; it was a real stew and hardly
fruitful; i wonder if this were a flaw built into grep or the particular
flavor of unix i was using).

The Laying-Out (infinite abacus)


Consider an abacus with infinitely long columns; this is similar to a num-
ber system with base infinity. (See below for finite approaches.) Now to
add, simply move the requisite number of beads X to the already-calculated
Y; you have X + Y. To subtract, do the reverse. To multiply, three columns
are used. The first column is infinitely deep; the second is set to zero;
the third to Y. Set X on the first; move one bead on the second; set a
second X on the first; move a second bead on the second, and do this until
the second and third columns are equivalent.

One might also use two measure-strings and two columns. Set one measure- 
string to X, the second to Y; one column measure out to X, the second set 
at 1; measure a second X on the first column, add another 1 on the second 
and repeat until the second column is the length of the Y measure-string.

One could use as well just one measure-string and a marker on the side of
column Y; when the beads reach the marker, the calculation is finished.

Division is a reversal of this process; set X and set Y on a measure- 
string; subtract the measure-string from X; add one to the second empty 
column; repeat until no more subtractings are possible; the length of the 
beads in the second column represents the integral quotient; what remains 
in the first is the remainder.

The measure-strings in both instances are placed next to the requisite 
beads on the first and second columns.

What is unique in this system is that there is no necessity whatsoever to 
name the numbers of beads, i.e. assign them to particular integral values. 
Instead, one has greater or lesser numbers of beads in the first column; 
after the operation, the rough length of the beads is the result. In this 
manner, a king may count his horses, a queen her subjects, without further 
need of specific tallying. When the column gets especially low, judge as 
"more or less"; that is all that is necessary.

This is to some extent the mathematics of the heap or pile, a mathematics 
with an inner exactitude, but a fuzzy reading of both givens and results.

Of course one can also consider an abacus with one bead per column and an 
infinite number of columns. In this manner, addition and subtraction are 
again to the base infinity, simply the moving up and down of beads at the 
leading edge of the quantity. But if one is insistent on multiplication, a 
second tally is necessary, and if one is insistent on division, one must 
look for the same.

Moreover, it is unnecessary to specify an infinite length or number of
beads or positions. An inaccessibly high finite number will do - or even a
finite number practically greater than any conceivable calculations might
warrant. Of course such a number could be arbitrarily extended or retract-
ed by convention or convenience. In any case, problems of platonism or in-
finity are bypassed in this fashion; the systems are both functional and 
phenomenologically interesting.

I'm fascinated by these simple systems of primitive measurings and tabula-

the measurings of kingdoms without largesse and the origins of bureaucra- 
cies. For nothing more is needed than the laying-out of rows upon the 
ground, exalting at the beads disappearing in the distance, and worrying 
when the line becomes shorter, almost starved and measurable.

Plain and Heap


No longer the line, the geometry, only the gatherings of beads, tokens, 
markers, units, only the rubble of accountancy:

At the level of the plain, the abacus behaves differently. Consider an in-
finite (or inaccessibly high finite etc.) flat surface of beads; it be-
comes necessary to isolate portions among them, for example a 1-portion
and a 2-portion, in order to carry out any operations.

The portions have to be specified by closed, i.e. Jordan, curves which do
not cross themselves. For addition and subtraction, either channels must
be opened between the portions (in order to join or separate them), or an
operation may be carried out, such that removing 1 bead from a 2-portion
is accompanied by adding 1 bead to a 1-portion:

2-portion - 1 => 1-portion + 1

until 2-portion is empty, i.e. 2-portion = 0 (in which case the 2-portion 
may no longer exist).

Subtraction is in the opposite direction, but in order to subtract a spec- 
ified amount note that we dispense with channels, so that

2-portion - 1 => 1-portion - 1,

with the bead from 1 portion returning to the undifferentiated plain, and 
this continues until 2-portion = 0 (or becomes non-existent).

Note that a method is necessary to keep 1-portion and 2-portion separate 
and labeled.

Multiplication and division also work by repeated additions and subtrac-
tions, using a 3-portion, if not 4-portion and 5-portion for tallying -
see heaps, below.

And how are portions diminished or incremented in the midst of a solid sea 
of beads? Moats must be constructed, portions piled in grounds cleared of 
any interferences.

So that from the plain, one gathers beads into heaps. The heaps are separ-
ated by blanked space, the ground-state; this state G = 0. G is always
existent; it is a territorialization, a boundary, a marker by virtue of
lack of demarcation. If G = 0 it is 0 anywhere, everywhere that G is.  
Think of it as the Basin in Bon religion, or Kristevan chora. Nothing is 
ever placed within G; G surrounds heaps. New heaps may be created, but G 
is not among them, within them. In this sense, G is not a natural number, 
but a numberless state, not even an emptying of number. In this sense as 
well, the integers move from 1 upwards; negative integers might be indi- 
cated by heaps labeled as negative, but in fact all heaps are of the form:

HN = | N | where N > 0.

To add: combine heaps. To subtract: Either remove any number of beads from 
one heap and place them in a second heap or:

Begin with H1 = X and H2 = Y. To reach X - Y:

Subtract a bead from both; place these beads in a third heap H3; carry 
this operation out until H2 is empty. When H2 is empty, H2 = 0 = G, the 
undifferentiated state, H2 no longer existent. But see below, labeling.

This depends of course on Y < or = X.

To multiply X * Y. Create H3 and H4. Move H1 bead by bead to H3; each
time, add one bead to H4. When H1 = 0 (i.e. non-existent), subtract one
bead from H2 and place it in H5. Then move H3 bead by bead to H1 (which
must be created anew - H3 and H1 oscillating in this fashion); each time,
add one bead to H4. When H3 = 0 (i.e. non-existent), subtract another bead
from H2 and place it in H5. We then have

H1 = X
H3 = 0 (i.e. non-existent)
H2 = Y - 2
H4 = X * 2

continue until

H2 = 0 (i.e. non-existent) at which point H4 = X * Y.

In order to divide, a similar process is used, tracking beads removed from 
H1 in quantities of H2, until H2 > H1 (as divided), in which case what 
remains in H1 is the remainder.

We have numbers to no base or perhaps to base infinity or to base 1. At 
the level of the heap, infinity cycles back to 1; at the level of the 
heap, there is no positionality. With the infinite or inaccessibly high 
finite column abacus, an infinite base might be theoretically employed, 
each integer individuated; with the infinite or inaccessibly high finite 
row abacus, a base of 1 might be theoretically employed, each integer an 
extension.

Throughout all of this, the heaps must be labeled (just as the portions
had to be labeled); think of a interior beads in label quantities o oo ooo
oooo ooooo surrounding an emptied center, with rays connecting the center
through the label quantities to the heaps beyond. If there are no heaps
beyond certain label quantities, those spaces are reserved for the crea-
tion of heaps, i.e. as in the oscillation of H1 and H3 above, which is 
based on the constant recreation of heaps in order to carry out multiplic- 
ation and division.

Naturally the ground must be kept clear of any rolling beads, false beads, 
embezzlement beads, stolen beads, extra beads, and masqueraded bead-like 
objects. And naturally the ground must be level to avoid such rolling 
beads as well as emptied, flat, in order to create maximum conditions of 
visibility. One might think of Bentham's Panopticon as described by Fou- 
cault in this regard - while beads remain undifferentiated, except by 
virtue of belonging as a member of a set (heap), they must nonetheless 
leave a trail or trace; nothing must remain unaccounted or unaccounted-for 
and nothing must be unaccountable.


=====


Infinitely Small


What happens when the size S of beads grows infinitely (or inaccessibly
low finite) small?

Of course one does not consider the size of abacus beads. But, given the 
heap, one might want to...

With the abacus of infinitely high (or deep) columns, or the abacus of
infinitely wide rows, measurement becomes an issue. Thus to add length X 
and length Y, measure X + Y, move beads. To subtract X from Y, measure X 
and within X from the far end, remove beads.

To divide, repeatedly subtract X from Y until X < Y which is the remain- 
der. But without quantity, who knows how many subtractions? Keep track of 
subtractions with finite beads! (Note the need for a second measurement, 
second instrumentation.)
 
However, to multiply is impossible; without scale, without beads, there is 
no way of telling how many beads are necessary. This is fascinating - in 
this instance it's easier to divide than multiply!

One might measure X against Y by moving string, and in that fashion create 
an accurate multiplication - but only if X/Y or Y/X = an integer. Other- 
wise one is lost without further calculation, fractions, and so forth. An 
exercise: What calculations are necessary? What additional instruments?

Given the plain, it's easy to add portions and subtract portions - the 
latter by laying the flat-measure of one portion on top of the other, or, 
given the two-dimensional invariant, removing portions from X and placing 
Y within them, until the roughly the same shape occurs (providing one has 
geometry at work); one might also place Y next to X, and remove portions 
of X until it appears that Y and the removed portions are equal.

Appearances, appearances. Multiplication and division become much more 
difficult. An exercise! (And an exercise in perception. Again, we're run- 
ning into external instrumentation, tallying.)

Consider the heap: To add, add portions. TO subtract, take away. To sub- 
tract a given portion, take portions away until they appear equivalent to 
the given portion.

Or weigh the results. Or displace, measure water. Think of Archimedes. 

All of these bring quantity back by other means. Suppose there are no mea- 
sure strings, no way of judging equivalences, no waters, no scales. Then 
one might add by bringing portion to portion, and one might subtract - but 
only ikonically, by removing the subtracted portion. (This is quite impor- 
tant; if the abacus is indexical in Peirce's terms, the heap of substance 
is ikonic; representation is peripheral and obtuse at best. One is mucking 
in the real, not fucking in the symbolic. Literally!)

One could not, for example, say, remove 1/3 of that heap, or remove this 
amount Y from that heap. One would begin with heap X and remove Y, both 
unquantified, and then one would be left with:

X - Y

and Y.

How to remove a second portion Z such that Z = Y? This is impossible with- 
out external measuring.

One begins with heap or heaps, one separates, one combines. It is a kind
of concatenation without labeling. One can't say synchronically, spatial-
ly, that X = Y + Z, but one can say diachronically, temporally, that X
_did equal_ Y + Z. It is always a question of process.

I am sure I am making errors throughout. Nonetheless: With infinitely 
small beads, with the reign of _substance,_ digital meets analog; the 
raster is now infinitely fine, and the modeling of the real has become 
equivalent to the real itself. As above, the ikonic becomes identity, a 
movement from the equivalences constituting the digital, a movement from 
the _adjudicated_ (and hence the origins of culture) raster back to 
relative undifferentiation.

(If the digital inhabits eternity, the analog is worn, worn down; who is 
to say that erosion doesn't enter into the mess of the heaps, that with 
the division into Y + Z noise enters as well - Serres' Parasite - a bit of 
spillage, entropy, ultimately bringing down the constituted house? We are 
close to the _nerves of the real_ here, dissipated signals within which 
even the digital must reside. Pass the thresher, pass the threshold...)

unemptied, handless, ashes & charnalhouses, sparks & nameless flames,,,

after the filtering and after the protocols
after the enumerations, after the denumerations

what remains after the orbit
after the rockets thrust into datagrams and routings
across softwares and hardwares

what remains as higher ascii particles are cleaned up, the text 
rendered taut / distraught, nothing but ashes, it's just like
any work, all work at a _loess_

implementation of (infinite) abacus


balls in grooves & if you slant the rock they roll dependent 
   on the tilt and depth of cut so they do not fall out, 
   so they are there or not there
anyone can tell they are there or not there
bring the balls back, lower the tilt
so they lower the tilt, the balls remain
let ones move from groove to groove
later on it will remain for all time: let ones remain from groove
   to groove
count or capitulate balls
later on, the grooves worn, balls flailing against all accountancy
we must move the tallying
later on, museums of grooves, a few remaining balls, weakened, witness,
   positionless
lift the grooves from the surface of the rock, breaths of different
   exhalations furrowing the air
creatures scurrying around the elder place of tallying
office lamps, illuminations, you can hear the clacking of the balls
   even on the lower floors
