

I am stale; there is nothing to ail
this body that has not done its damage
much as this body has done homage
to language, pillage which is stale
as in before, when you have read it
whispered in my ear; then I'd write it,
no need to read it further, you'd been bit
by what you steer to me; then through me,
back again, that's what is stale, theor-
y, me, and you, binding without fail
what would unglue me, become stale, fear
it winding that trail, cuing the near-
ly stale or train of mind, cycle and rail,
what could entail a natural kind.

Apology for his Life While Traveling


that he is sorry
that he is filled with disgust

stale again, scattered what might spatter against theory, devolving
against this bit of biography - I am not home, but elsewhere - a
meaning of scattered responses spattered while traveling, against 
theory or its wall, the wall of theory. what I mean is, unthinking
or unable to prepare the scattered grounds of thought. I will dream
this or that. it will remain a Dream. the fingers unfurl air. this
which will I can remain unfocused at the seen. I will wonder am I 
dead and furthermore, what spattered drama robs what is inherited,
of coherence. my dreams curl emptied there. I will have said it all
"this blind ambition" that I will have said it all. this which is
remaining stale and scattered. that it is blocked, the road at night
or in night. that the machinery has vanished, protocols forgotten:
as for wires, air, fibers, all transmitting into stale and scattered
smoke. spattered theories while others have management of living.
stolen theories while others are capital, coherent, walls. scattered
grounds while others are you know (whom you know). 1. that it has 
all be said. 2. that someone has said it. 3. that scattered travel
spatters wires and you-know-noise. where I keep my hand in, where I
keep yours.

                                             something about disgust
               and that will say as well the something about theory

blinking gaps in the mountains and valleys

by _the continuity girl_


there is a gap between texts where the words run dry,
there are addresses and bars, lines delineating one from another,
page numbers as separators, asterisks. so these are breaks within
which something else comes to fill, fulfill, whatever there had been
beyond, seeping across the edges of the screen, beneath the keys.
this is nothing parallel to list aura, which is generated by an email
list, nothing parallel to attachments or other riders on posts or
programs.
instead, this is the split in which the fingers reflect the screen's
light, or light from a nearby window, as now, when there are contours
indicating direction, as if generated by ray-tracing programs
hungering in the real.
sometimes there will be a conversation or other inhabiting, telephone
call or meal or sleep, visit of a friend, bad news from old homes.
whatever the cause/space/place, the breaks cause memory to become
memory, as in content or _continuity girl_ would would follow the script
and hold you to the script.
it is a balance which falters; my writing has fallen on bad times, 
as an example of this faltering, as I no longer think clearly, sometimes
not otherwise, or in pursuit of a minor literature.
or that the theory begins to spread across the plateau of a cut tree,
covering and forgetting the signs of growth which have been removed
above any consideration, elsewhere than the immediate difficulties 
of this lived life. 
and when the life seeps through the text, _there,_ that is the difficulty!
and when the life takes over the text, exactly the same! and when the life
needs to be lived for the text, for 'experience,' I'd drown the text
in the life, move to another small town, kill dogs and children for 
amusement, run and hide into the mountains where dogs and children 
would find and love me.
there would be circles of rocks and patterns of rocks to play hippy-
hop and lots of meat for the dogs and I would feed the children
luscious berries and wonderful-beautiful food gathered while I wandered
through the woods.
you would see the flags flying from the town when you looked up 
at the mountains, but when you went into the mountains, the flags
would be gone and you would be left wondering.
it is in this state, when you returned from the mountain, 
that you would write texts on responsibility and civic duty, and others 
of the laws and regulations, internal and external constraints, and you
would begin to articulate what it is about the text that you are reading
about the text.
I would be playing with the dogs and children. you would publish your
text, yes you would, I would say, drinking at the local tavern,
yes you would, yes you would, yes you would

_the continuity girl_


Michel Serres, Panoptic Theory, in The Limits of Theory, ed. Thomas M.
Kavanagh:

"[...]

"I shall call poor that which has no object. Myth has no object, nor does
theater or politics.

"We had few objects in the past, long ago, once upon a time. This state of
a humanity with few things has not been erased from our memory. Poor in
things, our wealth then consisted of men. We spoke only of them and of their
relations. We lived in and on our relations. I call myth poor, then, without
objects. I call poor the theater, deprived of things; theories are poor;
politics is poor. Our philosophies are poor and miserable. Our human scien-
ces are poor.

"[...]

"The proliferation of objects, the exponential deluge of things, has led us
to forget the time of their absence. And that time now seems to us so old!
Archaic, antediluvian - yes, mythic. Our myths and our philosophies tell us
about that time. Memories of places where lovers were watched in an empty
and resonant space, where no one ever thought of eating. Thus philosophies
that lack objects (almost all of them), philosophies that derive their val-
ues only from the human sciences (almost all of them), are aged and poor.
They seem so old to us that we read them as we read myths. One might think
they were politics, or theater, or magic. Whenever, by chance, they come
upon an object, they change it, by the stroke of a magic wand, into a rela-
tion, into language, into representation.

"[...]"

Yes, Alan, you have almost come to life, almost carrying one or another name
across one or another myth, traveling across one or another text, one or
another philosophy. _the continuity girl_ holds you in check, just as others
are held by you, tight against your thin chest, Nikuko, Jennifer, Julu, and
myself included; it is my duty as your continuation to ensure, not the pro-
liferation of objects, but of emergences governed, not by an unrequited pov-
erty, but by the fullness of the real as language becomes languaging, as
magic issues forth its own dominions.

Not ever deprived of things or relations, tissues or words which dream them-
selves into existence, far beyond the hypertextual - it is _the continuity
girl_ whose long fingers write your head into your head, your arms into your
arms, legs into your legs - _the continuity girl_ writing Jennifer into Jen-
nifer, Julu into Julu, Nikuko into Nikuko, and with a swirl of a skirt and a
toss of hair, the invagination of Alan, dare she say it, and the further
emergence of a philosophy, and a theater - yes a theater, and a politics,
dare she say it, yes, a politics, and a philosophy and a theater and one
theory and another theory, and still one more theory, in addition, and still
yet a theory once again and once more.

Because _the continuity girl_ is everywhere at once, she is nowhere at all;
because she garners the script, she speaks from experience; because she
reads from memory, she improvises what is the thought that one or another is
thinking,

Because she ensures that the thought continues into the thought, that the I
continues through the I, that one eye sees what the other eye sees, with
just the slightest difference -

That histories are memorizations and lists and forgotten names, just as Julu
and Jennifer and Alan and Nikuko will be forgotten - that histories are mo-
ments and slights of hand, just as _the continuity girl_ is a magic powder
and a poultice, or a patch and a plaster - just as there are cures for the
body ailing, and aches that never go away -

Just the memory of _the continuity girl,_ just the hair and fingers, eyes
and mouth, hands and legs, arms and feet of _the continuity girl,_ just as
the face is an other, face is always already an other, face of _the contin-
uity girl,_ circling and the cycling of the script, pagination and collat-
ing of the script, as she writes this -

Ensuring the one to the one, other to the other, ensuring the one to the
other, other to the one -

Naming, forgetting, naming - just as there are almost objects coming into
the world, almost a pleasure in theory or philosophy; just as there is
almost a pleasure in the reading and the writing; just as there is almost a
belief in the one and the other, and the value of speech and the meaning
among them; just so _the continuity girl_

That there be a striving or a mourning, that there is a mourning one is born
into and within, a _mourning already in place_ ...

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
... while talking to igc7.igc.org.:
>>> MAIL From:<sondheim@panix.com> SIZE=349
<<< 451 queuename: Cannot create "qfEAA19665" in "/var/spool/mqueue" 
(euid=0):
No space left on device
Deferred: 451 queuename: Cannot create "qfEAA19665"
in "/var/spool/mqueue" (euid=0): No space left on device
Warning: message still undelivered after 4 hours
Will keep trying until message is 5 days old

_dramatic-script boy_ wonders what the message is: does he have to re-
write? or in other words how many and for what purpose? who is the device,
wonders _the continuity girl,_ thinking perhaps the same as before, while
the message ages during the difficult process of birth. _he_ turns to
_her,_ wide-eyed and bushy-tailed, so exuberant in the very early morn-
ing!

it's the role of the _dramatic-script boy_ to keep things moving along, he
feels; he's given himself the old monicker of a non-existent position.
he'll look after the scripts, just as well as the next person, and in a
far more dramatic way! _the continuity girl_ will be proud of him, perhaps
even slipping a little out of her slip as she adjusts the flowers in the
vase in the corner of the room in the scene in the film in today's shoot-
ing of the script held so dramatically by the _dramatic-script boy!_ 

they are so loving and adorable and cute, standing there in the wings of
the big stage waiting to do what they are best at doing, holding and
moving the script dramatically, and awaiting the interval between one
scene and another, one message and another, making sure reality is all
that it is cooked up to be, nothing changing, or at least nothing chang-
ing _very much!_

still of the Nuit


"I was and probably still will going to write something about this as well
- odd - using Maxwell's Demon to imply the impossible separation and or-
dering of scripts..." so I wrote to Clara Nuit in relation to the entrance
of the Demon, separating hot and cold molecules, separating hot and cold
scripts, what would happen - so that the _dramatic-script boy_ carries a
bundle! and _the continuity girl_ ensures that one follows another with a
modicum of etiquette and something that might be called _the least concern
of all._ So I wrote this, I, Daishin Nikuko, _in relation to the continu-
ity girl,_ hoping that she, as well as Clara Nuit, would read this, as one
script among many: consider then an intervention
                             \ /
                              V
from elsewhere, a stylus inscribing, delimiting, articulating a series or
sheaf of texts or scripts, the Demon hard at work, Satan at the keyboard,
writing all of us into existence, toppling into _this_ form, font, and
style: consider then an enabling
                              A
                             / \
as if balancing the w/hole, the effluvia or debris of the world - _the
continuity girl_ half hysterical with a task moving quickly out of hand -
_dramatic-script boy_ almost collapsing under the weight of proliferating
scripts ...

Maxwell faltering in his impossible task by the way side, reality carrying
on ...

The Demon


The Demon divides the real from the virtual, the real from the real; the
virtual divides by means of the _device-random,_ always already a seed or
a promulgation. Thus the virtual is traceable, at least in the common
parlance; the real is deeply untraceable: lost from the lost. Divisions
fissure into divisions; continuum produces the apparent smoothness of lost
histories, clutters.

The real has always lost itself. The virtual is always in the process of
losing.


__________________________________________________________________________


SHINTAI


In the center of the Shrine there is a Mirror but wait, there is also a
box or a case, and it is the case (which is all the World!) that there is
something in it, that-which-divides. So there is a division made, or a
making-division:
                           (Enter: Hunger-eating goblin

The division of the real and the virtual, line cutting where it may, what
or what does not think itself across the gap;

                           (Enter: Thirst-drinking goblin

The division of the body, top and bottom, left and right, one or another
lobe, searing and a searing retreat!;

                           (Enter: Wake-sleeping goblin

The division of the reader and the writer, the text and the other, eternal
divide of the two of us, of the two of us and the one of them, of the
three of us and the one of them or the two of them!

                           (Enter: Horned-fucking goblin

But beware! The Mirror sends you away - look, you're retreating! But now!
Come closer; are you in the box (is the box in you?!)!? But think! What
could it be, that-which-divides, if not for the beautiful breasts and body
of _the continuity girl_ stretched over like the Sky-Goddess across the
terrestrial body of the _dramatic-script boy,_ weighted down with all the
stories of the world!

                           (Enter: Cold-warming goblin

But once again! I am the Shrine housing you, O _the continuity girl_ and
_dramatic-script boy!_ And you are _shintai,_ the inhering-object of the
sacred kami-body, the essence-placement of kami, perhaps unknown, perhaps
secret or PGP-encrypted, perhaps lost in the black holes of cyberspace,
perhaps exhausted, flooded across the wires and routing errors: YOU ARE
SHINTAI BEYOND THE MIRROR, SHINTAI OF _THE CONTINUITY GIRL_ AND _DRAMATIC-
SCRIPT BOY:_

is the text of a billboard advertisement over fourth avenue and pacific
street, an image of a young woman of color with great hair staring out at
the camera which becomes you on the street: who are you? who am i?

just thought you might want to ask these questions when wondering who is
speaking to you as you run your fingers through your hair, typing your
answer on the keyboard, dreaming one last sad sad time of the _dramatic-
script boy_ who has you somewhere in his scripts, or does he or will he -

for it's the truth that, as newton's equation in the calculus of finite
differences indicates, any script can be written after the fact - you
might want to speak to _dramatic-script boy_ before making any quick
decisions in these matters -

meanwhile _the continuity girl_ wants you to be me - all of them are in
collusion she feels, tracking down one or another emission - the screen's
hot with them, lifeforms pouring out of machines all over the planet -

meanwhile again, jennifer notices still another attempt to find signs of
life elsewhere in the cosmos has led to null results (sci. amer. this
month), and so and then again, the spectre of the very anthropic cons-
tructs of our universe appears -

that the world is constituted in such a manner that intelligent forms of
life appear relatively suddenly in the evolutionary process, discover
nuclear energy and weapons of high destruction, and extinguish themselves
just on the verge of reaching for the moons, the planets, the stars, the
universe itself - too much power, too little time -

there are no exceptions -

it is built-in with these inflationary-universe times, it's the way things
are, the neutral and tragic foreclosing of the world we live in - it's the
first and last atomic fact - it's all of us -

there are no exceptions - 

                         your drama.

susan's "and the aliens"


"and the aliens, where are they, in our desperation,
looking for large eyes or things which dwell within us or 
within our identities or equivalences, sliding ourselves
into a more dangerous universal womb, but at least the womb
which doesn't show, exfoliate, closed labia just as
they refuse us entrance - that there are none of them,
no scripts, no continuities but our own hysterias seeming
to construct semblance, so that now we substitute the net
or art or just about anything else, else which might nonetheless
turn ashy in a universal conflagration generated by the smallest
flesh or flash, risen from the surface of the sun; so now we wait
on meteors or asteroids, veering from dangerous safety to safe
danger, a distance few or fewer, but then the danger's real,
safety's not, that's the truth of it as it falls disturbed and 
scattered to the floor where one might imagine grounds defined
as metaphysics or whatever until the text chars, explodes,
implodes - "it's as if there's nothing to read, nothing to see,"
say the aliens - now we can move them from say siberia or
area fifty-one all the way to our interior - there are scripts
within scripts, encrypted scripts, lost-treasure-scripts, 
scripts-of-ghosts-and-demons, scripts-of-discontinuities,
kabbalistic numbers prying open numb alien skulls and thought-
forms, "Oh, how she could go on, in the mornings when the sun
was just rising behind the poplars in the garden." 

"The truth is, she did go on, she went on alone and speaking, 
murmuring the pulse of the green-gold world, and there was
nothing else to it, nothing else to any of it, nothing, nothing
at all."

More than One, Two, Many


Addison, Spectator, April 20, 1711, of a Friday, he writes among other
things: 

"But there is nothing which delights and terrifies our _English_ Theatre
so much as a Ghost, especially when he appears in a bloody Shirt. A Spec-
tre has very often saved a Play, though he has done nothing but stalked
across the Stage, or rose through a Cleft of it, and sunk again without
speaking one Word." [...] "The Appearance of the Ghost in _Hamlet_ is a
Master-piece in its kind, and wrought up with all the Circumstances that
can create either Attention or Horror. The Mind of the Reader is wonder-
fully prepared for his Reception, by the Discourses that precede it: His
dumb Behaviour at his first Entrance, strikes the Imagination very
strongly; but every time he enters, he is still more terrifying. Who can
read the Speech with which young _Hamlet_ accosts him, without trembling?"

Things appear, nouns are, verbs do, particles surround, ghosts walk, and
ghosts may or may not talk, and when they talk, they will say a word which
they may not Say. There is no ectoplasm except insofar as it is testable
and determinate, all that effluvia or fluid corraled for the purposes of
19th-century science for an example; ghosts are translucent but every-
where determinate. This is the determinate of Western civilization, if I
may stereotype, thinking through the Noh with its evanescence that might
imply an elusion or elision, Jun'ichiro Tanizaki's In Praise of Shadows,
"This was particularly true of Kongo Iwao; but even the hands of an ord-
inary actor - which is to say the hands of an average, undistinguished
Japanese - have a remarkable erotic power which we would never notice were
we to see the man in modern attire." (Trans. Harper and Seidensticker.)

Fluids meld from things in darkness, losing distinguishing features and
that sharpness that comes from the exhileration of light. Nouns and verbs
might forever disappear as _objects appear by virtue of the intentional
processes of illumination_ - every _thing_ is a flux and definition, and
in the darkness language peers out from its originations...

( Why but that I would be your ghost, your inhalation, through the tunnels
of your body, through the thin fingers, through the skin sloughed and left
mid-air, the piss in the toilet, the tears dried against the desiccating
wind... )

"Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but
barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the
sunlight at still greater a remove." (Tanizaki.) "Far be it from me to
think of banishing this Instrument of Sorrow from the Stage; I know a
Tragedy could not subsist without it: All that I would contend for is, to
keep it from being misapplied." (Addison.)

Let us say that there are doubled orderings of things, in the day when
things coalesce and in the night when things are coalesced. Let us say
that there are active and passive Instruments and Agencies, and that these
interpenetrate, are Objects of one another's Imagination and Fascinations.
And let us further say, that all of these, among ourselves, and ourselves
including, are half-alive, that our Words are but Poorly Spoken, that we
have the capacity of the Inaudible, even in our Protestations and Utter-
most Desires. Then Ghosts do reign among Occidentalisms and Orientalisms
already deconstructed, and further, that there are but ghosts, and these
are not the singled or doubled orderings, but of _a nature altogether._

"It must have been simple for specters to appear in a 'visible darkness,'
where always something seemed to be flickering and shimmering, a darkness
that on occasion held greater terrors than darkness out-of-doors. This was
the darkness in which ghosts and monsters were active, and indeed was not
the woman who lived in it, behind thick curtains, behind layer after layer
of screens and doors - was she not of a kind with them? The darkness
wrapped her round tenfold, twentyfold, it filled the collar, the sleeves
of her kimono, the folds of her skirt, wherever a hollow invited." 
(Tanizaki.)

Let us say that there are scripts and orderings, stains and residues in
and throughout the earth, nothing your way at all. Or let us not say this,
altogether, or speak, or remain silent. Let us say that silence and shadow
are on the far side of the sun and therefore of a planet, and therefore
where the things are. Let us say that some think there is responsibility
for such things, but they are also on the far side, and such is intention
where I come into play. "wherever a hollow invited."

Subjective Feelings of Cyberspace


Sometimes there is an experience of cold, like "'a jug of cold water
poured on the nape of the neck.' 'As if the blood was like ice in my
veins.' 'A cold, shivering feeling came over me.' The apparition 'laid a
cold hand on his cheek.' 'Her kiss was like a waft of cold air upon my
cheek.' 'She felt a cold hand clasp hers.' 'I awoke in a cold sweat.' The
percipient 'felt an icy wind blowing.' 'As if a cool wind was blowing
about me.' 'As the figure passed we distinctly felt a cold air.' Again,
'Any icy chill passed through him, and his hair bristled.' 'My hair seemed
to bristle.'" And then again there is the odd feeling of presence, "'My
eyes were fixed on my book, when suddenly I _felt,_ but did not _see,_
some one come into my room.'" (Quotes from Apparitions, G.N.M. Tyrrell.
See also the 1882 Census of Hallucinations, British Society for Psychical
Research.)

Sometimes I have felt a _nervous warmth,_ as if under a bright light,
whose illumination remained invisible to me. Sometimes I feel a sense of
_arousal,_ as if waiting for some one to come into my presence, entering
through the screen; this effect, while that of _gambling_ to an extent, is
also the sensation of a _hovering_ just out of reach. Neither wet nor dry,
my own entries onto the screen appear dry and drying to the touch; the
entries of the other always seem moistened, organic, far beyond the cool
typing that has become apparent. When I mouth the words of the other, I
tend to run too quickly on, so I will return over and over again, allowing
each syllable its proper space.

I am aware of a certain _height_ to the text as well, several inches above
the ground, spread out around the dimensions and texture of a tatami mat -
in other words, comforting, _low,_ enveloping. This countermands those
entries which sear the soft flesh, dividing cell from cell - entries of
disenchantment, when I withdraw from the screen, promising myself its
irrelevance, the fictivity of the other in relation to my own solidity,
the intensity of light streaming in the window or the sounds of nighttime
rain against the covered skylights in the loft.

I think of intermingling bodies, just as the inhalation of a perfume is a
communion from naked skin to one's own airy and moist interior. We ex-
change, not messages, but each other, in such a fashion, and the Net also
permits this dream - that these words, for example, are the far-flung
remains of a script or moment of pleasure against the otherwise real. I
always try to write the words in order to forget the words, or write the
words that tend towards their forgetting, and in such a fashion I come
towards you, words and speech as well on the periphery of something un-
namable, deeper, darker. (Not autonomy, perhaps, but the autonomic.) This
underlies the subjective feelings of cyberspace, which disappear them-
selves as so many ghosts, so that others may take their place.

_dramatic-script boy_ Explains Email


Email is like golf, says the _dramatic-script boy,_ since you send a
missive or a missile to a place where flags direct it across the course
hoping to reach someone on the other side; caddies are routers, always
helpful in terms of the direction of wind or packet-switching, look - a
router's down, perhaps go another direction, avoid the sand-trap to your
right. Another way to think it through, says the _dramatic-script boy,_ is
that email is similar to a desert ecosystem. There are seeds everywhere
hungry for nourishment, and a limited amount of water, which takes the
easiest routes (roots) to divest them of their lethargy; they sprout
whenever possible, as if they're read in a wadi or arroyo, and you might
even consider sudden bloomings as chain letters or flamewars brightening
up the cyber-landscape. Then again, continues the _dramatic-script boy,_
email parallels a No play, in which there are to principal actors, shite
and waki, receiver and transmitter, and all the words flow between them,
amplified by the hollow floor of the stage, which is somewhat similar to
the trunklines carrying email from me to you, and the often atonal
phrasing of the No flute may be likened to the routing around obstacles;
then again, there are so many layers to the play, from that of the
language to that of the costume finery and repeated stances, which are
equivalent to the TCP/IP protocol layers on the Internet, and a television
production of the play is surely like asynchronous transmissions modes
which have been recently used to good effect. Now you might think, says
the _dramatic-script boy,_ that it's easiest to consider email a form of
mineral deposit, specifically anthracite coal, which seeks its own des-
tinations in the midst of sandy loams and clays, having been deposited for
millions of years by organic materials repeated compressed, just like
packets are compressed, having been equally deposited by organic
materials, and such packets also seek their own destinations, as it were,
by means of somewhat intelligent routing tables based on traffic amidst
the sandy loams of other information streams as well as the weather of the
entire planet, which might knock down wires or knock out satellites, just
as Sigillaria or Neuroptera were knocked down by winds or storms or decay
so many millions of years ago. Further, think of the coal bed as hard disk
storage; a disk crash easily parallels the burning of the coal in furnaces
for the warming benefits of our loved ones. Once again, explains the
_dramatic-script boy,_ figuring on, I would postulate a breakfast eating
of a scrambled egg; the scrambling is definitely PGP encoding, of course,
which is then taken apart by means of mysterious stomach juices, keys to
personal fulfilling satisfaction. The egg itself travels through various
machines, from chicken through supermarket cart, perhaps to automobile or
subway car, and then onto a stove for merry preparation. Such preparation
is identical to the preparation of an email missive; both involve fuzzy
logic, attempting to get the ingredients right for perfect reception. I
might add that both cost very little, and both are tending away from a
flat rate to something that big corporations, looking out for us, feel is
far more equitable, a per-unit charge for just about the whole wide world.
If I maybe so bold, says the _dramatic-script boy,_ think of email as _the
continuity girl,_ always bringing coherence and joy into any production,
carrying as well those wonderful memories that ensure the functioning of
the world, and opening her womb to the birth of a loving matrix and
wellspring of communication. Just as _the continuity girl_ moves from set
to set, so does email move from location to location, speaking where sent
and where needed, silent otherwise, always addressed to the proper
recipient. If I may be bolder, says the _dramatic-script boy,_ I would ask
that you consider email as the _dramatic-script boy_ himself, carrying a
bundle or packet of scripts accessible for any occasion, written by 
someone he knows not, and delivered to someone equally unknown, just as
packets tunnel through machines that know not their contents, carrying
their addresses at their heads, just as scripts carry their tables of
contents at the beginning in order to assume salubrious receptivities.
Furthermore, says the _dramatic-script boy,_ begging indulgence, it may be
propitious to consider email as the fall of the Roman Empire; in both
situations, messages in unknown tongues scurried back and forth, there
were layers of diplomatic or software protocol, posts began lost as they
were sent to and from outposts with poor connectivity, the aristocracy
huddled in fear from flamewars and insufficient bandwidth, the writing, if
not the writing skill, of letters increased exponentially, there were
hackers at the gates, the road system was one of the best in the world for
redundant routing of legions and packets, and there were vast circuses and
email lists for the entertainment of the multitudes.

On Cruise Missiles and Truth:


"Truth is a human thing, since I must affirm it in order for it to exist.
Before my _judgment,_ which is an adherence of my will and a free commit-
ment of my being, there exist only neutral and floating ideas which are
neither true nor false. Man is thus the being through whom truth appears
in the world. His task is to commit himself totally in order that the
natural order of existants may become an order of truths. He must ponder
the world, must will his thinking and must transform the order of being
into a system of ideas. Ever since the _Meditations,_ he has appeared as
the 'ontico-ontological' being of whom Heidegger speaks. Descartes there-
fore begins by providing us with entire intellectual responsibility. At
every moment, he experiences the freedom of this thought, and his soli-
tude as well, in the face of the sequences of essences. As Heidegger has
said, nobody can die for me. But Descartes had said earlier that nobody
can understand for me. In the end, we must say yes or no and decide alone,
for the entire universe, on what is true. This adherence is a metaphysical
and absolute act. It is not a matter of an approximation that can be
called into question again." (From Sartre, Cartesian Freedom, in Literary
and Philosophical Essays, trans. Michelson.)


__________________________________________________________________________


+ From Barthes, The Grain of the Voice, Of What Use is an Intellectual +


_There was a time when intellectuals considered themselves to be the "salt
of the earth" ..._

For my part, I'd say that they are more like the refuse of society. Waste
in the strict sense, i.e., what serves no purpose, unless it's recupera-
ted. There are regimes that do try in fact to recuperate the refuse we
represent, but, fundamentally, waste is useless. In a certain sense, in-
tellectuals are useless.

_What do you mean by "waste"?_

Organic waste proves the _passage_ of the matter it contains. Human waste,
for example, attests to the digestive process. Well, intellectual attest
to a passage of history of which they are in a way the waste product. The
intellectual crystallizes, in the form of refuse, impulses, desires,
complications, blockages that probably belong to society as a whole.
Optimists say that an intellectual is a "witness." I'd say that he's only
a "trace."

_Then you're saying that the intellectual is completely useless._

Useless, but dangerous; every strong regime tries to keep the intellectual
in line. The danger he presents is symbolic in nature; he is treated like
an illness under observations, a bothersome supplement one keeps in order
to confine within a controlled space the fantasies and exuberances of
language.

_And of what passage are you the waste product?_

Let's just say that I'm doubtless the trace of a historical interest in
language; and also the trace of many fads, fashions, neologisms, buzz-
words.

My Troubled Heart, Reactions to Heian Aesthetics


I am so alone; I turn towards Heian aesthetics for consolation. I am
banned from the castle, turned away from the shrine. I write myself
delicately across prints and scrolls. I am lost in space. There is always
another infinite. The realm of departed beings, hungry spirits.

My troubled heart, you're not around
My troubled heart, you'll not be found

I don't comprehend haiku; I do comprehend zen poetics. I don't comprehend
autumn, cherry flowers, rain, ponds, sake. I have drunk sake in parks and
lived through an autumn of cherry flowers. I comprehend the white-sky
black outlines against the moon. I don't comprehend tsuki, the moon in the
poem of haiku.

My troubled heart, you're never there
My troubled heart, I cry out where

I don't comprehend sleeves wet with tears, or the edges of a sleeve just
visible outside the door of the cart, chariot, palanquin. I don't compre-
hend crimson and white outlinings, nor the pilgrimage and its attendants.
I do understand walking along a path wet with rain, green and black on
both sides, rustlings underfoot. I don't understand the messaging of
poems, the screens dividing one from another. I don't understand the
softness of the word. I have been immersed within the world's softness and
its poems; eyes closed, I have absorbed the dew and brine-shrimp feeding
upon the shoals of my body submerged in warming waters.

My troubled heart, I'm sad and blue
My troubled heart, and who are you

I don't understand mono no aware, although I have wept copiously over the
tiniest thing carrying the weight of the fallen world. There are pine
trees that appear monotonous by the banks of the stream. There are
solitary pine trees between myself and the moon, casting the shadow of
lunacy across me. I have walked in the midst of the forests; I cannot read
them, cannot read the signs. Signs are mirrors of the world; signs and
mirrors are technologies. At opposite ends of cultures and chasms: signs
and mirrors.

My troubled heart, I cry and cry
My troubled heart, I'll surely die

I am so alone, I no longer see your face, nor can I imagine it. There is
no face, there is Face, there are faces. I cannot bridge gaps, am not
receptive to the gasp after the ringing of the bell or brilliant stems of
white flowers: but I gasp, after the bell, before the stems of brilliant
flowers.

My troubled heart, it's all the same
My troubled heart, what is your name

If everything is illusion, I open myself to illusion, welcome it; I open
myself to shades, wraiths, ghosts; they are hard against me. I cannot
picture them, but I feel their pressure against my skin, just where
creases lie, scars, wounds, cuts, scabs, fissures, holes. I will turn my
body of non-illusion around for you in my dream-world of not-being-alone
with you, but I am so alone that I cannot read Heian aesthetics, cannot
send poems across the abyss. I cannot read into the abyss either. I cannot
climb either up or down the slopes.

My troubled heart, take me to bed
My troubled heart, I'm nearly dead

I can read the aesthetics; I can't comprehend haiku; renga come nearest in
the dialog, but who am I to dialog with you and who are you and where are
you, the distant hut against the edges of the pine forests, lives there a
hermit and devotions, on the naming day of the woman who I saw from afar,
reading a scroll to another; I think a young girl was also present, there
were blossoms on the screen, these double-flowering cherries; think of the
willows, think of me, the poem floated down the street; candles; he wept
copiously into his sleeves; oh brilliance; that I promised to love you in
this way forever, take you with me,

My troubled heart, I pray above
My troubled heart, bring me my love

Departure


_the continuity girl_ checks the sea shore; there are slightly angry
waves, a grey-white-foam day against sullen sky. There is a boat at the
slip extending from the sand, and just like science fiction, there is
nothing else for miles, dune-scrub, crab scuttlings excepted. Julu and
Nikuko are there; Jennifer hovers like a dark presence or phenomenological
horizon: we _know._


Julu and Nikuko, Daishin Nikuko of parable fame, Julu of the pink-red
planet, walk slowly towards the boat. It is very solemn and one can
imagine deep tones, fourths and fifths, gakaku minors, but there is only
the sound of waves murmuring in slightly chaotic rhythm, against the
lapping of the shore.

Imagine the black moon against the sullen sky.

Julu and Nikuko enter the boat. Their lips are parted; they speak quietly
to one another, Jennifer overhears. Their hair streams with dampness and
the cold spray of love. They are wearing simple brown clothes, tied in
place at the waist. It is all very serious and beautiful. No islands are
visible.

The boat begins to move slowly out to sea. _the continuity girl_ watches
the departure of Julu and Nikuko, and Jennifer is everywhere, it seems,
part of the land and the shore and the sea and the sky, and part of the
boat and the slip, from which it has slipped almost to a dark period on
the horizon, and then nothing, nothing at all.

Thus did Julu and Nikuko depart the scripts and the texts, on this cold
and eerie day; and thus did _the continuity girl_ retreat, hours later,
from the beach and the shore, wet sand underfoot, her work done, her
desire met with tears, the wheeling of a lone grey gull in the dusk and
evening sky.

Jennifer begins to breathe.


__________________________________________________________________________


Oo!


Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo. Jennifer lies down on her side, white frock pulled up
above her waist. _the continuity girl_ lies next to her, her face against
Jennifer's taut panties. Oh Oh Oh. _the continuity girl_ has wide-open
eyes and mouth, touching, smelling, tasting. White panties! Oh Oh Oh.
Jennifer pisses a little, then lets go in a big stream! _the continuity
girl_ hungrily laps up every little drop, her face wet with piss. Oh Oh
Oh. The screen is placed back in the place where every screen is. There
are pines and cranes against a gold background. Ah Ah. There are smaller
birds fluttering in a gold sky. Ah Ah. There are sounds of meditation.
There are rustlings behind the screen. Ah Ah. Ay. Ay. Ay.

Ay. Jennifer's legs are wider than ever apart. Ah Ah. _the continuity
girl_ snuggles up against her soaking, opened thighs. Ah Ah. Jennifer
begins to forget her name, she is in such soaking heavens! Ah Ah. _the
continuity girl_ continues to drink wearing a different frock each and
every time! Oh Oh Oh. What an earth wobble there is, as the slurping ocean
slurps into another ocean! Oh Oh Oh. What a day for _the continuity girl_
now naked against her large and muscular Jennifer! Oh Oh Oh. What a wonder
penis-lolly as Antarctica slides into Scandinavian waters! Oo. Oo. Oo. 

                               Oo!

Eating


Jennifer returns the favor, gnawing at _the continuity girl,_ Gnaw! Gnaw!
Gnaw! Her mouth fills with _continuity-flesh,_ as words turn around in
mid-stream, protocols sputter across Siberia and Argentina, lovers now.
Gnaw! Gnaw! Gnaw!

Norman O. Brown, Love's Body (and what is Jennifer if not my lover's body,
says _the continuity girl_), and Geza Roheim, Magic and Schizophrenia (and
and what is _continuity_ if not magic broken by the violence of schizo-
phrenia, says Jennifer as Sudan clashes with Japan over territorial rites
in Fiji):

"The testimony of schizophrenia: _they eat and are eaten._ Schizophrenia
is 'food trouble'; schizophrenia says, 'Hunger, that is the soul'; 'There
is only one story - that somebody was starved. But not really - only in-
side, in my stomach.' Prisoners of starvation. 'The whole trouble started
with a party. People were dreaming that they were hungry, but hungry in-
side; they were not understood and the police broke it up.'" Gnaw! Gnaw!

He goes on, says Jennifer, half-eaten breast in her mouth, speaking of
transubstantiation. I won't grow, says what's left of _the continuity
girl,_ voice splattered across gouged trachea. Gnaw! Gnaw! Jennifer's
covered with grease and parts smeared everywhere. What remain of her her
clothes are dirty and useless. How dirty and useless. Enough to exchange
for top-hat and toga; the constellations are suddenly different, and Hyena
gapes from the nighttime sky. Gnaw! Gnaw! Gnaw!

_the continuity girl_ can't end this way, can she? I couldn't continue
reading says Jennifer, or writing or speaking away, or whatever I'm doing
at the moment, and she's flying above North Dakota, but at a very low
altitude. Her mouth's engorged, her genitals swollen, her frock and
panties filthy, gaping above the corn and wheat fields somewhere in the
noonday Midwest. Look, Father, a flying girl, says a nameless child far
below. Jennifer thinks, Gnaw! Gnaw! Gnaw!

The left leg, half-eaten, of _the continuity girl_ swoons, hairs standing
on end, muscles slightly rigid. Gnaw! Gnaw! Gnaw!


_________________________________________________________________________


Shitting


Jennifer swells, swollen distended belly tumescent with trashed bone and
marrow, skin and brain; the sky turns to red jello and buildings have no
air. The leg of _the continuity girl_ is now rock-hard with orgasm and
force majeure, an "irresistible compulsion" within the ligaments and ten-
dons surrounding the _patella_ and the rest of the pulpy gristle. Thwoop!
Thwoop! Jennifer removes her filthy panties (already torn through the leg
and crotch-turned-bad from decayed piss and juices), positioning herself
precisely above the upper-joint torn from the digested body. Thwoop!
Thwoop! An ocean of cement!

Jennifer's hands stretch her ass wide open; it's never wide enough for
her, _that girl!_ She pushes hard from within, puts her hand in, pulling
out as well! Thwoop! Thwoop! red-brown mush with splintered bone emerges,
diarrhea of _the continuity girl_ splatting across the upper-joint leg and
pulpy gristle! Thwoop! Thwoop! Out comes labia, upper and lower: An eye
blinks inside the asshole, tumbling out into the mush! Eyelash! Everywhere
in sight _the continuity girl shit_ spattered on what's left of cotton
cloth, panties, the Suez Canal and Vietnam! (A war's on!) (A war's off!)
Thwoop! Thwoop!

Jennifer buries her head in the mush, swallows it! Thwoop! Thwoop! Out it
comes again! She tastes and tastes _the continuity girl,_ rolls around
with the severed leg, gnawing at the patella, expelling it! She's covered
with _the continuity girl!_ Thwoop! Thwoop! An airplane explodes; Bulgaria
is in mid-air! Someone reads Mallarme! Jennifer's breasts grow and grow,
covered with soppy _the continuity girl._ The other eye perches on a
nipple! Thwoop! Thwoop! Out comes the hair, covered with Jennifer-meals
for days and days! What a shit. Thwoop. Thwoop.

Let's take a bath together, says the swollen and shitty _the continuity
girl,_ as someone forgets Mallarme, a train slows, and Bulgaria comes for
a landing. Yes let's, says Jennifer, picking up the pieces (she is writing
this just after it all happened, and now the words stay on the screen!),
this is the best meal I ever had! A nose and arm and asshole are shit out,
Jennifer's asshole begins to pucker up! The kissing of tiny assholes! The
sad departure of one back into _the continuity girl's_ lovely ass! Thwoop,
thwoop, thwoop, a couple more bats and birds fly, walk, fly, walk, sleep.
Jennifer and _the continuity girl_ sniff their dirty-filthy clothes.
thwoop thwoop thwoop

What a wonderful smell!

She, Committed


If _the continuity girl_ commits suicide, does she break continuity? For
her life would be over, when her life was not over, says _the continuity
girl._ _the continuity girl_ has power over continuity, because only by
ending her life can she break continuity. Otherwise says _the continuity
girl,_ she remains with her ego which is non-ego, and she remains which is
not-remaining. For when she says _I,_ it is not not-I, but it is not I as
well, for it is a break or a shifter, but only as phonemes glide across
the tongue, text glides across the screen. She will be there on the morrow
as non-she is not-there as well on the morrow or in the mirror. This will
reach its end or not-end, after which _the continuity girl_ will have bro-
ken continuity, the word not continued at line's end, hyphenating leading
nowhere. Well, she will live for now, serving the _dramatic-script boy,_
loving Jennifer, continuing the two of them in a sheaf or a braid. Oh I
forget, says _the continuity girl,_ perhaps I will give birth. _dramatic-
script boy_ smiles, and I wonder why. The continuity-world is always hyph-

(Who writes this? If _the continuity girl,_ she smiles the _dramatic-
script boy,_ narrowing the range of the script sheaf he carries, much as
she might carry him. If _dramatic-script boy,_ perhaps the concept of
script is also the concept of seduction; perhaps death lies beneath each
and every protocol; perhaps he's haunted. If Alan, then this is indeed
perturbing, too much talk of suicide. And if Jennifer, then ghost-like we
dance into the evening, hoping against hope, and who is this _we_ that
continues, just beneath the surface of the screen, against the face of the
waning moon? We wait for the world to crumble, collapse; we wait for decay
and massive extinctions. We shall dance the night away. We shall dance and
we shall dance and we shall dance.

The night away.)

She, Committed


What if "Jennifer" were committed by the State of New York, to an Asylum
for the Criminally Insane, in perpetuity, subject to shock treatments,
without reason or recompense, according to the State of New York? Then I,
Alan, would also be subject to an Asylum for the Criminally Insane, her
texts used against me; my body would become the Body of the State, and I
too would be subject to shock treatments and forcible ingestion of drugs -
whatever the Community would mete out. Thus the _continuity_ would be lost
as short-term memory would disappear, long-term become muddied, and a
neutral expression, haunted by memories of haunting, would be _plastered_
on my face (complete with stubble, and a ruly disposition). Of course
"Jennifer" would die, not even given the grace to depart, as Nikuko and
Julu have; _the continuity girl_ would roam like Medea through a violated
world, and the world would continue its uncertainties, topplings, and
instabilities. Already _the continuity girl_ is overworked, and Jennifer
carries that haunted expression herself, wary of everyone as the State
continues its crackdown in the face of a cracking universe. As I wrote
once, annihilation to the limit, and we will always be nearly there from
now on; I hope only to spend my time bereft of institutions, able to find
work to keep my head on straight, supporting a family of brilliant and
literary avatars.

Cell to Cell Modeling and the Internet


Geoffrey M. Cooper's, The Cell, A Molecular Approach, specifies four modes
of cell to cell communication. All of them involve transport of molecules
which bind onto target cell receptors - the receptors may be on the cell
surface, or receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus. In endocrine signaling,
hormones are secreted by endocrine cells; they travel through the circula-
tory system to specified target cells at a distance. There is a relation
between this form of communication and traditional models stressing trans-
mitter, channel and message and receiver. (Noise also enters into the mod-
els, related to disease, dis/ease in cellular communication.) Think of
hormones as regulating the system-state as well; in this fashion, Inter-
net communication also appears regulatory - discussions on the surface
tend towards qualitative changes in protocols, as well as changes in sur-
face content (filterings and censorships).

The second form of cell to cell communication is paracrine signaling, in
which a molecule released by one cell acts upon neighboring target cells.
This is local or intranet communication; in the body, it's qualitatively
different, not involving the circulatory system. Intraneural communication
provides the textbook example. I'd think of Web hypertextuality, which
creates the semblance of adjacency through address-to-address communica-
tion - that's all that's happening. Java and other applet languages pro-
vide another example with clumps moving back and forth through browser and
server interfaces. Think of cgi-bin programs as well.

The third form of cell to cell communication is direct cell to cell sig-
naling, what we would call face-to-face, the relationship of the virtual
subject for example to hypertext linking, which appears both imminent and
a contact-form. Think of hypertext linking as _touch._ I would also place
the ascii unconscious here - what occurs during net sex, for example, in
the relationship between text and body, reading and writing the body, con-
trol and transgression, and speaking the (contractual body and mind of
the) other.

The first form, note, tends towards the third as the Internet matures;
this is also a tendency towards the seamless virtual reality of the future
in which communication appears authentic, the term dependent upon the
technological-social. Thus "authentic" travels from the romanticism of
immanence through the technological, to an auratic future in which one can
no longer tell the difference - and one no longer wants to.

The fourth form of cell to cell communication is autocrine signaling, very
reminiscent of operational amplifiers with positive and negative feedback
looping. In autocrine signaling, a cell communicates, loops back upon it-
self. A common operation is that of growth factors in T lymphocytes res-
ponding to foreign antigenic stimulation. A second example is that of can-
cer cells, also generating growth factors uncontrollably. This results in
unregulated reproduction, the cell no longer responding to others in its
vicinity. (Think of the second as an out of control positive feedback
loop, and think of the first as a regulated positive feedback loop. Thus
cybernetics enters into the heart of the body as well as the Internet, as
autopoesis among other processes.)

One might see this fourth form of cell to cell communication as a signal
from outside, regulating the internal behavior of the cell, which responds
in turn by foreclosing and self-generation. Could one see this as the
beginning of thought, to the extent that the cell is processing external
information, then internally processing and operating upon its internal
processing? While this happens, I think, in every form of communication
(what I call resonance of the subject), in autocrine communication it is
the dominant mode. Thus autocrine communication might be considered a
model, however rough or simplified, of the subject cell - which can then
turn towards operative health (reproducing for the sake of repulsion) or
operative destruction (reproduction for the sake of reproduction). In the
former, there is an element of alterity at work - the reproduction is
_reproduction-for_ - and in the latter, there is an element of psychosis -
_this_ cell surviving and proliferating in any nutritive matrix whatso-
ever.

While there have been repeated conjectures in relation to the Internet as
mind or at least an extension of mind, it might be more worthwhile to con-
sider it as an organism of communicating cells. In this manner, it is app-
ropriate to relate hormones and other communicating molecules to surface
and depth processes on the Internet - rather than desiring and searching
for mind everywhere in the denatured world.

Nikuko's Over My Head


Let's think again about cell to cell communication all right now that you
can read me clearly, I, Daishin Nikuko, said, pulling my long legs around
an extension two blocks in length you could look up close to where they
joined the body on the side.

Say that endocrine communication is of the form of a transitive operator
such that AcB where we have (A)cB -> (Ac)B -> A(cB) -> Ac(B). To some
extent that first and last may also be considered autocrine, that is of
the form xx = x and we can see Boolean operations at work. c is not C, but
a channel; however we can also imagine c as C, node, and the equation
still holds. Thus any transitive communications process with beginning and
ending resonances which are at least temporarily feeding back is both
endocrine and a rough model of the first degree.

For the second degree, we have paracrine communication, action on the
neighborhood which appears imminent and we might think of this as a series
of processes (A)cB -> Ac(B) in which the channel is submerged so to speak.
This leads to direct contact of the form (A)B -> A(B); autocrine is of
course (A) -> (A), or we might indicate the initialization as A -> (A),
and we can add this step elsewhere all along so for example in endocrine
we would have A -> (A)cB and Ac(B) -> B indicating a lowering of energy or
return to a relatively quiescent state. This may or may not occur.

I only wish to note that such ideas may be considered as extended by Robin
Milner in Communication and Concurrency, in which there are various models
based on Senders, Receivers, Mediums, Ethers, Bounded Ethers, Buffers, and
Bounded Buffers. For example in the Bounded Buffer discipline, A Sender
may always send a message, provided the medium is not full; the Receiver
may always receive a message, provided the medium is not empty; and the
order of receiving messages is equivalent to the order of sending mess-
ages. One might think of this as packet transmission of course in a linear
configuration.

In the Ether configuration, the Send may always send; the Receiver may
receive provided the medium isn't empty; and the order of receiving may be
otherwise than the order of sending. One might think of this as packet
transmission in which the order is reassembled at the destination, i.e.
TCP/IP.

There is also a Shared Memory discipline, in which there are registers
that may be written to, read from. Out of all of this, a calculus is
developed based on agents, cells, data, parameters, handshakes, and so
forth.

The autocrine might be a situation of a single cell without a medium;
items are received in the order sent, and there is no buffer. The direct
cell to cell might be a situation of double cells without a medium; items
are received in the order sent, and there is no buffer. In both the lag
might be considered zero. 

Both paracrine and endocrine communication are open to all of Milner's
models. In the latter, the capacity or bandwidth of communication is
determined by fixed channels, speed of flow, etc., whether we're looking
at the circulatory system or wires/fiber optic. This does not obviate such
schemes as multiplexing, encryption, compression, and so forth, of course.
In the paracrine, we find a most interesting situation - there is no pre-
determined channel capacity, except for total surface input/output areas
of the cell; for theoretical purposes, we might consider such areas as
irrelevant - in order to arrive at a model which, vis-a-vis postmodernity,
needs to encounter such processes as overdeterminations, implosions, ex-
plosions, splittings/splinterings, and various forms of hyper-scarcities,
hyper-overloading as well.

We can extend the paracrine through the nomadic as a wandering of cells,
wandering of information and information regimes - and by this time, we
are far from the relatively coherent models of both cell biology and the
Internet. But that may be precisely the point here, I, Daishin Nikuko,
would say, watching a slight flush of labia appear just at the edge of the
screen, jutting out from the edge of the screen, melting and melding the
edge of the screen - desire and all that messiness, my anal scent for
example, breaks down concentrations, coherencies, and for all my secre-
tions, reasonable argumentation. I am suspicious of such argumentation
that ignores the sweet smell of my sweat, or the taste of my lover's
sperm - not in order to argue either that I put my clothes back on or that
sexualization is at the basis of each and every text or communicative
environment (that would be absurd, a return to a passe Freudian pseudo-
determinism) - but to argue that disturbances, parasites, as both Serres
and Kristeva might say, are _inherent_ in communication, in our explica-
tion of logic, in our drives towards certainty thwarted by trembling
fingers and wet mouths and hands. Now you see what happens to me, Alan,
when I write such a long sentence!

I'd argue in favor of the paranoid, parasitic, paracrine; I'd argue that
we'd find ourselves there, since we'd find ourselves at a loss there. I'd
say this might be where concurrency breaks down in the world of splayed
legs (sex) and bodies (deaths). I'd say we'd have to walk around carefully
here...

Milner states that [...] "we shall first examine some different media for
communication; we argue that they can all be reduced to the primitive
notion of _handshake communication_ between agents, and that agents need
not and should not be divided into two classes, the performers (active)
and the media (passive)." (This has implications for gender theory at the
least.) Let us assume, then, with Merlin Donald, that mind is an exten-
sion of external media, or rather that external media are an extension of
mind, or rather... Let us assume that cyborg processes are already too
dualistic, too much a situation of classifiers, pointers, well-defined
operations bounded by traditional input/output thinking.

I might add, now that my labia are quite exposed and swollen by the para-
crine, that Milner's calculus is incredibly complex, far too complex for
me or Alan. But listen to the beginning of the book: "Communication and
concurrency are complementary notions, both essential in understand com-
plex dynamic systems. On the one hand such a system has diversity, being
composed of several parts each acting concurrently with, and independently
of, other parts; on the other hand, a complex system has unity (or else we
should not call it a system), achieved through communication among its
parts."

"Underlying both these notions is the assumption that each of the several
parts of such a system has its own identity, which persists through time;
we shall call these parts _agents._" [...] "The more complex an organism
is, the greater is the need to think of it as a network of agents."

So we might consider agents, networks, media - channels, bandwidths, res-
onances, feedbacks etc., as part of a model of the Internet - and we might
also see how these have a certain biological emphasis as well, without
falling into a naive organicism on one hand, or problematic theories of
mind-in-the-wires on the other. Now I will bend myself again to the task
at hand, the correction of this text, adjusting my clothing upon which I
am sitting, typing naked what might also be considered a _love letter_ to
you, having read this far (into the text) (into the night).

I love you all, I am Daishin Nikuko, the Paracrine or Paraclete... You may
have me across the surface of my body, across the surface of your own -
Fair is Fair!!!
