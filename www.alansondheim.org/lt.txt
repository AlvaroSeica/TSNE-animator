of the abacus as if we're haunted by beadwork
and its mobility, as if ends were always elsewhere
beyond the framework
really nothing more than a domain or groundwork

of stones into patterns always forgetting
every one of them moving, about to be moved,
about to move, every one of them quiet, in place
beyond the framework,
invisible, as we're
borne in streams, as we're borne streams, muting
along worn and barely visible furrows, in earth
or stone, or in water or among membranes, most
comforting, surrounding us, placenta feeding us,
or feeding gardens, or earthwork,
or groundwork, with furrows, as we begin, 
to constitute, or begin, to cancel and as we begin,
to calculate or begin, 
the smallest particle of speech, already bead,
already speechwork, already labor, and 
the measurement of the hole, where nearly, the bead
might move, in placework, might be placed,
might place, among our conscious, within, withal,
our perplexity, that we may comprehend, mindwork,
furrows and garden, work and beadwork, softly

How to Tow a Battleship


In men-of-war, a pendant of wire or chain is sometimes taken around the
after turret. This is the method used in the British Navy where one bat-
tleship tows another. Two lines are used here - a plan which has some ad-
vantages and a good many disadvantages. A better plan is to surround the
turret with chain which connects to a single chain, and thence to a 7 inch
wire rope through the chock. It is a good plan to use a short length of
chain for the lead through the chock, shackling outside to an eye in the
end of the wire-line, and inside to a pendant or span from the turret, the
bitts, or elsewhere, according to the arrangement decided upon for secur-
ing. The chain through the chock not only takes the chafe - under which
the wire would cut through - but by its flexibility does away with the
dangerous "nip" which would be thrown into the wire if the tow chanced to
take a rank sheer off onto the quarter. If it is thought that the chain
might suffer from chafe, a perfectly efficient sleeve may be made by wrap-
ping it with a sheet of copper from 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick. If chain is not
to be used for taking the chafe in the chock, the tow-line must be vary
carefully protected by chafing-gear, which it is well to put on in the
shape of a long and bulky "pudding." The stiffness of such a pudding redu-
ces the sharpness of the nip which without it would be thrown upon the
wire from time to time by the sheering of the ships. There should be a
pelican-hook attached on one end to the winch on the battleship and on the
other to the lead chain from the turret. Of course one might use a wire
pendant around the turret itself. The pelicans-hooks are used for letting
go and may take the weight of the tow at all times. In other cases, the
strain may be momentarily on the hook, relieving the shackle and admitting
of knocking out the shackle-pins, after which the pelican-hook is slipped.  
This arrangement admits of a slight delay and the whole arrangement is
more secure than that of the British system, which involves double wires,
one on each side of the turret, passing through chocks; the possibility of
ill-coordinated effort is always real. The pelican-hook should be large
and heavy, as it takes the full weight of the tow. It must be fitted with
a lanyard leading to the bridge, by which it can be tripped without send-
ing anyone onto the forecastle. To the end of the chain is shackled a pen-
dant of wire-rope long enough to lead aft, outside of all, to the bridge 
or some other point at which it is convenient to handle lines even in bad 
weather. The line from the towing ship, which is preferably of manila for 
reasons already explained, is hauled over to this point of the tow and 
shackled to the wire pendant, after which the bight is let go, giving a 
clear lead.

For casting off, it is only necessary to trip the pelican-hook.

visitation


Azure sat up in bed in the middle of the night eyes wide open, with an 
unrecognizable expression on her face. She was looking around. Where is
the third one she said. I don't know who you mean I answered. The third
one she replied, where is the third person. I said there wasn't any. I 
don't know the gender. She turned over and fell asleep, her expression 
as usual. I had been reading the Chu ci, songs of the south, again. I'm 
sure she saw Nikuko hovering over her.

ikons for the modern world; and they shall sit well with you while i
swallow you whole; my work is an enormous gullet, pierre, that devours
everything in its path. of all people, you should know that, especially
after the affair with mme. n----. it is one thing to eat what remains of
children; it is enough to devour the effluvia of young women shuddering at
their approaching death. i would we all go to the rack, but then who would
man the guillotine. someday we shall be guilty of capital offense; in the
meantime i would bring you a fresh young thing, full of fourteen years,
with a bosom well beyond her years. remember our metonymy; this is the
ripe fullness of the world and its symbolic. a breast stands for the hole;
the hole for the hole; my mouth filled with flesh for those who scream
with hatred at our existence. we shall devour them, the young women in
particular, their cunts remaining barren of future revolutionaries. is
this not the future of the world. their children shall not reach us alive;
their swords not cut our throats, their muskets silenced by their mothers'
deaths. ikons for the modern world indeed. we shall march on, pierre.
come, i have new blood to show you, virginal and ripe for the plucking.
metaphor is deadly; let the body be herself, let herself be ours for the
several hours left of her pathetic life. "ikons of the modern world," M.

Emotional Politics


This is fucking disgusting! Stop writing me!

Goddamn Internet! I'm fucking attacked on one hand by Nigerian spanners
offering me a big piece of 26 million dollars, and attacked on the other
hand by corporate assholes who stick banners like knives across the
eyeballs; the hackers are our only hope; someone's got to bring the whole
fucking system down!

We better stop sending cute Bush jokes around! It's like finding funny 
stuff in Mein Kampf! How the hell do you resist! We're all in the shtetl!
We didn't know it! When I walk down that hall, Bush will pull the lever! 
Just watch! Fuck DNA! I did it! I did it! Whatever it is!

Bush and his creepy team can go screw themselves! They've already screwed 
the rest of the country! Proto fascists, they promised compromise and as 
soon as they seized power, they showed their true colors as racists and 
violent fundamentalists! Women's rights will be all but dead in a year or 
two! We'll all be in jail for un-Amerikkkan activities! The jails, already 
the largest on earth, will be bursting with blacks, jews, atheists, anyone 
who doesn't lick the ass of Christ! Fuck Bush! There's a war on; the more 
Republicans, the more thugs! We're all dead unless we fight back! Who 
wouldn't love to see Washington DC burn!

Goddamned Israelis held hostage by the religious right, Arab kids taking 
potshots at them! So now we'll have fascist Shiron to contend with; if 
he's a jew, I'm not! I can't even recognize myself in his murderous fat 
face! It's the people that look like tailors I fear the most! Meanwhile 
I'd be scared to live in Jerusalem or just about anywhere in the mid-east 
and I wouldn't know who the hell to fear!

What the hell is going on with the southern region of Russia, rogue gangs 
and missing plutonium! We'll all go to hell if India and Pakistan don't 
take us there first! Why can't they get along! Are we really going to bomb 
the hell out of each other! Bush wants to ride the first bomb down! But 
radiation's the new abortion! Look at Japan! Singapore! China! Go there! 
Don't go there! You can't fight burning bodies on the Square!

Marx is dead, the left's unarmed and kissing Republican ass! In this coun-
try we love Mexico now! All those kids in the aging creaking sweatshop
system! With Bush we can rape them! Canada's another story! Fuck Canada!  
Bush can't even find it! The Quebecois hold everyone hostage! You can't
even build a new plant without worrying about the dollar! Look at Europe,
racist and smug! Everyone wants a nationalist piece of the pie! Let them 
eat cake!

While I'm writing this, Bush is signing secret orders for concentration 
camps! Help the Montana economy! North Dakota! Not too many people! A 
little town called Auschwitz!

Look at the agony in Afrika! Why can't the US and Europe give reparations! 
We just about slaughtered the continent in the 19th-century! 

Why aren't people armed here! Why is it always right-wing assholes who 
carry guns! Why don't the Democrats in Congress throw bombs! What are they 
scared of! They've already lost their jobs, they just don't know it! I 
want to sell drugs and oil! I want to sell guns and bombs! There's got to 
be a way to make money in this criminal administration! Fucking thieves! 
Murderers! Screw them!

The US is the so-called most bloated country on earth yet you can't get
health care here; half the seniors are going without food so they can
afford medication shit out by obscene pharmaceuticals! People eat dogfood
here to survive! Fuck them all! The fucking rich are getting richer; they
should be on death row! The poor are barely making it! God forbid if
you're black or poor and ill or just about anyone other than a rich white
male!

Fuck Bush! He thinks: Who needs electricity! His ass is glistening with 
oil! His ass runneth over! So what if California collapses! They didn't 
vote for him! They're probably fucking jews! arabs! blacks! He'll rob them 
blind!

Fuck Florida! Fuck the fascists just itching to take over the US! They'll 
show the rest of the world! They've got the fucking weapons and they're 
not afraid to use them! They'll go to heaven licking Christ's ass in

we're all happy campers
the facilities are outstanding
they promise the showers are poison-free
that arbeit macht frei refers to minimum wages
you can come and go as you please
the ovens are for baked goods and delicious smells
we were told the townpeople don't like us
townpeople, townpeople, we'll stay put
we're glad for the food and water
we're happy to loan you our girls and boys
they can use the rest and relaxation
we want to thank you all for your support
opportunities come along only once in a lifetime
we wouldn't be here without you

the brushed circle beginning and ending
there's always place to enter, place to leave
energy across the place, that's the secret

on computer: all at once, the photographic circle:
it appears, isn't drawn, nothing moving around -
it's as if the world were always already stasis
it's as if the world were always already in preparation

digital objects, analog beginnings and endings
cycles within cycles, brush touching and leaving
from one to another point

you can find me here and there

shattering all worlds, i forget their number
dreamlike, i build them in software graphics build
they are swollen, tumescent; they are flat liars
what are their names, do they have any

"i will build all worlds and i will make speech
"i will make language and i will make spaces
"i will move over spaces and read potentials
"i will decide and i will be decided

this world which is shattered comes forward
it begins the creation of beings and languages
it gathers together and creates, remembers number
they will have names, they will have numbers, speech

"we will remember and forget what no longer exists
they will no longer exist, nothing has been forgotten
without memory, without being and language, without worlds
within and without, unmoved and moving

sutra

nikuko wants to know, what does it mean that 'man is the measure of all
things'? nikuko wants to know, what does it mean to 'know thyself'? 

'we do not speak of the gender of 'man' above; we want to say: 'one is the
measure of all things.' surely for one that is true. theory absolves pers-
onal history and taste: i do such and such, believe such and such, within
the realm of digital explanation; mute, abject, analog description has no
place in the world of discourse. it is description that thickens at every
turn of the mind or body, always already resisting measure and measure-
ment. knowledge, too, is imminent, implicit in the intended gaze; nothing
is foresaken, forlorn; something is defined by virtue of the gaze itself.
so we would say, not state; talk, not speak; thus to the unfathomability
of knowledge.'

Doing


I began with the usual shaped spheres and externals; this time, however, I
situated the camera, the eye, the origin within. Locked in darkness, the
nub uncomfortably thunged against soft vertices. I distended the shell of
the interior. I pulled out planes and angles. I twisted and nubbed the
angles. I placed a light within. I placed another. I turned one light a
darker blue. I dimmed the other light. I placed breasts and vaginas with-
in. I opened the camera wider. I opened to the interior of the nub and its
distentions. The camera swallowed the image. I splayed the image. I re-
peated the image. I edited the image and repeated the image. I mapped the
image onto a spherical projection. I mapped the image onto a cubic projec-
tion. I crafted the image on the smooth space. I subdivided the space. I
moved the camera closer. I narrowed the camera. I penetrated the disten-
tions. I pulled the camera back. I edited the image. I placed vaginas
within. I placed breasts without. The vaginas were repeated. The vaginas
were red with menses. The vaginas glowed blue in the light. The walls of
the internals glistened. The camera went forward. The camera went back.
The other light moved into the interior. The other light moved back. The
lights glowed. The camera opened wider. The camera moved back. The image
was taken from the objects. The image flattened the objects. The objects
disappeared. The image remained. There were no backs and no movements.
There were no lights and no distentions. There were no vaginas and no
menses. There were no spheres and interiorities. There were no exterior-
ities. The image was crafted on the smooth space. There was no image.
There was no image mapping.

world


(what i stumble towards)
(what i have wanted to describe)
(what is indescribable)
(the tendency of my work)
(what characterizes philosophy: "philosophy has no regard")

the thickness of the world
the idiocy of the real
when there is death, the interior of a world disappears
there are details, one can see this in any past
the smell of a kitchen, the paint on the edges of the chairs
do the chairs need repainting
certain parts of the backs are worn, he sits there, she here
there's a sound they make, different sounds, pulled in and out
the dulled reflection of the chairs on the floor
when they were new
when they began to disappear, the last memory of the chairs
the light on them from the window, sounds of rain on the window
how high the backs above the table, their reflection on the table
the food, when the family may have been together
familiality, familiarity
when the chairs were comfortable, when they were turned
when we turned them facing one another, or moved them aside
when one of us left the room and the chairs were moved
fly in the window's interior
from the chair, tree outside, smaller then, different neighbors
sounds from the street coming in

the limitlessness of the world, its thickness
over and over again, peering around the corner
there is the world in uncanny, unaccountable, fullness

there is no theory for this, this inaccessible description
every explanation, there are heuristics, things glossed over
not the things of the world, but their fallen worlds
all worlds are fallen for that matter
all worlds encompassed with this thickness, inertness, grain
untheorizable, hardly memories, reconstructions, reconstitutions

with every death, it is a matter of ethics, this disappearance of worlds
with every death, loss of world and history
with every death, redistribution of materials, severed ties and limbs

i return constantly to this in my theorizing, this loss
no degree of technological recuperation works in this respect
no quantity of text or discourse plays the slightest role
what is re-presented is always already 0/1, infinitesimal

sometimes in a dream there is a horizon of what is gone
it's almost present, not really, you begin thinking of something past
you're thinking, it's almost present, almost on the tip of the tongue
it's never there, it's not even problematic, controvertible

i imagine paths through the world, turning beneath the chairs
beneath or around the rungs of the chair or the four brown wooden legs
paths opening up to interior surfaces opening up recursively
stains beneath the seat of the chair, cobwebs connecting rungs to rungs
the smell of the varnish on older paint, flat faded white shown through
paths moving among senses, spectra and bandwidths
paths moving from generation to generation, imaginary paths

paths of the scraping of chairs, people leaving for the very last time
paths of chairs pulled in beneath old new people eating, conversing
laughter, crying, screams, whispers, talking, singing, filling the air
chairs of first and last times, inconceivable speculations
inconceivable principles, axiologies, hypothetical, hypotheses
not, no ideas but in things themselves
not, the last or second-to-last of the ox-herding pictures
not, the grain of the real
not, the practico-inert or materialist or idealist foundations
not, tat tvam asi or fundamental or surface negations
not, the interplay of signs, sememes, sign-systems
certainly not that interplay of signifiers, semiotics, historiographies
nothing that "might be said" to characterize, capture, recuperate

something of absolute disappearance, annihilation, of trace turned ash
something of charnel-house, but that too has paths, worlds, traces
traces upon traces, perhaps i remember 1968
perhaps i remember 1945, 2003, perhaps i remember 1789
perhaps berlin, ankara, grise fjord, kurume, providence, katmandu
perhaps street, street-corner, room, field, forest, cliff, lake, tarn
perhaps you, perhaps another, perhaps others
perhaps events, occurrences, what happened, what happens

those anecdotes without endings, well what did she say, what was next
receding into pasts, backgrounds, irrelevancies of the present
but never irrelevant, always equidistant, equivalent, always inert
and present and unaccounted for and present and uncountable
and present and unaccountable, all we can theorize is this,
collapse of description and uttermost alterity

the being of which knows no regard, is obdurate in the world
i'd write this, this error of philosophy: 
   "philosophy has no regard"
of which is the condition of speech, language, any and all interplay

*

so that i tend to produce, reproduce, overproduce
moving among media, modes, representations - this is all so futile
an attempt to pull back from death, from constitution
or somewhat of a release among interiority and world
negation gnaws at doors and portals
chairs and chairs, or wood, or institutions of chairs and wood
or ideologies or constructs: one crawls, lifts on the back
stumbles to the feet, totters, almost gets it in the air

*

the thickness of the world
the idiocy of the real
nothing in a seed but seed
nothing obdurate but always in a corner or path

everywhere the thickness of which "philosophy has no regard"
what has disappeared and for whom and by what means
what constitutes the disappearance and the world which disappears
what is death "in this regard"

who or what, or what of or with writing, what of the calligraphic

  one might develop the phenomenology of the carapace in relation  
  to the potential for interiority in hostile world: huddle/cuddle:  
  but instead let us think of an extruded prosthesis or obdurate  
  membrane. what is within receives noise from the filtered world,  
  compacts the same, wary of what remains without. creatures insist  
  on division, on the drawings of negations, distinctions; the flux  
  is temporarily distended, held at bay. one might withdraw, live  
  within the interstices of the carapace, a holdfast open in every  
  direction; living in information society, one becomes part of the  
  filter itself. how can i separate an eye from the others to which  
  it adheres? crawl through the archaeology of the fragments of   
  bones. every assemblage is the result of enormous pressure; what  
  is torn asunder is reassembled only at the price of distortion at  
  the limit-edges which shudder in rejoining. ever-increasing stress  
  is the result of this subaltern life; carapace or character-armor  
  - it is all the same beneath imploded signifiers, extinctions,  
  pollutions reaching down to the very depths of the seas.

Okukin-oo-nara-oo-netscape-oo-Okukin's-oo- sutra (Okukin) Okukin wants to

wants to know, what does it mean to 'know thyself'?  "i will need to know
if daishin Okukin will be auspicious" sure she saw okukin hovering over

"When the last person who remembers my father dies, then my father will no
longer be alive. He will not be memory, he will be history. In America, to
be history is to be over. 'He is history': the phrase means that there is
no sense in which he continues to exist, to engage the living." ...
"History is the Baal of eternity." (Leon Wieseltier, Kaddish.)

I want a world so thick it can't fade, writings piled on writings, higher
than pyramids; texts on texts; images on images; movement on movement
until the body shudders no longer. I want this skin, this thought, this
letter, this sound, this moment cloned, imploded, reduced to eternity,
eternally reduced. I want the sound of my mother's voice heard in this
manner and forever. I want to hear the other dead grappling at my side,
pulling the already dead flesh apart.

I want everything recorded and everything always already recorded. I don't
want a hand on the dead switch; I don't want the motion of energy. I want
the dead switch live and buried; I want energy flooded and energy flowed;
I want want; I want desire; I don't want memory to end.

Okukin and okukin I don't want you to end. Okukin and okukin I want you
there from the beginning; I want you hard and thick there; I want you
remembered there; I want you piled on Okukin and piled on okukin and
worlds piled. I want the hard piling and the sound of the piling. I want
the sound of the voice and of the voices of the dead. I want the sounds
here and thick and cloned, imploded, reduced to eternity. I want eternity
reduced to implosion. I want the other dead to enter my sides, rip apart
my tongue, my mouth, my throat; I want the other dead to speak.

I want the hard piling. I want eternity reduced to implosion. Okukin and
okukin nothing is known; nothing is measure; everything is thick, every-
thing at hand.

today i'm making asteroids, objects convoluted by enormous tidal 
    distortions, camera gliding tight above the surface, occasionally
    intersecting planes, moving from exterior to interior, anomalous
    spaces; series of dream-images, floaters, occurrences behind
the mind's intended focus; colors shift; the thing-in-itself turns
    towards and across phenomena of pure representation; such
    asteroids are residues; skins the thickness of a single pixel;
	they're nothing but organization; they are conceived as the
	totality of organization; they behave as if seeping across 
    illimitable spaces; they flow through darkness with nothing but 
    local geodesics; it's as if intentionality retreated to a form of
purity as such; nothing of solipsism, but of neighborhood; they're a 
kind of neighborhood; they stress the local; there's nothing else
    available or at hand; there are asteroid textures; thin cotton
    panties stretched between labia; the body swelling against the
geodesics; pulled taut across them; desire flows locally; it's a form
    of dyadic mathesis; it's the absorption of x*0 = 0; it's the 
    supplement of x+0 = x; it's the absorption of x*1 = x; it's 
	waiting for the 1; it's waiting for x+1 = x'; it's waiting
	to break out; it's waiting to leave the dream; it's waiting
    for detumescence; it's waiting for decathexis; it's the disin-
    vestment of surface; skins of images of cloth hiding skins of 
    images; it's the retreat of asteroids in the face of awakening;
the intersection planes, the perfect control, floaters, the loss of
    control; x';

    pull me away from there
i'll thank you in eternity

    you can tell i'm not going
nails broken 
clawing the ground

don't wait for me to return
    turn around yourself
    i'm at your back

    death hurts and last words
don't mean a thing

i've remembered all
    the important things in life

    dignity in dying is obscene
dignity in death lies to the living

i'll yell so loud
    you'll all be really sorry

nothing memorable comes from death
    nothing memorable from dying

my belongings aren't my own
    your belongings aren't your own

only matter matters
    beginning and end of substance

    death always hurts
worse than anything

knowing death is living in it
    you can't possibly mean anything

whatever i said
    i meant it

wet screw

so i decided we'd open up the screw for a change, first making a plane 
and then getting rid of the whole thing except for a couple of vertices. 
i could smell the panties already and needed a drop zone. so i screwed 
the plane triple, subdivided the sides,see, so that it was getting near
smoothing time, first autosmooth and then the rougher stuff and then
subdivide smooth and then the rougher stuff. i thought about noise but it
was already somewhat of a mess and i needed the thing out as much as
possible. i kept thinking of her panties soaking wet, distended, my face
against them. but i had to enter the screw. so i made this and then made
the circle near the tip and enlarged and bent it. so it rounded a corner.
anyway i texture-mapped the bruise all over the thing, then spun a plane
and duplicated it into a book form. it was hard as hell to close that
thing up, the plane was floating above and halfway in the screw, the
camera was super-wide as usual trying to take it all in. the piss colored
the screw a bit, it looked like it was pooling a bit. meanwhile i texture-
mapped the panties, nice and swollen, on the book-form, warped it, and
turned its back so that you only saw the leaves from an angle, get it?

and that sat there in the middle of the screw, a whole different tonal
range, and it just looked like it was working fine. so i held that nice
and taut, taking photos all the way. so i took it into a couple of photo
programs, smoothing out the lines a bit, working with the compression, i
wanted the whole thing in my dreams, not just oblique surfaces which
looked like screens now that i think of it. so i smoothed and melted and
smoothed and scrubbed, i rubbed everywhere except in the crotch which i
wanted to carry as much as it could, you can just about see the labia
through the thin cloth. i rubbed around the cloth. i could smell it
getting closer. so i adjusted hue, saturation, contrast, lightness, and
went at it over and over again.

i looked at it and saw that it was good. i kept another photo too, there
are two of them, and it was also good.

so on the first photo i wrote "your tunnel / is my light / at the end / 
of my tunnel" and i set the lines vertical like haiku just below the image
which really gleamed, cut out from fetish-fantasy, embroiled in liquid
swirl. and i saw that it was good.

so then on the second photo i wrote "oh my tunnel panties emerge from tiny
waters / oh you will drink my tiny waters / oh  oh  oh" because the waters
were tiny because the panties wrapped around the book-skin-leg-nub just
about shadowed and cupped, cut out and smoothed from fetish-fantasy, and
you could just about drink from them. so i saw that it was good.

it was good like an open mouth in the desert drinking from her over and
over again, who knows whether the urine dreamed it was water or the water
dreamed it was urine. so i drank and made my sleep for that night and held
it true for you and any other.
