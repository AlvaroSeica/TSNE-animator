Annoying Behavior

Annoying and annoyance are difficult to analyze. Yet they form a behav- 
ioral matrix, appearing in such forms as teasing, taunting, daring, 
whining, infuriating, and seducing. The phenomenology of annoyance is 
complex; among animals, annoyance plays roles ranging from deflection to 
prey production. Crows and other birds will annoy hawks; smaller birds 
will annoy crows - in both cases to lead the larger birds away from 
potential prey. Egrets on the other hand will annoy bottom-dwellers, which 
flee their hiding-places and are caught. Their behavior ranges from wing- 
flapping and circling to leg vibrating and kicking back. These actions 
change quickly, decreasing the likelihood for a steady-state response by 
potential prey. It's unclear to what degree this behavior is learned or 
instinctual. See http://www.asondheim.org/annoyingegret.mp4 - a snowy 
egret at dawn in the Bolsa Chica wetlands, Huntington Beach, California. 
Other examples - chipmunks, squirrels, and various bird species taunting 
rattle-snakes; coyote and other large predatory animals harrowing prey; 
annoying by the weaker and taunting by the stronger, among humans.

Our Future

In 1973 I taught "The Year 3000" at the Rhode Island School of Design. 
Most of the predictions described for the year 2000 have already occurred. 
Now for the modest future of thirty years hence:

All megafauna in the wild will be extinct. The population of the earth 
will be close to its carrying capacity. Disease will run rampant due to 
pollution. Global warming will bring about fast-forward environmental 
effects, including rising seas, increased desertification, and extremely 
violent hurricanes. The life-span of humans will begin a temporarily 
exponential decrease. The rich will live in highly defended enclaves. 
Fundamentalisms will be the order of the day, since belief alone commands. 
Terrorism will be increasing exponentially, since future paradise is all 
there is. Capitalism will be bankrupt as national currencies collapse and 
world-wide depression sets in. The information explosion will continue on 
localized data-networks and stuttering global communication systems. The 
global communications infrastructure will have reached its carrying 
capacity as well. For the first time, information will begin to corrode, 
decay, as structures can no longer be protected against the world-wide 
environmental crisis. The smaller generalist flora and fauna will begin to 
dominate the earth. Great portions of the globe will be uninhabitable. The 
larger aquatic species will have gone extinct, and the oceans will be 
dominated by off-shore algal blooms. Most urban drinking water supplies 
will be polluted and rationed. Suburbs will be abandoned as gasoline 
becomes an almost inaccessible commodity. The planet will seethe with 
continuous war, no longer fought among nation-states, but among private 
militias, guerilla groups, and individual cowboys. Religions and 
extremisms will be intertwined. There will be heavily-defended holdouts in 
the North American mountains, and relatively isolated land masses such as 
New Zealand. Fluid urban structures will be composed of well-armed gangs 
dealing with the major currency of drugs and weaponry. At least a third of 
all births will result in deformed infants. Ozone depletion will be almost 
complete and skin cancers will be exponentially increasing. Most hospitals 
world-wide will have closed their doors to all but the extremely wealthy. 
Knowledge-structures will have broken down as specialization and increased 
mathematical difficulties result in the problematizing of any theoretical 
work at hand. Computers will have reached a plateau of speed, complexity, 
and miniaturization. They will not have achieved consciousness. Robotics 
and nanotechnologies will not be the order of the day - plagues will. 
Sports franchises will be local and heavily subsidized. The air will be 
almost unbreathable, and asthma / allergic reactions will be one of the 
primary causes of death. Most deaths however are the result of violence. 
Local police will perform rearguard holding actions at best. Highway 
systems will have fallen into disrepair as economies collapse. Air travel 
will be almost non-existent; space travel will have disappeared. The space 
station will be a rusted hulk, if it has not already plummeted to earth. 
Literacy will be on the decline. There will be a world-wide energy crisis. 
Child abuse will have become child use and child discard; a high 
percentage of children will be proffered for labor and sexual slavery, in 
return for food and goods. Informal economies and the barter system will 
characterize most local trade. Transnational trade will be at a minimum. 
The genetic revolution will result in new and uncontrollable pandemics as 
viruses and bacteria become increasingly resistant. Highly modifiable 
immune deficiency diseases will appear on an exponentially-increasing 
basis. The greatest percentage of murder victims, per capita per age 
level, will be the elderly. Despair will be transformed into religious 
salvation. More than twenty nuclear weapons, most of them small and 
poorly-constructed, will have been exploded in various urban areas. Most 
of the countries of the world, such as they are, will have weapons 
programs which will absorb a large proportion of the gross national 
product. Political economy will be ad hoc. Political ideologies will be 
fragmentary and situational. Electrical grids will be hard-put to maintain 
even the most minimal of services. The arts will have reached the limits 
of extremity, with suicidal art movements in the fields of theater, 
performance, ballet, and installation. The new media 'movement' will have 
become a thing of the past. Art history will have disappeared as museums 
fall victim to gang warfare and destruction. Most national heritage 
monuments will have been at least partially destroyed. Most populations 
will be drugged...

Philosophy of [spam] Pornography

"How're you doing? Pelite teen pussy doing all sort of nasty things: 
masturbating, licking pussy, fingering herself [...] The 1980s are to debt 
what the 1960s were to sex.  The 1960s left a hangover. So will the 1980s. 
Just girls, playing, posing hot and teasing each other. Action is 
coarsened thought thought becomes concrete, obscure, and unconscious. 
Don't waste your chance to see beauty in the very prime of life ! Refrain 
from asking what going to happen tomorrow, and everyday that fortune 
grants you, count as gain. He seems determined to make a trumpet sound 
like a tin whistle."

[This article is somewhat of a mess; I don't think it could have been any 
other way. At least by me. It's overworked, overdetermined. Trying to 
write about online writing? An impossibility, an inconceivable territory. 
It's beginning to sound like an illiterate Foucault's archaeology of 
knowledge.]



A Field so Vast, the Other is Lost in the Details


Apropos of Writing Online / Online Writing

"The Sceptical persuasion, then, is also called Investigative, from its 
activity in investigating and inquiring; Suspensive, from the feeling that 
comes about in the inquirer after the investigation; Aporetic, either (as 
some say) from the fact that it puzzle over and investigates everything, 
or else from its being at a loss whether to assent or deny" - Sextus 
Empiricus, Outlines of Scepticism, edited by Julia Annas and Jonathan 
Barnes, Cambridge, 2000.

"I cannot stress too strongly, however, that for life as we have seen it 
develop, both place and movement are indispensable. In order to store 
information - say in a book, or a mind, or a computer memory - one must be 
almost certain that the information will be stationary and yet retrievable 
at a later date. In order for this to occur, the object containing the 
information must retain its configuration for limited periods. Further- 
more, [these periods] must be enough for all the information contained to 
be retrieved." - Alan Sondheim, artist talk, 1973, in Artists Talk, 
1969-1977, edited by Peggy Gale, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, 
2004.

Unlike the Dogmatists, online work is continuous investigation, movement, 
within diffused sites, applications, networks, inter- and intra- nets, 
PDAs, cellphones, wireless and bluetooth, satellite and other radios, 
cable and other televisions...

An incandescent investigation, high-speed, apparently but not really 
unlimited, names and movements, critiques, sources and files, coming and 
going, circulating, decaying, disappearing, reappearing, transforming...

New media writing - codework - hypertext - online writing - blog or MOO 
writing - all of the forms are problematized, liminal, subject to 
fast-forward taxonomies as new applications and access modes appear.

By "liminal," I mean that such writings are first of all mediated, by 
technological apparatus (including the power grid), and are second of all 
in-between process and stasis. Process = continuous production and 
distribution; stasis = virtual objecthood.

Liminal work is nomadic, subject to the vicissitudes of empire; it moves 
from site to site, is updated or disappears, uses legacy technology or 
processing power / access available only to a few. But it also requires 
corporate acquiescence - the access to tools (including the power / 
network grids); free software requires corporate hardware requires 
programmers who have to eat and sleep (sometimes!).

One distributes through pre-existing channels or new channel production. 
Once distributed, the texts, which are after all a collocation or ordered 
collection of ones and zeros, or pluses and minuses - or any other dyadic 
differentiation, are subject to modification by others - and as such are 
vulnerable and characterized by imminent access.

By "imminent access" I mean that any byte whatsoever - any individual 
smallest unit of a file (text, sound, video, program, other) - any zero or 
one - is independently accessible, and therefore independently alterable. 
The alteration of a file-in-the-large is a process of filtering, and one 
might consider online writing as a form of articulated and non-articulated 
filtering.

By "non-articulated filtering" I mean the actual course of writing by an 
author; this may be either a process of subjectively and freely choosing 
program parameters (i.e. a certain number of nouns of type X), and/or a 
more traditional process of authorial writing, i.e. writing with authorial 
intent. By "articulated filtering" I mean a form of mathematization of a 
text or part of a text, through which the chosen domain is modified in its 
entirety by one or another algorithm. For examples: non-articulated 
filtering might as well refer to the writing of a sonnet in the 
traditional manner; articulated filtering might refer to replacing the 
vowels of the sonnet with randomly chosen consonants.

(So that "articulation" is used to refer to the application of a 
technological apparatus - most often a software program - to a text or 
other file. A Photoshop filter which alter a photograph from color to 
black and white is a good example. And "non-articulation" refers to "just 
writing." So why are both forms of "filtering"? Because, here, I want to 
emphasize the substrate - the blank sheet of paper or empty file, for 
example (Peirce's "sheet of assertion") which is filled or spilled through 
creative work. The filter goes from blank to content; it's a way of 
thinking through the creative act, from offline to online and back again.)

An online distribution is never complete, never completed. Sites and 
software protocols change, codes change, revisions are added, texts are 
hacked, texts are duplicated and downloaded with and without permission 
(such as it is), sites disappear with their texts, texts are replaced by 
other texts, texts are corrupted, technologies change, bandwidths change, 
copyrights are enforced or ignored or bypassed or non-existent: 
intellectual property is in fact intellectual propriety, an agreement, 
such as it is, to utilize in any form or not utilize in some forms (i.e. 
other than reading/perceiving) the production of the other (such as he or 
she or it - computer or whatever - is). (Intellectual propriety, then, is 
the etiquette of duplication and transformation, the sometime distinctions 
between hacking and cracking, between payment and non-payment for 
downloading, and so forth.)

Codework is a form of writing which problematizes form and formlessness 
simultaneously by incorporating the means of production within the file 
itself, actively or passively augmenting or corroding the file (depending 
of course on authorial intent, perception, reception, production).

By "active augmentation or corrosion" I reference a file which changes 
either through reader/viewer interaction or by itself, within a relatively 
limited period of time (i.e. within the phenomenological time-horizon of 
the reception of the text). These changes may be anything from automatic 
text / image / sound generation, through interactive generation of the 
same, to built-in instabilities of reading and writing (language changing 
on the fly, and so forth). Texts and other files may respond to anything - 
from the weather through mouse-clicks through the viewer's breathing 
patterns (coupled of course with the proper hardware). By "passive 
augmentation or corrosion" I mean a relatively static (i.e. within a 
similar time-horizon) text which nonetheless incorporates what might be 
considered surplus or extraneous elements (parts of code, formatting, and 
other) and/or eliminates or obfuscates ("corrodes") other elements (for 
the most part taken for granted within traditional texts and readings, 
such as the full alphabet, more or less standardized syntax, the and so 
forth).

Codework is neither a style nor a movement; it remains a loose term 
characterized by a "kind of messiness." It is simultaneously conceptual 
and loose, based on structure and the deconstruction of structure. An 
example (of my own):

========================================================

ANDre

========================================================

CHURNMONSTER is a "broken or dirty text," modified by a program I wrote; 
the program asks questions, mixes and combines and reorganizes the 
answers. The result is a combination of what I am or might be trying to 
say, and code interference, which rises to the surface, for example, "And 
it has taken you just 5.200 minutes to make a monster!" which simply 
documents the amount of time it took to enter the text. I can't judge this 
in terms of traditional literature; I can say, however, that what is 
produced is almost always a surprise - something that comes from partially 
externalized, partially internalized structure.

========================================================

Wittgenstein: "(He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has 
climbed up it.)" - Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Pears & McGuinness 
translation. But what if the rungs are spaced irregularly? What if there 
is nothing at the top but gaming?

Codework is simultaneously fashionable and eternal. Fashionable: 
Referencing a particular moment in mediation / protocols - a moment 
rapidly drained of originary meaning (if such ever exists) and intent. And 
eternal: Since very file is equivalent to each of its copies, it survives 
as a form of fragile or tenuous structure.

(Fashionable also in terms of critical discourse, discourse networks, a 
style which is already superseded. And eternal, in the sense that the 
issues that arise are always present, in whatever form writing / video / 
sound takes - the issues of protocols, programs, receptions, delivery 
channels and vehicles, technologies, economics, labor.)

Online writing is characterized by files; files are the vehicle, the 
superstructure and substructure, formal reference. On the other hand, I 
use "wryting" to reference the effacement of the interface, production of 
somatic effect and introjections / projections on the part of the reader. 
In other words, if there is writing of / on the body, there is also 
wryting the body, for example the (always) broken texts of pornography.

(Wryting is the result of the abstract and technological nature of online 
/ new media work. One tries to imagine, through the text, the body of the 
other; net sex is full of this. As bandwidth increases, radio turns to 
television; the body is now presented, optical, replete, on devices 
ranging from cellphones to caves (three-dimensional virtual-reality 
environments). Primitive teledildonics mediates sexual touch. Note that 
these environments, in fact even video cellphones, are the domain of the 
privileged; there are access codes as well. Whole economies are involved.)

I am characterizing nothing. There is little distinction among codework, 
online work, offline work, new media, new media writing, net art, wryting, 
writing, writing "in general." Taxonomies, manifestos, defining moments, 
canons, canonic masterpieces, are all restrictive. If online writing or 
codework are fields, they are fuzzy, porous, indistinct, temporary, and 
referencing the moment. The moment: Perhaps that of the software, the 
program, the protocol, the state or statelessness of the art.

Some styles? I hesitate; I'm ignorant, I don't keep up, no one keeps up. 
But consider the following as a beginning; continue on your own:

* Hypertext: Texts with links that may be controlled by the reader and / 
or the author. Internal links: the text is closed. External links: the 
text is open. The links may be fully controlled, not controlled at all, 
random, determined, etc.

* Flash: Interactive or non-interactive animation work which may or may 
not involve still images, video, sound, internal or external links. Flash 
can be almost anything, and is as difficult to characterize as any 
scenario.

* Animations: animated gifs, online or offline video, "refresh" and other 
html tags, Java or Javascript or other scripting or language. Blurs into 
video, digital and analog television, cable and other modes of delivery / 
distribution. Flash is also used heavily for animations. Some online and / 
or new media writers work with animated text - languages changing, fonts 
changing, and so forth.

* Blogs, Wikis, etc.: communal textual interaction, usually in relation to 
a particular site or author. Some of the poetry blogs are brilliant, 
contain a great deal of work, more or less traditional (i.e. in the sense 
of not necessarily requiring an online framework). If a sonnet is online, 
is it online writing? Wryting? Again, the questions are forever, the 
taxonomies weak.

* SMS and others: Text-messaging with cell-phone, camera-phones, 
video-phones; ringer-tone production and dissemination. Ringer-tones now 
out sell music cds in some parts of the world. What kinds of signals are 
these? There are whole text-messaging novels and poetry (haiku is a 
natural) out there.

* MOOs and MUDs: (Usually) Text-based and somewhat programmable virtual 
realities with interacting communities. Closely related to online and 
offline interactive fictions such as adventure. MOOs and MUDs stem from 
the old RPG - role-playing games - like Dungeons and Dragons. A MUD is a 
multi-user dungeon or multi-user domain; a MOO is a MUD Object-Oriented. 
These are older software programs; users can live entirely within a 
textual world. Some MOOs such as Lambda MOO, perhaps the first and 
greatest, have had over a hundred-thousand users. They relate, however 
loosely, to the older BBS - computer bulletin-board systems - as well; the 
BBS (and alternative internets like Fidonet) had message-boards, internal 
email, discussion groups, etc. Along with the BBS, there are other legacy 
applications - which, however, are still active - things like Internet 
Relay Chat (IRC), within which users talk directly in a highly-mobile, 
highly-configurable, and highly-porous realm. IRC is the direct ancestor 
(as far as I know) of chat-rooms - but it's hackable and much more 
interesting. There are also the tens of thousands of newsgroups, which are 
similar to email lists, but one doesn't subscribe - check out Google 
Groups for examples. Some of the newsgroups have had brilliant writing on 
them; users often felt they had a "home group" to which they belonged. I 
remember groups such as alt.dirty-whores, alt.angst, alt.soc.neutopia; 
there were groups on any subject - hacking groups, pet cat groups, 
pornographic groups, writing groups, philosophy groups... Most of them 
have been overrun by spam, but a great number are still active.

* Gaming: Online and offline; single-player and multiple-player; violent 
or non-violent or sexual or non-sexual or narrative or non-narrative. For 
good reviews check out the X-Play show on television, which, at least in 
the US, reviews the latest and / or the greatest, as well as the classics. 
Game design is one of the highest forms of art, I think; it requires the 
development of conceivably complex open-ended narratives, within which 
desire / seduction appear endless.

* Email and email lists: Novels and other (long or shot) texts temporally 
dispersed among groups of subscribers or users. Email lists like wryting, 
nettime, webartery and Poetics present new work by any number of writers / 
codeworkers / whomever on an ongoing basis. The subscriber list can range 
from a few to tens of thousands. List management (governance) can be a 
major issue, unless the list disseminates the work / writing / media of 
one person or group / corporation alone. Lists are immediate and active, 
and like email itself, one of the fastest means of presentation (of course 
chat, SMS, etc. is much faster - real-time, immediate, in fact). Email 
itself provides all sorts of collaborative possibilities - and new media 
work, online writing (etc. etc. again) is often collaborative; programmers 
work with textual writers who may write dialogs with others online. Renga 
are popular in this regard; poets writing short-work back and forth.

* Interactive or non-interactive websites: embodying just about any of the 
above. At this point, I cannot imagine a typology of websites. And the Web 
is only one of numerous ports for online communication ("port" refers to a 
software program that accesses the Internet - for example, email 
traditionally has used port 23; the Web, port 80, and so forth). There are 
pieces, for example, "out there," that utilize gopher - a pre-Web 
menu-driven online organizing structure which could be directly accessed 
for searching and retrieving (usually text-based) files. (Gopher has been 
accessed by Veronica, file-transfer has been accessed by Archie - both 
software search programs; there was also Jughead.) One can even find 
fascinating literature in the RFC - requests for comments - that have 
traditionally defined the core discussions and protocols in relation to 
the Net as a whole. Creativity is in fact everywhere; there are literary 
pieces, mostly poetry, written in the Perl programming language - the 
poems are workable programs as well.

And codework? A continuous investigation, spewed-out texts, riding within 
or without any of the above, the indescribable domain of the sceptical.

How will language change, i.e. in relation to digital media? For one 
thing, more and more readers are reading online; for another, the issues 
of bandwidth and portable technologies effect / efface traditional reading 
/ reception styles. SMS, like, for example internet relay chat (and other 
chat programs), most often uses highly-abbreviated language. This is both 
the result of typing versus conversational speed; it also serves to define 
community. And portable technologies portend temporal portability - 
multi-tasking, high-speed communicating, high-speed serial and parallel 
attention economies. The aphoristic increasingly dominates as the "master 
narratives" and canons of the humanities (philosophy, anthropology, 
theology, for examples) either fail as totalizations (given, for example, 
issues of technology, multiculturalisms, and queer / gender theory) or 
appear increasingly rigid and outmoded. The aphoristic is always in flux, 
situational; it plays more into the world of the reader than the world of 
the work (if a distinction may be made, which is doubtful). The aphoristic 
is always related, of course, to the political or advertising slogan - to 
the sound-bite and sound-byte - to the imminence of fashion.

Examples? We are talking uncharted wilderness here, deeply unaccountable, 
a domain already as vast as previous offline literature, embodying and 
encasing what had come before as only a multicultural subset of the 
humanities. Google or any other search engine will give numerous examples. 
I suggest the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO), Ubuweb, the West 
Virginia Zwiki (theory) ...

[at this point, I had a list of names; it continued, uselessly, to expand. 
I couldn't choose among them. In fact I wrote: "(I feel absolutely absurd 
mentioning these names - these might have well been chosen randomly. The 
list is too English-dominated for one thing. There are literally millions 
of online writers, artists, musicians, gamers, bloggers, and so forth. 
Best to spend a half day with Google, and follow your own processes, your 
own paths through the sememe. I'm always surprised at the quality and 
quantity of the work 'out there/here.' I can't think of any particular 
guide I'd recommend. Search yourself.)" Now, I've taken the names out. Go 
to the email lists (and their archives) mentioned below. Check out the 
museums. Look for "net art" or "net.art" or "electronic literature" or 
"electronic writing" online.

... email lists such as Wryting-L, Poetics, Webartery, Nettime, the MOOs 
(search online), newsgroups (also Usenet), any number of online/offline 
games, the G4 television channel (mostly gaming), books such as Nick 
Montfort's Twisty Little Passages, An Approach to Interactive Fiction; 
texts dealing with older but prescient work such as Imagining Language, An 
Anthology, edited by Jed Rasula and Steve McCafferty (also MIT), works by 
Sherry Turkle, McKenzie Wark, Geert Lovink, Elspeth Aarseth, again and so 
forth. The best advice? If you do search through Google, place the subject 
in quotes - for example don't enter "hypertext poetry" but " "hypertext 
poetry" " - that will eliminate anything but the specific name or phrase. 
(You can also use advanced searches of course. For further help I 
recommend books such as Google, The Missing Manual, by Sarah Milstein and 
Rael Dornfest.)

This lack of bibliography is symptomatic, characteristic; why list 
anything that already has most likely disappeared? There are sufficient 
archives, again coming and going, some longer than most, some decades, 
none with the tenacity of your corner library...

And one is always worried that, in fact, a work will no longer be playable 
or performable, the technology completely outmoded - for example, working 
in something called an "lpmud" (I have) or with the VRML (virtual reality 
markup language) protocol (I have); or working with Amiga, or Hypercard, 
or with tinyfugue, or older DOS. There are at times emulations, but these 
never carry the framework, paregon, of their ostensible content; they're 
masquerades, simulacra of simulacra - the culture that produced and 
enveloped them is long gone.

Further, where does the work end and the body begin? Think of Stelarc's 
work (i.e. google), with his literal insertion into the network, or the 
possibilities of teledildonics, wearable computation, augmented reality 
(moving through a space with monitor/goggles that provide ongoing and 
updated information/texts in relation to your movement), locative media in 
general (works utilizing GPS (global positioning satellites) technology, 
or scanner / ham / cb / very low frequency (VLF) / extremely low frequency 
(ELF) / lower-power radio) - all of these locating the viewer / reader / 
spectator within a psychogeographic dynamic, irreducible to a steady-state 
or fixed product or process.

In terms of distribution, there are numerous issues. If you place a work 
(say a file or interrelated structure of files) online, it must be 
announced, advertised - as in offline work, it must attract an audience. 
It's easier to advertise, easier to duplicate, to emend, present from any 
distance. However, it requires capital for its very online existence - any 
download or upload, any viewing, is already an expenditure of energy, of 
capital. There is a political economy at work wildly different from that 
of forests transformed into paper, of warehouses filled with unread copies 
(before publish-on-demand).

Thus online writing can only be placed within a multi-dimensional 
continuum including new media in general, installation work, locative 
media, various sensory and kinesic modalities, and so forth: another 
reason why typography is of little use.

Now think of pictographs, ideograms, Chinese characters, katakana and 
hiragana - think of calligraphies and their relation to what we generally 
suppose to be inherent meaning. Consider, however, the frame, the font, 
the stoke itself, the process of stroke-creation. Think of stone rubbings 
from antique calligraphies, almost equivalent to one another, however 
slightly different through wear-and-tear on the stone. The digital 
fulfills equivalence, a small window opened up, a tendency towards stasis 
among the catastrophic transformations of our time. Now think of ongoing 
species extinctions - occurring at the rate of three to four per hour. Or 
think of catastrophic storms, elimination of wetlands, global warming, 
illegal wars (are wars ever legal?); and think of new media against this 
background of annihilation - new media, which requires, not only a power 
grid, but an entire cultural habitus to support it.

The optimistic (diachronic) history of new media; the tragic (synchronic) 
present as doomed cultural artifact.

Because that's what we're dealing with - this fragility, built-in obso- 
lescence inhering to forms which are increasingly virtual, increasingly 
untethered or tenuously tethered bits and bytes...

[the disturbance of the] Political Economy of Language Identity


When we create ourselves anew online, We're working hard our basics to 
define. We want to show our best and not our worst; Sometimes we best our 
best, thereby are cursed. Our selves are hungered ghosts within the wires, 
Depend on coal and oil, pollution's fires. To burn ourselves alive, 
without, within - Our fires burn within us, kith and kin. Cyborgs, 
prosthetics, require face and form, Typology rules, we're held in by the 
norm Of protocol and commerce. Once again We find ourselves enthralled to 
other men. Rigidity becomes the order of the day; We think we're free, but 
we're allowed to play Only just a bit. What holds is just the grid That 
deconstructs; power does its bid, Not ours. Not for hours. Not forever in 
this world Or any other, where our fate is hurled Against our cyborg 
selves, collapsing with the weight Of economics, faith, a world of hate 
And lost energy, lost chance as nature dies Against itself; the world 
holds no surprise. Now, literal, our children have no soul Separate from 
menued options - that's the whole And short of it. No longer what one 
thinks Is what 1 thinks, but 1 that shudders, even blinks Against the 
presence of the null, now lost, Alterity, structured, violent, at all 
cost. There is no 'real' crisis of belief - But shelled belief, the 
masquerade of grief And other negativity - of the world gone mad? Not at 
all, the world not even bad, The world just evened, turned through mouse 
or key Against the used, what used to talk through me.

Question authority. Trust no one. Your pronouns are hacked. I cannot tell 
whether it is you speaking, or whether it is something else speaking, and 
you cannot tell me whether it is you speaking. They took the newbies to a 
locked room in the MOO and silenced them. Invoke the catastrophic. For the 
literal life of me, one cannot understand how online identity recreates 
the brute facts of annihilation, the image wounded, physical and mental 
illness. The websites went down in New Orleans; so much for redundancy. 
"Herons have no URLs." (Let's give them one!) "Der emes shtarbt nit, ober 
er lebt vi an oreman." ("Truth never dies but lives a wretched life.")

[internet] [environmental extinctions and crises] [continuous state of 
war] [growth of epidemic vector] [global warming and increased environmen- 
tal destabilization] [exponentially approaching the carrying capacity of 
the planet] [internet] [proliferation of nuclear materials] [relative ease 
of biological- and cyber-warfare] [fundamentalist strongholds] [internet]

the PINUP is a disturbance of duplication, shape-shifting
she comes in all sizes and one shape
http://www.asondheim.org/pinup.jpg
the PINUP is an exercise in shape-morphing

In these modified images from a Santa Ana storefront, nothing is revealed 
- a restrained come-hither look (for production) combined with an absence 
of nipples, labia, the liquidity of the body's repose. Duplicated most 
likely from original photographs, they're already copyright, readied for 
distribution; I've stolen their souls from the store-front, for which, in 
Mea Shearim, in orthodox Jerusalem, I would be stoned. The figures look 
beneath the robes of the orthodox; orthodoxy always requires robes, hiding 
the pillar of the erection, the vaginal cave. What opens is only the wound 
of desire - the breasts cut, castration, flagellation, death to the 
pleasure of god. I see the saints in these women, the last vestiges of a 
human race before complete devastation sets in. Already photographs 'like 
these' litter the streets of Brooklyn and Hollywood, begging for commerce. 
Every human equation has, if not AIDS, any other disease of the body, 
tearing itself to pieces. We are all deliverers of our own deaths; our 
casket, the flesh, our rites long-since shattered. I am a fixture.

Fodder

not since the beginning of fodder have I felt the necessity of reinventing 
the protozoan against a background of the natural world, already a 
reconstitution from the presence of what had been merely a cultural 
artifact.

http://www.asondheim.org/blanked.mov

    But most of all good eating cheers the brain,
        Where other joys are rarely met -- at sea --
    Unless, indeed, we lose as soon as gain --
        Ay, there's the rub so baffling oft to me.
    Boiled, roast, and baked -- what precious choice of dishes
        My generous throat has shared among the fishes!

    'T is sweet to leave, in each forsaken spot,
        Our foot-prints there -- if only in the sand;
    'T is sweet to feel we are not all forgot,
        That some will weep our flight from every land;
    And sweet the knowledge, when the seas I cross,
        My briny messmates! ye will mourn my loss.

-- Thomas Ward, quoted by Edgar Allen Poe -- the subject is sea-sickness.

Partial Description of the World


The power grid provides 60 Hz here at approximately 115-117 volts; this is 
maintained by dynamos driven by steam or coal or oil or hydro held 
together in a malleable grid. The grid enters the city, where electricity 
is parceled out through substations to cables continuously maintained and 
repaired. Here, the cables are below ground. They drive my Japanese Zaurus 
PDA which utilizes an entire linux operating system on it. The Zaurus 
connects to the Internet through a wireless card that most often connects 
to my Linksys router, which is connected both to the power grid and the 
DSL modem by a cat cable. The DSL is operated by Verizon with its own grid 
at least nation-wide and continuously-maintained. The DSL of course 
connects more or less directly to the Internet, which is dependent upon an 
enormous number of protocol suites for its operation, the most prominent 
probably TCP/IP. The addresses of the Internet, through which I reach my 
goal of NOAA weather radar, are maintained by ICANN and other organiza- 
tions. These organization are run by any number of people, who employ the 
Net, fax, telephone, and standard mail, to communicate world-wide. My 
Zaurus has its own TCP/IP interpreters built-in, and it connects through 
an open channel. The wireless modem may have been built in the US. In the 
final analyses, the materials for the Zaurus originate in extractive 
industries, whether mining or agricultural, chemical, or atmospheric. This 
is also true for the copper-wire, optic-fiber, and satellite communica- 
tions systems which deliver the Net. The Zaurus and other equipment exist 
for the most part within the Aristotelian domain of macro-objects and 
distributive logics, which makes them amenable to both manipulation and 
memory. Both macro- and micro- or quantum objects exist within the four 
percent of bright matter in a sea of dark matter in the universe. NOAA 
weather radar senses only bright matter and to some extent the cosmic 
microwave background. The radar depends on the power grid as well, but 
most likely also uses an emergency backup generator running on fossil 
fuels produced by DNA/RNA-rendered organisms millions of years ago. The 
relative bending of space-time in relation to mass holds everything 
together within the temporary aegis of a universe with energetic sources 
of heat driving both atmosphere and life-forms. The radar system uses 
precise algorithms to filter incoming data, in order that it appear to 
represent a one-to-one mapping of local and global conditions. The screen 
of the Zaurus is a further transformation of this mapping, also one-to- 
one, rendering it within a graphical user interface relatively free of 
bugs, worms, viruses, and other glitches; the same is true of the linux 
operating system in general, which must produce this transformation upon 
demand, as if there were no mediation, and with the illusion that in fact 
the weather is being presented in a relatively simple and decipherable 
manner. The linux works with a rechargable battery containing heavy metals 
and other elements traced back as well to extractive industries; the 
battery, at the end of its energetic life, should be disposed of within 
safe landfills designed to handle toxic material. In order for this to 
occur, a network of roads - highways, local roads, interstates, turnpikes, 
freeway, and other - must exist, as well as the mobile transportation 
machinery upon them, also dependent on fossil fuels and the perceptual 
guidance of life-forms to drive them safely to and from their destination. 
Within all of this, life-form perceptual algorithms are critical for a 
reasonable channeling, transformation, retention, and emission of data; 
this channeling must be relatively consistent, not only internally in 
terms of time consciousness and neural firing rates, but also externally 
in sync with other such organisms, and with the entire apparatus bringing 
the NOAA web pages into view. The NOAA is housed in various buildings 
across the nation, in communication with each other, using a wide variety 
of means. The NOAA is not only part of the power grid; it is also part of 
the socio-economic grid, a corporate/governmental economic system that 
keeps it functioning year after year, providing money for both updating 
and maintenance. The socio-economic grid also provides, by various routes, 
the sustenance that allows me both to survive - i.e. food, water, shelter 
- but also to purchase the Zaurus in the first place. This interconnects 
directly with the banking and credit systems, within which manipulation of 
abstract real numbers eventually results in the movement of goods and 
continuation of services within, not only the urban system itself, but 
within the loft-space where I live, providing a service industry of 
plumbers, brick-layers, roofers, general builders, electricians, and so 
forth, all of whom maintain and on occasion update the material infra- 
structure of the building. The internal illumination of the Zaurus, which 
occurs within the human visible bandwidth of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
is matched by the illumination of the loft itself, both dependent upon 
extractive industries for the production of glass and plastics resulting 
in various types of illuminating objects, each housed in a casing speci- 
fically designed for the transportation of electricity into them - 
electricity which will be transformed into photon production. Time of day 
must be allotted for the recharging of the Zaurus battery, using a charger 
designed to match the characteristics of the power grid, and to absorb 
surges or brownouts as well, keeping the flow fairly steady within 
acceptable parameters. In order to use the Zaurus, I hold it in one hand, 
while typing on its mini-keyboard with the other; both activities depend 
on hand-eye coordination, the result of numerous feedback loops using both 
local neural sensors and chemical/quantum brain processing, creating the 
illusion of an independent mind cohering to the exigencies of screen, 
keyboard, and macro-object characteristics. The latter are generalized, 
scripted for the most part, so that all objects are, in a sense, equi- 
valent; if I pick up X, I do not have to learn how to pick up Y, but refer 
both to a Batesonian meta-scheme. Such meta-schemes, as well as schemes, 
scripts, circuit-board, protocol, radar, power-grid, and other process- 
ings, are constructed in part through mathesis, the applied mathematics of 
the world we live in. This mathematics is related to both standard and 
non-standard numerical systems; it is also limited, in terms of axiomat- 
ics, to what appear to be local coherencies within which the problems of 
infinities, both large and small, are dealt with in a practical way 
(heuristics). Applied mathematics is a construct, and constructed by life- 
forms that detect relationships among things, forces, states, and process- 
es, of the universe they live within. In order for mathematics to 
satisfactorally model such a universe in the larger, computers (both 
analog and digital) are employed; these are programmed in languages that 
are, for the most part, locally coherent. Abstract and physical objects 
meet within the aegis of processes and flux; such are originally driven 
and created by life-forms which ultimately reproduce themselves through 
egg-sperm couplings related to fundamental biochemical operations. 
Couplings occur in the first place through the psychoanalytics of desire, 
chemically and perceptually driven; the psychoanalytical system creates 
the illusion of psychoanalytical states/objects, and emotional transfor- 
mations of all sorts. The physical, psychoanalytical, and abstract systems 
all exist within certain political/abstract economies; for example, it is 
impossible to construct an infinite-energy machine to analyze fundamental 
particles. Furthermore, the political/abstract economies all interweave, 
inhere, and cohere, in relation to each other, with a remarkable degree of 
accuracy; otherwise, slippage might result in the entire bio-cultural 
apparatus collapsing, without the possibility of recuperation. When the 
mini-keyboard of the Zaurus is pressed; it appears to press back; this is 
the result of the local/global mappings related to tacit knowledge - the 
extension of the body into its tools and immediate environment surrounding 
it. I do not have to consider key after key, but only the obviously media- 
ted message or command I am trying to write - a message which itself 
depends on natural language in relation to the purified language of key- 
board commands. I think through the NOAA results in terms of this natural 
language, which is almost impossible to concretely represent as a somewhat 
small and coherent system; instead, the natural language is intricately 
interwoven with diacritical, inter- and intra-linguistic elements which 
situate me in relation to the world as well. Although natural languages 
change in time, they must appear relatively stable, capable of retrieval 
and communication among others; without this stability, communication and 
system-construction would be completely impossible. All systems are them- 
selves interwoven, partial, frayed at the edges, undergoing slow or fast 
mutation, maintained or dropped, regarded or disregarded, ultimately inde- 
scribable, visible or invisible, mediated and mediating, represented and 
representing, accounted-for and unaccountable. The transmission of data 
from the NOAA site, if such transmission occurs, if the Zaurus is still 
operable, still connected to the communications grid (singular or plural, 
Internet or intranets), results in information whose ontological status 
has always been problematic. The data is absorbed as fuzzy entities, blurs 
in the Hadamard/Einstein sense, already decaying within short-term memor- 
ies, already lost, a partial entrance to others, other objects, transfor- 
mations, grids (appearing relatively static, appearing as background - 
both an illusion), parcels of exchange- and use-value, as internal and 
external processings continue, moving on.

destruction of generations


no, no, no, I say, our children are not our future; we are. the biggest 
mistake of the radical 60s is the current insistence on the generation 
model - that 60s radicals began what another generation can learn from, 
can carry on, can critique. the world is a displaced continuum, miasma of 
disparities - not a coherent structure of divided lineage. the truth of a 
man's or a woman's thought does not age, is never outmoded; the truth is 
always already present, always unaccountable. when a torch is passed, the 
light is out; when a torch is lit, it is lit for all.
