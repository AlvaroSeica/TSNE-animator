Some Thoughts on the Internet Text


The following pieces are culled from the Internet Text, a project I have 
been working on since 1994. Every day I write one or more sections. The 
Text examines cyberspace, being online, social media, codework, virtual 
worlds, and so forth. It uses a variety of methods and styles, ranging 
from experimental poetics to academic theory. There are also thousands of 
URLs of visual or audio files that augment the written word. Most of these 
files have been taken down (there simply isn't enough storage for all of 
them simultaneously; the Text stands on its own without them. 

At this point, the Text is probably well over twenty thousand pages. So 
the following are descriptions, culled from the past seventeen years, of 
what the whole thing is about. This (highly edited) collection is the 
foundation of a talk I'll give at the ELO (Electronic Literature Organi- 
zation), this June in Providence. I hope the material is useful to those 
who won't be there as well.

INTERNET TEXT - preliminary

INTERNET TEXT is a meditation on the philosophy, psychology, poli-
tical economy, and psychoanalytics of Internet (computer) communica-
tion. It describes the phenomenology of the "electronic subject," 
the user who is plugged into the computer as a correspondent or
researcher. It is dedicated to Michael Current, my co-moderator on
the Cybermind list, who passed away recently.

The text is divided into eight sections, labeled Net1-8; the sections
are also given the following titles:

Net1: Internet Text, approx. 82k
Net2: Love on the Net, approx. 84k
Net3: Web Text, approx. 89k
Net4: Clara Text, approx. 86k
Net5: Singularities Text, approx. 86k
Net6: Secret Text, approx. 82k
Net7, Net 8: approx. 82k each.

The first three texts form a core volume; the first text forms a core
volume. These develop an analysis of the Net based on protocol, spew,
emission, recognition, address, imaginary, murmur, and the uncanny.
The texts should be read in order; only the first section of the first
text is in traditional form, however. (It should be returned to as a
continuous REWRITE of itself and the others.) 

The last five texts open up, encompassing other areas as well. The
fourth includes work on "the last science fiction story," for example,
and the fifth includes work on projection/introjection in relation to
"real" correspondents on BBS, email, lists, and Usenet. Parts of the
final texts deal with death, hacking, and the "stuttering" of Net
communication.

All texts have been written as ASCII files; there are graphics, how-
ever, that can be generated by running the several qbasic programs 
given in the files.

I envision Internet Text as a single work. The style can be difficult
at times, and the format changes radically at times, from one section
to another. But style and format reflect content, a rapidly spreading
and relatively new form of communication on the planet. (Incidentally,
much of the analysis applies to telephony as well.) I envision the
reader as self-generating, as if the texts were a form of inner voice.
What I am attempting is also relatively new; bear with the texts, and
they will prove rewarding.

Keywords: These connect: address, recognition, protocol, electronic
subject, grain, spew, emission, murmur, exhausiton, obdurate, uncanny,
imaginary, projection/introjection, _chora_, devouring, liquidity,
bridge, pipeline, node, transitivity, gesture, web and web inversion.

Usage: The texts may be distributed in any medium - indeed, I urge you
to do so - provided I am credited with authorship. I would appreciate
in return any comments you may have.

The Beginning Section of the Internet Text Revisited


The following text begins the Internet Text as a whole. At the time, I
didn't know what I was getting into, a text that would eventually reach
over a twelve hundred pages to date. In any case, this was written several
months after signing on, and I am using this end-of-the-year occasion to
revisit it, identify its strengths and weaknesses... 


INTERNET TEXT


0. Prolegomena: The following iterative construct describes the internet.
Traditional philosophical and cultural categories are highly problematic,
given this new communications life-form. I develop instead an analysis
based on EMISSION, SPEW, ADDRESS, RECOGNITION, and PROTOCOL. The essay,
always preliminary, proceeds through a series of numbered paragraphs,
which then rewrite. 

[REWRITE becomes a major concept later on, the continuous reiteration of
identity on the Net through text - the constant statement of name and
place.]

1. The network is a membrane composed of nodes, better considered intensi-
fications. An intensification possesses an interactive emission. The
emission is characterized as a program space composed of inputs/outputs,
introjections/projections: a space of -jectivity. The emission occurs in a
steep topographic region; distinctions between hardware and software
become blurred, as do more traditional philosophical divisions (subject/
object, body/world, mind/brain). 

[The membrane analog easily segued into issues of bodies. Intensification
characterizes the Net; in combination with emission, it constitutes a
message sending and receiving 'spew.' The blurring of distinctions be-
tween hardware and software also become a major theme later on - the idea
of information/programming all the way down, and the difficulties this
spells for traditional ontological distinctions. This is the one proble-
matic addressed by soviet philosophy that still remains unresolved, edgy.]

2. In fact, traditional ontological considerations are clearly replaced by
an organic episteme; what constitutes knowledge is only flow; data repla-
ces history; data becomes sourceless. Rather than communication channels,
consider geodesics; rather than geodesics, consider forced flows; rather
than forced flows, consider emissions. 

[Data is sourceless because data can be manipulated, is addressible.]

3. An emission has no input, no output; an emission consists of fragmented
images, the symbolic replaced by the imaginary. An emission is always in
flux; an emission problematizes energy and energy consumption, since it
may simultaneously drain and produce/reproduce. An emission is a chaotic
domain in the vicinity of an unstable attractor; escaping, it quickly
loses history, historiography, temporality itself. Close to the speed of
light, it exists in a temporal well. 

[Now here is a blurring of TCP/IP//user distinctions. But the notion of
the imaginary is critical to the Net - which begins always with the sym-
bolic, in an inversion that would do Marx/Hegel proud. With emission and
the imaginary, historiography replaces history. Later I will critique
temporality itself flooding the wires.]

4. The membrane is an enormous hypertext whose linkages thin, occasionally
break, are always redundant. It is neither a fuzzy set nor a classical
one; through a fast-forward topology, it escapes traditional partitioning.
The user deals with an alterity in the form of constantly changing facial
expressions; one is never within or without the alterity, but in a (su-
pine) position of absorption. The emission clouds close to me; ontologica-
lly, it is that real escaping denotation; ontologically, it is uncanny.
Thus the emission is related to excess, to surplus, to the curlicue or
diacritical mark, but it absents these, and it is this absenting or
ignorance that constructs the uncanny as waste-product; the blindness of
emission is its site. 

["Facial expressions" is unclear at this point; I am not sure of the do-
main I was referring to. This alterity is what I later called hysteric
embodiment, the projection beyond or through the text onto an image of
the other - face, tone of voice, intention, "authenticity." Bataille and
Deleuze-Guattari are at work here.]

5. To hold onto part of a body, to sever that part, to construe or re-
construe that part, to devour it, tear the surface off: one searches for
the skinned body, (which has the murmur or memory of pain), the articu-
lation of a truth given by one's own body lost in the emission. It is good
form to search out bondage, which restrains the body absent from itself,
an analog of the screen or permissive membrane which occurs, going just so
far. This is an antiquated ontology or materiality asserting the inert in
the midst of fast-forward, an assertion doomed to be displaced, sublima-
ted, effaced; one holds onto nothing; as in classical existentialism, one
projects forward in the face of nothingness (as if nothing were itself an
alterity);  the hole, however, is an episteme broken by the screen replac-
ing the mirror stage; the ego splatters against it (the cum-ego for female
and male); fast-forward, the episteme always already announces its contin-
uation; the existentialist project is lost in the midst of indirect ad-
dresses. 

[Suddenly the body appears, holds its own. Bodies in fact constitute the
Net, articulated bodies, described bodies, hysteric bodies, isolated or
frozen bodies, scientific bodies, bodies of scientists, students, users,
doctors, the disabled, home-bodies, bodies of management, sexual and
sexing bodies, ignored bodies, speaking bodies, all bodies bound to the
screen or speaker, bound to the text, bound to the other of reading, bound
to inner speech.]

6. The user is an addict "in the midst";  the user projects; thwarted,
projects again. The membrane appears in the guise of discarded pornog-
raphy; one is thrust into pure consumption, no longer beneath the guise of
another pornography, capital itself. Assertions are lost in the echo of
the machine. Thought is defined by flux, by an absolute symbolic for the
user who must be assured of the purity of his or her drug. The purity is
in the form of a well-definition (in the logical sense) to which no one
any longer pays attention; the absence of well-definition does not result
in a program cancellation, but only a retry which is part of the program
itself; it does not matter where one is; location is irrelevant. 

[Later I would revise this, which is all too simple, wayward. Addiction
is complex, like schizophrenia; associated with a _singular object_ (drug,
sex, etc.), it constructs at the least an Oedipal psychological framework
for the subject. On the Net, what I am calling here (later abandoning) as
addiction, is also tied into identity politics and psychoanalytics - some-
thing covered at length in the later portions of the text. I would also
disagree that there is an "absolute" symbolic at work here or any other
place; it exists as a projection, but the symbolic itself may be decon-
structed.]

7. Voices are heard behind the screen words (toggle on, echo on; the
screen chants itself, hides itself, reveals the nipple); face to face
replaces the face; double blinds allow the truth of double binds. This is
the only truth there is: that which occurs beneath or behind the blind,
that is, the lie (which is truth's double, truth's mirror, not converse or
inverse) (which is truth's perverse, that is, truth's abject truth); this
is the framework of classical Greek philosophy bound to classical Greek
torture (both bound with identical cords, hieroglyphs): Xenophon's Socra-
tes was the first user. Voices are heard, and voices are nothing but
machine chatter, the ideal forms so many subroutines... 

[And machine chatter is the dreaming of machines, machine-dreams as well,
desiring-machines literalized - but also the dreaming of bodies, body-
dreams as well, desiring bodies literalized...]

8. The user. The user is an addict; the user inscribes throughout the
network (temporary, electronic, absolute: an entirely new category), mic-
rotendrils extending in every direction. This contains the appearance of
power; the network is a fantasm reflecting emissions back through local
paths. The wonder of the internet is its locality, the construct of neigh-
borhood (packet channels slowing down just right for the home terminal)
redefining the body; the body becomes extension; extension becomes noise;
noise seethes at the edge. The process is one of fast-forward rooting, and
the roots are blind. 

[The user as addict, again, the text addicted to addiction. Later the net-
work becomes stasis, environment, ghost, network _as_ fantasm transformed
into fantasm-network, fantasm-producing. Blind roots, yes; the tendrils
skitter across the planet - skittering, too, develops later as the sub-
ject's reception, trajectories across floodplains, Reynold's numbers.]

9. Now we can speak of the mouth or eye of the user; now we can speak of
the hand or its mobility. No matter how (much) sensation is transcribed,
it occurs at a distance characterized by zapping and invasions. Nothing
but the materiality of the body is a stake; everything cuts everything
off. The user is confined to a scientism in the form of THAT which arti-
culates the THERE IS, just as addiction develops out of the action of a
particular drug or behavioral sequence. One is tied to the THAT. 

[This lead to the simultaneous prosthesis and cauterization of the body,
the body edged, on the precipice. What is at stake is nothing more or less
than the _future_ - future future, but also future present, future past.]

10. The user has nothing to do with the internet; the user is of no con-
sequence. Conference exists or dissolves beneath the sign, not of gender
or capital, but of chaotic inscription.  The sign itself dissolves; sign
is, after all, only recognition. This is the final corruption of humanism;
even the self is no longer centric - not through the Lacanian inscriptive/
linguistic unconscious (through which IT may still find a path or coagula-
tion), but through addiction, self as THAT, or self as nodal intensifica-
tion, always castrated, furiously addictive, always reading/writing, al-
ways rewriting: the self becomes its own recursivity. It no longer mat-
ters; its reports are from marauders, vandals, on the edge of the Roman
Empire; it exists only within the interstices of power; it is displaced by
power; it is no longer one or many; it no longer responds to the pronoun;
it responds only to the login which may well (it does not matter) be a
construct of the machine itself - just as gender-bending relies no longer
on gender, but arbitrary and chaotic signifiers, signifiers undercut, in a
continuous process of dissolution, murmuring, forgetting, forgotten, forg-
ed and forgotten, emissive. The machine recognizes no gender; the machine
recognizes nothing. The machine recognizes every gender; the machine is
never a machine, but an episteme. 

[Beneath the surface, neutralization is uncanny because unapproachable
although immanent. The Internet Text from this point on develops the
surface, produces the subject criss-crossed by this form of subterranean
knowledge, which is hardly a displacement or effacement, simply a condi-
tion of the protocols and their subjects hungry for meaning.]

11. Just as the episteme is lost in time, so is the subject; just as music
video and popular culture announced (by absenting, forgetting, by asigni-
fying) the end of historicity, the subject no longer announces itself (and
certainly no longer announces herself and himself): an emission is no
grounds for announcement. In this manner the subject avoids death (always
the plan, thwarted and perverting, procuring and devouring, but always the
plan) which is already always forgotten; intensification is subject to
dissolution, but subjectivity dissipates or sublimates elsewhere, as if it
ever existed. 

[Subjectivity dissipates, but the subject _does_ announce itself, although
_the subject_ is no longer announced; recognition and address are, in
fact, the precise forms of this announcement. Within the digital domain,
the organic hope of continuous life is fulfilled; the world is forever
reproducible just as digital video can be copied, generation after genera-
tion, without loss. What skitters, loses through friction, heat. The
depths are immobilized, ice. It's not even a necessary precondition that
the Net physically exist; everything ties to GIGO in spite of distributed
intelligence and entities - what goes in is representation which appears
permanent. It's left for the real to be granular, chaotic, excessive,
unregulated, idiotic, obdurate; it's left for the real to produce the
subject of the Internet text, produce the subject no longer announced.]

12. But just as if it ever existed, there are no longer ontological con- 
siderations; as plasma, the internet bypasses existence (always already... 
the litany repeats as murmur). It is within this that the projected 
eternality of the digital has full reign or resonance; noiseless, the 
digital proclaims the clean and proper body (which is rendered problematic 
by the maternal which becomes uncanny, fantasm, the circulation already on 
the move, already elsewhere), genderless and absent. Clearly in this 
fashion, everything is absent within the internet. (Everything announces, 
dresses, addresses. A character, screen or otherwise, is an announcement.) 
The human dream of eternal life occurs by a draining of temporality; 
therefore nothing occurs or can occur. It is irrelevant whether or not the 
human is "ready" for this when readiness implies an a priori teleology; 
such an impulse becomes a trail or trace left by a gopher through the 
computational/server holarchy, not an end in sight or sightlessness.

[Oh we are a miracle.]

13. Naturally, then, it is also irrelevant to ask where one goes from 
here...

[But the text continued through another 700 texts to date, a flood of
text, inter/texts, veering from the subject but always tethered to her or
him, continuous desperate disparate attempts. And this introductory text
itself proceeded through several other texts, all found at the beginning
of net1.txt, at the jefferson.village.virginia.edu site. Yours for the
taking.]

This work is a continuation of the investigations of Internet Text,
which is available in three files: Internet Text, Love on the Net,
and Web Text. Clara Text wanders; its dominion is nomadic. Issues of
communication, desire, and the absolute are paramount. Horror and
beauty appear.

INTERNET TEXT partial summary


"Au voile qui la ceint absente avec frissons"  (Mallarme)

I address the problem of ELECTRONIC SUBJECTIVITY by virtue of several
threads, all concurrent. I continue this addressing, each thread
writing and rewriting the text, a continuous-production or discourse
against the grain.

The GRAIN, GRANULARITY, is a physical reality both classical and
quantum-mechanical, a physical reality whose appearance is that of the
grain: letters on a bleak field, the grains of granite and
photographic film, beach-sand, the granularity of the retina itself.

The SUBJECT "au voile" or VEILED SUBJECT is defined by ADDRESS
(location, without which the subject no longer exists); RECOGNITION
(the activated ADDRESS opening and closing channels of communication);
PROTOCOL (the syntactic structure of communication); and REWRITE (a
continuous-production or reiteration of the subject, a flood or
EMISSION of the symbolic). 

The EMISSION is a signifying; a SPEW is a symbol-dump, noisy and
granular, referencing the real exterior, transforming the interior
into an abject. EMISSION and SPEW are communicative occasions whose
analog is the set of GENERALIZED MEASURE GEOMETRIES, always but not
quite symmetrical, always reiterative. The Net diffuses and collapses,
differentiates and integrates, transforming smooth into semantic or
inscribed space, and back again.

The ontology of the Net is UNCANNY, an absenting or problematic
alterity; within the UNCANNY, FANTASM appears, the introjection/
projection (-JECTIVITY or the THROWN, DASEIN) of narratologies and
ACTANTS, "persons," neither present nor absent; these may be
ELECTRONIC SUBJECTS themselves, or a constructed IMAGINARY transmitted
and diffused. NARRATOLOGIES are the collapse of NET DISCOURSE into
remaindered patterns; the opposite is the MURMUR or STUTTER, the
irruption of "frissons" everywhere and nowhere at all. The imaginary
is addictive; Net users become USERS, circulating around specificities
fetishized from emissions, a collapse into the lure of the UNCANNY.
Here, POWER is what passes for POWER. If addiction is the obsessive-
compulsive neurosis of the net, WEB INVERSION is the psychosis,
transforming the body into its exterior, and its exterior into flesh
burned into the Internet itself, wires laid across the skin, the skin
speaking the hieroglyph of imaginary usage.

The DIGITAL DOMAIN is the dominion of eternal life, the dominion of
eternal REWRITE; information is never lost from generation to
generation, but always repeated and repeated absolutely. This is the
dominion of the clean and proper body, the introjection of burnt wires
producing always already a simulacrum of life guaranteeing continuous
discourse. There is no death; DASEIN becomes EMISSION itself. The
SCREEN is the only TERMINAL OPERATION; the screen becomes the EGO or
gateway, the surface of the addictive user. Everything is PERFECTION.
TRUTH and FACTICITY are occurrences, since truth tables are decided
only by ASCII or other decoding/encoding matches. What is true is
present. And what is true is also BEAUTIFUL since perfect and
perfectly clean, always a symmetry or lure.

The GREAT BEYOND is the horizon of the Internet, always farther,
always increasing circulations of the planet which short-circuit or
circumvent. At the edge of the GREAT BEYOND one finds the BLIND 
PASSWORD "absente" beyond which is a null-set or zero file. ONTOLOGY
itself is absent; epistemology is viral, transformative. Nothing is
certain and nothing circulates.

PROPER NAMES circulate throughout the Net, the promise of TRUTH or
BEAUTY, the promise of emission. Such names are FANTASMS; every
possible world is every possible Net world in a continuous morph, and
every KIND is simultaneously a NATURAL and UNNATURAL kind. Thus TRUTH
is each and every occurrence, and who is to say that FALSEHOOD is not
the same? What is neither this nor that is foundation, gestural,
within and without the GREAT BEYOND, UNCANNY. The TERMINAL becomes
retinal but anonymous. Names MURMUR forever, lose identity. NAMES
never had identity to begin with.

The POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE NET constructs a class-consciousness
fuelled by reification-tendencies; everything is reification.
Teleology is defined by a FUTURE IMPERFECT in which reification
constitutes the IDENTITY OF THE SUBJECT ITSELF.

The FUTURE from the exterior results in the LAST SCIENCE FICTION STORY
in which the subject confronts the GREAT BEYOND. Narrative itself
disappears, replaced by PERFECTION. LIFE, once defined by MODULARITY,
has become SUBSTANCE, a REWRITE of the same into the same. 

"Rien, cette ecume, vierge vers" (Mallarme)

PREPOSTEROUS JUSTIFICATION


Perhaps because of the very nature of my work, I find it necessary to 
clarify what I am attempting to accomplish, nothing less than the 
establishment of a new approach to the humanities and the gist of the old 
characterology which has remained inviolate ever since the Biblical era. 
One moves from one place to another; the movements are tracked across 
the skies or earth or wires accompanied by an inviolate proper name, 
alias, generic name, or subterfuge.

The wires, however, are a ruptured transformation, once beyond the accre 
tion of the telephone switchboard, a new beginning of address DISCONNECT 
INVISIBLE. Then it was only the grain of the voice which mattered and 
which constituted the guarantee of authenticity; now, on the hinge of 
ASCII, it is nothing whatsoever that creates an equivalent condition. 
Without the guarantee, anything is possible; one exists within a chaotic 
and inderminate domain, writing to nothing in particular - in spite of the 
existence of domains, and writing only as a form of address and 
recognitions...

Ah, but what is tracked, carried on one's nomadic back? And what is the 
back in relation to the front of the animal, sensory nub utilized only for 
the purpose of the garnering of visual data and its transformations? We 
exist in the world of double encodings, and this is already a future 
rushed ahead of one, plunging us headlong into streams of hysteria and 
darkness. Yes, I have been criticized for the hysteria and neuroticism of 
my texts, but these are in fact the bases for the transformation of the 
human, like it or not. The debate between humanism and post-structuralism, 
for example, fades insofar as the body is problematic, my body, your body, 
in a state of existence elsewhere and elsewhen. Encompass the dark!

The Internet Text began simply enough with a series of numbered proposi- 
tions, but then emendations became necessary, channeling further into the 
interstices, until a general rewrite was the only option. I could go no 
farther; suddenly the body appeared in Nipple. Txt cutting through the 
generalized hypothesis: What are my texts if not contradictory? How else 
could they survive in the midst of alt.fetish.net.noise? Didn't this 
continue through a representation of Spew itself, the exhaustion of the 
number system devolving into broken symmetries? And in the next several 
texts, everything was developed in relation to desire, the body, the 
granularity of the real in relation to etiquette and protocol itself. At a 
loss, stumbling through the hallucinatory forms of part-objects, surplus 
or excess as a character-"pass" or the blocking that ensued from a 
password entrance into a STALLED OR NULL CHAMBER.

And the texts constantly stalled in a maze of their own devising - stall- 
ing, reiterating, redirecting, turning around like a blind Unix file 
deadending into an inaccessible account. Meanwhile the surface continued 
its activity of WRITE REWRITE WRITE REWRITE, my fingers hovering above the 
tumescent keyboard, a sense of _frisson_ lending itself further and 
further to a WEB-INVERSION, the body hanging thread-like from the wires 
themselves, connecting and dis- connecting, a vast atmospheric 
switchboard.

The theses continued to break up, disparate - continued to dissolve on 
MEANDER. I took pains to point out that distinction between this and the 
nomadic - the latter, after all, possessing a map of sorts, a wandering 
throughout an uncomfortable terrain, but always a sense of place even 
within the smoothest of regions. But here the territory continues, like 
Ciudad Juarez in the physical world, to extend without bounds, an influx 
on the level of the exponential with no end in sight. I would return, 
retreat to myself; I would transform Spew into EMISSION, organizing and 
reorganizing the material which were a continuous meditation or 
commentary. And I would argue as well that this is the _only philosophical 
praxis possible_ given the fast-forward fragments of the human.

At times there would be a fountain of exaltation or the dark rupture of 
murderous despair - all comfortably theorized, placed in linear and 
distributed tablets. The howling became a user-therapeutic for a reader in 
tune with what I had to say; the despair translated into comfort and 
collusion.

The tablets would carry back to Inanna or other Sumerian figures, 
inscribed as well with the protocol hidden from sight by the tablet 
embrochure foreclosed against the violation of the flesh. Would I not 
write concerning the operations upon the flesh, Emily Dickinson, by an 
establishment I have long admired? Write about the accompanying murmur, 
the unremarkable dissolution-death of one or another nameless nation 
descending into pillage and gang warfare?

Engorged, I exhaled ASCII; instead of tears or whimpers, my fingers move 
faster, uncontrolled; they carry the weight of my body's desire. The texts 
are always already the manipulation of flesh, the stuffy of uneasy dreams 
without sound or image, silent strata of darkened mountains collapsing 
into still more silent darkened pools.

Engorged, I inhaled as well, circulations and responses from everywhere in 
the world, enveloping the body of text, circumambulating through newer 
dreams, through dream-admixtures. The theory is the breath of a manifold, 
torn and sleazy, the hysteric encompassing collapsing on empty air.

There are needles everywhere, however, pointed responses and heady 
constructs, hypotheses of all sorts, the glimmer of comprehension in the 
form of a luminescent deep-see angler-fish, barely visible in the gloom. 
Her antenna scouts the shores of further waters; parasitic headless males 
flail uselessly, permanently attached to her body. This is the SPS, 
sperm-production-sac, the shedding of the head for the body. This is the 
permission of theory, continuation of one or another form of the written, 
holding on to the final picture posited by the repression of the real and 
its return.
===================================================================


CAN'T STOP WRITING / NO CAN'T STOP WRITING / CAN'T STOP WRITING /
MYSELF

CAUSE I DO THEORY MALE CAUSE I DO THEORY / CAUSE I DO THEORY MAIL /
CAUSE IT'S DONE TO ME 


I write and write; there is no end to it. The files pile up at the rate of 
a megabyte a year, enormous files, ASCII, linear, although not without a 
certain tendentious quality... They are belly, language-fat, collapsed 
body or hidden body as they grow beyond belief.

This is what I _do_, from late morning rising to equally late night 
preparing for fitful sleep. This is what keeps me going, the body decaying 
beneath me, flesh falling off as the wires heat up. And the wires heat up. 
(The flesh falls, blood between my legs. I'll get back to this, back to 
the blood; I'll write with the blood, get back to this.)

The wires heat up because there is nothing else for me, nothing but the 
_spit of meaning_ my work occasions, disturbance of the ether. I know 
nothing but the inhabitation of my thought, this continuous meditation 
that lacerates me, cuts unequivocally. (It's not the cut that bleeds the 
legs, swoon/languor/lassitude, something else: it's _something else._)

You are the edge of the written, the circumscription that presents the 
exteriority of the skull. This body meets itself in death; there may no 
longer be this body which is a writing-machine by virtue of a written 
declaration. I have lost my arms and legs. I have lost my eyes and ears. 
(I'll get back to this, back to myself.)

Theory is hideous, an addiction; I cannot live without REMAKE, REWRITE. 
The shifter shifts from _I_ to the entire passage itself, everything a 
violent and sickening announcement, signalled by uncontrollable dejection. 
My tongue leaves the body; I am left with arms. My arms leave my tongue; 
my legs carry the body, one or another direction, violent meander.

I would do what you tell me to, everything you want, everything you could 
possibly desire, but I do not exist. There are no words to describe it. (I 
rip myself open, spread the ass rim until the split opens up into the 
holing of _this text_, WRITING me back into cartoon me returned to where I 
began with the splitting.) [...]


POOR THOUGHT

Given the current world information and economic order, radicalized 
intellectuality has nowhere to go. Marxism, terminated from within, 
remains a residue of a once sceptical enterprise; Heideggerianism, with 
its exhausted poetics, becomes a last resort, the conjunction of 
irrelevant humanities with the defensive maneuvers of a dying but 
impervious language.

Thinking, always organized around the horizon of the catastrophic, 
dissipates by virtue of _too much thought,_ idiosyncratic local sites 
which necessarily turn in upon themselves, mirror-stages to their own 
implosion. From within the Hole, the contraction is never in evidence, 
until perhaps violent events in the world at large create a sufficient 
disturbance, with all the markings of death, violent and organic.

With this in mind, a re-examination of subjectivity must retreat from its 
own positioning, the harboring of completion under any other name. It is 
not that eidetic reduction and the bracket no longer exist; it is that 
they exist everywhere, constructing inconceivable micro-territories as 
ASCII or GIF codes - they make no _differance_.

If subjectivity exists throughout, or interpenetrates, "recognition, 
address, protocol," then the subject is at a loss within the noise of the 
empire of communications (EC). _Nowhere_ within this scheme is the subject 
_represented_; the voice, granular or not, is silenced, transferring 
laterally the EC itself into the domain of neural networking.

This is a serious flaw in an otherwise fascinating theory; if Internet 
text abjures the tradition of the subject to such an extent, it becomes a 
description _only_ of the EC, or an imperialist subject of the same (in 
both literal and Irigarayan senses). Consider for a moment Oscar Gandy's 
*The Panoptic Sort,* _A Political Economy of Personal Information_ 
(Westview, 1993):

	The panoptic sort can be understood to involve three
	integrated functions or processes: identification, 
	classification, and assessment. [...] The identification
	will never move to the level of personhood as we may 
	understand the person as the subject of religion,
	philosophy, and idealized systems of justice. The
	attention of the panoptic sort moves only to levels of
	identification that have administrative and instrumental
	relevance. (p.15)

Operating across the EC, the panoptic sort exists as a form of 
instrumental reason, a form blindly taken up by Internet Text to the 
extent that the subject is _foreclosed_ by recognition/address/ protocol. 
Only by an _extension_ into the problematic of organic epistemology can 
this poor thought be saved at all. Consider the following readjustments:

To begin, address is aligned with the _proper name_ in the Kripkean
sense, an _obdurate_ or inert construct that crosses ontological
regimes in all possible worlds. The subject is hardened by virtue
of presence, a hardening within which recognition is broadened to
include presentification or alterity. Through recognition, the 
subject is guaranteed appearance.

Protocol also is realigned to include the etiquette of the everyday, the 
attempt to establish and mutually orient "cognitive domains" among corres- 
pondents. All three terms, then, counteract the _subject of the same_; 
ignoring the EC, they insist on the absorbing of telecommunications within 
an ecosystem of which the EC is only a part- object, never a whole.

This absorption is guaranteed by considering all three terms as _assign- 
ments_ to the subject; even address becomes a second-order encoding after 
the fact. The traditional hiatus or membrane between subject and object 
must be replaced by a hap between subject and EC; it is within the gap 
that the _problematic_ of _any_ subjectivity appears. By placing the gap 
itself within the exteriority of the subject, the information carrying- 
capacity of the EC becomes (as in Merlin Donald's work) an _extension_ of 
the subject across ontological domains, the suturing of epistemological 
disjunction.

REWRITE too is accorded a realignment, with traditional shifter analysis 
(the virtual-I within the "I") and speech acts transferred always already 
to the performative mode; each asserts/is a reinsertion into the socius, 
carrying the aegis of psychoanalytical reinforcement. The result is the 
insistent subject operating within the political economy of the real, 
something hardly envisioned by the original writers of the Internet Text.

REWRITE is also _subject-object_, continuous reassertion occurring in 
no-domain. _Nothing_ writes or is written; information flow accrues within 
and across the gap. (REWRITE is history.)

Poor thought then becomes the thought of the gap and the "weaker subject," 
the subject of knives and starvation, the subject of the decay or fragmen- 
tation of the nation-state. The political economy of REWRITE requires 
communicative excess, difficult at the best of times, almost impossible in 
its absence. It is through poor thought, however, that Internet Text is 
renewed and reinserted into the necessities of contemporary thought.

Interview/Critique with Clara Hielo Internet:

What Sondheim never took into consideration in his early Internet Text,
is the complete seamlessness of virtuality that we have achieved - the
totalization of an alternative Real. Unlike the promises of "classic" 
artificial intelligence, virtual reality has been well ahead of sched-
ule (I remember reading that something would be fully operational by
2040, for example). We knew, even then, that it was always a question
of computational mass, not concept; the latter had already been worked
out (neural networking, and post-MPEGn compression techniques helped a
lot). Isn't it true that Sondheim's text, on the other hand, seems to
concentrate on the old ASCII - that it might be fair to consider it 
more of a meditation on _writing_ than anything else.

But something has said that nothing could be farther from the truth. He
points out that even text _always_ embodied ghosts, as we would say, in
whatever form. He points out as well that the complex issue of the real
itself, virtual or not, has always been central to his writing. At times
he distinguishes between real and Real, and at times he does not. He was
aware of this _splintering_ inherent in the text.

Everything is signal, everything is SCROLL, Sondheim has said, stressing
REWRITE as a condition of the real (And REWRITE, as well as SCROLL, of
course, need not imply the written; they occur within _any_ virtuality
or real whatsoever. Paramecia REWRITE, if not SCROLL. So do cyborgs.) 
There is always a sending and receiving in relation to the body; the
difficulty is that the _model_ (derived from communications technology)
diffuses - there are no entities involved, only the nexi of emissions,
spews, and vocalizations - and these can occur in any form, writing (i.
e. grammatology), or not.

We brought up the issue of seduction, the caress, sexuality, which seem
to pervade much of the text. Wasn't this a Freudianism in disguise? Or
an other form of reductionism, or even a reduction of the Other? But
Sondheim has countered, I think successfully, that desire pervades vir-
tuality - that virtuality is _driven_ in fact. (Could this be the dif-
ference, the _driven_ of the virtual, in relation to the obdurancy
[Sondheim again] of the real?] He has gone on to say that SCROLL itself
is the very stuff of ghosting, that what remains of the self (Freud, 
Lacan, Garner, or not) gets lost in the tangle - like a Tibetan ghost-
trap. He calls this trapping "the Skein," stressing the coagulative or
reconstitutive aspects of being-in-cyberspace. He also stresses that
being-in-cyberspace is equivalent to Being-in-cyberspace, a difficult
relation to Being. And he has gone so far AS TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF
CYBERSPACE ITSELF (at least in this regard, but it is unclear how far in
fact he has gone). Instead, he appears to postulate that there are _con-
fluences of the real._ More and more, there is something pre-Socratic 
about this thought, which, he feels, must liquify in order to reflect
the exigencies of virtuality, the age we find ourselves in.

He has stated that his thinking has not changed on these matters at all.
He has also stated that his production of Internet Text, along the lines
of the nineteenth-century feuilleton, has been a continuous one, but 
that the later portions neither invalidate nor supplement the earlier 
ones. Instead, the work as a whole represents a phenomenological trans-
formation without beginning or end, a mobius-structure.

So, the Internet Text - was it conceived as a kind of journey, then? No,
because there is no destination, as I have just indicated, because it 
neither reflects movement nor stasis. Ontic states _shimmer_ - think of
them as molcular, spectral lines of absorption. That's the model I would
use, and I am sure he would approve. Neither one nor another part is any
more than one or another. They are of equal and encompassing intelli-
gence. I can't say that I play favorites here.

Jennifer's Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                 2/22/97

The work to date is divided into three sections: the Internet Text 
proper, the alphabetic text a-u, and a group of independent titles. 
Together they would fill over 4.3 megs, and constitute around 2k pages 
total. The work was started more three years ago, and has continued as 
an extended meditation on cyberspace. It begins with a somewhat 
straightforward theor- etical approach, and then, calling on numerous 
ghosts (alive, quasi-alive, and dead), continues in a variety of 
directions.

Almost all of the text is in the form of "short-waves, long-waves." The 
former are the individually-titled sections, written in a variety of 
styles at times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are 
heavily interrelated; on occasion "characters" appear, _actants_ 
possess- ing philosophical or psychological import. They also create and 
problema- tize narrative substructures within the work as a whole. 
Jennifer, in particular, has been the subject/object of recent work, a 
blurring of epist- emological/ontological distinction. Jennifer is 
sexual, varying in age, philosophically well-read. Her desire carries 
philosophy, undermines it. Jennifer is me, not an alter-ego.  When I 
close my eyes, I dream: Jennif- er. When Jennifer closes her eyes, she 
dreams me into existence. I was born Jennifer.

The long-waves are fuzzy topoi on such issues as death, love, virtual 
embodiment, the "granularity of the real," immensity, language, and 
sexua- lity, which criss-cross the texts. The resulting fragmentations 
and coagu- lations owe something to phenomenology, deconstruction, 
linguistics, prehistory, the philosophies of science and programming, 
etc., but more to the functions of sites or nodes on the Net itself.

There is no binarism in the work, no series of protocol statements. Vir- 
tuality itself is considered far beyond the ASCII text / Webscape that 
is most prevalent now, at the end of the twentieth century. The various 
is- sues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real or true-real VR 
are already embryonic, permitting the theorizing of various present and 
future spatialities and their interconnectedness.

Older recent work:

"Recent work has been building on hardware software wetware outware 
issues, especially the phenomenology of the virtual, motion capture, the

dealing with cybernetics and (non) aristotelian logics."

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 150 files, or 20,000
printed pages. It began in 1/1994, and has continued as an extended
meditation on cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures,
symptomologies of the edge.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The 
former are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at 
times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are 
interrelated; on occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical 
or psychological import. These also create and problematize narrative 
substructures within the work as a whole. Such are Susan Graham, Julu, 
Alan, Jennifer, Azure, and Nikuko in particular. Most recently, texts 
are created which are aligned with still or video images, texts which 
surround them as uneasy allies, texts which speak for the silence of 
representation itself.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, 
sexuality, virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical 
reality, computer languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout 
the text; the resulting splits and convergences owe something to dance, 
phenomenology, programming, deconstruction, linguistics, philosophy and 
prehistory, as well as the domains of online worlds in relation to 
everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions. I continue working on cdroms and dvd+s of my work, creating
samplers and live performances.
RECENTLY CDs HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY FIREMUSEUM, AN LP BY QBICO
FOR DVDs PLEASE SEND REQUEST
CHECK OUT WORK ON FACEBOOK, NING, http://nikuko.blogspot.com

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi, 
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act 
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge 
out of performative language - soft-tech such as computer programs which 
_do_ things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or 
conversa- tions using internet applications that are activated one way 
or another. And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly 
video, sound, and flash pieces. Recent software used has included 
Blender, Gimp, Poser, motion capture, Audacity, Cooledit, perl and awk 
programs, Calculon and other Zaurus (linux) pda applications, and 
audio/video input from a variety of cameras and other devices.

I have been working in collaboration at times, most notably with Azure 
Carter, my partner, and Foofwa d'Imobilite, perhaps the artist/dancer I 
feel closest to, in terms of concerns about exhaustion, injury, speed, 
flight, politics, history of the body, human-avatar intersections.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements. 
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now. 
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are 
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and 
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

The texts are roughly in the order written; the last-entered at the 
moment is ns. They may be read in any order, and distributed in any 
medium; please credit me. I would appreciate in return any comments you 
may have.

As far as I can tell, the last entered introduction is pi.txt:


From net1.txt:

INTRODUCTION TO INTERNET TEXT AS A WHOLE

Years ago, I gave a lecture at the Ontario College of Art, in which 
interaction with a computer was described as the production of a program 
space. The space was characterized by absolute control; the computer 
responds on a one-to-one basis to input. If the user enters a command, 
either the command is carried out, or various errors occur. Computer 
games carry this one step farther - the game responds deliberately to 
what I _do,_ creating the sense of a dominated environment.

Today, the situation is completely different, particularly given the
various communicative modalities of the Internet - email, email lists,
usenet groups, IRC (Internet Relay Chat), and so forth. Within the next
several years, there will be at least seventy-five million users 
on-line, and as the Net grows, it becomes leaky, ungainly, and noisy.
More than ever, the user's personality (on- and off-line) plays a major
role in his or her interaction. On the one hand, the machine interface
still determines to a great extent the nature of this interaction; on
the other, there is a tendency to (want to) "see past" the machinery, 
into the heart of the Other.

Internet Text is an extended analysis of the environment of Internet
communication, an extended meditation on the psychology and philosophy
of Net exchange. As such, it is concerned primarily with virtual or
electronic subjectivity - the simultaneous presence and absence of the
user, the sorts of libidinal projections that result, the nature of
flamewars, and the ontological or epistemological issues that underlie
these processes.

Internet Text begins with a brief, almost corrosive, account of the
subject - an account based on the concepts of Address, Protocol, and
Recognition. This section "reduces" virtual subjectivity to packets of
information, Internet sputterings, and an ontology of the self based on
Otherness - _your_ recognition of me is responsible for my Net-presence.
The reduction then begins to break down through a series of further texts 
detailing the nature of this presence, a nature which is both sexualized/ 
gendered, and absenting, the result of an _imaginary site._ 

Almost all of Internet Text is in the form of "short-waves, long-waves." 
The former are the individual texts themselves, written in a variety of 
styles, and referencing a number of writers ranging from Jabes and 
Blanchot to Acker and Bataille, with Sartre, Kristeva, and Karl Kraus 
somewhere in the middle. These texts are completely interrelated; on 
occasion "characters" appear - these are _actants,_ conveying certain 
psychological or philosophical ideas beyond or within traditional 
expository prose.

The long-waves are content-sites, such as issues of death, love, virtual 
embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, and so 
forth, which interpenetrate the short-waves, connecting them. During the 
writing of Internet Text, Michael Current (now deceased) and I began an 
Internet conference, Cybermind - and the moderating of Cybermind has led 
to serious considerations of hackers, the nature of "free" net 
communica- tion, flaming, and so forth. Eventually, it has become clear 
that every- thing revolves around issues of the virtual subject, who is 
only virtual _on_ the Net, but who has a very real body _elsewhere._ So 
Internet Text has evolved more and more in a meditation on this subject 
- a subject which will perhaps be one of the dominant modes of _being_ 
within the next millennium.

Finally, it should be noted that there are no conclusions to be drawn in 
Internet Text, no series of protocol statements or declarations creating 
any sort of ultimate defining or explanatory position. The entire 
history of philosophy mitigates against this; instead, I side with the 
Schlegels, with Nietzsche, Bataille, Jabes, and others, for whom the 
fragment is crucial to an understanding of contemporary life...

I wish to thank Michael Current, Chris Keep, and Robert Withers for 
their help and encouragement. Parts of this text have been published in 
Perforations and Crash (Thread Waxing Space). It is dedicated to 
Michael Current and Clara Hielo.

Alan Sondheim's Online Life and Times

=====

I began writing on and about the Net, dealing with what I call "virtual 
subjectivity," back in 1994, and started working on a still interminable 
Internet Text, which is about 4000 pages in length at this point. It 
resides in a number of files (which also include experimental webpages, 
some graphics, and even two virtual reality pieces) at a Canberra, Aus- 
tralia, site: www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt. There is also a mir- 
ror site at the Spoons philosophy email lists homepage.

In 1994, I also started, with Michael Current, an email list devoted to 
the psychology and philosophy of being on line, called Cybermind; this 
is still going strong. I also started another list, Fiction-of- 
Philosophy, concerned with writing and philosophy. And in 1996, 
Cybermind held a major conference in Perth, Australia; I was keynote 
speaker. The conference dealt with all things virtual, and had a strong 
art component as well. We used a variety of Internet connections to 
broadcast, including CuSeeMe (Internet video), RealAudio (Internet 
audio), a newsgroup, and the Cybermind MOO, a text-based virtual reality 
especially set up for the occasion.

The use of the MOO demonstrated what new modes of discourse are possible 
in real life. We had an auditorium, podium, and speaker; and as she 
spoke, someone would type her words into the MOO, to be read world-wide 
by anyone who logged in. We then projected the MOO - which included, not 
only a summary of the talk, but also the MOO audience's responses - 
which were also typed in. So the speaker was surrounded by text 
commenting on her talk - the hall really came alive. Later, I was to 
repeat such con- ferencing techniques at the New School (with poor 
success), and, through Mike Gurstein, I was one of the facilitators for 
an International conference on technology and economic development, 
run on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and held in Nova Scotia.

My own work has moved towards concepts of the manifestation of the body, 
language, and sexuality online. I've produced close to 200 graphics, and 
am working with both the dancer Foofwa d'Imobilite (of Merce Cunningham 
fame, among other performances/companies) and my partner, Azure Carter. 
We recently screened a video, Nikuko, at Millennium Film in New York; 
the tape uses characters (Daishin Nikuko, Doctor Leopold Konninger, and 
The Lead Dancer) developed as avatars (persona which take on a life of 
their own) on the Net, to create a psycho-sexual exploration of real and 
virtual bodies.

A great deal of my recent work, in fact, has used such avatars; there 
are four in particular: Daishin Nikuko, a "demiurge" who also worked as 
a snack-bar girl in Fukuoka, Japan; Julu, who remains behind the scenes, 
pulling strings and other things; Jennifer, who stems from nineteenth- 
century concepts of girlhood and etiquette; and Alan, whose position is 
always problematic in relation to the others. Sometimes one or more of 
these characters will go online, into a chatroom or other communal area, 
and interact with other participants (or with each other - for example, 
dialogs between Jennifer and Julu); the interaction may be recorded, and 
shaped into a text dealing with community, language, and control. The 
possibilities are endless; I've written, and keep rewriting, a program 
in Perl which is interactive and allows me to create new texts 
constantly, ones exploring issues of virtuality and psyche, among other 
things.

The graphics, too, are of Nikuko- or Alan- or Doctor Leopold Konninger- 
inspired origin; as single images, they resonate with one another. In a 
Cdrom produced by Railroad Earth in Atlanta, more than 200 such image 
are in a single directory; a viewer can move among them, building up a 
characterology or context for them, in relation to the Internet Text 
(also included).


What's kept me going through all of this, beyond the obvious benefits of 
audience and distribution, is what James Ellroy, in another context, and 
Merleau-Ponty, in still another, calls _the wonder._ It's the wonder 
that keeps me going, the experience of things I could not have imagined, 
say, even half a decade ago. I remember one of the first times I was on 
CuSee- me, chatting on video with someone stationed in Antarctica. I 
remember exploring Net sex and Net sexuality, and the modalities of the 
body that opened up (which I've lectured on exhaustively). I remember 
the first time that jodi.org "took over" my screen - and how amazing 
their work was and is, as if the very bones of the Net and computer were 
being shaken. (m9ndfukc did that for me, for a while, and there are 
always other "net.art" groups springing up. Recently, the VRML (virtual 
reality) work of Maurice Clifford astonished me.

SIDEBAR 3:

further on my work -

my work is not about avatars; it is not about jennifer, julu, nikuko. my 
work is not about sex or sexual objects. my writing floats through 
beings and sexualities, floats through different worlds with different 
physics, different neurophysiologies. my work is about the 
interrelationships among the symbols employed to comprehend, elucidate, 
live within, the world - and the consciousness which receives, 
transmits, and is constituted to some degree by such symbols. my work 
exists between the symbolic and the imaginary/fantasmic/uncanny - on one 
hand, protocols, etiquette, and pro- priety - and on the other, those 
very openings occasioned by avatars, sex- ualities, issues of dreamed 
bodies and bodies dreaming, trance-states, virtual subjectivities, 
electronic existences.

(the work is not pornography, titillation, stories, parables; it is not 
a narrative of avatars or epistolary novel; neither of course is it what 
i say it is, or is not.)

i am writing this in response to someone's kind backchannel response 
concerning my last textual posting - that it is difficult to pin down 
what these texts are, from what occasions they emerge, towards what 
horizons they move, however haltingly.

consciousness moves, trembling, against great forces and happenstance; 
the asteroid, cancer, death, takes it all out. we exist and write/create 
within the meantime, meanwhile. and within this interstice, we inhabit 
phenom- enologies as if there were futures, eternities, truths. i write 
towards and against these futures, eternities, truths; i write as if 
there were no tomorrow, or as if we were always already inhabiting 
tomorrow as fantasm.

i want to move towards and across, beyond the other, as if the other 
were a lure or possibility. i want to write into the void, where texts 
and images fall into space emptied of everything, including purity. and 
I want to see what happens in these non-domains; what types of 
perception and consciousnesses are possible; what the limits of the 
human, the animal, the organism, are; what may be said about the future 
of philosophy and the philosophy of the future - the textual body and 
the body of text - the state of the chiasm and partial objects, 
interpenetrations; what can be created when language is reconstituted, 
transformed, beneath the signi- fiers of technology, sexuality, capital, 
and so forth. i want to move into spaces that dis/comfort or exhilarate 
me, spaces that keep the sense of wonder alive, spaces that - at least 
for me - are new, and always beyond what i am able to accomplish. i want 
to see vistas, be vistas, see ...

towards these ends i write daily into areas that both carry my signature 
and abandon it. i want to abandon, as much as possible, the foreclosure 
of ideological theorizing or a tendency towards the specificity of style 
or genre; what i want to do, i can't possibly accomplish, i keep writing 
...

Can you elaborate?
[8:21]  You: - yes, continually self-announcement and production (with
implication of work, economy) through the avatar
[8:21]  You: rewrite: an important concept developed by alan in the
internet text
[8:22]  You: the subject writes and rewrites into existence.

The Index

The Index I posted yesterday is a guide to the long-waveforms that inhabit
the 1200 or so sections that constitute the Internet Text as a whole. Wri-
ting it gave me the opportunity to see what was manifest in the work over
the past two years, and what was hidden, articulated beneath the surface,
submerged. Gender, for example, appears as a concern everywhere, yet it is
not the focus of a particular group of texts; likewise, software and the
Web are discussed throughout, but not as titled subject-matter. Software
and gender form lamina or strata weaving across domains, the former an in-
dex of totality producing differentiation within the machinic, and the la-
tter, an index of differentiation producing totality within the organic.
Interwoven, the Internet Text extrudes from the Cyborg realm, the produc-
tion of continuous investment, interweaving, neurosis. There are numerous
references to writers such as Kristeva, Derrida, Irigaray, etc., yet none
of these have their own listings in the Index; again, they're interwoven
presences. 

The _thickness_ of the text is exhausting; even with the index, the forty-
some files must be searched for interior references. No one will ever read
this mass; it's clotted, puerile-puellile, monstrous. At night, words spew
against violated-fabric flesh, organ-receptors flooded by leaked vowels,
torn open by consonants, dammed by punctuation. There is no end to it; the
hole remains a mobius strip sutured and stripped at every grapheme, demar-
cation, inscription. It is a gone world of perversion, inverted, sensing
itself senseless. It rides me. It continues.

Texts


Receiving _this_ space of reading which is always open, penetrated, a
perforated space splayed for reply or deletion and therefore fragile, the
space of a membrane, torn-space, there is always _this_ space on the other
end/other hand, space of writing which is foreclosed, null after sending,
re-articulated in archive or hard-copy. This project which presses against
my limbs, a discursive formation, is rooted in the begin- ning of the
Internet Text, which is rooted at an unknown measure; I have no record of
chronology and the start of distribution, before cybermind and fiction-
of-philosophy, possessing only the text's entirety, all fourteen files
1-14, beginning now a second alphabetic set with extended subject matter.

If you have followed me so far or are tired of losing me, turning around
by the birch (denuded by illness as the species slowly disappears), to
retrace the path where the roots begin, you might want to once again
examine those sequences of the initial text as prove relevant or summary,
in particular the introduction and vocabularies or outlines scattered
among the whole. It is in these sections that notions of address, protocol,
recognition, spew, emission, uncanny, imaginary, web inversion, violation
fabric, indexical embodiment, rewrite, and so forth are developed;  and it
is these sections which foreground the current texts, which cannot repeat
what has gone before, but exist as a twisted birch dying by the side of
the path, without the nourishment already given. 

The following sections of the files are useful for any revival, and may 
be retrieved through http://www.uio.no/~mwatz/cybermind/texts/sondheim.html
---

(In NET1.TXT):
All the beginning sections, including the Introduction to the project
as a whole, contain useful material.
(In NET4.TXT):
SUMMARY OF INTERNET TEXT: Brief description of basic concepts.
(In NET5.TXT)
Partial Summary of Internet Text (from Web Text)
(In NET14.TXT):
Brief Glossary of Terms from Internet Text

Surrounding sections contain or portray the aura of this skeleton. A 
certain _mesmeric_ effect, of course, may be obtained, by reading the whole.

ky.txt

"" or Practice

"I began writing the Internet Text with one piece every two days or so. 
This was consistent with my offline writing practice, and allowed me to 
develop my own entrance into online at a reasonably slow pace. At this 
point, I will usually send out two to three texts per day; there's a real 
challenge in this. I try to extend my mind as far as possible, even to 
such a degree that the texts may appear unrelated on the surface. But they 
are appearing at roughly the same time, and in sequence.

"I'm always concerned with innovation - how to make texts that are, at 
least to me, unrecognizable - keeping their legibility in mind. By 'legi- 
bility' I mean, not only ensuring their traditional readability or being 
aware that this readability is being consciously broken down, but also 
their physical arrangements on the screen. If a piece is relatively inco- 
herent, it is deliberately incoherent.

"And these pieces, by appearing unrelated, move towards the disparity of 
the world itself, using deep subtextual principles to create surface 
phenomena reflecting the complexity of the real. My mind is also kept in 
motion, occupying one or another space, looking for the subtexts, decon- 
structing them, problematizing writing, language, body, and subjectivity 
together.

"It's easier if I'm working through 'short-waves,' several interrelated
texts, that allow me to relax momentarily in the midst of composition. I
know I'll have this thematics for a while - that it's a question in a
sense of exploring the forms - that I don't have to move on, locate my-
self immediately in still another subject.

"'Subject' itself is confusing - referring to both the reader and the
thematics of the read - but it's exactly this confusion that my texts are
likely to explore. Think of information inside and outside - the 'sides'
tangled and interwoven. That's part of it.

"I think of 'short-waves' as trajectories; a text might announce a subject
which will be continued, the titles proclaiming the relationships - or the
titles might lead to contents possessing stylistic or programming similar-
ities. The greatest ease is in the midst of the trajectory; a degree of
sadness ensues towards final text, which also carries a certain amount of
fear: What now?

"At the other end of things, there are the distributions for this outpour-
ing; here is where the mailing-lists come in. I send regularly to two, and
irregularly to three. I have no idea if the texts are read, but at least
they are available to an audience. 

"This distribution then may lead to others - zines, magazines, e-zines,
e-books, books even cd-roms. Anything is possible. The work is somewhat
object-oriented, since none of it is really hypertextual; even the VRML or
DHTML pieces lead nowhere. I think of them as 'exempla' of psychological
spaces. 

"And the result of all of this? Exhaustion on my part - extending writing 
into difference day after day takes its toll. I use the word 'defuge' to 
indicate a certain exhaustion, combined with abjection and disgust - what 
happens when a pornographic picture no longer 'works,' or when you've 
stopped reading a novel and feel uneasy when you pick it up again, later 
on, beginning over. It's a complex state, but it hits. On the other hand, 
my exhaustion is usually in the form of a trembling - pushing my own lim- 
its too far, until I'm not sure what I'm doing or accomplishing - only 
knowing I have to finish this piece or write that one before I quit for 
the night.

"I hunger over my texts - I 'ride' the short-waves, as if they were anim-
als. Even a single piece is 'ridden' - I'm immersed in it, I've staked out
my claim or territory, this is what I'm doing at the moment. The hunger is
real, it's palpable. It's an extreme state itself; it never lets me alone.
I live and work through it.

"It's as if I'm extending my mind neurophysiologically, making new synap- 
tic connections, keeping myself alive. Each text is a conundrum, each a 
physical therapy. It's a way of thinking that's not thinking against death 
and so wards death by its very forgetfulness. Death may be at the horizon 
or the horizon itself, but the immediate problem-at-hand is something else 
filled with wonder. And the problem never has a solution, only continued 
discourse.

"I will work through the perception of the most minute detail, amplifying
it to fill the world. Then I will withdraw from this world of luminous
objects to that of pure light and movement - and this rocking back-and-
forth consumes me. Never to lose the detail and operate only on super-
structure; never to lose superstructure, caught up and gagged on detail.
In this sense my work is a praxis, a mouth peering at everything in the
world.

"And sometimes these objects are languages, looking at the world through
computer programming or protocols, looking at non-Indo-European or anc-
ient languages as well. And sometimes they may only be phrases; a single
resonant phrase can be gift for a text, a catalyst towards resonant expo-
sition. Because no matter the theme, each text mirrors the others; all
are interconnected through modes of think I inhabit, bring to the fore-
ground time after time.

"Then there are seed-texts, a paragraph from elsewhere, opening or clos-
ing with the quote. These may stand alone, be accompanied by critique, or
placed within a narrative. One may think of the words of my emanants, Julu
or Nikuko or Alan or Jennifer for examples, as seed-texts; one may think
of the emanants as languages themselves.

"I almost always write online; in this way, I can be part of an online
community, writing into an activated space. Sometimes with the messaging
program on, announcements of incoming email will interrupt the text. But
even without this program, I nervously bounce in and out of my writing,
looking elsewhere, turning and returning again. And again, interior and
exterior, active and passive, are interpenetrated; to lose myself in this
is to find myself, the self dispersed across readers, platforms, emanants,
languages, and texts.

"The texts are objects and they are flows. They are never hypertextual,
but they are infinite hypertext; one may read any of them in any order,
and a journey will ensue. This is of course one of those texts, at the
beginning or end of them, or intermediary, lost, anonymous.

"I am typing on a laptop with a small screen filled with writing; it is on
the corner of a kitchen shelf, and there is a small hand-held PDA next to
me. The resonant phrases were written on the PDA, added to throughout the
afternoon; now they appear fulfilled, blossomed, dis/eased, forgotten.
This is the way the text is constructed from beginning throughout, as if
there were nothing but real domains in the world, and what is unsayable is
(im)precisely what is _lost in the texts,_ not elsewhere, ready for the
scaffolding to be taken apart."

Ritual

Over a hundred times I've had to follow the paths below, adding new files
to the Internet Text as they _accumulate,_ transform into theoretical sub-
stance. Last night, file ff was added to the rest, and the net index was
updated. The files are easily retrievable; the whole morass is around
four megabytes of solid bristly ascii. 

I travel from panix.com to the site at jefferson.village.virginia.edu, and
then: 

341	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
342	ftp panix3.panix.com	[getting file]
343	wc ff				
344	ls -l ee		[checking permissions]
345	chmod 664 ff		
346	ls -l ff		[changing, checking permissions]
347	cd
348	cd public_html
349	pico internet_txt.html	[adding access on home-page for filename]
350	ftp panix3.panix.com	[preparing home-page for download]
351	exit
352	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
353	ls -l netindex.txt
354	rm netindex.txt		[removing old index for Internet Text]
355	ftp panix3.panix.com	[adding new index]
356	chmod 664 netindex.txt
357	ls -l netindex.txt	[checking permissions]

I exit, enter internet_txt.html from panix.com, make sure everything is
running properly. I have had to change the netindex.txt first, by down-
loading ff, and toggling between it and online. The index has grown to
390 entries, something for everybody. It's spidery, out of control; it 
has bones in it. The sequence above, server-side, is the bi-weekly stir-
ring of the soup.

Writing in Minimal Fare


Writing in Pico in the linux or unix shell strips away excess; what 
remains is inner speech, a dialog of thought unencumbered by design. It's 
difficult to work within boxes, colors, menu systems, corporate or other 
headings. Here I think through the movement of concepts, ideas, emotions; 
there, I founder on the barriers of software design. True enough, Pico 
itself is design, but the design minimal; what is visible is primarily a 
window of unadorned text, processed by a minimal number of commands. There 
are no distracting images, no sounds or other annoyances (the arrival of 
new mail, instant messaging, banner ads). It's as if writing has returned 
to its source in the body and stele or table, and lost in eternity, stone 
hardened writing should tend only towards existence. the self-inscribed 
desire sexuality desire's written for & conceivable tablet, there are

pr.txt



Writing habits


When I write, sooner or later the piece seems finished to me; it then is 
placed at the end of an ongoing 'collection' file that is placed on 
http://www.alansondheim.org ; the most recent is 'pr.txt.' I work on 
additions to these collections until they total anywhere from 80k - 100k, 
at which point the next in the series is started. I began with Net0.TXT, 
Net1.TXT, etc., for about 10; then there were several named files. 
Finally, the alphabet was used. The result is an irregular marking system 
which has settled down in an orderly fashion for the past 100 or so 
collections; 'pr.txt' follows 'pq.txt' and will precede 'ps.txt.' There 
can be between 20 and 80 individual pieces in one of these collections.

The individual segments generally follow whatever line of inquiry I'm 
working on at the moment, with numerous exceptions. At one point I spoke 
of 'long waves' and 'short waves' to indicate thematic movement through 
the mass of collections. A long wave might be Nikuko or defuge; a short 
wave might be a particular Access Grid resonance configuration which is 
exploited for a while.

These texts are heavily edited and spell-checked with ispell; unfortuna- 
tely, errors inevitably creep in. In my last text, I wrote 'my' instead of 
'may,' 'scholar' instead of 'scholarship,' and had a misplaced dash, the 
result of re-justifying after some corrections. I hope these errors aren't 
misleading, but are understood only as slips of the tongue leading nowhere
at all. They're not caught by ispell, and they're not caught by me.

I try to keep the average individual piece length to 43 lines, although it 
may range from 10 to 300 or so. I send these out once a day at least; this 
is my compulsion, and if I don't feel I've completed work for the day - 
and completed work at that - I find myself, like now, unable to sleep, 
cursing myself for being human so to speak.

The compulsion has to be be coupled with necessity, the 'natural' contin- 
uation of a series. I attempt to balance practical/production works with 
theoretical ones; sometimes the two accompany each other, and sometimes 
they're simply contiguous, as with the recent series of butterflies mating 
which I found fascinating; I hadn't seen this particular ritual before.

The texts are almost always written, as this one is, online at panix.com 
in the Pico editor in a shell account; the font is mono-spaced courier. 
There's a sense of urgency for me in this accountancy which is maintained 
only by a live connection; as I've written before, I recognize the server 
load and panix community which is almost always present in the background 
and accessed through the 'w' or 'who' or various other commands.

Once written, the file is sent from my home directory to my Pine email, as 
well as added to the current large text file. The file is almost always 
named 'zz' which places it at the end of a sorting; sometimes it's moved 
to 'ww' if I'm afraid it will be accidentally erased. If I'm processing 
the file, I move between 'zz' and 'yy.' If I'm working in the midst of a 
long file, I use 'zzzzz' for a bookmark. When the file is completed, I do 
an edit, an ispell, and a 'wc' word/line/character count before it's sent 
out through Pine.

The style varies from one text to another; one major characteristic is the 
presence or absence of capital letters. If the text is to be 'breathed' as 
if spoken with the words run together, or presented as flow or emission 
itself, I'll use small letters only. If the text is traditional or 
genre-oriented, capitals are employed, as they are in a number of common 
poetic forms. Sections of the text may be energized by capitals as well. 
All of this seems inconsistent, aggravated by no common rule for quotation 
marks (single or double).

If the text is generated with the Google wsdl etc., I'll usually remove 
numbers in order to create an effect of 'orality' to the finished result. 
I'll check for upper ascii characters with the more command, take them out 
with the 'strings' command. I may eliminate punctuation, etc.; for all of 
this, I use 'sed' in various forms as well as 'tr.' At times I may begin a 
text by culling from the internet text as a whole; the command I generally 
use is 'grep -h X *.txt' which produces a file without giving the file 
source of the individual lines. Most of the time, if I'm modifying a text 
in this way, I'll use various perl programs, scripts, etc. in combination, 
working to 'shape' the text to my satisfaction.

I'm not interested in writing a generated text that appears meaningless; 
I'll shape it until it 'tends towards' I want, or the meaning I might find 
hidden within it. This is of course a dialectical process and aesthetic 
choice; for me the justification of a text lies, not in the conceptual 
apparatus that produced it, but in the complex resonances between the text 
and its reading, and the confluent generatings of meaning that occur in 
the process.

Periodically, collections like 'pr.txt' are uploaded to my webpage, which 
is of course nothing more than a directory; one can read the most recent 
collection, complete or incomplete, in conjunction with the image, sound, 
or video files that are referenced within it. The collection is also a 
guide to them. After a while, these files may be removed to make room for 
others; there are, however, 'core' files which remain in place because 
they seem to me to have particular significance over a longer period of 
time. Sometimes a reader will write to me, asking for a file that has been 
taken down; I generally put it back up for one or two days, then take it 
down again.

This is the process that's carried out, day in and day out. (I think I 
once went for 6 days without producing anything - in 15 years.)  suffer 
from depression, poor eyesight getting poorer, minor 'twitches' in my left 
frontal lobe, and severe insomnia; it's the last that governs when I write 
and perhaps how I go about it. I write at all hours of the day or night; I 
need to have a complete and final thought that could always be a conclu- 
sion if I should happen to die at the time; death in fact haunts the text 
at one end, and sex on the other, with the struggling of the inscribed 
body in their midst. I want every text to resonate with every other, every 
text to carry a totality whispered among all of them. If I don't achieve 
this, what I produce feels more like an 'instance' or 'advertisement,' 
something on a path which is yet incomplete - and my nightmares turn 
furious...

Theoretical Work in the Internet Text (Locations)


Everthing I write must be read with this doubled meaning:
0. Clara Hielo Internet.
avatar of the uncanny scattered throughout her text
1. Concepts of address, protocol, recognition: the tuning of subjectivity,
instrumental reason.
from the very beginnings of the Internet Text, these terms focused upon
the entrancing and frameworks of cyberspace, first files
2. Rewrite and the opening of the space of the I: inscription and fissure.
nearly the very beginnings, inscribing which continues and thins throughout
the other texts, the alphabetic as well
3. Emission, spew, and sourceless/targetless communications.
focused upon well early enough, presencing of speaking without author or
text through until and beyond the end
4. Hysterical embodiment and the variants of reading the other.
third sexualities located from the middle of the Net files on, centered in
the alphabetic texts
5. Synesthesia and the transformations of senses across the Net.
substratum everywhere in the Net and alphabetic texts, discomforts of the
body against the particulation of the symbolic, stuttering of packets
6. Defuge, burnouts and anomies on the Net.
recently, and harbored primarily within the alphabetic, wandering against
theory which refuses the function of the suture or I.
7. Third sex and the ascii unconscious.
beginning early on, circulations, and stuttering, Tiffay, Travis, others,
narratologies as well, recent focus within the alphabetic texts.
8. The uncanny/imaginary, fantasms, and the reading/jectivity of the other.
increasingly relying on borderline states, what could only be imagined in
the Net files, descending into the substance of the imaginary in the more
recent work.
9. Communities and communalities on the Net.
mid-sections coming together with false promises, premises, delusions, the
largest middle-third of the work harboring occasional files.
10. Disruptions of community and self, web inversion and power.
conflagrations and violent outbreaks, deaths and dissolutions, from the
mid-early Net texts on to the present.
11. Liquidities of identity, identity shifting, shape-riding.
Travis and others occupying the final science fiction stories going nowhere.
12. Appearances of cybermind elsewhere in literary/philosophical texts.
intensity of recent investigations in which the textual body and the body 
of texts simultaneously presence the curlicue on the margins, almost
afterthoughts.
13. The phenomenology of the architecture of the Net TCP/IP itself.
running through the fourth and fifth sevenths of the total work, concerns
about Net sentience and the clean and proper bodies of the datagrams.
14. The chora/maternal: towards the symbolic, murmur/stutter of the world.
more recently, emerging with emergence, the convolutions of a text breaking
in upon itself, the splintering and stuttering of the teeth and tongue.
15. The presymbolic as an interpretation or regression from the symbolic.
everywhere in the more recent work, where text devolves into non-text,
where politics begin with the word and endlessly end off-screen.
16. Addictions, censorships, obscenities, and other topical issues.
addictions always already from the endings of the first few files, but the
obscene a continuous return, aware of the politics "beginning with the 
word."
17. Death on and off the Net, the physical body as obdurate and/or residue.
from several files in, real and imaginary deaths, the deaths of texts and
spaces later and later on.
18. Virtual or veiled subjectivity, phenomenology and psychoanalytics.
all the way through the Net files and alphabetic texts, the subject 
approached and withdrawn, introjections and projections merging into the
wares of the terminally-screened.
19. Detemporalizations and the problematic of time in the virtual subject.
recent thinkings towards the center of the alphabetic texts, the last few,
destabilizations, the beyond of the earlier Net files, groping towards a
theoretical resolution.
20. Generalized mesaure geometries and dissipative communications.
the computer-program texts in the Net files, concentrating in particular on
the series fgfffgfgfgfffgfffgfffgfgfgfffgfg... and its relation to the lost
almost-symmetries of Net exchanges.
21. Phenomenology of emotional states, behaviors, and discourses on the Net.
everywhere beneath and upon the surface of the files.
23. Source and phenomenologies of the voice, mouth, organs.
everywhere beneath and upon the surface of the files, breaking-out in the
midst of the other, narratological descents.
24. Phenomenology of cyberspace, of its "inhabiting."
everywhere again within and without the totality of texts and files.
25. Looping, blackholes, the blind password, the 'great beyond.'
in the earlier works, and in the middle seventh, reoccurring losses in the
occasion of the framework itself and those farsighted enough to delimit
the absent boundaries of these multiply-closed multiple topologies.
26. Events in cyberspace: wars, peace, origins, dissolutions.
irruptions when they occur; they manifest themselves as tears in the fabric
of the hole, which is sutured upon them; a certain hollowness pervades.
27. Part-objects, entities, proper-names, and totalizations in cyberspace.
the fourth and fifth seventh moving through the name in relation to the
earliest accounts in the Net files of the same.
28. The granularity of the real.
the first three-sevenths of the Net text and alphabetic files, carrying the
memory of its beginning, the initial post, the surrounding terminal screen,
the dawn of the night and dusk of the relative day.
29. Relationships of the above to everyday life, philosophy and sociology.
drawn forth in a process of withdrawing, throughout the textual domain.
