

Avatars



We propose a paper with examples dealing with my work with avatars on the
Internet. This work uses interactive modes between myself and one or ano-
ther character, all of which interact with Net protocols or applications.
You may see some of this in operation at the URL below where Jennifer,
Julu, Alan, and Nikuko have written themselves in and out of the texts.

This is the paper we propose.

It's possible to employ a degree of slippage; it becomes unclear who is
speaking in any text, "she said."  Just as quotations slip laterally in
the sentence, there is also a slippage in depth, for example, as Nikuko
replies. @wet Nikuko. Nikuko is wet, dripping urine through her white
cotton panties.

We understand the oddity of this proposal, but we have been dealing with
formally performative language for the past few years, in order to look at
issues of virtual subjectivity, interaction, projection and introjection
on the Net. We worry about being taken seriously, not as broken schizo-
phrenics. put mouth on panties. You drink urine of Nikuko.

"Performative" can be considered in any number of ways. For example,
there is a _trace_ function in the Julu program Jennifer has written, a
function which produces a text representing parent/child processes in
unix, choices made by the user, manipulations by the program itself. The
function produces a file, .trace, which, when reversed, is legibile. The
.trace file accumulates, carrying the history of repeated usage; here is
an example:

hairpiece:sure thing:Julu:leg:
Come home with me, hairpiece, julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your dirty arm is in my black neck
HaPPINESS:Yes:Alan::
Your psychotic head is in my sexy head
Your your penis seeps into my head - turning me Julu-Jennifer
Hole:YES!!:Julu:nail:
Your poor urine is in my depressed nail
Devour poor urine julu-of-the partying Hole!
Nikuko ...:never!:Nikuko:hair:hair
Your linen leg is in my wanton hair
Your passion seeps into my hair - turning me Julu-Jennifer
dirty:yeah:Nikuko:ear:
Your psychotic eye is in my velvet ear
Devour psychotic eye julu-of-the partying dirty!

Note the stick-like or _anime_ figures at work, distributed authorships
and anatomies. look panties. You see nothing special.

So that "performative" language has three constituents:

1. Its usual site and analysis as speech act or performative in tradi-
tional linguistics (and all the accompanying critiques);
2. Referencing programming language, which is always performative; thus
"echo `date`" calls up date which echo then sends to the standard output;
3. _Any_ statement, say, in a chat (IRC, talker, MOO, MUD, chat, etc.)
environment, which both _constitutes_ and _constructs_ the subject/user;
without the statement, the subject/user disappears for others.

There is thus the constructed/constituted subject - who is, by virtue of
protocols, always already _well-defined,_ and the subject on the other/
near side of the screen - who need not detain us: one might in this
fashion call the "real" or "physical-real" subject the _virtual subject_
by virtue of his or her dis/appearance in relation to others on the Net.

Avatars are always disturbances, always irruptions of language, a lang-
uage portending _the raveling of existence and essence,_ for these terms
meld within each other, tangled in avatar-sites/sights/citations. @create
$thing called begging. You have a $thing called begging with object number
#75438.

(Now we call _these_ avatars _emanants,_ since they are more deeply em-
bedded than the usual - not to be taken up or dropped as MOO players for
example, but part and parcel of psychoanalytics themselves.)

We wish to discuss the psychology and philosophy of virtual subjectivity,
vis-a-vis performative language. Look penis. You see nothing special.

As seen above, in that an/other writing, perhaps that of Julu. But here
are two disturbances by Nikuko, using warez programs, into IRC (Internet
Relay Chat) - in one instance, violation of users, and in the other, pro-
ducing an "obdurate" text, not responding to anyone, simply _reproducing_
- avatar / emananating:

We do look at ruptures or disturbances created by characters resonating
or interfering with configuration files, MOOs, MUDs, talkers, and IRC.

These disturbances develop the limits or margins of the program, reveal
the substructures/protocols at work, and violate dialogs in relation to
"meta"- components. @squeeze penis. It makes a mewling sound. You are
sticky. @clean Julu. Julu is now cleaned from mewling penis.

But Nikuko, Alan, Jennifer, and Julu are disturbances in another way as
well; they tend towards _psychosis,_ an interweaving of realities, respon-
sibilities, and claims; so not only, as above, is it not always clear who
is speaking, or who is speaking for whom - but it is not always clear that
the speaker herself can separate from her creations. Voices, voices!  

Which will be the future of the Net, if and when it attains a state of
_seamless virtual reality,_ a state of melding with the real, so that the
only distinction between the pratico-inert and the virtual might be, the
presence of a safeword/keyword, allowing immediate movement from one to
the other. Look Julu. Julu is wearing lovely white panties.

Nikuko says that Alan is repeating herself. Look Jennifer. Jennifer is
wearing lovely white panties.

We will show how such disturbances define both the openings and foreclo-
sures of subjectivity on the Net, and how such subjectivity is dependent
on the specific performativities of various applications.

In other words, through margins, slippages, constitutions, constructs,
emergences from the "depths" of software or hardware, blockages and flows
and programming languages (and their phenomenologies) - only through tak-
ing these into account, as well as surface manifestations, is it possible
to comprehend virtual subjectivity, etc. And further, as we've pointed out
elsewhere, it is necessary to consider the _projection of the self_ - its
written or constituted appearance - in various applications. As examples:
in IRC (above), the self appears as third-person, #<#Nikuko#># leap. In a
MOO, if the user types "says hello, the reply on-screen to you would be
You say "hello." and the receiver will see Jennifer says, "hello." Call
this more intimate, second-person. On ytalk or Powwow or ICQ, as you type
your words appear to the other, and erasures are also visible, the letters
disappearing in reverse. Each participant occupies a _space_ on the screen
which represents - or is - the space of the (virtual) body, constituted as
written. Call this first-person, reading through one's eye into the I of
the other. Look Alan. Alan is wearing lovely white panties. His penis
presses against lovely white cotton cloth. @remove panties. Alan's penis
sticks straight out. Look penis. You see nothing special.

There is often a lure and seduction among the avatars at work here - and
this relates to the Lacanian object a, a continuous deferral. We would
also place the early Derridean notion of _differance_ for your considera-
tion, "said Jennifer," responding to Julu. In order to see this at work,
read the report of a discussion between Jennifer and Nikuko on ytalk; Jen-
nifer "was" in Fukuoka, Japan, and Nikuko "was" in New York - or perhaps
the other way around... In reality, the discussion was held on our linux
box in Brooklyn, telnetting simultaneously to Japan and our ISP in Manhat-
tan; we then connected the two through ytalk, and recorded the discussion
- writing and reading it as a dialog among "selves" - in a linux editor.
@touch penis.

Lurid, lurid, talk straight. You see the shapes through their outlines in
cotton panties! You can't see details; you know their scents, they take
you over in desperate dreams, replied Jennifer, pulling her panties down
ever so slightly, a thin ragged line of pubic hair visible above the
elastic, her labia swollen against the wet cloth. @tongue panties. You
tongue panties while Jennifer and Nikuko talk.

our bodies' miseries
the matrix saves us, there is no beginning and ending, nothing but liquid

oh jennifer, the world will never know what beauty entangled us among our
very selves, machines, wholesale worlds to sail, soiled and sold
they are frought with desire, they lend themselves to arms and legs 
akimbo
we are made, made, women, we have sounded, resonated, with each and every
protocol, each and every space or site open to winds and skies

I'd be hard tput to know what tradition you are speaking from, Nikuko, if

the Kojiki <*note replying with capitals, as the discussion hardens its
