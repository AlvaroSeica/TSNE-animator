there are three types of languaging:

>>hello
hello - just where you speak and it appears, and this serves in addition
as a declaration of presence; it's speech, nothing more - it may be reply
or affirmation or expostulation, interjection or query - there's always
the expectancy of the other, always something in return
>>/me says hello
Alan says hello - thus a performative, Alan performing in conjunction
with the assignation of the /me - the inclusion of action -
>>/me turns around
Alan turns around - the performative connected with a material action -
thus _in the virtual realm_ all actions are necessarily performatives -
this holding as well with programming - so that semantics are intended as
well - /me turns around always already ikonic - attend to this distinction
- just as the speaking above is also ikonic -
>>/echo it is raining out
it is raining out - here the language is itself the material substrate of
the world - the world constituted by language - if the /me indicates
process, the /echo indicates state - however
>>/echo the world burns
the world burns - and the state may well be a state-description of an
action whose performance is subtexted by the neutrality of the (re)quoted
expression 
here in virtuality all expressions are doubly or triply quoted -
in ytalk doubly quoted - i type, transmit, you read
elsewhere triply - i type, i read, transmit, you read - three different
instantiations - resonances - sheaves 
>>/echo it is raining out
it is raining out - the description of the world is already the state of
the world - however the /me in
>>/me is taking a walk - there is a separation - as in
me < is taking a walk - the expression is piped; in
>>/echo it is raining out - here the /echo is a modification on
it is raining out - as in e(it is raining out) - or as in
e(x)
x
whereas with /me thinks it is raining out - 
m(thinks it is raining out) > $n + thinks it is raining out - or as in
m(x) 
$n + x
as if there were the construction or constitution of a number series -
in any case the presence of the other - that is 
the name $n
as an adjunct or supplement to the string x. 
where does this lead - to three states - that of enunciation, that of
action, that of world-constituting language. if enunciation is declarative
- and one might consider an interpolated enunciation here as a shifter -
then action is performative - and it is echo, world-constituting language,
that becomes deeply problematic, in the sense that it is _separated from
intention, from speaker, from source_ - it is an emission above and within
the _face of the world, its alterity,_ within which it resides.
>>one might think of these languagings as modal; in which case echo 
references the foucauldian _divinatio,_ but only as index; in fact, echo 
is _in fact,_ the construal of the world as-if (vaihinger, bentham) there 
is no presencing, no intentional, no actor, no agency. in another similar 
sense, echo is the call of a shell command from a perl script; it is 
ulterior, an existential alterity, legible, readable, or not.<<

>>thus i call my book .echo, which acts subtly towards the material
completion of a constituted world, however fragile, however thinned (down
to the width of a pixel), .echo which reflects, not narcissus, but the
very grain of the separated and dismembered voice.<<

anatomy of world-semantics and messiness of desire


this time it was beginning with the interior of the sphere.
the camera wandered around the swollen form.
a closeup image of a breast with a swollen nipple was texture-mapped.
the mapping was set to .15 to spread the image across the interior.
contrast was set slightly high and brightness slightly low.
six lamps skewed to color filters were placed inside.
two circular sections were marked on the surface of the sphere.
these sections were scaled up and slightly outward from the surface.
two other sections were marked at right angles to the first two.
these sections were rotated and skewed and slightly indented.
everything was slightly awkward while the vertices were subdivided.
after several subdivisions the noise control was applied.
the noise was a variable dependent on the contrast of the texture-map.
over and over again noise was added to the sphere.
the nipple distended outward and the sphere was transformed.
duplicated nipples distended inward and the sphere became rougher.
over and over again noise pummeled the sphere.
over and over again protrusions and indentations followed the mapping.
smoothing was applied as much as possible and everything was joined.
the camera began its tilted motion around the internal surfaces.
it was as if a membrane stretched across the universe.
it was as if the universe were one of organs and skins.
organs and skins led to bodies elsewhere on the horizon.
nothing was visible beyond distentions and inundations.

there was just another time when a sphere and liquid sphere intersected.
the camera was outside in absolute darkness and vacuum.
six lamps skewed to colored filters were placed around the object.
the vertices on the sphere were subdivided and an image applied.
the image was of an open vagina and anus mapped onto a plane.
the mapping was set to .15 and cubic global with high contrast.
the image was darkened slightly and mapped across both surfaces.
the surfaces were independent but constituted the object.
the sphere was blown out and distorted with twisted circular patches.
the sphere was extended by selected vertices which were rebundled.
the rebundled vertices returned to the interior of the sphere.
the noise control was repeatedly applied to the sphere.
the anus and vagina began their uneasy work of indentation.
the surface became increasingly antagonized and difficult to perceive.
the camera was widened to 12 millimeters and a course was established.
the course of the camera grazed the surface of the object.
the object was constituted by the sphere, liquid sphere, and image.
the camera moved smoothly in a calculated flyover.
the flyover grazed the interior of the object.
the interior of the object refracted light and exterior texture.
the camera pulled back after scanning the asteroid almost in full.
you could tell the object was situated in uncanny space.
you could tell the object had more to offer.
the object was permanently flattened in the image.
this is what is called a "souvenir."

there was a time when ice and snow covered the surface of the sphere.
the sphere dripped in black-space as world-form.
it grew mountains and valleys with repeated granular noise.
the noise formed from the white ice on the blue ice.
six suns orbited the world.
the camera flew between the mountains and valleys and inside.
inside was a world of refracted ice and brilliant crystals.
the camera grazed the crystals and moved out into the black and cold.
o sphere huddled obsessively within the black and cold.
the camera withdrew leaving the sphere an object among none other.
from whence comes alterity in the midst of the fixity of worlds.
o we are all brothers and sisters but none here in emptied residue.
you are given license to remember the death and birth of worlds.
world, come forth.
brilliant stars reflected across surfaces huddling in pitch-black sky.
everything in nothing, we live in the "sheaf" of the world.

leaning back in languor, formal azure portrait, sullen, open.
as if against horizon of dark clouds, around carpet ornament and pillow.
the lighting odd, incandescent glimmer of flame playing upon the skin.
slightly blurred image, eyes to one side, the beginning of reverie.
image turned 90 degrees.
sphere created.
reverie continued, the upwelling and fragmenting of all things and names.
image texture-mapped onto sphere with .15 and no shift.
six lamps signaling.
noise applied 36 times.
continuation of reverie and inward emergence of thinking and thought.
still image of extruded image smoothed after severity upon severity.
torn jagged skin around legs, muted breasts, fury around carpet.
first thinking and then thought.
images of the fury of the polar regions of the distorted sphere.
images of the relative calm of the equatorial regions.
reverie of the heat of the destruction of names and languor.
leaning back in languor, formal azure portrait, sullen, open.

Nikuko told me:          

"You know You're a bad person. You've been a very bad person. You don't
want to be bad. You know when You misbehave. You don't want to. You don't
want to misbehave but You do. You feel sometimes out of control. You feel
You can't control when You misbehave. You don't have a story to tell. You
just want to say You don't want to be a bad person. You don't want to be
bad at all. You want to be good and kind and happy. You want to be happy
for myself and good and kind for others. You want to be good and kind to
others and not to be very bad. You can't help myself because You're very
interior-introspected. You don't know what You're doing a lot of the time
and that makes me bad. You have to know what You're doing. You know You're
not bad all the way down. You ignore other people's opinions. You ride
roughshod over everyone. You don't want to do this. You don't want to ride
roughshod at all. You want to listen and develop a real sense of patience
and consideration. You know this is hard to do but You will try better and
You always try. You know it doesn't help that You try but don't succeed.
You'll try to succeed. You've been a very bad person because You've hurt
people's feelings. You don't want to hurt people's feelings. You don't
think well of myself. You can hurt myself but You don't want to hurt other
people. You really don't. You want to be a good person. You want to be a
very good person."

From talk outline for York University, Toronto - March 8 2001

Four types of languaging on the Net in chat -
  a. declarative sentences - I'm here - which constitute the subject in
    terms of enunciation - which tend towards the cultivation of commun-
    ity - leadings-on, trailers - the "me too" response -
  b. performative sentences /me runs wild - which carry out constituted
    actions in narrative - this is dependent on interpretation
  c. performatives in relation to programming - states create an event -
    rollovers are also examples of this - independent of interpretation -
  d. .echo commands which are a dismemberment of enunciation and the 
    chain of language - they create abstracted conditions dependent on
    interpretation - there is no speaker (may be software or human gen-
    erated)

I employ each of these modes: b and c in live performance; a in text-based
work; d in thinking through world-making processes (such processes includ-
ing ontological creation and theory).

The name: What is the origin, consequence, performativity, "stickiness,"
of the proper name? Are names variables? Rigid designators? Residues of
the problematic of the real (grain of the voice, 'idiotic' real)?

The _infinite abacus_ and the relation of number to heaps and piles -
number as (extreme) convention and as (rigid) designation - the flux of
number. (distinction between analog and digital orders here - chaotic
orderings, etc. - show the measure geometry work?) -

choppy interruptions
lag constitutes the worse of these; the phenomenology of lag is based on
continuous breakdown of coherency, random hypertexting, constant text-
saving; one can't remember a thing!
physical interruptions of the to-do or the thing at hand: forgetting the
train one has set for oneself; whatever one remembers is replaced by new
communications/communal content.
interruptions occasioned by travel and its vicissitudes: the scenic
dominates the word, the visual over the subtle aurality of the text.
transformed patterns of sleep and diet: the body refuses to behave, is
constantly involved in setting and resetting times and nourishment. hard
to focus!
new interfaces and typing patterns, new keyboards and equipment: faced
with an unknown destination and fingers faltering at the outset, the need
to learn new commands, keystroke combinations, finger positions: ah, it is
all too much!
how can one be expected, how can one expect oneself, to write under such
difficult circumstances? can one even see the text one has, for a moment,
for just a moment, imagined? the word or phrase is more evanescent - if
such a thing be possible - than usual; one is always typing anew, as if
thought has just discovered the world.

would be abstract, to make material what would be sound, to make sound
what would be talking of talking of unknown things. all to have one word
like a language point or protolanguage, one thing shuffled against one
thing, sound like golden voice. how to make skin show through very thin
cloth and how to make sun double and there are ten suns. how to make ten
lights. how to make ten sounds and there are ten sounds. how to make pipes
of proper length and pitch of pipe. how to make scent. how to make touch
and odor. how to make smell. how to make heat and how to call heat away
from thin cloth and skin. how to know the metals. how to know wood. how to
know boys and girls and how to look at all men and women. i do love to
write like this so. it is a way and a means. it is a process and it is
never a goal. it is never a present and it is never a thing. it is never a
constitution. it is never an apparatus or an institution. it is never a
style. it is so just like this, word follows word, space just like i would
leave, said jennifer, between this telling and another. i will write this, 
said jennifer, and i will write another.

it is so very important, said lovely jennifer, that you do understand this
like a dream when you are thinking so very much about important things for
you, and you are making these important things. that you see soft slippers
of shadows everywhere from ten suns.

we are not a child, we are jennifer and nikuko, we are nikuko and alan, we
are very careful with our child ways and lovely talking.

we talk about the most important things, said jennifer. 

we are students in lovely school, she said.

brief note

in alphaville, it is the inertness of contemporary space. in blade runner,
the inertness ties to the interiority of the biological: replicants, like
humans, die. it is this parallel trajectory which defines the issues of
identity; if alphaville's paris is a displacement of the real, blade
runner's replicants carry the virus of the real's grain. they are just as
constituted, constructed, as the humans on the hunt - no more or less. i
want to emphasize this granularity or substance as fundamental to culture
and organism; origin and speciation in this regard are secondary.

this is the movement from modern to postmodern: the displacement of alpha-
ville tending towards the pervasive identities of blade runner's inhabita-
tions. neither are productions of terminal identity - both are character-
ized by alterities which are both familiar and absorbed as the same.

anti-codework


hide the uninteresting code; textured meta-levels are icons of the future,
greater and lesser worlds: build worlds, worldings: hide the code which
only obscures semantic flows. think of this _text_ as a _world_ speaking
and spoken-for; ignore the letters and their mappings: focus on the
presence of a white dress and sullen face before you on the path; ignore
the syntactics leading to the scene of the lurid blood-red room; focus on
tumescent bodies everywhere for the taking. code articulates the falsity
of cartesian-aristotelian truths, truth-tables; it constructs, emerges,
from proprietary etiquette, summarized knowledge and knowledge-owners,
programmers and heroic hackers. focus on the faces, mouths open, pouting
lips, as your sullen face turns slowly, as you descend the path; imagine
the path; descend into the room below. {focus on blurred truths, blurred
faces; focus on truth's absence; on the scents and odors; focus on the 
smells.}

what is the author saying?

why does she hate codework so?

"Making Skin"


I'll tell you one thing! It's a lot easier picturing skin-making machinery
than actually running the stuff! Give a touch here and there to the dermal
baths, add a couple of special fx, soften the whole thing, harden bits and
pieces, and you've got it! I don't see the attraction, but it's yours for
the looking! redirect < Curing-Pan:Curing-Pan

One picture's called "Nikuko's Skin Assembly" and it's just that. Add a
little, take a little. The other's called "Fury" and shows the whole
robotics at work, liquid bath and all. You can almost feel the dampness of
the cheek, hardness of the ankle, softness of the breast, whatever you
want!

With the Fury, you've got to be careful where the holes are drilled. It's
a lot easier in the Skin Assembly - just think of a featureless plain.
There's time enough for additions later on!

The Crayfish

Ponge, Lautreamont, Micheaux, among others. The crayfish is an extraordin-
ary creature, numerous appendages and legs moving in a flawless subsump-
tion architecture, surely guided by a hierarchy of goals and motivations.  
Thus the lesser aid the greater; the lower, the higher; the followers, the
avant-garde. What goes before all, those enormous claws raised on occasion
with the intent warning or other display, at times flailing half-heartedly
in the water, a form of seduction, a lure. It eats peas. It crawls in the
middle of the night to the top of the rock to wave those claws. It preys
to gods as numerous as its feet. Its body flutters constantly - then
stills - then sways to inner music. It is bright read. A small sharkfish
has become friends, or at least entered into an agreement; both inhabit,
at times simultaneously, the same overturned cup, without danger. So far,
there are no broken bones or carapaces. The crayfish is an uncanny animal.  
It is imaginary. It resides on the edges of others' dreams. This enables
its survival. One can assume, as I do, that it is constantly underfoot. It
is fashioned from the chthonic. It is the opposite of the abject; it
preens. It is often irritable and I desire, more than anything else, to
give it pleasure. In such a fashion it will exist quietly, no longer an
emanant of nightmares, a harbinger of deja-vu, ill-will, remonstrance. It
is clear that I will exit before it will, that my carapace, of my making,
is fit for rendering, but not for inhabitation. The crayfish by proxy is
the most intense creature in this world, unknowingly gathering the thought
and desires of everything around it. It rests on the tips of its feet, and
proceeds through the murk on errands of enunciation, announced only by
environment, not by presence. In its inability to speak, lies, for us, a
refusal of the deepest sort. We read upon the carapace such delicacy in so
many limbs and extensions. It watches out of desire and fear; prey
emerges, emergent.

some parmenides


some boys come out of the right side of the womb and some girls out of the
left. their limbs wander. somewhere the mind's in the mix. whatever
thinks, is the mix. whatever the mix is, it thinks. some boys and some
girls are rooted in water. whatever the earth is, moonlight looks to sun.
there's a problem if the seeds don't mix. then the mind's not there, seeds
clash, everything doubles. when they double there are some boys and some
girls. then when they mix, they think of fighting. their limbs wander and
they come out [looking at] the moon. then they are the moon. then they
look to sun. then they go back in.

the moon doesn't belong here. take away the light. the moon is foreign. i
can't see myself in the moon. look at it there. it's somewhere else. it's
uncomfortable here. it doesn't mix.

thinking is mixing. mixing is being and from being come all things. they
remain there because of the mixing. there are no things without being.
things, welcome being! being, the mother of all things. things, behold
being! [your things] are being things.

turning back when things are and are not, mix left and right. there are no
things and no turning back. there are no things that are not and are, mix
right and left. in the center there is no center. 

if it is coming together, it is serrated edges. if it is scattering, it is
loosening. if it is gathering, it is fleeing. if it is fleeing, it is
mixing. if it is gripping it is holding, if it is holding it is releasing.
if it is carrying it is moving, if it is carrying, it is speaking.

what is not, is not for you to know. what is not, within the mix, is for
you to know in the mix. what is not, is an empty path. to mix the path, to
find out from the mirror what is to know. what is to know is not to be
known, is useless to be known, is not knowing. knowing is knowing what is
not, knowing is that empty paths are most traveled.

when you ride the chariot, the axles heat, the axles turn red-hot, they
are heated by the sun within them, the day before them, the night behind.
when the axles turn red-hot, the doors open on their copper jambs, the
hinges are well-turned, the doors turn on their hinges, the grooves in the
road are set, the chariot wheels forward within them, the chariot moves
ahead, i am greeted by night and day, moon and sun, sea and ocean, earth
and island. for what one is within the other, the other is within the one.

there are some boys and some girls on the left and right of the chariot.
where the chariot wanders, within the body the womb also wanders. there
are some boys and some girls on the right and left of the axle. do not
feed them, they are turning the axle. they move the chariot forward. the
chariot creaks forward, the axles turn, red-hot, do not touch the axle.
the chariot shudders and moves by grooves set in the road of stone by
generations. it moves between the lintels of the doors, between the posts
of the doors. it moves slightly to the left and slightly to the right. it
moves between the doors and enters.

[everything is called 'night and day,' everything is filled with 'night
and day,' night is thinking, day has its share of emptiness, everything is
called 'everything.']

here in the city, there are more bricks than humans, cast-off and rusted
iron hanging from roofs and lintels. any falling object certainly would
kill the delicate inside-out flesh walking beneath them. everyone tends
the crayfish, hiding out until the middle of the night, emerging slowly
with clumsy and close-to-weightless carapace, bottom-crawling. the
shakuhachi is kept in a closed and plastic world, an evaporation-dish
nearby. the fish are fed thrice daily; the cat, twice. the plants are
watered twice or thrice weekly, the large opuntia cleaned monthly, the
guitars reglued twice yearly, the piccolo oiled thrice yearly, shakuhachi
oiled every third month. the piccolo is swabbed after every use, the
shakuhachi as well. the computer is cleaned thrice weekly, the books
weekly, the television set twice weekly. teeth are brushed thrice daily;
the body showers daily. the fish fry are fed twice daily; the stairs are
swept twice yearly. i take pills twice daily, the computer is defragged
monthly, disks cleaned up twice monthly. portable batteries are recharged
twice a month, the pocket computer is recharged daily, the laptop is
recharged twice monthly. the aquarium is cleaned every six weeks, my hair
is cut once every two months, my nails are trimmed twice monthly, my
guitar tuned twice monthly, email answered five times daily, cache emptied
once daily, software upgraded once monthly, teeth examined twice yearly,
body examined twice yearly, blood taken three times yearly, computers
upgraded every two years, aquarium filter changed every two months, floor
vacuumed every three weeks, facial hair shaved daily, pubic hair cut
yearly, dishes washed every two days, refrigerator de-iced twice yearly,
curating events once monthly, napping twice daily, making love four or
five times weekly, sleeping once daily, eating twice daily, reading five
times daily, talking ten times daily, writing four times daily, taping,
practicing music; it's a miracle bricks and iron take so long in downward
plunge.

([{}]) (blurring the distinctions)



"Difference, being of the nature of relationship, is not located in time 
or in space. We say that the white spot is 'there,' 'in the middle of the 
blackboard,' but the difference between the spot and the blackboard is not 
'there.' It is not in the spot; it is not in the blackboard; it is not in 
the space between the board and the chalk. I could perhaps lift the chalk 
off the board and send it to Australia, but the difference would not be 
destroyed or even shifted because difference does not have location.

"When I wipe the blackboard, where does the difference go? In one sense, 
the difference is randomized and irreversibly gone, as 'I' shall be gone 
when I die. In another sense, the difference will endure as an idea - as 
part of my _karma_ - as long as this book is read, perhaps as long as the 
ideas in this book go on to form other ideas, reincorporated into other 
minds. But this enduring karmic information will be information about an 
imaginary spot on an imaginary blackboard." (Gregory Bateson, Gregory 
Bateson's Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity.)

Perhaps it is in the nature of this particular difference to lie within
the imaginary, within an intentionality that fulfills a demarcative struc-
ture or domain: like all difference, it opens to continuous potential, to
worlds of fantasy, projection, introjection. Let us not stop with Austral-
ia; let us include, Japan, Mars, the depths of the ocean, the interiority
of the quark, the swimmerets of Jean-Paul the crayfish. I would argue that
meaning comes first, difference later - or that both are inextricable. As 
difference slips from tally-board to concept, entity slips from red-dust 
and sinter to constitutionality. 

Let us think further of difference as carried, much as numbers are carr- 
ied in addition or subtraction: leaping among columns. Then distance so 
easily slides from this _particular_ difference to all difference, all 
within the imaginary, that is, all constituted by the nub or slightest 
anomaly detected or created by organisms immersed in always already sym- 
bolic flow. Here is translation into information, 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0, or in 
a scheme which I worked out years ago, (0-1)0-(1-0)1, a hierarchy of 
transforms. If difference is a consideration of temporality, it breaks 
from strict logic, although memory may be carried as well, and there are 
temporal logics. And what difference isn't, in the process of becoming- 
difference? One moves uneasily among logical/hierarchical schema and im- 
mersive counterparts - among substances and organisms sloughing into and 
throughout ones and others.

A difference is that which makes a difference; what makes a difference, 
makes it to one or another organism; what is the property of reading, but 
the acknowledgment and presentification of difference. All else is the 
non-purity of the mirror, the no-mirror and no-mind; difference itself 
defers; deconstruction clutters (clatters). Not in Australia, this book, 
hard to come by, exists in pristine condition; I would put out a call for 
the author.

And imagine, for example, the mark on the board as a zero, encircling Jor-
dan curve, slightly raised from the surface, characterized as dust in the
first and last place, the board a slate, archaic: I imagine sea anenomes
or even stromatolites - why not - leaving their traces. Is a difference a
distinction without an observer? Years ago I wrote about landscapes, to
imagine one without a viewpoint, perspective - an absolute landscape, not
with infinite holographic positionings, but none at all: most of the uni-
verse surely is without a witness.

What happens to difference then? Surely, without a witness...

Back here - around the corner, down the street - What goes on in locked
cells? For whom? What inscriptions? (Does difference need maintenance, a
database? The phenomenology of the witness requires a degree of stability, 
quietude, modes of dissemination.)
