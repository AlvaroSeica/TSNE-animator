the idiotic poverty of pain

because there's so little to say about pain, you're always thumping up 
against that, a sort off surface which gives way, but only within a 
limited compliance, after a while one wants to slither, one wants to move, 
to move, into projections of images or fantasies, or holographic universes 
on the edges of the surface, you can consider the surface in the same way 
as you can consider the bangu, the drum, as you can consider the surface 
as the surface of pain, with the center where the harshness occurs, and 
then reading the skin, reading the skin on the outside of the drum, and 
then leaving the drum altogether and go elsewhere, the sound that goes 
elsewhere, so, moving from there, after a while, pain then reveals itself, 
as does death, as an ultimate poverty, idiotic, nothing left but null 
signifiers always already collapsed, because everything becomes the same 
token, everything becomes the same dissolution or decay of the proton, so 
what is left is not even substance, one moves away then to embrace, or 
catch or catapult oneself, or corral, the image or imaginary that appears 
on the outside of the curvature of the drum, it's there that sound mean- 
ders into form, embraces the subject, brings hir back alive

with reverb/resonance out of control, sound is transformed from speech to 
murmur, and murmur to the resonance of the world. everything that is 
spoken is spoken-for; here, everything is reversed, and what is spoken-for 
is no longer discernible as speech. every hollow carries its own signature 
within it, and every hillock registers the sky. i think of ululations 
within the discomfort of the throat, someone might ask of hirself, what is 
my throat doing

totally new oud music

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ouddd.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/oudddd.mp3

listen carefully, on the longer one a string keeps slipping,
have to tune it. 

this is the most introverted music so far. influenced by shakuhachi.
the new oud is very resonant, 6.5mm at the 5th which is high, so i've
had to adapt. the result is a different kind of music. quite happy
with these; the worst things are in the world, the clearer and more 
abrupt the music. and that's all that will survive of course. if that.



i did hear that:
i appear ravaged.
this must stop. 
i know i will be murdered.
my work is sound, its fury.
what is visible has been killed.
i am dead from them.
i am dead to them.
therefore i appear ravaged.

the aesthetics of pain

http://www.alansondheim.org/battleship.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/battle.mp4

what occurs on flatness never curls inward towards the body: that is 
unless a fundamental identification is at work. nothing of the sort in 
futurism which is responsible for the clean and proper body of the 
Mac and Apple, the sliver that cuts through flesh, everything acceptable, 
horror against against horror in false topologies, topographies of 
destroyed villages, torn flesh, mutilated faces. it is all one and it is
all one and the same: too many deaths, and too many deaths.

just to make it clear: these aren't _notes,_ this is _labor_ purposed
for slowing or scraping the flesh trying to think, what? about the 
damage we cause in the world, about the damage the world is caused.



last night at Eyebeam... a revelation...

http://www.alansondheim.org/sexdeath.mp4

sex, yes... and death, yes... are inextricably entangled...
am i the first to notice this, Agave? they're both 
hard to swallow, and yes, surely i'm the first to call
orgasm the 'little death' which only grows with a thud
into the big One? every point i make is broken with delight
against the corpse of sex, the messy spew of death. wait
a minute, there's more, all sorts of things of bones
growing after the brain stops, what sort of ugly repeating
shatters geometries into the semblance of Becoming?

hasapi threnody

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/indo2.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/indo3.mp3

the hasapi is a fretless Indonesian instrument with two strings;
mine are tuned in unision. the first two pieces are played with
picks, and the third, with fingers only, resulting in a softer
sound. it can be extremely difficult to play, if one uses double
stops, harmonics, and other techniques, some borrowed from pipa
or even flamenco.

is really good and I hope you have the patients to enjoy it,
it's "my hasapi song" and I worked on it, thank you.

i'm so sorry it's a wmv but something must play it, I know
VLC will do nicely. and it's from my webcam!!! which some

day and night

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/shehnainight.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/shehnaiday.mp3

at Eyebeam i work in a hall, not of mirrors, but of social resonances; 
everything tends towards social media. yet pain, death, the harrowing of 
the hospice, is always solitary, always turned inward; it is for others to 
make what they can of the remaining skein of objects and memories, the 
conversation obliterating the name which has always already been 
inconceivably fragile. so i place and play these comments, in the midst of 
almost-being, in places that might be visible, might provoke a response 
among the living. there's no economy at work here; the economy of death is 
already the economy of life under another name. there's breathing, and 
keeping breathing, and keeping sound and trope for a moment or for this 
moment or sound and trope for an other. the shehnai dies with me but the 
sound is what was happening when fingers and lungs moved or acted, as if 
under agency, as if we were all agents among sound, world, and word.

All I can do, now, among the living, is hold back, retard, retain, bring 
the development of a moment to a halt, which never halts, but appears, as 
if making an appearance, as such; this is the moment where the flesh, the 
abject, the breath, is manifest, the body falters in being alive, and 
virtuality, inscription, prosthetics, disappear, replaced by nothing, 
except substance, raw tissue, unstriated flesh, no bones, no bounds. The 
Zen Oxherding series ends in the flesh, not in the same, but the same 
which has been bridged by death, which has already occurred. This, our 
deadness, is difficult to imagine, to image; it is the Vishuddhimagga not 
of the social, not of the Other, not of the other or the one; it is the 
Vishuddhimagga of nothing. It has arrived, it has been arriving, it will 
have been arriving. So then there is the action that springs from the side 
or the dome of the bangu drum or the shehnai played without the bell, as 
among the Batak in the threnody of death. What is this action, but our 
senses annihilated by flesh; and through this annihilation, this utter, 
then there is the possibility for the social, for turning-towards, for a 
conversant as this is a conversant. Conversant as such is always forgotten 
and is then such. It is the turning as such.

The turning, that is the social, it is our obligation to recognize the 
virtual for what it is, inscription, capital, quantification, that these 
sorts of descriptions or truths are irrelevant in the face of alterity, 
which is increasingly turning towards slaughter, disease, the monstrous. 
It is fundamental that we are _not wired,_ that our prosthetic tools, 
electronics, transform into flesh, and thereby may signal the social. But 
the transform into flesh, which is what 'this blog,' 'this Eyebeam' is 
about, must occur. Or rather should occur. Or perhaps there is the 
possibility of an occurrence; the imperative must, should, disappear, 
effacing the very nature of rules, of the Rule. Then pain and death are 
given, among us, a presence, and an action, any action, what one might 
think of about or around or through pain and death. And then and not only 
then.

Psych

Well, since I've been on the residency - which deals with pain, wounding, 
death, sexuality, and the virtual - I've also been dealing with the death 
of my father, embezzlement, flooding, death of my thesis-advisor/friend, 
and family split-up. So tonight we watched Psych, a popular/satirical 
television program about a detective pair who solve crimes. So tonight my 
downstairs neighbor came back; at noon he had had an auto-accident in 
which his neck was broken, so he was in a heavy brace; the other driver 
was taken away in a stretcher. So my neighbor has amnesia about the whole 
incident which occurred four blocks from where I'm typing this, and Azure 
and I and another neighbor went out to solve the case. We took an 
infra-red camera and found 150' tracks across a major avenue indicating 
the other vehicle had been traveling at an untoward rate of speed. We 
found the bumper and front-end of the car indicating it struck my 
neighbor's vehicle most likely from the front, on the right-hand side. We 
found the license-plate and other clues. We photographed everything in 
flash, in normal night-light, in infra-red. And we're almost certain our 
neighbor, who can't remember anything, isn't at fault. What's fascinating 
about this is his state, which is one of shock that I think is masking the 
pain, and the oddly detective-oriented investigation we conducted, 
checking out the skid marks, noticing where there was a sudden bend in 
them in the middle of the intersection, working the case; our neighbor 
will wake in pain, hopefully the other driver on the stretcher is okay, 
Psych has nothing on us but the music, but we've got the photographs of 
something real and violent that happened, more pain, more wounding, more 
thought for the Eyebeam residency. I will read more James Ellroy. He 
knows. In the meantime I've been listening to Batak (Toba) funeral songs 
which are the most powerful I've heard; I've discovered my hasapi is also 
a shaman staff, playing in depth into my state of mind. Hopefully back to 
sexuality, even though that organizes itself, repeatedly, around organs 
and bodies, lines of sight, and blankness where a detective might come in 
handy, spoiling everything, spoiling the goods. We're quiet in the 
building; our friend is most likely in pain. (on the Eyebeam blog)

(oh, and we interviewed a witness as well, in the middle of the night)

listening to the dead

Blog entry listening to the dead has been created.
View

So how do we listen to the dead? The dead have spoken over wires laid 
across long distances, the wires picking up the 'dawn chorus' of very low 
frequency (vlf) radio, that appears around 4 a.m. in the morning. I think 
WWI field telephones were susceptible. In NYC the problem is the power 
grid; we're contaminated by radiation from all directions (as Marko has 
pointed out). You might find a silent spot somewhere inside your 
apartment, but you'd need a Faraday cage to weed out the electromagnetic 
buzz - and then you'd have your dead zone, but no dead. So you want to 
record signals that are either on top of the 60 hz buzz, or that appear if 
and when the buzz is canceled out. I picked up faint crackles at one 
point in Brooklyn with the magnetic field antenna at a particular 
orientation. There's also the possibility of going out somewhere on one of 
the piers - but the grid follows you there, follows you everywhere.

The dead are drowned out.

The dead are unbelievably drowned out; they're subject to the violence of 
Lyotard's differend - there's no recourse where and when there's no 
communication.

They have to be coaxed back in.

They're deaf to the coaxing.

You'd have to set up the apparatus in spite of them, without their 
presence, without texting them. You'd have to surround them where they're 
not, where they don't exist. You'd have to ignore their absence.

Think hungry ghosts or red dust in Times Square. That's what you have to 
deal with.

So it's a matter of projection and belief that they're present at all. 
They're not going to help you on this journey.

They don't know you're traveling. They couldn't care less. It's of no 
concern to them. They're obliterated by the power grid, by the machinery, 
even the hatching of sparks as steel strikes steel perhaps somewhere deep 
underground. They know about the radio.

They know about the radio. They know something's amiss. Digital television 
holds no interest for them, angry buzzing in need of interpretation, more 
machinery. They get the radio. You're waiting, writhing, writing your 
wires above-ground, under-ground; you're loading them up, the coils, 
amplifiers, power sources. You want to use crystal radio, but at these 
frequencies, the frequencies of the dead, better ignore the huge antennas, 
better deal with something lean and portable. You want to feed the 
signals.

You want to feed the signals into something starting small, then 
expanding. You need power for that, batteries that don't add alternating 
current, sine-waves for example, to the noise everywhere. Then you'll feed 
into digital or analog, you'll save everything for analysis. You'll save 
everything for the listening of it, which is the meaning of listening to 
the dead - it will take a while, it's not going to happen all at once.

What is it in the middle of the night that you feel, this huge pressure 
against you, holding you back and paralyzed against the sheets, pressure 
and the word of pressure, they so much want to tell you, want this speech, 
this one word of pressure, always misinterpreted? You feel you can't get 
anywhere with this, the misery of it.

Then you remember what you heard, years ago, 
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/dawnchorus.mp3 and they were coming 
towards you from that time on, they knew that you knew, they've been 
waiting ever since.

noise, in music

Thinking about last night, it's the noise in music that's the music. If 
you're playing makamat, you've got history on your side, you've got 
sequences, grace-notes, referencings, dynamics, everything that makes the 
music; what you don't have is automation. Or think of Casals' cello bow 
sounds, sax/flute breathing in; it's everywhere. It's the body among other 
things. The noise isn't noise per se; it's shaped, it's what creates the 
fractal, chaotic, and accumulative aspects of improvisation (forget the 
reference here, bit blurry at the moment). All of these things are 
connected, interwoven with culture, with cultures, and the interweaving is 
what made me quit for example 'playing the blues' early on; there's a kind 
of inertia in me that believes it's impossible to go there, wherever there 
might be, in a kind of fullness I'd find necessary to even make the 
initial steps. It's the noise on the line that was interpreted as the 
speaking of the dead; it's the noise on the line I try to clear out, in 
order to hear the cosmic noise of aurora, lightning, magnetosphere, 
particles, and so forth. That noise is quieter like the background 
microwave radiation, that RCA engineers first thought was noise on the 
line as well. Your noise is my information; Henri Michaux couldn't hear 
most of the music he heard in A Barbarian in Asia. All of this is an 
endless pit; the point is, that it isn't a pit but literally a 
playing-field. Think of ragas and their complexity in time and space and 
musical history, even the history of musical instruments. In this sense, 
the subtlety of the digital lies, among other things, in its paring-away 
at culture (think electric fretted guitars and guitar synthesizers, and 
non-western scales), things disappearing before their appearance, new 
things appearing before their disappearance, a kind of hi-jacking of 
culture occurring on a world-wide scale. At this point it's not even 
necessarily a kind of colonialist or post-colonialist leverage; it just 
is, and appears natural as any landscape filled with technological 
radiations.

I'm blurry, writing this all wrong, but there's a kernel of truth to it, 
something obdurate in the memory of disappearance.

Thinking about anti-social media 2.0... perhaps an installation about or 
re: recent deaths, future death, hidden in Eyebeam superstructure? 
performers hiding out in building, performing only after-hours? leaving 
small images/debris/residuals/artifacts in corners (each corner trihedral 
reflections of selves interrupted), momentary gestures, peripheral, almost 
invisible, after hosted events, strange rooftop images visible from space 
only, everything unwired, locative in the sense of substance, scattered 
debris for example, as if something had happened, an accident, rumors 
spread only by word of mouth, nothing electronic, the street knows...

something to this, residencies for examples, residence, where's your 
residence, I live at such-and-such an address...

suddenly the Eyebeam resident disappears, taking up Eyebeam as residence, 
you can't evict me, no no no! don't bring in the SWAT team, I'll leave 
peacefully...

of course nothing happening but the street knows...

and there are these things, peripheral, slightly out of focus, as if 
something were going on...

1914, his mother died very shortly after, the world went into flames, has 
continued along the same path. So everything, Derrida, Lacan, Jack Benny, 
falls apart, falls out, I continue to work not with _those_ references, 
but in new currents, until something withdraws, draws me back. It's too 
simple to think of the past as stories, that what one ultimately offers is 
stories, that these go the ways of mourning, lamentation, pain, death 
itself. As if we're continuously walking wounded. I'm tired of this; I 
want to work new for another twenty years at least. Memorials throw me 
back into pasts that gnaw away at my soul, with the appetition of souls as 
so many Barthian puncta, grasping away. It's all fiction. Tonight I was 
given a sheaf of pages from a scrapbook or photobook of myself at ages 
maybe 1-2 until 7, black and white museum pieces with my father smiling at 
me, openly in a way I cannot remember. Everything dates the images, which, 
analog, breathe with an other's air/heir; they crawl over me, and I cannot 
look at them directly, only askew. This memorial lasts four days, the day 
of arrival, the day of business and organization, the memorial proper, the 
day of leaving. The reading of the Torah begins anew during this same 
period, Simchat Torah, Friday the 21st, as if in preparation for the 
Shabbat. I need this renewal myself, this beginning of a beginning, not my 
own, not my beginning of the end as death is always making that beginning, 
something however otherwise. What am I saying here? That on the fifth day, 
the Monday morning I am meeting Monika Weiss to begin thinking concretely 
of a mobile installation/performance/video/workshop at Eyebeam, that this, 
for me, as to be as an infant, without the weight we may be leaving 
behind. And oddly it might be my father's smile, which was lost on me 
early on, that could create an uneasy resurrection, a false past, that 
gives me momentary grace.

In any case, the litany of names, Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, Roland 
Barthes, must cease, not seize.

I am murmuring against or through the in-corporation of Eyebeam, with a 
sense of wonder based on any and every architecture, corners reflecting 
perfectly, hiding places full of magic, the smiles of the demons within 
us.

errors
Blog entry errors has been updated.

errors

there are none today. they may appear here, but so far i have eluded them. 
it is errors that ruin my work, that bring it to a halt, that make me 
appear incompetent, that put words into my mouth, that remove words from 
my mouth. the errors are of spelling, homonyms, syntax gone astray, 
pronouns with confused antecedents. the errors corrode the text; i'll 
never be understood (they seem to say) because i'm incapable of removing 
them, circumscribing them, keeping them beyond the pale. they wound the 
text. the cicatrix never appears because nothing ever changes. one, a 
reader, puts out tendrils as if meaning could be encompassed, could 
encompass, in such a fashion. but errors tend to hid; they appear through 
their disappearance, hiding beneath or elsewhere than one or another 
spell-check program. in other words, they change sense, senselessly, and 
because they remain undiscovered, those words are put in my mouth and they 
won't come out again in this or any other lifetime.

oh, these errors ruin everything! stupid stupid! i appear stupid! it 
doesn't do any good to insist: i'm not! this would have been elsewise than 
i have been in the process of text! of speech! of inscription that denies 
me the brilliance i know is rightfully mine!




memorial for my father, third day


the emptied house which is never empty
the scars sleeping for decades,
of literacy and legibility, i read
everything into signs, signs swallowed
signs, and

everything contained, was contained
mold and seepage made breathing difficult
the house lay in low iambic

the house flexed with flood and mining
with repairs curled round itself,
and so emptied, this annihilation will
never return, hurtful sensibilities
of fossils where sleeping and crawling down,
stairs returning and inscribing motion
which would be the telling of it, the framing, 
some might say the last of it, some might say
framing unlasts

sleep lock leave

http://www.alansondheim.org/memorial239.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/memorial246.jpg

the house locking out, locking up,
memorials leave imprints like fossils.
1.shadows of the bed where i slept in my childhood,
2.shadow of the table at the corner of the bed:
the green table where i kept a photograph
of a hydrogen explosion, 
of one of the eisenhowers,
of a united nations diplomat.

leaving, last words spoken.
i could walk this house with my eyes closed.
what's left is the phenomenology of space 
and its corners eaten by mold.
untoward cocoons ravage the phenomenology.

mold corrals health, circumscribes breath.
and the woozy head can't think this phenomenology.

--

* the last day, when memory ends.
we retreat from the ashes like leaving a village in germany.
we have our names there under erasure. we call ourselves
annihilation.



on good days

i dream of hitler youth and grey soviet masses
i dream of nameless american troops and everywhere people marching
i dream of jagged assyrian warriors and batak sacrifices
everyone i know is deeply anonymous and wrecking
i dream of salvage and wrecking and dams holding back debris
i dream of walking in collapsed buildings and furious suicides
on good days i dream of drownings and medicated deaths
i dream police-tape barriers holding back the artifices of destruction
i dream of those artifices
on good days i dream of names in ash and broken mouths and screams
everyone i know is broken and everything is going under
on good days i dream this crime will be solved



quietude

http://www.alansondheim.org/quietude.mp4

meandering paths among heaps and stones slow streamings, quietude murmurs 
of pebble movement who is counting here who knows the names,
house around the corner, talked, read. beyond that, quiet, quietude. 
all gods are smoothed, all gods are filled with the quietude of rustlings, 
meandering paths among heaps and stones slow streamings, quietude murmurs
all gods are smoothed, all gods are filled with the quietude of rustlings
of the language of words and their talisman and of death, quietude and
hearth of quietude, silence to place

exuding infinite quietude. all silence, words are not better than...
be silent

for i am speaking of quietude, the grace of being, contemplation,
the quietude of familiality, the space where everything is
produce (julu) or reproduce (jennifer), her death a quietude, that
she is already sounding tired, retired, of a quietude, i don't know her
world as one of threshold logics, maintenance. 

andthink of the quietude and slow streamings, and quietude
and quietude, and modes of dissemination
and none, empty, quietude of leaden skies...

quietude against incandescent horizons, interference in quietude or flux
in the world, and to the potential quietude at the heart of it, not-doing
of the language of words and their talisman and of death, quietude of
han shan, meandering paths among heaps and stones slow streamings, 
quietude murmurs of pebble movement, who is counting here who knows the 
names in utter desperation

all gods are smoothed, all gods are filled with the quietude of rustlings, 
for a moment of grace for quietude and deepest sleep,
fitting in with the quietude, i'd be around the corner, 
in utter desperation,
for a moment of grace, for quietude and deepest sleep



Sounds of Eyebeam: Analog to Digital

recording made with Westinghouse vibration mic fed into mono Marantz
cassette recorder; the result was downloaded into Audacity and edited
in CoolEdit. Different versions above have different filtering. 

Analog was used to avoid digital issues between the mic and recorder.
The sound was gathered at a number of sites in Eyebeam, most of them
involving metal grids: stairways, interior fencing, upper-level 
flooring. The result was a gathering of resonances between metal, 
Eyebeam-body (interior space), and sounds transmitted either in air
or directly through metal. The harmonic structures are strong and
dissonant. The body cries out in murderous delight.

Down the street, an 18-wheeler is gathering up the disassembled
Matthew Barney work. Such heavy metal would have collapsed with a
thud. Elsewhere lighter-than-air work delights the blue-grey sky
and rain is forecast. The Eyebeam building is singing everywhere.
It is singing

You can't catch me.
You can't catch me.

On Being Dead / On My Deadwork / My Work is Dead


Deadwork is invisible work; deadwork is virtual work. When there is 
nothing but the image and the memory of the image, there is deadwork. When 
the producing tribe cannot read, can only reinterpret, there is deadwork. 
Deadwork does not enter the cycle of capital; it no longer exists; it 
never has existed. Deadwork is deadly work; it is the death of the 
producing culture. The culture knows it. The culture is ready for its 
death.

My work is dead. It is not spoken. It is invisible in the building at 
Eyebeam and disappears as a future anterior online. In the space, it 
huddles. In the space it hides in cracks in crevices, in the remains of an 
s/m parlor perhaps, in the remains of a parking garage perhaps, in the 
remains if a silent film studio perhaps. The building is scarred; my work 
devolves, unscars, dissolves. It is a shadow on a scar. It is the huddle 
beneath the cicatrice.

If hug is a hut, it is also a huddle, memories huddle. It is the hulk of 
memories in the huddle, the hull carrying forth the moon into the day. The 
moon huddles in the wane of day; the moon is a building, is a shadow of a 
scar. The moon is deadwork; we move into space to bear witness to the 
shadows. We are the inconceivable of life. We are neither remnant nor 
residue; we are its remainder.

The remainder of life is its divisor. It what occurs after the _cleave._ I 
have meant to write about the cleave, to devolve it. When the windmill 
generator cleaves the sky, you say that nothing is cut, nothing 
disappears, and a pretty picture. But blades cleave hulls of birds and 
birds die; birds die everywhere. In the cleaving of the birds we do our 
deadwork.

For work to live it must be a word; it must be a spoken word. A spoken 
word is acknowledged, it is communal. Deadwork is dead language; it 
participates in the 'might as well,' 'might as well disappear,' 'might as 
well not be there,' 'might as well collapse the building and the culture 
that produced it.' The word is a world that inheres to violence; the word 
cleaves. The word cleaves itself; always suicidal, it is always under 
erasure, always dis-appearing. It is the appearance of disappearance and 
that is why words are uncanny, why poetry is uncanny, why a scream 
cleaves... and is uncanny.

My work is dead; it is unreadable, tends towards an uncanny death, begu, 
the dead soul. It struggles for a home, for the pronunciation of an other, 
an other mouth. I imagine fingers tracing in the air. I imagine 
heterogeneity. It disappears; it goes away; it's gone.

But my work is dead; it pronounces. It is part of speech, grammar. It is a 
category and it is not particular. By this it means it will announce, 
anywhere and anytime. It refuses distinction (beyond the elementary 
particles) (beyond dark matter); it is always collapsing. The building is 
always collapsing but the building is a hearth where hearts murmur and 
beings are born. Deadwork is an opposite; it is always dying. It insists, 
insists on life (like a young child) (like a brat); it burns for this 
life. But there isn't much time left and it's dead, yes, and dying.

I am Nikuko and I am Jennifer and I am Alan and I am Julu and these are my
words and they are _canny._

The truth is, you're reading dead words on a dead screen, and there's

dance


we just came back from a dance discussion event at the 92nd Street Y in 
Manhattan. why are dancers so optimistic? the topic was dance education 
and everyone was excited. there were videos and photographs that were also 
cheering. I keep thinking of the opposite, of the depressive constructs of 
my own work, its self-indulgent wallowing, its emphasis on _this_ body as 
opposed to a communal or healing body. virtuality drives me to this 
position, reality drives me elsewhere. is slaughter - of humans, animals, 
plants, cultures, languages - the only conceivable future horizon? in the 
long term all of this */he waves his arms around in an all-encompassing 
gesture/* will disappear; information itself will dissipate to the 
substance of irreconcilable differences. what then? what will happen to 
these dances, these complex choreographies, these histories of somatic 
knowledge, these very ancestries? where are the ancestors who will hear 
us, who will answer us, who will keep the universe alive? where are they? 
where are they? */he raises his arms in supplication/*

distractions

http://www.alansondheim.org/distractions.mp3 (oud)

a repeated song or figure, while i am being distracted
by images and issues of muscle tone, my mind tend towards
continuous repair and corralling the figures that are
produced in this piece, repeatedly, that is to say, with
variations, or losing track, backing up, so that this is
THE MIND AT WORK and quite possibly as a result the best
piece of music/soundwork i have produced, one in which
the MIND'S HEART itself is audible, the working through
the fantastic, circumlocutions, working through THOUGHT
ITSELF which is negated, not allowed to proceed, that is
REFUSED PROCEDURE, as if i could allow myself, give
myself permission towards or encompassing NO-MIND, which
is unavailable, but the beauty of this is, you are a 
WITNESS TO ME as you have never been before, and along
with this, a WITNESS TO ALL HUMANITY as we reach the
uncanny sum of SEVEN BILLION, A SPECIES IN VIOLENT AND

virtual worlds


they get stuck in this life and yearn to return to the other

they are held back by memory and skin which falls from their seasons

they cannot move but are made from layers torn from their flesh

you are stuck in pain, you are held back, you cannot move

=================================

small models of splayed and abstracted avatars in pain
they are fleeing from it

radio sounds from antique radio equipment
you lean against glass and hear the flesh of the earth

photographs of a small child doomed to make these things
the child is doomed to listen to these things too

images of dead soldiers against your eyes
you cannot think anything but images of dead soldiers

books of martyrs and tortures and torments closed
you cannot read through covers telling your cold future

=================================

lament maquette for the dead as the world oozes human beings
human beings come forth and gather their dead and die

the virtual is the pain of the real and an escape
the virtual is powered by the pain and escapes into the virtual

o real pain o virtual
o doom of memory o dead soldiers o stuck flesh o martyrologies

you are deaf and hear nothing but your pain
call you forth and you hear nothing and what is survive

radio makes those sounds when you are not listen
radio make those sounds and murmur when you are

they get stuck in this life and yearn to return to the other

in pain in doom of memory in soldiers in yearning
in returning in memory in stick in lives and in survive

you hear nothing and you listen and read forth and this is a thing
it is a thing like no other listen and reading it comes forth

it comes forth swaying and swings from one to a return to an other
it goes forth dying and sways into another of your own world

i steal your own world from you and your virtual too
i steal your avatar and play it sound on radio here

you listen and you are stuck here in your long to return to an other
i succeed and you are stuck here in your long to return to an other

you listen you

you are stuck in pain, you are held back, you cannot move

they get stuck in this life and yearn to return to the other

they are held back by memory and skin which falls from their seasons

they cannot move but are made from layers torn from their flesh

the radios (there are three in the images; most likely the loose
coupler or 1919-1920 radio set would be used) would run into a
small guitar amplifier; tuned between stations, competing voices
and static would appear in relation to the small distorted avatar
figurines beckoning one into worlds of memory and violent death:
it's as if one might say, here are the contraries of the hungry
ghosts of this world, forever circulating among discharges and 
wires, and here are the remnants of memories in contradiction, 
one against another, alternatives among alternatives, the early
working of wittgenstein's tractatus, the scattering of logical
possibilities among the remnants of things among the dying, and
of other things too scattered, too wounded to stand


cassette

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/cassette.mp3

oud recorded with TC-152 SD Sony recorder (first professional cassette
machine, 1973), using Realistic Stereo Electret-1 microphone 33-919A,
early (date unknown). 

3 pieces. there's a glitch in the cables resulting in a mix of static
and odd digital limiter behavior that adds to the recording. there's 
no audible wow or flutter in the capstans. you can hear capacitance 
changes as a result of static buildup perhaps related to an imperfect 
connection; the tape plays back perfectly on the recording machine.

there's an urgency in the voice of the oud making itself heard within,
not above, the fray. i think the problem is in the analog/digital 
interface. the TC-152SD was manufactured with specially hardened tape-
heads that haven't been duplicated.

the recording was made with limiter, normal tape, Dolby B. the analog
sound of the original is superb since transients are handled better,
at least in this case, than with the digital Zoom H2 recorder i
generally use.

the wounded sound is sublime, reaching above itself, bringing you a
new music; in fact i was reading John Fahey while listening to this
amazing version.

just when you think you're hollow enough to swallow the world,
and there's nothing left for you to do but cuddle under the walls,
light bursts forth, dissolving everything in a blue-screen wreck,
and everything you ever loved dearly topples and bursts away,
leaving the brilliance of shattered light over and over again, 
and your fear oozes out, and you're disappearing a little more,
breaking everything down as you collapse in tears of misery and pain,
and you breathe and there's no air, bleed and there's no blood,
drown and there's no lake, burn, and there's no fire,
and you shout, there's pictures, pictures, pictures,
and you scream, there's magazines and book and plenty to hear,
and you cry, there's places to go and the moon is always full,
and the moon is always bright, and the moon is always there,
and you're listening to the murmur of seas lapping on sullen shores,
and those walls keep on crackling and the light keeps coming through,
and just when you think you're still alive, you've already passed
through the light, and just when you think you're still alive,
you've hardly passed at all


uncanny beauty with avatar choreography of minuscule particulates

trills, spills, and chills
http://www.alansondheim.org/fantasy.mp4
what they do when they are dancing

odd cries and whimpers over mara the creatrix from mara the avatar

the sad sound of molecular machines saying goodbye to their own
creations
http://www.alansondheim.org/mara.mp3
how they sound when they are being made



snaps of such

a distance one might travel to do meet some of these,
others have made them to be broken by the laws of nature,
the laws of nature brook nothing!
hello, i said, you dwarves, you women, you avatars,
you man just lying there with nothing to do,
or did you crawl up and leave your footprint on my behind?
o woman o man o fantasy creepers! it's pain to write this,
more painful to fall out from the bottom of the earth

assorted broken found figures and two new figures
all in pain or production of pleasure
something will happen just for a moment and a limb is lost,
an enormous map of a body covers north america,
and there you will find lives and phantoms breathing,
they're last and asia's first, in the midst of a desert,
where europe and antarctica glued by africa, decide,
one and for all, we're going to south america!
(australia can only watch and catch a nasty cold!)

caressing of maudatar avatar becoming-dancer,
maudatar, which swallowed so many motions,
dance-steps designed by programs and machines
that s/he lost form and figure for tiepolo and in heaven
there in the blue sky s/he makes hir way across ceilings,
only to descend like tadpoles and swift darters,
knotted world-swallowers they were and will become,
there's nothing like them or like unto them anywhere,
anywhere but the process of becoming ... maudatar

http://www.alansondheim.org/maudatar4.jpg

maudatar is an abstracted avatar-form produced originally in Blender 
and motivated by modified bvh files in a number of videos. there are
some internal chambers which may or may not connect. the form is
dedicated to the dancer Maud Liardon, who we worked with several years
ago. the ideal size of the piece would be somewhere around a meter 
high, perhaps slightly less, something dominant, yet something one 
might trip over. the holes might take an arm or leg or might not. the
form sloughs from organic to industrial, as if iron or liquid metal 
were home-grown. 

everything in the world is graceful, full of grace. there are no
weeds, no vermin; there are only life-forms and our blindness in 
relation to the destructiveness of our own value systems. we are the
fundamental of invasive species, but we can make harmonies of 
untoward fragile and sullen beauty, something one might inhabit,
something fulfilling dreams of creatures great and small.

=====================================================================

the problem with sequential reading

is that this entry, here and now, is earlier, although uppermost,
than this entry, written later, beneath it, as a _false foundation._

=====================================================================


DADa

"I keep thinking about the memorial and what makes me saddest of all, is 
that it's the last time there will be a gathering of people with memories 
of dad or for that matter, mom. And with the house disappearing, he's 
already gone into the wilderness we're all heading towards; when I think 
about this, I start crying, weeping actually, even now. People said that 
everyone described him as a curmudgeon, but in fact what came out to me is 
that he was a conundrum to everyone; no one, possibly including himself, 
really understood him. He was and is a mystery; I don't know what he 
thought about, even when he was younger. I don't know why he didn't 
travel, don't know quite where the aristocratic airs came from, or his 
hatred of me which was palpable at times. He should somewhere along the 
line have tried to figure out what I was about; instead he judged a priori 
and for my entire life I was at a loss with him."

Narrative going nowhere, moments of intense dance. So maybe a conundrum
is metaphoric cyberspace._ Third, I recognized the conundrum: A dream 
loosen the con-text. They form kennings, conundrums, with no specific on-
tic connections, keeping myself alive. Each text is a conundrum.
For whom I have not written & for whom, always conundrum without gap or
conundrum of institutions. Wild theory is incomprehensible in your face.
There are conundrums here of course, rather easily solved, but nonetheless
blanks, moments of silence to be filled in, or other conundrums. Then:
"Your mouth, a conundrum:
first conundrum - identities as ontologies - the _thickness_ or idiocy of
second conundrum - presence of _infinitude_ - in terms of the Net -
third conundrum - this desperate desire to escape from death - losing
fourth conundrum - quality of written content - textual worlds and their
fifth conundrum - clean and proper body (Kristeva) of the digital domain -
conundrum among fleshed-out polyporaceae, transcendent knowledge of small
imaginary natures and techno, the conundrum a dream realm of easy electric
conundrums" - a lie or mockery, an occasion - applying the body or
write the lie or conundrum, the circuitous truth of theory:
"The election was clear from the geography."
This conundrum, this relative annihilation of language, fascinates dance, 
camerawork. affect, blankness, dismemberment, coupling, fifth conundrum
coupling, fifth conundrum car across fast country coupling,
opening skin odor musk. moments. enunciation nuance: order. for example,
the opening of skin odor musk. 
"Father was a cartographer and a curmudgeon; we both loved daumier. The
longtounge! farflung curmudgeon vms christ marlboro hosanna boobies !!!"

memoria hd

http://www.alansondheim.org/memor.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/homing.mp4

probably no one will watch these, large files reduced from hd, final 
versions of windmills and walkthroughs. the memorial is in the placing
of them. the memorial is in the waiting and uploading and the thinking
of the past through the future already collapsed. these are the last
views. there are the final times. i could not have written without the
vestige, punctum, of a home. i needed a place to stand. i can't stand
in new york. i can't stand in atlanta, fukuoka, halifax, los angeles, 
hobart, perth and nottingham. unable to stand i write _diacritically,_
i place the vowels against the hardness of insistent letters, the 
_other._ the _other_ murmurs the value and addressing of the world. i
could not have this world, i had this world. nothing is remarked and
nothing gathers the shadow around the _back_ of the legs, comforts and
cuddles and mute or mewling sounds, but the house, it's as if the
house remembers, as if the house, grown older before our own demise,
speaks, and through the misery of the wind and electrical illumination
of the last presence, breathes ever so slowly across the rapture of
dreams, where i am, where i await death. i woke up in night's middle,
thinking, _i am the next to go,_ and the darkness swallowed me, and i
could not, and never have, breathed. and so many things, already in  
flight, seeking, 'and through their misery, the breath of the last
presence' ...


*//* what will come

will not be announced, will not be
or will be but none of it, none of space,
or will have none of time, no memory or notch,
no space of annihilation, no unsigning,
unraveling, no informing, no information,
none of emptiness, no shrug of memory,
no shrug,

we know that now, we bear that, temporal
distance to the future gone, in
retrograde like bad planets faking moving
slowly, un-thereing, inconceivable but no
languor, lassitude, no nothingness, nothing
of light, soundless, no gathering, no
repleasing, no ending, no, none of 
beginning, so we're a moment now, none,
now, so we're here, crawlings, everything's
on the way, off time, off the clock,
things dropping, what might transform 
simile into absence *//*

Seize the moral initiative.
Find a creative alternative to violence.
Assert your own humanity and dignity as a person.
Meet force with ridicule or humor.
Break the cycle of humiliation.
Refuse to submit or to accept the inferior position.
Expose the injustice of the system.
Take control of the power dynamic.
Shame the oppressor into repentance.
Stand your ground.
Make the Powers make decisions for which they are not prepared.
Recognize your own power.
Be willing to suffer rather than retaliate.
Force the oppressor to see you in a new light.
Deprive the oppressor of a situation where a show of force is 
effective.
Be willing to undergo the penalty of breaking unjust laws.
Discard fear of the old order and its rules.
Seek the oppressor's transformations.

Nonviolent Way, in Volume 4, Contemporary Views on Spirituality
and Violence, in The Destructive Power of Religion, Violence in

The articles in the four volumes are based on close theological
readings of texts, actions, and hermeneutics, and well worth 
reading. I think their relation to OWS is really useful.

My Avatar / Human Wounded in Space and in Time

this is what happens in the real world when you're eyes
are closed by others or you agree not to witness the horror
you were born into, you didn't ask for this, this shuddering
in space and time, this uniqueness with its catch-basin of
nerves already ruptured and furious at the world,

this is what happens when you step out of line, when you
can't come clean, can't clarify, can't suck your clean and
proper body, this stuttering in time and in space, this
smear with its basket of nerves torn to pieces, screaming
at every other world than their own

Happy Thanksgiving -  12:55 PM  -  Limited

http://www.alansondheim.org/warning.mp4 

wrote and lost everything, just an accounting in the midst of Happy 
Thanksgiving, working on mss, for WVU Press and Continuum, the FireMuseum 
record out soon, articles due on RMB city in Second Life and a performance 
in SL as well in January, working with Foofwa during the first week of 
January w/ collaboration with Mark Skwarek and Slava towards the end, then 
a 2nd performance with Monika Weiss Feb.2-4, and next week, the Window 
Gallery using crystal radios, guitar amp, the small models I made of 
distorted avatars and hopefully an accompanying video if I can quickly get 
the format right, no idea what that should really be. it feels emptied out 
with the deaths, flood, embezzlement, family split (which at this point I 
don't want to heal, just want to get over it). the Eyebeam scheduling was 
arcane and I hope it's actually fixed at this point so I can start working 
on various ideas here and there. I worry I'm a burden on everyone, like 
James Ellroy with his hushhush always going on in the background. i make 
short and simple videos here, still in Aurora Colorado, at least for 
myself; there aren't any comments at all for these. One of these, New York 
Woman, is a recap of an older audiotape, as embarrassing now as it was 
then, Reading Wilfred Owen, Ellens' The Destructive Power of Religion, 
Confederacy of Dunces, a book on cactus identification, a book on the 
Korean komungo, watching the news, keeping my mouth shut about the 
right-wing swirls of local tv. More and more I think that nature in fact 
really is red in tooth and claw, suffering and dissolution are the two 
positives of the world. I take walks and photographs around the nature 
preserve/reservoir and capture the encroaching mansions everywhere, 
devouring energy and any other resources they can find. Sometimes a hawk 
and new sparrows. The sky is steadfast blue, Around the world, there's no 
Thanksgiving and people are suffering. OWS lost almost all their library; 
books are trash in this world. I keep going back reading Dendy's 
Philosophy of Mystery and making calls, trying to connect to my friends, 
to keep them my friends in spite of all my faults. I stare into the dark. 
The dark doesn't stare back. In Pennsylvania, the house we grew up in is 
slowly collapsing. I inherit two antique guns and two antique swords. The 
world no longer needs them. Like 2 seconds ago Collapse this post

nothing's under them. when in doubt, swell.
neither penis nor vagina will do. too ripe.
breasts hearken back to the old days.
the old days listen in the imperative mode.
stone hears stone. oh for swollen breasts.
the earth heaves. no, the earth was heaved.
nothing's under them. when in doubt, swell.


on the move

Fi and Michael on the move, crossing themselves out,
the door open, and Fi and Michael are on the move;
we've waited for these moments of empathy and love,
waited for years; they're on a plane, they're doomed
to repetition. Fi and Michael don't know that; each
is new to them, their emotions opening like flowers;
they don't know each time is like the first or last,
all looped and circular, always the same opening,
they don't know that, we do, we do, we do.

Blue Skies as I am on the move, separated by encounters,
the beatings of the heart of the machine, and breathless
Blue Skies, they are so simple, they are so profound,
and like them, pulling us along, we are profound as well,
pulsing with empathy and love, these encounters coming,
fitfully, to an end, like flowers, like love, like Fi
and Michael, unlooping.

1-2 'fossil' outlines of wounded avatars on 3d printer plates 
3-7 crystal radio setups. the silver-black RCA BP-10 radio was the
first real portable (vacuum tube) from 1939-41. The loop antenna 
is used with the crystal sets. Better, the ribbon loop antenna on
the shelf in 3 was used. A variometer and early antenna tuner-
condenser are also visual. The sound was loud and clear; a large
number of stations and background sounds were received. This will
be amplified by a modern guitar amplifier.
