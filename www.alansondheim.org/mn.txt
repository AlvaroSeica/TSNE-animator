Awake With Your Hatred For This Poetry Story


"I'm others, perhaps they'll hate me."

Yeah, you hate me. I hate you. Crawl for me. Crawl for me. I hate me. You
hate me. I'll do anything you say. You'll do anything I say. You hate
memory, despise it, not the memory of words and language, already hate me.
I love you as one loves a human being, but I do not want to belong to
anything. Teachers hate me. Bosses hate me. To know me is to hate me. I
walk in and say, give me a job, I'll whore for you. I'm others, perhaps
they'll hate me. I turn on this machine praying for excitement - say it
over and over again. There's sense on the other side. I hate me.  Down in
Miami they hate me, they put my image on walls and scratch; to deal with
this stay away. I'm full of poison; you'll hate me when you are asleep.
Nothing comes. Maybe you are awake and hate me. I don't know. I hope not.
I wouldn't want you to hate me. But I am awake totally, sometimes even
more than that. Some of my friends end up hating me, hating me and maybe I
deserve it, difficulty no excuse. You hate me. I don't know. I hope not. I
wouldn't want you to hate me. But I am awake totally, sometimes even more
than that. Some of my friends end up hating me, hating me and maybe I
deserve it, difficulty no excuse. You hate memory, despise it, not the
memory of words and language, already hate me. I hate me. I don't know. I
hope not. I wouldn't want you to hate me. I turn on this machine praying
for excitement - say it over and over again. There's sense on the other
side. I hate you. Crawl for me. I hate me. I hate me. I turn on this
machine praying for excitement - say it over and over again. There's sense
on the other side. I hate me. Bosses hate me. I hate me. To know me is to
hate me. I turn on this machine praying for excitement - say it over and
over again. There's sense on the other side. I hate me. I walk in and say,
give me a job, I'll whore for you. I'm others, perhaps they'll hate me.
But I am awake totally, sometimes even more than that. Trust me I'm awake.

Sam, I think about the message I left you when Mary left you. Sam, she
trusted me. We didn't do anything. Why didn't you come by and see what
what going on? Nothing was. You shouldn't have stayed away. You shouldn't
have come back that night either. That changed everything. Mary's never 
coming home now. How could she? You broke everybody's trust. 

Was awake in the middle of the night. Al Wilson called. I went over his
place. The hall light was on, there was shit everywhere. I mean human
shit, covering the floor, the walls, the stairs, everything. I banged on
his door. What the hell's going on I said. The guy's been here, he said,
the guy who killed all those doctors.  He thought I had drugs. Crazy
junkie. You gotta stay with me he said. Al's place smelled like hell.
Garbage everywhere, his clothes falling off him. Had one set all the time.
That was Al. He ran out the back door to call with the guy screaming at

...that voyeurism is not about sex but about knowledge and there is a
critical moment which the voyeur experiences, which galvanizes hir, the
moment of imagined voyeurism, of the visibility and viability of the
object. the voyeur relies on a preparation, the geometric assertion, with
which s/he bolsters hir desired implosion. so it would seem that the net
makes voyeurs of us all; we constantly wryte ourselves, thus hiding the
voyeuristic self further because voyeurism is so diffuse and constant, any
voyeur here, anytime, by looking out the window and seeing what our lives
can only guess. the voyeur gains knowledge about the private habits of
those s/he watches. a slightly different aspect of voyeurism; you on the
contingent moment, the unexpected naked body in the window, and i, on the
voyeur-life, we are inseparable because the voyeuristic relation is
naturally a thwarted sexual act of voyeurism to be "successful"; the
sexual need plays out as the voyeur is ruled by the watched, in a sense -
spellbound, as you say. and it is this submission to the watched which
impels the voyeur to know theoretical interstices, ontologies, epistemol-
ogies, real and virtual. the compulsive voyeur may ask: "why do i do it?
why do i torture myself?"; here (and elsewhere) we diverge; the voyeur's
transgressive moment is amplified and clarified in the voyeur life. that
way of living is all there is for them. the theoretical they produce is
simultaneously a devouring and inscribing of the world that otherwise
would not exist, everything out of sight impossibly trembles.

damaged life held together by a skein of mucilage and damaged life? the
quota is a measure, in fact, of damaged life, of life that refuses damaged
life consciousness of throughout the broken measure of cyberdamaged life.

phenomenology is always already a masochism or always already constructed
in webpage or screen; it splays into littoral, to ash. .net splays mesh
across the same imaginary, it blooms, disperses, splays across domains and
definitions. it processes desire, acts as consort to voyeurisms splaying
the residue or information concerning a particular user - hir flesh. being
splays, displays, called sight, site, citation.

the character essays


The 1000 Character Classic (or 'essay,' depending on the translation) is a
Chinese work from the 6th century - Ellen Zweig and I are translating it.
It was used in the imperial exams; the first 80 characters formed the
basis of keno; and numerous classical texts are numbered by the charac-
ters. The 1000 characters never repeat; the text was one of the bases for
learning the language. The beginning is mythological, more or less; there
are also numerous (Confucian) maxims.

Texts (such as Genesis) dealing with originary moments often stress the 
role of language; creation is catalyzed by the Word, Speech, Breath, and 
so on. In the reduction of Genesis I worked on, each word in the first 
half is used only once; the rest are eliminated. So the first half becomes 
a construct of language itself, its political economy, eliminating 
surplus. In the second half, the end of Genesis determines the fullness of 
the language, and the beginning of the second half contains the elimina- 
tions. 

A text beginning with God's speech descends to, ascends out of, the proper
name, the only remainder of languages abstract skein.

Genesis had to be modified, eliminating the future punctuations, capital 
letters, chapter and verse numbers; the result is transformed into enun- 
ciation, pure speech exhausting itself in the first half, and descending 
out of evanescence, God's silence, in the second.

Other texts were also used to arrive at the condensation of the Julu perl 
scripts, the theoretical work I did on the abacus (which is an inverse, a 
spread of quantity across a skein), and bones drawn from the recent modi- 
fied markov chain pieces.

Two different programs were used; one involved a number of unix commands, 
including awk, sed, tr, nl, etc., that transformed a text into a list of 
duplications which could then be manually removed. The second was a perl 
script; I asked Florian Cramer's help on this. I then modified the script 
to a small extent. The perl script is a coherent filter creating an array 
and comparing the elements, retaining only the first of any that were 
equivalent.

Language can only be spoken once, or it can be spoken forever; there is no 
intermediary here, and once and forever are not binaries. Speaking once 
creates it in the form of rigid designators, description taut in its 
relation to the substrate of the real. Speaking forever glides forever; it 
is only with the greatest difficult that meaning is retained. Speaking 
once is the fullness and repleteness of meaning, but meaning grounded in 
unique enunciation, the fullness of the earth. Speaking forever is meaning 
emptied, swollen and diffused in air, untethered, transfigured. 

Language is never one nor the other, but creation is, and forever carries 
death, just as once is choratic birth.

the animation-anime text


doctor, i'm working with animation; i place words and sparks engendered
surrounding the mouth of nikuko. there's no dialog, only patronage.

patronage is the means of control and withdraw; language becomes
internalized. nikuko harbors the skein of her own construct; a virtual
idol, she inhabits inscription.

we all inhabit inscription; everything is coded, flow against the chaotic

i came to you to place words against the animation-anime; to work through
her presence, her dictation.

there are no plans, except to fill space and frame to the limit, to
comprehend the emissions of nikuko.

this is the flood of the text, doctor; you construct tropologies across
our own; the flood creates her semblance of the real in relation to
everything else, real and virtual, virtual-real.

nikuko has drawn us out -

you've been of great help, doctor.

political economy of the superstructure. the superstructure saves you. it
is your tombstone and your procreation.

the disease that marks the body. look, you can see me there. look, you can
touch me there.

my tongue. they form the character for interval. they form the character
for annihilation. for emptiness. for perfect-flaw.

9 because i will kill you and fuck your brains out.

The 165 Character Manifesto


All too often, we hear that postmodernity has eliminated, or at least
called into question, the relationship of natural world, wilderness, to
manageriality. This is prefabricated on assumption no longer can nature be
taken for granted, in-itself primordial. Instead, world fabricated,
constructed, managed, undergoing continuous cultural transformation -
augmented by global communications systems.

I wish propose an 'other hand,' however - one based both atmosphere and
cosmos. Clearly, atmospheric pollution, stratospheric extends vertically;
doubts it reaches ionospheric levels, even if so, inaccessibly-high finite
vastness universe beckons beyond.

Consider this, then consider traumas earth itself earthquakes other
'natural disasters,' latter hurricanes example human activity. From above,
from below, volcanos, magmas held taut within mesh universal chaos.

Human encroach; have not yet contaminated stars, earth-orbital trash
infinitesimal danger, compared errant asteroid.

The point? That artificial are porous, species-dependent terms, sun
clearly indicative our own miserable fabrications... There remains
wilderness preserved, avoid this uncomfortable conclusion 'annihilation
limit' seems a far easier, almost comfortable, way, deal with what appears
slaughter...

drinking her urine in front of the invited guests
one last kiss, one last note, one touch
licking her feet
one last kiss, one last note, one touch
evening primrose
one last kiss, one last note, one touch
long white gown falling open from her shoulders
one last kiss, one last note, one touch

one last kiss, one last note, one touch
