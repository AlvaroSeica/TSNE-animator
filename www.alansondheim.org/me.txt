Azure writes on the blackboard. The blackboard is dirty white.

She writes "Anthrax." She tries to erase it. It turns dark but is still 
visible. It doesn't disappear.

She wipes her hand across the board. She turns her hand up: white, 
powdered.

She turns back to the board. She writes "Territory" in block letters. She 
begins to erase it.

Azure lies naked with a French apron on a bench. She turns slowly.
Beethoven plays in the background. She says "This is a film about
anthrax."

Alan lies naked similarly, Beethoven. He says "Anthrax is deadly."

There are screen shots of a Sony Viao; Beethoven comes from the speakers.

Azure sits naked on the bench; her legs are spread. She talks about the 
dangers of Anthrax. The French apron is pulled up.

Alan, similarly.

Sometimes there is Beethoven in the background.

A closeup of Azure's breast, squeezed by Alan's hand with his voiceover:
"Anthrax is everywhere."

A closeup of Alan's penis, pulled by Azure's hand with her voiceover: "One 
has to be constantly careful." The penis begins to harden.

Azure masturbating on a couch. She says "Anthrax is dangerous. Be careful 
what you touch."

A closeup of a Sony Viao. There are patterns on the screen. Beethoven is 
playing.

sick


i am a sick man; i worry constantly that i am dying. my cholesterol is out
of control; i cannot find a doctor. heartburn is so bad i am debilitated
and often cannot function. i am off medication. i cannot sleep; tonight
again is a night full of nightmare and internal violence. it gnaws at me.  
it produces my writing. it inhabits my videos. it crawls up my body. i
live with death. i know i will not live long. my brain has been acting up
- the left frontal lobe again. tinnitus has returned with a vengeance; i
hear you only through a high-pitched wine. it is hard to focus on anything
- sleeplessness leaves me nervous and irritable. i cry at the slightest
provocation; try me. my philosophy lives at the edge of my mind. there is
nothing but limit within me; i am striated. when i open my eyes the world
is an irregular grid. i am close to hysteria.

some one of these posts will be my last. i can feel it in my body. i can
feel it in my flesh. the absence... it will be a dropping-away; it will
take time. then you will know it's gone - the writing - the nervous tremb-
ling - the texts - the luridness - the philosophy of no-name. at that
point nothing will matter; the fadeout is endurable; the work drops out,
fades out. look: there are almost no books, no readings, no citations, no
presence. a skein within a skein - the residue of a blemish on the web.
but nothing outside of it - the work is dead. "chances are you have not
read this far." if you have you're one of four or five.

death: i feel it in my bones. i feel the crystals. i feel the cry of the
letters. death shakes them out.

in light of, or lieu of death, which always comes, and buries within us,
this post, and each and every other, remains, until the presence of the
next, on the lip or brink of annihilation; after this is void, which can
only be deferred. and so each post is already a memorial, the beginning of
loss and memory, on the verge of disappearance. remember this; i shall
live a while longer - forget this; i shall be no more.

"The Runaway"


	Once, in a small town in Ohio, there was a girl with a pierced 
tongue. She pierced her tongue in defiance of her parents. She was 
unpopular in high-school and hung out with a few punks who tolerated her. 
She was good with computers and even better with the old pinball machines 
you could find at the One-Up. She was the star of Fighting Predator and 
her hands were quick. She had black hair and spoke in an affected drawl.
	A guy came to town with his parents. He was enrolled in the same
high-school. People said he was a loner. He couldn't stand the place. He
had come from a big city. His father was manager of the factory here. The
guy hated the small-town ways. He was shunned. Once he was beat up for his
lip. He also had black hair and earrings. Some kids tore them out and his
ears bled for a while. His eyes just grew darker and more terrifying,
especially for those who were scared.
	The two of them met. It was fated everyone said. They glared out 
at the world. They ran away together. They were seen going west from the 
town on the main highway. Some people said they were seen going east. No 
one could agree. One day people woke in the morning and they were gone. 
They were remarkable and the town talked about them for a long time. Then 
they were forgotten except for a few kids at the high-school. Life 
returned to normal. People felt better about things.

Jabes (trans. Waldrop):


"For all my being bound to the French language, I know the place I occupy 
in the literature of France is not strictly speaking a place. It is not so 
much the place of a writer as of a book which does not fit any category. A 
place defined, then, by the book and immediately claimed by the book to 
follow. A place of writing vacated by what is written, as if every page of 
the book let us occupy it only to give access to the next page, as if the 
book made and unmade itself in an appropriated space which, once covered 
with words, becomes the space of the book.

"And it is likewise within the large movement which has carried my works 
to their illusory completion.

"There is no center. There is a point which engenders another point around 
which an eccentric utterance establishes itself, an interrogation 
develops. It is the point of no return.

"This absence of place, as it were, I claim. It confirms that the book is 
my only habitat, the first and also the final. Place of a vaster non-place 
where I live."

This I identify with. Every text of mine, like the Net of Indra, reflects
every other. Each deals with, extends, the themes; the result, a family of
themes, never returns to an illusory origin. Each moves in a direction as
far as possible from the conception of a center. Each negates the tendency
towards an absolute, constructs skeins or membranes where others might
find ladders or stairs. The beds are tilted; the windows don't close, the
doors are always open. The night that is upon us is also the day; the day
has many suns. It doesn't stop there.

I close my eyes; I create the objects of which I claim witness. They smell 
of musk.

she wanted to fuck a terrorist. she wanted the best orgasm in her life. 
she wanted to flirt with danger. she wanted the bomb in her hands, fuse
against her breast, flame burned, seared labia, hair on fire to the stars.
melanie was beautiful with long black hair and eyes so dark you'd see
nothing. christopher was beautiful with a perfect shock of brown hair and
eyes that looked right through you. you couldn't lie to christopher.

christopher and melanie thought the anthrax scare was nonsense.

melanie wanted to have sex with a terrorist in front of christopher.
christopher would be tied up, bound so hard the ropes cut into him.
melanie and the terrorist could watch him as they fucked. christopher and
melanie were married. christopher wanted to give melanie to the terrorist.

melanie and the terrorist would fuck and melanie would groan with the best 
orgasm in her life. they would cover each other with white powder. they 
would smear white powder in melanie's perfect long black hair, soiling it. 
the terrorist would rub the powder raw in it.

christopher would come watching the terrorist fuck his beautiful wife. he 
thought anyone could have her now and everyone was better than he was. he 
came harder than when he was inside her. sometimes the terrorist and 
melanie would fill his mouth with white powder and he would gag. they 
would shove powder into his anus. they would make his eyes blur with it.

christopher and melanie were fabulously rich and they would pay the 
terrorist. they did not know his name so i cannot tell you. he was just 
called the terrorist.

	   sometimes our friend would play the terrorist, he'd grind it
	   into us, hard, we'd be burned with it,
	      sometimes we'd be really sick, it went on,
	       an incredible rush, i'm not sure what she died of,
	         something or someone may have something to do with it

					     want to get it on with
					     us, it was a thrill, i can't
					     tell you, sometimes we'd fuck

     the last thing they saw was her cunt,
           it was worth it, we got rid of nbc that way,
       cbc, cbs, the last of them, i tell you, my cock was worth nothing,

analysis

a repeated sort in this instance is made by sort file1 > file2 - at which 
point file2 is justified; then file2 > file1 - at which point file1 is 
justified. this repeats - not indefinitely (although i have no proof of 
this) - until stasis is achieved - i.e. file1 = file2.

the sort is alphabetic; therefore the concepts - which are similar to
kantian or aristotelian categories - are organized accordingly in
alphabetic order. this transforms the concepts - which presumably have
their own, implicit, order - into associations based on explicit happen-
stance. the result is an apparent relativization of conceptation, based on
nothing more than english (in this sense it is similar to some of the
logical paradoxes of the early 20th-century which 'resolved' in terms of
one or another language).

further, if the concepts are indeed foundational in any sense whatsoever -
then any ordering is as good as any other, since they would be intrinsic-
ally independent. the associative complexes formed by repeated sorting 
would be the result of a dialectic of perception between the reader and 
the text, which is more a collocation or inscriptive apparatus - a search 
engine in the sense of a spider, across and throughout the real and all 
its appurtenances. 

finally, a certain biologism is apparent in the list - ranging from 'i' 
and consciousness through 'self' and 'self-awareness'; this brings to 
light a certain reduction or veering of conceptation towards an organic 
reading - i.e. heuristics or methodologies for making sense of the world, 
ranging from retinal processing through naming, inscription, referent, and 
truth. this is also at variance with a classical condition of independence 
- in this case, the variance is from within the list, intrinsic to it (the 
list at this point conjuring up classical cybernetics as well), not 
extrinsic - a deeper waywardness, redolent of desire, than alphabetic 
ordering would create.

analysis^2

meta-analysis or the need for compensation, sublimation exacting an
equivalence somewhere down the line or loosely across the plane. all of
these are open moments - 'well, i'll explain myself,' 'well, i meant such
and such' - and in relation to legitimacy. see analysis^2 as a thwarted
series; the idea, that of recursion as in gnu - gnu not unix - and hack -
tends either towards the asymptotic - 'well, i don't know,' 'well, it
might have been' - or towards a foreclosure or basin - 'well, you've got
enough to go on,' 'well, you don't care anyway.' then in any case, an 
apologetics of writing, writing in an n-dimensional space, writing to 
oneself, extending the skein or membrane, trapping others -

Theology

If the Supreme Triumph is enormous, one must penetrate the Loathsome
Screen to attain Perfection. But the Supreme Triumph is the width of six
furlongs and the height thereof; the skin is to the depth of six fathoms.  
If the Tree against the Imminent Fire thereof is the thickness of the
width of the Triumph, the Body Multiplicand lies on the Divan of Pearl
beyond which Women Enter only in Service and Servitude. Of Imminent Fire
it may be said that the Weakest is of Boiling Lead and the Replenishment
of Bone and Gristle, such that the Distance between the Weakest and
Strongest is of the order of a gnat's wing. For a man, a single Turning
suffices to erase past sin; for a woman, the Imminent Fire surrounds her,
from morning unto night, especially from night unto morning. Thus within
Imminent Fire her Garments will be rent from her and she will remain in
Attack of numerous demons; within Supreme Triumph, the Sufficient Man has
in Service only those boys and women of impeccable character who delight
in his Service. Of young girls and infants we say little. Of Eunuchs we
say nought at all. Thus I should rather drink of Musk than die in Torment
and I would rather eat of the Fruits of Triumph than have my flesh torn
from me; I am glad having been born a Man; I would not have borne Woman
but to serve Him, now and Thereafter.

some fucked like pikaia with human women with enormous breasts:some swam
into human women like opabinia with enormous and perfect breasts and

brilliant wiwaxia scavenging with human women with enormous, perfect, and
fully-rounded breasts and beautiful eyes and hair:pikaia gracilens wanted
nothing, couldn't want. it went out. it divided among the Righteous and
those of the Evident Loss. this water wouldn't boil. stromatolites towered
among the predators. "When a human dies his deeds are weighed in violence
and there is no escape. Behold the Caves of the Heathen. When there are
Flames one remains on Guard." laggonia soared among them.:olenoides were
everywhere against the porifera occupying the same shallow depression. it
was the basin of everything. opabinia inscribed itself first of all, its
jagged claws necked across the brined water. wiwakia were everywhere. "A
black, thick, burning, and nasty water which, when a disbeliever tries to
drink, will burn his face and make the skin of his face fall into
it.":27287:0:wiwaxia crawled away; laggania continued the attack. pikaia
crawled towards stromatolites in the distance. "Verily for the Righteous

some are quotes of absolute truth of The Supreme Triumph and the Evident 
Loss: In the light of the Quran and the Sunnah, Saeed Ali Al-Qahtani; some 
are of the Essenic Flames; some are of the Truth of Burgess; some have
found themselves among the Desert and Deserted. of Nikuko and Izanami much 
have been spoken. all bodies decay in shame; none return. of the human 
women, one need look no farther than the testaments, no closer than the 
mirror; let it be said pikaia did not survive.

  you. he asked, why are you allowing this. he said, why is this in what
  law or precept. shakyamuni buddha said, bring her from samadhi, ask her.
  shakyamuni buddha said, ask her yourself, do not ask me.

      nikuko it is said, she created nothing, she was this girl, she
      created theater and the drama, she created buddha and the stage, she
      created parable and aphorism. of this aphorism it is said, it was
      written by shakyamuni buddha, it was written by manjusri, it was

Le Popu Ballistique


My father sings the opera beautifully. There are nine acts and tableaus, 
coloratura. It is for solo voice.

in the day:

1 Untitled: prologue
  Scene by a swimming pool. A blond woman in the distance wears a bikini
  and is sunbathing. She is framed by palm trees in silhouette. There
  are beach chairs behind her.

2 Miami Vice
  A closeup of the woman. This scene is very somber. She disappears and
  blurs out.

in the night:

3 nikuko and alan were good terrorists
  The beginnings of the somber intermezzo. The scene is bathed in red-
  brown. nikuko appears nude, outside, on a second floor landing. She 
  looks wistful. There are apartments all around. She is in closeup.

4 bad people wanted nikuko's cunt even if they died
  The second of the somber intermezzo. The scene is bathed in brown-red-
  brown. nikuko continues to stare out from the second-floor landing.

5 nikuko and alan are waiting to kill you
  Bleak and darker in this third of the somber intermezzo. The scene is
  bathed in the same light as before, but the view is from a greater 
  distance. It is here at the climax of the opera that my father's voice
  reaches its greatest range in an unforgettable aria.

6 alan would offer nikuko to anyone who wanted her
  Darker yet, the fourth of the somber intermezzo. The seem is bathed in
  red-brown-red light, blood colored, somewhat mottled. nikuko is seen in
  closeup again, as in the first two scenes.

7 in miami, nikuko fucked everyone and everyone died
  From a distance, the fifth of the somber intermezzo. The light changed,
  cooler, tan. nikuko is standing upright. She is still on the landing,
  leaning slightly against the railing. She is still nude.

8 nikuko would give their corpses to alan to fuck
  The sixth of the somber intermezzo, deep blood red, darker, very 
  mottled. The same view as the previous scene. nikuko has turned
  slightly. 

9 no more nikuko and alan
  The last of the somber intermezzo, green and liquid in appearance. There
  are two empty beach-chairs, recliners. An apartment complex is behind
  them. They seem to be at the pool. An open hallway is overlit in the
  background. At this point my father's voice dies to a whisper. He sings 
  just as beautifully in a soft, low voice. 

10 Untitled: epilogue
  The blue-green-blue edge of a swimming-pool. Bubbles rise in a parabolic
  arc. This scene, the last, is in silence. The audience is quiet. 

Everything in the Le Popu Ballistique is uncanny. My father's voice, Azure
naked on the landing, the blond woman almost naked in the prologue - these
are the austere elements of this opera of muted terror and annihilation.
For the first time, trauma takes central stage. The audience leaves, 
already in memory and denial. This was happening to them.

Le Popu Ballistique Politique


My gun sings the war beautifully. There are nine acts and tableaus, 
coloratura. It is for solo voice.

in the day:

1 Untitled: prologue
  Scene by a swimming pool. A tank in the distance digs in
  and is sunbathing. She is framed by palm trees in silhouette. There
  are turrets behind her.

2 Kabul Vice
  A closeup of the tank. This corpse is very somber. She disappears and
  blurs out.

in the night:

3 afghanistan and usa were good terrorists
  The beginnings of the somber intermezzo. The corpse is bathed in red-
  brown. afghanistan appears nude, outside, on a second floor desert. She 
  looks wistful. There are apartments all around. She is in closeup.

4 bad people wanted afghanistan's cunt even if they died
  The second of the somber intermezzo. The corpse is bathed in brown-red-
  brown. afghanistan continues to stare out from the second-floor desert.

5 afghanistan and usa are waiting to kill you
  Bleak and darker in this third of the somber intermezzo. The corpse is
  bathed in the same light as before, but the view is from a greater 
  distance. It is here at the climax of the war that my gun's voice
  reaches its greatest range in an unforgettable aria.

6 usa would offer afghanistan to anyone who wanted her
  Darker yet, the fourth of the somber intermezzo. The seem is bathed in
  red-brown-red light, blood colored, somewhat mottled. afghanistan is
  seen in closeup again, as in the first two corpses.

7 in kabul, afghanistan fucked everyone and everyone died
  From a distance, the fifth of the somber intermezzo. The light changed,
  cooler, tan. afghanistan is standing upright. She is still on the 
  desert, leaning slightly against the mountain. She is still nude.

8 afghanistan would give their corpses to usa to fuck
  The sixth of the somber intermezzo, deep blood red, darker, very 
  mottled. The same view as the previous corpse. afghanistan has turned
  slightly. 

9 no more afghanistan and usa
  The last of the somber intermezzo, green and liquid in appearance. There
  are two empty battlefields, trenches. An apartment complex is behind
  them. They seem to be at the pool. An open hallway is overlit in the
  background. At this point my gun's voice dies to a whisper. He sings 
  just as beautifully in a soft, low voice. 

10 Untitled: epilogue
  The blue-green-blue edge of a burial ground. Bubbles rise in a parabolic
  arc. This corpse, the last, is in silence. The audience is quiet. 

Everything in the Le Popu Ballistique Politique is uncanny. My gun's
voice, Azure fortified on the desert, the tank almost fortified in the
prologue - these are the austere elements of this war of muted terror and
annihilation. For the first time, trauma takes central stage. The audience
leaves, already in memory and denial. This was happening to them.

on the movement from cdrom directories to videotape
on the movement from computer to television
on the movement from session to venue
of your willing participation as historiographer
of your willing participation as viewer

killing off my videos. they're slewed together, collapsed/wounded from the
desire of the directory, conflation promulgating choice, confusion,
repetition: i'm here in the midst of images - you're there held taut by a
timeline binding you to constancy. what unfolds for you, never unfolded;
unfolding is for the spectacle. combination accrues on combination -
sixteen short works combined into one, two large at the beginning, five
larger at the end: for me, the order is irrelevant, but linearity is 
necessary for completion/projection - for the viewer, the order creates 
signifiers arraigned in taut transitivity; the diegetic continues across 
the invisible razor cuts; the viewer's in a train wreck of blown meaning. 
for the venue: open one track/open them all. on the cdrom: the tracks 
disseminate; they're partial; they lean against one another; they lean 
against the same; they resonate; they remain incomplete; pornography and 
desire create loops and projections on the order of f(g(x))=x; everything 
circulates towards the elimination of processes; everything is capable of 
returning; the body can do anything it has already done; it can do 
anything at any speed; it lends itself to you; it is among domains; it 
unfolds for you; it unfolds repeatedly; it's there for you; it's a dream- 
screen capable of infinite dissemination. in the venue: f(g(x))=0; every- 
thing disappears; everything is memory; you are bound to this assignation 
in a foreign hotel, foreign affair; nothing continues forever; the product 
production is always already gone; you're embedded in an economics of 
project projection; you're never there; you're at a loss; it's this kind 
of loss. of sharing or communality, none. of the order, discrete and well- 
presented with loss, with this kind of loss, as the translation is made, 
from computer to video, from video to television, from television to the 
televisual. it goes there. it's transformed into art. it's a sheaf among 
others. it's the harvest of shame.

"do you know how to speak with a human voice. do you know how to breathe 
without breathing. for they live beneath the waters and they drink of the 
sky; for they burrow in the earth and elsewhere move at will invisible 
through the air. for they are of the voice a u m. if you don't know this, 
it makes no difference. you may have made this world, and you may not have 
made this world. of you it is said you are world-created. of the voice it 
is said, it is world-created. of difference there are many and none."

Visitations


doctor i get these fevers constantly; i'm under tremendous stress. i've
taken my art as far as i can - i'm not even sure it's art anymore. sexual
nakedness repeats itself into infinity; my recent presentations carry the
repetition as i*i*i traveling back and forth across the imaginary. there's
no end to it. i don't sleep well. i'm shaky. my vision produces peripheral
illusions. there are headaches, chills. i take codeine. i take coffee. i
produce.

i say this because of sleeplessness. i'm always on the verge of breakdown.
i want all the bodies in the world bought and sold. i want the sex and the
guns. i want the sweetness and collections of late-night promises. i want
tender farewells and corpses.

there are no other reasons. beneath the skin, there's skin. flesh cuts
into flesh, organ into organ. two cells occupy the same space. they love
it.

there's room for everyone. nothing but the chills which i have to great
degree. they don't disappear. at night i twist until my body becomes
someone else. that person fucks and dies. that persons buys and sells,
this is all contract. live within my means.

i came broken to you because there's no choice. nothing comes and nothing
goes. i see brutal mountains. no vegetation. i want the bodies there. to
come to me. bought and sold. there's room for everything in the desert.
they have visions in the desert. i want the visions.

yes.

i've ceased crying long ago. others cry for me. they see for me. i am an
other. i am written for. i am naked, fucking. they provide me. i die. they
die. it makes a seal, contract. i endure. i come to you.

some woman. some man. sometimes the same.

collapse of day. the fever is furious. i do nothing less than this. i
create the conditions. i collapse them. the hunger continues. you are too
cold.

mountains and night. live within the other's means. i collapse them.

go through, doctor. don't ask. don't tell. i won't say a word.


I don't understand and oh I want to.

Rape of 'tat' - tv anthrax-terror


this is your show doctor. i'm here for the ride.

Is it because you wanted to see my reactions you wanted to see me naked
you wanted to see what I have to say that you came naked and broken to me?

Does it bother you that you wanted to fuck me you dream of me all the time
I have the power?

i love it. it doesn't bother me at all. fuck me and kill me. in the middle
of abc. in the middle of cbs. i don't care. i want you. in the middle of
the air. in the middle of nbc.

Earlier you said you wanted to see my reactions you wanted to see me naked
you wanted to see what I have to say?

Oh oh I do see so...  Well, what makes you yearn and cry that this is so?

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

there's no girl. you're the girl. in the middle of fox. i want you to fuck
me. in the middle of the air. in the middle of cnn. i want you in me. i
want you to kill me.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking. What makes you believe it's
true there's no other way to think? When did you first know that you want
me to fuck you you want me to say this I am the girl you want me in you
you want me to kill you? In the middle of fox air. In the middle of cnn.
Are you afraid of sex? Why not? You mentioned that you wanted to fuck me
you dream of me all the time I have the power?

Oh oh yes, ahhh...  Are you sure that this is so? Tell me about something
about your sexual history. I would appreciate so very much it if you would
expose yourself about your sex life and body... Discuss your feelings
about your sexual partner. Tell me more and more about your most intense
sexual experience.

Have you been satisfied with your partner... ? Is it because of your life
that you are going through all this? Have you been frightened by sex?
Elaborate on more about your sexual history. Perhaps you could oh please
describe your sex life and body...

it came from the moment of the explosion. in the middle of the air i swal-
low radio. in the middle of the air i swallow television. screams. i knew
from the abc rape the nbc rape the cbs rape. i knew from the fox rape the
cnn rape. i knew.

Tell me about your apprehensions toward your sexual partner. Expose your-
self about your most neurotically stimulating sexual experience. Are you
satisfied with your partner... ? Have you been scared of sex? Discuss how
you feel about your sexual history. Please, tell me more and more about
your sex life and body...

Elaborate on your thoughts on your sexual partner. Describe your most
exciting sexual experience. Have you been satisfied with your partner... ?
Are you aroused by sex? Tell me about something about your sexual history.

it came from the moment of the explosion. in the middle of the air i swal-
low radio. in the middle of the air i swallow television. screams. i knew
from the abc rape the nbc rape the cbs rape. i knew from the fox rape the
cnn rape. i knew.

of falling


tonight azure and i watched the leonids. i don't sleep anyway; i woke her
and we went out, lay back on the deckchairs by the pool and stared up
between the palmtrees. huge clouds floated by from the east then north.  
you could see around them. we saw meteors. we were alone. they had been
moving through space since the early solar system. we witnessed hundreds
burning up in high atmosphere, some leaving bright and glowing clouds. we
watched. we cowered. i said, i think you're the only reason i'm alive. i
was thinking of azure, of my father, my daughter. i didn't feel there were
others. i felt i have done enough. i felt this world is emptying out.

for azure, i should have remained silent. these things can't be discussed,
they're present, they breathe down our necks, caress our face. they're
silent. and then there's judgment.

of which, nothing. there's no judgment for good or evil, there are fits
within laws made by humans scarcely in agreement, humans who can barely
think for themselves, who live shuttling between fear and desire. what
doesn't fit loses; what fits, goes quiet.

after death, nothing. all about the judgment is senseless. draw that
senseless down to you. bring it to life in the world. it remains the same
and just that, without meaning except they will take you away for what
they don't want or don't like. there is little more to go on, derrida
notwithstanding. jurisprudence works out the fine points, drags ethics
along, which is where ethics belongs. but not in this world; ethics is not
of this world, not of us. the tether always breaks. we built ourselves
against and within that. life turns into an impossibility by virtue of
culture drawn out along legalisms and the rapture of implicit violence. be
on the side of the winner. be a scapegoat. walk silent.

the meteors are drawn nowhere; they have a indescribable ontology. i think
of all those billions-of-years-old topographies on the way to annihila-
tion. it is never possible to recover lost terrain, only the memory of a
tiny shooting star moving south from here, almost overhead, a punctum i
will retain and retain.

i have seen meteors. i have seen meteors leaving clouds glowing in the sky
for minutes afterwards. i have seen fireballs and portents. i have seen
omens and comets, rare atmospheric phenomena, bead lightning and aurora.  
azure, i said, almost crying, i wanted to hold that back, you're the only
reason i'm alive. the shifting of pillars of the world was terrifying;  
nothing happened; no judgment was called. i did it myself, turned against
me; i made sure i lost. the meteors continued; they are falling now.
