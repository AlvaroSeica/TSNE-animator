ALAN, ALAM [from the Sumerian] = essri, 'form, statue.' il,

per- cube, hypercube, etc.) always have 3^n elements, where n = 
dimension; ween the pillars, the Bhutas (spirits) the railing 
[of seats = _dharani_], disappears (through poverty = diskcrash 
or surplus = meltdown), there is until 2-portion is empty, i.e. 
2-portion = 0 (in which case the 2-portion may no longer exist). 
with the bead from 1 portion returning to the undifferentiated 
plain, and this continues until 2-portion = 0 (or becomes 
non-existent). So that from the plain, one gathers beads into 
heaps. The heaps are separated by blanked space, the 
ground-state; this state G = 0. G is always existent; it is a 
territorialization, a boundary, a marker by virtue of lack of 
demarcation. If G = 0 it is 0 anywhere, everywhere that G is. 
Think of it as the Basin in Bon religion, or Kristevan chora. 
Nothing is ever placed within G; G surrounds heaps. New heaps 
may be created, but G is not among them, within them. In this 
sense, G is not a natural number, but a numberless state, not 
even an emptying of number. In this sense as well, the integers 
move from 1 upwards; negative integers might be indicated by 
heaps labeled as negative, but in fact all heaps are of the 
form: HN = | N | where N > 0. Begin with H1 = X and H2 = Y. To 
reach X - Y: Subtract a bead from both; place these beads in a 
third heap H3; carry this operation out until H2 is empty. When 
H2 is empty, H2 = 0 = G, the undifferentiated state, H2 no 
longer existent. But see below, labeling. This depends of course 
on Y < or = X. To multiply X * Y. Create H3 and H4. Move H1 bead 
by bead to H3; each time, add one bead to H4. When H1 = 0 (i.e. 
non-existent), subtract one bead from H2 and place it in H5. 
Then move H3 bead by bead to H1 (which must be created anew - H3 
and H1 oscillating in this fashion); each time, add one bead to 
H4. When H3 = 0 (i.e. non-existent), subtract another bead from 
H2 and place it in H5. We then have H1 = X H3 = 0 (i.e. 
non-existent) H2 = Y - 2 H4 = X * 2 H2 = 0 (i.e. non-existent) 
at which point H4 = X * Y. One might measure X against Y by 
moving string, and in that fashion create an accurate 
multiplication - but only if X/Y or Y/X = an integer. Otherwise 
one is lost without further calculation, fractions, and so 
forth. An exercise: What calculations are necessary? What 
additional instruments? How to remove a second portion Z such 
that Z = Y? This is impossible without external measuring. One 
begins with heap or heaps, one separates, one combines. It is a 
kind of concatenation without labeling. One can't say 
synchronically, spatially, that X = Y + Z, but one can say 
diachronically, temporally, that X did equal Y + Z. It is always 
a question of process. tion of drawing the line. The potential

course, which is collapsed from the bandwidth. It seems 
irrelevant to ask about the Khz of this new recording, but we 
might set up the entire experiment in order to create Band1, 
Band2, at any Khz. The question might be, what are we listening 
to? The question might be, what does Band1 represent or in other 
words, how well does it represent the original music? Band1 is 
the music. Band 1 is random. Is it white noise? Does it require 
encoding? Collapse the spikes to a spectrum; listen. With the 
beam-splitter, send part of the wave elsewhere. Then one might 
speculate as to alien intervention. This is a way for an alien 
to accompany or construct music here on earth. Or rather, to 
interfere. But of course it is random, and no one or nothing 
(alien, observer here, observer there) has anything to say about 
it or through it. It is hardly a signature, is it? got a clue,

Voyeur = "person practicing voyeurism" Just as it's possible to 
construct digital image filters from mathematical formula, and 
text filters using the program Jim Reith designed, it's also 
possible to construct filters that act upon the 
recording/residue of human behavior. In all of these situations, 
one might consider a unary filter such that f(x) = x+0 or x*1, 
similar to the protective glass filter used on camera lenses 
(but not the UV filter). With a camera for example, a neutral 
density filter is x/n, where x is lumens; the filter for digital 
images is similar, and the text filter requires that, instead of 
x equalling, for example, a particular position of a word in a 
text, it equals a position rounded to x/n, such that letters or 
words might tend to group or repeat roughly n times. With 
behavior - the x/n applied to the output of motion capture - the 
filter modifies, for example subtended node angles, which are 
diminished in size.  @words = split /[\s]+/, $_; @spaces = split

the pearl of map_rewrite(@), av = (nullv) doctor goodbye 
(rewrite) = jennifer unknowing subject rewrite = rewrite subject 
rewrite = rewrite subject Consider a well-defined entity x, and 
its complement -x. Then x^-x = N, the null set. Consider a 
second entity y and -y, y^-y = N. Think Nx and Ny, the null set 
relativized to x and y. Consider three entities x, y, z, and 
take pairs xy, yz, zx. These are symmetrical yx, zy, xz. Let ab 
stand for a^b. Then xy, yz, zx are equivalent to null. Let x, y, 
z divide a planar region into three regions bordering on each 
other. Let x@y represent a line equidistant from the entities x 
and y. Then x@y, y@z, z@x all meet at a single point. Divide the 
plane so that all entities are grouped in triads; each triad 
meets in a single point. Divide the plane so that these single 
points are grouped in triads and so forth. What branches are 
available? Is a single point reached? To operate with x and -x 
such that x^-x = N is to operate with discrete entities common 
to distributive Aristotelian logic. With codework, meaning 
itself is problematized as a result of entanglement. In Eco, it 
is the code which reaches a destination, not the message. The 
decoding of the message may or may not be equivalent to the 
source. Noise is always already present and is considered within 
the channel. This is the T-model of the parasite described by 
Serres. Eco states "When a code apportions the elements of a 
conveying system to the elements of a conveyed system, the 
former becomes the expression of the latter, and the latter 
becomes the content of the former. A sign-function arises when 
an expression is correlated to a content, both the correlated 
elements being the functives of such a correlation." Code is a 
collocation or system (not necessarily the same) of processes; 
processes are performative; both are temporally-embedded. A 
mapping f(x) = y is not temporally-embedded; thus the mapping of 
the even numbers onto the number system may be considered an 
ideality which is, regardless of temporal processes. The 
structure is given all-at-once within the formula (and its 
proof); its proof is a carrying-out of the truth-value, or a 
revealing of the truth-value, of the structure. until 2-portion 
is empty, i.e. 2-portion = 0 (in which case the 2-portion may no 
longer exist). with the bead from 1 portion returning to the 
undifferentiated plain, and this continues until 2-portion = 0 
(or becomes non-existent). So that from the plain, one gathers 
beads into heaps. The heaps are separated by blanked space, the 
ground-state; this state G = 0. G is always existent; it is a 
territorialization, a boundary, a marker by virtue of lack of 
demarcation. If G = 0 it is 0 anywhere, everywhere that G is. 
Think of it as the Basin in Bon religion, or Kristevan chora. 
Nothing is ever placed within G; G surrounds heaps. New heaps 
may be created, but G is not among them, within them. In this 
sense, G is not a natural number, but a numberless state, not 
even an emptying of number. In this sense as well, the integers 
move from 1 upwards; negative integers might be indicated by 
heaps labeled as negative, but in fact all heaps are of the 
form: HN = | N | where N > 0. Begin with H1 = X and H2 = Y. To 
reach X - Y: Subtract a bead from both; place these beads in a 
third heap H3; carry this operation out until H2 is empty. When 
H2 is empty, H2 = 0 = G, the undifferentiated state, H2 no 
longer existent. But see below, labeling. This depends of course 
on Y < or = X. To multiply X * Y. Create H3 and H4. Move H1 bead 
by bead to H3; each time, add one bead to H4. When H1 = 0 (i.e. 
non-existent), subtract one bead from H2 and place it in H5. 
Then move H3 bead by bead to H1 (which must be created anew - H3 
and H1 oscillating in this fashion); each time, add one bead to 
H4. When H3 = 0 (i.e. non-existent), subtract another bead from 
H2 and place it in H5. We then have H1 = X H3 = 0 (i.e. 
non-existent) H2 = Y - 2 H4 = X * 2 H2 = 0 (i.e. non-existent) 
at which point H4 = X * Y. One might measure X against Y by 
moving string, and in that fashion create an accurate 
multiplication - but only if X/Y or Y/X = an integer. Otherwise 
one is lost without further calculation, fractions, and so 
forth. An exercise: What calculations are necessary? What 
additional instruments? How to remove a second portion Z such 
that Z = Y? This is impossible without external measuring. One 
begins with heap or heaps, one separates, one combines. It is a 
kind of concatenation without labeling. One can't say 
synchronically, spatially, that X = Y + Z, but one can say 
diachronically, temporally, that X did equal Y + Z. It is always 
a question of process. Everything is equivalent; nothing is 
identical. Flows break and fragment at their nodal points 
(computer, television, telephone, face). Internally, every flow 
is equivalent to every other; there is no truth, no truth value 
there / here. Externally, flows are defined by null sets: 0 = 
{x: x not-equal x}. (Null sets are composed of those entities 
not equal to themselves.) What is equivalent within the channel 
dissolves upon exit. "Exit" is not terminal (there are no 
terminal points), but impediments within networks. These 
impediments exist within chaotic domains; there is always an 
element of unpredictability at the interface. Further, action, 
human or otherwise, is not completely transformable into data; 
signifiers and referents leak. 111. A = A (Shelling's identity, 
totality) replaced by 0 = {X: x not-= x} (the null set as 
equivalent to the set of those x not equal to themselves - 
displacement and slippage). 6. Entities "as such" are therefore 
consensual; they "occur" within the habitus. My work is often 
concerned with their relation to the body, to language, 
sexuality, modes of rupture and decay. What ultimately limits 
analysis? Within the clean and proper room, there are "sporadic 
cases" or "anecdotes" on one hand, and "exceedingly small or 
large" quantifications on the other. Within the dirty room, 
adults are at play in the midst of infantile rage. Pleasure is 
non-reductive; it absorbs according to the common-law, xx = x. 
Nothing more or less. 14. And the end is also, imprecisely, this 
"nowhere" or "elsewhere", given through two fundamental 
operations in propositional logic; something I stress over and 
over again, "not-both-A-and-B," and "neither-A-nor-B." The 
former, the Sheffer-stroke, divides and expands; the latter 
projects. Both escape the universe; the former, however, is 
content with it, since [A,B], where A = B, proclaims a certain 
dominion. "Neitherness," however, leaves entirely; the origin 
disappears in the form of a semiotic emission, directionless and 
sourceless, a characteristic of postmodernism. States... on a

equivalent; nothing is identical. Flows break and fragment at 
their nodal points (computer, television, telephone, face). 
Internally, every flow is equivalent to every other; there is no 
truth, no truth value there/here. Externally, flows are defined 
by null sets: 0 = {x: x not-equal x}. (Null sets are composed of 
those entities not equal to themselves.) What is equivalent 
within the channel dissolves upon exit. "Exit" is not terminal

The Equations *

http://www.alansondheim.org/equations.txt

* unabridged
* the mistake I made - previously - was to edit
this down so as to be inclusive upon immediate
accession to the message as delivered. then it
was I thought, better to present the course in
its entirety, where content dominates and swirls
- so this I have done, and equations text is the
true result. next would be to having this read
by machine, all the equations, full or in part, 
as they are included in the text. one would, I 
believe, then have a proper oral description of
the cosmos, much as - and you understand the 
idea here, insofar as it has been presented.




The Equations: the bones


the bones of the equations, the eliminations.
the equations form a skein over us, mother father.
there is a density of equations, a density among
the symbolic, something that lands everywhere and
nowhere at all. here is the scroll of the density
and here are the tablets of the world and its in/
comprehension. here are the words proceeding, here
are the regressions of the world, of the image of
the world and nothing nothing ever changing, of
the world, never changing. the bones of the 
equations, the eliminations, of the flesh, of the
tissue of thought, of mindfulness, here are the
bones of _what is,_ here is _what is._
