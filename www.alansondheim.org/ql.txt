We become a new frontier (for Tom Zummer, who always asks us)

http://www.alansondheim.org/stinkbug.jpg

We'd been entertaining a brown marmorated stinkbug (Halyomorpha halys) for 
a while now - at least a couple of months. A small beautiful true bug, it 
had arrived near the window sill (as had others); we carefully took it 
into our garden and our hearts. That was the last we saw or heard of it 
until this evening, when it suddenly appeared, circling near the ceiling, 
and landing on our 1908 Chinese painting of flowers and birds. I looked it 
up on the Net, of course - only to find out that these insects seek the 
warmth of apartments during the winter, and leave their scent everywhere. 
Other stinkbugs are attracted by the odor, which can become overpowering 
and long-lasting. Sooner or later, we'd have a colony. We realized either 
the bug or us had to leave; Azure gently took it to the same window it had 
entered, and let it fly away.

Now I've put up an image of the bug, a memorial of sorts. Here is what 
Wikipedia has to say about it: "simply jostling the bug, cornering it, 
scaring or injuring it, or attempting to remove it from one's house can 
'set it off'"; "it can make a whole room uninhabitable until aired out, 
and some people are even allergic to the smell."

By the way, this insect hadn't been seen in the United States before 2001; 
we're proud to be early adopters, part of a new frontier, friendly hosts 
for yet another invasive species.


more DNA dance class

additional material from DNA dance classes. dnaclass6 documents a "one 
breath" performance; students danced on one breath, and stopped in their 
tracks when their breath gave out. surprisingly, an older man outlasts the 
rest of the students. in dnaclass7, exercise-performances involving 
choreia are presented. 7 is only a very short segment. what was amazing 
was the spirit of the students, who were moving awkwardly, deliberately, 
and learning/unlearning so much in the process. the classes were taught by 
Foofwa d'Imobilite and myself; my own role involved Second Life material, 
sound, and occasional goading and performance suggestions. Oh but we had a 
good time.

What interests me about these exercises is their contradicting the usual 
assumption of balance and purity in philosophy and dance. Here, dancers 
move from one limitation, one exaltation, to another. I think of the 
exhaustion Levinas describes in existence and existents as philosophical 
counterpoint; this is hardly the wide-awake state of Sartre's cafe life in 
Being and Nothingness. Exhaustion is inescapable, as is stroke for 
example. To write from a position of exhaustion or illness, is to write 
from a prison beyond prison - to wryte otherwise. And the same is true in 
exaltation; one carries through, is carried by, the moment; one is others; 
others are among one.

These movements are voluntary, however, and they extend the range of 
performance. There's an uncomfortable edge in this, since there are people 
who permanently inhabit similar states. These movements, however, are not 
imitative; but performances that draw on any number of sources such as 
choreia, dancing mania (for example St. Vitus' and St. John's dances), 
maenadism and other dance/ecstatic rites, hypnotic displays, neurasthenia, 
shamanism, and even animal movements.

3 qin songs

http://www.alansondheim.org/qina.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/qinb.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/qinc.mp3

Years ago Nikuko was wandering near a crossroads where an inventor of 
musical instruments plied his wares. That is to say, he operated a 
combination laboratory and shop. He created qin with wires at cross- 
purposes, slant like certain guitar harps with one course angled against 
another. He created qin with wires fixed at one end, the other nothing but 
air. He combined the two instruments into one, with traditional dragon 
pond and celestial curve. He used seven strings, four and three. The three 
were father, mother, earth. The four were elements, of which the fifth was 
the body of the qin itself. The four strings were below, the three strings 
were above. The four were angled against the three; the three were angled 
against the four. The four were attached at one end, as were the three; of 
the other of the four and the three, nothing but air. Now this was during 
the period of Warring States. Now the strings were played, stopping with 
the left, sounding with the right, harmonics with the left and stopping 
with the right, but sometimes both with both and sometimes nothing with 
nothing. The inventor of musical instruments would play this instrument 
among all others, he loved this instrument above all others. And it would 
hardly sound, and the strings, like the Warring States themselves, would 
tangle. Their tangling and untangling is their song, he said to Nikuko, 
and their song is my song as well. It is the song of the brane (crane?), 
and ground-song of the universe. All I do, with skill and delicacy, he 
said, is keep them safe, sound when I can and unsound when I can, and the 
rest is in the doing of strings, what they ordinarily do, when they are 
fairly long, tied at one end, lose in the wind at the other. It is a poor 
qin to be sure, he said, but an excellent kite, and someone will always 
play such an instrument. Later generations, however, fixed the strings at 
both ends, and in their struggle to free themselves once more, music was 
born. (But this doesn't make sense, Nikuko said, since he was an inventor 
of musical instruments in the first place. I didn't say he was any good, 
Jennifer replied, Yes, an inventor in the first place, but in the second, 
none of them worked.)

( In the three songs, one and two are uncanny, three a healing across the 
surface of a wound, one and two and three at angles. And in two and three, 
the sounds of the silk and wood, creaking, adjusting, twisting; one hears 
the qin in the qin. And in one as well. )

The Curious

movement of philosophies; while existentialism is the philosophy of abject 
substance, deconstruction is the thought of the virtual/cyber frame. The 
former disappeared as an extractive industry with faltering natural 
resources; the latter expanded as a software of the text.

I used to love existentialism when I was a kid, but now my references are 
limited to the following, across the broken trajectory of writing for the 
past couple of decades (culling 'existentialism' from the Internet Text):

"of Godard or the avant-garde has given way to a now empty existentialism
[... 8 lines removed ...}
Introduction to Heideggerian Existentialism/Exoteric Teaching/The Dialog"

There were a meager ten lines out of the entire Internet Text (which func- 
tions as a psychoanalytical trope in this instance) - even though one of 
the major strands of the work is that of abjection/annihilation; even the 
vocabulary of the 'hole' is analyzed in detail.

On the other hand, references to deconstruction are too numerous to list 
or analyze; it appears everywhere in the work. It's as if there's a 
replacement philosophy for every philosophy, a replacement philosopher for 
every philosopher. Deconstruction appears, ends up appearing as a radical 
(non)-methodology for inhabiting often contrary subtexts - and this occurs 
popularly in one of two ways: deconstruction proper, involving extremely 
close readings and erudition; and a form of skittering deconstruction, 
within which the (Web or) frame scratches against the boundaries of genre 
or canon. It's this latter which appeals: a text need not be read, but 
situated, and the situating carries the tags and http of analysis. In this 
sense, deconstruction presences the virtual text. This isn't the decon of 
Derrida, but the word and technology has escaped the proper name. So there 
is a decon of Chaucer, a decon of Obama, a decon of global warming. We 
inhabit this era. We participate in it. The Internet Text participates in 
it and perhaps an unfortunate result is a glibness of depth which itself 
is subtextual, always already present and deeply unaccounted for.

In any case, with existentialism, with decon, there's no advance proper; 
at best there are veerings haunted by media, world pictures, language 
games, and romantic aspirations. Science, as if it were elsewise, proceeds 
apace, however, a form of circumlocution, as if always already present as 
well, and deeply accounted for.

The results of culling 'deconstruction' from the Internet Text:

"                             deconstruction,

- framed, as one might expect, by _a diacritical paragon._

Hi! What's your name?
Well, distance in inscription is problematic, let's get started! Let's

Let introjection: supine body in supine body inversion be our primary

Well, abjection: body supple or supine already constructs soft trouble for

Do you feel your gender is close to abjection: body supple or supine?

Q. What was the occupation of the Vates?
A. The study of philosophy and the works of nature; and, indeed, every art 
and science that could contribute to excite the astonishment and fix the 
_veneration_ of the people, who regarded them as demigods, _endowed_ with 
more than mortal wisdom and _illuminated_ by _celestial inspiration._
(From Pinnock's Catechism of the History of England, 1836)



Philosophy about Music 

Music has nothing to do with sound. Music is virtual. Music is production. 
Music is the production of music. Music aligns with materiality. Music 
negates substance. Music is swallowed by time. Music is spatial extension. 
Culture is music. Musical culture is not music. Music is unauthored. Music 
plays organism. Music is the mode of non-substance. Substance corrodes 
music. Music is material production. Music structures music. Music is 
mathesis. Music is rational number. Music is allegiance to a world. Music 
is wording world. Music is worlding word. Music is the real time of time. 
Music is the unreal space of space. Music is not abject. Music is not 
song. Music is not instrumental. Communication is the production of music. 
The virtual is production. Music is communication. Spatial extension is 
swallowed by time. Spatial extension is unauthored. Material production is 
mathesis. Worlding word is not song. Song is not wording world. Rational 
number is allegiance to a world. Wording world is worlding word. Song is 
abject. Music is the production of music. The production of music is the 
mode of non-substance. Substance corrodes allegiance to a world. Rational 
number has nothing to do with sound. The virtual is music. The negation of 
substance aligns with materiality. Substance corrodes the real time of 
time. Rational number is not instrumental. Song is not the unreal space of 
space. Material production has nothing to do with sound. Culture is not 
instrumental. The real time of time is the unreal space of space. Worlding 
word plays organism. Wording world plays organism. The unauthored is not 
abject. Allegiance to a world is unauthored.

Internet philosophy, myself

                                                                      edge
==========================================================================

How what I do is or is not the philosophy of the Internet. Well, it is 
written here, that is, as a production if and when you read this; it is 
then reproduced, flickering at a steady and unacknowledged rate. The 
"here" - where it is written - is a doubling; one must take into account 
the location of this computer, this keyboard, perhaps this consciousness - 
and one equally must take into account the location of its (re)formulation 
at your end of things, its appearance on your screen. But who is the "one" 
who needs to take this into account - who "must" take this into account, 
and where is this one? Even if this were in an older print medium: Who and 
where is this one? And if this were an other theory, with an other osten- 
sible subject/content - what then? Would the location and exigencies of 
textual production figure into its content, beyond red patches and sexual 
confessions? How would a tourist play into this? Again, would the location 
of your (book or journal) reading pre-figure as well, con-figure the text 
itself? Clearly screen refresh rate, flicker, would be of no account - 
unless, of course, by virtue of a grandfather clause, a patriarchal 
structuring of reading-in-reverse. Consider the page at refresh-rate zero; 
it is then a situation of presence or absence, constituted by lighting 
elsewhere in the room. What of this lighting? Candle or lantern, incan- 
descent or fluorescent; I have almost forgotten to include daylight, as of 
no account or perhaps intrusive into the thickness of the presentation. 
For I am speaking, above all, of this thickness, this thick transmission 
which portends analysis _of_ a subject, the subject _of_ the philosophy of 
the Internet - as if there were such a philosophy, as if there were an 
Internet (from which a subject, a subject of interest, may be drawn). 
There are internets, intranets, clouds, and the appearance of an Internet, 
which surely, as a collocation of protocols, users, energy sources, appli- 
cations - and so forth and so on - is an irreducible multiplicity, perhaps 
a multiplicity of multiplicities. The days of PDAs and lunchbox computers 
are long gone and cellphones are on their way out; what replaces these and 
more is a continuous and granular technological dialog with both striated 
and catastrophic results. Striated - since every communication mode needs 
a relatively structured system of channels; and catastrophic - since every 
mode teeters on the verge of unknown others. The dialog itself changes, as 
do venues and production modes. Even the electronic may give way to the 
quantum, just as the electrical gave way to the electronic, and the 
mechanical gave way to the electrical. There may be hinge technologies - 
the dynamo or vacuum tube - but their predictive value is always problema- 
tic (think of cassette tapes or radium/uranium therapies). If one thinks 
past these issues, there are still others: those of buffering - for what- 
ever one thinks or writes here has to be held in abeyance for imminent and 
perhaps immanent access - and those of more or less permanent storage 
(forget, for the moment, technological obsolescence and parasitic noise 
and decay). In this sense, what one has is a mess of stutterings, retarda- 
tions, expulsions, potential wells, electronic and mechanical devices, 
codecs, codings and decodings, not to mention the hermeneutics at work in 
interpretation, meaning-construction, absorption and reply. Now when one, 
that _one,_ puts all of this together, the mess inheres and it seems as if 
this were clearly not the way to go, is if there were another way or 
collocation of ways, or perhaps no way at all. So studies perhaps attempt 
delineation and explanation, or description and unwieldy personal experi- 
ence re/presenting simultaneously as subject and object. Everything - 
psychology, technology, engineering, linguistics, electronics, cultural 
studies, semiotics, gender issues, sociology, anthropology, deconstruction 
- these and everything else - figures into an analysis which is always 
uncontrollable, unaccountable and unaccounted-for, and what of this analy- 
sis when one can't even harbor a beginning or abstract, a sketching of 
grounds to be covered and uncovered - as if there were no grounds, and as 
if abstraction itself were lost in body, inscription, and protocol? For if 
this isn't the case, it's part of the cases, casements, engineering and 
construction of what is always fuzzily under erasure - one can't look at 
anything, watch anything even, without economies of attention and elec- 
tronics flowing messily in every (directionless) direction. A mess is 
always a mess, always inseparable, but a mess might have components, might 
have a spectrum of sorts. So is this, what I write, have written, the 
philosophy of the Internet? A philosophy of the Internet? Of the Inter- 
nets? Of the tubes of the Internets? Of the information highway? Of the 
commons? Level playing field? I have no idea, not even of a certain binary 
that may or may not underlie each and every letter you* are reading, or 
have read, or might have read or would have read, if you are situated, 
that is for a moment (and that moment is modernism), before this text, as 
it is constituted or reconstituted, this text, or any other text, for that 
(virtual) matter; one ends with ellipsis...my three little dots...[...] - 
one fails (I fail), neither a beginning nor an ending, she

==========================================================================

*you: Who is this you, who has been this you? For example: "its appearance 
on your screen": What of possession, of a habitus falsely taken for gran- 
ted? Where is the tourist here? Why must _one_ take this or that into 
account? Why is this, why has this been or not been, (a, the) philosophy 
at all? Again - there are so many holes - "Even if this were in an older 
print medium": How is a text _in_ a book? In a page? On a page? Is a book 
a print medium? Does a book have any relevance here? If this were in an 
older print medium: What is the "this" that, seemingly, has been freely 
and effortlessly transported? Is such transport possible? (Someone weeps: 
I'm not guilty, it's not my font...)

Philosophy of memory from the Greek Anthology (trans. Paton):


XIV 45: Enigma (skin, sex, memory)

  I am black, white, yellow, dry, and wet; and when you spread me on the 
plains of wood, by Ares and the hand I utter, speaking not.
  Answer: The wax spread on writing tablets. By Ares is meant the steel 
stylus.

XIV 56: On a Mirror (memory, imaginary)

  If you look at me I look at you too. You look with eyes, but I not with 
eyes, for I have no eyes. And if you like, I speak without a voice, for 
you have a voice, but I only have lips that open in vain.

XIV 60: On a Writing-Tablet (wryting, suture, body)

  Wood gives birth to me and iron reformed me, and I am the mystic recept- 
acle of the Muses. When shut I am silent, but I speak when you unfold me. 
Ares alone is the confidant of my conversation.

XIV 108: Another (chora, body, book)

  I have nothing inside me and everything is inside me, and I grant the 
use of my virtue to all without charge.
  Answer: A mirror.

XIV 110: Another (dreamwork, mirror, chora, memory)

  No one sees me when he sees, but he sees me when he sees not; he who 
speaks not speaks, and he who runs not runs, and I am untruthful though I 
tell all truth.
  Answer: Sleep.



experiments with sullen truths


aphorisms of extreme depression were set down and effaced.
the form of effacement was repeated mechanization of textual filters.
the form of effacement remained incomplete.
elimination of duplicates aided in rendering the chaos invisible.
parsing of certain letters resulted in extensive rewrites.
in shame and embarrassment i turned away from the devastating results.
there was still work to do in the remnants of tawdry depression.
i thought "elimination without concern" was a necessary path.
i thought mechanization of the word picture would devastate language.
no matter what method was used, the pathos of language remained.
it seemed entangled language and emotion recognized no horizon.
still i persevered with constant rearrangements in scan after scan.
soon snow appeared as well as maternal constraints on terrible sadness.
soon there were welcoming arms in the stuttering fragments of words.
culling nothing, i remained shaken but alive.

cinema of weather and virtual objects

http://www.alansondheim.org/virtual.mp4

you say cinema, but this is clearly a video construction;
you say tv, but where are the cameras, the lights and actions;
it is true real weather that is the action;
and it is the lights of the city that are the lights of cinema;
wait you say, but where is the camera of this cinema;
the camera is in the house, i cry, the camera is in the house;
and it is not the camera of cinema, it is the camera of video;
for it is not the camera of television, but the camera of debris;
and where does debris take us, but to the grotesque of the virtual;
surprise of the virtual in the midst of true-real weather;
you say weather, and this is clearly a construction of weather;
the weather is out of the house, the weather is outside;
you say the weather is outside of everywhere and everything;
the weather murmurs its own grotesque of the world (i say);
look around you, the weather's taking over, here are its minions;
here are its minions and here is the image of cinema and tv.



what i meant to say was

Trying to make a piece out of my twitterings, god I have nothing to give 
the world but my brain to science (hopefully after death). Send me money 
for why. Maybe I make big book listening to T'boli chant and instrument, 
about professors and irs haters killing spree american empire downfall. Oh 
lord, what's happening, i go onto this and suddenly there's this request, 
no idea how to fill it, wish i could do some tricky stuff here TODAY I 
WILL NOT BE DEPRESSED! (promise broken :-( Fear of death mingled w/sex. 
nightmare. trying to get my digital work archived before i'm (im)properly 
dead. I HATE BEING AN "HISTORICAL" FIGURE - screw my past work! and if 
everyone sends me $18000, I'll have what? well, this didn't go anywhere; I 
didn't get a cent. Have to try something new... if everyone who follows me 
sends me $ I will have $300 however if everyone sends $300 I will have 
$18000, enough to live on for a year! Thanx. but there's uglyfruit again 
for us and all is not lost. Why does everyone in the Winter Olympics 
require "redemption"? the ch'in (guqin) may be older than I thought, back 
to the Ming; reading about the Rwanda genocide; NY Times depressing 
editorial... I need 900 followers. Why? Why? Why? i think will sleep 
later. too much psychological debris...


silk and wood

w/echo towards immanent tonality
w/out towards imminent tonality
immanent = roof. imminent = throat.
qin with echo is _architectural._
every sound becomes singularity or galactic object.
i think this is what music should be.
i think this is my heritage.
i give my heritage to the history of humanity.
my heritage is wood and silk. the end. goodbye.*

*wood and silk have given them to me.
*i am comfortable with them.
*i am comfortable with wood and silk.
*wood and silk are the heritage of humanity.
*it was wood that was swinging and silk that was
very still. now it is silk that is swinging and
wood that is very still.
*humanity is the heritage of silk and wood.

Doing music among the digital, philosophy in real-time

==========================================================================

so beginning, a list of topics (re)created almost in a dream or trance 
state:

==========================================================================

1. presence of flesh. Investing in playing a physical instrument of the 
traditional type involves thinking through the presence of flesh. Playing 
string instruments for example results in constant manicuring: nails, 
skin, and muscle are shaped, exercised, and controlled, as much as 
possible, using operations that seem efficacious. Work-arounds, kludges, 
are also cultivated so that, for example, if a nail splits or muscles 
cramp, other means of continuing play are available. One is never far from 
the flesh, which asserts itself during production. (The production perhaps 
is also the production of flesh, of a certain inscribing of flesh.)

==========================================================================

2. what the flesh can do. The flesh inheres between interior and exterior, 
mind and sounding objects in the world. The flesh is both subject and 
object; the player intends through tending. The flesh of the mind and body 
is of the fabric of time, inheres within a phenomenology of human time- 
consciousness that absorbs and renders a body within musical production. 
The body is continually rendered during production, both present and 
forgotten, autonomic and abject-inert. (Human time-consciousness: think 
organism time-consciousness as well: what constitutes flesh, then; what 
constitutes sounding objects?)

==========================================================================

3. recoil of the body. The body recoils from forgetting, stating its 
limits which are the limits of production in the world. The recoil is 
that of death: beyond this speed or stretch, for example, one cannot go. 
This is usually taken for granted, set-aside, just as the sounds of flute 
or saxophone keys, or cello bow reversal, are set aside, but it - this 
barrier - is integral to musical production. Let me also place, then, 
under the aegis of recoil, all those sounds, necessary and often consid- 
ered parasitic, accompanying what one is intending; I also assert that it 
is these sounds, subtextual, almost subterranean, that constitute the 
true-real of music, that assert world and worlding among a displaced 
purity - which, however, already harbors the digital at its core. (I 
assert? one asserts... is asserted...)

==========================================================================

4. tending the real. As with the tending of flesh for playing, there is 
also the tending of the real: what one plays is tended-to, placed with a 
potential potential well, keeping an instrument safe and ready for 
production. As with everything else, instruments tend to decay; if this 
isn't checked, the music itself falls apart, and tending the real moves 
from the autonomic to control of anomaly in production - for example, 
taking into consideration finger-board warping, pad leaking, or small 
cracks that might develop in chromatic harmonicas. (Of course this also 
reinscribes the music, which is now of these anomalies as well, part and 
parcel of production.)

==========================================================================

5. irreducibility. Because of parasitism, the history of an instrument, 
the tendencies of the flesh and the real, the very moment of sonic produc- 
tion is irreducible; technique only goes so far, even on an electronic 
keyboard. To the extent that production occurs in real-time, unless one is 
using a digital recording device (and perhaps even then, outside of 
keyboard), what one is doing possesses a fundamental surplus or Benjaminic 
aura that differentiates one session from another, one musician from 
another, as if there were unique events in real-space, real-time. This is 
basic to rock-thought, punk-thought, and musical romanticism; it is also 
fundamental to music itself. Even one replay of a digital recording (cd 
for example) is different from another, as habitus and environment subtle- 
ly change. The industrial revolution resulted in equivalent instruments 
(for example the Boehm flute or saxophone), but their presence is always 
of separation and a unity that speaks of communality, as in horn sections 
of big bands or orchestras. (Or think, for example, of violins-in-unison: 
clearly differentiable!)

==========================================================================

6. inhabiting in real-time. Instrument and player inhabit real-time; so 
often in improvisation, for example, what occurs, occurs in an expanded 
present that appears horizonless, if it appears at all. Rather, there is 
the continuous doing and undoing of structure, remembrance of things past 
and subconscious projection of things future, which may or may not appear, 
as the dialog between instrument and player may take one elsewhere than 
what one has 'thought,' if such projections are of thought (and not, for 
example, of a pauseological nature) at all. (Pauseological: subterranean 
structure not yet 'filled' or fulfilled, a basic concept in enunciation.)

==========================================================================

7. 'purity' of structure. I am playing something and the doing and undoing 
of structure is of the purity of structure, undermined and presenced with 
and among the abject. The purity of structure is the purity of the world; 
in this sense the world is always (already) pure, just as wave equations 
and quantum fields are pure. We drift towards greater levels, macro-levels 
in the world, ignoring the fine-structure or seething granularity that 
constitutes the cosmos - ignoring (for it appears deeply unknowable and 
irrelevant) the generation of dynamic objects and information, from which 
or of which, we may be, along with those objects and information, only 
projections at a distance. So a purity of structure, seething structure 
always (already) under deconstruction, is the constitution of the cosmos 
within which we play, unknowingly, that constitution and its harmonic
deconstruction.

==========================================================================

8. deconstruction of 'purity' of structure. This goes literally without 
saying, a deconstruction through the presencing of noise: look at the 
dialogic/dialectic: between noise and structure, abjection and purity, 
flesh and sounding, metaphor and explanation - all occurring within time, 
within the real-time of improvisation. So improvisation unravels what it 
ravels; in another century, this might have been called the pursuit of 
life itself. (And deconstruction of edge-phenomena: what occurs as 
diacritical or 'curlicue,' peripheral, as well.)

==========================================================================

9. philosophical emergence. On one hand the utterly trivial production of 
music, and on the other, emergence after the face, recuperation of 
critical thought. But critical thought emerges through trivial production; 
it is the interaction of flesh, consciousness, the autonomic, and 
structure, that creates a different discursive space. Every philosophy 
demands a writing which is simultaneously elsewhere than real time, 
inhabited and uninhabited. The room for thought is not the lived thought 
of musical production. Or is it? Is there a philosophy within the real- 
time of its production, a philosophy that perhaps dies or dies out after 
the production itself?

==========================================================================

10. tied into digital habitus. It is the digital that, beyond tissue, 
sickness, and death, inhabits us; it is the digital, unrecognized and 
seething, that we inhabit. Our production within the cosmos is also our 
distance from it, an inauthentic distance constructed from potential wells 
and the remnants of inscriptive processes designed to ward off just about 
everything: death, dream, menses, semen, feces, wounds and illnesses - 
anything (ignorantly? popularly? mythologically?) smelling of pollution, 
discomfort, breakdown of musical structure. This is of course old news; 
what is different is the substrate, violation or virtual fabric everywhere 
and nowhere at all. What does one do with the neutrino? proton? electron? 
quark? Higgs boson? knowledge of the K-meson? Inscription and naming? The 
habitus is the production of sound - or paint, dance, or body, rite, or 
ritual. If there is deity, it is the digital itself, that division among 
virtual + and - (and the rest of it), everything and nothing at all - 
which is also everything. All this (buzzing) confusion disappears in the 
care and caress of the flesh, tending of an instrument or lover, following 
one following through sound through and beyond conclusion.

==========================================================================

11. inhering within the digital. How to do this? From Plato on mud, the 
last sections of Being and Nothingness Duvignaud's Change at Shebika, 
Kristeva's Powers of Horror, Chatterton, Swinburne, Lingis, Gilman, any 
number of contemporary books and theses - one moves through the history, 
phenomenology, and habitus of the abject. When my fingers throb in and 
beyond the act of improvisation, the abject asserts itself. But what is 
this? The residue of inscribing, as well as inscription: the chalk-dust or 
debris of writing, the wearing-down or annihilation of inscription: the 
presence of inscription and philosophy as real-time phenomena - events, 
not occasions, processes, not states. (The aegis of the digital kernel, 
its processes, undermines the horizon.) Improvisation is living through, 
and recognizing, the simulacrum, the uncanny and imaginary habitus; it 
draws worlds under erasure. As organisms, we are among ourselves; as 
producers of sound, we vibrate woods and metals and skins and air and 
worlds, things in the process of unthinging. We slide against ourselves, 
absorb and project the analogic, retain a sense of continuity, forgo 
inescapable and alien truth. From music we know that we emerge from the 
virtual; the vacuum and its energy are in our bones. Philosophy enters, 
passes through, and disappears; philosophy grounds our unknowingness as 
organisms, tethers us for a moment: philosophy dreams the unaccountable, 
accountable; philosophy murmurs the habitus of essence and existence, 
purity and impurity, analogic and digital; philosophy creates inscription 
under the sign of erasure; philosophy is not; philosophy _becomes._

Why water flows downhill. 

The slalom crashing over the edge, we're in midair, I'm running downhill 
and I can't really look to see where I'm going or whose berm centered on 
it. Oud follows the wad; a sea arises there. Nikuko made the music to 
reflect, water filled the land, flowed into the rapidly churning air: air 
loomed in the middle, the very middle of the air, the very stones in the 
middle of the air, "loomed in the middle the very middle of the air very 
air stones."

(Snow-gave out, gone down, snow-go downhill, snow-grant, snow-granulation, 
men ran to and fro dreaming of where to go.)

       this Lunarcharsky for futurism.
     digital futures
  you? You've written of futures - possible futures, for the beautiful,
 beautiful futures out of drowned, invisible, submergence,
details details pictures images future this futures world it all it this 
its digital futures its beautiful drowning,
sail like a great ship of state into uncharted waters, darkened futures, 
futures, & I will love you, will love you forever. My darling, I am
the future and I won't even be there, I leave you this presence of
 futurism, and because, among the beautiful drowning, i will not be there,
  and because i will not be there, and among them, you will see me there,
   among starlight futurisms
    among stars and nighttime skies, O Skies! I shall not see these,
      i shall not see these, i shall not see these skies, these seas,
         i shall not see them, O Skies! O Seas!




The Sorrowful Playnte and the Music


"For all of playnte my song is sett, Wich long hathe served and nought can 
gett. A faithefull herte so trulye mente Rewardid is full slenderelye."

"Each morn I wake, pray soule to take;
Before I do things evil, rash, I order ye to gie me cash."

"To be olde, alas, and destitute, my poem not worth a farthing,
What would best me, but eternal gath'ring?"

"I canna face the Warld again, Makar and Maker walk among them."

"For tis a young man's world with young men's girls,
A young girl's earth, to art and love give birth."

no looking condensates

when the last vestige of organism has left the world
and the world's dissolved like fermions crowding nothing
and angular momentum's huddled poor are autonomic
then bosons crash the party making light of everything
and something comes along giving mass a shove
then neutrinos emptied shuttle back and forth
and signs change signs while commutators rule the day
oh dream oh fantasy oh uncanny phantasm 
then enormous particles from the greatest machines
the length and energy of cosmic manifolds
do something making worlds and organisms left behind
and where are we when we're dissolved like prairie fire
neutrons forgetting their sense of belonging atoms
their sense of quality of molecules stones and bones
on the other side of dreams we think things open up
though annihilation shrinks states and matter freezes up
everything bottoming out in dirac seas or fermionic spheres
look what the shore has brought us, some new condensates

uuu, nothing more

sometimes you get up in the morning or go to sleep
and there's this thing gnawing at you that Kristeva describes
it won'tlet you go yet there's one thing you can do
anything you can do well will do for you and others too
then the claws withdraw and in any case somethings' to be said
for beauty and sleep that change course in mid-dream
