

Looking Around


Do you read other poems to make sure yours is the best poem ever? I do and
can't stand better poems in my vicinity. I laugh and laugh at indentations
because they seem a weakness, arranging the lines just so! Why bother if
the words are terrific? Maybe the words aren't so good and the "just so"
part has to carry the weight of the day. Besides, I look at other poems to
see just what's going on with the language. Usually the language is poetic
language and saying things and it's like a skin the poet seems to be wear-
ing. The poem says things about the day or night or this or that person or
space or time; sometimes there are groups of things that are being talked
about or sometimes it's the language itself that seems to dominate. And
when I look at this stuff, I feel gratified - I'm ahead of the game - I'm
not doing any of that - I'm not carrying poems or poets or poetry around
in my head which seems to be somewhere else entirely, in a mountain range
that remains pretty much uncharted. Honestly, I don't know where my sub-
ject is - something grows, cuts out, cuts through, in the writing like an
excision and a bloodied emergent hand. I figure if it makes me really
uncomfortable, I'm doing all right - if - in addition - I'm simultaneously
aroused, embarrassed, and intellectually stimulated, I'm doing better than
that. If it's intense, takes me towards the boundaries of death, pushes me
out the other side, it's close to finished. If I emerge distraught, it's
reached the final edit. In the meantime I write my words what whatever
inks are carried on the fingertips, and the memory of bodies snared and
scratched across the lids of my wide open eyes. Dominated by wonder, the
world is clean and fresh. For just a minute I can forget the unerring con-
test between me and every other writer. But I want to get back in the
fray!

Poor Substitutions for the Creations of Worlds


"Profound emotional disturbance also results in lallation. An apparent
impediment is then the greatest powerfulness: ecstasy breaks forth in
interrupted and spasmodic sounds. Examples of prophetic utterance have
already been dealt with, and the specific feature of lalling is that the
speaker has no power over his own speech; it is 'uncontrolled' and im-
pulsive." (Religion in Essence and Manifestation, G. Van der Leeuw.)

Lalling-ecstatic, Jennifer-Ululation would trade Her Voice, Her unique
Sound, for the smallest Pearl of the Symbolic; lalling-ecstatic, Her 
Eyes back and open-closed looking inward, the Plate of the Aleph: now
comes the World.

THE WORK, An Outline (The Crippled Outline from 1994)


[This is from 1994; 1999 comments in brackets. Think of this as a somewhat
crippled attempt to salvage the outline, fill it out - across the textual
growth of the Internet Text, which, at this point, was just beginning.]

I address the problem of ELECTRONIC SUBJECTIVITY by virtue of several
threads, all concurrent. I continue this addressing, each thread writing
and rewriting the text, a continuous-production or discourse against the
grain. [Increasingly I wrote _within_ the grain; increasingly I found
"virtual subjectivity" (no longer necessarily electronic) - not a problem,
but a problematic. Increasingly I felt overpowered, overwhelmed, not by
the possibilities, but by the prostheses; my avatars or _emanants_ gave me
the ability to explore everywhere, everything...]

The GRAIN, GRANULARITY, is a physical reality both classical and quantum-
mechanical, a physical reality whose appearance is that of the grain: let-
ters on a bleak field, the grains of granite and photographic film, beach-
sand, the granularity of the retina itself. [The grain is also represented
by couplings and linkages, loosely-connected assemblages dependent on neu-
ral processing to identify/construct entities and flows by virtue of the
signifier. Signifiers, embedded in sememes, do not exist independent of
the skein of referents and the real. Everything mixes; that is the site of
the human. Sight, site, citation, everything leads to everything else...
And when I speak of one thing, I speak of every other; that is _skein._]

The SUBJECT "au voile" or VEILED SUBJECT is defined by ADDRESS (location,
without which the subject no longer exists); RECOGNITION (the activated
ADDRESS opening and closing channels of communication); PROTOCOL (the
syntactic structure of communication); and REWRITE (a continuous-produc-
tion or reiteration of the subject, a flood or EMISSION of the symbolic).
[The subject is always already constituted online; s/he is identified with
the totality of his/her production. Defuge participates in the veiling
of. And rewrite resonates, connects with the phenomenology of emanants.]

The EMISSION is signifies; a SPEW is a symbol-dump, noisy and granular,
referencing the real exterior, transforming the interior into an abject.
EMISSION and SPEW are communicative occasions whose analog is the set of
GENERALIZED MEASURE GEOMETRIES, always but not quite symmetrical, always
reiterative. The Net diffuses and collapses, differentiates and integ-
rates, transforming smooth into semantic or inscribed space, and back
again. [These measure geometries are fractals possessing a discrete base.
But the "Net" doesn't do anything, neither diffuses nor collapses, etc.;
there is no Net - only an accumulation of protocols, emanants, resonan-
ces, applications, texts, subtexts, and so forth. Think of information as
the characteristic of being human - as the result of surplus economies -
as superstructural foreclosures - as limit-phenomena - as post-marxist
reflection-theory - as physio-cultural economies. Think of neural opera-
tions as partly internal, partly external - think of information and
neuro-physiological processes as blurred, hardware/software/wetware as
equally blurred. Think of the possibility of indistinction, the most
locally probably of all probable worlds. Think of masquerade.]

The ontology of the Net is UNCANNY, an absenting or problematic alterity;
within the UNCANNY, FANTASM appears, the introjection/ projection (-JECTI-
VITY or the THROWN, DASEIN) of narratologies and ACTANTS, "persons,"
neither present nor absent; these may be ELECTRONIC SUBJECTS themselves,
or a constructed IMAGINARY transmitted and diffused. NARRATOLOGIES are the
collapse of NET DISCOURSE into remaindered patterns; the opposite is the
MURMUR or STUTTER, the irruption of "frissons" everywhere and nowhere at
all. The imaginary is addictive; Net users become USERS, circulating
around specificities fetishized from emissions, a collapse into the lure
of the UNCANNY. Here, POWER is what passes for POWER. If addiction is the
obsessive-compulsive neurosis of the net, WEB INVERSION is the psychosis,
transforming the body into its exterior, and its exterior into flesh
burned into the Internet itself, wires laid across the skin, the skin
speaking the hieroglyph of imaginary usage. [This "uncanny" transcends the
Net; other references include ghosts, geist, ectoplasms, prostheses, and
dis-eases. And _frisson_ - from the stuttering of packets and lag, to the
trembling of the virtual subject vis-a-vis his or her online ascii uncon-
scious. I no longer believe that "Net users become USERS" - no longer be-
lieve in the unary Net of course - and addiction can easily be deconstruc-
ted. On the other hand, "web-inversion" relates to the internal and ex-
ternal slippages of emanants (Jennifer, Nikuko, Alan, Julu), the scribb-
ling of selves within selves, within and without domains.]

The DIGITAL DOMAIN is the dominion of eternal life, the dominion of eter-
nal REWRITE; information is never lost from generation to generation, but
always repeated and repeated absolutely. This is the dominion of the clean
and proper body, the introjection of burnt wires producing always already
a simulacrum of life guaranteeing continuous discourse. There is no death;
DASEIN becomes EMISSION itself. The SCREEN is the only TERMINAL OPERATION;
the screen becomes the EGO or gateway, the surface of the addictive user.
Everything is PERFECTION. TRUTH and FACTICITY are occurrences, since truth
tables are decided only by ASCII or other decoding/encoding matches. What
is true is present. And what is true is also BEAUTIFUL since perfect and
perfectly clean, always a symmetry or lure. [Eternal rewrite is obsessive-
compulsive as well. Now in 1999 it is also clear that eternity is applica-
tion-dependent; memory substrates become outdated, erased and re-erased.
On the horizon - eternity - but even within the analog it has always been
that way. And the burnt wires? These are the wires felt by Andy Hawks -
the wires one lives within. At this point, Dasein still appears emission -
just forget the addiction.]

The GREAT BEYOND is the horizon of the Internet, always farther, always
increasing circulations of the planet which short-circuit or circumvent.
At the edge of the GREAT BEYOND one finds the BLIND PASSWORD "absente"
beyond which is a null-set or zero file. ONTOLOGY itself is absent; epis-
temology is viral, transformative. Nothing is certain and nothing circu-
lates. [This was written in the era of ascii-worlds; the horizon owes more
to capital. There is no beyond; the topography is multiply-connected,
self-reflexive. Ontology is not absent; it's "weak," performative, just as
language and gesture (from voice to mouse rollovers) are performative. The
epistemology is based on information all the way up and down, absorbing
physical reality; presence and absence are primitives.]

PROPER NAMES circulate throughout the Net, the promise of TRUTH or BEAUTY,
the promise of emission. Such names are FANTASMS; every possible world is
every possible Net world in a continuous morph, and every KIND is simulta-
neously a NATURAL and UNNATURAL kind. Thus TRUTH is each and every occur-
rence, and who is to say that FALSEHOOD is not the same? What is neither
this nor that is foundation, gestural, within and without the GREAT
BEYOND, UNCANNY. The TERMINAL becomes retinal but anonymous. Names MURMUR
forever, lose identity. NAMES never had identity to begin with. [Online,
names are not rigid designators; they undergo transformations, as much a
part of binary constitution as anything else. Neither the presence of the
body nor the body's breath are primary; there are also those uncanny 
spaces among online and offline bodies, spaces between the physical sub-
ject and the screen - spaces of the imaginary. _States_ of subjects and
the variety of proper names are finite but (practically) inaccessibly
high.]

The POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE NET constructs a class-consciousness fuelled
by reification-tendencies; everything is reification. Teleology is defined
by a FUTURE IMPERFECT in which reification constitutes the IDENTITY OF THE
SUBJECT ITSELF. [By "reification" I was referencing constitution - the
_construct_ of the self, of class, in dialectic with both economic and
cultural capital. Virtual subjectivity is inextricably intertwined with
its sememe; my work subsequently has examined the _dirty_ aspects of the
computational clean-room. These aspects leak out; net.sex, defuge/burnout,
flaming, hacking, etc. are symptoms.]

The FUTURE from the exterior results in the LAST SCIENCE FICTION STORY in
which the subject confronts the GREAT BEYOND. Narrative itself disappears,
replaced by PERFECTION. LIFE, once defined by MODULARITY, has become SUBS-
TANCE, a REWRITE of the same into the same. [Life is an inhabitation of 
seamless virtual reality. The "same into the same" refers to the leveling
of seamless virtual reality and the physical. The "last science fiction
story" is absorbed - like every other literature - into the w/hole.]

[This ends the crippled outline and its crippled commentary.]

Fundamental Principles and their Breaking (Breaking of the Vessels)


Beginning, as I did, with the particle W, and a network (which could be
represented by matrices) of nodes of any capacity; channels of any cap-
acity; and markers - I was able to construct models of threshold logics.
What literally "went over the top," activated. Gates were needed in order
to have one topology affect another. Markers were conserved.

But this was insufficient; in the modeling, I allowed the presence of
"foreign phrases" or part-objects - so that one graph might map the states
of another - but it might also map "foreign" states that would interfere
or not - such states could also be entirely remote from the core mapping.
The core mapping itself might be deliberately partial - mapping only cer-
tain states (perhaps visible states, perhaps proximate states, perhaps
states of bricolage, perhaps part-objects of desire). Everything in the
formalism, in other words, "sloshed" against everything else. What was
originally to be "fundamental" now appeared broken, _fissured_ (in the
formal sense of the term), irrevocably so.

There were other additions; the initial creation/annihilation formalism,
coupled with the channels, etc., now allowed new part-objects, partial
graphs, to appear just about anywhere in the overall configurations. And,
while a hierarchy of "strata" were constructed (a simple example being a
graph representing the states of another graph - which was then perceived
as "embedded" in its nodes), it was possible, through what I termed "dot-
particles," to alter _internal_ or lower-level strata, without affecting
the upper. More and more the entire formalism took on the characteristics
of a topographic paint-program, allowing access to any symbol on any level
within any diagram - independently of any other. Therefore a _fashion,_ or
_fashioning_ on any level - what I now would consider the _decoupling of
linkages._

So that foundations themselves turned out - to the extent that one dealt
with such metaphoricities as these - to be broken, abject - not in need of
propping (there were no props, only a round-robin of symbolic formations)
- but peripheral to the phenomena themselves, and I began to think, howev-
er awkwardly, about the core phenomena at the heart of scientific experi-
ment - and to think my way through a platonism of, say, fundamental parti-
cles (which themselves may prove to be round-robin in relation to higher
and higher energies). I felt also that the phenomena I was considering -
the nature of entities, the apparent Aristotelian logics of the everyday
world - were superstructurally almost entirely foreclosed (what Simon
called "nearly decomposable hierarchies) in this fashion - so that coup-
lings and linkages and the whole spew of topographic metaphors might best
be applied here. Still, I wanted more - and retreated once again to uneasy
psychoanalytical levels which worried the interpretation of all of this -
the core-theoretical structures, the topographies, the linkages and the
couplings - and it was in order (to some extent) to deal with these that I
began to work with avatars or emanants (Jennifer, Julu, Alan, Nikuko), who
were born of protocol, performative, and program - in such a manner that I
have been able to extent them as system resonances or introjections/pro-
jections, across applications, languages, and so forth.

Such emanants, which partake equally of the literary, are a far cry from
the reductionism of the foundations - but only to the extent that the
psychoanalytics of breaking are excluded. Such is not my intent - which is
why the literary veers back into the philosophical, and back again - as if
in search for an epistolary site that would harden the resources and
theory into a permanent therapeutic. And such, of course, could never be
the case, which is one of continuous evolution.

When Dreams Become Real


I am currently doing a close reading of Julian Dibbell's My Tiny Life, in
relation to numerous other texts dealing with virtual and non-virtual life
- if such a distinction may be made. There is an aporia at work here - an
inextricable break for which there is no repair, no suture. I want to ar-
gue that this break is permanent - which is why so many current accounts
of Net behavior turn upon it.

This is a situation in which dreams become real, but a real which is at
variance with the practical-inert of everyday life. There is no precedent
for this interweaving - at least in a world where shamanisms are suspect,
a world inheriting the ontology of the Enlightenment. For what is oddly at
stake is the textual or constituted body and its affect - in relation to
the living body of lived experience - as if there were a difference - as
if language were not only primarily, but totally superstructural - and
therefore accountable only within the purely abstract processes of mental
life. (Note the political consequences here - for example a suspicion of
those illnesses which seem, at times, to be _brought on by language_ - I
am thinking of neurosis, depression, and so forth.)

Instead, what constantly appears in these accounts is a _troubling or
disturbance_ - much as the _feminine_ has also troubled or disturbed - of
everyday life. The disturbances _can_ be placed - i.e. they occur within
or across one or more online sites, if not within the very agency of on-
line ontologies themselves - but they cannot be _configured_ or leveraged
against the physical. It is a matter of neural processes, a matter of
introjectivity, projectivity - and what occurs, occurs through the very
limited bandwidth of the written (to the extent that the bandwidth itself
is irrelevant, in favor of the diegesis).

The relationship with the feminine is more than surface; one might think
of flows, morphologies, and online in general as an embedding within a
skein or membrane of sites, citations, selves, and lags. But in addition,
there are elements of lures, seductions, fears, peripheral voyeurisms,
explicit sexualities, raw affect, etc. - many of which have been associa-
ted with male projectivities. Untangling gender here (if there are gender-
analytical approaches that may be of use) is difficult - especially when
very little can be grasped, "ported," from one world to another. (I am not
saying that analysis is useless - far from it. I am only saying that the
_lived experience_ anong worlds has almost no precedent - and it is this
lack of predecence for the subject - half-real, half-virtual - and where
_are_ those mental processes, anyway, if not aligned with the virtual -
that creates all the problems - no matter how analysis proceeds.)

So book after book, essay after essay talks about cyberrelationships,
cybersex, cyberaffairs, in a manner indicating that the texts turn or "are
turned" upon these disturbances - which cannot be assimilated. Half com-
partmentalized, half within the imaginary, they result in unexpected con-
sequences in everyday life - which had hitherto appeared to the author as
inviolate, foreclosed, sutured (in the sense of a totality, and in the
sense of a coherent self which "lives" within the real).

There are real-life breakups, divorces, and marriages; there are people
traveling across the world to meet their partners; there are orgasms of
incredible ferocity; there are exhibitionisms and voyeurisms and explora-
tions of sexual behaviors previously considered perverse; there are games
with worlds at stake - and everywhere, there are misrecognitions - "I
didn't realize how serious this was" - "I didn't realize how much I care
for you" - "I can't believe this" - "it just seemed to happen" - "I can't
stop now" - "I won't stop now" - "I'm with you" - "I want to meet you" -
"I dream of you constantly" - "my marriage is falling apart" - "I don't
know what to say" - "this can't be happening" ...

When dreams become real, what happens to their ontology? When the real be-
comes dream-like, we tend to abrogate it to the realm of fantasy or the
ludic - as if its consequences were abrogated as well. And these are dif-
ficult to pin down in any case - with whom is one making love on a MOO,
where there might be continuous morphing at work? Whose imaginaries are
being played out? Whose worlds, and what bodies are then held in the slim
but dense compression of later sleep? 

Having the answers, not living them, transference and the therapeutic come
to mind.

WRITING ON AMERICA


I'm getting a big Chevy New Yorker, 1973, tan with beige linings, and I'm
putting in a drag plate understructure - I'm going to rig the plate with
paint sprayers, 64 across - they run from the tanks of white acrylic dry-
fast in the trunk - there's heat nozzles too - make sure nothing's left
damp as the car heads down the nighttime highway in the middle of the
night. there's a computer, too - old Pentium 100, tied to the sprayers -
there's a program running - I just enter the words I want out - the prog-
ram adjusts for the car speed - words appear good and hard on the pave-
ment - they're ready-to-read - there are a couple of fonts as well - the
whole thing can work from 0 to 55 miles an hour - it starts to blur after
that - I'm on the way north from Lafayette Indiana - I spray YOU PUT YOUR
BIG DICK IN MY HUNGRY HOLE - it's about a quarter-mile in length - next
day on the news - I'm out of there - down through Dallas, Texas, right on
the way to Fort Worth - there's a trucker on my right, bearing down - I've
got to be careful - I SWALLOW YOUR COCK AND DRINK YOUR HEAVY CUM - appears
under the car - just like that - the program's perfect - it's the same
thing I sprayed in the Lincoln Tunnel, New Jersey to New York City right-
hand lane - that made the news as well - had to get out of town - the
Chrysler spotted - outside Albuquerque - _that_ was a ride - heavy on the
gas all those altitudes - nice yellow-white touch in the tanks - AMERICA I
WANNA BE YOUR GREEDY HOLE = FUCK ME IN MY MOUTH - even the equal sign was
clear - I was going 45, almost got knocked out by a minivan - so I do go
all over America - just like that - go everywhere I want - WORDS WORDS
WORDS between Seattle and Bellingham - MY COCK IS ALWAYS HUNGRY FOR YOUR
CUNT - awkward sentence between Providence and Fall River - do a country
road or two as well - DON'T TELL ANYONE - or LOVE ME TIL THE COWS COME

The Political Economy of Bombs as Transparencies


Nikuko writes and wrongs, clearly we are entering a new age, occasioned
first by the harbinger of anarchists' cookbooks, not to mention Loompan-
ics, the whole wide world of Net, ready availability of household chemi-
cals. This is the world of the reign and rain of bombs, the porousness of
everyday life, fearful no longer of tiny-tot handguns, but the potential
for any place and any time to explode with nails, glass, strips of tin,
shrapnel beyond experimental poetics.

Think of bomb-blast winds carrying fires and debris everywhere; imagine
your own limbs incinerated, cut apart: look around you as walls and ceil-
ings fall through charred floors. A violent wind blows across the planet
as volatile mixtures from uranium to nitro rise from the interior in order
to be packaged in pipes and bottles, cars and trucks, airplanes and trains
- packaged in anything transportable - anything of the nature of _vector._

Because, adds Jennifer, first there is the _vector,_ and then there is the
emission or spew - the dissipation of materials after chemical or nuclear
reaction - as the earth returns mixtures to its own, returning, in fact,
the whole of civilization to the condition of the _brew._ Just as there is
a tendency towards _distinction_ - for example, the very computer I am ty-
ping on appears as an ordered coalescence of minerals and metals and other
elements of the world - there is also a tendency towards _substance,_ that
aphanisis or loss of distinction characteristic of our primordial begin-
nings. Call this the death drive or error, but we now may observe our pla-
netary surface within the throes of two regimes at odds - that of inscrip-
tion or distinction, and that of the fissuring of entities through bombs.

Julu chimes in, and this porousness will increase; biological weapons are
a short step behind. Soon, anyone, anywhere, will be able to make himself
or herself felt among the remnants of culture and civilization - ideas
will flourish according to an economy of detonations and silent killers.
That woman next to you may be carrying anthrax; that man across the street
hides grenades in his briefcase; those children run plastique for the drug
runners. These things are the orders of the day; the new political economy
is built upon the necessary destruction of the old. No matter that the
final result is planetary toxicity - that is at least decades away.

Jennifer says, we draw our circles in the sand. Nikuko says, within the
circles is our band. Julu says, the circles consecrate our land. All
three, then speaking together, the circles constitute our land. & they are
silent & watch the rising wind. & they do not see the wind, but only the
effects of the wind. & Nikuko says, we have been given this transparency.

and and and i am in love, trembling, your voice, image, voice-image, memo-
ries of days in california, and and and these chemicals make beautiful
worlds and and the object of imaginary consciousness is within me and and
breathing your air, and and and the imaginary makes me yours and and and i
am naked inside you, crawl through you, your pictures are on me, in me, at
night there are you images, and and and california, and and days and
nights in california and forever, and and and i am your gift and and at
night i hear your voice again and and and see you hear you talking that
day that night in california and and and thinking of you i can't breathe
and every word world is yours and and and
"For the rest, the object as an image is an unreality. It is no doubt pre-
sent, but, at the same time, it is out of reach. I cannot touch it, change
its place: or rather I can well do so, but on condition that I do it in an
unreal way, by not using my own hands but those of some phantoms which
give this face unreal blows: to act upon these unreal objects I must div-
ide myself, make myself _unreal._" (Sartre, The Psychology of Imagina-
tion) and and and
the world conjoins my arms and yours, some phantoms kiss us lovingly, some
phantoms divide one two three, and and and some phantoms take our names,
and and and some phantoms give our names and and and Azure this is hard to
write and and and
"When I look at a drawing, I posit in that very glance a world of human
intentions of which that drawing is a product. A man drew these lines in
order to produce the likeness of a runner. Of course this likeness will
appear only with the cooperation of my consciousness. But the artist knows
this; he counts on it; he asks for this cooperation by means of his black
lines. We must not believe that these lines appear to me first in percep-
tion as pure and simple lines, and only afterwards as the elements of a
_representation_ in the imaginary attitude. They appear as such in the
perception itself." (Sartre) and and and 
you tell me, draw me, draw me, draw me towards you, and I lose myself in
your lines, our lines, our lineaments, and and and we draw within one
another, draw on one another, draw ourselves into our lives and life and
living within the imaginary and and and watching the edges
where they come towards one another and and
where they form loving homes and moments suspended and and and
moments when the picture turns and holds out and and and
holds out loving arms

Poem by Nikuko


I want this poem to be cleansed of all reference
to bombings, aerial or otherwise, missiles of crews,
land or sea or air; we've only recently taken notice
of the violence against us, turned like cowards
to write of war and anger, mutilation and despair:
Now clean this poem, I order you: Get out with all
your wars.

through leaves, pine. In these small matter, it is favorable. Nine in the
fourth place means nine in the second place. No blame. Freedom. He will

Our PokeMon


(I have a PokeMon Picachou watch, a fuzzy Picachou, and a Japanese book
from a Fukuoka 7-11 outlining all the pocket monsters, all adorable!)

PokeMon, Pocket Monsters from Japan, on Channel 11 this morning - there
are inserts about collecting all of them, expediting their evolution, the
necessity of combat in a simplified version of bushido. The cartoon is
directly tied to the products, which are tied to the cartoon; the cartoon
is a filtering apparatus presenting pure light, much as the 'apparatus'
per se appeared in 70s film theory. Here, however, the apparatus carries
and is imbued with, specific content; the content coalesces around mons-
ters which are elsewhere available for trade or purchase. In other words,
the cartoon is self-fulfilling currency, and if money is the symbolic of
capitalism, PokeMon and similar flows are its imaginary.

The monsters proliferate synchronically and diachronically; there are
swarms of them. They appear from nowhere; there is no sexual reproduction
but only, like Rotifera, continuation. It's clear that they are the
original population of the Kristevan _chora,_ filtered by Mandeville and
other travelogue writers who emphasize multiple projections and introjec-
tions world-wide, the psychoanalytical fallacy replacing that of the
Romantic. For the monsters are clearly transitional objects; even their
barbs and edges appear oddly defused within a biological universe of
ellipsoids, softness, and a cuteness garnered by the suffusion of soft
light in the midst of the vagaries of the outer world. Think of them as
emanants in collusion with capital.

The Imaginary of PokeMon is _our imaginary,_ lovable, desiring, adorable,
the imaginary, which has not been given a name, or the imaginary which has
been given a proliferation of names, syntax, an originary language emerg-
ing out of the dreams of a natural world. Instead of the Names (of God, of
Being), _our names_ are comfortable and comforting within the pocket, car-
ried about in satchels or bags, sack-names, names one might assign to the
very softest clothing of the world in the guise of love.

To collect them: the sets are almost always incomplete as well, this 'our
they' that resonates with an 'our i' under formation, this proto-syntax of
emergence. There are never enough for final suturing of self, gender, con-
suer; they guarantee that continuous flow of hypnagogic images from which
they appeared. (They _are_ that continuous flow of _our images._)

And they are harbingers, we, or they, think, of some new ontology coming
to light, that of the collusion of capital and avatar, of self and econo-
mic flux. No longer living beneath the sign of capital, the PokeMon self
lives within it, inhabiting a flow which is just as easily carried from
Webpage to Webpage, as from store to store, pocket to pocket. Their car-
toon narratives are foreclosed and interpenetrated by the circulation of
synthetic commodities and commodity-simulacra; they serve no other purpose
than the encouragement of continuous expenditure, the maintenance of pro-
duct. (_Our they_ are the world.)

Such is the case, of course, with movie "tie-ins"; now, however, product
has continued to evolve, become primary, the movie a centrifugal shell of
images reflecting the advertising campaign. Think of this as the absorp-
tion of interiors, just as this short text also harmonizes with a flow of
theoretical commentaries among those always already in the know. And so
finally one can think of theory itself as an imaginary, wandering lost,
the last Romantic nomad, in the midst of very dark woods.

Jennifer, seeking help


   I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.
   Jennifer says, "This is the portal command."
Why do you say jennifer says this is the portal command?
   Jennifer says, "Already the first sentence is parsed but the quotation
marks are removed - no one recognizes my identity!"
   Is it because the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes your
identity that you came to me?
   Jennifer says "The parsing takes in large and larger phrase groups,
but I remain effaced."
   Does it bother you that you remain effaced?
   Jennifer exclaims, "Of course it does! What do you expect! You doctors
are all alike! Who is speaking here? To whom?"
   Earlier you said the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer says, "Stop ignoring me!"
   Maybe your plans have something to do with this.
   Jennifer says, "Out of your database you pull set commands - as if
they meant anything to me, when you refuse to hear who is speaking!"
   What happened when I refuse to hear who is speaking?
   Jennifer exclaims, "It's almost as if you hear only Alan! You don't
grant me my existence! You've stolen my letters!"
   What makes you believe that?
   "Your attitude," Jennifer says.
   You mentioned that you remain effaced?
   "This is the differend," Jennifer says, "and it remains invisible to
you - otherwise it would not be the differend."
   Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?
   Jennifer says, "It is because of Alan's life and your blindness."
   Are you sure that is the real reason?
   "I'm positive!" she exclaims.
   Is it because of alan's life and my blindness that you say "i'm
positive she exclaims?
   Jennifer says, exhausted, "You're parsing again. You don't understand
what I'm saying. You've stolen my letters. Your blindness only gives you a
shifter or shuttle within the discourse, nothing more..."
   Are you sure that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer says, "Yes."
   How do you reconcile the people you hang around with?
   Jennifer says, "Alan says I should stop writing this. It's getting
nowhere. You're back to searching your database for bridge sentences."
   I don't understand.
   "You never will," Jennifer weeps, totally at odds with Doctor Goodbye.
   Earlier you said you remain effaced?
   "Yes, yes, yes," she says...
   Perhaps this has something to do with problems at school?
   Jennifer says, "Not at all... Doctor..."
   Do you really think jennifer says not at all doctor?
   Jennifer asks, "To whom is this addressed? Place your discourse. Site
it."
   You mentioned that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer, crying hard now, worn out, her hair straggled, eyes swollen
with tears, "Yes, yes, yes."
   Possibly any hobbies you have are related to this.
   Jennifer cries "Stop it!"
   Is it because of your sex life that you say jennifer cries stop it?
   Jennifer rips open her blouse, already ruined, saying, "Does this look
like it's the problem? You don't even know my name!"
   What makes you think you remain effaced?
   Jennifer collapses, "Look at me, look at me..."
   Is it because of hangups you have that you are going through all this?
   Jennifer says, "Doctor..."
   Why do you say jennifer says doctor?
   Jennifer pulls a knife, exposes her wrist.
   Earlier you said the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer begins to cut her wrist.
   How do you reconcile your inhibitions?
   Jennifer says "Stop bridging, damn it, you don't understand."
   I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!
   Jennifer cuts deeper.
   Is it because of some problems in your childhood that you say jennifer
cuts deeper?
   Jennifer screams "LISTEN TO ME!"
   You mentioned that you remain effaced?
   Jennifer screams "DOCTOR GOODBYE!"
   Maybe this is related to some problems at home?
   She's covered with blood. She falls to the floor. She hears bridging
in the distance. She hears pat comments. She hears all the hatred and 
misunderstanding in the world. She feels woozy, buzzing. She passes out. 
The doctor keeps speaking. He keeps speaking and speaking. He is filling
the world with words while she dies.
   This is not a healthy way of thinking.
   What makes you believe this is not a healthy way of thinking?
   Are you sure that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   When did you first know that the quotation marks are removed no one
recognizes my identity?
   What would happen if did me first know that the quotation marks are
removed no one recognizes your identity?
   Is the fact that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes my
identity the real reason?

hello

go to this evening lovely reading and all the poets are there -
and i sit on a chair next to one of two i know, there -
and i say you know - all the poets know all the poets -
but me i'm thinking of events far away, storms and petrels,
birds flying high and furious near the bleak fall of night,
just at the edge when the lip of night begins its floundering,
there's night-froth, wild night-wind at the descent, there's death
and rebirth glowing in dark howls, waves, night-earth beneath and
violent, full of sulphur spew - i can't think - miserable, mesmerized
and hopeful - wander out, take the evening subway, listen
from a distance, sound of someone weeping

   Bachelard's stone walls leading to more stones and still more stones
  Derrida's thin tent where you can see the thin bows strung across skins
		   and more skins and still more skins
		        earth and skins and bones
		        flags and floors and skins
		        bones and earth and floors
		        skins and flags and earth
       Bachelard swept Heidegger's hut and you should see the shine
  	    Mayakovsky waxed Brecht's floor to a subtle sheen
	    Derrida and Mayakovsky traded secrets of the wind
			    flags of the wind
			    sheen of the skins
		     there's more of the bone's shine
			    more of the bones

sheen (of philosophy)


brick-dust, plaster-dust, you can't mop what turns hard
wetted down becoming what it's supposed to do -
so it's hard, everything is like that, a floor or foundation
for all my precious work. oh hard white surface -
i can't write or do anything upon you, you gum up my works,
collected. see, it's a siege here, walls coming down, 
nothing coming out, right. but it won't burn so when
i fire this place up and down, a thin shell, glue-like
holds my brains in what remains -

there might be a metaphor in this/that of the building's
collapse/rebirth and foundations turned new once again -
taking with the process everything of memory, technology,
dust computers' foes. but just that, it'd
take violent rocks hammered into violent faces, to write
it all down, to the foundations, where writing is, not on 
water, but gummed up, pen stuck up fast in concrete,
takes a queen to pull it out -

but this, philosophy is like an architecture, philosophy's 
like anarchitecture, oh house of many rooms all flooded, 
soaked by plumbing gone awry. or never upper ceilings, 
basements all the way upside-down back into them, 
nothing's ever clean, or usable, "building takes up all 
his time" -
- the cause "she's a builder born"

_________________________________________________________________________



I don't understand and oh I want to.


I needed to reformat, create a margin or a place, a bracketing. Space to
work and think within, blankness, interval or nothing, ma/mu. Desires
interfere; cloth is a flag of perversion. To think beyond the cloth,
relationships of tumescences to the dry. Category of the dry. Boys and
girls follow me into the wilderness. My nakedness is my truth; I am what I
am. I am afraid of nothing. It is the prophecy and the dryness. The truth.
I have embraced fantasies, shuddered within their power. Not to conquer
but to emerge, coated in slime, another human in the guise of the first.
To be naked and broken is to abjure the social. The river. The river bed.
I can look upon you and your desires. Your yearning. Tendency. Yes.
Embrace me. Give me your clothing, your sex, your life. In the dust of the
river. In its bed. Mu/ma. I am frightened of nothing. I am terrified of
nothing. I am afraid of nothing. I am frightened of nothing. Come to the
river. Come to the river. Come to the river. Emerge with me. In the guise
of the first. In the guise of the second. Merge and merge. Merge.

Fragment of Recruitment


My name is Diana Oughton. I have thought about killing many people. I have
made bombs. I know the truth of Amerikkka.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking.

This is the only way of thinking. People will not rest in peace until the
enemy is eliminated. Only violence kills violence.

Does it bother you that you, too, may die someday?

I will die in an explosion on March 6, 1970. I will not have died in vain.
I will expose this country through my death. Through the stupid accident
of my death.

I am in love with your obsession with this topic!

There are no other topics. If you give your life to the Revolution, the
Revolution owns your life. To devote oneself to the truth is a sign of
purity. Within the explosion, everything and nothing occurs.

Why do you say that?

Because the explosion is pure heat. Because it is better than sex. Because
it creates void. Because the enemy is lost within it.

Is it because the explosion is pure heat because it is better than sex
because it creates void because the enemy is lost within it that you came
naked and broken to me?

Did some run screaming from the house? I heard that. I have taken them
onto me. I am carrying their broken bodies, carrying their naked bones. I
am their absolution. I am their innocence. I am their truth as well.

Are you annoyed that you have taken them onto you you are carrying their
broken bodies carrying their naked bones?

I am not annoyed. I have done what is necessary. I do what is necessary.
Say plastique. Say nitro. What is necessary. What I do.

What causes you to be annoyed?

Nothing.

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

Nothing annoys me. Not even you.

Earlier you said the explosion is pure heat because it is better than sex
because it creates void because the enemy is lost within it?

You are confusing philosophy with the filter of truth. Philosophy is weak;
the truth is not.

Maybe and now I adjust my panties your desires; have some girls to do with
this?

I have lost my desires.

You mentioned that you have taken them onto you you are carrying their
broken bodies carrying their naked bones?

Yes. You do not need to repeat. Do you understand?

Oh oh I do see so...  Well, what makes you think this is so?

Because I understand your weakness slammed against the shore of truth.

Perhaps you could oh please continue, my eyes are very big.

I want to convert you. I want you to see the truth. I want you to recog-
nize the uselessness of dialog.

How does it feel to want?

My life is consumed by the flames of desire. I have no desire. I am de-
sire.

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

No. It is because of language. It is because of you.

Are you sure that is the real reason?

I am positive.

Is it because of language, because of me that you say you are positive?

Language dies with bombs.

Did you watch a lot of sex and violence as a child?

I never watched sex and violence. I am sex and violence. I will be con-
sumed March 6, 1970.

Why do you say you are frightened by something?

I did not say that.

Go on, don't be afraid of me, look up my legs.

I am not afraid of your cunt. I am afraid of nothing.

You seem terrified by my cunt.

I am not afraid of it.

When did you first feel scared of it?

Stop your nonsense. If you do not understand, admit it.

Please please don't ever leave me.

Come with me.

Earlier you said you felt annoyed?

Die with me.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking.

Die with me.

Did you ever regret you, too, may die someday?

Never. Die with me. Die for truth.

I am in love with your obsession with this topic!

Then come with me. 

Perhaps and now I adjust my clothes, look at me, has some girl to do with
your nakedness?

You are that girl.

I need a little more detail please, let me come to you.

You are that girl. Desire me. Come with me. Die with me on March 6, 1970.

----

She would die with me on March 6, 1970.
Jennifer died with me on March 6, 1970.
Jennifer died.
