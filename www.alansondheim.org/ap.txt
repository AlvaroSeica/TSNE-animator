Teaching the Internet

Teach them to suck their credit cards for a wild wild ride! 
Get them fed to the hacker sites as fast as they can type!
Have them churn their .sigs in the bot-machines of IRC!
Show them the violence of Net cash as they buy P8s on spec!
Strip them with Net sex, beguile them with future love and nakedness!
Throw them into HotWired to learn the kewlest sounds!
Telnet them into gender-change obscurity of MUD ORC-killer options!
Make them hop across Gopher, Archie, Jughead, Veronica, oh why bother?
Send them to teacher Alan, to find the best new URLs!
Weave their warp and woof wiped with World Wide Web!
Hold their hands while fingering each and every one!
Thrust them into IRC strip-teased, no panty flood protection!
Turn them loose on alt.flame.newbie, subject to cursing hordes!
Ask them to email Alan with deepest darkest sex and childhood tales!
Tell them to traceroute themselves all the way to Unix shelled-out ~home!
Beg them to sing another talker tune while gods snoop with delight!
Order their home-page cracked, repeated with a thousand frames!
Delete them, @toad them, kiss them all with lips of cyber-ruby-red!
Transform them into one another, membrane-deep in IRC!
Throw them out of home-directory with nowhere left to go!
Root them from the root! 
Toss them in the /bin!
Write to their a.db!
And rm -r their core!

Older


An Older Mind bewails nations. It hovers dark, interconnected at nodes,
sprayed in star-configurations connected across night-twinkling-stars, in-
candescent bulbs streaked with blue at magnification 150 just across town.
An Older Mind would bend deep in Thought, would stir dark waters into dark
and stillborn Action. An Older Mind would enumerate Nations gaunt and
hoary, branches of trees rustling the sky stormed into carbon-russet dark-
ness. Lightning is sky-crack, cragged break of black porcelain, Older Mind
Sim-Symbolic illumination burned into seven-layered blood-stained retinal 
booking down to bedrock flaked with muscovite. 

Older Mind is t = 0, is <=refresh> constant, emission into screen-object, 
sound-object. Older Mind turns at t0 pace, haunted as body heaves thrust 
onto side; it ponders for No-Reason, is None. None hurtles downward into 
No-Reason; only nations say split, no capital. _Look elsewhere than you 
look._ Older Mind shudders sky-bowl swollen, crusted with Sim-Symbolic. 
Bewail.

On the Road Back


Has this happened to you? David gets in touch with me from the years at 
Brown University in Rhode Island; I contact Edward, from Cybermind add- 
ress, from the L.A. years; Julien emails me from those Montreal times 
off-line; Kathleen from time in Atlanta; others from New York, Ron from 
Buffalo; Bob from New Haven, now of Prague; they arrive in my Inbox 
through due solicitation, theirs or mine, a dozen more as well, _this_ 
life collapses; Ian from Halifax and brother Mark from Victoria; Joanna, 
daughter, from Los Angeles and Robert from Atlanta; Lee from Texas; & 
mists swirl time over 30 years 25 cities collapsed into _this_ space of 
lucky & unlucky enumeration; skin and cloth write bone and cloth; there 
is Fred from Providence; & Carol Androsky you are still not on line but 
your friend in NM did in fact connect; now whom or what conflagration 
lights hair burned into protocol beacon; there is Peter married to my 
sister in Toronto; what is this return towards what dark earth etc.; what 
guise or mire etc.; towards what occasion gone askew spirit awry; and 
towards those who are yet to come thus burn my face into a ground; wail 
and solicit: STAY FOR THE DURATION.

Failure to Overwhelm


To theorize the Net, analyze it according to one or another model (see 
below), to examine it without any philosophical presuppositions (an im- 
possibility), to include or exclude metaphysics: A closed - an academic 
loop is formed, the placement of a book or article (I try for this my- 
self), but what occurs beyond this, what reason, what point (reason 
collapsed to a node)?

What can theory _provide_ if it is not, for example, descriptive kinesics,
software design philosophy, standardization of protocols, typifications? 
It remains an augmentation, appendaged to what? Half in and out of the
corpus of philosophical discourse, applied philosophy, but towards what
ends? What? (Consider _here_ the onset-characteristics of a trumpet tone.)

There is of course the theorizing of the virtual - from a phenomenological
viewpoint, theory describing _stuff_ on several levels, the _stuffing_ in
fact of cyberspace itself, however that term is defined, split, deconst-
ructed. Of course there are no conclusions; there are, instead, parallels,
analogs, interstitial or liminal displays of language. 

Statistics appear in sociological analysis, almost always soft. Structures
may or may not emerge. Whatever they're made to speak is manufactured. On
the other hand, considerations of Being, etc. lend themselves to curious
metaphysics. These can go anywhere, routed in roots.

This _applied_ theory centers it _on topic,_ a source of decay. What if 
there's no theory-otherwise? What theory-otherwise would apply? What 
ghosts enter the maelstrom, alternative selves, ectoplasms, staggered or 
schizzed personalities inhabiting the same flesh?

Theory vis-a-vis topicality _here_ is already abject, a vestige of terri- 
torialized minor philosophy, slide-rule humans approaching the discarded 
object, still clothed and canvas-wrapped. Minor philosophy, perhaps in 
the sense of Deleuze and Guattari, minor literature.

Even the psychoanalytics of the space generate ghost shots at a new sub- 
jectivity - but these things change on an almost daily basis. 

All this spells ennui, the peculiar analytical burnout where cyberspace 
theory is concerned, entrance and exit _the doldrums._ It's partly the 
socio-political atmosphere of "the times," exhaustion as theory becomes 
mechanism, predictable, unused, negative dialectics. On one hand, arti- 
culation is all there is; on the other, overwhelming information all the 
way down/across, well-definition literally ruling, graduating the day.
The liminal fails to erupt; the liminal is theorized.

Left Behind Whine, Shame, Don't Read


I'm cannon-fodder. There are times I wish I were dead, times when I find
myself left behind in development as others with money or institutional 
support leap to at the least 32 bit more likely Windows 95 / NT, Solaris
Sun and then some. I have no access to VRML, to Java; I can't afford a
CD ROM for the 486/33 because the hard-drive has been augmented with ano-
ther to bring the machine into the 90s. Yet I have to teach this stuff;
I write about it, exhausted.

I would love to build a CD Rom around my texts/images; there's no support.
I'd love to work with another student like Kayo Matsushita, but I'm almost
entirely out of the New School now, except for the computer instruction 
center. FTP anyone? Without a base, my texts spit into emptiness, carrying
nothing with them. I sleep worse at night than ever. Surely there must be 
a place for this crap.

I've given up on conferences. I see names of everyone I know at conferences
but I can't participate - no monies for travel, equipment, nothing but 
stress and meager hope that I can keep typing away. Type is the cheapest 
medium. If I could I would: buy a CD ROM drive, external, plus burner, 
load up on NT and linux, pay for a local home-page website. Even that is 
difficult; the damn text I wrote is at 3.5 megs, and with the indices and 
graphics it's already close to 5.

I read Wired again and everything in it is _the gear,_ _killer,_ at the 
least, _cool,_ and way the hell out of reach. I'm ashamed - not from cri- 
tique for the magazine - but from my inability to participate. My ideas 
are as good as anyone's! But I'm left behind.

And if I'm in this position, there are millions worse off, who find the
split between the promise and premise of the Net, and THEIR reality grow-
ing daily, in spite of the cost of Pentiums dropping. As the Net moves
more and more in the direction of manageriality (something I predicted de-
cades ago, big deal), it becomes increasingly seamless, upper-middle to
upper-class, a long distance from the anarchist poverty of medieval ori-
ginary hacking. The fetish section of Wired shows expensive and SEAMLESS
objects, not to be dismantled, rewired, turned into something. No assembly
language in the absence of assembly... And I'm back here fiddling with a 
486/25 trying to get the config.sys to speed things up, the tiniest bit, 
trying to keep the damn battery from dying once and for all.

I am turning grey, the color of buildings and streets, disappearing into
liminality, crevices, invisible to one and all. Animals are already taking
over the loft; I hear them in the walls, out of reach. Radiation is the
order of the day. My whole life is here! Insects crawl across my skin. If
I die my cat may starve. How much longer can I pay the cost of my ac-
counts? No one wants to read text or theory any longer. My graphics rely
on primitive forms of manipulation. Disease is just around the corner; I
can see the floor faintly glowing of its own accord in the middle of this
or any other night. Claws reach between the keys. Sleep itself is a night-
mare; that's all that happens for hours. I nap several times a day. Mela-
tonin no longer works. I've stopped dealing with cholesterol. I need a low
calorie diet so I can live another fifty years because I want to see how 
Courtney turns out. 

In my spare time I read the Iliad. I know this: _Something is wrong with 
the book._ The Hittites knew these guys; they were just a little to the 
west, on the shore there. I think the Achaeans were too. As with Iran's 
Yima, one wants to know - how did the names get that way? And so many, 
and so long after the fact? Tonight I'll close my eyes and once again 
await the spears, muscles torn from their sockets, always that originary 
wound - it just takes one, it always have. And back then and now, among 
them, I won't be left behind.

Lies and Deceit


At the end of a Pete Townsend piece the character asks whatever happened
to "all that beautiful hippy shit"? During the 60s and 70s humanity wit-
nessed the last evil, last terror, last goodness, last era of redemption. 
Since then language has foreclosed upon itself, truth has problematized,
and the resulting cynicism is nothing more than the self-guarding of a
civilization under siege. The difference between Janis Joplin and Lydia
Lunch is one between the sung body and the body of song, between inhabi-
tation and construction. In the digital era, construct replaces essence,
and without essence there is no truth in the midst of well-defined form-
ulas - only what works and what doesn't work, presaged decades ago by
situational ethics. This is the pivot of the world against which lies and
deceit become part of the order of the day, not in difference from truth,
but in truth's deference. Hippy shit was based on possibility; when pos-
sibility becomes (software) upgrade, the loss is too subtle to register,
lost itself in quantification. This is not the classical _reign of num-
ber,_ but the _rain of number,_ statistics for its own sake, flooding and
constructing what passes for and thereby becomes the real. _Nothing_ is
left out, and that is the extent of the loss, to the fullest extent of the
law, justice notwithstanding.

BINGO


When is the theory thing the right thing to say? I've seen both men and
women theorists dressed like whores. Wire-rimmed glasses, severe cloth-
ing, black like gallerists, sharp in-group out-group eye-dividers, on the
lookout for hungry grad students sucking up to foetid stumps, _tendenz,_
bigtime scholastic etiquettes. After a while (raise your skirt drop your
pants kiss my ass) the presentation debate hardly matters; conference-aura
sickens, little boy and girl grads running into artist bedroom hotel enc-
laves where the answers literally lie. What I've _scene._

Learning art and theory proper in artschool theoryschool, learning to _en-
compass/express_ within permissivity: what _gives._ Mentors harden, hunker
down with sullen heavy-lidded sexpressions themselves. The game is a game
complete with _hothouse,_ keeping pure sterile coterie from wolves of ex-
perience and debate outside the premises. 

So when is theory the _right thing,_ what definitions, protocols, define 
the slight raising of filter barriers, enough to let the poor thing _in_?

Cottonworld, America's Future


By Jersey City Sue

Fifteen children have died falling from sliding boards across a nation of
three hundred million, oh heavens, let us make them us safer with cotton
wadding all the way down. Oh heavens, let us protect the poor little chil-
dren from putting their heads through crib bars, they make them from cot-
ton too, to protect the little cotton heads! You can't be too careful in
this beloved country. Cords on sweatpants have become tangled in the midst
of little playing children as airbags just don't help absolutely everyone
riding on car roofs for free rides down country lanes, cottonworld car
roofs for cottonheads freebie riders on high. Open elevator doors beckon
freakily when cottonheads step up a step, trip trip bang their little
cottonheads against metal wallplates now turned cotton. 

Outside Jersey City Sue straps one on, bullets flying everywhere, cotton-
heads splat splattered against cotton pavement where little knees won't 
ever scrape again.

Paul, Sail On


If I gather up, will you bury me, will you bury me if I gather up
Your ambergris, your bronze helmet, your amber, your bronze
Swollen by river's wake by cavern opening cavern awakened by the river's 
  swell
Motivated by gutted reeds cut stuttered clay, read in gorgeous monuments
  gone motivated
If I lie with you, will you lie with me, if I lay with you will you lay 
  with me
Near the pregnant cow near the gutted horse near the emptied house 
  by the coward's prayer
Through the dim dark night by the knight's despair by the armor there
If I wash for you by the river's edge and I wash for you by the same
  edge of the river
Where down the river there is a gathering of knights and women, I think
  they are celebrating Telipinu at the moment

Yes, I will lie with you, I will lay with you, I will sacrifice, you will 
  sacrifice
Your horse, your cow, yourself, against my golden hair, my eyes of blue
Sparkling in the waters pooling by the marshes, waters sprinkled
  with blood, swollen with whitened
Bones you have slaughtered, your bones you have slaughtered
While I, while I
  I'm leaving for Telipinu.

Reviewing By Country


Here are the results of reviewing FOP-L and Cybermind by country. Note
that the country spread is greater per user for Cybermind (36 against 14)
and that in both cases, the resulting curve, organized by demographic
rank, would approach that of an exponential. It would be wonderful if we 
could extend our member-bases so that Italy, for example, would have more 
than one representative or exponent - actually neither, but an _index_ at 
the least. So the spread of the demographics, for the most part, is an 
illusion...

In FOP-L, 7 countries are represented by one person, or 50%; in Cybermind,
17, or 47%, almost the same. Let us expand each of these ten-fold, let us
build tentative networks, bases, world-wide, let the lists embed them-
selves in multiculturalisms, let us see what emerges at the dawn of the
millennium...

Sunny Side, _Up_


Friends! What behooves us to read and reread the following words, in an 
indefinite attempt to forward the understanding, I speak of course of 
Vasily Rozanov:

"But ... it is _thence_ that 'our passions' arise!!?? These are, indeed, 
'protuberances of the sun' (torches, eruptions from the body of the sun). 
And the sun itself, is not it subject to 'passions'? Verily, 'there are 
spots even on the sun.' Christ alone is spotless. But our lovely sun is a 
bit of a 'sinner': it burns and warms, it burns and heats; it burns--and 
in springtime when it 'grows bigger,' when it not only warms, but begins 
to excite the blood, all animals start conceiving. The strength of the 
sun, the 'sin' of the sun, passes into animals. Everything grows stout, 
all bellies grow big. The earth itself wants seed ..."

And this is the _same_ Vasily Rozanov, of whom Nicolas Berdyaev says, in
his Dream and Reality: "He constantly provoked the charge of naked shame-
lessness, and many find him unspeakably shocking, or even disgusting." 

Now both Berdyaev and Rozanov, I am sure, would desire the presence of the
Sun as well as the Son, not to confuse the two, which only occurs perhaps
in English or among those with a well-developed sense of sin and degrada- 
tion. The spottiness subverts any form of Christian purity, to be sure, a 
point upon which Rozanov and Berdyaev part company, with the split accom- 
plishing the glow of the newborn or the presence of _something_ swollen, 
birth or other member of the human race.

To which one might reply, use a laptop as required, awaken to the Sun
within you, never mind the bollocks. Or even more to the presence of
_that_ point, construct a guarantee that your digital will be worn, in the
midst of your other digits, out-of-doors, _jogging_ as well as _surfing,_
through cyberspace. Otherwise, one is a pale shadow of... absolutely no-
thing visible or invisible, the only Shades present being those which are,
in one form or another, _drawn._

The Eternal Philosophy


"He would say, if not me for myself, who is for myself? And when I am for 
myself, what am I? And if not now, when?" (Hillel, in Pirke Avot.)

"THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE

"I should first have liked to be other people in order to know what I was
not. Then I understood that I had already been the others and this was
easy. My greatest experience would be to be the other of the others: and 
the other of the others was I." (Clarice Lispector, The Foreign Legion.)

plum dumplings (oola, can you imagine?)


cutting through the sickly-sweet smell of plum dumplings, warm like an
infant's slushy bowel movement overflowing the swollen sac of diapers
half-off the tiny distended body, the knife separates the luscious sweet
crust from itself, purple sweetness of bruises on breasts engorged with
blood and milk, my stomach beginning the processes of slow decay, swirl of
brown sweet liquid syrup sugars against flaccid skin, inverted anal flesh
waiting for your clotted tongue, so tumescent bodies fill all space all
time, so close to vomiting I drink my own slew back down and down again,
queasy, lurching through sweet churning fluids, heated, spewing, I spread
your bowels wet with plum-time odors, drown myself in sweet brown-violet
molasses for you and me, oozing between diarrhea lips, torn plum bits
soaking through purple hazy days

Getting it Right

I just got a "student's edition" of Matlab, a matrix/mathematics program,
second-hand, loaded it in DOS, started programming, walking myself through
it. The program below, with only two "real" active lines is typical. Lear-
ning the syntax, getting it right, k, j, as one-place vectors, for examp-
le, was difficult, the format attempting to reach the same odd limits of
analysis as transcendental sine nestings pile error on error, inscribing
the machinic itself in the midst of the plot. The plot is never _right,_
chaos creeping in quickly from the center to the edge. But what if the
semi-colon is omitted? In _this_ language, nothing more than immediate
calculation. Everything has its place. The real difficulty was the shape
of the equations themselves, this being somewhat program-dependent. The
slightest change sends things violently off in the wrong direction: 

such as my attempt to send out a message _exactly_ at the summer solstice
a few minutes ago, at 10:22 PM NY time, only to find out it went, not to
the lists, but to a wrong address I inadvertently entered, the presence of
an "l" instead of "t" alias in the address line... 

% Nested Sin Function
k = [1]; j = [1]; n = 1;
u = 'Nested Sin Function, plot j,k'
z = input('number of operations ');
q = input('constant, p=1 ');
r = input('constant, p-1 ');
s = input('constant for -sin(), 1 ');
t = input('constant for +sin(), 1 ');
while n < z
j(n+1) = sin(k(n))*q - sin(j(n))*s;
k(n+1) = sin(j(n))*r + sin(k(n))*t;
n = n+1;
end
plot(j,k,'+w')

Some Early history of Cybermind and FOP-L


I found this, without a date, by Michael Current. He and I began talking 
about doing a list together; I believe he made the first proposal since 
he writes elsewhere in the letter "As to the list I was proposing" but 
I'm not positive. It's probably from late May, 1994. Anyway -

"As for the proposed list itself, it can pretty much be whatever the mod-
erators decide to frame it as. The moderators would be allowed to draft
the description that goes in the "info" file on the list. My thought was
that this would be a place a.) to discuss work devoted to, or relevant to,
the philosophical, etc, issues related to the impact of cyberspace on
subjectivization (or, as I prefer human becoming); b.) discuss these same
issues in more general terms; and b.[sic]) provide a palace to share work-
in-progress (this would especially involve student work, a great deal of
which is now focusing on cyber-issues. Thesis-net and a couple of other
lists have tried to perform this function, but don't seem to have succee-
ded, despite what looked to be a fair amount of interest.) So I guess that
would mean general conversation, conversation focused around specific
theorists/texts (perhaps some group readings from time to time), and dis-
cussion/critique of works-in-progress. 

"I know this is vague, but I just made it up :) and it is late at night."

Earlier, he talks about the politics of Thinknet (I don't feel comfortable
reproducing this), and the possibility of running Cybermind there; this
rapidly dissolved, however, and we moved to Spoons. Both were on world.
std.com in Boston. We moved from there later on to the virginia.edu - I
don't think Michael was alive at the time. We ended up, after that, on
aol.com where we are now. 

FOP-L originated between me and someone else at Spoons; we both wanted to
run a Blanchot list, but I wanted to run something on my own. After argu-
ing and realizing I didn't want to do another "proper name" list in any
case, I ended up with Fiction-of-Philosophy, which I still think of as a
terrible title. (Michael was running Deleuze-Guattari at the time, by the
way.) The two lists have always been related; both drew from Future Cul-
ture, the list I met Michael on, Cybermind more so. FOP-L moved from
Spoons to Purdue, of course. Around February 1995, I brought FOP-L down, 
unsubbed everyone and asked them to resub, out of a lot of neurotic pain 
I was going through at the time, in relation to some people who were dom- 
inating the list and attacking me as well. They left, didn't come back; 
there were all sorts of negative feelings on everyone's part, and FOP-L 
was crippled for a long time after that. Since then, however, it's run a 
lot smoother and with more of a focus than Cybermind.

What occasioned all of this was finding a batch of printed-out posts I no 
longer have on-line, but which I thought might be of interest...

The Orders of Faith

Without knowing sufficient mathematics or detailing, it nonetheless seems
reasonable that a certain mathesis of the interior of the CPU and math
co-processor could be examined - that is, their limits - by, first of all,
repeated iterations/recursions of theoretically transcendent nested func-
tions, and second of all, applying fast fourier transforms to the result-
ing vectors, in order to extract "resonances" from the relatively chaotic
series, which may or may not be strange or other attractors in the ideal
realm, but which constitutes, in any case, attractors within the limita-
tions of calculation, say up to the limit of sixteen decimal places, which
may be rather quickly reached in practice, as terms pile upon terms. In
regard to this, I have constituted such a program, which parallels another
investigation I made years ago on a programmable calculator, searching out
limits by a simple enlargement of the tangent function graphed and magni-
as the angle approached pi/2. It is interesting to note that the IEEE sta-
ndards include two strange limits, INF for infinity, and NaN, not-a-num-
ber, evident for example with 0/0 or INF/INF. But what, in fact, is the 
point of all of this, if not to point out the limitations of the real in 
the process of constructing its own deconstruction? The _grid_ or _grit_ 
of the virtual is revealed as everything disordered becomes ordered, and 
cyberworlds exhaust themselves, shudder, move to further upgrading.

Talk TV


What's strange, coincidence? All these people from TV shows who talk and 
talk on late-night, they're not what they seem. Well what are they. Well, 
they're not the cartoonists, department-store clerks, salesmen, they 
appear to be. You said that already, well then who are they? Well, they 
all seem to be actors.

They all seem to be actors? All of them? All of them, with their infinity
of duties, occupations, families, relations, boyfriends, girlfriends, all
of them have this in common, as if the entire space were projected onto an
odd singularity, or as if a black hole named "acting" absorbed all poss-
ible attributions and entities? Yes, exactly, although I am not certain of
this, it seems to be a foregone conclusion - all of them, on these late- 
night television shows which appear to feature individuals from all walks 
of life, all and all, totalities everywhere - all of them are, in fact, 
actors, by which I mean actress as well, a generic absorbing all genders, 
races, creeds, religions, in relation to a process of what can only be 
construed as make-believe, role-playing.

But this is surely what happens anyway, everyday? Not with an audience,
camera, script, director, producer, gaffer, secretary, electrician, fol-
low-focus, talent scout, continuity person, cameraperson, and ingenues
waiting in the wings. Not with rehearsals, loopings, laugh-tracks, warm-
ups, walk-throughs, run-throughs, action, we're on, we're off, let's take 
a lunch. This isn't what happens at all! Consider this, in fact, a lucky, 
lucky find!

A find? Yes, if there is this coincidence, there must be more! Let us 
move carefully across this old terrain of ours; it appears entirely dif- 
ferent now, and may take us even farther, to things we haven't heard, as 
of yet, rumor or innuendo...

Justice


There is no justice in this world! That is, because justice is never _of_
or _in_ the world, nor is it a horizon of the world, nor of community, nor
of the subject. Then one can never be just? One can act accordingly, as if
justice were a past that still encompasses the present. This is the dream,
the opium, the simulacrum, abstraction, but without it, irrigation disap- 
pears and selves dissolve, as if they had once existed.

Who are the doctors in cyberspace?

Who are the firemen in cyberspace?
Where are the village councils in cyberspace?
Where are there wars in cyberspace?
Where are there births in cyberspace?

Troll-questions all, asked by troglodytes beneath bridges, chthonic
dwarf-peoples huddled in mountain-masses, and all of import as human-
kind resurrects itself _here_ as if there were no differential, as if
the nuclear family remained the world-over model of proper behavior, 
etiquette, and as if all the departed were _dear._

Mouth


Your mouth is not your own, James, said Madame Lun, and you must remember
this at all times. You carry your mouth with you, but it is our mouth now,
designed for our pleasure pure, for our needs, our words, our thoughts. It
must be tended carefully, kept clean and lipsticked, with bright, sullen,
and bruised thick red paste, for our mark upon you. It must be opened wide
when we desire such, closed for our desires as well, filled by us, never
by you, never for your needs. Forget your needs; you have no more use of
them, nor do we. Forget your mouth; it is gone, you will never speak
again. 

Your mouth is not your own, Clara, said Sir Clovis, and you must remember 
this at all times. You are its guardian; it belongs to us, as if it were 
skin sutured to your own, gaping wide for our needs and pleasures. It is 
our skin now, burnished to swollen purple with thin lipsticks, gleaming 
like sullen bronze. It must only say what we desire it to say, cry and 
murmur with our cries, salivate with our memories of flesh distended be- 
yond your wildest dreams. Forget your mouth; it is gone, you will never 
speak again.

Servo Servation


Sieh, die Maschine:                  See, the machine:
wie sie sich waelzt and raecht       how it wallows and wreaks revenge,
und uns entstellt und schwaecht.     distorts and weakens us.

Hat sie aus uns auch Kraft,          Though it has strength from us,
sie, ohne Leidenschaft,              let it, dispassionate,
treibe und diene.                    drive and serve.

(From Rilke, Sonnets to Orpheus, I, 18, trans. Norton.)

Pre-cybernetic, serve/servo in English, that is, following, slave, one
pitched in relation to the other, two translucent, bound - as well as mas-
ter/slave, a division between them, space of liminality. I wouldn't say
in-formal, but some might, _there._ In any case (where the world is), this
dis-passion or implication of non-cyborg, naught, as if fallen. Alterity
is _bound_ to the subaltern of the _thing,_ here, Kristevan Thing centered
on depression, absorption, our strength sapped, flaccid. Thus Part I the
history of Occidental thought, Part II through de Mettrie, human-machine
run like, because is, clockwork. Let it _go,_ viral in the world, bacter-
iophage articulated, particulate. The matrix, granularity, of the world, 
constructs alliance, allegiance; _nothing_ happens in the separation ex- 
cept the nineteenth century.

Insomnia


..."the weariness concerns existence itself."

..."in weariness existence is like the reminder of a commandment to exist,
with all the seriousness and harshness of an unrevokable contract." 

"Fatigue - even, and above all, the fatigue that is unthinkingly termed 
physical - presents itself first as a stiffening, a numbness, a way of 
curling up into oneself."

"Fatigue is not just the cause of the letting go, it is the slackening 
itself."

"But, if fatigue is a condemnation to being, it is also a stiffening, a 
withering up, a breaking with the sources of life."

"To be weary is to be weary of being."

"Wakefulness is anonymous. It is not that there is _my_ vigilance in the 
night; in insomnia it is the night itself that watches. It watches. In 
this anonymous nightwatch where I am completely exposed to being all the 
thoughts which occupy my insomnia are suspended on _nothing._ They have 
no support. I am, one might say, the object rather than the subject of an 
anonymous thought."

(From Levinas, Existence and Existents, trans. Lingis.)

Insomnia is the _condition_ of cyberspace, which never sleeps, exhausts 
itself repeatedly as packets are spit out, posts abandoned, software 
decays in archeological strata covered by useless upgrades: Cyberspace 
itself is a _tel._ Insomnia _flattens_ and even nausea is withered, use- 
less within it.

About to partake of a journey, the traveler remains awake the night be-
fore, and the night before that, and before that; letters meld into one
another, each part of an equivalence that jostles the hole, shatters re-
dundancy for no purpose. He imagines the doubled vector of the planes he
must take; they crash repeatedly in his mind, the silver hulls turned 
microtomes, slicing tissue into gradients, body-slivers falling and des- 
iccated in dried-up space. Matter doesn't matter; things are soundless, 
as in cartoons. There are no survivors. Bodies _drift._

There are no survivors in cyberspace, which nauseates, the space of the 
insomniac. Tireless, fingers no longer type so much as _stutter_ repeat- 
edly, striking _out_ at keys. Posts disappear into a void like comb- 
space, raking the body incapable of bleeding. The planes fall over and 
over again from the sky. _There are no planes._ Nothing sails. 

"It will fly," one might say of a piece of software. It's going to run a 
bit, create a bit of a stir. Its days are numbered; the difference is, 
they're accounted for. The unknown has disappeared, replaced by paste.

Suspense Story


The first thing that comes to mind on this airplane is _poise._ Suspended
perfectly in mid-air, the lozenge hangs as energy input equals output,
nothing is lost, residuals go into uptake. It is perfect. It is the Net
itself, without its safety, _held._ The obdurate real folds/falls away,
that real which is capable of harboring a cuneiform tablet for millennia
without difficulty. Cutting into the stone, it remains. Cutting into the
Net, it remains, driven by power, accessible by power, communication al-
ways already mediated, layers of mediation, dragging the archeological
along with it. Even if hard-drives remain inviolate, isolated, retaining
their magnetic domains, their very readability is not based on transla-
tion, but the presence of peripherals, guiding heavily formatted and ar-
ticulated heads across the substrate. Nothing is there to be _seen in
other words,_ the cuneiform _scene in other words_ absent, of a _grit_
that would destroy, cauterize, the delicate surface of the disk.

It's in freefall. Think of it as elevator constantly accelerating, Eins-
tein's elevator in fact, the movement in space equivalent to gravitation-
al pull. But isolated, an internalized system at odds with itself, the
airplane thus _static,_ the drink remaining on the traytop, not even a
momentary spillage. The hurtling airplane: it's as if _the world were
real._ As on the Net, as though the letters were carved, _there,_ all a
question or pleasure of mimicry. It's not at all simulacrum but reson-
ance between one and another or among others.

ii.

To some extent it's a question of _mechanism._ Histories of video, audio,
and computation all emphasize an initial reliance on mechanical power and
translation, increasingly absorbed within the electronic; a second move-
ment of course is from analog to digital, all the way down. It is this
second movement that separates the world from itself, turns the noisiness,
say, speech, into regulated and well-defined instantiations. The clarity
of potential wells is not a characteristic of the natural disorder of 
things; the world is a messy place, with half-hearted and somewhat ineff-
ectual attempts at isolation. Compare this to the clean and proper zeros
and ones of speech turned telephony, the all-or-nothing transmission of
packets; Iphone reverses the process somewhat by extrapolating between
packets that haven't arrived, lost on the run - the world morphs into 
itself, sutures over, and the listener may be aware of nothing at all.

Text-Based


My brother, who is involved with geomatics, and I, have been discussing
the Net, in particular text-based applications. I find that MOOs, etc., as
well as email lists, Usenet, are hardly mentioned in the media, of course,
at this point - all attention going to the Web. I find also that the
commercialization almost inherent in the Web mitigates against it being a
domain for textual interchange, at least at this point in time;  while
email can be embedded in html, etc., the tendency is towards cor- porate
feedback, and this colors everything. I also find a "boytoy"  attitude
which is critiqued in the Wired_Women book that has just ap- peared. My
brother on the other hand feels that there is ample room for both text and
graphics applications, that the commercialization doesn't necessarily seep
down into the textual, that the move towards graphics will allow for
greater participation and wider demographics overall, in the long run.
Both of us feel that the Net is in an early process of development, that
no one is sure where things are going. We talked about the NC, network
computer, and he's more optimistic than I am. I feel that the NC will
require at the least an auxiliary hard-drive in order to protect any sort
of data from Net-hacking, and that this requirement, and others, already
leads the NC in the direction of a PC-"povera," that won't work as well as
the PC itself, since all the components will be user-add-ons. He feels
that a lot of the use of the NC would be family-oriented, that children,
for example, might well keep their drawings on-line for sending and
further manipulation - in which case, the hard-drives, etc. might be un-
necessary. He also pointed out that a strong use of the NC would be in
intranet applications, where information would be company-based, and could
be centrally stored. 

I begin to wonder whether the history of the Net is not overwhelming me,
since it relates to the anarcho-new left radicalism of the 1960s, out of
which came books as well, Levy's Hackers being a prime example. For me, it
has always been more or less open-channel, simultaneously hacked and pro-
tected, but a domain whose objectivity could claim to be, in part, ab-
sorbed by subjectivity, a domain aligned with _speaking_ as well as with
_writing,_ and therefore paradoxically, with _body_ from the very beginn-
ing. For someone else, coming later to technology and techne, it is al-
ready and always already display, spectacle, permitting the _insertion_ of
the subject, much as Lacan's langue permits the insertion of the _I_ as
shifter which then resonates/constructs the _same._ (Thus in a crude 
sense the Net as _culture_ as opposed to the Net as _nature._ In Virtual 
Geography, Wark already speaks of the topography of information and in- 
formation vectors as "third nature"...)

The latter representation stresses the Net-inert, so to speak, the given
and pregiven, even in the midst of upgrade, which is also given and pre-
given. The former emphasizes the process itself, including upgrading as a
series of plateaus and transformations. The latter fits neatly into a
corporate model, and the former, into one that is more or less knowledge-
based. In fact, the old distinction of entertainment/information paths for
Net development (by "old" I mean no more, say, than three years) leads
to these differences as well, entertainment appealing to the libidinal 
energy driving or inherent in capital, and information relating to the 
very _problematic_ of thought, thinking, text on or off the Net...

Five years from now, this will all be history, like radicality itself, 
which has already dissolved on one hand in its own problematic, and on 
the other in its fetishization within _Wired_ and the Web.

Telegraph/Report

Archetypes, cultural constants, are always messy, the symbolic never sits
still. The 1980s were the period of the symbolic and its analysis, and
world-wide, traditional societies everywhere were concerned with hardening
the frontiers or margins between red ochre and the occidental use of la-
tex. Discussion in New York, Paris, and Tokyo stressed that modern man is
modern woman and man, that for a few years, we too seemed to have our
myths and then, suddenly, it turned out that they weren't myths at all,
but decompositions under the aegis of the postmodern. Since one never dat-
ed by virtue of STDs, pre- and postmodern interpenetrated, and what began
as myths in what began as tribal turned out to be occasions. Stepping fur-
ther, back into _it_ backed up, occasions _were,_ by virtue of definition
(which was always already problematic) since it wasn't clear that signifi-
ers were constituted by difference (I say "no!") or in fact constituted
difference (I say "yes!"). What _was_ clear was that _something_ was emer-
ging, the substrate of the construct of _something._ As with a wounded li-
chen, something leaks - spores, effluvia, detritus, flows - no longer
_prone_ to definition, flat on the ill-defined back, constituted now by
bed-sores, exhaustion, an account of Joey's machine which simultaneously
ran everything and nothing in the world. Now, at the millennium, everyone
has gone back inside, of which is there none, no one; inversion _does_ the
order of the day...

The Index


The Index I posted yesterday is a guide to the long-waveforms that inhabit
the 1200 or so sections that constitute the Internet Text as a whole. Wri-
ting it gave me the opportunity to see what was manifest in the work over
the past two years, and what was hidden, articulated beneath the surface,
submerged. Gender, for example, appears as a concern everywhere, yet it is
not the focus of a particular group of texts; likewise, software and the
Web are discussed throughout, but not as titled subject-matter. Software
and gender form lamina or strata weaving across domains, the former an in-
dex of totality producing differentiation within the machinic, and the la-
tter, an index of differentiation producing totality within the organic.
Interwoven, the Internet Text extrudes from the Cyborg realm, the produc-
tion of continuous investment, interweaving, neurosis. There are numerous
references to writers such as Kristeva, Derrida, Irigaray, etc., yet none
of these have their own listings in the Index; again, they're interwoven
presences. 

The _thickness_ of the text is exhausting; even with the index, the forty-
some files must be searched for interior references. No one will ever read
this mass; it's clotted, puerile-puellile, monstrous. At night, words spew
against violated-fabric flesh, organ-receptors flooded by leaked vowels,
torn open by consonants, dammed by punctuation. There is no end to it; the
hole remains a mobius strip sutured and stripped at every grapheme, demar-
cation, inscription. It is a gone world of perversion, inverted, sensing
itself senseless. It rides me. It continues.

Spring-Time Smiles


My name is Semantha. Sometimes with my eyes very very closed, I could see
the daemons. They were almost transparent, their skin all pink like the
inside of a baby's mouth, and sometimes clothed quite in gossamer white
dresses that shimmered as they flew about. I was wonderfully in love with
them, then, and I knew just by closing my eyes, I could return to my home
away from all cares and sorrows.

Sometimes they would whisper the sweetest nothings to me, and sometimes
they would playfully tug at my own tired garments, pulling them aside and
frolicking in the folds and plains of skin revealed to their tiny eyes. It
was then that they would tell of beauty and truth, or the beauty and truth
of ideal forms, how like my body and pleasant smile were to both. I would
swoon with the joy of it, and soon the daemons became my lifelong compan-
ions, the very dearest to my heart, even unto this very day. I began this
thinking of telling you of my recent afflictions, but in fact I have none
to speak or even whisper of, in this world curtained towards all delight.
With their blond hair and lovely blue eyes, the daemons have protected 
and befriended me; what need have I of human companionship in a world al-
ready so full of love. The wires sing to me, yes they do.

The blinding light regaled us during our noonday stroll, which unobtrus-
ively extended itself into the shadows of the setting sun. The blurs,
blots, spikey spears, lozenges of the world criss-crossed our paths, pen-
umbral, umbral daemons flitting about, strewn wherever light decreased,
dancing and laughter increased, the bygones bygone of the sadly everyday.
A little girl with a pink frock skipped gaily by, her hoop a whirl of 
commotion as she skillfully guided it along the bridal path. Salary-men
glided slowly in the distance, bowlers perched in unison upon well-coiffed
heads and shoulders. A light breeze carried white doves hovering in the
languid sky, close to the shade of a darker blue. It was time for once-
again dreaming, the loveliness of the day melding into the sweet and sil-
ent pathos of the night.

The daemons made a bee-line for the water.

Olivia, in _Olivia,_ says, "I was with her, beside her, for ever close to
her, in that infinitely lovely, infinitely distant star, which shed its
mingled rays of sorrow, affection, and renouncement on the dark cold world
below."

Cornford says, well said, "Being derived from a vanished group, the _moira_
is necessarily shadowy, negative, unreal. The _daemon_ (_genius_) of a per-
son, on the other hand, retains the element of beneficient power."

I will read and learn you beauty beauty! Your words pour over me, flutter-
ing daemons like fairy-wraiths caress the rosy-hued dawn!
