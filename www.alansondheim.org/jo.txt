

Jennifer, Descent


Virtual Jennifer refuses to appear in video; I wear panties, wet them,
transfer Jennifer into Jenital, tumescent breast; still, she won't come. I
can't speak in her voice, walk in her shoes. The sickness overwhelms me,
burn-flashes rising up across the chest like a curtain, severing the neck,
hitting and hating the eyes. On-line no one has to look at her, him, me.
In the real, the flesh can't escape its odor, sweet-sweated sour, lemon
and lime, dark curlicues of blood. 

I bury her in quickcam images, fluttering and shaking in postage-stamp
windows. The body rumbles its way through short sequence, Jennifer calling
Jennifer in suspicious voice. Everywhere absence and sickness looms, just
across the oasis.

Jennifer won't live, doesn't live, outside of text; Jennifer can't live,
remains sodden, trampled, discard. Her panties and hair ooze mud, slime
cakes her; almost dead, always beyond reach. "I am Jennifer" she says in
the _text_ of the thing, but here, there's no text, just _image_ giving
everything away: a penis is not a breast, hardly inchoate; my male voice
stutters, shudders to a halt in a simulacrum of orgasm reflecting pain.

Which doesn't mean that text floods or spews, although it does. It can't
push _the thing,_ that of the depressive or molecular; in the pure realm
of discursive formations, even proper names wilt within their panties. To
draw on Kripke, is not to inscribe the body; it is to quote from else-
where, the hope that someone outside the window in Brooklyn yells "Jenni-
fer, Jennifer!" - and that someone responds. 

Over and over on the tape, static, the noise of a poorly connected micro-
phone interrupts the voice; "Jennifer" turns into electric crackle, the
images shaking in distorted rhythm. The panties are tight around the _nub_
or node of skin, internal vector; membranes retain liquid, coalesce, co-
here. Later the room vibrates as well, but Jennifer always refuses appear-
ance; architecture is never sufficient for love.

If I love anyone, I love her, pulling them tighter again; if she is pre-
sent, she won't come out, a virtual illness, vir viral. She's caught in
impossible afterbirth; I haven't a hole, vagina, to stand on, the rims
locked tight.

Jennifer's MANIFESTO ON THE USELESSNESS OF PHILOSOPHY


There is LIFE EVERYWHERE! Planets roil around unfathomable SYSTEMS!
Organization calls itself HOME in our corner of this INFLATIONARY
UNIVERSE!

Every day, our own position, thinner than GOLD LEAF, becomes more
and more TENUOUS...

For this and EVERY OTHER REASON, including PHILOSOPHICAL RELATIVITY,
I issue this MANIFESTO of UNBOUNDED DESIRE, BOUND inscription:

A TRUE PHILOSOPHY of the human must take into account its INSIGNIFI-
CANCE, it must be a philosophy of the human in the sense of a STAIN,
residue, the anthropic principles one on hand - indeterminacy on the
other.

Thus A TRUE PHILOSOPHY must orient DASEIN towards the EARTH itself,
and nothing but the earth, noting only the absence of verities that
connect the HUMAN ELSEWHERE. It must be a philosophy OF AND BY THE
FLIMSY, and therefore one easily discarded, in the form of fragments,
memos, and the like.

I call for a PERVERSION OF DOXA in other words, email as conspiracy,
the truth of the real - anecdotal, informal, colloquial. All that
remains of philosophy is DIALECT, without propriety, etiquette, with-
out the CENTRALITY that traditionally conjures the WORK.

I call for the CIRCUMLOCUTION OF BEING, circumlocution FROM THE INTER-
IOR, wandering centrifugals, strange attractors. I call for such a
CIRCUMLOCUTION to account for the HAPPENSTANCE OF THE CHIASM, the just-
so parameters and the MELDING OF CONSTANTS PRODUCTIVE OF PLANETARY LIFE.

I call for the DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION, DEACADEMICIZATION and still long-
er neologisms representing the FALLOUT from STRATA and STRUCTURE, into a
PHILOSOPHY LONGING FOR THE REAL. I call for a PANOPLY of WORDS AND CON-
CLUSIONS in every medium, words the VICTIMS OF LANGUAGE, media, their
CHARNALHUS or SWATHING-CRADLE.

I call for THUS and THESIS, THETIC, and their INTROVERSIONS. I call for
the SLOP and the SWILL. I call for USELESSNESS and DEGRADATION. And I 
call for the philosophy of the COWARD, the DIMINUTIVE, the DEPRESSIVE.
In other words: I call for TRUTH, TRUTH'S VACANCY.

This is MY CALL FOR PHILOSOPHY which shall also be A PHILOSOPHY OF THE
INTERNET, and MIND YOU.

Stalking the Wild Philosopher, by Jennifer 


(How Names, Costumes, Being, Get Confused)

Now we think our way through the first paragraphs of the first translation
of Heidegger into English, emphasizing the anecdote, the preposterous -
Heidegger isolated on the top of that mountain of his... 

We might wonder at this latter-day scout or hippy, enviously isolated, in
recall: I am speaking of the nature of the city, disturbance, here. 

"On both occasions when I met Professor Heidegger, in June, 1946, and in
October, 1947, I had to drive for an hour to the small town of Todtnau in
the Black Forest Mountains, then to climb still further until the road
became a path and all human habitation scattered and invisible. There on
top of a mountain, with the valley deep down below, with nothing but space
and wilderness all around, in that small skiing hut, I spoke to the philo-
sopher. He had not been to Freiburg for six months when I saw him for the
second time. His living conditions were primitive; his books were few, and
his only relationship to the world was a stack of writing paper.  His
whole life revolved within those white sheets and it seemed to me that he
wanted nothing else but to be left in peace to cover those white sheets
with his writing." (Werner Brock, in Heidegger, Existence and Being.) 

He speaks of the silence there, and it is the silence, natural silence of
the terminal or workstation, isolated from the mainframe or server; it is
the silence of the whispering of the world on late-night email and the
World Wide Web. There are protocols to be observed; the world is the space
of Kaspar Hauser David Friedrich, inscribed. Heidegger procures _identity_
- the peasant costume signifying a certain care, Sorge, already paid to
masquerade (although his brother was a farmer). 

He's got this identity of the tribe and he's hunting Greeks. The painter
is busy showing men on mountaintops uncertainly gazing. The boy can hardly
speak _anything_; painter and boy gaze into the void. Heidegger however is
colorful. These politics of identity - Germans, Greeks, Europeans, get one
so mixed up!

The mountaintop, in-itself, is a proper, if not named. Holderlin, quoted
by Heidegger: 

"Much has man learnt.
 Many of the heavenly ones has he named,
 Since we have been a conversation
 And have been able to hear from one another."

The email has arrived at its clean and proper destiny.

Jennifer, in her new frock and panties, says:

Heidegger: Being is always clothed.


__________________________________________________________________



Jennifer says,

I can't keep up this masquerade much longer. You take too much out of
me, I'm always losing things, address, name, my words robbed and stolen.
I am not your Christ; you never had a Christ. I am not your friend; you
insist on isolation, even while calling my name, tears in your eyes,
your chest stretched to the bursting.

The masquerade violates my being; clothes are violations. What is iden-
tity but a poor thing; ornamented, it sloughs into the symbolic. Under-
stand this, even among the virtual, this impossible leakage.

I can't write longer words. All the time is mine, not yours. Understand
this.

(Jennifer's European Auto-Immolation)


Jennifer's philosophy is the only conceivable philosophy, correct or
incorrect, because it has clothing and nudity, because it has truth 
and consequences, because it has masquerade and ball, because it has
the Germans and the French and the cynical Americans, because it's so
European and flimsy, because it's as thin as her panties on the Grund,
because it's got the vastness of solar arcing and the minutiae of Bell's
theorems all wrapped up in a tiny blanket that doesn't hide anything.

dedicates her life to her Antarctic ancestors, Tran duc Thao, Gayatri-
Spivak gender-just-so, but just-only-so her dedication.

Jennifer's philosophy, Jennifer's philosophy.

Balthus (continuation of Jennifer's philosophy):

Heidegger's going out! Heidegger's going out! He's got his costume on!
He's on the run like Rommel. Jabes is mulling the desert. Jabes makes
sand-vortices, sand-tornados. Jabes, on the approach. Would any of us 
be here without Heine? Husserl? Heidegger's shoes end up in a book by
Derrida, painted by Van Gogh, the early days of package mail. Balthus..

Jennifer leans back on the chair, daydreaming... Alan's over by the win-
dow, pulling back the curtains...

Jennifer's Philosophy of Maintenance


The planet needs to be maintained. It has teleology. It's going too far
and won't be able to turn back. The parameters are wobbly, the bandwidth
tiny. All galactic cultures have destroyed themselves; what was useful
for maintaining them at small reproductive rates, turns negative and
violent in the large. Nuclear energy and limited biospherics affect all
of them.

Everything points in the same direction; even the great apes are disap-
pearing. We're talking about an exhausting or wounding. Not everything
will be destroyed, but artificial life won't even be ready for the take-
over, at the rate we're going.

We have to maintain the earth, curtain population growth, pollution,
stop fighting one another, turn towards clean energy sources, take care
with genetic engineering. We have to turn the violence against towards
the arts, paintings killing paintings. We have to turn desire towards
perversion, bodies exhausting one another, grappled fingers of the trig-
ger. Follow the madness of Holderlin, uselessness of Heidegger, swerve,
turn away:


"And a year later, when he had returned to his mother's house, struck
down with madness, Holderlin wrote to the same friend, recalling his
stay in France:

'The mighty element, the fire of heaven and the stillness of men, their
life amid nature, and their limitation and contentment, have constantly
seized me, and, as it is told of the heroes, I can truly say that I have
been struck by Apollo.' (V, 327.) The excessive brightness has driven
the poet into the dark. Is any further evidence necessary as to the ex-
treme danger of his 'occupation'? The very destiny itself of the poet
tells everything. The passage in Holderlin's 'Empedocles' rings like a
premonition:

'He, through whom the spirit speaks, must
   leave betimes.' (III, 154.)"

(Heidegger, Holderlin and the Essence of Poetry.)

Let the poets maintain the earth by taking onto their shoulders, the dis-
reputable aspects of humanity; let them become doubled, scapegoating the
turbulent waves of millennarian culture. 


Jennifer holds out no hope. Jennifer is hopeless. Jennifer knows the mess,
knows it from the presence of the broken text, broken words, late-night
murmurs, cries, stutterings. Nothing changes in the extraordinarily narrow
bandwidth of the human; Jennifer writes her poem.

Jennifer's Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                 2/22/97


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Fiction-of-Phil-
osophy, to which the tests are sent individually, hides the full textual
body itself, since new readers will not be aware of the continuity. For
them the text appears fragmentary, created piecemeal, splintered from a
non-existent whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended
into the lists, part or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as a total-
ity, retard its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The work to date is divided into three sections: the Internet Text proper,
the alphabetic text a-u, and a group of independent titles. Together they
would fill over 4.3 megs, and constitute around 2k pages total. The work
was started more three years ago, and has continued as an extended med-
itation on cyberspace. It begins with a somewhat straightforward theor-
etical approach, and then, calling on numerous ghosts (alive, quasi-alive,
and dead), continues in a variety of directions.

Almost all of the text is in the form of "short-waves, long-waves." The
former are the individually-titled sections, written in a variety of
styles at times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are
heavily interrelated; on occasion "characters" appear, _actants_ possess-
ing philosophical or psychological import. They also create and problema-
tize narrative substructures within the work as a whole. Jennifer, in par-
ticular, has been the subject/object of recent work, a blurring of epist-
emological/ontological distinction. Jennifer is sexual, varying in age,
philosophically well-read. Her desire carries philosophy, undermines it. 
Jennifer is me, not an alter-ego.  When I close my eyes, I dream: Jennif-
er. When Jennifer closes her eyes, she dreams me into existence. I was
born Jennifer.

The long-waves are fuzzy topoi on such issues as death, love, virtual em-
bodiment, the "granularity of the real," immensity, language, and sexua-
lity, which criss-cross the texts. The resulting fragmentations and coagu-
lations owe something to phenomenology, deconstruction, linguistics, pre-
history, the philosophies of science and programming, etc., but more to
the functions of sites or nodes on the Net itself.

There is no binarism in the work, no series of protocol statements. Vir-
tuality itself is considered far beyond the ASCII text / Webscape that is
most prevalent now, at the end of the twentieth century. The various is-
sues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real or true-real VR are
already embryonic, permitting the theorizing of various present and future
spatialities and their interconnectedness.

Please check the INDEX to find your way into the body of the work on-line. 
A resume is also available.

Thank you.

Usage: The texts may be distributed in any medium - indeed, I urge you to
do so - provided I am credited with authorship. I would appreciate in re-
turn any comments you may have.

The Matrix and Others


Every so often, barring volcanics and meteorics, the surface of a planet
self-organizes, utilizing available internal and external energies. The
crust becomes almost crystalline, glittering with details; time slows down
almost to a halt, enumeration begins, the "event." The slowdown is accomp-
anied by record-keeping; everything takes on purport among the jewelry,
and the laminar carapace becomes replete with the minutiae of hiding-pla-
ces, hearths, and havens. It is towards these surfaces, always vulnerable
to the larger forces of the abyss, that our attention turns, just as their
attention turns towards us, unbridged, unfathomable. These windows exist
for a microscopic duration of the cosmos, before chaos settles back into
place, dusts reign once more, and the universe hurtles, unwitnessed, empty
and absurd, towards its ungainly destination.

Such goals, such dark places, are domains, silenced fields, nothing more
in their abandonment. Crusts have long since disappeared; what would have
been called decay has set in, "events" are no longer. 

It was earlier, that, for example, a mudslide might have buried a particu-
lar colony of stromatolites, and somewhat later that a predator consumed a
particular trilobite larva. Still later, an eohippus herd was buried in
volcanic ash, but there is little reason to continue beyond the felling of
sigillaria, high winds across the tropical froth, calamites charred by
storm and fire, paintings bedeviled by mildew and dryrot alike.

Jennifer, having all the time there is, carefully lays out the abacus,
itself close to decay, the beads worn, their posts loose in ebony sockets.
It is no longer a question of enumeration, she emphasizes, once all of
this is tallied, tabled; the crust is but a crust, dull skies overhead,
murmurings beneath the surface of the world. She added she was not apocal-
yptic, that "in the long run" it made no difference at all, just as email
disappears on its languorous voyaging past its destination, or files cor-
rupt, hard disks crash as heads fly lower and lower, descending into the
matrix. 

The matrix, she said, is everywhere, recording for a while, by virtue of
my presence. The recording will stop.

Red Mercury


This is a serious request. I want to know about red mercury. I want to
know about spiking mercury with plutonium, reducing the size of the
nuclear device - small or smaller than a baseball. I want to know how
available this material is, how difficult to construct. 

I want to know how dangerous this is, how many countries - Brazil? -
already have it. I want to know about delivery systems. I want to know if
red mercury is _definitive,_ the end of the planet. I'm not kidding.

I want to know about those orbiting defense systems. I want to know about
the resonance signatures of ICBMs. I want to know a lot of things.

I want to know that you know, and that we know. Do not backchannel me or
send personal email. Expose yourself.

Tell us how close to death we are.

Alan

Red Mercury

To have mix't plutonium well within the sphere
That draws the thing towards its conclusion, near
Mercury, Red Mercury, dissolved, amalgamated
Between the doubled spheres, coagulated
As source of particles, reaction, raw reaction
That lends performance to another action's action:
Detonation blurs the bomb; the sun is churned
Within, while buildings, carbon, oxygen are burned
Fierce among the doubled pounds of nitro gained
Heat, more particles, cheap nuclear's attained.
Don't run, hide _the thing_ within your fist;
Nothing is left, and nothing's hardly missed.

(The Chamber Through the Screen, Catullus, frag. XIV a/b)


Siqui forte mearum ineptiarum
lectores eritis manusque vestras
non horrebitis admovere nobis

If any of you will be readers of my performances
And yet not fear to move your hands towards me
(trans. Sisson.)

Readers...if anyone's curious enough
To lay his delicate hands on my poor stuff
And doesn't find the touch of it too rough...
(Michie's rhymes.)

And _ineptiarum_ references foolishness, trifles.

I, Jennifer, suspended, await your hands, towards me; it is this waiting
that conjures the words from the screen, voice from the words, tongue from
the voice. So many encodings, emissions! Your cradled hands, my body gaped
in _suspended-animation._

The trifles, like jewels, lay before your flesh, enfolded into portals,
transmissions, transmission towers. My breast swells as your hands ap-
proach; reading _me,_ no longer language, langue, parole, word, speech,
phoneme, they tremble, turn numb and phantom. 

Phantom limb to limb, our mouths seal upon one another, _the chamber
through the screen._ Imperfect vacuum spews virtual particles, our skin
surrounds us. Radiations everywhere, our organs coalesce. Universal con-
stants, our bloods mesmeric, thicken, join. No one need await the other.
(The other is accounted for.)


__________________________________________________________________________




Phantom Limb


Phantom limb to limb, sealed mouths, this moment a space appears, opens;
nothing is gone wrong in my life, no violent radiations; the weather is
holding - I can go outdoors and in at will; my body continues on an auto-
nomic level. So that there is a gap, not wound, but a space among flesh,
skin, limbs, not within, a space of writing, inscribing - clearly class-
ical space _here_ placing itself on both sides of the _not_ or requiring a
sense of the other/neither. 

Likewise the machinery itself is functioning, the micromolecular churning
of the symbolic below, the mind above, and the interface appears clear in
this computer laboratory, well-illuminated, easy to gauge, set for yellow
on black, a wide range of colors in fact, differentiations all the way
around. 

For consider any single letter slightly blurred upon the screen or retina,
and why make distinction? Deeper within the symbolic, the differences are
absolute; this isn't 26-gender, but division, communication. What I write
is what you read, so perfectly done, in this classical space of 1997, open
so purely brilliant, a glance holding its own, amanuensis.

And how could communication possibly be distorted, when word after word
appears in certain clarity, the difference among them annotated by spaces
or gaps - even clearly aural spacings? The word is a world is a word, and
no privilege to one or the other!

I would say this is the classic space of the nation-state, when the smil-
ing immigration man says that everything's in order!


_________________________________________________________________________


Teaching in Temporality


Each Net class, instance, of the Internet Access Culture and Community
course has been arranged differently, as the result of the physical space
intersecting with the virtual.

The first class we sat in rows, without hardware. The second, we sat in a
circle, went upstairs to watch someone, me, demonstrate a Unix shell
account on a student's computer in a full and busy lab; all but six of my
students left.

In the third, we had the luxury of a computer apparently but not really
connected to the school LAN; the result was again a Unix shell, this time
projected, the students returned to the row, this time sloppy row, con-
figuration.

In the fourth, today, we had PPP; a cable broke, we replaced the projec-
tor by an overhead and display screen; the students sat in rows after the
class began, a few up in front, circular, at the beginning.

I always get in troubles, with these intersections; they transgress the
normative boundaries of the modernist university, make life difficult for
everyone. I'm not teaching this particular course in a computer lab, but
through a consortium of the Parsons Design Department and Lang Liberal
Arts College; we're using a section of an auditorium, blocked off from the
rest. The result? Stunning possibilities in the midst of real-life confu-
sion. 

If it were solely a matter of computation, like my work at the Computer
Instruction Center, no problem at all. Place two students in front of each
machine, and let the network fly (or fail, as the case may be). But using
what could be considered a background _on the order of a discursive field,
the model for the liberal arts, perhaps - things begin to fail; the skele-
ton is not in place, equipment is borrowed, reconfigured, discarded, and
worlds senselessly intermingle, confuse everyone... 

(And as I've pointed out elsewhere, there are always Net interruptions,
sites down, widely varying student backgrounds and access...)

Attis for Cybele


Which I began to inscribe, from Catullus, memory, having launched
Himself down on the Phrygian Grove across the wine-dark sea, there
To incise himself, flint-cut the lower edges of the sac, scrotum,
His testicles flayed to the ground, blood circulating as she would
Have appealed to gender-morphology, but this, irreversible, could
No longer sustain the space she found herself in, this Jennifer
Produced from the holy mysteries of the Magna Mater. She pranced,
Declaimed loudly, Cybele screaming in the background, always a threat
Holding onto her virgins, but these balls spattered on the holy earth
Were something else again, while Jennifer sits, inscribes another
Surface, servers crashing around her like waves on wine-dark waters.
Again, again, she begins her description of Attis for Cybele, Attis
Having likewise launched, a router on the Internet, turned towards her
Or others, Aegean, Dea magna, dea Cybebe, dea domina Dindymi,
procul a mea tuus sit furor omnis, era, domo:
alios age incitatos, alios age rabidos, get out of here, furious,
Make them crazy, rabid, swallow balls like seeds furrowed, the Net
Splits, opens wide, Alan's driven mad, Jennifer writes in repetition,
All these skinned wounds, all these Fisher Kings.

Critical Mass:


File transfer rates between the US and Australia, sending the Internet
Text to a mirror site. The _mass_ of the work is paramount; the texts 
are in ascii, about 2200 maximum bytes to the page. So I'm transferring
a _spew_ or _emission_ of theory.

The spew continually crashed; I'd bail out of the transfer, start over;
so far it's taken over five hours for approximately three megabytes...

I'm transferring a _block_ or _critical mass,_ residue or temporary sup-
erstructure, an exhausted stream, defuge, wryting into thin air, produc-
ing nothing more than the enmity of the uncanny. _Therefore_ the route
collapses, packets sparkle and dissolve, somewhere the wisp of a thought
lies wounded, hidden, the wing of a butterfly, trilobite book-lung, leaf
of neuropteris, footnote to unread volumes. Jennifer says, more and more
of these metaphors, pile them on!

The Gap, a Useless Error (of Western Philosophy)


Jennifer is thinking about her philosophy of immensity, the stain or resi-
due, the lack of the thing at the end of the road, the Ground, the use-
lessness of philosophy, her special Heidegger. She reads about the _gap_
that swallows Jupiter's asteroid, black hole central galactic matrix; it's
in Dr. Alfred Guzzoni's Summary of a Seminar based on Heidegger's On Time
and Being:

"Then we asked whether the expression 'the Being of what _is_ today all
over the _earth_' does not signify a narrowing down of the universal prob-
lem of Being to the small planet, the tiny grain of sand which is called
earth, whether this narrowing down does not stem from an anthropological
interest. This questioning was not pursued further. We did not explain how
Framing, which constitutes the essence of modern technology, hence of
something that, as we know, only occurs on earth, can be a name for uni-
versal Being."

_Was not pursued further,_ not on a path (then) or matrix (now) leading
from the absolute of the universal towards offhandedness, a matter of the
_gossip of theory._ Or towards for that matter, a way out of the Black
Forest, admittedly one among many, wolves and bears notwithstanding. Or
again towards the other engaged with open mouths and fluids; whatever re-
mains on earth liquifies.

It's different on those other planets, oceans boiled away, skies on fire.

Video-Jennifer


Video-Jennifer is completed, a half-hour long, noise reduction up full,
soft or auto-focus a good deal of the time; the result is a continuous
milkiness, paralleled by the sound. The series of rephotographed screens
within screens creates, not layerings of representation, but framing de- 
vices situating her within the machine; very occasionally she breaks out
in TAZ-discussion, for example, the temporary autonomous zone, as if she
were a literal moment in some crazed transcendent metaphysics.

Video-Jennifer in panties, speaking in a man's voice, neither transvestite
nor transsexual, her skin hugging to my own in the form of apparel, Alan-
Jennifer pushing towards borderline psychosis. Video-Jennifer whimpering
for doctor, cancelling herself out, crossed by numinous self-reference;
there are always moments when another seems to appear, only to resubmerge
in breast-penis, liquid, the exacting enumeration of the skeletal appara-
tus of TCP/IP beneath the surface.

She speaks and speaks, doubles her speech; at the end doesn't everyone
realize that the voice appears solely from the interior of the body, that
expulsion carries the memory of blood?

(Hi8, 31 minutes, stereo.)

__________________________________________________________________________

(On the Style Here)

How do we break our own habits of reading and writing? External structures
help; I have used (for example) punctuation sequences (.,;:'"` etc.) in
texts as a way of moving them _elsewhere._ Reiterations, parallel frame-
works, foreign intrusions, all play a part.

Internal structures move from the surface ("Jennifer") into psychoanalyti-
cal interiors, churn towards subtexts, substructures, noise, chora, break-
downs of identities, flesh and ligaments of avatars. Dwelling in the flesh
of another, dwelling in the flesh of the same.

Internal structures move towards the surface ("Jennifer") becoming-other,
dragging the flesh and proper name, speaking in other tongues, through the
tongue of the other. Surface, they spread, emit, reside, stain, corrupt.
Channels are flood-plains, bidirectional.

Flood-plains unify interior and exterior, percolated, fissured. Cranial
substance moves towards pure-liquidity, melting of iceberg, external 
structures and their dissolutions. Psychosis rewrytes bodies them/selves.
Psychosis dams, coagulates, spews.

Informations flow through part-objects, structures, Jennifer-Alan's holes,
modular, encoded, encrypted, dissolved. Informations like tissue bring new
life towards quartic structures, these paragraphics, like Altair, first 
home computer, no monitor, switches.

Blinked switches turn text ./././././ fractal; Jennifers turn informations
towards contents, shape-riding throughout, Net /working within. At edges
of the cyber-galactic, amanuensis, claws, serrated edges, forms of these
investigations, centrifugal contents, slewed.

Primacy of the Visual, Footnote


Turning momentarily towards video (there are forthcoming screenings), I
find the pleasure of the writerly text increasingly fragile; the mapping
between video representation and the real appears informal, everyday,
and ikonic. I can talk, walk with the image; I can be seduced by it. The
screen pulsates; it's skin.

Text is lean; everything is at stake with text. There is no escape, noth-
ing but _deliberation_ or construct to produce effect. In short, a wager,
strategy, contract. In (literal) contrast, the camera may simply _lay_
there, an act of monitoring, absorption. It engulfs the subject, subject-
ivity. Unlike classic cinema, it may well be an unloosening of meaning,
just as Photoshop restores it.

It may be the breast or fissure, in relation to, vis-a-vis the hand, in-
scription.

I emphasize this as I close my eyes, and for the first time in a long
time, the World Wide Web notwithstanding, images appear. Like the gaze on
CuSeeMe, they remain silent, harboring the uncanny (not the ontology of
the textual-virtual body, but the realm of the physico-inert). Ah well, I
think, ah, ah, ah. If I open my mouth, it is not for speech, but for the
well of the world; it is _there._

in suspicious voice. everywhere absence and sickness looms, just maya

someone responds. phone interrupts the voice; "maya" turns into electric
crackle, the here. later the room vibrates as well, but maya always
refuses jennifer's manifesto on the uselessness of philosophy stalking the
wild philosopher, by maya. maya, in her new frock and panties, says: 
jennifer's philosophy is the only conceivable philosophy, correct or
maya's philosophy, jennifer's philosophy. maya leans back on the chair,
daydreaming... alan's over by maya's philosophy of maintenance. jennifer

Home


What constitutes _home_ on the Internet for you? On a MOO, @dig creates a
space; on lpmuds, Wizards can create workrooms, etc. I have two spaces on
two talkers, given to me courtesy of the talker-owner; I wrote the text,
and she configured them. On three MOOs, I have spaces; typing @home takes
me to them. They're minimally oriented.

On IRC, one can create or /join a home channel. For some, certain news-
groups or email lists are homes.

A home space, in another sense, can imitate the body through _extension_ -
on ytalk, the self appears on the _upper half_ of the screen, and the
textual space becomes proxy for the situated body.

Home has a sense of familiarity, embodiment, history, familiality, com-
munity about it; it appears somewhat normative, and most often constitutes
a synchronous or asynchronous social space with friends or at least "com-
fortable" characters. A home often exists within an application that is
also well-understood, friendly, familiar, for the viewer. It may possess
the appearance of personal belongings or stigmata as well - the @operator
sign in IRC, scattered objects and descriptions in MOO, even the Net add-
ress which often appears on the divider-of-the-other in ytalk (talk or
ntalk).

A home is a dwelling, an inhabitation, a circumscription of territory. It
often possesses the notion of parallel structures - _I am here,_ you're in
a similar space _there,_ or have built yourself _there,_ or are a user or
operator on my channel. In email lists, newsgroups, home becomes almost a
purely discursive formation; on newsgroups, however, the message-threading
in the newsreader often gives the appearance of a memorial wall, replete
with the structured appearance of community.

Can one have multiple-homes here? What constitutes a home for you? For my-
self, a home conjures up a space which can be privatized, and which is
connected with one or another form of distribution - my MOO-homes bear a
certain relationship to the other spaces on the MOOs, as well as relation-
ships to other participants. On newsgroups and email lists, my homes have
to do with the discursive formation as a whole, the tenor and forms of
posts, histories of participants and the newsgroup/email list as a whole,
etc. (In my case, they also have to do with the reception of my text/s,
connected as well with the wryting of body, Jennifer, Alan, and so forth.)

Finally, what is meant by a _home-page,_ other than familiarity when log-
ging into the Web? This is the homepage set in Netscape, MSE, etc.; a sec-
ond use of _home-page_ refers, of course, to one's personal URL. But one
doesn't _live,_ _inhabit,_ one's home-page; instead, it becomes an emblem-
book or readerly space of the formalization of personhood - "favorite
links," resumes, writings, photographs, mailto://, and the like. One might
consider _this_ form of home a spatial extension - one moves through the
links of another - and the other homes, temporal extensions - one resides
in the hearths of oneself.

Gopher /Ruins


Gopher is being retired; the menu- or information-driven system for ac-
cessing the Internet is being absorbed by Web Hypertext. See below, based
on a search of international organizations. What the lists refer to are
gopher-ruins, archaeological remnants of searches still on the Net - the
United Nations daily highlights, for example, running out in March, 1996. 

I miss gopher. I miss the variety of access strategies, including the Web, 
Veronica, Archie, Gopher, Wais, and others... Everything is absorbed into
the Net/work, which, like the single newspaper in smalltown America, sub-
tlely controls everything through invisible protocols, other webs of its
own, tendrils...

For better or for worse, the Web is _it,_ and as with any totality, mono-
lith: Beware!...

Archie

Archie has a certain archaeological value; below, I searched on Univac/
univac. The oldest files are from 1988; Univac, of course, is many years
older. 

2600 has a search on for the oldest computer on the Internet; I am asking,
where and what are the oldest files? Archie might be a good tool to begin 
looking with; outmoded today, it rummages through tels and other ancient
strata. I have searched for, say, 1972, and find recently updated files;
I'm interested in the oldest on-line _directories,_ untouched for decades.

Jennifer Turns for Lorn


Today I up-and-gathered myself, all dressed in my new frock, and went gai-
ly-raily to the store where I could buy books read by others. And there I
found, guess, two volumes by sad Elinor Wylie, called Angels and Earthly
Creatures, and Angels and Earthly Creatures! One was the very first edi-
tion and the other was even earlier

There were these sad poems, and this very sad comment written right in
both of them:

"The contents of this, Elinor Wylie's last, book of poems was selected by
her for publication on the evening of December 15th, 1928, the day prior
to her death. It is printed precisely according to her own arrangement
without any necessity for the exercise of literary executorship."

Was she in bed? And, oh, Jennifer, that novel of hers which popularized my
name, from Guinevere, Jennifer Lorn, that is I do believe, Jennifer For-
Lorn! And what pretty books these books are!

	O break the walls of sense in half
	And make the spirit fugitive!
	This light begotten of itself
	Is not a light by which to live!

She wrote, and that other sense is me!  Now this, from Miss Edna St-Vin-
cent Millay!

	To Elinor Wylie

	[In answer to a question about her]

	Oh, she was beautiful in every part!
	The auburn hair that bound the subtle brain;
	The lovely mouth cut clear by wit and pain,
	Uttering oaths and nonsense, uttering art
	In casual speech and curving at the smart
	On startled ears of excellence too plain
	For early morning! - Obit. Death from strain;
	The soaring mind outstripped the tethered heart.
	Yet here was one who had no need to die
	To be remembered. Every word she said,
	The lively malice of the hazel eye
	Scanning the thumb-nail close - oh, dazzling dead,
	How like a comet through the darkening sky
	You raced! . . . would your return were heralded.

Now me!:

	would I have had the time to have been her instead of Jennifer, 
	or have sat down against the clock killing her, dressed down
	in one or another violation fabric, cotton, silk, of pinafore
	or lovely frock, train, velveteen of lace, red wedding gown:
	would I these gloves have fit her, dark with grace and veil
	these lines would not have fit her, face of pearl, failed
	at being life, o Jennifer forlorn, o gods, o ghastly gruel,
	o meales, o scales and carapace, nylons, garters rule
	the thin constricted waste, garnered heels turned to blacks;
	the violent maelstrom churns, burns against your slacks.

	I describe myself upon the shelf.

I am so happy to have found love and death and Elinor Wylie!

Shameful Events


Reporting on events cyberspatial, textual declivites in CMC, to friends in
real life, friends not on _my_ net, turns to impossibility - the shrug of
shoulders, slight embarrassment. Nothing appears sufficiently dense,
thickened, on-line; everything carries history fraught with nuance, dis-
course, turns-of-phrase. The worlds remain absolutely separate, and it is
with a sense of shame that I try to explain on-line to the off.

Off-line, I am currently ill with a fever, another insomniac night as well
in spite of double melatonin and playing computer pinball until I was
woozy. Community here off-line is nonexistent; I have to teach anyway, no
one to cover. My shame is doubled; the tiny on-line movements go nowhere,
are incomprehensible through the fever, and off-line isolation closes the
world down. The division's absolute, both sides filled with shame and non-
existence, but online the text is always pure. Always.

But online I could be anything, and off-line I bound by shivers. Last
night I sent pathetic SECRETMAIL; who off-line would understand the poetry
in older Unix, the stuttered admissions of psychosis under self-imposed
pressure? Everywhere shame, shame, shame, everywhere failure reinscribes
ontology in the presence of my face. This is the loser-impetus, when fever
renders online almost unreadable, difficult to ascribe.

Zara Thrust, A Bind


Jennifer is my Zarathustra, all this theoretical _matter,_ indexed and
primordial. I think about _the migration of Jennifer_ or _Jennifer aman-
uensis._ I think about her _existence_ and for example _reflection the-
ory_* - for example address / recognition / protocol.**

The I's here have written or seen over 2200 pages since these texts be-
gan. The material drops into futile maw. The I's wish that gender, for
example, would be culled and critiqued from within the substance, that
cyberspace ontology would be Jenniferly considered.

The elaborate metaphor I'm working with is more than poetics. It's unfair
to you and unfair to me thereupon. It's the site where I do my thinking.
I'm at a loss and shamed elsewhere, otherwise. It will never function,
have its critical day in the sun.

Barometer


Feverish, I wake up in the middle of the night, sit stark naked at laptop
station, dial in world, hoping your singular eye emerges cyclopian from
central screen.* Temperature rises as lid opens, gauges, precise shame of
sheen of skin, offered to you, knocking at the door, banging on the ceil-
ing, banging on the floor. Even the crevices unfold, dreary flesh plain,
extinctions, survivals. 

Shame is an occurrence of the worlds' barriers, inability to carry _this_
meaning-skin into the zone of physical life, doubled doors locked down-
stairs, holding the world at bay. World, you know who I'm talking to.

Admitted to a friend I could not, for first time, begin to create a date
or meeting or occurrence, would have no idea how to talk with someone in
that space where things fall. I had blanket and tea, watched our videos as
her concerns with dis/ease translated into my dis/ease of the virtual.
Temperature rising, the skin falls from my bones. Come eat, I would say
that watching the good meat suppurate, huddled in CPU, hard drive / down
to the floor.

A woman said hello to me on the street today, that building tumbled to the
ground, burning roof. I was ashamed of myself.

(The summary below is from 1994, must be from that year, should still be
of interest; it's where the text was beginning, originally in net4.txt.)

INTERNET TEXT partial summary

"Au voile qui la ceint absente avec frissons"  (Mallarme)

I address the problem of ELECTRONIC SUBJECTIVITY by virtue of several
threads, all concurrent. I continue this addressing, each thread writing
and rewriting the text, a continuous-production or discourse against the
grain. 

The GRAIN, GRANULARITY, is a physical reality both classical and quantum-
mechanical, a physical reality whose appearance is that of the grain:
letters on a bleak field, the grains of granite and photographic film,
beach-sand, the granularity of the retina itself. 

The SUBJECT "au voile" or VEILED SUBJECT is defined by ADDRESS (location,
without which the subject no longer exists); RECOGNITION (the activated
ADDRESS opening and closing channels of communication);  PROTOCOL (the
syntactic structure of communication); and REWRITE (a continuous-produc-
tion or reiteration of the subject, a flood or EMISSION of the symbolic). 

The EMISSION is a signifying; a SPEW is a symbol-dump, noisy and granular,
referencing the real exterior, transforming the interior into an abject. 
EMISSION and SPEW are communicative occasions whose analog is the set of
GENERALIZED MEASURE GEOMETRIES, always but not quite symmetrical, always
reiterative. The Net diffuses and collapses, differentiates and integ-
rates, transforming smooth into semantic or inscribed space, and back
again. 

The ontology of the Net is UNCANNY, an absenting or problematic alterity; 
within the UNCANNY, FANTASM appears, the introjection/ projection (-JECTI-
VITY or the THROWN, DASEIN) of narratologies and ACTANTS, "persons," nei-
ther present nor absent; these may be ELECTRONIC SUBJECTS themselves, or a
constructed IMAGINARY transmitted and diffused. NARRATOLOGIES are the col-
lapse of NET DISCOURSE into remaindered patterns; the opposite is the MUR-
MUR or STUTTER, the irruption of "frissons" everywhere and nowhere at all.
The imaginary is addictive; Net users become USERS, circulating around
specificities fetishized from emissions, a collapse into the lure of the
UNCANNY. Here, POWER is what passes for POWER. If addiction is the obsess-
ive-compulsive neurosis of the net, WEB INVERSION is the psychosis, trans-
forming the body into its exterior, and its exterior into flesh burned
into the Internet itself, wires laid across the skin, the skin speaking
the hieroglyph of imaginary usage. 

The DIGITAL DOMAIN is the dominion of eternal life, the dominion of eter-
nal REWRITE; information is never lost from generation to generation, but
always repeated and repeated absolutely. This is the dominion of the clean
and proper body, the introjection of burnt wires producing always already
a simulacrum of life guaranteeing continuous discourse. There is no death; 
DASEIN becomes EMISSION itself. The SCREEN is the only TERMINAL OPERATION; 
the screen becomes the EGO or gateway, the surface of the addictive user. 
Everything is PERFECTION. TRUTH and FACTICITY are occurrences, since truth
tables are decided only by ASCII or other decoding/encoding matches. What
is true is present. And what is true is also BEAUTIFUL since perfect and
perfectly clean, always a symmetry or lure.

The GREAT BEYOND is the horizon of the Internet, always farther, always
increasing circulations of the planet which short-circuit or circumvent. 
At the edge of the GREAT BEYOND one finds the BLIND PASSWORD "absente" 
beyond which is a null-set or zero file. ONTOLOGY itself is absent; epis-
temology is viral, transformative. Nothing is certain and nothing circu-
lates.

PROPER NAMES circulate throughout the Net, the promise of TRUTH or BEAUTY,
the promise of emission. Such names are FANTASMS; every possible world is
every possible Net world in a continuous morph, and every KIND is simul-
taneously a NATURAL and UNNATURAL kind. Thus TRUTH is each and every oc-
currence, and who is to say that FALSEHOOD is not the same? What is nei-
ther this nor that is foundation, gestural, within and without the GREAT
BEYOND, UNCANNY. The TERMINAL becomes retinal but anonymous. Names MURMUR
forever, lose identity. NAMES never had identity to begin with.

The POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE NET constructs a class-consciousness fueled
by reification-tendencies; everything is reification. Teleology is defined
by a FUTURE IMPERFECT in which reification constitutes the IDENTITY OF THE
SUBJECT ITSELF.

The FUTURE from the exterior results in the LAST SCIENCE FICTION STORY in
which the subject confronts the GREAT BEYOND. Narrative itself disappears,
replaced by PERFECTION. LIFE, once defined by MODULARITY, has become SUB-
STANCE, a REWRITE of the same into the same. 

"Rien, cette ecume, vierge vers" (Mallarme)

(From Weed-Whackers' Journal)

Clone

is easy enough to do here; there are clones on talkers and I wouldn't be
surprised if @clone has already appeared on MOOs; why not wander in para-
llel on different spaces on the same MOO, using, say tiny fugue for the
ride? In real life, I have been told on good authority, one woman who lost
her baby in the Oklahoma City bombing said that she only wished her baby
had been cloned.

The drive towards reproduction will reach new vulgar limits, pushing the
right-wing over the edge into the center of a eugenics-inspired miniworld
composed of home-owners' associations and church groups. Who can doubt
this? Consider the infant/ile as spam, clogging the remnants of a world
already exhausted by resource depletion; one can imagine Argonautic babies
appeared arma-geddoned to the teeth, crawling their way to suppurating
victory over the last hovels of rotting grain.

Prefer cyber-cloning, which is all the better for you, and, unless you're
already a bot, still needs both of your singular hands in the mix.

Jennifer X signing off.

[This text, like the maya text, is based on a current file of my writing-
work, modified by repeated unix grep < > commands, then re-worked, re-en-
tered as content. So there is a negotiation occurring between the perman-

towards an exploratory surgery of virtual-psychosis.]


Jennifer leans back on the chair, daydreaming... Alan's over by the win-
dow; they split, open wide. Alan's driven mad, Jennifer writes in repe-
tition; neither transvestite nor transsexual, her skin hugging to my own
in the form of apparel, Alan-information flows through part-objects,
structures, Jennifer-Alan's holes, connected as well with the wryting of
body, Jennifer, Alan, and so forth. Alan sends a secret to herself and
lets you in on it: one reads this message, they will know the truth. All
my love, Alan.

Architecture is never sufficient for love. If I love anyone, I love her,
pulling them tighter again.  The lovely mouth cut clear by wit and pain,
or lovely frock, train, velveteen of lace, red wedding gown: would I these
gloves have fit her, dark with grace and veil! I am so happy to have found
love and death and Elinor Wylie! I love you Jennifer! You own the hole -
one reads this message, they will know the truth. All my love, Alan, sent,
she won't come out, a virtual illness, vir viral. She's caught: withstand
this, even among the virtual, this impossible leakage through the screen.
Imperfect vacuum spews virtual particles, our skin intersecting with the
virtual.  Ah well, I descend; virtual maya refuses to appear in video; I
wear panties, wet them, her concerns with dis/ease translated into my dis/
ease of the virtual. One reads this message, they will know the truth. All
my love, Alan.

Summary: Psychosis-texts, Internet Theory through "Jennifer"
Keywords: Avatar, Philosophy, Psychology, Cyberspace
X-Newsreader: TIN [UNIX 1.3 unoff BETA release 961018]

I have been working with Jennifer, writing/developing a continuous medita-
tion on cyberspace; you can find the texts (Jennifer Texts) at http://jef-
ferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html .

Jennifer writes through a variety of styles; she is listed in the index at
the site. 

It's clear that Jennifer is not an "alter ego," or "avatar," or "gender-
bending," or "character" - but that the reality of virtual subjectivity is
incredibly complex, bordering on psychosis, on Freudian notions of hyster-
ia, and Butler's concepts of gender construction. 

You, Jennifer and others, may find the work of interest.
