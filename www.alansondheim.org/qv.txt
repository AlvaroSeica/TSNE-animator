Wu for Wikileaks (solo pipa)

The wu style uses a number of techniques, such as string-crossing,
rattling against the nails of the left-hand, playing off the frets,
harmonics, varying tremolos, chording. I use what I can here to
capture the violence of diplomacy which grounds itself in musical
performance.

Generator and Well

(very slightly) (almost) philosophically oriented images from 
children's applications (graphing and turtle) transformed into
problematic statements of inordinate surface passing for depth.
the well uses x,y parameterization with the usual suspects of
sin and tangent; the second is a polar-filter modified graph
of circular almost-but-not-quite-there meandering.

Avatar Wikileaks Server Crash Frenzy for Patrick Lichty

Active Avatar frenzy while OS parcel crashes.
We have been given to understand that Wikileaks runs on the same servers.
Alan Dojoji and Julu Twine respond to server crashes in an undeniable

We have hammered home the video of empty space.

I love you very much and want you to know you shouldn't be discouraged by 
all those people out there who are against your thinking-type and even 
your working-type, I do not know why, but we are with you, and it is sad 
to see how things are not always a perfect world for you, but I want to 
assure you the next world will be perfect for you for always and every- 
where you want it to be when you are traveling.

love Alan (our names the same, we're not to blame!)

the sphere is the most useless of objects
the breasts of Magritte and open source
the weather of Magritte and gimp filtration

death of fantasy and imagination

recording today 8-10 hours (saturday)

virtuosity is useless today.
we're all player pianos.
my instruments go out of tune with the slightest change of humidity or 
temperature.
my instruments go out of style.
there's nothing electric running in them except for electroweak forces.
their molecules might be anywhere.
their history might be anywhere.
i practice and practice an utterly useless art.
i can't dial in scales or cents; i have to run with the flow.
my fingers search, endlessly, for perfect consonance or dissonance.
everything is dissonance; perfect consonance is impossible.
welcome to the world of catastrophic balance.
my fingers pay no attention, tightening and loosening wires.
this doesn't come easy; it comes with several hours lost in the day.
these are lost hours; they do nothing for me.
for you at best they retain a sense of the antiquarian.
one second of nikuko, julu, or jennifer is worth more than weeks of 
hand-played musical noise.
right now the instruments are precariously balanced on the stairs.
they're waiting for the trip to the recording studio.
it's cold out and they'll go out of tune on the way.
they're uselessly demanding.
there's nothing to do but heed them.
i'll be the worst last virtuoso, wait and see.

(sunday)

we completed 2.9 hours of final work, 29 pieces, not that many.
i played electric saz, acoustic-electric oud, solid-body oud, violin, 
viola, chromatic harmonica, classical guitar, acoustic-electric guitar, 
ukulele, cura cumbus, ghuzeng, alpine zither, and pipa. helena played 3/4 
size cello throughout, azure sang 12 songs. we began at 11 am and ended at 
9 pm. joel was our engineer. everything was duet with helena, most often 
trio with azure, with one solo classical guitar piece. joel loaned me his 
erhu, perhaps for next time. the studio was warm and my fingers are fine, 
a surprise, even the nails are ok. the acoustic- electric oud began wildly 
out of tune; the d-string on the pipa kept slipping (so i ended one piece 
avoiding it). we'll have one vinyl from firemuseum, and possible another 
recording from yet another company. i'm leaving a loose trail of finger 
motions behind. when i'm dead there'll be this record. music is my avatar, 
my useless useless avatar.

after (going against the muscle-fed grain)


thinking through the phenomenology of bowing,
going against my worst instincts
arm swinging uh-oh back and forth
coming and going something else emerging
so far out of control! 
so there bumping and grinding!
yay yay yay!

music, baryon


when i play an instrument, a current runs through me.
now this is the aporia: it appears to be the strong force.
the strong force on the level of quarks and gluons you understand.
as if i were playing the field currents and their probabilities.
it's hard to escape the most popular feynman diagrams.
i push against the grain having no idea what might emerge.
no wonder einstein's dice-playing god had the singular die.

i play the strings vertically, not horizontally. i remain on a string.
i remain on a string and others appear as helpmates catalysts.
additional energy drives the overtones.
jumping strings is an admission of defeat.

i am the server-surveyor-surgeon of my participation. in a world
in a world of my own making in dialog with a world.
i am dead and my dialog is a dead dialog in dialog with a dead world.

in survery-surgery i speed up my files beyond recognition.
and every notes contacts every other.
you can hear the harpies screaming as the world shudders.
which world, oh this one or that one.
the world does not shudder to a halt, the world spreads and splays.

in this spread world the strings are the particles of objects.
the so resilient strings draw nothing but erupt the true-real landscape.
vibration modes produce objects buried in data-base phenomenology.
nothing exhausts nothing in this true-real world.

there is no music in this true real world. there is no sound.
i bring sound from elsewhere. the screaming harpies arrive.
they arrive from somewhere else, wayward and untoward ontology.
they give substance to display, grit to projection, dirt to platonism.

this number is not this number, it is dirt.
dirt gives matter to this number.
dirt is the suture of this number to dirt.
what seems like a film is an ontology and a philosophy.
what seems like a landscape is a psychology and ruined ideality.

i press against the violin fingerboard. i leave dna behind.
dirt dna, fingerprints, oils, bacteria, prions, viruses, and cells.
what you hear struggles to get heard.
what you see is dead when you are dead. you are dead here and now.
this is called the 'instant.'
but a current runs through it. 
and through this current i am sure it is the strong force.
and i begin the count of baryons.
i begin the baryon count.

slvoice

1-4 closely played tones on single strings with adjacent harmonics
etc. - each slvoice a different string. 5 combination with similar
figures played up the fingerboard.

coming from a dreamscape of second life sounds from just outside the 
virtual, just there, almost adjacent, what would be heard within the 
friction/frisson of worlds.

these are rather different than my other solo violin pieces, perhaps
just as miserable but with a fair accounting and virtual presence...

rotations stopped for a while (between then and now)
started again, here we go
the register's too high, speed too great
you can just barely make out the phrase

alone with the violin, i feel i can do nothing
alone with the violin, i feel i can do anything

it's the emptiness that first appears, and then the dawn,
bristling with knives and dancers

upon red, both swollen with the presence of skin and membrane, membrane
swollen slow breathing of the Net, daynight cycles, semester rabid break


no room at the inn

video and stills
opensim overburdened installation removed for the most part
  to the interior of the mountain
there it remains invisible, sometimes you find a glimpse
julu twine cannot find hirself a resting spot, s,he begs
all the nice spots are within the mountain next to the sea

it takes a long time to create absence
it takes a long time to make the proper gloom
hir flight is all that remains, s,he fails and so close
the mountain is full of energy, the proton won't decay

there is no room at the inn

there is no room at the inn
there is no manger
the wise men arrive nowhere
being wise, they're poor, bearing no gifts
in the manger, animals
in the sky, a slight overcast and waning moon
no one said anything to anyone
children were born all the time, and most didn't live
most died in childhood and most died in poverty
in rome, noise and scuttling about the amphitheater
in rome, the time was earlier, maybe an hour or so
there was no cross anywhere between rome and anywhere
there was no crime and no thieves
everyone spoke well and many spoke to many others
vertical and everlasting subjects, from gods to grounds
everyone listening politely and it began to rain
it rained lightly and people talked about the weather
here and there, wine and bread were passed out
someone knew something about a party
animals murmured as the night grew darker
a woman stepped into the shadows
people were just so tired and the air was cool

one comment 'pretty strange'


inside the mountain

the meerkat viewer allows camera views of the landscape interiors.
we journeyed through the mountain and julu twine remained outside.
we commanded hir to sit on the objects inside the mountain.
julu twine cannot move through the rocky mesh and is jounced.
jouncing takes the avatar to the sea bottom and the video ends.
following then are stills of julu twine outside, objects within.
julu twine cannot see the objects but you can.
you can see the objects and julu twine together.
more phenomenology of virtual worlds to which i am dedicated.
it's as if i present to you all the conceivable anomalies.
look it's as if i am saying i'm smarter than the avatar.
it's as if i am saying what a tangled mesh we weave.

two virtual danceworks

two work of dance with Sandy Baldwin assembled from the archive.
I love these - the music of Sandy's texts, the convoluted movements;
I've been waiting to assemble them into a full video, but this is
excellent in itself. Gathared presents a gathered goatherd variety;
gothard (which should be gathared inn content?) is a beautiful
environmental shuddering. Enjoy!

burrowing viral sexuality

May 2011 E-Poetry Presentation precis (Buffalo, NY)

I will talk about the fluid semiotics of virtual world productions, in 
terms of Kristevan semiosis and fluid logics governing both avatar and 
object behaviors through scriptings and 'signage' embedded in scripts or 
within the visible local and fluid landscape itself. I will relate all of 
this to the future of human/organic society on the planet, with or without 
the Internet, and I will do this in fifteen minutes. I would like audio- 
video output for laptop, but will not need online connectivity.

Theses:

1. Culture is always already virtual.
2. Culture is always already abject and inscriptive.
3. Abjection and inscription are entangled, irresolute, corroding both 
truth functions and definitions.
4. Culture is all the way down; every organism is a priori cultural.
5. Culture is intimately related to alterity.
6. Virtual worlds permit logical, physical, organic, sexual, linguistic, 
and psychological flows, without fundamental basis.
7. Virtual worlds are the future of the exploration of inscription, 
culture, and the imaginary.
8. A parabola leads from virtual worlds to the true-real physical world, 
which is already produced, itself as virtual.
9. Physics is the structure of the true-real physical world.
10. The appetition of physical returns us to thesis 1.


Monsoon, Neutron

solo violin; if you're short of time I'd listen as follows:
monsoon3, monsoon2, monsoon4, monsoon1
these are definitely a breakthrough, how? why?
reading George Antheil's Bad Boy of Music,
and reading Hedy Lamarr's Ecstasy and Me, 
and thinking about solo violin and its difficulty and then,
in this case, suddenly the turmoil organizes itself, 
as if the solo neutron held together, looked around! - 
i had just a moment in its roughly eleven minute half-life,
creating these, perhaps close to the total,
perhaps a bit over, but definitely the neutron!
READY TO DESTROY ITSELF AS CHARACTER!
WONDERS EMERGE!

tribal monoo for Helena

I was thinking what would be so and turned dizzy in the process.
solo violin on the GD strings, I kept trying to topple something
and it wouldn't move, you can declare it phantom and then you can
pass right through it

scheme: playing quietly as possible
bow hardly touching the strings
vibrato through violin shaking
separated emptied phrases
reverb gluing phrases together
distance among them
themes bridging phrases
post-production normalization
post-production hard-limiting
what you hear is what you get

<julu1> I'm here at last, thank you GOD!
<julu1> At the moment, nothing but a blank screen against a background, 
what?
<julu1> Burnished aluminum. So you might meet me here, Nikuko, if you have 
the time.
<julu1> Then what? In 2011, avoiding everything but the UDP wirewaves.
<julu1> I could pass you warez.
<julu1> I could pass.
<julu1> I could send secrets.
<julu1> Secrets could disappear.
<julu1> You could see my flesh and bone.
<julu1> Now you see my bone.
<julu1> In the trade we say "bone only."
<julu1> It's different than off the grid.
<julu1> The grid breaks down anyway - UDP, netsplit, the whole nine yards.
<julu1> I know you're listening to me because I know you're here because 
someone is typing this.
<julu1> There are bones making letters, molecules on the move -
<julu1> It's not just inside your head (your reading this) or mine (my 
writing this).
<julu1> It's not a style, it's bone. It's the hard white bone surrounded 
by flesh.
<julu1> You'd pay a silly dollar to see some silly flesh.
<julu1> Ignore everything you think you know; focus on the bone. On the 
nub of the bone. On the burl.
<julu1> What presses against something to make this, what might make you 
press against something else.
<julu1> These are the warez I'm passing to you, clothed in flesh.
<julu1> The bone is the secret. The bone is the secret bone.
<julu1> You'll pay attention to the flesh, forget the secret. Caress the 
flesh: bone stops it.
<julu1> Bone stops it in this and every other channel.
<julu1> Bone stops it, but you swallow the flesh. I dream you this: 
Tonight you dream.
<julu1> Tonight you dream of the flesh. 
<julu1> (My secrets are safe.)

Prairie Dogs

slowly heading towards extinction, a colony here in Aurora, walking 
distance, was gassed, the prairie, everything is dying, small songs,
yes, with errors, repetitions, in honor, memory, condolence, these
beautiful animals

Playing Out of Tune (for Yael)


I play in tune as much as possible, sliding notes on fretless instruments; 
if what I play sounds out of tune, then that's an error; if it's out of 
tune and continues the modal interplay or seems to acquiesce in something 
just beyond one's reach, that is tuneful and proper. In the meantime, the 
melodic interplay yaws back and forth, from side to side, as if the issue 
of in tune playing were absorbed in an alien architecture that one - I you 
- attempts to negotiate. The problem only arises when error shines when 
everything sees naive, broken, emptied - but even here, if error tends 
towards something useful on the horizon it may yet be forgiven.

There is also the unworrying of in tune playing when the instrument 
becomes a sonic vehicle, expressive, programmatic, without defining
                       [ Read 16 lines ]          
intervals or scales. This tends towards new territory; it also tends 
towards an easy acceptance of whatever is played. I worry among these - 
how to produce something wayward, untoward, but as if it possessed a kind 
of background that one might call broken style.

Without this, there's always the fear of incompetence. What I hear 
internally doesn't always occur externally; my mind makes up for it. This 
lends an air of foolishness to the music, of course: someone is playing 
beyond his means.

The rolling of fingers: My fingers roll into consonance; a sixteenth of an 
inch can make a difference; I hear I'm off; quickly I roll up and down; 
sooner or later things seem proper; etiquette appears and settles down; 
I'm off the hook.

There's something charming in a child playing wildly out of tune, but 
there's something horrifying in an adult following suit. I am to be 
punished; the music does that itself.

The notes may be so near, so close, but so far as well; the map is incom- 
plete. But then there's a kind of earnestess - look, he's trying, he may 
be unsuccessful, but he'll pull through - his earnestness lends an air of 
authenticity to his work - he's got something to say, and he'll say it, no 
matter what the consequences.

And you've got to go along with that, listening to what might have been, 
not what's there as plain as the nose on your face - grant him the grace 
of his work, that he's giving you a gift, no matter how wounded or tawdry 
- that the gift is a jewel with many facets, that grace might enrich your 
life, that he rolls his fingers for you, not for himself. The melody may 
be incorrect but stunning, the pathos, not in the miserable execution, but 
in the transcendent meaning, in the immanence of meaning, that overrides 
everything else, as if to say - this gift, the gift of this melody, is all 
he has to give, he's giving it his all, he's giving it with his dying 
breath, it has to be sufficient.

It has to be sufficient because, in spite of everything, it structures his 
world, and you sense that, the power of this structuring, what it says 
through what it might have said, music entangled with the grace of inten- 
tion, the broken phenomenological horizon of truth.

Lament for the Wolves

for the killing of wolves by helicopter
for the hatred of wolves
lament for the brilliance of wolves

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/wolveslament.mp3

i cannot write this, can only play it
solo viola, lament for the shooting of wolves


Lament for the Wolves, what i heard and saw

these are what i heard and saw, playing lament for the wolves,
the images are _literal,_ they were _there_ in the music, 
among the music, guiding the music, they were _shaman_ in the
_literal_ sense

the crying and mewling of wolves
howling of wounded and dying wolves
wet flanks of the wolves running everywhere
i was just above them, smell of wet fur
panting of the wolves fleeing for their lives
broken legs and necks, wolves, shot, tumbling
choking for breath of the terrified wolves
roar and sputtering of helicopter blades
sounds of firing and collapsing wolves
cries of the pups and stumbling pups
trampled pups and constant thunder
screaming animals and the loss of life
broken families and slaughtered bodies
blinded and deafened wolves
the brutal melody of death and mourning


ecology and music

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/hunters.mp3 pipa
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/huntersandgeese.mp3 guitar
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/canadageese.mp3 guitar

hunters and geese, entangled birds, in brooklyn, canada geese were 
recently gassed at prospect park - including one who had been saved, after 
an arrow was found embedded in her. the pipa expresses martial rage; the 
guitar broils, settles down in the last section.

for reasons going back to childhood, fear, depression, regret, guilt, i 
can't deal with suffering; i would cripple buddhism, oblate the terminus. 
azure kept the story from me for a long time. in aurora, outside of 
denver, we watched a story on channel 9 news - with the newscasters 
laughing as a robin repeatedly crashed into the picture window of one of 
their homes, marking up the pane with what one could only assume was lymph 
and blood. an "ornithologist" "explained" the robin wanted the home. no 
one mentioned a simple owl or other bird silhouette on the window would 
have saved the bird from injury. it was horrifying. aurora's where the 
prairie dogs were gassed. in any case, this image - of the robin - 
imprinted itself on me; it's burned in, adds to misery. (robins by the way 
are amazing; we saw one in the middle of an alpine lake in the wasatch. 
they live up into the middle of alaska, smart birds.)

another element - going for a colonoscopy tomorrow so haven't eaten all 
day and the music happened in a world of spaciness, close to fainting. i 
suppose shots fired in the imaginary helped with the broiling. i played 
carelessly but accurately, at least as well as i can tell in my condition.

bushmeat

bushmeat, what we do to animals
what our rhetoric does to humans to animals
what animals suffer (rhetoric, humans)
what humans suffer (humans, rhetoric)
speech is a violation
speech is slaughter
the imminence of speech: annihilation to the limit
the immanence of speech: limitless annihilation
bushmeat: everyone disappears
permanence of disappearance
an animal is a human
talk goes on and on precisely the same
talk is slaughter
listen to me, i will kill you
deaf and dead you: i will kill you 
i will devour you your bones
bushmeat, dead with the death of the last animal
with the last you, bushmeat gone with your death

Law's occultation

Law's occultation, outlawed in this sanctuary, and i confess occultation: 
in this part of the sanctuary, the names of gods, scape-goating, speaking 
the planet, ossuaries, stases, and defending oneself, watching slowly, the 
release of the hawk, the forms of the dead, soft, egg-like, yellowed, the 
color of Law's occultation

the testimony they had given; they cried out with a loud body, presencing, 
following, excessive. across the internet, Julu testimonies, Jennifer 
testimonies; nothing is sacred, i am pariah, sanctuary, in my skin and 
avatar, look for avatar. the testimony of schizophrenia: _they eat and are 
eaten._ [...] and hands, painlessly, but extrinsic, unable to testify. no 
testimony, no sanctuary, stillborn, mourning, submitting hir statement, 
Jennifer's, in the ossuary of the other, the mechanical.
		    o courteous trimmed testimonies,
far ossuaries in the scientific city and its sepulchers.

heidegger no kant honestly flickers through a tired eye as the debris 
after menses or semen. Body in idle chatter, flickering through random 
receptors, temporary or peripheral organism of the LCD green-screen, 
organic plasma reassembled in your water. Purified, you cradle me; I 
flicker female sleeping in the corner. Winds howl; flames make eerie 
scales, fire, long tongues spell kanji-shapes in and out of the neural, 
lists of sexual graphemes and net sex, bodies in and out of this world, 
between suns and moons

between God-calls, falling pebble sounds, flickering bodies swelling stuff 
broke. from outer space there must have been a flicker, miasma, surfeit of 
shapes, margins, exiles. Because of the flickering of addresses, red in 
the vaporous clouds that rose among the storms, electric currents in the 
neon wilderness, I hear you Nikuko. Our skin pales beneath flickering 
flourescents, jaundiced incandescents. with flickering and competitive 
protocols. There are no rooms left for the sleeping

for the memory of you, time fashions against the desert sky, blue-black 
bodies in some other space. identity arises in the flicker, which has a 
number, the number of the object, almost there, but not quite, forgotten 
among dead-desire machines. The candle flickers while he strangles his 
mother, and the other candle flickers when he stabs his father, read 
Lacan

where always something seemed to be flickering and shimmering, a darkness 
with flickering and competitive protocols. There are no rooms left for the 
one, like nuclei floating in vacuo, of no goddesses, my body flickering in 
and out and I'm ashamed (the system falters), And radical disconnects 
fragment day and night after night and day to pirouette for him. THERE ARE 
NO ROOMS LEFT FOR THE DEAD.

wax's huge flickering candle's light. she said, I will say these poems' 
she imagines her womb flickering with text pouring around it she imagines 
stuff broke. from outer space there must have been a flicker. think filled 
with water. She spat it out of this world, flickering between the picked 
poem's book, incandescent wax's huge flickering candle's light. flicker on 
unplastered wall - wildly movement, the woman caught, the flickering of 
screens - silk, not celluloid - to similar other wars reduced to mute and 
brutal silence as screens flicker out and others other as wars screens 
died before they were born: NO ROOMS LEFT FOR THE DEAD ALREADY STILL-BORN, 
ABSENT.

dark working sky, the lights sky, flickering lights towers, the people 
dark across the sky, lights flickering in the towers, people working. 
That's my role of thinking. Deities flicker on the lip-nub of death. The 
jumble begins to take advantage of screen resolution and frame/flicker 
recognition. I found myself having difficulties with flicker phenomena as 
I am lost in miasma, too many shapes, my eyes take or spew barely in 
control. ALREADY GONE.

or they're just a flicker in hir imagination.

capit

each takes the head of the others, each capitulates to the others,
each recapitulates the others, each is reminiscent of the others
of themselves
of their head outside themselves
of an unobtainable heading
of heading towards reminiscence
of never quite achieving reminiscence
of each other 
of the head of the other outside itself
of the unobtained, incontrovertible, wayward, contrary, fused
