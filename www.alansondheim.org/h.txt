These are brief notes accompanying the taxonomy/outline previously pos-
ted, and are not meant to be conclusive. Still certain ideas (such as the
_weakly-performative_ perhaps in relation to weak theory) are worthwhile.

--------------------

Given a _message base,_ a message can be construed as the primary unit or
framework within it. (The message doesn't fit into an empty slot or bin,
but defines one.) The _content_ of the message, in terms of the ordinary-
language semantics at work, crosses the framework in a nonlinear pattern
(unlike film, for example, where the frame is linear, and the content
sequentially determined by it). The framework itself of a message-base may
be in the form of an n-dimensional array, with the content-structure a
fuzzy membrane mapped onto it. 

The _content_ of the message in the sense above is passive, since the
message structure itself serves as a Peircian sheet-of-assertion, and
nothing more. Nevertheless, messages can interfere with their frameworks,
and with the framework array itself, through the use of escape-codes,
hidden characters (or their absence), etc. So the arrangement is one of
protocols, not bins, and the protocols may be modified from within, as
well as without (i.e. the determinant over-all structure). 

Foreclosing is important here; the normative message (i.e. one which has
no activating codes) possesses discrete boundaries/labels; it is the space
which it occupies. (There are no empty bins, although there may be empty
folders, messages, and (in Caucus), items.) Foreclosing refers to this
boundary-condition; it also refers to the distinctions among the various
protocol layers of TCP/IP in relation to the ASCII text of the message,
and the text's semantics/ostensible contents. The text rides on the pro-
tocol layers, and is isolated from them, just as the layers themselves are
relatively isolated. 

Foreclosing means more, however, on the level of semantics. In real-life
conversation, speech acts are accompanied by gestures, interruptions,
facial expressions, and so forth (see Derrida/Searle, Limited Inc.).
Within the Net's message-bases, posts are completed, foreclosed, before
and in relation to the reply; a series of productions are created, each
with its own formatting and ordering structures, always related to the
whole. No matter how short the reply-post is, the header remains intact 
(unless the header itself is hacked or created on a protocol level, as 
with telnet 25).

In other words, the texts are only _weakly-performative_ in relation to
ordinary conversation. In real life, verbal agreements/contracts are
accompanied by everything from handshakes to facial expressions, tone of
voice, and the obdurate presence of the body that constructs the agreement
as "authentic," much as the signature on a check is based on a construc-
tion of authenticity resulting from the movement of the hand/ fingers of a
unique body. But electronic texts, again, are foreclosed from any of the
signs of the real (even tracerouting can be faked by hackers), leaving one
with the need for at least a limited amount of good faith, in order that
the performative operate at all.

In other words, again: the performative in cyberspace is _either_ that 
which occurs as the result of activating codes, _or_ that which is, in 
relation to speech-act theory, weakly-performative at best, and based on 
a degree of good faith, first and foremost reading the body into what is 
construed as "its" site.

Definitions of Life



Everything from the three-volume Towards a Theoretical Biology, 1968,
with contributions by Arbib, Waddington, Bohm, Bastin, Thom, Mayr,
Zeeman, Grene, Langer, Gregory, and others. 

Michael Arbib, quoting R. D. Hotchkiss: "Life has been defined as _the 
repetitive production of ordered heterogeneity._ Elsasser has noted the
importance of the term 'heterogeneity,' since repetitive production of
order _per se_ could describe the operation of physical laws in a life-
less universe." The concept of heterogeneity is useful to distinguish
the crystalline, as well as crystalline kaolin evolutionary tendencies,
from more complicated biomolecular ordered structures, crystalline or
not. One thinks immediately of the tobacco mosaic virus.

Waddington works through earlier definitions of life, for example by
Jacques Loeb in 1916: "The constant synthesis, then, of specific mater-
ial from simple compounds of a non-specific character is the chief fea-
ture by which living matter differs from non-living matter." Haldane
states on the other hand, also quoted by Waddington: "The active main-
tenance of normal and specific structure is what we call life, and the
perception of it is the perception of life. The existence of life as 
such is thus the axiom upon which scientific biology depends." Note 
that here as elsewhere _reproduction_ is somewhat secondary, absorbed
above in the notion of "repetitive production," and below as part of
"active maintenance." Labor is involved, the labor of self-reflexivity,
related to the mirror stage necessary for ego maintenance.

Waddington also describes Muller as saying that "A system is alive if 
it carries specificity and can transmit this specificity to offspring
and if, in addition, the specificity can change and the changed speci-
ficities are also transmitted. Nowadays, using modern jargon, we should
rephrase this slightly, using the word information instead of specifi-
city: a system is living if it encodes hereditarily transmittable in-
formation, if this information sometimes suffers alterations, and if the
altered information is then transmitted." Waddington later questions 
this viewpoint, adding, "To be worthy of being called alive they must, I
think, exhibit some sort of 'physiological activity'."

All of this in a sense is encompassed by the interesting notion of het-
erogeneity above. Life contains what can be considered _awkward form,_
the distinguishing of parts. (Here it is moot whether or not a virus is
alive; it certainly needs a host for any sort of activation whatsoever
and might it not, in fact, be considered a prosthesis of the negativity
of the immune system of the host?)

Bohm: "Thus the difference between life and non-life (and between dif-
ferent levels of intelligence) is perhaps not in the process of evolu-
tion itself, but rather in the degree and kind of intrinsic order of 
order which has thus far resulted from the process of evolution." This
order of order refers to "the coming into being of a new and higher order
of process." It seems to me that the _symmetricizing_ function continues
to break down, somewhat rigorously, as order is transformed; this is in
line with distinguishability.

Elsewhere, Heinz von Foerster has emphasized negation as characteristic
of life, logical negation expressed, among other ways, in the turning-
away from dangerous stimuli, negative tropes. Life tends to self-identi-
fy itself as foreclosed, as "entity"; in fact, life itself may be the
fundamental characteristic of "entity." (Note the quotes.) Iberall says
something related to self-closure: "_the system eats and moves about, so
that it can continue to eat and move about._" Again, reproduction is
de-emphasized in favor of the heterogeneous; I keep stressing this be-
cause of the implications in terms of virtual life, and so forth. Virtual
life require no more or less than mobile heterogeneity within its envi-
ronment; there's no need to reference biomolecular activity. Interesting-
ly, Christopher Longuet-Higgins states "To make a sweeping statement - 
but one which seems to be much more than half the truth - it seems to me
that the problems of biology are all to do with _programs._ A program is
a list of things to be done, with due regard to circumstances."

Pattee references diachronic heterogeneity: "My approach will be to as-
sume that the potential for _hereditary evolution_ is the primary char-
acteristic of life which distinguishes it from other collections of mat-
ter." And towards the end of the second volume, we reconstruct Iberall's
approach from notes by Arbib:

"Iberall started teasing out a broad spectrum of non-linear oscillators-
macrospectroscopy - from heart beat and below to circadian rhythms and
beyond, and then realized that the oscillators _were_ the system, with 
DC changes in the milieu changing operational points of the oscillators.
This emphasized homeokinesis - the dynamic nature of regulation.
 'Any compact system containing a complex of sustaining nonlinear osci-
llators and a series of algorithms to let it operate in a wide variety
of ambient conditions...' is a living system, which may thus involve
many types of successful mechanism.
 We have dynamic regulating chains, be they stable, untable, or margin-
ally stable; self-activated motor activity; and, when time is adequate,
entrainment of the oscillations."

This is prescient and fascinating, with non-linearity heralding the 
way for symmetry-breakdown, chaos/complexity theory, and heterogeneity
on the most basic level. Such, of course, occurs within virtual life as
well, as the genotypes compete, neural networks absorb new information
about an anomalous environment, and species interact.

(All of these texts date from an era when cybernetics, catastrophe theory,
and Waddington's chreods were establishing themselves. All three of these
areas are heir to a rigid structuralism which begins to break down
(through feedback, generalized catastrophies, and chaotic trajectories).
The work is still relevant, especially in relation to issues of the pheno-
menology of life. Heteroeneity, on both an ontological and epistemological
level, is worth further consideration - odd, in relation, say, to fractal 
theory which emphasizes self-similar spaces.)

Subject: Footnote to the Life-Definition



It seems to me that life then possesses two dialectical characteristics -
interesting to think of it this way - the first is a tendency towards
totality, boundary-recognition and defense/repetition - and the second is
a tendency towards fragmentation, heterogeneity. The latter occurs as
_internal_ divisions within the former; the heterogeneous is itself repro-
ducible.

We wander around and we say, What can we do with our past? Everywhere,
Our past is trained upon us. Everywhere, there are names of people 
We do not know and histories we do not know. 

At our feet, dust carries words in an unknown tongue, and we hear stories 
In the evening, which are hidden in the bright sun of noon, such stories 
As would tell us everything, return us to ourselves. 

But we wander around in our future, our eyes put out, our ears welded 
Shut to the storm of the present, and every event we have taught ourselves 
Is already lost and beyond us.

xii

Now you have moved to this column incised in stone, and irrevocable time 
Which has come between the two, has been lost. What has occurred in the
Gap, abyss, what communications, what sayings, have been formed and lost
In the thin air? 

The planet shudders everywhere with tiny events, entities which call 
Themselves life, which to themselves are called,a s if speech were a 
Given, as though creation did not proceed, incised, "When skies above 
Were not yet named / Nor earth below pronounced By Name." 

Names cut into name, cut into earth, cut into skin and the scars 
Of the skin which are history which has tallied this and every other 
Permanence. The tally holds it open, into which years drop. 

In order for speech to begin, gaps close, stitched shut by ibid., op. cit,
Colophon. Doesn't that take us elsewhere, already forgetting telephone,
Email post, cuneiform, ipseity lost in overwhelming detail? There is no 
Conclusion to our translucency. Our _uncanniness,_ in these media, 
Fluttering and winged throughout the real, loses us, beyond the gesture 
Of speech, forgetting Shamhat, forgetting neither loss nor gain.

Laurie -

I finally got your reply and liked your post, so thought I would tell you 
that Panix, at least part of it, is up and running again. I think a lot 
about the past, and always had; I wrote something once about clutter and 
its relation to miniscule histories - a scrap of paper floating by 
outside, and so forth. It's this alterity that I think is the most 
radical devouring, literally eating-out, of culture - this continuous 
facing of unknown pasts, which themselves are obliterated, fragmented. 
Clutter and garbage are the choking, fractalization of time, the elimina- 
tion of site or the stability of language - I'd almost say that these 
characterize the crisis of capital itself, the headlong rush into an 
extrapolated future. 

A styrofoam cup is used once; formed ultimately from oiled soup that may 
or may not signal the originary debris of life, it appears as the result 
of unknown manufacturing processes and sites, slathered through multiple 
distributions, to pass as scarcely visible or transitive across the body 
of the user, almost immediately discarded. No names are attached, 
nothing; if we could understand the phenomenology of the cup, we would 
understand our culture. But the phenomenology itself is disrupted, 
broken, and we're left, literally, hanging, suspended in time, only death 
a certainty somewhere along the plane (no longer along the line).

MOO: 

(From Big-Tail, Haida Texts and Myths, Swanton)

 During that time Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-
the-sea held him in his armpit. He let him look at the supernatural
beings. But the supernatural beings did not know it. 
 As before the house began to shake. Presently the feet of someone
appeared coming in through the doorway. After some time had passed he
stepped in, and the house shook. Then the supernatural beings said "A". 
He took a step with the other foot. Something with large, broad eyelids
entered. Nothing happened. 
 Some time after that something came along making a rattling noise. By 
and by she came in with a crowd of female servants. Djila'qons it was who 
came in among them. She had her eyebrows painted with red paint. They 
entered. Something about her sounded like a rattle. Big-tale kept his 
eyes upon her all the time.
 But Woman-sitting-and-smelling walked in before her. After having sat
there for a while she raised herself up. She began to talk to Djila'qons. 
She asked her why she had painted her eyebrows red and Djila'qons
answered: "I had it done on your account." Then she turned toward the 
wall and wiped it off. And she turned toward the fire and sat down.
 Sometime after they say that Pestilence came in. His canoe was like a 
white man's vessel. Sparks flew out of it. They went through the house. 
For that reason the supernatural beings were afraid. The things that came 
out of it are what cause sickness. The supernatural beings feared they 
would strike them. He refused to enter. He went back.
 Then the nephew of Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-
the-sea went out and said: "You are not the only one who has supernatural
power. I have supernatural power. My uncle also has supernatural power. 
So you better not come in." Then he (the nephew) entered, and when he
untied a little something against the roof of the house, which was like a
hollow tube closed with knots at both ends, Pestilence's canoe was quickly
turned about. Then he said he would enter. "I will go in." Presently he 
entered. Nothing happened. [They say it was Tidal-wave who owned that.] 
All that time a space was left vacant in the rear of the house. No one 
sat there. By and by the one who came in first sang. And, after he had 
finished singing, he acted with a mask on from behind the screen they had 
stretched across. After he had acted with the mask on for a while, it 
split crosswise on his face, and snow came out of it in a broad sheet. 
Then it fell first by the vacant seat. After that it fell in front of the 
chief's house. And after that his face also split vertically. Out of the 
split the same substance fell. That was property, they say.

One day a woman was engaged in roasting rice. A man went by on his way to
plough in his fields and asked her for fire. She was sitting with her legs
stretched out and he saw her thing and liked it. He thought, 'If I ask for
it, she will never give it to me.' So he went behind her and sent out his
long penis: it went circling and curving round, and at last went in. The
woman lifted up her rice-husker and brought it down with a bang on the 
penis, cutting it in two. The seed came out: she planted it in an anthill
and a mushroom grew from it: that is why the mushroom is always slimy. For
this reason too woman wears a pubic cloth, so that men may not see her
thing.

Why morphing is not always a good idea:

Gond

_Pakhri, Mandala District_

In former times, the penis grew from a man's forehead: it was three hands
long and hung down in front like an elephant's trunk. Woman's vulva was in
the middle of her chest. But one day Bhairopal went in a marriage-party
to a certain village. He was chasing the girls with his long trunk, shak-
ing it at them as if he would beat them. The Manjhi's wife was angry at 
this and came out with a knife to cut it off. He grasped it in his hands
but he could only save four fingers' breadth. The Manjhi's wife cut off
the rest and threw it away. But now the stump sticking out from the fore-
head did not look nice, and men went to Mahadeo and begged him to put it
somewhere else. He placed it between the thighs Then Parvati went to him
and said, 'It is not good that men should have their thing so low down and
women should have it so high up.' Mahadeo kicked her between the thighs
and made a hole there.

Why the fear of women always results in the same old story:

Gond

_Bilhar, Bilaspur District_

When the first child was born, his mother sprinkled his penis with hot and
cold water. When the boy went for the first time to a girl, he found fire
insideher. Because of the fire, the skin of his penis shrank. That is why
the prepuce can be pulled back.

Book and Information


Since I've been on-line I read more than ever. I read books, almost no 
newspapers, some magazines, get my news through radio/television while 
working on-line, but since then recently I found the trajectories tak- 
ing over the Usenet groups, useful for the quick info fix given a que- 
stion or two but hardly room for anything more, and I get scared read- 
ing some of the poems coming over the line sensing nothing learned now 
and then in thousands of years so thinking don't go here for the quick
fix but read the works first beforehand how else you going to cut rock 
with a fine touch, almost paper thin, reading the lines inscribed upon 
it? 

The Web bounces around like juggurnaut with us beneath it or nineteen- 
th century car almost the same carrying painted performances, but when 
you tired of the same or bridge the information you find you're not in 
fact inhabiting or dwelling within almost too many statements that you 
might place together in a chain in order to suture the hunger that dr- 
ives you still, no matter. It's in the book and what doesn't come acr- 
oss is the book, the dark vaginal crease where page joins page, or re- 
minder of thought's bridged abyss, as when the router either loops, or
disappears.

Thought disappears, dross and chaff quaffed, tossed down. So decathect
now Web, Usenet, I still wander Media's halls, but inhabit thought:  |
see, there's this discussion on Future Culture begun with what       |
would be the best language, no matter, and this absurdity then       |
leading into language's inhabiting, dwelling, from which with-       |
in the threshold, not even an equivalence but a necessary abs-       |
ence of comparison occurs. This inhabiting. Which is what the book is.
Which is what is the opening of the book, not even hypertext, not even
links but these moments of transformation where your action is nothing 
at all or more than the turn of the page from the turn of the eyes. In 
this way what is broken is made whole again and, one can rest in know-
ledge.

Subject: Short-Wave



Monitoring the Spectral Mother*


I have listened a lot to short-wave, introduced the signals into my films 
and videos, and others have followed suit. I monitored 9260 and 14562 
when there were anomalous signals on these frequencies; I did it for 
months. I followed regularly radio Tahiti and Pinyang in N Korea, caught
Radio Moscow immediately (ten minutes) after the downing of the Korean 
Airliner, when the first announcements came over.** Now short-wave is dis- 
appearing as a government medium, taken over to some extent by mainly 
Christian right-wing stations, and the airwaves are growing more and more 
silent as people turn to the relative reliability of the Net.

I miss the crackle of the ocean, the sound of solar flares and sunspots,
the ionospheric bending, breathing, as day turns into night turns into
day. I miss the signals like shrieks, unidentified always, the numbers
stations still out there, voices and sounds from the depths of the ocean
where Internet is carried, if at all, through satellite transmissions. I
miss the sound of the earth itself, signals escaping into space with ex-
ploits always and everywhere. Or the rumble of whistlers down in the long
waves, all of these silenced as short-wave becomes less and less an option
for culture, although all those musics, and there was nothing like running
through 3am Indonesia, where are they now but grounded here in the digital
realm, the clean and proper body where planetary cries and whispers are 
filtered into all-too-convenient packets, bound like broken perfect 
bodies in fiber-optic cables. 


------------------------

*an article I wrote for Review of International Broadcasting, reissued, 
years ago, in Ear, on the psychoanalytics of short-wave listening...
** news: it was so clear the downing was accidental, the broadcasts
scrambling for the story, everything confused, contradictory...

Reading Others


I was waiting for the bus to Pennsylvania. I began thinking about loss,
about the myths I have been reading on occasion all my life, how these
myths are so antithetical to the Greek and Roman legacy, to the Niebel-
ungenlied, to the Eddas as well. While I was waiting I wrote about the
lack of closure in a lot of other myths, the concatenation of events
rather than their tethering to schemata that seem to bring them in like
spies out of the cold. The real's foreclosed in the Classical legacy, and
even the work done on generalized taxonomic classifications of themes/
structures (or structuralism's classical legacy for that matter), tends to
obscure the alterity of these narrations (for that is what they are, rath-
er than, I think, "tales" or "legends," since they move about subject-
wise, even to the extent of local psychogeographies). 

Foreclosure is everywhere within the Classical, ranging from the complex-
ity of rhyme schemes beyond the couplet, to the future anterior tensing
of fate. The rhetorical is always already foreclosed, just as linguistic
structure appears before its fulfillment (relegating pauses, in general,
to an appearance _after_ the bridge, as in: "I was going home, but, uh,
I went to her house instead."). So language appears against the real,
in the guise of the symbolic; meanwhile, I search for an anti-symbolic
in the midst of language, borrowing from the potential of an anti-struc-
turalism such as found in Jean Duvignaud's Change at Shebika, itself a
classic text at this point. (Note that even Lingis modulates into fore-
closure based on desire, culmination, fulfillment, tumescence.)

Then, near the time of departure, my batteries running low, I thought
further into these differences, considering the role of writing itself
(Ong, McLuhan, Sampson, there are dozens of others) - writing creating
text as a data-base which is non-linear, surprise, which can be accessed
anywhere and everywhere, and which thereby lends itself to overall or
overt structure, structure beyond the couplet, beyond the localized
alliterations which themselves quickly developed rules. 

The TEXT is a movement from the imaginary to the symbolic, from the sha-
manic uncanny to foreclosure, from affect to effect. On the other hand,
REPETITION is a return through defuge to the imaginary, uncanny, and
affect. (See my texts in the g.txt portion of the Internet Text.)

Because the text is what has always already departed the body, speech left
behind, packets in fact. The bus came, taking me away, out of New York,
into Pennsylvania, towards something even more familiar. Later I thought
about reading the others, where there are no texts, where texts only come
into being through postscription, where texts come into play.

-q                                                to die every step of
the way. Can one write or read under such circumstances? Does the real
have only a limited bandwidth, so that, as pain increases, the rest of
the world falls away? Does the symbolic in the text begin to disconnect,
as it does in depression, so that the matrix is still understood and
expandable, but nothing ties meaning to the world and the self simultan-
eously? (Does game-playing help, expanding one within the realm of mean-
ing?)

As in depression, the world disinvests, decathects - as if it ever were
invested, cathected. Unlike depression, there is no _thing_ as general-
ized anxiety, instead, the body drops away into _cascades_ of pain, at
times an obstacle necessitating bypass or sublimation, depending on the
height of the barrier, the well into which the body is thrown. The world
is no longer present, and one slowly utters upon a screen of cloth, grey
with the intermediary status of the soiled world.

The space we write in is cleansed, even if written in blood. It's only
the shell of the body, tattoo removed without the history of tissue be-
neath the surface. The world is severed by virtue of the microtome.

Debugged.

Thinking the Although


Travis reacted to the crawling of needles through space; they were grouped
in cones, vectors emanating from elliptically loose sectors, constantly
mobile, forms of inconceivable life. The needles were almost uniform in
length, line segments which nonetheless appeared as if their headstream
from the origin carved into the emptiness of virtual particles. And so
their headstream thrust out of emissions, origins, sources, delays, sub-
terfuges, enormous, quiet, and miserably small in the great solitude. For
Travis knew instinctively that his mind alone was organizing the rays,
wrapping them together in an obscene language that mapped his body in 
the midst of the nebula, handstreamers, footstreamers reaching everywhere
like wires carrying the void within them, the abyss without. 

Space shimmered with the grouping of the needles, dark, almost bloodbrown,
striated undergoing transformations in the sectors from which all others
were defined, defined as nothing more than memory. Maybe his last thought
was that of the neural causeway, but there was no last thought. Maybe he
thought of the detour of the symbolic, the limited alphabetic sets that
importuned to carry the weight of gestures beyond gestures, sloughing into
invisible octants of invisible inflationary spirals. 

Or maybe he thought that thinking wouldn't do, that there was a certain
wisdom in this, and somehow this wisdom filled him, Travis-tumescent, with
the limitless thinking, the needles becoming the fabric of thought, his
mind and body splayed open into the emptiness surrounding him. Were there
others or were there no others. "although the one mind is, it has no exis-
tence," although "negation hides her eyes from her selves which encompass
all things," although "the space of that which is not is the space of what
it is to be the name of me," although there were no others, although 
Travis.

Travis moved his right arm with the sweep of the universe, and galaxies
turned furtively, radiation beamed from dark matter's central regions.
Travis moved his left arm and supernova roared with the uncanny sound of
the internal scream of nuclear transformations. Travis blinked and his
right eye shot through the wormhole of space and time impaled elsewhere
but the same, shot out from blindness roughed towards the body's absenting
despair. Travis spoke and his mouth swallowed primeval life and death,
dooming planets to bleak desert forever, cheated from their rightful 
inheritence of biomolecular beginnings.

Travis:

His hair wrapped in the vectors crawling everywhere towards the stars, or
crawling nowhere, or penetrating pores and subterfuges of the flesh. His
thinking the "although," Travis thinking the "although" which was for him
although he would never know it the beginning of his thought.

Travis: crawled with the membrane of the stars, incandescent molecules
shunting electrons and photons in Bell-theorem unison pulsing with the 
preliminary consciousness of space-time frothed into the right eye of
Travis.

Travis: He pulled back and watched the needles with remaining sight. When
they approached bloodbrown, he did not blink. When they entered, he was
still like the stone he would have remembered. When they penetrated, the 
feeling was one of almost gathered towards the thing of thinking. When he 
began thinking he knew it was from something behind him which was a place. 
The place shimmered, disappeared, Travis thought "although."

Born at the Wrong Time


I was born at the wrong time; we all are. Instead of coming to an end of
knowledge, we are posed on the brink of thinking that will take decades,
if not a century to complete. The computer for example is still in its
infancy; in two decades, surely, human-level intelligence will be ach-
ieved. But it will be two decades more before the social is set askew by
this, and even longer if war, famine, or other catastrophies intervene
in the still exponential growth of memory, somewhat already levelling out.

Cosmology, which at one time seemed almost near completion (before the
discovery of quasars), is now wide-open; again, expect decades of work
before anything settles. While DNA has been reasonably decoded, the mind
is still relatively unknown; the exact mechanism of memory is still open
to speculation. Evolution itself is full of gaps, including our own heri-
tage. Literary theory never advances, but circulates/circumambulates; it
continues to do so.

Space exploration, which began with great enthusiasm in the 1960s, has 
been relatively moribund. The great particle accelerators are reaching
their limit. Fusion power is still unworkable. Cancer remains by and large
unknown. Nanotechnology is decades away. Ageing remains obdurate. Compu-
ter-mediated-communication is also in its infancy. Virtual reality has
only begun, largely a matter of clothing and headgear at this point, and
hardly seamless. Fractal, complexity, and catastrophe theory have not
proven to be the mother-lode (gender intended) of applied mathematics.
Axiomatics has dissolved. 

We are beginning to see at least localized disappearances of the classic/
colonial nation-state, replaced by localized mafias tending towards the
global. If this is the beginning of a new feudalism, it will be at least
fifty years before it hardens into place as well, with nuclear threat a
primary component of its fragmented operations. To date, the political
has impeded techological development very little; there is a great degree
of redundancy built into the planet. It is moot at this point whether it
will continue however. And we are all increasingly aware of the impact of
new, virulant diseases; within several decades, these can only increase 
in number. Ecologically, the earth is facing the greatest rate of global
species extinctions ever; we have no idea what the future portends in this
regard. This is not nature doing business as usual; global warming and the
continued increase in ozone holes will be future problems as well; the sea
level is rising inexorably. In the industrialized countries, ageing will
also be a problem, unless a new consciousness arising, perceiving those 
over 70 say as viable members of the community and treating them as such.

There is some indication that natural catastrophies are also on the in-
crease, partly as a result of human intervention; a flood in my region of
Pennsylvania was partly caused by a storm hovering over New York in a
heavily deforested area, creating enormous runoff. So far these catastro-
phies have been relatively contained; this may not always be the case.

In the United States and other industrialized countries currently swing-
ing to the right, the middle and lower classes are becoming increasingly
abandoned; the result is a hardened upper class which need pay no atten-
tion to the rest of the population. Health care for the rest, like auto
insurance, is rising inexorably in cost; the gap between black and white
(in terms of income, etc.) is increasing. This trend began at least two
decades ago; it may continue for decades longer.

I was born at the wrong time; we all are. We are only beginning to recog-
nize our ignorance, after having passed through a classical period of
science (no matter what warnings came from Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, etc.)
dominated by Hertz's mechanics, Klein's mathematics, analysis in general.
Now, it's not so much that, as Lyotard would have it, the meta-narratives
have disappeared into the froth of the postmodern, but that we know the
narratives as unknown - not emptied, but yet to be discovered (if ever).
All our work, and I truly believe this, is condemned to oblivion, to
the curiously antiquated; Baudrillard often reads as such already. The 
turn of the millennium will force us to search farther forward; the past 
has very few signposts to guide us.

So we're interstitial, fulfilling someone else's dream, chattering away
here, with very few clues, or clues that will only be recognized from a
vantage-point we'll never have. Not that there's any reason to despair:
my texts, for example, take up a certain amount of cultural space, at 
least for the second they appear before your eyes, on the road to quick
delete.

Why the Rich Right Will Win


Development = absolute destruction. When an ecosystem is plowed under, it
never re-establishes; at best, an impoverished version with hardier spe-
cies results. The left must call for eternal vigilance which costs money
and time; the right need only wait for an opportune moment. 

Money breeds money; anyone who has a bank account knows that the rich are 
rewarded by higher yields. This filtering breeds class division, never so 
much as at the moment when all of us are paying for the S&L scandals that 
have kept the rich alive, right, and happy.

Privatization is on the increase - home-owners' associations and so forth,
and this tends to distance the poor and their effects on the rich: look at
Brazil or Washington, D.C. Along with privatization, surveillance infil-
trates the poor, who can no longer invisibly organize, and conspiracies
are becoming, more than ever, nothing more than a media effect. 

Increasing regulation of communications (don't forget that television at
one time was _experimental_ and open to everyone all over the band) places
them in the hands of the rich who can afford to bypass any restrains what-
soever. The rich right have _always_ had abortions.

It is the _nature_ of the left to be disparate, and, ever since Marx, dis-
believing in grand narratives. It is the _nature_ of the right to be 
totalizing, monolithic. It is the right who can afford global telecom, 
resulting in global organization; the corporate right, after all, organi- 
zes and owns communications. The poverty of the left - as well as poverty 
itself - is becoming increasingly marginalized.

The _fear,_ still palpable, of technology, sexuality, and the erosion of
the nuclear family, plays into demagogues who simultaneously require
freedom to bear arms and freedom to control the bodies and thoughts of
others. This is a war - don't doubt it for a second - over _women_ and
their _place(ment)_ - as if the pornographic would, _in the first ins-
tance,_ seduce them away from the control of men. 

Ignorance breeds powerlessness and the poor are less and less schooled, 
the left less and less accessed to praxis. 

The lessons of the media are the lessons of _language_ itself; freedom is
transformed into something problematic in the face of language management
and the confusion that is generated by situational ideologies. More: the
right is increasingly concerned about managing _children,_ and this
management hides very real interests - the defusing of radical intent, 
the construction and maintenance of etiquette, class interests, and the 
clean and proper body, and the preparation for a christian millennium.

Why the Poor Left Will Lose


Every move the left makes is relative; every move the right makes is 
absolute. Every move the left makes acknowledges history; every move the 
right makes replaces it. The right is interstitial and symbolic; the left 
must be continuous and imaginary, requiring more resources than available.

Poverty breeds poverty; ignorance breeds poverty; bad education breeds 
ignorance; only poverty may breed good education but remains powerless, 
relative, dispersed, out of flow and control of the media.

The poor and cultural workers are by and large marginalized; art and the 
avant-garde are filtered into design into the homes of the rich. The rich 
watch the poor; the poor, thinking they understand everything, understand 
nothing. The rich, thinking they understand nothing at all, understand 
everything.

The poor left have _always_ had abortions. The poor left have died from 
them. The poor left have their speech taken away; long live rap.

There is no left; there are lefts. The rich know there are no poor.

The war over women is also the war _against_ women, fought within the 
aegis of poverty as well. No one wants pornography; no one looks at it.

The less-schooled poor are also less accessed to the Net and other more 
advanced communications; changing standards ensures they will remain 
excluded forever, no matter what the rhetoric.

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.

WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND HE IS US.

across stuttered dark waters crossed by rivers meandering on their own.

O you will come to me singing of beauty beauty. I will hear you a long 
breath moment before your lovely presence. There are speckles through the
long day of the summer, dark swirling sperm in the midst of the whiteness
of satin in hard and heavy now. It is a desire to be heard, always. It is
a desire. Ah thus the love of this.
