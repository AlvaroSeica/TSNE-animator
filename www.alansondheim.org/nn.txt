performance text u. buffalo

right now i'm waiting to begin ,,, right now i'm not
right now i'm not going anywhere, thank you for the comments maria, your
last name is nomad backwards of course, which ties in with diaspora, i
wish there were momre to say about this, this is a new program i'm
writing in, not sure how it's going to handle the text the piece on the
right is called deathfugue, after paul celan, that reference to
margarite, you can see it in the butterflies.... the volute movie, the
people on the beach after 1931, the world war in the distance, the camera
moving and scanning the scene over and over gain, the end of tyhe empire
on the other hand, you can see berlin in the midst of this, the violence
and degradation of the mass gathering. now i will collect myself.

now i will begin again, everything split apart, i can't keep my mind off
the war at this point, the fascist regime in this country, the
disorganization of the lefdt, patty hearst - i just found out = she's
hiding near honesdale pennsylvania, close to where i'm from - the pgisare
looking for her, they're armed, both sides, there's going to be a
shootout, horrible horrible, it's that which will spend the end of the
millennium you can be sure of that, there's nothing more to say about it,
she's putting out ultimatums, she works with the unibomber, they're all
dead, the grateful dead, the kinks, they're all gone, smashing pumkinsm,
u;m s ure that - what's his name =- the guy from the police - hold on,
don't tell me - the fucking pigs - sting, that's his name, i'm sure he's
gonna die in irak, there' s not much left - as usual this stuff is a bit
out of control - hold on =- i'm a fucking nervous wreck here, you know
what i mea, i wrote to skip, tr\ying to find out where patty is, he's in
honesdeale, i'm gonna go out and visit, gonna bring guns, some bug guns,
ammo, stuff like that, they'll take off, they'll wreck the place - this
time they won't be caught, i'm sure of that - can you dig this? all thew
stuff in the world donesn't mean a damn thing in relation to the learning
here  = it's incredible - at the university -= hearst was last seen here
- last time i gave a talk - tony copnrad took her in - his heart's in the
right place - it was FURIOUS they talked into the night = politics back
and forth, left and more left, he got it right, she learned, she lefdt on
the back of a truck - Loss was driving, I'm not kidding about this - it
sounds funny now - but the results of the bombing wasn't - weren't i
guess - they were hideous - buty at least it got bush out of office - the
third bush - they were fucking running the presidencye foreve - something
had to be done - something had to make sense in this crippled world of
oiurs -= they're terrorists everywhere - ljust look around you - like in
the days of old ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OF YOU IS A TERRORIST - look to
your left - look to your right - one out of every three... you don't know
where on when ...
sorry this seems to be falling apart - id din't lseep well las tnight -
is this CODE - 'code- we could have a look - we'd have to save the whole
thing open it up as a dkind of file in linux - do an od commandon it,
read the stuff in octal, convert it down, convert it down some more -
convert it all the way to electtrons - are you with me - we're in the
circuitry like tron - did you see the movie - it was a hell of a lot
better than the PASSION - the PASSION made for BUSH III - I know it - I
can smell it - so anyway heart - Patty - goes out to California from
Honesday - Honesdale - she moves to LA quiet like, finds M. Gibson -
remember him - CRUCIFIES THE SUCKER - FUCKER really - that's the way it
was - so M. Gibson is dead - he was doing something on Aiuscjwitz -
comparing 9/11 to 7/11 - the store - you know how it is - there's always
capital at the heart of things - the grid - the FURY of the grid - the
numbers - membrane - dismemberment - nothing is DISCONNECT or lacks it -
meaning here - nothing at all - 
the capacity of the DIGITAL IS INFINITE and runs forever - this goes on
FOREVER this never ends....
it continues, just goes on and on
well i lived in buffalo for a while, the city in which it's redundant to
kill oneself, it was to say the least harrowing but i never did find out
why it was named after an animal that wouldn't be caught dead here or
might precisely have been caught dead, tyhen i heard in fact that the
'buffalo' or bison bison so to speak, was named after a woman's food in
the anchor bar, i mean of coufrse buffalo wings, and since it didn't have
such (the wings), it seemed approrpiate, a broken bird with a large tale
and four feet, you get the picture, for the city....
europe 1914. the war is about to begin.
the flame of liberty. we're bringing alibretty to irawk.
we'll bring liberty to syria next. they could use some 'liberty.

i think we'll bring it to belgium. especially jeffersonian liberty. that
will go over big.

bush III speaks fluent arabic,. thank GOD!

the flame goes on blah blah blah
goes on and on blah blah blah
thank you

bunnies

the bunnies made strange calls, odd calls,
gruntings, not the thumpings but the gruntings -
'"I say" 'there is a chair'" - Wittgenstein in
translation - right over the other lupus' ears,
just like that! --->:anyway the rabbits did this
five or six times in a row and it seemed
fairlyclear they were playing and right in front
of us in the middle of the night. Honestly, you
should have seen them! I never saw such a thing!
I never knew rabbits could do such a thing! "Do
not try to analyse your own inner experience." -
Wittgenstein in ranslation -:i pucker my lips
constantly in the absence of the shakuhachi. i
know its murmuring burbling abbling brook. now
i'm at a loss, having transformed bAbbling into
something else entirely - in any case, when i
die, these three instruments will huddle in a
maddening corner, bubbling with mournful
murmuring cries - "Not it's looking like him." -
Wittgenstein in translation - ]]] here is a
space. the one rabbit runs straight at the other
and the other rabbit jumps vertically at the very
last moment over the first rabbit and landf in
the same spot.that's 'lands'. <----::

Write through my the bunnies made strange calls,
odd calls, gruntings, not the thumpings but the

what was it - just a moment ago - some sort of 
confusion - i forget what i was going to say - 
just a minute - what was i saying - it's on the 
tip of my tongue - did i say something like this 
a while ago - write something like this - i could 
look it up i think - maybe you could help me - 
are you reading this - get back to me - what was 
i saying - i'll get it in a minute - that's not 
it - i've almost got it - it's a bit fuzzy - you 
probably think i'm kidding - that this is some 
sort of a piece - honestly it isn't - there's 
something i wanted to tell you - something i 
wanted to write - i don't know - i thought if i 
started like this it would come back - i think 
this happens a lot - maybe early memory loss - 
dementia or something like that - now what would 
happen  - i'll just send this along - it's my 
thing for today - i bet you knew it all along - 
something like that - i just completed my 
assignment! - it wasn't that either -

passion-8

http://www.asondheim.org/passion.mov

a small movie of the Passion of Christ according to me
for which great thanks to Sandy Baldwin
but I will take all responsibility for this depiction
which is so radical I mean it is really 'beyond radical'
but then not like the current right and left
meeting at the nexus or stage of violence and fury
no instead it takes the swooped swooned soul
and send it outward to the outer space of heaven
it is better than good and grander than grand
there are so many good folks to thank
who made me what I am today that I can only send out
a Shout of this film to one and all
now sit back and watch the Action

Landscape Sonneta

The enormous strombuliform building was shaped like a dwelling in the form
of a top. Yellow-crossgas spewed like mustard gas foaming from the roof.  
Next door was a lumper unloading a ship like a workman emptying a boat.  
Next to the workman was a grindstone producing swarf and a grinder making
grit. Zygal struts like H-shaped scaffolding connected the swarf-pile to
the lumper-spaddle or workman-shovel. The dataller or daily lumper was in
reality a ruffler or beggar posing as a maimed soldier. His art was buhl
creation like metal inlay. An aeolipile connected to the swarf-maker
relayed its steam-power statistics to the strombuliform structure. Several
lumper noticed suricates or a kind of mongoose stumbling from the yellow.
The horse-touter nearby spoke first. Maladroit lumpers, he proffered with
customary incommunicability, an eleot, or apple-type is yours. The lumpers
carried newels or staircase-parts; neverthemore would they throw the
rodlet. Swellish in swan-skin, they continued their gymnical hackery.

[Fifth]

Why I can never sleep and never will know, I won't at this rate, it's a
mystery. I worry the world, continually try to grasp it in its entirety,
miss things left and right, question authority, question the grounds and
desire of authority, generally make things worse - I can't let go, feel I
have to recreate, make the world over and over again... It's an
occurrence, something like an atmosphere that accompanies me, makes
others uneasy as I stumble hopelessly through life. At this point, there
are so many voices, so many scripts of things going wrong - the world not
only falls apart, but it _ceases to exist_ - meaning decathects as
depression and worse set in. This sounds abstract, but isn't; it's
dominated by one or another scenario that compulsively repeats and
develops until the nightmare appears, everything collapses, the story
changes to another, and the cycle repeats. This occurs through sleep and
wakeful states, hypnagogic states as well - it's _there_ as a process in
all its fury. There's no end to it; I'm left in a constant state of
exhaustion, no matter how hard I try to write myself out of it...

Books I like and highly recommend!


The following are books I've read or am currently reading, mostly the 
former. They're wonderful and I think are definitely worth your attention.


Two books that bear comparison, both from Salt

Catherine Daly, DaDaDa and
Loss Pequeno Glazier, Anatman, Pumpkin Seed, Algorithm

These are first of all both beautiful books. And they work through
technology and technologies in odd ways, ways that configure the
integration of the technological into body and poetic discourse, as if
spectral communications were phantom limbs or tendrils extending from
desktops and PDAs , within and without. Glazier works out of an
incredible, intense, Mexican and Cuban (for the most part) matrix, which
becomes himself as well. His is an 'important' book within emerging
discourses of real and virtual continents. And Daly's work as well, with
its internal technologies, technologies as breathing, or as electric 
Marguerite, mythos, scaled histories. I really recommend these books 
highly; I found them inspiring and turning language towards infinities 
both electronic and intensely real.

From Raw Nerve Books

Sue Thomas, Hello World, travels in virtuality

This is an odd work, a mix of real and imaginary journeys, discoursing on 
psychogeography, Bachelard, and a broad-based view of the Net along the 
way. As a mix it's intense and entrancing, and it's demonstrates the ease 
with which computers, electronic communications, and lives all intertwine 
beyond the home. This isn't the typical mobile technology journey, but a 
journey of integration, and it's as such that I highly recommend it. My 
only concern - and I have no answer for this - how much, today, should one 
describe the Net and its communications systems? As Katherine Hayles 
points out on the back cover, the book is 'Highly recommended for first- 
time users and those who want to try dipping their toes into the 
cyberwaters.' But for those of us who are familiar with the technologies, 
the value is elsewhere - following this journey, and Thomas's lived and 
interpenetrated spaces, across the world. There is an associated website 
by the way, http://www.travelsinvirtuality.com . (This is by the way a 
work I wish I could have written, but my own journeys have seemed too 
monstrous and tangled, too compressed. There's a sense of space in 
Thomas's book that's both open and comforting.)

From Atelos

Brian Kim Stefans, Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics, which _is_ more
or less digital poetics itself. I love dipping into this work. There's a
huge gap between it and Richards' Practical Criticism, but I like them
both for their caress of writing, and _fascination_ with their target
texts, reproduced among themselves, authorships in question. The Scotch is
there in Stefans' work, for example, both real and imaginary. There are
numerous sidebars and footnotes as well; the text skitters. This is simply
a wonderful book.

From Minnesota comes

Anne Weinstone, Avatar Bodies, A Tantra for Posthumanism. I have diffi-
culty at this point with theoretical posthumanist texts that discourse on
desire; on the other hand, I'm fascinated by the relationships Weinstone
draws or breathes with Tantra; it's this which holds me. I don't feel
capable of commenting on the text itself at this point, except to note the
pleasure it gives, as well as assumptions about multiple selves,
virtualities, and our selves avatars. It reminds me of Lingis' work - and
in general where is Lingis in cyber discourse? But then I'm ignorant. -
I do want to stree that I am reading and rereading sections of this work, 
scurrying across it, another skittering, and I find the text amazing in 
this regard.

From O'Reilly

One more technology book, which I immediately applied and have been using 
furiously - Preston Gralla, Windows XP Hacks, part of the Hacking series. 
This book is simply great - I've applied at least 20-30 of the hacks to my 
own (video/audio/blender/text) laptop system. I've used other WinXP books 
to good effect, but this one in particular has been extremely useful. I 
couldn't have done http://www.asondheim.org/node.mp3 without it. 

Some older books if you find them -

Kossovo, Heroic Songs of the Serbs, translated by Helen Rootham (with the 
original texts), Houghton Mifflin Company, 1920. This volume focuses on 
the battle of Kossovo 1389, and the starkness and repetitiveness of the 
songs have parallels of course with Yugoslavian epics, Homer, etc. These 
are intense pieces, some of them fragments, and they've already entered my 
dreams. The only problem with the book is its shortness.

Serge Gavronsky, Toward a new Poetics, Contemporary Writing in France, 
consists of interviews of texts; it's from 1994, and I should have known 
the work! Authors include Deguy, Gugliemi, Hocquard, even Pleynet. (The 
last's book on painting is incredible by the way.) Get it if you can. 
Enough said.

In Bhargava's Dictionary, Anglo-Hindi, the definitions are in both English 
and Hindi, and this is one of the most wonderful sources of words I've 
come across; the definitions are often beautiful. My edition is the 12th 
from 1966, and I've been using it regularly. Extersion, act of wiping or 
rubbing. Tortive, twisted. Airmanship, the art of handling an airship.
Gothamite, a great fool.

Legge's I Ching - I like this for the endless notes and clarity of the 
appendices; it's not as poetic as the Wilhelm, but I'm not using the work 
for divination or poetry. Dover edition. There's a small paperback 
(Mentor, 1971) edition of the book rearranged with the hexagram names and 
other minor changes, edited by Raymond van Over; I recommend this as well, 
especially for clarity.

Burton Watson, Records of the Historian, Chapters from the Shih Chi of 
Ssu-ma Ch'ien, California, and Sima Qian, Historical Records, translated 
by Dawson, Oxford World's Classic. I can't get enough of this work; the 
Dawson edition shows why. There are parallels between the Qin and Bush 
dynasties that are unnerving; hopefully both will last an equally short 
amount of time.

Finally I'm reading the full version of The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, 
translated and edited by Ivan Morris in two volumes (one text, one notes), 
published in 1967. It's quite different, in fact, due in part to the 
sections of lists, and I much prefer it. I haven't seen this reissued, but 
if you have a chance at all, find and read it (i.e. in preference to the 
Penguin edition).
