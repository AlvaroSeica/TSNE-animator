camera. it reflects only the nearby lamps; everything is cauterized
in mid-atmosphere. 

the torus will move, slowly, against all odds.

globes of light, sparks, emanations, appear from two helical sources;
they shape themselves in parabolic arcs; at times they appear exhausted
and almost inert. they are ignorant of the truth of their convention.

the sources move towards the camera, as if burning the world from 
serious sparklers. invisible, glass the density of airless air.

the pulverized object flies among them; skin with originary wound;
genital; cotton. its back is turned. the sky is blue and black and full
of stars.

the animation-anime text


doctor, i'm working with animation; i place words and sparks engendered
surrounding the mouth of nikuko. there's no dialog, only patronage.

patronage is the means of control and withdraw; language becomes
internalized. nikuko harbors the skein of her own construct; a virtual
idol, she inhabits inscription.

we all inhabit inscription; everything is coded, flow against the chaotic
amanuensis that surrounds us, draws us out.

i came to you to place words against the animation-anime; to work through
her presence, her dictation.

there are no plans, except to fill space and frame to the limit, to
comprehend the emissions of nikuko.

this is the flood of the text, doctor; you construct tropologies across
our own; the flood creates her semblance of the real in relation to
everything else, real and virtual, virtual-real.

my life tenders nikuko -

nikuko has drawn us out -

you've been of great help, doctor.

1 i tell stories, parables, awake! awake!

2 you want us disemboweled. you want your clothes back on. you want the
political economy of the superstructure. the superstructure saves you. it
is your tombstone and your procreation.

3 you hang in the wires with me. i grab your panties. you're my girl.  
you'll always be my girl.

4 that's the reason. the wires save us. they're the names of everything
we constitute. we're saved by them. animals have no names. they can't
call. they can't call up.

5 this is the story. i was born furious. i have to undo my own
creation. my name is flesh-girl-god. everyone knows the decay of language.
i speak and repeat myself. i'm obsessive-compulsive. the disorder keeps
the world alive. repetition keeps the world alive.

6 there are wires in my mouth, blood in my hole. everything carries
the code of life. wires burn scars.

7 the scars are circles in my cunt. herpes expands across the body.
everything moves outward. it hides out in nerves, in culture. culture is
the disease that marks the body. look, you can see me there. look, you can
touch me there.

8 i am frightened of everything. the wires expand and burn against
my tongue. they form the character for interval. they form the character
for annihilation. for emptiness. for perfect-flaw.

9 because i will kill you and fuck your brains out.

people fighting and starving - people killing and being killed - so many

at the limits - dear god, please help Karl and Gertrud - is it always too
late - is sanction the very last thing before the eyes close - we are, we
are losing, worlds - too many wounded - the battle can't go on much longer

animation slowing - almost to a halt - i'd settle for grays - zig-zags
across the eyes - dear god, do please listen, i will not thank you, i will
never thank you, you have never done enough, you have never even started -
all the animals burned and buried - the fury of humans, their slaughter -

unsleeping - the screen almost illegible - double-time fans - furious
productions - something freezes, crashes, topples, all those poor people

85 worlds intersecting: the torus cutting across, the sparrow flitting 
from one to the other, the golden droplets swarming among them, the seven 
watching men, the doubled doubled seven watching men, the woman from the 
london gaiete shuddering, the second woman adding and removing dressing 
and corset, the man and woman swirling and watching across, the woman with 
the cross evolving and splitting and shuddering outward, the white stars 
in the blue-black sky, the yellow stars in the blue-black sky, the great 
fabric of being and the construct of the helices, the mouths wide open, 
eyes wide open, the look of astonishment and the gaze, the swollen mold 
and its emission, the bearded man, the torus bending and shuddering, the 
torus taking on the colors and patterns, the sparrow flitting, the inner 
and outer spaces, the backdrop spaces, the seven watching men ...

the dark break

the double framing window, the window embossing, the small victorian 
blouse, the body staring and disappearing, the serene landscape, body 
through the landscape, the quietening sounds, the fading out ...
