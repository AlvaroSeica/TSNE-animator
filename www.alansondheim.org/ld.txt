What is to Be Done?


Report: I'm alive and well in Traveller's Linux; I have left Vienna.
Report: I'm in on Vienna Traveller's Linux. I am told I am paranoid.
Communique: My name is Vladimir Lenin. I am in Edit, Austria.
Communique: Hello out there. I am cut off.
Communique: The best Jews, those who are celebrated in world history,
and have given the world foremost leaders of democracy and socialism,
have never clamoured against assimilation.
Report: I'm alive and well; there are no Jews in Traveller's Linux.
Report: The conclusion which follows from this is absolute intcontro-
vertible: it has been proved that, far from causing harm to the revo-
lutionary proletariat, participation in a bourgeois-democratic parli-
ament, even a few weeks before the victory of a Soviet republic and
even _after_ such a victory, actually helps that proletariat to
_prove_ to the backward masses why such parliaments deserve to be
Communique: I am not paranoid; I have been told I am not paranoid.
Communique: I am at Row: 00017 and Column: 00048.
Report: This is coming to you from Traveller's Linux.
Communique to A. V. Lunacharsky: Aren't you ashsmed to vote for pub-
lication of Mayakovasky's _150 Millions_ in five thousand copies?
Rubbish, stupidity, double-dyed stupidity and pretentiousness. In my
opinion we should print only one out of ten such things, and _not 
more than fifteen hundred copies,_ for libraries and odd people. And
flog Lunarcharsky for futurism.
Report: Hello? Radio Traveller's Linux here. I AM NOT PARANOID!
Communique: What column is this? Column 00045.
Communique: I am seventy-eight years old.
Communique: Youth's altered attitude to questions of sex is of 
course 'fundamental' and based on theory. Many people call it revo-
lutionary' and 'communist.' They sincerely believe that this is so. 
I am an old man and I do not like it. I may be a morose ascetic, but
quite often this so-called 'new sex life' of young people -- and fre-
quently of the adults too -- seems to me purely bourgeois and simply
an extension of the good old bourgeois brothel. All this has nothing
in common with free love as we Communists understand it.
Report: I am certainly not in favor of this or that!
Report: I do not smoke a bourgeois so-called cigarette!
Communique: The whole of society will have become a single office 
and a single factory, with equality of labor and pay.
Communique: The second condition is agreement between the proletari-
at, which is exercising its dictatorship, that is, holds state power,
and the majority of the peasant population.
Report: I do not agree with those of the dictatorship who accuse me
of paranoia, although I have been committed of paranoia by the so-
called 'state authorities.' I do not smoke a cigarette, a victim of
the bourgeois mind!
Communique: I am in Traveller's Linux! I am in the root directory! 
No one else is here beside me! No one else is toppling this machine
constructed of the finest materials! I am using this machine! This
will have been Column 15! This will have been Row 50! I am in Aus-
tria, but I am not in Vienna! I have never been in Vienna! This is a
hope of bourgeois freedom!
Report: The government of the proletarian dictatorship -- jointly 
with the Communist Party and the trade unions of course -- makes ev-
ery effort to overcome the backward views of men and women and thus
uproot the old, non-commmunist psychology. It goes without saying
that men and women are absolutely equal before the law.
Communique: My name is Vladimir Lenin. You had the rudness to call
my wife on the telephone and berate her.
Report: It sounds just as though he were chewing rags in his sleep!
Report: One cannot hide the fact that dictatorship presupposes and
implies a "condition," one so disagreeable to renegades, of _revolu-
tionary violence_ of one class against another.
Report: We must see to it that every factory and every electric pow-
er station becomes a centre of enlightenment; if Russia is covered
with a dense network of electric power stations and powerful techni-
cal installations, our communist economic development will become a
model for a future socialist Europe and Asia.
Communique: I am on previous Row 69 of this Report and Communique.
Communique: I am not paranoid -- only to approach the government of 
the revolutionary proletarian dictatorship, is it not within the 
purview of any sane man to wonder at the absence of individuals 
within this dense network, given the absence, in other words, of any
other within Traveller's Linux? This is the Communique of Vladimir
Lenin, having been declared paranoid by the state. Toe.
Report: This ends the Communique of Vladimir Lenin, having been de-
clared paranoid by the state. Toe.
Communique: I have been declared paranoid by the state. I am not de-
clared paranoid by the state. Toe.

Found transcript tape 1 of VL in tomb between left arm and abdomen, skin
sloughed averaging .3 millimeter flush with plastic case membrane. Nothing
else audible; layers had to be separated from seeped lenin-fluid, alcohol,
other embalming agents, recovered fragments of lenin-dna. Lenin had been
using a root-booting portable linux system at the time. No further infor-
mation available.

Match-Girl Time (Jennifer)


  Good and bad luck depend on money. It is a power in the _bourgeois_
period for this reason, that is only wooed on all hands like a girl,
indissolubly wedded by nobody. All the romance and chivalry of _wooing_
for a dear object come to life again in competition. Money, an object of
longing, is carried off by the bold "knights of industry."

  He who has luck takes home the bride. The ragamuffin has luck; he takes
her into his household, "society," and destroys the virgin. In his house
she is no longer bride, but wife; and with her virginity her family name
is also lost. As housewife the maiden Money is called "Labor," for "Labor"
is her husband's name. She is a possession of her husband's.

  To bring this figure to an end, the child of Labor and Money is again a
girl, an unwedded one and therefore Money, but with the certain descent
from Labor, her father. The form of the face, the "effigy," bears another
stamp.

(Max Stirner, The Ego and His Own)


  Who could not want to see my tiny naked limbs through my torn ragamuffin
dress? What a delight it would be to sell myself a destroyed virgin, for
any Man who would take me! More than anything, I want to be possessed,
these poor rags ripped from my girl's pubescent body, to the delight of
the bourgeois, both male and female! To display myself and gain income at
once is my fondest ambition; I am yours for the Labor and Lucre.

deaths in storms


i am afraid of death; it haunts me, has haunted me for years; i'm not af-
raid of taking my own life, not at all--but of death this great fear, this
fear so great i cannot write coherently about it, cannot add polish to the
style; it takes me over in the form of nightmares; i have only two decades
left to live, watching my mind deteriorate; i am hysterically fearful of
being left behind; i want to see more of the world--it's not the pain but
the absence, knowing the last gesture; this isn't an emotion but a synd-
rome as death watches me; i've been miserably unhappy all my life as a re-
sult; i'm a coward, i can't think straight; i'm violently afraid of viol-
ence, of the pain of violence; i don't know a moment's peace; it's a
struggle to breathe in the morning; i get repeated headaches; i feel unut-
terable loss constantly; my life is filled with regrets as far back as i
can remember; i'm suspicious of momentary happiness; i see nothing but the
gateway to annihilation; my writing is underpinned by decay and disappear-
ance; i rage against acquiescence; i have no belief in reincarnation or
afterlife; absence characterizes existence, stains it; i try through sexu-
al abjection to forget myself, bury myself first; i have no stake in my
death--no one does; it is a great vacuum tearing me apart; it grabs my
mind, my brain, creates fevers; it controls my words as i write them, as
if there were bones clawing and severing the fingers of my hands; dreams
carry on where daylight leaves off; daylight reconfirms the worst of the
horrors; this is my ordinary existence; there is no answer to anything but
the simplest of questions--daily, i face my own failure in this regard--
knowing that i am an imposter, waiting to be found out; i see others more
or less calm, there's no calm for me; my dreams have severed limbs, storms
and tornados, buildings toppled, buses veering off wet cliffs down to the
shore rocks below--drowning, i try to claw my way out, the water's too
great, i can't breathe, the inconsolable wetness of lungs, everything com-
ing to an end, we're upside-down; i'm a coward, i've always been a coward;
i'm afraid of the tiniest thing, storms get to me; i pretend to be brave,
that's all, it's easy in safe situations; the storm--not the storm really,
the careening bus, it's the bus that brings it to the surface as it crash-
es down, coming to pieces on the rocks, ending in deep water, above the
roof, it's all turned awry, you can't tell left from right, up from down,
i'm drowning again, it's all this repetition; i'm feverish, can hardly see
the world, whatever's churning

Some people really can't read about the problems others are having; for
others, including myself, it's healing, knowing there are other people
who feel like I do, that I may be crazy, but there are other crazies out
there and maybe we aren't that crazy after all. 

But sometimes as well people attack me for how I feel. I mean, how could
I be attacked, I'm just expressing myself, what I'm going through. I 
don't want to lay it on anyone else, I just want to be understood. I
don't even want sympathy, just maybe there would be someone reading what
I have to say who could understand me or help.

Very briefly, if it wasn't for these people on line, I would kill myself
a long time ago. These have been the people who have helped me when my
friends haven't wanted to even hear anything about me.

What do I have to do, have a crisis before anyone listens to me? I'm 30
yrs. old and I've supported myself since I was 15. I know how to get 
around but believe me, it's not been easy. And if I speak about malaise
or something that's not all that interesting, I mean how much of this
stuff really IS interesting, then no one wants to hear me.

Now at least I can say how I feel. Before I could never talk to anyone.
Now I have someone who will listen to me when I express my rage, when I
want to kill myself. I know I will be a better person. It is enough that
they listen, they don't have to say anything. My computer has become my
best friend.

I've learned that I can discuss things better with you online than I can
with my doctor, and I know now who to avoid when I need to look for a 
doctor. It has been very painful; it has been the most painful period of
my life and being on line has saved me time and again.

For once I could talk to my doctor and tell her that the medication was
not working, that it might have been a placebo for all I know. I said I
wanted to try something else, that I had the support of the online commu-
nity. I said nothing else mattered, my whole world gets caught up in this
or that medication and I know there is more to life than that.

Before, I was always taken by surprised; now I know when things are going
to get bad way ahead of time, and I can look for help from my doctor or
from online, and online people seem much more willing to listen.

Sometimes I'll feel so down, I could almost break things. Then to listen
online to people talking, I mean what they say to each other, how they
relate, sometimes it's really funny, and that helps a lot. I never thought
I could laugh so much from things coming over the screen but that's how
it is.

It is so spiritual to read these disembodied voices who never judge me,
and I know in real life they never would...

There are people out there in this town who could really benefit from all
this on line, they would learn how to better control themselves. I think
so many people in this culture are hurting or wrecked, I don't know where
it's all coming from, things are changing so fast, for everyone. I'm only
seventeen and I can hardly handle my life anymore, things going so fast
before my eyes, but when I get online I can really concentrate and slow
things down and learn to speak and think for myself.

You know, my daughter wouldn't talk to anyone, and we were both going
through a lot and it was coming on line that gave us the courage to speak,
first to others, and then to ourselves. It was so strange, we began by 
writing back and forth, honestly trying to deal with our feelings, even
though we were living in the same house. I think things like this are 
somehow more natural than being off line and walking warily around the
place, all of us fearful to speak to one another, we've got all those
defenses from being in the same place together too long.

Now this is what I have to say, don't use this as a crutch. If you do, 
what will you do when y2k comes along or your computer goes? It's a lot
more delicate than a friend, you have to know that. It's not a friend at
all, it's machinery that brings you voices that help you and console you
from time to time. But you can't count on it. I wouldn't count on it at
all.

This has replaced drugs of any sort for me; you can't believe what I was
like at one time. I couldn't even sit down without shuddering. Now I have
the time to even be with my parents a little, we're beginning to under-
stand each other. But it's because of this screen, nothing else. And they
know that. Someday maybe I can put this aside, but not for a long long 
time.

The Can't


Old Clar agrees with everyone. Old Clar tries to make everyone happy.
Please be happy, she says, be happy for me. She says, I can talk to you
and I can't talk to anyone else. She says I've been drinking a lot but
it's not working any more. I don't know what's the matter with me. I just
start crying sometimes. She's got long blond hair and beautiful blue eyes,
the widest eyes you've ever seen. She says, I've been through things you
wouldn't believe. There are bruises on her body.

New Clar says the sky is so blue and true. She applauds herself, and walks
away and turns around and comes back. She says she can't take Old Clar any
more, it's all the same sort of thing, her going on and on and on. She's
older than Old Clar, who is twenty-six, whose beautiful legs and shoulders
are scratched. Old Clar says she's tried pills, she once tried to hang
herself. I couldn't do it, she says, the rope broke. I didn't have the
guts to try again. Oh God ... She stops and cries, her eyes are swollen. 

Old Clar hangs her head, she's ashamed. I know I'm as good as you, she
says, but I now I'm not. I'm not as good as anyone. Oh fuck, I can't stand
this. She's scratching herself, cutting through her skin; you can see her
bleeding through her tattered clothes. I've got a secret, she says, I
can't tell anyone, how good I am, what a person I am. People say I'm beau-
tiful, but they don't know the inside; they'd run and hide if they did.
She raises her eyebrows, as if in some kind of wonder.

New Clar doesn't show her emotions in public. She's taken for flowery and
tough at the same time. New Clar doesn't understand a thing, Old Clar
thinks, how could she. She couldn't possibly know the pain I've been
through. She says that a lot. She wants to take pills, listen to me, she
says, you're the only one I can talk to. You believe in me, no one else
does, not even me. I'm not joking about this, this isn't one of those dumb
novels, this is for real. 

Old Clar cries half in sadness and mourning, half in pure exhaustion. She
cries that she needs comfort and consolation, why won't everyone be quiet
just for a little while. She has utter rapture on her face, the rapture of
pure despair. I'm fucking afraid of dying, and yet I want to kill myself,
can you beat that?

Oh God, this is boring, boring, boring, I can't help myself. What differ-
ence does any of it make? I'm no concern of anyone's, I'm no concern of
yours. She disagrees with everyone, she knows it. New Clar dances around,
her lips parted. Old Clar pays no attention, she's got a horrifying pre-
monition about the death of everyone. We're all going to die a horrible
death, she says, and soon. I bet you already know this. You're so damn
smart. Oh hell, she wants another drink, just one more, fuck, things can
only get better, can't they? She's scratched open sores around her
breasts, you can see them through her ripped clothing, they're bleeding.
Oh hell, pay no attention to me.

Old Clar dreams badly at night visions of great intensity. New Clar is
sometimes with her in her thoughts. She looks at New Clar warily, she eyes
her warily. She's afraid, I'm afraid of everyone, I know you're probably
mocking me right now, for God's sakes. I'd like some pills, just some, you
know I'd take them just like that, isn't it amazing, I'm scared like hell
of death but I'd kill myself in a second, right now, right before you, if
I just had something to take. Please, come to think of it, maybe you can
help me.

Fuck, I just want to fly away. New Clar is giggling loudly, she's almost
embarrassing, I don't know why, Old Clar says, gasping. I'll never forget
it, stop it now, she says, New Clar continuing. Please, please, Old Clar
is really crying now, harder than before, there are bits of skin under her
fingernails. She moves quietly, hugging herself with a warmth rarely felt,
for a second she feels wonderful. It's such a sweetness, she sighs.

Old Clar says, I make everyone nervous. Maybe I'm psychotic, God, I can't
even spell the word. New Clar is jumping around, trips on herself, falls.
Old Clar says sometimes I want everyone to take me, just like in the
movies or some bad novel, I know I couldn't really do it, I just mean, I
mean it would be a way to get lost, you know, like drugs, just not enough
to kill you. Things can't get any worse, can they? She's made a sore on
her forehead, her fingers moving feverishly back and forth.

No one feels safe around me, she says. She wants to kiss, so sweetly and
warmly that she'll forget herself, hold her breath. Are you laughing at
me, she says, shuddering. Or with me, maybe with me? She looks up, her
beautiful blue eyes full of tears. New Clar is happy she's alive; Old Clar
couldn't care less. Old Clar loves everyone with a transcendence found in
mountains and valleys, looking down the rivers, looking up the peaks. It's
a wonderful time for some people, she shrugs, just not for me. I need you
to listen to me, you're the only one who can understand me.

I know I'm boring you; I can't help it. It's not funny, it's real life,
for God's sakes pay attention to me, oh God, please, please, please don't
leave me like this, please help me, honest, I'll kill myself if you don't,
I'm not kidding. This isn't some stupid joke. She's moaning now, New Clar
smiling oddly, Old Clar shaking uncontrollably. I must sound sad to you,
she says, it's unbelievable. New Clar doesn't respond with warmth and
embracing sympathy. Old Clar sighs, her body's ravaged. She says, she
thinks I'm passive aggressive, I'm not. New Clar is dancing furiously in a
warm and passionate embrace. Old Clar shudders, everything is repetition,
she says, I guess you've hold this before, at least not from me.

She says, why don't you give me some pills and just get it over with, once
and for all, that's all it would take. New Clar is smiling with a beauti-
ful twinkle in her eyes, stretching and yawning. Old Clar touches herself,
almost tenderly, grabs her skin, tears at it. I can't do anything any
more, she says, wiping her eyes, I'm crying all the time now, I don't seem
to be able to stop. New Clar is involved in her own pleasure. She yells at
Old Clar and immediately regrets it. Old Clar keeps her voice down. I'm
boring, she whispers, boring boring boring. This is real life, this isn't
funny any more. I don't know what I'm going to do. Next time you see me I
may be dead, she says with a warm and loving tone. 

Oh fuck, don't leave me like this, please, please. Please don't, oh fuck,
please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for everything, please. Her skin's a mess,
her chest's in ribbons. Oh God, forgive me, she says, I can't stand this
any longer. I can't, I just can't.

Lauren


I've got a hole for you. I want to put it in everywhere. I dream of need-
les, do you know that? There are tracks all over me, not just my arms. You
might think I'd know better, but I like them. They scar me, show you where
I've been.

I love wearing my flaws. You can see right through me but I know it and
that's more than a lot of people know.

/* but begging. but really wanting it. but wanting nothing more than it.
but wanting it more than anything in his life. but dreaming and living the
wanting of it. but unable to sleep for the wanting of it. but unable to
drink for the wanting of it. unable to eat for it. but doing only the
wanting of it. but others. but others noting wasting away, others wasting
away. her for the wanting of it. unable to work, this writing for the
wanting, speaking for the wanting. the boring of others, boring others.
for the desire, for the wanting of it. the hunger the thirst of it. the
exhaustion of it. the drug the addiction the obsession the compulsion of
it. the drive the instinct of it. for the wanting of it. his for the
wanting. want her. */

Do I want it, do I need it? Of course I need it. Everything's so simple
and as Lauren said, if you don't know how terrific heroin can be you don't
know anything.

It's all about your knowledge, not mine.

But I don't need all that much else, you know. And that's way ahead of you
and most other people. It drives things towards a point and that point can
be a good time. No one even thinks about good times any more. You have to
take a breath to do that. I hold my breath when I shoot up. Like you can
have it.

It's not just that though. I've got better friends than you ever will.
They'll all betray me in the end. But there's a pull in the world, I seem
to be the only one that understands that. Again it's the knowledge thing -
only an addict has knowledge of any sort. Once you understand that, you
might understand everything, but you're still not smart.

I'm always thinking below the surface. I have enough money to buy the
stuff so it's never a question, say, of Lauren out on the streets looking
for it. It's right there, in the cabinet; I can get it when I need it. The
need is good, it's easy to fulfill - just like that. Teleology grinds to a
halt several times a day, with a kick.

Some people find this stuff false, a false kick. But if the receptors are
there, if it works, what's the problem? It's nature finding nature, desire
fulfilled as I said. And the knowledge is incredible. I can see the sky!

Was it Odin, now it's me, sacrificing myself to myself? It's that, what I
can do, what I can achieve, look, I can't run a mile or climb a mountain,
but I can learn from this stuff, you wouldn't believe it. And what I've
learned doesn't fit in any books.

It's strange also because we're all addicts of course, just some of you
haven't found your thing. It's like a lure or teleology that insists on
being just out of reach, carrot on a stick kind of thing, and so you rant
uselessly, run around uselessly, as if this and that make a difference.
But difference only comes from One minus Zero so to speak, and the One can
be heroin, and the Zero can be the rest of the world, everything else. 

Why do they call it substance abuse? It's the enhancement of substance,
the real recognition of the power inherent in things. And the self comes
to fruition around this. I know that, I can feel it in my bones, my soul.
These substances were made for a reason. And there's the physical effect
and the mental effect, and different sorts of addictions all over the
place. But it's worth it for the physical effect. If you're set up, like I
am.

What you're looking at is a habit. I'm a habit, even to myself I'm a hab-
it. That makes me simple and likeable. People understand all my surfaces;
they can't touch anything else but that. And I can fashion them, polish
them - I can shine like a star anytime I want.

I love feeling the hunger, love wanting it. It's like computers, but I
don't have to deal with other people and their desires. Call it modernism
against your postmodernism, or the self against alterity; the drug's not
alter at all, it's heroin my lover, it's heroin my best friend. And the
wonder and knowledge of that is unbelievable.

Do you know I can sing? You've probably never heard me sing. Someday I'll
sing for you, even now. You can stand a little? You might like this.
There's a record I use for background, like karaoke. Just a second. Let me
know what you think.

From the Backbone of Now to the Backbone of a Long Time Ago


Close the eyes and god goes away, I think it's a terrific deal.
Tue Sep 28 18:58:10 EDT 1999 is not the time now, for example; god
wouldn't let me enter the time now but did let me enter this old time.
I like the old time. I like thinking about the old time. God lets me do
that, god is pretty terrific, is a good god. 
I want to sleep now.
Management has taken care of everything; god is a voice-over. 
A voice-over, and that makes it
all right, saying the date and time from the past, crying over 
that Tue Sep 28 18:58:10 EDT 1999, which won't come
again.

Example of Fractal Ordering of Ruler Series (plus notes)


1: The _division property_ - every nth term in order from the beginning
reproduces the series or its inversion.

2: The _insertion property_ - consider an alternation between f and g;
start with a seed such as g; surround it by f: fgf, insert and surround by
g: gfgggfg, etc. - the series and its inverse are produced.

3: Concatenation property: Begin with seed gf; start from the left. Subs-
titute gggf for g and gfgf for f. Add the substitutions in order on the
right. Take each term in order. The series is produced. Or: begin with g,
take seed f; substitute gg for f, gf for g. The series is produced.

4. For the zth term let m equal the largest integer such that z/2expm =
integer. Then the term is g if m is even, f if m is odd.

There are other formulations and extensions; I've worked with this series
for years, on and off. Now I think of it in terms of ordered linkages,
equivalences, and identities. If one has all terms, say, g, then one has a
number system to the base 1, i.e. g, gg, ggg, gggg, etc. Consider g -> gg
as Quine's n' operation. One might also use terms fgh, etc. 

The inversion of the series, i.e. fgfffgfgfgfff etc., is equivalent to the
series to the extent that the structure is based on a primary differntia-
tion |f-g| = |g-f|.

The series, by the division property, is extraordinarily ordered, even
more say than, say, simple alternation fgfgfg - where the division proper-
ty breaks down. If alternations are considered fff, fgfg, fghfgh, etc.
then it's clear that g gg ggg gggg etc. represents the substance or null
point of both series.

Note by substitution these are not couplings; an error anywhere in the
terms will most likely propagate (by virtue of substitution construction).

So there are these relations: The calculus in Spencer Brown's Laws of
Form; the halfgroupoid analyses in R. Hubert Bruck's A Survey of Binary
Systems; materials such as the Sheffer stroke and its dual in relation to
the propositional calculus (see also Wittgenstein's Tractatus and its
mathematics); my own 'loosenings' of couplings and linkages and for that
matter the formalism in my Structure of Reality (related to dynamic net-
works such as Petrie nets); and these ordered strings related to ruler
topologies.

All of which tends towards a metaphysics of mathematics, or at least a
metaphysical mathesis that must (I think) be resisted. On the other hand,
there are useful metaphors (the dual of the Sheffer stroke as expulsion)
and phenomenologies (difference between couplings and linkages) that may
be of use thinking through (again for example) such things as classical
causality; the foreclosings of bodies and worlds in a classical/modernist
context in relation to virtual subjectivities; and postmodern geographies
in general.

Finally, the ruler series is of great use, at least for me, in thinking
through the related phenomenologies of _substance, order, thing, entity,
extension, difference, and chain, etc._

Note in the example below of period 64, each line is identical except for
the last symbol - and the _column_ of last symbols recapitulates the or-
derings within the _rows._

Fundamental Systems (Was: Couplings and Linkages) {file:zz}

N a azure fbw julu kdate lisp lynx_bookmarks.html mail minicom.log newju
nsmail trace z.gif zz
Let's say there is a binary structure, consisting of an operation N such
that N(a,b) -> a relationship between a, b. Say that a, b are terms which
stand for sets of identical members, as far as the structure is concerned
- i.e. a = {x:x = a} & b = {y:y = b}. Note that x and y can be anything;
the terms are dummy. The structure is then S = (N,a,b). 

Then we may be concerned with the _phenomenology_ of S, thinking through
the semantics of (a,b) in relation to the framework N. It is irrelevant
for example that if N = +, we might have +(4,3) = 7. We are not interes-
ted in constructing a result c - only that a relationship between a and b
is established.

For example, N = + resulting into the terms coalesced beneath the sign of
addition; N = red resulting into equivalence; N = identity producing the
singularity of a and b; N = existing at time t(N) resulting in a foreclos-
ing or frameworking of a and b; and so forth. We can have a linkage such
that if a or be is eliminated, so is the other; we can have a coupling
such that if a or b are both on a shelf, taking either off has no effect
on the other.

Then I may attempt to produce a metaphysics of such a system - or rather
to forestall the production of such a metaphysics, deconstructing the
framework of any metaphysics vis-a-vis the system. Or rather, I can argue
towards a metaphoricity of relationship (linkage, coupling, etc.), reify-
ing the terms and placing them within a matrix of parallelisms. Such a
metaphoricity can also be used to similarly deconstruct parallelisms.

But to _believe_ in such metaphoricities or metaphysics as _fundamental_
is also to create a work of astonishing coherency, the real beneath the
sign of relation and its deconstruction. For example, think of a _basic
property of things_ - that they are linked or coupled or decoupled. This
strategy tends towards one or another universal exegesis.

Instead, I see N(a,b) as particulate matter - for example, N(a,a) can be a
harbinger of substance if N implies augmentation such that N(a,a) =
N(a,a,a) and so forth. This is an _unfolding of the frame_ or the cinema-
tic real.

Just so, the simplest number system is to the base 1: 1, 11, 111, etc. -
and the most extravagant is to the base of an inaccessibly high number
such that every numerical representation is uniquely identified by a unary
ideogram, shades of Borges for example.

These are all fragments of the imaginary - and it is _critical_ to under-
stand this; they are part-objects, imminent within the real of the subject
and never immanent; their transcendence lies in the inauthenticity of
their simplicity, as if they were fundamental. Here is where the astonish-
ing work of coherency comes into play: consider that they are _not_ funda-
mental, that on the level of the life-world, _almost_ all the way up or
down, there is no fundamentality at all: as if the grounds of the real
themselves were decoupled "for all practical purposes."

Suppose for example, the complexity of the universe all the way down, dri-
ven by higher and higher energies, resulting in more and more basic parti-
cles: One might well say that the complexity of the universe is the direct
result of the energy used to examine it. As a corollary, from Brillouin to
some extent: the complexity of the universe is then in direct proportion
to the capital (economic/industrial/theoretical) used in such an examina-
tion. In such a manner, the _order_ of the world is in direct relation to
the social organization and its surplus, of a given civilization.

One may talk of the mirroring of the world, and note again the apparent
increasingly complexity of the mathematics and mathesis required in the
ongoing progress and investigation of the physics of the real, on _any_
level from the sub-particle to the overall cosmos, and their conjoining.

To retreat to the binary is to conjure the dream of rendering the literal
book of nature accessible - to create a stasis in modelling in the midst
of universal transformation. One might speak again of Foucault's _divina-
tio,_ a dream of a book of nature, augmented by a dream of universal rea-
son.

On the other hand, such a retreat is also the catalyst for a major publi-
cation; the real is revealed in all its coherency, and the world-system,
as reproduced, is an occasion for both foreclosing and framework - now,
not only of a and b, but also of a scope expanded to fulfill the promise,
virtue, and style of the world. This is a wonder, and I oscillate between
hope for a primal leverage, absolute signifiers (which also seem of nec-
essity to be restatements of universal law on the level of micro-physics),
and a dull recognition of the increasing fragmentation of the life-worlds
on the planet - almost as if the world were nothing more than Markov-
chains of shorter and shorter length.

The specifics of the leverage would not matter - just as the details of
universal equations spell out varying phenomenologies, but their very
transcendence is a symptom of overt organization, and deity for some. The
universal cosmic phenomenon of peering into the past (objects so distant
that it may take a billion years for light to reach us, objects otherwise
ungraspable) may be taken to imply radical disconnects, signals from what
appear to be disconsolate objects, expiring objects, objects at a loss in
relation to the human flicker on earth. And radical disconnects fragment
our own relation to the real as well; hence, the imaginary or that proble-
matic which resists symbolization. Connect such symbolization vis-a-vis
metaphor with the body (Lakoff), and "graspable" becomes, itself, a rela-
tion between model and modeller: Our world is deeply ungraspable, our im-
ages universally mediated, determined at least in part by economics, ener-
gies, and the exigencies of the viewing apparati themselves.

We are left with a partial _log_ of a continuous conversation, replete
with expanding knowledges, finer and finer tolerances - but a conversation
nonetheless, of fragments, micro-exhaustions (Stent's analyses of the
field of trignometry for example), and increasingly complex equations or
metaphysics. Driven by energy and economics, there is no end in sight;
what may eventually stare back at us through scientific exploration is
ourselves, our machinery. Heisenberg was only the first crack in the mir-
ror in this literal regard; what is impossible in fine-tuning position and
momentum is also metaphor for the fine-tuning of existence itself. For it
is not unreasonable to assume that higher energies propose newer partic-
les, linked in groupings, the end nowhere in sight. As far as binary oper-
ations per se, they remain within the imaginary of the dream and the dream
of the imaginary; they hold us in our fundamentally Aristotelian world, in
which the laws of distribution hold, and within which we may fall in love,
throw a ball, or speak, as if difference were upheld, or shattered.

In INDIANA it was recently VOTED that ALL RAILROAD TRAINS and ALL
TELEPHONE POLES and SOME BUILDINGS will be PLACED ON THEIR SIDES
permanently. Thus the TRAINS have their WHEELS by convention on 
THEIR RIGHT-HAND-SIDE, against thin RAILS held VERTICALLY into
PLACE. Furthermore, SMALL CARRIAGES POSSESSING WHEELS are permit-
ted BENEATH THE SIDEWAYS CARS AND ENGINES to enable them to MOVE
ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE in SUCH A CONDITION.

THE SAME does NOT hold true for ALL BUILDINGS but SOME BUILDINGS,
which, on their SIDE, may have BOTH WINDOWS AND DOORS OPENING IN-
TO THE EARTH BELOW, as well as OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS OPENING
ONTO THE SKY ABOVE, as well as STILL OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS OP-
EN ON TWO SIDES for EASY EGRESS AND EXIT, as well as ENTRANCE.

As for the TELEPHONE POLES, ALL OF WHICH are ON THEIR SIDES, 
there should be PLACED UPON THEM, WARNINGS FOR CHLDREN, AGAINST
the TOUCHING of such wires AS THEY NOW CARRY, EASILY LAID UPON
THE EARTH.

Outtages MAY OCCUR.

Writing Despair 


( Notes for the Chat Conference October 3 on trAce at 7:00 am and 4:00 pm
New York time at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk )

" How do we write about despair, without despairing ourselves? How do we
write in the face of despair? What are the possibilities of writing in the
face of death or turmoil? How does the writer live? "

In despair the body is simultaneously ignored (I am a throwaway, I have
nothing to say) and at risk (eliminate this body, this body is a sign of
life). Writing despair writes around the body, a form of circumscription;
body and death can never be fully addressed, since they are necessarily
absent from the writing and its production. I write and read elsewhere
than the body; I produce outside of death. 

Death and body are symptoms of the limits of the text.

So to write (what may be) the last breath: to write with urgency. To write
with a clearing of history, of fields. To write the final revelation -
this is what I have always meant to say, this is what I have not been able
to say. 

But to write above or beyond despair - to foreclose despair, not with the
text or therapeutic, but as an object, a thing, which permits boundaries -
"here I am writing about the thing, despair."

To write the worst truth you can about yourself - no one can go farther -
no one can say worse. (To write yourself out of existence which is as well
to write yourself into existence.)

To write your own death warrant, also your pardon.

The same applies to the book, that other thing, that object, which replac-
es despair. One might think of both as partial-objects, between full and
replete growth of the self within the world, and absolute loss or loss 
within the "maternal matrix" - book and despair as shimmering objects of
foreclosing (we're finished with the world) and communication (these are
the feelings that have been shunted, that want expressing)...

From the diary.txt at trAce:


Today is the early morning of the fourth; I've been sick, feverish, and
sleeping on and off, ran the early morning chat session on writing and
despair and came back for half of the second - both were really rewarding
- it's something I like doing. I'd taken notes ahead of time, so I had
material to work with; these are issues that concern me, through Duras,
Kristeva, other depressives - I'd even put Nietzsche in there through a
false diagnosis on my part. 

I'm reading Saving the Text, Literature/Derrida/Philosophy by Geoffrey
Hartman - I'd owned this book before, now have it again. Some of the intro
is really relevant to my own work: "But what can it mean to place mind on
its own axis and free it from books - to make mind its own text, as it
were? Can we transcend telling toward, more simply, showing? Would that
bring about (as both Husserl and Wittgenstein once hoped) a return to
things themselves? Yet does not the very existence of words indicate a
breach with the phenomenality of things, or with an ideal of showing, of
evidentiality, taken from that sphere?"

This also for me references Barthes' punctum or the grain of the voice;
it's far too easy to forget in cyberspace-hypertext that there are things
in the world, that a call of twentieth-century poetics has been towards
the bypassing of language, "back to the things themselves." My own work in
that regard is already _past the ruin_ - it tends towards or beyond a rec-
ognition that _things_ are always already lost; we're no longer innocent
but caught within the skein of the symbolic. Which leads me towards a
certain extremism in the text - what else is there to do - what else can
be done - in order to return (as if there were a return; as if it were
possible; as if it were possible without a politics) to a real of femini-
sm, chora (in the Kristevan sense), discomfort, and _presence._ One might
ask: _Where is presence on the Net?_ - refusing all answers, taking no
easy way out...

Japan, Land of the Cherry-Blossom
Japanese Wonders and Beauties

on the night of the interior forlorn, i have never finished with japan,
it's an open wound, a space in consciousness, a flood, olden days in
japan, images impenetrable, the gulf absolute, the rupture, and division
of new and old, division of here and there

it's what i remember, every detail of the 7-11 store-shelves, walking be-
hind hakozaki shrine, details which reappear in dreams, the second-hand
shop on the corner and its shogi sets, more and more lists, the children
staring at me yelling back 'baka baka'

Ghosts and Tales in Old Japan
Japanese Hobgoblins
Tengu? No Thank you! In Old Japan
Japan through Sumo
Life and Loves of the Ancient Japanese
Oh! Japan!

i can't assimilate the transformation, the kanji disappeared, certain
paintings, glances, edges of things, always felt myself at odds with each
and every gaijin, o third country of the spirit, it's what i remember, i'm
dreadfully afraid of reconstitution, making it up as i go along, the
things themselves retreated into algorithms for reconstruction, right or
wrong, 'my japanese days,' 'my time in japan,' as well as more personal
material intertwined, inseparable, confusioned, contusion

Representation and Misrecognition in Old Japan
Multicultural Exegesis in Genji's Heian Japan
The Presuppositions of the Myth of Japanese Homogeneity

haunted with an incontrovertible knot set in my maw my brainstem my hole,
kabuki samurai misrecognitions, never made it to the theater, parks wet
with leaves, moats, stone stupas, my gaijin head smashed among them as i
leapt out of the country of noh truth as literal as possible

cancer
 
Tue Oct  5 22:14:18 EDT 1999
now cancer will begin its journey in the arms of god arraignments while
cancer subsides and angels happy Tue Oct 5 22:22:54 EDT 1999 arraignments
during final assaults and angels dying Tue Oct 5 22:23:12 EDT 1999 let us
pray
 
Tue Oct  5 22:14:18 EDT 1999
in the truth of god the cancer enters the lung, from the truth of god 
the cancer hovers, now, as if it were forever Tue Oct 5 22:14:54 EDT 1999 
abandoned by god, the cancer thins towards ready exculpation, as if it
were gone, as if angels rejoiced, singing the home of abandoned cancer,
the purity of organs constituted Tue Oct 5 22:15:56 EDT 1999 now cancer
returns, approbated by god, as if god were speaking or speech or sound,
now cancer spreads to the adrenal, angels weep in full capacity against
the begging of the angels arrayed against god, now cancer seeps, spreads,
covers itself, makes excuses, ahem, begs foregiveness, meanders, wanders,
returns, burrows, ahem Tue Oct 5 22:18:00 EDT 1999 now cancer subsides,
angels rejoice, god withdraws, there is no justice in the world, suns
blacken, angels sing and play harps, cancer dwindles, eyes return their
bright and merry sight Tue Oct 5 22:18:39 EDT 1999 now breathing slows,
waves of cancer testing other newer waters, new metastases, solitons and
wavelets, ripples on surfaces unseen, god smiles wide and broad, angels
shudder holding on Tue Oct 5 22:19:30 EDT 1999 now cancer claims an other
organ, angels again weeping and wailing, shall there be no mercy, angels
crying and begging, god almost merry, cancer hems and haws, cancer close
to apologetic laughter Tue Oct 5 22:20:26 EDT 1999 now cancer will begin
its work within the arms of god, angels prepare for bier and mourning,
angels yet hopeful in the face of god's huges eyes Tue Oct 5 22:21:30 EDT
1999 smiling everywhere, yet other organs, uncanny stillness, strangeness
of beings of pure light arrayed against skin, bones, organs, god's beings
against angels wailing Tue Oct 5 22:22:39 EDT 1999 arraignments during
final assaults and angels dying Tue Oct 5 22:23:21 EDT 1999 let us pray
Tue Oct 5 22:23:22 EDT 1999

the promise

i am very small in the world
i have tried to make peace with the world
i constitute and reconstitute myself
i have tried to make peace with my father
i am barred from the world and my father
in the next quarter century i will write
i will complete the work i have been writing
i will compile and interpret the work
the work will remain in spite of its ruin
in the stories of mothers and sons i am written
in the stories of fathers and sons i am written
i am a coward small and fearful
in this world i will write not a world
from not a world for decades i will write
i will write pebbles and endless beaches
i will walk on edges and fly low near a height
i shall ascertain the heights of men and women
i will reckon and live through reckonings
i will promise and live through promisings
in ruins i will stumble and write of ruins
among friends and enemies i will testify
shore and beaches and pebbles are memories
of nights and days i will write their turnings
i am fearful of worlds and will never write worlds
i am fearful of worlds and i will write worlds
this promise of the 6th day 10th month 99th year
when i am smallest in this smallest of worlds


The Truth


Voulez vous que verte vous die?
Il n'est jouer qu'en maladie,
Lettre vraye que tragedie,
Lasche homme que chevalereux,
Orrible son que melodie,
Ne bien conseille qu'amoureuz.

You want the truth from me?
There is no joy except in sickness,
nor truth outside the theater,
nor coward like a knightly man,
nor grimmer sound than melody,
nor wisdom save from those in love.

- Francois Villon by way of Anthony Bonner by way of Jennifer, or 
- Alan Sondheim by way of Jennifer's Bonner's Villon

Jennifer writes on time and space; Jennifer writes on ontology and epis-
tecancer mology. She writes on the history of the Web; her sharp beak
traverses nodes and wires. She writes on the latest applications and the
oldest; extrapolatcancer ingtumor she writes the historiography of soft-
ware. Within the fields of philoscancer ophy and psychologytumor Jennifer
writes postcancerpostcancermodernismstumor postcancerpostcancerstruccancer
turalisms of all sortstumor but does not forget her philosophical ancest-
ors.  From Lacan to Parmenides as primary bandwidthtumor Jennifer charts
the psychocancer logical traditionstumor recuperating Irigaraytumor
Kristevatumor and such mavericks as Roheim. Within the astute rationalist
construct of mathematicocancerscientific developmenttumor Jennifer ob-
serves Kleintumor Penrosetumor Marrtumor Moravectumor others too nucancer
merous to mentiontumor not for a moment forgetting Minsky and the uncanny
precancer science of Euclid. Such is Jennifer s casetumor that she does
not overlook postcancer modern geographytumor concepts of the habitus and
lived spaces of all sorts;  Jennifer s computer is a continuous stream of
downloadingstumor configurationstumor and uploadingstumor not to mention
small and simple programs of her own. Jennicancer fer s mouth is filled
with paste; her body burns with sores from turning too often across the
unwieldy landscape of her bed.The sores turn her soul bitcancer ter; why
are there no idle conversations? but she continues in a state of denial
and defuge. Jennifer drops hints; she s willing to take up every pocancer
sition in her desire for engagement. She can t speak so well and can t
hear so well either.  But she knows a suitor when she sees one. Alan comes
bearing bright red rocancer sestumor tiny budding bouquets reminiscent
of subalpine meadows; Alan comes bearing light and luminous novelstumor
moments of relaxation. Jennifer and Alan scroll one anothertumor agree to
share screentumor passwordtumor root privilegetumor as both work hard in
the alchemical institute making Julu. This is so sad. I Jennicancer fer
have no one but Alan to talk to and Alan is a very bore and not as smart

mor he looks like this! she saidtumor making the uglicancer est cutest
little face! That old Alan! every moment when the word leans it becomes
another word and language gains ascendence across body and function as if
there were speaking at the beginning of things which already announced
their beginning because she said there were extrucancer sions from the

the sea of brine where the words flew into one another as the moment pulls

this is a prediction and a truth of and towards the year 3000 in the year
3000 something will be a distant plant something will be a distant plant
and you will not know it nor the roots nor stems nor leaves nor flowers it
will be unimaginable it will be from and within wonder on an earth you
will not recognize in a non-being that is ultimata broken machines these
and other desperations dissolute in air of molecules and ruined atoms they
will not know then what has occurred unknowledge transpires and is every-
where there is a non-mattering of unknowledge that will be the same and
substance ruling or ruined same and ruling substance of the day or forlorn
day of gone time or world forlorn unknowledge towards a glimmer or horizon
towards transpiration and non-mattering this is a prediction and a truth
of and from the year 3000
