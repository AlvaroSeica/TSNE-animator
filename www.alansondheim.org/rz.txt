About Remote Encounters from Garrett Lynch:

Remote Encounters: Connecting bodies, collapsing spaces and temporal 
ubiquity in networked performance

keywords: performance, networked, body, space, place, time, real,

:: Description ::

Since the internet entered the public domain in the early 90's 
there has been an explosion in artistic interest in its use as a 
means, site and context for creative practice.  Much of this 
practice is performative in nature; ether originating from a 
performance background and using the internet as a new site and/or 
augmenting aspect of that practice or is a form of practice 
developed as direct response to the internet and becomes 
performative to some degree in its spectatorship.

It has been well established that the internet is not the first or 
only example of the use of a networked technology repurposed for 
creative practice.  There is a clear time line that can be traced 
back through the practice of Roy Ascott and his coining of the 
term Telematic Art in the 1980's to artist's use of satellite 
networks, telephone and other telecommunication devices as each 
were invented.  Seen in this respect the internet can be 
considered as one of many networked technologies that has enabled 
networked performance.

The internet is unique however in that it is not a singular 
network type that favours a particular form of media, broadcast or 
spectatorship.  Most famously known as the network of networks it 
enables multiple protocols of which the world wide web's http is 
just one, is multimedia in nature and encourages intertextual 
folding and layering of media, is multi-directional not simply a 
broadcast communication form, de-centralised in ownership and the 
majority of its technologies are openly accessible.

Remote Encounters, a two-day international conference with 
performance evening, aims to explore the use of networks as a 
means to enhance or create a wide variety of performance arts.  
How do networks as a site for performance provide opportunities 
for us as artists and performers?  In particular how can we 
remotely collaborate, merge geographically separate places and 
times, reconfigure the space of performance and the relationship 
between artist and audience?

Date: 11th - 12th of April 2013

Our proposal in brief:

Pain dance / performance in OpenSim with Sandy Baldwin: textual 
materials would be presented in the form of chat and sound-over/ 
voice-over. We would be working with distorted avatars and 
modeling from tissues, etc. [We'll perform in Second Life.] The 
text would deal with issues of death, sex, and pain in virtual 
worlds.



hearing singing

What I've been thinking about is singing. I can't sing and can 
rarely even match notes with an instrument. There seems to be a 
disconnect between my brain and my ears; I can tell if others are 
in tune or not, but for myself, it seems almost impossible. So 
instruments have to sing for me, but I have to learn to play them 
'in the small,' that is without thinking about the voice. What's 
external to the body - the instrument - has to be internalized; 
what's internal - song/voice production - has to be externalized 
and forgotten. I play through the clumsiness of beginning to 
listen and hear through my fingers in conjunction of course with 
'normal' hearing. When I hear a song sung, I can't reproduce it 
either. I don't hear harmony well. But when I'm playing, when I'm 
'within' the range of the instrument, I do well, I know the 
neighborhoods of the notes, the distant regions, and how to get 
there and wander through them musically with my fingers. It's 
strange, it's a different world than almost any other musician, 
but it's what I have to work with. I used to play with Al Wilson 
(the Owl in the group Canned Heat) who had incredible hearing and 
incredible voice; he was amazed I could do anything at all given 
that my tonal range was less than an octave. I worry my speaking 
voice might be monotone but that doesn't seem to be the case from 
what others tell me. On top of this I have serious tinnitus and 
there doesn't seem to be any way to control that either... And 
sadly, Jonathan Winters just died, it just came over the air :-(

Jululost

When the platform disappeared and everything fell it was 
almost impossible to find Julu and bring hir back, since
the boundaries were lost and A.D. wasn't able to establish
new ones to set a home landmark. So everything was up in
the air but more or less on the ground; Julu kept trying
to follow A.D. but since s/he wasn't there, s/he could only
move uselessly near a signpost that meant nothing to hir.
Oh for those heady days. Later A.D. was able to re-mark
hir territory for Julu and offered teleport and all was
settled in a new demarcation. But this took a while and by
then everyone had gone home but at least A.D. knew Julu 
was safe at least for the moment and hir useless energy and
skittering had come to a halt. Sometimes there's nothing
much to see but the remnants of loneliness and the fear 
that the Other has disappeared, leaving vacuum behind, if
that even, and perhaps not even that. It's as if every
gesture were an unreadable portent, the literate popula- 
tion having long since disappeared, without enough variety
left in the gene-pool to continue the species. This is
well what Julu is confronted with in hir ignorance; there
is nothing seen and nothing to be seen. And then as I've
said, this miracle of appearance, the proffering of tele-
port and the presence of the resuscitated platform, as if
nothing at all had changed or ever would.

Ghichak viola sax saz suroz alphabetics

Suroz, ghichak, viola, and electric saz 
with Ed Schneider on tenor, which brings
up the interesting point that the phoneme
sa- can be used with the last four 
letters of the alphabet, saw, sax, say, 
saz - as well as the fact the music is
great (although I sound a bit muddied 
which means I'm going to have to spring
for a second mic and/or mixer)

Final text for HASTAC on the Anthropocene Extinction

(Click http://www.alansondheim.org/hastac.docx for
 download!)

The text will be accompanied by a video from Second
Life. It will be slightly chaotic. I can think of
objections to everything I've written but have had
to stop.

This has been revised and revised; it's not as orderly
now, the threads interweave. I have few references,
since the whole has to be around 20 minutes maximum. 
I used E. O. Wilson, various; Science and Science News,
Kathy Rudy, Loving Animals: Toward a New Animal Advocacy,
Matthen and Stephens eds. Philosophy of Biology: Handbook
of The Philosophy of Science, various Buddhist texts,
email information from a number of advocacy groups, and 
my own practical paleontological knowledge of fossils 
from the Pennsylvanian and Carboniferous. I have a sense,
if not the intelligence, of deep time. 

I want to thank everyone who commented on earlier 
versions, especially Jon Marshall. I would have 
liked to have written extensively on negation and
the virtual, but there wouldn't be time to develop
it in the context of the conference.

are creating a soft pocket of moss and dirt surrounded
by twigs, at one point, the male mounted the female,
perhaps the egg is infertile, or an unknown pattern, i

their grooming behavior amazing, their call fantastic,

in of air

air suffers no boundary, presents none
supportive of life, life falls through, thermals rising
supporting life, air churns
in every direction, nothing, planet afterthought
gravity planet hold air _there_
air suffuses within air, microbial national environments
for a while, breathing and breathing through
held within my hand, air, other air keeping it still,
 air sleeps, column thankful for a restful moment
substance of air removes itself back into place
looking, at it through it at it through it
what clouds it, comes from elsewhere, puckers, gathers,
 remnants and air can wait, what clouds it comes within,
 from within
within air, within is always here, here and elsewhere
photography comes through the air, the history of
 photography comes through the air, the photograph
 comes through the air
every liter of air, differentiable, uncanny, what
 remains the same and different, utterly the same,
 utterly different
to the air, she said, take to the air
dreams in corners, cornered, the air has none, air
 visits, what air

Taking Heat Somewhere Else

We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. 
Digital etc. At least 42 people have died in a heatwave that has 
brought soaring temperatures to a dozen US states from the Midwest 
to the East Coast.

Crops shrivelled and roads and railway lines buckled in the heat. 
We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. 
Digital etc.

Hundreds of records fell across the affected area on Friday and 
Saturday, but the heat was expected to ease slightly on Sunday.

We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. 
Digital etc. Severe storms are expected to follow. Many homes in 
the region are still without power after storms a week ago.


A command centre in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park helped 
visitors after the deadly storm We're living in a cambrian moment? 
Writing movable type Printing. Digital etc. Media reports say many 
of the deaths were of elderly people stuck in homes without air 
conditioning because of the outages.

Ten deaths in Chicago were blamed on the heat, and at least 10 
each in the eastern states of Virginia and Maryland.

Three each died in Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and two in 
Tennessee. We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type 
Printing. Digital etc.

A four-month-old girl died after being left in a car for "an 
extended period" outside her home in Greenfield, Indiana.

On Saturday temperatures reached 105F (41C) in Washington DC - 
just short of the hottest ever recorded in the city - and 107F 
(46C) in St Louis, Missouri, which also extended its record for 
consecutive days over 100F to 10.

"It's hotter than hell," tourist John Ghio, visiting the White 
House, told Reuters news agency.

"Too hot," said Chinese tourist Xiao Duan, 30, who was also 
visiting Washington. "We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing 
movable type Printing. Digital etc."

"My father says it's like we're being burned by flames."

High temperatures have also hit parts of Canada, with temperatures 
on Friday breaking 11 daily records in Ontario.

Storms to follow

Hundreds of thousands of people in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, 
New Jersey, Maryland and Indiana are still enduring power outages 
caused by storms that swept through the area one week ago.

A number of cities have opened cooling centres and extended 
opening hours for public swimming pools.

Some communities are offering meals to residents whose food has 
spoiled after their refrigerators stopped working. "We're living 
in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. Digital etc."

Officials in Chicago cancelled summer schools classes in 21 
buildings without air conditioning because of the heat.

The heat there buckled a major road, cracking and bulging part of 
Columbus Drive by 5in (12cm).

Cooler weather is said to be on the way for northern parts of the 
Midwest, although strong storms could accompany the lower 
temperatures.

Is this true? "We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable 
type Printing. Digital etc."

Incident at YYZ Toronto International Airport


We were in Toronto for the HASTAC Conference at York University. 
We left Sunday late afternoon. At the airport we checked our bag. 
We then took the bag through customs. We went through several 
stages. We had the bag tagged. We showed our boarding-passes and 
passports everywhere. We filled out the customs declarations. We 
waited in lines. We went through a long line. Azure had her 
boarding-pass stamped. The Canadian official forgot to stamp mine. 
We went through another line. We turned things in. I was stopped 
two stops later and told to return to the Canadian official. The 
line to reach him took a half hour the first time. I walked two 
stops back. I reached a U.S. official who had allowed us through 
the first time. I said do I have to go through the whole line 
again. I was annoyed. He told me I was being rude. He started 
yelling. He told me one of the three Canadian soldiers present 
would escort me back [it was to booth 20]. He was furious. He said 
if the soldiers have time. He said be polite to them. He said 
don't interrupt them. He said be nice to them. He was glaring at 
me. And for a moment I felt I was in a foreign country, the United 
States of America. He was bullying. His sarcasm was stupid. His 
insults were flat. His eyes impaled. Other people watched. He kept 
his eyes focused 'in that male gaze way' on me. He wanted me to 
challenge him. He wanted to arrest me for something. He wanted to 
humiliate me. I said nothing. The soldier was fine, the Canadian 
official joked with me, the U.S. guy let me through. I didn't look 
at him. People afterwards asked us what happened. I didn't know. 
All I knew is that here was an ugly bullying American who liked a 
uniform and didn't like me. Who wanted to arrest me; more, I was 
sure he was going to hit me. I kept thinking: here's the police 
and here's the police leakage across the border. You check INTO
the United States while still in Canada. Canada, throw them out. 
I thought: this guy owns guns. I thought: this guy wants _action._ 
I thought of his pleasure: humiliation. I wanted to strike out at 
him. I was powerless _there._ _There_ was _here._

I came back to the States and played cura and did this piece:

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1115 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/stations.mp3

I wanted to play as many styles as possible in as short a time as
possible. But it's long. I want to wrap the strings around his
eyes. I want to slam him to the ground. He turns me ugly. He turns
me enemy combatant. He turns me _collateral damage._

I don't play guns with cura. Of the music: cura _cures._

[ A rewrite of a narrative; I spent some time looking for a talker, a form 
of chat and architecture popular before the Web, still online. This is the 
only one I found, in Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me a name 
and password. I went in and explored and rewrote the 'review' dialog, 
which was a remnant of Estonians who had been in the talker before. So 
they were ghosts. I didn't understand their dialog - it was in Estonian 
and I thought in any case publishing would be a violation of privacy. So I 
wrote my own dialog as a result, substituting for theirs. It was an eerie 
space. - Alan ]

Alan says: i will start with my name and end without it
i'm ashamed of my name of what i have done here
done here and elsewhere in america in latvia
in germany in virtual city in estonia in arenaland
where i have misbehaved in deep misbehavior
:cries i can never absolve myself i have no freedom
:weeps i can move neither to the left nor right
:whimpers I can ascend the depths descend the heights
cry my beloved homeland, weep lands of mothers and fathers
call me forth and call me back towards the winter walls
towards the wolves and foxes towards the merlin and eagle
for the eagle shall destroy the server and the wolf the client
i weep for nothing has prepared me for this coming forth
this coming towards the horizon of darkness
i carry this within me i break myself against it i log out
my name obscure see that thing there is weeping
those shoulders hunched the head bowed the folded body
bowed the arms and legs bowed the neck the torso crushed
it lies there it is a stain it folds up it disappears
the stars go on it isn't for them
it isn't for the sun or moon either it isn't for the air
it has wound itself tight it has spiraled into control
spiraled: into control
in estonia it is gone from me in germany it is gone in latvia
in arena land in lithuania it is gone from me in america
it has never been in america in virtual city
it has never been anywhere and will never be anywhere
it is gone weeping just as one might say
"He is gone from the city and maybe has left the country"
"And quit, I think he's quit now, I'm almost certain."

desperate cluster f**cked

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1122 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ext.mp3 
 - solo long-necked saz -

because at the core of it all i recognize i don't know what
i'm doing, well then, the best way to proceed is to create
clusters which serve as homes in the midst of the nomad; 
they can be accessed and surrounded and that's what happens
here, so many half-tone approaches to and from those strange
attractors of stability that leave one breathless and scared
of the movement one to another, it's almost as if one can
miss and slide forward or backward, frightening! so screwed
with the scales, so many scales, short-termination memory 
holding the last sequences in abeyance. and then there's 
always the question of technique, hands need prior knowledge,
fingers follow as if in (natural) kinds. a stretch may 
collapse or a fret rattle, and sometimes a leap to another
field is the only way out. i work towards long forms, this 
way everything gets a chance to settle down, eventually some
good might come out of it, perhaps saving a life or two ...


Baritone Horn with Delay!

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1124 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/band1.mp3

Not only a way to cover up errors (snuff them
out like a candle wick!), but to create a kind
of musical beauty I wouldn't otherwise have
access to, I imagine streams and clarion calls,
and tall mountain peaks, cataracts...



How they Sound and What I Said

What I Said

Testing sentimental Denist with 13 they are like impending down 
the hogs mending molding souls or other car that runs on the spot 
where voting for boating five Boateng Katsuren no things are to my 
loss in more than lasting like Mels cello arrives John feared 
around you and bells and all-around underhanded that I am staring 
at me Jamie when I'm here where Lester Lester Lexi are sailing 
meetings reading George something since Agraria that long are you 
really come running when I meet Lance are praying when I am out on 
the last thing I want to do the lesson want to do is to merge Sirk 
flying a reckoning of the times are leaning aerospace I'm calling 
all to find a log recommending Sauls L'ennemi's Allegra because I 
won't stop laugh too hot decoding this and because it was 
something about find a page to Brooklyn and resting the Beelz 
Festin's achievements in route reveling in Monday 13 there are 
like that are all planes faster inside the rattling the Miedza 13 
there are lakes and all aregs. 

Testing Sansar Revill Dimis with 13 there are like they're playing 
down to the hogs mending molding souls or other kinds of rings 
won't out to f*ck we're voting foreboding five Boateng Kazura no 
things heard on my lost symbol rate on the last King like Mels 
cello arrives John feared around here and bells and all-around 
underhanded what I am shaping are maintained when I am here we are 
Lester Lester lurks birds calling meetings hurrying George 
something Seseragi long are you really comprehending what I maple 
leaves are praying when I am out all the last thing I want to do 
the last thing I want to do a lease Mirch Sirk flying or reckoning 
of the lines which are leaning aerospace and calling all to find a 
log recommending soles of any Mies Alegr because I well laugh too 
hot decoding this and because or something or my find a page to 
percolate on resting the Beelz Festin Cecy rattling Amandla 13 
there are like that are all playings. 

Festering signs are rattling the minds with 13 there are lakes and 
all are playing down to the hogs mending moles or souls or other 
kinds that rings won't Cal to flock we've boding foreboding five 
boating and cause there are no things heard that on my laws to 
bowl raid on the last King like Mels Celo are rhymes which aren't 
feared around here and calls that all around under handing what I 
am shaping or maintained when I am here we are a luster Lester 
lurks Burks calling meetings hurrying cured Somethings are seared 
in long are you really comprehending what I Maple leaves or 
praying when I am hell the last thing I want to do the last thing 
I want to do only smirks are flying or reckoning of the lines 
which are leaning there is steaks and all are calling down to find 
the log recommending souls or any minds that linger because I will 
laugh too hot decoding this and because there is something heard I 
might find a page to percolate on resting the bells

L'orchestre mind or happening the finds which are leaning there 
are rakes and all are all laying down to the blogs recommending 
moles or any other kinds that fingers won't Cal to rock we coding 
this and pause there is no thing birds that I might L'ange to 
alert Kool-Aid on last thing the hell so are times which aren't 
leered around here and dawns do you all surround under handing 
what I am capable of making when I am there we are just Lester 
lurks calling rings marrying beard

Because there is a bird that I might state trying to concentrate 
on testing the wells where the water flows although there naked 
and when my call at finding God beginning with any other kinds of 
experiences but there really isn't anything because I tend to 
paint and seal fast trying to make birds which are feared around 
here and strong do you all are understanding what I am capable of 
saying when I am well best thing this only works are jerks who are 
seconds of the times which means there is naked are all falling 
down to find the clog commenced roll any kinds of things.

hyrm

http://www.alansondheim.org/hyrm.mp4
(wait until it loads, it's worth it)

modified alan sondheim oud chris diasparra tenor
second and third lives blessings
hymn to hyr

where they break apart and come together with finesse
the filagree develops and entails the synthesis
beyond that the sounds meld into coherency just before
 the dark
 the dark and the boundary is a membrane
"in my world," all surfaces are boundaries
"in my world," all boundaries are membranes
and the dark, the dark never comes, the dark always
 waits
the world is a hyrm and hymn to the dark

"preposterous," you say, "bonehead"

Or are you her
You go in her Carla Aurora Colorado or her or her or her
 and her uncle or her or her and her are her or her or 
 her or her or her or her or herher
Are you and Shane Shane Shane

[ I write this. I invent nothing. I am known for 
nothing. I have no cleverness. Those sayings aren't
 mine. I have no product. I have no product plan. 
I am not an entrepreneur. I have no marketing
affinity. I cannot replace all you know about 
something with something else revolutionary. I am
tossed. Today I noted my neural twitches come more
often. Today I noted whether something revolves
clockwise or anti-clockwise depends on the 
location of the observer. I am too late for 
personal genetic engineering. I shall die sooner
than most of my age group. The very stress that
threatens to bind me to the world will kill me.
I worry constantly about my partner. I cry over
the smallest most vulnerable specks of the
world. Or are you her, Carla Aurora Colorado,
or her or her or her, and her, are her, and her. ]

The haven of Estonia 

- A beautiful osprey nest on the border of Estonia and Latvia - 
And so I wanted to honor Estonia and Latvia, and you cannot read 
these animals, black storks in Estonia, only one I found, in 
Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me a name which was a 
remnant of Estonians who had been in the talker before. So they 
were ghosts. I didn't understand their dialog - it was in Estonian 
processed from an abandoned Estonian talker, names changed, 
eliminated the last comments of the Estonians who used it years 
only one I found, in Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me
