most of these were in a Sony DSC F-717 camera
for a number of months; they convey an ongoing
nomadic process that has left me at sea; their
lack of features, their unyielding blankness,
opens up interior processes of suture and
cicatrix. I hadn't realized the narrative
moment until now, no cinema in the works, no
unworking.

Subject: Re: [New-Poetry] poetry, poetics, academia, non-academic readers


Just to clarify - there are a lot of poets in academia who are brilliant 
and edgy - it's more the institutional apparatus that surrounds them. I'm 
thinking of John Cayley's work for example, which is hardly traditional. 
But the apparatus stresses a canon, so for example, with electronic 
literature I've seen almost no discussion of IRC, MOOs, MUDs, BBS, or 
Newsgroups - all of which developed different 'wild poetics' that are of 
great interest. Nick Montfort's Twisty Little Passages and some other 
works cover text-based gaming like Adventure or Zork in a similar 
direction. The RFC (Request for Comments) early Internet papers contain a 
lot of traditional poetry (some of it reprinted in Pater Salus' book on 
the early Net), but the poetics in them extends elsewhere - not only in 
allusion, but also in dealing with underlying mechanics. Perl poetry 
(which can be quite traditional) falls into this area but then there are 
groups like Jodi whose codework is only revealed when the page-source in a 
browser is opened. Other people like mez come to mind, and she's also had 
academic exposure. The ELO's http://collection.eliterature.org/1/ and /2/ 
have a lot of amazing material in them. My point (I'm meandering) is that 
so much of this is based on digital (or in some people's minds post- 
digital) production and for that matter digital reading techniques, that 
new and differing academias are necessary to forefront this material for 
students - and this generation of students has grown up fundamentally with 
the digital. Instead, the poetry worlds, such as it is/they are, seem/s so 
often to still consider language poetry the avant-garde, that the older or 
traditional forms are still sufficient for/within the social. But then, 
sufficient for what? Certainly for expression, for a politics which might 
have a hard time dealing with Occupy. And in academia, just to clarify, 
there are a great many poets who are brilliant and edgy and struggle at 
times with the institution that supports them - John Cayley certainly 
comes to mind, who might be considered, along with mez, a loose cannon. A 
good example of this is the archeology of electronic literature, in 
relation for example to the Chinese 1000 Character Essay, or even the 
language games played in the Hebrew Bible. Nick Montfort's recent work 
with Pall Thayer and the Commodore 64 early personal computer comes to 
mind, and they currently have a show up at the Boston Cyberarts Gallery. 
The ELO and Jodi come to mind. I think of codework which always seems to 
extend elsewhere; I developed the term in an essay I wrote for the 
American Book Review. This was a print publication and the page-source was 
and still is identical with the page. I consider even now the poetics of 
Celan and Holderlin to be among the avant-garde; they recognize their 
insufficiency of form within the social. Cayley has done brilliant work 
between Chinese and translation, often dealing with the underlying 
mechanics of reading. I think this is also true of Dwarf Fortress. There 
are a lot of brilliant and edgy poets around.




I MODEL FOR YOU


(from the 1980s, with distorted text in trance-lation; think it was 
published first in a CEPA photography journal.)


Modelling proceeds from the assumption that repesen tation possesses the 
residue of organism, that something remams of interest afler the 
photographic session occurs

Modelling also proceeds of course from the presence of the body its 
posnion relative to the you, a position occasioned tom your establishment 
of a structure Thus it IS only the presence of the body, ftis presence of 
this body: an issue of ontology

What could emerge but a psycho or sexual pathology, a chanacterology 
rendered immanent and inauthentic by an atmosphene of fiction and hysteric 
reduction? E Something akin to Schizophrenia, perhaps the oterdeter- 
mination ?! pecsonalrly. Thus a situation in which the spectator is mad, 
held in abeyance it is the gaze of the model towards the spectator not the 
other way around.

From this moment on, the completion of the image and as pnesentazon, all 
ot the usual issues occur: male and female gaze punctum, etc. But these 
are not necessanly inhenent in the modelling session itself which contains 
its own modes at representations, con bnually ptaymg off the deployment of 
power and sex- uality within a situation as-d, a situation set aside as 
the dream is always elsewhere

Ann so my body is an innmanent tornn at exchange; tot you it is a rite at 
passage tNere e not ten the inertia at sesuai\ty, the weught at Abe r 
aress at l\ghS, cay body would become irbtstbb, totaizeo: nothing and 
everything r stmuhaneoustY. tts wsitsithy tot you wouxo be as by tox 
myssit at course.

I am always concerned about the revelation o the sex-; ual organs which 
transform the body into a map, an area d stnations governed by the loges d 
gesture (non- i distributive, non Boolean) and Transversals. For here is 
whene Secrecy lies: here is where the get results in an ! annihilation 
aldn to orgasm, a cincumscripbon d the hi body. At a certain point there 
is nothing left to give at a certain moment in pornography the horizon d 
death |, meets the totalizahon of organs, and so on. Thus I am y i Seduced 
and this annihilation is my Comfort; I am ] become you and the session is 
close to an end. I lose \ myself in substance the medieval substance ot 
light just as pauv e Flaubert loses himself in materiality as Saina 
Antoine before nescue by the Signifier ot the sun. Now the photograph is 
not the signdier of the body and this absolute reduction is reversed only 
by the oc- casion of time the closure of the shutter and the denouement of 
the subsequent events m the studio.

Compare this to the absundity of modelling tor a painter Here one nemains 
hour arter hour in a useless posl- tion the pose (which originally had a 
narnitive or i chanacterological content) becomes a dozen Signaler 
reverbemting against the stillness of the body Nothmg pleasant in this 
news tmm nowhene...

While in photogniphy the pose is everything, and?, everything prepares to; 
n I take a pose and hold it for you; I release it the body moves through 
the image i The image is imaginary, the body is always or the way I So 
somewhere. (And when you take this picture, I love or hate you for in E am 
never neutral . . )

         When I model I desine thou desine the photographer I
         ar d her performance desine this which targets my body, l 
repossesses it. It 1 am clothed, my body fulfills the i function of 
clothing; d I am naked, everything is gone, devoured, spent.

(Is there not a void between technology and body, bet-
         ween Superstructure and base thnough which desire 
         flows, a mediation which transforms body into tantast? 
         What I desine is an extension of the world, its caress;
         what I desire is loss, and its desire).

         This is a form at gMng, this devouring. The posed body
         is the anorectic body, the body as absolute signifier,
         impenetrable, this is the body of exchange, the body
         d late capitalism in which commoddication and,
         tetishi2ation become one become the Same. The pure
         commodity?the cohesive body?gathers light
         reproduces it as a form of abjedion. Abjedion, since
         light and body are no longer being and not being, See
         and not selt, neither one thing or another (the absent
         entity which exists on flhe temporal interstice d the shua-
         tershudder) the body becomes a re-presenlation, shod
         cincuiting the photographer and the everyday

         Photography ar d modelling in particular are the inverted
         double of the body of the shaman, and the shaman
         is androgynous

         Thus photography itseh mediates between the real
         (evidence in the scientific sense) and the imaginary
         (the eccentric space of the emtic): an entity embed

POEM:

How could I write those things?
How could I imagine I'd get away with it?
I live in the vacuum state beset on all sides by the 
virtual.
How could I think that this work is anything but mediocre?
I've made a mess of the body and sexuality.
I've completely screwed up politics and social media.
Now I stare at our faces in the mirror.
I want a better future for Azure than my dismal clothing!
The vacuum is my friend annihilating my thoughts
I have to avoid the bad thoughts.
I made a mess of my own body and its sexuality.
I look at my body and say "its sexuality."
And look at my body and say "its corruption and collapse."
After I die I wish my ashes scattered on my ashes.
Tomorrow I will speak about the Holocaust.
The day after I will speak about holocausts.
I am sure I will speak about extinctions in general.
I will exclude my own because that will be so depressing.
Azure and I will take a meandering walk.
We begin at our place where we sleep and continue.
Sometimes sooner we turn around.
We turn around after we can't see our place any more.
We know the way back through the city funnel.
The funnel is dark and its cloaca spills into our place.
Realistically it spills into the doorway of our place.
There are boys and girls drunk there and broken bricks.
The bricks were put into place but snow has broken them.
O bricks where are thy other bricks.
The city is poor and has no replacement bricks.
The city is poor and has no replacement city.
I contemplate the holo-deck and -causts.
Sun heats the stuff and it breaks down.
Rubber breaks down in sun and wood cracks.
Everything makes a sound then silence.
How could I write these things?
How could I imagine I'd get away with it?
My writing is hateful.
My sexuality leans out and crashes.
My body follows suit tout suite.
Here come the virtual particles.
Semen washes off and is extinct.
I am excluded from exclusion but this by no means.
We meander a visit.
How could I be so stupid?

Fair is my yoke, though grievous be my pains.

Phoebus - Arise
My thoughts, hold mortal strife!
As, in a dusky and tempestuous night
How many times night's silent queen her face -
My lute - be as thou was then thou didst grow?

This life, which seems so fair - 
The Permanancy of Life -
The World a Game -

video down the street, the lens freezes over with ice
the camera comes close to freezing, I run inside, remove the
 battery and card, dry everything out wrapped in towels then
 run to the window where I record more furious sounds -
years ago in similar I fell into the winter ocean at Peggy's
 Cove, there was rind ice, I half pulled myself out, was 
 half pulled out by I think Robin Collyer not sure, people
 die at the spot every year, the tourists come in the
 thousands in summer -
I'm fascinated by the white blankness in the image centers,
 reminded of 19th-century maps of the Canadian north, where
 nothing was filled in, and land and sea impossible in the
 details; this is also the imaginary of the dream, or Lacan's
 imaginary, or the placelessness of the hypnagogic, or the
 threat of the abject in the real, but now -
now there's a gas leak in downtown Halifax near the College,
 the whole area's cordoned off, it's all over the news -
the winds are furious! it's exhilarating!

Budge/t video

http://www.alansondheim.org/ice09.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/budget.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/ice30.jpg

This is a 11x sped-up video of large ships and a Nor'easter in 
Nova Scotia. Everything's ice-bound. The ships move slowly in 
the open water. The back-hoe was slow as well. The full video is 
11' in length; for online I sped it up to 1'1". It's a different 
video. I'm interested at the moment in blankness, inertness, the 
deeply obdurate of the real. On some of the sections I've used 
10x echo at +/-.05 to structure the movement; with the largest 
ship, there's just a slight blurring of outline. It's that slow, 
that deliberate. The backhoe is framed by text and windows at a 
media center. These forces resonate for me with the smoothed 
hard granite boulders at Peggy's Cove and Mahone Bay, and with 
the fragility of the basal metazoan glade of the ctenophores 
washed up in advanced of last week's blizzard. Everything 
impinges, and the nub of a prow impinges greatly.

I open up this section with an image of an International Telecom 
ship's antenna farm, and close it with an image from the 
icestorm. In between, there's the budget video; the title of the 
full version is budge.




Blizzard Machinery in Two Virtual Worlds

5x Sped-up Version of the video created for the 
Nova Scotia College of Art and Design talk this
coming Wednesday. The full version will be shown,
as well as a number of other pieces. 

http://www.alansondheim.org/NSCADquik.mp4

The blizzard textures and videos link the two 
worlds together. I am not of this world. I am 
of the avian kind, caught in branch phenomena
utterly foreign to me. I am imperfect starling.
Also I am ice.

http://www.alansondheim.org/icestorm37.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/icestorm40.jpg

I run the statistics panel in the center of the
image. It parameterizes the image, gives it
coherence, processing values. It's the pulse of
the image. Also it's the breath.

Now I cannot breathe, there are too many 
wonderful things to say. I will listen to you
if you speak clearly. I am an avatar caught
in ice. Also I am caught in prims and meshes.



The Ghost, Blizzard

http://www.alansondheim.org/NSCAD.mp4

(full NSCAD video at lowered data rate)

I'm tired now, last night I woke up and looked over towards the 
window; the curtains were drawn. In front of them, I saw a 
ghost, a large white and somewhat unformed semi-transparent mass 
that moved, almost floated, but conveyed a sense of mass. I was 
frightened, I never had this happen to me before, and I screamed 
- now I think that my video is a premonition of the presence of 
ghosts; certainly it's not coincidental, and I've worked on 
similar images before without apparitions. But I was in an 
unusual state, I was panicky, and that may have contributed a 
certain sensibility or 'antenna apparatus' to my troubled night. 
When I screamed, and it was a loud scream, Azure immediately 
woke up, and then both of us went back to bed. I was worried (I 
always worry about something) that my scream might bring the 
police, and then what? I was at a loss. The ghost, by the way, 
had the texture of thick blizzard snow, white-grey and mottled, 
but it didn't slough off or fall from the form; it was there 
before me. When I woke this morning, I was determined to put the 
full video up, as compensation or redemption for the uncanny 
vision, which continues to haunt me.

The video is 5 minutes 3 seconds in length. Resolution is 
slightly lower and the video is set for streaming; it should run 
ok. The size of the file is 112 Mb. The .mov version is 883 Mb 
but I haven't put that up of course. You can download this 
version by right-click the file and saving; if you go to 
www.alansondheim.org/ and scroll down to NSCAD.mp4 - capitals 
come before small letters in the directory - this might be the 
easiest way; you don't have to open the file at all until it's 
downloaded. If you come to the Wednesday talk at NSCAD (it's in 
the early afternoon I think), you can see the full version which 
has better resolution and if you want I can give you a copy of 
it; you'd have to bring your own external hard drive or card; I 
wouldn't have time to burn a DVD. On the full version, most of 
the small print is readable, should you care to do that, but 
it's not necessary; the moving vertical line in the last few 
sections represents frame rates and through-put, and looks quite 
beautiful, almost understandable, in the full version; in the 
compressed version, you certainly 'get the idea.' Since some of 
the video is fairly dark, or at least the background landscape 
is, it's probably best to watch in a dark room, and earphones 
will help, although the sounds - the blizzard winds - really 
don't need that sort of fidelity; still, the stereo effect is 
quite nice. 

Somewhere in the video, I'm certain, the ghost lurks, but where? 
Between the frames? In the virtual worlds I conjured up, in 
order to make the piece, and which remain inactive until I enter 
them again? In the soul of the machine itself? I prefer to 
think, in the soul of the blizzard, the cold blank slate of the 
end of life on earth, many eons hence. The evidence is in the 
ghost and its premonition in the video, something is lurking in 
our midst.



Geography Lessons!


Dave MacIsaac and Louis Benoit at the Old Triangle, Halifax

http://www.alansondheim.org/strathspey.jpg

This was one of the most amazing nights of my life. I love
this music and its subtlety - its grace notes, rhythmic, 
tempo, and genre shifts - its joyful and mournful beauty -
its singing to the world. We listened and talked with the
musicians for three and a half hours; we're going back next
Monday night as well. The music is formal, the occasion
isn't, and everything was perfect. Dave MacIsaac is
internationally known for his playing on fiddle and guitar;
he's played all over the world. I hadn't heard Louis Benoit
before, but his mandolin playing is wonderful, and his
guitarwork perfect. MacIsaac's right hand picking is the
best I've ever seen, and his bowing, magical.

world untethering, on my lips the words 'azure, i love

into me, and then nothing or a slide and my chest
tightens, i am gone, my chest releases, azure remains,

Physics

http://www.alansondheim.org/sig6.jpg

signal masts on Citadel Hill

The history of physics is endless in depth and breadth, as are 
verification procedures and legitimations of hypotheses. Here 
I'm interested in the phenomenology of physics, in particular 
what occurs before a turn towards the subatomic and quantum 
mechanics. I've been reading Natural Philosophy for General 
Readers and Young People, translated and edited from Ganot's 
Cours Elementaire de physique by E. Atkinson, 8th edition, 1896; 
this is one of numerous similar books that form the basis for 
both popular and university texts. The experiments described, in 
particular those associated with electrical phenomena, tend to 
operate on the level of the anecdotal, much as early psychology 
emphasized the patient's narrative, through Freud and beyond. 
Fundamental principles are rarely described, although they 
appear as frames; thus there are sections on various aspects of 
Morse's telegraph, but only a mention of Maxwell. Experiments 
might include a vibrating wire and Faraday's wheel; engineering 
and physics are entangled, and demonstration replaces the 
mathematical basis of electromagnetic elements. Even with a 
limited mathematical apparatus, it's clear that the text must 
operate on the level of the everyday; atomic and molecular 
models are described, but the former seem to possess little if 
any structure. The everyday asserts itself continually; 
experiments with batteries and various forms of capacitors 
involve the hand touching one or another wire, grounding the 
structure, or applying current. Out of a book of 730 pages, 
atoms are mentioned only on pp. 4 and 8; the rest occurs on the 
level of the aural or visible. In other words, the physics 
described here is body-centric, much as language, in Lakoff and 
Lakoff, functions; the world may not appear anthropocentric, but 
remains subtlely so. The idea of a basic alienness to the world 
remains distant, and the troubling of the ether, for example, is 
replaced by the curiosity. I should note this position is also 
that of the religious fundamentalist, for whom the alien 
threatens to shatter everything. The experiments described are 
but one step from the parlor game or presentation, and indeed in 
earlier texts there are examples of young ladies connected by 
wire, or the electrocution of a dog by means of Leyden jars 
coupled together. Further, all these phenomena in general are 
seen, not as instances of principles, but as peculiarities that 
indeed connect to the wonder of the world. Today, when every- 
thing is simultaneously up for question and taken for granted, 
when a malaise manifests itself in relation to the 'latest and 
greatest,' it's difficult to realize that the nineteenth century 
was, among other things, the last century of marvels, which 
retain something of the mythic imagination.

Doesn't the signal mast itself operate among these worlds? On 
one hand, it presents flags and flag-codes, which operate in the 
register of the visible; on the other, it carries wireless 
antennas already portending a new and uncomfortable era. It's of 
interest that Halifax announces every noon hour with the firing 
of a cannon, which simultaneously asserts nineteenth-century 
temporality, and a tourist destination; everyone gathers around 
for the precipitous event!

The New Home

http://www.alansondheim.org/mynewhome.mp4

The New Home online was waiting. The Old Home was dark
and the lights in the Old Home were dark and the electric
was on and was dark. In the New Home magnetism and
electricity we're at ninety degrees and entangled; in the
Old Home, electricity was lonely and would not come out
to make the Brilliant World. In the Old Home the faucets
made the sound of rushing air and in the New Home there
were many facets of the Flowing World. The Flowing World
was bright and brilliant and the Brilliant World was 
bright and flowing. The Old Home was everywhere I would
be and the New Home would become a Flowing Memory. 
Outside the wind blows and branches rattle against the
house. The New Home is not secure and is vulnerable and
the people are sad there because the Old Home has no 
wind and no energy or force or momentum and the Old Home
has no Flowing Calculus. We are going to the Old Home 
and that is the Song of the Brilliant Swan but we are 
now among the New Home and that is a home of Flowing
Delight.

Then I did realize that my genre is that of the retardation
of reality, image upon image, video upon image, all forms
of recording, from every place, making the place a home, in
a way that almost guarantees me a sense of mourning, loss,
at the end of the day, every day a sweeping into the relay
of night. As if I were born homeless, or into a play of
home which falls apart, the ground seeps away beneath me.
And there were the mines collapsing beneath the ground 
where I was from. And holes opening there, and houses 
in disarray, cracking. And I realize that the number of
images and sounds and movements might betray the seeping,
might hold things in place for a moment longer, glaciers
retained within their historic limits, life on this planet
momentarily satiated with the slaughter so far. I will 
build my home there, not out of memory, but out of the 
currency of this time, this now, a holdfast in the 
ravaged ocean. I am there now, you will find me, but I 
will not be there forever, I will have been gone before you.



Stork!

http://www.alansondheim.org/stork.png

the voice of the ctenophor sighs:

"o stork in the night out of sight you do loom
and weave warped maroon weft on your dismal loom
which bad poets make rhyme with womb also tomb
because none of them really provide much of room
and the sound of the stork is never a boom
and they never climb mountains or live in a coom
and they do signal happiness and never do gloom
or say you're dying or flying to doom
as you marry each other, oh bridelet and groom
out of sight like a kite as you cry va-va-voom!"

the voice of the stentors replies:

"woodstork staccato back-and-forth, long-bills down into 
crawfish-crab woodstork, foot and florida gar, mosquitofish, 
snail kite, soft-shelled Your wood-stork in my alligator fish I 
can approach, but not woodstorks - fabulous and fabled - I run 
around everything, I watch egrets preening, a lone stork, 
woodstork on top treefall and:ibis flocks and woodstork, lower 
on mosquitofish, but it was the pond in the dark-night, and the 
sound of wood stork wings at the do, you see me woodstork, you 
have fast bill, i have strength. together we maybe # violence 
and sound # forked storks works dark parks # on the side 
watching storks watching storks on their nest, one egg present, 
they cannot read these animals, black storks in disarray, these 
animals, black storks in disarray, only one I found, in disarray 

(only one I found, I in disarray)"

It's curtains for the play.

elements

http://www.alansondheim.org/gardensb09.jpg four elements
http://www.alansondheim.org/hup09.jpg three elements

one element relegated to the positioning of the other in the 
raster, as if there were no gaps between them within the 
symbolic. further, that the ikonic is the site of disconnect or 
rather one element a transformation that necessitates a 
transformation of every other. in a coupling, the transformation 
of one element implies only a certain form of contiguity.

  A white hard horse has one element.
  And therefore a white hard horse has one element in common.

one element, all change; a coupling is that which, upon the 
change of one automorphism leaves one element fixed, or leave 
two distinct. two elements of a spectrum smear, gesturally, 
across the rest.

common elements :of the lost ninety-two elementals: at last, 
replied Nikuko. nothing but fluids! we could have two elements 
and nothing but fluids! we could have two elements and a whole 
lot of information!

"it" helps through my helplessness, this naming of two elements, 
the common elements :of the lost ninety-two elementals: in 
gestural logic, distributivity is eliminated - two elements, for 
example magnetism and electricity.

three elements altogether - a genetic determinism! a "matrix" of 
physical enough! now they'll wed the water, work through all 
four elements! just as all maps of five elements, each connected 
to the other, must have guided her with river maps, each 
connected to the tombs with their five elements, stones worn to 
illegibility degree-zero.

and then what? there were seven flowers, six elements, and the 
most perfect nights anyone has ever imagined.

empty space shooting blanks


http://www.alansondheim.org/fishcove37.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/idiotic.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/fishcove35.jpg

the blankness of white or silver, pregnant with possibility.
But there is no possibility without boundary!
there are no boundaries, i'm feeling sick, nauseous.
There's nowhere to stand, nothing to do, nothing to see!
at sea there are meaningless clouds and idiotic waters.
Nothing to hang onto, I'm drowning in tepid waters!
an edge would have amounted to something, or a corner.
No corners, floors, ceilings, balloons, chairs!
the blankness is the insufferability of warm spoiled milk.
There's nothing to drink, bellies are swollen and bursting!
solace is the memory of the signifier, truth is its erasure.
I remember some letters, wait, there must be more!
the clouds are like stones, waters like mountains.
Just a minute, I'll sit! I'll think this through! Survive!

http://www.alansondheim.org/fishcove09.jpg (and did)

we're down to today and tomorrow in Halifax, leaving after
an early morning get-together with David Clark on Friday.
the winds were around 50 mph today and a cool rain. like
slimemolds we're gathering resources, coming together, then
flying down the corridors to Providence. I'm worried about
the border crossing and returning; Azure says that my
anxiety level has greatly increased over the past two years.
I feel in my heart of hearts that I've got to stretch to 
hold things together, that things threaten to fly apart if 
I'm not vigilant. what kind of a life is this? the flowers
appeared out of nowhere near harborside in Dartmouth.

reading the blanks

http://www.alansondheim.org/extracts2.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/extracts1.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/extracts.mp4

desperately reading the blanks, looking for radar clues, 
how something might manifest itself in the noise. so 
filtering the blank, extrapolating, processing, as if
the outlines of a figure or text might appear. I think
of a looming at a distance, trudging towards my position
as subject, symbolic, in the midst of an imaginary
proximity, as if the chaos of breath were subtended into
the remnants of an articulated fixture. in a sense, this
is of the hypnagogic disappearing at the commencement of
sleep, dreaming the absence of dreaming. the trace is 
left behind, the trace of what there is, in the sense of
early cloud chambers or the LHC. one can construct an
entire ontology through the epistemology of traces and
filters; one might as well concede that the world is
such, that traces replace the sign which is, after all, 
a coagulation, and that filters are what makes manifest.

perhaps the blank is not inert, not substance; perhaps it 
seethes, percolates; perhaps the blank is chaotic. one might 
say, "at any rate, the blank"; perhaps the entanglement is 
irreducible. "blank" already gives too much away.

Dave MacIsaac's Rosin

1. The arrow or bow. 
http://www.alansondheim.org/arrow.jpg

2. The music.
http://www.alansondheim.org/rosin0.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/rosin1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/rosin2.mp3

3. The story.
We heard Dave MacIsaac and Louis Benoit for the last time
Monday night. I brought along my Incredibow, a synthetic
'space-age' bow designed for viola and cello. Dave played
after using his rosin on it. The bow was hooked with Dave's
rosin, thought I, listening to him and Ashley MacIsaac
and Natalie McMaster and so many others on the way back
to Providence. So I was determined to channel Cape Breton,
with predictably strange and perhaps insane and unclear
results, once I returned. 0 and 2 use mutes. I used the
Incredibow. The fiddle was tuned to parallel fifths and
held vertically, like a cello. I bowed underhand. I kept
hearing the rhythms and couldn't sit still. Dave's rosin
had a life of its own. The music might be horrendous.
