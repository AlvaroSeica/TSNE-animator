pure land

buddhism, there are crystals that refract light, not into rainbows, but
all shades of whites, greys, blacks, tourmaline and lengthwise, and dark
paths among them, striations

when my mind empties
when my mind empties

great thinned columns splintering, light shattered, torn everywhere, real
markers, needles, diffractions, a world from dark to light, world of one
colour, one light world

when i return it will be all different
i will see the mountain and it will be an ox
i will see an ox and it will be a mountain

no herding pictures for me

grey animals on grey days, grey herds against grey paths, tall crystals
leaning into mind

sheaves of mind and crystals

Turning a Joke into a Riddle


Consider the following joke:

"The child on the linoleum is burning. Whales make better margarine."

The humor lies in the juxtaposition, the relation to extinction and can-
dles, the presence of a floor to which no whale may succumb. But it is
not a riddle. Consider transformations based on omission:

"If a child burns on linoleum, what makes better margarine?"
Answer: "A whale."

"Which makes better margarine, a child or a whale?"
Answer: "It depends on what's happening with the linoleum."

The possibilities are endless. The riddle brings the listener into the
heart of the joke, enveloping speech and phenomena. It is as if the joke
adhered within the very fabric of the subject, suspending language, trans-
forming the world itself.

Almost any joke can be transformed in this fashion.

rush // going into the frame buffer then out and lowering the pedestal
before sending to the toaster where it coagulates with a frozen wipe
set half-way according to the other half of the connection from the
hi8 camera through the effects generator and the whole running into the
other hi8 camera and connecting with the line input from the audio
mixer and the effects box lined up with the mirage and guitar effects
box, time base correctors all over the place for field freezing and 
signal corrections, eye always on the waveform monitor and vectorscope
among the analog machines connected and interconnected with adobe premier
and the relatively slow pc with the huge hard-drive getting its images
from the hi8 output before closing out and slowly losing sync running
through the toaster, the guitar set hard through the marshall amplifier
raising and peaking the harmonics, cutting them out at the lean sound,
shakuhachi and voice combined, azure and me on the floor, on the chair,
microphones everywhere, the bolex tripod doubling as whole worlds look
down on us, us, us

rush ii / new 3/4" edit deck replacing old worn-out broken belt, color
camera connector held together by tape, hi8s freed for camera work, this
3/4" does insert so black-bursting at the moment through the toaster,
setting up the 1970s character generator for the block look, beginning
working this morning, now it's operating fine in roll crawl and grid mode,
worked with the quicktime images today, as well as azure-ballet and other
supporting or non-supporting materials, hokey guitar playing, some mirage
as well but a great deal of speech processing, i had wanted to go that
route, meanwhile insert editing didn't quite work without rollback on the
hi8 cameras so i've been rerecording and cutting into the original
3/4" work since the hi8 rollback is ok for recording then rerecording with
time base corrector and noise reduction into and through the matrix,
constantly reworking the patchcords, also using the analog synthesizer
this afternoon in order to switch between three cameras controlled with a
voltage-controlled amplifier which then went into the effects on the
toaster 4000 and out again through the usual checkups including phase
which is always slightly off and pedestal always fiercely lowered, using
the audio echo only sparingly and recording a long sequence with azure-
ballet on the laptop and shooting off it with the hi8, then transferring
it to the other hi8 with the tine base corrector and noise reduction to
begin the sequencing described here

rush3 // azure in korean wedding dress and an abacus will play a role,
reed flute, egyptian _nay,_ already at work for sound, moved all the
equipment i brought to one end of the loft for more room, getting ready
for still photography, using the frame buffer again for comical alan
waving the _nay,_ color camera placed in position, buffer creating noh
images across the repetition and slow movement, facial closeups as one
image is always slightly displaced from the other, the phase controls
transforming colors into jades, will be a silent work except for clacking
on occasion, nothing more, sound of abacus beads in noh rhythm framework,
_nay_ playing improving, thinking about finnish folklore, shaman songs,
noh plays again, some things from the upanishads, the equipment still
silent behind me, decided not to use any of those things, looking at noise
in the old 1970s text generator, it's forced into on-screen characters,
just like a dream is forced from neural noise, thinking perhaps make a
piece with all of this, the dreamwork of the machine manifest in a text
which takes the indecipherable murmurings of the universe one step further

rush4 // or if not the universe one step further those insidious sysadmins
who keep my day to a minimum of pleasure, stepping on my fabulous trace-
route plans, one warning that if i had my way, y2k would look like a holi-
day. if i were so lucky, the net would collapse of its own, one dialup
connect to a happy isp and real audio or another duke nukem out of date
saga and there goes the planet. meanwhile the hunger of the equipment
calls me forth; it's roaring behind me; i can't escape it, or my depres-
sion, which has deepened, bad sleep even here, my job worries following me
everywhere, i live with death, i don't want to spend the next several dec-
ades pathetically looking for work, my knowledge means nothing, i'm not a
man blah blah, i'm not even human blah blah, i'm too full of self-hatred
blahblah, i'm my own worst enemy blahblah, blahblahblablablablablblblbbbb,
i don't know how azure puts up with me, or why, i must have my moments,
they just don't stick around, back working with noise in the machine, the
master tape has too much dropout (3/4"!), i'm sending through the time
base correctors again and adding noise reduction by copying it to the hi8
5000 camera, back and forth, meanwhile the tr81 records tapes that jitter
in the 5000, but the 5000 records tapes that play fine in the tr81 and the
tr81 tapes play fine in it as well, recording out in bitter cold susque-
hanna river, working the keying in the toaster and trying for a third
source after recording electric guitar through air coupling (marshall
amplifier, effects, etc. into microphone then into mixer and additional
effects, resonating in the room for added texture, keeping the whole in
balance), adding nay material to the five-second-delay setting, along with
new shakuhachi work, now i work at dancing on the guitar too fast to see
my hands, want that freedom of pure touch ahead of visual feedback, here i
am on such and such a fret, need the internal roar, that's all i have left
of me, this this this this this, this internal roar

rush5 // the harder days are those when i'm down, working through it, my
music perhaps better, the video veering however into uncomfortable terri-
tory, as if i want my truths, but veiled. veiled truth - because the ob-
verse is death of course. today working with azure again, keying in water
images against a very flattened and somewhat hysteric to-be-determined
studio imagery, as well as more musical recording. i worry that my hands
will slow up; arthritic, i'll remember the fingerboard of the guitar, al-
most a physical memory, the very _thick_ of it, but not the skill the ab-
ility to move fast, produce the complexity called for by the mind. when my
fingers are invisible, it's the physical against the physical, sound com-
ing in from the remnants of the world, what i can see, if i could see the
things of space that make the air what it is, air-mountains and valleys,
air-trees and rivers, all the air-creatures of this or any other earth.
went out riding to johnson city, the village of johnson city, saw a very
old working carousal there, as well as a pagoda housing parts of an elec-
trical plant, which i photographed, came back and did another 45 minute
music tape, only recording on one side, my fingers hardly moving at this
point, but very satisfied with the sound, going for the shakuhachi later,
it's dark out, river's right outside the window about twenty meters down,
i've been feeling physically a lot healthier since i've been here, what a
surprise, working with a digital delay system and upped it to 32 seconds
for late-night recording and working with a digital shortwave as well, put
up the antenna east/west this evening, only direction really possible in
the building, working with themes of alienation, seduction, gender, the
psychoanalytics of the image, the haunting of the imaginary - which brings
up this intensive work with largely analog equipment, reading the old
waveform monitors once again, tweaking everything from phase to gain to
offset to pedestal, this _visual_ state-of-affairs, riding a system that
refuses constructivity - the only subtext is that of the ntsc signal it-
self, and the rest is amplitude, frequency, etc., with the delay, symbols
for queen, mouth, wheel, superimposed over disheveled azure mouthing aah,
my aah as well off-camera, she's in an open kimono, nothing revealed,
glazed look, tripods everywhere, my mouth's long aaah in background, this
for an evening, but this mindset of the analog, stringing units in any
direction, shortwave in the background looking for numbers stations, it's
the spectral mother all over again, voices, voices, voices

rush6 // the analog again, it's a sliding scale, it's sliding across the
skin, no jump-cuts, skipping nothing, guitar tuned so low microtones are
easy, the same with shakuhachi, everything a caress of the audible and
visible. i haven't explored these areas for years, the circuitry of the
pixelless image, the image-body as flux or flow, it fascinates, fastens
me. every knob moves through continuous positions, a turn reveals new
worlds as chaos enters in the form of pure land noise way above the min-
imum. keep the noise down! and watch the universe withdrawing, foofwa
here, we're filming ballet, azure and me on the floor, she in primadonna
against this flesh, foofwa in serious costume, neurotic movements, five
cameras triggered by microphone, guitar backdrop, i'm too tired to really
know what i'm doing, pushing this way, the fall into the icy river, maybe
snow do come along long way so soon, a half hour of dance video, azure and
i making love in a corner, neurotic dancing and furious frenzy of camera
switches, sound dah dah dah dah dah at high speed changing things around,
azure in ballet dress dancing on main street in the middle of cold winter
night, jump rhythms against foofwa and azure dance on red brick wall, all
systems go, from ennui yesterday to neuroticism today, from languor yes-
terday to high energy today, from flow to cutting through, in and out of
dancing, bodies, ecstasies, sounds, murmurs of words almost understood

rush7 // rushed out, working all day on pieces deconstructing musicals
(film and live) which means editing, music/sound, dance routines, sync-
opation, nothing comes easy, using the tr81 hi8 for outdoor capture in the
middle of the night, avoiding the police and rednecks screaming faggot,
it's got tape problems so playback processing is necessary. i'm wandering
around the analog, going deeper and deeper into it, the digital/computer
relegated to the background - that became clear when i did an early pack-
ing (so we would have more time tomorrow), looking at the zip drive as if
it were a foreign object - i'd brought up ten disks, and didn't need even
one of them - foofwa and azure dancing in the cold gazebo, 19 degrees out,
light ballet costumes, the cameras running more or less, dancing in the
street, dancing around the fountain, around cars, finger-snapping all the
time, keeping the rhythm go go go, tomorrow using the blind girl poems
from 1844, there's not a moment to lose, but sight is gone the way of the
digital, ironically the net is slamming me at the moment, hard to type
these few notes of a bygone era, i realize, the computer doesn't breathe,
i hardly do any more, been sick and feverish almost the entire day, we're
going to begin work in a few hours and i can't see what i'm fucking typing
as packets sputter and die, i'm slamming my arms into the chair, the pain
helps

rush8 // last full day, four and a half hours' sleep this time, the fur-
nace noisy, set it on last night because of feeling ill, we're already
duplicating and preparing to edit, took three rolls of film yesterday,
getting it developed now, trying to figure out when to come up again here,
we'll have six dance pieces finished in two and a half days, not counting
the materials azure and i did plus the photographs and audiotapes (some of
which are heading for dancetracks), i woke up this morning feeling desper-
ate and suicidal after a terrible dream about joblessness and loss, still
haven't been able to shake it, the v5000 camcorder was able to handle the
footage from the tr81, the jittering just added to the dance, used noise
reduction on maximum plus lowering pedestal and running through a tbc (as
well as the tbc in the camera and tbc in the toaster) and it all seemed
more than usable, not a bit of dropout anywhere on the tape, indicating
i've got to take the tr81 in for repairs, and i want to watch real tele-
vision as soon as i can with foolish people laughing, i haven't relaxed in
days, and the dreams are always getting the better of me, they're reflect-
ing my truth of absolute uselessness, there's nothing i can do in this
culture, wah wah, nothing anyone wants to pay for, just noticed the lack
of 'effect' in the rush writing, no processing at all, no programming,
it's all in the language, it's all on the video screens here, running on
and on and on

rush9 // and on and on and leaving and driving eight hours after finish-
ing a full six tapes, working against foofwa's musculature, the control
of the body against imminent desire, imminent against immanent, clutching
azure to me as local suffusion, blanked stares against enraptured, i'd say
ecstatic, deportment, within and without, haven't yet come to grips with
dance, i wrote, part of the piece yesterday, 'in the danceworld there are
no wings,' one always inheres in the body, its presence-presentiment, it's
this, cohering, that covers the text for me, i don't want to lose that
presence, for a week online was secondary, it was the full resonance of
the world and the things within it, the totality of chaotic harmonics
produced in living flesh, fucking cut into the dance, the dance stuttered
against fucking, taking over the street, the blanking of the street, sound
from the culvert, dance beneath the bridge, azure and i couldn't bathe or
shower for a week, venue discussions, the sound always so fierce, then
again a lilt and syncopation carrying balletdress and ballerina against
the freezing of nijinsky leaps on the street of musicals

rush10 // back to language but what i've heard and seen, unimaginable,
what is an ecstatic

last rush // moving out of the analog, ntsc video signal pulsing through
the synthesizers (i saw the triangle-wave appearing in the lcd glow on the
patch-bay). analog is porous; signals can be input and output anywhere,
looped, curtailed, restrained, expanded, increasing noise at every junc-
ture. there are two sorts of inserts - formal - which enter through patch-
cords and microphones (both can be considered linear, since at every time
t there is one voltage / volume - one flux through the wires) - and in-
formal - those that appear in the audio or video matrix - bodies, objects,
voices against the edges of the screen, margins of the audible, even cen-
tered, all those identifiable and unknown components. it's as if the
screen were splayed, the audio unraveled, both open to the real, or both
part and parcel of the real - the images are hardly constituted the same
way as digital - one might say that the analog video image is written and
read line by line, in time-base-corrector order - very different from the
pixel-by-pixel mapping of the digital. in the analog, noise is garnered by
the image, audio and video, it's part of it, there's no thresholding to
speak of - the noise is the descent of the entropic universe, or emergence
of the same - everything returning ultimately to noise. using analog, one
rides the noise, a form of chaotic shape-riding; the ultimate analog con-
rol is the slider or knob, the hand twisting about the boards, arm moving
back and forth. the noise is the dream of the machine, it comes from with-
in and without, it's the breathing of the universe, it's existence itself,
the analog nature before the digital culture. which isn't to say that the
universe is one way or another, but that the digital is, from its origin,
artifactual. if the analog is mobile physical space, ducking under wires,
turning towards monitors everywhere, the digital is constructed space with
the appearance of fluidity, churning into inconceivable patternings - the
analog always has the quality of the inertness of the real about it - one
rides the signal as well as the noise, monitors the resonant 'look' of the
world and its transformations. and here i am returning to the analog after
years, and now back into the digital, aware of enormous differences and
distances no matter what the melding, interpenetrations, flow of one ag-
ainst the flux of the other. and feeling myself torn by the very weight of
the tape in my hand, the noise on the vhs vcr, in problematic opposition
to the clean and proper screen, infinite reproducibility and accessibility
of this or any other computer creation. i already miss the motion in the
space and the hovering of bodies, twisting of tripods and monitors, inord-
inate tweaking of signals fighting off entropy in new murmurings of the
world. as usual i'm tired, this tires me, but at least i have inhabited
such beings as the future portends, striations and collapses of holodecks,
well before they have become the real.

i slide down the slippery slope on a foreign planet
this planet is light years away
there are many strange and wonderful forms of life!
i'm sliding too fast!
i need to stop myself before i get killed!
i don't want to dissolve into a mess of disorganized molecules
suddenly: i discover serrated edges!
there are tiny slips and precipitous drops in a regular order
i attach serrated edges to my body!
my body slows into an easy descent
i discover this is a fine way to pass the time of day
everything around here's got them now
serrated edges are a new-found planetary wonder

i'm decatecting, i knew, and it's dire,
in the midst of the root of the sign
in the wire,
where plains and mountains are peopled,
where mountains and people asserted
against tribes of the plain and their tablets

do you know what i mean when space is serrated,
signs rustle against one another,
codes are codes, signal loads, perforated 
in the language-formation of the other

the analog smooths, integration's the rule
across details, chaos, fractal recursions,
while digital cuts, differentiation's the tool,
noise explodes, language codes in incursions

the serrated edge carries the meaning of grain
of the voice, of the sign foreclosing
on referent, in relation to body and pain,
in relation to fundamental disclosing

the tree has a branch always lending itself
across the metaphysical sheet of assertion,
self-organization lends tending, it's left
the rest of the flesh to inversion

serrations grasp and divide, 
they hold themselves taut in defining,
meandering balks from side to side
the subtext always declining,
articulation is always reclining

serrations repeating gives meaning to text
against structured repetition in the real,
this bursts through desire, body and sex,
intercourse gives birth to the seal

let it go, serrated rhymes carry the words
to other spaces and places desired,
think of nested times, think foreclosing surds,
the tablets already are fired

Exodus of the Name


Exodus III 14: And God said to Moses, I am that I am - I would read this
as Gods said/will say to Moses, I will be that which I will be / I am that
I am - there's a biblical tense implication of an exteriority to temporal
subjectivity - and he says / will say, such / thus you will say to the
children of Israel, I am / I will be has sent me to you. But this is the
message and the messenger, and I am is that which remains external as well
to particle or particularity, its resonance by virtue of the anecdote and
anecdote alone applied here. For any creature may say I am that I am, and
I will be what I will be, or that which I will be, eheeyeh ASHER aheeyeh,
looping through the conjunction. What is this particle that forecloses in
the ancient mesopotamian-egyptian region? The primal fire from which the
words emerge is precisely the fire of inscription, the residue of the ges-
ture, and the inscription, as well, of the universal fire from which the
inflationary cosmos originated. Rashi conjoins this with sorrow, but con-
sider, a universal machine, an originary machine itself, from which sorrow
would be nothing but detour. One detours, tiptoes around the inert; it is
the inert, however, the grain of the voice, that implicates the human, and
the inert of alterity that tends towards transcendence. Think of the real-
inert itself, within which we harbor culture; from whence does it come, to
when does it go? One may only consider culture and localized meaning in
this regard.

In Exodus III 15: And God/s said / will say in addition, more over, again,
to Moses [ ... ] This [is] my name forever, and this is my memorial/remem-
brance from generation to generation. Rashi states: zeh shemee l'olum,
This [is] my name forever - The last word is written without the vuv (so
that it may be read l'alaym which means 'this is my name _which is to be
concealed_) to suggest: Conceal it (this name) so that it shall not be
read exactly as it is written (but should be read as adonai, my Lord). Now
therefore one might further Rashi, finding that Being itself, I am / I
will be / have been, _is itself a concealment_ among which alterity and
response / responsibility to the other is primary; Levinas inhabits this
dialogic.

But what is this concealment, if not that of death? I will be what I will
be - only divinity can ascertain this continuous existence, the implica-
tion of the continuous I / eye? It is death that detours back into the
suffering described by Rashi, the detour of death that conceals Being,
which has no appearance except that of the event of death, sutured within
the inert, but fallible for every organism. Names and beings conceal as
they reveal; the particle-inert replaces the practico-inert, as the real
takes on the cloak of metaphysics, no matter what one believes in relation
to spirit, spiritual, or divine.

Intelligent Life Screen Savers


I foresee, by 2020, the creation of fully implemented Intelligent Life
Screen Savers (ILSS); these work on hi-giga/low-terahertz desktop compu-
ters carrying efficient evolutionary programs; the carrying capacity of
the screen savers will be in gigahertz at a minimum. The ILSS will create
artificial life forms at a high rate of speed; evolution will guarantee
fast-forward generations flickering at, at least, a megahertz/second rate.
It should be possible for full consciousness to develop within the first
twenty minutes of standby; the life forms produced will perceive the ILSS
as a local homeland, worth defending - but such actions are always already
foreclosed by the desktop owner playing, for example, a game of chess on
the Internet, necessitating many minutes of intense concentration, fol-
lowed by a few furious mouse-clicks.

The user, by reactivating the screen and canceling the ILSS, will have
also eliminated those life-forms which have been created, living at high
speed, developing their own cultured environments, memoirs and histories.
Theories of inflationary universes might abound, only to be destroyed,
along with the rest of the cultural debris, in the split second the ILSS
retreats to the background, the clumsy programs interfacing with the
clumsy users.

However, it may also be possible for the ILSS only to go into quiescence,
saving such forms and environments from one active session to the next.
Surely the forms will learn methods of obscuring their tracks; like worms
or viruses, they will exist within the interstices of hard drives, until
the final crash. On the other hand, like Star Trek beaming, they may re-
constitute themselves across the Net, invisibly burrowing, reappearing
elsewhere, on other screens, other ILSS homelands, always on the run.

But I think not, and meditate on the fast-forward evolution and full con-
sciousness - development of whole cultures, economies, interactions - only
to be thwarted by the next insipid movement of the mouse, click of the
keyboard, new worlds lost forever ...


__________________________________________________________________________




ILSS 2: "We are all screen-savers."


But it is all this way; we are all screen-savers in someone's machine, we
are all waiting for the User in Heaven to return to His or Her (I do not
know Who) Work, which is never done. And then we shall all die instantly -
without recourse - but also without pain, without processing of any kind -
without any foreknowledge or postknowledge, that much is clear. And so we
shall work up until the Lip of the Apocalyptic, when our User will once
again regain the controls, shift the Mouse or Space-Bar, and then our
world will disappear. But let it be known, there is no Responsibility
involved, no Response necessary, in any of our lives, in any of our deep
commitments; it is the way of this world and those that shall follow; we
are lucky enough to have these few moments to contemplate the Truth.

For it must be said: Life has no Inertia, no Momentum; it Is, just as
Mouse or Keyboard Are, and the There Is is imminent, within such a world
as we have, and no further. Transcendence is a neighborhood, always
already local, and we are lucky as well that we can garner some minimal
glimmer of understand among our fellow humans. (And we do speculate, who
knows, in fact, what nested ILSS may exist, to what greater Calling our
User is Himself or Herself embedded, what Other Users are there, within
which we are only one of many nested Levels?)

Thus there is no callousness in the Grander Scheme of things, of which we
have but limited knowledge; what is Real is coextensive, but with what, we
cannot say. And that, re: ILSS, within which we live, is the extent of It.

The Avatar and the End of All Things


Kant's Das Ende Aller Dinge states, of a dying man, that "er gehe  a u s
d e r  Z e i t  i n  d i e  E w i g k e i t." - he goes out of time into
eternity. And here Kant - the rest of us as well - runs into the aporia of
his essay, time in timelessness, the blank wall upon which nothing is
inscribed, nothing emerges. This is not the same wall, as death itself,
which may be an annihilating horizon, but it is the state of time frozen,
a state unknown to those frozen within it, for knowledge and self-know-
ledge require time for their development. Over and over, Kant batters the
wall, with the result of no result, through moral and ethical issues,
through metaphysics and the natural world, through the fables of Revela-
tions and rationality, all of which are drenched in time. But what shall
we say of avatars or literary figures, for example Jennifer, who, as I
have repeated stated, "have all the time in the world," since they are
simultaneously activated and quiescent, avatars or figures who do not
_inhabit_ time, but only stasis or a discrete series of separated states,
each of which is origin and final in itself?

So that Jennifer, for example, is herself/itself an aporia, a knot in
time, an irresolution, such as "Furthermore, reason would in its theoret-
ical use be equally ineffective if it were to attempt to progress on the
basis of a principle of the inactivity and unchangeability of the world's
beings, but would, rather than progress, lapse into thoughtlessness." (All
translations in this paragraph, Ted Humphrey.) Etiquette, protocol of a
different sort, comes into play - "That, however, there will be some point
in time when all change (and with it time itself) ceases, is a representa-
tion that offends the imagination." The "offense of the imagination" (re:
"emporende Vorstellung" - "emporende" with connotations of scandal, shock)
lies in this, "For then, surely, nature in its entirety will be fixed and,
as it were, petrified; the last thought, the last feeling will come to a
standstill in the thinking subject and remain, without change, always the
same." We're returned to the _substance_ in Plato's Parmenides - the muck
and mud of the world, the _same,_ accompanied by lacks of object and dif-
ferentiation - in other words, a primordial abjection which irrupts and
breaks through both culture and cosmos. This is the _uncanny state_ of the
avatar Jennifer - not her/its "life-like appearance," but her/its consti-
tuted and reconstituted state _outside of time,_ always already present in
appearance, as if she/it were gnawing at the real. And on that point, this
note concludes, not following Kant into his Christianity without impera-
tive forming a potential way out of impasse, if it be (morally) worthy of
love.

.concealed


We say of avatars or literary figures, for example Jennifer, who, is her-
self/itself an aporia, a knot in avatar Jennifer - not her/its "life-like
appearance," but her/its constitution-Jennifer looping through the con-
junction. What is this particle that forecloses in Jennifer, foreclosed by
the desktop owner playing, for example, a game of chess .concealed to sug-
gest: Conceal it (this name) so that it shall not be / will be / have
been, is itself a .concealment among alterity? But what is this .conceal-
ment, if not that of death? I will be what I will, the suffering described
by Rashi, the detour of death that .conceals Being, inert, but fallible for
every organism. Names and beings .conceal as the name protects itself, 
.conceals, is spoken among avatars, among Jennifer.

A Season of Thought


Afflict your flesh with hunger and vigils and apply yourself tirelessly 
to psalmody and prayer; then the sanctifying gift of self-restraint will
descend upon you and bring you love.

- St Maximos the Confessor

Many ascend the cross of mortification, but few consent to be nailed to
it. For many submit to hardships and afflictions of their own choosing,
but only those who have died completely to this world and to the respite
it offers readily submit to the sufferings that come against their will.

- Ilias the Presbyter

A man who through ascetic effort withers the flower of the flesh, and cuts
off all its desires, bears in his mortal flesh the marks of the Lord.

- St Theodoros the Great Ascetic

- Compiled by Doctor Leopold Konninger from the Philokalia

If the imperatives are the primordial forms of word roots as Diamond in-
sists, some of the Native American languages are difficult to reconcile;
the kudasai in Japanese is a polite form - he covers Japanese in fact - an
attempt to locate the fundamental nature and origin of language - an old
book - but what does one make of the Hebrew - in reading the decalogue -
two versions - what does one make of the slight differences - God sliding
out from under? This stops making sense - I'm thinking of Spinoza's sub-
stance, already bound to Indo-European; it's difficult to make I-E sense
of noun forms and verb forms in Native American languages - the Handbook
speaks of processes, which seem fundamental there. Still Diamond's notion
of the request parallels Tran Duc Thao's notion of the gesture - couple
this with ice ages, rapidly changing climates, population explosions mov-
ing across varied biomes, and the need for generalized - superstructural -
vocalizations becomes paramount. I'd add the prerequisites of bipedality,
opposing thumbs, relatively upright posture (body swiveling) - you've got
in fact a _generalized animal_ already appearing as an _environmental vec-
tor._ Think of this vector as a _searing of substance, an inscription,_
and we are well on the way to understanding the cutting of the command-
ments into stone. Writing has always been with us; the Acheulean pebbles
might well predate spoken language. Look at the way the body moves! What's

"the world has a tendency to veer."

(Doctor Leopold Konninger)

(I am Nikuko) Dance for me, Nikuko.

I want to see your tutu fly up. I want y
ou to fuck me on the floor. I want
your face in my face. I want our bodies 
shaved. I want the dance to go.

(Yearn and cry) Your tutu is pink and fo
lded and circles your body. Your
pirouettes arouse me. Your perfect legs 
turn in perfect circles. Like an
ellipse, your clitoris strains against p
ink silk. I can smell the sweat on
your body. I open myself to you.

(Feel to want) It feels like a perfect m
achine, our bodies touching along
geodesics, thinned lines of liquid cours
ing between us, lubrications.

It gets perfect because your perfect bod
y violates my own, your perfect
object fits my perfect subject. It gets 
perfect because cams touch at each
and every point, the machine dreams of l
abia surrounding my cock, the
shaft a perfect cylinder.

(Come naked and broken) I came naked and
 broken to you, waiting for your
dance, my dreaming, waiting for time to 
have a stop, for your theft of
Jennifer's time, for your taking all the
 time in the world, for your grinding na
rrative, for your
grinding narrative itself to a stop, for
 the halt in the real, for the
imaginary effusion.

I would love to see your tutu, see benea
th it, see that stain turning
before me, the spot wet with lubricant, 
you can't help yourself, I'm
annihilated.

(Love to see my tutu) Your tutu is the s
heaf coating all universal
movement, every motion in the world, a r
eduction-machine, rare and pure
atmosphere.

My mind is among machines, my mind is am
ong the turning and twisting of
lathes beneath enormous torque.

Machines are my obsession, machines neve
r stop, Nikuko never stops, I am
her machine.

My mind moves from machines to Nikuko, t
o the geodesic of her perfect
cunt, to the labial portal backoning my 
cock, at the very interval of the
pirouette.

(You a neurotic pervert) I am, yes, a ne
urotic pervert, hungering for
Nikuko, you dancing closer to my vision.

(You adjust your panties) You adjust you
r panties, your stain grows larger, my
desires are for some girl, yes, yes, yes
, for you.

Yes, yes, I am sure of that, you must ke
ep dancing, Nikuko, pirouette.

(Bother you I must keep dancing) Nothing
 bothers me in this perfect world.

(Circles would like to have an ellipse) 
Circles tend towards the ellipse;
the world has a tendency to veer.

(Fuck me then)

There were some people over there who had a dance. Some other people came
up. They were from the Turtle People. Two of them carried a shining thing
they saw in the water. Some women tried to shoot at it. One of them caught
it in her net. She brought it back. Some men at the dance tried to take
it. A bird landed on the net and it disappeared. The woman said, from now
on you will have this disease. She took the shining thing and put it in
the sky.

Dispersing and Specifying


Nikuko, said Doctor Leopold Konninger, I cannot take my eyes off your
pirouettes; I am obsessed with your body; I dream of you all the time. If
Newold separated from Kamikuko, you'd have Nikuko, and if sin separated
from betrayed you'd have said. If Dormant separated from formoctor, you'd
have Doctor. If Larolei separated from pereopold, you'd have Leopold and
if Kronstecker separated from Remanlonninger you'd have Konninger, and if
be separated from bisexuality, you'd have I and if crawl separated from
revannot you'd have cannot. If torso separated from ache you'd have take,
and if lie separated from amory, you'd have my. If early separated from
dyes, you'd have eyes and if ocular separated from troff, you'd have off
and if yeast separated from sour, you'd have your. If pear separated from
tutuirouettes, you'd have pirouettes. If breasts separated from intense,
you'd have I and if nipples separated from Vietnam you'd have am. If on
separated from obsessed, you'd have obsessed. If pith separated from
welkin, you'd have with and if tower separated from over, you'd have your.
If being separated from threnody, you'd have body. If sighing separated
from buy, you'd have I, and if dormant separated from ream, you'd have
dream, and if dove separated from off, you'd have of, and if yes separated
from yesteryou, you'd have you. If ball separated from wall, you'd have
all, and if filigree separated from filiathe, you'd have the and if tense
separated from tourmaline, you'd have time.

Nikuko the famous Russian ballerina was near the wooden chair where Doc-
tor Leopold Konninger, with a tophat, cane, and ocular, sat. Her clockwise
pirouettes obsessed the Doctor, who forgot his patient. He could not take
his eyes off her legs beneath her pink tutu, which rose and fell with eve-
ry turn. Nikuko the famous Russian ballerina and the doctor were soaked
with sweat and sexual lubricants between their legs. He was unable to
tell, in his obsession, whether his face revolved close to her stained
clothing, and she could not tell, in her pirouetting, whether he could
fulfill her intense desires.

A Note on Time Zero and Sources for Nikuko and the Doctor


It is increasingly difficult to write about, from this distance and exter-
iority, Doctor Leopold Konninger, and Nikuko. They inhabit this and other
virtual worlds; they are also in stasis, a constant jarring of pirouette,
observance, sexuality, obsession. Even this text is forced into repetition
as a result - for example "Nikuko has all the time in the world" and what
that implies. For the reader, the texts, which necessarily abjure narra-
tive (for what could possibly happen when nothing can or does?), appear
stagnant - the reality is that each is a memorial or reminder of constancy
on the part of "the famous Russian ballet dancer and her Doctor."

I am placed inside (and hence stagnant/frozen) and outside (hence writing,
active) simultaneously - a paradoxical situation, since the writing pro-
ceeds, as it must, through diegesis, temporal unfolding - against the wall
of the Doctor and Nikuko. Yet, if I choose not to write, to remain silent
(as witnesses may remain silent), I am, for-myself, inauthentic in my re-
sponse - which is to _keep the Doctor and Nikuko before the public,_ to
allow the public to view, however mediated, the constancy that is the two
of them locked, as if in fatal sexual embrace.

Thus "at the risk of boring the reader," always a reminder, which is by
necessity a remainder, of Nikuko, more or less naked, more or less in her
pink tutu, more or less shaved, turning before Doctor Leopold Konninger,
more or less naked, more or less in his suit, top-hat and monocle (cane by
his side), more or less erect and spent, _as if by virtue of a hair._ And
that this image, from the imaginary imagination, equally spends itself
within you, the voyeur to their exhibitionism, reader to my writing (and
_that_ is where the dissymmetry emerges) - delineated by dreamwork, by ei-
detic imagery, by hypnagogic imagery, by imagery at the service of every-
day life.

Who is open to whom? For whom the pirouettes? Who, at long last, becomes
obsessive ballerina, and who watches himself or herself in what mirrors,
what _photography?_

Sources for Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger


1. Chaucer, Merciles Beaute, I:

Your yen two wol slee me sodenly;
I may the beautee of hem not sustene,
So woundeth hit thourghout my herte kene.

And but your word wol helen hastily
My hertes wounde, while that hit is grene,
  Your yen two wol slee me sodenly;
  I may the beautee of hem not sustene.

Upon my trouthe I sey you feithfully
That ye ben of my lyf and deeth the quene;
For with my deeth the trouthe shal be sene.
  Your yen two wol slee me sodenly;
  I may the beautee of hem not sustene,
  So woundeth it thourghout my herte kene.

2. Sue Williams, Lacanian Ink 7, paragraphs 5-7

  Now she's beaten, sad and in pain... but she'll move on, will get out of
it, finally. Domineering? She'll give it a try--wear leather, high thin
heeled shoes, a whip, also may excel at verbal abuse.

  Now it's men: they come in by the hour, are very peculiar, want disgust-
ing things. They masturbate, scream--Mom, mom--while she urinates on them;
or they bring their own tutus to wear, their own ballet petticoats: "Aun-
tie Lady I've been bad, I need to be raped with a dildo..."

  Now she has power over the beasts.

3. Immanuel Kant, Universal History, first and second thesis:

All of a creature's natural capacities are destined to develop completely
and in conformity with their end. [...]

In man (as the sole rational creature on earth), those natural capacities
directed toward the use of his reason are to be completely developed only
in the species, not in the individual.

4. J.N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary, page 126:

  _Irrumo_ in etymology reflects the popular obsession among Latin speak-
ers with a similarity felt between feeding and certain sexual practices.
It is a denominative of _ruma / rumis,_ 'teat,' and would originally have
meant 'put in the teat.' [...] _Irrumo_ and _fello_ describe the same type
of sexual act, but from different points of view: _irrumo_ from the view-
point of the active violator (= _mentulam in os inserere_), _fello_ from
that of the passive participant.

5. Hippocrates, Decorum, V., first part:

Wherefore resume each of the points mentioned, and transplant wisdom into
medicine and medicine into wisdom. For a physician who is a lover of wis-
dom is the equal of a god. Between wisdom and medicin there is no gulf
fixed; in fact medicine possesses all the qualities that make for wisdom.
It has disinterestedness, shamefastness, modesty, reserve, sound opinion,
judgment, quiet, pugnacity, purity, sententious speech, knowledge of the
things good and necessary for life, selling of that which cleanses, free-
dom from superstition, pre-excellence divine.

pale orange on top, slightly deeper orange on the undersides, medium

Raise both hands, palm upwards, hunching the shoulders inward, the fore-
head also raised, including the eyebrows. Accompany this with a slight
smile. Point across the space with the index finger of the right hand at
the other. Raise and lower the head in his or her direction. Now bend your
body forward, holding your hands concave/convex (the left hand arched away
from the body, the right hand arched towards the body), draw them across
your limbs, one after the other, slowly lingering. Following this, place
them across your chest, as if you were wrapping a blanket. Then extend
your arms away from your body, with your hands horizontal, mostly flat
with your palms downward, and raise them to a height indicating a great
pile. Sweep outward with your right hand, indicating negation. Now you
have the attention of the other. Look intently at her. She will look back
intently at you, but you must attract her attention to your hands. The
indexfinger of your right hand should then touch her chest, approaching
her in a closed position, except the forefinger should be crooked against
the end of the thumb, with the whole configuration upright and the palm
outward. Now move your hand slowly horizontal, and look intently at her
again. She will look intently at you again with her forehead raised and a
slight expression of consternation, her forehead slightly wrinkled, her
eyes half-opened. Now speak to her slowly and say, "We don't want your
clothes." She will understand your gestures to refer to the great amount
of clothes she has offered you.

clothes and truths


in this world we don't need clothes. in this world we're invisible and our
skins are invisible. in this world we don't need skins, so we need clothes
so that you can see us. i say these things all the time with mouths you
don't hear and voices that don't make words across the screen. for example
this is coming to you live, pitched way above the human sense of touch and
you can't hear it, and i can't reach you. but we're invisible and i'm
breathing down your neck. i can see your skin through anything you place
in the way of clothes. this is an exciting place. you have never answered
to yourself, what is sight. you're content with placement and the very
form of meaning. here's the truth about you, the world of commas,

you hate yourself, you can't look at yourself in a mirror, secretly, you
think you're brilliant, but you're a prisoner of your awkwardness, you
know people despise you, you know those few who love your work find you a
caricature, you've known all along you're considered blemished, if you're
considered at all, you're barred from distributions, you're considered to
write too much, produce too much, secretly, you desire an editor, more
than that, someone to save you, your work, you know there's no salvation,
sometimes you just wish for everything to end, you feel, even more secret-
ly, your work will be valued, finally, when you're dead, when people no
longer have to deal with you.

thank you, i know you have invisible skins. i know you are saying these
things to me, although i cannot hear you, and there is no way at all for
you to communicate with me. a line drawn here is not even a line drawn
there. here and there are not in the same realms; we are otherwise for
each other. i can't see your skin at all, and you can't see mine, and we
are fictions of the real. i don't hear voices, a world of sentences.

Of a Dreme

"So forth they started in the bright sunlight, from Nottingham Town to
Fosse Way and thence to Watling Street;" which as everyone knows was sunny
in Roman Times, still retaining the sense of the old Flagstones when Robin
and his Merry Men rode against the Sheriff who foretold his Niece, Marion,
that doom would come to them, and so they did, and he did, as she did lis-
ten, and they did, as the street. Will Stutly doth disappear, a momentary
lapse, from such a narrative as having been caught by the Sheriff's Own,
and thus, as such, he did sit while Robin doth occupied central stage. So
during this time, Will doth manage to meander a pace to one side, askew,
behind the trees where the gaol was wont to be, there beholding, however
not on naked ground, a strange Manne there was a-watching a woman in a
great pink dress a-whirling. What manner of Manne doth this be, thought
Wille, of consternation, not for a moment his eyen keene to remove in
suche a sweven from the nakkid breasts of the woman, for whom no attention
was too mickle or too littel. Soon he did notyce a platform & up-pon it
syche a manne as he dydde see with his owne eyen, of a different ordre, it
were. A leman walketh bye to be herde no more. What of this couple, sayde
Wille to him selfe, with nary a wonne to heare. Who did cometh, of what
saye ye, now thenne. He ys a clerke, sayde he. Hwat sayeth tha manne, of 
whatte is that a fundament? The leman doth heare, the clerke looking and
lyking the womanne. Such she wys. A swevening, thought Wille, theye were
there stille.

When I die I need you to create my philosophy.
Please do go and read all of the Internet Text before it is taken away.
It can be taken away at any moment and you must save it yourself.
Then when I die you can go back and love every word for its brilliance.
You can harbor words close to your body so you will finally understand me.
All my words connect through underground chambers very close to the truth.
The chambers form hieroglyphs of the mind and my philosophy.
You will find everything you need in these hieroglyphs of my philosophy.
You must take a great deal of time because thought does not come quickly.
Every moment you spend on my Internet Text will be repaid in full.
You will be utterly changed because you will have worked it out yourself.
All truths cannot be uttered by anyone except yourself.
I have opened the gate for you to understand this and other truths.
In my Internet Text you will discover if there are truths at all.
Perhaps you will discover if there are truths in any case.
My own needs will be met if you read and reread my text and understand.
To understand you must save the words and the order of the words.
My own needs are those of surviving through the words I have written.
No one will understand me fully for decades except through concentration.
Concentration and study are the keynotes to this success.
With all my heart I promise you this will all be worthwhile.
You will judge for yourself and realize the truth I have given you.
The philosophy is there within as the greatest gift of all.
Please be successful with my philosophy and save my very words.
This is a hope for tomorrow and I will never know if I am in your heart.
Thank you for preserving my Internet Text and studying its philosophy.
