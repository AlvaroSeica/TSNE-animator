On Evil, Terror, Violence, Torture

http://www.alansondheim.org/x.jpg

(Part of a text for upcoming Pratt presentation this month; some
of this has already appeared in a different form.)


Facing, what?

If we face evil, comprehend it, examine it, watch those videos,
does that reduce us to catatonia? Does that empower us to act? 
Does it reduce us to fear and trembling, to terror?

It's not enough to say, this is the way the world has always 
been; the world, now, is not as it has always been.

Or is it enough to insist on the long lens, reach, of history, 
to insist that the past itself will teach us, that we can learn 
from it's - our - "mistakes"?

Another approach - this has nothing to do with us; this is the 
work of a miniscule number of people; this is the work of the 
made, the depraved, criminals; this is the work of the lost; of 
the disenfranchised; of this or that group. But is this not also 
our group, isn't there, yet, the shade of Adolf Eichmann, the 
normalcy of evil? Then what is this?

Or this is for or against or the result of, neoliberalism - but 
this has always been with us, this resides within us, this 
defines us, at least a part of us.

Or that this is the result of social media, of technologies 
that spread everything everywhere, this is the result of the 
disseminated messenger. But social media, oral histories, 
ballads, newspapers, tablets, rumor, gossip, languagings, have 
also always been with us.

Or that ethology plays a role, sociobiology, that this is part 
of our primate heritage, that we may or may not overcome. Yes, 
and then what?

At the heart of all of this - absolute violence and anguish,
textual and oral inerrancies, symbolic acts and always 
totalization, the violence inherent in language and its 
recoding of histories.

At the heart of _all_ of this, death, and the erasure of death.

Notes rescued from the pain.txt:



PAIN.TXT


On (severe) Pain

Inexpressibility occurs because of the difficulty of expressing 
interior states that might not have a clearcut symptomology (as 
thirst does, for example) - and also because severe pain derails 
speech and language and thought, as the internalized horizon of 
the flesh is muted or screams in abeyance. All of this touches 
on the _pain of the signifier_ and its inexpressible relation to 
death - (Alan)

---

Doesn't pain negate and foreclose the signifier? The pain of the 
signifier for me is the pain of the _incision_ accompanying 
inscription; the world simultaneously expands and narrows. In 
Buddhism, I'd imagine (I'm fuzzy at the moment) all signifiers 
equal and empty; suffering and attachment imbues distinction 
with intentionality, capture.

The signifier's sharp; the numbness is what's created in the act 
of distinction. 

The signifier's not in the place of pain except for the 
observer; for the person undergoing (severe) pain, there is no 
place at all: that's the numbness. The signifier's the report; 
the distance between the report and the pain is also painful...

SO I wonder, why isn't THIS the focus of philosophy, for 
example, why all this talk before the curtain goes down? With 
the Bardo Thodol, the Tibetans have recourse to the symbolic; 
in a sense Tibetan Buddhism is a discourse about death, but 
again, by the living - the guiding continuing after the death, 
by the living, and it's a form of imagining and casting aside 
deity, a conscious form of eliminating the symbolic, so that 
emptiness occurs, and maybe enlightenment and maybe the cycle of 
rebirths comes to a halt.

I've never understood this, why one would want to halt the 
cycle, when life, if not fabulous, is full of novelty in spite 
of or through the suffering, but that's another story, or 
perhaps the same. - (Alan)

On the Subaltar of Evil, the Abject


abjection/expulsion, purity and danger but here: with a weapon

[Fragments below]

XXXX: Logic of Universal Terror

[for all]X (not X --> 0)
Therefore not X is taken to 0 (null set)
Therefore not X is always already processed to 0
Therefore not X is equivalent to 0
Therefore not x is identical to 0
Therefore X --> V (universal set)
Therefore X is always already processed to V
Therefore X is equivalent to V
Therefore X is identical to V

This came on the heels of a first post I wrote thinking about 
XXXX and the idea of exclusion - from for all X not X tends 
towards zero - to X is identical with the universal set, not X 
is identical with the null set. I'm playing off ideas of purity 
and exclusion - things like the Pale etc. or the theory in 
Kristeva's Powers of Horror or the earlier Mary Douglas' Purity 
and Danger.

That which is not for me, in other words, is against me, and 
must be annihilated, and annihilation must be carried out to the 
limit. So for me the movement is from 'sending' or projecting 
not-x into the null set, to making it equivalent, to making it 
identical - a movement maybe from epistemology to ontology - the 
not-x become - _are_ inherently non-being, eliminated. -

X doesn't equal not-X. The world divides and hardens between X 
and not-X; it's a classical division so that the intersection of 
X and not-X is the null set. What I'm trying to present is the 
idea of an expulsion and an annihilation of what's expelled. 

XXXX wants a purified caliphate with only believers; 
non-believers are expelled or murdered. Could you elaborate on 
the rest of your post? I'm trying to say then that the 
annihilation is that of the Other - the Other isn't permitted to 
survive, and with the death of the Other, the Other becomes 
identified with 0.

Trying to come to grips with annihilation when for example 
beheading occurs, not only to foment terror, but as an act of 
piety, as part of the natural order of things -

             in the above, a signal is sent, becomes furious, 
begins to dissolve, the dance is violent and sexual like a 
machine gun


XXXX EXPANSION BY FORCE AND TERROR

FORCE = TERROR
WORD = NOTHING

or think of it like this:
for all X, not-X tends towards zero, not the null set
a move from set theory to simple arithmetic
whatever isn't x must be eliminated 
numbers brought down until the slate is cleansed kill-delete
then not-X = 0, the epistemology is complete
and in the future not-X is identical with zero,
 history erased, ontology cleansed - fundamentals

Addenda (prepared for the Empyre discussion:



[...]"Amery argued, was that torture destroyed the world as the 
sufferer previously knew it. One of the most 'fundamental 
experiences of human beings', he observed, was the 'expectation 
of help': hot-water bottles, cups of tea, analgesics are 
routinely given to those in pain. In contrast, 'with the first 
blow from a policeman's fist, against which there can be no 
defense, and which no helping hand will ward off, a part of our 
life ends and it can never be revived'."

(Joanna Bourke, The Story of Pain, quoting Jean Emery, At the 
Mind's Limits.)

"Isis (Islamic State) militants have released images of the 
public crucifixion of a teenage boy.

The barbaric punishment took place over three days in the 
central square of the extremists' de facto capital Raqqa.

The militant group accused the teenager of taking photographs of 
the terror group's headquarters in Syria. It's claimed the boy 
was caught receiving 500 Turkish lira for every photograph he 
took of the Islamic State military base.

The graphic images show the battered and bloodstained body of 
the unnamed boy strapped to a cross, with a handwritten placard 
hanging around his neck, accusing him of apostasy.

A handful of individuals who oppose Isis have attempted to 
document the violence the terrorist group has inflicted in 
Raqqa.

The image has been circulated on Twitter both by anti-Islamic 
State campaigners and by Islamic State supporters.

Charlie Winter, programs officer at counter-extremism thinktank 
The Quilliam Foundation said crucifixion is a prescribed 
punishment meted out by Isis for specific crimes.

'Crucifixion has been used many times before it's an age-old 
punishment dealt out to people who have committed treason,' he 
said.

The militant group have embarked on a reign of terror since they 
seized control of the city earlier in the year.

The city has been bathed in blood, with severed heads regularly 
impaled on spikes on a small patch of grass in the square, and 
wooden and metal crosses readied for executions."

"Across the border in Syria, Islamic State fighters bragged of 
executing hundreds of members of the Shueitat tribe this year 
after it had tried to fight them.

"And Human Rights Watch said in a report Thursday that the 
Islamic State had systematically executed about 600 captives 
after taking over a prison near Mosul in June.

"The jihadists divided the prisoners by sect and gunned down the 
mostly Shiite prisoners as they knelt alongside a ravine, the 
New York-based organization said in the report, which was based 
on survivor testimonies.

"Also in June, the Islamic State carried out a similar mass 
killing of captured soldiers at a palace complex in Tikrit where 
Saddam Hussein once lived."

"UNITED NATIONS (AP)  A new United Nations report says the world 
faces a challenge of foreign fighters in terror groups on an 
'unprecedented scale,' with about 15,000 in Syria and Iraq 
alone.

The report by a panel of experts monitoring al-Qaida and the 
Taliban, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, has been 
submitted to the U.N. Security Council.

'Numbers since 2010 are now many times the size of the 
cumulative numbers of foreign terrorist fighters between 1990 
and 2010 - and are growing,' the report says. The panel was set 
up to support the council's al-Qaida sanctions committee.

The panel says fighters from more than 80 countries working with 
al-Qaida associates in Syria and Iraq "form the core of a new 
diaspora that may seed the threat for years to come," and that 
domestic terrorism could rise as fighters return to their home 
countries."

"BAGHDAD: Islamic State militants have executed 85 more members 
of the AlbuNimr tribe in Iraq in a mass killing campaign 
launched last week in retaliation for resistance to the group's 
territorial advances, a tribal leader and security official said 
on Saturday.

Sheikh Naeem al-Ga'oud, one of the tribe's leaders, told Reuters 
that Islamic State killed 50 displaced members of Albu Nimr on 
Friday. In a separate incident, a security official said 35 
bodies were found in a mass grave." 

"Nearly a thousand years old the first of its kind in Iraq, 
according to Archnet, and one of the last six standing, 
according to Iraq Heritage the distinctive muqarnas-domed 
mausoleum is now a statistic. The tomb of Shia Uqaylid amir 
Sharaf ad-Dawla Muslim is one of a number of sites that have 
been destroyed recently. Preceded by the Shrine of Arbaeen Wali 
(for 40 martyrs in the Islamic conquest of Tikrit) and the 
Syrian Orthodox Green Church of Mar Ahudama in late September, 
followed by the Yezidi Shrine of Mem Rean (Meme Reshan) in late 
October, the Mausoleum of Imam al-Daur was destroyed by the 
Islamic State on October 23."

instrumentals. Azure does four songs, I'm playing oud, viola,
electric saz, and flute, in that order. On the second track,
it's the last song with shakuhachi instead of flute. These are
rough recordings of course, but we're on our way.

Current work on Empyre email list
For me, this ties into issues of pain and wounding, in relation
 to fast-forward social media processing.
And this ties further into issues of human representation in
 the real and the virtual.

For empyre - ISIS, Absolute Terror, Performance -

The world seems to be descending into chaos of a qualitatively 
different dis/order, one characterized by terror, massacre, 
absolutism. Things are increasingly out of control, and this 
chaos is a kind of ground-work itself - nothing beyond a 
scorched earth policy, but more of the same. What might be a 
cultural or artistic response to this? How does one deal with 
this psychologically, when every day brings new horrors? Even 
traditional analyses seem to dissolve in the absolute terror 
that seems to be daily increasing.

We are moderating a month-long investigation on Empyre into the 
dilemma this dis/order poses. We will ask a variety of people to 
be discussants in what, hopefully, will be a very open 
conversation. The debate will invite the empyre community to a 
deep and uncomfortable analysis of abject violence, pain, 
performance, and ideology [taking further the October 2012 
debate on Pain, Suffering, and Death in the Virtual], looking at 
the ambivalences of terror, incomprehensible emotions, and our 
own complicity in the production of 'common sense' around 
terror.

We are all facing the anguish of 
political situations that seem out of control. We are interested 
in topics such as, How does one deal with anguish personally? 
How can anguish be expressed culturally? Can such expressions 
make a difference at all? We have all read political analyses of 
the causes of this descent; here, we're interested in the 
cultural and personal responses to it.


ISIS, Absolute Terror, Performance


Lyric poetry begins, not end, with Auschwitz; the very violence 
and terror produced by slaughter places the statement under 
erasure. But lyric, poetics, poesis, are among other things 
subversions of language, the recognition of a linguistic weight 
that bypasses the syntactic, caresses the abject. So that one 
might drive poetics through the force of terrified flesh, one 
might find language springing there, just as unutterable pain 
may be surrounded by the cacophony of elegy and mourning.

Lyric poetry begins with nothing; poetics scrapes away at 
lateral fluency, undercuts the corporate, only to die in the 
advertising slogan. But Auschwitz is a borderland of time, where 
end and annihilation are imminent, imminant, and I keep think of 
this in relation to absolute terror, wailing postulations 
against the wall that also disappear. Absolute terror, the 
performative of beheadings, genocides, and crucifixions, signs 
the performative of the end-time itself. It is not a question of 
the inerrancy of the text leading the torturers on; it's the 
errancy of any text in the face of decapitation; every world is 
ultimately unutterable.

It's the unutterability of the world that founds anguish, that 
tears momentarily at the soul and body under erasure. It this 
which I've been wrestling with for years, only momentarily 
handed off to ISIS and this and other geopolitics. How does one 
live within the knowledge of annihilation? How does one produce 
within such, in response to such? What is the conceivable 
meaning of such production? Is meaning itself obliterated to 
such an extent that even suicide becomes a useless act?

What of anguish? What of 
inconceivable torture? What of a planet tending wildly towards 
overpopulation, extinctions, local wars, starvations, all 
producing despair, breakdown, anomie? In other words - how does 
one sleep at night?

Logic of Universal Terror

[for all]X (not X --> 0)
Therefore not X is taken to 0 (null set)
Therefore not X is always already processed to 0
Therefore not X is equivalent to 0
Therefore not x is identical to 0
Therefore X --> V (universal set)
Therefore X is always already processed to V
Therefore X is equivalent to V
Therefore X is identical to V


X doesn't equal not-X. The world divides and hardens between X 
and not-X; it's a classical division so that the intersection of 
X and not-X is the null set. What I'm trying to present is the 
idea of an expulsion and an annihilation of what's expelled. 

EXPANSION BY FORCE AND TERROR

FORCE = TERROR
WORD = NOTHING

Facing, what -

If we face evil, comprehend it, examine it, watch those videos,
does that reduce us to catatonia? Does that empower us to act? 
Does it reduce us to fear and trembling, to terror?

It's not enough to say, this is the way the world has always 
been; the world, now, is not as it has always been.

Or is it enough to insist on the long lens, reach, of history,

also always been with us.

Or that ethology plays a role, sociobiology, that this is part 
of our primate heritage, that we may or may not overcome. Yes, 
and then what?

At the heart of all of this - absolute violence and anguish,
textual and oral inerrancies, symbolic acts and always 
totalization, the violence inherent in language and its 
recoding of histories.

At the heart of _all_ of this, death, and the erasure of death.

negative theology


"The end approaches, now it's too late to tell the truth about 
the apocalypse. But what are you doing, all of you will still 
insist, to what ends do you want to come when you come to tell 
us, here now, let's go, come, the apocalypse, it's finished, I 
tell you this, that's what's happening."

Derrida, Of an Apocalyptic Tone Newly Adopted in Philosophy, in 
Derrida and Negative Theology, ed. Coward and Fosbay, 1992


[...]"Amery argued, was that torture destroyed the world as the 
sufferer previously knew it. One of the most 'fundamental 
experiences of human beings', he observed, was the 'expectation 
of help': hot-water bottles, cups of tea, analgesics are 
routinely given to those in pain. In contrast, 'with the first 
blow from a policeman's fist, against which there can be no 
defense, and which no helping hand will ward off, a part of our 
life ends and it can never be revived'."

(Joanna Bourke, The Story of Pain, quoting Jean Amery, At the 
Mind's Limits.)


================================================

I work with virtual wounded and/or deceased avatars, examining
their problematic relationship to illness, melancholy, mourning,
wounding, and death in the physical world; the result is a
series of performances in Second Life and OpenSim (virtual
worlds), texts (both literary and theoretical), and real/virtual
installations. In order to do this, I create modified avatar
animations which are projected into physical space for live
performance; these are made from altered motion capture
equipment in order to create 'inconceivable' and alien avatars,
movements, and environments.

I emphasize the political and cultural/physiological dimensions
of wounding/slaughter within and without the cleansed landscapes
of social media and virtual worlds. Conceptually, I'm concerned
with returning the virtual to the real, indicating that more is
at stake in the former than 'just manipulation' of avatars. I'm
involved in a critique of technophilia through these concerns
- in particular, the phenomenology of abjection in relation to
both analog and digital realms.

The music work, issues of labor, production -

======================================================


1. Who am I? New media artist who works with virtual worlds, electronic 
literature, and musical improvisation. I'm particularly interested in the 
relationship of the digital "clean screen" and issues of abjection - 
dirtiness, wounding, ecstasy, and distortions, of avatars and real flesh. 
In other words, what lies beneath the surface.

2. I've used motion capture as a way of creating images, 3d printed 
objects, virtual world avatars and performances, and live choreographies - 
by distorting the mocap "chain" which goes from live performer to computer 
file to an avatar representation based on that file. (Illustrate hand 
gestures)

3. The chain can be altered in several ways: 

a. by remapping motion capture nodes across the body.

b. by remapping mocap nodes across several bodies.
commodius.mp4 mocaps.mov 322harness.mp4 (w/still)

c. by reworking the mocap software itself so that it uses dynamic or 
behavioral filters that transform the avatar representation by 
transforming the files as they are collected. (Illustrate hand gestures) 
(Example)

d. by moving the performers out to the edge of the game-space itself - 
edge_6.avi - move cursor to relevant portion

4. The results can be:

distorted avatar movements in video: WolfTC.mov sports.mov noOne.mov

live performances in Second Life and mixed reality media (Example) 
anything in the SL folder

3d printed objects: 3d stills folder

choreographies with Foofwa d'Imobilite: duetavatargrange involuntary

5. Why?

How to confound the digital with the abject - with issues of pain, 
wounding, death, ecstasy.

How to dis-embed the embedded news media - in other words, how to reveal 
the deaths of soldiers and civilians around the world, in spite of or 
through digital media. Of course avatars can't do that, but they can 
resonate with the slaughter that occurs in the real - rather than 
constantly resonating with the virtual slaughter that occurs in video 
games. Get rid of the radical disconnect.


Visual data representation - empathetic identifications - the mocap work
social experimentation - four dancers into one avatar for example
psychological experimentation - "reading" the modified avatar -
 identified as human or organism?
 identified as wounded or dancing?

Difference between unutterable pain and its (external) representation, and 
utterable programming of its (external, at a double remove) 
representation.

1. Text > behavioral filtering, dynamic mocap.
 - WVU transformation and dynamic/behavioral filtering
 - Chicago four dancers into one: the avatar as social organism

2. Images of:
 pain, disfigurement, torture, ecstasy, death
 - in the virtual > Poser, Blender, Second Life, Open Sim
 - in the real > unutterable pain, dance -
  - return of structure to the real

Showing:

1. Mocap video from Chicago and West Virginia
2. Images directly produced from Mocap
3. Images modified and inserted into Second Life
4. Movements taken from Second Life back into the real


I'm interested in human representation within the virtual; this implies 
both an image and a dynamics, the two of course entangled.

1. We recorded one or more performers, using remappings of modes, 
including some with 'impossible' topologies, in terms of human movement; 
and

2. We recorded, through a rewriting of the motion capture software itself, 
through what I've called 'dynamic filtering,' transforming standard motion 
capture files on the fly, through the insertion of filters between the 
input data and the outputted files. These filters parallel the use of 
filters in Gimp or Photoshop [explain].

Endproducts - the altered motion capture files were fed into three worlds:

1. The Blender 3d modeling program, where abstract avatars were used to 
examine how behavior appears when it's abstracted from the body;

2. The Poser mannequin modeling program, where the motion capture files 
were used to 'break' the mannequin bodies, as well create any number of 
videos; and

3. Works in Second Life and OpenSim virtual worlds which involved highly 
distorted avatar performances and dances; these were used for live or 
mixed reality performance, some augmented reality work, some video work 
for conferences, gallery or museum installations, and some pieces made for 
live or online choreographies. The ultimate goals of the virtual worlds 
work were - what happens when the body is considered completely plastic; 
what images of pain, death, wounding, or sexuality are conjured up by 
distorted bodies; when does the body become a 'thing' among other things 
in the world; what are the politics and anthropology of distorted avatars 
and movements - if any.

Three years ago, Patrick Lichty enabled me to use the highly sophisticated 
motion capture equipment at Columbia College, Chicago; here, we didn't 
modify any software (we had neither the expertise nor permissions!); 
instead, we worked closely with remapping the body in relation to the 
30-40 markers that were placed on the body suits. This is where everything 
becomes interesting, I think, since we were able to map up to four 
dancers/performers into a single avatar output. It was difficult to do 
this because the software tended to stop working and 'glitch' the avatar 
into a somewhat inert Buddhist image when it could no longer make sense of 
the input. But we were able to create complex movements, and one technique 
stood out - the 'hive' technique or social avatar 2.0.

The usual mappings we did involved a single performer with the body nodes 
remapped on him or her. So there was a topology involved; the hip was 
usually the stable or root node. In West Virginia, we started using two 
performers; this is what can happen: [demo the torsion/twist]. When I was 
in Chicago, I was able to work with four performers, two on trapezes, all 
choreographed into a single avatar - and all capable of watching the 
results of their movement on a screen. So we tried:

1. Moving the avatar in utterly untoward ways, so that the result was a 
limping or broken avatar; and

2. Moving the avatar in utterly normal ways, which meant distorted 
movements on the part of the live performers. This was fascinating since 
it resonated back to the performers, who themselves were twisted in their 
movement. It was amazing choreography, created to 'normalize' the 
equipment output.

Foofwa and returning the avatar movements to 'real' life. [examples, 
explanation.] The 'smearing' of divides between real and virtual, each 
borrowing from, and resonating with, the other.

[Examples]

Note that with all of this, there are no programming errors, only other 
avenues, glitches, to be explored. So the aesthetics and phenomenology of 
glitch are important here as well. In virtual worlds and with motion 
capture, there are in particular 'edge' glitches - within and without 
gamespace boundaries - that define, in a sense, _all_ the possibilities of 
the avatar, _all_ the possibilities of escape and normalcy...

The imaginaries I work with - virtual worlds; 3d modeling; 3d printing; 
very low frequency (VLF) radio; scanner and shortwave radio; augmented 
reality; playing music; codework (an entangled amalgam of code, writing, 
and computer 'debris'; even birding, which requires abstractions ranging 
from migration routes to morphs.

Finally, the idea that the virtual has always been with us, that the body 
is always already inscribed, that culture goes all the way down, that 
inscription and the digital are entangled amalgams as well, and that 
abjection underlies everything, as well as pain, suffering, and death, all 
part of it.

Some recent news headlines -

ISIS uses beheadings, other violent acts to crush civilians, UN report 
says Newsday - .5 hours ago. UNITED NATIONS -- Beheadings, stonings and 
mutilation are common weapons of terror employed by the Islamic State in 
its campaign to subdue civilian populations that have come under its

- And this same ground repeats itself, day after day, night after night, 
no longer events or news, so much as a background of horror. Then what? A 
serious question: How can art, art performance, performance, heal, help 
one make it through the day, inspire one, against this background of 
continuous performance, where everything, lives, cultures, languages, are 
at stake? We watch other species world-wide going extinct (the rate is 
something like several an hour), we find ourselves on the verge of a 
planet so violated that the environment (cultural, global) might well 
collapse (yes, into something else) within the century, and we perform? 
And then the horrors take over again.

I think of this background of horror as a performance of horror, as an 
ongoing performance that now seems an inherent part of the world.

A second background performance - that of the 'buzzing' of the Internet of 
Things - the fast-forward increasing transparency of the objects and 
processes of the world. There are data flows everywhere, and both data and 
horror, digital and abject-analog, coalesce in hacking/cyberwar, and its 
effects. See http://map.ipviking.com/ for example - I've been following 
this site for a while, and the tribulations of Hong Kong come through 
clearly.

Wood!

returning from NY, finding the humidity below 20% and all the 
instruments untuned, even with a large-output humidifier going.
so tuning up again - violin, oud, the sazs, suroz, gambus, all 
were wildly loose and luckily nothing cracked. the oud has been 
the most difficult to tune up again; at one point the twelfth 
(unused) peg fell out and I jumped; I thought it had broken. I'm 
now trying to adjust wood and string, keep the qin happy, set 
the humidity as high as possible in this dry place in a dry town 
(even though by the water), keep the temperature low, anything 
so I can stop running around like crazy, resetting the pegs, 
worrying the string tension, etc. tomorrow it's the hasapi and 
suroz, and that will leave the cranky bowl-backed mandolin for 
the last. meanwhile here are two oud solos, each played with the 
oud in a different position (traditional, or with the soundboard 
upright), each trying something different. with the dry air and 
the air dry, with the dry dry air, it's difficult to keep my 
hands from slipping, the oud from slipping, the pegs from 
slipping yet again, and so here we are; msoud0 is even a bit 
lyrical, a relief from the mourning music I often produce. msoud 
= Maurice Shehata oud, the name of the maker, the oud originally 
from Dubai.

Cyberwar against St Louis / Ferguson

See images below:

A Missouri grand jury has decided not to indict Ferguson police Officer 
Darren Wilson in the August 9 shooting death of Michael Brown, prosecutor 
Robert McCulloch said Monday.

The incident became a flashpoint for racial tension in the St. Louis 
suburb; Brown was black and Wilson is white. Brown's father and others had 
called for calm ahead of the grand jury's decision, which comes amid 
concerns over the possibility of violent protests.

the lost film

http://www.alansondheim.org/photo2.jpg

the lost film rediscovered, yet in one of the directories on the 
desktop of the laptop itself, but of what era, what work, has it 
been processed before, and then these photos! they were fairly 
early with the fungal outcropping, what has occurred where, 
where did they come from, where are we going? i see a date of 
september 2nd associated with them, but perhaps never then, or a 
remix from earlier? and the lost film appeared entirely from 
somewhere else, but then the style, who knew? i think second 
life, not macgrid, but who knows? stranger and stranger. and 
what were the occurrences here, and why does everything, film 
and image, appear so SUCCULENT?

here here, it's from here, from this voice, that the problematic

electrical substation across the plaza, tiny shooting star
moving south from here, almost overhead, a punctum, from here
nor there, neither to here nor there, from here, i'm sure.  I
understand this; I just don't know where to go from here, Get
out. Get away from here. Get out of here. Get out. I could not
go on from here, from there. I could not move, i'm thinking you
got to get as far from here as you can. you'll have to keep me
informed, where you go from here. nonetheless i can only ask,
should we not, is there an infinite plane extending - imagine
the possibilities - where one goes from here - the sink is
overturned deep below the surface of the ground - electrical
substation across the plaza - that's just around the corner -
they're moving in - from there, from the desert, dance, anita

here nor there, words babble, please, where does one go, from
here is just here, enough!
