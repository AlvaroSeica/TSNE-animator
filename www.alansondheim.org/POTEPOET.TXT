>INTRODUCTION<


Nikuko writes these texts; ectoplasm filled with kanji falls from my mouth
at night; I dream the inscriptions into it - she comes in the morning,
opens the door to the linen-fresh room, I always insist on clean sheets -
and reads/interprets. Sometimes she tells parables. I write late at night
into the parables, the sheets, my tongue, my mouth, the linen, the ecto- 
plasm - write at the prow of a great ship seething into darkness - this is
the darkness - there's a screen or window, this machine - it's against the
wind and the rain, against the ocean of stories - 


Nikuko, Julu, Jennifer, roam the Net, software/hardware/wetware - mix up
the wares, wear the ad/dresses - one never knows who speaks, even now, who
speaks through me -


I'm not channeling, schizophrenic, multi-personality, disturbed, psycho-
tic, interred, under treatment, taking recreational drugs, taking psycho-
tropic drugs, writing my dreams or fantasies or daydreams, psychic, or
an imaginary troll or elf or pseudonym.


- Nikuko, who writes daily, into the night which is darker than any dark,
which is more of night than any night, which falls between midnight and
that same midnight, which is written and inscribed 'Nikuko'

 Julu and Jennifer and Nikuko and Julu and Jennifer Visit Nikuko

You'll get tired of seeing the shrines, Jennifer. 
But, Julu, they fascinate me. 
When you've been here six years like I have, they'll exhaust you. 
We all go through the same things. 
We all have been there before. 
But, Julu, we're all different. 
That's what I thought as well. 
But you'll think differently. 
Oh, it's Nikuko, hello. 
Hello, Nikuko. 
We're talking about shrines. 
Ah yes, they fascinate me. 
We Japanese people do not believe in anything. 
We are very homogeneous in our one identity. 
Ah, Nikuko, you always speak like you are reading Soseki. 
Ah, that is true, Jennifer, I get all my thoughts from I am a Cat. 
Yes, that is his most wonderful book. 
You will get tired of reading books, Julu. 
Ah, although I have read many books, I am already getting tired. 
Books can be very tiring, especially after reading for six years. 
You are making fun of me, Jennifer, but I have been here longer. 
How long have you been here. 
I have been in Fukuoka for six years and before that twenty in Tokyo. 
Do you love Tokyo, Nikuko. 
Yes, Julu, I do. 
I love the old shrines which continue to fascinate me. 
Shrines can be fascinating for many years. 
There are so many to see and so many customs. 
There are wonderful stories which readers of Gon will enjoy. 
Ah, Jennifer, you will soon tire of manga, everyone does. 
But Nikuko, I love manga for the wonderful graphics and high-powered sex. 
The sex is very simple, but a lot of parts are cut out, Nikuko. 
Do you think so, Julu. 
Yes, I do, for example, the dildos and labia are now cut out. 
Were they cut out before. 
Yes they were cut out before. 
There are so many men and women in manga. 
I love the enormous breasts wet to the bursting point. 
I love the big eyes and high cheekbones and spiky hair. 
Everyone passes through that stage, Jennifer. 
Do you think I am just passing through a stage, Nikuko. 
Yes I do, Julu because you have just been here six months. 
I have been here nine months, Julu. 
I thought you were here six years, Nikuko. 
I have been here all my life, Jennifer, because it is very beautiful. 
I especially love the old shrines and the manga which are my favorite. 
Perhaps you could be teasingly photographed for a manga. 
Yes, that would be wonderful, to be teasingly photographed. 
Perhaps I could pose in front of a wonderful old shrine. 
I would be very religious in front of the shrine with bursting breasts. 
Hello, Julu, welcome back. 
I am very sorry but I had to leave for a moment. 
I just had to look at some manga and walk around for good air. 
Did you find the air very much to your liking. 
Yes, the air around these shrines is very pleasant. 
You will think otherwise, perhaps, when you are here longer. 
Perhaps, since we gaijin are very homogeneous in our identity. 
Do you think we think alike. 
Yes, perhaps it becomes clear that we think alike, Julu. 
Jennifer, do you have anything to say to this point. 
Certainly, Nikuko, since for example we love Japanese food. 
Julu, do you love Japanese food because you are here for six years. 
Jennifer, I agree that it is a very short time and maybe it is otherwise. 
Nikuko, that may be an answer to your thoughts on this matter. 
Julu, I would have thought so, when I first arrived. 
Everyone said, Jennifer, that I would pass through this. 
Nikuko, you are more than correct, you are exact. 
Yes, I do love shrines and my photographed breasts. 
Everyone has homogeneous identities when they first arrive. 
Bursting-manga wet my dreaming face and appetite for food. 
There are times when Japanese books are loved the best by everyone. 
Goodbye, Jennifer. 
Goodbye, Julu. 
Goodbye, Nikuko. 
Goodbye, Jennifer. 
Goodbye, Julu. 
Goodbye, Nikuko.

>Two Parables.

Daishin Nikuko and another monk were taking a pilgrimage. They came to a 
raging river; it had rained the night before, and the waters were swol- 
len with trees and other debris. Daishin Nikuko saw someone downstream 
dangerously trying to ford the torrent. She and the other monk approach- 
ed the person. Where are you going, she asked; to the other side, was 
the answer. I will carry you, said Daishin Nikuko. Daishin Nikuko pro- 
ceeded to pick the other person up on her back. The person was naked, 
and the person's body rubbed against Daishin Nikuko's arms and legs. The 
person's genitals rubbed against her hair and the person's thighs rubbed 
against her mouth. Daishin Nikuko felt deep pleasure; she trembled deep- 
ly. Liquid gushed between her legs and her feet left wet footprints on 
the ground. She shuddered with the joy of carrying the person. At the 
other side of the river, Daishin Nikuko lowered the person carefully to 
the ground, giving the person the cloak of Daishin Nikuko. The two monks 
continued onward for some distance. Towards evening, the other monk said 
to Daishin Nikuko, why did you carry that person across the river; you 
know this is against our orders, to have concourse with people. Daishin 
Nikuko replied, I put the naked person down on the other side of the 
river, but you are still carrying the naked person around with you.
---
Daishin Nikuko says, don't you see that everything I do is towards my 
death, towards dying, that my economy is the economy of death. Daishin 
Nikuko says, when will you grasp this truth. A name is a marker of death.

__________________________________________________________________________


>Parable

Daishin Nikuko meets the Buddha on the road. The Buddha says, kill me. 
Daishin Nikuko says, no, I can't kill you. The Buddha says, I'm wounded, 
I'm beyond hope, help me. I've seen all that suffering. I haven't really 
suffered. Kill me. You'll be enlightened.
Daishin Nikuko says, I don't want to be enlightened. Here, let me help 
you. Daishin Nikuko knows about medicine. She's practically the god of 
medicine. She has salves and ointments. Daishin Nikuko applies the salves 
to the Buddha, applies the ointments to the Buddha. The Buddha's too weak 
to fight back, there's no defensive strategy, not even that of being over- 
come.
Daishin Nikuko overcomes the Buddha and cures him. The Buddha's been re- 
vived by Daishin Nikuko and has enlightenment. He thinks he's been rein- 
carnated. (Perhaps he thinks he's been reincarnated as the Buddha.) He has 
lost face because of this. He won't tell anyone. I was sick two weeks at 
the most, he thinks. No one will know.
Daishin Nikuko continues on her way. (Perhaps, the Buddha thinks, he will 
meet her later on the road and kill her. You're nature, I'm culture, she 
had said, or so you think. Stop making these divisions and cycles. How do 
I do that he had said. Get better, Daishin Nikuko had said. Medicine will 
overcome you.)

>Parable of the Cords of the Word _Inari_

Daishin Nikuko wished very much for a child. One day she ate a peach, not 
knowing it was a magical peach. At night it would have glowed slightly, 
but she was hungry in the day, and it looked quite ordinary. I Daishin 
Nikuko am writing this. The peach tasted delicious and she spit out the 
pit, which was quite shiny, with magic letters on it, in fact _Inari_ for 
the fullness of the harvest. Daishin Nikuko galloped away, leaving a stir- 
rup behind, and from this sprang ten-thousand torii, Shinto arches. Having 
eaten of the peach, she gave birth to the child Daishin Nikuko. One day a 
peach tree grew from the pit, and this was the origin of the orchard, a 
forest in the form of ten-thousand torii, as well as of the Inari shrines.
>From the birth of Daishin Nikuko came the blind monk killed by the mother 
Daishin Nikuko; from this, sprang the sorrows of the world. From the moth- 
er and the daughter came the name Daishin Nikuko, who has lived in me in 
Nakasukawabata for these many years of my life. It was said of me, born 
with the death of my mother, that I am neither here nor there. It is said 
of me that I am Peachboy, Momotaro, and this said of me when I am on the 
Noh stage in disguise, my full breasts bound by cords, and nothing visible 
but the blind eyes of the monk, my father.

__________________________________________________________________________


>Parable

I, Daishin Nikuko, write this at Korokan next to the baseball stadium:
Just as hashi, chopsticks, convey nourishment to the mouth, so did the 
toilet sticks of Korokan, Nara and Heian period, convey shit away from 
the anus. Just as one is chosen for the devouring, the other is picked 
for expulsion. Just as water seeks the lower level, so does air seek 
the higher. And just as one is born in hole and ratio, so does one's 
ration slip through the bodies of others.

_______________________________________________________________________


>Parable

Daishin Nikuko came across another blind man, a writer of parables, 
by the bank of a river. 
You are my eyes, she said to him. 
You are my parable, he replied.

_________________________________________________________________________


>Parable

(I, Daishin Nikuko, think, Zarathustra talks too much! He's too noisy! 
He's got a message! There's no space in it. He thinks there doesn't need 
to be any space! There just needs to be a big swollen guy. Now I, Dai- 
shin Nikuko, will tell the truth here. I will tell the truth in a para- 
ble, and the parable in the truth. For a true parable has no truth, and 
the truth has no parable. Please make yourself comfortable and listen to 
me carefully. Close your eyes, Xerxes, close your eyes.)

Daishin Nikuko meets Zarathustra on the side of a mountain. We fought 
mightily, he from above, I from below. There was no giving and no speak- 
ing. He wandered about in the meadow; I pulled him up short. He could 
peer down my dress! He foreswore sex, but he couldn't help looking. But 
I, Daishin Nikuko, won this battle, not from the courage of the body, 
but from the strength of the mind and the heart. I, Daishin Nikuko, had 
my way with Zarathustra! Zarathustra, beg! Zarathustra, say the safe 
word!

Zarathustra screams about the transvaluation of all values, and I scream 
in return, what are "trans"? I said. Do they run on time? Zarathustra 
says I am of the body and he of the air; he has overturned the Buddhist! 
I do not listen; I remember! Zarathustra, I say, what is "of"? What is 
"all"? What are "values"? I say Do they run on time? Zarathustra says, 
they run on space, run on sentences! They run on words, they are words!
Ah, Zarathustra, I am flooded with words, what is "they"? What is "are"? 
What are "words"? Because you are over me, I will conquer thee. Because 
thou art lord, thou art lowered. Because there is neither woman nor man 
and because there are both woman and man, thou art lost. Because thou 
art on the ragged peak of the mountain, thou art penetrated! Because 
thou art penetrated, thou hast holes. Hast thou seen thine holes? Hast 
thou peered through them? What are "holes"?

If not, I, Daishin Nikuko, say, worlds surrounded by worlds, multiplic- 
ity unencumbered by words and values! I will beat you, Zarathustra, and 
I will beat you up from being down! I will play the game of the serpent 
and the game of the fox. I will not play the game of the eagle! I have 
devoured the snakes of Medusa! They swell my belly, my cunt, my arms, my 
legs!

I have no values! There is no up, no down, no mountain! There is no 
tree! There is no valley! There is no brook, no blind monk, no hermit! 
There are no worlds, no wars! I have mastered the tide; with Xerxes, I 
remained longer by the ocean, on bended knee by the shore! With Xerxes, 
I did return the tide; it took hours! With Xerxes, I did stop the waters 
and with Xerxes, I did blind the mad mad Emperor!
I, Daishin Nikuko, I!
I! I! I!

>Parable

Daishin Nikuko met a lion in the desert. Where have you strayed from, 
she said. I have strayed from the flock, said the lion. Mine or yours, 
she said. The difference of the hunter is not the difference of the 
prey. If it were, she said, there would be no hunters. If it were, 
said the lion, there would be no prey.

_______________________________________________________________________


>Parable of Transitive Parables

There once was a jealous and lazy fox. He came across a grasshopper watch- 
ing a group of ants prepare for the winter. The grasshopper was fascinated 
- he had never done a day's work in his life. The ants were dragging 
grapes to the entrance of their anthill, then shoving them in, until the 
entrance was almost entirely blocked. Suddenly it would be freed, and the 
grape would fall deep within the earth, to become a raisin for a winter's 
feasting.
The fox thought the grapes tasted bitter as he ate the grasshopper, which 
should have been watching his back. Since he had no articulated neck, like 
the mantis, he would have had to stop his meditation on the antwork. But 
why should he? The fox was extraordinarily quiet, avoiding the usual 
sounds of hunters on the move. The grasshopper had no reason to be sus- 
picious. The ants would have tasted bitter as well.

>Parable of the Goats, the Princess, and the Wise Man

I, Daishin Nikuko, attended an elegant dinner this very evening. And 
during the course of this dinner, I, Daishin Nikuko, came to speak of 
parables and of the nature of parable writing. And I did declare, that, 
in fact, it was only a matter of choosing, for example, a princess, two 
goats, and a wise man, and the parable would form itself around them, 
just as if nature herself were telling the tale. And that this was a 
way of vacating the premises of truth, while citing such from the dis- 
tance of the word. And this is the parable that has come into being, my 
mind, and yours, the parable of the goats, the princess, and the wise 
man.
_______________________________________________________________________


>Parable of Self-Reproduction

When I think that for two dollars you may drink the piss of Daishin 
Nikuko, I, Daishin Nikuko, become in fact wetter than is my normal 
state, to the extent that my bladder increases its capacity, and I am 
led to drink, motivating me within the fifteen-sake state. As that is 
my current constitution within the 26 [letters, trans.], you will 
perhaps have a double or duplicated dosage. So that your desire does 
inflame me, increase my capacity, which surely can only enlarge your 
desire. You may think in this fashion that I am but a fashion, a 
transitive term present to do your bidding, but rest assured that the 
imaginary of your eager mouth provides more than enough sustenance 
for this dark night - I know that piss will silence you, your half- 
closed eyes refusing the visible world. Such is nirvana or satori or 
enlightenment and its dark stream. And I, Daishin Nikuko, will hear 
no more of your chatter.

_______________________________________________________________________


>Parable of Nikuko aroused so she can no longer read herself, much as she 
 generates writing

Nikuko asks, why does everything swell up around me when I try to sleep? 
Why do I, Nikuko Daishin walk around with swollen body? (God, walk all 
over me!) Do I need to sleep in order to swell? Why am I so rounded? Why 
am I haunted in this fashion? Who are you to waken dragon curled between 
epidermis and mesodermis? Between flesh and flesh and flesh? Why do curls, 
scales, fire, long flickering tongues and fire spell kanji-shapes of bel- 
lies, breasts, lips, nipples? Mouths, mouths, mouths. Why are you there, 
distended, tumescent screened on two eyes backed into tortured skin? You 
make my body perfect sphere. Arms and legs sink into shoulders and thighs, 
face into mouth and neck, thighs into clit. Unknown kanji are lost in 
flesh stretched to open to you. I am taut-skin ball, buried writing, sym- 
bols, marks, words, speech. I can no longer speak. My mouth

_________________________________________________________________________


>Parable of Zarathustra and Daishin Nikuko

Zarathustra sticks his long cock into me. He's got it easy; he's up on the 
mountain as usual. Zarathustra, I say, you can't see anything from there.
It's a big cock, bigger than usual. It's long and hard and I'm used to 
that of course; it's designed as a tool or implement, something for Z. to 
hang on to.
It's a tiny cock. I gnaw at its root. It's in and Z. doesn't have enough 
blood to fill it. I open my vein, my artery, the channels of my heart. I 
spill into him. I fill his cock and it gets bigger and harder.
It's not enough. I throw my heart into it, my bones into it. It gets big- 
ger and harder. It gets big and hard. Now I take it in me, now it fills 
me. I take the bones back.
I take the heart back and his heart too. I take the blood back and his 
blood as well and why not his bones. Z.'s brain follows suit. There's 
nothing left of him. There wasn't much to begin with, some parables.
Later, I'll let him out; he crawls from my asshole, another pleasure. 
He'll sow his dirt and call it Medusa. I knew her mother.
Z., come down from the mountain, I say. It's cold up there and you can't 
see a damn thing.

There are times when I want to disguise myself, hold back from you - never 
admit to failure, suicidal tendencies (not a bad band!), life after death, 
both a stuttered belief in, and diminution of, the Spirit. Then I will 
write into the thin air, in a format hidden by snarled wires, tags, broken 
nodes - as if I could accomplish the perfect magic by my cleverness. The 
case always breaks up like this; I'm left destitute. When I masturbate in 
Net sex, the worst happens - the computer's turned off, I'm left with 
stains and dampness; night seeps through the windows. I am always writing 
to myself...

I am a picture. 
The picture is me. 
Then I notice in the middle of the night 
cables are being laid across the street. 
And I wonder 
who is laying these cables? 
where are they running, the to and the fro? 
do they make a pretty picture? 
is the picture me?
And I go outside and look at the cables. 
And I speak to the cable-mans and I say. 
These are my foreheads and my elbows? 
those are my waists and my brainstems and necks? 
where are my faces, cable-mans I say? 
do they make a pretty picture? 
is the picture me?
And the cable-mans say 
we are your faces. 
We work so hard in the middle of the night 
laying cables and faces and waists and brainstems 
and arms and legs and we are your legs. 
Oh legs, I say. 
do they make a pretty picture? 
is the picture me?
Is I am a picture? 
is the picture is me?
- Julu
