The Essay in All its Forms


The Beginning

This is where the essay begins, with the title of this line 
performing modernism.

The Middle

The twitching in my left frontal lobe apparently isn't the result 
of TIA, but a stylistic device originating in postmodernism.

The End

I came and wrote and died, an original ending stemming from my own 
immutable style related to early European phenomenology and late 
American (including Canada of course) new media content.

The Middle of the End

I extend my life through writing, this could just as easily be 
Wittgenstein's laundry list or post-mortem memo. Back to the
twitches: I haven't had any today, creating a sense of worry in 
the reader who might assume something is coming like the metaphor 
of a dust-storm just over the horizon.

The End of the End

I pride myself on the cleverness of my cleverness, in imitation of 
current writers (there must be many) who - later, rather than 
sooner (I'm always optimistic) - will inevitably fall through the 
cracks.

So a new beginning, and here I am. If I've learned anything, it's 
this - there's no way I can look around and understand everything 
I'm seeing.

Whatever I cut up will have a new beginning and a new invocation - 
where the essay begins, performing a new style, having been borne 
across any number of genres and motivations.

So again "I find myself in the middle of things" and the middle is 
always where I find myself, and is always a muddle. Like <your name 
here> I pride myself on the clarity of my words.

Aren't our words always clear to ourselves? Or we might return to 
the beginning of the sentence or book, appalled at what we have 
found, which we'd gladly erase if we hadn't already been in the 
middle of it - the middle of the beginning.

The End of the End is a phrase constituting a breath or pause in an 
essay taking its roots from what is already plagiarized, there's no 
need to go into details.

Or necessity. There's no necessity to go into details.

It's a reached point but it's also a phrase that might or might 
not need correcting. Think of correction as a place: a 
correctional institute for example, which filters language inmates 
in and out of incarceration, inmates held in abeyance.

Then nothing has changed and we might add that America (Canada 
excluded) has the greatest number of words undergoing continuous 
correction, of any country on the planet. It depends (again of 
course) since every correction is already a strategy, and has 
nothing at all to do with the greater good; in fact, goodness has 
nothing to do with anything here. There is no constitutionality in 
relation to the correctness of words.

Every use modifies every other use and so in a sense every use is 
useless.

For a newness might always collapse, always necessitate correction 
- it's the same old story here, tawdry and abject, promising the 
world but delivering nothing in its stead.

The Beginning of the Beginning

This is better, an escape clause from the thinking police, 
increasingly turning paramilitary and at the service of the upper 
one per cent of the upper one per cent. Remember they know each 
other, but at the beginning of the world everything is erased.

Being erased is also the erasure of beings and of Being, so we 
might dream of new mediums, new ectoplasms, new technologies, 
carrying us forward, but carrying us without history, without 
origin, naked except for the clothes on our backs. Did we, at one 
point, say words? Were any of them saved?

And does or will this end here?

small field tune

http://www.alansondheim.org/nsarangi3.mp3

a field tune is played within the Higgs field, the bow's waves
disrupting gravitation and the miracle of the strong force. 
the gluons have no idea where they are; they're busy operating
within exchange values among the quarks huddled down in the
molecular structures of the Nepalese sarangi, the horsehair
bow, rosin, steel, and too many other trace substances to name
or take into account. The field tune goes on forever; cramps
drive the muscles into under-drive, and the neck-wood is worn
down as the nails attempt to hold, by friction and feedback,
their momentary positions on the strings. The field tune is a
field call as well, summoning musical structures to hold their
own, at the very least in memory, so that partial completion
might occur, creating objects out of categories and recursive
phrases that announce themselves as occurrences within dynamic
temporality. After holding, they disappear. After holding, 
memory disappears. Think of the field tune as a summoning of
fields, from Higgs through flesh and the blood-pulse of the
lungs and heart; think of the convulsed or supine body in the
midst of the field, open to the sexual rhythms of the earth 
and sky. For you, it is the appearance that the music stops for
nothing, neither life nor sex nor death; for the music, it is
nothing but the field, villagers of the imaginary at its edge,
the implanting done for the season, the whole world on a very
slow verge that stops as well for nothing, and might, in quick
shift, change everything as a body falls or a baby's born. 
Nothing lasts here, not even the field tune, but the field
itself, and the tune is an object in recording, the implanting
of time itself, as you and I might be, as well, for this and 
that. the tune is calling, you are reading, answering the call
which is already over, and the planet is dark and empty, or
bright, radiated, in every case awaiting nothing, not even the
response, within the Higgs field, itself on the verge of 
failure, according to some, and according to others, there are
no such matters at all.

Disappearing Body

http://www.alansondheim.org/whirl.mov

Mark Esper's Two-Tone Enlightenment work forms the basis
of this short video. The screen presents shadows as positive,
not negative; infrared light forms the projection source 
which is read and interpreted by revolving LEDs.

The body disappears. In the video, I imitated the effect
using video echo in an attempt to erase the body almost 
entirely. Mark's piece is brilliant, and the video is a 
byproduct; I take advantage of the illumination to create
a somewhat clumsy series of movements.

Thus the mechanical is made virtual, and the virtual made
mechanical; such reversals form the core of theory povera.

when i'm down i want to get up. i'm literally haunted. 
i can't deal with the world and flatten out. i want to
die in that flatness. this time i took clonazepan. the
effect was flatter. i could live in that flatness. i
wanted to record in that flatness. i recorded a series
of getting up, some of which are horrible, and some of
which aren't, and i'm in clonazepan and can't tell the
difference and i'm afraid there may be no difference. 
what there is, this flatness, tends towards horrifying
difficulties but you can decide for yourself. i want 
to get up. so i recorded guitar, ukulele, nepalese
sarangi, sarangi, sarinda, and violin. i found bowing
difficult. i found ukulele easy and guitar difficult
because there were so many things to do on guitar. on
nepalese sarangi i went up into wails where octaves 
and other sounds might have been. sarinda is always 
hard and everywhere and still carries the dead. violin
is just that, nervous and jerky and i don't know what 
i'm doing and on sarangi, which is not the same as
nepalese sarangi, i no longer know what i'm doing. i
used the synthetic bow which made everything difficult
and i'm not sure why i didn't change to traditional
which slides less but the flatness took control. i
think sometimes bad music is more interesting than 
good music and i'm not sure any of this music is at 
all interesting but it is interesting with medication
which is a problem because i don't usually play in 
these conditions. the medication flattens a sense of
loss in my life, my harboring of death, the death of
my favor and split up of the rest of the family, and 
with my daughter there is real hatred which emerges 
from the flatness into music like strange attractors
back from the small town i was raised in. by 'back,'
they've arrived and i had to flatten them, i had to
flatten everything and then i had to get up and the
medicine flattened and then i was enabled to get up,
but then the sounds are different and perhaps i wasn't
able to do that at all, the gu* of the titles standing
in for getting up, but also the first letters of one
of the more difficult tantras, all of them together as
some sort of bad medicine which is what i think is 
within me, from birth, and then with this flattening,
almost corrosive, holding me down but giving me the
slight space to play, even though the manner of play 
might leave much to be desired, such as clarity which
only comes when peaks are permitted in one's life.

     and street noise

The street noise is increasing as the arena nears completion
- now Flatbush Avenue has been scraped clean, dug up, metal-
plated, in the middle of the night, streets closed off, 
opened again, cars stuttering by, machinery roaring, and I'm
trying to focus on these - at least for me - beautiful and
difficult instruments. The sarinda needs leisure, I think,
at least a meditative space, to play well; my nerves are on
edge and I think, how can I use this to my advantage. The 
sounds, like always from the sarinda, are from another 
space, sounds I haven't heard before, that seem to come from
elsewhere, cutting through the machinery and corruption
going on in this part of New York to everyone's delight. The
Rolling Stones will be playing! Dylan! The Nets! I'll be 
here, in some sort of strange counter-activity, counter-
production, sarinda barely audible in the chaos. I fully
expect the building to burn down, without the descent of
angels. We want to move. I'm not going to kill myself (in 
case you're still thinking that); I'm just descending deeper
into an internal chaos that has no occasion for recuperation
- there's no healing when there's no space for it. But the
sarinda clears away the noise, accommodates itself to those
other voice I'm hearing, the wailings of the dead, or of
those yet to be born, only to face the ongoing slaughter of
everything on the planet - humans, 25,000 elephants, accord-
ing to the latest issue of National Geographic ...



The Core


http://www.alansondheim.org/core.mp4

If I could back it up, I'd back it up and move elsewhere
and have a few moments of quiet; instead, this is the 
king and we are the subject; this is the object, and we 
are the citizen without rank; this is the noise, and we
are the silence; this is the Core and we are the periphery.
We try and make do and my neighbor smashed his laptop out
of frustration and water's coming through the roof again
into our place and I've lost time and space dealing with
emptiness. I'm not complaining; I'd love to leave the
planet and its Republican and ignorant horror, taking 
Azure and Ossi the cat with me, but instead, the Core is
seeping into us at 75 or 80 db and there's no recourse;
the Core is what controls the finance and the tearing-out
of neighborhoods, replacing them with Dylan and Lady Gaga,
and we keep functioning as if nothing is happening, while
inside the body, there is the whirring and slaughter of
knives, the bones sawed through, the tissues lubricated
with high-speed fluid, the machines stopping for nothing.
When the Coliseum was built, there were no complaints 
passed down to us, and ours are lost as well with clever
puns and sleepless nights and rage replacing any gesture
that might achieve something. This is the lesson of
capital: It achieves, it marches forward, and nothing 
stops it; it is as inert, as obdurate, as idiotic, as
Rosset's real, about which nothing can be said, because
even with speech, there is no speech act, nothing left
to be meant, nothing left of meaning. It is the differ-
end of the differend, a second order effect that trans-
forms capital into the very substance of the world, the
hold-fast which gnaws at flesh, animal or otherwise, 
which develops for the sake of development. Our protests
have been chimeras, have been in vain; they exist within
the imaginary, not even uncanny, not even perturbations
that demand the slightest bit of attention. Global 
capital moves at unbelievably high speed, past Virilio's
dreamlands; it pays no attention to anything, not even
flow or flux, not even the optics that carry it forward.
But it's global capital that's the Core, that's tearing
us up, permanently, and forever; accompanied by the
seizures of eminent domain, declarations of blighted
neighborhoods, corrupt rivers of multi-national capital
that remains intrinsically nameless - there is nothing 
to be done, no way to move out. The flesh is dying here,
the birds are disappearing, crime rises as desperate
people search for remnants that might keep them alive
for a while long; Ballard's world has come true, down 
to the smallest detail, as people who can afford to,
enclave themselves and gather their money and weaponry
around them. For us, we're already thrown under the
tank treads of the machine; chaos reigns and grows as
obdurate capital sits and gathers itself. No longer
intensifications or strange attractors - instead, we
have n-brane networks of surfaces that have no need 
to recognize the subject. Everything is object; 
everything is ground up; everything is slurry. We live
to die, to be replaced, although that is no longer 
necessary. And these words, like any others, are 
surplus and redundant; new meaning accrues to the
idea of erasure - for us - to annihilation - for us -
th the differend - for us - to concentration - for us.
Let's not forget the surface phenomenon of the arena
exists - for us - for entertainment only, and perhaps 
a bit of the old wilding in the neighborhood - any
thing to release tension, although in the long run, 
that doesn't matter as well. I think of these as 
dispatches from an occluded front, serving little
purpose, gathered by google or facebook or some such,
such a new way to connect. Just like the real, it's
flat, connected in its disconnectedness: the 
distinction is, it appears clever, and takes up very
little time.

Changing the high string on the pipa for a modern nylon-
wrapped steel one (replacing the nylon one; I was trying
to imitate the Tang) - changed everything with the ins-
trument; it became much more responsive, and notes can
be bent at least a minor third or so. So my play becomes
a streak, constantly changing, covering about three and
a half octaves, and all sorts of techniques - streaking
breathlessly and holding everything in the world at bay.

Thinking about suicide *


( Note: This is not personal; I am not contemplating killing
myself; I am contemplating the subject. )

We have all been here; we have all been there.

Thinking about suicide is suicidal; already a disruption has 
occurred. But thought accomplishes nothing; there is always a 
surplus, something else to be done, something inconceivable, 
impossible.

Suicidal thought organizes around anguish and a kernel; it is 
haunted thought; it is neither private nor public; it is held 
close; it is repetition without origin; it is universal; it is 
thinking through ellipses... featureless little stories.

Life is watching life slip away, and the habitus one took for 
granted.

Suicide is accompanied by a life led under erasure, by a lack of 
attentiveness, by the withdrawal of support.

Suicidal tendencies are accompanied by new environmental stresses. 
It's the personal history, as (re)constructed, that tells itself 
repeatedly, to the exclusion of everything else.

Suicidal thought wants to bring itself to an end. 

Suicidal thought is accompanied by regrets that are always already 
without closure; staying alive is being accompanied by a permanent 
wound.

The stories one tells are always obsessive, always degrading, not 
worth their retelling, not worth a listening; keeping one alive in 
the midst of these stories is itself suicidal, the suicide of the 
suicidal.

The primal scenes aren't sexual, but everyday, and they occur 
constantly, coming into decay before they begin: suicide is a 
condition of the defuge of the narrative.

One counts the summers one has left, one lives in the regret of 
abandonment, just as much as being abandoned.

There are no actions in suicide, there are just dark thoughts 
without end, that ruin and collapse the human project. For the 
suicidal, time compresses, affect flattens, it is as if living is 
a matter of tallying integers.

Right now, the violent noises in the street drown out every 
possibility of clarity of thought; the result is a searing of 
affect that cuts through, an external life that refuses flattening 
by flattening itself.

The suicide never has a choice, and it is not the end of a 
journey; suicide is the journey itself.

To be suicidal is to be among nothing whatsoever; there is no cure 
because there is no disease, only corroded stories, within which 
corrosion itself rises to the top. One might speak of the sludge 
of suicide, its abject nature.

The curtain has been drawn down long before the curtain has 
descended. It is neither in the process of descent, nor a 
finality, and it is this stickiness, this paste, that is at the 
heart of suicide.

To refuse to listen or view the work of an artist is already the 
gate through which she steps, as the words, tones, and canvas 
collapse around her. Such collapse is continuous; like paste, it 
has no beginning and ending; like paste, it is always in the 
process of drying.

Sooner or later one is exhausted by all of this repetitive 
symptomology, and that is the suicidal, not the relief of suicide, 
but suicide itself. Suicide might not be a a death, but a living 
in the abject of death, the decay and distancing of narratives 
that once gave meaning; meaning without recognition and 
affirmation is meaningless; meaning depends on the cauterization 
and separation of states; the suicidal has no such things; what 
remains for the suicidal is junk.

It's important for the suicidal that the stories are never new, 
that they're never stories, that they're endless, torn apart like 
flesh; always whole.

The worst thing in the world is one's thinking; the best thing is 
its release; like a bubble it might go elsewhere and grow. For the 
suicidal, thought decays into stutter, and his permanent traumas, 
doomed to repeat, lose their status as emotional leverage; they 
collapse, creating a floor of debris: one crawls.

For the suicidal, a cry for help is already somewhere else: an 
act, an object with boundaries, a decision. The cry works against 
suicide, and the suicidal fights that with all her strength, which 
is failing; the fight is won by being lost, by being within a 
continual state of being lost.

Debris is the condition of unrecognized collapse; the one who 
kills himself is exhausted or idiotic. The latter is an accident 
who has not lived or died her suicide; the former is existence 
itself, always unawake, prepared.

Time is on no one's side; time is only a prolongation of the state 
of suicide; it is never a resolution or denouement. The suicidal 
never dies; there is no ending for him; what occurs is always 
before the curtain; the halted curtain is in continuous and soft 
motion; it is the slow descent of a viscous fluid on an unreadable 
and violating surface of constantly erased inscription. For the 
suicidal, to speak is to gag; there is nothing to say; everything 
is sickly sweet; and uselessness has occupied the remnants of a 
world beyond recognition.

For the suicidal, there is nothing to be said; it is as if the 
suicide note were written as an object for others, guaranteeing 
for them, the others, what appears to be an object, a death. But 
for the suicidal, there is no such thing; it is always and forever 
a prolongation...

==================================================================

* Sandy Baldwin and I are co-moderating the empyre email list for 
October, on Pain, Suffering, and Death in the Virtual; the above 
is a meditation on the subject.



Precipice 

To write on suicide, or death, or suffering, is always to make a 
wager, not with oneself, but with the other: that the writing 
ultimately is not a talisman, is neither sympathetic nor empathetic 
magic, but exists in a realm of its own, where nothing has 
consequence. Otherwise the writing becomes a cry for help, something 
tawdry, beyond or beneath consideration. So the wager must be made, 
the theory must remains as such, attributed nowhere, to nothing, 
emptied, not of content, but of consequence. What, for example, would 
occur if this were the last written statement I've made, publicly or 
privately? What of the rest of my work, how would that be garnered or 
distributed? The material possessions would be given their due, no 
longer united as collocation, community, or collectivity, but 
transmitted elsewhere, fallen into other and alien hands that would  
efface the history I've taken so much care to preserve. Conversely, 
the digital would be distributed, living within a phenomenology of 
inscription and the corporate - for the digital is always corporate 
and always inscribed - and thus would be disseminated, much as it is 
now, until the material is forgotten, or the sites begin to close 
down, one after another, and everything is lost. I have no faith in 
the digital, but I put my trust there, that something would remain, 
as if in an entirety, within its aegis - that each stroke of the bow 
for example, would carry the movement of a human in its memory, that 
each sound would be the uncanny resonance of that movement. What if 
the movement were the last, that no more sound or movement would 
occur, that all that would come after would be the remnant, debris, 
residue? My father slipped away and then was gone and there is, as 
of yet, no stone to mark him, nothing but the position-in-relation, 
of my mother or other grave, or the graves of my mother's family. The 
stone will be there, obdurate, remarked, unremarked against the 
mountain where the graves are, but that absence, now, of the granite 
also marks the absence of the analogic world, as both analog and 
digital become other within new and competing cosmologies that return 
to us the inconceivability of multiverses and space-time so near the 
Planck's constant as to be always already naught, and forever, and 
beyond recall or recalling-forth. It is froth. Perhaps "It is froth" 
would be the finality of my thought, neither death nor suffering nor 
suicide, but imminent in relation to stroke or cataclysm - what then? 
That the description of froth is froth itself? I am writing this with 
closed eyes, without the recall or resonance as well of the upper 
portions of the essay; it continues and returns, but the return is an 
accident. And I must clear up the feeling that R.H. has betrayed me 
in the past, and has remained smug about it ever since - and yet he 
may well not be alive, or in good health, or even capable of reading 
this. I want to write on Azure and her work, this is something that 
has been with me, a kind of thinking centered on her arrangements and 
rearrangements, her mixture of craft and content half virtual and 
half real, as in the work for example of Ree Morton, or what I 
remember of the work of Nancy Kitchel. But Azure has remained with me 
for so many years now, with a grace I could not imagine, and a 
creativity which is always there and unknowingly bearing the gifts 
of depth of wonder, which has kept me alive, within or without the 
rubble that constitutes my thinking far too often. I am always 
awaiting the world, I am always on the verge, and as I grow older I 
fear that discovery may become nothing but murmur at the futility 
of it all. So I return, still sightless, to the original theme, that 
of the constituting of endpoints, within which one will be unique, 
and begin the recession into history and dispersion that one always 
fears. What we do with our books and belongings is continue a 
process of retardation, holding back the decay, tending them like 
good steward, so that they may yet add another century to their 
well-being. They're dependent in a way that humans are not, and we 
ourselves are not. We are on the lip or nub, not of the body and its 
abjection, but just beyond both, near the precipice where the good 
topples according to catastrophe theory; what remains in the valleys 
are pools of time that themselves seep elsewhen and elsewise. The 
only theory is that within which this self suffuses life and the 
living; theory is always theory with its back to the wall, and its 
back is our own. Thus there is the moment of loss when even 
phenomenology stutters and becomes descriptive physics at best: one 
may describe and describe, but multiverses and holographic horizons 
remain hidden, beyond the pale. We look for clues in our life, for 
our death - and clues in dying for our life. We hope there's 
something more than the scattering angle. We hope, and there's the 
precipice, and there's the end.

Barclay Center and the doomed warehouse

"A 19th-century warehouse used for pharma and other displays - I 
was able to obtain a remarkable set of images within it. It's as 
if the whole history of analog archiving were written here, just 
about to be destroyed."

within the building. 
overhead flat-belt wheels for power dissemination in the 19th-
century; these were all that remained.

left behind so many messages, so much, there were others in

death is always already present, the catastrophe.



Against Aphorisms


Facebook is loaded with them. At one point I loved Karl Krauss,
Adorno's Minima Moralia, Schlegel. But aphorisms out of context,
used as slogans on Facebook, presenting the righteous act or 
moment, are deadly; they're inauthentic in the existentialist
sense, cut off; they don't spur to action - they make one feel 
better under capital, they suture the subject with a thinned-out
cleverness, they make it appear as if something actually has 
been accomplished. The more famous the writer quoted, the better
the aphorism appears to be, the name lending false authority to
the vapidity of the words. And Facebook's aphorisms stand for
the speed-up of the attention economy; why worry about something
if an aphorism seems to sum it up in a few words that slip by,
require little thought? The aphorism not only stands in for 
action; it also stands in for the depth of thought and context
necessary for understanding, particularly given the complexities
of the world we live in. This isn't true for all aphorisms, of
course, but the short quote, the succinct phrase, gives us 
pleasure, even when we're contemplating slaughter, racism, 
violence, and so forth. At the least, give sources and urls so
that one might take some sort of action, instead of nothing more
than agreement over the superstructure of word-choice. The use
of aphorisms is as well meaning, as meaning is drained by their
use of them. We should all wake up in the midst of the battle- 
field by any other name...

My work is called For Sasha - for Alexander "Sasha" Chislenko, who was on 
Cybermind and went to one of our fleshmeets. Later Sasha committed 
suicide.

The piece is a dissected cube, that's all, with 8 points, 12 lines, 6 
sides, 1 central 3-space. The numbers add up to 27, a characteristic of 
measure polytopes; in n-dimensional space, the total is 3^n; each 
additional dimension is characterized by a "slide" of the previous one, 
which is smeared and duplicated. The points, lines, planes, and central 
solid rotate at different speeds in different directions so the cube 
probably would not re-constitute itself as a cube for a vast amount of 
time. The textures are from my 3d printing work with avatars. The sound is 
sarinda doubled. The video is made from five viewpoints - distance; point; 
line; plane; and solid. There's a sense of purity and mathesis about it, 
as well as a darker undercurrent in the audio, which sounds mournful, 
wailing.
	
The installation is part of a group show, "Systems of Existence," at 
Turing Gallery in Extropia, Second Life. The video is a separate work.

Not Yet Ready for the Big Time

but do need feedback on these -

http://www.alansondheim.org/boww1.mp3 sarangi
http://www.alansondheim.org/boww3.mp3 sarinda
http://www.alansondheim.org/boww4.mp3 violin

I'm frustrated, reaching dead ends, smashing my neural networks,
figuratively speaking, against the figurative wall. Difficult
playing without accompaniment or drone or tabla-box; every 
empty space is a vacancy. I go to sleep with headaches wake up
with more. The bowws move at furious pacing out of my control,
my wakefulness mind is crying out, dear god what are we doing
here, and nothing answers. Oh the depths of yada yada yada.
Anyway, feedback greatly appreciated. And these won't remain 
up forever or even 'that long,' too embarrassed to fail where
others succeed with their eyes and other organs closed.

34 minutes

http://www.alansondheim.org/boww3.mp3

boww3 redone, 34 minutes of sarinda that desperately needs
feedback. redone with a very short nepalese sarangi bow
which gives more control and finesse. prefer it now as well
as the music. feedback more than welcomed.

Older Sarangi

http://www.alansondheim.org/boww2.mp3

This is the sarangi I got back (is that correct expression)
after several decades and it has very heavy strings, so is
tuned lower than other, the one. It sounds it too, quite
I think good and expressive and I use the bow of the viola
in place of the other bow. The music I think is quite good
too with one mistake I can find. I'm sure it is there, but 
it is quite soothing. Today I just learned carve and crave
have the same letter, which is amazing, I must tell you. I
hope you are thanked from listening.

including three birds in the area and a video of the VIP
entrance. Nothing will ever be the same again, but then again,
nothing ever was.


Sarinda / Suroz

http://www.flickr.com/photos/asondheim/sets/72157631654252646/

Some images of the reset instrument and playing technique.
The sound if the instrument is much less tinny in real life.
Recorded with a pocket camera.



Teak

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/926
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/teak.mp3

played on nepalese sarangi, which is then raised an octave,
mixed with the original with echo. love the sound on this,
but the wood isn't teak, it might be on the sarinda, which
is a similar instrument, but not on this. jay-z's just left
the arena and there are people milling about like crazy in
the streets, every loud. but why teak then, and not a more
resonant title. so far just a lot of yelling, if they come
back onto the roof i'm to call the police. but i won't. not
at 2 a.m. anyway when people are sleeping and the hatch is
hard to open. teak reminds me of the mountains, i like the
tune and sound of the piece. could do it live as well. yes
i could, with an octave doubler and mixer and reverb, that
would work well, yes it would.



New installation of For Sasha with accouterments

http://www.alansondheim.org/newsasha.mp4

involving other objects in the space smearing &
as if in interruption of the purity of the
geometrical engagement with objects which are 
now permitted to smoke and stutter appropriately
and in addition there are those odd blanks which
cancel out, if momentarily, the entirety of this
virtual world struggling to maintain the vision
of extropian clarity and fulfillment, please 
watch and enjoy

cleverness and the clever


cleverness has the appearance of universal intelligence.
cleverness is the condition of the object in the digital world.
to be clever means to remain on the obsessive surface of the 
catastrophic, punctuated by a tear constituting the imaginary of 
a bridge.
the clever object appears to increase knowledge, but in fact 
constructs both surface and tear.
cleverness is quickly perceived, understood, and appropriated, as 
if it carried the premise and promise of depth.
the clever object is the combination of disparities, coupled and 
mapped together; the awkwardness of this suture is the clever.
clever is a level playing field guaranteeing the perception of 
knowledge's interior, sidestepping its fractal nature.
cleverness exists within the natural wilderness of the digital, 
procuring the analogic through obsessive builds.
cleverness sutures time as well, simultaneously creating and 
deconstructing a zeitgeist whose border apparently extends to 
the edges of the world.
cleverness appears boundless and sustains itself by leaps and 
disparities; it is the enemy of substance, whose depth is 
quickly transformed into the titillation of elicit knowledge in 
the midst of an appreciative community.
cleverness exchanges use value for exchange, and the 
transformation of depth is also the transformation of temporal 
continuity to the time-bite.
the obsessive-compulsive machine is employed to the right in the 
construction of cleverness, just as the time-hack machine, with 
its apparent instanteneity, is employed to the left; in 
cleverness time is never the duration of interiority, but is 
both the long-shot and/or the jump-cut, which appears as an 
exploit.
cleverness is always exploit; at its heart lies the destruction 
or differentiation of long-reading, replacing the analytical by 
the aphoristic.
cleverness thus appears to offer the world, blurring boundary; 
what might be considered technological is proffered as 
phenomenological answer and deployment of philosophical and 
general cultural concern.
cleverness is active passivity passing for action.
the clever can be grasped in its imminence, as if the aporia of 
the immanence of the world were suspect.
the clever leaves nothing and everything unsaid.
the clever is a circumnavigation of the political, drawing the 
strings tighter in its emphasis on quick construction; the 
clever is over before it begins.
the political is transformed into the manifesto and petition, 
whose contents are buried as marxist superstructure becomes 
substructure.
the clever is an image in both time and space; it is collapse, 
but broken collapse; the subject lies in the suture of the 
breakage.
the clever is an epigram whose encapsulated life appears 
elsewhere, compressed into a plane, line, or point; life and its 
history are thereby immolated; in this sense, cleverness is 
breathless.
cleverness is the wit of an object which appears as metaphoric 
totality; it breaks with the tradition of breaking; its humor is 
its suffering.
cleverness appearing during the mourning of the mourning of 
objects and their inscription; cleverness is always under 
erasure.
look closely at cleverness, and the corporate shyly appears; 
cleverness is the product and production of the sponsored world.
cleverness is likely likely; cleverness is amusing.


indix

indix.mp4 at http://www.alansondheim.org/indix.mp4 is an index,
indices, indication of attempts at video of For Sasha; each and
every one is arbitrary but designed to bring out other aspects
of the structure; rather than sending these snippets directly
to the trash I thought it would be best to assemble them as yet
another and final take of the slurry and cubic decomposition -



TEST MESSAGING THE VIRTUAL IN THE TAP FOR CYPOSIUM

It's dangerous to consider the virtual as a brave new world; the 
virtual has always been with us. The lure is the supposition that 
it engenders the potential of eternity, and escape from pain and 
death. In the meantime, the physical world is the Disaster of the 
Anthropocene. We must look, with open eyes, at the obdurate nature 
of the Real, through any means possible. We must accept our own 
deaths. I will discuss my work in virtual worlds and performance 
(with the collaboration of others) in this regard.

======================================

THE AUDIENCE

asondheim: so yes, if I draw something here, then it appears only 
here, but it appears to you, the audience

asondheim: and we can transform or otherwise modify the audience 
by creating or transforming text, which acts as a catalyst; in 
this indeterminate world, however, the catalyst onky sparks - what 
happens afterwards, or within or without the duration, is unknown.

asondheim: but it is sure that something occurs, one might say or 
write, in-relation, that is in-relation to the text or act of 
inscription, however it is carried out here, for the audience.

asondheim: So that there is a hiatus, between giving you, the 
audience, a text, and granting the crew, a program or discussion 
matrix behind the scenes, equal weight in a final text, as if this 
were possible?

asondheim: WE ARE CAPABLE OF HEARING ONE, and we assume, for all 
practical intents and purposes, that ONE is all there is, that 
there is no other: it is only by virtue of my name, asondheim, 
that I can say, suture, that both in fact exist

asondheim: WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE IS EVERYONE? Netsplit seems to 
have occurred. Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Has anyone ever 
been there???

THE CREW

asondheim: on the other hand, this is text for the positioning and 
discussion of the crew, occurring at somewhat the same time and 
place as the catalyst for the audience. what can be said here, but 
background and the specificity of instruction - as if the crew 
were capable of guiding the audience to a closer tolerance than 
might appear at first glance?

asondheim: WE ARE CAPABLE OF HEARING BOTH

asondheim: WE ARE CAPABLE OF HEARING BOTH, and I say to you 
Nicole, SHUT THE TAP DOWN, TURN IT OFF, and we will continue out 
of sight and out of mind, out of site and out of mine, out of cite 
and out of mined, on our own, the two of us BEFORE OR IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE SCREEN, the pixels muted, digital media murmuring 
only the background radiation of the universe itself.

every time i work i think, these are my last moments alive,
and these are the last things i will see, and these are the
last things i will have sown, alone, or among others, all
the world is so precious, everything so fragile, everything
on the edge of abyss
