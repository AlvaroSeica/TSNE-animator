i hunker over bunkers going bonkers
the clunkers might have sunk her flowing sinkers
 listen i keep trying to write how safety comes to all people
 in a matter of time, but i'm not doing a good job of it
i can't remember any thing in this spring
but you might try a summer to thumb her
 listen i keep trying to spread the word and call you
 in a matter of time with airborne aerial breaking down
i tire of the wires lit my fires there are fliers
fucking mires there are children building pyres
 i'll have to hide out in my tiny safety bunker 
 do please answer come and take me hold me break me
for your sake i'll suck and make the shake
and code the fake and load and quake
 please read between the lines i seek your safety
 i can't rhyme can't spell can't write
see my pretty picture come wet my pretty picture
short the circuit of the heart and lick the key

   Google Makes The Best Poetry

   Someone should study me now, "Google hacks
   are fun. They screw up every single word I put in here, just about."
   They're good at sorting documents for relevance when it comes.
   This is to make the poem seem very simple - it has a nursery ...
   Most poetry isn't out to prove a point; rather, most good poetry
   attempts a Warning Poem - Good Judgment About Warning Poem.
   I give to you my favorite poem: "The More Loving
   fences make good neighbors." Courtney loaned me a book the
   other day: (And not just for poetry. All good things are "sticky" 
   on the web.) Once, in 1994, searching
   for common words made results less fun, however following these
   words 12 Chicago Vowel Movers made

   than one search. Different searches will give you different sites.
   this opens the virtual door to ambiguity,
   love poetry web sites,
   very good, serious sites with beautiful love poetry, ranging
   from classic to - This makes me feel today is Valentine's Day!
   Probably not a very good idea in the first place combining Google
   Poem with cut-up.cgi - you've got Gysin smiling. Catch a Poet
   makes writing far more rewarding for me. They've convinced me that
   understanding
   and appreciating good poetry can't help but make all writers writers.

   Googletry. A couple of other poets and myself have
   a pretty good burrito. Google would make money through the
   program, of course, but that alone does not prevent the company from
   all sides of the spectrum, you know. But he does make one very good
   statement: How to Write Bad Poetry - Plus, topics for
   persuasive writing 
   about limitless expressions, right? So in that sense, make your lines
   a great read, make your brain work on complex stuff, In essence
   it's not a very good idea in the first place to combine a Google
   artist, make something, a poem, a word, a painting. Anyone
   interested in learning to write good poetry should experiment
   with different forms, like haikus and sonnets, etc. But first - you
   Poets potentially
   make good marketers because we read poems and ads in almost identical
   ways! Good Morning Thinkers!
   Authors benefit when they are paid for their work, not when Google
   makes money. How to Read a Poem - a good poem is like reaching a 
   mountain summit -
   Here are a few steps you can take to make the climb a bit easier.
   Writing poetry is a skill, and people improve when they allow
   themselves to make
   mistakes and learn from them. A poet who writes a good poem every time
   will make canes, an old pine in a fine spot,
   Therefore, good erotic poetry - 
   Poor spelling aside, there are elements of a good poem there, an
   ocean - good poetry about wool fills me.
   We're happy if everyone realized, all at once, that hating most of
   the poetry you read doesn't mean you don't like poetry; it just means
   the current situation with poetry makes less sense.
   I was trying to work with good material from not so good poems and
   old poems and I didn't see anything good about death. 
   The struggle, the journey, that makes poetry live and stick in our
   craw - a couple of other poets and myself have suicide poems in them.
   (say though, he could have done better than google that last line.)

   PS I had to read this poem more than once to have it make sense.
   I have always had my own ideas on what makes a good poem. 

   PS PS I still feel a need to say that I have found lots of good 
   poetry in the name of all that is good and holy!

   (Hmmmmm. That will make a few people smile and my love weep.)

Most usually you do not write me, and for those of you who are unreading, 
those of you I do not know But you are on the same wires and in the same 
habitus nonetheless, otherwise separated since the beginning of communi- 
cation among us. Always the telephone appears the last resort, only a 
century and more old, but the grain of the voice, the guarantee of 
presence however distanced. From here in Geneva, international city of UNO 
and communications, Alabama room of the Geneva Convention, I wander from 
place to place, searching for connectivity fix, tenuous, fragile, precious 
in the sense of vector thrown into uncanny space. The unbelievably small 
space of the city, perhaps a kilometer or two, is sufficient for meander 
from sleeping space to rehearsal space, that most intense communication of 
bodies in largesse prescenced within one another, the room with the scent 
of movement, emotional tensors. Like you perhaps we held our breath, 
almost in tears, as the Chinese pair skated to second place after a fall 
that would be devastating to any dancer, and is always present, the 
potential for a living career ended in one inadvertency. I search for your 
presence among the bodies here, the lived wires, the plugs peculiar to 
Switzerland for the most part, the coursing of electrical current, Romania 
and Croatia and Bulgaria loud on the short-wave. The waters from the Jet 
d'Eau course through our veins as we imagine skate-boarding perhaps 130 
meters up in a swirl of water that would break a finger faster than a 
match-stick, close down the throat, explode the body across the lake. As 
far as we can tell, no one has done this, although all our lives we're 
picking up the pieces.

to wait awhile.i noticed that there was a kind of screen or grid between 
the glass and the planes, on the inside of the glass, and it made an

back and forth to create the efect. it works better if you see it large

John Yeomans' _The Abecedarian, or Philofophic Comment upon the Englifh 
Alphabet. Setting forth the Abfurdities in the prefent Cuftom of Spelling, 
the Superfluity of Letters in Words, and the great Confusion that their 
ill Names, and double Meanings are of to all Learnings. With modeft 
Propofals for a Reformation of the Alphabet, adapting fpecial Characters

Syllableium, or Univerfal Reading Table, for Beginners, calculated after 
the prefent Ufe for the Way of all Schools throughout the kingdom. 
Together with a Difcourfe on the Word, or A-Tau, tetragrammatical, 
preceding thofe Tables._

[...]

"Words are not, as some gross ears interpret, only a grinding or chafeing 
of found of types and letters, ftriking the outer ear by the operation of 
the breat or fpirit; but they are very man or mono, principle, and very 
felf, everlafting, of infinite, dread-united meaning, the exprefs 
difpofition of his nature in the heart, and not in the inked or graven 
fign. They are fpirit, and they are life; they are death, and they are 
deftruction; and their types are purely banners to avocate and fummon the 
mind back to itfelf, when ftolen or ftrayed away, and to regulate the 
fenfes in wifdom, truth, and holinefs. The word is very God and very 
Devil, good and evil, virtue and vice; and letters are as fhadows to 
reflect the life. Herewith blefs we God, and therewith curfe we men, who 
are formed after the fimilitude of God. _In the beginning was the word, 
and the word was with God, and the word was God,_ &c. We have only ufe for 
letters now to help and comfort us in this mortal ftate; for in the 
immortal, every good man fhall be able to will at will, felf-quicken, 
felf-move, and alfo felf-comfort; always pure, always in order; at once 
hearing the most pleasant and fweetest love-chord harmony; tafting without 
fufeit ambrofia, and the all that is good, and delicious. Sufceptible of 
inbred divinity! fmelling the moft fenfible perfumes; knowing all things, 
intuitive of all things, and all in all with God himfelf. The plain 
fignification of _word, verd,_ or _green,_ or _verb,_ is perennial or 
durablenefs; being of _virtue_ or _worth-ue,_ or _werthe,_ of the family 
of _vir's_ and _viri's,_ man's name or the NAM; and nothing but what is 
virgin virtuous can be manly, or is worthy of that venerable and divine 
appellation; but differently, is vicious, unnatural, unworthy, ungodly. 
None, for this caufe, fhould open their lips unwordily; forafmuch as the

utter within, amazing languages."

Amazing languages, indeed! What a will or fpirit that muft be which 
dictated fuch to our author!

The reader will, doubtlefs, by this time, think we have difplayed very 
fufpicious marks of our author's being _non compos_; and therefore very 
incapable to draw up the beft plan, that _ever was, or ever can be 
projected,_ for the improvement and eftablifhment of the Englifh language.

     3	whether context is everything, and / 
     4	or whether there's anything at all, 
     5	other than context, after all one can 
     6	like anything, set up like a curling 
     7	shot, i went out yesterday, down the 
     8	street, perhaps the day before, i'm 
     9	not sure, past willie sutton's house, 
    10	made a short video, actually into the 
    11	memory stick at not so good 
    12	resolution, with 'this PAL' camera 
    13	i'm testing, he was the most wanted 
    14	by the fbi at one point, bank robber, 
    15	famous for something he didn't say, 
    16	the house is a wreck what with all 
    17	the development and gentrification 
    18	going on, the owner wants 1.2 million 
    19	for the property and the adjacent 
    20	one, the house will have to be torn 
      	
    21	down, that's certain, it's been 
    22	it's already falling, you can see 
    23	through the walls, looks like sweden 
    24	is ahead, rooting for switzerland, so 
    25	it's the decay of a bank robber's 
    26	home, he'll never get the money, i 
    27	mean for the property, it's about one 
    28	and a half times the footage everyone 
    29	else is asking, still unbelievably 
    30	expensive, there were toughs living 
    31	there a while ago, they wrecked the 
    32	place, i think the owner was waiting 
    33	for that, now it's boarded up, 
    34	falling apart, dangerous to the new 
    35	neighborhood, the contiguous houses 
    36	are in fine fettle, excellent shape, 
    37	you might be able to tell with the 
    38	video, i'm not sure, they're coded 
    39	for better times, it's a shaky place, 
    40	the neighborhood, going up at the 
    41	moment in terms of property values, 
    42	wait until the next terror and 
    43	everyone leaves new york, we'd go, we 
    44	we'd go too, you can reach us at
    45	http://www.asondheim.org/sutton.mpg

Four Dances: Screen, Bait, Abu Gharayb, Electric


1. Screen

Projected video with dancers before the image - as if it's a multi-media 
performance, dancers 'inserted' into on-screen narrative - but they're out 
of sync, they don't match up - the narrative falls apart, it's a mess - 
they stumble on-screen as well - it's amateurish, a poor attempt - it's 
trying to compete with the big multi-media companies - reaching beyond 
what the company can do - the dancers are angry - they're really angry - 
they're in front of an audience in a production which is falling apart - 
they didn't sign contracts for this - one of them walks off - there's a 
gap in what's left of the narrative - this continues until the projection 
comes to an end -

The video is poor, hand-held, amateurish, shaky - with some of the same 
dancers - they speak a bad pointless dialog - along the lines of

"Where's Dmitri?"
"I don't know. The Revolution is about to begin."
"I love you, Martya." "I love you too Johannes."
"But we can't wait forever." 
"No, we can't wait forever. They're looking for us all over the city."
"Are you sure they're looking?"
"No, I'm not sure. But then... I'm not sure of anything anymore..."
"That is why I love you, Martya." [...]

There is some action - anxious walking about the city - nervous, they look 
behind them, they're watching - they think they're being watched. And yes, 
they dance all of this, on-screen, off-screen. The live dancers may speak, 
try to make sense of the dialog; they can't. The live dancers may be the 
same as the on-screen characters; it would be best, however, to split the 
company - half on, half off, as if they're trying to come together across 
an impossible ontology.

Bad film music from the screen, 'programmatic.' The live dancers simply 
don't understand.


2. Bait

Either projected video or live - a nude man and woman masturbate stage 
left; they are nude, exposed; the dance ends when they cum. They observe 
two dancers -

Either dressed or nude - ballet positions, lifts, contacts, splits (facing 
audience and masturbating couple) - the dancers sexually aroused - if nude
(preferable)

Masturbating constantly during their movements (the man clearly erect, the 
woman with her hand increasingly wet, the audience close enough to smell 
the scent of sex) - if at all possible they cum simultaneously with the 
masturbating couple.

Swan Lake or some such music.


3. Abu Gharayb

Dancers act out positions of prisoners in Abu Gharayb photographs. Lyndie 
England is played by a prima ballerina, her fiancee by the lead male. The 
dance should move from position to position. At first it appears opportun- 
istic; it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to watch, as if England and 
her fiancee were becoming too involved in the violence. Faked blood, 
bruising, should be used, as well as leather masks, ropes, etc. .

In other words, a series of iconographic figures. The lead dancers try 
their best to behave as beginners - in dance, in torture. The rest of the 
company is appears reactive; they're uncomfortable in their roles (often 
nude) - broken, scraped. The audience wants more; the audience wants none 
of it.

The prisoners are arranged by the lead dancers. They resist weakly at 
best. The lead dancers appear simultaneously American and Imperial (i.e. 
of any emblematic power). The prisoners appear as Other, signed as Other; 
nude, they are the same. The prisoners have nothing. (Perhaps, but only 
perhaps, the lead dancers carry Bibles. Or there are Bibles at hand. Or 
there is a cross at hand. Or a crown of thorns.)


4. Electric

The dance-floor is covered with wire - grids, meshes, barriers. This acts 
as an antenna for VLF (very low frequency) radio. The antenna is fed 
through heavy notch filters cutting back on the local (60hz, 50hz) power 
grid; it leads to a NASA VLF-3 radio whose output is fed back into the 
space vis-a-vis loudspeakers. For one to five dancers. Dancers should be 
nude or with little clothing; they interact with each other, with the 
wires. Actions include sliding fingers and palms along the wires, wrapping 
the body (limbs, neck, penis and breasts if nude, fingers, waist), moving 
in and out of contact with other dancers. Performers should try to 
maximize sound production as inductance, etc. change. Stage lighting is 
sinusoidal, i.e. lights slowly increasing to maximum, then decreasing to 
darkness, and back again. At first this appears as 'effect,' but it soon 
establishes the rhythm of the dance.

The dancers 'worry about' the wires, about dancing among the wires, 
between the wires, on them. This may not have been in the contract. (The 
contract might have specified, however, 'any and all.')

The dancers behave as ionizations, lightnings, atmospherics, insects, dead 
and live wires, environments. Tech runs a sound-board with effects, 
including the possibility of sending the sound through AudioMulch or other 
similar programs. The dancers establish and contradict their own rhythms. 
The sounds screech and roar.

==

The dances reference projections, introjections - screens, bodies, poli- 
tics, physical fields. Elements from one - for example Bait - may be mixed 
with others - for example Electric. Screen and Abu Gharayb are resonant; 
Abu Gharayb and Bait are resonant.

The dancers are reeling, on edge, nervous, difficult, a problem, their 
desires constrained by spectacle. The dancers are on exhibit, behavioral 
codes thwarted or broken. If a dancer feels comfortable, he or she should 
push the dance further.

There are many kinds of ecstasy, violence. Ecstasy and violence, beauty, 
sexuality, and horror, interpenetrate. For the dancers, everything is at 
risk.

After the dances, the dancers should be hurried off the stage.

==

Back-stage, a room of rest, meditation, place of transformation from 
politics 'and all the rest' to everyday life. This space is inviolate. 
Dancers (perhaps) may use the room during a performance for recuperation. 
Perhaps the stage is emptied.

Video is always an emergency. The dancers emerge into (their) (other) 
skins.

Every piece may end early. A program may consist of one to four pieces. 
The specific choreography, if there is such, is created by the head of the 
company, in line with the intentions of the dance.

For Abu Gharayb, the lead dancers should be dressed in uniforms identified 
with empire and dictatorial power. For Electric, nude dancers may have 
lightning bolts drawn on their skin - drawn as children would draw; the 
bolts would blur with sweat. For Screen, the dancers (perhaps) should have 
specific character costumes; they are 'in character' - their character is 
taken away from them (by mismatched blocking, pacing, clumsiness). The 
dancers in Bait, if nude and masturbating, should dance perfectly, 
(perhaps) facing the audience as much as possible, as if - Look, this is 
what I can do in this doubling of art and arousal (as if there is a 
difference). As if - I am aroused by the audience (by you) (in the line of 
sight). For Abu Gharayb, the dancers form a closed circuit; for Electric, 
an open one. For Bait, a circuit in the form of a lasso; for Screen, a 
demonstration to the audience, acting-out for the audience.

Finally the length of the performance(s) should be predetermined only as a 
maximum, the rest decided by the exigencies of the choreography and the 
ability of the dancers to continue performing in these abject or particu- 
lated circumstances.

What is Dance?


Dance is many things to many people. Tom Zummer analyzes, with uncanny 
astuteness, its very nature. Dance is play, death, play-death, an 
eroticism essential to our nature. It is a litany of poses and sequences,
a depth of being not otherwise available. The dance presented, that 
presents itself, in the second sequence, pulses with the mystery of life.
Tom Zummer has unraveled dance, only Woman dances.

I'll be sick tomorrow at the jet d'eau where it's true bird flu.

Geneva Crossing


Had special permission to ride with the driver on the tram 12 line. So 8 
gigabytes across town with PAL smooth. Snowy as usual. Then reduced to 300 
megs just for an HLA compression to MP4. Tried for standard .mov and it 
hit 1.7 gigabytes, not very clear. Sorensen compression set at 70% 640 x 
512 or some such. Tried for .avi at Cinepak 80% but rendering would take a 
full day. The length of the thing is 36 minutes. Don't have a full day and 
.avi usually looks bad anyway. Tried for a 20x15 pixel for the Net. That 
blurred out, uninteresting. Went up to 80x60, increased contrast, close to 
zero Sorensen. That was intersted. Saved in QT and doubled looped the 
size. 13+ megabytes. The image is pointillist to say the least. But 
beautiful running on the desk, why not? You might even save it, run it 
full-screen. The original is still on the tape. The movement is perfect, 
smooth. Had to remove the sound, that added 35 megabytes at mono 8-bit 8k. 
At least you see grey and some colors. The colors are more than I saw. The 
increased contrast brought them out. It brought out Geneva for me. Thanks 
to the bus company. http://www.asondheim.org/tram12.mov .




Someone saw the northern god emanations i'm sure.
Then the darkfury came and i hurt myself today.
Now i walk badly and have difficulty eating.

We came from water molecule by molecule. In the descent of the stream, we

The Hurtling Towards Death


O Dance apostrophic, embrace death, the body fails and falters, expends 
what remains of its energetic treasure. Forestalled by documentation's 
impoverishment, your slightest gesture remains unfulfilled, latent, lax, 
amidst the machinery of calculation, rigid ordination of numbers. 

Translation of Dance, the capturing of death, its swallowing by ordinal- 
ordination, the descent to the floor or basement of the binary, what is 
analogic reproduced by raster tending towards the infinitely fine. What
is missing -

What is missing are two wildly disparate orders of calculation, of 
mobility itself, orders which only approximate one another through techne 
and speech, code and partition. One order, that of the calculated, the 
production of parallel numerical streams representing movement and the 
muscle-mind of the Dancer (who is technically _the Danced,_ the one who 
_is Danced_ by the Dance), and the other, the frequency-laden irreducible 
neural spill of mental activity, electrical, emission and spew. 

For the mind-breath, O Dance! is reproducible only by itself, maps only 
onto itself as itself, inasmuch as the ordinal-ordination-ordinateur of 
the Dance reads and writes you as input/output, perhaps infinitely 
parallel streams, nonetheless perhaps not even clocked, nonetheless, 
across that gulf of into- or onto- mappings, or rather mappings with 
continuously-modifying metrics, nano-second by nano-second, there's no end 
to it, no beginning.

O Dance! you're nothing more than the ordinary-ordination body moving 
through space, the body of itself, at rest in and of itself, the blessing 
of the incontrovertible complexity of the world, its inhering. Any 
reduction quietly speaks and conjures the factory, automaton, robotics of 
precision and repetition. O Dance! We're not speaking of life-force, we're 
murmuring the litany of the infinitely-small, surrounded by shells and 
carapaces of computers-ordinators, maternal-paternal projection against 
the pulled muscle, the sprain, the torn ligament, the bruise. And O Dance! 
We would make of you an entire world, cosmos-Dance, ocean-Dance, particle- 
Dance, what would we do with that?

Impossible of representation, humans never give up trying, violating voice 
and mind, ordinal representation (and who said nothing about the nuggets 
of the cardinal?), the numerical cut, the definition. Jump to edit-points, 
application of points, applique. An imposing edifice! Numerical-numb, the 
prisoner of flesh, the Dancer-manque-Danseuese -

Technology of stage and lights, phenomenologies of distribution - O Dance, 
dream aloud! Dream quietly!

through manifest electromagnetic waves surrounding us. through eventhis

this was a particular move (left) that could only be repeated once while 
on the right (right) is the dictionary order of nude descending a 
staircase divided in the midst of itself . ultimately, of course, the 
dancer is completely alone on the stage pronouncements, but on what? 
imperfectly, we are fastened to the world by the stage, by the appearance 
of the stage. recently it has come to our intention that we are living the 
shadow of the cave of course you've heard this all befrore (that little 
boys love women). (that lkittle boys are scared of women) that little boys 
need to be probed. that the probe is based on the simultaneity of 
repetitoin. at this point sondheim was 'in the midst of ' a system of

the world tethered by such pronouncements, on the surface of the world, 
not hardly but in reality on the surface of the fastner itself. did i tell 
you this story? about the fantasms of henri rousseau, were genevan or 
francais, in the midst of the grutli rehearsal space, simultaneous 
confession and exact resistance of logic? perhaps you have heard something 
of the island where the birds were raised?
when the phone rings you can look at the voice. 
this is true. i haven't heard from her since.

this is true. the president is in the plane.

FILMED IN PAL!
thank god that's over with. i said ok that's over with. 
the floor of the grutli is a deleuze-guattarian nomadic surface of the war 
machine becoming-woman. (it's theory, so it's ok if it's boring, 
apologies, I'm sorry). well the idea of this is that the president can't 
get into the big meeting because he can't clear security so he's stuck 
there with the rest of the iraqis.

themselves_ not among others, i.e. responsible for the central content of 
the image, Courbet's >entrance and exits from the world in the midst of 
the family drama/<===? (yes, well, chaos). i keep thinking, it's never 
enough, there's never enough images, since images = 
tethering,pronouncements, but on what? imperfectly, we are fastened to the 
world = there's no possibility of more / less in this regard - as i've 
said many times before, this is the totality of my still image work for 
the past twelve years. one can only hope for example that if there are 
sufficient numbers of such things, the bodies remain fasted.
do bodies remain fastened, ever? 
remain fasted? the anorectic body sufficient in that state, the dancer 
disappearing into the dance, the muscle disappearing totally into memory, 
nothing remains / noting remains / but memory - almost every dancer i've 
known has had bouts of anorexia/bulemia - many were abused - the dance is 
simutalenously a remembrance and a forgetting, the muscle simultaneously a 
release and a binding - "When I make these imags, I"m sure there's an 
order to them, a logical progression from one toanother. Then I realize, 
it's all a fiction, just like the narative pronouncements, but on what? 
imperfectly, we are fastened to the world this could be relayed from one 
to another in just about any direction at all and the whole will hold. " 
at least perhaps not for the viewer but in temporal sequence, which is 
after "all" a"ll we have - if you're not following this, we began 
(earlier, i.e. before this._) i.e.representation of teh blown-out 
form/ulation of the dancer < == > split / spaltung. on one side the shadow 
in the shadow of the other (shadowed by texture-mapping of the identical 
image) leading to birth: <===> Julia Kristeva would be out of a job if it 
wasn't for the matrix...
or that highly specific location in geneva where the rhone and arve meet 
with the transformation of the waters.
thank you.

Human, specifications, outline, history


1. The continuous lineage of tool-making and inheritance from the paleo- 
lithic to the present, as tools create tools; this keyboard descends most 
likely from the Mousterian.

2. The continuous embedding of human debris, effusion, detritus, splayed 
across shrinking natural zones.

3. The parabola of reification as hand-axes went from use- to exchange- 
value back to use-value from the paleolithic onwards. Technological dawns 
of experimentation.

4. The constant cultural assessment, employment, reassessment, recupera- 
tion, of the body always from a horizon of the present; the body, every 
body, organism, always already a sign.

5. The hardening and reification of signs granted amnesty, signs released 
into the environment, the rise of two-valued logics with absolute negation 
such that --x -> x.

6. The great divisions, binary, tripartite, n-ite, of labor in relation to 
circumscribed and in-scribed natural zones.

7. The fortification of symbolic divisions, divisive symbolization, as 
natural, as the world increasingly signifies, as blind-land transforms 
into landscape into territory.

8. The division of labor of reification and signification.

9. The inhering of the digital within bullae, abacus, land-grant, psycho- 
analytics of narratology, digital myth, mythical digital.

10. The growth of jectivities - introjections/projections, as culture 
recuperates symbolic surplus, retemporalizes futures and pasts into the 
continuities of spirits, deities, sprites, geological features read as 
narrative puncta.

11. The corralling and organizing of jectivites as consciousnesses, the 
rise of monarchic tendencies.

12. Coagulation of monarchic tendencies towards greater aggrandizements, 
tallies, established histories, the organization of putting-to-death.

13. Reification of war as state apparatus, in relation to signifiers and 
the division of labor.

14. Organization of revenues, food, body, precious stones, raw materials, 
manufactures.

15. Energy.

time

the face registers the passing of time and atomic clock.
or molecular or particle clock irreversible inconceivable.
space is marked out as the body re/marks within capital.
the body of vision enervated and neuraesthenia of the envisioned body.
the face is that of alterity sublimated by desire. 
the face is the gnomen of time.
the face is always in the presence of the portal.
and just so every portal is a face in its presence of depth.
these images haunted me as they are wrapped in my human skin.
i am flayed for them, their red dust, my hungry ghost.
i am listening to a speaking woman hello and hello.
good morning and good evening working late tonight aren't you.
hello hello and goodbye your face among us.
i would gladly take your position and make it my own.
incontrovertible and as yet to be reversed.
the revision yes but of the imaginary signifier only perhaps so.
or of the haunted face to which nothing may be said.
just as the haunted speak themselves and to themselves.
just as we listen sideways or left of back to haunted women and men.

Continuation of Plaint

Last night again slept badly and next week going to a neurologist about 
those twitches. Woke up full of fury and wrote this behind the barricade 
of absent eye. Work's illegitimate, the radio's on to Canada. Impossible 
musician, haven't done music in years, playing at Tonic coming up by the 
grace of someone, nails splintering, there goes the sound. Not a web 
artist because not using portal pages or web pages and not a Net artist 
because not using Java or Javascript and not an 'e-poet' since some of the 
work hasn't words and not a video artist because it's only part of what's 
done. So advertised on the film Frameworks list and no one came to the 
show from it, even film and video venues don't cut it. So never have had a 
film grant or writing grant or video grant or any sort of art grant (one 
NEA critics grant in 1976 thanks to David Antin), and with no job and no 
prospects then no monies coming in, just a little from the dance company 
and even Millennium will pay although the crowd was non-existent. All the 
time usual nightmares and shaking, it's the world shaking, not the first 
person pronouns of the eyes which are having an increasingly difficult 
time focusing but no money for glasses. This artist isn't an artist and 
doesn't belong anywhere. This artist is known for job-begging and a real 
lack of results. This artist is known for being too lurid, too sexual, too 
complex, too difficult, too much information, too edgy, and this artist is 
known for being too much a pest, too stupid, too abject, too ugly, too 
angry, too demanding, too intense. This artist he complains too much and 
he should be grateful for everything that's coming to him. His work is too 
unethical. Makes everyone uneasy and incredibly argumentative. Can't ever 
be satisfied. Doesn't realize no one is satisfied. Everyone has health 
issues. Doesn't have a monopoly on depression. Nightmares either. Expects 
too much from his family. Who doesn't have a father complex. Who doesn't 
want to kill his father. Hir father. Her father. Every day a horror with 
financial collapse just around the corner. Applies for just about every 
job out there. Applies for too many jobs. Hasn't got a clue how the world 
works. Pretends to know philosophy and pretends the work's important. 
Produces far too much. No one can keep up. Work like sludge or some sort 
of spew, garbage, trash. Frightened of his own shadow. Frightened of 
everyone's. Scared so much about death can't move can't think can't talk. 
Work too much exhibitionism. No one wants to know the details. A burnt out 
case. Told would never reach twenty-five. Told moves too fast. Told too 
impatient. Told too anti-social. Told too loud. Told too self-obsessed. 
Told too narcissistic. Work short-circuits itself. Told he's not an 
artist. Told he's not a painter. Told the litany of not-a-writer. Told the 
litany of not-a-filmmaker. Told the litany of not-a-videomaker. Shouldn't 
listen to him. Shouldn't pay any attention. Should use kill abort. Should 
use delete. Treats people badly. Just turns on you for no reason. Is 
irrational, too insistent. Thinks he's the only one in the world. Thinks 
he's the only one alive. Has no identity. Can't belong anywhere. Doesn't 
fit anywhere. Substandard. Too suicidal. Too many bad thoughts. Depression 
hurting others. Can't function around him. Cries too much. Too selfish. 
Too self-centered. Thinks everyone should care. Work incomplete. Work too 
fragmented. Writing too aphoristic. Thinks created the wheel. Thinks he's 
unique. Doesn't recognize other people. Too insecure. Thinks he's 
original. Too weird. Too crazy. Too uncompromising. Too idealistic. Too 
pessimistic. Too much of the time the glass half empty. Thinks he's a 
radical. Thinks he's the only radical. Too worried about those brain 
twitches. Far too weak. Far too neurotic. Too clumsy. Too much alone. 
Needs meditation. Needs another drug. Needs an overdose. Thinks he doesn't 
need anything. Too much junk food. Failed vegan. Failed vegetarian. Can't 
cook for himself. Can't look after himself. Thinks his work saves him. 
Thinks his work is all he's got. Thinks writing helps by virtue of writing 
magic. Doesn't believe in anything spiritual. Failed materialist. Doesn't 
know enough math or physics. Doesn't follow through with anything. Not 
good enough for Azure. Hides behind his texts.

most likely the end of the poser breakdown programs
i don't want to do any more of these
i don't want any more sexual backgrounds
there's something better on the way
 but last night i had another panic attack
i thought i was dying
i thought it was all over for me
it felt like a heart attack
what i imagine a heart attack feels like
the tingling, everything, every little symptom
i lay in bed and trembled
stress was killing me and i worried about azure
i don't want to do any more of these
there's something better on the way


Annoying


Quite a while ago, I sent out an 'annoying egrets' video - egrets stirring 
up the bottom muck in a wetlands, with their feet and wing-beating. Here 
is some similar Canada goose behavior, with a body-rocking motion. 
Annoyance seems to be a close tethering between hunter and prey, within or 
across species, light or heavy. It involves an unexpected disruption of 
every-day routines on an insistent basis that demands attention; the 
attention is often an irritant on the part of the prey, whose habitus is 
broken. While annoyance may be novel or protean, it may gain ground with 
repetition, resulting in an action of some sort on the part of the prey, 
simply to discontinue the stimulus.

Annoyance corrupts routine; it is Serres' parasite gnawing away at the 
etiquette of life. It may be creative or deadly, or both; at the heart of 
creation, one finds violence. Ultimately, promulgation of the species or 
individual is impetus, to the benefit of the neuro-physical and physical 
life of the hunter. However, annoyance is always a dangerous game; it is a 
wager that nothing worse will occur, that the hunter will survive. It 
defines the edge or lip of the real; beyond annoyance is love on one hand, 
but wanton destruction on the other.

existence, future victim of stroke


the truth slumbers, it murmurs, mumbles, inconceivably thinned. within the 
fissure, neural cleft, error in brain anatomy, this text resides, 
information episteme. if i cannot speak, if i will have not been able to 
speak, then the material, materia dejecta, remains, i will sink into the 
real, with no report, no sagacity, no cause, other than, no cause. 
sinking, i will be _there,_ unable to tell, that which i do not know, 
which i will have no longer known, void, stroke, other.

:lost body-skins resonate among internals and externals, out- and in- 
gassing, our wonder is in the face of alterity, our dissolution, 
nonetheless an obdurate. it is the capsule or pill of the real, one drug 
as fine as any Other, melding through recession, midst of inflationary 
universe and absolute disconnect. in this home of the malady, i reside, 
able on to speak the truth.

:i consider a stroke which will forthcome, transmitting the gap between 
zero and one, that of being which recedes simultaneously always already in 
residence, consider _that_ residence, on the order of a matheme, Badiou. i 
consider a stroke as neural fissure and deprivation, i will have no longer 
remembered, that of the sheffer stroke, unrememberance of simultaneity, do 
the logic.
