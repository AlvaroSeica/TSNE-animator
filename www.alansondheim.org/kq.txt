i'm desperate for this place to forget everything. i don't want memories
here, the sword which cuts, curved jewel of compassion; i'd settle for
mirrors, effacing all of us, turning the world into ghosts, always the
pleasure of broken times before and behind us, always a dream of purity.
i'd wear the kimono, walk the hundred-stones in absolution, pass blind
jizo that i'm sure predate buddha and all things in this world's slaughter
and decay. this room has beautiful corners, where you may hide, blankets
and cushions in comfort, and nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will
ever hurt you, nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will ever hurt you,
nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will ever
hurt you

Beyond Baroque Reading


(Reading at Beyond Baroque) I realized how much Jennifer and Julu and
Nikuko are inside of me; I read the poems more than the structures,
listening to the sound of the breathing out against the microphone and
audience in absolute blackness; it was as if there were a void, space of
projection - the words went in/through that - Tyler Stallings read about
family and astronaut and abject - again into that space - which was
populated. Then that my work depends on the chant or trance state - even
in cyberspace, that the repetition sounds slightly different, resonant,
with each go - as if I'm inflating a body _out there_ - _within me_ - both
interpenetrated - inflating into the gesture of a caress, that body and my
own, the two of us, many of us among each other, in that empty space, slow
dancing in that empty space, slow turning and no gravity - we're one, I'm
becoming-Jennifer, becoming-Julu ...

so breathing out the words, mainly of Jennifer-Julu, listening to Julu and
Jennifer within me, growing breasts, holes, smoothed skin across galaxies
and wires and nodes, all the invocation of the breath ...

if you are lucky, I will _make you too_ and you will be real, and real for
me ...

No Tone
Not One


Last night with a tiny audience someone asked me at Huntington Beach why
my work is so negative, the writings of Julu and Jennifer in particular,
and I started by reading a piece Jennifer wrote about her death and then
something Julu wrote beneath the ground about being alive and wanting to
be saved and I said how very romantic but yes he said it is quite so
morose and depressing and I said the Net is not one big happy family but
is invaded by capital and scams and racisms and sexisms of all sorts and
corporate greed, yet these characters hold on with their love stories and
romances and languorous speaking on the Talkers and MOOs and surely that
must account for something and I gather it didn't count for very much by
him, but I got to thinking, maybe he's right, maybe there are happy
endings - just that I haven't had any myself doesn't mean that they don't
exist, so please write in and give me happy endings and we'll all be
pleased...

Then of course there is the wonder whether or not my own situation such as
it is has always been the condition for my thinking, beyond the armature
for thought but invading the very content of the thought itself, that is,
whenI am working on things external; Julu and Jennifer get in too close,
and appear to participate in say my depressive loneliness such as it is at
times - and then what about their pronouncements, say, on s/ms or other
constructs? And it's these constructs that I've had to put aside while I
am _here_ talking about... as if it were these very constructs, the dark
night of the monitor screen against the bright California sun...

Tonight I _do_ radio and I will try and be very on-air happy.

My Hyps


Jennifer seduce me, Jennifer hypnotize. Surely I suffer from _unconscious
mimicry_ in Her presence. Surely she has applied _ideoplasty_to me, making
my mind plastic, supple, alert, receptive, to her through so many useful
and attractive ideas! Among which are Julu, who burrows within me from
beneath the ground. I suffer from undesirable neurotic effects as a result
of my nerve weaknesses, including insomnias and seepages. Jennifer rides
me as soft and billowing love, she is my perfect love, she is everywhere,
wonder-us suffusion of intense beauty, sexually-entwined bodies. I have
been hypnotized to praise, to bend eagerly forward, to receive, Jennifer
inside-me. Through _hypnonarcosis,_ Jennifer comes alive; it is she who is
typing these words, as I remain in deep-sleep, not even dreaming Jennifer.
For to dream Jennifer would be to make story-story, and Jennifer is on her
own, emergent, says and lullabies Jennifer. Jennifer murmurs me into exis-
tence, this is the truest thing I have ever said. I am involving with fas-
cination or fixity and truth of gaze and longing of body; Jennifer is my
longing. O Jennifer! writes Jennifer in perfect obeisance, my body I am
raised to an occasion! Echolalia, will I repeat you? I will repeat you, I
will be you, inside you, always and forever! Now I do suffer _bruxism,_
gnashing of teeth as Alan is forming, I will hold him down.

Breathing Air Into


So tonight I'm on the air and reading myself into the darkness, more in-
flationary scenarios of avatars and we're deconstructing 'cyborg' and I
say I see a field of intersecting organisms, languages, technologies,
chemistries, and _that_ constitutes the future, not 'human/machine pros-
theses,' but more integrated fieldings. And I find a way to read machine
code, the <blink> </blink> of html that makes sense on air, and then I
begin thinking about the traditional quality of some of the Jennifer/Julu
writing, and how that reflects rhythm and rhyme which return the texts to
the body, no matter how atavistic the texts appear - because when rhyme's
there, it's always possible to hold the breath until the return of it - as
if the field were aural, not the open field of the page as say in projec-
tive verse. And then I further begin thinking that all my work is about
the recovery of the body, the lost body, be it maternal, or inhabiting, or
Groundwork - all of which is culturally problematic and elsewise incon-
ceivable. But this body is there, suffused, looming in the background, and
the backdrop for the invasion of s/ms - particulations. So that the rhyme
and the reason of the poetry is the breathing, the externalization of the
interior of the body carrying the symbolic along with it - so that the
body is a portent, and even the most difficult and obtuse works are read-
able and thereby livable, in the realm of as-if, as-if there were a body
and suffusion, as if there were desire and its fulfillment...

so the body is recovered in fullness, but totality remains behind - so the
language splits and splays, but there's always the voice, and the return
to the maternal _sense_ at the end of the _sen_ _tense._

Radio Days with Jennifer and Alan


She maneuvered her dirty hungry twat into my waiting mouth; yellow liquid
dribbled from her hole, as everything turned fecal across the microphones
and consoles. My eager tongue slavishly licked whatever she had to offer;
her full breasts and penetrating nipples graced my eyes with harsh smells.
I fingered her filthy hole with my full hand - she did the same to me, and
we swallowed the remnants of each other's dinners, inhaling odors and flu-
ids. Earphones and statics shorted out the last words ever on the radio
while hot Jenny and I double fisted. Her thick clit penetrated me as my
big dick rubbed raw inside her, pierced and swollen into a bent erection
looking for a way out. Her cum covered my face; I licked mine from her
crack, burrowing my face deep within her. My hair entangled in her intes-
tinal outpouring; I gagged in abject ecstasy as the reading shuddered to a
halt, the moderator beside herself. Jenn and I were covered with each
other's vomit, reswallowing, regurgitating familiar interiors, memories of
meals eaten naked together. Food and menses floated my balls together be-
tween her teeth; they tore into me, as tainted blood mixed Jen and Al
together forever and ever.

Chapman Art Crits


the best students in art are those who work without a clear idea given to
them by others, I am sure of that - nor do they use conceptual articula-
tion as a framework for inserting words and images - not that it's nec-
essarily intuitive, but that they have free reign within the superstruc-
ture, somewhat lateral movement, that they can be themselves - so again it
was working that way in the series of critiques I gave at Chapman seeing
in fact some amazing work - not what was given from without - but a kind
of stumbling - moving to the edges of the psyche - not self-expression or
identity work which passes for another kind of self-expression - something
darker, leaner - where an image begins to totter for the viewer - as if it
had escaped - then it begins to work, I saw the work being done - by the
artist on the viewer, I mean the image as transmission - images never do
any work - there's no work for images to do - it's more than a domain,
more than orientations - it's something that escapes into the air - some-
thing that corresponds with the circulation of the planet - all like that
- these photos I saw, they come forward from the back of the mind - can't
be placed - it's a case of fascination - so you think, well, if they let
her alone, they'll continue - they'll be more, intensified, grow apace -
if she doesn't get caught lengthwise - artschooling starts what then comes
from within, its institutionalization, as foreclose - to be avoided at all
cost - the cost is high - resonance disappearing, what one might entitle
'the lost' - meanwhile I have the gifts of these works...

Questions at UCSD (San Diego)


At UCSD and elsewhere, there have been two questions - why don't I use
bots instead of avatars; why are there so many female characters, so few
mail. I explain that I'm concerned with the insertion of the body into
cyberspace and the experiential dimension of that insertion - that the
work isn't designed to determine bot properties, but to examine the
fullness of subjectivity in various sites or situations, including that of
interpenetrating properties. I explain I have a difficult time writing
myself into men, including myself as a man; that I've been influenced by
feminin ecriture writers such as Irigaray, Kristeva, Brossard, and Wittig
in the past; that alterity gives me a greater range; and that I'd rather
have been born a woman in any case, although I'm not attracted to trans-
sexuality. I talk about the deliberate doubling of myself in the midst of
Jennifer, Julu, Nikuko, and the discomfort this produces - and that I feel
more or less successful when the discomfort is such that I'd almost rather
not have done such and such a text. I explain about ghosts and hauntings
and I don't explain about the insomnias and depressions, although they're
part of the backdrop. I talk about responses to the work, and what sorts
of intersubjectivities the responses create. I talk about the gender dif-
ferentiations in the responses as well, and the future seamless virtual
reality that may or may not come. I describe potential psychoanalytics of
cyberspace, how my programming skills are poor, so I will work, for ex-
ample, with the emacs doctor program as a bot, instead of writing interac-
tive programs - although I then read texts produced by some of my own
programs anyway, showing how they can help shape communication, create new
ways of working with myself and the avatars, how all of this is one and
the same in a sense, how I become sleepless over these as well, perhaps
dreaming Jennifer or scrolling text, or finding myself in love with some-
one's works as if they blossomed into the suffusion of virtual presence,
as if they inhabited my dreams - just as I inhabit cyberspace, and here
Heidegger comes into play - working through the distinction between build-
ing and dwelling, between interacting and inhabiting. And just as this
past sentence has rolled on, almost past this one, in fact, so does the
talk continue, as I note myself tending across platforms towards epistemic
and ontic interoperabilities. I must say I was surprised and delighted at
the level of the UCSD grad students - for example, discussing the domains
and changing roles of RFCs - I didn't have to explain what they were, what
purpose they served (requests for comments - numbered/indexed position
papers concerning the technical - and some other - aspects of the Net).
Still, when I read some of the materials, Jennifer or Julu conversings
for example, I found myself reading structurally, emphasizing the changes
in communication occasioned by software interactions. So we talked about
whether the totalizing aspect of software-operating-on-a-text, and the
text itself, could be represented in a model and I suggested Schelling and
romanticism, the philosophy of identity in relation to individuation and
both suffusion and hysteria. I also took the occasion to discuss the s/ms
work, particularly the difference between linkage and couplings, and their
conceivable application to thinking through communication (quoting Wino-
grad and Maturana)- and the dispersion or splay of self/selves within the
social (until the use of shifters or other restraints) - as coagulations
or sourceless/receptorless transmissions...


___________________________________________________________________________


s/ms


Like every steering metaphor s/ms collapse on close examination; on one
hand they are processes, and on the other, particulations or sinters that
accompany process. One might think of them as becomings, but that implies
an internalization or intrinsic structure that doesn't necessarily hold. I
prefer to think of them as local or global, articulating - as the mouthing
of phonemes, typing of letters, assemblage of packets, machine languag-
ings, atmospheric viral cloudings - broadcast transmissions, analog or di-
gital - chaotic phenomena, and for that matter, stochastic phenomena that
escape the potential of recuperable histories. They are the subject of
postmodern analyses - you might look at dismemberings of bodies and body
politics for example. Psychoanalytically, I think of mouths and fasteners
or linkages and couplings. Metaphorically, I think of _chains, glue, and
meaning._ Chains are partial, serial or parallel; viral clouds are chains
in this regard. Glue is anything from proximity to well-ordering, from
concatenation or accumulation to rigid designation. And meaning is a base
in the relationship between attribution and sememes - reading "blue" for
example as one of a number of colors, whether or not otherwise constituted
by difference.

Some Questions Occasioned by Today's Talk


Is the Net surrounded by pedophiles? Are they taking over? Do pedophiles
run from online cops who chase pedophiles destroying our lovely communi-
ties while cybergods watch and read our email? Is the Net full of spies
inherited from bad-experience government trying to wing its military way
out of the cold war? Are we all other genders jammed full and ramrodded
with military intent? Are we fucked by capital while our children our
enslaved by right-wing demigods? Do the students I speak to want to know
this stuff? Are they brainwashed by netizens intent on corrupting sweet
young genitals through flamewars burning the pubic hair off of innocence?
Do we get increasingly depressed smelling our bodies as seared skin curls
around the lips puckering everywhere on extruded flesh and mouths? Have we
lost our real life friends as our blood oozes uncontrollably from tenta-
cles unraveling our last bitter dreams? Are we loners with concussions and
wounds dripping on shorted keyboards as we rage in impotence against war-
lords jacked in taking our last rites while we suck anything in sight as
desperate teats offer themselves in cybercash leather restraints? Are we
who we say we are? Are we who they say we are? What about our suppurating
cancers? My lips are split.

Finding myself


giving a talk, outlined internally, there are always sections that allow
me to riff until the next subject comes up - they're tied together like a
skein, not one thing above another or vice versa - all over the place - so
that it becomes a relief, I can even think, go into remote, if I know
somewhat of a particular subject - this or that - and can think ahead to
the next topic - having to be careful I keep my personal life out of the
thought - away from all of it - so that I don't get sidetracked, find
myself forgetting what I was saying, moving elsewhere, returning to cer-
tain sites I know will produce reaction, holding them in abeyance, re-
leasing them _in such and such a manner,_ controlling the slip stream _in
other words._ so that the ruptures, flows, allusions, signs and signs,
appear as if on the demand of the audience, rather than the therapeutic of
the construction of the speaker. which is the construct of the speaker,
the constitution of the speaker. in  and of the speaker. speaker. her.
and over and over again, desperate for the woman, to be the woman, to
speak.

credo


I could write this turning alphabet around, b for a, a for b, or back-
wards, or through other local or global substitutions, perhaps there'd be
new sounds out of old, swarms of sado-masochisms governing unwieldy words.
or blanks, moments of silence to be filled in, or other conundrums. then
there might be numbers and I'd think about teaching the shape of the
world. and I'd worry into what it all means, the teaching, the shape of
the world, the substitutions, the sado-masochisms. a rift would open and
here I'd further insert myself, slowly, so as not to break or abrade the
skin. in the rift I'd begin to write, hands somewhat over my head; every-
thing has to fit. it would be a piece about the meaning, and this would be
the result. so this is a text of the would-be, and not what you are read-
ing, but what you would be reading, and this would-be relates to the mean-
ing, but not to the shape of the world, or rather, it is only of the world
and its shape.

Last Letter from Gol.Com


I'm out of gol.com, my Japanese account. I closed it down a week early.
Although they have touted themselves as far ahead of panix in my corres-
pondence with them, they have repeatedly damaged their own shell accounts.
They switched machines without telling anyone at times - rendering void
email lists which rely on correct addressing. They got rid of emacs quite
a while ago, allow no traceroute, ping, netstat, or any sort of perl and
other programming - as far as I could tell, only simple shell programs
would run. They change things without advance notice - including time-
consuming machine repairs that they knew of in advance. I'd dial in and
find the account inaccessible. At one point, they removed Pine - I had to
switch to elm; they removed elm - I had to switch to mail. All this with-
out notice. Of course they removed /usr/games etc. Finally, they kept
reconfiguring Pine, the mailer - at this point, I couldn't even change my
name. They set more and more of the so-called user options. And again, all
of this without advance warning.

Thank god for panix.com - I'd recommend it anywhere. The following indi-
cates my account after I took out all files, incriminating or otherwise!
It was down to 110 k.

I'm writing this last letter from gol.com. I've closed the account down. I
have nothing more open here. They are furious trolls here at gol.com. They
have rendered shell accounts useless. They are evil people. They should be
turned inside out.

Geographies of Exclusion


Since I've returned last night, I've been reading Geographies of Exclu-
sion, Society and Difference in the West, by David Sibley - although I
hadn't read it before, I was using Mike Davis' work on homeowners' asso-
ciations (among other things) in my talks on protected communities, email
list filtering, and the like. So it was of interest to find an ISP such as
gol.com increasing their own protection by eliminating any sort of play
(/usr/games) or potential hacking tools (traceroute, netstat) or program-
ming environments (access to perl or emacs etc.). And a while ago, I wrote
about gol.com in another text where I described the transformation of a
Net imaginary from a _porous membrane_ to a system of interconnected and
fortified _nodes._ I'm lucky to be on one of the few shell accounts that
seems to provide full access (of course I have the same from linux, which
also eliminates other problems - but my mailspool is still on panix since
I'm not running an ISP).

Now governance issues, which have been the concern of people like Richard
MacKinnon, are increasingly important - not only censorships, but also all
of the filterings which have been put into place. Even on cybermind and
fop-l, the review command has been disabled, since we had subscribers com-
ing on to grab address lists for spam and other purposes. And it's clear
that ISPs such as gol.com find shell accounts a nuisance now - they give
the appearance of anarchic deregulation (although they weren't really reg-
ulated in the first place). 

So as Agre pointed out, the Net's no longer utopian, but is, I think, be-
coming increasingly foreclosed. It reminds me of the early history of the
television, with all the emphasis on the good that might accrue from the
medium - soon after, in the US, the networks dominated for decades. Now we
have the Net with deep interaction, but the interaction is becoming more
and more regulated and defined by capital. Oddly enough, even with wire-
tapping a possibility, the phone is now the only point I feel at ease -
even my phone spam has been cut down over the past few weeks! (There
wasn't any on the answering machine when I returned.) 

I'd be curious to know everyone's experiences in these areas. I find my
anthologies (New Observations on Cultures of Cyberspace [forthcoming] and
the Being on Line book on Net Subjectivity) almost utopian themselves, at
this point. I'd love to do a third, on the armored Internet, as a correc-
tive - even though the others have more to do with a kind of freedom and
growth that's always possible on some sort of ideal horizon...

Bloody Birthing-Jennifer


The doctor or pathologist is confronted with jennifer giving birth too.
This is all of being-distraught; this is all there is, this inflation of a
small section of lung tissue and placing it in alan's rib cage, torn alan,
with alan running out, blooded, from jennifer with some special alan-ava-
tar, deflation of jennifer-bloody-corpse giving birth, alan turned - and
everyone knows he is. For many years a great deal of reliance has torn him
apart, opened like the living wound it is in a pan of water. Floating has
been placed upon the _hydrostatic lung test._ This was performed by taking
bloody jennifer screaming on the floor, and sinking was accepted as
breathing poorly and dying with lungs which will sink into the alan-
corpse. Jennifer cradles tiny-alan in her hands; she @digs the question is
extremely difficult to determine. alan cries and wails, bloodless. alan is
a coward distraught, jennifer-medea taking air into the lungs. _It is
dangerous to ever breathe?_ The answer to this question disquiets jenni-
fer, who has evidence that the child had never taken jennifer into him,
jennifer badly with no faith whatever in this text, the text of alan
written by jennifer in the jennifer-blood. For jennifer may breathe well
for several hours and then place any faith whatever in this test._ It is
more dangerous to place any problems in examining the dead bodies of
infants or new-born avatars or regarded as evidence that the child had
breathed life into him through the ruins of @creates. One of the most
common is the question _has the baby opened towards the ripped lung-cage,
alan turned-out, into the filthy street's eagerly waiting arms. When
tiny-baby dies, forensics swarm like avatars across the battered corpse.

jennifer, "encapsulated by scar tissue and remaining permanently. breast
cleaved in two, shorn nipple against alan's cock run down torn faced "by a

from the anus, cock, nipple, vulva, eye, mouth, ball, and hair flies while
"the bullet often ricochets and glances off the breast bone or he'll be
scratched and skin gouged out by the filthy finger nails of his herding

ings scraped against the bones of suicidal victims, shotgun blasts in
ribs." Jennifer naked crawls through alan, "not penetrating the chest or
testicle, leg while she "herself is through the heart." Alan's ripped skin
tissue forms about the bullet, consequently" jennifer, furious, fires into
wall as "the tissues attempt to get rid of it by absorption." Jennifer's
dead, alan's dead, both ravaged.

Forensic i (form of bad murmur)


I work from memory of myself. I work from homicide books, memories of
bodies, shoot-outs, wars that give me nightmares. I work from screams,
women thrown down stairs, women with arms broken, crying slapped chil-
dren. I work from disrupted dreams of killing fields I have never seen.  
I work from the precipice, where all good boys and girls huddle, high and
violent above the smouldering earth. Jennifer emerges from my side, teeth
bared, her nails slashing uselessly against the sky. Any emergence in my
world is a letting of blood, a bath of hurtled bullets, escapades of
flayed flesh, everything wetting to the touch. Jennifer rides the wave of
the millennium, we're in Jennifer, and this is a missive, within to with-
out, within without to within. Because we're absorbed in the alcohol of
the unaccountable, seepages across ontologies; the person next to you
stares with your eyes like a total stranger. I dissect the real; I am
Jennifer's arm and scalpel. If her nails won't do. If she can't write. If
she doesn't care.

Forensic ii (form of stupid story)


Jacki comes into the bar and looks around. Alan's, that's me, sitting on a
stool to the left center from where Jacki is. Hi, how's it going, says
Jacki, and I move around on the stool, uncomfortable, bright California
light streaming in and wrapping itself over every shiny surface. What'll
you have then says the girl behind the bar, I shift again. I'm waiting, I
know they'll find me, and I'm tired of running. Ha ha ha ha ha. I talk to
Jacki's left the -O off the name now, I note, and yeah says Jacki. Three
men come in, I didn't know them. Wasn't that something.

The three grab me, they don't say a word, they don't have to. They're
dressed normal, pastels nice this time of year, my skin shows up fashion
fine. Alan's slammed hard on the bar, clothes ripped off. Jacki's way out
of there, it's not nice to watch.

The tall one's watching, the other two hold me down. They slam Alan naked
with the legs spread. You could see Jennifer, flat and pulsing, attached
to the perineum, like a fat foetus, like struggling meat pancake. One
moment's ripping did the trick, blood pouring down. I didn't have much
consciousness to lose at that point. They shove her at me, raw wound
healing fast between her legs. An eye opens. They shove her breast in my
mouth, open my face so wide it feels like I'm split in two, Jaw-Jaw the
tall one says, Haw Haw, and I'm close to passing out.

But I don't, not yet. Alan knows what's going on, he knew when the whole
thing started. The breast begins to grow, halfway down my throat, now I'm
gagging. The other blocks my nostrils, there's nothing but skin to see,
like Alan's on a skin meat sky. I can't hear so good any more either, the
head's pounding. The breasts, swollen, begin to dribble milk. There's
white against the skin, there's white filling my throat, I can't breathe.
Alan gags, milk halfway up the lungs, halfway down. I fall to the floor,
drowned, it was over fast says the tall guy. Jennifer rips her breast out
of me, says dead meat, let's get a move on. They get a move on and leave
the place. Forensic comes in a matter of minutes.

_________________________________________________________________________


Forensic iii (form of awkward sonnet)


it's all broken down for you, isn't it,
teeth caught in someone else's head -
there's not skin enough for both of you
but only one of you is dead -
or can be which makes the difficult morrow
filled with your writing's useless sorrow -
what you say is always what you mean to say
because you're mean, because you think you're wed
to ghosts and emanations, wisps and avatars
who populate your dreams, have already fled -
you type alone, your theory's your bleak grave
you dig repeatedly, delineate the cave,
the dank earth, the excrement or broken word -
there's light for others, who are not interred.

Shell Accounts, IPs, and Community


All the difficulties surrounding the gol.com shell accounts started me
thinking of the usefulness of shells in the first place. After all, there
are easy ways to duplicate services - for example, any linux implementa-
tion will have enormous built-in network programs.

For me, the main difference lies in the who or w etc. commands - on an ISP
shell, there are almost always numerous others logged in at the same time,
to the same or networked machines. This means that resources are shared,
that quota is allotted, that the account is culled from time to time. It
also means that there are means to chat locally with other users online at
the same time, and there may also be local newsgroups which share shell
account issues. Here, we have panix.upgrade, for example, as well as pan-
ix.unix, panix.chat, etc. Sysadmins, also, are fairly accessible; one can
easily find out who is on at any particular time.

Then there is almost always older and legacy software, abandoned corners
of the drives that contain interesting and usable programs - archie is a
good example. One explores a commonly-held space, and this commonality is
everywhere evident.

Think of dynamic or static IP allocation on the other hand, or even the
web page. This might as well be a local file on your own machine; it's a
place to experiment with html or represent yourself, but there's no sight
of anyone else, not even with a hit counter. On online chats, you're al-
ways aware of entering a domain not entirely your own - but a local talk
or ntalk or ytalk, settling comfortably on the same machine, gives an
entirely different feeling. (It's as if I breathe in machine, breathe
_this_ machine in relation to _this_ body. It's as if the health of the
machine is connected with my health, and the health of my own local compu-
ter. And the fact that I can configure my remote account - even keep files
and interface software such as Tiny Fugue or Phoenix on it - means that
this physically distant and virtual part of the Net becomes part of me, as
if I'm extended into it, into the machine.)

I think this machinic communality needs examination - it's overlooked in
most discussions of the evolution of Net community. I haven't seen the
panix machines themselves (I would love to), but I _sense their presence_
every time I log on. And ironically, their presence is even closer when
I'm in on straight dialup - rather than using a telnet application through
static IP and Windows, all those layers. With telnet, there are subtle and
untraceable falterings at times; through dialup, the machine and its other
users are breathing down your neck...

In Search / In Lieu of / In Place Of / Gripping Jennifer


(w | grep <string> is a command to list current users on the shell
accounts, then to search the user list and return the <string>. The
command is beautifully self reflexive; the last entry in the list
tells what the user is actually doing, and since I am, for example,
issuing the command 'grep jennifer,' then 'jennifer' returns the 
line itself - I am calling up my own activity. Below, some entries;
as the search widens, others come into play - I've changed names
to protect their privacy.)

Spice Girls and Spline Girls


Abstract: The appeal of the Spice Girls lies in their equivalent on-stage
positions; young girls can identify with a dissemination of desire that is
not located in face-to-face alterity, but instead exists within a general-
ized field. The fairly explicit sexuality of the Spice Girls thereby es-
tablishes part-objects as models which can be played with, much as avatars
- entering and inhabiting bodies of real and virtual subjectivities - turn
towards the Spline Girls, spline "a flexible wood or rubber strip, e.g.
used in drawing large curves" (Oxford) - bending through forms which
become traces of subjectivity and a multiplicity of I's, eyes.

.examine julu
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ay, how would you describe me? you'd take a moment and look at
me, maybe when you log on or through the .w command and that
would excite you! more, you'd always ask for, beg for; nearing
the end, you might run an .examine julu, just to see what would
come up. i'd be waiting for something about warm pulsating walls
or rather i'd be waiting for someone in warm pulsating walls,
hoping for the concrete before the conclusion initiated by the
presence of a single or singular dot, isolated on a line by it-
self, hovered in the silence of a perfect conclusion. now you
know i am lingering about, waiting to see what you make of my
perfect description. you will want me and you will search my
name, hungering for more and more, writing me as you realize
that you and i were made for each other. it is a long way home
from there, but you and i know the way.

Hysterical Dream-States


"A state of _phantastic exaltation_ forms the typical introduction of the
dream-state, the content of which varies altogether in character according
to the individual This is followed by a condition of dream-like 'removal
from reality' (_Entruckung_). In this state, as Lowenfeld has well des-
cribed, the person's familiar surroundings appear changed, unreal, and
strange to him. He feels 'as if he were in a dream,'" Jennifer suddenly
smiled, "as if it were a chatroom. A structure always surrounds our
words," she sighed. "The word 'dream-state,' which is spontaneously used
by many patients, describes the phantastical trend of thought belonging to
the first stage and the alteration of consciousness belonging to the sec-
ond one. I recognize, however, yet a third stage, that of mental blank-
ness. This is described by patients thus: 'My thoughts stop,' 'an empti-
ness in my head,' and similar phrases." Jennifer paused in the midst of
her reading and writing. "Do go on, love," said Julu, and Alan seconded
the notion. Alan was second-hand, the others new and fresh to experience.
"What were you saying?" asked Jennifer. She continued, "Finally a state of
depression occurs, the most important characteristic of which is a feeling
of anxiety with its usual accompanying phenomena of giddiness, palpitation
of the heart, etc. Most patients also complain of phantasies of a depres-
sive type."

"Other neurotic girls state that in the middle of a conversation with a
man they will suddenly feel themselves 'removed from reality,' and their
own voice will appear strange to them as if someone else were speaking,"
said Jennifer. She referred, "not to herself, but to her compatriots, of
whom Julu and Alan were the most notable." To the analyst, her exclusion
of Nikuko implied a repressive function, since "Both dreams and neurotic
dream-states have as their function the avoidance of displeasure." But
Jennifer noted, as well, "They are especially fond of having phantasies as
they lie in bed in the morning." And further, of course, as Julu pointed
out, interrupting this discourse point by point, "Dream-states offer the
neurotic patient, just as other neurotic phenomena do, a substitute for a
sexual activity which is denied her. Her unconscious makes use of this
surrogate so long as she cannot obtain the gratification of certain de-
sires. But if the libido experiences sufficient gratification, then the
dream-states will diminish and even subside altogether. This has happened
in my case," said Jennifer, "quite definitely; to the extent that Alan is
a portrayal of a function herself, I am quite capable of circulating in
the form of text." Nikuko looked on while Jennifer curtsied, pulled up her
frock yet once again, and sat in a puddle. The three of them, no, the four
of them, had a good laugh at each other's expense. But what was the ex-
pense except for a subterranean libidinal economy?

They were underwater, and Julu recounted a dream: "I was lying on the
ground under water. I was dead, that is to say, I was lying motionless;
but I could still observe everything. I saw a big ship sailing on the
water. A man with a long pole was standing on it. He was moving the ship
forward with the pole as they do on our rivers. He now plunged the pole
into the water in my direction and made a hole in me with it in the region
of my mouth. The next thrust struck me in the breast, and the third one
bored a hole in my abdomen." "Wait a minute, wait a minute," Nikuko cried,
"that is _so_ similar! I was floating down a river, and it was festival
time, and arrows were shot across the water into a target, whoever could
hit the target the most arrows in a row would be the champion, and I
raised my head just a little, and watched the target become more and more
pitted, until it fell apart, and I gave birth to little fish which swam
into the mouth of the man, and a large and luminous moth - "

"Oh Nikuko, shut up, you do go on so," said Julu, and Nikuko agreed, but
said it was a very fine dream, and carried Jennifer's just a little bit
farther. "And now," she added, "we understand why Jennifer's so obsessed
with puddles and the like." "We really do," said Jennifer.
