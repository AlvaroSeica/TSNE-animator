Any group of people and anywhere


The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were all good people 
and went to Heaven. They died but did not suffer. They died because Jesus 
Christ called them to Heaven. They went to Paradise as proclaimed in the 
Holy Books. They are attended by many servants. They play harps. They are 
among the blessed.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack did not receive final 
rites. They will wander the world forever. They will wander until they are 
reborn. They are suffering without extreme unctions. Whether they are good 
or bad, they are suffering and suffering. They are in Purgatory. They are 
reborn as mendicants. They are hungry ghosts. They are red dust.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were evil. They 
deserved to die. They were infidels. They were capitalists. They were 
unbelievers. They will go to Hell forever. They are permanently dead. They 
are reborn as vermin. They howl forever because of their terrible deeds.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were neither good nor
evil. They were like any of us. They died because they happened to be
there. There is no god and there is no order in the world. They will not
be reborn. They are gone forever. They are not in heaven or hell. They
have no souls and nothing will remain of them.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died because of the 
unborn which we are killing in unprecedented numbers. They died because of 
gay rights and feminists. They died because the liberals have let this 
country go too soft. They died because there are too many people here who 
aren't patriotic. They died because this country is Godless.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were fated to die 
there. It was their destiny and has nothing to do with their ethics. They 
died because they had to die. Perhaps they are reborn and perhaps they are 
in heavens or hells. They died because it was their fate.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died for something. 
They died for freedom or something else. They did not die in vain. They 
died for some future goal. They died for some future good. We do not know 
why they died. It is not for us to know. 

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died for reasons 
known to God. God is good and powerful. God would never do wrong. We 
cannot question God or His ways. We cannot hope to understand Him. We can 
only hope to live within His Grace.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack just died. There is 
no reason for it. Reason has nothing to do with it. The people died 
because of history and politics. The people died because of a madman's 
psychosis. They died because of a clash of civilizations. They died 
because of paranoid behavior. 

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died at the hands of
a cult. They died because of one man. They died because of a conspiracy.
They died because of rogue nations. They died because other people wanted
to destroy the World Trade Center and everything it stoods for. They died
because other people wanted us to suffer. They died because other people
wanted them to suffer.

There is no reason for anything. Causes are broken causes. At the limit of
understanding, understanding disinvests. At the limit of understanding,
the concept of understanding itself is annihilated. It is not incompre-
hensible; it escapes comprehension. It is part of the substance of the
world. We are all part of the world's substance and the word's substance.

We cannot reside at the limit. We construct. Everyone has narratives which
help them survive. The trajectory of the narrative has nothing to do with
the inertness of the world.

With the World Trade Center attack, we have come face to face with this
inertness. It is as if inertness speaks. Its mouth is filled with dust. 
It is incomprehensible. Its mouth is filled with dust.

difficult to write hanging specifically from several hairs of the bin
 Laden beard
  from this vantage point it is clear that whatever i write today will no
   longer be true tomorrow    
    it is from here nonetheless that i can only ask, should we not, so
     specifically, drop parcels of food so as not to make a mockery of
     relief workers, and instead leave people in a worse situation, if
     that in fact is possible
      and from the other nostril i would like to ask if we should desist
       the air land and sea campaign and admit defeat in honor of our
       several thousand already dead, but excuse me while the bin Laden
       beard does its duty in the frequent sipping of coffee, it is
       difficult to stay awake in this place when there is so much noise
       outside
	and i can only ask, should we not, so specifically, keep up our
	blockade of Iraq, which hardly makes a piece of literature, but
	does a reasonable job of killing the innocent children, and
	should we not, so specifically, keep up our full support of Israel
	no matter what horrors are committed on both sides, instead of
	positioning ourselves equally towards both Arab and Jew
	 i am getting sick swinging back and forth, there must be some
	  praying going on, should we not recognize Cuba and drop our
	  embargo, it is there just off the shore, waiting for trade and
	  Bueno Vista audience
	   this constant praying gets me sick, everyone throws Korans,
	    Bibles, flags, and human beings into the mix, when i sleep by
	    the left part or the right part, it never ever stops, surely
	    whatever god there might be is sufficiently vicious to let us
	    fight it out in its dubious honor
	     i must be moving now, one can only hope this beard holds
	      still once and for all, where have all the animals gone,
	      where have all the plants
	       he has named his beard The Furious Slayer
		there is anthrax hereabouts, i will be gone in the white
		 ghost of this death, let us leave life to another,
                  i'm getting dizzy, don't like hanging by a hair

I've not been participating recently so much, for which apologies - I'm
worn out and at the edge of a literal breakdown here in Miami, trying to
hold on. And in my work I've been doing things in Mathematica, a program
for Mac/PC/Unix/Linux - I have it on 3 PCs and a Mac G3 now - because it
creates an ambience I'm interested in - the ability to work closely with
structure in relation to transcendent or content - the content on one
level is nothing more than a residue, and on the other, it's the membrane
which evidences submerged operations. You can import various graphic
formats into Mathematica, then process them in a number of ways - matrices
for example (which are, in a simple way, present in Photoshop as well),
and functions - the last fascinates me. So a.jpg becomes f(a.jpg), and as
a function, it can be modified - its parameters can be modified - in a
number of way; the result on one hand is often a transformation that I
haven't seen before, but on the other, is a representation of an intricate
relationship between mathesis and what perceptually passes for the real.
Take hole.jpg, make hole = f(hole.jpg) and do a transformation on normal-
ized values and you might have (1 - hole) as the negative, (hole^2) as
high contract, (hole^.5) as flattening, etc.; but you can go farther with
the x, y, etc. coordinates - as if a calculated blast has transformed one
world into another - with information often lost, sometimes gained (over-
lay something with tangents and you've got additional peaks everywhere).
Beyond that, 3d mappings are possible, so that hole.jpg becomes a remapped
3d object or anti-object; the world is a charred world, a world turned
inside-out. In addition, you an export audio from Mathematica, and if you
work with tangent values again, as well as > 40,000 hz, you can use beat
frequencies, harmonics, subharmonics, all related to the program, your
hearing, and the machine, interstitial objects which often need no further
processing; everything is equivalent. Now I would want to take a slice of
a 3d anti-object, then a sheaf of slices, and construct audio from their
sequencing - or one might begin with an entire sequencing, producing audio
as well as an implicit three-dimensional object traversed by one or
another parameter.

All of this is a safe and perfect world; there are no errors, or errors
may be easily corrected; if something proves a blind alley, I can turn
elsewhere, create a different direction, withdraw from unknown functions
and objects, back into familiar territory. An enormous amount of memory
seems necessary for all of this, so rendering takes longer than even
Blender, but there is a comforting specificity in the results, a knowledge
that noise, randomness, death itself, can be beautiful and self-contained.
There is a relationship between all of this and my own demise or potential
breakdown, which I relate to the crystalline wonder of a curve or surface
- the sequencing of the Visible Human Project comes immediately to mind.

So I am making disks of images and sequences and sounds on mini-disk and
releasing them, thinking them through; some of them may find their way
into online directories. Meanwhile I am writing through these, as well as
writing through other surface-to-air, air-to-surface phenomena, trying to
make sense of a world, that, for me, is not utterly changed, but utterly
the same, with a semiotic war above all, in both senses of "above," going
on at the moment. I recognize my own broken existence, how impossible.

Then I can turn in the middle of the night back again through the sexual
video and images, into perfect mathesis, transform one sexuality into
many, one pornography into many, avoiding the pornography of violence,
taking a different path. I'm platonist to the extent that I believe, long
after we're gone, the machinery of mathematics will continue its intimate
relationship with the mechanism of physical or material reality; working
in the realm of number offers a glimpse touching on the asymptotic horizon
of subjectivity and the final bursting-point of perspective.

And I wonder - what is the phenomenology of (1 - hole), when there is no
content for the filling or the asking, when proper names and constants
have disappeared, when the "-" is a lever or a surface, rather than
subtraction or dash or identity assignment? What is keeping 1 and hole
apart - what is the normalization that involves the entirety of the world,
dis/played or di/splayed against the corrosion of blank space, virtual
particles, decathection degree zero? The equations converge and veer;
there always seems to be chaos as the computational limits of the machine
are approached, and one or another equation takes forever to calculate,
until memory, real and virtual, is exhausted. Then the program stops, and
the kernel of Mathematica (which is constructed like an operating system)
shuts down;  nothing waits for anything in this condition -

The Story of the Rays


There are many kinds of Rays in the world. It is Rays from our eyes that
give us the gift of sight. Without the Rays, we could never see anything!  
The Rays are heated by the sun and make everything visible. That is why
you can see things when the sun is out, because the Rays are hotter then.
Rays from our ears go in search of things to hear. When they find these
things, they touch them softly and the things will say things to the Rays
that will take them into the ears. These Rays are different from the Rays
from our eyes because these Rays go back and forth with sound. It's "how
we hear." There are Rays from our nose that are like straws or open
canals, no one knows. These bring chemicals into our nose and guide our
sneezing. They go searching everywhere for chemicals. When they find them
they bring them into our nose. There are Rays for every pore in our skin
and these are amazing because they are shaped like tiny cones and they
look for things to touch and when they find them they will take them back
into the touching-area of the skin. All of these Rays are going back and
forth all the time. There are Rays from our vaginas and penises that take
chemicals and look for Rays coming from our noses and when they find them,
they send the chemicals into the nose Rays, which are sometimes like open
canals, and gravity keeps the chemicals in place as they rise to the nose.  
There are Rays we find "troubling" from our anuses which come from a very
old time more than a hundred years ago when said where our farm was by the
smells we left on fenceposts and wagonwheels, and these Rays would go into
the nose through the nose Rays that were like straws and kept the smell so
some could say if they could speak back then and they couldn't, that yes,
this was where someone was growing corn and sheep. But the most important
Rays are those from our mind which go out in search of God and bring Him
back to us, and God smiles on these Rays which are everywhere, if we only
know how to look with the Rays from our eyes and the Rays from our ears.
For the Rays from our mind are always in search of higher truth, if we
only know how to understand them. We shall look within ourselves to know
so many things, if we will only be quiet and listen to the Rays from our
mind. These are indeed "The Story of the Rays."

sad poem of propriety and sentiment


the last lonely man breathes the last free air.
he meets the last lonely woman and she is singing.
she is singing about clean and pure air.
she says

the air is always clean,
the air is always pure.
we are creatures in this lonely world.
we never obeyed, we always breathed.
in and out, in and out,
and we're still here, and we're still here

the last lonely man breathes the first free air.
he has awakened from his slumber and he knows
that the last lonely woman is singing the truth,
oh why did no one listen?
oh why did no one listen?

there's a voiceover with a beautiful voice.
the voiceover says
everyone was scared to get sick and die.
everyone was scared to breathe.
so everyone held their official breath
in their official space,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation

the last lonely woman said nothing's true,
you're making it up again, just like before.
in truth, billions of us are living,
we're not lonely at all, we have good times,
i come back from shopping and this is what
happens.
get me out of this poem, you don't
even capitalize, what's wrong with you?
aghast, I

Wen-chi song is already old news, nomads pass by, decathect texts, that
was yesterday, was this morning, that was this afternoon, that was last
week

this death of mine slows to a crawl, almost stops, did I write that, did I
read this, did I remember to send that, did I remember to receive this

to remember to receive, not to be there, not ready, but to receive upon or 
within the memory, always the future anterior, always as if about to be 
corroded

untraceable

it's decathected, disinvested, the knots are loosened, strings unravelled, 
silkworms gather up cocoons, roll back to chrysalis, ready to receive

to receive the old news brought by the nomads

antennas receiving the news of my not so recent death

diary anguish


late night now can't sleep again, ill and "em"iserable, fall off a cliff
into black night"em"are, always the sa"em"e, azure and i so"em"ewhere,
she's off with other people, they don't like "em"e, i behave badly, i
can't find her, i'"em" e"em"barrassed, asha"em"ed, i never could handle
situations well, i'"em" holding her back, she should leave "em"e, there's
no excuse for "em"e, no excuse for "em"y actions, there's a war on, these
feelings are trivial, i drea"em" of white powder death and read han shan,
i stu"em"ble to "em"y feet and crawl to the keyboard, i write one thing
than another thing, i hope for reconciliation, nothing happens, "em"y
thought is stillborn, there are lying faces on the television, i live in
disorder, "em"y philosophy is buried beneath the terror, you'd have to
scratch away the terror, you'd have to rip the face off the real to see
the real

what can i do to turn this away fro"em" diary, i could spell the letter
""em","  that's what i'll do, i'll spell the letter ""em""

collaborative work


azure and i would very much enjoy the transformation of our APRON-ANTHRAX
series into a hypertext-collaboration:
    YOU WILL CLIMBBB OUR HILLS AND VALLEYS
    YOU WILL CLIMBBB OUR NUMEROUS SLOPES
    YOU WILL CLIMBBB THE RIMS OF OUR NAKED HOLES
      we will make images of POWDER-LIMBS POWDER-LIPS
      we will make WHITE-POWDER RIMS OF DEATH FOR YOUR HAPPY ENJOYMENT
	azure and i will make you PART OF US
	together our SKIN will disappear into SINFUL SINGULARITY
	     someone will find us there entwined
	     someone will look into our shattered limbs
	     someone will UNDERSTAND STRING-UNIVERSE THEORY
	       now this will be a momentous discovery
  just on the RIMS OF DEATH everything will become clear
  what is CLEAR is CRYSTALLINE and SHATTERED
   what is clear is NECESSARILY SHATTERED

   tonight i have prepared the APRON-ANTHRAX movie
   it is very beautiful
     you can see FROZEN DEATH in our FACES OF DESIRE
     you can see YOUNG NUBILE NAKED LIMBS and ELDERLY SHATTERED WISDOM
       ARMS AND LEGS
	     this will cost FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
	     YOU WILL CLIMBBB OUR RAVAGED COCKS
	     YOU WILL FUCKKK OUR RAVAGED CUNTS
