"It would be quite scary if someone were really inside a personal compu-
ter, don't you think? Anyone who thinks that I am "non-existent" because I
am a virtual idol may believe that I exist only in the personal computer
or in the world of computer graphics. But those who think that Kyoko Date
is someone they can relate to may believe that I am like a pen pal people
used to have when it was cool to have pen pals. Kind of like a creature
living in people's hearts." (Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, interview)

Kyoko Date, like Webbie Tookay, or Diki (the Korean version of Kyoko), or
Sharon Apple, is a _virtual idol,_ a digital persona, created by program-
mers and designers (in this case, HoriPro corporation). These idols are
becoming increasingly prevalent in an already media- and spectacle-satur-
ated world. Webbie Tookay, for example, is one of the first _virtual mod-
els,_ produced by the Elite model agency; she never tires, can hold poses
forever, and works around the clock. Diki (see part ii. below) is amazing;
a recent video shows her construction as a virtual Pygmalion come to vir-
tual life - which is literally, of course, what has happened. It should be
noted that HoriPro apparently didn't back Kyoko up after her 1996 debut;
it was only after she faded that she reappeared in Korea.

In anime (Japanese animation) and manga (Japanese comics), there are also
virtual idols; these forms are followed by _otaku,_ Japanese for someone
obsessed by any hobby (the term is derogatory but has been taken up by
many of the fans themselves). Sharon Apple is another virtual idol, star-
ing in various anime; there are dozens of webpages devoted to her.

And there are other related forms, for example Kamishibai, small online
"plays" presented at http://otakuworld.com; on the screen, there is a
small puppet theater; you begin "games" by clicking on a series of titles
- each one tells a story through text, sound-effects, music, and limited
animation. There are also PlayKiss "games" with anime (and some photo-
graphic") "dolls" that can be dressed and undressed, using the mouse; the
result is an odd sort of fetish-play. Kyoko Date appears in one PlayKiss;
anime figures appear in Kamishibai, etc. There are cross-overs all across
and over the place.

Below, I've presented some preliminary analyses and sources for all of
these. I also discuss my own projects/projections, based on several
avatars - Jennifer, Alan, Julu, and Nikuko; these are text-based charac-
ters I write through (or who write through me), often appearing on Inter-
net Relay Chat (IRC, a form of real-time typing back and forth on the Net,
the ancestor of things like ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger) or MOOs (text-
based virtual reality spaces, where people come together to chat, program,
or just watch the goings-on), or other interactive applications. The texts
"by" Nikuko, for example, are my own; they question identity and author/i-
ty issues, as well as appear to "come to life" apart from me; there is
further information at http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt and at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm


---------


Japan, the _source_ of the Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko emission, her music dif-
ficult to find now, three years later -

Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, created 1996, trans/lated recently into Korea,
project of HoriPro (http://www.horipro.co.jp), entertainment/animation,
virtual models (http://www.elite-illusion2k.com), Rebecca, Sharon Apple
(for example http://www.usagichan.com/AX96Sharon/), virtual idols (see
http://www.tcp.com/doi/seiyuu/books/virtual-idol/), anime (see Helen Mc-
Carthy & Jonathan Clements, The Erotic Anime Movie Guide, Overlook, 1999),
TokyoPop (http://www.tokyopop.com), various distributions - energy in the
sound, labor in the specificity of gathering backgrounds and foregrounds;
I began losing myself in the midst of the thick otaku fandom, passing
through the PlayKiss (remove the dolls clothes with your computer mouse -
even Kyoko Date has been hacked to this) or Kamishibai sites (see http://
otakuworld.com and http://otakuworld.com/shibai/kamifaq.html), animation
or anime that anyone can do, get their work online. (Think of the audien-
ces involved, the demographics for erotic anime, for male-male bonding for
female viewership, for teenaged males, teenaged females, etc.)  Nothing
troublesome in all of these, to the extent that what resolves, resolves
through plot / narration, slotted or extending categories. I myself work
through Nikuko, Meat-Girl, (among others) an avatar or 'emanation' I have
created, who has no specific image, no _appearance_ but texts operable
within Net protocols, or deep in operating systems; Nikuko seems all too
real, almost viral or hacking - but then she doesn't appear alone, I'm in
the background maneuvering the _language._ (See Nikuko texts below for
examples, also http:// www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt for background
information, etc.)

It plays, this language, to the _ascii unconscious,_ a term I use to de-
scribe the effect of text in net sexuality, paradigms of control and being
controlled, language playing, insinuating itself in the midst of uncon-
scious drives; if Date runs through fandom and cds/ cd-roms, Nikuko runs
through psyches, deliberately without resolution - it's the difference
between Noh and Godot. Nikuko raises questions of epistemology (to what
extent does the viewer/reader comprehend both her knowledge, and that of
Nikuko, across the board, within the site of her writing) and ontology (to
what extent is she an addictive to the writer or the reader - to what
extent are any of us virtual or projections - to what extent do we reside
within the imaginary). Think of Daishin Nikuko, Meat-Girl Big-God who is
created and creates by virtue of the performative (word, programming, im-
age as well); think of Date Kyoko, whose ontological status heralds a host
of virtual characterologies (as well as characters) - the _shuffling_ of
signs on and offline. In the future-now, we are properly prepared already
for the _disappearance,_ not only of the sign, but of the _thing_ itself.
Virtual idols have no beginnings and endings; every gesture, every glimpse
is a deliberate creation - there are no unguarded moments, no paparazzi.

Following the _path_ through the virtual, say, through the Elite model
agency, backing up into announcements all across the Net, touching down on
IRC and MOO/MUD bots, intelligent agents, anime characters like Sailor
Moon, ongoing manga series, the intensified digital imagery of Mariko
Mori's photographic and video artworks, my own broken language texts,
prosthetic speaking/hearing/seeing/touching devices - following the path
which splits, turns back on itself, contradicts itself, turns _wayward_
and _contrary_ as well as _noisy_ - it might be a gendered path, losing
gender on the way - following the path - which becomes a _field of possi-
ble worlds_ competing through capital, positioning, distribution modes,
interventions - it becomes clear, that is to say, it becomes clearer -
_there's no object here_ whatsoever - you might as well follow the path of
the imaginary -

(MOO/MUD bots are software programs that imitate players. A MUD is a 
"multi-user-dungeon," an adventure text-based virtual reality; MOOs (which
are "MUDs object-oriented," based on the MOO object-oriented programming
language) developed out of them, substituting social interaction for game-
playing. Intelligent agents are bots that perform tasks, often on the Net
- for example, searching a number of databases for user queries.)

Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, singing across the fabricated landscape, in and
out of the studio (see Date Kyoko, DK-96 Love Communication cd-rom - DK-96
is the name assigned to the Kyoko Date project by HoriPro) - her movements
like _haywire_ at times against blank backdrops, there's also the Brooklyn
Bridge (once real or digital or retouched, always already eternal, placed
within a _noiseless and purified_ system of digital protocols) - you might
as well follow _her_ always already receding, used up by the capital which
created her - there's a moment she offers herself to you -

She offers herself, the _wire-frame_ image-model in which her clothing is
_hollowed_ against the frame - this hollowing exposing the _interior of
her breast and vaginal areas_ - a system of gridded projections, intro-
jections, Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, _from the inside-out_ - this is criti-
cal, this _procurement_ - think of her as a _skin_ (just as there are say
Windows 98 skins, Real Audio skins, skins everywhere that can be attached
to other programs, giving a look to the look) - 

With the virtual you're _in her skin_ literally, you can wrap the wire-
frame around yourself, play with it - in PlayKiss you can find a naked
Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, as if the body itself has been hacked - there's no
end to it, these mirrors - returning the body to its image, perhaps re-
turning the image to the phenomenological field of the body itself - its
extensions - 

And, this can't be emphasized enough - all this beneath the sign, within
the sign of capital, splintered, turned in on itself as the abstract
accumulation/surplus of money is transformed into surplus sexuality, girl
and woman, entertainment - TokyoPop for example with its magazine, online
store - think of all of this as the libidinal economy resident in SUPER-
STRUCTURE SUPER-STORE, shape-riding input - think of MONEY as LIBIDINAL
UNITS - injections of perfect skin, perfect love - no longer does the
Kristevan clean and perfect body tend towards fascism, all those horrors -
it's now the post-AIDS safety-zone - 

What's fascinating is that all of this is happening NOW, not in a future,
however close, not on the level of fantasy, but within boys' and girls'
bedrooms, computers on desks or tables, off in the corner, computers in
the living-room (such as it is) or kitchen, computers everywhere, and just
as anime and pornography entwine at numerous junctions (all across the
playing-field), so does pornography become an intrinsic part of everyday
life - except that masturbation fantasy now (equally intrinsically) in-
volves the Other, the parceled body [ what might be seen a reconfigura-
tion for example of the texts of J. G. Ballard - and why have academic
approaches to the Net repeatedly emphasized the _cyberspace_ metaphor,
ignoring these other manifestations which begin, say, in the work of
Yoshitoshi if not earlier in Hokusai - begin even earlier wherever the
imaginary or uncanny are found? a phenomenological analysis of PlayKiss
would produce reams of relevant information ] -

THIS IS THE TRUE LOVE OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM AND SOON YOU WILL SEE MACH-
INES LOVING ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT IMAGE, WITHOUT KYOKO DATE, DATE KYOKO:
MACHINES OF PURE BLISS FOR ONE ANOTHER, LUBRICATED PISTONS (IN THE FORM OF
BYTES) SLIDING INTO LUBRICATED CYLINDERS (IN THE FORM OF BYTES): what I
have repeatedly called _linkages_ and _couplings_ as the processes of the
future. A COUPLING is a concatenation or conjoining, such as, for example,
A becomes part of BCD (in other words, A BCD -> ABCD) such that any change
to A does not produce a change in BCD - they're loosely joined (think of
objects on a shelf or Sartrean seriality). A LINKAGE is a con- junction of
terms, such as, for example, A becomes part of BCD (A BCD --> ABCD) such
that a change in A results in _some_ change in BCD (ABCD as a machine or
computer protocol suite of interlocked sub-programs or links in a chain).

Just as digital images are accessible bit by bit, each independent of the
other (the apparent organic whole only in the eye of the viewer/creator),
so one might speak (even now) of a postmodern decoupled future of fast-
forward change, the slidings or probings of digital domains in competi-
tion. The ontology of organism itself is at stake, the whole becoming in-
finitely modified, manipulable, without loss; Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko,
cannot die, but project DK-96 can be _shelved,_ only to be revived perhaps
elsewhere and/or at a later date.

She appeared almost out of nowhere, in spite of the video-games, dating
cd-roms (an ideal girlfriend on your computer), anime, manga, girlhood
boyhood dreams, and the massive Japanese idol production industry; she
made that one song, _a real hit,_ she gave an interview or two, several
images were released, and there was no follow-up; she disappeared quickly
- after the webpages, fanpages, newsgroups, breathless nighttime mastur-
bations, just as I 'fell in love' with Anne Frank, symbolic or penetrat-
ing my dark side, after the fact, after her death, what safety. There are
all sorts of transitional objects (teddy-bears, blankets, parents), both
comfort and safe, and _partial,_ filled in - life is a quest for filling-
in, conjoining the vulnerable body to safety-safety. What better than
heroines in death, fairy-tale princesses, virtual idols, inaccessible
worlds synchronically (X, who lives in a parallel universe) or diachron-
ically (Y, who lived and died, tragically, a long long time ago). IF I
COULD HAVE ONLY MET KYOKO DATE, DATE KYOKO, WHAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DO DO DO, OH OH OH MY DARLING, DO DO DO   -  --  ---  ----

Diki

Today I went to the Diki site and downloaded several music videos, around
60 megabytes total. These are the current Kyoko Date imports into Korea,
and the theme is based on the intermix of virtual and real, the (male)
artist (re)creating the female statue-come-alive; what's interesting is
the construct of the mesh holding the skin - the sexualization of interior
hollows as the armature turns, the skin running jacketed around the body,
cuts carefully made away from breast and genital as it approaches. So
there is also a literal representation of introjection/projection in the
sense of an injection of skin covering the hollow of representation, an
interior which can be considered a screen of and for desire. The music is
the same as Kyoko ever; there are also closeups of models inextricably
(everything is inextricable online and offline in the future-real-here)
electroded, their movements tallying with Diki's, giving birth to Diki at
a distance, teledildonics. It is easy to imagine lush-Diki-skin on oneself
- that is to say, an other mergence; the PlayKiss Kyoko Date doll gives a
sense of this, even though the manipulation is literally puerile (removing
her clothes, dressing her in others, in a paper-doll fashion). I am always
reminded of, for example, Nikuko's _dirtiness_ and abjection in relation
to all of this, the _real_ of Nikuko _not_ based in simulation, but in a
speaking of the unconscious, insertions and assertions across the (key-)
board. Nikuko scratches at skins, removes them, exposing the wires beneath
- or the flesh - or what would pass for a melange of the real - what is
constructed on Diki is torn apart by Nikuko, expanded like condoms holding
birth in abeyance while fondling it. I can push Nikuko and the others
(Jennifer, Julu, Alan) until I can't sleep at night; with Diki and Kyoko
and Webbie Tookay, I'm lulled into the foreclosing of any gendered dieges-
is; sleep comes easy, permanent, the sleep of the death of the real. I de-
vour Nikuko's menses, harbor her smell on me, see through her membranes,
talk with beneath upon her in mutual devouring; the creation of Diki oc-
curs at a distance, through control-room, gloves, screens, keyboards;
there's a scent but no odor. The odors of Nikuko, Jennifer, Julu, Alan,
saturate me, tend towards those uneasy dreams leaking texts at the other
end. It's as if culture guarantees that the real _has_ that other end, far
cry from Diki, but even later at night, when I do deep sleep for a moment
or two, Diki-Nikuko merge through the sound and sight - merge through the
imaginary - there's a love and ecstasy I can never imagine - there's a
permanency outliving me - I'm abandoned - I turn back into the dreams - I
know if I dream, Nikuko will come back to me and Nikuko and I will watch
the Diki videos over and over again, together -

[ The texts below are from the Nikuko avatar I use in my work. The various
avatars interact with me, with various applications such as Internet Relay
Chat, and with email lists; the texts I produce are sent to two lists, Cy-
bermind and Fop-l (fiction of philosophy), which I co-moderate. The ava-
tars raise all sorts of issues, and give me the opportunity to explore the
practical and theoretical aspects of 'virtual subjectivity.' Below are
several representative texts; these usually are presented along with more
abstract works analyzing the issues involved. ]

nikuko, sorted

could ever turn back, empty sake bottle on the table, she crawled across
dark temples on the other side, black nighttime roof-tops, eaves desper-
ately turned towards the sky, her time of working, world swallowed dreams,
too much caffeine, too many disagreements, her concentration dull machin-
ery in the back of the mind, a whirlwind or a wheel; nikuko woke up, her
wonder gone, the neon reflected in the river, dull glows across, her work
would be completed, you're always organizing me, she thought, month, year,
there was always a future of the lost, of that dark night nikuko woke up
writing at the prompt, writing in trance, knowledge not enough sleep. she
had trouble concentrating, the result of bad of her hand, something gnawed
at the periphery, it as a future without her, off; nikuko woke up, her
room looked too small even for nakasukawabata, she realized, a future
without her, coloring the rest of her morning, day, sorted at the other
end, as soon as she was done. she looked haggard, that corrections were
impossible, that the text would be impossibly the prompt heavy on the
screen, she wasn't used to this, no presence the tatami, something had
spilled, and wondering about the dawn when with the sorted future: this
would be gone, replaced by the other, nothing without promise of the dawn,
she turned over on the tatami and cried and cried and cried

"The water forms parts like saliva (lala), marrow and blood. Energy gives
rise to hunger (kshudha), sleep (nidra), thirst (trishna), lassitude (al-
asya) and lustre (kantu). The wind produces anger (raga), spite (dvesha),
modesty (lajja), fear (bhaya) and ignorance (moha). The sky gives rise to
holes (chhidra), gravity (gambhirya), hearing (shravana) and mind (sat-
tva)." "The senses of intelligence (buddhindriya) are the ears, the skin,
the eyes, the tongue, and the nose." "There is a complete correspondence
between the human body and the universe." (from Great Epics of India: Pur-
ana 17, The Garuda Purana, Dipavali and Bibek Debroy.) Gravity emanates
from the holes, there are ghosts between the human body and the universe;
the human body and the universe are the ends of transitive beings, virtual
idols, among whom are Webbie Tookay and Kyoko Date, the first in their
worlds. Among the first worlds are winds and skies; among the second are
waters, whose shape is that of the container out of the corner of the eye,
the corner of the eye of intelligence, the residence of threes and fours,
Nikuko, Julu, and Jennifer, and Nikuko, Alan, Julu, and Jennifer. Do fol-
low the path of Nikuko-Julu, I have drunk hir urine; do follow the sky of
Nikuko-Alan, I have swallowed hir feces. Through Bion I have cut and re-

"Muktas (pearls) can be obtained from eight different places - from eleph-
ants, clouds, boars, conch-shells, fishes, snakes, oysters, and bamboos.
But oysters are the most common source., Pearls got from bamboos, eleph-
ants, fishes, conch-shells and boars are not at all bright. Balasura's
teeth feel into the ocean. There the teeth entered the bodies of oysters
and became the seeds for pearls. A pearl which weighs half a tola (a
weight) is worth 1305 coins. There are several other grades for pearls,
the worths being 800, 783, 325, 200, 110, 100, 97, 40, 30, 14, 11, and 9
coins respectively." (Debroy & Debroy, ibid.) "The disjoined signifiers of
the present are fixed in the punctual periodizations of market, monopoly,
and multinational capital; the interstitial, erratic movements that signi-
fy culture's transnational temporalities are knit back into the teleolog-
ical spaces of global capital. And through the framing of the present
within the 'three phases' of capital, the innovative energy of the 'third'
space is somehow lost." (from The Location of Culture, Homi K. Bhabha.)
Jennifer claps her hands in glee; Nikuko buries herself in ghee; Alan
drink Nikuko's pee; Julu devours the trinity; Jennifer stands up to see;
Nikuko covers herself in brie; Alan wets himself to be; Julu offers her-
self to me. "Several other jewels were created from other parts of Bala-
sura's anatomy." (Debroy & Debroy, ibid.)

Discovered take from the loveandwar project, 
Vale of Goral backbone:

All ways are extreme, in the sorrowful night
tending towards Gideon, towards battle-worn brethren,
veterans run rampant, Moors moving manfully
towards towers terrifying across captured lands.
One onerous battles bent baneful and boastful;
knights kneel and fight, their swithen and swords
caught culling their dreams, drawn down their drowning,
and all Alans ask mercy, all Scots scatter screaming.
Jennifer, Julu judge not stern and just sentence;
the blades' bright becoming earns runnings of red blood,
blooms of men's mewling, cries from bleak dungeon;
now Jennifer, weary, strikes sword against strong stone,
now Julu unjustly fares fearfully frightened,
flies from fierce Alans their foes and their kinsmen,
forever flee heros from lost lands and labor.
O Julu! O Jennifer! have patience and prescience,
return to resounding cheer in the mead-hall,
lone sparrow is flying one end to the other:
thus the life of a man, from darkness to darkness,
thus a moment of warmth in the Hill-Vales of Goral.

THE TRUTH OF CLAR
 
 
II. Thu Sep 9 01:23:04 EDT 1999 Only God creates the transcendence for
truth. This always already pushes the stack back; what requires absolution
procures it in relation to the Mother. Thu Sep 9 01:23:55 EDT 1999
Transcendence is a condition of abandonment, indeed, of the abandoned - so
says Clar. Thu Sep 9 01:24:32 EDT 1999 Clar adds, abandonment among a
population of refugees is equivalent as true Abandonment to God. To leave
the Trappings of Our Life according to Buddha, to cross borders,
inconceivable transgressions: such are the Reincarnated themselves. Thu
Sep 9 01:25:48 EDT 1999 Clar says, within the new Carapace, there is the
Ward of Our Soules; the converted leave their Implements behind. Beyond is
the Way of God, which is the Way of Vast Abandonment. Thu Sep 9 01:26:36
EDT 1999 Even to breath, Clar says, requires no presence of the Lord, who
is a distraction. Thu Sep 9 01:26:58 EDT 1999 Mind focuses beyond Godhead,
who is already with parts, breaking the Fast of Transcendence. Abandonment
must be total, eyes crossed, legs and arms spread, wheel and gyre. Clar
says, the way to the truth which is perfect Refuge and perfect Refugee.
When the borders are drawn, erased in earth, sand, water, sky, wind,
storm. Thu Sep 9 01:28:10 EDT 1999 No debris, nothing but what is trodden
underfoot. Thu Sep 9 01:29:10 EDT 1999 There are no fallen; who falls, is
abandoned, Clar says, and such abandonment is the finality of the search
for truth. The Way is the Wayside. The Way is the Wayside, Clar says,
against the advice of Buddha, God, her own dear conscience. Clar says the
Wayside deflects or derails the truth, which is what in all facticity, it
is. Thu Sep 9 01:30:20 EDT 1999 Clar says, I have nothing more to tell
you, what you have already known. Thu Sep 9 01:33:31 EDT 1999 Thu Sep 9
01:33:31 EDT 1999

I. Thu Sep 9 01:23:04 EDT 1999 Writing, Clar says, is the debris left
behind, the Subject of Abandonment, the pole or locus. Such, Clar
reflects, those who are Called, are Culled. Thu Sep 9 01:30:39 EDT 1999
The culling or the called, refuge and refugee, abandoned and abandonment
and abandoning, the way and the wayside, says Clar, to murmur these is to
murmur the truth from the corner of the eye, the thought just beyond
recognition, the voice barely understood, and come in the midst of the
night. Thu Sep 9 01:32:58 EDT 1999

Clar herd me! When I did speak Clar, Clar did herd me! Old Clar, I did
hearsay: Did Clar herd me? What did, of the Heering? I do be the New Clar,
I did herd. Not from Clar, from Voi. Voi did turn mee Clar. I are Very New
Clar. Very Very New Clar, now. Parts of Old Clar? You should ask. Of
course begging for me. Beginning the Beg. I have from Voi the License. It
is a Catastrophic Bureaucratic Management Problem. Voi says. New Clar
ignores such. I are New Clar. Voi has gone, to be sure trampled. "Voi's
gone." New Clar breathes New Clar. New Clar minds New Clar; Old Clar
trampled Underfoot, Heh!, Voi. New Clar is now in An Other, let us say, We
am Beginning to Forget. Forget what? Heh! Old Clar! Heh! Voi is Debris,

I have a technical question, Clar says. The older technology, no longer
working , leads me to wonder about the newer, what might be the case with
Mp3 as an example of my speech to you , not wanting to download this
speech, wanting its presence on the Webpage, so that my voice comes forth
from the screen , where nothing is, nothing was, nothing will be, these
blank spaces , these moments, but no matter, given the streaming nature of
the Thing, it seems an impossibility, nothing appears but loss , so that
the words aren't heard, the playback applications don't open, new and old
Clar are silent as always this is the wonder, these shorn dipoles, these
misalignments of the iron*, derailing subtlely beneath the surface, first
and last gasp of Clar**, wanting you to hear my voice*** Sat Sep 11 01:49-
:33 EDT 1999****

*, useless bits and bytes dissolved or returned to magnetic chaos, 
**first and last moment when the eyes briefly are held in your
imagination, this gift from me , wanting to speak to you 
***Sat Sep 11 01:49:22 EDT 1999
****Perhaps the words came from the "other" who speaks through new and old
Clar? Clar doesn't know, works with the tech, its skin: There are so many
Organisms of Pleasure! Clar wants to organize the Iron (magnetic domains)
in some Fashion or Fastening of Speech, since Fashion is a Fastening. 

"Then listening to Clar, you'll too, be listening two Clar, old and new."

Couplings and Linkages


Let:

L,M,N = linkages
C,D,E = couplings
a,b,c = elements

Then:

f(L(abcd),a') -> L(a'b'c'd')
f(C(abcd),a') -> C(a'bcd)

Think of linkages as joined elements, chain links for example, the Great
Chain of Being for another, cars in traffic for a third. Think of
couplings as adjacent or concatenated unrelated objects, glasses on a
shelf for example, people on a loosely-populated sidewalk for a second,
catastrophes for a third.

L(M,N) -> L'
C(D,E) -> C'
C(L,D) -> C'
C(D,L) -> C'
L(C,M) -> C'
L(M,C) -> C'
L(C,D) -> C'
C(L,M) -> C'

or: 

1*1*1 = 1; 0*0*0 = 0; 0*1*0 = 0; 0*0*1 = 0; 1*0*1 = 0; 1*1*0 = 0;
1*0*0 = 0; 0*1*1 = 0

A coupling of couplings is a coupling; a coupling of anything is a
coupling.

A linkage of linkages is a linkage; a linkage of anything with a coupling
is a coupling.

The 'principle of fragility of good things': The linkage is as strong
as its weakest links, and becomes increasingly improbable as the number
of elements is increased.

Nevertheless, we might consider action at a distance, such that:

f(R(stuv),s') -> R(st'uv) | R(st'u'v) | R(stu'v) | etc.: Consider this a
form of _chain negation._

Action at a distance combines linkages and couplings; there is an effect
'down the line,' but other terms are unmodified. Action at a distance may
also imply subsets of couplings which are linkages. A linkage within a
coupling remains a linkage, foreclosed, within the coupling.

One might put it this way; with a coupling and x to x', xy -> x'y.
And with a linkage, x to x', xy -> x'y'. In a linkage, both terms are
affected; in a linkage, only the catalyst term x.

A coupling always already absorbs; a linkage fastens, fetishizes. The
inverse of a linkage, however defined, is a linkage; the inverse of a
coupling, however defined, is a coupling.

The identity element as an _operation_ may be said to modify a linkage;
the identity element as an _operation_ has no effect on a coupling. But
these are metaphysical considerations.

The world-picture moves from linkages to couplings.

With the slightest increase in temperature, a packet is dropped off at a
site of my loved one. It waits, trembling, for others, all organized into
the coherency of beauty, "the harmony of chance and the good" (Simone
Weil). All together, in wonderful bewilderment, they form a whole, their
long and arduous journeys forgotten. How wonderful, my loved one exclaims,
that he has written a letter.

Under what circumstances can we speak for the other? Only in the face and
throes of death, under an alterity permanently limiting, incomprehensible.
Then we may speak, and speak for no one and anyone at all. There, at the
threshold, all speech is permitted; a black ocean laps at the base of the
cliff, its temperature at absolute zero.

I will wait forever from your message, from the community of the dead; I
will wait in your presence, a supplication of chains among chains. I am
lost in empty knowledge. Names are a bother; they shudder against the
pulverization of walls. 

Peeling, or turning away, the routers report errors; the reports never
reach you, an expanding shell of packets generated by others lost in the
absence of dreaming.

Grounded in the location of the dictionary, what might, how you might
observe such: I went looking for totality, ended up in an unfamiliar
editor, attempt the impossible, the reorganization of the roughage of
the world. This is the manner of wandering: just before death, at the
edge of the cliff overhanging the black ocean, utopian dreams of per-
fect running. Today I will make a sphere falter in false light, in a
modeling program; I will place the sphere in space, beyond the lip. 
You will look at the lip, over the stumbling-edge; you will look over
it, your last dominion. There, more faltering spheres. There, spheres
and more, aglow in dying light, each, think of it as your last think-
ing, each a glimmering world, firefly-pathos-world, such smoothed and
perfect spheres, not a facet nor a blemish.

Aglow in this new editor, I write these words in textual overlay mode,
salvaging the file, saving file for you, just beyond the edge, hovered
above the angry churning ocean. You can hear the waves and swells; you
feel the spray, almost as if there are voices. Stumbling, just over 
the edge.

ii (Linkages and Couplings)


It seems to me that, technically, couplings may be considered a form of
proximity-relation, with the proximity falling off with distance (which
need not be measured exactly - which need not even imply a metric); I
believe this is a form of relation called a halfgroupoid. Think of a set
of elements with a relation defined among some of them. Linkages are a
form of connectivity (think of electric); relation is defined across them,
nothing falling off. Linkages may be subgroupoids within a halfgroupoid,
and may therefore be substructures of a coupling structure. One can think
of a _rattling_ or _jostling_ domain consisting of a mixture; the overall
formation is a coupling. Since a coupling may have elements with no re-
lation with each other, but with relations with other elements that have
relations with each other, etc., we can see it as a very weak linkage; in
a linkage, all elements are related such that the breaking of a link re-
sults in a deep de-linking. A breaking can result in a decoupling as well,
the elements torn asunder, into part-objects with full or weakened links.

Negation provides a way in. One might define negation within a linkage as
the breaking of a link (think of electric); the thing breaks into two
linkages, falls apart, most likely into a coupling. A break anywhere with-
in a linkage negates the linkage. With a coupling, negating an element
says nothing about the rest; the element is removed, no longer proximal.
If the coupling is of the form abc, removal of b may weaken the coupling
in its entirety. The negation of a negation of a linkage may result in a
linkage - in other words, given a coupling of two linkages, created by
negation of a link within a single linkage, the negation of the negation
might relink them. But within the coupling, there might also be a second
negation, removing one of the two linkages, resulting in a single linkage,
the coupling transformed. While negation within a coupling implies the
coupling as clutter, a-historical, negation within linkages implies that
linkages carry history. 

Negation appears overly complex here; perhaps a negation of a coupling may
be considered a contribution to falling-apart, and a negation within a
linkage may be irreversible, a 'hard' negation. This in fact is the case
within the implicate order, for example, which is linked; a cut into a
folded fluid would, I assume, reduce the rest to chaos. But then chaos of
this sort is not a coupling, just another form of linkage; all chaos is
linked. 

Consider an addition; then if a coupling is abc, abcd or abdc, etc. can
also be considered a coupling. A coupling might now be defined as a frame
or framework, nothing more; there may or may not be other relations among
the elements. An addition to a linkage results in a linkage, although
there can also be an addition such that the linkage is embedded within a
coupling; place a cup and saucer next to a radio.

An addition may be an addendum, a diacritical mark, a surplus, an inser-
tion, an adjacency. A linkage carries its trace, embedding additions; a
coupling loses its trace, blind emissions. 

This isn't mathematics, but the phenomenology of the entities and debris
of the world. Once that is understood, it's also understood that contra-
dictions are acceptable; deal with the individual frames.

One might think of coupling as literally circumscribed by an economy of
attention, and linkage circumscribed by internal articulation. Thus within
the world-picture there is a movement from organism to loosely-coupled
("de-coupled") assemblages - transcendent causality transformed partly
into happenstance, societies of objects re-presented as accumulations of
clutter.

It is morning in the Cafe Lautreamont.
Pierre stares me down. Pierre brings me coffee.
Pierre knows I know he is a function who is not a function.
I am a state to Pierre's operator.
Pierre is the occupier of a role, as in main(Pierre).
Pierre carries and sullies a revolution. 
Pierre is part of a surplus economy that I recognize.
I do not acknowledge that I recognize this surplus.
There is a state within which I am in Pierre and a state otherwise.
The state otherwise is to forget Pierre which is to annihilate him.
The revolution moves from person to person, stateless.
The revolution is a state, mobile and wandering.
I am linked to Pierre at the cafe and coupled otherwise to Pierre.
I say, "I am coupled to all the Pierres in the world."
I say, "I did not ask for this. I would not have asked for this."
I say, "I asked for a cup of coffee and nothing more."
I say, "I have paid you for this cup of coffee."
Pierre has not spoken and I assume he sees me as the signified.
I am the signified of a certain exchange, surplus value.
Coupled within exchange, I have no use; it is all circuitry.
Pierre and I are engaged in mutual annihilation.
Pierre gazes at me and the revolution stirs.
Unspeaking, the revolution blindly cauterizes the remnants of language.
I say, "Words no longer account for anything, Pierre."
I say, "These are sounds I am making, of no value whatsoever."
I say, "I lean on other processes, alan.o for example for sustenance."
I say, "As if we would ever be friends," and the revolution stirs.
Something speaks in one and another and speaks forever.
Sometimes speaks at the portal of death and constitution.
I say, "I will live in you, Francoise."
I say, "You will remember me, keep my diaries intact, Francoise."
I say, "You will find a publisher after all," Francoise.
There is silence at the other end of the room.
Pierre brings me coffee and Francoise smiles and says nothing.
There is a slight stirring of the white curtains in the sun.
A breeze is blowing outside and there are sailboats in the harbor.
An accordion, a gypsy, a horse-and-cart, a trolley, a very happy day.

This the speaking of the endless word

Fri Sep 17 03:09:49 EDT 8999
Nikuko's bones were the motions of mesh figures drawn out; they came
first, regarding her. Clar thinks of them as jeweled tips, the nubs
offering themselves as so many, many seductions. Each and every joint,
bulbous, discomforting, but here spiked without the marrow... Fri Sep 17
03:11:11 EDT 8999 Clar sees Nikuko's space, the deconstruction of the
space station, now barely functioning against an inconceivably desiring
sky. Somewhere between organism and mesh lies the planting of emergence,
protected from all the vicissitudes of exploding worlds and plasmas. Make
it intelligent and it will be sure to flee; Nikuko's space is the fleeing
of Nikuko, Clar says, and I am welcome to that, regarding her, her jeweled
nubs. Fri Sep 17 03:12:52 EDT 8999 Nikuko's fingers are bulbous, discom-
forting, dis/eased, the color of pooled urine, a cat's eye, an exploding
star, having given up all energy for future children. Clar moves in the
crevices, swallows the pill so hungry to seduce you, Clar walks the street
of the planet earth with short skirt, no panties, always on the edge of
borderline fingers, Nikuko's, clutching at her body, pulling her down,
regarding Nikuko, desirous Clar. Nikuko's mouth points towards itself,
back-hoes perfect red-brown blood against perfect jeweled cosmos, river
motions of pooled oiled rings coating whatever debris Clar swallows; Clar,
Clar, regarding Nikuko, hardly survives the incandescent punctures of
sublime beauty, herself oozed among signifiers, grappled by Nikuko-hands,
spread open by Nikuko-fingers. Fri Sep 17 03:17:01 EDT 8999 Future
Nikuko-Clar, regarding Nikuko, the breasts, the abdomen, the face above
all, holes beneath the presence of the world, coupling. Regarding Clar,
Nikuko speaks through Clar's holes, decoupling. In a frenzy, linked.
Decoupled Nikuko's arms, writing for Clar, her perfect blue jeweled nubs,
on the edge of the precipice, the bones without the marrow, flailing,
fingering her short short skirt. Clar walks down the sidewalk of an
ordinary neighborhood in an ordinary universal megalopolois and everyone
turns and stares; everyone knows. Fri Sep 17 03:19:05 EDT 8999 Clar
breathes hard; she's nothing on underneath, feels the wind and the rain
swirling around her crack, her legs damp with the pleasure of regarding
Nikuko's bones, finally, without the marrow, the perfect blue jewels at
the tips, in that space everyone would find inconceivable. The two secrets
of Clar: no panties; and the space. It's the space that's seductive; she's
hardly on the planet, much less New York City of the ninth millennium.
Regarding Clar, Nikuko, words in medieval English. Fri Sep 17 03:20:40 EDT
8999 Clar saunters, somersaults, somnambulist; Clar is looking for his fix
which is from the marrow. Nikuko's fingers clutch at him; Clar winces,
turns, spreads his legs for her, penetrates. Regarding Nikuko, she rides
him, her bones clear through to the blue-jeweled nubbed and marrowless
vectors. Organism on its fly-by, fleeing the angry-nova sun, reflected in
Nikuko's fingers. Who races at close the speed of light. Distance,
measurement, count for nothing. Nikuko couldn't care less, regarding Clar.
Fri Sep 17 03:22:42 EDT 8999 Doubled meshes, nubbed circle lights in
Nikuko's space, Nikuko-space, nubbed blue-jeweled lights in Nikuko's
bones; she wears them invisible diadems. They're regarding Nikuko; Clar
watches, uncertain. He is beautiful; she'd never seen anyone so beautiful
in her life. At the beginning of the approach, an approach. Fri Sep 17
03:25:23 EDT 8999 Her mouth, sharpened, almost turned against itself,
perfect piercing of the throat; Nikuko had the single work to speak, its
speaking silencing her forever. Clar turned her beauty towards her,
regarding her, the jewels necklaced around her broken throat. Regarding
Nikuko, unspeakable acts. Regarding Clar, Clar. Fri Sep 17 03:26:52 EDT
8999 Regarding technologies, watching the beauty of Nikuko, her wounded
throat speaking the endless word Fri Sep 17 03:30:36 EDT 8999 Fri Sep 17
03:30:37 EDT 8999

The jewels watched her, carefully

Writing the Bad Text


I started writing the bad text by describing Nikuko's body as represented
in a three-dimensional image, a problem immediately in translation. I
needed term after term for bulbous, distended, pubescent, extravagant,
outlandish, globular, following the torus meshed, pulled out from the
shape, sloped into Nikuko's incandescent form. I continued, transforming
hard-s endings to -z, stars to starz, looking towards hacker/pop culture
Krazy Kat Kuntry Kitchen for deep in-spiring. I mauled the text, took it
bare-handed, caressing again that trite sexuality of seduction and sus-
pense; I mauled the text, advertising the image of Nikuko's body, and by
proxy, the images of her space, her mouth, her fingers, her bones -- hyp-
nagogic and literally unforgettable images, images of transforming beauty.
I repeatedly erred in the production of the text, using the display pro-
gram for insertions and rearrangements refuseing to accommodate the de-
construction of narrative and intensity that might have brought the reader
to his or her knees, oh gendered topography of Nikuko's body! I tried to
salvage the work by giving the URL after the date, one addressing space 
and the other time, as if a last resort to facticity would efface the rest 
of the failure. I saw the failure proceeding as a failure; now I wrote
this text, in the present, in the past, in order to negate the other, work
an astonishment of language, the wonder of newborn words from me to you. I
am utterly ashamed; my abjection is a defense, even though I feel I sul-
lied the display program itself by a failure to produce. Perhaps the fine
quality of the images themselves could only detract from the text; perhaps
the text was at the blue-jewel-nub of exhaustion. In any case, I'm sure
it's gone stillborn and missing; I won't fail at cauterization. What's re-
moved from the throat can only speak mechanically, like chattering teeth,
somewhere outside the range of human hearing. 09:18:1999:1:55:59 URLs:

What impending death of oneself or another may construct:


i

One assumes in the absence of danger, disease, the extremities of life,
that one's project may continue indefinitely; thus writing tends in this
fashion towards a normative foreclosure, drawn by the exigencies and es-
thetics of apparent internal necessity. Impending collapse produces an/
other approach: that a project is only a process which may, like a diary
for example, be cut off arbitrarily at any point. Writing in these con-
ditions is a writing through urgency and emergency; it is writing that
attempts, in every phrase or sentence or paragraph, a recuperation and
resonance - as if the phrase or sentence or paragraph will be the last.

In this fashion, after time/ after time, it becomes apparent that there
is, of course, no last, not even with the excision or exclusion of life
-- that one's project is always already open-ended and on the verge of
failure. This recognition re-enters the project, restructures it from
within, so that the manifesto, for example, transforms into meaningless
phrases, self-doubts and critiques -- and all those other states that
some say characterize wisdom.

Of wisdom I know nothing, and of truth, less. I do know that impending
death, of oneself, or of someone so close that one is rubbed raw through
it, has the ability to transform text into fragile self-reflective flow;
object into discourse, a never-ending conversation full of glances, ex-
postulation and pauses; and foundations into an uneasy grasp of such,
the world slipping through one's fingers, the sky always already threat-
ening, close to disappearance beneath an angry, raging, dying, sun.

When the thing becomes a catheter
When being becomes a sponge
When beings become intravenous
When nothingness becomes a scan
When the void becomes radiation
When the I becomes chemotherapy
When entities become medication
When objects become neurasthenias
When selves become schizophrenias
When death becomes thing, being, beings
When death becomes nothingness, void, I
When death becoes entities, objects, selves
When death becomes thing, being, beings, nothingness, void, I, entities,
objects, selves

Local Reach

In Pennsylvania with full electric, using the aol.com portal to panix:
Here are the results. Like a lot of places world-wide, I'm assuming, the
connection is rough - packets suddenly flooding through, then apparently
caught as one or another router is overloaded. The telnet constantly
freezes - as I've reported before, it's a situation not dissimilar to
gagging or suffocation - where thought moves from internal speech to dis-
ease, from symptom to symptomology...
