FICTION-OF-PHILOSOPHY


A NEW ELECTRONIC FORUM FOR THE DISCUSSION AND PRESENTATION OF
PHILOSOPHICAL FICTION, FICTIONAL PHILOSOPHY, AND EVERYTHING
IN-BETWEEN


The FICTION-OF-PHILOSOPHY: As in the fiction-of-crime, the category
encompasses both `philosophical fiction' and that aspect of philosophy
which encounters fiction as a mode of inquiry. Philosophical fiction
would include the novels of Bataille, Ballard, Gibson, Sartre; works
of Jabes, Michaux, Lautreamont, Karl Kraus; poetry of Lucretius, Susan 
Howe, Holderlin; the philosophical micro-narratives of Baudrillard, 
Nietzsche, and Barthes; Lingis' exhilerated accounts of the other/
gender, Kathy Acker's deconstruction of sexualities and politics, and
other writers/writings too numerous to mention...

WHY THIS LIST? Because "creative" and theoretic writing are inter-
woven yet distanced by the history of faculties, and because new 
formations carry the possibilities of new modes of thinking through
our overheated postmodern cultural terrain. 

The list has as goals both the discussion of the FICTION-OF-PHILOSOPHY
in general or in reference to specific authors; and the presentation 
of creative work that may bear on current issues of theory.

FICTION-OF-PHILOSOPHY: FOP, defined in the older Roget: "...swell, 
dandy, exquisite, coxcomb, beau, man about town, spark, popinjay, 
puppy, prig, jackanapes, carpet knight, dude" - extended into 
situationist, raconteur, flaneur... existing-between, passing for the
_other,_ the spy in the house of love who came in from the cold.

The threads on the list might include presentations and discussions
of creative work by the participants, cross-postings addressing rele-
vant issues, discussions/critiques/group readings of specific literary
works, and discussions of more general issues ranging from the inter-
face between poetry and philosophy, to the narratology of the site of
writing-philosophy (Heidegger's forest, Jabes' desert, Ballard's high-
way).

This list is open to everyone interested in philosophy and theory, on
any level.

FICTION-OF-PHILOSOPHY is brought to you by the Spoon Collective, a 
group of Net citizens devoted to free and open discussion of literary
and philosophical issues on the Internet. Based on the Collective's
philosophy, PLEASE BE AWARE THAT POSTS CONTAINING LANGUAGE OR SUBJECT
MATTER THAT SOME MIGHT FIND OFFENSIVE MAY APPEAR ON THE LIST FROM TIME
TO TIME, AND SUCH POSTS WILL NOT BE CENSORED. However, we would also 
like you to know that racial or other bias slurs will not be tolerated;
there are other sites on the Internet for them.
