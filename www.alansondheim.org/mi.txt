Alan is jumping up and down with excitement!
Women approve heartily and men drink more beer as Alan sings "Begin the
 Beguine."
You fall down laughing.
You cry.
You say, "It's amazing, I just got a new car!"
You say, "Begin the Beguine and it's really all mine and there's
 nothing more so show me the door"
You say, "There were two rabbis, isn't that funny enough?"
You say, "Death is all around us, beware beware of death"
You open your arms wide, begging the populace to embrace you.
You pull your arms around your body.
You say, "Please help me, I am amazingly beautiful..."
You say, "Thank you all my loves, you have me me love myself..."
You pucker your lips expectantly.
You kiss yourself.
You say, "Oh beauty, I am waiting for you to come to me!"
You say, "I will begin with my own body, oh Penelope! and end with
 yours!"

Traum


Nikuko, listen. I don't sleep. I have had episodes. My anger threatens the
world. I have had red suns I cannot escape. I cannot escape the sky. The
red sky is everywhere. Nikuko, listen. I am sleeping. I wake after the
first episode; I sleep again. I wake after the second, after more convul-
sions; again I sleep. I wake after the third, and that is the end of it.

I came naked to you to show you everything. I want to seduce you with my
broken anger. Listen: I dreamed I was in a train station, a waiting room,
a classroom at a university. There was a woman dressed in brown leather, a
beautiful jacket. Black hair, perhaps from Montreal or Paris. Those
features. I bump into her. She smashes me, I bend over in violent pain. I
wake up. I wake up in convulsions. You know, the body moves suddenly
against all will, out of control. One wakes up in sweat. She's gone. The
anger fades. Lassitude sets in.

I want to seduce you. I want you to come naked and broken to me. I want to
see your breasts, your cunt. I want to touch everything. I want you to
belong to me, Nikuko, I want to own you. Listen: I sleep again. There is a
man present, similarly dressed. Both of them are in their late twenties.
He is her boyfriend. He approaches me, knees me in the abdomen, slams my
face. I fall to the ground like a worm. I can't move. I jerk about. I
convulse. I wake up.

I want you so bad this might be a dream. I want your body in my face. I
want to live in your odor. I want you all over me. I want my body bruised
with you. I want your territory marked. Listen: I sleep again. This is the
worst. I am in pain. I am standing near a table or desk. A security guard
walks by. I reach for his gun. I take it from his holster. It's a nine
millimeter pistol.

I am looking at you now, Nikuko. I am undressing you with my eyes. I take
the pistol and begin shooting. People try to leave to my left, there is a
door. It is brown, wood. I shoot them. The pistol hums, it doesn't go
pop-pop-pop. It hums with the beauty of death. It warms to my hand. I am
in fury. I am furious anger. I will take everyone out.

Yes, Nikuko, this is healthy. This is a true way of thinking. I mow them
down. I mow everyone down, left and right. People are screaming. It means
nothing to me, I let them scream. Do you see how I am, Nikuko, how it is.

Nothing bothers me, Nikuko, nothing. Listen: I run out of ammunition. For
a moment I am afraid all will be lost. I have numerous clips I have taken
from the security guard. From somewhere, I have a second gun. I hold the
gun on the survivors. I load the clip in the other gun, the first gun, my
warm gun. I am worried I am loading the clip incorrectly. How would I know
how to load a clip.

I first knew I would know how to load a clip when I felt the gun firing
once again, warm in my hand, warm with the beauty of it. No pop-pop-pop,
just the humming sound. People are running and screaming again.

Now I will tell you. There is a silence now. There is a silence and it is
a very deep silence. My anger knows no bounds. It travels through horizons
that move with me, like the horizon of a blood-red boiling ocean. There
are no limits. Nikuko, I tell you, there are no limits. Look at my skin.
Look at all of it. I own you, Nikuko. I own all of you, every bit of you.
Show me all of you, Nikuko. I convulsed in the sheets of the bed. I woke
up.

I woke up frightened, Nikuko, frightened of everything.

I am afraid of my power, of my lack of fear. I am afraid of what I will do
with the gun. I am afraid of infinity. I look at you and undress you with
my eyes. Take everything off, Nikuko, I own you.

I am fascinated by your response to my power.

This is the end of it. You are that girl. You are mine to do what I will.
I am sure you are that girl. Take off your panties.

Is it because girl take off my panties that you came naked and broken to
me? Are you annoyed that girl take off your panties that I came naked and
broken to you? Have you been annoyed often? Stop making excuses for
yourself. Please please don t ever leave me. Are you sure that don t ever
leave you? When did you first know that don t ever leave me? What happened
when did me first know that don t ever leave you? What happened at the
time when did you first know that don t ever leave me? What would happen
if you had a gun and if did me first know that don t ever leave you? Is
the fact that don t ever leave me the real reason? Does the fact that don
t ever leave you the real reason explain anything else? Have you been
positive don t ever leave me the real reason explain anything else? You
mentioned that you would like to seduce? Is it because I would like to
seduce that you came naked and broken to me? Did you ever regret you would
like to seduce that I came naked and broken to you? Why should I get to
seduce? When did you first know that should you get to seduce? What would
happen if we did it or if did me first know that should I get to seduce?
Is the fact that should you get to seduce the real reason? Does the fact
that should I get to seduce the real reason explain anything else? Are you
certain should you get to seduce the real reason explain anything else? Is
it because of your life that you are going through all this?

altering (responding to a text)^2


the ruins of buildings. i can't write from anything else. tonight, the 
water stopped in our apartment. the apartment ran dry. there are sounds
of struggle in the pipes.
following a sentence in the possessive and possession of characters,
a gap or hiatus. wayward or contrary characters. of the harshness of 
daily politics.
of the real and virtual jennifer, julu, alan, nikuko. of the real and 
virtual honey, travis, tiffany. 
jennifer years ago started off as about 12 in the early stuff then moved
to 20s-something; nikuko i imagine in her 30s; julu 24.
i keep wanting to kill them off. i killed off jennifer a long time ago,
she had a bier and everything, then returned.
before that, travis, honey, and tiffany all disappeared. i can't write
dialog for males, it's not that i can write it for females, i can't at
all, but with males it devours me from inside. it's a distrust of males,
of male authority. it's built-in, a bad engine.
males are bad engines. males absorb, i write from the debris, effluvia, 
of absorption. 
alan is a character but alan is also a stain or residue, almost always
disappearing by the end of the show if he were there in the first place.
alan wants to disappear but engrave in stone.
alan wants to engrave everything in stone and then rails against totality
and writes dubious philosophy. that doesn't make sense.
it's almost as if alan wishes that nikuko speaks through alan, both of
them in a ring: jennifer on the east, julu on the west.
north and south are unguarded; they always are, the cold-spots of the ring
of Aphra Behn's desire.
there are disappearances. as one might say, there are disappearances and
disappearances. they follow this odd desire. they generate an inchoate
politics reaching up through the surface like the hand in Carrie.
the texts come from dreams (of the real or virtual dreams) (of careful 
considerations and the clarity of thought), go back in and mess with them. 
nothing comes out but different, not therapy or recuperation or balance, 
but a mess that takes off on its own: alan with the 9 millimeter, nikuko 
listening as if entranced.
Alan writing in a trance or entrance. Nikuko listening in departure.
they occupy an aspect ratio. alan thinks: better to return to coding,
code-work made obvious (although Traum came out of a rewrite of the
emacs doctor program) - better returning to abstraction or scaffolding,
rather than the mud on the rungs as one climbs, impossibly, among the
ruins of buildings in the east, in the west.
not of buildings in the cold, northern and southern poles: where the
writing originates. frozen, immobilized.
writing from magnesis, magnetic poles, hysteresis looped.

from Alan, never from dreams

there were creatures about, clumps of these almost black, almost charred,
insects, sometimes hundreds hung together, crawling across themselves like
a furrowed moving fruit. beneath them were fern fronds in the dim light,
and on the fronds were insects with white cotton freezing them at the
joints, a form of spittle or mold perhaps, or perhaps even the guise of
another species imitating the dead. we were wanderers without hope of the
truth; later i'd spend hours passing out images, begging for identifica-
tion, searching online and off, to no avail. only that they were bugs, of
the hemiptera, fattened and joined, of the three types - one ovoid with
the red outpostings, one circular, and where the x-ed wings crossed there
was a lighter darker tan against the slate of the rest, and that pentagon-
al, also with the tan and slate, but the wings slightly more prominent. in
all of them the wings seemed pasted on, thinned, useless. i took image
after image. all of similar types were not only poisonous, but the vectors
:we walked through the clumps carefully; the bugs were sluggish, of the
order of bugs with the wings x-ed and flattened across their backs, almost
slatish in color, hanging from vines, in the forks of the trees, only in
this dense and twisted half-lit spot, isolated from the rest of the
thicket. we returned again to gather more images, stopping only at the
atala butterfly, threatened and endangered, this orange-bodied dark-blue
creature of the glade. but we went in farther, breaking through brazilian
pepper, cabbage palm, and other palms and trees - the latter so twisted,
we emerged later with blood on our arms.:at last i came to the eastern
blood-sucking conenose and it seemed pinned down for the moment. this led
to chiagas, darwin's disease, also to kissing and assassin bugs, hemiptera
all, but the proboscis was different. it was a dead end. i noticed the as-
sassins seemed lone assassins; our bugs are two-fold or three-fold gender,
at least three different morphs, heavily communal. it seems impossible. i
want to hold my arm out, my flesh out, to their touch, their gatherings.
there are an enormous number of potential diseases, some deadly. i want to
call them to me, the squat ones with the outline of the housefly on their
back and red protuberance on their sides, and the flattened ones of
unearthly colors, some almost circular, some pentagonal, reflecting the
simulacrum of more popular species.::

on hemiptera, Lacan, others


years ago, in the Far Hills Project (1973), I was already faced with
taxonomic anomaly. in recording pond-life employing an EIAJ NTSC video
camera through a Leitz microscope, I was well aware of the fuzzy encoding
that occurred between the real and the analog. later, I would write of the
distance between one scan line and another, a broken distance, with 
nothing between, nothing cohering, contiguous at best - already presaging 
the deep digital disconnect between a pixel and its neighbor.
 
at that point, I considered the topology of intention in relation to
microworlds: opening spaces at 2000x magnification, close to the limits of
optical microscopy (newtonian diffraction rings, etc.) - how does
taxonomic identification occur, what schema are utilized? in pre-DNA days,
or on the level of the amateur naturalist, the phenomenology of
consciousness, of anomaly and coherence, plays a large role. now I find
myself returning full circle: these insects are deeply unidentifiable, and
I bring every means, every symptom, to their occasion. the distancing
mechanisms are still there, as are the radical disconnections; in a sense,
I've learned nothing, except that the vast array of knowledge before me
has an imperfect, at best, relationship to my own neural processes. the
clues just don't add up, as if they ever did. even if I succeeded, the
most I'd gain would be a name - but at least that would lead out of this,
would lead elsewhere.

perhaps I'm not being clear, faced with the clarity and fuzziness of the 
world - of which these are already phenomenological, aesthetic terms. it's 
not that I want certainty, or even to know what I'm stepping into - so 
much as what I will be, in the future, leaving behind. in the Everglades 
I'm faced  with inconceivably tangled matrices of molecular organization, 
micro-ecological niches, human mayhem. a name, just a _name_ for the 
_thing,_ would add and subtract.

If you breathe a living word of this I don't know what I'll do. You can't
spread hearsay. This must be absolutely confidential. Because it's our
secret and has to remain that way. No one ever must know this. I'm holding
you to the utmost, Nikuko, absolutely to the utmost. This must be the 
limits of our lives and we must not open our mouths under any conditions 
at all, Nikuko.

I will break you in pieces if you breathe a word of this to anyone. You
must take this to the grave. You most promise not to say anything. Nikuko,
there is no way out. This is strictly between you and me. No one else has
anything to do with it. No one else can find out anything. Don't leave the 
tiniest little clue anywhere or breathe the tiniest little sigh. All the 
walls have mouths and all the doors have ears, Nikuko.

I'd rather you fuck me until we drop, rather than reveal a single word of
this. I'd rather you kill me slowly. I'd rather you'd prepare our meals,
rather than discuss this with any of our friends or acquaintances. This is
never to be disclosed, Nikuko, it is our hot breath together, whispered
from one mouth to one ear and listened to by one ear from one mouth. It is
not to be ever spoken of to anyone. It is to be confined between just the
two of us, as if it were in a perfect penitentiary we have made just for 
this secret, like Speer in prison.

No one else can know a thing about this, not the tiniest little thing. I
am swearing you to secrecy and myself to secrecy. This can go no further,
not even to our closest friends and relatives. Absolutely, the sweat on
our skins is our absolute bond that we have made between us so no one will
ever have the slightest inkling of this, ever. Even if we fuck and our 
sweats intermingle as you prepare our meals, our sweats must not drip and 
be interpreted as the most microscopic clue that ever has been left, even 
tinier than the smallest fragment of dna, Nikuko, even tinier than the 
smallest hydrogen atom in the littlest orbit ever.

Trees would fall and mountains collapse if anyone says anything; this is
the most top top-secret of all the secrets, this is locking us together
forever, there is nothing anyone can give you that would make you reveal
this secret. Not even valleys flooding or great storms would make you
reveal this secret, which is only hearsay and should not be spread
indiscriminately among one and all. Not even fire or whole world wars of 
incredible conflagration shall make us give up even one syllable of this 
to any living creature, including animals and plants and minerals, or any 
other thing or place or emanation on this or any other planet.

Nothing can ever ever be revealed, disclosed, opened up, Nikuko, brought
into the light, given up to the full view, nothing whatsoever, and this
for all time, even past our deaths and internments, even past our
exhumations and reburials, nothing at all.

the interview


last night i dreamed of blood again, red-brown blood drenching the dream
itself, drenching everything. during the day my boss called in my
co-workers, one after another, and swore them to secrecy. i lost my job,
and i'm never to be told why.

THE TERRIBLE SECRET. this place has a terrible secret. it's an institution
that used to be an airfield. there are signs of the indigenous population
in the thicket on the grounds. the administration wishes to tear down the
thicket. nothing human will grow there.

there is no one to trust, only the simulacrum. THE TERRIBLE SECRET gnaws
at my breast. i will never rest or sleep again until i know THE TERRIBLE
SECRET.

i think there is chemical warfare here. there are mutations everywhere,
ducks, hemiptera of various species, crawling vines in the back of the
thicket. why did they burn the shelter down? in the center of the thicket,
all that remains are several charred uprights. about 25 meters away, a
cabbage palm, half-burned as well. the administration says nothing about
this. the ground is pocked with solution holes, the limestone craggier 
than usual.

at night i drive over to the buildings, crawl with flashlight and camera
through the thicket. poisonwood sears my skin; spiders attack. the small
pond on the northern side is almost out of reach. it's there, through the
cattails. in the thicket i have developed a mysterious illness. even now i
am feverish; there are strange welts on my arms.

i develop chills late at night. i must discover THE TERRIBLE SECRET. you
think to yourself, this is a text, a fabrication. you have not been here
when my superior has ordered everyone to remain silent around me. i have
become malignant. everywhere i walk i am accompanied by silence. but they
do not follow me into the thicket, nor do they know my paths there.

it is just about to happen, this revelation. i do know that, i can sense
it in the atala butterflies, in the poisonwood, in the saw palmetto. i can
sense it in a certain trembling of the ground itself, as if it were making
room for something vast.

my superior in everything will be decimated and no longer able to speak to
her inferiors. the thicket will rise up, the pond become a great flood,
the charred palm and wood matches igniting everything in the institution.
nothing will remain but the thicket. the thicket will remain.

beautiful atala butterflies with deep blue-black wings, orange bodies, the
subtlety of embers...

Beginnings of an essay ready to be abandoned


Elsewhere i've written about the characters I use as emanants or source-
less semiotic spews that coagulate as characters, take on a life of their 
own - one that I follow with insistence. They also form a bypass or excuse 
- if I want to say something childish or out-of-sorts; if I'm in a bad 
mood - if I want to present something dubious, something erroneous - I can 
call on Nikuko or Jennifer - none of them care...

These people help, but they also get in the way. My main concern is philo-
sophy, not literature; I want my work to be taken seriously as theoretical
thought. In Nietzsche's time, or Kierkegaard's, both branches might well
intertwine, as they do in Derrida for example. But there's a cost involved
- a general referentiality to the dominion of the philosophers or theor-
ists - which is absent in my work, as Julu, for example, will have a 
spirited conversation with Jennifer in a MOO. Who can untangle both the 
stylistic and application involved - not to mention the sentiment? One can 
write all one wants about postmodernity, virtuality, subjectivity, epis- 
temology, ontology, and so forth - but one must do this through the proper 
channels...

My dreams aren't full of them - not even Jennifer, the first - not even 
Alan. Instead there are shattered and strobed screens, prompts as part- 
objects, control passages and program transformations. I think of floating 
signifiers, sememes with contusions, shattered commands I don't quite 
understand. Among other things these are the deconstructions of avatars, 
breakdowns of characters: bones. Out of the dreams other assemblages 
arise, heading towards language, program, text.

I can always fall back on the dreams - against the logics of genre, for 
example. It's that logic of the unconscious again. I'll use programs - 
collectively called "julu programs" - as catalysts. I wrote the following 
- you can see how disordered everything is - I'll read axiomatics, the 
care and Kehre of reasoning - then turn - Mobius strip - anyway I wrote 
the following just this evening in another context:

"Here's a major point for me. I've never been that interested in poetry or 
literature/style generators, mainly because I'm interesting in a kind of 
writing of urgency or writing that insists on a semantic world or 
"sememe." I'm not that interested in abstraction per se which - for me - 
underlies generated work. I'm trying to work out philosophical issues, 
issues dealing with virtuality, etc., and so generation - unless it were 
revealing something about language itself - isn't that interesting to me."

"That being said (sorry I'm writing awkwardly - I'm dizzy from some 
medication) - when I first programmed, it was on a Texas Instruments 59 
calculator with 1k of programming space, and one of the things I did was 
make a text generator with maybe 100 words in it. There was a lot of very 
very (for me) tight programming; it was all indirect addressing and 
abbreviation to fit it in. But it ran and produced a series of texts. What 
I did learn about through this was the way structure works (as well as 
indirect addressing) in relation to language -"

"And _that_ being said - I tend to use the programs for catalysts, almost 
for revealing sub-texts or the unconscious of my own thinking - which I 
can then rewrite, tease out - this is a process of reworking, abandoning, 
re-arrangement, etc. None of the programs is used for "pure" output; it's 
all mixed, a mish-mash."

"Of course, even doing that - the reworking - I tend to learn more about 
the subject at hand, and my own role or placement within it. And of course 
that being said, I try to eliminate my own bias, or to extend it - play 
around with the phenomenological reduction."

"There is also the energy used in reworking the syntax and vocabulary of
the various programs - that's another kind of study or summarization of my
current work - I'll need 43 nouns, 22 verbs... I can write this as a
semantic field in itself - a way of dis/organizing the domain -"

summary for minneapolis talks 2/02


in real life one begins with the real and moves through the semantics,
sememe, signified; in virtual life, one begins with the signified, moves
through the sememe, semantics, to the real - analog <> digital <> analog

in virtual life, enunciation is the totality of presence bottlenecked to 
the replete on the other side; in real life, enunciation is the residue 
and diacritical of presence. in virtual life, intention and presence are 
coeval; in real life, they are disparate and bound.

online presence is consciously performative by virtue of the sign; offline 
presence is performative by virtue of differentiation from substance 
(performance = differentiation)

in real life, one is always already continuous and coextensive; in virtual 
life, one is broken, jump-cut, renounced by EOF or kill/delete. virtual 
life, like the dream, controls the mise en scene; real life exhausts and 
tires in its obdurate or 'idiotic' transformations.

in real life, the granularity of distance; in virtual life, the inertia of 
lag. in real life, granularity is stochastic; in virtual life, compression 
codecs. in real life, the quantum/subatomic structure of non-distributive 
logics and superimposition is technical and distant, with peripheral 
effect in the classical/aristotelian life-world; in virtual life, the 
protocol level is continuously effected, just beneath the surface of rep- 
resentation. 

in real life, the inertia and 'rigid designation' of the proper name; in 
virtual life, the fluidity and gaps among logins, passwords, avatars, and 
names. in virtual life, the digital life of binary oppositions; in real 
life, the analog life of gestural superimpositions. 

in digital life, there is nothing whatsoever between position or array x 
and position or array x+1 - between 0 and 1; the other is foreclosed. in 
digital life, there is no truth, only coherent performativities; in the 
real, the truth is messy, noisy, analogic, irreducible, fuzzy. 

in analog life, wear-and-tear, life-span, half-life, noise; in virtual 
life, eternity, the 'clean and proper body.' in analog life, identity; in 
virtual life, equivalence.

i'm jennifer and i know everything. there are bars of pink-red flesh. you
can't go in there. there are shadows as well. the shadows are cool; they
cover the holes. they show you just how dimensional the bars are. the bars
are way in front of the holes. the bars stop the holes from sinking. the
bars stop you from sinking into the holes. the bars hash everything that
goes through them. that is everything gets two variables which access like
indirect addressing. you can't go in straight ahead. you have to go in
with a twenty-eight degree angle. you can fit in with a twenty-degree
angle. you can go in either hole but one of them is more difficult and you
must go in through the bars and change from one to another. everything is
tiny tiny and you can dream with them.  you can only see them and the
scent of them. the scent of them is jennifer and this is all you know of
jennifer and nothing else and jennifer knows everything. jenny sleeps in 
niky. you can see niky too.

"of the real and virtual jennifer, julu, alan, nikuko. of the real, alan
is a character but alan is also a stain or residue, almost always alan
wants to disappear but engrave in stone. alan wants to engrave everything
in stone and then rails against totality. it's almost as if alan wishes
that nikuko speaks through alan, both or nothing come out but different,
not therapy or recuperation or balance, but a mess that takes off on its
own: alan with the 9 millimeter, nikuko, they occupy an aspect ratio. alan
thinks: better to return to coding, almost dead here. and scatter-bombs
and the locus of quality text. ./alan ./azure cannot be executed. execute
./.alan. execute ./.azure. locus of destroyed leaflets: hidden azure /
hidden alan = .azure | .alan - no one passes. pipe damage in the ennui-
sector op. nikuko - she manipulated protocols of alan." "alan was gone
among them and gone among all exhausted women." "alan will be killed off
by all exhausted women"

Minneapolis evening performance residue 2/22/02:


(I performed, then Miekal And. I ran video/still images, wrote the 
following text; all this was projected from a laptop - the text written 
live - sometimes 2-3 videos would play at once - the text brackets the 
audio-visual.)

my work's concerned with language, sexuality, the virtual body and
subjectivity - all of these elements interacting online and off -

i'm concerned with what happens beneath the surface, the coding, the
psychoanalytics, the substances

i'm concerned, i'm very concerned thank you! It's r-rated, not X-rated -
the difference I think is based on penetration? I'm not really sure...

I do codework and what might be considered virtual -body work online. For
example - sorry about the errors - they accumulate - for example the mime
piece I showed yesterday - please exit through that door over there!!!  
<===== sure!!! well, we know nothing about mime. we do know that hmmm...
there are glass boxes and ropes and things and sometimes the hula =-
you've got a bit of all this here - it's like a language mapped across the
body - for that matter the hula is really an exact mapping, azure's
smoking again -

down the stairs, up the stairs, etc. etc. so this seemed a bit boring and
we sent the mimes to hell - heh heh the fire's really hot!

but the digital layer does add something else to it - a kind of sign
imposed on the body from outside - it's through the framework - it's not
present in the space we're performing in... these are darker works...
about a year ago we were at the experimental television center in owego
upstate ny and were able to create a piece i'd wanted to do for a long
time - exploring literal writing on the body - in a kind of presencing of
both sexuality and inscription - that comes next - that's here - the sound
triggers the cameras through an analog synthesizer... we write chinese
ideograms on each other - from an early period of the development of the
characters - we come together, erase them through our contact - we're
apart - we stamp each other with hanko - one at the beginning and one at
the end - I seem to be making less typing mistakes than usual for this
kind of stuff. i showed this in Buffalo and Loss Glazier thought that I
was hmmm... like it was a big movie done but you know better, Minneapolis!

anyway the ideograms are those for breath, circulation, respieration
(heh!), turning, - and above the genitals, a symbol for negation - it's
the same in contemporary Japanese - I'm in the wrong font here...

I'll skip about - to show how this works...  Azure's a lot younger than me
but we're married. we showed some images in the university in Florida and
the students thought she was my daughter... you can have absolutely no
idea what that led to.

this piece with foofwa d'imobilite also uses the five camera setup - he's
a brilliant dancer from switzerland... we did a number of works
deconstructing ballet and emphasizing both the labor and the sexuality
involved -

then of course there are the extensions of these body issues through
mathematics - but these are stationary images - we'll just use the sound -
that was a bit of a lacanian mystery with all those symbols...

but i began to get interested (I began to get interesting? Not on your
life) - I began to get int. etc. in transforming images into mathematical
functions and then modifying them through a program called Mathematica -
it produced the result you see above left but also could modify existing
digital images -

In all of them the body's surrounded by mathesis, a mathematical space
that heightens the contrasted areas... In the movie above left - those are
Azure's nipples mapped onto a mathematical framework, turned into a
three-dimensional mapping which is then deconstructed by transforming
positions and parameters... Azure stood at the end of the dance piece; it
was important that she stood - it brackets the relationship of the males
who were in a kind of competition - the fast guitar - the dahdahdah - the
dance - as if we could overpower each other - the vertical positioning
changed everything -

well, I worked through a character called Nikuko - "meat girl" in Japanese
- who started off as a snack-bar girl and ended up as a demiurge. Azure
played nikuko and I played Doctor Leopold Konninger in a series of texts,
videos, soundworks, and performances. Nikuko would pirouette for Doctor
Leopold Konninger or

anyway as you can see a lot of the work has to do with bodily abjection as
well - the relationship between the body and various forms of
discomfort...

what happens if you map flesh onto asteroids? or onto three-dimensional
space itself - creating convoluted spaces... -

all of this - this section - based on the near earth object (NEO) email
list I belong to - warning me, through NASA, of whatever asteroids are
about to hit the planet. there are also images of flybies (?) flybyes of
asteroids, al silent of course - so I worked on making them work for me...
this is part of a series of works using Nikuko and Dr LK - produced at the
same place using analog synthesizers - they were run as a series at
Millennium Film in NY - you see the references to piroettes here.. she
dances and dances for the doctor. the two of them are locked together like
gears or cams in a localized sexual economy written by george grosz -
there's no escape from it/them, from the obsessiveness -

how did we get here?  the deconstruction of the body, of inscription on or
around the body, of ballet, of writing on the body, of an incipient
sexuality, of machinery and functional gears... we could end with a couple
of things -

Miami Everglads and the welcome movie and then there was the mess of the
Everglades and the violent sexuality of Miami and its highest crime rate
in the country and the corrupt university and civic government and and and
and about Miami, as someone said, Trust me you don't want to go there

but this isn't about Miami so much as about deconstruction and the body
and inscription and sex and language and and and and and ...

just one more runthrough - the "new one" btw (by the way) refers to a
computer i got from the place to use while I was there - it's not THIS
machine - THIS machine is a lot better - I can really DREAM on this
machine - and as you see it allows a lot of movies to play at once.

testing one two three can you hear me?

instruction for decoding:
to find out the value of the 9th letter:
count 9 pairs in: 1,9 gives you the value of the 9th letter.
look at the 9th position in the text; it is "b".
therefore "b" goes in the 9th position.
