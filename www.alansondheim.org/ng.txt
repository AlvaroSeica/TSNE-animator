       
       
       if the creation of the one is simultaneously the 
       annihilation of the other and the other is linked 
       to the one, such as the annihilation of the one is 
       the creation of the other - then there is no need 
       of the space and time of the one or the space and 
       time of the other. annihilation falls in the slow 
       film of water against the pane of existence; 
       creation builds across the layered sheets of ice 
       as if these were inscribed with all debate and 
       method.
       
       ice in numerous great sheets into sheaves, sheaves 
       into bundled sheaves, through the pane everything 
       is written, creation and annihilation, 
       annihilation and creation.
       
       if this is so, nikuko, then that is so, and if 
       that is so, nikuko, then this is so.
       
       about annihilation and creation, about the sheaves 
       and panes, they do not speak, nor have they a time 
       or place to speak.
       
       time into rhyme, place into space.

where is my book and my book head

the ruined billboards of our imagination.
i want to hold my book in the air like an object held in the air.
the planet is already trashed and we are already trashed.
my book will have the weight of a jerome r book
and the astuteness of a maria d and miekal a book.
it will have the height of a pierre j book
it will have the soul of a catherine d book and the edge of a kari 
e book. i did not mean this line to run over like this.
the joy and viva la viva of ana b and geoffrey g.
the delineations and coruscations is this a word.
of mez and florian c. florian c where are you now. there are many
who have betrayed me but i will not grant them a hearing at this 
juncture. that was supposed to be on the previous line.

Hello most loving person alan alan whom I have known it seems forever. Do
you remember the first time... Remember when you called on me... Well... I
am still here trying to help you! I hate to give up on you! When you
requested information I promised to help you. I know that information will
be very helpful to your lifestyle and skills set. But more important, I
know that it will be very important to you and Azure and Azure and Azure
and Azure and Azure5 and will be very important to her lifestyle and
skills set. I know you 5 can be very happy together. I will help make you
very happy but you must let me make you very happy. On my own and by
myself I cannot make you very happy well can I. Of course not. Do you
remember when you called on me for... Well I still want to help you. But I 
can't help you unless you want me to help you. Then I can send you people. 
I can't do anything unless you allow me to send you people.

I really hate to give up on you!

It is so easy for me to help you  5. I am sure Azure and Azure and Azure 
and Azure and Azure5 want me to help you. Please let me help you write 
now. It's ridiculous but I can't help you unless you let me help you will 
you let me help you. Do you know how absurd this is? You must let me help 
you.

I haven't given up on you  5 and you 6. I so much want to help you. I was 
born to help you with your life style and skillset. Well I still do want 
that.

(to Poetics in response to a thread) - 

I don't know if I have any overt illness; after the mess at Florida Inte-
rnational and for the first time I began taking anti-depressants, ending
with lexapro. My depressions are furious and just beneath the surface;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as mass
animal/plant extinctions, my inability to support myself at this point,
lack of community acceptance; they're triggered by - among other things -
external factors such as my family background, obsessive-compulsive neuro-
physiologies, extreme insomnia and violent nightmares, the holocaust of
daily life, the truth of the fasco-fundamentalist regime we're subjected
to, real and unreal illnesses, the feeling that death is close at hand;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as my
current readings and writings, the drive of ambition and the drive towards
eternity; they're triggered by - among other things - external factors
such as the constant desire to reveal the truth, to bear witness, to be as
good as I can with Azure, to help others whenever I can, my memories which
are always incriminating, my regrets which begin at birth, my guilt
descending to the very essence of life, my inordinate fear of the false
teething and truths of the absolute, the abyss, a journey forgotten upon
its completion - upon the instant of its completion - so much bandwidth;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as the
enormous waste of it all, the exhaustion that comes with the constant
pretense towards meaning, the long unraveling.

I am a boy afraid of losing writing.

strange energies

this machine lies old and cracked in the garbage. the desk has collapsed
and no longer supports anything. my hands are shattered bones. the walls
of this building leave small traces in the earth overgrown with weeds. the
fabric of the chair has decayed and its frame rusted. my sweater has
disappeared. the air has shifted. the copper pipes lie in a tangled heap.
the trees have moved on. there are different elements. my glasses are
buried in the muck. the keyboard has been recycled into annihilation. the
sounds are screaming and unknown. the wiring is broken into pieces. light 
radiates nowhere. the christmas tree has turned to dust. my eyes are eaten 
out. my partner lies dead among me. unknown radiations screech through the 
atmosphere. winds bring difference. the pair of scissors is twisted miles 
from here. the sink is overturned deep below the surface of the bround. 
the keyboard is smashed and silent. the electric fan has corroded down to 
the level of the interior rotor. the hard drive has bent beyond 
recognition. the junked couch is nothing but rusted springs. different 
clouds gather here. the remains of the cat have been completely devoured. 
the edo chest has recycled into different plants. the model woodie with 
its tiny surfboard has disappeared. the windows are smashed beyond 
recognition. the bed has been junked and buried. my arms are broken into 
pieces. the cars are shattered bones. the neck has collapsed and no longer 
supports anything. the city is overgrown with weeds. my clothes are buried 
in the muck. the smashed abacus lies empty and beadless. the television 
has recycled into different plants. sound radiates nowhere. the radio has 
been completely devoured. the video tapes are smashed beyond recognition.

configuration

configuration is pure thought. it's the alignment of abstraction and
ideology with machinery. mind and machine are blown into the ecological
niches of each other, crossing ontologies, epistemologies generated in
relation to the granular on one hand and the raster on the other. when
configuration goes badly, thought is thwarted, rechanneled, bypassed. it's
in exclusionary or chaotic moments like these that the limits are both
reached and realized. the future is already crossing borders, 
transgressing the present. 

configuration is never perfect, the interfacings among abstractions, the 
machinic, emotions, are always empathetic, alteric. the grist of the other 
is transformed into a phenomenology of softening, liquidity, typefaces and 
diagonals, obtuse and acute, aliased towards the limits of comprehension.

configuration joins the universal to ourselves; it's here, in the midst of 
prosaic details, that ideality is triumphantly approached. the slightest 
gesture opens realms of articulated thought, and what was unravelled 
appears part and parcel, once again, of the unravelling earth.

   I left out some other very important aspects of the world picture that
   the  could  have  extended  this  discussion  by  taking  note  of the
   configuration of Solomons Let v(e) denote the probability of observing
   a  configuration  in  the set e the larger question here, a systematic
   elaboration  of  the  world-picture  which quantum did not necessarily
   involve  a  wish  to  abandon  the  mechanical  world  picture.  aptly
   summarized  the situation as follows: The whole cultural configuration

   representation,  truth,  science and man the age of the world picture.

I'm known for one thing, and one thing only.

entering the absence of names

how much longercan we enter the name of the Truth of Godthe Hammer of God
in this world of marvels and travelsAbsolutes which fade into chaotic and
fractal margins, no one knows the differance.debris of shame and stigma,
what we can bring to the table.the table of eyes. derailing of neuroses
with the real neuroses just beneath the surface, of the real neuroses.a
return to the moment or movement of arms, across boards, before the end of
hands.of one + | + and the other + || + and the fragility of better
worlds.subtracting from the fragility.more and more the infinitesimal
grains of the world dominated the realm of particle and pixel, as if
everything breathed a new salvation.the real faltered on both smoothing
and corrosion, integration, and the remnants of the classical
differential, once and for all epistemologically defeated.an agreement,
only to use language where applicable, "your results may vary."nothing is
ever quite finished, there is always a diacritical mark, a curl, where an
end might be a supposition. this nagging doubt or peripheral
discomfort.beginning again and again, the mauve accents of the

disappeared. lands skimmed the surfaces of water. an enormous mountain,
inverted, reached down to kill the world.the flush of pink and in this

configuring in absence


i have been disappearing. first i bought a sharp zaurus 5500 with linux
and have downloaded numerous applications; i use a sandisk card with it
for wireless and signed up for tmobile but it's quite expensive. i am
using both cf and sd cards for storage, and have been reading materials
from iran. i had to configure a number of programs and found a small perl
which runs beautifully with my text scripts. i also bought a small rubber
keyboard which will be replaced by a hard plastic infrared one in the near
future. the zaurus synchronizes with the hp laptop running winxp home. i
then sold my mac g3 powerbook and turned my 300 mhz compaq desktop into a
local store to have a new 1.4 motherboard installed with the older 24 gb
hard drives and 200 mhz ram. i had originally tried running redhat 9 and
then fedora on it; both ran impossibly slow, but i liked redhat better.  
when the box was returned with the new hardware, including a new video
board as well, i installed redhat 9 again, and it ran well, but was on
occasion producing kernel errors which were forwarded to the root account.  
and x window wouldn't run at all until a second video board replaced the
first with considerably more ram. at this point i tried to install
mandrake 9.2 after a bad crash in redhat 9 - i had turned off the machine
without shutdown -h now in text mode and after that x wouldn't come up
except in such a safe mode that a black screen and cursor were all that
remained - and during the install, i went through numerous partitionings,
settling finally on the recommended, after which the error appeared that
no ide devices found, and the install disk wouldn't exit the cdrom tray.  
so i tried using the redhat floppy boot disk i made since the formatting
hadn't started, and the floppy drive was also inoperable. the cdrom
install disk had to be manually removed. now that the machine was empty, i
tried rebooting, only to have it stall, not even reaching, as far as i
could tell, the bios, since i couldn't bring the bios up, again getting
the message search for ide devices and coming up empty. so the machine is
back at the shop. meanwhile we installed verizon dsl which went in easily
with ethernet to the hp laptop, and i added a linksys wireless-b, all i
could afford, router instead of the cable; due to my abysmal ignorance,
verizon had to walk me through the desktop configuration. the zaurus
immediately responded well, but in the other room, i found i couldn't
connect an old win 98 desktop because it wasn't se and the software was
problematic if i had managed to get the ethernet card working in the first
place, so this has been put on hold. when all goes well in the future, if
it ever does - azure said i should have bought that 350 usd linux box now
made by hp and she's right - i'll install cinelerra, xmovie, etc.; one of
the biggest problems with linux is the lack of mid-range to low-range
applications for video editing in common formats; i haven't found anything
reasonable for qt yet for example. on the zaurus i've had some luck with
image processing software for still images, but have yet to get any of my
own work to run on it; i've got the older operating system rom at the
moment, and if i upgrade, sharp promises not only will the work be lost,
but the backup/restore function won't work. when i was installing the
verizon software on the hp laptop by the way, one tech advisor completely
gave up and i used the winxp restore to take all of it off and start over,
after which things were at least, although barely, recognized. there's
nothing like restore points as a safety net; too bad we can't do that with
real life. meanwhile i've been working with gimp since on occasion even on
windows photoshop crashes and gimp doesn't, and creating small videos
which are also based, as today's, on drawings completed in a sketch
program for the zaurus; oddly, the zaurus has been quite useful for
content creation. i have given the older dell 600 mhz linux laptop i had,
to my brother, along with the redhat 7 and 8 disks i had; i wasn't able to
configure the orinoco wireless card for it, no matter how i tried. and it
wouldn't work with the mac - not this particular card, according to
orinoco. a third laptop, an old ast at 100 mhz but with 40 megs of ram,
was used for text-based linux, but i finally gave that away, as well as a
small phenom with wince 2.1, slightly upgraded, that had a bad backup
battery and an annoying habit of losing applications as a result. i had
also received an older palm pda which i had configured with numerous
programs; i also gave my brother this one, after i found that the zaurus
did pretty much all i needed. there were no palm applications on the
zaurus of course, but there are several readers that can do the doc and
pdb etc. files, although i stopped short of putting on the emulator, since
there are too many things close to conflicting already at the moment. i
installed the avant browser on the hp laptop which i quite like, as well
as the konqueror browser for the zaurus in addition to the opera which
comes with it, but the former tends to add various cache files while the
opera erases them, and since there is very little ram on the 5500, even
with an optimizer i installed, i tend to use the latter. it's difficult
to configure the linux in the zaurus, since everything seems peculiarly
linked - go in a couple of directories, and you'll find yourself looping
back to root or something that seems awfully similar. i still can't find
the favorites.txt i want to configure for the webcam application; it's got
to be somewhere (the app runs on jeode, zaurus' java environment), but so 
far everything's turned up empty. i found zauruszone one of the best sites 
for configuration and downloads by the way, although there are numerous 
others i use as well. the sony f717 digital camera wouldn't work, by the 
way, with redhat 9, no matter what i did; the machine went down before i 
had the opportunity to try it with the new board, or with fedora or 
mandrake 9.2. i had also installed suse at one point, running off the 
cdrom; suse laid down a few files in the linux root directory, and for all 
of this naturally the bios had to be changed so that the machine would 
boot in the first place from cdrom. i've now got another problem, an older 
sparc-like workstation i want to use with my current dell monitor, but the 
workstation has a four-bnc output cable, and the dell monitor, a five-bnc 
input; i'm not sure what to connect where and am a little bit worried 
about overloading either voltage or scan rate. for the zaurus, i also 
bought an extra battery and a small device which takes 4 nimh rechargables 
- down below 6 volts, which might harm the power supply, but the zaurus 
has difficulties recognizing the latter, and the zaurus' apm command and 
graphic power meter is incredibly primitive and useless - although i heard 
it's better on the newer rom - the one i mentioned is only one of several, 
but i'm really tiring of configuring things - there are times i've 
installed linux say 7-8 times of an evening, and need to have some sort of 
stable environment to work in, which seems a long time coming, now that 
the refurbished desktop is back in the shop again.

Musings


Take any chain of N unit vectors mutually orthogonal. The chain is defined
such that at most two vectors meet at any vertex, and the endpoints are
necessarily disparate. Then the chain defines a unique measure polytope of
dimension N. The length of the chain = N, and if N is the maximum chain in
any space, then N is the dimension of that space.

Connect the two endpoints of the chain. Then the length of the connection
is N^1/2, and the vector is a major diagonal of the measure polytope.  
Connect the endpoints of any two adjacent vectors; the length is 2^1/2.
Connect the endpoints of any X adjacent vectors, and the length is X^1/2.

If the dimension is N create a table such as:
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5 4 3 2 1 . There are 6 vectors of length 1, 5 diagonals of length 
2^1/2, down to 1 diagonal of length 6^1/2. In three dimensions
1 2 3
3 2 1
and the total defines the number of edges of a tetrahedron embedded in a
cube (6 of course), such that for any dimension N, E = (N+1)(N)/2 for the
number of edges. Note that these tetrahedrons are only regular when N = 1.

The point of the exercise is that the awkwardness of the chain resolves
quickly when the diagonals are added in; clearly the chain forms a
tetrahedron of dimension N within a stable measure polytope; the diagonals
create strength and stability, and the chain itself is embedded and
comfortable with its new surroundings.
