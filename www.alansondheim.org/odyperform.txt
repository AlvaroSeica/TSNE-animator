mediaspace =
megafauna = menued = messay = mathesis and data are absolute. >
[15:10] Julu Twine: The signifier's not in the place of pain except for the
observer; for the
person undergoing (severe) pain, there is no place at all: that's the
numbness. The signifier's the report; the distance between the report and
the pain is also painful...
[15:10] Howl Yifu shouts: The first diagram should be described on a
hhurjja-
patra with gorocham and the name of the woman desired, should be written
in it
[15:10] Howl Yifu: /shour if it is heated on the fire of charcoal of
Khaira wood
(Acacia Catechu) in the morning, noon and evening, the woman will be
subdued.
[15:10] Julu Twine: I would say it is beyond reading or non-reading to
realize
that the
emptiness of all signifiers. Every reading fictionalizes this, tells a
story of it, but it is only in non-reading that I really approach the
alterity of your pain.

So, I agree that for the person undergoing the pain there is no place; I
would go further: it is this inarticulate boundary that concerns me. The
signifier of pain as your pain - can I feel this? Only as reversibility,
as my pain (which in a Cartesian sense I would see as like your pain)?

As reader or receiver, I can push reading to impossible limits. I can
strip everything away from the report of the pain, every connotation,
every signification, to the point where I touch at the incised flesh of
the signifier and find the continuous flesh of the world, the great
surface where we all feel. And here it is no longer your pain / my pain.
Here signification is a kind of perturbation, wherein pain and pleasure
blur and float, pleasurepain.
[15:10] Howl Yifu shouts: mathematical ontology and its dynamics (in the
sense
of mathesis) constitute the=basis for our world, our multiverse: every
domain is
entangled.

[15:12] Miulew Takahe is online.
[15:12] Howl Yifu shouts: he becomes subdued. If a mark is made on the
forehead
of the female with tho paste made of gorochanl, root of lemon grass and
saffron,
[15:12] Julu Twine: I think, I think the beyond where "I feel your pain" no
longer is
determined by the symbolics of intersubjective communication is Levinas'
"beyond being," or also, I think, these are the encounters that Lingis
writes of. This phrase "I feel your pain" implies such a beyond. I mean: I
must feel your pain even in the absence of the signifier (and it will be
absent, it is absent). Impossibly so, since pain is always pain for you,
for the one incised. I must feel impossible pain. (I would say this
relates to love as well.)

Not sure I'm going anywhere.
[15:13] Howl Yifu: it's true, i became subdued, i relaxed on the divan,, i
smoked a joint and held a coors in the other hand, i'm challaxing i'm
slave to
you ready to turn over, role over for whatever you want whatever whatever

then

my enlightenment is boundless
my enlightenment breaks your body

of the world's intelligence, ignoring the real
physical devastation the planet shakes upon us. we
hold to the myths of an Internet of totalizing and
infinite connectivity, ignoring the buffeting in
favor of buffering, hold-fasts and clouds which are
still more
[15:27] Julu Twine:  phenomena of the mythos of placing and
placement. the buffeting will necessarily,
entropically, win out in the end, in a version of
Eliot's whimper, and it's this that's forming the
new germ of our cultures, hardly visible, but with
increasing presence as the surface of the planet
continues with its own branding of devastation.
write of buffeting, not buffering, and tell the
truth, while simultaneously the truth, under
erasure and corrosion, is annihilated, while both
voice and comprehension are permanently stilled.
