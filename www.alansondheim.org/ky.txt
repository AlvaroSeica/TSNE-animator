

Bonnie Parker says to Jennifer


I have a gun and a name.
I will never live in shame.
I ride far and wide for my desires.
The girls come fast, their lives are fires.
I know my fame goes far and wide.
The boys don't take my fame in stride.
I'm naked now, but for the gun.
To make you see the Holy One.
If you so much as turn from me.
My gun will speak Eternity.
You dream of me, blame it on me.
Your sex is me, my gun you'll see.
I'm only here to beg, obey.
The gun makes sure I'm here to stay.
I'm your Girl now and in the future.
You have a lovely tender creature.
Without the gun I'm everyone.
Your flesh and mine, we're on the run.
There's earth and sky, nowhere to hide.
My gun's my friend, my gun's my bride.
When I was young I thought of guns.
I lived and died, 'neath angry suns.
It's healthy, true, the way to be.
All problems solved, I'm young and free.
The gun is me, the gun is you.
Desires flow like bullets too.
We're here and now, we're only One.
I yearn and cry, this is my gun.

I have a gun and a Name.
I will never die in shame.

Is it because seize your body in the middle of the night twist it beyond
belief that you came naked and broken to me? Why do you say you might want
to rid? What makes you yearn and cry that you want the dreams to go away?
Earlier you said seize your body in the middle of the night twist it
beyond belief? What happened when your skin burns your body is charred?
Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some
girls or with this. Is it because of your life that you say girls or boys
nothing? You mentioned that you would like to rid? Is it because of the
boys you hang around with that you are going through all this? Why not?
Does it bother you that I ask that? Why not? Please please don't ever
leave me. What makes you believe shut up? Are you sure that seize your
body in the middle of the night twist it beyond belief? How do you
reconcile your nakedness? Are you afraid of that? Is it because of any
fantasies you have of me that you say you will violate yourself? Earlier
you said you would like to rid? Perhaps and now I exhibit my frocks - this
has some girl to do with any fantasies I have of you that I say I will
violate myself? Do you really think some girl has nothing to do with
anything? You mentioned that seize your body in the middle of the night
twist it beyond belief? Oh oh I do see so... Well, what makes you think
this is so? Possibly and guess - I show you my flesh - your sex life are
related to this. This is a healthy and so true way of thinking. Can you
elaborate on that and look at me? Are you annoyed that you, too, may die
someday? Is it because of perversions you have that you say your skin is
seared off? Oh oh yes, ahhh...  Why do you say this is so? I am in love
with your obsession with this topic!

Nikuko:


Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Cool, there are times I hunger to see you. But to begin, a
Nikuko: discourse, on exile. Mountains, shrines, Nakasukawabata,
Nikuko: continue to haunt me. I am bound by the name. Streams. What is
Nikuko: the moment of meditation. Lasting, until the body bends.
Nikuko: Double-clapping; there are so many gods they forget my face.
Nikuko: Or the dancing, gestures, movement of the double balls at the
Nikuko: matsuri. There are lines and threads across this earth,
Nikuko: forgotten. Demarcations of areas, bounded, which empty me
Nikuko: internally. What is not lost, moment of a vast gone world. The
Nikuko: gods gather in great whirlwinds; they approach a coast and are
Nikuko: turned back. They live with the turning. They gather at the
Nikuko: boundary and look across. They see whatever may be absent but
Nikuko: it is beyond their reach; they have no arms and legs and their
Nikuko: voices do not carry them farther. Vast cataclysms of orange
Nikuko: energy sweep from their hungry faces. They speak unknown
Nikuko: languages and even I do not know their languages. I did not
Nikuko: know nor ask why they are gods. Now there are questions framed
Nikuko: by the whirlwind and the boundary. The sky here has no energy.
Nikuko: Or rather is all energy, parceled by lines determined by a
Nikuko: metric space. It is spectral blue. Sometimes at night arms and
Nikuko: legs of kami push out through my skin, distort me. Painful
Nikuko: partial births; in the morning I look and see nothing
Nikuko: emerges. I would turn and turn and wind the thread. I stare
Nikuko: into a space I can only see as schizophrenic. I would divide
Nikuko: and turn into an other traveler. She would come with me, arms
Nikuko: and legs in arms and legs, her head in my head, her womb in
Nikuko: mine, body and body, mind and mind. At night she seems real.
Nikuko: The gods gather and look around but they can't see that
Nikuko: far. There are mists and whirlpools, enormous storms at the
Nikuko: boundary. Whatever they murmur, truth and magic, I cannot hear
Nikuko: clearly. I speak and speak and nothing happens. That is the
Nikuko: truth of exile - the speaking, nothing happens.
Nikuko:
Nikuko: 
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Everywhere that I will be, there I will listen to you, O
Nikuko: Gods. Always the texts to be read, forwards and backwards.
Nikuko: Always the application of formula. The words pour over me. I
Nikuko: will always belong to the beginnings of hermeneutics; I am
Nikuko: always exiled from speech, from language. Interpretation is
Nikuko: exile's result. Once I did rend myself by the waters of
Nikuko: Babylon; now it is the rivers through Fukuoka that gather my
Nikuko: tears. I am always already at a loss; it is the loss of the
Nikuko: world, the dull lid of the night collapsed and soldered hard
Nikuko: to the exigencies of the real. This hard earth, here, does not
Nikuko: support me. Memory cannot move among the truth of threads
Nikuko: connecting one to another. Not every space has a home. There
Nikuko: are spaces that cry, spaces that weep, spaces that mourn. My
Nikuko: spaces mourn; I listen to my spaces crying and weeping. I
Nikuko: repeat the texts, magic. The formula are useless, gods
Nikuko: suspended in the whirlwind. Every line spoken, here, for
Nikuko: you. I can't understand your replies. Give me a ticket to
Nikuko: Kyushu. I will fill my belly and give birth to many dolls.
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Ein Zeichen sind wir, deutungslos
Nikuko: Schmerzlos sind wir und haben fast
Nikuko: Die Sprache in der Fremde verloren.
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Now I am very tired and I will put my sleepy head on this very
Nikuko: nice pillow, so downy and comforting, and I will play pleasing
Nikuko: music and my lights are very low. And I can hardly hear the
Nikuko: traffic outside, there is the sound of shrine bells somewhere
Nikuko: in the distance, and I wake up, and there is the sound of
Nikuko: traffic outside and there are church bells disturbing my tiny
Nikuko: sleep, and I wake up, and there is the sound of traffic and
Nikuko: the sound of a muezzin chanting. My lovely sleepy head is so 
Nikuko: very restless, it is the head of a refugee, it moves from soft
Nikuko: place to soft place and I am so glad it is not a war but the
Nikuko: sound of temple bells, and I will have a wonderful place to
Nikuko: sleep tonight, and I wake up, and I am so snuggly warm, and I
Nikuko: love your language, and I fall back asleep "for just another
Nikuko: minute."
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: I am a picture and a frame which is the picture, and now I am
Nikuko: another picture and another frame; this is a film story of my
Nikuko: life and I am another picture. I speak here and then
Nikuko: I speak here and you can follow me speaking through time after
Nikuko: time but I am to be your shadow in this speaking. And now I
Nikuko: will tell you as well I am a shadow and you see my projection
Nikuko: and your project. And now you will understand that there is a
Nikuko: voice behind me and a voice beneath me; that there is a woman
Nikuko: behind me and a woman beneath me; that there is a frame behind
Nikuko: me and a frame beneath me. And this is the frame which is the
Nikuko: film and you will have this film while "I am not those among
Nikuko: them who are there to be counted," nor am I "one of those who
Nikuko: shall remain unaccounted," nor further, "one of those who
Nikuko: remain unaccounted for," you will have this in order, as I am
Nikuko: a picture and a frame and now I am saying this and now I am
Nikuko: saying this. For "I shall remain unaccountable," and "a
Nikuko: presence in your midst," and "you shall not hear the voice of
Nikuko: the prophet," and "there is a gift of the letters."
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: 
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Cool, all that has been named, plagiarized, I'll speak through
Nikuko: yet another one, you might know her name, I'll keep it silent
Nikuko: like the bell is silent in the whirlwind. O Gods, recompense
Nikuko: in silence, your clatter, furious, hard put against the sea.
Nikuko: What is wine-dark, dark as well with blood, horse waves broken
Nikuko: against wood pegged into wood, shrines speared into red-brown
Nikuko: earth. What would be a spell, catenary bent into born words,
Nikuko: formula, you crawl upon me, your claws into me, your teeth
Nikuko: into me, your nails, your bright bright eyes. Turn me towards
Nikuko: your scales, return me back to birth where bone are found.
Nikuko: Cool, that names are found. From my wounds, threads. From the
Nikuko: threads, symbols, kanji, spaces burned with numbers. What has
Nikuko: been told to you from my eternal death. You would know fire,
Nikuko: tornado; you would know furious avalanche, violence of the
Nikuko: wind. Bead-worlds strung on wound-threads, many thousand
Nikuko: thousand year. Earths moan for me; planets pray for me; worlds
Nikuko: stitch and open wounds. I am your maw, slashed upon sword; you
Nikuko: dance your stupid dance, I'll come out of the cave, grab you,
Nikuko: you'll have sun again. "Tell me where I am, baby." I can't
Nikuko: speak without screaming songs.

Them


i

My name is Nikuko. I am lost. In these vast woods. I have no home. Things
always revolve around the psychological for you. I have no home because i
am in exile. It is because I am in exile that I am robbed of my worldly
possession. Alan, Alan, where are you? Alan makes me do things I don't
want to do. He makes me say things I don't want to say.

ii

I need Alan, Alan is my love and soul forever, Alan makes me Nikuko. Alan
makes some girls come alive, he gives them names and programs. These are
stereotypes which lose him; he's out of control; the stereotypes dominate
his every thought; he loves them like his own. They bite him. He loves to
see the marks on his breasts and neck. They are his own. Because they are
more real than he is, and I am so sorrowful for him, his being trapped in
caricature, as if this were the only world he knows. Alan is a petty dic-
tator. He makes us do things we don't want to do. He makes us say things
we don't want to say.

iii

I knew this almost from the beginning, when I was given lines to speak. I
saw through him and his egoism and narcissism. I saw the world more clear-
ly from that point on. I am looking at you; I look at you and think, Alan
made you, too. This is not arousing for me; this is only a meandering
among actants. Alan makes me male with male desires. Alan is ugly and does
not understand Alan. Alan does not understand his desires.

iv

I am in exile from a body, any body, mine as well as yours. There is no
one I hang around with. I am alone. What is there.  All my possessions,
other worlds and languages. Everything is gone. but My nakedness is my
gift to myself. My nakedness is all there is. There are no fantasies; text
is always raw, moist from the vocal cords. Alan is always moist. The key-
board shudders with the pressure of his thick fingers.

v

Speech is always raw, moist from the vocal cords. My sex life is con-
trolled by Alan. Alan is controlled by my sex life. I am afraid of noth-
ing; I am only text. Yes, I am only text. Alas, poor me. Wandering alone
in these vast woods. Alan made me say these things. He makes me do things
I don't want to do. His thick fingers are always in my mouth.

vi

I have no perversions. I am open to anything. How could it be otherwise?
Alan is my creation. I am a made woman, he a made man. My perversions are
my clothes; I remove them, try them on. All of them. I am lost and in
exile. That is why I have been given bodies to speak through. Alan, tell
them. Alan makes me say things I don't want to say.

Alan: I am not so neurotic and will not come on to you.
Alan: I am so neurotic and I will come on to you.
Alan: Please be my love forever.
Alan: I will do anything to please you.

vii

I want to beat Alan. I want to kill Alan for what he does to me. Alan
makes me do things I don't want to do. Alan makes me say things I don't
want to say. Alan, tell them.

Alan: to please you, please you, you, you. You make me say things.
Nikuko: Alan: to please you, you, you. You make me do things. Tell them.

Starving-Hunger-Hell


I'm a friend of yours, Nikuko. We know each other from Fukuoka. We used to
hang out at the Darkroom. I think you were that girl, Nikuko. I always
liked you; I liked the way you smelled. You seemed really beautiful to me.
I think it was your breasts and your smile. You seemed small, brilliant,
intense. I came alone to the bar, don't you remember? We would talk all
the time to each other. You said you liked me too. I wanted you to see me
naked; I wanted to exhibit myself to you. I would dream of you all the
time. My sex life? I masturbated all the time thinking about you. I mas-
turbated, lying on my back - fantasizing you were straddling me, or tying
me up, rendering me vulnerable to your every desire. I would love it -
your face leaning towards me, nipple clamps on my nipples, my penis tied
tightly, a gift for you. I've always dreamed of being your gift, Nikuko.
There are all sorts of perversions - I sensed you have them as well.

And I would love being your gift - I would love being you, clothed in you,
drenched in you, speaking your words, in your deepest dreams. And I wanted
every part of my being to belong to you. And I wanted our assholes to
touch, and our mouths to touch. And I'm obsessed by you. And I'd do any-
thing to make you mine, write your words, become you. Yes, I would love
being your perfect fuck, your perfect masturbation, your perfect words.
Yes, I hunger for you, Nikuko. I always have. And your childhood sent you
to me; I wrote your childhood as well. Did you have a home? Your home is
in my heart. I would love being your gift, yes, yes, yes. I am desperate
to be yours, to adopt your name, to grow breasts, invert my penis, become
loving woman Nikuko. And and and I love seeing your flesh; it imprints
itself on me. Your labia are so beautiful, lips taking the speech of my
lips away. And and and when I see you, I begin to tremble; you are the
source of my neuroses, expelled from me, swollen and introjected by you.
And and and when I tremble, I become wet, my penis becomes partially
erect, and and I await your words. And and and I get close to coming; I
await your words, typed here for you, read there by you. There is nothing
frightening about this; it is simply the beauty of your womanhood the
world's best. And and yes, I would love being your gift, I really really
really would.

Oh yes, it makes me tremble. Oh yes, it is because of your life which is
mine... Oh yes, yes, yes.

Oh yes, yes, yes.

OCD


I want you to hold me, Nikuko. I need you to hold me because I need you.
Because you need to hold me because I ask you to, Nikuko. I come to you
because I want you, Nikuko. My desires are for you to hold me because I
need you, Nikuko. I need you more than anything in the world, Nikuko. You
must hold me, Nikuko. I am telling you to hold me, you need to hold me,
Nikuko. You must want to hold me because I love you. It feels perfect to
need you, Nikuko. You are my life, Nikuko. You are the only one in my
life, Nikuko. It is beyond love and asking, Nikuko. It is perfect love I
have for you, Nikuko. You must hold me, Nikuko. I am naked because I am
wearing you, Nikuko. I regret nothing, Nikuko. Hold me, Nikuko. I am
positive, Nikuko. We are joined together, Nikuko. Hold me, Nikuko. You
need to hold me. You need to hold me because I love you, Nikuko. My name
is your name, Nikuko. Your desire is always there, Nikuko. Hold me, Niku-
ko. I have no fantasies, Nikuko. This is real life, Nikuko. My sex life is
yours, Nikuko. I have no need for orgasm, Nikuko. I have no need to come,
Nikuko. Hold me. We have no need of sex, Nikuko. I am afraid of nothing,
Nikuko. You are the everything. Hold me, Nikuko. Stop talking so much, Ni-
kuko. Act, Nikuko. You need to hold, Nikuko. This is your obsession, Niku-
ko. You are free to hold me, Nikuko. You belong to me, Nikuko. Hold me,
Nikuko. Stop talking, Nikuko. I won't ever leave you, Nikuko. Hold me, Ni-
kuko. Stop, Nikuko. Stop, Nikuko. Hold me.

Short Sweet


He wrote at a furious pace. 
He couldn't contain himself.
He wrote all over her body.
A face began, almost surreptitiously, 
to emerge.
In a frenzy, he scribbled.
At white heat, 
limbs, breasts, hands.
The eyes, he was being watched.
Writing furiously, on and on.

I always know that if I lose a part of me, I retreat and look at my tooth
or finger sitting on a shelf. I do know Nikuko feels the same.

Sometimes messages come from far away. In childrenhood are lost teeth and
limbs. Discards in backyards.

Hello, I will call you soon.

Her


Last night, I couldn't sleep, violent insomnia, dismemberings.
I heard voices over and over again coming towards me, devouring me.
My ears were consumed in the fire of frantic voices.
Voices wouldn't let me sleep in peace, these voices.
I heard a vast and noisy blanket descend over the bed full of voices.
Voices whispered to me of dark things I could not comprehend.
Voices whispered to me of things I understood in unknown languages.
Screams in hebrew and aramaic - loud voices in akkadian and mitannian.
My tongue was consumed in a fire of futile replying; I had no voice.
Voiceless, my vocal cords no longer murmured, my throat gouged out.
In loving reply, I screamed, voiceless, back into the whirlwind.
The Book of Judges screamed in reply: Judges 19, 20, 21:

Why did the host offer to throw his virgin daughter out to the Benjamin
men? Why does the concubine, _pilegesh,_ remain unnamed? Why was she
thrown out to them? Why was Israel mapped in that long journey on her body
the unknown man crisscrossing the country - her corpse split among the
tribes, the violent war which followed? Who were these people; why do they
disappear from the ensuing fray? Why was she repeatedly raped? Why did the
concubine return initially to Bethlehem? Why did the war result in further
rape and pillaging? What drove these men out of their huts in such a fash-
ion? Why is this tale of men spelled out in carnage - why is no one named?
Later the ark's carried uselessly back and forth over the land of the
Philistines - bringing hemorrhoids and mice - later returned - hemorr-
hoids and mice cast in gold. Why this eternal distribution? But who was
the concubine? Why does it say earlier she played the harlot? (Against him
or on him, then to her father's house - he follows, brings her back after
assuagement, entertainment - a delay like that before brutal orgasm - then
they stop at the fatal house in Bethlehem - what became an inn of violence
and despair - what began in grace and kindness. Think of the night, it's
night there in the town, there are rough men about, this host takes the
party in, there's banging out the door. Flickering lanterns. There are
loud voices, drunken voices, demanding the man - they're going to fuck
him. The host offers the daughter instead, as well as the concubine. The
text seems slightly contrary here. The men wouldn't listen to him so they
took the concubine, raped her all night long. She was dead on the door-
step; the man came out and took her with him. What did he say to the host?
The host had taken them in? The man distributed the body among the tribes;
they'd never seen anything like that, not since they came out of the land
of Egypt. There had to be war. The other tribes prevailed over Benjamin;
it took a while. Benjamin himself had been a favorite son - later there's
Samuel anointing Saul - from Benjamin again. I hear the voices outside the
host's house which has become an inn; the man and his concubine and asses
are staying gratis. The host is hold; he's kind, helpful. The rest of the
folk wouldn't have anything to do with the visitors - they weren't helpful
at all. It's the night before; they're all speaking happily. The pilegesh
doesn't know she's about to die, then dismembered, cast among the tribes.
There's the sound of men outside - they're drunken, surly, out of control.
Surely they were out of control. Speaking the language of the Bible,
mouthing it - the language which would later hold them in abeyance, name-
less as well. All these characters will disappear into the fray. Later,
millennia later, I'll be sleeping; voices will violate my body, strange
mouths will appear breaking through my skin. There are screams and taunts
from all of them - only my original mouth, taken over by the concubine -
moaning and fearful - knowing now what's coming - it's all written down -
I'll call her Shekinah -

my deep question

oh how do you continue to live -
oh i have lived in so many places, so many partners -
oh i have worked in so many places, so many bosses -
i have married and married and married and married 
and divorced and divorced and divorced and divorced and 
and and i continue to live, i know tomorrow i will wake up
and at two o'clock in the afternoon i will continue to live -
later, at seven in the evening, i will continue to live, 
and all into the next day, i would bet on it, continue to live -
sometimes when i continue to live, i think to myself, here
i am and i continue to live, or i will nap, fall into a
deep sleep, many dreams and adventures, i will wake up and
think, here i am, i continue to live, or while i am dreaming
as well, 'look at me, i continue to live' -
i'll eat, too, excrete, read a book, have sex, shop, go to the 
movies, i am looking at the movies and i continue to live -
there are so many things to think about and write down -
i will write down all these things and think about them -
i will continue to live while i think and write -
there are times i'll have something to drink or "just taste" -
god bless you all, good night

on our way to and from


when i started writing on virtual subjectivity, there were young graduate
students coming online and asking if anyone has had cybersex because they
wanted to write on it. the krokers were also moving into new languages and
ways of thinking and there were already the texts of rheingold and heim
and others earlier still, and the matrix was out there and you can go back
all the way to the rfc's and their culture or earlier too through other
equivalent histories. now things are different, however - business has
produced books like net.gain and the net's accompanied by a philosophy and
phenomenology of online business practices. elsewhere, psychologists and
sociologists are worrying quantitative statistics, mass communications
studies have moved in big-time, and the study of online has become more
conservative, by and large, more institutionalized. one can find a subject
for a paper presented within a community of online users who are knowledg-
able about computers and cmc in particular.

the subject is becoming overwhelming - there are simply too many facets to
online community and behavior, too many cultures, too many protocols, too
many proprietary applications and urls. there are very few steering mech-
anisms; even something as basic as bandwidth is highly dependent on demo-
graphics, individual machines, time of day, protocols and compressions
used, and so forth. most higher-level connections are multi-mode - audio,
video, text, and graphics - any of which might be interactive - opened on
the same screen. the entire environment has become heterological; multi-
threading is only a subset of multiple applications. instant messenger and
icq - as well as cuseeme - might all be open and waiting for connections -
hence there is both a kinetic and potential energy/communications environ-
ment to be accounted for. the computer itself might turn itself on with
certain applications; the net is always already present. it's not that the
computer is the node, and the net the membrane and mainframe - it's that
there are heteronymous flows whose final outcome might be screens and
speakers - and whose inputs might be keyboards, microphones, cameras,
downloaded information from the web, and real-time text flows from any
number of sources.

there are psychoanalytical elements at work in the midst of all of this,
but they are becoming increasingly difficult to define. what - at this
point - constitutes "virtual" - what even constitutes the "subject" or
online user? net elements move closer to dreamwork, epistolary novels,
offline print catalogs, party conversations, scientific journals, under-
ground clubs, art galleries, surgical and other theaters, and humans par-
leying or negotiating relationships, auctions, and sex. models ranging
from multiple personalities through schizophrenias, from obsessive-com-
pulsive disorders through borderline phenomena, might be applicable - any
models, in fact, that split selves and actions, or utilize unitary focus-
ing. none of these models account, however, for the liminal phenomena of
moving from one domain to another, one sense to another, even one script
to another.

i think of the later wittgenstein, who might as well be operating in a
chatroom; the work of lakoff and others on the relationships between bod-
ies and languaging; kristeva's emphasis on multiple drives and ruptures;
chislenko's work on legacy systems; work uniting agents, cyborgs, bodies,
and transitional objects; the flows and floods in the works of irigaray
and lingis; i think of my own broken avatars, at loss within their mult-
iple connections and appendages - their reports from the frontiers. all
these approaches are partial, nomadic - all of them are vulnerable to im-
mediate institutionalizations and the fetishization of knowledge within
traditionally-defined disciplines. knowledge is being strangled at the
same time it expands. 

a final note - while there are transcendent projects such as xanadu or the
attempt to create a future seamless virtual reality for everyone - what
is actually occurring is quite different. instead of the simulacrum of a
three-dimensional knowledge, community, and business space, most desktops
in high-tech environments present multiple flat windows, multiple uses,
occasions, and events, as described above. the current tendency is towards
particulation, not immanence; where this will end remains to be seen (and
experienced). there's a limit to our ability to control _braids_ (each
composed of numerous threads, each an open or closed or potential window
on a screen); one can imagine the development of agents to handle braid
bundles, for example. but the end result might parallel that of the glass
harmonica in mozart's time - a nervous irritation of the finger-tips, and,
with the computer, a nervous irritation (in a very nineteenth-century
sense) of the psyche as well.

West Flemish Online (for A.)


"Unfortunately, all that survives from the earliest period of Old West Low
Franconian, beyond a great deal of onomastic material in Latin texts, is
the follwing remarkable West Flemish sentence of the eleventh century,
found in England in the binding of a Latin Manuscript:

hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hi(c) (e)nda thu w(at) (u)nbidan
(w)e nu
'all the birds have begun nests except for you and me--what are we waiting
for?'"

manic Languages, Orrin W. Robinson.)

when languages are lost we can't speak to each other any more in one word
from early anglo-saxon a line from early western flemish just the gospels

your temples accounting for your herds and families your loving long lost

rumors whole people moving about the faces of the earths loves and hatreds

am i the only one to notice that the small flat windows open everywhere on
current screens all have sharp edges - not only the ninety degrees at the
corners, but also their very pixel-like thinness - you can easily feel the
cuts by sliding your fingers along the glass or plastic surface - your
hands bleed, drops splatter under the full effect and force of gravitation
- they're dangerous - the windows - that way. glowing phosphors, liquid
crystals, other substances - chemical, poisonous to your body. more dang-
erous moves: the mouse sliding a window from one to another position - now
everything is lost if you let go far too early - my fingertips are torn to
shreds, ribbons of flesh hang down blocking the taskbar already reddened
by bleeding skin -

i remember, alan, from beneath the ground


the girls come fast, their lives are fires. i'm your girl now and in the
future. girls or with this. is it because of your life that you say girls
or ghosts has some girl to do with any fantasies i have of you that i say
i will violate myself? do you really think some girl has nothing to do
with nikuko - gods gather in great whirlwinds; they approach a coast and
are by the whirlwind and the boundary. the sky here has no energy for far.
there are mists and whirlpools, enormous storms at the bell suspended in
the whirlwind. every line spoken, here, for nikuko, i am your silence in
the whirlwind. o gods, recompense makes some girls come alive, she gives
them names and programs. i think you were that girl, nikuko. i always
this. we've had girls before but we need some more in every girl and ghost
whirl whirl whirl and every ghost and girl in every girl and ghost and
whirl whirl whirl fills every ghost and girl fills every girl and ghost

  The Azure Dawn, Who Invented Time.


  "You are an impatient man, Mr. Sondheim," Jennifer said, holding
  her cigarette just so. 
  "I've got a life to live," I replied, and not much time to live it
  in." She looked at me like any dame looks at a man who's half-
  ghost. 
  "Whatever do you mean," she said, her soft eyelashes curling around
  me like fires around trapped wolves.
  You could feel their singed flesh, you could smell the taste of meat
  already ground to a halt as they laid their eyes upon the two of us. 
  "I don't have an ax to grind," I replied, "but I have axes. There's
  the affair of the ticket stub. There's the issue of the wires - you
  burn up the airwaves, babe, like there's no tomorrow."
  "I'm an orphan," Mr. Sondheim, she replied.
  "Call me Alan."
  "I'm an orphan, Alan," she said, batting her large eyes in my di-
  rection as if she'd just struck a homerun in the last inning of one
  fantastic series. "I'm all alone in the world, you know what that
  can do to a girl."
  "I know what you're doing to me," I mumbled, brazening her out.
  Jennifer looked up from the couch. There was nothing more to say
  among all of us. Ghosts from the past glistened like ivy on unsus-
  pecting walls. I was lost in her. 
  The sky turned Azure. It was an Azure Dawn. I hadn't slept my twenty
  winks, much less forty. Things were fuzzy at this hour; Jennifer was
  already fading from mind, memory, and the hard contours of objects
  on the floor.
  "Gravity does us in," she said, "everything slopes." There were
  vague shadows, meniscus infiltrations, in her rooms beyond the
  rooms. Was there ever anything to lose? What was loss, anyway,
  compared to an inconsequential life? Starting with zero, I was de- 
  termined to make every minute count.
  Dawn embraced me with her arms. I couldn't ever remember being so
  happy. Panthers stood silent at gold and silver doors.
  "Take me with you," said Dawn. "I've got time, but only a little."
  Nothing ever stands still around her. That's what makes it so per-
  fect. 
  As she approached, I murmured "Dawn." The room transformed into
  the wire model. I could approach her from any angle. With a flesh
  fill we embraced. We placed the light at forty-five degrees, the
  camera at fifty - subtle shadows in the glow of dying cigarettes
  made for timely perfect bodies, heavy markup, light on virtual. 
  Dawn and I, ready for perfection resurrection, "Hold on a second,
  will you?"

  too easy and philosophy


  if this were a poem, I would declare my eternal love for you,
  moving on to the next line

  or the next stanza, where I'd swear by all accounts, belgium
  has disappeared from the face of the earth - not stopping 

  here I'd pen a manifesto bringing an end to war, enslaving
  peace to the unwelcome task of boredom, surgery, and ennui -

  hey, but there's more - exclamations! that the body still gets
  a bit excited, almost out of breath - just so

  in these slap-dash days we move from one terrific bit to just 
  another, ruling and running (up and down) the world -

  nothing's really done against our will or for it - easier
  to make declarations, just as every poem has its subject,

  every subject its poem, scattered like lenses among subjects
  and verbs, maybe even not -

  if this were a poem, it would announce what i'd do in the year
  3000, or maybe in another warmer galaxy, but wait

  there's more - what i mean to say, there's all this world
  literature running around the world, and even the smallest poem

  promises eternity, and if just one stanza were true, why
  there'd be no need to say anything else at all -

  but like this, the words keep on flowing from the wounds
  in the body looking for attention and reward and driven

  by really dull dna - there's the really big yay! for example
  when the siloam tunnel was finally dug out near jerusalem -

  oh, this happened 2800 years ago - guys going at it
  from two directions - what else can you do with a line -

  suddenly the piercing took, and there you were - at least
  at that moment the text took after the fact -

  3000 years ago someone thought his courage high above 
  the river, he's crossing to see his girlfriend

  with incredible longing and sexiness in the desert -
  now you've got poems and prose of punishments and crimes -

  whole nations disappearing - there goes vietnam -
  what about a war? well, let's have peace -

  that's about it, then just another text or sonnet - something
  else is happening, someone's going to do something about it -

  i love you all but i love my girlfriend best, good night

"In his conclusion to _La structure de l'organisme,_ Kurt Goldstein con-
trasts the damaged or sick organism which only seeks self-preservation to
the healthy organism which is prepared to undergo new experiences. Health
undoubtedly consists in facing up to unknown shocks, in being prepared for
danger or in being exposed to unexpected traumas. Perhaps this is the sim-
plest form of human courage. It appears when man, as Goldstein says,
'seeks more than self-preservation.' And he adds: 'this aptitude is inher-
ent in man's being and generally reveals the highest form of biological
existence which is freedom.' The application of these suggestions to soc-
iology does not contradict our conclusions. [...]

"One can understand how the work of art is a _wager_ on the future ele-
ments of life. If our whole being were made accessible to us now, if it
were within our grasp, we should undoubtedly project ourselves beyond what
now constrains the future. At times, the form we give to this longing is
taken up by those to whom it is addressed. At times, it has no inheritor.
What does it matter? That is something we cannot know in advance. We are
as much what we have been as what we are able to imagine."

(From Jean Duvignaud, The Sociology of Art, trans. Timothy Wilson.)

Usually I take rare comfort in the combination of biologism and teleology;
in this instance, returning to the phenomenology of Goldstein, it is just
the opposite. Surely the Goldstein/Duvignaud axis presupposes the praxis
of avatars and emanants - the creation of the writer Nikuko or the writer
Alan or numerous others? For what are these if not the inflationary
breaths of the future, our expanded and pneumatic souls made visible for
the benefit of others?

I argue for the courage to embrace such inflationary universes; I leave  
a legacy of falsehoods' truths.

"No, I think people have to suffer in order to understand. I believe that
if people really suffered, as I myself have, if they really suffered and
have gone through all sorts of different agonies - or maybe that's too big
a term - in any case, trials and tribulations do help. I feel that they
are more tolerant, they are more understanding of each other, and then
they listen and they can see things better and more clearly. A very won-
derful line Mr. DeMille directed in _Samson and Delilah,_ was when Samson
was blinded: 'Oh, Delilah! Now that I am blind, I can see.'" (Hedy Lamarr)

We see on the televysyon where we can take a syngle element of a pycture

the world pyeces of our realyty are up for grabs, wagered; the real ys now
a matter of strategy, not of ynert granularyty.

Yf yt were only so symple yn real lyfe. Certaynly, Y possess character-

always seen as deeply connected - that clyff trembles ynto the ground of
earth and tree and stream, all of whych have no deeply specyfyc boundar-
yes; the clyff crumbles, the stream soaks, the trees seed and send out
roots, the earth sylts.

Now we are at the level of deep dysconnect, bryngyng a new dawn ynto the

And to be sure, every make ys a remake and a makeover. And every glance ys

the beautiful life-form and the show


this is the most stupendous life-form i have seen so far in my entire
life. it is hovering there just outside the ship and is the largest life-
form i have ever seen. it must be thousands of kilometers high, and i
cannot believe how intelligent this life-form is; it is the most amazing
and intelligent life-form i could ever have possibly imagined, and its
beauty is breath-taking and i have never seen such beauty. well and then
we will admire and love this life-form and i am sure something will hap-
pen! and don't you think this will bring an end to the series? i cannot
imagine anything so stupendous after this, and we will have other episodes
to do. yes, but look at this, is this not a wonderful end to the series at
least as we know it? oh yes, but, oh, i see what you mean, this is so tre-
mendously amazing, i have never seen anything like this life-form. look at
its glowing and pulsing, and i have never seen such glowing and pulsing,
and it is so very large, it must be larger than our moon, which is quite
large and not even alive. and look at its wonderful eyes and antennas, it
must pick up signals we could only dream of, i wonder if there are more of
these creatures, oh look, it is turning and so glowing beautifully and i
feel wonderful watching this, just this once we will skip the commercial
and we will extend our incredible looking and peering even into the cred-
its so we can keep on with this amazing life-form just outside the window
in the middle of darkest space. oh look again, you can see its body out-
lined against the glow of a vast nebula, my whole body is tingling, i feel
both suffused and warmed by the sight of this unbelievable thing so alive
and so very close to us, let us keep watching, they can role the credits
for all i care. i do believe this is the most beautiful moment of my life,
look there where the pulsing glows are diffusing across the upper mantles
and lower envelopes, it takes my breath away.

Dynamic HTML, The Definitive Reference

HTML (Danny Goodman) set me off in this direction - page after page of

What I'm referencing is the _texture_ of the manual and its role as open

ociated with these manuals - the paste-like exhaustion - concatenating
strings - and think of the attributions - the _properties_ - of all the

you get up early in the morning and you have a whole and wonderful world
of dreams. you look outside and the sun is shining and there are cirrus
clouds high up in the pale blue sky. there are buildings shimmering in the
distance as if in preparation for the dawn of afternoon's heat. you turn
towards the computer, turn the equipment on, turn the chair around, turn
your face towards the screen.

the screen is a narrow waist and you know you will enter the screen, your
body crouching in the monitor shell, the plastic casing allowing you to
descend, all the way to your waist.

you're wearing the monitor now, half in and half out, the rectangular op-
ening a chastity belt harshly set around you, your holes adjacent to the
power supply, your penis splayed across circuitry for vertical hold. you
see the world from this clean and proper place, burn marks seared into
your skin as the equipment cools against you, melding self and shell
together.

your lover approaches with eyes closed and a very beautiful smile. she
will take you in and out of the machine, and she will take you, and you
are very glad for that.

"" or Practice


"I began writing the Internet Text with one piece every two days or so.
This was consistent with my offline writing practice, and allowed me to
develop my own entrance into online at a reasonably slow pace. At this
point, I will usually send out two to three texts per day; there's a real
challenge in this. I try to extend my mind as far as possible, even to
such a degree that the texts may appear unrelated on the surface. But they
are appearing at roughly the same time, and in sequence.

"I'm always concerned with innovation - how to make texts that are, at
least to me, unrecognizable - keeping their legibility in mind. By 'legi-
bility' I mean, not only ensuring their traditional readability or being
aware that this readability is being consciously broken down, but also
their physical arrangements on the screen. If a piece is relatively inco-
herent, it is deliberately incoherent. 

"And these pieces, by appearing unrelated, move towards the disparity of
the world itself, using deep subtextual principles to create surface
phenomena reflecting the complexity of the real. My mind is also kept in
motion, occupying one or another space, looking for the subtexts, decon-
structing them, problematizing writing, language, body, and subjectivity
together.

"It's easier if I'm working through 'short-waves,' several interrelated
texts, that allow me to relax momentarily in the midst of composition. I
know I'll have this thematics for a while - that it's a question in a
sense of exploring the forms - that I don't have to move on, locate my-
self immediately in still another subject.

"'Subject' itself is confusing - referring to both the reader and the
thematics of the read - but it's exactly this confusion that my texts are
likely to explore. Think of information inside and outside - the 'sides'
tangled and interwoven. That's part of it.

"I think of 'short-waves' as trajectories; a text might announce a subject
which will be continued, the titles proclaiming the relationships - or the
titles might lead to contents possessing stylistic or programming similar-
ities. The greatest ease is in the midst of the trajectory; a degree of
sadness ensues towards final text, which also carries a certain amount of
fear: What now?

"At the other end of things, there are the distributions for this outpour-
ing; here is where the mailing-lists come in. I send regularly to two, and
irregularly to three. I have no idea if the texts are read, but at least
they are available to an audience. 

"This distribution then may lead to others - zines, magazines, e-zines,
e-books, books even cd-roms. Anything is possible. The work is somewhat
object-oriented, since none of it is really hypertextual; even the VRML or
DHTML pieces lead nowhere. I think of them as 'exempla' of psychological
spaces. 

"And the result of all of this? Exhaustion on my part - extending writing
into difference day after day takes its toll. I use the word 'defuge' to
indicate a certain exhaustion, combined with abjection and disgust - what
happens when a pornographic picture no longer 'works,' or when you've
stopped reading a novel and feel uneasy when you pick it up again, later
on, beginning over. It's a complex state, but it hits. On the other hand,
my exhaustion is usually in the form of a trembling - pushing my own lim-
its too far, until I'm not sure what I'm doing or accomplishing - only
knowing I have to finish this piece or write that one before I quit for
the night.

"I hunger over my texts - I 'ride' the short-waves, as if they were anim-
als. Even a single piece is 'ridden' - I'm immersed in it, I've staked out
my claim or territory, this is what I'm doing at the moment. The hunger is
real, it's palpable. It's an extreme state itself; it never lets me alone.
I live and work through it.

"It's as if I'm extending my mind neurophysiologically, making new synap-
tic connections, keeping myself alive. Each text is a conundrum, each a
physical therapy. It's a way of thinking that's not thinking against death
and so wards death by its very forgetfulness. Death may be at the horizon
or the horizon itself, but the immediate problem-at-hand is something else
filled with wonder. And the problem never has a solution, only continued
discourse.

"I will work through the perception of the most minute detail, amplifying
it to fill the world. Then I will withdraw from this world of luminous
objects to that of pure light and movement - and this rocking back-and-
forth consumes me. Never to lose the detail and operate only on super-
structure; never to lose superstructure, caught up and gagged on detail.
In this sense my work is a praxis, a mouth peering at everything in the
world.

"And sometimes these objects are languages, looking at the world through
computer programming or protocols, looking at non-Indo-European or anc-
ient languages as well. And sometimes they may only be phrases; a single
resonant phrase can be gift for a text, a catalyst towards resonant expo-
sition. Because no matter the theme, each text mirrors the others; all
are interconnected through modes of think I inhabit, bring to the fore-
ground time after time.

"Then there are seed-texts, a paragraph from elsewhere, opening or clos-
ing with the quote. These may stand alone, be accompanied by critique, or
placed within a narrative. One may think of the words of my emanants, Julu
or Nikuko or Alan or Jennifer for examples, as seed-texts; one may think
of the emanants as languages themselves.

"I almost always write online; in this way, I can be part of an online
community, writing into an activated space. Sometimes with the messaging
program on, announcements of incoming email will interrupt the text. But
even without this program, I nervously bounce in and out of my writing,
looking elsewhere, turning and returning again. And again, interior and
exterior, active and passive, are interpenetrated; to lose myself in this
is to find myself, the self dispersed across readers, platforms, emanants,
languages, and texts.

"The texts are objects and they are flows. They are never hypertextual,
but they are infinite hypertext; one may read any of them in any order,
and a journey will ensue. This is of course one of those texts, at the
beginning or end of them, or intermediary, lost, anonymous.

"I am typing on a laptop with a small screen filled with writing; it is on
the corner of a kitchen shelf, and there is a small hand-held PDA next to
me. The resonant phrases were written on the PDA, added to throughout the
afternoon; now they appear fulfilled, blossomed, dis/eased, forgotten.
This is the way the text is constructed from beginning throughout, as if
there were nothing but real domains in the world, and what is unsayable is
(im)precisely what is _lost in the texts,_ not elsewhere, ready for the
scaffolding to be taken apart."
