my acoustic long-necked saz was adjusted by
Amir Vahab; new pegs, nut, string-guides,
strings, and bridge were put on. i've had 
to shim the bridge slightly; i think weather
affects this instrument. here are two pieces
with the new setup. hope you enjoy; they 
were, as much as anything, tests of the saz
which include me getting comfortable with it
again. Amir also adjusted the frets, which i
think is a difficult process. it's a joy to
play!

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/amir2.mp3 
 - electric saz -

this instrument has surprisingly expressive
capability, although the smooth sound is 
reminiscent of jazz guitar and the like. 
but its speed! - allows my fingers to dance
on the neck, exploring the tuning (which 
Amir set, and which for me is unusual - 
roughly GFC, but with the octave strings,
none of the courses is really higher than
any of the others; instead, the cycle 
around. this might be my fastest instrument
although the acoustic cura cumbus is a 
close second. listen if you have the time,
with electric saz, you can multi-task, do
something else, run this in the background.

TAKSIM Collaboration


Ongoing work for a collaboration between Murat, Azure Carter, Maria 
Damon, and myself:


============================================

Murat Nemet-Nejat

Alan Sondheim created a text out of my memoir essay "Istanbul Noir." Here 
it is. At the end, I am appending the first three paragraphs of the end to 
give a hint of Alan's process. He can explain it better.

from ISTANBUL NOIR

I.

Friday, May 29, 2009, 4:30 A.M.

Awake, jet-lagged, I am sitting in my friend Mel Kenne.s apartment room on 
Horoz (Rooster) Street near Yksekkaldirim (Street of Steep Steps). It is 
pitch dark outside. Suddenly I hear the booming sound of the azan prayer. 
Soon, the sound, as if echoes, begins to be repeated from other mosques. 
My friend Mel seems oblivious and keeps on sleeping in the next room. I am 
wondering if this startling choral outburst out of the pitch dark, 
repeated every pre-dawn morning, happens in any other metropolis in the 
world, Islamic or not. I know that the azan calls happened in the 
nineteen-fifties when I lived in Istanbul as a teenager; but were they as 
loud as they seem to be now or, as an inhabitant, and part of the rhythms 
of the city, as Mel in his bed is now, I was oblivious or impervious 
-unless a devout Moslem- to the startling sublimeness of this sound?

Friday, May 29, 2009, 12:10 A.M.

I am walking past the foot of the Galata Tower to go to Mel.s house. 
Sealed at the time, the tower was a forbidden, untouchable place of my 
childhood. Tonight, its conical top is lit with lights, a sign of its 
having become an important tourist spot. I see multiple sea gulls crossing 
and recrossing the circular halo the lights create as they disappear into 
and reappear from the dark. Not only a bird paradise -for the first time 
perhaps in my guts- I realize that Istanbul lies on the multiple migration 
paths of birds. More than the place where East meets West or Byzantium 
fuses with Islam, both of which certainly true, Istanbul is a central 
location, a point of passage, in a natural movement that has been going on 
for millions of years, of which The Silk Road is the nearest human 
reflection. Istanbul has been destroyed and rebuilt, more precisely, 
re-imagined, innumerable times, creating its history of rich melancholy; 
but underlying these changes lies a deep, inescapable continuum, 
experienced just below consciousness. This dialectic between chaos and 
healing unity is at the heart of the city I was born and grew up in and 
which has etched my consciousness and soul ever since. The struggle 
between change -experienced as destruction of memory and, in many ways, 
holy places- and ghosts reclaiming their reality and visibility is my 
experience of Istanbul as personal biography.

Traffic Patterns

I was born and grew up in Mselles (Triangle) Apartment with blue China 
tiles on its front, on the avenue once called Tozkoparan (The Blower of 
Dust). This thoroughfare of about one third of a mile, officially known as 
the Avenue of Refik Saydam -a mysterious gentleman- joins two better know 
spots, at one extremity, Sisane, today a busy roundabout which, at one 
time, was the intersection where the streetcar from Taksim took a sharp 
left to delve into the descending, deep canyon of Bankalar Caddesi (The 
Avenue of Banks) to proceed to Karakoy, cross the Galata Bridge, to 
Eminon, on to the old Istanbul. At the other extremity, where the now 
defunct nightclub Novotni used to be, Tozkoparan may take a short and 
sharp turn right up to Tepebasi (The Top of the Hill) or proceed onward to 
Tarlabasi, at my time the back entry to Istanbul.s main red light street, 
Abanoz (Ebony) Street, in Beyoglu.

Saz playing up on Soundcloud

https://soundcloud.com/tags/alternative%20saz

https://soundcloud.com/search?q=asondheim

Two pieces: sazae1 is acoustic saz with close miking
to pick up the sound/labor of fingers moving, tapping, 
etc. I used the miking to create finger taps, etc. as
part of the improvisation. sazae2 is electric saz with
the mic close to the solid-body instrument; it picked
up the saz from the amplifier, and my tapping, etc. 
from the body of the instrument. Again, a kid of
deliberate raggedness, working the instrument in a new
way for me. At this point I seem to have the only
"alternative saz" pieces on Soundcloud, which I'm also
testing for an improv music class at Underacademy
College, http://underacademycollege.wordpress.com/ .

falls victim to warfare and ecstasy and national heritage, and
folding and entropic and this bored language and this sequence
concerned with probing and defining the fibres of roots, and
cultural heritage among the tribe of tribes, and intellectual
heritage, and strangers, other than people, than other people,
and be it known, inescapable, thinking this is it, that this is
given to the human, and that my heritage is wood and silk and
goodbye, it may be known,

and the end, these are the heritage of humanity, and that 
humanity is the heritage of silk and wood, being silk and wood,

new long-necked saz piece

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/scalz.mp3

working slowly through different scales, at the
same time, well it might as well be in the middle
of the night, it seems all the time, the saz is a
meditation, one moves majestically among the 
plateaus of the instruments, its fields and 
vectors, its moment where virtue falls by the 
wayside, replace by nothing, its catering to the
horseman riding through a forest, the path is
at the edge of a ravine, there are grasses and
gnarled trees, the hot sun but the brook below,
the blue sky but the dust beneath




[Rough maquette for upcoming Clark Coolidge reading,
myself reading/sound, this coming Tuesday]

[interspersions with cura saz, oud re: below]
[noisy dys/functionals]




it's too strong


it's right here


it's right in the middle of us


it twists and turns


there's no end to it


in a conversation with Ken Wark 
I invented the word codework
we were discussing the bones of the text
modified by a computer so that the bones
were the program within the language and
both were speaking


it churns


she said when I die because I'm afraid of death
and weep and wail about it
that she'd take care of it


night having the horrors of death and
disfiguration


codework destroys the language given to us with
the uneasy birthright of Cain,
 
the mark on Cain is the terminal prompt \

decoding the journeys of the Wandering Jew, an
.stl file that prints out the world's body


it looms


it's born on a loom and dies on a loom, as it grows,
it weaves itself


it weaves itself into a loom and grows itself


it grows turning and it says to itself
i turn left
i turn right


chiasm it crosses itself 
it grows churning and it says to itself

center right center center left
center left center center right


it swallows time it's the family favorite
i kill my father and mother i kill my sister and
brother i kill my son and daughter
i'm the family favorite, i'm the family favorite


it melds
it erases its Origin
it erases the INTERSECTION OF THE 
 ABCISSA AND ORDINATE

it's somewhere


it's really something


it's somewhere


it's somewhere DIIRTY


I think of the dance as a whirl without consent, like the body burning, or
 like a singer without a song, totally open to the world, no computer,
    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this

 it wobbles on pivots, it gyres on axes, it twists
and turns, 
 it turns away the face, the face of the world is the dance 


the world of the face is the trance


I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be
		  quite dangerous wobble turn around


I think you leave holding hands 


my heart
bursts open

my heart
bursts open, and blood everywhere, this burst heart! And then I no longer
	   think, my whirling body-heart, body-burst-heart!

    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this
 burst-heart-body, world roiling and heaving system fast rotation and
				wobble

I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be
		  quite dangerous wobble turn around


      pulling forth the cane from the body can only be imagined

		   the body is the dream of freedom
		  the dance is the dream of freedom
		      dream of freedom, the cane



i remember she didn't have to die 
for once the doctors were right
death claims those who ignore


who sway to the right move to the left
who move to the left sway to the right

who sway to the left move to the right
who move to the right sway to the left


I'll see your eyes. I'll see your face. Language is an enemy. Language
is the enemy. 

Get out. Get out of here. I'll see your face. I'll see your eyes.


I get into the ocean. I get out of the sea.

I get out of the sea. I get into the ocean.


poetry is an emergency

poetry is always an emergency



a steep hill with wooden steps near the top 
 an abandoned apartment
second floor a picture i know there 
 forget now
someone i know lived around the apartment
in Providence it was a guitar maker from back then


plane crash in the north back yard
splits open filled with medicine bottles

a bad one


in a house with saxophone players but we're talking
they leave it's dark out dangerous i'm alone
need to get out of there find somewhere

not home but somewhere i'm staying or something


just five minutes after i'm dead 
what will she see



the engine which draws forth desire

the engine which vanquishes the same

desire drawn forth and vanquished, and who may
carry the wand, and of what bone or stem, of
what skin or leaf

wind speaks, put that plant and animal down

Worked with Geoff Dugan today, playing a number of
instruments for experimental production of ambient
and instrumental sonorities. Three of the pieces 
we did present pump organ works recorded inside our
1878 Beatty instrument; these will be combined with
Geoff's recording and we'll see what emerges. In 
the meantime, enjoy the pump organ; I'm happy to 
say that the bellows are still intact and relatively
tight, and everything still works. The low notes are
particularly interesting, I think; they sound like
64' pipes, but I'm not sure, how could I be?

more and more we move towards the recognition
of something that carries ourselves into this
others world only to have them collapses onto
itself towards the end of extinctions of your
lives and form and so these amount to numbers
and codes and among them circulations of such
account as you might tally of animals and too
of plants and too of flora and too of fauna i
knew and harbored more and more the soft skin
and more and more the hard bones of all these
you remember and might have sadly named there
and now the deaths arising and moving here in
these vast unlabeled regions


alone in the woods i don't care what you say
i wish i was a yankee in the boulders
the old man of the mountain crashed after the coin
i'll sit and think here it's the only place
my free body cragged in fissured time
i didn't know they could think that smart
geology is a rock in a rock
a rock on a rock is a stratum
nothing glows like inner glows in a stream
it's dark and shadowy streaming in these nice woods
the ground remembers a history of warmth
ground follows ground until something stops it
down below above is more of the same behind its back
black smokers harbor life i'd like to be
still me a different thing is alone in the forest
i wish i was a yankee there i wish i was a stone
