cull, culling cull (oud, strategy of poetics/poetry-poet)

editing or culling into the texts i wrote - and i've been meaning to write 
this for a long time, culling the words, that they represent, as processes 
or cullings of unbounded universes, dojoji has disappeared, culling dead 
texts, the results of culling 'deconstruction' from the internet text: 
this text is culled from an outline of current work prepared for my 
_renitency,_ caught culling their dreams, drawn down their drowning, 
culled from other things, blocks are taken out - sequences culling, (from 
past sins) culling nothing, i remained shaken but alive, culling online 
offline until real or virtual disappearance, culling shadow as well as 
that of others or textus vitual virtualis editing or culling into the 
texts i wrote - first assembled into files, hands, my hands, my book, 
culled from these texts, and i'm tired of this. it doesn't make any sense, 
culling from the lost, everything and nothing escaping wryting without 
conclusion, culling meaning, culling in the fields of desire, culling 
'existentialism' from the internet text, a phenomenology of analog and 
digital, culled from poetics if not poetry itself, in-formed by _culling,_ 
Ah! ripples in forgotten corners of the universe - culled work emerging, 
texts culled from my everything; my commanding, perhaps grep -h cull

Ecstasy


 In this form of nervous derangement the patient is not wholly lost to 
external impressions, but rapt and absorbed in some object of the 
imagination. The muscles are sometimes relaxed, sometimes rigid, as in 
slight tetanus: but the loss of voluntary power over them is not complete 
or universal, for he sometimes speaks in a very earnest manner, or sings. 
The patient is, as it were, out of the body at times, engrossed in some 
high object of contemplation. This is the state in which nervous subjects 
- more commonly females - are sometimes thrown when under the influence of 
animal magnetism; and, as a medical teacher of celebrity remarks, "grave 
authors assure us that the intelligence which then deserts the brain, 
concentrates itself in the epigastrium, or at the tips of the fingers; 
that people in that state read letters which are placed upon their stomach 
or applied to the soles of their feet; answer oracularly enigmatical 
questions, describe exactly their own internal organic diseases, and even 
foretell future events." I take it that all who are able to take on what 
is called the "clairvoyant state," are in the ecstatic state when in that 
condition; and I am well persuaded that it is a morbid one which had in 
all cases better be avoided. I have long noticed that the more mesmeric 
subjects are operated upon, the more nervous and feeble they become.

 Treatment. - So much has the imagination to do in causing this state, it 
can usually be avoided if the patient wishes to do so. As a preventive 
measure, the nerves should be strengthened in all possible ways, and all 
forms of nervous excitement should be avoided.

(From the chapter, Diseases of the Nervous System, in The Hydropathic 
Family Physician, A Ready Prescriber and Hygienic Adviser with reference 
to the Nature, Causes, Prevention, and Treatment of Diseases, Accidents, 
and Casualties of Every Kind, by Joel Shew, M.D., New York, Fowlers and 
Wells, Publishers, 1854.)

social philosophy

==========================================================================

[16:49] There is no suitable surface to sit on, try another spot.
[2010/03/04 18:11] Flight Band: All Go
[2010/03/04 18:23] No room to sit here, try another spot.
[2010/03/06 09:00] Flight Band: All Go
[2010/03/08 22:26] sensor: noone around.
[2010/03/12 09:35] Alan Dojoji: 
Nikuko: Now we're going to discuss social philosophy.
Julu: The social philosophy of being online, the social philosophy of
being offline.
Nikuko: Social philosophy is always virtual.
Julu: Every word you say is virtual; words are not for eating.
[2010/03/12 09:36] Alan Dojoji: or of such in this new realm. or something 
in this new realm
[2010/03/12 09:36] Alan Dojoji: but it is this matter of inertia, never 
overlooking the usual concerns of primates and environments and then
[2010/03/12 09:36] Alan Dojoji: on the other hand, the situation of 
fragility as everything falls apart to be sure
[16:52] Alan Dojoji: Its difficult to describe this, yes? But the 
FUNDAMENTAL issue remains inertia, the ground-state of primate ecology, 
what works, what constitutes the preconscious habitus.
[16:52] Alan Dojoji: Every utopian vision ignores this; every manifesto 
assumes that behavior is modifiable on a scale well beyond that of taste 
or fashion.
[16:53] Alan Dojoji: I'd think otherwise, towards being constituted by 
what - UNconsciously is ascribed to essence.
[16:55] Alan Dojoji: Fragility comes into play only when deep-structure is 
obliterated by hegemonic forgetfulness, hegemony constituted by economic 
power, but also the power of media porosity, subjectivity bound to radio, 
packages of modernization, tv, net, and so forth.
[16:55] Alan Dojoji: In any order.
[16:56] Alan Dojoji: These lights in Second Life are blinding me...
[16:58] Alan Dojoji: If you think of the Thing in relation to depression, 
you might agree that the Thing is also inextricably entangled in the 
psychoanalytical-social. You might think that fragility is the result of 
an inability to bypass the thing, which inverts, transforms into the 
catatonic, simultaneously abjures and embraces substance. 0: or f(0) as an 
absorber
[16:59] Alan Dojoji: 1 or f(1) as embracer, but f(x) - perhaps an 
irrational - refusing position:
[16:59] Alan Dojoji: or position only by virtue of the CUT.
[17:01] Alan Dojoji: For the most part humans want to continue what 
they've always done, what amounts to what works or might have worked at a 
particular point in time. Or say (inexact) space-time region. What becomes 
custom, what inscribes: what inscribes is fixture, fetish, fixation.
[17:01] Alan Dojoji: What inscribes is the HARMONIC.
[17:02] Alan Dojoji: That is to say regulatory NODE.
[17:05] Alan Dojoji: One might think of the proper mode of BIRTHING or 
proper mode of DEATHING in this regard.
[17:06] Alan Dojoji: I am thinking of: in particular: issues of creation 
and cessation, but more importantly, issues of SPEW and SLAUGHTER.
[17:07] Alan Dojoji: For these abjure the HARMONIC.
[17:10] Alan Dojoji: They are THING. They transform organism into THING.
[17:10] Alan Dojoji: THING has no HISTORY.
[17:10] Alan Dojoji: They abjure HISTORY as well.
[17:12] Alan Dojoji: However, simultaneously they exist on the plane of 
inertia, through the process of compartmentalization. Slaughter occurs, 
but is set-aside as slaughter: but is set-aside. Productive spew fills 
interstices, transforms substance into substance, but is set-aside.
[17:12] Alan Dojoji: One carries the FRAGILITY of the self into slaughter.
[17:13] Alan Dojoji: One swallows the FRAGILITY of the self in the 
excretion of spews.
[17:13] Alan Dojoji: Let it be said: We are all diseased.
[17:14] Alan Dojoji: Our inertia is that of culture production radically 
disconnected, signified and commodified; body inscription becomes the 
inscriptive body.
[17:15] Alan Dojoji: Use-value is inertial; exchange-value, fragile. Which 
is more deeply embedded in time?
[17:16] Alan Dojoji: To be sure, the inertial, which conserves time, 
hoards time, exists outside of time.
[17:16] Alan Dojoji: One overturns fragility with RAGE.
[17:17] Alan Dojoji: RAGE decomposes, INERTIA composes; one overturns 
inertia with the decomposition of fragility.
[17:18] Alan Dojoji: What is fragile rarely produces GOOD THINGS; the rest 
is CATASTROPHE, catastrophe theory.
[17:18] Alan Dojoji: The CATASTROPHIC is the unspoken of INSCRIPTION.
[17:19] Alan Dojoji: There are no silent partners.
[17:20] Flight Band: All Go
[17:21] Alan Dojoji: I will escape thee.
[17:23] Alan Dojoji: I will break the skin of INSCRIPTIVE PREDESTINATION
[17:23] Alan Dojoji: I will find the INCOHERENT in the INERTIAL
[17:23] Alan Dojoji: All of this I will transform and more.
[17:24] Alan Dojoji: Your THING is my REGARD.
[17:25] Nikuko: Your REGARD is my THING.
[17:25] Julu: My THING exactly.

demonstrating my SL installation to a friend


here's the problem: there's no place to stand; you might fall any time; 
you might lose me if I fall; you need a flight bracelet to stay up and 
hold on; it's difficult to move around; the small area is relatively 
complex; it's hard to know where to sit; too many particle might flow when 
you sit; you might not be able to see beyond the particles; your computer 
might slow up too much; your interface might grind to a halt; the SL 
servers might slow up; your computer might freeze; the SL servers might 
overload; you might lose track of your avatar; you might not turn the 
video on; you might turn the video on and overload your computer; you 
might not have the particles set to maximum in preferences; you might not 
have turned media on; you might stand up and fall; you might not 
understand what's on the screen; you might need a flight feather; you 
might forget where you are; you might not have been able to reach the 
place; you might not know where the place is; you might forget to landmark 
the place; you might forget my avatar names; you might not be my friend; 
you might not be teleported; I might not be online; your camera lens might 
be poorly set; you might be confused from the avatar viewpoint; you might 
not know the boundaries of my space; you might think other objects in the 
vicinity are part of my work; you might not see the dance of your sitting 
avatar; you might not realize the dance is a motion-capture dance; you 
might not understand the motion-capture software; you might not know 
you're dancing one of five dances; you might not know the dances are 
chosen randomly; you might not have shaders on; you might not have the 
landscape set high; you might not have sufficient weather; you might not 
have water or atmospheric shaders; you might not have the sound on high; 
you might not have the sound turned on; you might lose patience with the 
installation; you might not know what to do; you might not know why you're

4 hopeful pieces with descriptions

http://www.alansondheim.org/city.mp3
I've been thinking about the infinity of cities, the depth of soundscapes 
and the romantic plenitude of nature. This is out the window of our loft; 
every sound in the city contributes, every cough or whistle miles away, 
every tire on asphalt. It always amazes me: this is the murmuring of a 
technological world coming to an end, perhaps, within a century. There are 
sub-bass harmonies here as well - harmonies which dominate the aural 
landscape, but which are inaudible to human ears. Even in this recording, 
one senses them. I've just finished Lamartine's uncanny Raphael, a book in 
which the natural world of meadows and streams runs through emotional 
states, tending towards both exaltation and cessation. I can imagine Julie 
at walk among the Brooklyn forests of streets, still listening, but with a 
greater hunger. HOPEFUL: The depth of the city revealed as a new cosmos 
with everyone present, all the time.

http://www.alansondheim.org/melodeon.mp3
Recently acquired this 1847 melodeon thanks to book trading. The bellows 
are bad; the vacuum box won't hold a vacuum; three valves are broken; the 
vacuum box needs to be opened; several reeds won't sound. So it's in great 
need of repair. In the meantime, furious pumping and a lot of reverb makes 
this odd sound file; you can hear the bellows working. It's actually quite 
a beautiful instrument, and will sound great once it's restored. HOPEFUL: 
A melodeon sounding like it did in 1847, when it was in someone's parlor.

http://www.alansondheim.org/hybrid1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/hybrid2.mp3
Playing around with the rishi on the oud, alternating with finger-picking. 
It's difficult to keep the rishi (pick) available if I'm using everything 
else on the strings. So it's rishi in the mouth, rishi on the floor, rishi 
on the knee, rishi held sometimes with two fingers, with a curled finger, 
with a thumb and finger, rishi sometimes dropped. On the other hand the 
sonority of the two interacting playing modes really interests me. 
HOPEFUL: Smooth transitions in-tune make for wonderful textures, melodies, 
and harmonies.

HOPEFUL: The CITY SYMPHONY will make me rich; the MELODEON will bring 
untold pleasure to millions; the HYBRID OUD PLAYING will set new standards 
in improvisation world-wide.

I sit down to read Rachel, Her Stage Life and Her Real Life, by Francis 
Gribble, 1911 - 90 years after Rachel's birth, fifty-three years after her 
death.

I stop. I can't go on. I don't know why I'm reading this. I feel in my 
bones - incessantly - that I'm close to death. I felt this decades before 
my father turned 95 last year and will feel it until the end.

So why read about Rachel; what good is this knowledge, which will have no 
chance to grow, which will disappear into the wind when I cease to exist? 
Or what better thing is there to do at this point, beyond entertainment?

Perhaps I will carry Rachel to the grave, this early Jewish actress who, 
unknown to her, is seen has a precursor to Sarah Bernhardt. She too was 
haunted by death, called herself, constantly according to Gribble, La 
Pauvre Rachel. 

She was determined to accomplish and was in a position to accomplish. Her 
lovers included an emperor. She was the greatest interpreter of Phedre. I 
would say of course until Bernhardt, not even on the horizon of Rachel.

Our horizons are not our own.

It is on the horizon that the Other is, accompanied by the Thing, unknown 
rubbed raw against unknown, and that is all I know of it.

But I know what I know about Rachel, another heroine of mine, that I will 
not carry her to the grave; I will not carry anything. I am the richer for 
reading her biography - her voice, of course unlike Bernhardt's, was never 
recorded - but this is an illusion; memory and knowledge, unlike wealth, 
are never recirculated, but die completely. 

No one can ever comprehend the world of another. (Memes notwithstanding.) 
And knowledge is never knowledge, but a moment in habitus (which we never 
understand), or illusory, virtual (which we understand, but disagree).

I agree with the Other of Rachel which is my Other, and with the Thing 
which led her constantly to tears. But I wonder: Shall I learn something 
here, or elsewhere; understanding the Dirac equation does not unfold the 
universe, and attempting Rachel does not unfold Phedre.

Phedre and the universe and every noun are one. But it is impossible to 
see the universe in a grain of sand and impossible to see worlds within 
worlds; these are fundamental illusions that allow some of us to approach 
death with equanimity.

I continue to read Rachel, Her Stage Life and Her Real Life, finding 
myself approaching senselessness without wall or barrier in the depth of 
the abyss.



ridge

the ridge or edge of the division between avatar and habitus, blurred, 
jagged, just like the rest of them, of those. it was just a matter of 
misrecognition, feynman diagrams as of the lower vertex numbers didn't 
hold. what then but circumambulations which together hinted at the thing; 
the circumambulations _were_ the thing under erasure, evanescent.

give you the artifacts. you'll be amazed.

Michael, who I never knew


Michael Benedikt and George E. Wellwarth edited Modern French Theatre: The 
Avant-Garde, Dada, and Surrealism. I recently bought a used copy of the 
book, first edition. It might have been Benedikt's first book. There's an 
author's signature on the title page, and an inscription inside the front 
cover: 


for Mother dear

     and F.F.

with thanks for the right genes,

             Michael


Michael Benedikt was born in 1935 and died in 2007. I didn't know him. 
There is something uncanny about the inscription. Michael Benedikt lived 
72 years. I think perhaps he gave this to his mother with a sense of 
pride; he was 29. I think to myself: He gave this book to his mother and 
F.F., perhaps a father. His mother and perhaps F.F. died, and Michael 
inherited. It would have been sad for the book to be returned to him, 
after a temporary journey of pride and happiness. And then Michael died 
and someone, perhaps a wife or other relative, sold or gave away some of 
his books, perhaps all of them, and this was one of them. And so Modern 
French Theater ends up in Adam Tobin's book-store, coming from somewhere, 
somewhere unknown, perhaps untraceable, and I am reading and learning a 
great deal, revisiting some old friends, playwrights within. I fear death, 
death dominates me; I am constantly fighting off depression as best I can. 
As we run out of money, depression and stress increase. And I think: soon 
this book will be passed on, and I am less than a silent witness to its 
passing. So perhaps this is the singing of a solitary and mournful note, 
so that its passing will be remembered. And perhaps this will be forgotten 
as well.

The Edenic

The idea of the Edenic - an unsullied paradise; hegemonic then becomes 
sullying, but also encapsulating. The Edenic becomes a dominated 
sub-culture by virtue of the lie; it resists, imitates, and adapts.

The Edenic trope is one of childhood, naivete, goodness, lack of conflict, 
even lack of culture. The individual is "at one" with nature; nature and 
culture are one. The culture is self-sustaining and inert; nothing 
changes. Even sexual display and conflict is non-existent. At the back of 
this at times there is also the idea of unbridled sexuality.

The trope is also one of destruction; the Edenic has no concept of owner- 
ship or stewardship; THEREFORE the land is there for the taking. The 
Edenic has no sense of monotheism; THEREFORE the humans are close to 
animals, sub-humans. 

The Edenic has no recognizable boundary, THEREFORE no rationale, no 
rationalism; it cannot be negotiated with, but property must be seized, 
and by seizure, created.

This is the disorganization of the Edenic, its messiness, irrationality:
this is the boundary-less, boundless feminine crying out for the phallic 
order. Whose feminine? Whose crying? Whose phallus? Whose order? What's 
the phallus ordering around? What's around here? What's around?

The Edenic is tragic, mournful, noble; the Edenic is dirty, messy, lazy; 
the Edenic must be controlled; the Edenic must be annihilated; the Edenic 
will survive as trope within the hegemonic; the Edenic becomes the 
bypassing of Paradise; the Edenic becomes the exotic; the Edenic becomes 
the site of tourism; of tourism without contestation; of contestation. The 
Edenic is always in retreat; if the hegemonic is defined by "not both here 
and there," the Edenic is "neither here nor there." Both operations make a 
calculus; only one is named. The naming of the Edenic is the erasure of 
the name: of the Edenic, of the name.

The lie appears because the Edenic is under erasure just as soon as it's 
formulated. By erasure: it's divested of power, because it's asserted 
never to have power, never to have legitimacy. Religion entangles here; by 
virtue of inerrancy, religion legitimates, inscribes. Where religion 
inscribes, the Edenic is absented: barring from the Garden of Edenic 
implies the inscription of walls, the inerrancy of procedural judgments 
and the power to carry them out. Absenting makes the art grow fonder for 
uncanny loss, last vestige of the imaginary. Absenting fills the absent 
with bureaucracy, misrecognition, capital, and the distribution of power: 
this is where the lie lies.

The Edenic was never born; the Edenic dies in violence: forget picture, 
memory, representation; forget tomb, paean, epitaph. It's not there, it's 
not allowed to make (a, any, the) differance.



Porter2


Not that you listened to porter.mp3, but it did split a nail, messing up 
my play. I taped on a saz pick, alternating finger styles. Anyway this is 
a pretty cool piece, makes me want to drive across the country again. 
I'd slam into every right-wing militia in sight. I wouldn't care if it 
made sense. Then I thought maybe I should use exclamation marks here but 
decided against it. The oud's unsweetened, just as it came through the 
amp. I wasn't going to do another porter piece but I thought, well this is 
a followup to the first since I messed up my play and Desiree made it all 
better:

http://www.alansondheim.org/porter2.mp3

Desiree was punctual to a minute. The porter, the garcons, the porterai 
avec pour toujours! offices, too, were to be performed by the wife of the 
porter, according to little Nathalie, the porter's daughter, remaining 
with her grandmother The sou was given, and the porter's daughter 
disappeared, leaving the porter's daughter, and she went forth to dispose 
of this: "The night Madame de la R******* died, the wife of the porter, 
she had sex with minors, who said?" And all the reporters were looking at 
her poverty, soon divulged to the porteress: To porterage, -- 00.00 1/4: 
To porterage, -- 00.00 1/4: - after he signed the cheque that was to pay 
the importer. I overheard he's played recently, this reporter can only 
surmise. "The eternal gates' terrific porter lifted the northern Bar- 
Imperial - supporter of the empire. For she was The Supporter of All or 
One Who Remains Alive even after Everything, and he is like one who tries 
to reform that matter, those false porters and trekking guides carrying 
out at one sweep the whole arsenal of the old law.

brake, dance

http://www.alansondheim.org/break.mp3

in the morning, bark fled the surfaces of trees, only to return,
tired and worn-out, somewhere in the night.
the brook left its banks with the fleeing of the bark, the bark 
never knew, when it returned, that the brook had been a-swimming.
one day dawn broke early, all might have been revealed, but kindly
night kept sky and earth in darkness.
herons and bitterns in brakes decried the awkward giving, still
concealed from almost all creation.
it was as if day-break had broken, as if night had its sleepy way.
bark, bred on the morrow, gathered together at evening's sleepy way.
brad and allison wandered all around, smiling at the world's new 
green and blue horizon.
all creation in harmony, no one boasting, bragging, no one being,
no beings one, no one being one.
birds flew together and apart above the swimming trees trees.
o ark of gift-tomorrows, no irk among the brake.

among the brake and swimming trees, dank animals at rest.
by dint of softened nest, amoeba moved, thoughtful and silent.
they swam, sunk, and rose again, thirsting boundaries of water 
and air.
their transforming bodies lightly dented surfaces of new-born
thought.
thinking among dung and graceful food, gasping world, creating
murmured world.
dunes there were, low hills and sundry wisps of cloud.
done was the world, unbegun the world, silent all animals and
quiet plants.
the din of the quiet, brad and allison would have thought,
there were no brad and allison.
all moment, movement, were of, and of not, dance.



David Askevold, Alan Sondheim, Two Harmonicas, One Class


Recently, going through my archives, I've found cassette tapes made with a
number of people from the 70s, including Chris Franz / Tina Weymouth,
David Askevold, and Laurie Anderson. I'm trying to copy them now. I've put
the David Askevold tape up:

http://www.alansondheim.org/askevoldharpclass.mp3

This was made in one of the Projects classes at Nova Scotia College of Art
and Design; I forget whether we were team-teaching, or it was his or my
class. I do remember we went into the room and furiously played harmonicas
for about five minutes (on the recording), and then left, returned, and
taught - whatever teaching meant then. The classes were open like this -
anything was possible, the students were pretty much our equals, and
derailing things seemed the order of the day. I'd do this now at SVA if I
didn't think I'd get fired! Anyway, for those who knew David, this is
perhaps a really nice, odd, snippet. I'm going to get a better copy, but I
wanted to put this up now. (Hi Ian!)

(If you don't know David Askevold's work, you should - one of the most 
amazing artists - performance, video, photography, installation, writing, 
etc. - I've ever met - and the best 'art teach' I've ever met as well.)

Description:

http:::::

the unique https of my work since I've been online. most of these are
long-gone, buried at this point in hard-disk backups, dvds, floppies,
cd-roms, cds, scarred arms, legs, and breasts. but some are still there.

what you have is a rag-tag index of my media history. this is how I think
now. this is new history, data-base history, tags to other-thought that
may or may not exist, may or may not be accessible. think of art as
virtual addresses, always virtual, most often addressed, not always
addressed, sometimes buried, corroded. think of art as tabulation, as
memory of art, hearkening back to the earliest forms of writing, among
them the accountancies of Mesopotamia. what is being counted here? when
did all this happen? and does it still survive? and do I?

platos cave


recording 8 minute oud solo with eyes closed. i suppose this is easy for 
bowed-string players in general; most plucked-string players i know watch 
- at least on occasion - what they're doing. certainly it helps intona- 
tion, especially when leaps are involved. of course there are many blind 
musicians who move effortlessly on their instruments. (without glasses, my 
eyesight is miserable; i can't read the big E on the chart; sometimes i 
don't even see the chart.) but i watch what i do. then i noticed, playing 
oud, i had to develop some sort of muscle memory - watching doesn't quite 
work when the fingerboard is featureless. i can judge the neighborhood, 
but not the house. so i find i can play with my eyes closed, which brings 
up, plato's cave: for the cave itself is an acoustic instrument, one that 
responds to aural registers, one whose depth is revealed by echo and 
resonance, by the playing-out of harmonics, by what goes on in the 
interior of someone's mind, someone listening, or someone playing, for 
examples, in a closed space, perhaps the space of an infinite ocarina, 
perhaps a universal sonic map. and here is the space of visual darkness, 
the space of sound projecting, messing up ideal forms with taylor series 
stretched to the limit, with a hollowness that neither knows its name nor 
note. so one, i muse, might in such a space play a world, one might world 
a world. so i made sure to inhabit the forms, the pulse and flow of music, 
if such be music, i made through being there, present, playing, within 
such an infinitude illuminated by sound.

Writing and the Absent Center


The following piece is written using an interesting technique. Several key 
words are chosen - for example, 'fraud.' Vowels are eliminated - 'frd.' 
The resulting consonant chain is entered into a 1980s Franklin spell- 
checker. The spell-checker returns a list of possible words. The words are 
used, in list-order, as catalysts for lines, one word per line. Any  
number of key words can be used for a text. In the following, a key word 
provided the catalysts for the first section; each subsequent section used 
a key word chosen to augment the meaning of the piece.

The key words themselves most likely do not appear in the text, which 
circulates around one or more absent centers. The writing is always under 
erasure by an uncanny other that almost never appears itself. (Even if it 
does appear, it becomes only one of a number of list words.) This is of 
course a model of writings inherent alterity, used as a means of thinking 
through a text. And of course such a model hints at the possibility of an 
infinite regress, alterity's other, and so forth - on one hand a useless 
construct, on an other, a potential truth as revealed in the following.


the sexy body was found near the volcano's searing lip
skis and poles were fixed to silent genitals
a stale odor permeated lava, air and skin and sky
it was as if styli had inscribed an unknown language on the skin
lulu stalled, stared at the incised foreign markings
the writing was on a miniscule scale, nothing made sense at all
volcanic fumes, sulphuric, resulted in scaly, crackling skin
something was still missing from the horrifying image of the real
lulu moved the body upright, creating a stele effect
things were easier to read, but sex is never easy to comprehend
the son, sol, looked down through fumes, no answer was forthcoming

the inscription was formed from oddly styled tiny dots
lulu walked around the upright body trembling, in a daze
for the nth time she lightly touched the taut and written skin

her tongue ran over its nipples, she sensed an incandescent drug
the body seemed to dissolve into dusts and dregs of sky and earth
lulu dragged herself along the ground, her clothes torn off
travis, blistered, naked, from the heat, sang an uncanny dirge
the dirge was dark, the color of incisions on the upright body
soon, darts flew through the air, and the body glowed in answer
a dirk cut and set it free, its skin sloughed to the ground
it sank into the volcanic matrix, nude, never to emerge again
lulu drew an image in the dust, trying to remember everything that was
i draw better than write, she said, pressing her body into the hollow
her skin sloughed and scaled, as travis watched in horror
furiously, he dug deep next to her, on the lip of the bleak volcano
he scratched the earth like dogs against lulu's mewling cats
he dug deeper, until they both fell into the smoking hole

all that was left was a sack of emptied clothes
lulu and travis disappeared, sick of their burned skin, smoke and fire
their last gesture, sucking on each other's bodies' desperate organs

this was the beginning of wandering through lack in word and world
key and lock were identical, there was no escape
there was no luck in the world, and less in every oath and word
even now one thinks of the lick of lulu-travis
even now one scents the leak of body burrowed into body
the volcano lip turned in, to airless lid across the skin of everything

the world turned wilder, dangerous, beneath the festered lip
all bodies are weld together, all tongues and holes are joined
all words are wads of skin pressed tight into the mind
senseless mind and body wed together in constant mourning
red blood reminds of reddened lip and words
nothing rids the world of language, code, inscription
nothing connects, not even rods and lines in skin and bone
the world seems sacred writ as we attempt a true and real reading
the real wilts away as reading disappears
characters are welts upon (our) travis-lulu's skin
the characters are always rude, the language rude as well
lips and words inhabit worlds, forever burning us, in constant acts
 of dying



Among! Talk?


Julu: Hi, Jennifer, you have a speck on your skirt!
Jennifer: Julu, stop making stupid speech again!
Julu: I was just trying to remove your spot!
Jennifer: This whole conversation seems sped up!
Julu: Jennifer, I hope we're not having a spat!
Jennifer: Julu, maybe there's spit on your skirt!
Julu: It's just a spud I think, whatever that is!
Jennifer: In September, really, a spud?
Julu: Oh Jennifer, I think God just spoke to me!
Jennifer: Oh Julu, I hope we never have to split!
Julu: This conversation's got too much speed!
Jennifer: Yeah, let's leave, I think it sucks!

Jennifer: To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?
Julu: Is this something I need tell you again?
Jennifer: Do suns drown moons in downland tills?
Julu: Do moons take toll of drowning suns?
Jennifer: Do poems tie me to yous and yous?
Julu: Do poems toe line with yous and mes?
Jennifer: What, questions too, and not enough love?
Julu: Perhaps an undertow sweeps us together?
Jennifer: Is that an elk gamboling in our midst?
Julu: Perhaps not an elk but someone of that ilk?
Jennifer: Is this wondrous talk or what of us?

Jennifer: Don't be sly! They're with us! Still!
Julu: So what! That one's sleeping! Wake him!
Jennifer: Say what! So that one's waking! What now!
Julu: Soy's delicious! A substitute for ham!
Jennifer: Soya's made from ham and not so good!
Julu: Sew buttons on soy! They'll wake her now!
Jennifer: Sol shines on bean! Both of them sleep!
Julu: Sow beans, they'll wake! And eat them!
Jennifer: I'll die! They'll sue me! Eat them!
Julu: She'll sue me! He'll sue me! Make them sleep!
Jennifer: Ay, there's the rub of soy! Still so sly!
Julu: By now, we're outlaws! Quick! On our way!
Jennifer: Kentucky, yay! And Tennessee!
Julu: My lord! Look at the states we're in! 
Jennifer: Here comes New York! South Carolina!
Julu: South Dakota! I don't believe it!
Jennifer: Head south-east! Something's there!
Julu: Endless! Boring! We're in San Francisco!
Jennifer: Don't be shy! They're waking! We've arrived!
Julu: The sky is blue! They'll look! See everything!
Jennifer: Spy on us! The specks on our pretty skirts!
Julu: Spuds! We're not in a sty! Poems are dirty!
Jennifer: Quick! South-west! Get out of here!
Julu: Finally! Wyoming! A great place to live!



two oud experiments observing certain empty centers

http://www.alansondheim.org/config.mp3

mapping possibilities given restraints and expansions
mopping up the results until something is achieved
producing maps doesn't necessarily make for anything
these works mop up loss like sierpinski sieves
think of mats with graphs laid out in two dimensions
play both, cacophony is met by structured dissonance
sometimes it's apt to make harmonic resonance
i'd opt for messy consonance and uncanny messy beauty



puzzle because i so much want your approval

and without access to technology surely i can shop
and without shopping surely i can watch
while the rich get richer my left eye gets bad
boo hoo hoo or maybe better yay yay yay

recordings made using upper or lower shortwave sidebands. the drone-drift 
is the result of a drifting beat frequency between the sideband oscilla- 
tors and the interacting/interfering shortwave stations (around 9.6 mhz).
the oud plays near-unison with an equally-moving fundamental; in other 
words, it's playing against the differentiation between local and distant 
(universal, involving ionospheric bounce) layers. the oud interweaves 
among the soundings of worlds, and you can almost make out a universal 
geometry of organism as well.

decayed, innovative, exhausted, tawdry, repetition, exalted, exploited, 
arousing, stupid, brilliant, unearthly

I need feedback on these - it would be helpful, thanks - Alan -

(two pieces in need of critique)

The following raises questions about musical/sound form and conceivably 
tawdry repetition.

(one piece in need of analysis)

The following raises questions about the psychoanalytics of net sex in 
Second Life and other virtual space; the cartoon-avatar dances and exposes 
herself - what sort of triggers, if any, are set off? Would this be con- 
sidered a form of exploitation by proxy? A source of delight and arousal? 
Certainly any number of elements anywhere can act as catalysts for fantasy 
- in SL, where sex is statistically one of the main activities among 
participants, avatar sex is paramount. Years ago, when I engaged in/wrote 
on net sex, it was clear that ascii diegesis (including real-time lapses, 
lags, erasures, and so forth) could be overwhelming at times. But even 
this crude (in both senses of the term) movie loop seems to construct an 
uncanny body whose 'legibility' results in a psychoanalytical surplus or 
lure.
