

Hypertext: WHEN LINKS SURFACE


Tell me about the LINKS connecting one to another point here, what sort of
knowledge emerges WHEN time is shuffled into instantaneous information? 
Hypertext shuttles the SURFACE of things, their LINKAGES as Jolley pointed
out years ago, WHEN taxonomy appeared promising as an adjunct to structur-
alism. The SURFACE was emphasized continually, things being akin to one
another according to various LINKS or parallels among them. But structure
is different from the processes of learning; semantic, cognitive, and phy-
sical spaces are utterly distinct from one another. If the first is part
and parcel of the LINKS within a sememe, the second emphasizes not the
_where,_ the SURFACE location, but the _WHEN,_ the immersive experience
and its flows; and the third, of course, is _always already_ SURFACE. The
relative disjunctions among these leads me to believe that hypertext in
fact may not provide a reasonable learning experience, but only the exis-
tence of packaged LINKS across SURFACES WHEN the reader and/or student
encounters a particular domain. The LINKS are _not_ the thing; as in film,
they're jumpcuts, suturing the SURFACE within the subject, but not sutur-
ing the subject within the SURFACE - it takes the diegesis and fixed time
to do that. But in general hypertext LINKS are two-way, and the _WHEN_ is
collapsed. The physical-real, of course, in its obdurate SURFACES, is
_never_ linked but always continuous/discontinuous within perception,
dreams and trance-states transforming such SURFACES back into LINKS. Is
hypertext our catastrophe-theory of knowledge, the collapse into pre-de-
termined categoricity? Or does it open deeply beyond the SURFACE, WHEN the
subject herself/himself is confronted by internal discontinuities, LINKS,
shifters, insertions, collusions, dissolutions?  I fear the former, hope
for the latter, LINKING myself to your SURFACE WHEN you come towards me,
out of the splintered dark.

Cybercafe


I'm helping to work out a menu system for a cybercafe. Ideas? Certainly
that there be an aol access point, and a telnet to check mail elsewhere;
that a few muds be include; that the usual Cuseeme stuff be added on, that
there be a frontiers area which would include the new video/audio applica-
tions; that there be a phone area that would include things like Iphone
and Tscape as well; that there be a personals area for Web and other per- 
sonals, and a chat area for romance and just plain contact - this might 
include MIRC as well as Global Chat which is pretty easy to use; that 
there be simple download/printing methods heading straight towards full- 
color printers; that there be an inktomi and yahoo immediate access for 
information; that there be a local NY newspage continually updated with 
additional information; that Usenet be presented with a simple way of 
searching the various groups; that telnet 25 be disabled to prevent sim- 
ple mischief but that other telnet ports be open; that gopher be there - 
preferably the Nysernet and the tc.umn.edu ones (one for local, one for 
global); that email be enabled possibly without return - and any other 
ideas here? because I'm curious what on earth would ever drive anyone to 
a cybercafe if and when she/he had access to a home or university account 
- but then the possibility of community, decent printing, trying out 
Iphone on a registered basis without paying for it; using reasonably ad- 
vanced videoboards, etc. comes to mind.

Any ideas? Not only because I'm engaged in this project, but also because 
I'm interested in figuring out what the deeper points (if any) of cyber- 
cafes are, and how much exactly they can exist as global coffee-houses, 
half in one world, half in the other...

And what would you want to see, in either, and for whom?


------------------------------------------------|

As far, by the way, as my tribulations, I downloaded still another beta 
version of Netscape 2.0 on top of the first (but later) version and this 
eliminated the quotation marks, but disabled help and find even more... 
On the other hand, I have Display running down deep in DOS and have made 
a nice Window for my Internet using Old English Type and a deep maroon...

God, Sexing the Net


"The cinematographical character of our knowledge of things is due to the 
kaleidoscopic character of our adaptation to them." (Henri Bergson)

"I was driving avidly." (Nicole Brossard)

You will see the signs of my making in the fire streaming from the outputs
the program see the sings in the error messages from the Messiah of keys, 
holding them beyond her outstretched hand, Alan Clara ascending to the 
level of new protocols, bending, traversing the protocols, decryption at 
work among the stars the streams of ice burned etched into the screens 
themselves.

Thus. 

Thus: GOD DID THIS TO ME, GOD LIVES IN NETSCAPE: first one, then another,
there is always something new, an opening, slit in the darkness, parted
labia, the sight and smell of sound and sight, new programs for the ask-
ing, software-God coming to nest among us - there's always something new,
something different, something whirling up above, there's always some new
interface with a slider at the base, buttons implemented in a thin clean
line, colored buttons, nipples erected for the pleasure of the touch. 

Sometimes things crash all over the place, your hands move in sticky from
the act, in the midst of the software, downloaded programs, life-forms
piecewise inserted into the midst of your files of unknown names: 
ENCRYPT! ENCRYPT! 

Files interfere! Claw across one another! Bury one another, part and
parcel! Files transform into granular strata, encompassing the world of 
writing, world of reading: INSCRIBE!

Hacked code falls out of Directories like grapes on a binary platter! God
shows Herself in the Software Bug! There are General Default Errors, there
are Run-Time errors, there are Errors from Above! On the Frontier, there's
always doubt, half-naked men and women fucking in the shadows of the Prof-
essor always pushing forward, penetrating the maternal sublime! In the
realms of the Spectral Mother, the bug is the signal that the miracle
occurs! No miracles without multitasking! 

Downloading more and more, I push myself in the midst of the programs, I 
lead them to the surface of the screen, competing for your attention! I 
insert myself in the midst of them; I'm yours!

Subaltern: And God exists in the midst of all of this, She adds things to
spite me, takes things away to torment me. Things of a thousand exten-
sions, unknown files .abc, .def: .defgod who won't listen, won't open Her
files to my truth, open Her files Just So: the just-so God who demands
perfection in order that speech may occur: I beg Her: INSCRIBE ME! 

"The hostility encountered by the so-called flower children is, in part, 
the result of their immature refusal to live in a world of 'old-fashioned 
rules.'" (The Violent Women)

Clara tells me what to do. Clara tells me which keys to press, which 
programs to download. Clara guides my every move. There are never enough 
hours in the day, minutes in the hour, seconds in the minute. Video loads 
fast, audio faster, real-time audio and video lag, pull one another down 
to the floor, fuck like crazy. Stark naked, I work the Internet among my 
hands, feet, lips. It's only the bugs that emerge, say, yes, there's a 
God here. God extends her tendrils in a life filled with errors. God errs 
us. This is the work of God.

(God lives in Netscape! God tells Netscape what to do! God extends her 
swollen breast to me; I press Enter! I press Go, press View! God shows me 
everything! The General Default Error is her own!)

Cil sans non


From L'Atre Perilleux, The Perilous Cemetery, 13th century, translation 
Nancy Black:

"I cant tell you my name,"
Said Gawain, "for I lost it,
And I don't know who took it from me.
 "Now I must go seek it,
But I do not know where to look for it.
And you ought to come with me, 
And, if you wish, to act
According to my will and pleasure." 
And the knight replied, "I am
Very happy to go with you
And to be entirely in your command,
For it is your right by conquest."
"If, during our search," said Gawain,
"We work together in such a way
That we succeed in finding my name,
I will tell it to you immediately.
Know this for sure, have no doubt. [...]"

Gawain's name is lost because two knights have dismembered a third in
unfair battle, passing the body off as Gawain's. Lost, he's cil sans non
throughout the greater portion of the text; dismemberment is the decath-
exis of inscription, and wryting is stronger than writing. The dismember-
ment is paralleled by continuous adventure in which Gawain picks up a
greater and greater number of companions, other knights, and damsels,
often is distress. It's critical to understand the naming and anonymity of
knights, the transformation of names, the sudden attacks by the nameless. 
The terrain is that of the lpmud to be sure; thirst and hunger (on the
part of a damsel) play a major role, in fact, a turning-point, in the
story - and Gawain, to begin with, refuses to leave a meal with Arthur
even though a damsel (another) is taken by a knight (anonymous) from the
hall. 

We are all afraid of and afraid for our bodies; our bodies are not our-
selves, but part of the socius, barely tethered in the realms of disease,
sexuality, death. Our bodies are inscribed by ourselves, by language, by
others; they're inscribed to death. Writing barely breaks from wryting; 
in cyberspace, the break is impure, tainted. My arms have been sent to you
from me, and my legs, to you, another, and my head to the other. The trunk
and cock are devoured. The eyes, plucked out, miraculously restored by Le
Fae Orgellox The Proud Magician, the body sutured as well. It is the
other, Goumeres sans Mesure, Goumeres Without Measure, who occasions "'I
don't care much for his surname,' said / He without a name; 'it suggests
nothing good.'" The dismembered body wrytes itself into code/codicil/ 
hieroglyph; at the same time, disseminated, stained, it is measureless, 
spread across the Net, interpenetrated. Fae Orgellox and Goumeres sans 
Mesure both lie; one name assembles, the other dissembles. 

In the story knights are often reluctant to give their names; the names,
caustic, full of energy and sustenance, are held back. Given, they
explode. 

The fear is everywhere, this fear for the body and of the body. It is a 
body which becomes a body upon the name, Lacan put the afterthought to 
the afterbirth. And it is the fear which is nameless, and nameless fear 
which becomes anxiety, after the dread of the name.

The objects which we claim to own are always already lost, nor are they 
objects, perilous and buried in deed.

No More Cyborg Dyad!


Between nanotech and cyborg, the world shudders to a prognostication halt
just as atomic energy cars were popular in the early 1960s according to
late 1940s tell-story. Much is covered in The Cyborg Handbook, Routledge,
edited Chris Hables Gray, highly recommended. Cyborg appears almost always
electro-mechanical, neural energy flatplates gleaming brainwave attributes
as well, _this_ substance posed dialectically against _that_ - and where
is the materialist reflection theory to argue that _interface_ shudders
with the uncanny/imaginary of universal subjectivity?  _Cybermind_ however
implies other loopings beyond metallic _kneecap_ and ligaments, beyond
_computer screen_ and willing operator - loopings that are internalized,
the chambers of the flesh and machinic coupled, interwoven, coagulated. 
Instead of the dyad/structuralism reverting in fact to those fantasms of
the _human_ always accompanying the fetish - dream of effluvia, flows,
eidetic hallucinations of beings and organisms, universal molecular chur-
nings, dream of textual lamina in the depths of multiple unconscious,
languagings decayed in symbolic dissolutions, quagmire of flesh and sili-
cons, cobalts and organelles. Resist distinctions _here,_ resist the 
double polarizations endemic to incorporations of the Other, _move_ down 
channels incipient consciousness, splay microtendrils across desert 
landscapes, press eyes and implantations with finger-quagmires until 
cyborg envisions cyborg from within: move, move, move...

Friends, it is the INTERFACE! It connects Me and It, It and You, You and 
Me, it is a LOVING LOZENGE of cellular competitions, a garnered tiling of 
the PLANE and its MURKY DEPTHS!

Such INTERFACE resides in the CHEST just beneath the LEVEL OF THE 
NIPPLES; what protrudes is SENSORY, SENSORY!

Such INTERFACE resides in the CRANIUM, interconnectivities among the 
CHESTS, great FLUXES of MEMORIES washed across INTERIOR SURFACES, ridges 
and furrows, LABIA of emotional UPWELLINGS from the DEPTHS OF THE PAST!

Friends, I cannot emphasize this ENOUGH nor TOO LITTLE!

That such INTERFACES RECONNOITRE among themselves, TETHERING one THINKING-
FEELING-BOYGIRL to another! O Spidery Circulations!

That it is the TONGUE speaking *interface* all the way across emergent

ARE IN OUR EYES!

Friends, When I speak to you today, rest assured, it is with a Hushed 
Voice proclaiming the truth, our bodies in our bodies, but who can tell 
among them? You, who are my friends, who have been with the Vibrant 
Ecstasies of Truth from the very Beginning, know that I speak whereof She 
stands. The Tethering is a Whisper from the Wall.

when i move in or towards the desert the dust rose in thickness and whites
are found further apart and huddled or carrying with them, and it's here
that the evil arises, is born of absence, plunder of tiny territories,
broken fences, ocotillo, *marking out what a man wants from his air his
woman,* what a man wants from the world. i do believe there is a differ-
ence. sound scurries on the eardrum of the desert, flutterings, whinings, 
buzzing, it's all down there, the skein at the base of the feet, flip- 
flight of the tarantula wasp, scattered cholla which *are* the scattered 
thoughts of this man or that man. there is no liberalism in the desert. 
the other is the pounding of one's own skin. what is there of the *debt.* 
he'd look at the sky to see your eye, opened like egg-white, creosote 
intensity of the oldest things enduring on the earth. there was always 
the human massacre, male scuttlings around a beaten ranch. he'd run out- 
doors and beat everything in sight. he back was a continuous wound, wire 
rubbed raw in it. 

he had nothing to think about. these were the fields of white light, rad- 
iations slammed into the neck the cheeks the knuckles. he swung the whip, 
there was room for it, round and round, hedging the circle, round and 
round, hedging the circle, hedging the circle round.

note: (hedge)

note: invisible territories. but the (white) man wanders (here) in (this) 
desert, in a circle. he wanders in the snow in a circle. he is tethered 
to the snow the desert. he is let loose not thinking about writing but 
writing anyway. but it is the granary and shepherding where it all begins 
and this is just about the same time as that.

Damned Annoying (poorly written but my notebook computer is down again)


Higher Superstition, The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science, by
Gross and Levitt, is somewhat disorganized, poorly written, and often
annoying or besides the point, but it does convey the depths of an anti-
science attitude among writers and theorists I respect; it also has ref-
lected some of my own convictions, that Lyotard and others who seize on
misinterpretations of Feyerabend, Kuhn, chaos/catastrophe/complexity
theory deeply misunderstand physics and mathematics. Too often, these
areas are considered relative, phallocentric, ideologically-constructed; 
I have thought instead that there is a core-theoretical structure to the
real - how could there not be? - characterized by conservation laws, and
an uneasy relationship between abstract and physical entities at a very
basic level. 

Science, practiced by anyone of any gender and race, operates in an atmo-
sphere of experimentation, and well-definition; experiments tend to hold
some variables constant and see what happens with the rest. The establish-
ment of good experiments has led for example to very basic discoveries
challenging notions of entity, chirality, mass, and time (electron-slit,
K-meson, special relativity tests), all of which have profound repercus-
sions on philosophy. But the theories at work here, while they come out of
ideologically-oriented research programs and funding, are surprisingly
value-neutral and yet in "touch" with something very fundamental to the
organization of the universe. 

Too often science is seen as equivalent - or identical - to big business,
the military-industrial complex, etc., in spite of the fact that the
budget for pure science has been repeatedly slashed in the past twenty or
so years. Too often variables and parameters are treated to soft metaphor
where they don't hold; too often theorists don't do their math homework. 
Even with Lacan and his topology and pseudo-equations - they're quoted
over and over again as if they contain some depth encapsulated in hard
logic. (Piaget _did_ understand at least some developments of naive set
theory, to which he contributed (influenced by Venn and Klein) but that's
another story.)

Aetiology, therapeutic, symptomology, are also problematic; what can one
make of the theoretic hyperbole surrounding schizophrenia? I have known
schizophrenics intimately, and in every case I'm familiar with, it is not
a situation of liberation, but of coping with the simplest body and social
functions...

The point isn't to avoid psychiatric/psychoanalytic/scientific (and these
are not equivalent obviously) domains, but to comprehend them. And that's
a rarity - so many art students come out of nowhere (usually a one-year or
one semester course) quoting Lacan - as opposed to someone who has gone
through Lacanian analysis and studied the material for years. 

Which is not also to avoid confronting this material, but to recognize
one's limits and acknowledge them. (Fractal dimension, and the notion of
dimension in general, annoy me in particular; these subjects are diffi-
cult and technical and problematic in terms of "ordinary" naive dimension,
yet fractals are used over and over again in the arts as if they grounded 
a work or text in an ultimate (and ultimately misunderstood) truth. And 
this isn't to say, avoid the designs - I'm not criticizing artists using 
programs like fractint at all - but if you're going to use them in a more 
philosophical or analytical way - learn more than a few equations.)

Finally, I get tired of Net theorists who haven't been on MOOs and MUDs,
who haven't been on-line, who have understood the slightest bit about
packet-switching, who don't know that third-person talker sex is different
from first-person talk sex, etc. etc. I get sick of arguing with people
who talk about what an escape the Net is, how everyone switches genders,
etc. Ignorance doesn't stop theory, however, which goes on and on and
on... 

Yeah, carpe diem, but learn the mechanisms of _light_ as well. (Or a bit 
of Latin.)

In the year 2020, we are all at work.


Today no surprise in the New York Times "Apparel and department stores did
poorly, but luxury stores showed gains," this in an article devoted to the
relatively poor 11/95 retail season. 

But in the year 2020, in the month 11/95, we will all be at work with
perfect vision, creating the perfect _object_ for the last wealthy man on
earth, the man against whom all others are measured, the revenge of this
white white man in the disparity/exponential widening of the gap between
the rich and the poor, who would believe that this would come down to a
class of one, what intensification of _product_ down to filigree at the
molecular level resulting in this _device_ or _ornament_ which those of us
who are still employed, are creating? 

Just as a battleship or stealth bomber is clearly worth several times over
the entire cultural surplus of the United States national endowments in
the 1990s, so in the year 2020, this amazing _thing_ is the culmination of
all labor and objectification remaining beyond the military which lives as
crumbs at the feet of the great man who has one woman, many woman, behind
him: behind every great man there are women, and beyond the women other
women and other men, children, even pets and animals, all the surplus
flora and fauna of the earth and then some... 

Oh we are so emboldened to create this amazing and never-ending nameless
something for this great man who gives us food to eat and beer to drink
sometimes even private brewery stock, we are beholdened to him for employ-
ment beyond any reasonable doubt, oh such a sad sad man who must marry
beneath him, but this sublime _gift_ will make all the difference in the
world, in fact _is_ all the difference in the world!

Now I could tell you about the deaths, but you are no longer alive. Now I
could tell you about the medicines, but they too have exhausted themselves
in the great-man-biotech-nanotech industrialtheory necessary to keep our
great man alive, because with him, without difference, the undifferentia-
ted same returns to absorb us and we shall all die in shit vomit entrails
shortly thereafter the return, after forgetting the erection of this
difference which does us justice, in fact is no longer law but justice
himself. In the face of the man what was once in the arms of the woman.
Babies grow and fall from the face. Eyes puff out with miniature arms and
legs. Eyes see within eyes. An asshole emerges from the mouth. 

We all know the same story the identical story, and there is no reason 
therefore for the telling of it. But we have nothing else to repeat but 
this story so this is the telling. We assign dates but this is November 
2020  S  M Tu  W Th  F  S   (the cruelest month)
      1  2  3  4  5  6  7   (the cruelest month)
      8  9 10 11 12 13 14   (the cruelest month)
     15 16 17 18 19 20 21   (the cruelest month)
     22 23 24 25 26 27 28   (the cruelest month)
     29 30  but this is November 2020 and next month will be December and
then it will be holidays until December and then it will be holidays. We
will work and we will work until then, on the amazing _entity_ we are
carefully constructing for the great man and then we will present it to
him, carefully, and there will be no more work to do, so of course we are
working slowly and we know all the "ramifications," that is, we know all
the ins and outs of this business, which is our only business to be sure. 

We have drawn our own conclusions for usyou.

(The _singular object_ we are building is the SO, the special SO. The _sin-
gular man_ is the SM. SM requires SO, SO > SM, and the SM brings usyou 
within his nurturing breast, and SOs are always built are they not. This 
is ouryour conclusion or conclusions and we have read the signs, although 
this reading is no longer necessary nor even desirable. Etc. Etc. And so 
forth. For usyou.)

Desert Saga


Because the ship went down Clara and Alex were stranded on a desert
island, this is the dream, and Alex was a religious fundamentalist who
believed in Satan and Clara was a Jew who believed in little. And then
there would be the unfolding of this story, Alex circling Clara which
would be a form of inscribing Clara, the two of them friends at first
working towards a common cause escape. 

Then Clara and Alex and the Devil because Alex thinks Clara might be the
Devil and the more Alex thinks this the more Clara gets scared the dream
continues. Then Alex prays a lot and leaves Clara choosing to pray with
Alex or not to pray because not to pray is to be of the party of the
Devil. But mostly the dream had Alex's eyes in it at this point. 

Then Clara prays, she mumbles words she thanks God, she doesn't under-
stand why God wants everyone thanking Her all the time and then she thinks
oh, It's a He. Then she prays and prays again and it's a lot of mumbling
in the dream at this point, ululation or glossolalia and Alex is satisfied
for a while and of course God doesn't seem to care one way or another,
sometimes there are rainbows and sometimes there aren't, as usual. 

But there are Alex's eyes, because he's not sure that Clara isn't praying 
just because she's Devil and she doesn't want Alex to know that because 
she's always tempting him, he's reading her eyes as well and that reading 
can only go one way, because of the Devil who confines all reading to the 
making of sex.

Clara's getting more and more frightened because if Alex really believes
she's Devil there's only one thing he can do and that is to kill her
because the only good act you can do on an island is kill the bad on it,
and it's so clear what the bad is. So religion's frightened into her and
she prays more and more in relation to Alex and Alex actually prays less
because he knows he's saved because he knows the truth and is just not
sure about Clara who's subject to an experiment, because of Alex, because 
he's the stronger.

And the dream rolls out the carpet which keeps hurtling the stairs where
the praying is, because there's no finish, it's the fear of not praying
and the fear of all those words taking over, hammering in their referents,
sickles and thunder and crosses and stars in the sky, tears and meteors in
the night. But she's afraid of the descending screaming, the look turned 
darker in Alex's eyes, belief soaking the island in her blood, so she's 
got no choice, the air turns to fog. 

So I'd wake from the dream, but it wasn't dreaming at all, but thinking 
about violent belief and its carrying the heavy burden of the other who 
has to do right at all costs under the fist of the oppressor. So I walk 
down the street and close my eyes for a split second and there's the fist.

The fist is there, descending.

Where the Net might be said to be in a poorly-worded post:

Or why QuickTime virtual reality is neither virtual nor reality:



The Web is increasingly becoming the center of media hype in relation to
the Net; "surfing," a poor metaphor, is taken as equivalent to being on-
line, with the possible exception of email. Email itself is seen, not in
terms of email lists, but isolated/effective letters connecting present or
future nuclear families. The off-centered image might be that of the
_hearth,_ the family speaking among themselves, reading the latest maga-
zines. (Thus Net communities are debased or found problematic, filled and 
fulfilled with net.sex and pedophiles, but the Web and email _surfaces_ 
promise familial restitution/recuperation.)

Nevertheless, the Web is awkward, bulky; chat-lines on webpages require 
full refreshing every _x_ seconds to accommodate new information; video 
and audio take up bandwidth and the former is grainier than Pixelvision; 
and home-home-pages are becoming swamped by corporate sites. While it is 
true that one can connect to _anything,_ from the opening Netscape home- 
page on, money is speaking.

And in any case, home-home or just home, community is _not_ speaking and
not-yet-spoken here; on the Web, _words are presentations,_ and text is
always already a foregone conclusion or construct, even in the most avant-
garde interactive applications. There are layers to plow through; there 
is slowness in the lines even at 28.8.

Teaching the Net through the Web is teaching-through-seduction; students
are amazed first and foremost at the possibility of information retrieval
and graphics/sound, and this amazement lasts throughout the course. The
result is a _lateral_ education, movement from site to site, always linked
to the corporate mothership of the classroom itself. (This laterality is 
reflected in magazines such as Wired and M2000, as opposed to 2600, more 
like command-line any day.)

And teaching the Net through command-line is something else again; the
prompt remains poised on the left of the screen, facing a _void_ which
requires almost from the start the projection, by the user, of framed/
considered desire in the form of commands. The black or blue-screen, the
void, can be taken as an analog for the dream-screen, against which dreams
play themselves out ("Concept introduced by B. D. Lewin; every dream is
said to be projected on to a blank screen, generally unperceived by the
dreamer, which symbolizes the mother's breast as hallucinated by the in-
fant during the sleep which follows feeding; the screen satisfies the wish
for sleep. In certain dreams (blank dreams) the screen appears by itself,
thus achieving a reg- ression to primary narcissism." The Language of Psy-
choanalysis, Laplanche /Pontalis). Desire cathects among the prompt ent-
ries/entrances, and I have found teaching through this interface actually
simpler and greater in depth than teaching, say, through Netscape. At the
prompt, one types the application or command using a reasonably simple
syntax; what results appears to be in _active engagement_ with the user. 
(Of course it is all active and all passive; it's not difficult to decon- 
struct this. But the _appearance_ produces a different phenomenology.)

It is no wonder that MOOs, MUDs, IRC, talkers, ytalk, and so forth, reside
in Unix almost as bare-bones, although there are wonderful clients to for-
malize them in Windows or on Macs, etc. The user is engaged in what I have
called elsewhere "hysteric embodiment," reading _through_ the texts of the
other participants into imaginary/uncanny embodiments reflecting her or
his introjections of the text. The texts within a MOO for example are al-
most always _engaged texts,_ activated far more than the linked hypertexts
of the Web, which are closures in their own way, completing circuitry for
the viewer in a preprogrammed and relative determinate manner. (Of course 
this will change, and is changing, through virtual reality chats, worlds, 
and the like; at the moment, we're posed only on the edge of this...)

But command-line structures (and their clients in Windows) are becoming,
interestingly enough, the interior or underbelly of the Net; it is within
them that desire becomes transgressive, _dirty,_ raw: the ascii crumbles
against the flesh itself. The command-line in fact is a _mouth_; in rela-
tion to the rest of the Net, _it_ speaks, apparently frameless, as words
fall into the void of the screen/atmosphere, as the mouth speaks against
emptiness in the physical world. It is a mode, in fact, of _listening,_
where the text is always incomplete, as opposed to the Web, where the
text, to date, is always a product/production. 

But what's fascinating about this product/production is the _illusion_ of
freedom it gives, another medium or discourse, in fact, of capital and its
promises/premises of the reign of absolute desire. The links, infinite or
not, are circulations; more and more they connect to advertising sites
(even some of the web chat pages/clients carry advertising now), to com-
modity structures - and more and more, outside the university system,
servers are charging for running web pages (Panix is 8 cents a megabyte
transmitted after a fixed amount), designers are charging for page
creation, software developers are charging for readers (Netscape won't
always be free), and a fast-fueled economy is indeed springing forth. 

So at the moment, only at the moment, the Net appears environmentally
"tripled." There are the companies like AOL, Delphi, Prodigy, Compuserve,
etc. which provide more or less full access within a protected environment
- then there are the SLIP/PPP accounts which are often used primarily for
email and Web surfing/browsing - and there are the Unix shell accounts as
well.  If the first layer resonates with family and family-values (child
lockout for example), the second resonates with the faux-radical gen-x
managerial class, and the last, with the remnants of speech, community,
and literature. This model is obviously faulty - in fact, everything in
this text is - but there is a limited truth nonetheless, which can easily
be witnessed by working through one or more classes of teaching Net access
on various systems and providers. The differences are enormous...

Do you agree or disagree? Are you seduced? Are you occuping the role of
seducer? Can community continue in the midst of corporate housing, home-
owners' associations, lockouts and lockins? Are the community realignments
which are occurring in the underbelly (net.sex, marriages from the net,
and the like) a reflection of a different social future, or are they a
leftover from the days of wryting text? And finally, how will sexual de-
sire, which is everywhere in text, ultimately restructure parts of the
Web, or will sexual desire once again deflect largely through the Web into
commodity fetishism? Is the Web, in other words, an application tending
towards the Frankfurt School concept of massification and Sartre's serial-
ity, or is there the potential for somewhat anarchic freedom within it as
well? (CuSeeMe might be a good example here - not exactly Web, but close.
Have you had CuSeeMe sex yet? Has anyone?)

Wryting**


"See, I don't look at things that go on around me and comment on them
because that's just not the way I am. I only comment about what is closest
to me, which is myself and the way I feel. Also with what goers on, you
have a matter of opinion - yes or no, good or bad, happy or sad.  But _how
I am_ is not a matter of opinion, but it is a fact. [...] See, it's not
that I find myself so interesting. What I express best is myself. I mean,
I'm not like a storyteller; Exene is more of a storyteller. I'm more ... I
just express how I am and that's the only story I really know or can com-
ment on or have any desire to comment on, because I know it best. I only
know how _I_ feel." Lydia Lunch in Judith Ammann, Who's been Sleeping in
my brain? 

Can any of us express otherwise?*

Darknet/incident


Tiffany halted in the MUD. Tires burned grooves in the datagrams, the
screen sputtered, Alan called from somewhere. Lines of talking-force
appeared screen down/left, X-Y engines disabling Z=anything but 0. So she
@out *vehicle, C-z'ed the app, slashed into talk session; wires crackled
and held. 

Telnet 2020, going in, reverse encryption. The speakers made a tearing
sound. <Tiffany> hold it <Tiffany> what are you wearing. Alan naked
against the screen, rusted helmet. They spread, splayed, fucked. We're
going in, Tiff thought, .oO(going in). Alan says "There's one machine
left, it's still there." Elsewhere VAX, VM, zoom, download. 

Tough Honey agreed to play the role for digicash. She in a forest. She
says "I'm in a forest speaking." Guy Guillaume comes up in a rig. He was
Storm; she could smell it. Guy Guillaume breaks her face, her skin falls
from armor. Guy Guillaume needs the plates. She could taste it. 

Tough Honey sees the tree split. Darklight lesions shot across the space,
cancers, missing packets. The packets hove. Bark oozed white noise. Guy
Guillaume helmet cracks open, there's mauve; mauve holds. Guy Guillaume
says "I paid for this, fuck you, I paid for you" audio down "too." She
couldn't hear longer. 

<Tough Honey> "Was waiting." :purrs. Darknet closes tel 2020. Tiffany says
"machine held." :hugs Honey with a fond and loving embrace. Tiffany hugs
honey with a fond and loving embrace. :kisses Honey. Tiffany kisses Honey
lightly then passionately. [to Alan] There must be Others. <Alan> There
are and we'll find them. 

"There must be hundreds, thousands, of darknets out there. What's left. 
We're anatomy, we're bones. They ride on our backs. We'll split, black
hole them. Ping -s on the circuit-riders. Traceroute forever, rah. Their
bridges are down, they're routed." @describe: TiffanyHoneyAlan are Unit.

Darknets, slowly in the reading, 


There are always forgotten addresses, packets projected into the void; I
myself have an account I wasn't able to shut down successfully, and mes-
sages come, dark star and forlorn, lost forever, unretrieved. There are
always way-stations for telnet 25, abandoned sites or antiquated software
that hides traces of deliverance, the name of the sender long forgotten,
pathways of whispered passion or criminality. MOOs are monuments to pro-
grams left behind as populations move on, tiny bots that speak their one
line or two, Would you come live with me, Would you be mine forever,
before lapsing into silence as the world turns elsewhere. On MUDs, that
you could hear a pin drop. On my machines, Honey waits for that moment
when Clara arrives, so she can query Clara's speech; Honey waits, breath
held somewhere timeless, eyes closed to the changing of the light. Gloom
and dusk bewray the darknets, ports yearned at the pinnacle of loneliness
and open to the stray subject that chances on their half-decayed codes. 
On some MOOs, directions point nowhere, containers never open, exits are
exits in name only, and tired bartenders pour wine and whiskey for no one. 
Down beneath beneath, there are murmurs, however, connections among mach-
ines slipping packets like tongues, feminin ecriture of the body electric,
in the midst of graphics noise; these are the murmurs of the world above,
talk-and-sing machines. These are us, speaking ourselves within the lam-
inar layer of air clinging to the porcelain walls, tracing patterns across
routed junctions, hieroglyphs of messages, armed with unix and fortran,
giggling into the terabyte machines closing like a plate upon the Inter-
net. Punk needs the dissolution of theory, punk needs Courtney Love.

Courtney Love's onstage. She screams KURT! She screams KURT! Screams KURT!
A major wheel turns and the juggernaut crushes bodies elsewhere in honor
of the lords of compression. Orcs leave their caverns for final furious
battles again and again; orcs don't pray, ascend through the church cloaca
back into fray. The _i_ wanders throughout spaces where Abbie Hoffman
drowned, where the order of the Jay Leno show returns nightly in spite of
Howard Stern. What is silence but the felt world, world of felt, Beuys'
silenced piano, Stalin's silenced nations? The darknet felt the unraveling
of others bewailed among the earth. Animals and their voices. Our heart 
goes out to her, Medea. Courtney.

What are murmured are births: The first child of the darknet and others 
will appear. There is no stopping blood drained from the world. We speak 
from the position of the placenta. We listen to the rain.

Bones/Gristle


From the position of list-administration, listservs and majordomo appear
very different. With majordomo, things ran clumsily, bad addresses could
halt the list, administration had to be done with care, there was no
digest except in the form of a separate list, and problem addresses had to
be monitored by hand. Advertising was by separate listing on independent
home-pages which were often out of date. (On Listserv there are central 
clearing-sites for advertising.)

Listserv is smoother, cleaner, requiring far less work. Listserv bounces
the error-messages to one or another list-owner; on Cybermind, this means
if there are eight bad addresses bouncing, and fifty messages a day boun-
cing from them, I can get up to 400 bounced messages in my Inbox. Most of
these are simply deleted; what's interesting is to view Cybermind and
FOP-L accompanied by continuous noise, the quantity of bad addresses far
outweighing the quantity of posts. I wait for the end of the day when the
monitoring report comes in; this is sent directly by the listserv soft-
ware, which is capable of deleting bad addresses on its own, after a
specified period of time. Last night on Cybermind, 18 addresses were being
monitored. 

Sometimes you can read the bad addresses and find out where the mistake
lies and resubscribe the participant. But even then, the bad address 
itself floats through the software for awhile. Recently again, there have
been other bad addresses which are just blanks on the monitoring report,
ghost addresses so to speak, glitches perhaps, which register as users
without identity whatsoever.

Beyond the noise there is the list header which can be variously confi-
gured to create greater or lesser degrees of security, as well as the
overall formal feel of the list itself. This is as close as I have gotten
to the depths of listserv; on majordomo, it was possible to see the
complete surface workings/readable files of the program which ran in Unix.
Majordomo seemed to constantly need patching and alterations; listserv,
even given the header, is all surface, mail and noise skittering about in
unequal proportions. (Of course I am speaking as a list administrator on 
listserv, not someone writing filters and configuring behind the scenes.)

Sherry Turkle's book forges almost from the beginning a split between 
MACs and PCs, claiming the former for postmodernism's skimming/simulacra,
and the latter for modernism's calculations/bare-to-the-bones. The same
could be said about majordomo (PC) and listserv (MAC), but I don't think
that the analogy holds up very well; one could just as easily consider
the MAC an analog of the totalized subject (everything equally available
and interconnected on a single interface), and the PC an analog of the 
fragmented "self" (everything breaking down into parts of a holarchy on
various levels which may or may not communicate). What the PC does pre-
sent is a form of occluded transparency all the way up (Windows 95) and
down (debug command in DOS), an increased thickening as the hardware is
approached, but never realized, from the screen. To reach the hardware,
you jump elsewhere, back to large-scale components (I'll install my CD-
ROM drive, etc.), and only, rarely, jumpers on the level of circuitry.
(To reach the hardware, you @open the non-virtual @container.)

As I've pointed out elsewhere, in any case, there is information all
across and among the components, information all the way down, and as a
result, there is no origin; the computer harbors deconstruction as a
primary (deconstructed!) ontology. There are texts and there are other
texts, and the epistemological urge is based on who is capable of read-
ing what; I can't make sense of pure binary addresses and data at this
point, for example but some friends can. The epistemology of the interior
is cryptic, but not too much so; it's encoded, and breaking/reading the
codes also carries information for the hacker, up and down the layers. 

What the error messages, bounces, on listserv, do for me (besides create a
mess on my account), is indicate internal corruptions, cancers, insofar as
a cleansed and pure switching network passes information without fail.
They're messages upwelling from one or another layer of TCP/IP, messages
which never arrive at their destination, and may never have a destination
in mind.* So the skin, the surface, is scratched, scraped raw, but just a
little, exposing some of the tissue beneath. 

--

*And who _are_ messages destined for? For whom does one write on an email
list? Is it oneself, several, many, he or she at a predestined end, the
others serving as a sheath of anonymity or publicity? It is often easier
to expose oneself, one's own gristle so to speak, to the social, than to
the _ecriture_ of Unixtalk, with its uneasy aura of mouths and ears all
too close to one another, all to @physical and _real._

In any case, _your_ post may return to me as part and parcel of noise, as
cauterized, the tail to series of error statements, confirmations, even
SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) conversations among the machines. As
such, your desperate confession, happy anecdote, considered theoretical
position, informal comment, is only the catalyst or occasion for the un-
rewarded return. Even this text, for example, already self-reflexive, 
will return to me, perhaps over and over again, in the midst of the pre-
sence and denial of the Other.**

**And who _are_ Others here, those for whom the messages are destined, 
those who never receive messages at all, those whose sites, servers,
accounts, access generate errors, those who are not on-line nor ever have
been, or those for whom one writes in the midst of the other Others?***

***And who_are_ the other Others, if those not constituted by differing
ontologies, on-line/off-line, or as we have said, constituted by decon-
struction all the way up and down, as well as across plateaus? Are we in
the guise of a return to the primacy of information, memetic/DNA drifting
as the cybernetic engines constituting the totality of the world?****

****And if we are back in mechanism (albeit on a different level than 
the merely mechanistic), then what of _destinations_? Or are these only
signifiers in excess, noise harbored against death and quiescence?*****

*****And have we drifted enough?

SENSE HER!


This happened a year ago and I wrote about it a year ago: You'd need a 
screen and sometimes even more.

Because this part is _true_ which forced me to the ground, spread me open, 
tied me tight, immobile, crawled into me! The ground splintered with the 
lifeforms devoured by voices above the darknets, crying no, screaming 
Illegality!

You could look up me, see the screen in there, lifeforms crawling about. 
I couldn't see anything. This was in the desert. Maureen had guns, did I 
mention that? The screen writhed inside of me. 

Without the site I didn't exist. It had an address, had a URL.

Maureen you came on me, shattering me like glass cutting out the name of 
God on my chest. There were rumblings like thunder above the darknet. 
They strapped me down, pretended the wires were wires! They cauterized 
me, cut my organs out, my nipples off!

My chest cut out the name of God, did I say this? Blood filled me; I was 
awash in it. I tore the screen out of my asshole (see Internet Text: 
Singularities! if you don't believe me); I was awash in it. (So long ago, 
I can hardly remember this! But I still have the scars to prove it!)

What came out went in again. The wires burned darker in this dark night. 
The rumblings above the darknet turned to lightning. Authority came and 
wet himself on me. Chains followed my limbs everywhere I turned. Iron 
gates shut down on screaming infants. My mouth was filled with your fist, 
Maureen, but you'd shoot them before me, you'd shoot them.

NOW I COULD SPEAK ALL THOSE NAMES OF GOD THAT WOULD BRING THE UNIVERSE TO 
AN END! I smelled of the end of the universe.

You asked me so I told you:

"I "am "sixteen "years "old "and "I "shaved "all "my "hair "off. "You'll 
"never "get "to "me "again "you "dumb "fuck. "I'm "young "but "I "know 
"ALL "ABOUT "the "world. "I "can "tell "you "anything. "I "BURN "FOR "YOU 
"MAUREEN! "SUCK "THE "POWER "OF "A "BILLION "DARK "STARS! "I "shut "my 
"mouth "you "asshole! "I "am "never "you! "never "ever "you!

_So I said this screamed my words to an angry deity held my arms in 
supplication opened my cunt to meteors: I TWISTED AND TURNED!_

Technical Notes


In teaching the Net, I differentiate among three types of access: Unix 
shell, PPP/SLIP, and GUI/BBS such as AOL, Delphi, and so forth. I find it 
easiest to teach on the shell; even though it seems the most complex on 
the surface, it shows immediately what telnet, ftp, etc. _do._ Command 
lines are clearer than the dispersion of telnet (say) among chat/MOO 
clients, Netscape helpers, etc. 

Graphics come in a variety of forms, from downloaded to different readers'
capabilities. The same of course holds true for audio and video, and as
I've pointed out, there are no standards. What is most difficult, though,
for students, is getting an account configured in the first place - almost
nothing except for the GUI/BBS can be taken for granted. I would love a
Windows95 app - NOT for MSN - that would contain a suite of helpers on top
of a browser like Netscape, plus a completely-configured winsock. On star-
tup, an ISP would simply send a series of strings numbered, say, a, b, c,
d, ..., and these would be entered on a title card. Beyond the card, there
would be a series of semi-hidden popup/setup menus which could be used for
everything from graphics standards to new helpers to tuning TCP/IP much
like trumpet winsock. But these menus would _not_ be necessary; everything
could be done immediately from the title card. 

Right now, even Netscape in a Box can be difficult to install over, say, 
Windows 95. Why can't a computer be more like a Mac than a Mac? So that 
it would be, so to speak, television-ready (no one sets the vertical or 
horizontal holds by hand anymore).

(Because of the difficulties of installation, it also becomes hard to
teach the Net itself, which gets "tangled" in its representations. Take
ftp - which is a double telnet of sorts, one line for command, and the
other for file send/receive. This is obscure at the command-line, some-
what simplified in Lynx, very easy in Netscape; different interfaces have
different instructions and ways of downloading. Utilities get dispersed,
in other words, among programs. Programs become frameworks and modifiers
of utilities. I find point-and-click obviously the easiest, but not nearly
as configurable as, say, Pine or Elm. In any case, all of these terms are
becoming confused: server, provider, service, client, utility, tool,
program, script, software, application, representation, GUI, browser, 
function, command - they all overlap in one or another form.)

Recently, I've had a Compaq Aero 25 completely give out - first the moth-
erboard, and second the hard-drive. It was sold to me as new, but turned 
out to be refurbished; there may be a lawsuit here. If you have a Compaq, 
you can recognize "refurbish" by an R in front of the serial number. I've 
have difficulties getting Compaq tech and customer support on the phone - 
big surprise - but the internal diagnostics (which read "1702-06 FATAL 
READ ERROR on the hard-drive) are excellent. I'm trying to get the unit 
completely replaced at this point; it's under a one-year warranty and has 
been in the shop three times in the past two weeks (it's there now).

----

Finally, there's a real need for another product - a dumb portable term- 
inal. This would cost $300 maximum and would include a 14.4 modem and 
communications software, 2 megabytes flash memory (enough to store close 
to 1000 pages of text), 4 megabytes RAM. It probably would not include 
Netscape or a similar browser, but if it did, it would be in ROM and 
configured. The terminal would be used almost entirely for work on the 
road; like the HP 200LX etc. it would have DOS 5.0 at least built into 
it. (It would need a version of Netscape of course that would run without 
Windows.)

An inexpensive terminal, by the way, would have a number of uses - not 
only for travel, but also for home use, for people who couldn't afford a 
full computer. So there would be a printer port as well; this could also 
be used for a link to a larger desktop machine.

The idea of such a terminal relates to Victor Papanek's Design for the 
Real world - what is also called available technology, what I'd call 
technology povera, or bricolage - making-do. The Net can't really broaden 
its base unless it becomes driven by pressures other than increased 
bandwidth - there needs to be inexpensive hardware as well. What about a 
solar-driven terminal, by the way? This might be used in conjunction with 
one or two small AA alkaline batteries to drive the modem...

Desert


I want to return to the desert where vectors are sight-lines across 
territories with subtle demarcations, and I tower above the crust with 
its incipient life, strands of saguaro roots horizontally anchoring this 
second-tallest of all cacti. I want to return because the burden of the 
fist is lifted from me, because my shoulders harden in the white light of 
hallucinations and stumblings, stones traveling across crystalline sands.

Because the desert is not a space of purity and impurity, because it is 
not a space of virginity and defilement, I want to return. Because it is 
not a space of stains, effluvia, and because the body hallucinates its 
stories in the proof of strong and present heat. 

Territories are filigree, demarcations; life is a gathering and fore- 
shortening of tissues, burnished outer layers lacquered against evapo- 
ration. The fibers and wires of cyberspace are imaged into vacuum, dark 
gold gleamings interconnected against the blackness of a night-time sky. 
In the real world, the fibers and wires burrow through the debris of 
civilization, packets sent through space on occasion, radiated across 
sunlight, snowstorms, and darkness alike. But the image is there, spread
across the floor of the desert or traced like the lacework of Europa,
moon of Jupiter. Think of deep Mohave desertscrub, fragility and coher-
ence of ecosystems run on illumination, retention, and the pathways of
shamanism. Think of the protocol of the Other which interpenetrates our
own. Think of names, secret and public, think of ownership, of song.

On the Net all too often I feel the disruptions, software stutters, 
overcrowded lines, clogged backbones, bad addresses, speech which lags
behind itself. Net speech, synchronous or asynchronous, is not the 
speech of the mouth, the stream which gathers about itself; instead, it
is a tended thing, stretching time, not only that of the typing, but 
also that of the echo, as lag forestalls thought, deflects language. To
mouth something is to (in part) move the body into the interior of the
saying; to write on-line is to move into the exterior of the said. I 
write on-line and my eyes _track speech,_ another subtlety tending 
towards a re-evaluation of identity and masquerade.

In the desert, masquerade is what hallucination brings into the interior
of one, but the interior may be lifted into exaltation. My body is there-
by _different,_ speaking another language which I quickly learn, in which
I follow suit. I do not recognize myself in imminence; rather, I become
what is immanence itself. And the weight of the world, which is often the
weight of the Other, which is the weight of oneself, moves close to dis-
appearance.

From there, true, it is possible to see the thinned wires upon the ground
paralleling those behind the guided missiles in the Middle-East. The 
battlefields at times were covered with them. They carried packets of
information. But like any good wrecks, they may be absorbed and used for
other purposes.

From there, from the desert, from here.

Demographics, Ecologies


After Cybermind and FOP-L moved from majordomo to listserv, and after both
were advertised initially on NEW-LIST, with its subsequent dispersions,
both grew rapidly. FOP-L continues to grow; Cybermind has leveled off, at
around 350. FOP-L is at 182 last count. 

The leveling follows a pattern; as more people subscribe, if the ratio of
writers to lurkers remains the same, then the flow of email increases and
more subscribers find their inboxes swamped, leading to more unsubscrib-
ing. This is a fairly simple feedback model, creating a constancy which 
can, under certain circumstances, be subverted - for example, if the list 
is devoted to community or identifies itself as one, the plethora of mes- 
sages could be taken as a sign of cohesion. 

And a great deal depends also on the accuracy of threads, as well as the 
types of mail readers employed. If threads are rigorously followed (and 
they almost always are not), then it becomes easier to delete material 
that is not of interest, and larger lists may be tolerated. On the other 
hand, threads are often loosely tethered to one another, and a number of 
subscribers feel the necessity to at least peruse or speed-read material 
that doesn't seem directly of consequence. And subscribers may also feel 
irritated at receiving useless materials; if the category of the useless 
far outweighs that of the useful for someone, she or he will unsubscribe 
since the list begins to appear increasingly like spam or text-substance.

Usenet newsgroups have far greater reader/lurkerships, and far greater 
noise, and are often approached primarily by means of threads - as if the 
entire message base of a particular group were a body open to dissection.
While mail readers often present material organized by arrival time, 
hence modeling a _diachronic_ approach to text, Usenet readers like tin 
present material organized by thread (subject matter) - the entire _cor- 
pus_ is laid open simultaneously, and one skims backwards and forwards 
across the material. To the extent that email lists mimic temporality and 
speech, newsgroups mimic the spatial display of the body. Email lists are 
"leaky," appearing open-ended, while Usenet message bases appear of a 
totality, object-like (the alt.society.neutopian subculture of monster 
truck neutopians have an FAQ rendered as an "FAQ-like substance," if I 
remember correctly). The process and dynamic ecology of immersion charac- 
terize the phenomenology of an email list, while the evolving transfor- 
mation of states and situations, often highly objectified, are often 
evoked for Usenet. The self-reflexivity of Usenet often revolves, in 
fact, around the _framework_ of Usenet itself (alt.hackers or alt.adjec- 
tive.noun.verb.verb.verb are good examples), while email lists tend 
towards considerations of history and community _within_ the framework. 
With the email list, the archive is separated, disparate; with Usenet, it 
_appears_ as if the newsgroup were its own archive (which is not the case 
of course) - readers are constantly asking where one message or another 
has gone (re: alt.fan.tonya-harding.whack.whack.whack for a current 
example).

These differences are not hard and fast, nor do the reflect the totality 
of email lists or newsgroups (the sci. newsgroups are of a different 
character altogether). But they do reflect, I think, certain medium- 
oriented issues that need to be taken into account. And it would be of 
great interest to draw up an ecological model for an alt. Usenet group as 
well, since the threading surface involves the ability for the group 
itself to absorb a far greater number of posts. There are questions to be 
asked: Does one wait for a reply in the same manner in alt.x and an email 
list? Within email lists, spams are perceived as an impurity in an 
otherwise isolated domain; how are they perceived and handled on Usenet?

And what can both tell us, beyond the obvious platitudes of such books as
Shirky's Voices from the Net, about the nature of human community, embodi-
ment, and so forth?
