the desert, the stream in the desert
the framing and construction of death
the processing of death
the violation of identity and descendents

occasion of death is no occasion
violation of mourning constriction of mourning
the building of the mark of decapitation
the race and religion of death's framing
the bodies of death's framing the gender
the fury and condemnation of bodies 
the annihilation of infinitesimals
scrabbling of infinitesimals annihilation of limits
the burnings, everywhere the burnings

the images sicken me, less and less cartoons, 
more and more the transgression of eidetic imagery
now i am tired, now i must rest

again and again "I know that that's a tree", pointing to a tree 
that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell 
him: "This fellow isn't insane. We are only doing philosophy."

Great Review of our new cd Threnody!

Check it out -

http://disasteramnesiac.blogspot.com/2015/08/disaster-amnesiac-mixed-bag-of.html


Alan Sondheim/Azure Carter/Luke Damrosch-Threnody: Shorter Discourses of 
the Buddha-Public Eyesore Records #133, 2015
If you've read this blog at all within the last year or so, you'll be 
well-appraised at how generous Public Eyesore/eh? Records have been to me 
(thanks, Bryan!) They sent over the newest offering from Alan Sondheim and 
Azure Carter a few weeks back, and Disaster Amnesiac has been digging this 
one greatly. Threnody features the extensive talents of Sondheim on 19 
instruments, and he shows tremendous skills on all of them. His 
skittering, fast string playing throws out all manner of micro-tonal 
delights within its speedy delivery, and his playing on wind instruments 
has emotional depth, warmth, and balance. Sondheim's aesthetic evinces the 
awesome power of Folk-based sounds within the greater musical spectrum. 
Dear America: please pay attention to this homegrown talent! It's a shame 
that Sondheim's six decades of singular musical development are not as 
widely acknowledged. He's a Master. Also quite enjoyable are the 
understated vocals from Carter. Listening to Azure sing evokes the same 
kind of pleasure for me that comes from reading well written Minimalism. 
Great clarity and enjoyment comes from the apparent simplicity of her 
delivery, which is completely free of extraneous embellishment. Would that 
so many other current singers learn from her! The addition of Luke 
Damrosch on guzheng and madal adds percussive string and drum depth, 
respectively, and his layered summation of Threnody's totality of songs on 
Alltracks achieved by use of Supercollider software, is deliciously 
bizarre and thick!

Sterling 19th-century banjo in a myna mynor key

http://www.alansondheim.org/radio093.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/mynorbanjo.mp3

when I play I'm always trying to extend my abilities, try 
something new until I've exhausted it. here, the banjo is tuned 
to a minor key, and because of the instability of the minor 
(hence myna bird, mimic, new languages), especially around the 
third, I can move freely and quickly through different episodes, 
structures that come and go; towards the end of the pieces, 
tunes appear and disappear, almost but not quite dance music. 
it's hard to keep track of the structures, especially since the 
way I play involves fast runs up and down the neck, which brings 
muscle memory constantly into play - where have I been, where am 
I going? and these are general questions of course, for which 
the instrument becomes a chora or microcosm of potential and 
ultimate stasis, only here, within the playing, there's still 
quick thinking and a bit of time on the planet.

Theoryland!: On Gamespace / Edgespace (for an upcoming talk)


http://www.alansondheim.org/theorylandb.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/theoryland.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/theorylanda.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/theorylandc.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/theorylandd.png

Together with the misery that ensues working inconceivably 
against the grain of the real - that is to say, the boundary 
conditions:

1. of the edgespace itself and the transformations occasioned by 
the edgespace; and

2. of the interiority of the edgespace - within which objects 
and protocols are conserved/observed.

So within 2. there is a work, a level of _skill_ necessary to 
produce, articulate, quest - skill that operates within 
consensual boundaries, even to the extent that they're broken by 
hacking, shortcuts, etc. Here in 2. the issue is that of 
etiquette.

In 1. the situation is different; at the edgespace, what occurs 
is not an _event_ but collapse or murmurs of _procedures_ within 
fold catastrophies - always on the verge of failure. The 
edgespace is also _sedimented_ - to the extent that sediments 
can be entangled - one might move for example to a new physics, 
the gamebrowser might crash, there is always something new, some 
new anomaly at work...

I think of the interiority, that is the gamespace, as a space of 
etiquette which is always a space of the blank - not smooth 
striations, but a phenomenological ennui, since falling through 
this space leads only to more quests, more hordings, within a 
containment that takes on the semblance of a _carapace._ That 
is, one is shape-riding, share-holding - there's an economics 
involved, structures of rules and protocols, protocol suites - 
all porous, hackable, all resulting in signs, signifiers, within 
the gamespace - all intrinsically related to an other economics 
of exhaustion.

The edgespace borders on the universe. The edgespace _gapes._

Who or what moves in the edgespace? What terrors, anguish, what 
absolute creations and annihilations? And as well, what 
temporalities, what fictitious _points of origin_ - everywhen, 
everything, on a sliding scale - a scale in the form of the 
_law,_ not of justice. Justice has no place within or without 
the game, within or without the gamespace.

Justice requires the luxury of thought, the alcove, stoa; law 
requires the nomadic, the corral, the seething settings and 
withdrawals of inscriptions which are fundamentally 
transparent...

The edgespace is _indescribable,_ just as anomaly exists as 
instantaneous, as seizure, nothing more.

But _here,_ it is where everything, everywhen, begins.

PROMISCUOUS, INDISCRIMINATE 

 _Promiscuous,_ in Latin _promiscuus,_ from _promisco,_ or _pro_ 
and _misceo_ to mingle, signifies thoroughly mingled; 
_indiscriminate,_ from the Latin _in_ privative and _discrimen_ 
a difference, signifies without any difference.
 _Promiscuous_ is applied to any number of different objects 
07 together;

 Victors and vanquish'd join _promiscuous_ cries.

- Pope

_Indiscriminate_ is only applied to the action in which one does 
not discriminate different objects: a multitude is termed 
_promiscuous,_ as characterizing the thing; the use of different 
things for the same purpose, or of the same things for different 
purposes is termed _indiscriminate,_ as characterizing the 
person: things become _promiscuous_ by the want of design in any 
one: they are _indiscriminate_ by the fault of any one: plants 
of all descriptions are to be found _promiscuously_ situated in 
the beds of a garden: it is folly to level any charge 
_indiscrimately_ against all the members of any community or 
profession; 'From this _indiscriminate_ distribution of misery, 
moralists have always derived one of their strongest moral 
arguments for a future state.' - Johnson.

- from George Crabb, English Synonymes, A New Edition Enlarged, 
Harper, NY, 1830.

Pappenheimer's Incredible Beauties!

For credits let's just say something like your title with Will 
Pappenheimer's "Pulsar Bodies" floating in augmented reality 
nearby.

Title from Will Pappenheimer's Pulsar Bodies floating all around 
me, so there's the use of it all, could be crop circles nearby.

Not sure I mentioned it.

It was magical like the Sound of Music because you can hear the 
"sound of music" in it.

Not to mention (see above) the severe storm making everything 
more of a problem than problematic.

We reserved ourselves for "the exploit."

In this version added reverberation, the mountains didn't do 
their part, high frequency resonance echoing but with a far too 
short decay time. Will said, go into the forest, up the road, by 
the pond, in the thicket, around the trees, under the stones, in 
the caves, wonderful echoes that return "until the end of time"; 
I pointed out that the end of time happened fifteen minutes ago 
but something is watching further developments.

comments welcome, please be kind. :-(

Thanks, Alan

(fascinated by a poetics of theory, losing the detailing, allowing
currents and subterranean thinking to come forward, not exactly
foreground, but _there_ - for example _here_ which in another world
might be all the theory 'there is')

intro . my work dealing with the ineffable: how are 'real' 
'virtual' entangled? -- no difference, culture all way down. 'we 
avatars must die.' body has always been virtual. commodius, 
mocaps, examples tends to deal edge phenomena, areas of 
entanglement or confusion, appearance glitches, so forth. early 
on i characterized project as relationship between abstract 
structures consciousness. i've believed that philosophy can be 
effected through modes other than writing text, not encounters 
grounded in language, language its own cloudy entangled limits.
