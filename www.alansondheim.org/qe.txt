now we are living all alone
and we're alive and close to bone
everything's dark when we cuddle down
and sloping hide and crawling round
and woosh woosh woosh an amazing astound
and space and time have tossed their ground
i sing for them i shake and moan
for we are living all alone

yonialetsch


from the glacier of the throbbing landscape when i returned
i knew i comprehended the Subtle melting of Technologies

tottering and wobbling, teetering and shuddering
where are the grounds and levels of fields of play, sex, and war

pulled carts and midday heat on down the dusty road
already the shadows burrow, bury rumors of historiography

tongue of the glacier throbs, hustles, retreats
midday heat drags the sex out of everything

mouth filled with ice and travails of steam
caressing tongue, tipped skin, marshland landscape toppling

oh where have you gone with everything
and when are you coming with everything

oh when are you coming with everything
and where have you gone and where have you gone

The emergent flug
always comes out in forms like these
but I refuse
to write a poem about it
about it
about 
it

[15:55] Alan Dojoji: Julu this is an experiment. No one loves us any more 
in the real world. I saw it in their eyes on the subway. Do you know the 
subway?

[15:56] Alan Dojoji: Why do I keep coming up with blanks and they are yes 
the color of your eyes. You do not need to answer. I am learning the 
meaning of malaise, languor, ennui, lassitude, out of sheer exhaustion.

[16:04] Alan Dojoji: So clean and so pure, Julu, and so very little to 
say. Do you think, perhaps you think, debris,, perhaps it is debris, 
perhaps that makes all the difference, there are grains everywhere of 
everything. Welcome, I am back after break.

[16:05] Alan Dojoji: When you are here, I am not here, when you are not

is no longer there, how vulnerable is the world, there are no redrawn 
regions, only slaughterhouse boundaries...

what we are seeing is absolutely not real, and what is absolutely 
 not real is what is seen.
all physical labor is mental labor and all mental labor is physical 
 labor.
the network of who we are is absolutely not real, and what is
 absolutely not real is the network of who we are.
the network is processed labor and processed labor is the network.
we're all clowns, show me a thing, we're all things, show me a clown.
all questions are local questions grounded in debris, and debris
 is the ground of all questions.
all universal questions are inconceivable, and all inconceivable 
 questions are universal.
everything else is a waste of time and a waste of time is everything
 else.
forget the local, drown in the universal, forget the universal, drown
 the local.
forget the world to better it, better the world to forget it.
every sentence collapses, every collapse is sentenced.
the crossed aphorism is the aphorism crossed.



hegelung slow meditation with traffic


http://www.alansondheim.org/meditate1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/meditate3.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/meditate2.mp3

sometimes playing slowly (meditate 1/2) calms everything, somethings 
playing faster (meditate 3) overrides all delicacy. the hegelung is my 
shakuhachi, easier though, the strings are fretted in so many ways. 
traffic interferes with everything; listen to these on small computer 
speakers or be subjected to noise pollution emanating from one of the 
busier intersections in brooklyn. someday i will sleep the long sleep; 
until then, traffic keeps me going, hegelung keeps me going back.

,the next morning yakub maguan and fingguy flang, on hegelung, performed 
on a floating bamboo platform--part of the resorts messwerterfassung, 
messwertverarbeitung, hegelung vortrge, gehalten anlasslich der achema 
,ausstellungstagung fr chemisches record is the first dedicated to the 
hegelung lute, then, we have here the opportunity to hear the hegelung 
lute played by two musicians who have i was able (more or less) to repair 
the philippine boat lute, which most likely is a tboli hegelung. i added 
three frets and a true maria fe and luming are probably the two best 
players of hegelung in the village of dekolon, the main tboli community 
around the sebu lake, tboli gong chimes klintang, hanging gongs blowon, 
drum tnonggong, boat lute hegelung, jaws harp kumbing, singing and danc-

==============================================================


* Political Divisions


The sultry clime of Africa
 In fancy now we reach;
Its chief divisions we review,
 And capital of each.

Morocco, by Morocco ruled,
  First in the list appears;
Algiers we next in order name,
 Its capital Algiers.

Tunis, with Tunis its chief town,
 Is next upon the roll;
And Tripoli succeeds, which bows
 To Tripoli's control.

Then Barca see, and Der'ne Town
 As first in size it rates;
Next comes a region dry and parch'd
 But call'd "the Land of Dates."

Egypt succeeds,--its ruling town
 Is Cairo on the Nile;
Nubia's next, its capital
 New Dongola we style.

And now of Abyssinia, 
 By Gondar ruled, we tell;
South-eastwardly we then proceed,
 In journeying to Adel'.

Ajan' and Berbera we pass,
 And Zanguebar we seek;
See, with its namesake capital,
 The land of Mozambique.

Monomotapa, with its town
 Zimbao, let us view;
Cazembe next, its capital
 Is called Cazembe too.

Caffraria note, and with its rule
 Port Natal let us crown;
And then Cape Colony behold,
 Its capital, Cape Town.

Then Boshuanas let us note,
 South-west of which we place
The country of the Hottentots;
 And next Cimbebas trace.

And now, in Lower Guinea's bounds,
 Benguela we comprise;
Angola, Congo, there are seen,
 And there Loango lies.

Benguela's town of largest size,
 St. Felipe we may call;
Thy capital, Angola, then
 We briefly name St. Paul.

But Congo's seat of government,
 St. Salvador we name;
Loango mark, its capital
 In title is the same.

In grounds by Upper Guinea claim'd
 Benin' we first review;
There Dah'omay more central lies,
 There place Ashan'tee too.

Benin', where Niger's mouths expand,
 A namesake town obeys;
From thence to Dahomay' we come,
 Whose rule is Abomey's'.

Ashantee is our next resort,
 Coomassie rules that land
But o'er Liberia's colonies,
 Monrovia takes command.

Sierre Leo'ne with its rule
 Has sickly Freetown graced;
But Senegambia at Timboo
 Its government has placed.

Upon Sahara's sandy waste,
 A moment let us look;
Then seek the region of Fezzan,
 Its capital Moorzook.

Within the limits of Soodan
 Are numerous kingdoms found;
At Kaarta glance, and there Kemmoo
 With regency is crown'd.

Bambarra, ruled by Sego, now
 Presents itself to view;
Timbuctoo next, its capital
 Is call'd Timbuctoo, too.

Then Houssa comes,--there Saccatoo
 The government sustains; 
Note Yariba, and Eyeo there
 O'errules the parch'd domains.

Bornoo, where Kooka takes the rule
 Is Afric's central ground;
And then Bergoo, by Wara ruled,
 More eastwardly is found.

Darfoor, still farther to the east,
 Will Cobbe's rule confess;
The right to govern Kordofan
 Obeid shall possess.

And last to Ethiopia
 A stanza we afford;
Mysterious region, undefined,
 Vast, trackless, unexplor'd.

Dying


"The worst part about dying is the absolute, eternal, perfect lack of 
trope or symptom; whatever occurs is lost to subjectivity forever - as is 
the maelstrom itself. The simplest occurrence - a record set at a tennis 
match or a summer storm - is characterized by an inconceivable disappear- 
ance, and nothing occurs in collusion with occurrence, process, presence. 
Or if the subject on some untoward plane still bears witness, that witness 
no longer inheres, and subjectivity is permanently lost to itself. We 
mourn this loss when we are alive; when dead, we inhabit it." - Lyotard

To comment about the nature of the spring drum drum a bit to talk about 
the idea that the drum number of art music of our own has a voice is very 
deep and soulful. Classic is played with the attitude to listen, not 
satisfaction with the integration of many instrument is perfect in the 
strict in itself orchestra. That has emerged from spring drum drum such an 
instrument. As timbre and harmony, and all the talent all the beauty of 
inheritance received is available in the springy drum to fall out. When 
compared with a new drum drum spring rush is extremely. And according to 
my views of the music in the classical style is more full seen a rush. 
Sound is a sound and style as a great many in the name of drum is held in 
spring drum engaged, very deeply emotional and harmonious. Do I play for 
hours without ever bored. Sound is not a clone of the color is completely 
unique and sound field of a human are very close. In addition to this rule 
is a structure that is difficult even from the drum.

Spring brings the drum today with mercy to meet with not too much I have 
appreciated. The classic style of the spring drum is a goal, because this 
instrument deserves.

One-string music


Three of my string instruments are played on one string only:

The hegelung, which has frets and two strings - drone and melody; the 
hasapi, which has no frets two strings - drone and melody; and the yayli 
tanbur, which has frets and six strings in three courses - drone, drone, 
and melody.

The first two are plucked or strummed; the last is usually bowed.

It's far too simple to play these as mountain dulcimers; the music is far 
more complex in general. Grace-notes, harmonics, hammering and pulling, 
and with the hegelung, situating the finger in different areas behind the 
frets - all serve to create a wide variety of effects. On the tanbur, 
different bowing techniques are used in combination with grace-notes, 
harmonics, hammering and pulling, and occasional bowing of the drone 
strings.

One-string playing is pleasing, since the string acts as a one-dimensional 
object with a singular timbre that slowly changes up and down its length. 
More than one string creates a two-dimensional field - possibilities are 
extended, but the sublime appears as a greater construct, separated from 
the sound itself. One-string also uses different muscles - finger, wrist, 
and arm for example - since pitch changes are more often accompanied by 
large-scale body changes.

On the yayli tanbur, the range is well over two octaves, perhaps three; 
the hegelung is slightly over an octave, and the hasapi is variable but 
best played within the hegelung range (both are boat-lutes).

To play a single string is to play a universe of fundamental theory with 
innumerable images emanating from a model which almost disappears in its 
'purity.' Purity results in embellishment, ornament, creating object- 
processes flying from the string. The playing is a meditating and drones 
ensure its connectivity or networking to other playings and universes.

The playing is a meditating on model, on inhabiting a model, on model as 
habitus. Melody and rhythm are 'there,' harmony is a memory: A memory of 
harmonies elsewhere (synchronic), and a memory of single-string notes 
hinting at the collapse of individuals (diachronic) - never quite bring- 
ing either to the foreground.

Therefore a model of models, models with and without memory, pure and 
impure ('dirty,' 'noisy') models, models under erasure, models within and 
without consciousness and the consciousness of erasure. To play single- 
string is to participate in habitus and becoming. Every playing string has 
a beginning and an end (or length, if one might imagine a wrapped string); 
every string announces, enunciates, its appearance and separation within 
the world: Every string _inheres._

The string is a dancing (just as a keyboard is a dancing) - moving every- 
where upon or around it, while at the same time letting it speak to its 
own devices. And what are these devices, if not the coupling of the string 
to fretboard, soundboard, hollow, materiality, frettage and/or stopping? 
The string always speaks the world, just as one end speaks _a-_ and the 
other _um_. All of us are listening as we are playing to the dual singu- 
larities of sound, birth and death, and their irrevocability - what's said 
and born can never be taken back.

Alan Sondheim: The Drawing Un/Center/Ed


An exhibition of graphics from 3d modeling transformations and other
sources at:

Millennium Gallery, 66 East 4th St., New York

June 20, 2009 - July 31, 2009, and probably September, 2009

Monday - Wednesday and Friday evenings 7-10:30 pm
Saturday 1-5 pm

"Each of the prints here is unique; each is the result of print, print 
error, borderline and uncontrollable phenomena. Most of them originate 
from work done with the aid of Poser and other 3d modeling programs. The 
mannequins represent snapshots of distorted dynamic movement, movements 
real bodies in real spaces could never do, unless constrained by torture, 
dismemberment, fantasm, sexuality, or (other) uncomfortable elements 
within the imaginary - bridging the real, ascending, descending. I see 
every print as an entire world; if it doesn't work alone, it won't work in 
conjunction. I also see them as ruins - of fragile-analogic bodies, of the 
digital world, of memory. Ruins are fascinating; no matter how minimal, 
there always seems to be enough there, never enough there, never there."

- Alan Sondheim, 6/16/09

"The word prolific always comes to mind when describing Alan Sondheim, who 
has produced an unending, constantly changing array of media works, writ- 
ings, and musical pieces; and has given innumerable workshops and lectures 
around the world. He has been a regular participant in the Personal Cinema 
Series."

decho, when the floor disappears

when the floor disappears
everything moves so fast there's nothing left for sadness
by which i mean no time, no space, no space-time; a furious
pace quickens the heart and cosmos. try as we might, we can't
echo the boy or even find him in maelstroms. a robin might skip
across an arctic path, but we're not there. once we heard rabbits,
mating, all sorts of sounds and strange midnight-ritual, one
jumping over the other, jumping over the one. i'd never seen this
dance before, but there it was. the wonder overcomes us, we are
the smallest of the world, and when the floor disappears, when
the floor disappears, we're not even breathing.

from she things


she things originated with a seed text which was then subject to three 
mathematical transformations; these constituted the final text. the seed 
text was erased.

the following text is a partial reconstruction of the seed text, created 
by eliminating all repetition. the first part is a variation of the seed 
text, more or less paralleling the original; the second part consists of 
strings missing the letter 't' (the trigger for the program string divi- 
sion in a second program), and again repetition is eliminated. the second 
part corresponds to the second part of she things, and only those strings 
which don't appear under other guise in the first part are included. thus 
both texts are expansions and contractions - the first attending to the 
natural inclination to separate words, and the second according to a 
sifting based on 't.'

there are issues of hermeneutics, intention and body, delineated in the 
following; on one hand there are applied matheses across a presumed orig- 
inary moment, and on the other, that moment disappears behind an event 
horizon that retains information but obliterates any final rendering. (
(i recognize that 'event horizon' is stretching a metaphor here; i think 
of this as a filling out of a broken diegesis which is necessarily 
thwarted by formal operations.)


these she things. came out of the room furious at me, talking wildly, 
saying things i never imagined or invented. grasped my legs with hers and 
we toppled onto bed. there was no turning back. outside a tremendous

early universe. on single-string instrument played gluon, quark

Notes on the Aetiology and Phenomenology of Magic


(for a course at School of Visual Arts this fall.)


EARLY outline, then a few LATE statements -

Jung: Synchronicity http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity
 Bell's Theorem - action at a distance

Empathetic Magic:
 Inhabiting the fetish
  subject inhabiting (user)
  fetish inhabiting the subject
  object/subject inhabiting (animal/spirit)

 Parallel structures
  Physical parallelism (parameters)
  Memory parallelism (punctum) (not sure what I meant here)
  Personal parallelism (introjection/projection)
entering/entraining

Semiotics of Magic:

 Immersive/definable hierarchies: hierarchies of data, of experience:
  analog and digital hierarchies

 Parallelism/Anti-parallelism
  Antiparallelism: dual - i.e. becomes the same through difference,
   perhaps becomes different through the same (vampire, the uncanny)

 Creation/Annihilation (to and from zero / virtual particles)

 Transitive/Intransitive actions - A done to B by virtue of C, 
  i.e. _through_ C. C = channel; incantation = parasitic communication.

 Resonances and recursions
  A _signal_ as a resonant _symbol_: no time to stand for anything!

Performativity:
        k8% date
        Fri Jul 10 21:38:59 EDT 2009
  action _at a distance_
        sleep command -
  action at a _temporal distance_ (interval)
   think of field phenomena
   wave/particle dualities
  computer programming:
   what is the ontology of information?
   how is information transformed within the machine?
    machine states / entropy
   - in opposition to a materialist approach

  (recursive):
   the phenomenology of magic: (not sure what I meant here)
   the operations of the fetish: the fetish through the fetish

==========================

LATE STATEMENTS -

Start over. Some operations:

Empathy - inhabitation of the other / dwelling.

Sympathy - exteriority and identification with the other / living

Correspondence: metaphoricity, metonymy. 

And let's think about the _symptom,_ the _trope,_ while we're at it.
Doesn't the trope and symptom depend on regularization? What constitutes 
the system from which they devolve?
With the symptom: Already a _standard_ is at work: symptoms deviate.

See below:

Some formal operations:

Resemblance: 

Think of the following characteristics of operators:

 Reflexivity - X can resemble itself; all magic is reflexive, resonates. 
Think of the reflexivity of magic in terms of cybernetics with positive or 
negative feedback loops. Combine positive feedback loops with a fold 
catastrophe; pass a threshold and the thing is done.

 Transitivity - if X resembles Y, and Y, Z, X need not resemble Z: 
a kind of fuzzy logic dominates, things are always already lost along the 
way. Attributes disappear.

 Commutativity: if X resembles Y, need Y resemble X? Think - 
  If a mandrake resembles a man, does a man resemble a mandrake?
   - not necessarily, there's an economic of surplus at work here
   (think Bataille). (This is slightly different, in any case, from
   formal commutativity.)

Think of resemblance as _broken equivalence_ - therefore within and 
 without the _abject._

Is there a difference between resemblance and correspondence?

If A corresponds to B, does A resemble B, B resemble A?
 Think of corresponds as co-responds, therefore to a kind of _call._

In terms of an overarching structure, one might argue that if and only if 
A is called, B is called, and vice versa, then the resemblance becomes an 
equivalence 'under' the overarching structure.

How do markov chains fit in? Typifications, type mathematics, standardiza- 
tions, dimensional analysis?

Think of onomatopoeia, mimickry - how, if at all, do these tally with 
'action at a distance'? Neither empathy nor sympathy, but formal equival- 
ence within bounds. 

Think of interjections and the use of phonemes not ordinarily found in the 
spoken language: non-equivalence, performativity simultaneously within and 
without language. (See Roazen, Echolalia.)

Then religion - what sort of interiority, susceptibility, is required?
The necessary entanglement of 'spirituality' and 'magic.'

One signifier out of place and science either expands or collapses.

3161.8*1.5 4742.7 4742.7*1.5 7114.0

Therefore powers of 2 = integer, 7114.0, after sufficient steps.
