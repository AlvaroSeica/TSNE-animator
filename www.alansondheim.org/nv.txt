did i say dissemination? darwin's dis/ease. i'm too smart, too aware i'm 
writing just to continue, assert presence, inscribe. place my mark like 
every other smart little boy and girl. graffiti the indefinite walls of 
cyberspace. what i say is irrelevant. it's all in the action, spraying 
this, that, every other site, building up recognition capital on google.

i want to escape my genes. i can't meditate for more than thirty seconds. 
my shakuhachi playing lasts a couple of minutes and i'm on to something 
else. i have to leave my mark everywhere. i recognize the compulsion. i 
write about the compulsion and against the compulsion. 

i'd like to see bush dead. his compulsion ruins the world. i see my ugly 
face reflected in his ugly face. i scrawl here; he scrawls there. i scrawl 
virtual; he scrawls real. maybe he even thinks about it.

if i don't spray nightly, i'm lost. my body turns against me; my dreams 
become nightmares worse than usual, endless, vicious. the flesh deflates, 
potency gone; the mind evaporates. i'm aware of the illness. i can 
deconstruct the illness. i can work through it and the illness is at the 
other end.

the illness is our illness. 

contrary to belief, there are no borders to the blog, just boarders. there 
are borders on the list. one comes up against another. one response is 
always out of control of the other. list territory is psychological 
territory, a wager. it is a wager of the real, not of the virtual, but in 
the virtual.

it is useless at this end, my end. every publication is another brick, 
another ward against death. the recordings, books, videos, anthologies, 
magazines, tapes, dvds, cdroms, pile up like debris. i look on one side 
and see nothing. i look over to the other side; there's nothing there.

there's the urge and it pushes. it mixes with wonder which is perhaps its 
excuse or perhaps what's left of a humanity i want to hold to. but the 
urge is a sickness, the sickness of a mad species, a mad specimen, the 
madness of the obsessive individual. write or die.

years ago i had up on the wall: i write myself into existence. i write 
myself out of existence. the inscription is all there is. the inscription 
gives me the fairy-tale, the fantasy, fantasm, imaginary, image, of 
survival after death. of promulgation ad infinitum. of gene-pools no 
longer at the mercy of the flesh. 

this is my politics. it is probably everyone's. we take positions, 
backwards and forwards, of withdrawal as well. meditation is a position as 
rigid as others. we hold to them. we work with them, work towards them. 
we're genetically driven. we're tagging everything in site. we're tagging 
everyone and every other. we're tagging the planet, we're sprawl/scrawl.

there's false joy in this. i'm aware of the falseness, crash constantly. i 
write another, yet another piece. 'artist' is an excuse for tagging of 
every kind, out of control, unstructured, desperate. tagging is an excuse 
for inscription, leaving genetic debris, named or anonymous, but always 
named, everywhere in sight, in site, in cite. the wonder follows, fallow.

bush kills, bushwhacks. we are responsible for millions of tiny murders, 
day by day. powerless, we do the same. every letter is a violence, 
occupies space, defends itself, within and without spell-check. it's the 
urge. i know it and can't fight it. we're talking, scrawling, unto death. 

the light that can be seen and can't be named: the brain shutting down, 
just before everything goes black. we'll all be there, emptied out. we're 
gone before we started.

what i remember

jodee talking about having a child and she would not want to hurt it and 
wouldn't hurt it and it would love her and she would love it.
banging my body into my body symmetrically and naked, talking hysteria.
diseased and gynecological closeups jumping off the digital/analog page, 
as if in a row of equivalences.
constant crossings of the border beneath the bridge where the river 
divided the nations and there was also the possibility of gangs, bullets, 
and gold.
jodee pouring water in my ear, frantic laughter, tied up and no one cared.
lack of caring crashing the body against itself repeatedly as below.
as below, so above.
dental plans not offered at the maquiladora manufacturing wheelchairs.
the song of the little boys and little girls against the abstracted 
backdrop of transformed feedback continents pulsing and en-tranced.
touching kathy acker wrong and furious at collapsing walls.
emily cheng leaning back tired and talking it was normal.
then of the colonias unbounded, electric dragged from the wires with 
wires, water trucks churning through the mud, shortwave spy stations uno 
uno tres quatro tres.
hating memories, baiting and breaking tapes into rearrangement tapes and 
the extreme angle screaming for doctor doctor in sinecure display.
proc amp configurations, ntsc safety zones, colorbars and waveform 
monitors, watching the splayed and self-loathed body repeatedly crash.
the crawl and scrawl of it.
the sprawl.

Freedom's just another word for some place to abuse.

I can't stand it at this point. This is rant. I'm sick and tired of 
debates. I'm sick and tired of hair-splitting. I find myself hating the 
word 'Christian' and everything it stands for. We Jews should have killed 
ourselves off; instead, we channeled virulent monotheisms of all stripes, 
holocausts without number. We let others do it and do it to us. We do it 
to ourselves and others. I hate the word 'pro-life' and everything it 
stands for - while children around the world are starving and it's going 
to get worse. I'm tired of reasoning against the monolith. Most of all I 
hate the word 'freedom' which is a dirty word for everything we want to do 
around the world. 'Freedom fries'? You bet - it exposes our intolerance of 
anyone daring to disagree with us.

I've been using the word 'fascism' recently; I've always avoided it the 
past. I see our situation similar to Karl Kraus' - including the weakening 
of the dollar, new levels of mass communication and discourse networks, 
silent organizations of disparate groups like the Freikorps into a 
right-wing mass. Don't take it seriously! Satire works wonders. I find 
Bush a blunt ideologue, one whose violence will ultimately take the world 
down. If not Bush, someone else, but the guise is the same, and as mass 
communications and populations increase, others equally or far more 
violent will come along. Fundamentalisms of all sorts can only take over 
in a world of such leaky information flow that the poor are sent to the 
Pale, unrepresented, polluted. If I were Pale-poor I would join my masters 
to fight their masters. O the righteous fight.

Simulacra return with a vengeance in the face of weapons of mass 
destruction - and you know what? These weapons smash ontology in the face. 
No longer the world of everyday things - but the world of silent, 
invisible, and absent killers, hidden regimes of information, nuclear and 
other radiations, invisible viral plagues - all plasma, seepage - what 
I've been on about for years. Give me a medal.

I can't master my hatred. I turn it against myself. It's so good for you. 
I'm harmless. I'll eat my own flesh. But let me ask you: If you could kill 
a world leader - without repercussion - anyone you found criminal or 
ultra-violent, a Bin Laden or Hussein - if you could do this without any 
recrimination, as if by magic, would you? Would you pray for the death of 
a criminal if you believed in prayer?

If a criminal and a leader were one and they were prayed to death, I sure 
wouldn't want to make an example of them because then we'd have another 
Christ to contend with. One, two, a million, Christs, Meshiachs, Messiahs, 
Holinesses, grave-diggers, grave-robbers, undead all. Deliverance of 
kindness ends up at the wrong end of a gun.

The Christ of the sermon-mount has all but disappeared. Whatever happened 
to liberation theology? Marx and decon are now dirty words and sooner or 
later someone will bring up Jew Derrida, Jew Levi-Strauss, all those 
intellectuals, and the problems they made for Jew-Marx, Lyotard, 
Heidegger, all those others. Return of the killers, killers back at you. 
We're there waiting for them. We'll contribute with the book, one, two, a 
million books. We'll theorize them to hell and back. We'll show them. 
We'll show them pictures.

We'll talk that forbidden subject, biology. We'll ignore the hatreds, 
poisons, in our systems, our genetic cess-pools, our desire repeatedly to 
bring the world down around us for a filthy grasp at heaven. We'll stab 
science in the back as intelligence creationism and arguments about 
life-tissue send the world environment teetering towards extinction of 
pretty much everything around us. Not much time till armageddon (without 
capital), slow and dirty.

You can't argue with biology, man. You can't argue with biology, baby.

Who twists our necks? 
We twist our necks.
Who twists our necks?
We twist our necks.

Freedom's just another word for someone to abuse.

Please read, Abstention

I apologize for this note, but feel it's necessary. I've been carrying around 
too much anger recently; this is also true of most of my offline friends. Anger 
leads to despair, disgust, internal violence. I'm not good at meditating and/or 
drugs; my outlets are my work and of course discourse online. But the latter 
has become increasingly acerbic on my part, for no reason, especially among 
people I respect. I feel I should abstain from discussion at this point; I'm 
too out of control. Unfortunately for those of you who find my work spam, I'll 
continue to send it out. But beyond that, I'll try silence as much as possible.

The election of Bush, our personal lack of money, my own lack of a future in 
the job market (equivalent to a very real lack of a future), all of these 
things weigh - not to mention constant insomnia, headaches, stress, problems 
with my family. I've been going through the roof, getting up in tears in the 
morning. It's not fair to Azure, and not to myself for that matter, although I 
don't know how to stop it. But at least I don't need to inflict myself on 
people here, online.

I try to keep the rage and despair out of my work. I've been looking at
older work over the past few days, and it feels suicidal. It's hard to
face, but I'm trying to put at least some of it on DVDs, out of
deteriorating VHS, 8mm, and Hi8mm tapes. The sound pops out, tracking is
lost, and all the usual shifts are occurring that happen in analog. In any
case, I'm dismayed at the self-loathing within a number of them, and
trying to come to grips with that.

For the rest, I feel my work is on course as usual, whatever that may be.
But I've noted my too-fast responses online - and that serves no useful
purpose, for you or for myself.

I hope to be back in discussion mode soon and please don't take this the
wrong way, whatever that might be.

- Alan

http://www.asondheim.org/wtc2.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/wtc3.jpg

images modified from database but the shadows are there, too dark to be 
real, too ominous, of older materials, satellites and aeroships doing 
their work.

of reworking, inteference, as if to make them my own, invisible and 
impossible copyright materials i would assume.

but of interest for screen saver, and thinking-piece.

then of course updating of kiev.mov at both sites:

http://www.asondheim.org/kiev.mov
http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/Members/sondheim/kiev.mov

something to think about and it is still happening. 

question for study, what do we see?

why did the elephant pack a trunk? because his nose was broken.
past all acceleration the hyperaccelerator brings particles to fruition.
why was the giraffe a foot? because he was looking for food.
why did the pangolin weigh himself? because he carried his own scales.
why did the beetle play guitar? because she was one of the beatles.
why did the swordfish dual? because there were two of them.
why did the bullfrog die? because he croaked.
why did the flamingo have a leg up on the competition? because she 
couldn't stand it. why didn't the cricket play baseball? because he 
played cricket. why wasn't the horse blind? because she was a sea-horse.
why did the ant attack the grasshopper? so he would cry uncle.

why was the kaon manic-depressive? because she broke the laws of symmetry.

the big explosion

you will know the big explosion because you won't hear from me again.
but you won't be looking, will you? you'll be busy with other things.
or you won't be able to see or hear and i'd be the last thing on your 
 mind.
why am i saying this? so you'll remember now, something else to forget
 when the big explosion comes.
you've already forgotten this, haven't you?
perhaps the big explosion has already come.

i will find some of you there.
i am poison jew. arab-hating jew.
i kill christians. i kill christ.
i spit on your children.
i slaughter your children.
the world is all about me:
 1. it surrounds me.
 2. read the protocols of zion.
israel should be destroyed utterly.
the united states should be destroyed utterly.
i am poison proud zionist. 
i will take you with me.
i believe in god. 
arabs smell like the jews smell.
you can't clean a semite off a semite.
the best you can do is give it a gun.
jews are the worst people of all.
it is our secret how bad we are.
we whisper it to each other.
jews kill children and old people.
they didn't like to waste their bullets they said.
it is my sickness to be a jew. 
i should be destroyed.
it is better to kill than to think. 
it is better to kill quickly.
jews have that thing about them. 
you know what it is.
it's whispered we will bring the world down with us.
today is the first night of chanukah and we are bent on destruction.
i announce it proudly: we will destroy you all.

Recent books, emphasis on computers, philosophy


I am still reviewing books that O'Reilly sends me. The arrangement is 
ideal; I'm under no obligation to like the books - on the other hand, I 
don't ask to review books that are outside my field of interest, and
what I do find is often of interest. Many of the ones that have come in 
recently will be of value to new media artists interested in expanding
either their internal computer environment, or the external potential 
for controlled installations made somewhat on the fly.

Here are the recent entrants, in no particular order; the computer books 
come first, since I'm feeling utilitarian at the moment. (Sudden fear: Is 
that the right word?) 

PC Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Jim Aspinwall, O'Reilly. 
Okay, this one really _is_ industrial, and I'd recommend making the hacks 
first on an older machine. That said, this digs deeper into the bios, 
memory, etc. than other books I've seen. I want to eventually create a 
pseudo-lan machine for installations and presentations - and this book 
would be of considerable value, since I can start and modify from the 
ground up, not losing too much in the process. There's terrific 
information on heat sinks, cpu speedups, video, etc. 

By the way, why do any of this? Because one can tailor a machine to his or 
her specs - which can be critical, for example, for laptop performance, 
heavy video processing, muxing, what have you. For this reason, I also 
want to recommend the ExtremeTech series of books from Wiley - the one I'm 
using - which, again, is highly detailed, is

Hacking Windows XP, Steve Cinshak, Wiley. Like the first book, this is 
$24.99 - it was marked down 40% at Barnes and Noble. The book deals a lot 
with bootup speeds and configurations, speeding up the boot screen, making 
the computer more responsive, increasing speed, etc. Some of the info is 
found in a number of other books; here, it's extremely detailed, and I've 
had no problem applying things to my WinXP multimedia machine. 

Spam Kings, O'Reilly, Brian McWilliams. I said that I probably could not 
review this, since it doesn't cover things like the 'nigerian' spams. They 
sent it anyway. I must say the book is astounding in the weirdness it 
uncovers, and in the apparent messiness of spam history. At times spam 
fighters change sides, or work both against - what? It's like a paean to 
postmodernity. Individual histories, identities, spam offers, ISPs, etc., 
are changed at the drop of a hat; there are prosecutions, but they're 
somewhat ineffective. The book shows, guess what, that Bush's spam law is 
basically useless. I'd try to find this on Amazon. It's hardbound $22.95, 
and is one of the books I'll pass on - a terrific read, but no reason to 
return to it.

Smart Home Hacks, Tips & Tools for Automating Your House, Gordon Meyer, 
O'Reilly. Well, this is fantastic for someone with a smart home; ours is 
particularly dumb, without a tv remote, and many kludged computer 
thingies. But I will end up using this book constantly - since the hacks, 
which cover things that go on with movement change, light change, 
temperature change, logic change, etc. etc., are cheap, and applicable to 
art installations of all sorts. If you have a real hardware techie to work 
with, you probably won't need this - but I do. Next year, I hope to hook 
some of these things up with motion capture, and then... Anyway, this book 
is already proving indispensable - if you do any sort of digital media 
work and you want potentially cheap fixes, take a look.

Degunking Your Email, Spam, and Viruses, Jeff Duntemann, Paraglyph. This, 
and similar books, are invaluable if you use Outlook or Eudora or any mail 
program that involves downloading; I haven't needed it, since I use unix 
(which on a practical level, is incredibly configurable, eliminates a 
whole lot of spam/virus problems, etc.). But I wanted to see this, since I 
help people with computers on a fairly regular basis, and this is to be 
recommended for a mid-level user who wants to streamline and clean up his 
or her Net connections. It talks about 'strategy' which I like a lot - not 
assuming that all email users are the same, and emphasizing knowledge 
management from the Inbox on. I might add that a small business owner 
would use this to advantage. On the other hand, if you don't use a 
download program, and/or don't have much spam (this is useful for people 
using Yahoo etc. who are filtering), then this isn't really necessary.
Good chapters by the way on viruses, worms, trojans, and other critters.

Game Console Hacking, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, Atari, & Gamepark 32, 
Joe Grand (with Frank Thornton, Albert Yarusso), Syngress. The back says 
"Have Fun While Voiding Your Warranty." I wanted to see this, partly out 
of curiosity (it was offered to me via O'Reilly), and partly out of a real 
desire to take a console apart (again, a project put off for a few 
months). You can find some of this stuff at the Salvation Army, not to 
mention E-Bay, and the very idea of making an Atari 2600PC is really 
appealing. You've already get head-starts with some of the components, 
including case, possibly the power-supply, switches, etc. If you have a 
kid into gaming and soldering, this is a book for him or her. There's good 
stuff, by the way, for digital artists on homebrew game development with 
various platforms.

Building the Perfect PC, Thompson & Thompson, O'Reilly. Yes, a section on 
a 'kick-ass LAN party PC,' among others. The guide has color illustrations 
which are the clearest I've ever seen. I haven't yet built a PC from the 
ground up, but have obviously changed components 'and stuff.' But this 
will allow me to decide, first, on one sort of machine I want, and second, 
how to go about a strategy of construction. The machines range from high- 
performance servers through multi-media machines.

A lot of these books reflect, for me, a lack of community; almost all my 
cultural connections are now online, and in the 'real world,' I'm not 
connected with any institution. There's no tech person in my environment, 
no one gaming, no hackers, etc. So the books serve a very useful function 
- guides to a kind of communal knowledge otherwise unavailable. This goes 
for the pc and console mod books, even the smart home hacking one. 

Windows XP Power Hound, Preston Gralla, Pogue/O'Reilly. This book is 
slightly 'below' Hacking Windows XP (the Wiley one) and PC Hacks. If you 
purchase any of these, you should decide on what you're doing. I knew the 
material in the Power Hound work, and had already applied most of the 
stuff (for example TweakUI) to my machine. On the other hand, if you are 
just using WinXP, this is definitely the work for you. What you spend on 
this stuff will honestly come back to you in increased productivity. I 
know this sounds idiotic, but it's amazing how highly responsive machines 
will lower your stress level - or direct it in more productive directions. 
This book as well as Hacking Windows XP, by the way, emphasize benchmarks 
and their use.

What I'm basically saying, for better or worse - and this goes for Mac 
users as well - most people, even most digital artists I know, take their 
machines and form factors for granted. What's there is there, just throw 
some more RAM in, and that's all. When I work them them, I often find 
'messes' all over the place - and slow machines which freeze fairly often. 
If you're using PCs with WinXP I highly recommend - I can't say this too 
often - that you get one or more of these or similar books...

Representing the Republic: Mapping the United States, 1600-1900, John 
Rennie Short, Reaktion, 2001. I have one of Jedidiah Morse's early 
American geographies, from 1796 (third edition). Morse was critical in the 
construct of American (read USA) identity, early on; this is the nation 
looking at itself after a couple of decades. The implications of Short's 
book go beyond the work, to the configuration of ideology itself at the 
heart of Empire. Morse is, of course only one of the geographers covered, 
but the one of most interest to me. The book is illustrated with numerous 
maps and other images. 

Performance Art, From Futurism to the Present, RoseLee Goldberg, revised 
and enlarged edition, Abrams, 1988. I love this book because of its 
grittiness. I saw an incredible amount of performance in the 70s, and 
participated in some myself. This book covers that era in general, when 
'performance' as a genre didn't exist, and both audience and performer 
(who might for that matter be one and the same) negotiated space and time, 
role and behavior, etc.; nothing could be taken for granted. Performance 
wasn't even a genre in the making; there had been aktions, actions, 
happenings, theatrical 'events,' etc., but nothing particularly fixed. 
What interests me in this material (besides reminiscence) is the centrality 
of the _body_ to the works - a centrality which gets quickly consumed by 
current technohgizmo. Too many works today occur as if concept/ual art and 
performance hadn't existed - it's as if the wheel has to be continually 
reinvented whenever a new mode of distribution comes along. This book only 
begins to cover the ground, by the way - speaking of which, I also picked 
up 

The Writings of Robert Smithson, edited by Nancy Holt, NYU, 1979 - which, 
at this point, everyone interested in new media, digital art, etc. should 
read - not because he precurses, but because he doesn't. There's a 
recapitulation of the earth, dirt, the symbolic within material 
substrates, that's critical - particularly now, when so much of the 
planet's ecosystems are disappearing. This is another way to go, and to go 
edgy, and it would be fascinating to see this approach combined with 
digital work - without, for once, endless discussions of 'mapping.'
- I can't believe how well he _writes._ And from this it's an easy go to

Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching, Second Edition, edited by 
Dave Foreman and Bill Haywood, Forward! by Edward Abbey, 1990. I was in 
Tasmania years ago, and there was an active ecology movement which went 
beyond protest to destruction. I firmly believe in this - what the main- 
stream media calls 'ecoterrorism,' but which seems really the only way to 
stop development. At this point 4 species disappear from the planet - 4 
SPECIES - PER HOUR; almost all of the larger mammals face extinction in 
the wild (if not altogether), etc. I don't see any point in facing 
developers, poachers, etc., peacefully - and this book gives a point by 
point guide to acts of destruction against machinery, home construction, 
and so forth. I might add, while I applaud these acts, I'm by and large a 
coward; I'm afraid of the police, of jail, torture, beatings. All I can do 
is recommend this - like a lot of the other older books, you could find it 
on www.abe.com, or amazon, etc. 

I love the projects of Carnap, Quine, etc., and for this reason, love

Future Pasts, The Analytic Tradition in Twentieth-Century Philosophy, 
edited by Juliet Floyd and Sanford Shieh, Oxford, 2001. This book as a 
prescient series of essays by people like Hintikka (on Ernst Mach), Quine, 
Putnam (on Reichenbach), etc., with an afterword by John Rawls. It's 
wonderful, lively. It covers people like Kripke, Turing, Dewey, Carnap, 
Heidegger (of Being and Time), Husserl, Wittgenstein (Tractatus), etc. I 
love this stuff - the hinge of 19-20-21-century philosophy of math and 
science, both of which are emphasized. It's a good read - I'm particularly 
interested in Carnap's notion of tolerance in relation to mathematical 
foundations/philosophy.

Mi Fu, Style and the Art of Calligraphy in North Song China, Peter Charles 
Sturman, Yale, 1997. I love the complexity and intertwined philosophical/ 
aesthetic strands of traditional calligraphy; Mi Fu was a bit wild and 
brilliant, coming after the Tang crystallization. There are copious 
reproductions in the book, and an explanation in the introduction of the 
principles of calligraphy; you can't get too lost here. I recommend this 
to anyone interested in 'why calligraphy' in the first place; it's also 
excellent on issues (such as style and naturalness) in aesthetics.

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, any one of a number of editions. Weirdly 
makes a LOT of sense, if only humans could live this way. A greater fun to 
read than I would have thought possible. But I do prefer Epictetus, whose 
Enchiridion is a masterpiece of terseness. I have different translations 
but I've been reading Epictetus, Moral Discourses / Enchiridion and 
Fragments, translated by Elizabeth Carter, Everyman, 1910 (1957 reprint). 
I'm sure there are much more accurate versions today, but this book feels 
right, as does the philosophy. 'In our power are opinion, pursuit, desire, 
aversion, and in one word, whatever are our on actions. Not in our power 
are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are 
not our own actions.' The placement of _body_ is critical. It's easy to 
deconstruct this material; it's much more fascinating to read it at 
length, absorb it and its world-view - I never thought stoicism, if such it 
is, could be so enlightening.

I wanted to read a volume of, or drawing on, the Fundamentalism Project, 
and can recommend, highly

Strong Religion, The Rise of Fundamentalisms around the World, Gabriel 
Almond, R. Scott Appleby, and Emmanuel Sivan. I'm just reading this now, 
and hence can't review it at length, but it makes incredible theological 
and socio-cultural sense out of the various fundamentalist movements which 
are increasingly occupying 'our' attention. The book works through various 
schemata among other things - the chapter titles - The Enclave Culture; 
Fundamentalism: Genus and Species; Explaining Fundamentalisms: Structure, 
Chance, and Choice; Wrestling with the World: Fundamentalist Movements as 
Emergent Systems; Testing the Model: Politics, Ethnicity, and 
Fundamentalist Strategies; and The Prospects of Fundamentalism - give a 
sense of the whole. I believe books such as this one are critical in our 
re/thinking contemporary culture and the future of the planet (whatever 
happened to 'God is dead'?). The only thing missing for me is a biological 
explanation of fixity or the fetishization of a particular structure - 
what Ruskin and Stendhal in different contexts called 'crystallization.'
But this is _my_ bias - the belief that any structure which can short- 
circuit self-critique, skepticism, thought itself, actually enhances 
species survival; it's biologically harder to live without God than with 
It. Most of the work I've seen doesn't go this direction, however (Gordon 
Allport touches on it in The Nature of Prejudice, and there have been some 
recent studies which escape me..) -

More later; this is already far too long... (not really, however!) -
