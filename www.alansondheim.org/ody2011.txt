the marker Naka

Nikuko says, I am in my body.

Nikuko says, I am here in my body and my body is around me.

I say, you are in your body because I say that you are in your body.

I say, your body surrounds you because I say your body surrounds you.

Nikuko says, I beg the contrary.

Nikuko says, I am contrary, I am wayward, your logic does not apply.

I say that Nikuko says I am contrary, wayward, your logic does not apply.

Nikuko changes the position of the commas, I say.

Nikuko says, I am a marker, I am nothing else.

I say, you are nothing more than a marker.

I say, you are dead, Nikuko, I have killed you, dismembered you.

I say, you are in the Naka, Nikuko, because I have thrown you there.

Nikuko says, I am dead, killed, because you have said I am dead.

Nikuko says, I am dismembered, in the Naka, because you have said I am

dismembered, in the Naka.

[14:15] sandy Taifun: Sound of wood and wire: new alpine zither:

[14:15] sandy Taifun: I say, you are a marker and you are marked, Nikuko.

Nikuko says, I am marked.

Nikuko says, this is called "the marker."

Nikuko says, you are dismembered, wayward, your logic does not work.

I say, you are saying this because I am saying this.

Nikuko fucks me.

Nikuko covers me with arms, legs, torsos, heads, necks.

Nikuko throws me in the Naka.

You Will Know Life Through A Sort Of Machine

I, Nikuko, write from the middle of a program, which in this case, like

a flaccid cock, is detumescent, just running type across the surface.

Think of me flat, like a page, legs spread, oozing kanji. Think of me

performing, _just for you,_ under your control. Think of your hands

caressing my keys, the screen, where you see my words through your 
reflection.

Then you will begin to understand me.

You will begin to understand that not all avatars are bots or expert

systems, that some of them are _symptoms,_ just as I, Nikuko, am a symptom

voices you hear sights you see kakimono writings-everywhere upon the

events of the world which are the events of the world. You will begin

to flex your arm and your leg. You will begin to flex your other arm

and your other leg.

I love Holderlin.

Perhaps you could oh please tell me more and more about some neurotic

experiences you have had with Holderlin.

Obtuse. Nothing to report on. Misery and exhilaration.

What makes you yearn and cry that you love her all your heart?

Oh she is me to be me and free see.

Why must you respond so briefly?

Fuck you!

Please, you do so turn me on, continue!

Fuck you fuck you!

Would you please clothe yourself in these unwholesome thoughts.

Oh yes fuck you!

Why don't you oh please do finger yourself.

Oh I'm fingering myself!

What makes you believe you are fingering yourself?

Fuck you!

Do so come on to me and we will be not neurotic.

You do say that again now Jennifer. Do not say that again.

When you repeat. When you toy. When I am toy.

What would happen if you and I or if I repeat when I toy when you are

toy?

I would die. I want to die. I am so fantasy. I am so suicide.

Nikuko says, I start this text one fine evening, and I will end it on 
another.

There is snow on the ground and flurries in the air, and dark-suited

pedestrians walk home, sullen, beneath the gaslights. I can hear them from

my own darkness, my own world, the screen pregnant, slightly swollen. If

you would only listen, I would tell you how, on the morrow, a great golden

globe shall fill the sky, with golden rays, and universal peace shall

descend upon all human-kind. The dead will walk, the fish will fly. But I

am lost with the umbrellas in St. Petersburg, you will find me rushing off

to a Nihilist meeting, where we will discuss the Crimea and the Jewish

Question. And I do believe in my heart of hearts that I am tending towards

Fyodor's position; perhaps on the morrow as well, we shall march on

Constantinople. The light is dim; two peasant women move hurridly out of

the way of several Cossacks on horseback. Last night, I dreamed of 1903,

and woke in wonder at our all-too-brief lif

against the icy wind. St. Petersburg is no place to be this time of year;

some would say, at any. I am pregnant, with longing, and with child. And I

know, again on the morrow, beneath these dimmed winter nights, that my

time will come as well. I am no man's burden.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: There is often a lure and seduction among the 
avatars at work here - and this relates to the Lacanian objet a, 
deferal....

[14:32] sandy Taifun: coagulating like limpets seas and jellies

[14:32] sandy Taifun: we are made, made, women, we have sounded, 
resonated, with each and every protocol, each and every space or site open 
to winds

[14:32] sandy Taifun: you've said that before, over and over again, as if 
repetition had no goal but the delibery of the interval...

[14:32] sandy Taifun: which bring about the semblance of a face, 
lineaments of eyes and mouths, speaking elsewhere, from the sides of 
things

[14:32] sandy Taifun: a package: this avatar / that avatar. knives. prims 
cut.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: avatar-man talks. look inside he says. you can do 
it.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: your words appear to the other, and erasures are 
also visible, the letters disappearing in reverse.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: "Consider the next smearing of your thinking 
skin.\n";

[14:32] sandy Taifun: jellies and dark dreams, there is space enough for 
your soft limbs, for mine...

[14:32] sandy Taifun: the matrix saves us, there is no beginning and 
ending, nothing but liquid pureness of language salvaging these spaces...

[14:32] sandy Taifun: Each participant occupies a space on the screen 
which represents - or is - the space of the (virtual) body constituted 
written

[14:32] sandy Taifun: margins, slippages, constitutions, constructs, 
emergences from the "depths" of software or hardware, blockages and flows

[14:32] sandy Taifun: only through taking these into account, as well as 
surface manifestations is it possible to comprehend virtual subjectivity

[14:32] sandy Taifun: "one by one, each on a line alone, typing Control-d 
when done.\n";

[14:32] sandy Taifun: $name calls forth $a[$gen1] $noun[$non], hungered, 
making things.  $prep[$pre] the $a[$gen], $name is $a[$diff], $[$gen], 
$str?

[14:32] sandy Taifun: system("touch .trace; rev rope >> .trace");

[14:32] sandy Taifun: construction torsion near avatar edge-space. the 
limits of avatar are the limits of world.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: avatar anorectic

[14:32] sandy Taifun: consider the _projection of the self_ - its written 
or constituted appearance - in various applications

[14:32] sandy Taifun: You begin to understand that not all avatars are 
bots or expert systems that some of them are symptoms just as I am

[14:32] sandy Taifun: root of the avatar is elsewhere

[14:32] sandy Taifun: The disappearance of the branch into hardened rock 
and occasional artifacts.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: the avatar itself, the image-avatar, is ghost. The 
ghost travels through anything of course;  nothing more than coordinates

[14:32] sandy Taifun: Well, there's no more to it, and his writing avatar 
discourse itself is getting stale. He's taken you and I around the bend

[14:32] sandy Taifun: which trundles bundles towards the future; we're all 
there carrying more than our share of avatar's, where there, or so I heard

[14:32] sandy Taifun: The disappearance of the branch into hardened rock 
and occasional artifacts.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: the avatar itself, the image-avatar, is ghost. The 
ghost travels through anything of course;  nothing more than coordinates

[14:32] sandy Taifun: o avatar, rise in the midst of maelstrom, sadness of 
cobalt plutonium sadness uranium sadness radium sadness

[14:32] sandy Taifun: - seriously, what covers the pain of completion, i 
am yours no more argon xenon neon, whirl me through you avatar

[14:32] sandy Taifun: this file is your avatar my knife skin avatar.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: if you watch a solo file of avatar this is the solo 
file sexatar to watch.

[14:32] Dancoyote Antonelli: um genetalia is far from pseudo intellectual

[14:32] sandy Taifun: don't listen to avatar-man. listen to dream-woman.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: don't listen to dream-woman with avatar-man.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: this avatar-man is contaminated. this building is 
condemned.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: shades of avatars-- precognition of behavior 
collision avatar transparent interpenetration sex

[14:32] sandy Taifun: Just like those pirouettes, as if there were a body 
at the center of them. Her skirt kept flying up, and there was nothing

[14:32] sandy Taifun: SQUEAK speak forever or now hold your peace; this is 
your life, you do not have a lease on any other, your avatars have left,

[14:32] sandy Taifun: the beginning of transparency, wizard 
listening-posts on MOOs for example. Here we are, the virtual 
becoming-virtual still.

[14:32] sandy Taifun: Given that the danced-to-infinity motion-capture 
second=life quasi-avatar is tethered at a root somewhat distanced

[14:32] sandy Taifun: to have the image 'break through' private barriers - 
of course with little consequence

[14:33] sandy Taifun: Sound of wood and wire: new alpine zither:

[14:33] Dancoyote Antonelli: pseudo junkatalia maybe

[14:33] sandy Taifun: my eyes is the corpse of light and color my nose is 
all that remains of odors when their unreality has been demonstrated

[14:33] sandy Taifun: the light becomes the eye as such no longer 
stimulation of the retina world declares itself odorless song of the wind 
in trees

[14:33] sandy Taifun: (from N.)

I received the bomb from Dimitri. I took the bomb to the flabby heart of a

knot of soldiers. I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons. I

gave myself over to the bomb and I released it. I presaged the machines

and I did know of the machines.

[14:33] sandy Taifun: And I issue a warning:

THE MACHINES WILL SUCK YOUR ENERGY.

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.

THE MACHINES WILL SEE FOR YOU, DIRECT YOUR EYES FOR YOU.

THE MACHINES WILL FILTER EVERYTHING THROUGH THE EVIL APPARATUS.

THIS IS NOT A TEST OF THE MACHINES, THIS IS A WARNING I WILL GIVE YOU.

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.

THE WARNING LEAKS THROUGH THE MACHINES, THE WARNING TELLS YOU:

THE ENERGY IS GONE.

[14:34] sandy Taifun: Hey! You avatar make me angry.

[14:34] sandy Taifun: Hey! You! Avatar! I am you am I

[14:34] sandy Taifun: the avatar sunk beneath the mud

[14:34] SaveMe Oh: fuck you

[14:34] sandy Taifun: gimme love avatar gimme love

[14:34] SaveMe Oh: low life fraudes

[14:34] sandy Taifun: look at me avatar look at me

[14:34] sandy Taifun: i prefer the small, seeping, the peripeheral, 
marginal, the scattered words

[14:34] sandy Taifun: as sites, domains, emanations, emissions, which are 
interwoven and sharing coagulated ego/s, matrices, languages, bodies.

[14:34] sandy Taifun: what would break down here, a language that you use 
against me? so that I will absjure, abjure these ... moments ... ?

[14:34] sandy Taifun: i prefer the small, seeping, the peripeheral, 
marginal, the scattered words, drops say from a drizzle

[14:34] SaveMe Oh: go get a life

[14:34] sandy Taifun: everything is a moment moment for you, everything 
this mmmm... of matrix, mother, maternal, carrying forth

[14:34] sandy Taifun: which announces itself as the edge or frame of this 
dialog, these moments carried forth...

[14:34] sandy Taifun: times which smooth us, bits and bytes, protocls lost 
and smoothing functions traced across peripheries, margins

[14:34] sandy Taifun: vectored in a human

[14:34] sandy Taifun: define an avatar as an organism which is infinitely 
repairable

[14:34] sandy Taifun: define a human as an organism which is not

[14:34] sandy Taifun: avatar crap crap

[14:34] sandy Taifun: within and without semi-geodesic space of avatar 
paralleling

[14:34] sandy Taifun: i'm becoming avatar-man with dream-woman.

[14:34] sandy Taifun: and I can imagine a theater as well from this, 
taking a piss cloth, a blood cloth, a shit cloth, matching or 
contradicting

[14:34] sandy Taifun: are questions always questions

[14:34] sandy Taifun: this is a theater of the flesh, my tongue coated 
with you, you course through my veins, our marrows intertwined ...

[14:34] sandy Taifun:  is your heart beating there

[14:34] sandy Taifun: my invisible flesh

[14:34] Dancoyote Antonelli: or maybe "get a room?"

[14:34] sandy Taifun: are there answers to no-questions

[14:34] sandy Taifun: or do your muscles murmur true

[14:34] sandy Taifun: my visible flesh is not your meantime

[14:35] sandy Taifun: and in murmuring truth
