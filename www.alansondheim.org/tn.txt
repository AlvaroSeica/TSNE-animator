in the latter. just have to get away from hatred
towards what will remain later on, later on for me
there's hatred, fires burning everywhere, there's
the task at hand, there's retribution, recompense,
later on there's there optical-molecular,
dependent sinking, later on there's cosmography
and the reading of signs, for others, for you, 
there's always later on, later on is just around
the corner, take me away from all of this, turn
the corner, turn around

Alan Sondheim updated his status. For those who might want to 
know: There's a mandatory evacuation of Wilkes-Barre and 
Kingston in effect at the moment; I just spoke to Mark and Kathy 
(who are down there dealing with the house after my father died) 
and they're not sure where they're going. Stay tuned.

things getting bizarre. on my father's 95th, we went down and 
his (our old) house caught on fire, coincidentally. Azure and I 
and my nephew and his girlfriend put it out. now we're supposed 
to go down to the house (in Kingston, across from Wilkes-Barre - 
and Wilkes-Barre is flooding; my brother and his wife are in the 
house trying to move things around. if the forecasts are correct 
this will be the worst flood since '72.

intermittent epoch of the pile of texts and bodies

http://www.alansondheim.org/fontanel103.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/epoch.mp3 gusle, rebaba

1-string bowed gusle, then 1-string bowed rebaba

the thing of apocalypse

announcement of beginning and end, therefore the enunciation of 
a hinge or boundary: integers on one side, transcendentals on 
the other.

but also a sense of doom and ecstasy - the infinite oasis of 
eternity.

it carries religious overtones; prepare for the atheist 
apocalypse, asymptotic annihilations on both sides of the 
border. and prepare for walls as well.

could we say we live within the apocalyptic? so that the world 
is constantly in a state of disappearance, forfeiture. the real 
tinsel of the world. the world of tendencies.

our discomfiture at absence.

the world is catching up to me via-a-vis my own intermittent 
sense of the catastrophic. for that matter the world is also an 
intermittency.

i dislike that every word, every word of _mine,_ is an abyss, a 
conflagration - that I feel I can only write what appears to me, 
essential, fundamental - scorched writing that harbors a deep 
inability to remember anything at all.

every instance of every language is an idiolect: let us collapse 
there in a pile of bodies.

again, then:
to be certain in these uncertain times:

violin with rain

http://www.alansondheim.org/interrupt.mp3

most innovative playing by the master of fifthfourthfifth

who kept changing the chair position, thinking of 
ingmar bergman's uncut version of fanny and alexander

and then there's the remarkable innovation of intervals
based on the luxuriousness of anton webern and umm kulthum
and of course the despair of sinjar and the amazement
of the mastery of mines

delicacy of reglued bouts and boxwood patinas
gut strings and the wisdom of 1881

and the changing of the positions of the chair

towards a new music why not

http://www.alansondheim.org/contact0.mp3
 - 7-string miniature afghani tambur bowed with contact mic
http://www.alansondheim.org/contact1.mp3
 - 1-string serbian gusle bowed with contact mic
 - 3/4 violin bow with bass rosin

the techniques allow me to create complex testures which
can back up into each other. on the tambur, i'm working
with extremely high-pitched tones and drones in unison; 
by angling my fingers i create more or less dissonance.
on the gusle, harmonics take me up several octaves. the
mic is fed into a fender instrument amp. the pieces are
inspired by batak music.

The railroad assassination squad.

The railroad assassination squad.
The pinionist.
The pinionist landed on the assassination squad car.
There was a flatcar and a boxcar.
On the flatcar, the pinionist placed a flat box.
On the boxcar? Nothing at all.
She would not and could not fly in doors and out the other.
Out the other was a bother.
The railroad assassination squad was the pinionist.
Wings folded, the pinionist was in the flat box.
The assassination squad car was in the flat box.
The boxcar was in the flat box.
The flatcar was in the flat box.
There were four things in the flat box.
The pinionist was ready for action.
He was walking the tracks.
There were two tracks some called rails.
On the left track, him.
On the right track, her.
The pinionist sprang into action.
