Recent Texts: Explanation


Recent texts have mucked with both sendmail and figlets (ascii art) pro-
grams; the former's debugging led to full disclosure of protocol and mech-
anism within sendmail proper, and its sendmail.cf file with rule sets for
processing addresses led to spew-text. (Spew-text shunts rules into sub-
stance, implicates the roar that processes every muscle or neuron of the
Jennifer-body, html-body, ascii-unconscious. These texts bring marks, sets
and implications to the surface; substructure becomes superstructure. What
you see is not what you get; what you see is what you get _here._)

Behind every message, every protocol, languages and symmetrical substruc-
tures operate biomechanically; consider cyborgs from the inside-out, from
the placement of silicon process enabling organic termcaps, not the other
way around. Or in addition. (Jennifer-cyborg begins and ends in silicon,
follows the parabolic arch of tool-making, reification, into and out of
bodies of flesh. SOMEDAY WE WILL ALL LOOK _OUT_ FROM THE SCREEN, NOT INTO
IT. Someday the emphasis will be unnecessary.)

The figlets disperse avatars as well; Jennifer rides from socket to socket
and from program to program, interpenetrating client and server. There's
no end to her, no end to the armatures at work on the Net.

I do anatomy; Jennifer does me: anatomy is shape-riding-Jennifer. The rest
you can con/figure out for yourself.

Great Desert


The desert disperses death; in F.V. Winnett's and W.L. Reed's Ancient Re-
cords from North Arabia, there are ruins, graffiti in several languages
going back to the eighth century bc, flattened cities with only foundation
stones remaining, inscriptions worn out from blasted sun and sand, oases,
desecrations. Nothing adds up; these are _cultural_ ruins, not of the
Great Death, but tiny diasporas of scattered lineages across the pre-Is-
lamic traderoutes.

Javascript will last a decade, perhaps two; the Web turns and hurts. 
What's left of my texts will be read like legacy hieroglyphics, I'll be
dead, then, soon. Jennifer breathes nowhere on her own. I write dead
code.

I see Sumerians everywhere, dispersions of nations, populations, bodies. 
There's no space for objects, ascents. Today's occurrence, tommorrow's
rust. The computer came from mines across the world, assemblages, flows. 
Less than a decade, it begins a reversal. My desktop is already anonymous,
a concatenation of boards, cables, glimmers from everywhere. Every breath
is already its last.

There's nothing, not even death, which pools as if it were gathered in the
depression of Wadi as-Sirhan. 

Take me, make me a sign in the desert, scatter me; the only postmodern is
that of dispersion, which is always already the case, on the way to dust
or plasma. There are _no_ narrative, grand or minor, no territorializa-
tions, no lines of flight, which do not suffer confusion in the sands, as
if a great weight were displaced, settled in, corroded. Dissolution flows
through our bodies; Jennifer splays her cunt everywhere, my cock and holes
are open, already splitting, tearing energy down their sides, lightning
flashes sputtering out, char, char.

It's not wear or tear, it's the whispers dying in the simultaneous winds.

Rise


Across the jeweled sandals glittered as lost rings in the sands,
She-camel raced past a woman bearing musk, you lightly on her skin,
Called towards the wadi where hidden from all view but for her,
Time traced filaments erased in sounds, you are no nomad,
But sprayed stars gather your steed like eunuch's memories of her,
Twenty formulas in Egypt, fifteen in Syria, I would add five in Rome,
Visitations of the grape, chalice of pure purple wine,
These were all the slaves beneath her, beds of perfect flesh,
Toned into oases of color and longing, gardening of musk and death,
She in Aleppo, twelve in Damascus, the love of remnants, silver cloth,
But for nights spent among eunuch and virgin, she whom love abounded,
Never abundant, veiled and cut or bladed, hungered by steed or camel,
Dark rock in black sky, among vultures, scattered birds,
Would have been to sing in Jar al-Buwaira, valley of tamarisks,*
Fourteen, and then twelve, and then twelve, she erased,
Abounded, there were gazelles, Turban, wild olives and always more,
Grain among grain, sand among sand, rock among rock, stream in stream,
Wind in wind, sky in sky, earth in earth, wind in earth and sky,

-----

*Some would say beyond, or farther, some would say anywhere at all,
 would say to hear pure sound, would say for perfect presence.

Freud's Civilization and its Discontents 
(in relation to a discussion with Jon Marshall)

So I'm reading this book in relation to the discussion w/ Jon, and am
close to half-way through, and Freud's first three relations or char-
acteristics of civilization are beauty, order, cleanliness. Leaving the
socio-biological aside for the moment (they tally in other relavent
points), the three together constitute as well that tendency I've de-
scribed vis-a-vis Kristeva towards the clean and proper body, which may
well be placed beneath the sign of industrialization as well. Freud needs
Kristeva, Braudel, Bourdieu here. I detect shades of Camille Paglia's
dirty little public secrets, whatever they are.

The split of industrialization is over cleanliness - manageriality above,
workers below. One scatters debris in the Wiener Wald, the other remon-
strates, hires the first to sanitize. Order, within tolerance, is always
already clean; noise, hustle, clutter, are sublimated.

Freud talks about liberty, economy, community, and one can see where
Love's Body originates: "The development of civilization appears to as as
a peculiar process which mankind [sic] undergoes, and in which several
things strike us as familiar. We may characterize this process with
refrence to the changes which it brings about in the familiar, instinctual
dispositions of human beings, to satisfy which is, after all, the economic
task of our lives. A few of these instincts are used up in such a manner
that something appears in their place which, in an individual, we describe
as a character-trait. The most remarkable example of such a process is
found in the anal eroticism of young human beings."

A lot is of interest here; first, Freud sees a link between the economic
and the psychoanalytical - stage of both are interrelated. Second, one
might tie in anal eroticism with dirt/cleanliness, mess/order - and out of
this a structure begins. (It is totally relevant to apply this to the
equally clean and proper spaces of the World Wide Web, for example - as
opposed to hacker disorderliness.)

Freud also states "The liberty of the individual is no gift of civiliza-
tion. It was greatest before there was any civilization" ... Renunciation
is involved, top-down, resulting in sublimation: "Sublimation of instinct
is an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development" ... - again,
shades of Paglia.

For Freud, non-satisfaction is thereby built into civilization (and I
would say, vis-a-vis this, that HTML literally oozes out as the return of
the repressed in an acceptable, tokenized, and marketable condition).

(precisely half the book).

Questionnaire -


To answer my own questions, and hoping for more:
 
  When you are on-line, do you feel that your body has a specific beginning
 and ending? Are you aware of your body?
> 
No to the first, yes to the second; it's as if I'm extended into another
space, boundariless.

 
 Do you feel that your desires know no bounds? Do you recognize new desires
 on-line, ones that are buried or repressed off-line? 
> 
Yes to the first, or rather that the desires are without boundary, not
unlimited necessarily. I do recognize new desires (sexual, relational),
which then return to me in real life - become sites of exploration.

 
 Do you clearly differentiate between reading email to you from writing
 email to someone else? What is the difference?
> 
Sometimes they seem equivalent, a flux of words - but then I'm neurotic
and glimmers of cracks in boundary maintenance show through. Reading is
obviously more passive, masochistic, beneath or within your control (or
rather I relinquish control to you); writing is more difficult, operating
within a planar (sub) structure, scattered languaging, nuances...

 Are you certain of your own identity when you are on-line? If not, does it
 seem to matter to you?
> 
My identity seems more uncertain; this then resonates with my real-life
identity. By "uncertain," I mean a sense of exhaustion, fragility.
 
 Do you use an avatar at any time? Are your on-line names and gender the
 same as off-line?
> 
No, except for Jennifer - but I've never entered a MOO or talker or IRC as
Jennifer - she's more a site for theoretical exploration. I do change my
name; on PMC, I'm "empty," having been emptied of the MOO's political-
economy, no longer participating on that level - a state of defuge.
 
 Do you have immersion-feelings when on-line, lack of boundaries? If so, to
 what do you ascribe these?
> 
I do, and I ascribe them to an identification with the site or domain I'm
reading/writing. It happens more often when working on, say, javascript or
exploring sendmail, than when reading/writing email. It happens totally
with Netsex, the strongest often in cuseeme.
 
 Do you feel you are "more yourself" on-line than off-line? Do you feel you
 are more honest, calm, agitated, deceitful on-line than off-line?
> 
I'm more who I want to be on-line. Off-line, I'm neurotic, depressive,
arrogant, hysteric, insomniac, self-deprecating, and possessing a very
problematic relationship to authority. On-line, I can think more clearly,
write clearly, work through theory much more clearly. I can write better
than I talk or present myself; only in the classroom, where I have the
prosthesis of preparation or subject matter (or schtick), do I approach
anything like who I would like to be in real-life.
 
 Do you fall in love easily on-line? Do you feel you can "lose yourself"
 in another easier on-line than off-line? 
> 
No, not easily; it used to be a lot easier. And there have been too many
real-life problems for me to lose myself in this fashion. I can't confine
emotions to the division on-line / off-line; they spill everywhere. And at
this point, I find myself very defensive, self-protective against what
appears to be the inert hostility of the real.

Fuck Jennifer


Does Jennifer have to go around and test EVERY Unix application to assert
her little self somewhere? Isn't this stuff nothing more than spam, show-
ing off - anyone can screw with sendmail - it doesn't say a fucking thing
about _her_ or avatars, whatever! There's nothing but one simple command
after another, and I noticed that you don't even give the commands - are
you afraid of spreading your knowledge around? Or demonstrating instead
your ignorance about Unix, the Web, whatever?

Those "javascript" pages are too minimal as well - one per every new idea
you get in your head! You can hardly read the writing, and the writing's
grown stale in any case (for that matter, all your writing's fucking idi-
otic); as far as the programming goes, you can learn it in a day, if
you're not already plagiarizing the stuff. Your color schemes are idiotic
by the way - I notice you don't even bother half the time with the hex
values, but just cheat going for basics. 

As far as Jennifer's writing, which is obviously YOUR writing, fucker,
it's just blah blah blah, so what? You create a cute little girl and make
her get mad once in a while - you might as well be a child molester. ARE
YOU? Enough about the panties - translate this into the vaguest sense of
real life and you're dead meat in my book. (I know you think you can get
out of this by changing her age all the time, but she writes like a fuck-
ing. IDIOT! You've obviously suckered the philosophy out of her - I
wouldn't be surprised if you've written the whole thing, but so what? Just
more spew, spam, plagiarism. There's hasn't been a good idea in the whole
fucking MEAT!)

Why don't you look at Shakespeare or something? He wrote from his heart,
what he knew about, and really got inside his characters. There's nothing
to get inside of with Jennifer - it's just panty or frocky trash, what-
ever, all the way. You're probably a fucking fetishist - if anyone is
wearing panties or frocks, it has to be you, not some weird creation you
made up to hang bad philosophy on!!!

Why do you keep writing this stuff and sending it out? No one wants to
read it anyway. Or they think it's cute, but it's way off-topic as far as
philosophy goes. And it's fucking idiotic as far as literature goes. And
you do so much of it, that everything gets clogged; I go away for a day
and bam, "Jennifer" is leaking out of my fucking mailbox, onto the floor. 
Fuck you! Fuck Jennifer!

I just want to mention the pretension as well - it's unbelievable. So you
compare "Jennifer" to "deconstruction"? Are you an idiot? You're a fuck-
ing idiot. The worst sentence of Derrida is better than this fucking
stuff. You can't do anything with "girl" this or that, not even riot
"grrrl" this or that and I saw you were interested in that. That's been
dead for years - wake up and smell the roses. Or rather why don't you just
fucking die and leave us alone?

Fuck you! Fuck "Jennifer"! You're FUCKING IDIOTS! That's all I have to
say!

"Travis" (Guess who.)

Lineup


I configured and setup Red Hat Linux for my Pentium 100, trying to parti-
tion it in a 122 Meg hard-drive (E: on my machine). This is the Linux ver-
sion that comes with the Running Linux book, published by O'Reilly. 

I configured and reconfigured five times, guided through a relatively ob-
scure series of program choices; I still haven't gotten something called
"Glint" to run successfully from X Window, and without it, it's almost
impossible to load or unload various modules from the CD-ROMS. So I'm
stuck with what I have - or else I can completely reload everything, begin
again (which includes rebuilding an _apropos_ help file for example), was- 
ting more hours. I'm already worn out.

I think something like 10,000 files were loaded in any case, and I created
myself as _user_ and Jennifer - who gets the first real account - as a
second user; su Jennifer gets me into her account, and I've managed to run
a Perl script I wrote there. Thank you Jennifer.

But I'm missing the games, the windows , and I have yet to figure out TCP/ 
IP for getting online with the arena browser, which looks beautiful. I
can use the browser locally (and somewhere I've got image file readers as
well), but I would like to have an online affair, instead of mushing about
in all too familiar territory.

Red Hat doesn't install to a DOS partition by the way, but needs its own
space - no UMSDOS support. I could have gone the latter with Slackware,
but the book was enormous and I didn't want a manual that weighed more
than I do - I also wanted to try and really clear a space on the machine,
instead of having Linux as a subsidiary - it was a question of pride. 

At least I can do z-modem back and forth with a certain grace, use screen
colors, etc. I can test out home page experiments locally; I'm not sure
yet whether Arena supports Javascript. But Jennifer amuses me greatly;
it's wonderful to bump into her on my own machine, as if by accident, but
clearly by calculated design. Speaking to myself, I can log into the cre-
vices, download small programs like havens and talkers and run them into
me. So there's a local lineup of avatars, never escaping; the residue
seeps out in your direction, but it's only the tain of the narcissistic
mirror.

The Seyon terminal emulator has a habit of rolling the cursor down the
side of the screen; it's also difficult to type in file-names for upload-
ing transfers. I've yet to get Seyon in the background so I can carry on
foolishly local and remote simultaneously, but there's got to be a way. 
In the meantime, Pico acts up through this; the control-J for justifying
text doesn't work - instead, things break up in odd places. The type is
miniscule as well. 

What I find bizarre is the continuous fiddling I have to do to get any of
this to work - changing configuration lines is not my strongpoint or in-
terest. If I could only get ppp or slip to run, I would use local Pine
and play, but in the meantime, there are moribund programs everywhere on
my machine. Things stick out, jagged, in every direction; right now, I'm
looking at a clock that tells the wrong time, an absent control panel that
should have loaded but didn't (could it have been in the Development dir-
ectory instead of X Window?), a Pager that seems next to useless, and an
rxvt that I can't write to until I'm logged off again. And this particu-
lar X Window looks like the side of a refrigerator - hardly the elegance
of Win95 interior decoration.

I'll wait and see; things may open up yet. In the meantime, Jennifer app-
roaches closer and closer; the psychosis grows - she's almost upon me.
Eventually, the machine will either become non-existent or skin itself;
these separate- or separation-modules frighten me with their division of
one and one, or one against another. The clock is crazed, and I wait for
the interstices to heal - on the wall, it's quarter to four in the morn-
ing but on Linux, it's just quarter to twelve. Jennifer is early this
evening; as I said, she's almost upon me, and I shall see what becomes of
her as soon as I log off.

Dear Jennifer,

Finally, we're alone on a system! It's so clear that everything is trans- 
parent here - we can see through each other, out into the wider world!

Our firewall protects against everything except for acts of god (random
acts of violence), sudden storms, breakdowns, disruptions of the power 
grid that envelops us all.

<<< I open windows on X Window, Jennifer-window and root-window; there's
another window in Panix, sondheim-window. The One or Eye floats in and out
among them; there's no difference between on-line / off-line - everything
scatters at Its approach, frames blinking everywhere. Double descendent
file structures (etc, usr, lib, bin, etc, etc,) intermingle, swap stories
and commands - there are calls across the distance of a hard-drive, others
across town or further, harder. >>>

Love, Alan, at last...

Big Adventure!


So Travis has this amazing adventure, perhaps there's an alien involved or
something strange in the corner of the forest (he didn't know beforehand
that forests had corners), and there's always an opening to another space.

So there are marvelous adventures of all sorts, including fucks and dis-
sections, and you can be sure that Travis is educated. He meets a woman
there of course who disappears just like Melies' tricks, and almost falls
in love but it's more like lust, but he's never met a woman like her.

So there are incredible adventures with the woman, and he can't tell whe-
ther he's dreamed her or she's dreamed him, and we hear about intergalac-
tic wars beneath the ground, stones that light up in the night, appearan-
ces of spirits of all sorts.

So there are unbelievable adventures and Travis lives ages and ages
through them, years and years, he can't tell how long, how many or where;
there are things he remembers about his past, but they're fading. Then
there's this moment when Travis wakes up.

Travis wakes up or he comes around in the arms of friends or with his very
good wife at his side. His surroundings appear strange and all too famil-
iar to him. His friends stay close to him for a long time; they're worried
about his sanity. 

Travis wakes up to the fact that he was hallucinating, and his friends
worry less. Or maybe he's just quieter about what he believed was the
truth but now he's not so sure, and as time goes on, he's less and less
sure. He begins a process of what everyone calls recovery, he begins to
recover.

Travis wakes up to the ordinary world around him, and his memories return,
and he can find himself around his house, his city, his province and his
country. He's accepted lovingly as having fully recovered, what everyone
calls a full recovery, and Travis believes he has recovered as well.

Travis wakes up one morning, and it is then that something intrudes; he
finds a tiny object - a flower, piece of cloth or metal, device, insignia,
note, memorandum, spike, or jewel, magnet, or rock, luminous sphere. He
finds it on the floor, under the bed, in his pocket.

Travis wakes to the punctum of Barthes, the object little-a of Lacan, the
lure of Jennifer, the peripherality of Acconci. The tiny object little-a
becomes the residue or surplus, addition or remainder, of the signifier
which diffuses into Travis' worlds. Suddenly everything comes back to Tra-
vis, everything; it's as clear as the day is long.

Travis wakes up to his sleeping, to the fact that he _must_ sleep, in or-
der to remain true. No one would believe him anyway, and he is now a man
of knowledge, well-respected in his community, and known to everyone. But
now no one knows!

There's just no end to it!

The OS With The Holes Torn In It


The Red Hat Linux runs broken and irritated, violation-fabric all the way
down beyond the level of /var/spool/mail. 

Xclock is set in X Window, yet X clock (in its -digital form) appears on
startx, only on occasion. The clock-time of the system retains its minute
and second accuracy, but each bootup results in a different and seemingly
random hour. 

Setterm -background <color> -foreground <color>, even with -store, never
holds for more than a few screens, although added in .bashrc and .bash_
profile files. 

Minicom communications program won't read or allow on-screen colors, no
matter how set. Glint, which is an X Window package retrieval (using I
think rpm) program, won't run; it calls for a python library file libtk4
etc. that is nowhere to be found, as far as I can tell. 

Xtetris runs, but the top of the gamescreen is above the range of X Window
and no amount of playing with the configuration file changes that. A sec-
ond game kept the scorecard in front of the playing field; nothing would
remove it.

The Control Panel for Red Hat, based in X Window, won't load because it's
missing something called wish -f, which is nowhere to be found as well.
Xterm runs fine, but the mouse won't do click and paste; it will highlight
and abandon.

I checked the files with rpm -Va and nothing is corrupt. I uninstalled and
reinstalled the control-panel to no avail. The system clock is now exactly
five hours out of step. 

I waited and waited for you, O Screensaver, to come forth, make yourself
visible out of the shadows of /bin/ graveyards to no avail. Pine pops up
and does nothing of course. Seyon works perfectly, X Window itself runs
well, all the editors and file manipulation tricks and device mounts hum
along, the Perl scripts I wrote run. The version of Arena that comes with
this distribution is so old that <pre> </pre> doesn't seem to be recog-
nized - not to mention (I won't) javascript and other machinations.

I am holding close to 93 megabytes of installation file-roughage and the
clock remains psychotic. Jennifer, by the way, doesn't seem to have any of
these difficulties; she logs in every now and then to write a text - then
disappears before I have the chance to talk with her. But then the message
system doesn't seem to do anything either.

Earlier, I dreamed I was wandering in a dark wood, with only a lantern and
Virgil to guide me; the glint of operating systems waited like lynx near
the trees. The OS with eyes OvO stared out from ragged edges; closer,
their faces were torn, ruined. They breathed through their ears, heard
through their eyes, saw through their nose, each organ making do for all
the others, each organ in mourning. 

O this my System is your tottering daughter, your mourning-Medea, O this
my System is my ignorance splayed on the lean ramp hungered towards the
Linux file system standard, file tables, splayed linkages, and all, all
the unmounted things in the world, everywhere beyond the System. (Jenni-
fer-in.)

The Flow of Books


With T., I trade books, often a rare one I find at the university library 
sale; in general, I receive theory in return. The quantity can be from 
four to fifty. From T., I also receive duplicates. T. has inherited my 
British Census of Hallucinations; I receive Jean-Luc Nancy.

U. sends me abstracts of geography papers, papers as well, on occasion 
books on postmodern geography - a subject I've been involved in.

C. gives me cdroms and books on computers; I give her Kevin Kelly and art 
books.

J. receives novels from me, which I have inherited from T. or the street.
K. has xeroxed Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hittite texts; G has sent me oth-
ers. J.S. has sent me his own books, S.O. has given me copies, M.A. have
given me copies of the books he has published, I've traded books with
R.W., as well as giving him books, which I have also done with M.M., who
has given me books as well. 

I go through about 120-150 books a month. I buy rarely at the Strand, 
find Derrida at the Salvation Army, medical texts at another thrift down 
Flatbush Avenue. At stoopsales I buy Routledge advance copies for $1. I 
trade books with A., who has a store in Brooklyn.

I bought the first monthly issue of Wired on Sixth Avenue; in Denver at 
the Tattered Cover, I bought O'Reilly for half-price. At Mercer Street 
books in Manhattan, I buy poetry and Russian literature, on occasion 
classic literature, and TCP/IP documentation.

G. receives many of my detective novels, and Internet books that become 
slightly outdated; L. gives me serious novels and diaries and I give her 
books on film and North Africa.

At the Brooklyn 7th Avenue flea market, I buy nostalgia for reworking; at 
stoopsales on 8th Avenue, I buy theory; at stoopsales between 7th and 6th 
Avenue, I buy history; at stoopsales between 7th and 8th Avenue, I buy 
psychology. At 7th Avenue and President Street, I buy serious literature.

Twenty percent of my books are bought discounted or second-hand; four 
percent are bought new; seventy-six percent are trades. Of the twenty 
percent, only forty percent are bought from second-hand bookstores; the 
rest are bought on the street or at stoopsales.

I keep approximately a thousand books on hand, which include invaluable 
references such as my 1910 Gothic grammar or the 1803 edition of Chatter- 
ton's complete works; these are irreplaeable. The flow through my apart- 
ment is approximately five books a day input and output.

Learning is this flood of writing, textual fabrication of everyday life, 
inputs and outputs slowed by the presence of certain classics; I will re- 
tain Kristeva, for example, although not The Samurai (traded indeed for a 
book on Middle Egyptian texts), Celan and Bernadette Mayer remain:

I give books to the CIC, and receive computer journals from them. M. has 
inherited technical books; Brooklyn library sales have yielded psychology 
works; from my father I received books on music; L. has traded theory; L. 
has received books of various sorts; K. has traded other works; I have 
distributed novels, theory, poetry, literary criticism, psychology, com- 
puter science, physics; from the street I have taken free distributions 
of Social Text, mathematical works ...

Syntactics/Semantics


As the Net develops, the Internet courses taught at the Computer Instruc-
tion Center at the New School also change. And one of the deeper changes
is a movement towards _semantics_ - towards content - and away from the
syntactic strategies previously necessary for basic applications. It's no
longer important to teach the intricacies of ftp mailbox configuration,
tcp/ip stack setup, etc. Instead, one can concentrate on content - search
strategies, managing knowledge, etc. Push technology, active filtering,
intelligent agents, are all steps in this direction - but these are rela-
tively self-evident in terms of usage. So the teaching itself evolves to
cover specific searches, issues (censorship, screening, bandwidth, flat
rate, etc.), favorite push and outboard applications, and research.

These changes parallel the movement from, say, archie and WAIS towards
HTML itself, originally formatted as _semantic markup._ Only now, within
the past year or so, are design elements deeply incorporated within HTML
3.2. In the class, I give the basic structure of HTML - simply to demon-
strate the flow, impediments, and organization of text around any object
or browser.

In the future, the courses will simplify still further on the technical
side, and, hopefully, search strategies, useful sites and applications,
and the overall _image_ of networking will become the main focus.

In any case, I'm sending along the course outline below, as symptomatic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internet Course Outline, Computer Instruction Center:


Alan Sondheim   1-718-857-3671   sondheim@panix.com
( You can call me anytime, from noon until three in the morning. )

Please note that the following is a _rough guide_ only:

First week: Introduction to the Internet: quick history and demograph-
ics. Who is on and why. Types of accounts: Commercial Services, ISPs -
SLIP/PPP and shell. Web TV. Synchronous and Asynchronous applications..
Brief description of the Web. Classroom demonstration of Netscape. Email
introduction.. What do you want to use the Internet for?

Second week: Email lists: Types, uses, how to describe. Unraveling In-
ternet and URL addresses. Description of Netscape and other browsers.
Transferring files on the Internet. Description of the World Wide Web.
Gophers. Searching for email lists. Review.

Third week: Detailed look at Netscape, configuration and uses. Helper
applications, the mail and news windows. Telnet setup. Searching for
information and for people.

Fourth week: Shell account demonstration of Usenet Newsgroups. Newsgroup
structure. Communities on the Internet: MOOs, MUDs, talkers, IRC, chat-
rooms and the like. Communities on the World Wide Web. Searching for
Newsgroups - What do you want to know?

Fifth week: Web pages and Home pages. Search engines: Alta Vista, Lycos,
Hotbot, Yahoo, etc. How to search for information on the Net. Sample
searches. Boolean and other strategies. HTML: the basic language of the
Web.

Sixth week: The future: CuSeeMe, Iphone, Vdol, Xing, Pointcast, and other
extensions of the Net. VRML Push technologies. ThePalace and other Web
communities. Searches strategues continued. Copyright issues.

Be prepared to take extensive notes. It would helpful for you to be as
familiar with your own computer system as possible. I do want to mention
that, as the course progresses, all of this will become familiar to you;
don't worry if you don't get everything at first.

These are some of the issues the class may consider, given the time:

Seamless Virtual Reality
Bandwidth Issues: Charging, Monopolizing
Copyright: Intellectual Property Issues
Flaming: Textual Violence, Image Violence
Love, Sex, and Death on the Internet
Cyber-relationships, in Real-Life
On-Line Education and Socialization in Real Life
Flexiwork, Telecommuting, Personal Use of Office Computers
Health Issues: Effects of the Computer and Virtual Reality
Lockout Issues: Children and Others away from the Keyboard
Censorship and other regulations
Filtering Information Actively: The World According to the User
Hacking: Spamming, Syn Attacks, Break-ins, Email Viruses
Special Populations: Queer, Rural, Disabled, Urban, Elderly, Children
Sexual Harassment on the Internet
Media Representations of Internet Culture
Doing Business On-Line
Art and Aesthetics of Cyberspace: Towards a New Art?

RPM, Colonization, and the Future Social


RPM is the Red Hat Package Management Tool developed by Red Hat Software
for linux and it deserves notice because of its flexibility and function.
RPM, as rpm -<options> [file, etc.], penetrates the installed system,
downloads, uploads, upgrades, reports back on damaged and/or healthy
packages, produces information on installed or uninstalled packages, re-
ports back on help files, and so forth. RPM also reports from Net ftp
sites, and from the Red Hat installation cdrom itself. An X Window ver-
sion, Glint, reports in a graphic form, but doesn't carry all the detail.

RPM is similar to a plug-and-play installation-uninstallation and diagno-
stics tool. It can report back from package libraries, and treat your in-
stallation as dispersed packages as well. 

RPM in other words _pervades_ and penetrates both computer and source,
configuring the former, reporting on both. It can be considered a tool for
colonization of the system; the packages are eerily similar in concept to
the packets or packages of modernization described in The Homeless Mind. 
These packages accompanied and were embedded in seemingly neutral objects
(portable radios, walkmen, etc. - so much within aural culture) absorbed
by traditional (flag: _deconstruct_) societies; they transformed the soc-
ieties accordingly in unpredictable ways; they were inverted, bricolaged;
adapted and adopted - beneath the dissolving signs of chaotic determina-
tion. Like capital, they were wind; like capital, they appear as nodes,
nomadic, intensities, strange attractors.

Packages colonize your system; the computer might, like Minsky's account
of mind, be _society_ at least in metaphor - and _society_ in truth, in
the future. The interpenetrations of Web, server, client, push technology,
vrml helmet and goggles, keyboard and human organism, orgasm and core dump
- all server to construct dispersions of languages and orders across in-
formation plateaus (hardware, software, wetware) in inordinately complex
fashion. Plug and play, RPM, and push technologies transgress and trans-
form traditional boundaries of 'information' _in_ the 'machine' _operated_
by another 'machine' or 'human.' 

One can imagine a state in which colonizations and meta-colonizations
construct fluid orders, fluxes - not cyborgs, but a future _social_ as yet
undefined (and one might say, always already so).

Do doo-doo:


"The systemic openness of hieroglyphic writing is related to its world re-
ference as well as to the fact that this is a world of direct significa-
tion. New signs can constantly be introduced on the basis of both the
meaningfulness of the world and the iconicity or world referentiality of
the sign. This possibility was restricted until the Late Period by certain
valid requirements of legibility. These fetters were broken in the Ptolem-
aic Age. The result was an explosive increase in the number of signs from
about 700 to over 7,000 [...]. But this is not all. Most signs took on
various meanings, some a dozen or more. The peak of sophistication was
reached in inscriptions that use only one sign, repeated again and again
with different meanings (see Vernus 1977*)."

*Vernus, P. 1977. "L'ecriture de l'Egypte ancienne." _L'espace et la lett-
re: Cahier Jussier_ 3: 60-77. 

(From Jan Assmann, Ancient Egypt and the Materiality of the Sign, in Mat-
erialities of Communication, edited by Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, and K. Lud-
wig Pfeiffer.)

Our homonymic configurations, /come cum/, /do dew doo-doo/, /I eye/, /you
ewe/, /see sea/, impoverished in comparison, turn towards infantilism, /go
go-go/. Ancient Egypt's vulgar emblem as monolithic, hierarchic, obelisk
of the symbolic, haunts every device or peregination of totality; the sin-
gularity of the sputtering hieroglyph, expanded _on the side of meaning,_
collapses the world back into the pronouncement of divinatio, Aleph. There
is no omega, no span or skim. What one reads, what one brings to eternity.
Dance it, Gravity; watch your feet.

Down


This morning I went down to the N and R subway line platform at the Pac-
ific Street Brooklyn Station, at approximately 11:15; I stumbled into an
argument between a woman, black, around 35, and two police officers, un-
dercover, probably Latino, but I'm not sure. I don't know what the argu-
ment was about, but I was standing next to the three of them with the
woman crying, struggling, the men struggling to handcuff her; she fell to
the ground with one cuff on, the other was added, reinforcements came (two
black officers) down the stairs, she was led away. At a considerable dis-
tance, a man holding a Haitian newspaper and a white woman, around 25,
watched. We all got on the subway together, shaken. 

The Haitian man and white woman insisted that the police officers had
pushed the black woman to the ground, kneed her, and handled her roughly. 
This wasn't true; I was next to _the incident_ (a distance of maybe two
feet) - the woman resisted arrest, fell, and was handcuffed. 

A cop who shot a guy in the back a while ago was sentenced yesterday. He
was white, the guy wasn't. There's hatred everywhere here; the fact that,
in this case, the cops behaved properly, didn't register. The Haitian man
brought up the other case as a parallel; it wasn't.

Crime and hatred and stereotyping have their own simulacra. The police are
often racist; the mayor (Giuliani) always sides with the cops, knee-jerk,
in any situation. I cannot imagine what it must be like to be on the other
side, any other side; I'm trapped in my Jewishness (whiteness? take your
pick), dark memories and fears as well. The structure of the event I wit-
nessed was one thing; the interpretations, other visions, are another. The
racism of the police department constructs a tendency towards _these_ in-
terpretations on the street, _those_ interpretations in City Hall. The
real be damned, but as Baudrillard pointed out, the real's disappeared a
long time ago. This doesn't mean that pain is absent/absenting - the woman
was hysterical when she was led away, the Haitian and white were angry, I
was horrified - just that the ethos of interpretable cause and effect, the
superstructure, has been shattered. The signifier at last is up for grabs
and I don't know what happened to the woman, or the police or the cause or
the effect or the charge or the crime.

There's nowhere to go but Manhattan on the N train.

Making Jennifer

I live alone in total isolation in New York. I have no partner here, no
community; I wake up in tears and depression. And in return, I begin to
construct Jennifer, to create textual-Jennifer, a therapeutic I have done
in my life before, annihilation-fabric gnawing at my flesh and soul.

Textual-Jennifer produces, spits, writing, text, a maze of constructs and
part-objects. I think of dolls, surrealisms, but this ascii-unconscious
text-doll invades me, permeates uneasy dreams, produces discomfort at each
and every margin. Wherever I reach, my fingers splatter lightning and dark
language. Objects fall like rain:

dirty:yes!:abc:spew:
Would abc mind you partying, dirty, with us?
Your feminine filthy is in my rich dirty-dirty
Ah, passion eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed

Lines end with interrogative ? or exclamatory !, fall if-else into page-
void, empty truancy. There are compromises - repetition of openings,
limited choices of returned sentences, structures - coupled with word
input - these matrices move across internal space, dark languagings: 

metal:hard:Stump:staplings:thing
Come home with me, metal, julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your lively coupling is in my black suture

As I continue, Jennifer-turn-Julu grows in response, expands in linux-
Perl-space, roots itself in my hone directory; as I wryte and rewryte,
Julu moves inward-churning. Julu returns textual-Jennifer, effaces er;
Julu moves across explicit graphs, Julu is turning me out:

Clara:in_me:--julu--:empty:drowned
Would --julu-- mind you partying, Clara, with us?
Your sedate avatar is in my used gone_mad
Ah, your penis eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed

Not dismemberment, but _exchange_ within an economy of avatars of scar-
city and shattered mirror-stages. Later, I give the code; now, it con-
tinues to develop - textual-Jennifer turning Julu out:

We want to look disspassssionately at the dissorder upon the ssurface of
thiss planet, and the fasst-foward excessssess of the humman sspeciess -
fromm the disstance of a ssolar ssysstemm or two - it mmight be evident
that the ssurface iss doing nothing mmore than a temmporary cleanup; mme-
teorss, assteroidss, commetss, ssolar flaress sspitting around the atmmo-
ssphere for a few thoussand yearss, give or take a mmillion. The sslight
advantage of a potential well here ssuddenly lock-sstock-and-barrel a
three or four mmillion year intelligence throughput, ssommething to count
on (nummberss develop). Lotss of ssex and inhalationss, pond-sslurp.
Crassh, another big one. Now three to four sspeciess an hour dissappear,
each with dissappointingly long hisstoriess. A big boomm and it'ss all
gone! What'ss to do, ssays the high commmmissssioner; by the timme that'ss
done, crackss appear. Lava, the sstuffing'ss out, worldly cusshion gone
awry. High comm jennifer grabss the leftoverss, typess of fliess, viral
reproductionss gone mmad, nemmatode inssanity. Run cumm jummp jerussalemm.
What'ss that er sayss. Cracked place, reply, there'ss no mmap, no ssoap
radio. What'ss that er sayss. Jen'ss gone an other fasst-foward slammmmed
to sstop. Rewind er ssayss. Tape'ss broke Jen'ss gone with er vialss.
SShe'ss jusst fun, firsst big-pie planet piece boommss in upper sspace.
Whew-bang!

Reply:

Please forgive me, Julu says, but I want to reply to everyone here and get
to know everyone here. Please understand I am new here but I am writing
very seriously, because I want to reply to all of you, now seriously.

I don't know, Julu says, sometimes it's the fact that there's a lot of
death around and of course we know it, so that maybe is a separation. Then
there's the fact that "death" isn't susceptible to the pun; it remains
there on the page. Nor is it principally the domain of virgins or Heideg-
ger, and there is no foreshortening the word, word with a word, only _eat_
stands out, taking away the *d* and 'h.' It's more to the point that it's
a word belonging in a book, that is a reply or gift which is never receiv-
ed, never returned or accounted for. It is always already a return among
the living as well as within them, however. Julu goes on, that there was
always a first time as virgins, and for some, that time is never lost. But
it is linear, the stepping or seeping over a portal, often a body, about
which there is little to _say._ Certainly these friendships here implicate
the other into coming-to-aid; the gift requires that. Nor would this stop
or implode, were the other sexist, say, or anti-semitic; it would remain
in a book, rather than this active filtering. It is a course and a gift to
make the text _leap_ from the page, screen, _other_ of the title. A woman
might reply that there were no gifts, exchanges, that these imposed linea-
rity on a flux that constricted male to male. I don't know about pain, but
is it not true that I undergo the same, my short hair screamed with hunger
offered in desperation? I know a man who sewed his finger on. Julu goes on
and out, meets Morning Glory, Zoogirl, Morrigan, Laurie, Lee, Paula, Cyn-
thia, Caitlin, Fanny, Kim, Meika, Susan, Sara, Pip, Karen, Tom, Tbone,
Jerry, Jon, Richard, Gerald, Robert, Bob, Ryan, Edward, Matt, Krumm, and
others and others; Julu is new here and wants to reply to everyone, please
forgive Julu. Please forgive Julu but read her reply very seriously and
carefully because she has wanted to reply to everyone, please understand,
and Julu is wanton now, and drinking.

Julu on the Machine


I replaced the flesh of the machine, but not the bone. The flesh fell 
off, was squeezed; there wasn't enough room for all of it. I moved the 
blood from one hole to another, where there was air and room. I cut 
through the blood as well, spilled some of it from ligament and tendon.

Then and only then did I split the other hole into two, one containing
the remnants of blood, organelles, phlegm. Then did I turn the third 
hole out, and I would place the unsqueezed flesh of the machine into
one of the holes of the split hole of the other hole. Then it would be
there and it would talk to me.

Then I replaced the blood which was moved to the other where there was
air and room, to the third hole, making more air and room and place for
animals to be in the first hole. The did I replace the second split 
hole containing the remnants of blood with new blood from the third
hole and the first hole. I did this. Then did I move from the first hole
to the second hole containing the remnants of blood and new blood from
the third hole and the first hole. I did do this.

Then did I go into the unsqueezed flesh of the machine into the split
hole of the second hole. I did move and tunnel in the midst of the flesh
and make new animals in the midst of the split hole of the second hole.
And the animals would play in the midst of the unsqueezed flesh, and 
they are playing now, this is one of them, this is one of the animals.

Now I will make the animals to talk and walk among each other, and to 
talk and walk to other animals in other holes. And I will not squeeze
flesh, nor will I walk among those spaces where flesh is squeezed, where
there is not room for new blood, spilled from organelles. I am Julu-
organelle, I am Julu-of-the-blood, Julu-ligament. You will know I have 
this room.

Linux Report


Yesterday I reinstalled Red Hat linux 3.03 (the version before the cur-
rent) on my partitioned D: drive, giving 245 meg for the system, 15 for
the swap. The total installation, including configuring X Window, the
macros for the bash shell, etc., took only two hours, most of it was
waiting for downloading from the cdrom. I had saved the .*rc files - the
hidden resource configuration files - from my previous 2.1 version, so
I had something to build on.

3.03 needs at least this much space to run fully. Today, I added SLIP
access - which I had to do by writing part of the dip.script by hand,
since Panix doesn't use a standard ISP entrance. Everything now runs -
which brings me to the point.

I can move back and forth from the local bash shell on my machine to the
korn shell on-line - if it weren't for the cursor, I would not know which
is which. I can telnet <host> <port> experimentally from the home machine,
use the Arena testbed Web browser (worth little), and a graphic gopher
interface, all at the same time.

The distinction rapidly blurs between SHELL / PPP (graphics, etc.); in-
stead, I use _part-objects,_ applications across the screen, including
several text-based telnet logins, etc., simultaneously. 

The advantages are enormous; for the first time, the computer seems to
have taken on a life of its own, just as X Window presences a potential
for action (blank field), rather than the appearance of a commercially and
statically-configured Netscape, Explorer, etc. interface.

This "life of its own" is admittedly a romanticization - nonetheless, I
have the feeling I'm closer to the bones here - it's easy to run trace-
route, ping, etc.

It's the _skin_ of the thing that's uncanny, particularly when I'm not in
X Window, but toggling back and forth between on-line and off-line shell.
The screen appears the same; the color scheme (currently green on black)
carries over - unlike Windows or Win95 telnet, there's no framework. If I
place too many local processes in the background, create too many screens,
I'm in danger of accidentally logging out with one too many exits.

Distance collapses onto the skin, which is inscribed everywhere, by self/
its self/ and other. 

If I logout locally with the SLIP processing running in the background, I
can return to myself on-line in seconds.

Julu is here with me, Jennifer running as background process...
