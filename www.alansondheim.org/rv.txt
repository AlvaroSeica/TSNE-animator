neuros is based on a simple tune which curls in on 
itself, neurotically breaks out, returns, swallows
itself, and so forth; timing is interrupted as a
result. a good example of 'conceptualized' music
where a system is set up, broken, turned abject, 
the improvisation moves through and across the
resulting striations. think of obsessive tracking
or psychoanalytic palimpsest.

carries these operations into stretched pitches
and time frames, as if a tune were always in the
process of (melodic) formation, immersion and
definability at cross-current entanglement. 

I'm at my _wit's end._ None of this _matters._
I have _no resources left._ I have no 
_aesthetics._ I am a big grown _boy._ I am
_tired of perseverance._ I _listen._

The Hundred Questions of Milarepa

Forgot your password? New user? Forgot your password? New user? 
What is the relationship between email and ordinary mail? I am 
poor for the Net? I've connected my Psion3A palmtop, without 
terminal emulation a pocket calculator, these could be sold for 
$100. So WHERE ARE THEY? Should old objects that are abandoned 
be @recycled? What about Wizard's objects? Should players be 
contacted? Should therefore their email addresses be made 
available? If a player is recycled, the number is permanent 
great beast are we remaking ourselves according to the image of 
sterility? There's no way to thrust the body _out_ and _in_ - 
What happens? I write Where's the psychosis? In the assumption 
that all of this is _cool,_ love in a high-speed car, driving 
naked; what about this? Bodies hurtling, Why is the _gaze_ so 
persistent, in its absence, in this space? I can't Eine Insel? 
Ein verkommnes Floss? Was it an island? A decrepit raft? Where 
are we going; what will we do when we get there? Will we ever 
get where we are going; will the going be forgotten? Will it 
disappear like the rainbow's foundation? Will it pass through 
us; will it be a mirage? Like restless gossameres? Did peer, as 
through a grate? And is that Woman all her crew? Is that a 
Death? and are there two? Is Death that woman's mate? but also 
the real cyberspatial. Where does possession lie? And 
informmation can supply? Our Occam was wrong; conservation, in 
fact, is just whom should we speak? To what, in fact? Under what 
circumstances? The disance, we have discovered something even 
unknown to you? In the Rigveda, deity, only with protocol, 
etiquette: What is the nature of our address? And where is 
_back,_ external to our local neighborhood of space and time? 
What inversion, reversal, must we incur, in order to say what? 
Or are we, what we call history? something like it and there 
won't be again, and why here in cyberspace? But what happened? I 
look at the texts, listen to the sounds, and they're in and 
left, Miles Davis and others went fusion, no? Jazz is nice 
again, due: Is the Internet white? European? Based on rigid 
logic? Or rather, not white, but rigid in its rejection of the 
body? I recognize not what was caught in what web at that point, 
there? What brilliance, there? So there are two questions: why 
is there something rather than nothing?; how does this nothing 
begin causation? Infinite time places the original self; one 
cannot legislate. What then? I prefer the pure grief of random, 
the story-teller's art? What is death in cyberspace? Where are 
the grounds of the epitaph, its holograph? Can one ever be sure 
of its authenticity? Can one write one's own epitaph here? Does 
it pass from person to person, wraith to wraith? or virtual body 
of the deceased? Can the deceased change her/his own? Do the 
dead have permissions? In cyberspace, is the epitaph the grave 
itself? Can the grave be down,loaded? Does downloading the 
epitaph transform it into the _slogan_? become lost in this 
dominion? Is the epitaph similar to a homepage, always under 
construction, torn down at a server's notice? inscription, the 
tools of the stonemason? the virtual or real body itself? Is the 
epitaph always gone from the world? which is no site whatsoever, 
email address erased or reassigned? Is burial itself a gone 
thing? Mourning occurs forever, away from within a week or two? 
To grieve is to _disconnect,_ not to remain online, weteni,

Various AI robotics? Those with subsumption architecture? And so

salvation, tabla

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/salvation0.mp3 (solo tabla)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/salvation1.mp3 (solo tabla)

tabla bought at the local salvation army; azure saw the banya
on a shelf with glassware, so we bought it as a 'bongo.' then
we asked and the managers found the tabla (smaller drum) in 
the back room. we asked about the tabla rings and came back 
today, and there they were. now we're waiting for the hammer. 
the total cost has been around $51 which is very cheap for a
really good set. here are two recordings. because of my nails
(among other things), i can't play traditionally, but i can 
make my own music and here it sounds quite beautiful i think;
i hadn't heard these sounds quite before. processed through
audacity where the volume was adjusted and reverb was added.
again and against the appearance and disappearance of forms,
entangled structures, silence. unlike some of my other music,
i can listen to these repeatedly; give them a chance at least
once - 



we are all damned

so that things might or might not appear 
in their proper order, everything lags, 
notes look over their temporal shoulders,
mourn what's left behind



on (my) improvisation


i could not live without music. my body would atrophy, my mind 
would have forgotten the potential of entangled structures. or 
would not have gone there in the first place. my nails on my 
right hand need guarding, they are often coated or gloved, they 
carry the attack on the strings just as the soft skin beneath 
them carries the denouement. i worry when my right index finger 
develops pain and have learned to switch to the middle or fourth 
finger for the same strokes; the strokes are constantly varied, 
and if a nail breaks, another finger comes in for the substitu- 
tion. my wrists are clumsy; my hands move laterally, quickly, 
but have difficulty sustaining the back-and-forth of picks, and 
picks in any case seem absurdly single-minded, as if the body 
concentrated into a single contact from mind to instrument - one 
stroke at a time, a quick succession of linear flashes. instead 
i tend to claw up and down on the strings, as many as possible - 
or instead, churn quick successions of notes as my right hand 
rolls across one or more strings, something i picked up between 
flamenco and pipa. bowing is a relaxation; the fingers do little 
and i can let the arm bear the brunt of the music and its smooth 
coursing.

but when a nail splinters, i must hone it down as near as 
possible to the breaking point, but not beyond; i need as much 
as available. my playing becomes a ragged system of substitu- 
tions as different strategies are employed so that the surface 
of the music coheres. gone are the nail hardeners and 
strengtheners and gloves; what's present is the feel of the 
pressure against the nail, skin, and mind; in this i'm always 
and already thinking ahead to the next difficulty, the next 
flurry.

when bowing, not when using my fingers, my body sweats. it 
sways, taken up with sonority, it moves athletically - which my 
fingers do not. my fingers are concerned with dance, with 
litheness, something wayward and untoward, not repetitive and 
resistive. bowing is always changing, it is the arm and wrist 
and palm, and shoulder, and for me, my fingers are more relaxed. 
because i bow instruments with the base of the body on my foot 
or carpet, i also must think ahead, turning the instrument to 
advantage, to the best position of the bow. in both bowing and 
plucking, there is a continuous dialog between instrument and 
body, each adjusting to the other. the dialog is continued in 
improvisation - as i know somewhat where i want to go (the 
strategy of sound and structure), i work with the second 
strategy, that of the body and work-arounds that may alter the 
piece itself.

i play fast; there are times i play as fast as possible. then 
i'm able to let go, to let the music create its own arcs and 
bridges which i may not be able to follow. i'll do everything 
with my fingers to keep the speed. i use drones a lot, something 
i picked up from blues players, but have developed on oud, pipa, 
saz, even violin and viola, having that thickness and resonance 
of sound as much as possible, filling the space, the void, 
opening the abyss to swooping lines of music, double rails 
carrying the trains of the world to every unknown continent. 
naively, i've thought of speed as a sign of virtuosity, which 
fascinates me, although i prefer listening to alap and dhrupad 
for example. but speed seems to say, look at what this body can 
do!, how far it it removed from itself, how high it reaches! and 
it exhausts me, and yes, there is something of the contest in 
it, where might i take music that i haven't heard it taken 
before? this may be a delusion, but like everything described 
here, including alap, it is a driving force.

my breathing is no problem with stringed instruments, although i 
may catch my breath, having forgotten, autonomically, to 
breathe. when playing flute or chromatic harmonica, of course, 
breath is everything, and again i have to think where i am going 
in both music and body, where paths will cross, what will occur 
if, for example, i accidently hit a note i didn't want, or find 
myself playing harmonics where i want fundamentals. so there is 
constant correction, feedback, at work, just as there is, for 
example, in playing a fretless instrument where i am constantly 
adjusting my left-hand fingers for pitch as proper as i can make 
it. it becomes complex if i find one or more strings slipped and 
out of tune; at that point i might stop briefly to retune, or, 
more likely, play harmonics as part of the improvisation, and 
bring tuning into play so that the music takes a detour, but 
doesn't appear to stutter. you can hear this at work in some of 
my pieces, soft lulls and softer bending notes.

when a finger cramps, another takes over. when a technique on 
single strings creates strain, i may switch to a technique of 
whole-hand movement, for example quickly brushing the strings. 
when i play cura cumbus, a fast and loud small saz with a metal 
body, i will bring the thumb into play against my first and 
second fingers, which gives them a rest from the rapid trilling 
i'm otherwise engaged in. the result sounds like horses 
galloping and i imagine myself in the steppes somewhere, 
surrounded by wild mustangs. 

my mind juggles all of this, not necessarily inhabiting the 
music in a romantic or pure sense, but bouncing around like a 
stage manager as well, making sure the hands and fingers do 
their job, that momentary structures are recalled or abandoned, 
that the instrument remains in tune, that its position needs 
re-adjusting (for example i slightly change the position of the 
oud periodically), that everything is proceeding in due course, 
and then in relation to the other musicians. mostly i think like 
a solo, since there is already so much to consider; on tabla, 
for example, the heads may loosen due to humidity and even the 
stringed instruments may end up sounding dead - things like the 
ghichak or suroz for example, where the heads are partly skin, 
partly open to the world. when these things happen - changes in 
temperature or humidity - playing against has to be adjusted, 
for example perhaps emphasizing the bass or plucking towards the 
bridge to increase the treble.

i do try to be awkward, to confound myself, to play things that 
sound wrong but in an interesting way; recently, i've been doing 
this on tabla. the notes seem to drag elsewhere from one another 
and the landscape even with tamburi drone, is glacial. when i 
play like this, i think of particle physics, with its strings, 
rhythms, virtual particles, energies, stochastic processes, 
information loss and transformation, and inconceivably vast 
voids tending towards entropic stases. on a smaller scale, i 
have played open-holed classical flute with birds to good 
effect, in doubly entangled communications that can go on for 
quite a while.

i play on the floor or standing or on a low chair. i sit on 
wood or cloth, bending into the instrument, surrounding it. 

playing on the floor, my feet, by the way, tend to fall asleep, 
but it is impossible to change position with most of the 
instruments; it's afterwards, when i attempt to stand, that i 
notice this. the feet play little role other than support; on 
the other hand, when i play pump organ, it's as if everything is 
in the feet, not the keyboard, since proper pumping is necessary 
for an even sound, for the swelling and diminution of sound, and 
even, on an antique instrument, for preserving the condition of 
the bellows. the pump organ can be delicate to an extreme, just 
as the chromatic harmonica must be played carefully, in order to 
avoid clogging the valves. the easiest of the wind instruments i 
play, in terms of care, are the recorders - tenor is my 
favorite, and it's also one of the most difficult to play since 
everything depends on breath. i'd rather have good breath than 
good fingering, in fact, since a wavering recorder tone always 
sounds out of tune.

the nails on my left hand are almost always cut very short, but 
there are time when they're useful - certainly on sarangi, 
suroz, and ghichak, where they are used to press sideways 
against the strings, but also on things like the sung lisu, a 
shamisen-like northern thai instrument strung with three 
strings, all thin wires of the same diameters. using the 
left-hand nails against the fingerboard results in a sharper and 
clearer sound, something like a fretless banjo, but louder and 
with more warmth. on the other hand, faster runs require 
hammering-down and pulling-off, and this can only be done with 
the fleshy part of the fingers. again, thinking ahead results in 
smoother improvisation, and there are times one finger alone may 
be used for a nail glissando up and down the neck (the same is 
true for the oud).

at the end of a night with usually one set of thirty to forty 
minutes, i can no longer play. my nails are worn down and split, 
my muscles are slightly cramped, and i have to change fingering 
patterns and fingers too often. but all of this occurs, all of 
this is something i have learned, in order to keep the music 
flowing, often at high speed, often irregular and inventive. i 
have to keep thinking of new things, thinking of the body's 
condition as well, and this means simultaneous immersion in the 
music, and maintenance of both instrument and body, it's always 
a question of dialog, it's never monolithic, it's rarely the 
mythical 'being in the moment' which singers may often 
experience. instead it's inordinate difficulty and as a result, 
i record almost everything i do, to make sure i'm on track, i'm 
being inventive, i'm not wildly out of tune (given my hearing, 
my greatest fear), i'm not stepping over or under the other 
musicians, if there are any, and i'm producing what to me, will 
resound with a sense of wonder on second-hearing. for it is 
always second-hearing that is at work, hearing after the fact, 
after the resonance, after the production - hearing what had 
been, but i had not been aware of it, having dwelt in so many 
places at the same time. this is the being and heart of music i 
think, this dwelling, which is not unary or monolithic, and in 
fact does not give itself up to either spirit or monotheism; it 
simply _is,_ in the sense that being _is,_ and conveys that 
being within a communality embracing body, object, cosmos, 
architecture and architectonics, and structures, in a complex 
and striated simultaneity that seems endless within, and the 
memory of endlessness, without.

( a final, parenthetical, note - the voice is another matter 
altogether; i cannot sing or even carry a tune; it's as if 
there's a disconnect between mind and vocal chords. so i don't 
have the luxury of tuning by song, of self-accompaniment. 
instead, everything is strained, difficult; I use a tuner 
constantly and have to train and retrain myself to listen. my 
voice is flat, almost monotone; i remember al wilson, later of 
canned heat, telling me i was one of the few people he knew who 
couldn't hit an octave. so again there are work-arounds but i 
must bypass, cauterize, the part of my mind that wants to 
express itself otherwise. if i have no instrument, i have no 
pitch, literally, to speak of, and my instrument must speak for 
me. )

i realize the uselessness of these pieces; for
a long time, there's been little or no comment
and they tend to die. these are made to die,
these are already dead, slipped into consonance
of one sort or another, gathered together like
dead boys and girls in the woods, listening to
grandmothers' and grandfathers' tales before 
the blow of the axe, these are just unheard
pieces of music, like me dead before they were
born, disliked and abandoned miscarriages.



Northern Shoveler feeding behavior

http://www.alansondheim.org/winter.mp4

These are Northern Shoveler ducks, filter feeders
fairly uncommon in most parts of the US. Here,
they feed linearly for short periods, then gather
in rotating 'rafts'; with their heads down, they 
stir the bottom with their feet. The day was cold,
14 degree F wind chill, and there were Canada 
Geese, mallards, black ducks, ruddy ducks, swans,
white ducks, ring-nosed gulls, pigeons, and others
in the mix - so many birds, that the shovelers had
difficulty remaining in formation. This will give
you an idea of the rafts and linear drives; you'll
have to wait for warmer weather, hope the birds 
are still there along with us, and we might have
larger rafts. By the way when we left we saw a
solitary immature gyrfalcon (not in the video).
Enjoy!

sung lisu studies

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1055 (best)

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/lisu1.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/lisu2.mp3

two sung lisu studies with different scales
and techniques, but with similar fingerings.
the instrument is northern Thai, similar to
shamisen but with three wire strings, each
the same guage - so that tension alone
determines the tuning. i have two consonant
strings, and one a fourth higher, resulting
in the possibility of a drone and two 
strings fingered, or oddly, the consonant
strings fingered differently so that the
result is a strange chording - in this case
everything depends on the finger reach. the
sung lisu is a wonderful instrument to play 
- there are no frets and the neck is long
and thin; see 
http://www.alansondheim.org/sunglisu.jpg
for a picture. i found the instrument in 
an antique flea market in Colorado, without
a bridge or pick, but otherwise in perfect
condition.

1949

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1056

An improvisation on my 1949 Di Giorgio guitar.
This is the instrument I've played the longest;
the result is I feel a kind of mastery/misstery
with it, or perhaps the reverse. I wrote an 
article on it for Signal to Noise a few years
ago; it has a unique sound and is tuned quite
low. This is the first time I've played it in a
while, although I usually play one piece with
it on any of my recordings. The improvisation 
is 35 minutes; I wanted to see what I could do 
with this kind of form. I like to think a 
certain phenomenology of structure and emotion 
comes through. You can skip around or play as 
background. This is for Pat Courtney and Geoff
Dugan (who's playing a nice flamenco guitar 
now).

1920

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1062 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/1920.mp3

26 minute improvisation on 1890s-1920s parlor guitar,
most likely  a Larson Brothers model. this has had
four different bridges at different times; I'm hoping
for a fifth. the tone is brilliant and clear, the
neck is very narrow, and I'm using nylon strings. the
Larson Brothers were legendary guitar makers; I found
this at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania used instrument
shop, where it was being sold as a children't guitar
for $39. this and the Di Giorgio are my two perform-
ing instruments; I have had no need for any other.
recorded as is with added studio echo. it's harder
to play than the Di Giorgio, more exacting, but the
smaller body and neck gives me a greater reach for
chording/intervals. enjoy.



achievement of satori *

* through the intermediary of a muted violin.
thus the highest notes descend into the lowest,
losing their force and harmonics, bringing 
into fruition the heavier particles and their
re/presentation of desire among the corpuscles
of the human being; this isn't granular synth- 
esis, but it is the imminence of the grain of
the world, grain of the voice, of the violin,
mediated through the death of Roland Barthes
and Heruka tantra.

My Dad

Heaven pays no attention; 
Heaven's worth hardly a mention.
Humans have left their stuff
And it's worth hardly a puff.

Its body lights up the skies;
The rest is placed in a jar.
The dust doesn't tell the hours
Or that the stuff was now ours.

Years come and go and good riddance;
It's just about done with the dance.
There's no glass in the window,
No life in the jar left to harrow.

The dead always have it right;
At the end of the light there's no light.

their coming to get us. their blowing apart when we come.
their all smoke and mirrors. their all liars. their made
out of nothing and that makes them dangerous. their carrying
prions. their carrying guns. their big and carrying. their
weapons carrying. their ahead of destruction. their ahead of
slaughter. their eating and screams. their letting them die.
their making them die. their blowing apart. their spreading
everywhere. their reassemblings. their comings together.
their demanding our deaths. their pains and gruel. their
demanding control. their inflexibility. their commons. their
proper names and commons. their fun-time living. their love
of screams. their loving of everything screams.
