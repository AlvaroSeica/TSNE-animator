"the COSAC mass spectrometer took a spectrum in sniffing mode,

acetamide--that had not been previously reported in comets."

Republican Christie proposes tracking immigrants like FedEx packages
Reuters - 4 hours ago

REUTERS - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said on Saturday if he were 
elected president he would combat illegal immigration by creating a system 
to track foreign visitors the way FedEx tracks packages.

-- I woke up in the middle of the night with 95db of noise outside and 
inside, and realized how much I hate this country - particularly 
right-wing white males -- how much I'd like to see them exported like the 
scum they are -- and I have to control my own hysteria and depression in 
this regard -- why live in the midst of their lies and fury and 
anti-intellectualism -- their racism and intolerance of atheism -- their 
dismantling education -- their guns -- their killings -- their desecration 
of the planet -- and with population / global warming / violence / weapons 
distribution / extinctions on the increase -- why remain alive -- I try to 
take comfort in small things -- but the fury is there, surrounding us -- 
we can't even deal with our own internal refugees -- homeless people, sick 
people, in Providence -- across the street, a homeless woman has taken up 
the base of a flagpole -- flag at half-mast in front of the Federal 
Building -- as her home -- across the planet, we already know the outcome 
of the holocaust-in-progress -- we should track Christie, dump Trump 
somewhere outside the "Wall" -- that Horror -- on Fb we make fun of these 
clowns -- laughing at would-be Hitlers --

Donald Trump is amazing, as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 
adamantly asserted during an interview with GOP presidential frontrunner 
Donald Trump.

The former Alaska governor lavished praise on the self-assured Trump, 
noting that he "made the sacrifice to hit the campaign trail," much to the 
delight "The Trumpeters," or "Trumpservatives," as Palin called the 
movement backing him.

Palin, who Trump in July said that he would "love" to have in his 
administration if elected, brought Trump onto the program "On Point" at 
the One America News Network on Friday night. It was easily the best thing 
on television.

"Ive said it since the day he made the sacrifice to hit the campaign 
trail: Voters crave the anti-status-quo politician," Palin said as an 
introduction. "Everything about Donald Trumps campaign, its avant-garde. 
He is crushing it in the polls."

talk outline http://www.alansondheim.org/keyword.pdf

stumbled a great deal here, compensated, apologies
for any inaccuracies. lots of work shown, really happy
with the q&a and thanks to everyone who participated,
spoke, organized!

covered about 1/10 of what i'd like to have, and 
found myself running around far too much in my head; 
on the other hand, the images and videos spoke for
themselves. near the end, azure singing, myself on 
violin with revrev thanks to luke damrosch, version

consciousness as sexual impulse in general, and 
without direction to a definite individual of

phenomenon, simply the will-to-live."
