Blood


Containing the blood, detaining it. I'm a bloody mess. Clean up that bloo-
dy mess. @create container named Blood "One harbors the flesh against it-
self; the skin chafes, reddens, blisters, scabs, in order that liquidity
find its way towards the surface and give vent to the externalizations of 
form. Form, thrust out. Form, thrust away." (Sondheim, Disorders of the 
Real.)

Opening a can, I cut myself deeply at the base of the index finger to-
night; the blood flowed forever, through an opening about 3 cm long. I
bandaged it tight and the bleeding stopped; after a couple of hours, I
removed it and the blood started again, this time black. It's bandaged
again; it should coagulate by morning, or tomorrow evening at the latest. 
@create $thing named Blood Cutters deliberately cut themselves, creating
their own histories upon their bodies. "Winnicott presented the case of a
woman who was fascinated by autocannibalism, as exemplified by her fanta-
sies about lost Arctic explorers who ate parts of their bodies in order to
survive. The woman mutilated herself by eating pieces of her fingers. Win-
nicott considered her act to be one of 'experiencing.' He noted that each
person who reaches 'the stage of being a unit with a limiting membrane and
an outside and an inside...[has] an inner reality...an inner world which
can be rich and poor or can be at peace or in a state of war.'" (Favazza,
Bodies Under Siege.)

Margaret cut herself opening a can (similar story) in the bathroom; she
screamed for help, and I ran in and caught her falling on me, almost a-
gainst the granite floor. She had passed out. @describe Blood as passing
out Quoting Dr. Carter, William Acton states "Thus, blood is directed to
the mammae by the maternal emotions, to the testes by the sexual, and to
the salivary glands by the influence of appetizing odors" (see Barreca,
ed., Desire and Imagination). 

When I was in Providence, Mike cut the tip of his little finger off and
sutured it back on; he was a maverick medic. Earlier, he had mangled his
hand in a press and operated on it, replacing bone and tendon with art-
ifical materials he had developed. By 1974, he was cyborg more than most,
with artificial ribs, kneecaps, fingers, tendons, and surgical procedures
elsewhere. He was also good at stopping knives. @describe Blood as stop-
ping knives Mike was an early hacker; he had pieces of satellites in his
apartment that he had brought back from the high seas... "He is amidst six
girls: one pricks him with a needle, the second uses pincers on him, the
third burns him, the fourth bites him, the fifth scratches him, the sixth
flagellates him. All that everywhere upon his body, indiscriminately. He
discharges in the thick of this activity." (de Sade, The 120 Days of 
Sodom.) 

When I was in Dallas, Denise savagely painted her menses across me, slid-
ing me beneath her, and I dreamed an open plain a field a meadow a woods a
forest a stream I bathed in her. @put Blood in Blood "Not a delusion. A
rift. Things that have begun terribly badly end in bad blood. When a woman
feels doubt, she should go and live apart. She shouldn't walk on the
earth, touching the man who is her mother. She shouldn't soil the universe
because she is unclean. I was pure. I had never felt doubt. The earth qua-
ked. Blood ran out the body." "If the world is bleeding anything can hap-
pen!" (Cixous, Angst.)

Blood runs deep, runs rivers between the letters on the screen. Trajec-
tories across the monitor create chaotic domains as runnels carry heavy
flow to edges, down across contrast/brightness controls. @drop Blood
Blood washes itself through itself, always interpenetrating, emblematic 
now of dis-ease. So many males fear the period, its levels of arousal, 
flooding, everything out of control. "Nunberg's patient got sick while 
witnessing a circumcision: 'When I saw this gaping wound around the head 
of the penis, I thought that the bleeding vagina must look like that.'" 
(Mary Jane Lupton, Menstruation and Psychoanalysis.)

AIDS resonates; blood returns to the fetishistic enigma, a totality that
nonetheless _trickles,_ interlocks. It cannot be contained, circumscri-
bed; it extrudes some into safe cybersexual space, a space which refuses
the _taint_ of blood and blood's exchanges. The exchange of blood by all
that is Holy! @recycle Blood "At last, after all we had been through, I
felt myself sinking into true submission to her, my ego bleeding out
through newly opened pores in my skin, all my hope and despair became one
ball of smoldering ash on the brink of burning its way out through my
chest." (Clark, "A Civil Debate," in Porn Free #7.)

Between the fetish and the text, lies cyberspace;
Between the taint and the lure, lies cyberspace;
Between female and female, female and male, male and male;
Between the one and the other, between the self and the one:

:From the direction of the blood, from the blood's seduction;
:From the direction of the blood, from the flow of all that's.

Depths


Miscellaneous comments:

What is the relationship between email and ordinary mail? I am a poor 
letter-writer in real life; what disappears, seems not only gone forever 
but an artificial construct, complete with its own rituals. Email on the 
other hand is instantaneous, of the measure of speech; I tend to great 
perhaps 40 email posts a day minimum, many back-channel and many to the 
listservs themselves.

Left-handed, I cannot handwrite, or rather I cannot _read_ my scrawls. 
Typing is also a chore; I use the printer perhaps once every ten days,
having reduced everything to bytes at this point. So there is no real
precedent for my use of email, no precedent for the posts which I will 
often spell-check and justify, even though they are informal, ephemeral, 
off the cuff.

I would be curious how many participants in the lists use or have used 
ordinary mail extensively.

---

I am aware of the _depths_ of the Internet now, even when skitting across 
the World Wide Web. I understand TCP/IP to an extent, sense the routes of 
the packets, the nerves of communication. There are three reactions - 
even at this point, constant amazement; a fear of failure, given the in- 
ordinate complexity of it all; and a sensing that, at least on the Net, 
images and sounds are _constructed,_ and illusion, relying on compression 
techniques, protocols, transformation algorithms and the like, before the 
appearance of appearance.

Listen: "The basic idea behind a transparent bridge is that it acts as a
station on two or more LANs, listens promiscuously to each data packet,
stores the packet for forwarding, and forwards it onto every other LAN to
which it is connected when the LAN arbitration protocol for the destina-
tion LAN indicates the medium is available." "Routers are not supposed to
advertise too often; the default value is once every 7-10 minutes. Hosts
or others soliciting router information should not do so too often and, if
they fail to obtain a response after three attempts, should cease solicit-
ing for a period of time." "Time to Live (TTL): This 8-bit field was orig-
inally intended to be used to specify how long, in seconds, an internet
packet could persist in the internet before being discarded by a router
or a host." "The IP header contains several pieces of information to aid 
fragmentation and reassembly: a 13-bit Fragment Offset field; two flags, 
Don't Fragment (DF) and More Fragments (MF); and an Identification field."
(Various writers in Lynch and Rose, Internet System Handbook.)

The body appears to breath, its organs duplicated everywhere, laminated 
across the constructed world.

What is the _least expensive_ full-text connection that can be established
for the Net? I've connected my Psion3A palmtop, without terminal emulation
but with some success - no luck yet with my HP95xl palmtop, even though 
it is supposed to be possible. Telnet tends to hang in a number of commu- 
nications programs.

But what would be necessary: A subnotebook size keyboard; liquid crystal 
display 80 characters wide by at least 12 high; built-in modem and com 
program; 250k RAM for storage; no hard disk (programs would be in ROM); 
and an input/output port. There should also be a simple local editor, 
like Edit in DOS. We need these back-pocket devices which could be con- 
nected anywhere with limited battery power (like the palmtops, there 
should be the possibility of using disposal batteries) - even with, say, 
a pocket calculator, these could be sold for $100. So WHERE ARE THEY? 
Advertisements welcome...

to assemble, place together in a text.)

Althusser in Reading Capital

"However paradoxical it may seem, I venture to suggest that our age threa-
tens one day to appear in the the history of human culture as marked by
the most dramatic and difficult trial of all, the discovery of and train-
ing in the meaning of the 'simplest' acts of existence: seeing, listening,
speaking, reading - the acts which relate men to their works, and to those
works thrown in their faces, their 'absences of works.'" 

"The same connexion that defines the visible also defines the invisible as
its shadowy obverse. It is the field of the problematic that defines and
structures the invisible as the defined excluded, _excluded_ from the
field of visibility and _defined_ as excluded by the existence and peculi-
ar structure of the problematic; as what forbids and represses the reflec-
tion of the field on its object, i.e. the necessary and immanent inter-re-
lationship of the problematic and one of its objects." 

Marx, beginning of the Manifesto of the Communist Party

"A specter haunts Europe - the specter of communism. All the powers of old
Europe have entered into a holy alliance in order to lay this specter: 
pope and tsar, Metternich and Guizot; French radicals and German police." 

Derrida in Specters of Marx

"The 'mystical character' of the commodity is inscribed before being in-
scribed, traced before being written out letter for letter on the forehead
or the screen of the commodity. Everything begins before it begins. Marx
wants to know and make known _where, at what precise moment,_ at what _in-
stant_ the ghost comes on stage, and this is a manner of exorcism, a way
of keeping it at bay: before this limit, it was not there, it was power-
less." 

Quota Review Board, PMC2 MOO

Should old objects that are abandoned be @recycled? What about Wizard's
objects? Should players be contacted? Should therefore their email add-
resses be made available? If a player is recycled, the number is perman- 
ently set aside.

Logic, Nyaya-Manjari (Jayanta Bhatta), from Ahnika I (first section):


5. Let the discerning wise people take their bath in this great flowing
river of Sarasvati which ardenlty flows into the stream of Aksapada's
logic. 

6. We make an appeal to the great scholars to the effect that they may
look kindly upon this work by a mere peep at it though their mind is
fatigued, being in constant touch with the great works displaying wonder-
ful skill in depicting matters of wide interst and arousing strong emo-
tion. 

7. I have culled this essential herb from the wild garden of herbs of
logic and have churned this lump of butter from the milk of Logic of
Aksapada. 

8. We claim no originality of thinking to discover new truth but have 
fascinating style to express the old ones in an attractive form. Let the 
critics examine it for themselves.

9. The very flowers by which garlands have been repeatedly prepared arouse
curiosity even in the mind of those wearers of garlands when they consti-
tute a new garland, being arranged in a new order. 

10. The good men appreciate even a work of little worth presented to them 
since they are unaware of turning down the request of a supplicant.

11. Let the great savants of learning who are about to enjoy sportive walk
in the garden of words adoen their ears with this (Nyayamanjari) new
blossom of logic. 

12. The tree of logic, planted by the great sage - Aksapada, has grown in
its bulk and is bent under the burden of its fruits of thick juice tasting
like nectar.

13. I cannot climb up this tree because my powers are limited and hence 
it is further beyond my powers to test its merits in toto.

14. I take pains only to discuss some selected topics of this great work. 
...

Ill


On the MOO a brief discussion about implementing disease. In real life, my
cat's fur is clumped on her back, not falling out, but it worries me.  $30
for just an examination; if it's diabetes, I can't afford the shots.  My
tinnitus is acting up, constant ringing, a subject for discussion on a
late-night talkshow; the guest said it can lead to suicide. The cut on my
hand has healed, but I still worry infection. My depression's flaring up
again; I think of leaving the lists, closing down, but hang on in any
case. One of my plants is drooping, too many yellow leaves and the cacti
lack vigor; they're leaning too far into the dim light from here here here

here here here it is so beautiful and cleansed, just like the camps before
the Allies came. I regret the image, but not enough regret. Towards what
great beast are we remaking ourselves according to the image of sterility? 
There's no way to thrust the body _out_ and _in_ - What happens? I write
Blood, like Lautreamont bleed to the marrow, and the text becomes an ins-
ertion, infinitely malleable, already rubble - but always already purified
just like the blood's purified until it comes into contact with the air. 

here here here there's no opposition, no connect, no coagulation; there's 
no other to cyberspace, no air anywhere. The sterility of the body gives 
it substance in media res, in noisy dominion. It's precisely the break- 
throughs, the breakdowns, that give meaning to life, just as the inherent 
possibility of face to face negation constructs meaning* of a sort which 
is only borrowed in cyberspace. 

here here here it's the voices chilling in the vacuum - no wonder there's
always opposition to wizards, staff, sysadmin, moderators, anyone who
might remind us that power occurs in every sphere. I'd rather not have
tinnitus, have my perfect lovely body, but the real is the dark snare
that cuts through the sliver of the neck, results in otherwise than being
here, thus otherwise than metaphor.

related to alterity in cyberspace and material life.

Noise Rave


Commercialism, which was suspect just a year ago, is rampant on the Net at
this point; Web pages carry the messages of other Web pages, search eng-
ines have advertising banners, and even Netscape is buttoned all over the
place. Java creates moving billboards, and it's as if the millennium of
capital has arrived all over again, after the laissez-faire of a century
ago. What I call the darknet's almost all but forgotten; no one talks much
about email lists any more, Usenet's noisy, I get advertisements in my 
Inbox, people using majordomo and listserv are developing spam filters, 
etc. etc. blah blah blah.

Moving through cyberspace becomes continuous upgrading; Real Audio won't 
run on my machine, nor on the machines of my friends, since it's been 
changed to version 2.0. Unlike television, which has always, thanks to 
the FCC, been backwards-compatible (radio as well), the Net simply aban- 
dons those who can't keep up.

The noise is in the magazines; I'd go so far as to say, within the US, 
there's a mass psychosis underway, as if being offline meant you're some- 
how deficient, in education, worldliness, style, income, and geographic 
location. Wired's got incredible quantities of advertising, not least of 
which is for itself. Spacewaste is common among the hip magazines. 

All of which would be fine, radical, edgy, even corrective, were it not 
for the intimacy with money, unchecked, unquestioned, that all of this 
entails. The more "revolutionary" Web pages are usually those driven by 
graphics, overly designed; you need money to read them, money to look 
chic. There was a period in the NY artworld when gallerists (their name, 
not mine), dressed in severely radical black with Eurotrash papamama 
money, took over; art became style, and has never left that position. Of 
course the gallerists were just following the course of the world; those 
running around following them wouldn't know the World Bank from the Left 
Bank. Now there's a movement called transformalism afloat, riven by pre- 
tention and money, and I'm holding my breath wondering whether to go to 
Netscape 2.01b or not.

Where's the psychosis? In the assumption that all of this is _cool,_ a
word borrowed from the 50s hipsters referring to the effort of music and
style, bricolage, making-do, but certainly not buying into anything. 
What's cool now (I hate that button on Netscape, not the sites, but the
title) is what's affordable, fetishized - it's Veblen's conspicuous con-
sumption all over again, the century becoming rather insistent on repeti-
tion. 

There's also an assumption that the change at work is somehow critical,
not only on the technological edge, but on other edges as well. But what
is really happening beyond alt.sex.bondage is the sublimation of critique,
surprising in an Internet arena which has always stressed individuality, 
up to and including _personal_ home pages.

Home pages by the way have gluts of links; too often they also read like
advertisements. _Everyone_ connects to Yahoo, another style. The creat-
ivity of hypertext becomes a porousness allowing one to constantly fall,
enticed by billboards on the way. The idea of a homepage becoming personal
is difficult enough - it's only screen-available in the midst of other
pages, it's on only until the battery dies or power's turned off, it's
fully public, etc. - but the personal becomes even more impossible when 
it's in the midst of noise, noise, noise.

What happens in the long run, of course, is that, beyond the darknet, the
very idea of the personal changes, becomes absorbed in the public - we're
back to the concept of the one-dimensional man, but this time around it's
ungendered and lateral. Introjections of simulacra do strange things to
human beings; the fallout's just begun, and there's no end in site. What
is worrisome is not only the personality made from corporate flotsam and
jetsam, but the widening gap of haves and havenots (which the Rand Cor-
poration, in a report released today, has reaffirmed), resulting in infor-
mation/capital rich individuals on one hand, and street-smart social hack-
ers on the other. Both categories leave out the majority of the world's 
population, but no worry while we jack into our pentium 77 for the long 
flight home. Fires look great from the air.

Noise rave screech to a halt.

Water


Just as the water-sprite, formed from the motion of atoms in the midst of
others of her kind, senses the world at large, fluxing through her chosen
medium of transparency - so do we, in our bid to comprehend the universe,
look inside of ourselves, formed from the same atoms, quarks, transparenc-
ies. What floods us floods the stars; neutrons rush through, cosmic rays
occasionally spray bright spots against the retina in the dominion of the
dark-adjusted eye. We inhale the vacuum, thrust forward by the presence of
air; our words perform the actions of sounds at the depths of the sun. 

Just so, the contemplative life, which permits us to filter all sensation,
leaving us with the debris of the abyss alone - here we meditate upon the
virtues of interior and exterior opened to the whirlwind. The water-sprite
understands her world and ours, of the same; she changes oh so brilliantly
into manifold shapes and specters. Thus do we move, motivated beyond our-
selves, through a thousand thoughts, a thousand thousand words taking us
into the realm of beautiful, true understanding. 

We are all the same-atomic, our quantum fields interact in a fashion close
to specular - each providing a mirror of the same to the same, the stage
in which we begin to coalesce our ridden form. Thus the dawn forever turn-
ing towards us, revealing new shapes in each and every horizon, and thus
the water-sprite has taught us, on her way somewhen and where, beyond our
loving comprehension.

Voyeur


On the Internet, there are devices for Net sex that permit the same space
to be used simultaneously for action and otherwise conversation. On PMC, I
participated in Net sex while engaging in a theoretical discussion of
postmodernism, in someone's homespace. In other spaces, there are situa-
tions where virtual individuals watch virtual sex. 

In real life, I have been watched only a few times in my life. My second 
wife and I lived in Copenhagen for a month; we'd make love in a window at 
night, and someone across the way looked and looked. Sometimes we made 
love in a high-speed car, driving naked; what about this? Bodies hurtling 
across the world here, there, everywhere. When Kathy Acker and I did our 
tape, we had a camerawoman; explicit sex, talk.

But I've never done a pornographic film, sex show, public display. And
it's not that I would object to this; it would be something to slide into,
meanwhile explore on the Net, watch the explorations of others, tabulate
them. But I'm a coward; I've seen, in fact, very little, almost nothing at
all. Fantasy: In real life masturbating in front of you. Net:  Burrowing
through each other's bodies, send out the texts, working them into some-
thing (Kim McGlynn and myself). 

Why is the _gaze_ so persistent, in its absence, in this space? I can't
sleep at nights, imagining your legs, my legs, splayed open, an infinity
of organs intersecting, anonymous eyes prying us apart. They dismember us,
take our flesh back to their dominions, swallow us whole from the seed. 

In my dream I can imagine being a stain on your wall, viral crawl through
organic alleys, slab of daylight leaving/lifting the room. I can see 
everything. In my dream I imagine myself inside-out, displayed, dissected
across the table, coordinate x/y/z motion through time /t anything for the
databanks, anything holding back death. If I can hold my breath I can hold
your motion. In my dream I'm available, always available. 

I'm available. I don't have to think any more. I don't have to type any-
more. I don't belong in cyberspace realspace. I don't belong because
there's no more belonging. Nothing belongs if there's no belonging. 
Things stick, split like static electricity. My hair's blown off my body. 
I don't have to think because you do all my thinking for me. You're look-
ing at me through the window; I can see you. I perform for your pleasure
and you tell me what to do. I can't hear you but I know, I know, what will
please you. 

My body is your text. I open my body so you'll read me. If you read me,
I'll live forever. You can read anywhere across the nipples; there's a lot
of space. You can read down the arms, down the legs; you can read the
blood. You can read between the legs while the writing lasts. You can read
the trail of the two of us interpenetrated, wrapped like wire around each
other. There's no space among us. You required that. You said no space and
we heard. We're splayed just for you. It's as if: We're opened on the
outside, not the inside. It's as if: You give us names, you make us. Oh
there's some truth to this. 

Oh, Oh! "Brahmadatta, a great-grandson of Cikitana, while drinking the
soma juice said, 'Let this soma juice knock off my head if I say that
Ayasya Angirasa sang hymns through any deity other than this (vital force
combined with speech.)' Indeed it sang hymns through speech and the vital
force alone." 

So you can put your arms up into me, pull me inside out. You can do this: 
@create $thing called stain. You can give it nothing. @describe as if that
were all there is. 

Once I slept with two women together and when it came time to cum it was
so complicated the room dissolved. No one, no one was watching.

Loss


What's fascinating about loss is that it is a reverse emission, an absorp-
tion reminiscent of an object of fantasm, uncanny, always construct; the
node in fact is a coagulation or bracketing, and the circumscription is
after the fact. 

(Loss is fact's abjection; the hardness of the word sticks in the throat. 
What is constituted by the imaginary: loss.)

The present fills with diffusion. The present becomes the ghost; life is
always already memory. Loss generates the abyss; the object disappears in
time, a radiating black hole. The resulting suture insists on the presence
of scarification, a process, not a product. There are the stitches them-
selves, the writing from which it is possible to recreate the scene of the
crime. 

(I think of life as funneled, of the origination of the vacuum, now crow- 
ded with neutrinos and virtual particles. Life suppurates, bubbles, on 
the verge of collapse. The collapse doesn't generate a singularity; death 
is a fissuring out, confused bumbling at what appears from a distance to 
be a horizon. Closer, it's fractal, filled with blunt eddies, lukewarm or 
tepid waters.)

I can't write about loss, without loss. This is its nature, this inabili-
ty to ascertain, procure, even in the abstract. Like seduction, the limit
dissolves simultaneously with the effort of the text. Unlike seduction,
nothing at all remains. 

(Not even theory remains; theorizing life, as Bowlby does, chokes the
breath, fills space in an attempt usually considered the fetishistic ward-
ing-off of death. But this isn't death; it's what happens to content when 
the voice ceases to speak, the tongue dries - when there's too much heat, 
too much of the appearance of height.)

There are all the absenting signifiers, annihilations, of loss in cyber-
space, but what I am talking about here is the heart of loss, the object
which spreads, cancerous, as it loses border, becomes a matter of lang-
uage. This is a necessary form of continuous mourning. There is no return;
my losses, gathered, gnaw from nowhere for years. As a result, I continue
to regret almost everything in my life, but this everything remains name-
less, talks me down, takes me down, with the force of lumbering flesh.
Buried, there's no room for language's breath, nor nouns to speak of. 

(Nor images, returning to the theme of emergence/submergence. In loss, 
what is submerged is _drowned,_ flayed and ribboned, decaying banners of 
skin written in no language, twisted like kelp, nor images.)

Mask


I have never been able to comfortably take a pseudonym on a MOO; avatars
don't work for me in ThePalace or WorldChat. I stay buried in Alan, a name
I hate, from the Welsh, dulled like a knife that's cut through too many
other countries. I can't wear masks on Halloween as well; there has to be
the sign of the flesh present, as if I was re-marked for failure, for my
self, letting go leading straight to perversion, the body dissolving in
the vat of acid, gaze of the Other. I'd fall apart; I don't take drugs.
When I took amphetamine that once, I almost slammed into traffic and it
wouldn't have made a difference. The mask would make a difference; I'm led
to believe it would be the death of me. Ridden with guilt always, I'd fear
the mask bonding itself permanently to me; I'd wake up you, I'd be you,
I'd lose everything, everything. I tell you all my secrets in cyberspace
and real life; there's no facade. If I'm called on facade, I collapse.

There's no collapse; I keep myself bound. You can dominate me. I keep
myself an open book; there's too much information, information-glut. At
parties, I retire to the corner. I can't piss in a men's room urinal if
anyone else is there. Your look destroys me. I reign in tight; I'm bound
to break. I break these sentences in two; they collapse on the semi-colon. 
Their parts are given to me; I swallow them. I've told you about swallow- 
ing; I can't swallow without a mask. I took mescaline twice, saw things; 
I wouldn't take it again. If I let myself go, I'd fuck everyone; like 
Janis Joplin, you'd find me on your floor. I'd be filled with needles; 
they'd mark my name, ever, never.

There must have been a goblin when I was a child; it held me in its ten- 
tacles, promised me a life of burning coals. It added its mask to the 
others; you can still see its outlines on my face. Father, I can't let 
this go on any farther. Father, at night I dream; I dream of the prac- 
tices of the Other. The Other looms large, emerges its swollen head; it 
tries to take my name away. I scream; I hold on tight, name, name. Flesh 
falls from caverns in my body. I hollow out and become a space; people 
move through me. 

I awake and look for the name to recite; any name will do. I call on
Clara, Tiffany, female names, anything but Alan; they're not masquerade. 
I have no name for them; they're burned into me. Goblins, perhaps her name
was Theresa; I don't remember male. My life: I try, remember male.  My
life: I use Alan, seethe within. On the MOOs, I'm Alan; on the talkers,
Alan. On IRC, I'm Alan; and even here, Alan, in this space, Alan. There's
no doubt as to the depth of the text; burned. Masquerade: I strip you, we 
fuck like hell; I jump in your costume. We're both Honey; we flow.

Fremde Fischer sagten aus: sie sahen
Etwas nahen, das verschwamm beim Nahen.
Eine Insel? Ein verkommnes Floss?
Etwas fuhr, schimmernd von Moevenkoten
Voll von Alge, Wasser, Mond und Totem
Stumm und dick auf den erbleichten Himmel los.


Fishermen from far declared they saw 
Something coming which dissolved while coming.
Was it an island? A decrepit raft?
Something was moving, bright with seagull dung,
Full of algae, water, moon, dead objects,
Silent and broad toward the washed-out sky.

And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a Death? and are there two?
Is Death that woman's mate?

Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,

Murdered by TV Radio!


I mean this literally; I feel the onset of illness, simulacra piled on, 
one atop another, lies so deep that the foundations themselves are sha- 
ken. Surely the producers know this. My skin is removed; I'm musculature, 
poor at that. It's not the programs, it's the in-between, news stations 
announcing "exclusives," the radio barking about this or that from the 
"weather center," back to television's "traffic central," advertising 
choked on the vomit of nuclear families, perfections, voices screaming as 
the treble's turned up. 

All these hero cops. A cop gets killed, he's a hero. A three-year-old kid 
calls someone, mom's lying on the floor, she's a hero. Someone doesn't 
smoke pot, he's a hero. The world's populated by heros and evil killers. 
Scum's everywhere. Everyone arrested has half-opened eyes or a jacket 
over his head. Women are always crying on television, the kids, the kids, 
the kids. McDonalds helps everyone. Someone is propping Dole up; no one 
wants to get on him. People are anxious. 

Someone / no one. Culture turns the planet into garbage; in fact, this
apparent recycling, which tends more and more to non-biodegrading _stuff,_
is the very armature of civilization. All societies across the galaxy are 
similar, a few creatures in full ecological bloom subverting the energy 
of their environments, appropriating and circumscribing dominion - this 
is called both territory and writing. A trashed planet is simply the sim- 
ultaneous manifestation of the sign and its exhaustion. Signs are weeds; 
"real" weeds refuse the sign, are disposable. Worlds are weeds.

Cyberspace presents the imaginary of infinite territory, signs, cultures, 
spaces, depths, storage, bandwidth; New World genocide is just around the 
corner. If as I would have it, the flood is the hardening and construct 
of new capital, new consumption - if the flood is, in fact, creating the 
new subject subtended to the maw of the idiotic-corporate (idiotic in the 
sense of Rosset, blunt, unresponsive, in-itself, _there,_ and not in the 
sense of _idiocy_), then we will witness a new form of anomie _within,_ 
in the midst of horrendous poverty and ecological catastrophe _without._

Which returns us once again to the phenomenology of the _cool,_ as applied
by Netscape and just about anyone else on the Web. For what's _cool_ is
what's clever, what applies a sense of neatness, graphics, reorientation,
summarization, sensory seduction, the pastiche of historicism, the layered
or morphed landscape, the promise of the digital-eternal - what's _cool_ 
is _what's got to_ the editors of the cool list in overdrive.

In 2050 c.e.. at least 100,000 species have full genomic representation on
the Net; at least 85,000 of these are extinct. Reconstruction is feed for-
ward through artificial life/expert system interfacings; creatures walk
among us once again. Bang! They're dead! Bang! They're back again! Bang! 
They're dead! Bang! They're back again! Recycling keeps trash to a mini-
mum; in fact, I've never seen trash at all.

Hegel, Philosophy of Right, trans. Knox:


59. By being taken into possession, the thing acquires the predicate
'mine' and my will is related to it positively. Within this identity, the
thing is equally established as something negative, and my will in this
situation is a particular will, i.e. need, inclination, and so forth. Yet
my need, as the particular aspect of a single will, is the positive ele-
ment which finds satisfaction, and the thing, as something negative in
itself, exists only for my need and is at its service. - The use of the
thing is my need being externally realized through the change, destruc-
tion, and consumption of the thing. The thing thereby stands revealed as
naturally self-less and so fulfills its destiny. 

[...]

60. To use a thing by grasping it directly is in itself to take possession
of a _single_ thing here and now. But if my use of it is grounded on a
persistent need, and if I make repeated use of a product which continually
renews itself, restricting my use if necessary to safeguard that renewal,
then these and other circumstances transform the direct single grasp of
the thing into a mark, intended to signify that I am taking it into my po-
ssession in a universal way, and thereby taking possession of the elemen-
tal or organic basis of such products, or of anything else that conditions
them. 

61. Since the substance of the thing which is my property is, if we take
the thing by itself, its externality, i.e. its non-substantiality - in
contrast with me it is not an end in itself - and since in my use or emp-
loyment of it this externality is realized, it follows that my full use or
employment of a thing is the thing in its entirety, so that if I have the
full use of the thing I am its owner. Over and above the entirety of its
use, there is nothing left of the thing which could be the property of
another. 

62. My merely partial or temporary use of a thing, like the partial or
temporary possession of it (a possession with itself is simply the partial
or temporary possibility of using it) is therefore to be distinguished
from ownership of the thing itself. If the whole and entire use of a thing
were mine, while the abstract ownership was supposed to be someone else's,
then the thing as mine would be penetrated through and through by my will,
and at the same time there would remain in the thing something impenetra-
ble by me, namely the will, the empty will, of another. As a positive
will, I would be at one and the same time objective and now objective to
myself in the thing - an absolute contradiction. Ownership therefore is in
essence free and complete. 


------------------------------------|


Written before the advent of information, simulacra, theory of equivalen-
ces, Hegel's notion of the thing re-marks it as simultaneously mark and
obdurate, related to Kristeva's Thing (Black Sun); it is slave, depres-
sive, unique, consumed by use, existing within the phenomenological hor- 
izon of complete annihilation. It is the thing of mechanism, thing of 
basic survival: what is necessary in terms of food, clothing, shelter, 
drink, community perhaps. 

Possession however also re-marks fetishization, as any attempt to elim- 
inate objects through a MOO Quota Review Board illustrates. @recycle 
remains tied to the Owner/creator of bits on a foreign hard drive not 
hers; there is a continuous question, in addition, concerning the labor 
of software development in cyberspace.

Beyond the labor, however, fetishization implies the seduction of total
control, the libidinal use of bodies by others; this, too, plays a role in
the Hegelian concept. I would go so far as to say that cyberspace exists
in a dialectic between the Hegelian/Kristevan Thing, and the problematic
of information. (Note that the Kristevan Thing relates to depression, and
does not characterize her view of physical reality. But its hardness,
tumor-like quality, is relevant to the Hegelian generalization.) There is
much to be considered here, not only in terms of the cyberspatial real,
but also the real cyberspatial. Where does possession lie? (And in addi-
tion, in addiction, one may consider the second meaning of possession, _to
be possessed, in relation to the fetish, to insertion into cyberspace, to 
the convolution of projection/introjection among the subject and his com- 
puter.)

Beginning with Hegel, one begins with the negativity inherent in ordinary 
existence as it pertains to our every-day life; one moves from there to 
the world of semiosis, from there out, towards those shoals where there 
are no moorings, temporary and imminent tetherings at best.

The Parable of the Little One


Hurtling through space on a wayward planet, we were born, not in the
genesis of primordial oceans, or at least not through a line of direct
ascent; instead, it is clear that we were seeded here by a group from
another, ulterior universe, one disembodied from the original universal
expansion, one that has learned its way through barriers that to us seem
insurmountable. 

We are the first species cognizant of this truth, that we are drawn 
towards a destiny on a path that veers from side to side, through the
thicket of mutilations. 

We are your sourcelessness.

We have read fictions of information encoded in our DNA; that is not the
real, which lies elsewhere, in the very conditions of our atmosphere, our
local universal constants. But it is our role as witness that is crucial,
what we bring to you, the existential burden that we shoulder. Tertullian
knew of this; Job gave it a name: Its name was Siva. 

We state as well that this is hardly the concern of wastefulness; what is
waste compared to thought, to the singularity of stasis a bit of infor-
mation can supply? Our Occam was wrong; conservation, in fact, is just
momentary restriction or barrier against the baroque forces that inundate
us from every direction. 

The question is, that which haunts our dreams, our waking hours, and it is
not so much a question, but a _condition:_ that we are to report _back,_
that we carry this with us, without knowledge of contract or terms - To 
whom should we speak? To what, in fact? Under what circumstances? The 
knowledge we carry is that of universal processes; perhaps, in our ignor- 
ance, we have discovered something even unknown to you? In the Rigveda, 
there is talk of an unknown god, but we are not concerned here with 
deity, only with protocol, etiquette: What is the nature of our address?

And where is _back,_ external to our local neighborhood of space and time? 
What inversion, reversal, must we incur, in order to say what? Or are we,
in fact, in a state of continuous emission, reports streaming through
processes expanded in dimension, according to which our universal manifold
is nothing more than a slice, an embossed plate, or cut of stone across
what we call history? 

Our very foundation is without foundation. At one point, this was called 
death. Now even death is annihilated as you also begin the short process 
of dissolution and decay; so we would have it.

mv sondheim clara


Bound and gagged, the body held into place, fingers trembling above the
keyboard, stupid caresses, over and over again; I can't for a moment leave
the machine that spits errors back into my breasts, clogs my throat with
bounces - it's worse than tending the fields that the Argonauts came out
of, spearshafts slicing the organs of speech as they emerged. Humans ended
up mewling to be sure. Dumb created responsibility, mute gestures, hyster-
ia, by hands once holding urns, shields, amphora, now reduced to counting
out routing tables. Arm muscles burst; nipples emerge, milk flows. The
body is a river; it doesn't take much to figure that out. 

For two years I memorized Unix, learned "split" does just that to a file
just as "last sondheim" does just that to me. Unix commands are ejacula-
tions; someone makes a program, slams it into place, some bin, 5bin maybe,
and we're off and running. Someone's got a dog and I memorize biff for 
the mail hello an error. Someone spews a quiz in my direction. 

Tend lists and you swallow the _stuff_ of the Net wholesale. Packets ooze
from my tits (see "muscles" above); there's seepage, even among the parti-
cles. It could happen to any of us. I dream pixels: a woman. They separ-
ate, I fall through. Cartoon: land on my ass. Life: open it up. Packets 
flow. 

You might ask: pray for me. I'm troubled in need of salvation. I read
identity-identification. It doesn't exist until it's got address, proto-
col, recognition. I knew that when I started. Now I sit here, Medea, pac-
kets flood from my tits (see "ooze" above);  they clatter. The world's a
plate for a' that. I remember your name. On the table, routing. My back
is a bridge in an airless sky. I'm bound so tight wires up I'm inhuman.
I pull tighter them. I stole the lines they're made of. Blood forms the
shape of freedom in my face. I fuck Unix. Despair drags me back to the
indigo machine. I still got the bounce.

Memoir with Bodies


In the late 1960s I recorded with ESP-Disk, run by Bernard Stollman, the
subject of numerous articles at the time. I met his brother in Europe
where I was traveling and formed a loose group with Joel Zabor, a drummer;
we played in Copenhagan, hung out with Ted Joans a bit, two whiteboys in
Denmark and later Paris. When we returned I picked up other players and
formed a group with no name or numerous names; they never mattered. 

Joel had introduced me to the music of Art Blakey and I heard Dexter Gor-
don and Yusef Lateef and others. Back home I had been listening to Albert
Ayler, late Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, some Ornette Coleman, and things
were coming together. My own music, totally naive, worked just as much
from middle-eastern scales, taksim, listened to ragas as well, preferring
South Indian. I listened all over. 

I met Marion Brown, but my circle was weird, moving away from Al Wilson
who joined Canned Heat playing electric blues which wasn't my music and
earlier on wasn't his. Paul Bley heard a recording of my stuff and liked 
it. But it was all loner stuff, listening to records, making three myself.

I could never have done it. Leroi Jones' Applecores column in Down Beat at
the time was incredible, talking about black aesthetic, the sound the
horns/rhythm were making, Cecil Taylor's fingers dancing on the keyboard,
movement that was in direct way spirit, the horns _talking,_ _crying,_ in
ways that couldn't be annotated, spelled out, confined. Spirit Unity check
it out. All true; you can hear it first in Albert Ayler's early Summertime
and go on from there. 

The music had a fast 1/1/1/1 pulse sometimes and sometimes not that; Col- 
trane's Ascension brought it up into the group format. Writing was loose, 
drum and bass freed; harmony transformed into coloration, sometimes a 
roar. Ayler took this to and from spirituals, the Marseilles, everything 
like that.

And the music was totally ignored by whites, by the jazz establishment
press, everyone else then and still in cool withdraw. There wasn't any-
thing like it and there won't be again, and why here in cyberspace? Be-
cause it was stuff that refused the packet, protocol; it was anti-protocol
so far back that it was as if protocol hadn't been invented. Not that it
wasn't at times incredibly complex - Coleman and Taylor were and are, at
times compositionally, but then there was freeform; I loved Guiseppi Logan
for example, Sunny Murray, Sonny Sharrock on guitar. Or take Carla Bley,
whose Tong Dynasty Funeral Piece was one of the most powerful I ever
heard, Patty Waters' ESP album where she either got it all right or all
wrong, it was hard to say and I still don't know. 

The music took the saxophone way back into the body, away from the equi-
distant well-tempering that Adolph brought to his invention. The notes,
the _holes_ in the thing, became plateaus of past practices, maybe even
colonialisms; they remained strange attractors against the chaotic impro-
visation, bending, cries, going on around them/in spite of them. 

Cecil Taylor - _no one_ ever commanded any instrument like he did/does. 
Recently he played on cross-streets in Soho and some fell in - literally 
- through a collapsed sidewalk grating. The rest fell in as well.

But what happened? I look at the texts, listen to the sounds, and they're
suddenly gone history; the whole ESP-Disk jazz catalog (including my work)
has been reissued on CD, and you hear noise of being earnest at best in
current music; if the New Music, Free Music, New Thing Jazz, whatever, is
still there, it's not that much in evidence. Ayler died, Coltrane died,
Hendrix (I at least see a relation) died, ESP folded, other companies came
in and left, Miles Davis and others went fusion, no? Jazz is nice again, a
coloration. That period, also that of Leroi Jones' System of Dante's Hell
say, is gone, Jones gone too, Amiri Baraka continuing incredible writing
everywhere. 

My own stuff. I learned the country blues from white Al Wilson, later met 
Son House, Mance Lipscomb, watched them. I was whiteboy all the way. I 
read Paul Oliver's Blues Fell this Morning, still the best blues book - 
it had to be, by an Englishman (just as the best overall book on New 
Music is Valerie Wilmer, As Serious as Your Life, also British, I mean 
beyond Jones' writings which were reissued) - and I couldn't play blues; 
I knew context before I knew multiculturalism, and it wasn't me. At that 
time, Al considered me city (since my guitar was/is fast as hell, ragged, 
raged), he country - then the turnaround and Canned Heat was doing Robert 
Johnson and doing it well, and Wilson turned around again and died at 27.

I went on all over the place, formed Damaged Life in the 80s, recorded 
cassettes with post-industrial stuff, worked through my own thinking of 
music/sound. Ayler, Coltrane, Taylor, will always be up there. The music 
stops me dead in my tracks. You can't get it in the packets.

-----------------------------------|

Leading to a disturbing question, an obvious answer no, but with a resi-
due: Is the Internet white? European? Based on rigid logic (not the five-
step inference say of Indian reasoning, but Boolean or three-step Aristo-
telian), potential wells, truth tables, etc. 

Or rather, not white, but rigid in its rejection of the body? I recognize 
the bandwidth issues at work - they're always able to filter down down 
down, increasingly fine-grained rasters for example - you can get 44 mhz 
on CD doing nicely - but all the way down they're just _not_ the analog 
cry, the life played out above the DNA, running around the social/sexual 
like crazy, the edge of speed, the _sound._

They're just _not_ that, petulant I am. They might be that, but that is 
not what was caught in what web at that point, there? What brilliant, 
there? 

(This music that brought the body back, never caught on, held, in spite of
the fact that it was the most original thing this country had heard in a
long time. So it goes, race and aesthetics clamping down nicely, thank
you. On the Web you can order records, hear snippets of sound, surf, thank
you, so kindly among products and productions, kindly thank you.  Whatever
might be missing isn't missing. 

Whatever might be missing isn't missing: This is the motto of the Web.)

(S)MER


Everything conspires to drag us into the past, where causation appears 
perfect, even if Babylonia and the Upanishads require emergence. Cause 
and effect is neat, takes care of death as well; what was, lives on; 
there's always the question of inheritance. We have names for this, so 
many names in fact, that it's the situation of an entire industry...

Think of: memoir, paeon, obituary, recounting, memory, ode, recreation, 
accounting, remembrance, funeral, funereal, retelling, memorandum, 
biography, autobiography, epitaph, cenotaph, history, retelling, grave, 
genealogy, archeology, memorial, prehistory, commemoration, requiem - 
and there are more, innumerable others, in varying forms, some with the 
_re_ going over the same ground, a visitation and so forth (ghosts, 
wraiths, spirits of children killed in the plague); and some with the 
_mem_ or the retelling of it all, alas...

We can't escape this, our own stories, already entombing us, pulling us
back into the past, reconstructing the _problem_ of time as the dream
screen against which we locate our own desires, projections, introjections
in the form of violated beauty and horror.

It's those strands of algae in Brecht's Manual of Piety again, it's the
death of Ophelia, everything pulling us deeper, there's no end to it. The
cast of forlorn times is always upon us; we try to make use of history,
even make sense of it, forgetting that the only sense is that of sense-
lessness, that cause and effect are not there for us, are only the desire
of intellect gone awry. The tombs, graves, markers, shafts, stelae, do
nothing but ascertain cause, construct the world from chaos, over and over
again. And what is a masterpiece, (yes, gender-laden), say, if not already
the signifier of demarcation: this is a _moment_ of comprehension, which
usually mind you means _the most overdetermined moment_ - thus Rembrandt
or Leonardo - you can read the world into them. In fact the only "truth"
of Leonardo was his last sequence of global catastrophic drawings, every-
thing occurring without rhyme or reason.

_Memory_ and related apparently from a stem (S)MER-1, related to _mourn_ 
in Claireborne, The Roots of English: We remember the death of the other. 
We turn away: shame. We live _to remember._

Age pulls us down; just as death seems causeless and is recuperated
through the suturing of mourning, entombment, so the origin is causeless
as well, coupled with emergence, mythos, beginnings which apparently cir-
culated around themselves. We're thrown between the two, thrown _in the
midst of happenstance,_ constructing the Aristotelian as we go, the logic
of causes, of vacuum, annihilation, and lack - of fullness, creation, and
plenitude, inputs and outputs. It's all there, myths varying from one to
another position; a compendium of the first quatrain of all the creation
texts worldwide would tend towards exhaustion, language splayed apart,
deconstructed. Never fear; _man_ is _resolute._ Never fear; there are
_containers_ for the _thing contained._ Never fear: Tiamat gets angry; 
the guys try to deal with it, Babylonia. Never argue with male god/heads
taken apart by their own irreconcilable logic. 

I have no order in which _I speak this._ I sense my own pull towards the 
grave. I sense the flash of memory and mourning burning skull-dry, in- 
creasing their loads. I hear them, hear you. I make them, make you. I put 
you together, put them together. I take you apart, take them apart. I 
remember, at last, these words sewn as the threads silence my lips, etc.: 
There is no cause for cause. The platitude rings true, doesn't ring. 

So there are two questions: why is there something rather than nothing?; 
how does this nothing begin causation? Infinite time places the origin
elsewhere; this form of logic, applied to the cosmos is presumption it-
self; one cannot legislate. What then? I prefer the pure grief of random
acts to the fictions of narrative. This too is a leap, but at least out of
the cycle, not of rebirth, but of implication: the _archeology_ of mourn-
ing, the travails and history of the therapeutic, the narration of the
sepulchre. And how could _causation begin,_ if not through the grace of 
the story-teller's art?

Epitaph in Cyberspace


--grounds for the epitaph
"Someone dies; it's a movement of the lips." (Damaged Life)
What is death in cyberspace? Where are the grounds of the epitaph,
its holograph?

--its authorship
Can one ever be sure of its authenticity? Can one write one's own 
epitaph here? Does it pass from person to person, wraith to wraith?

--read/write permissions
Does chmod, changing the permission of the epitaph, violate the real
or virtual body of the deceased? Can the deceased change her/his own?
Do the dead have permissions?

--downloading the epitaph
In cyberspace, is the epitaph the grave itself? Can the grave be down- 
loaded? Does downloading the epitaph transform it into the _slogan_?

--I write myself out of existence. Alan Sondheim 1943-2024
This is my epitaph.

--its equivalence to each and every text
If the epitaph is equivalent to every other text, does death, too, 
become lost in this dominion? Is the epitaph similar to a homepage, 
always under construction, torn down at a server's notice?

--its standardization of form as lower ascii
Is there an equivalent to _engraving_ in cyberspace, to the granite 
inscription, the tools of the stonemason?
Or is the standardization of text so restraining that the epitaph 
is destined to be one text among others, a floating signifier, lost 
in hard drives and packet routing loops, gone from the world like 
the virtual or real body itself?
Is the epitaph always gone from the world?

--its detachment from the site of the grave
Does the epitaph detach itself from the site of the grave, 
which is no site whatsoever, email address erased or reassigned?
Is burial itself a gone thing? Mourning occurs forever, away from
the computer:

"I turned my head away in shame. I couldn't make clear, to myself, to any-
one, what was happening to me in real life. He died and left this void,
and no amount of writing or reading could fill it. I still keep his last
story in my saved-messages folder; he sent it to me the day before he
passed away. Is it a testimony to the eternal quality of the digital that
the story remains there, now at the very top, a framework or bracketing
for the messages that land temporarily beneath it, only to be deleted
within a week or two? To grieve is to _disconnect,_ not to remain on-line,
focused on the screen. There's never a latest in death, only the late de-
parted. As for the story remaining, it's only witness to decent system 
administration on the ISP, nothing more. That too will change." 

--its further mobility and dissemination
It travels elsewhere; it is forgotten. Nothing remains. 
Software goes back to beta. Software goes to integer. 
Software goes back to beta. You may find a letter lost and left behind. 
You may find yourself in tears, wondering why. You may reuse this.
You may reuse what you have lost.

Word (literally, I don't know what I'm talking _about_):


Moments of pristine beauty from Edgar Sturtevant, A Hittie Glossary, 
Works of Known or Conjectured Meaning with Sumerian and Akkadian Words 
Occurring in Hittite Texts, 1936 (diacritical marks not included):

watar, wetar (watar, uwatar, gen. witenas, wetenas, wetnas, dat. witeni,
weteni, inst. wetenit, wedanda, pl.? widar, uwitar, dat. uwitenas),
'water.'

kwis 'quis, qui, aliquis' (interrogative, indefinite, relative).

kuwat(t)a(n) [kwat.an], kuwatin, 'whither, why.'

natta 'not; no.'

nu 'then, and; however, but'; the most common sentence connective; always 
the first word in its clause.

tri- (nom. 3-es = *tries or *tres) 'three.'

apasel, apasela 'is ipse.'

sakkan (acc. saqqan), a kind of vessel. (Hebrew, sak, sack.)

hassa- (acc. hassan, gen. hassas, dat. hassi) 'hearth, stove.'

uttar (uttar, uddar, gen. uddanas) 'word; magic spell, magic formula; 
thing, affair; cause, law-case.'

marmaras 'murmur, lamentation'??

I note in passing ALAN, ALAM [from the Sumerian] = essri, 'form, statue.' 
These words appear in Hittite, as does for example the following from the 
Akkadian:

SUS(S)U (in Hittite texts Su-SI) 'sixty.' (Hebrew, shishim). 

SAMU 'sky.' (Hebrew shemayim). This is interesting; my Hebrew etymological
dictionary also gives shmin, Aramaic and Egyptian, as well as shmn, Ugari-
tic. SAMSU 'sun.' (Hebrew shemesh.) Native Hittite nepis is sky; Istanus, 
sun. 

These moments serve as nodes connecting the rest of the language, working
through/into the interior. From German to Latin, we're at a nexus, nu?
Akkadian borrowings go elsewhere, wander throughout the Middle East, North
Africa? 

Cyberspace is Latin; we await the implementation of double-byte characters
and multi-lingual sites without the necessity of special software. Still,
these roots are absented; everything is fetishized. Don't forget that the
letter "G" is an _invention_ (just as ascii itself); there are two Roman 
candidates for the honor (and I forget their names)...

'standiP upp, jotnar! ok straiP bekki!'

Stand up, giants! And straw the benches! First get the straw! 
Then straw the benches! I'm getting married! Pick up a tree.
You never know! upp-himinn there! We might fall down! 
Where are the women! Pykkir mer or augum eldr of brenna!
I think to myself her eyes, wow! They're burning! Now how
Are the elves doing! What's with the gods here! Hold on, 
Don't let the straw burn! Pick up the bench! Put the bench
Down! You picked up the bench! ek I can't believe this!
Sit down where you stood! First straw the benches! O giants,
Sit down!
