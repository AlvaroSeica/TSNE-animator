everything i do is grotesque, misshapen
the sooner i get to space and time the better
the music screeches in my mind and i remember
doug saying he can't draw any more because the
pencil screams when he presses it on the paper

the music has its own teeth and melody
the music is a thief and harbinger of evil
it's stingy it won't allow me near it
what i think about is how violat it is
and how it screams when i try to play it

everything in my life won't let me near it
everything turns violent and plays my skin
my skin is an instrument of space and time
my skin is grotesque and misshapen

what i do is try to wear the music
the sooner i get to space and time the better

http://www.alansondheim.org/tungg.mp4

the TUNGG of the thing where SPEECH is PROSCRIBED

now i am safe here when i can rise
and place my tiny worlds out of site and mind
my tiny worlds are safe from everyone
and it doesn't matter if i can scream
i have a tungg and i can scream
my tiny worlds are safe from you 
my tiny worlds are safe from me
i sing
my tiny worlds where are you now
my tiny worlds where are you now
you're safe from me and safe from them
you're safe from me and safe from them
my tiny worlds you are my tungg
my tiny worlds you are my tungg
my tiny worlds my tungg and you
my tiny worlds my tungg and you

somewhere from Holderlin

http://www.alansondheim.org/geol18.jpg

somewhere from Holderlin's The Leisure

But rising into the moonlight up the broken columns
And the temple gates that once met the terrible, the secret
Spirit of balance, the chest of the Earth and the people
Be angry and ferments, the Unbezwungne, the old Erobrer,
The cities, like lambs, tears, once the Olympus
Stormed which stimulates in the mountains, and flames out throws,
The uprooted forests and breaks forth by the ocean
And the ships smashes and yet in the eternal order
Never mislead you power on the board of your laws
No syllable blurred, which is also your son, O Nature,
With the spirit of peace born out of a womb. -

machine translation, the original German found handwritten
in a fourth edition of Hermann Weyl's RAUM ZEIT MATERIE, 
1921

how nice, why so much music? why so much music? i work on surge 
theory with very little response; now, three of us are working 
together on a cd, Threnody, Shorter Discourses of the Buddha - 
everything on it has to be a combination of centrifugal and 
centripetal forces, flight and border or potential well, 
emptiness, the rush from life and death towards space and time, 
survival in a cold-death universe of annihilations. again there 
will be very little response; great reviews don't translate into 
sales or distribution or breaking even, or anything that might 
allow me, us, to go on, and i sense an ending just around the 
corner, children and grownups flee from me, as far back as i 
remember, animals yowl, plants wilt, mewl and slumber, forms 
slowly wander their uneasy path of disappearance

soon the music will be done and gone, disks to give away, no one 
listens, no one returns our calling

they closed my MOO behind a firewall
they cut off my arms my hand
they cut off my legs my tongue
they cut out my eyes my ears
they hung me near your eyes your ears
they killed my haven
they plucked my lily from my navel
they refused my nightmares

production preparation, Palmyra

http://www.alansondheim.org/survive5.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/eguitclar.mp3
 -> -> electric guitar + Bb clarinet

preparation of production
production of preparation

1. I don't have names for the pieces at this point.
2. Pieces are 4' or under.
3. Pieces are the Shorter Discourses of the Buddha.
4. Production of production and preparation of preparation.
5. Instrument names are not names.
6. I don't have the order down at all.
7. My nails are strong and my fingers supple.
8. "Yet my nails are strong and my fingers supple."
9. The qin, at any moment, out of tune.
10. Viola bowing leaves a lot to be desired.
11. Alpine zither and electric guitar = rough on fingers.
12. Risky gamble of maverick clarinet.
13. Balance Azure singing with embedding and clarity.
14. Cords, chords, and braid = sonic sheaves.
15. Sound remaining, for a moment, after I die.
16. The unclarity of the sound remaining.
17. Today I practice jinashi shakuhachi, alto clarinet, 
clarinet, electric guitar, viola, anything to keep myself
moving. These are the best for the fingers and lungs. 
Tomorrow the sazs, pipa, oud, Alpine zither, qin, others
that building on the simpler architectures of the western
lands. I read myself into a state of forgetting. How to
name the pieces, order them, keep them to the assigned
limits as if they were born to the length of a shorter
older singing. How to ignore the screams outside the 
window here, now, as if what mattered only were internal
resonances, murmurings of the worlds, skies elsewhere, 
and my thinking all through this, summed up in one word,
Palmyra.

Got.


The Buddha is perfection.

http://www.alansondheim.org/thren17.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/violamute1.mp3

One must be careful not to get in the way of a truck.
It's harder to get around these days.
The news got around that the Buddha is imperfect.
I get wary of bad news that's even worse.

The Buddha is pure in body and mind and speaks truth-only.

When he says he doesn't get it, he must not be listening.
Either get out the weapons or get out.
Get below in the bad storm of the intellect.

The Buddha's words conform to essence and meaning.

It got cold out when I thought about these things.
I don't know what's gotten into her every evening.
He got down from the train when it was still moving.
I got down with her and everyone knew it.

The Buddha's body, space, time, power, and life are infinite.

You've got to be kidding she said listening to him carry on.
He got into the sutra box and was playing with god knows what.
Give me a minute, he said, I just got in.
She got through the interrogation with flying 'colors.'

The Buddha is infinitely patient and teaches single-sound.

He kept trying to get up in the morning but it was useless.
His get-up was tawdry like a mendicant monk.
I'm really getting into The Buddhist School of the Small Vehicle.
She got to thinking about mendicant monks.

The Buddha never sleeps, never wakes, never speaks.

He got caught in an unseemly affair.
She never got through the night without suffering.
She got to thinking what a seemly affair might be.

The Buddha is emptiness and non-existent.

I got to dance one last time dressed like an Arhat.
I got into the class and thought about whirligigs.
I got out a brush and paper and began to think.
I got beside myself with grief.
I got into a shrine without lock or key.
I got some last night.
I got up on a ladder and threw it away.
I got down when I heard the Buddha was dead.
I got over it soon enough and looked forward to a new her.
I got into trouble worrying about ladders and propositions.
I got under the weather but it was still weather below.

What kind of GOD
commands his people
not to murder yet cowers
behind free will?

_Reason_

The reason why life should exist
is as arbitrary as the reason why it shouldn't,
life shouldn't exist,

the cls+ effect

http://www.alansondheim.org/lightsync.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/lightsync.mp4

chaotic light synchronization, westminster st., providence, ri, 
asynchronous stochastic (?) triggering of light-pole switching 
coupled with entangled ambient light, humidity, and sonic 
vibrations.

watch carefully and place photocell readout devices over the 
screen-shot lamp glares, being careful to account for the hand- 
held tremor effect and auto-focus mishap towards the interval 
end.

this clsastolscwealhasv effect has been bothering me, ever since 
we moved to the gritty little city built on reclaimed swampland 
and religious fevers.

of which at the moment i have one, a fever sweeping throat and 
lungs before it, taking no for an answer to every question i 
might still be able to hear.

the glare of the shuddering lights are my rock and salvation and 
comfort me, yay-though i lie down in one or another valley, 
preferably out of the way of traffic, or not.

the glare confounds the effect, by the way, but no camera lies 
in the first instant, and hardly speaks in the second.

sick still with a bad flu turned to bacterial infection so the 
fever's gone away but the cough's turned furious, twists around 
to hurt me, one of us cries out in the night, violent ghost 
inside me, hungry ghost to get out fast, red dust to choke me, 
no escape, the ghost of the qing qin looms over the bed, science 
logic shattered, i'm yelling, suffocated, making-sense wraiths 
flutter there, life's the long scream home, walls and doors 
shattered, so the good boy in the middle of the night wanders 
with camera and audio, records it all,

http://www.alansondheim.org/qinghost1.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/qinghost6.jpg

sick still he doesn't come back, he's out there, he doesn't 
return, has these things, left them for you, life's a failure 
over, closing down then, thinking bad thoughts then, moment's 
crashed itself then, it's closing time then, qing qin ghost

http://www.alansondheim.org/stopped.jpg
it started. the lake sound. the trapped.
http://www.alansondheim.org/thelake.mp3
i remember. it stopped. the trapped.
http://www.alansondheim.org/thelake3.png

at one point it seemed to me as if i could have these typed 
positions key-grabbed by a rogue site and that's still probably 
the case. is the wifi still working? in the airport, it's 
no-manz no-mads noh-mad land and i work this idea, that it might 
just be possible to learn something about the world's cosmology 
before passing out / passing on, so there are these books around 
with skimmed symbols so i've learned their alphabets and some of 
their combinations, but not too much. so there's the forest of 
symbols, detached from roots and branch-points, so that i've 
founded there, i'd say among them. across from me someone's 
reading or talking and i'm sure is logging these symbols i'm 
typing, i can sense his head and what he's on about with a fancy 
portable machine with a keyboard the size of the back of his 
hand on the back of his hand. the ukraine's maybe burning, if i 
type this he might look up, now he might be on to me. so the 
cosmology, tensors and whatnot, somewhere among the tendrils i 
fly, somewhere but not in this lifetime there's an understanding 
that eludes me and that's the biggest gap in the very core of my 
being and being-here, this emptiness of cosmology, this 
impervious travel. it's the key that i'm missing and the 
defocusing effect, nothing coheres to me. he's looking down now 
but a baby across the way has taken up the cry, too many 
distractions. the world's full of signals, as usual cnn is 
saying something about saying something. there are rogue stars 
on their own, dying their own deaths like everyone else. at that 
point could one flee the cosmos, flee a spot where nothing's 
audible but the self- generating of the world surrounding it. it 
lives in that spot, among itself, cosmology, cosmological, we're 
trying all the way from here to log its rogue symbols, ukraine 
not among them. it's all serious and serious despair at this end 
of the fulcrum, if there were only one part i could grasp, i 
think that the rest might unfold or might whisper about 
unfolding. there aren't trees on the star, huge backs, vortices, 
radiative arcs, magnetic storms, roseates. everyone's sleeping 
here, i type in in the midst of rolling catastrophe, slow 
turnings turning over

there are rogue stars. i can't sleep at night. 
there are rogue stars. trapped.

this is the sound when i think of making music, that is not 
music, that is sound that is the sound of thinking music making, 
that is not thinking when the sound is good, that is dizziness, 
falling down, lurching, that is the goodness of the sound


storm brew

http://www.alansondheim.org/denv24.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/stormbrew.mp3

storm is brewing out here, hasapi kept going out of tune, wind 
hollowed, continued the resonance of the rear sound-hole, 
finally coming to an end, rain and wind were picking up, i held 
on to what territory i had, submergence, holding the cough back 
as well for a few moments

as if something were tearing at the music, rending the fabric

wrote my friend earlier "I'm glad about ESP, I feel I've reached 
a serious dead-end in Providence [,,,]. At least with music, 
what I do is what I do myself or with friends, there are enough 
people that will put a cd out, at least so far. So I can be as 
neurotic or whatever, and still do ok, and music's more of a 
common denominator. Everything else I do is negotiation and I'm 
not good at that, it goes through institutions and classes, and 
I don't teach and am unfortunately independent for the rest of 
my life. But I can pick up, say, the banjo I have now, and do 
things others can't, and it's within my aegis. I've been trying 
on the other hand to get a book out of my theoretical work, 
beyond the Writing Under one, and that won't happen - nothing 
will come of it. So I feel I have to look even more inward, 
before I totally collapse... it's not a great world out there if 
you're over the age of 40, much less my 72 -"

then there's the hasapi going out of tune but always somehow 
coming back _into it_ as if there were a home there even in the 
wind and rain, doing what i do best maybe, braiding sound, still 
uselessly hoping for a breakthrough otherwise - book published, 
big concert, promotion, amazing grant, something curing the 
gnawing of my throat against my throat, that thin closure -
looking up and through the Local Cluster, amazed at the 
confluence of processes resulting in life on this planet, such a 
think edge of fecundity in the midst of catastrophe, 
annihilation - the Local Cluster coming closer, the storm 
increasing, flashes now outside, where i was something about the 
rain, the brewing storm, soon i'll remember, i'll remember soon 
-
