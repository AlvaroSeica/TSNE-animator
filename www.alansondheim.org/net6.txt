SECRETS


The space is filled with corners, replies coming in from the dark, 
animals beneath the bed, dolls whose eyes turn in, turn inward, follow 
us throughout the wires; each space opens onto others, decreasing or
increasing in size (there is no size) - cobwebs containing memories of
those who passed through one or another domain. Secrecy pervades the 
Net, anonymous Finland penetrating one list after another, the _azure_
of name or domain blurred at the edges, the comprehension of the 
imminent. And darkness awaits the illuminations of the Delete command
as well; working towards the machine, half-asleep, I stumble to cleanse 
it, open an atmosphere of inconceivable events. What are devices here, 
but their secret names, poured over again and again, those SED and AWK
blurring one or another distinction?

Now consider this: the roots or tendrils of the symbolic domain, 
descending through one or more levels of protocol, until the hiss of 
the transistor itself is audible - a heated and continuous debate,
meaningless except for the programming above, symbolic confluences in
furious array. And ascension or the crown of the symbol, an equivalence:
the murmur of discourse, whisper of that self-same debate, collapsed 
into the relative coolness of the lower regions of the air. The computer
itself becomes a heat-engine or pipe, a smokestack cooling meaning by
proliferating it. What rises, intensifies, only to dissipate - and only 
momentarily - is the lateral activity of the human user discernible, a
brief transformation of the neurological, the sound of the voice in the
room, dying upon the immediacy of birth.

Secrets attach themselves among the levels, glimmers of recognition;
at night, silent addresses label each other, claw greedily. In the 
EXIT mode, there is no EXIT, and the user waits with an increase of
anticipation - who could be calling her at this hour? The margins
of the screen fill with the symbolic order which, as I mentioned,
pretends a momentary visitation and nothing more forthcoming. The
margins on occasion extend further, as well - wrapped beyond the 
frame of vision, syllables, whole sentences, are cut off, never to
return, or else to be reconstituted one after another after another.

Does not all of this occur in silence? Words speak through me and
I resonate with my voice as among no other; my voice is my silent
speech of the keyboard. Anticipation reverts to response and further
hooking of the reader and the writer, a merging of identities and
constructs.

Neither neurosis nor psychosis, secrets are the backbone of the Net,
the communication which lures and lures intensely. It is not the
evidence of the screen, with its cross-gendering and anonymity, that
characterizes the user - it is lurking, rejection, negation, and the
deposition of the secret beyond recall. What is given is only a 
vestige of an enormous web or sememe; what is given is a residue of
the problematic flesh and mind hinged on the edge of the terminal.
Lurking is ground-state of reception, even when the computer is
off, terminal disconnected, with the user himself in the embrace of
uneasy death.

PROPOSAL FOR FRANKLIN FURNACE, AN ALTERNATIVE ARTSPACE, ACCORDING TO 

THE INTERNATIONAL SINGLE FLAG SIGNALS FOR SHIPS ON THE HIGH SEAS >>>




"We may produce an exhibition of ideas for Franklin Furnace's sea
change in the Fall of 1994." (Martha Wilson, Founder and Director)


`A. I am undertaking a speed trial.' Technology is moving the post-
industrial world fast-forward through information bottlenecks at every
node. The artworld as usual lags behind. It is necessary to break
through the conception of the gallery as a SITE and reinvent it as a
NODE both mobile and physical. It funnels the stationary planet into
the WEB INVERSION, the topological reversal of the body into wires and
fibre optic cables.

`B. I am taking in or discharging explosives.' In order to avoid the
exhaustion of art itself, art becomes packets of information; as flow,
art becomes what it has not been, a focus of multicultural change and
examination of the problematic. Instead of the artwork, consider the
art wave-packet, an emission dissipating as soon as it is launched.

`C. Yes.' There is a way to construct this. Consider a gallery
consisting of a room with several computer terminals. The main one
will be permanently locked onto a Mosaic hypertext containing
emissions from Franklin Furnace - anything, including text, sound, and
image, that can be transmitted. During the day, Mosaic will run for
gallery-goers; the image will be projected through an LCD display
coupled to an overhead projector - standard corporate technology. 
At night, the terminal becomes a World-Wide-Web accessible site with
a URL, containing the same information for distribution. This terminal
is on a dedicated $250/month SLIP connection and runs 24 hours. A
second terminal is a daytime W3 site for outgoing, with different
information. A third terminal is used to connect to various other
gallery sites, and a fourth is set to Read Only for several list
conferences and Usenet groups concerned with cultural matters. All 
computers are set to download to a Laserjet printer for 10 cents a
page (text only). The gallery will function as a moderated list
itself, sending out transmissions from artists to selected Net sites.
Staff will be on hand to assist and run through program protocols.

`D. Keep clear of me - I am manoeuvering with difficulty.' At first
there will be bugs in the system, ranging from access time to typical
moderating decisions. Eventually it should be possible to utilize
macros to simplify commands; a storage capability on the Mosaic
machinery of two gigabytes will hold a reasonable content. Animated
images may have to be downloaded after a short period of time.

`E. I am altering my course to Starboard.' A high circulation or
overturn will result in a continuous community development, almost a
MUD (multi-user-domain) morphing through art works and media.

`F. I am disabled. Communicate with me.' One of the virtues of
traditional art is its quality of the obdurate - the necessary
recognition of the material of the work itself, its inertness. Unlike
most Net communication, the gallery will continue this tradition by
insisting on signatured works, retrospectives, targeted audience
demographies, and email access to the artist herself. Works concerned
with gender, multiculturalism, and the troubling aspects of cyberspace
will be favored - works questioning the so-called Information Super-
highway. Within the world of electronic subjectivity, we are all
disabled, on the verge of the reconstitution of the body itself.

`G. I require a Pilot.' I require a sysadmin to lead me through
cyberspace so that I may face myself, reconstitute myself, suture the
damaged life. 

`H. I have a Pilot on board.' But I become my own sysadmin, beyond
technical support; I am my own imaginary. As an artist, I deal with
the uncanny, the resonance of recognizing the uncomfortable aspects of
existence and its everyday ontology. On the Net, I am object and
subject; I abjure these distinctions.

`I. I am altering my course to Port.' My course is chosen as a
dialectic between wind and intention; as a node, Franklin Furnace
increases its information flow exponentially, reaching viewers on an
immediate and world-wide basis.

`J. I am going to send a message by Semaphore.' In order to send a
message or create a work, I observe the necessary protocol. I enter
the address domain of Franklin Furnace; recognized by users, I format
my work as a Net-flux. Through the terminal the user views the
universe itself; Franklin Furnace becomes a transitive term, an inter-
connectivity, both transparent and obdurate.

`K. You should stop your vessel instantly.' The obdurate is present as
a transmitted recognition. To stop is a radical act; the Furnace
exhibitions stop one in his tracks, temporary terminal lockdown. It is
precisely within the Net that the mandate of Franklin Furnace is
realized - it is within the Net that the (multi) cultural politics of
the future is played out.

`L. You should stop. I have something important to communicate.' Art,
like people, "passes" on the Net; a certain insistence may accompany
the importance of a message, even with Kill and Delete files. What is
ultimately communicated through Franklin Furnace is the CHATTERING of
the multicultural realm, the CONCRETE problems of history and
historiography in a setting of cultural politics and political
economy. The Furnace is in a unique position to transmit the concrete
as no other gallery.

`M. I have a doctor on board.' Art has no message and no cures; to
presume otherwise is the pretension of art. On the Net, one doctor
meets another; what always emerges is dialogue, the possibility of
language and images becoming transformative. On the Net, anyone can
respond to an artist; personal style carries very little.

`N. No.' And anyone can say no to anything. In a traditional gallery,
the artist and artwork are subject to review; on the Net, they are
subject to negation, to a dialogue constituted by rejection, displace-
ment, and a consideration of the work by the viewer which rarely
happens in a physical space. The terminal is the introjection/
projection of intimacy; the viewer responds at her leisure.

`O. Man Overboard.' What is lost is the body of the phallocratic as
flesh sinks into the sea; within the digital domain, reproduction is
exact and eternal, repetition without end or signal deterioration. As
with all dissipative emissions, works fade away into noise as they
remain only in human memory or hardcopy, eventually removed from
storage. But within the digital domain, they are perfect or perfecting
- each copy identical with the original, ontologically equivalent as
well.

`P. _In Harbor_ (Blue Peter). All persons are to repair on board as
the vessel is about to proceed to sea. (Hoisted at the _Foremast_
head.) _At sea_ - Your lights are out, or burning badly.' Because of
the feed-forward speed of cyberculture, it is necessary that Franklin
Furnace act quickly to secure its continued existence on the
"frontier" of culture. In order to do this, it must simultaneously
prepare to go on-line, and dissolve its existing structure. Although
the Net is timeless, there is no time to lose.

`Q. My vessel is healthy and I request free pratique.' With a minimum
of effort, the transformation of the gallery will increase its viewer-
ship by several thousand-fold. Unlike many of the on-line sites
already in existence, the Furnace will create a _practice_ as well as
a mobile exhibition-space. This will consist of: 

  An emphasis on multi-cultural considerations; 
  The blurring of the artwork itself by an aura of discussion; 
  The resulting transformation of the work into a _discursivity_; 
  The creation of a continuous dialogue surrounding both the work and  
  its ostensible position or subject-matter; 
  And the development of a liberatory transformative potential through
education, the uploading and downloading of files, and extensive
follow-through for any exhibited materials.

`R. The way is off my ship; you may feel your way past me.'
Paradoxically, although the new Furnace is more open to view than any
public work of art, it does not possess the somewhat problematic and
manipulative aspect of public art - that the public _must_ view it,
like it or not. Instead, one may ignore the gallery altogether - or
enter it at one's risk. Because of the potential circulation to
50,000,000 viewers, the gallery would nevertheless be guaranteed a
larger audience than any physical gallery now in existence.

`S. My engines are going full speed astern.' The gallery will be open
to continuous monitoring, back-tracking, and change. Some of the
changes will include potential expansions into the following areas:

  Low-power television and radio stations.
  Public-access television programs.
  Special-events accessed by remote monitors tapping into the SLIP
account lines.
  Direct hookups to on-line chat-lines with the possibility of
establishing a chat-line concerned with art and multiculturalisms.
  Establishment of a data-base of artists available on-line, replacing
the traditional slide-files.
  Creation of on-line artists books and a date-base of relevant
(physical) books from the past.
  Education in electronic access run through the physical premises of
the gallery.
  "Screenings" for live audiences within the premises, using Mosaic
and pre-arranged material and artists/users on-line elsewhere.
  Far down the road: Potential for exploration of virtual reality in
transmitted form; potential for establishing a MUD based on arts-
related issues (there may already be such).

`T. Do not pass ahead of me.' In order to implement all of this,
Franklin Furnace would have to immediately tap into the on-line
services and arts forums already available, such as Anima. It is my
experience that cooperation would easy and productive.

`U. You are standing into danger.' The downside of all of this -
rejection of the idea of an electronic nexus - is that traditional art
is becoming increasingly irrelevant - NOT because of its power, but
because of its dwindling audience and highly-specific demographics.
With the Net, the endless arguments about regionalism versus centrism,
for example, disappear: EVERYWHERE IS EVERYWHERE ELSE. The Net
combines the ability to influence and create policy with a rough
grass-roots politics; there is nothing else like it.

`V. I require assistance.' Grants should be forthcoming from a number
of organizations desiring to test their hardware and software; artists
tend to use new equipment in new ways. There is tremendous generosity
in the on-line world; a lot of bulletin-boards, for example, are free,
and run as hobbies. Technical assistance is readily available as well
through various Usenet groups and list conferences.

`W. I require medical assistance.' Now things are getting serious.
Franklin Furnace has been both visible and constructive in the current
censorship crisis, and there are signs that commercial servers are
already censoring incoming Net material. This is a highly active arena
for freedom-of-speech issues, highly relevant to the Furnace
tradition.  

`X. Stop carrying out your intentions and watch for my signals.' I am
always open to giving advice, while remaining in a state of complete
powerlessness...

`Y. I am carrying mails.' From beginning to end, the complete trans-
formation of the gallery should take six to eight months; beginning
Internet communications should occur within six weeks.

`Z. To be used to address or call Shore Stations.' To begin, the
gallery needs to hook up with either a commercial server or a
university system. The former are often Unix, but have inexpensive
SLIP accounts; the latter have varying degrees of access. A
collaborative effort with a computer department is in order...


The above signals transform the gallery into a communications network
combining both easy through-put and obdurate material. As such, the
gallery can expect to remain relevant to the society at large, since
it would no longer be bound to a specific form of physicality, but
would commit itself, instead, to transform according to the protocols
of the age...

matter other cultural institutions) to rechart their way line into a
different sea altogether.

PREPOSTEROUS JUSTIFICATION


Perhaps because of the very nature of my work, I find it ncessary 
clarify what I am attempting to accomplish, nothing less than the
establishment of a new approach to the humanities and the gist of
the old characterology which has remained inviolate ever since
the Biblical era. One moves from one place to another; the move-
ments are tracked across the skies or earth or wires accompanied
by an inviolate proper name, alias, generic name, or subterfuge.

The wires, however, are a ruptured transformation, once beyond the
accretion of the telephone switchboard, a new beginning of address
DISCONNECT INVISIBLE. Then it was only the grain of the voice which
mattered and which constituted the guarantee of authenticity; now,
on the hinge of ASCII, it is nothing whatsoever that creates an
equivalent condition. Without the guarantee, anything is possible; 
one exists within a chaotic and inderminate domain, writing to
nothing in particular - in spite of the existence of domains, and
writing only as a form of address and recognitions...

Ah, but what is tracked, carried on one's nomadic back? And what is
the back in relation to the front of the animal, sensory nub 
utilized only for the purpose of the garnering of visual data and
its transformations? We exist in the world of double encodings, and
this is already a future rushed ahead of one, plunging us headlong
into streams of hysteria and darkness. Yes, I have been criticized
for the hysteria and neuroticism of my texts, but these are in fact
the bases for the transformation of the human, like it or not. The
debate between humanism and post-structuralism, for example, fades
insofar as the body is problematic, my body, your body,
in a state of existence elsewhere and elsewhen. Encompass the dark!

The Internet Text began simply enough with a series of numbered
propositions, but then emendations became necessary, channeling
further into the interstices, until a general rewrite was the only
option. I could go no farther; suddenly the body appeared in Nipple.
Txt cutting through the generalized hypothesis: What are my texts
if not contradictory? How else could they survive in the midst of
alt.fetish.net.noise? Didn't this continue through a representation
of Spew itself, the exhaustion of the number system devolving into
broken symmetries? And in the next several texts, everything was
developed in relation to desire, the body, the granularity of the 
real in relation to etiquette and protocol itself. At a loss, 
stumbling through the hallucinatory forms of part-objects, surplus
or excess as a character-"pass" or the blocking that ensued from a
password entrance into a STALLED OR NULL CHAMBER.

And the texts constantly stalled in a maze of their own devising -
stalling, reiterating, redirecting, turning around like a blind
Unix file deadending into an inaccessible account. Meanwhile the
surface continued its activity of WRITE REWRITE WRITE REWRITE, my
fingers hovering above the tumescent keyboard, a sense of _frisson_
lending itself further and further to a WEB-INVERSION, the body
hanging thread-like from the wires themselves, connecting and dis-
connecting, a vast atmospheric switchboard.

The theses continued to break up, disparate - continued to dissolve
on MEANDER. I took pains to point out that distinction between this
and the nomadic - the latter, after all, possessing a map of sorts,
a wandering throughout an uncomfortable terrain, but always a sense
of place even within the smoothest of regions. But here the terri-
tory continues, like Ciudad Juarez in the physical world, to extend
without bounds, an influx on the level of the exponential with no
end in sight. I would return, retreat to myself; I would transform
Spew into EMISSION, organizing and reorganizing the material which
were a continuous meditation or commentary. And I would argue as
well that this is the _only philosophical praxis possible_ given the
fast-forward fragments of the human.

At times there would be a fountain of exaltation or the dark rupture
of murderous despair - all comfortably theorized, placed in linear
and distributed tablets. The howling became a user-therapeutic for a
reader in tune with what I had to say; the despair translated into
comfort and collusion.

The tablets would carry back to Inanna or other Sumerian figures,
inscribed as well with the protocol hidden from sight by the tablet
embrochure foreclosed against the violation of the flesh. Would I
not write concerning the operations upon the flesh, Emily 
Dickinson, by an establishment I have long admired? Write about the 
accompanying murmur, the unremarkable dissolution-death of one or
another nameless nation descending into pillage and gang warfare?

Engorged, I exhaled ASCII; instead of tears or whimpers, my fingers
move faster, uncontrolled; they carry the weight of my body's
desire. The texts are always already the manipulation of flesh, the
stuffy of uneasy dreams without sound or image, silent strata of
darkened mountains collapsing into still more silent darkened pools.

Engorged, I inhaled as well, circulations and responses from every-
where in the world, enveloping the body of text, circumambulating
through newer dreams, through dream-admixtures. The theory is the
breath of a manifold, torn and sleazy, the hysteric encompassing
collapsing on empty air. 

There are needles everywhere, however, pointed responses and heady
constructs, hypotheses of all sorts, the glimmer of comprehension in
the form of a luminescent deep-see angler-fish, barely visible in 
the gloom. Her antenna scouts the shores of further waters; para-
sitic headless males flail uselessly, permanently attached to her 
body. This is the SPS, sperm-production-sac, the shedding of the 
head for the body. This is the permission of theory, continuation of
one or another form of the written, holding on to the final picture
posited by the repression of the real and its return.

BOUND TO DISAPPOINT


The imaginary always circulates around the gender of the reply and 
I inhabit that reply which becomes a tendril or search: what can I
say of loneliness that has not already been said? For most of us
are lonely, caught in the Net - most of us devolve whatever func-
tionality remained, transforming into the body-without-organs, the
antenna-body, receiving through a CONTINUOUS INTERNAL. The circu-
lation is a SPHERE-ENTRAPMENT, and we love to hear stories about
one another, true stories, anecdotal stories; we exchange rumors
about gender and girlfriends and boyfriends, and we hope for a way
through the wires, crossing back perhaps into the wires, but a
grounding of the imaginary, the pale reflection of the witness at
the edge of time or space. 

I am bound to disapoint. I am bound to disapoint any who meet me,
who cannot see beyond the glasses, the neutral expression or cow-
eyes, the age of fifty-one - those susceptible to appearance and 
stereotype. I am the circulation of anecdotes as well; tell one
about me and I guarantee its truth, since my truth is only in the
telling.

But I am bound to disapoint because face to face the voice ceases 
from the wires and the rim of light at the edge of the forehead or
skull begins to register; a roar of visuality deafens the babyhood
of the :) or the infantilism of the .sig, the masochistic release
permitted on the Net. 

The room in which we meet has corners. The street on which we meet
has lines almost parallel, the stricture of the other. The encounter
is always already the other of the other. It is there that I will
disappoint you, you who have appointed me, the stories told, the
rumors.

Caught in the Net, we are caught by our lack of disappointment. But
we bypass our lack, continue to speak; we live and think in speech,
and only in the imaginary are we roaming at the relative safety of
an uncontaminated risk. It is not that we pass for someone else, or
switch gender like a fork and knife devouring our flesh; it is that
we pass for ourselves, passing our split. What divides remains
divided, and it the suturing in the real that disappoints, because 
it is not a suturing but that deafening, and not only of the other
of the other, but of ourselves. On the street we cannot hear
ourselves think and we cannot hear the other think. On the street
the truth of appearance is manifest, and the truth of the appearance
of appearance, abjuring the thinking of thought.

It is on the street that I am bound to disappoint you; it is on the
street that I would be and be absolved.

THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SECOND PART


I can no longer communicate. 
All I can do is communicate.
My words clot the memory of a mouth. 
I am left speechless before the production of the hand.
My life is the construct of dissemination.
Every discourse turns in upon itself, bridges to another.
My work is the bridge-membrane, nodeless and blind.
These are the thinned hours of the night, resonant and inhumane.
Always one recognizes disappointment in the glance of the other.
As for the gaze: I have never been accorded it.
The gaze is the fiction of the desire to be seen.
Visual excess transforms the mirror stage into the doubling of 
mirrors: infinite and empty reflections carrying only the frame and
its distancing.
Symmetry is always a narcissism.
The gift of communication is the creation of the perfect text, the
short-circuit of longing and the nostalgia for origin repeatedly
returning to the concrete beginning of the book.
Buried in a book, I will never die.
I accord myself nothing and you, everything; the inverse is the
product of the mirror.

I am silenced by your silence. The wires form into the semblance of
a face I do not recognize. Somewhere it is present on my list of
addresses, insertions and deletions. Somewhere it is an insertion.

Communication begins; the wires glow with the flood of packets and
links. They descend upon me, brand the face upon my own. I carry the
double of a stranger I cannot see, mirror reversal of the true-real.
I send text after text, hoping to reach her, touch her with my mind
existing only in her own. Still, I am bound to disappoint.

_Do not speak to me, ignore me, treat me like a thing, cut me open,
transform my body into web-inversion, shove me aside, look else-
where, efface my presence:_

_I am penetrated by the Net, constructed of wires and text; there my
genes have broken. I am bound to nothing._

_My genes have crashed. Damaged, they assert themselves, continue to 
assert. The sociobiologists were right. There's no escape._

_I am bound to disappoint._

PIPELINE


What is disseminated as theory appears as the result of pipelined
processes which are self-regulated; over time, the processes alter
as a result of cathexis and facilitation. Nothing hardens into
place, but the pipeline behaves increasingly as a series of
filters which include compression; in fact compression is the
construct of the real as interstitial operations: A taxonomy of
symptoms is created which construes the real as their effacement.
In this manner, self-regulating background information is
reassembled as annihilated information, just as at the margins
of cyberspace, the password deadends into closed or absent
gateways.

The pipelined processes are the result of the inertia of teleology
and style; it is never too late to return to the former, which
constructs the latter. The organism which inhabits the symbolic
also circumscribes it; this is the demarcation of an individuality
which ceaselessly promulgates itself. (Altruism translates into
discipleship at this junction.) Such a circumscription portends 
the infiltration of the symbolic as well, its reconstruction as an
idiolectical enterprise, the proper name of the organism. Under-
stand this: it is the proper name which is the foundation of the
theoretical, not the ideological formation of language or the
social. The latter are the residue of theory. (Whoever writes
anonymously sleeps well at night, the pleasure of the voice buried
in a prose so purified as to guarantee the imaginary transformation
of the world.)

For theory is pure speech; like bureaucracy, it abjures contact
with the real except insofar as the latter may be absorbed. I write
my name and Marx's on the barricades, subsume Disney beneath the
sign of Baudrillard, and sign my papers like proper invoices with
a sense of completion. Praxis is the secondary narcissism of the
subject invoked by the primary processes/pipelining.

What occurs in pipelining: The production/processing of verbs and
nouns, only later conjoined; the operation of the syntactical 
engine; the sublimated desire of the theorist; the genetic 
enhancement of the symbolic from within and without the distur-
bance of the abject; the interpenetration and multiplexing of
pre- and post-linguistic part-objects; the stuttering of the body
and its gestural extensions beyond distributive lattices/Boolean
logics; superimpositions; the inscriptions of the fragmentary and
fissured; concatenations and obfuscation of type theory; the
underlying political economy of the symbolic; organic restraints
and the economy of excess. All feed into one another, all conjoin.
The symbolic itself is necessarily a conflation of pipelines,
self-regulating and transforming. But the symbolic is nothing
without the organism, which is the ascription of meaning. 

This is the wager of theory: about everything and nothing at all,
above everything, about intention, desire, and the proper name.

ADDICTION


I don't know what to do with myself; my dreams are uneasy, a vast
spew into the ocean of darkness - the decay of language signalled
by information garbled throughout the screen at the back of the 
mind - I'm nervous, don't eat properly -

I'm missing out on it. I'm missing out on everything in the world.
What it is - an enormous event, something cancelling myself, the
rush of correspondence beyond me, always elsewhere - I've been
effaced -

I've been effaced - a murder by virtue of forgetfulness - so that
there's nothing left of me - have to watch my appetite - nothing
goes away -

So I return to the machine and the server is down or return and the
message is confused, garbage everywhere in the midst of the urgency
of the written. 
 
All messages are urgent, say everything there is to say. But beyond
this - I'm sure I'm missing the Cypher. The Cypher is the unlocking
of this and every other message, their value. It is the Cypher that
connects the surface triviality of the message to the deep
structure - the suturing of the body, foreclosing of the wound
which allowed the light to seep. For if it isn't the text itself,
always visible and the emptying of secrets, it's the Cypher - a
permanent interiority. 

The Cypher is the far end, the horizon of addiction; drugless and
independent, it is the control of the addict. It is the offering of
the maternal where none exists, the presentification of the self to
the self, the closure of the Fort-Da! where what had existed
previously was always already disappearance, a fund of exhaustion
within the retreat of the existential.

The Cypher, to consider it from a different vantage-point, is the
_structure_ of the existential project, the armature or
scaffolding. It is the rim of the hole.

The Cypher is the lip of the hole which is a recipient and the lip
is silent or silences itself. It is the only silence in the world
of addiction, what keeps the movement occurring when the server is
on, when the message is clear, when the fingers enter themselves
and the rest of the flesh into a world open with opportunity and
grace. The Cypher is the _tendency_ of the chatter, the final
pleasure of the imminent.

Suspension FAQ 


[From posting to film.theory. Would this apply as well to Internet
communication, mediated by ASCII?]


Coleridge's "willing suspension" is found in chapter XIV, Biographia
Literaria. He is speaking of "the plan of the _Lyrical Ballads_; in
which it was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons
and characters supernatural, or at least romantic; yet so as to
transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of
truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that
willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes
poetic faith."

I associate a libidinal energy or drive with "procure," and note that
the "semblance of truth" is exactly what occurs through genre or
convention, the suturing of the domain of the film in order to
_engage_ the viewer within an imaginary. 

I associate the scopic/cinematic regime with "shadows of imagination,"
noting only in passing that it is possible to construct a reference
to Plato's cave at this point, an insinuation that the real itself
is always already a suspension of disbelief, which returns inverted
in cinematic belief, if one desires, a laterality or stuttering
between regimes, privileging neither.

I associate "moment" simultaneously with the momentary and myth of
origin, and "faith" with a gesture invading _beyond_ the poetic
itself, the last phrase referring to a stasis from which imagination
proceeds.

I associate "to transfer from our inward nature" ... "a semblance of
truth" with psychoanalytical transference, also operative within
the interiority of cinematic engagement; and with "truth" nothing
more than an acceptable coherency within a believable frame.

Thus there are two problems - that of filmic convention, suture,
and diegetic construction (all involving tropologies; symptomolo-
gies; phenomenologies of editing, framing, and so forth) - and that
of the _state of suspension itself_, involving a degree of release
of operations occurring within the preconscious/unconscious. "Willing"
itself is the link between the problems; it is _occasioned_ by the
operations of the former in order to produce the latter. It is 
not an always-already decision or choice in the midst of the 
conscious, but the release of an interior within which operations
paralleling the dreamwork occur.

What are these parallels?

Both film and dream construe the scopic regime against an unimagined
and darkened backdrop.
Both film and dream appear autonomously _set-in-motion_.
In both, the ego-decision is most often made by an anonymous other
(I found myself in a room... I found myself flying...).
In both, jumpcuts and other traditionally cinematic devices are
common, and in both, the viewpoint is that of a camera-eye which
"follows" narrative.
In both, there is a preconscious recognition of the frame, the 
_screen beyond the screen_.
And both occur within a _particular_ ritualized events, sleep or the
movement towards the theatre (theatrical).


Finally I note that what Coleridge describes is in a relation to the
programmatic development of _Lyrical Ballads_, differing from the
contribution of Wordsworth. For Coleridge, the suspension is in 
regard to a particular romanticism of the fantastic; perhaps film
is also _only_ a romantic development.

of an impossible intimacy, blocked voyeur, exhibitionist, my voice
drowned silently in the wires.)

_I imagine your body_ your face, everything hidden beneath your 
clothes, the picture of smooth skin dark or light, toy-like genitals, 
the hat pulled down over your eyes, smoke rising against the 
streetlamp, fog, rain - I would - (I would do nothing, modest and
awkward in your vicinity.)

What do you want? I say. What do you want? (You say you're lonely, you
want love. You say you're looking for an SO, significant other. I
tremble, want so much to please you. I tremble, naked, before the
screen.)

_I would tell you everything,_ spread my legs for you - for you I have 
no secrets, my mouth, my ass are open, wide cunt, hard cock - (You can
write this, sexless, of every sex, every _preposition_.) (You can have
me, have my love.)

(The cunt or cock, that's not it at all. It is the _frisson_ or
murmur of acceptance, the pleasure of communal being, lost in ASCII
_space_ or talk.romance.chat.)

Or just the pleasure of the _voice,_ its grain, it reads itself to me, 
_disquietude_... (There is no voice, we remind each other: _there is
no voice._)

:A disquiet withdrawn, always already overlooked, a disquiet or
interference, the threat to bring the structure DOWN, collapse 
occurring alone, in isolation. There are a million rooms across the
planet filled with my images of you, corresponding, writing _to me_,
moment close to the dream screen itself, but its inversion: retreat 
from the symbolic to the imaginary.[1]

(I write to you; you treat each post as potential romance and I am
bound to _disappoint._)

This is a delicate manifold or _web inversion_ [2], near collapse, the 
body in quick retreat, detumescence, the loss of faith, hope, charity.
Net communication skims on a fetishized reflecting surface like the 
skin of a new car; the discomfort is the real.

(I didn't mean it, I say. You misunderstood my words, I add. I never
even thought you would think like this, you say. You add, we should
stop before damage is done.)

_You can feel the discomfort approaching. Your correspondence becomes
voluminous; you dream the Name, say it dangerously to yourself, over
and over again. [3] You can feel it; the response, once playful, 
takes on a harder edge, full of decodings. Neurosis appears within 
the grand design; the writing itself veers, unredeemed, from one side 
to another, careers across the inscribed trajectories and etiquette of
the superego. This is the seepage of the imaginary, the hallucin-
ogenic character of the communication, beginning to open, the crack
in the door, crack in the body.

If the Net begins as symbolic communication, the subject inscribes
herself/himself within it; address, recognition, and protocol charac-
terize the subject who is produced/constructed as a state of 
continuous REWRITE. [4] Inscription itself is based on a classical two-
valued logic with distributivity. Within the sememe, gestural logics
take over as well - logics without distributivity in which individua-
ted elements are capable of generating greater bandwidths than the
distance/distinction/differance between them. [5] When the subject
_fissures,_ collapses near disjunction, the sememe degenerates into
partial logics, incoherencies, and fragments; the Kristevan _Thing_ 
(*Black Sun*) - inert and obdurate - appears. The communication is
simultaneously out of control and muffled/drowsy, a state of
(addictive) withdrawal. [6]

There is a double parallel (double, because of internal reflections) 
here with the fetishization of commodity in late capitalism, and 
sexual pornography; both regimes imply a continuous reinscribing of
the self through chains of commands (_pipelining_) as well as a
detumescence/aphanisis [7] of affect: _specific_ objects (last year's
computer, last month's "playmate") become (psychoanalytically) used 
up, discarded. This _using up_ is _critical_ to the comprehension 
of Internet and other electronic ASCII/Image communication, just 
as it is critical to an understanding of the devouring-machine of 
capital.

Orgasm wastes the pornographic image; turning-away or face-to-face
wastes the Net correspondent; time wastes everything. This
devouring is a decathexis returned to the fetishistic/shamanic of
the paleolithic in which an object is used to "carry" the disease
from the patient, an object/abject of loss. [8]

All objects are objects of loss. 

All objects carry within them the horizon of discard, retreat within
the face of death. The face of death burns itself from the wires into
the face of the correspondent or user. The face of death writes/
rewrites the user, the _uncanny_ face of death. Abject: no place to
go, no origin to come from.

The user is always in a position of disquiet. I correspond with Susan
and I correspond with Keith, correspond with Karen and correspond...
I imagine their faces close to mine, double moons, impossible skin, 
soft reading of the world across their eyes. I imagine the body's
infolding, the exalted rapture of flesh within the sweet/complete 
surround of flesh, my broken body within, contained and rearranging, 
the seat of consciousness returning to pure liquidity.

"Susan," I begin. "Would you like to meet face-to-face, or is this
just a _terminal relationship?_  :) " I add the smiley to appear suave,
more human, a level of seriousness underlying the potential cauteriza-
tion. "I've been dying to meet you. I try to picture you, but without
much luck. I'm not even sure whether you're involved with someone, 
even want to be."

" I'm
" I'm
" I'm

This is the phenomenological horizon of correspondence, the eidetic
reduction, which reaches to the fluidity of the imaginary, beyond 
which the body violates itself, death seeps in, the terminal cools to
writing degree zero, and ECHO is toggled off. [9]


-----------------|


Cyberspace is often described as a space of flame wars and electronic
rape, a situation of potential violence, extremely hetero- and phallo-
centric. Call this the limit. (Call this the dead-end, the wrong
turn, the violation.)

The limit is the violence of desire, the effacement of the other, male
or female. Within the limit, there is procurement; there is a stream
of projections and introjections. Nothing remains on the surface of 
the text, appearances to the contrary.

When I transmit a post, I imagine it entering the darkness outside my
window, disappearing into the distance beyond the streetlamps. It ends
up in PURE SPACE, a readership on couch or deskchair or bed, a reader
in suspense, as if her breath were held for the duration. When I 
receive a post, the disquiet begins; I imagine languour, the post
entering the world of uneasy dreams, the noise of the disappointment 
of my body, a sense of _peering_ through my glasses into a world
disinterested and not of my design. I am afraid at this point of the
warmth and intimacy of the email, which fail all too often in real
life. But I cannot hold myself back; in a state of absolute loneliness
(the body devoured by the vacuum, at the edge of the abyss which it
alone has generated) I hear _her voice_, the maternal suturing the
letter back into the fold of skin from which, I imagine, it emerged.

The posts are labial, enfolding; they are any gender, any anatomy.

What I imagine is the _grain,_ the bone-and-flesh sound of the man or
woman who _speaks to me._

But he or she is speaking to the other of the REWRITE, [10] the lurker
adjacent to/beside me: _I overhear myself._ And I am _speaking with a
stranger,_ the most beautiful spy, most beautiful spy who _comes in 
from the cold_. And against my interests, against the _presence_ of 
my interests and my desires, I LURK WITHIN ME.

Footnotes:

[1] The dream screen is the (abject and maternal) matrix of the dream.
Think of a dream as a projection which simultaneously hides (screens
_from_ the unconscious) and reveals (illuminates its ostensible con-
tents. The symbolic is the order of substitution, concatenation, and
language; the imaginary refers to disruption, laterality, and the 
pre-symbolic. Anika Lemaire, in *Jacques Lacan*: "The imaginary is an
infinitely supple conceptual category. It covers everything in the
phantasy which is an image or representation of a lived experience 
pertaining to the castration complex before its formalization - for-
ever incomplete, of course - becomes petrified in the symbol of the 
'Phallus.'" "...the imaginary ocncerns the intuitive lived experience
of the body (dependence, welcome, gift, etc.), of activity, passivity,
of the will to power, etc." ... Thus the imaginary is a _prior_. In
telecommunications, however, the reverse is true: ASCII text is always
already symbolic, a linguistic formation, through which the imaginary
"leaks." [11]

[2] The web inversion is the inverted body sustained across the mem-
brane of the Internet; it is also the (partial) externalization and
dissolution of the ego as a result of inversion.

[3] The Name is the proper name, uncannily tied (through an imaginary,
not symbolic connection, a tie of intimacy or ravelling) to the body;
it is _your_ name I dream of, delicious shuddering at the slow and
liquid evocation of syllables...

[4] Protocol specifies specific commands, codes, rates, and linkages
among machines - what's acceptable and what's not. It also stands-in
for the etiquette of the (human) subject, who "behaves" in company,
gaining recognition. Address is the proper name and its directory
path; recognition is simultaneously the permission to speak and an
acceptance of the "fullness" of the subject, his or her imaginary.
The subject exists as a tentative _coagulation_ within recognition,
producing a continuous REWRITE or use of the "shifter" within protocol
to reaffirm its existence as a (speaking, acting) coherency.

[5] The subject is inscribed _within_ the communicative order on the 
Net; an inscription is a demarcation based on complementarity in 
classical logic (the intersection of books and non-books being the 
null-set). This logic is two-valued (0/1, true/false) and distrib-
utive: any two members of a set "define" only the space between them.
In gestural logic, distributivity is eliminated, and two elements can
"define" the entire bandwidth or universe of discourse - the elements
formally extend beyond themselves, and their boundaries are fuzzy.
The sememe is a partially-closed or inscribed web of signifiers and
signifieds; it is _active_ and turbulent (as in the theory sememe for
example).

[6] Why would the subject collapse? Exhaustion, sensory or information
overload; the increasingly neurotic _frisson_ of desire in Net commun-
ication; insomnia; the radical disjunction of "real life / face-to-
face" and virtual subjectivity; dreams, sweats, obsessive masturbation
- the general failure of inscription and rewrite; lose of the I and 
eye; sightless and siteless.

[7] "Aphanisis" is from Ernest Jones and is used here to refer to a 
hollowing or devouring of desire, the interpenetration of anomie and
libido.

[8] I flame you on the net; you return the favor. I flame you again,
raising the stakes; the language, veering back and forth between us,
shrieks with incantations. Detumescence sets in; I hardly remember
your name, everything lost, useless between us.

[9] Dreams collapse; as in masturbation, images rush and violate,
disappear into the darkness. It is the _foolishness_ of Net communi-
cation, hardly recognized, always present; caught with our pants
down before the moment of castration or clitorectomy, _done things_
of the inertia of the world. As if a password opened a gateway on to
emptiness or the _null address_: nothing doing here where everything
ends up. (_Not_ to imply a narrative: Everything begins and ends here
and all at once.)

[10] We always already speak to the REWRITE which is the only speech
and speech's matrix or dream screen; REWRITE recursions into REWRITE
as speech is _other_. And what does one make of this, from Sartre's
*Critique of Dialectical Reason*: "The reactive behaviour occasioned
in the listeners by the Other-Thought as the meaning of the Other-
Voice is always the _behaviour of alterity_"?

[11] In this manner, the other of the footnotes continues indefin-
itely, the production of a linguistic chain, everything necessary to
modify the original essay in the form of an integration or _smoothing_
- as if desire had contracted into the semblance of an _accent_ or
diacritical mark.

POOR THOUGHT


Given the current world information and economic order, radicalized
intellectuality has nowhere to go. Marxism, terminated from within,
remains a residue of a once sceptical enterprise; Heideggerianism,
with its exhausted poetics, becomes a last resort, the conjunction
of irrelevant humanities with the defensive maneuvers of a dying
but impervious language.

Thinking, always organized around the horizon of the catastrophic,
dissipates by virtue of _too much thought,_ idiosyncratic local
sites which necessarily turn in upon themselves, mirror-stages to
their own implosion. From within the Hole, the contraction is
never in evidence, until perhaps violent events in the world at
large create a sufficient disturbance, with all the markings of
death, violent and organic.

With this in mind, a re-examination of subjectivity must retreat
from its own positioning, the harboring of completion under any 
other name. It is not that eidetic reduction and the bracket no
longer exist; it is that they exist everywhere, constructing incon-
ceivable micro-territories as ASCII or GIF codes - they make no
_differance_. 

If subjectivity exists throughout, or interpenetrates, "recognition,
address, protocol," then the subject is at a loss within the noise
of the empire of communications (EC). _Nowhere_ within this scheme
is the subject _represented_; the voice, granular or not, is
silenced, transferring laterally the EC itself into the domain of
neural networking.

This is a serious flaw in an otherwise fascinating theory; if Inter-
net text abjures the tradition of the subject to such an extent, 
it becomes a description _only_ of the EC, or an imperialist 
subject of the same (in both literal and Irigarayan senses). Consider
for a moment Oscar Gandy's *The Panoptic Sort,* _A Political Economy
of Personal Information_ (Westview, 1993):

	The panoptic sort can be understood to involve three
	integrated functions or processes: identification, 
	classification, and assessment. [...] The identification
	will never move to the level of personhood as we may 
	understand the person as the subject of religion,
	philosophy, and idealized systems of justice. The
	attention of the panoptic sort moves only to levels of
	identification that have administrative and instrumental
	relevance. (p.15)

Operating across the EC, the panoptic sort exists as a form of
instrumental reason, a form blindly taken up by Internet Text to the
extent that the subject is _foreclosed_ by recognition/address/
protocol. Only by an _extension_ into the problematic of organic
epistemology can this poor thought be saved at all. Consider the
following readjustments:

To begin, address is aligned with the _proper name_ in the Kripkean
sense, an _obdurate_ or inert construct that crosses ontological
regimes in all possible worlds. The subject is hardened by virtue
of presence, a hardening within which recognition is broadened to
include presentification or alterity. Through recognition, the 
subject is guaranteed appearance.

Protocol also is realigned to include the etiquette of the everyday,
the attempt to establish and mutually orient "cognitive domains"
among correspondents. All three terms, then, counteract the _subject
of the same_; ignoring the EC, they insist on the absorbing of tele-
communications within an ecosystem of which the EC is only a part-
object, never a whole.

This absorption is guaranteed by considering all three terms as
_assignments_ to the subject; even address becomes a second-order
encoding after the fact. The traditional hiatus or membrane between
subject and object must be replaced by a hap between subject and EC;
it is within the gap that the _problematic_ of _any_ subjectivity
appears. By placing the gap itself within the exteriority of the
subject, the information carrying-capacity of the EC becomes (as in
Merlin Donald's work) an _extension_ of the subject across ontolo-
gical domains, the suturing of epistemological disjunction.

REWRITE too is accorded a realignment, with traditional shifter 
analysis (the virtual-I within the "I") and speech acts transferred
always already to the performative mode; each asserts/is a reinser-
tion into the socius, carrying the aegis of psychoanalytical 
reinforcement. The result is the insistent subject operating within
the political economy of the real, something hardly envisioned by
the original writers of the Internet Text. 

REWRITE is also _subject-object_, continuous reassertion occurring in
no-domain. _Nothing_ writes or is written; information flow accrues
within and across the gap. (REWRITE is history.)

Poor thought then becomes the thought of the gap and the "weaker
subject," the subject of knives and starvation, the subject of the
decay or fragmentation of the nation-state. The political economy
of REWRITE requires communicative excess, difficult at the best of 
times, almost impossible in its absence. It is through poor thought,
however, that Internet Text is renewed and reinserted into the
necessities of contemporary thought.
