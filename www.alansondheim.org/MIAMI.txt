
my heart throbs for you
you sail the uncharted seas of distant lands and bleak horizons
you move through mountains and valleys and the darkest forests
my heart yearns for you, my eyes cry for you
your love follows you in your beauty and your long flowing tresses
your love follows your long golden hair and your eyes of deepest blue
my arms dream of you, my legs take me towards you
"for i will follow you until the ends of earth and time
"for i will walk behind thee until mountains fall and valleys rise
my heart, my heart, my eyes, my arms, my legs
your golden voice, the pause in the middle of a word, eyes wide open
eyes wide open and open wider, and eyes wider open, and open wider
my heart throbs for you
"for i dream of you and think of you, your voice whispering on the wind
"for your beauty is deeper than the ocean and your eyes bluer than the sky
my arms long to hold you in my arms, my legs yearn to hold you in my legs
your eyes wide open, your eyes open wider
my heart yearns for you, my crying open eyes

susan graham, there's something going on, well she said,
     look over there, you can see the police cars at a distance,
	  well she said, they've got their lights on, it must mean
	       something, there were flurries in the air, just a light
	       coating
      really, you c
      uldn't see much in the black night but the lights
      looked like
  	 towns, you'd hear the occasional siren and a
  	 woman's cry,
  	      it was heartbreaking, we didn't know what it
  	      could be, it
       was a mile or so away, the lights were
       swinging above the
    	street, flashing as
    	  well, as if they knew, an
    	    electrical charge in the air,
    	    sheet lightning or snow
    	    thunder,
       there was a feeling of
       danger, i noticed a dark
       shadow crossing
            the street, you
            didn't know what was
            going on, it looked
      	   all like stars,
      	   with the
      	   swaying
      	   traffic
      	   light above
        it all l
        ike a sun
        or moon
        sometimes
        a shadow
        would pass
             or
             the
             sirens
             would
             start up
             and
             die
             out,
             the
             whole
             town
             moaning
             and

             weeping,
             for
             whatever
             was
             going
             on
             down
             there

             we
             went
             back
             inside,
             had
             another
             drink,
             the

             slide
             guitar
             mourning,
             for 
             the dead,
             for you,
             you
             could
             still
             smell
             the
             heat
             of
             the

with anything when the universe turns cold 

ohh, susan g, you are made for me
the ground opens up and swallows its very snake
you are saved because the snake comes out first
and then is swallowed by the very ground it has
come out of first

it is that very first, susan, i respect and admire you

i did not know susan graham
i had never heard of susan graham
 susan graham, you are unknown to me; I have created your name, I have
 made it all up out of whole cloth, you did not have to do this to me, i
 knew nothing of opera, of your career,

    , susan graham , susan graham

      i did mean you no harm, i would not have written to you or found
      you, i know nothing of opera, in fact i don't even like it, i've had
      no reason to know - what are you, soprano, coloratura, sopranino, i
      don't know what would fit you well or likely, it was something
      fabricated, i know the coincidences seem all too real, but only to
      you, there are too many of you


she lives on down that road, i can picture it now with the swinging
traffic light in the hot dry nighttime wind, i can see it, i know
it, it's right before me, i understand it all too well

  i didn't mean you no harm,
  , susan graham, i thought
  it was all a joke, i thought
  there wasn't any other susan graham, there was just the one i made up
  out of whole cloth honest, it was for a lot of writing i was doing, i
  was thinking,

    , susan graham you would be nice to see watching things out of that
    window across from that hot dusty dry road at night when you could see
    the cars at the end of the street and sometimes hear the guns go off
    , susan graham it was like that

<Su_Graham> focusing hard on my face running the camera over my cunt
[0-0:GScNxAlFMPhR] 10:25PM @Su_Graham (+is) #nikuko (+nt) M:5 Lag 1 - E/X

<Su_Graham> he came over to me trembling and scared poor little baby
* Su_Graham said i'll take care of you
* Su_Graham said i'll take care of you forever
<Su_Graham> he came over and put his lips against my breasts
<Su_Graham> he lay gently beside me
* Su_Graham said find me with your hand not your camera
<Su_Graham> he found me he found me
<Su_Graham> now i will get up from this lawn chair on the balcony
<Su_Graham> and i will fly over the concrete wall fourteen stories high
<Su_Graham> fourteen stories high

MIAMI


looking down:your mouth opens and closes, a fish suffocating, exhausted
gills:you're standing, you're standing on a street corner:at your
breasts:at your breasts

your lips make no sense, you're mouthing nothing: MIAMI!:they sing: MIAMI!
they sing: MIAMI!:you lift your jacket in the warm night beneath the
streetlight::you look down, your breasts, no one looks

you look down, your breasts, no one looks 
you look down, your breasts, no one looks

you're naked, turning and twisted, are you having a bad dream:
MIAMI?:seeing into you, taping your every move:you're inside the
plate-glass window, i'm on the balcony:your legs twisted you approach the
window:your legs twisted you approach the window

your legs taut, twisted you approach the window
your legs taut, twisted you approach the window

you open your mouth to speak, i can't hear you:every inch of your naked
body, you turn your head and look at me: MIAMI!:you move closer, you
see me, you move up to the window:you open your mouth, MIAMI!:

open your mouth, MIAMI! 
your dirty open mouth, MIAMI!

you'll catch too much sunburn, MIAMI!:your dress is above your waist, your
panties showing, your breasts exposed:you're lying there, thanking me,
i've taken you in:you'll catch too much sunburn, MIAMI!:you'll catch too
much sunburn, MIAMI!

too much sunburn, MIAMI! 
too much sunburn, MIAMI! 

i'm taping you, ashamed, embarrassed, the camera closes in between your
legs:i notice the wedding ring, you admit everything, you're crying, your
legs parted:now you're naked, the dress bundled around your waist:your
beautiful parted legs:your beautiful parted legs

in the heavy sun, in the dark sun, in the burned sun, in the violent
sun:you're dreaming, you're spacing out, you're thinking of whole wide
worlds:i turn away quickly, the camera searching out your face::

come home with me, in the heavy sun, in the dark sun, 
in the burned out sun,
in the violent sun!

the burned out sun, MIAMI! 
the burned out sun, MIAMI!

the MIAMI music


to me the idea is to be buried
 inside the feedback loops blurred and resonated so they produce
 the plasma or otherwise ground/tamboura
  there are aerial sounds, the fingers against the strings producing
  racket: the background settles in, virtual particles collide invisibly
  as surface

  phenomena produce or reproduce the construct of entities; whatever speed
  there is partakes of the weight of the earth greater than ourselves,
  speed as well

  body falling from a great distance: the repetitive gives itself over: 
   it's one of the repetitive quasi-symmetrical measures of the universe

   there's no other reason to make music
   for me for me
   then to look at the phenomenology 
   for me for me

except for: the process of labor and the speed which short-circuits
 circuitry as if: going elsewhere: in music one comes up against limits
  there are no surmounting
  the limits withdraw as if they're not there

  they play havoc with us

  except for: the exhilaration of short-circuitry, fingers moving at
  inconceivable speed 
  i don't know where they are
  i don't know where they're going

    but they're constructing something as loops of thousands of notes
    making something that returns when i don't remember the origin
    when i don't think of it
    when i don't think of anything

   you can almost hear it

   it's there against the background droning and growing thicker
   so the playing has to be higher and scratchier

   taking it in with the memory
   taking in anything doesn't count

  looking around doesn't count
  playing fast doesn't either
