Take of the Continuity Girl


The continuity girl wears a big baggy sweater and carries a clipboard and
Polaroid camera. She walks among the naked actors and actress and takes
notes, whose hand is where, which face is turned towards - and which away
from - the camera. This is amazing. whose finger has a torn nail - whose
breasts already damp - the degree of nipple erection (easy here) - all of
this is carefully noted by the continuity girl. There is sweat running
from a shoulder. The terrorist has his knife to a neck from the left - no,
from the right - side; "R" appears almost by command on the continuity
chart. Is this the numbered scene, the only scene - the continuity girl
knows, takes everything into account. She writes "Alan is gagged tightly,
he is having trouble breathing. If he suffocates, this will be the only
take." She writes "n/g" as the gag is loosened. Azure has been shaved,
head to toe; Azure is constantly shuddering. The continuity girl writes
"Azure moves - lock structure in edit - there is no room for error - there
is nothing but error." The continuity girl notes the bruises and bites on
four, on five, breasts. She notes, "Day 3." She notes, "This is the second
day." It is the goal of the continuity girl to make sure the world is
whole, to make sure it remains contained, coherent, logical beneath the
chaos the rest of us take for granted.

The Continuity Girl


The continuity girl asserts the fundamental forces of the world. She
writes 5; then 5/under erasure; she writes 4; she exhausts the series. She
adds the cosmological constant, planck's constant; she erases them; she
includes them; she erases them. The slate is a mess. The slate is 
unreadable. The slate mimics the world. The slate becomes the world. She 
continues to write. She is wearing a baggy sweater and carrying a Polaroid 
camera. She carries a great number of accessories: tripod, telephoto, 
wide-angle, scanning-transmission electron microscope, interferometer,
neutron telescope. There are a continuous number of scenes; she numbers 
them according to the continuum. It is not so difficult to describe the 
actors; they are also continuous, and the transformation of props and 
objects occurs according to aristotelian logic and fluid morphology. Only 
certain quantum leaps give her trouble, but these radical discontinuities 
also permit discontinuities within or across scenes, and need not be 
annotated. For the rest, everything appears relatively differentiable.
The slate is a mess. The slate is a continuous mess.

Unit Mo


The continuity girl is nervous. She has dreamed of blood. The set has many
actors. She is sure about her dream. She says "You are deranged." She says
"This is a film not to be made." She says to the director "There are no
actors." She says to the director "I will be your actress." She says to
the director "Do with me what you will." She annotates all continuity. She
says "There is no director." She says "I am the director." She says "I am
sure of it.":The continuity girl wears her baggy sweater. She removes her
sweater. She removes her shirt. She removes her bra. She removes her
pants. She removes her panties. She removes her tampon. She removes her
stopwatch. She puts down her continuity pad. She puts down the script. She
picks up the script. "I will be the star of this and every other film."
The day is night. Her shaved hair is long. Her brown eyes are blue. Her
perfect teeth are crooked. Her heavy legs are thin. Her small breasts are
large. America harbors terrorists in many suburban tracts. They are set to
move against Afghanistan their mortal enemy. Afghanistan is crossroads of
empire. Fundamentalists stream across oceans. Afghanistan is mortally
wounded. The script is soaked in blood. The continuity girl climbs a
tree. The continuity girl wraps up. She has observed the continuity girl.
Against her will she has participated in the film. There are broken
costume changes. The sky is another weather. Her mood is broken. She did
give herself to herself. She did wound herself from the convenient tree.
She did pick up the script from the ground. She did put it inside of
herself. She did read of it through her period the blood. She did note the
crevice of blood across the page. She did note the word "supple""ment" cut
between one stroke and another. :odin-theme:script boy

The film is Mistake of the Century. The film is Miss Take.

who is the continuity girl. she writes and underlines these words; she
checks spelling and stylistic consistency. in the world, she writes, she
makes certain that day is day, night is night; that if day for night, then
not night for day; if night for day, then not day for night. she wears
careful glasses, is twenty-three years old, and a graduate of ucla's
motion picture / television department. she has been an extra in several
post-blair-witch-project student films, shot in will rogers state park.  
she is originally from portland, maine. she studied with leslie thornton
in brown university's modern culture and media department for her
undergraduate work. it was only later that she decided to remain on the
periphery of cinema, closely observing everything around her. the film 
was secondary, she writes, to the continuous reiteration of the real. she 
thinks she is a machine. she thinks she is the perfect eye. she thinks she 
is the inconceivable eye. i am the continuity girl, she writes, who am i.

who is the continuity girl. she writes and underlines these words; she is
killing everything. everything is destroyed and mutilated. what damage
have you done; she... a soldier rapes me. i rape a soldier. i am terror. 
i am terror of the real. i make certain that day is day, night is night;
that if day for night, then what is mine, who is the continuity girl. she
writes and underlines these words: SHE IS YOURS. SHE IS YOUR BIOTERRORISM 
HERE. i dream of the naked dead-man, she writes. i am hungry. i make 
things.

she is in the armor. she writes, i owe everything to leslie thornton and 
john malkovich. she writes, i will be naked all the time. she takes off 
her baggy sweater. she writes, i am of the real. n/g. i am the real. i am
film. armies film me. i will write their names. the glass is on the right- 
hand side. it is cloudy out and 9 o'clock in the early night. she writes, 
people are dying. she writes, people are staring at me.

i am happy.

Florid


Florid0: Water, ripples:
i can't remember anything any more. one person's
disaster is another person's pleasure. everyone has
had us, azure writes, writes alan. there is too much
water in the world, it flattens everything.

Florida: Azure, pool-side, jeans, red blouse pulled
up, mad (crazed) look in her eyes, seated:
i'll drown myself
and then i'll drown you

Floridb: Same as above, looking at camera:
then i'll drown everybody else

Floridc: Pool interior, distorted, from within:
you're out here i can
feel you

Floridd: Pool edge, ripples in blue-green water,
like skin:
then i'll drown everyone else

Floride: Azure at pool edge, same as above, leaning
back into the water, camera head-on:
late at night i lie here and i think of you, john,
and i think of you, susan, and i think of you,
david, i think of you fucking me, and i fall
backwards and i drown myself and i will take 
you, i will take you with me

Floridf: Same as above, camera from side, Azure's
face ecstatic, ripples in blue-green water, like
skin:
i am thinking of you, may, and i am thinking
of you, george, and i am thinking, your mouths
are on me, your dead eyes are looking at me,
you are fucking me hard, you are dying there

Floridg: Alan, leaning back into water, t-shirt
and black jeans, exposed, shot from side, water
black:
i'm thinking about everything, i'm writing you
into this, the way the world is, is awful, i'm out
of control, i'm aroused and writing this, this is 
from my state to your own

Floridh: Azure, exposed, shot from beneath by 
pool-side, black background:
cynthia, i want your tongue against me alan,
please don't be upset, jack, alan write me down,
peter, azure inscribes me, i am everything you
want, i am everything you could possibly want

Floridi: Azure, still naked from waist down,
astride pool-side left-hand beach chair, blue 
shirt (right-hand chair empty, partially
visible):
i am mad. i am completely out of my mind.

Floridj: Alan naked, lying back, right-hand
beach chair (left-hand beach chair empty,
partially visible), camera head-on:
i'm writing this, azure in the drowning pool, she
takes her lovers with her, she says, they're not as
good as you are, they couldn't be, they're down
there, she's pointing, i'm aroused, this is the
beginning of the game, this is the ending: how
the world works and everyone dies

Floridk: Two empty beach chairs, adjustable
actually, the right-hand one partially supine, the
left-hand one partially erect, no text.


Analysis: 

Azure and I live alone together. We have no friends. I think: We are
horrors. Again and again our story turns on us. Our story repeats like a
bad record. Our story decays. We go for a drive. We drive long and hard
and nowhere. There is nowhere to go. We return home. Sometimes I go and
teach. I face students. We leave. We get in the car and drive long and
hard and nowhere. We go and return and look at each other. We stare at
each other. We wrestle each other to the ground. We take our clothes off.
We put them on.  We strangle ourselves. We turn ourselves inside out.

We are walking advertisements for art and poetry. I swim in the black
pool, the blue-green pool like skin. I swim two lengths beneath the
surface. I have heard you can pass out and keep swimming. You can be
swimming and drowning underwater. The surface looks: You are alive, you
are perfect person. The depth looks up: You are still swimming and you are
drowning.

How can you drown in so much beauty. We go to the pool and photograph. We
return for image and text, for art and poetry, for gimp and photoshop, for
perl and protocol, for process and program. Online we teeter on the brink
of culture. It is at the edge of the pool. The edge is an outline of
water. The apartment complex is Everglades reclaimed. At night I dream
alligators. I am ungainly; I can move fast, strike. No one is here. I am
thick-scaled, reptilian. My brain slips to edges. My brain swims. My brain 
swims beneath.

Analysis:

Too much work on exposure. Too much exhibitionism, too much exhibition. As 
if the body could be fixed, pierced, held in position. As if the world 
were pure exchange. What other information we might provide.

Too many circuits of sexual tension, terror, power, language withdrawn in 
the other face of the body, the other body of the face.

Work a caricature of itself. Stale work. Work which should have remained 
stillborn. Dead work. Repetitive work. Work of the reflex arc, work of the 
twitch. 

Analysis:

Tearing apart, artist and model. The apartment is silent. Azure reads
upstairs; I type this on a laptop borrowed from the university. The
university has closed down new media. New media is tainted, condemned.  
Images leak out: Our exposure is that of the naughty politics of the
world. I keep quiet about my work at the school. I show no one. I am 
close to slaughter. 

I continue to swim submerged. At the edge, I will push and push off. I
will make the other side.

"rant" so be it. You're too good for us, Alan Sondheim, you're a piece of 
dirt. I am sending you a warning: don't investigate any further. You don't 
want to know and you don't want to know. Parts of this text are true. 

woman, young woman, girl, there are three men. one of them is speaking to
another. the girl is silent. the girl just sits there. she is so fragile.  
o fragile woman, young girl, girl. one of the men screams. the girl just
sits there. the man is very wise. the man is second-most wise. he says to
the other man, the most wise. she just sits there. oh what do i do. who
says the most wise, the woman, young woman, girl. oh oh, the third will
do, he is not so wise, call the third. they jump about many places. the
third comes, he is not so wise. with his fingers the woman, young girl,

I am married to a lawyer. Don't ask why you've been terminated. I know how 
to answer. I know when to keep quiet. You will die if you ask questions. 
You always ask too many questions. You are never content. Alan Sondheim, 
you are never content. Alan Sondheim, you are about to cross the "plane." 
The "plane" is very broad and wide. With his fingers, Alan Sondheim, is

The Find of the Chest from Late Edo


I own a small Japanese chest from the late Edo or early Meiji period. I
found it at a yard sale in Miami. It was in 28 pieces, fairly broken up.  
The seller, who was an interior decorator, suggested I take the drawers
out and use some as knick-knacks. I thought of mono no aware. She sold it
to me for 5 dollars. I took it home and carefully repaired it. It is
missing one cover and one small drawer rail. It is about 18" x 14" x 9".
It is not very large. It has six drawers and two small shelves. The
pictures are delicate and beautifully rendered. The drawers are decorated
with gold on black lacquer background. The largest drawer stretches the
width of the chest and portrays two samurai and an armored horse against a
landscape. The other drawers have floral, landscape, or miscellaneous
motifs. There is a beautiful crab, several flowers, a boat formed with two
golden lines.The decorations on the top and sides are stylized fans. The
lower side of the bottom of the three smallest drawers have a sign _ro_ on
them. I think this stands for satisfactory - the decorations were okayed.
The piece was probably made in a small workshop. There are engraved metal
reinforcements on many of the corners. These are held in place with small
hand-made nails. This is a terrific piece. There are two hinges in the
middle of the chest and a metal receptacle for a lock on a strip of wood
reinforcing the bottom. At one time, a small cover must have been present,
partially covering the drawers and/or shelves. The background lacquer is
black, almost dark brown in places. The back of the chest was painted with
another black lacquer that has mostly peeled off. I used Elmer's glue for
repairing the chest, and cleaned it softly, first with water, and then
with Pledge. The lacquer is flaked in many places. The chest is what a
find. The drawers have small turned ivory pulls on them, except for one,
which has a small engraved metal handle. One of the other drawers shows
signs of being converted from a similar metal handle to an ivory pull. I
have many small Buddhist relics in the chest, but almost all of them are
modern.

Of the Latter Days and what you might hear


And of unto your inner worlds, where you must die. It makes no difference,
whether you make peace. And of course one always hopes that embracing the
worst, overcomes. And of course that is a myth. We have not escaped the
fire, to speak.

Do not make peace. For whom shall you make peace. Do not seek your hearts. 
For whom shall you seek your hearts.

...

This is temporary. You may not receive this. You may receive this only on 
a temporary basis. With the proliferation of small-scale nuclear devices, 
the Internet is in imminent danger of collapse. There may be days, weeks, 
months, a few years, left. This is the end-game of culture. Your knowledge 
is useless. Don't fret our media.

But it is a privilege to read this. It is a privilege to witness the
curtain coming down on the future. It is a privilege to recognize that
little will remain on the other side - that later, much later, something
else might inscribe similar words to these.

Later, much later, something else might read them, but not these, but 
others.

There are too many bombs; there is the untoward simplicity of the bomb. It 
is human to hate, human to take out one's enemy at the risk of one's life. 
Sacrifice is the core and kernel of being human; hate is the shell that 
derives destruction. 

These lines are written between one destruction and another, between one 
and another finality. They are produced on the road to another's paradise 
and the dissembling of our own.

...

The world frantically holds peace concerts. The world frantically produces
beautiful music reaching throughout heavens and earths. The world produces
books, fashion, songs, operas, magazines, articles, psalms, poems, epics,
sculptures, paintings, puppet-shows, cinema, theater, whole literatures,
all in the name of peace. The world produces screams, terrors, whimpers,
moans, cries and whispers, all begging for peace, caterwauling for peace,
yelling for peace.

Human beings scurry in all directions. Plants burn. Rivers burn. Animals
are blinded. Lesions develop. There are rumors of bombs. There is no
electric. Servers and routers are silenced.

I will stand up and sit down. I will be the prophet of the last and latter
days. I will type on dying keyboards, dead laptops. My words are the words
of truth. My words die from crippled fingers. My words die in ten throats.
My words die in one. My words are lesions.

...

Countdown. This is written from the future to the past. This has already 
been written. This will already have been written. This will already have 
not been read.

Not by us. Not by something else.

Listen: We are all dead. Listen: It is too late now. The poison is here.  
Listen: It is time to make our peace. Listen: It is time to listen to
ourselves. This is the end of the sentence to which we are sentenced.

No one will make peace. No one will listen to another. It is the nature of 
being human. It is human to hate. It is human to act on that hate. We will 
dance until we are burned alive. We will dance with our lesions. We will 
dance and destroy. We will go to heaven. We will take you with us.

It takes only one. Technology: It takes less than one. One minus one is 
zero. It will take nothing. It will take nothing at all.

Hello Pakistan will you not listen to us. Give us your weapons. Hello USA 
please listen to us. Give us your weapons. Hello India, Israel, China, 
France, Germany, Belgium, England, Russia, Sumer, Latvia, Babylonia, Chad, 
Japan, Italy, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Canada, give us your weapons.

We will take your weapons and we will beat them into weapons. We will take
your weapons and we will make a column of ash and smoke, fire and debris,
radiation and cloud, from pole to pole, an axis of fury, an axis of death
and destruction. We will cleanse the earth. We will boil the oceans. We
will flood the lands. We will freeze the oceans. We will burn flesh. We
will fuck our enemies. We will arrive in paradise. We will arrive in
heaven. We have removed our enemies. We have removed your enemies. We do
this out of our own goodwill, out of the hearts of men. We do this out of
kindness and charity. We have removed their hearts.

...

But we write between one destruction and another. At the risk of boring
you: We write between one destruction and another. We write into the air
we breathe. We write through the slaughter, onslaught of lesions always
already among us. We write through our sickness. We write for the decades
of routers and servers. We write for the years of wireless, months of
optical, weeks and days of pdas, minutes of broadband, seconds of
remaining life. We write for audience of one, for audience of one-half,
for audience already tending towards zero. We write for the terror among
us and the success of that terror, and its end.

We write for an improbable length. It takes nothing. It takes nothing at 
all.

We write for our lesions, our implacable hatreds. It takes nothing. It 
takes nothing at all.

We write in order to kill. We write against one another. There is no other 
writing. We write the enunciation of slaughter. We write its emancipation.

We write in order to be silenced. We write in order to be successful. We
are successful. We write for an irrational number.

It is a matter of time; it is a matter of nothing else. And we write for
the silence to follow. We are at the end of days. We are of the end. We
are the meat of the end, the flesh of the end. We are of the flesh and its 
lesions. 

We are not improbable. We are not improbable at all. We are most probable. 
Of this I am sure: We are most probable.

It takes nothing. It takes nothing at all.

"The Gaga Films," by Jennifer


I went to the cinema on the tram down the hill. I often went this way for 
other reasons but wasn't sure where I was. I was in company of a couple of 
experimental filmmakers. They told me about the place. It was in a clap- 
board house remodeled as an underground film venue. It was $15 to get in. 
I only had $8 Canadian. I left and came back; I found $14 US. I hoped I 
could make up the difference. They were talking about "The Gaga" - the two 
films about "The Gaga" - and had I seen them? The films were the most 
politically astute of the century. "The Gaga" was also "La Gaga" and I 
hadn't seen them. I was missing so much. "The Gaga" wasn't playing that 
night.

Interpretation

"The Gaga" is the violent absurdity that drives late-capitalism. "The 
Gaga" has always existed, but was quiescent in traditional capitalism - 
it could never appear under hierarchy, but only interstitially in the 
Network. As the Network grew, through late-capitalism and postmodernity 
into terror, The Gaga appeared - first as a peripheral symptom, then 
increasingly as an engine driving the whole. The Gaga is a projection, 
perhaps derived from Cruickshank's 19th-century Locomotive - "They've gone 
loco" - images of the confluence of steam and imperial capital. The Gaga, 
like the Japanese Kappa, is a figure at once vulnerable and dangerous. It 
is vulnerable because it resides in the Network, a post-Situationist 
entity susceptible to major and minor illness or decay - through the 
strategic application of hacking and other disruptive techniques. The Gaga 
is utterly inhuman, nonhuman, inhumane; all of The Gaga films are in 
black-and-white, as if to indicate, from the mode of representation 
itself, the structural and nodal nature of The Gaga. The Gaga is most 
often described in these films by means of chalkboard lectures, diagrams 
in pencil, voice-overs, and talks. Computers and digital effects are 
rarely used; they are the centrifugal residue of The Gaga, incapable of 
anything more. It seems paradoxical that The Gaga both underlies the skein 
and is within it; the skein is its flesh and blood, and a computer repre- 
sentation would be nothing more than a desiccated and useless sample of 
its tissue. For it is clear that The Gaga is continually in process, that 
it participates in the quantum states known as superimpositions, that it 
is always extended beyond itself, non-boolean, gestural, genderless. A 
feminist professor appears in one of the films, delineating The Gaga, 
demonstrating its difference and distinction from a feminist fluidity that 
absorbs and gives, breaks down the transitive. She, like all other actors 
in these works, is defined as such - "a feminist professor" - in subtitles 
that also list "a working-class hero" - "a factory worker" - "a consumer" 
- even though an attempt is made, beyond analysis, to develop a romance - 
"a lover" - "another lover" - against the constant and broken, jump-cut 
description that constitutes the style of the films. The Gaga alone, like 
the Virgin of the Virgin Mary, like the sealed womb, is never described, 
always clothed in the Network. It is clear that The Gaga is part of the 
distribution of the films, that the audience, as in violent pornography, 
is implicated, just as The Gaga is implacable. The implacability is 
portrayed in terms of gray zones; the black-and-white occupies, for the 
most part, an uneasy middle ground, most of the time. There are never any 
"true" whites, "true" brightness, in the films; instead, starting from an 
upper middle gray, the films descend into murky darkness, as if they were 
reproduced several times over, from an earlier, and now lost, model. The 
result of all of this is a clear indication that we, ourselves, have lost 
the power of brilliance, of brightness, of that clear light permitting 
analysis; instead, our theoretical explanations begin in that gray area 
where language proliferates, cut off from the clarity of projection and 
representation. These explanations likewise descend into darkness, where 
they are part and parcel of the substance of the world, where they are 
within and without, suffused with The Gaga, from which, like the real 
weight of the curtain of iron, there is no escape. It is no wonder that 
both films are titled "The Gaga" as well; the resulting confusion in talk 
and analysis (some speak of "Gaga A," "Gaga B," "First and Second Gaga," 
etc.) only serves to reconfirm their internal direction. If there is any 
brilliance in the world, it is clear, it is to be found in the films 
themselves; nowhere else in culture is analysis so devastating, accurate, 
and beyond recall. The films are undated; the names of the participants 
involved are never given; even their origin remains, not a mystery, but 
simply unknown. Go see "The Gaga"; everything else falls, into place.

crust. this is a moment to think about intelligence, the intelligence of
the world, breaking out of the loop. this is the breaking out.  .  :this
is the way the aging brain works. neurons skein, tangle, interlace, inter-
weave. some die off. there are submerged strata absorbed by the other. the
other is transformed into others. wisdom is the networks among the others.
wisdom is the limestone, the submergence. wisdom is the marl gathered
beneath the peat. there are large saw palmettos at chikeka. the brain is
gathered among the confluence of life. the brain is self-reflecting,
resonant, subsumption architecture. wisdom is the making-manifest of the
network. wisdom is the culling of extraneity.:at chikeka, two men were
fishing. we went through the hardwood hammock. a little girl took some

a fair proportion of the viewer's angle of vision. color and textual
attributes are also indeterminate, irrelevant, peripheral" Oil on white
canvas, black text in imitation of courier." this title affixed to white
label, traditionally placed to the left of the painting at an indetermin-
ate distance. beneath: "THESE ARE THE FIRST ERRORS."  description of
painting:  "Oil on white canvas, black text in imitation of courier." Text
rescued from the painting:

Upper left: "i reside here, huddled in flight within the corner. it's
comfortable but requires energy, continuous maintenance. one false slip
and i crash. this is half-wrecking zone, half-home. no one imagines i'm
here; it's safe. someone or something else ... requires the same amount of
energy ... has no place to huddle ... out in the open ... who knows "

Upper middle: "this is impossible, all this energy; i'm sliding back and
forth; you can't get to me; you can't find me; you know i'm not cornered;  
i can never be cornered; this is the sky, the heavens, the empyrean; this
isn't the corner; the corner's always artifice; the corner takes a
different kind of energy, a push; here it's towards the vertical; i'm
always heading up, against the edge; the edge is a horizontal line"

Upper right: "The edge is a point. The edge is one-dimensional. I gather
towards the point. The point is natural; it's origin. It takes energy to
remain in the vicinity of the point. The point marks the edge of the roof.  
This is a roof, neither sky nor heaven. You can always find me by my
coordinates. This is the Cartesian fetishization of the real. This is the
last of the systems of defense."

Middle left: "I'm against the margin, the margin is a line, a vector, the
margin points to the roof, the sky, the pole at pagoda center, I'm there,
rubbed raw against the Thing, vertical and human, walking, not fucking, at
attention, not supine, nothing's beyond the left; nothing's left of it."

Center: "there's nowhere, there are names and no names, there are things
and no things, there's nothing to grasp, i'm naked, vulnerable, you can
see all of me, you can see through me, i'm the punctum of representation,
this is the vanishing-point of the phenomenology of the real, arms and
legs, mountains and valleys, waters and locomotives, herons and pagodas in
all directions, frameworks and annihilations, states and processes, trans-
formations, the name leaks, suppurations, double dimensions, i'm sliding
in every direction, i can't see the lines or points, a spread or stain,
splayed or residue, abject, the stigmata of effacement of the other, the
strategic game, i.e. the location of the game, played out"

Middle right: "This is it - the vertical body - compressed against the bar
of the real - there's a bit of support for it - the vertical dimension,
hierarchy - the frame's holding - always aware of the frame - this could
be an infinite plane extending from here - imagine the possibilities -
lungs and breathing - in the distance - nothing at all - I remember the
center - I couldn't work there - couldn't begin or end there - all that
blanked space - nothing - but here - there's a moment of parallel - every
point has that - moment of perpendicular - the same - whole pencils of
lines - filling in the interstices - cubisms of all sorts - spectacles of
abstraction - styles - genres - I'm safe here - I could go on and on - "

Lower left: "she's down in the corner... she's there with him... they're
so safe... they're sleeping... look at them sleep... they can do anything
here... this holds the rest of the image... this is the source of all rep-
resentation... this doesn't have to do anything... this can't do anything
... another of the zero-dimensionals... they're fucking now... now they're
drinking... they're whispering... i can almost hear them... they don't
have to maintain anything... they're not sliding anywhere... they're
cuddling... they're quiet and serene... they're at rest... they're holding
their own... garnering sweetness and light... "

Lower middle: "What are you thinking of? We're sliding back and forth?  
We're the base of all things! We're the foundation! What are we going to
do? Is this the horizon at your foot? This is the foreground of every
world! This is the earth against the ungraspable mysteries reaching
upwards beyond the possibility of body, organism, original face! Are you
claiming essentialism? Wouldn't this be essentialism, if such, if any,
were the case? Of course, still it takes energy to hold on! It takes a bit
of energy to avoid sliding to the point! Isn't the point zero? Isn't the
point nothing at all? Look, an animal! Look, names and contours! Look, all
sorts of things?"

Lower right: "outlaw grasps of forms and substances, crashed caches of
brushstrokes and inscriptions, compression algorithms of conversations and
languages: LOOK WE'RE SAFE HERE TOO: the wall of the work where the
signature sits: HERE: anywhere but there are expectations: IT'S CROWDING
US OUT: what is: the names: all the names: but they're safe, the store-
house: store-house of the real: something else, something else: I'LL LOOK
IT UP; demarcation one again of origins: IT SAYS HERE AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT:  
one moment, one moment: "

lit from an indeterminate distance, THIS IS AN ERROR, in consideration of
the canvas - nevertheless, it's there _to be read_ as if there were an
adjudicated syntax, acceptable, beyond which the world is differend.
