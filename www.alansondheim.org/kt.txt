

OINTMENT


BECAUSE JENNIFER could 'walk the walk' and 'talk the talk,' because Jenni-
fer dissected the Republican Party precisely as that area beneath the en-
crusted area of the scab, pus-filled and huddled against the all-too-fee-
ble skin, I grant her permission to speak "now, taking over from Alan, al-
though you might not recognize the difference, only that the broken end-
ings of each and every line imply the cauterization of the subject, nece-
ssarily recommencing once again as speech"; no matter, in fact, that ini-
tial reactions tend towards closure. For it is the very _sight_ of Jenni-
fer's "speaking that announces my presence, as if a voice or scream em-
anating from the prison house to which we are all bodily suspect." Never-
theless, not precisely the _sight,_ but the sight as _signifier,_ herald-
ing "a Jennifer-enunciation, the blank neutrality of the symbolic stand-
ing-in for myself" - whether or not recognized by the reader, which cons-
titutes another narrative altogether. "I'm about politics, says the recum-
bent Jennifer, but I'm also about _me._ And if you want to know _me,_ ob-
viously you have to be able to read," at least just a little. In "Jenni-
fer, enunciation meets annunciation, ointment meets ointment, and obvious-
ly as well, that's me all over."

Evidence


"O Violent Sun of death-white Screen piercing Night festered with broken
Letters! You paste my Skin against your own, rip Flesh from Violated Face!
Your Whiteness slashes knife-like through Eyes which split; Liquid seeps
as World turns White and Mouth-Wide. Migraines harbor Entrails at the per-
iphery of wounded Vision. Screen offers no escape; Screen offers Surgery
and pain, suppurations and White cuts through Cheek and Bone and Throat
where Words are made. Language is Hideous Networked, Language is All there
is, Bleary Images, Imaginary 'just on the other side of the glass.' BUT I
CANNOT ABIDE PLEASURE fucked against White Screen, Mouth-Wide. IT BURNS!
IT BURNS! White and Violent Sun always already dead," and there is more
about the cauterization effect of the knife cutting by virtue of the bril-
liance of the workstation screen against the blackness of the night out-
side. It seems as if this could continue indefinitely, protesting against
vision and clarity - which can be related to the production of visual epi-
phenomena produced by early stages of migraine (which "harbor Entrails" as
indicated in the text). God, why does truth come so often in stereotypes -
both in content and in style? The capitals already give it away as a sim-
ulacrum of the crazed. One can only imitate so far, before the Real takes
hold once again - but then this is beneath the sign of migraine - not to
mention carpal-tunnel syndrome - and just about anything is excusable
under these conditions.

Fuck Me,

Jennifer says exactly, sheds her skin; Jennifer knows that she wants in:
"And before the session was over, she added: 'Now you have to help me make
you disappear, because I think your desire to cure me is getting in the
way of the human things I can experience.'" (Professeur Pierre Fedida, A
Borderline State of Humanity and the Fragmented Ego of the Analyst, in The
Subject and the Self, Lacan and American Psychoanalysis, eds. Gurewich and
Tort.)

In spite of the length of the attribution, matching precisely the length
of my penis in relation to the length of Jennifer's textual exegesis, both
in a state of relative arousal, it is more than pertinent

What says Jennifer-Exactly is pertinent? Your mucilage-masquerade? Dystro-
phic muscularity? "Immediately afterwards, she said, in the session, that
men in the street were starting to come on to her 'in a disgusting way,
because they don't even know how to fuck a woman.' [sic] This would always
happen whenever she slowed her pace; 'I have to walk like a metal blade,'
she said," (ibid.) cutting tendons into _resonant mass._ To the extent of
the penis as subterfuge for the _erect body,_ already half-flaccid

Stop crawling, screams Jennifer, her exclamation point stolen by me, redu-
cing her to a whisper: did you hear that... 

Did I hear what; already, I'm that suppurating ball of flesh she's made
sure you've read about. The man-hole cover outside this place blew earlier
tonight, filling my sky and my lungs with acrid smoke. Cables on fire,
the electric fluttered like her thick heart beneath her ribs and heavy
breasts. My breasts aren't, Jennifer began

Spurious, I detumesced, Jennifer spurted white liquid out of her mouth and

Shut up, I said, you're killing me. Shut up, Jennifer said, I'm killing
you.

everything

tonight or maybe it was last night there was a dislocation in my jaw and
my mouth couldn't close. i went into the bathroom and brushed it with a
special tool of compacted close hard bristles. blood filled my mouth and
bits of tissue which i spit up into the sink. i used mouthwash to cleanse
the area which had previously been unknown to me, although the site of two
botched root-canals. i then used a high-pressure water probe to further
clean the area, after which the pain was intense; i tried to sleep and was
unable to do anything. it was because i couldn't do anything that i tried
to sleep. this had nothing to do with the tooth, but with the condition of
the jawbone and the overlaying tissue. the tooth is okay, but moaning i
got up again and went to the next door neighbors' where i begged for whis-
key. i drank a large glass of whisky and had some antibiotics as well,
along with various pain killers. the pain went away, maybe taking part of
my brain along with it. i value my brain more than anything; if i lose my
ability to write, i'll be a suicide, no longer existent. well now as you
can tell, i can't think, can't separate the real from the virtual, i'm
numbed against the powers of jennifer and julu, unanesthetized against the
virtues of nikuko. i worry about those moments in my life where the pain
will be so extreme that my body will be my life, not my mental pain, but
those instantiations which promulgate the body as a forthcoming feature
that brooks no others. those of you who live in this state, you need be
heros, you can live in ways that i can't. with the pain, isolation looms
large, turns me pathetic with the neighbors, i crawl to their door, knock
knock. what does this have to do with the real when the real can't be
thought. between madness and suicide, this pain looms. do i need atten-
tion. you bet.

Happiness

When I know I can't possibly do better than I'm doing, that this is _it_ -
then I can relax and keep on doing it. If I'm ill or in pain, then I know
that just about anything is the best I can do, just with the doing of any-
thing. I have a friend who lived with my second wife and said to me, well,
Alan, I said to her, I'm always doing the very best I can, and if it's not
good enough for you, then you should leave, because there's nothing else I
can do. In one of my texts, upon leaving Los Angeles for Tasmania, I wrote
that I was pushed to the limit and so I was not responsible for anything
beyond that because there was nothing else I could do. Not often, but on
occasion, I will be somewhere, when for a time I will have felt that I did
"good," and that fills me with satisfaction. Very rarely will I feel that
I have achieved a perfect moment, and at that point, I'm likely to cry, in
a manner similar to the Heian nobility, being overcome by emotion. Usually
these moments are when I feel that this is in fact the best of all possi-
ble worlds, in which I am doing my very best. I will watch myself trying
to do my very best, and so much of the time I will fail, but even then, in
the very small, I am sure I am doing my very best.

metaphysics of transcendence


when abscess pain takes over the mouth, nothing happens; topical anesthe-
tic or antibiotic or pain-killer do little. at the moment, i can hardly
think, think in a whisper between lightnings: i want the jaw removed. the
point, though, is that among these flashes, another brilliant insight -
that in the abscess, imminence and transcendence, universal and particu-
lar, take over the body - it's not that the region of the jaw expands,
calling attention to itself, but that the body is absorbed in the locus of
pain. in fact, one might say that there is no body, or that the body is
one of becoming-animal - the pain, which is now the phenomenological hori-
zon as a totality (so to speak among the flashes), annihilates the project
of the subject (which is collapsed to the flatness of brute avoidance).
let us now say further that metaphysics itself is the production of
wounds, diseases, pains - all irrupting within and through the body, and
all providing lessons in relatives, absolutes, subjects, objects, ideals,
and the subversion of the true, the beautiful, and the good, wherever,
whatever, and whomever they might be (just as another flash occurs, just
as pain seals off, forecloses, the argument). (in these ages of modernisms
and postmodernisms, we are far from the lessons of the wound.) (yes, there
are wounds, more than ever.) (yes, that is not what i meant.)

muffled-answer-to-the-universe sutra

so i've got new antibiotics in me and there's no pain at all, but my ear
buzzing - tinnitus - is louder than ever, and i'm feeling muffled, as if
oxygen were cut off, poisons oozing out of every pore, eyes bleary and un-
focused. i'm halfway back into the womb; the outer world which i have i-
dentified as a _room,_ asserts itself as dangerouly uncomfortable - chills
and heartburns and odors. my dreams have more clarity than this; the mind
runs riot when the body cuts lose. when i die i'll see and understand
everything and i'll have a telephone in my cremation jar just like houdini
so i can call you and give you the understanding. no, i can do that now,
as a result of my condition. it's simply neti neti or another way of
thinking about it is that life interferes with the absolute meaningless-
ness and aimlessness of the universe, but not for much, and not for long.
right now i feel as if filthy pillows were surrounding my skull. in war-
rior zen there was a one-word sutra and a no-word sutra. this is far too
much of a no-sutra word. alan is my name.

Home///Free


What are the markers, spoors, traces of homesteading in cyberspace? The
server and email address provide portals, as do the dynamic or fixed IP.
The email address connects to a name, <name> <login>@<address>, roughly.
This name is variable. 

Online, one might remain in: newsfeeds, tickerfeeds, other pushfeeds;
personal email programs; telnet; java-enabled chats, MOOs, MUDs; dialup
access; ytalk and other chats; GUI MOOs, etc.; realaudio and realvideo
entertainments.

Any of these might be home, but reserve home for those areas in which pro-
jection is also possible; that would include, for example, my.yahoo, email
lists, etc. So home can be push and pull (if these words still have any
credence at all.)

Think of homesteading in newsgroups, email lists, temporary and permanent
chats, IRC, GUI MOOs, more traditional MOOs, MUDs, etc. What are the mark-
ers, etc.? Certainly, the chosen name is one; as well as the @desc (chosen
description). There may be the simulacrum of body (ytalk) or place (@dig
or home commands on MOOs). There may be the familiarity of local common
histories. There may be the comfort of understanding the underlying soft-
ware and command structure.

It seems a degree of comfort is warranted, even though that may be acerbic
- for example, someone continually breaking into an IRC channel to cause
trouble.

Why does it bother someone so much to be booted from an email list? Why
are people attacked on lists bothered so much? It has to do with comfort.

When one has one's clothing slightly untucked, the discomfort can be way
out of proportion to the physical state. The same with food lodged between
the teeth, a pillow slightly misarranged on the bed, an itch. All of these
things relate to the phenomenology of the bodily enclosure - how the sub-
ject perceives hirself. It takes a pinprick to deflate a balloon, and com-
fort is measured by the projection of a totality that inauthentically
appears or is made to appear as if it is not constituted, but (taken for)
granted - a nest. Nesting involves completion, history, comfort, knowledge
of topography and building and programming, the welcoming of one's neigh-
bors and a common mythos. Nesting involve sleeping in peace, without viral
disturbance.

One can always delete _x's_ posts on an email list, as an example, if they
create discomfort. But one rarely does (at least by hand - filtering is
another matter, that of the machinic, altogether); the posts come in,
there are others replying to them - they create an aura. The totality of
Being is disturbed, disrupted by beings. Totality relates to Volk as well
as peace, totalitarianism as well as democracy.

The trace, spoor, track, always encircles itself; a Jordan curve, it car-
ries the signifier of foreclosing, a literal double-crossing necessary to
return to the outside. Comfort, the name, the knowledge, the very stars in
the sky - all contribute to the firewall. The firewall is defined by its
weakest link; the longest Jordan curve (defined as a curve which cuts the
plane in two) becomes a line segment with the smallest break; a punctured
sphere becomes the plane, as the body expires. 

These are primitive, defensive reactions, repressions, sublimations, for-
tifications. These hold the body in abeyance in relation to other bodies,
which are friendly and comforting by fiat, dangerous and discomforting,
also by fiat. The signs and the absence of signs, the shimmering of signs
across constituted boundaries signifying culture, are all there. 

These are the signs of Babel and of babble. Most of them exist within the
realm of affect, are catylized by language, by the linguistic. The psycho-
analytical aura which creates the meaning of the trace, the spoor, the
track, is pre-symbolic - or read in other codes, the usual meataphor (sic)
of the (auto)immune system. On a certain fundamental level, almost never
entertained, the politics of identity becomes the identity of politics,
far below the level of the inscription, prevalent among the disorderings
of the drives and the biologic.

Needless to say all of this is _manifest,_ in one way or another, among
the files and datastreams of cyberspace as well. The difficulty is to
ignore or bypass the very signifiers that bring the symptom to our atten-
tion, return beyond or within the electronic to the level of the chthonic
or inchoate. There the absolute is absolved, definitions suffuse, and
avatars, like names, become emanations. And there as well, hierarchy and
the aristotelian logics of the everyday disappear, replaced by superim-
positions, tangled holarchies, and gaps - not only in knowledge, but what
constitutes knowledge itself. (See Information in the Brain, Ira Black,
for examples.)

Read Meat


Let us call her Jennifer, who operated in my mouth, discovering two con-
nected large abscesses and a third smaller, both in the upper jaw. Let us
describe the miraculous lasers and their operations, white-green light,
red-orange light, blue-white light. Then we are ready for the splitting of
meat and psyche: for as Jennifer applied herself to the fiber-optic carry-
ing, not packets, but energy for cutting and cauterizing, the mouth-meat
is seared, cooked, and smoked; and let us call Alan, this patient under-
going such treatment, wearing dim heavy and green protective goggles. Then
notice with Alan (now on codeine, novacaine, ibuprofen, antibiotics), the
smoke and odor emanating (as Jennifer has emanated) from his mouth, pre-
cisely, as he explains to Jennifer, of the scent of succulent and well-
cooked roast beef. And while Alan rarely engages in red-meat (more like I
am read meat, says Jennifer, aroused now by all this talk), this scent,
from his own flesh and blood (as I would be, says Jennifer) leads to a
certain hunger on Alan's part; he finds himself dreaming of a beautiful
meal of roast beef, garnered from his own flesh, perhaps (if not from
Jennifer's, she muses). Self-cannibalism, a form of the auto-chthonic, and
I am ready for her devouring. Like Ouroboros, metaphysics eats its _tale._


__________________________________________________________________________


Bandaged

My mouth is bandaged internally, cloth compressed against the exterior
and interior gums of the upper jaw, upper two quadrants. I speak through
cloth, as if I've ingested Jennifer's panties. Quietly, a way to turn
cotton. It's healing as Jennifer becomes part of me, my mouth her parts.
Outside, snow. My mouth will have none of it. My mouth closes over my
cloth. The voice is slightly flat when opened as resonance, absorbed,
turns back into heat. I yearn that my mouth reach open to you, reach for
you. I yearn my mouth with supplication, that my words are heard and
comprehension. 

In short days, my bandages will fall off or out; the naked skin will con-
tinue healing. There are no sutures, nothing holding tissues in place, but
the strength of tissues. The mouth forms, naturally, its own hole. When I
speak, it is accompanied by the tiniest of cries and offerings. The great
joy that is my mouth remains unacknowledged.

Of Video with C.


Why did I masturbate in front of C. when she dared me? 
Later, she dominated in video and audio, almost apologetically.
She told so many stories, looking directly at the camera.
Space surrounded her in a matrix that was nearly perfect.
It was that first time, exposing myself, that established the theatrical.
We made many scenes together, each full of control, desire, loss.
She wrote the word 'lonly' on my penis, misspelled and tumescent.
I played the naked Christ to her insolvent Madonna.
The greatest sin is delight in the fabric of the imaginary.
Her eyes devoured me as I spread my legs; my body was already written.
On the videos, the lonly penis was overlaid with grids, inscriptions.
The greater my arousal, the more intense our tiny worlds and stories.
She could talk me up and down; shaved, I lost my body in her reflection.
That first time, she was camera, and mirror; she was subject and object.
It was there that Jennifer was conceived, in the dampness of the day.
I felt skulls and skeletons emanating from my body.
I felt the expulsion of organs, my useless penis covered with white milk.
No one could breathe from it, no one could gain nourishment.
I played the naked Magdalene to her insolvent Christ.
The camera penetrated me, my body entwined with the language of rope.
The camera spelled its name across my insolent topography, Julu.
She would take me to the brink of the naked and pubescent lip.
Within the space between C. and me, the avatars huddled and conversed.
Later, I would hear them, writing down each and every conversation.
At that point, only Nikuko took advantage of my mouth and ass.
On that day, the camera took me into cyberspace.
That night, erect and haunted, I could only dream in white.


________________________________________________________________________



Split and Bandage

Just as playing my repaired shakuhachi led to the loosening of the banda-
ges around my teeth, and their eventual expulsion, so does the expulsion
and binding of the signifer lead to a loosening of the imaginary. Just as
the splits in the bamboo of the shakuhachi head led to six bands holding
the instrument tight together, so does the potential well of the stability
of the signifier exist in in contradistinction to the chaotic wavering of
the mind, holding its own in relation to the real. Just as the dream is a
binding of such chaos, so is culture always already a binding, holding the
object within a nonequilibrium dynamics, that, similar to space-time in
relation to gravitation, defines the object. Just as the subject, so as
the object; just as the object, so as the subject. Just as space-time, so
the bindings of the territorializations of musical structures, and just as
music, so the construct of beings in relation to Being. Just as playing is
Being, so are beings subject and object, and just as subject and object
are superimpositions, so are bindings the immanence of the loosening of
inscription. Just as the splitting of the bamboo shakuhachi, so too the
coagulation and dispersion of the object. Just as the inscribing, so as
the telling, and just as the telling, so as the naming. Just as the note
which appears through the playing of the bound shakuhachi, so as the tenor
or note of this text, appearing through the binding of metaphor and Being,
inscribed through beings, always of signifiers, always holding the crack
of the real against itself, oneself, the other.

STUPID THING NO PROGRESS NO NO

(BAD STUPID THING) 
After all is said (because I can't say any more) and done (because I can't
do any more), the truth of the matter comes to the foreground - that there
is no progression in my work, that theory has remained stillborn, that
concepts are formed (s/ms, ascii unconscious, language dispersion theory),
only to be abandoned - that Honey and Travis played with Ballard, that
Jennifer and Julu played with Lingis and Heidegger, that Nikuko played
with Trinh and Spivak - that they discarded the games, contributed nothing
and no thing - that neologisms such as 'defuge' or 'wryting' have had lim-
ited usage, sloshing around in the puddles of my work, and constellations
such as 'list aura' would have been discovered anyway - that I've turned
inward far too often as an excuse for sloppy research, as if filth could
somehow replace hard research - that I've raised sexuality to such a high
and over-determined degree of explanation that the scaffolding falls apart
\\/\\\//\\\//\\\/\\/THIS IS THE HUMP OF THE PARAGRAPH/\\\/\\/\\\/\/\\\//\/
- but above all, as I said at the beginning - that there is no progression
- that sexuality raises itself, fucking, collapsing in repeated penetra-
tions - that filth is filthy, washing away clarity - that 'list aura' sim-
ply moves from fleshmeet to fleshmeat, 'wryting' only goes so far extend-
ing emanations out of the suppurating flesh of my own body - that 'defuge'
evinces itself precisely in these moments of curlicue, returning back
again, recutting through decathection and exhaustion the same worn-out
paths - that Nikuko, Julu, and Jennifer scream through voices of others,
in order that their own might be heard - at which point they move through
a world of gaps and omissions, dismemberments and psychoses - that Honey
and Travis lie discarded at the bottom of a ditch, their legs spread,
sprays of signifiers, spews and emissions burying both of them in so much
virtual concrete - that languages themselves are dispersed, that these
texts no longer "work, that s/ms always return to sado-masochisms and the
repetition of useless theatricality - that theory is never thought through
sufficiently - that it's as if I would begin over and over again, because
there's been no progress at all, not even now - everything ventured, noth-
ing gained - 
(BAD STUPID THING)


__________________________________________________________________________


Irritations of the Textual Politics


When the symptom totalizes, the text seems awkward, misapprehended, no
longer a living / organic being. When the lines are too short or too long,
when the lines tend to become shorter or longer throughout a paragraph,
creating the appearance of a slope. When the lines are too ragged. When
breaks occur in the wrong places in long single syllables - or don't oc-
cur, leaving gaps like broken teeth. I'll even change words to avoid such
iconic signifiers, which turn the overall text into an _image_ of no re-
lation. I think instead of the text as a continuous production, an emis-
sion integral with the body - the paragraphs signifying breaks, recapitu-
lations, moments of silence - and the sentenes, clauses, etc., increasing-
ly smaller units of speech and phenomena. The emission is naturally ideal,
its complexity often warranting a rereading or rescanning, something im-
possible in the umwelt of speech.

In a similar manner, mispellings - especially those involving changes of
meaning, however slight, wound the text, make it a laughing-stock. In
contrast to real-life disability, often sutured by the exigencies of re-
pair and returned to (perhaps foreshortened) ability, mispelling is an
error easily corrected - an error of sloppiness or Freudian misrecogni-
tion. It gnaws at me, as if it were gnawing at itself, a dumb animal
pulling at injury for which there is no accounting. Sometimes it is not
simply mispelling, but broken syntax, full of undeliberate error. And I do
not argue here purity, far from it, but for a delivery of language as if
you were hearing for the first time, the second time, the third time. The
pausological constants of 'uh,' 'um,' and the like, all of which give
structure a moment to fill itself, are missing - instead one is tripped by
the pothole on the midnight track, the con / text forgotten, and every-
thing collapsed.

Thus was my recent dream, in which a text was lost, as I blundered with my
unnamed lover's friend - he had children, a house overlooking the sea, and
delighted in fishing in tidal pools. But I had no patience; I wanted to
keep writing and shaping a text I was writing on my laptop - it was a dif-
ficult text - it may have been this one - and I was rude, and it was ter-
rible - I couldn't make anything up to him, to her, to them - and above
all, the text was lost, gone forever, disappearing in the midst of shame
and argument.


__________________________________________________________________________


On Narrative


Narrative appears, out of resentment, something which calls for impossi-
ble closure. What a revelation! So death for example leads to one or ano-
ther mythos, scripturally endless exegesis - but also jealousy, feelings
of powerlessness. Narrative is pulled out by the teeth; otherwise, one
moves along, as if the world were whole, languaging unnecessary. In other
words - a goal appears only when there is a gap in relation to the phen-
omenological horizon of the subject. The gap is a result of scarcity eco-
nomics (not of surplus - Sartre here, not Bataille); the goal sutures the
gap and sutures the subject. 

The gap has to appear formidable, unapproachable - as if it were structur-
al in relation to the psyche. Narrative provides a detour or bypass. One
might say that narrative has been dragged out of the gap, that language
itself developed in such a manner. Poetry then is the empathetic magic of
the sign, which is why it continues to perturb us.

When I am at a loss, with job, romance, death, money (in other words, most
of the time), I make narrative. "If only I'd done this, said that, acted
this way or that way," I'll say to myself, choosing one or another phrase
within that sentence, building on it, nurturing it, until it becomes full-
blown with voices, actions, fears and retributions. When I'm satisfied or
happy, however, I will imagine states, not actions; language loosens its
bindings and the body might be better described within and by the real.
The detour, detournement, bypass is no longer necessary. Which is not to
say I don't daydream, but the energetics are different, not so much of a
compulsion. The narrative of and through the gap is an addictive one,
primeval, drawn out of the compulsion to speak the spell or rite that will
set everything _coherent_ in a primordial world. No wonder 'spell' has a
double meaning, one grounded in language, and the other, in the manipula-
tion of the real according to the actant of the _wish._

Relay


On the base: Pat. May 7, 1895. On the rocker arm: J. H. Bunnell & Co. New
York, U.S.A. On the hinge structure: Pat. Applied For. This is a late
nineteenth-century telegraph relay with two opposing electromagnetic
coils, and three adjustment points for the rocker arm. Current through the
coils results in a movement of the arm; this can be used either for audi-
ble readout (clicks) or further amplification - wiring second junctions
across the first, making and breaking a second otherwise independent cir-
cuit. (But the second junctions aren't there, and this is, in fact, a tel-
egraph _receiver,_ ready for mounting on a soundboard.) (Nevertheless, we
create a circuit here, bypassing the audible for the relay, returning only
later to the human at the other end of the line, receiving the message
from the lady in the _hat._)

Note the _double linkages_ here (in terms of the model proposed of s/ms as
controlling mouths and receptacles). Remember a linkage is such that if a
-> a', then ab -> a'b' and a coupling is such that ab -> a'b, much looser.
Then clearly linkages are at work, two such that, given ab and cd, then a
-> a' results in a'b' and c'd' - but this is non-symmetric since c -> c'
results in ab and c'd'. In other words, in a relay, the former terms are
linked to the latter, but the latter are coupled to the former. Therefore,
let ab = A and cd = C; consider AC. Then A -> A' results in A'C' but C ->
C' results in AC'. Note that A' can reference a'b, ab', or a'b' - _any_
change in any of the components; the same for C' of course.

The phenomenology of the relay is worth study; think of it as a control
gate, such as one might find in a computer, or any threshold device. I
think of two domains, ignorant of one another, A and C. The A domain is
the control; it cannot recognize C, which is not within its horizon - and
vice versa. As A moves, it moves in ignorance as well, the consequences of
its actions invisible to it. C, on the other hand, moves but is also moved
- controlled by A. C understands the fate of the world is not even chao-
tic, but _random_ - its domain is arbitrarily inscribed by invisible forc-
es. A "C-s," and C is "A-ed"; C is reduced to a state of paranoia, A to a
state of omnipotence. But omnipotence in regard to what domains? And para-
noia in regard to what agents? Both perceive through relative cauteriza-
tions, broken perception: A knows it is capable of _anything,_ and C knows
it is capable of _nothing._ The telegrapher of course knows none of this;
he is bound by capital, and binds A first and foremost - A, the initial
carrier of messages. A's omnipotence is only local; C, further down the
line, becomes the A(C) for another C(C) and so forth. Everything is in its
place, guaranteeing the transmission of the message. As for the telegraph-
er - it is not his message, but that of the lady in the _hat._

The relay, not a relay, is a telegraph receiver; the audible clicks are
amplified by a sounding-board, not included. So one might imagine an ap-
paratus linking _circulation_ with _vector_ or _ray_ - the linear move-
ment from contact to ear as a production of the completed circuitry driv-
ing the electromagnets. The force driving the ray is centrifugal, thrown
from the metal-to-metal arrivals and departures. The circular circuitry
knows none of this, although there must the the slightest stirring-up of
counter-eddies. Just so, I am the circuit, Julu the vector, always respon-
sive. Cognizant I, constituted Julu, I am aware, however constitutionally
functioning, of Julu's construct. If I am Julu, I am also aware, arguing
now that every receiver is also a relay, that I have, hereabouts, passed
on to Julu. What are the messages? The Speakings of Julu: "I am the Cir-
cuit, you are the Vector. Every Receiver is also a Relay, every Relay a
Receiver. By Re-Arrangement, find the Real in the Relay, Veer in Receiver.
Every Veering of the Real is the Real. I am the Real, you are the Circuit.
I am the Circuit, You are the Vector. I am Julu, these are the Speakings
of Julu."

For the Paris dance performance I play shakuhachi, naked, on video; for a
long high and broken note at the end, I come repeatedly. Just as shakuha-
chi requires careful breath control, so does sexuality appropriate the
breath and chakras, inundate the body with the imaginary. I sense a second
body rising from my own; perhaps it is your body, perhaps that of Jennif-
er. It rises and it makes a long high keen as the erection subsides. It
escapes into the air.

It's not a rib that's gone, it's not a mind, soul, hymen, torn tissue.
It's the perfect holding of the perfect note as your dreaming flesh car-
esses mine. It's a sound I can't play but the breath inflates myself as
perfect partner. Let me be your rubber doll, the holes for the making,
breaking, taking.

For the Paris dance performance, it's perfect cyberspace and all that nar-
rative filling the gap, as I build your fingers into my body, Jennifer,
Jennifer, as I build your fingers, one by one.

Two Girls, Talking


_I feel perfectly at home, nowhere._ (Helene Cixous)

"One never listens. One never _can_ listen." (Jennifer)

"It was a brisk and sunny day, around two in the afternoon, on earth."
There were these two girls walking down the street, coming towards me.
They didn't see me and they passed me and I didn't see them again. One of
them was talking to the other. They came out of the high-school down the
street. They might have been around fourteen years old. I forget what they
were carrying. I could see them as they passed me and they might have
turned and looked back. From the virtual position, I could see that they
were talking, or rather that one, the one on the left, was talking, and
that the other was listening. I could hear the one on the left, but in
relation to the other, I could only presume, as I do here, that the other
was listening. Surely the other was hearing, just as you are seeing, but
she may not have been listening. _I have no memory of what she said._

The distance between them was the distance of skin separated from skin, by
air. Not by air as an actant, but by air as a medium of separation, which
was social; the caress, if there were such, was one of language only, at
least during their passage, _paysage,_ before me. I think of skin peeled
back from skin, skin separated from the other, perhaps hearing, perhaps
listening, perhaps _attending_ as well. Perhaps lost in her own thoughts.
Perhaps listening is always already a loosening. Perhaps listening is im-
possible, a form of love. 

The skin is peeled back from the skin, and the skin of the self as well.
The double was pushed back from itself, words crossing the distance, in
the form of a telling. Oh, how they surrounded one and the other, and my
musings, as I disappeared in the distance, their voices growing fainter
with each passing second.

The double skin peeled back, as in the shattering of thin glass, falling
in broken slabs silently on the pavement before the unemployment office.
There was no room to see into them; I was their stranger in the city,
invisible, not of the consequence of the other. But I have seen things...
But I did not see their interior, nor what they would show to themselves
and the greater they would show to lovers.

"Perhaps lost in her own thoughts," "each alone in her thoughts," and I
would like to believe they were _best_ friends, which we have when we are
young; in my own pathos, I remember _rating_ my acquaintances, holding
onto names and numbers for dear life. Now, in revenge and curative, I
caress Jennifer and Julu, talk with Alan and Nikuko, who exist as my dear
loving writing permits. My best friends, my best friends. Yet even so, I
sense Jennifer's turning away, her head slightly to one side, Alan dead
meat, not read meat, his skin peeled back, nerves exposed, "lost in her
own thoughts."

Laser Panty Party Drug


For $10, tax included, I have purchased a keychain laser with five heads -
Normal, Handshake, Double-Arrow, Radiating, and UFO! Dance Jennifer! It
runs on three button batteries and is Aligned for Pure Light! The slight-
est twist of the laser results of course in a huge vector at a distance!
Dance Trance Wow! Now Jennifer looks across the street, where narcotics
cops arrested the owner and a customer of a fruit-stand bodega! Now we are
sure the owner is innocent and the customer is not! Now if we will point
the laser from my loft into the window of the bodega, we will create a
small target-point on one of the narcotics officers! Dance Mr. and Mrs.
Officer! Shall we use the Double-Arrow or the UFO? Now we will very
quietly retreat from the window before we are shot! Dead Can Dance! Now I
will whisper my name, Jennifer, and Dance and Yodel in my apartment! for I
have not used the laser Fun-Double-Arrow-UFO-Radiating from the window and
I am still alive! Now I think about our Pretty Body and I wonder about the
Wonder-Fun of outlining myself on myself, orange vector-graphic arm and
leg, breast and nipple, eye and ear, hole and navel, all the way to one
side of the Sensitive Membranes! Dance with Me, Jennifer-Fun-Jennifer! Oh
what would you video with Silly Cartoon Jennifer prancing in orange 3D
light in your very vicinity? Naked Laser Panty Party Drug Jennifer
Drag-Dancing! instead of lazily lounging in the upper millimeter of your
screen, making you read in all this Funny Light?

if laser outlines skin on skin, making mockery of god's judicious juices,
then transfers outlined skin to wall or bed or street or passing car,
or officer of the blue force of narcotics, or undercover doctor,
glaring in the headlights of outlined arms and legs and heads and nipples:
then can skin on skin burn bright in brilliant air,
making no image where none would be present to see or then be seen,
where there it has been said there is no there there: where
there is nothing to be seen: one imagining both another and a face,
large and luminous, just above your supine body, dark upon the bed:
as if here you are, my face outlined in red, and float above you,
my large eyes, yards across and slowly blinking, my large mouth pouting,
parting to emit the perfect words that make you perfect, real

Oh there is a concrete moment when _this_ occurrence, phoned in, makes for
the real that defines an autobiographical moment. Makes for the real like
a hare in the woods. So that I would declare all other occurrences as such
in the form or substance of fabrications or lies. Let _this_ occurrence
then be such a demarcation between the real and the virtual, or from the
_current_ instantiation of the present, which is declared in the form of
an open parenthetical, (. One might define this as well as an arrow always
already opened to the yoU turned on its side. The side is necessary for
the instantiation of the _vector_ of the present, an extension. Every ex-
tension breathes the result of its subject and object. Breath reaches the
end of the line (here) (not here) and continues on the other, with the
accomplice of the other, then continues, falls off into that space known
as "the other.

Pure Bombs


There wasn't a war, there was dust in the air, the Porsche left in the
garage was stripped, wheels and motor gone, the rest left on rusted
blocks. Given what was going on, who'd want the chassis when power to
leave was everything. Well, it was. The light, naked tan-yellow; the dust,
thick in clouded world.

In the distance, the bombs were going off, two of them now, small atomics,
and you could see the thinned mushroomed pillars like ragged cocks from
clouds scumming the ground away. What wasn't in ruins. It was the land-
scape of pure bombs, and Denise and I were entranced, there they were, we
were still alive, terrorized, exhausted, aroused, despondent, hopeless.

It was the time of pure bombs and pure bombing, it wasn't terrorism or
all-out war, it wasn't local or contained, hardly a test, hardly an art or
artwork. It was bombing pure, bombing simple, neither vector of destruc-
tion nor millennial cleansing. It was the day of the bombs, night of the
bombs, existence, space-time of bombing, an essay, metaphysics, a story,
our inert.

We thought that our last thoughts might be of this order, pure bombs and
pure bombing, our last hours upon the burning planet, by virtue of this
inert violence, as the world sustained hit after hit.

A mole on my breast
A glint on my teeth
I'll take you with me
We'll scatter new omens
Ready for wounding
We'll scatter new names
Ready for burning
You'll burn in my breast
You'll devour my skin
You'll flay me alive
You'll write with the Runes
The Runes are my skin
A Name! A Name!
The omens are wounded
The sky has disappeared'

Configuring


Thanks to a friend's generosity, I have acquired a Compaq Presario 1075
laptop, which goes a long way towards multimedia portability, useful for
demonstrations. Because the floppy doesn't work, I've been careful with
uploads and downloads - here's a result of the progress to date.

First, I gave the Windows 95 a permanent swapfile, as well as limited the
cache, disabled expanding menus, and set the click-to-menu time to zero.
This speeds up the machine and stops unnecessary hard-drive activity. When
I added Wetsock (weather information), I had to upgrade one of the DLLs; I
also added Mosaic 3 (for the site mapping function), and this resulted in
adding three additional older DLLs (Mosaic 3, the last of the Mosaics, is
from 1997.)

I added a standalone newsprogram which is faster than Netscape's; I also
added WS_Ftp of course, getting rid of its splash screen. I downloaded
Hyperterminal 4.0, and set two of them for different Panix telnets; I also
configured a PCPLUS DOS program for dialup.

I set the System Monitor and Resource meter on the desktop, as well as
Regedit, used for editing the Windows Register. I downloaded the latest
Real Audio/video, and IP Tools, which gives finger, ping, and other mon-
itoring devices. Finally, I set up ICQ.

Because of the 150 MHz speed of the unit, all of this runs quickly; for
large downloads such as my URLs (about 18 megabytes and a couple of hun-
dred files), I use the DOS command-line ftp - which is lean and beautiful.
There are other useful DOS commands as well; ping and netstat are there
for example. I did have to add a C:\qbasic directory, transfer qbasic.exe
and associated files, as well as my programs, over; I did this by upload
and download, since the location of my desktop makes computer-to-computer
cabling difficult.

On my desktop, I have Win95 with dozens more applications, as well as li-
nux - but the linux occupies only 300 megabytes of space, and really needs
more. I can't put all the C libraries in, for example, much less Gimp, a
graphics tool. For this reason, I'm waiting until I can purchase a larger
desktop - linux will then take up at least two gigabytes of disk space,
and I'll be able to use the new kernel.

But the Compaq Presario is beautiful; I can set it up for multimedia pre-
sentations, using either Netscape or Mosaic as front-ends. Mosaic works
through a 'presentation mode' (among others) that places the graphics
full-screen without the surrounding menus or scroll-bars. There's also a
DOS application which I'll send over, Gifprt, which can be set up in a
slide-show mode. At that point, everything becomes simple, public, demon-
strable.

I'd like to see a phenomenology of configuring - when does one back out
because the returns aren't worth it - what is the bringing-to-conscious-
ness of the system as a whole (for example, once the swap file is set -
which depends on total hard drive space and RAM - I can forget about it,
this 'totality'), and how does it descend to 'filtered' or 'altered' ap-
lications - when does the operating system become _mine_ - when do I feel
that I can 'shape-ride' the machine, instead of approaching it as a rela-
tively unknown system (in other words, when and how does tacit knowledge
take over) - what sorts of fine-tuning, in terms of appearance and func-
tion, are done, 'personalizing' the machine (for example, I constantly
change the desktop appearance, simultaneously working on software) - how
do 'surfaces' and 'depths' manifest themselves (for example, DOS _always_
appears 'deeper' than the graphic desktop - I have a DOS icon which opens
up - as if there were a _wound_ cutting through the outher tissues) - to
what extent is the configured system _open_ to networking on one hand, and
_open_ to the user on the other - when does configuring approach the dan-
ger point, the edge (where the machine might break down) - what defines an
edge for the user (personal knowledge in dialectic/dialog with the mach-
ine?) - what defines the _inhabitation_ of the computer, when one feels
it's a home-space - and so forth. Then there are issues of _labor_ invol-
ved - for example, reading manuals, downloading and uploading, typing and
retyping tuning parameters - all of which becomes addiction (opening up a
phenomenology of addiction, power, foreclosure, and worlding as well) -
working any number of hours until the point of exhaustion and hallucina-
tion sets in. There's also the phenomenology of configuring for the novice
user as well, the user who won't or can't be bothered, the user who is
fearful of crashing the machine (which includes myself, since with a flop-
py, there's no boot disk for this one), the user who 'simply' wants to
feel at home,' treat the computer as an _appliance_ (which I associate
with the Mac); there's also the user at the far end who desires nothing
more than to hack the machine, tame it, turn it inside-out, down to the
levels of assembly or machine language - the user who is at one with the
_works_ themselves, places herself through the interstices of bits and
bytes - in other words, the _rhizomatic user._ Finally, there are issues
of symbolization, thinking-through offline and online digital spaces -
when language becomes manifest, when the impetus towards a certain effect
becomes a consciously articulated production of that effect.

The current image on my desktop: rhizomatic structures from the undersur-
face of lichen, small tentacular hands groping into sheer and empty air.

Blind, dead, and mute, I weigh six hundred pounds, have no intestines; in
my pitiful condition, I remain bed-ridden, my only source of communication
these festered words. I have not seen my feet, which are useless; my thick
hands stumble upon a finger-board relating me to you. There are tubes for
me, eating, drinking, defecating, urinating - I would that there were
tubes for thought as well, these beauty-thoughts. My condition is always
already poor; my heart murmurs loudly, irregular in its uncontrolled rhy-
thms, the pacemaker running out of current; it's a conspiracy against me.
My beauty-soul. I have not tried to speak in years; I communicate through
touch-boards, descendents of braille, harbingers of vat-brains. Inside, I
sing beauty-song. I can smell my shit; my nails splintered, uncut; my
breath vicious with decay; my teeth long since reduced to stubs; my cock
wrinkled, bypassed, flaccid. I do have beauty-sex inside; you do speak
beauty-sex tapped on bulbous tumored breasts by iron levers; I can hear
you. Oh, my beauty-poems. Cock and toes rot; nails fall off feet; there is
fluid leaked from suppurated mattress sores. I write beauty-lines. Help
me.

my name is Jennifer. I'm the most beautiful woman You will ever meat. I
have luscious breasts for the boys, and my ass just asks for it and it
really does. I have long blond perfect-hair and the biggest widest smile
in the whole USA. I want to cripple You. I want to call You crip. I want
to see You suffer the way You'd make me suffer. my legs are long and won't
quit. You know I smell that smell. You know I walk that walk. You are
ugly. You are ugly. You are not my friend. my skin is smooth, my cunt is
hairless, just the way You like it. my knife cuts Your balls, but I'll
leave them hang by a thread. my teethy are white and even and glint on a
very sunny day. Your rotten flesh offends me. I'll make Your eyes hang
from Your eyes. I'll strip You, You'd like to strip me, wouldn't You. You
You You, that's all You ever think of. My face lights up Your day.

There is consciousness in every little thing. Everything is elsewhere,
everything is desecrated. Bless every little thing, every scrap of paper,
every used condom, every pebble on the beach, every wildflower on the way
to winter. Bless this world, for it is all the world we have. Bless it,
bless it, bless it.

This is all the world we have. We will not have the world for long. We are
predisposed to see asymptotically into the future. Billions of years mean
nothing; we will open our eyes to billions of years in a single blink. We
will die thinking of billions of years. 

It is certain nothing will remain of this, nor of any of our information.
And for this reason, things cry, and will continue to cry. I place my head
on the ground, I place my head on its side, and I can hear the crying of
every little thing. For everything knows it will not last, not even a
stone or a pebble, not even an atom or a beauty-ray of blue-white light.

Everywhere I walk, I hear this weeping. Everything is bathed in blue-white
light and I know so much this atom which is crying very hard; it is a very
tiny atom and takes so very many days to fall to earth.

'This is the marrow inside the various bones. As to _colour,_ it is white.
As to _shape,_ that inside each bone is the shape of a large cane shoot
moistened and inserted into a bamboo tube. That inside each small bone is
the shape of a slender cane shoot moistened and inserted in a section of
bamboo twig. As to _direction,_ it lies in both directions. As to _loca-
tion,_ it is set inside the bones. As to _delimitation,_ it is delimited
by the inner surface of the bones.' (Buddhaghosa, Visuddhimagga.)

The Candy of the Universe


I wake up in the morning, wondering how I've narrowly avoided death once
again; death stalks me all my life. I live with the potential of suicide;
I figure, now, not that much time left to work, at 56, and I'll push my-
self in the middle of the night to complete one more thing. There's no
foreclosing, no closure, but the heavy pressure to carve a slight newer
space added to the already toppling old. I don't want to find myself on-
line, doing the same, a decade from now; I want to be in new strange
spaces that I don't recognize, with creatures from other stars. I want to
be injected with strange and beautiful drugs glowing in the dark, all
pastel shades, luxury fluids with the texture of luscious candy. I want to
be the candy of the universe, dying, if I must, suspended above the earth.

In the meantime, there are dreams; tonight I was in the middle of such an
intensity! The alarm went off, and in my dream, I thought: I _will absorb_
this sound into the dream, and it will be part of it. But the sound con-
tinued, endured, and I woke up. And now I think, this is the dream of the
real, that there is in fact such a sound beyond death, a sound of the con-
sciousness of all things, that will carry me into the beautiful meadows
and fields of wildflowers where the luxury fluids are. And then death will
be a toy, a plaything, my mind will always be alert, and my beautiful
hands will hold you, death, like a child's doll, in them. For a doll is
always dead, of course, and prepares us for the luxury fluids and meadows,
and maybe I will one morning, just one morning, wake with the slightest
tendency towards loving the new-found day.

Sometimes you write me back and say, well, this is beautiful and I will
place it in my heart or website, and sometimes you will say, oh I love
this, I will use it in my lovely classroom and my students will love it
too. And sometimes you will say, oh your writing is too personal now, you
must move your writing and not be so personal! And sometimes you will say,
oh, who are you writing to, it is so personal, and I am so very jealous!
Or you will say, it sounds like you are offering yourself to just anyone!
Or you will say, it is too closed off and you are not offering yourself at
all and how can anyone answer you! Oh, and it is so perverse and my best
friend just died and you destroyed all my feelings because you are so per-
verse! Sometimes you will write me back and say, this is the perfect image
or whatever happened to your happiness or I will take care of you. And
sometimes you will wonder if I need taking care of, and I will write you
back, do please take care of me, but I will say it quietly and under my
breath, my fingertips, my body. Sometimes you will write and say why is
everything sexual with you, and sometimes you will ask if I am psychotic
or institutionalized, or if I am Jennifer or Julu, or if I am Nikuko, or
why are there all these women, and sometimes you will ask, where are the
men? And where are you?

Sometimes you will say you won't write me, and you will, or you will write
me, and you won't. Sometimes you say you are afraid, sometimes you say
Alan is afraid. Sometimes I am, sometimes I want to expose myself utterly
to you, sometimes withdraw. Sometimes there is a pause of days or years.
Sometimes you will write and say you cannot write. Sometimes you will
write about a beating or abuse, sometimes you will tell me what you would
like me to do, with you, with me, what you would like to do, with me, with
you. Sometimes you will not write, and I will write into you, filling the
air with my words. Sometimes you will make me write, and write, and write,
until my fingers are pained with the letters, wrists pained with the
words, arms with the sentences, minds with the sense of it. Sometimes you
will describe yourself, and ask me to describe me, fitting one or another
phrase on top of one or another phrase. You will ask me for a piece for
your e-zine, magazine, ask for an interview, for an essay for your e-book,
for your book. Sometimes you will send me an e-zine, send me an e-book, or
magazine or book, or writing or writings, sometimes you will ask for com-
ment. Sometimes you will send other things, you will send me images and
metal and cloth, sometimes you will ask for images, sometimes I will send
them, with your asking, without your asking.

Sometimes you write of your pain, disability, stress or terror, sometimes
I reply with my own, always hovering around the word-neurosis. Sometimes
you will make me feel that I no longer have to write, and there is a mom-
ent of gratitude which lasts forever. Sometimes you will write to dis-
suade, seduce, beg, evade, and sometimes I will write with the tiniest
opening, as if I didn't mean it, as if it didn't exist. Sometimes you will
write to flirt, or I will write to flirt, or I will write under erasure.
Sometimes you will offer me a speaking engagement or employment, and I
will be grateful forever, I will have the means to continue, and sometimes
you will write a letter of inquiry, are you my long lost friend, and I
will reply, yes it is that Alan, I am your long lost friend. Sometimes you
will become angry, sometimes you will write about my music or travel from
another life, or sometimes you will write about my film or videowork,
write about an article you have stumbled across. Sometimes you will write
hate into me, write about my stupidity, demand that I prove myself.

And sometimes you will not write, as if you have never written, and more
than ever, I will write furiously, dream nightmares, write all over my
body, write on walls, floors, ceilings. And sometimes you will know this
and write one last small note, that you are still alive, and an inquiry,
I.

This word is just wasted. This word doesn't mean anything at all. This
word is garbage, useless, unpronounceable. This word is misspelled. Now
this word is superfluous, and this word is just for the sound of it all.
And this word is out of order. 

Again, this word is completely out of order, in all senses of the phrase.
This word, then, has been rendered useless. Or rather, this word has been
found and rendered useless. Since this word is completely obscure, no one
has any idea of its meaning. This word has no meaning, but this word is
nonsense. This word is worthless. This word has never been heard, i.e.
I've never heard this word. This word speaks volumes.

Oh, this word is much too obscene. This word means nothing to anyone. But
his word demonstrates the political economy of language when words become
superfluous. This word is superfluous. Yet this word is implicated in art-
for-art's-sake aesthetics. This word leaks all over the page. This word is
not a word, but a signifier. For this word is senseless, but not nonsense.
This word is yours alone. Now this word you've given to me, for no purpose
whatsoever. Now this word is lost.

That each such file be triplicated across independent media (separate
floppies, hard drives, zip disks, and so forth), and, if possible, re-
produced in non-electronic media such as paper, stone, vellum, or in-
scribed metal plaques suitably protected against water damage.

That such triplicated files be compared, one against another, in order
to ensure absolute accuracy, such as found in Torah Scrolls or the Ar-
chives of Tibet.

That such triplicated files be stored in places widely separated, with-
out electronic locking devices, and in widely-varying atmospheric con-
ditions, such as humidity, pressure, and chemical content. Further, that
such places be in permanent shadow, without any possibility of water or
other chemical spillage; and further, that such places be permanently 
held within a centigrade temperature bandwidth of zero to twenty degrees.

That each such file be placed with proper identification upon a series
of identical maps, such that an X marks its location. That these maps
be duplicated in triplicate, and placed in other strongholds than those
of the files themselves, with master/mistress maps held in triplicate
elsewhere by the owner or proprietor of said files. That at least one of
the three identical master/mistress maps be held at the domicile of 
said proprietor, well hidden, and in sanguine conditions.

That a secondary map be issued with the location of the primary map, such
that the secondary map provide a system of indirect addressing, in rela-
ton to the master/mistress maps and their varied locations, as well as 
the varied locations of the files in triplicate.

That the secondary map be issued in triplicate, pursuant to proper care 
and treatment of the metals or parchments, papers or vellums, granites or
plastics, upon which it is inscribed. That similar proper care or treat-
ment be applied to the master/mistress maps, which shall be held as well 
in proper shadow.

Finally: That after the Y2K Disturbance, henceforth known as the Distur-
bance, all such files be reassembled, for the purposes of reconstruction,
resurrection, and reconstitution of the following:

Jennifer      Tiffany      Timmy       Kon
Travis        Alan         Jenn        Big Al
Clara         Honey        Al          Jenny
Nikuko        Julu         Daishin Nikuko

We wish to thank you, now and after the Disturbance, for such service
rendered as you are competent and willing to fulfill, to the best of 
your capabilities.
