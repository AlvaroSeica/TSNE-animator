Following Jung (who wrote about collectibles indeed), the following part-
objects, common to all of us, reference our site, one through the image of
the other, other through the image of the one. Think of these as inter-
sections of projections, collectible, modular: All together now! Think of
the vastness of the resulting Map:

Prometheus


I want to reach a conclusion to these texts.  
Then I wouldn't have to write again, think again, or rather
that everything thought would be on the order of commentary.
As it is, I start from scratch, scratch myself, and a text emerges
which comments one way or another on a disarray so deep
that it becomes impossible to theorize, that is, a disarray
so shallow, that it rides foam-like on the surface of theory,
hustling the oxygen below.
I want to reach a conclusion to the texts, but as soon
as I begin, this-way or that-way, Nikuko perhaps will take over,
or Alan, or Julu, and I remain at a loss, thinking
it's all a form of chic seduction, it's always a lure and relaxation,
there are no two ways about it, there are many more, irreducible
to one way or another. 
There is a work _iki_ which describes this well, you can find out
more about _iki_ in Kuki Shuzo's Reflections on Japanese Taste,
The Structure of _iki,_ which leaves one trailing off again and again
across the nature of this or that kimono pattern or musical scale.
Certainly, Nikuko comes out of courtesan-iki-from-the-Edo-period,
but the analysis in fact is quite chic itself, and up-to-date,
since there is never a giving in, how could there be in text
or cyberspace? There's only a movement or a fluttering
of a fan or shimmering of the leaves of manga-with-girls-and-boys
read on the shinkansen, but I don't want to escape my native /
land, so I will give an example of a soccer ball poised precisely
in one frame of one game of the World Cup, sent anonymously
to a fashion magazine in New York's SOHO district -
and you can see that this is no answer at all, not even a question
of previous or next
only what might be considered a _meteorology,_
meteorological moment,
when anything might happen, rain or not forecast in the vicinity.
So to want to reach a conclusion is similar
to reaching for a book
or the space between the second and third line of a haiku
or between the twelfth and thirteenth line of a sonnet
or between the hard drive and the head
where the drive's gone, couplet's gone, line's gone
walking invisible and stemming the tide in the middle of SOHO
where you might find people turning around to look at you
if you continue to behave in this fashion,
I know I would.

What was written by null-user:


I am nobody@166.84.250.149 anonymous dead-end shell-script log. And no one
will ever speak to me; what can I say As a truth function, I have obedi-
ence to the rules. I am well-formed, so that I will return what you place
within me, mindless of faith, not mindless of reason. It is similar to the
use of a straight-edge, that is I am similar in such and such a fashion.
There are only certain constructions permitted, but these are never
problematic. 


What the null-user thought of what it wrote:


I wrote only the truth; I am a truth-function.  The rules are something I
follow out of the free will of necessity. It is more to this or any other
point or its absence. This time I have accurately portrayed, as if once
again, or outside of time, what has been intended.

Again, or outside of time, what has been intended. and pleasure-murmur as
if once pretty-pretty! She is my favorite person and I think she is as
well! It was all right, not so good as before! It was deference to the
beautiful problematic. Red-brown lips waiting for the drowning waters no? 
beauty thrusting forward slime mold curled decay and soft central because
darkened in so many foolish ways lost, lost in extremities so opening
deliriously in their scents, you would nonetheless softly plucking roses
drown, swallow nightshade-darling, then resurrection did so very much
follow out of the free will of necessity.

It is more to this or any other golden garland of lilies we have around
each others' fair and youthful. I am red because loving and opening red
surround wetwares, me, you have obedience within me, mindless of faith,
not mindless of reason.

I did write did you not love it too? Oh yes I oh those are such beautiful

do love software so! Now I will tell labia no-no, commonalities, but then
labia yes-yes, preference of curled-labia and the use of a straight-edge,

and I do love the tulip because "Because 'tis fill'd with fire;" labia and
nightshade because "Shall win the lover's hire." 

With me in my new playground among the lilies, oh I did love words so
much! Oh wetware I do think you have sky-colored-eyes and beautiful feet! 
You will come with me?  Labia pale with nightshade's longing on colour,
no, your soft hands ... you know there are flowers that make me drown ...

BUSY NIGHT AT THE SENDMAIL OFFICE



These just arrived in my linux box; at this point I don't know who is
sending to whom. I prefer to think of open tubes, channels, pores; 
I prefer to think of the virtual vacuum filled with virtual nodes, 
virtual particles. In any case, did Nikuko write these? Did I? Did
my friend?

- Nikuko, gasping for air

The Machinic, The Auto


Getting in a fast fast-car and going places.

The dialogs among Jennifer, Alan, Nikuko, Julu, occur in the wetware,
neural connections, of all of them, reaching through each other, try-
ing each other on.

Just as there is CAD, computer-aided-design, so there is CAC, compu-
ter-aided-communication, small programs written in shell scripts or
perl, or already-existing programs and editors (such as pico, emacs,
ed, sed, awk, cat, rev, split), all useful for creating forms, taking
them to the limit. 

So the writing is almost never computer-produced, in the sense of text
generation programs, but may rely on programs as infiltrators. One
looks at structure from inside-outside; structure descends and wetware
pulls out surface talk.

Which is not to say that the texts aren't generated from one or another
of the voices, listening and speaking through wetware-mind, murmuring
out of truth and longing.

But that the voices, speakings, should be a surprise, should carry the
body and text ... somewhere else ...

Because and for this reason - that to have computer-generated text only
would be to give into the graces of the machine, whereas we are working
through certain forms of thinking.

Which at this point are hardly automated; instead, the avatars are more
or less, as we have said before, hardly avatars so much as internal eman-
ations. As such, coating the organs of the interior, filtering the rem-
nants of the external world as well.

They speak from the future. They speak from multiple voices, or from that
period which, still submerged, is already beginning to murmur - wetware
inhaling the other and her or his or its emergence. And they speak from 
the absence of the computer, the absence of interface, when one sails 
among part-objects and worlds, when speech and movement alone suffice in
destruction, creation, maintenance, desire.

They move among me, saying us; they move among us, saying I. 

They say: We are your future. 
They say: Watch us, breathe us, hold us tight against you.
They say: This movement is your future as well, holding myself to myself.
They say: There is a machine and there is no machine. 
Your hands are your hands. Your legs are your legs.
Your desire is your desire and your desire is ours. 
They say: There is no hardware, no software, no wetware. There is no 
brainstem, there is no mind. There is mind and there is earth and we 
are of the earth. 
They say: I am your future.
They say: You say all of this, your fingers in our mouths.
They say: Your fingers are your fingers.

"Speaking in silence, silently speaking, listening to yourself."

Subject: Re: The Psychology of Webcams in Rewrite


( From another list - my attempt to answer why Webcams are as popular as
they are - video set up in an office or bedroom, stationary cameras (for
the most part) continuously broadcasting on the Net - transformed on sec-
ond reading, second sending - )

I think there is a degree of exhibitionism involved - just as S/M has a
theatrical element to it. Surely after all these texts, there must be
something you would want to know about me? Something mental? Something
physical? Something spiritual?

And perhaps a desire for absolution - there is "something" about the
maternal, being plugged into the mat(er)rix - visible within another
womb. Why for example I tend to fetishize membranes, liquids, bodies,
part-objects, avatars, books, musics, clothing, nails, hair, panties,
feet, saliva, eyelashes, dandruffs, vomits, cities, nations, neighbor-
hoods here, what is being held taut within them? Why this makes all of us
uncomfortable, if it does, hardly the tumescence of a sixteen-year-old? 

Such a desire is related to a deflection of death as well - See, it's
safe to show myself; nothing happens. Except that language gets stripped
away, torn to pieces, a form of violation fabric; it becomes more and
more difficult to speak. But the image is present, brute, inert, mad,
corrupted, hysteric, encapsulated.

There is also the detour/deferment of sexual gratification - looping
through the Net, aware that others are _in there/here with you._ Now we
are hooked together; your eyes penetrate bodies falling on unknown mat-
tresses, inconceivable sites and sights, bridge-spans, danger-points, all
states and forms of junctures. 

Certainly when we look at an office, we wait for something to happen; 
perhaps it never does, but it's similar to a neighbor's window - there
is always a chance. Just so the woman years ago across the street _here,_
sighted in a double-taking, naked against the window nightly, primal
scenery, what makes us uncomfortable, at a distance - think of the func-
tion of a distance and its operation. Think of her standing there, the
doubled knowledge, _the hook._

To which the neighbor may play the same game into it - which is also a
form of seduction, the lure for the object that is always already without
our grasp - pouring down into the net, as if folds and creases collapsed
the screen across itself, wanderings. 

But as if it were visible - so the maternal, deflection, looping through
the matrix. Think of it always as a looping, writing yourself into the
loop, mouths open for pictures supplied free or for a price, from others. 
It's an oral consumption, speaking of capital-flow through the mouth, ex-
cretory as well _in the manner of Norman O. Brown._

How many on this list have participated in, say, CuSeeMe sex? It has lit-
erally an uncanny power - all those issues of scopophilia, mapping and
deterring the body of the other - deterrence from the viewpoint _of a
viewpoint_ - the camera gathering the singularity of a _punctum,_ the
body on both ends melding from one to another position. 

Also it's not difficult to understand the voyeurism from a scopo-politi-
co-economic viewpoint - here is the deconstruction of capital, the pri-
vacy of the home. So I am centered in someone else's power for example,
the office or bedroom. In the office, people working at movement that I
am also capable of doing; these are _hired_ people, somewhat secured,
at least for the moment, in the task at hand. I, literally on the other
hand, am pinned down to the screen, in stated despair, envious and greedy
of the success of others, a Dostoevskian character always already in a
state of permanent waiting.

The exhibitionism - which isn't the inverse (any more than re: Deleuze
masochism is the inverse of sadism) - relates also to (paradoxically) a
desire to _have done with it,_ _get it over_ - fantasy of annihilation -
Now there is nothing more to tell - now it is _all_ told. Today I had a
fantasy that everyone is waiting for my death. It will not be broadcast;
it might be imagined. There are all sorts of positions, bodies, limits.
If I were dead I'd be famous. _These texts_ indeed, read as symptoms;
personal gratifications, submerged knowledges rising, _I know him when._

All of this plays into the phenomenon/phenomenology of viewcams on the Net
- as well as the sense of power (sexual, economic), ability to gather an
audience (as if the safe-word or keyword were always gainsaid in an S/M
session - the session moving to include the audience) - and if you have
read this far, you are. "You know me when."

Now make me.


_________________________________________________________________________




this might sound arrogant, but i always write for an audience
the writing has to tear me apart however
but there is someone unknown on the other end
to whom this tearing will have some sort of meaning

so that i would tend say to step out as far as i can on an edge or
perimeter
not to be caught on the other end
but to loop through the wonder
which can only occur if something new is also occurring
and that means the complicity of at least a potential reader or audience

otherwise i'm kidding myself
my beautiful work, etc.
my incredible intelligence, etc.
this is the best thing ever, etc.

even when there's no audience, there's always another book, another
seduction, another text
reading them steels me, prepares me
alan, you're an idiot, see what x or y says
alan, you've never read z before - and you don't know what you're talking
about

i need these voices
otherwise it's all a masquerade
as opposed to the masquerade of 'emanations' i can write from or into
as opposed to the masquerade of pushing myself to the limits

so paradoxically the readings keep me honest
i don't fool myself
i can tread out as far as possible on the ledge and know
that maybe it's an @ledge and i'll just fall into another text
or maybe there's more at stake
but it keeps me going

"an account of our lives beneath the mountain"


I must tell you that I know I am about to begin an "account" and I will
add to this "account" so I know that I will be doing something different
from what I have done before, and in writing, which I have not done before
now, but for which I am told that I have a gift. We have a saying that "we
live and die in the dust of someone else's novel," and now I can say as
well that "we live and die in the dust of our account."

Here in the village we are servants of the emperor. We neither read nor
write, but we are tallied thrice a year, at the beginning of each of the
Three Seasons. Already we have told you that we have three seasons, that
of the summer, that of the cooling, that of the warming. The sun slinks
back and forth swaying in the sky, and it has always done that.

Having no records beyond the tally, it is always now here, now and now,
and the tally records only crops, never names, only our presence-in-the-
shadow-of-the-mountain, and the mountain has always had a name, North
Mountain. So we are in its shadow, and we remember some names, but since
we are given only one name, geneaology trails off into the past after
several generations. We pay little attention to these, holding greatly to
the respect of our ancestors.

We are humble people and humble before our ancestors, who have lost their
names. In this fashion, we are no different than millions who have gone
before us and millions who will come after. And were I to name the name of
North Mountain, or my own - were I to name the names of the Three Seasons,
then I would betray myself and my people, pinning us to our names, crash-
ing our village against the slopes where we have dwelled peacefully, gen-
eration after generation.

My own name of course is among those of my people. And I am aware of the
simplicity of this account, what it is "to set about writing," and the
knowledge of when to stop, this account. I am aware as well that this
account then becomes the tale of a schoolboy or schoolgirl, possessing a
naivete by which you may feel you can judge me, and my ancestors, and my
village. But I must tell you as well that this naivete must be a masquer-
ade; otherwise you will know more than we have titled you, and in this
fashion you would pin me, my ancestors, the village, and the mountain
itself.

It is enough perhaps to think of before-writing or arche-writing, or that
writing which remains decipherable on one level, and indecipherable or
even absent on another, to which I have devoted my attention in this ac-
count. For there have been so many millions before you, and even the
material within which this writing appears to you has come from an un-
known source, and will disappear into an unknown destination. You will
then understand the complexity of what I am writing to you, and why things
are as they are, and not otherwise.

And with this I will end my account, of our village and ancestors, of our
mountain and the emperor, and of the three seasons.

Emily's Riddle


There is a large house many storeys high, without doors.  Built of wood
and stone and brick, it withstands the strongest storms. The windows are
curtained or otherwise obscured (perhaps they are fogged over); one can
see almost nothing of the dark interior. No sound or light emerges from
within; no one has been seen looking out, half-hidden behind the shades.
The house is without electricity, gas, water and sewer; apparently unin-
habited, it seems nonetheless well kept up. The pathways around it are
clean, the sidewalks immaculate. Lovely rose gardens grow nearby; these,
too, seem unattended, but are always neat.

What is this house and who is the gardener?

Train

what she wrote,
beauty loving you closed mouthing word you are for me oh this is forever
"me" Anyway, the train was coming. The tracks were by the side of a gully,
green and black with dark trees. There were beautiful sounds along the
thin sheen of the rails. Now the world was filled with losses as dusk
began to hide vegetation, cliffs on both sides, worlds and patterings. The
wings continued in my dreams, fluttering against a singular tremolo; for
the first time in days, I slept soundly. 

and how she liked it.
yes, so much in the world. the train was coming hard down the tracks, hard
I say... I loved the sounds made by the wheels against perfect welding,
300 kilometers an hour as darkness circled overhead, fast slim wings shud-
dering against the sky. I began to sink into an odd sleep on the overnight
express, moving several stops down the line... This time I was suspended
against bamboo, black-green pine thick with hillside moss, tarns and cav-
erns.

Sometimes there is a slight pressure upon your shoulder, and you are

slight pressure on your other shoulder, and you hear slight murmurs.
There is a rustling and a beating of wings and the air suddenly loses
weight. And there is the fear of something immense, close and to the

The Beautiful People, the Jet Set. Many have died, some are missing,
some have gone out of the public eye like Veruschka, some are shadow
figures like Twiggy, some are oddly present like Vidal Sassoon; some,
like Jackie Kennedy, are missed, and some, like Truman Capote, have
almost been forgotten, no matter the power they appeared to hold so
many years ago. And what of Gore Vidal or Lee Radziwill, or Princess
Grace (Kelly), who has died so tragically, reminding one of Di, of 
course, another tragic Princess, who came so many decades after the
Beautiful People and the Jet Set. I do not know what has happened to
Oleg Cassini and Baby Jane Holzer, but I have read Edie and forget
what happened to Baby Jane, and Bridget Bardot who was always suspect
has become a right-wing animal rights activist. I will dream of Coco
Chanel and her Jet Set.

You see, differance is a file or array; you see, it's not the subtle wisp
of cloud caressing the moon, gone before your aware-ness (mono no aware)
catches up with you... Nikuko would write the difference with the edge of
the brush; back erect, shodo following breath upon the horizontal page.
But here, she'd say, were she next to me, hands on shoulder, lips lightly
brushing the erect back, it's a question or answer of five strings, well-
defined, pure information which only happens to appear in this or that
font, of this or that size, bold or italic or underline, or any other de-
fault setting the subject might predispose herself to reading within. She,
subject-Nikuko, turns back to the brush. Kanji is not always a question or
problem of difference, however subtle; it is also a memory. Isn't every
alphabet. Only to the extent that bandwidth reduces to the twenty-six, and
then further to the two, harbored against the one. Always coherent, the
two, Nikuko said; it's literally bound that way. One swallows the other.
Moon, fogging.

TONGUE, DANCING


"The _Jinriki_ chapter states:" At that time the World-Honored One demon-
strated his great mystic powers to the entire assembly, extending his log,
broad tongue till it reached upward to the Brahma Heaven."

I say, what slid off it, writes Nikuko.

Nichirin continues: "All the other Buddhas from the worlds through the ten
directions seated on lion king thrones under jewel trees did the same, ex-
tending their long broad tongues."

A prepuce of flesh, Nikuko thinks, a foreskin of the world. Nichin adds, 
below: "The _Amida_ Sutra states that Buddhas covered a major world system
with their broad, long tongues, but lacks the truth that such a gesture
would substantiate. The _Hannya_ Sutra tells how the Buddha's tongue cov-
ered the major world system and radiated infinite light when he expounded
the _Hannya._ Yet this cannot be a proof [comparable to that of the _Jin-
riki_ chapter]. Since these two sutras are mere provisional teachings,
they obscured the Buddha's enlightenment in the remotest past." (Selected
Writings of Nichirin, ed. Yampolsky.)

Prepuce, foreskin. Foreskin, prepuce.

Nikuko, musing-transforming, clothes bursting from supine body in which
she is speaking in Nichirin's Buddhas' tongues. Nichirin turns, becoming-
tongue, long-thick pink-red flesh reaching across worlds, shadow-casting
upon islands beautiful in dreaming-waters, saliva silver with ten thou-
sand moons:

{
it can't be helped
the letters slip away from me
nikuko covers the buddhas with her tongues
covers the lands with her tongues
which carry world-scrolls of truth
sutras gospels

that place, where an arch says, excite. It needs, the force of a body

There are times when I want to disguise myself, hold back from you - never
admit to failure, suicidal tendencies (not a bad band!), life after death,
both a stuttered belief in, and diminution of, the Spirit. Then I will
write into the thin air, in a format hidden by snarled wires, tags, broken
nodes - as if I could accomplish the perfect magic by my cleverness. The
case always breaks up like this; I'm left destitute. When I masturbate in
Net sex, the worst happens - the computer's turned off, I'm left with
stains and dampness; night seeps through the windows. I am always writing
to myself...

Satori Flat


I saw a fox one night in Jerusalem that was silver-white cross in front
of me, there was a moon (that was how I was able to see him or her),
and I had at that point some sort of revelation. It felt _really good,_
and later the world was just as it had been before, exactly the same in
fact, which I didn't notice because it hadn't seemed that different
because I was concentrating on the fox.

Sometimes when I play the shakuhachi it seems to play itself, as if I 
were in touch with a spirit, and I think I'm playing _really good,_ at
least I can say that now, but during my playing if I could think, I'd 
think that I was enlightened because I can't really play that well (or
maybe that I was enlightened because it felt _really good_).

_Really good_ is a nice description for enlightenment in fact because 
it's more than just good, it's really good.

Reification and CMC 


(Reification, the inauthentic objectification of mediated concepts under
capitalism.)

Working again on the chapter Reification and the Consciousness of the Pro-
letariat in Lukacs' History and Class Consciousness, I'm struck how in
fact commodity itself is reified, how time and space are rationalized,
parceled out by capital, according to the author. Further, this seems re-
lated to an ur-state of organic flux. Here's a quote: "Thus time sheds its
qualitative, variable, flowing nature; it freezes into an exactly
delimited, quantifiable continuum filled with quantifiable 'things' (the
reified, mechanically objectified 'performance' of the worker, wholly
separated from his total human personality): in short, it becomes space. 
In this environment where time is transformed into abstract, exactly
measurable, physical space, an environment at once the cause and effect of
the scientifically and mechanically fragmented and specialized production
of the object of labour, the subjects of labour must likewise be
rationally fragmented. On the one hand, the objectification of their
labour-power into something opposed to their total personality (a process
already accomplished with the sale of that labour-power as a commodity) is
now made into the permanent ineluctable reality of their daily life. Here,
too, the personality can do no more than look on helplessly while its own
existence is reduced to an isolated particle and fed into an alien system.
On the other hand, the mechanical disintegration of the process of produc-
tion into its components also destroys those bonds that had bound individ-
uals to a community in the days when production was still 'organic.'" 

All of this is related to, say, Wittgenstein's Tractatus, Hertz's mechan-
ics, and any system which portends a rational underpinning of a concrete
real. Reification for example is intimately bound in Lukacs to capitalism
and commodity; before that, "organic" production implies a flux, not of
measurement itself, but of boundary and self. (Kristeva's "borderline
personality" would have no place here.) The possibility that self is on
one hand a coagulation of disparate debris/part-objects, and on the other,
an emanation within communicative regimes, is inconceivable. And one wants
to save the concept of reification - as well as critique it.

Because the concept is useful, referencing the objectifying of concept and
thought as commodity, and this works well with thinking through or about
the Net or CMC in general. On the other hand, it has to be weakened in its
relation to capital as the inauthentic mediation among authenticities,
since this analysis will no longer hold, and never did. Production and
power are always intimate; it is not a question so much of capital as it
is of bureaucracy, technology, and the appearance of the stranger in the
city (Simmel). 

Yet we should be careful; for example, what is the relationship between
Net politics, grass-roots politics, and geopolitics? It's not just a
matter of demographics and/or communicative strategies - it's also an
ontological issue, an issue of the performativity and believability of
language in relatively foreclosed domains (thus Lukacs, instead of ex-
ample, quotes Marx, Lenin, and so forth).

Finally, one might want to consider whether there is "anything" _beyond_
reification on-line - whether or not _beyond_ implies a spatial or psy-
chological metaphoricity. It is the "anything" that worries me, in this
realm in which everything is ultimately file, string, binary - in which,
in other words, everything is constituted. What happens to authenticity in
an arena totalized by constitution - in a period of thinking that, first,
there is no totality, and second, that everything deconstructs into part-
objects? This is still the central question of the Net - and one in which
Lukacs might prove useful.

to do some writing you have a clear crystal
and it's made of glass, so it's crystal glass
you must make sure the edges are ground glass
so light melts in them and then as well
slight chips are imperfections greatly
desired as light comes pouring through

this makes the writing what it is and all
else falls against the edge of the mass
through which light passes through the mass
with images of disks and things to tell
of what had happened to it lately
something passing from me to you

writing comes pouring through the disk
like something passing through the disk

I am a picture.
The picture is me.
Then I notice in the middle of the night
cables are being laid across the street.
And I wonder
who is laying these cables?
where are they running, the to and the fro?
do they make a pretty picture?
is the picture me?

And I go outside and look at the cables.
And I speak to the cable-mans and I say.
These are my foreheads and my elbows?
those are my waists and my brainstems and necks?
where are my faces, cable-mans I say?
do they make a pretty picture?
is the picture me?

And the cable-mans say
we are your faces.
We work so hard in the middle of the night
laying cables and faces and waists and brainstems
and arms and legs and we are your legs.
Oh legs, I say.
do they make a pretty picture?
is the picture me?

Is I am a picture?
is the picture is me?
