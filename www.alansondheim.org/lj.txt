notes on online community (preparation for an online conference)

by grounding themselves in discourse, participants in online community
constitute themselves within the very binding/cohesiveness of community
in general. they appear as communal actants. (i'm thinking of community as
discursive formation here; online, presencing oneself occurs as a form of
discourse. to be present within the community is already to be part of the
communal binding.)

these actants - communal performatives - spread both vertically - in terms
of elist or application "aura" (back-channel communications, f2f meets,
etc.) - and horizontally - in terms of cross-connections among varied
communities - acquaintancing carried across MOOs, elists, and newsgroups
for example. (online community is by and large the performing of commun-
ity.)

instead of thinking of totalized coherent community, one might think of
local relationships which are somewhat mobile (and not application-depen-
dent); these may initially be driven by subject (i.e. an elist based on a
sports team), but they become increasingly autonomous. (in other words,
people who know other people online often find themselves in other online
spaces together - or exploring other online spaces together - so that
community is becoming more dispersed, no longer settling in one or another
site, although there is almost always a home site.)

one might say that everyone is hurting, that constituting oneself within
the binding process itself forecloses all those secondary attributes,
ranging from time (providing one is using, at least in part, a message-
based system) to physical appearance. one might also note the value of
this constituting process in new applications - related to the fact that
application spaces quickly develop both sexualities and communities - the
former almost as a form of homesteading.

Meanings, Whats


*Licentious* and *wanton* emphasize the active satisfaction of desire,
although neither word is restricted in meaning to sexual impulse alone.
_Licentious_ can suggest any kind of excessive freedom in behavior that
goes past legal or moral bounds or violates customary standards of
behavior: a _licentious_ attitude toward premarital affairs. _Wanton,_ by
contrast, does not suggest extreme freedom so much as unruly or wasteful
self-indulgence. Used of people or people's behavior it suggests
sensuality more than sexuality: the _wanton,_ fast-living jet set. Only in
its sense of gratuitous does it suggest extreme inhumanity or cruelty:
_wanton_ slaughter. (S.I. Hayakawa, Modern Guide to Synonyms and Related
Words.)

Unruly, variegated, wayward, Nikuko and Jennifer and Julu have been
abandoned by the side of the road - Nikuko with her parables, Julu with
the dark side of the performative, Jennifer with her taunting and
nostalgic behavior. What is left but the sleep of the dead, the deepest
sleep possible, the exhaustion without bounds. Alan tries sleep remedy
after sleep remedy; Alan does not sleep, hir body on fire, self-indulgent,
located at the root of the word. Alan's flesh trembles, Alan's bones ache
with the embrasions of sheets cut into the skin. Hir dreams break arches,
hir eyes drown; Alan has never been near water. Hir feet take hir far from
here; hir body splits; licentious, it's fucked by Jennifer, Julu, Nikuko,
stabbed with implements, abandoned in _wanton destruction._

Rackover Viewfinder

The Mitchell motion picture cameras shown in Sunset Boulevard employ
rackover viewfinders, which displace the film, replacing it with a ground
glass screen - which is racked back for the shooting itself. The same
system is used in the Cine-Kodaks, and a somewhat clumsy attachment was
available for the older non-reflex 16mm Bolex as well. Look through the
viewfinder, frame your subject; reset the film, and shoot. The
displacement is temporal, not spatial; one, then the other, then the one.
Sight is otherwise a disestablishment of position, peering around a
corner; here, the corner flattens, in the guise of time, for the means of
constituted representation. In Sunset Boulevard, Desmond speaks about her
silence; Max is silent about her speech; the noise is filled by the
writer. It is not a displacement of silence by sound or of one
constitution by another, but of spaces by times, times by spaces, air by
water, water by air. At the end the dead writer speaks.

At the end the drowned writer is racked over and it's there after that
time he can start writing.

Pas d'une


"I work with someone I trust and whose vision I revere, as I do yours. It
is the way a mind works that is beautiful, precise, and precious. [...]
There are dreams to be placed before the world. The world may hate them,
but that is not important. It is important that each of us raise the
standard of civilization the tiny fraction that is immortal law." - Martha
Graham letter quoted in Martha Graham, a Biography, by Don McDonagh

Oh, "said Jennifer, this is so truly amazing, I do always work with
immortal law, it is so wonderful, and my dreams are of wondrous beauty.
Alas, "replied Julu, that the world hates us and our tremendous dancing,
our bodies twist and turn "everywhere the typing goes, "yes, said
Jennifer, the twisting and turning of language, so much fun!

Oh, "said Jennifer, we do will live forever, our bodies do such twisting
and turning. Alas, "replied Julu, it is so true, and just so, "she did a
pirouette.

Such were the perturbations of galactic clusters, as that they revolved by

Every death is different from every other. Death does not level;
each death is individual, inscribed - to such a degree that one
can hardly speak of death as a phenomenon - rather a collection
of interruptions. To each, his or her death, to each death, an
individual. "What part of 'duh' don't you understand" - more or
less from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. One can never say, he or she
has died - rather, that interruptions occur everywhere, and at
least once in each and every life. Beyond that, one must remain
silent, or agree to listen to stories, one after another, forever.


___


Death Meaning


Death is an impossibility. Since it is an impossibility it cannot happen.
Therefore there is no death.

If death could happen, all things would be possible. Since not all things
are possible, death cannot happen.

Death is a word for "this is not possible." It is also a word for "not
everything is possible."

If everything were possible, there would be no need [word] for possibil-
ity. Since there is a need for possibility, not everything is possible,
and there is no death.


There is nothing outside of meaning.
Meaning is all there is.
Meaning is a disease.
Meaning is a disease of humanity.
Meaning's absence is the preservation of the world.
Only in meaning is absence to be found.
Meaning is a disease.
There is nothing outside but ourselves.


If death existed, it would be possible to inscribe; if death existed, it
would be impossible to write.

Note on "Culture Interpenetrated"


"Certain differences may also be observed in the arrangement of bead em-
broidery the forms of which are very uniform over an extended area of the
western prairies. A characteristic form of this design consists of a cen-
tral diamond or rectangle, from the corners of which emanate lines that
terminate in triangles facing the central field either with the apex or
with the base; sometimes a cross-bar with prongs is found at the end of
these lines." (Franz Boas, Primitive Art)

Boas' work appears both agglutinatory and proto-structuralist throughout;
it occupies a third term among fluidics and (Hertzian) mechanics - see
Irigaray. As such, the two relevant terms are "characteristic form" and
"field" - fields embodied in forms, and within the general cultural mat-
rix, forms moving through fields. "Characteristic form" can reference a
nexus or family of usages; it absorbs exceptions (in terms of parameters)
with a very high default tag - in other words, it behaves as a strange
attractor (catastrophe theory) or potential well / plateau (nonequilibri-
um thermodynamics). The high default tag allows creative extensions to a
great degree - to such an extent that one might also consider the slow
movement of the form itself across a morphological and transforming field
of design elements. Using even older terminologies, we might think of this
movement in terms of the "life of the form."

In this manner, we also manage to avoid issues of relatively exact toler-
ance or standardization that, via, say, the critique of Duvignaud (Change
at Shebika) problematize the diagrammatic approach of Levi-Strauss or
Piaget. One thinks instead of cybernetic fields of feedback and catastro-
phic "jumps," as well as differentiable manifolds - characteristic form
bound and unbound by all of them, moving as kinetic and potential energy
(somewhat like Waddington's chreod) - and in this sense, one might further
say (using Winnicott), that: Every object is transitional. This also moves
one past or through the problematic of the proper name, which remains tied
to the characteristic form (I'm thinking primarily of natural kinds here),
as it changes diachronically or synchronically (re: Saussure).

Eventually of course one can abandon the notion of characteristic form as
well, simply looking at the images, moving from form to imaginary, and
through this deliberate misunderstanding, beginning a mute comprehension
of the function of culture within the real, as well as culture interpene-
trated.

The Jade


Confucius, Analects X 5, Waley translation: When carrying the tablet of
jade, he seems to double up, as though borne down by its weight. He holds
it at the highest as though he were making a bow, at the lowest, as though
he were proffering a gift. His expression, too, changes to one of dread
and his feet seem to recoil, as though he were avoiding something. When
presenting ritual-presents, his expression is placid. At the private aud-
ience his attitude is gay and animated.

Legge translation: 1. When he was carrying the sceptre _of his ruler,_ he
seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did
not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor
lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance
seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as
if they were held by something to the ground. 2. In presenting the pre-
sents _with which he was charged,_ he wore a placid appearance. 3. At his
private audience, he looked highly pleased.

He was doing what, a good deed, he was unhappy. Smiling, he looked up with
the ritual jade held high, his feet close to the ground, slightly angled.
He proffered a ritual object to another, the jade, what, held high, his
pace solemn, his expression one of happiness. Crying, but befit a man, he
bent his body close to the ground, the piece of ritual jade held high.
Quietly, in rage, he shuffled his feet, nimbly moving among the pillars of
the great hall, the gift of jade in his pleasant hands. Angrily, he strode
across the floor of the outer pavilion, the jade weighing heavily in his
hands held high. He was doing something, what, for his private audience.
He looked highly pleased, miserable, somewhat animated.

the most beautiful thing in the world, light gleams light
light moving from one to another room
there is light flowing from the window
light seeping beneath the door, light over the transom
 ^breathing
the light murmurs deep into the floor, walls, ceiling
light gleams light, in another room
in another room, the ceiling has sent emissions
there are dull glows, surfaces murmuring to surfaces
nothing is ever in silence, nothing in void
nothing in abyssal vacuum 
nothing ungleaming with the beauty and light of the world
 ^breathing
with illuminations no matter how faint, how subtle
how subtle is the shimmer of heat, radio elasticity
elasticity of the world murmuring the world
the gleaming of light gleaming light

Notes on the Phenomenology of the Sty|us


Consider the use of the stylus for hand-held computers and touch-screens
of all sorts; it performs the following: pointing, touching, moving, and
holding, across an activated potential surface.

In this regard, we have this simple formalization:

a: placing stylus down
b: raising stylus up
c: moving stylus while down
d: moving stylus while up
e: keeping the stylus in place on the matrix

a -> c,b,e (a,b) = tap (a,c) = drag (a,e) = hold
b -> d,a
c -> b,e
d -> a
e -> b,c

This is a mathematics of contiguity, a mathematics of touch and 
movement, in relation to an object:

touching the object;
moving across the surface of the object;
remaining in place upon the surface of the object;
withdrawing from the object.

Clearly, remaining in place is a subset of movement (0 speed), or of
touching and withdrawing, since such demands a certain relation to 
the object, a certain quantity of time-in-touch. But phenomenologically,
it represents something entirely different, a residing or inhabitation,
which must be given its own status.

Think of all of this as a formalization of _inscription_ to the widest
degree possible, perhaps a topography of inscription. Technologically, it
is related to the screen raster on one hand, and to reed styli used for
cuneiform, ostraca styli, etc., on the other. Phenomenologically, it is
the relationship of a tool to a surface, a hand to a body - in other
words, a caress to the caressed.

More than that, however, since the stylus also creates a trace - the
creation of a grapheme and/or a performative in relation to an operation
which begins, ends, is maintained, or transformed. These categories, like
that of the tool and the hand, or the surface and the body, are fuzzy,
interpenetrating; they serve only for the moment of arousal, the delicate
approach of the stylus tip to the screen surface, the promise of further
and intended activity.

One might continue in this direction, relating the stylus to the wand of
the magician, to swords, batons, and phalli of all sorts, to vectors in
the sky forming the outline of constellations, even to vectors emanating
from the cartesian origin. One might crudely apply temporality and gender,
one might think from arrows to matrix, from grapheme to subtext and the
Peircean sheet of assertion. So many directions, so much writing ahead, 
so much touch of one against another, so much phenomenology, theoretical
structures, the very flesh of the wor(|)d ...

what the ancients recognized, that we are ghosts invisible

we are transparent to gaia & transparent to to dark matter,
transparent to neutrinos & transparent to cosmos,
cornered in inflationary universes,
held taut & visible by logics of the surface,
transparent to bacteria, prions, viruses,
mother-father bacteria, slime & molecular soup,
granularities & strings layered upon granularities,
& layers in layers, layers tilted, askew in relation to layers,
& layers interpenetrated, layers corroded, 
& layers imbricated & twisted,
we look at ourselves & see ghosts & name them, unknowing,
we witness ourselves as eternal, obdurate, opaque & historic,
dates sliding against dates & times against times,
& no dates & no times at all, & spaces & no spaces,
& layered spaces, & spaces layered against spaces,
transparent throughout all of them,
all of them transparent throughout,


__


"shimmering ontologies of transparency"

accordingly, shifting, looking around, coming to mind, intervalling, dia-
gramming our always-already-having-disappeared, entering into knowledge of
our ghosthood,

|   dream / real / constituted virtual / the gnawing of dark matter
|    - symbolic - imaginary - idiocy of the real (practico-inert)
|                          imaginary / as if
|                              imaginary

this is the ontology of transparency, the veering among dream and real,
among the constituted (programming virtual) and the pervasion of parti-
cles and dark matter. and this is also on yet another layer and yet
another interpenetration, a veering among the symbolic and imaginary,
coupled with the idiocy of the real. and on yet another layer, the as-if,
opening into the troubled problematic of the infinite, veering through the
imaginary - and yet, on still another, the imaginary, as if there were, 
as if an itself, as if we were dissolving, constantly, within our very
constitution ...

so moreso, the desire to be transparent as well, already-ghosting against
earth and sky, already in the process of dissolution, emptiness to empti-
ness, slight translucency at the edges, peripheral shadows - both towards
eternity, both towards death.

and towards lassitude, languor, the transparency of reception, opening. 
and that recognition that we may have been elsewhere-born, hardened,
weighted with the world, foreclosed - and here, opened, delicate, we can
hardly believe it.

Likenessness

Dreaming last night, there were soft animals in the garden, larger slugs,
I would go about myself looking for philosophies and explanations. The
first that came to mind, the likenessness of animals, similarities or
styles across the soft tissues. A voice called in the midst of that green,
the sunlight thick upon the leaves, called out the problematic of
crustaceans, their sudden underbellies, quick changes from soft to
hard; insects as well came to mind, joints holding forms together. Still
and with all of this, likenessness, a form of coherencing, seemed relevant
enough, the cultivation of styles among animals. More than motility,
likenessness tended towards a way of being in the world, and now, awake, I
apply this as well to mountains with sharp peaks, or rounded mountains, or
ox-bow rivers and lakes, or plateaus with mud-crack patternings, or
basaltic columns, or clays or crystals. Ecosystems and geologies have
their faults to be sure; they also have their styles, holding onto the
custom and shape of the imminent earth. It is this I call likenessness,
finding it everywhere, not least in the giant dream-slugs, yellow, green,
and black, in the gardens of my sleep.

"with me"

to be transparent after death resonates beautifully with me, annihilation
to the limit, an awaiting of particulate matter, diffused harmonic peaks.
and to write the phenomenology of transparency, to recognize we have nev-
ever been alive in this life, is to achieve a subtle transcendence by id-
entification; it is not the Other which greets me throughout the day, but
others, innumerable totalities, swarms, sentiences, obdurate and inchoate
matter as well. it is a strategy for living, embouchure of chaos.

my recent texts, taken apart, reassembled, produce sprays of micro-organ-
isms, neutrino showers, virtual pair creations, dark matter sputterings. 
their argument is in the form of fugal repetition, fugue states, meanders
among those sayings hanging in the still warm air of a sunny afternoon. 
one can hardly argue among the sweet and sickly smell of leaves and stems
ripening in the humid air...

"thinking through death and transparency, Why!, i can never tell a story,
i can only hope that the words themselves make as little difference as the
affairs of men and women, thus, "said Izanagi, "we are propelled by the
very attitudes of our speech, as if proffering beginnings and endings when
- for all the worlds know, there are nothing but stirrings, and "such are
small, "replied Nikuko, "there is little cleverness about them, at least
as little as might be safely ignored, "and what wouldn't be such, "said

the wind

it is said that the parable is the most ephemeral, the weakest source of
knowledge. and for this reason, the parable is the truest source as well,
existing for the length of a breath, trembling before rumors of the abso-
lute. 

its very trembling hints at forces beyond our control, shadowy existenc-
es, ghosts of tracts purporting to describe the world flowing out beneath
them.

the source of parables, nikuko said, is the comprehending of worlds; par-
ables accomplish this through weakness and participation, bending in the
wind.

Thematics


I write in a relative vacuum, almost no feedback; so it comes about I lose
track of thematics, corrections; so I wander over unforgiving territory,
ignorant; today I look back at double files, the current and the last,
looking across death, among other processes transparent to the world. For
it was during this period, after six months, that my mother died; this is
recorded, across the files, an extended meditation on death, which has
always encompassed me.

What is there elsewhere in these files? Transparency, invisibility, the
slight, weakness, everywhere, accounting for our presence in absence, and
in fact an inversion of death and life: for it may be that we already are
of the death, descended from the living replete in dark matter, a far more
ethical world.

"Texts on bagkeys, relation of protolanguage and performativity of the
body to keystroking - end users, the three lamps, lake texts below, cancer
texts etc." say my reminders - bagkeys being a key capture program, recor-
ding keystrokes - in other words, the incessant movement of the fingers
across the keyboard. Somehow this references another hysteria of the vir-
tual-real - creating a mathematics of Press, Release, Move, Hold, leading
to a phenomenology of contiguity. It's as if the text were primarily a
coding or decoding of bodily movement, not an autonomous production or
computational emission. What can we do with this? We can look at proto-
language or pidgens, we can find our way clumsy in the world, the enmeshed
and performing body, the body in movement, breathing through the text.

There there are the texts of the lake and the light spilling, meandering -
waters and lights, the body suspended in the midst of the former, opening
up to the latter. The insertion moves back and forth from screen and key
and computer to water and light, but it is the same dispersing of selving
at work in the death texts, in virtual existence, in media emissions.

There are also the texts of the rectification of names, thinking again
through issues of designation and harmonies, names disappearing as quickly
as any other worlds. And a long text on the phenomenology of the projects
I designed for the Trace virtual-writer-in-residence position, projects
which were organized around backbone pages, writing/scrawling, disappear-
ances.

All of this reflects a position of waning articulations, translucent
structures which may or may not present themselves. The phenomenology in-
sists as well on its lack of positionality, on its self-effacement, on its
spew or flow - such are its grounds. Again I return to thinking through
contiguity, the ephemera of touch, of passing-by.

I write the theory of the three lamps, of open circuitry, batteries using
the universe as broken linkage; I write of kludges in the world, things
coming together primarily as bricolage, making-do, held together by lines
of code going nowhere, inflated, almost correct, reporting errors at best
to /dev/null. And I write the theory of the end-user, oblivious to machin-
ery and undercurrents, and the philosophy of cancer and the stereotypic-
ality of death, and the stories of death, the meaning and meaninglessness
of stories.

I write about my mother's death and cancer as dispersion and online com-
munities as dispersions, no longer organized around particular applica-
tions or sites, but constituted (as the very first probably were) by loose
associations and a kind of mobility - one seeing, for example, old
friends appearing in all sorts of places. 

I return endlessly to the binding of names, to those names that should
participate in creation, but die stillborn, as if there were something to
learn from empathetic magic:
   every file leaves itself space
   unfathomed, between one and another domain;
   it's here that wings, terror terrified
   holds to the semblance of the real
I write as well about phoric meaning, meaning carried on the back, holding
oneself as if against death, and I write up against the wall of death, as
if it were transparent, and I return to transparency and meaning lost and
not regain, a continuous contemplation of death:
   i'm tired of making meaning, i'm tired of meaning and making meaning,
   tired of all of this, of carrying the necessity of language,
and as well:
     1 i have not experienced death; death is not an experience. THIS IS 
A TEXT
     2 FOR A MASSACRE. for to one, then the other. THIS IS NOT A TEXT.

There are gaps, there is a funeral, a period of mourning after a death,
there is Nikuko returning. Mixed, technology: A discussion of the rack-
over viewfinder, the implied doubling of vision and the displacement of
time in favor of the singularity of space, an inversion of our binding to
temporality and its singularity. So philosophy appears even in this rela-
tion, just as the phenomenology of contiguity appears at first in terms
of an analysis of the stylus-pen used with hand-held computer touch-
screens. Everything reduces to a motivation of primary constituents -
space, time, motion, stillness, touch, release. And as usual, all such
constituents are seen, first, as constituted, granted meaning by the human
articulation of semantic domains, and second, as interpenetrated, proble-
matized by the real (as well as careful analysis).

A philosophy of characteristic forms, drawn from thinking about Boas, is
hinted at; such forms fall between structuralism and post-structuralism,
are represented by fuzzy logics in every direction, and indicate as well a
wavering position between real and virtual, constituted and deployed.

More return to ourselves as ghosts invisible, writing within and without
the floating world, dark matter and the thickness of the real always
beyond our grasp; we are on the verge of discovering the real, finding
ourselves always already displaced from it; culture told us so. A text
emphasizes the "shimmering ontologies of transparency":
|   dream / real / constituted virtual / the gnawing of dark matter
|    - symbolic - imaginary - idiocy of the real (practico-inert)
|                          imaginary / as if
|                              imaginary
as displacement takes hold, as a form of suturing occurs, and I am brought
back from one realm to another, all within the same. Philosophy mingles
with the therapeutic; I find solace in certain positions I, perhaps, wish
to find - these also appearing, as if natural, from one or another source
located in the murky articulation of unbounded thought.

Finally there is an analysis, once again, of the nature of parable, to
which I ascribe these texts, and a final:
  and there between silence and silence, there the rooms we have left,
  there, the blank world, the slate, there, erasable memory, all such
  memory, written and lost, words hungered, lost, nothing:nothing:nothing

Such is the process which continues through my work, through my avatars,
through Jennifer, Julu, Nikuko, and the rest, through the programming,
through the conferencing and discussions - a process which is singular
insofar as it is based on constitution upon constitution, problematic upon
problematic, and interpenetrations, fuzzy phenomena, exculpations, the
breathing of a body reciting, praying, creating, telling - such a body of
love or death, such a written body, such a body writing.

The Dream of Svengali and Trilby


Last night, hallucinating, half awake, half asleep, Svangali passing Tril-
by small wooden frameworks, taking her under, hypnotized. I realize this
is impossible, keep trying to rework the dream, over and over again. I get
up, take some notes, go back to sleep.

What I realize is this: that hypnosis is intransitive, that there is no
passing of objects, not even dream objects, not even states or concepts,
ideas or processes - it's this precise confrontation without such passing
that constitutes the hypnotic state - intense communication in vacuo, an
uncanny empathetic alterity. Such is the state of expectancy, that Trilby,
and the rest of us, succumb.

other than Derrida, meaning: in flight


"If I were optimistic enough on the subject, I would say that I see the
journey of my brief existence as a journey in view of determining and
naming the place from which I will have had the experience of exteriori-
ty. And the anamnesis we were talking about at the outset, this anamnesis
would be in view of identifying, of naming it--not effacing the exterior-
ity, I don't think it can be effaced--but of naming it, identifying it,
and thinking it a little better than I have done so far." - Derrida, There
is No _One_ Narcissism, in Points, trans. Kamuf & others. And this in
relation to an exteriority beyond exteriority, in relation, or brought up
or into question or commentary, of the Judaic; one can see a differend at
work within an _interiority_ here, a form of internal exile, but from
what, if not a non-exile garnered only by an otherwise unidentified alt-
erity. And in this regard, we notice again the hypnotic and its relation
to non- or in-transitivity, alterity without an object, always, to the
extent a representation, a misrecognition or misrepresentation, but one
grounding, shifting the grounds, never called into question. I write of or
on (the body of) this, a place I identify, to the extent it remains
peripheral to identity, weak or fragile, almost invisible, certainly out
of or one with, the imaginary. It is the premise or promise of the world
at its horizon, as one pursues "one's" project - in spite of the fact
that, deeply random or chaotic, a project remains just that, in pursuit of
a goal, in pursuit of meaning as well. Meaning is always in flight; one
writes within the gap. And culture is always already liminal, interstiti-
al; death, of being and Beings, tending towards foundation, guarantee,
contract, strategy. Writing into the void is the semblance of determina-
tion, the substrate on the move.

EL CID (culture intelligence demise)

thinking about dinosaurs:

the culture of dinosaurs (looking for materials, ignoring them - digging
deeper in human-occupied caves, etc.) - why assume there is none? to the
extent I imagine that any material found would be seen as a (later)
occlusion - ignored - whereas it seems to me that, over a 160 million year
period, culture would appear, create a situation for identifying families
and groups etc., for surviving under widely-varying ecological niches and
circumstances -

intelligence of dinosaurs (assumption of reasonable brain size, given
microcomputer ability to control large-scale entities) - why not assume
some inordinately intelligent species, since intelligence, over a 160
million year period, would develop, again, for survival - reading back-
wards through brain size / convolutions seems begging the question here - 

demise of dinosaurs (ethos of disappearance of 160 million years of evolu-
tion catastrophically by the random crashing of a single two-mile piece of
rock) - in any case, such a deeply literally senseless act of (what is
inscribed as) violence certainly puts an end to all human aspirations and
theological consequences thereof - two miles may be walked in half an hour
at a quick pace - 160 million years, at least 80 times the length of human
existence however defined - if compared to the historical period, incon-
ceivable - how can this be possibly fathomed - any question here is beg-
ging the question here -

so culture, intelligence, demise, the three, El Cid, The Lord, in a way,
in other words a strategy or mechanism indicative of worlds beyond worlds
- did individual dinosaurs have names, early humans, australopithecines -
we do seem very busy about our assignments - El Cid meandering in a land-
scape of, what, and such sounds there were, one can only imagine something
beyond our incessant roaring, syllables perhaps, eloquence and rhetoric of
the highest order -

how much do we read backwards, rear-projection-screen into monster and
monstrosity? it seems that there must, somewhere, exist artifacts to prove
my case - to be continued -

my goal, by franz kafka

my goal, as a 3 kilometer asteroid hurtling towards earth, is to destroy
the existing ecosystem by kicking up dust, rock, and whirlwind, darkening
the skies, poisoning the air, churning up the water, and polluting the
ocean. my goal is to eliminate all trace of life, which is difficult
enough; however, i shall at least take care of the larger pieces. there
are some furry mammals which are distinguished by a rather playful
attitude towards just about everything; i'm certain these shall survive,
no matter the quantity of hurled torrents or molten lavas. these mammals
shall skip merrily about, but will lose their delicious dinosaur eggs; on
the other hand, they'll learn quickly enough to gobble up embryos of
flaccid dino-corpses, while chattering incessantly to each other. my goal,
however, is to make this as difficult as possible, so that later human
beings will look up at the sky and say, oh what a world. they do not
realize that i am sentient, as driven as they are, not blind gravity, but
by a desire to annihilate. every stone has its mandate, every speck of
dust, its destiny. oh what nonsense i can write, "said nikuko, having
finished her studious peroration.

"The hand of even the most cautious operator was bound to be drawn into
the cutter space if it slipped, particularly when, as often happened, the
timber was hurled back (by the cutter block) while the operator was pres-
sing the article to be planed against the table with one hand and feeding
it to the cutter spindle with the other. This lifting and recoiling of the
timber could not be anticipated nor prevented as it may have been due to
gnarls or knots in the timber, to an insufficietly high cutting-speed, to
warped cutters, or to uneven pressure of the operator's hands on the arti-
cle." (Kafka, quoted in Max Brod, Franz Kafka, a Biography.)

friday, nothing comes to mind: which means that there are no entailments,
less innovation; nothing dredged from the past; no history, written or
rewritten; no sudden inspirations, intuitions; nothing seems incomplete;
there's no need in the wide dominion; it's not that things are finished,
fulfilled, satiated; it's just that there's no draw, no pull, nothing out
of the ordinary; no nagging conscience; it's just that things are as they
are; it's just that nothing comes to mind.

from above

one day the gods were talking. they were in the spirit world, far above
the earth., they looked down and saw men and women and children and horses
beneath their feet. how can we do this, they said to one another. we have
sore necks from looking down, our feet are in our way, we can't see very
clearly, sometimes we fall over from dizziness, our feet are useless,
we're just flailing in the air. the gods agreed, other ones saying, it's
always sunny or dark here, we don't have any rain or snow or wind, there
aren't any noises except our own, it's either too hot or too cold, our
toes are always cold, it's awkward standing on nothing, we'll never get
used to this. some of the other gods were talking. they can't hear us down
there, we can't hear them very well either, everything's always underfoot,
we can't even trip without falling into our beds, there doesn't seem to be
any reason to go anywhere, we're always sliding all over the place anyway.
some gods said, without friction beneath our feet it's really difficult to
move about as well; when we shoot arrows, we're thrown backwards, when we
make love, we have to hold onto each other for dear life, and to visit
relatives is a major undertaking of slipping and dashing. some gods said,
it's good to turn upside-down here, stand on our heads, it's a good trick,
all those men and women and children and horses seem to be in heaven,
we're just floating somewhere beneath them. some other gods were whirling
and whirling around, trying to stop, their arms flailing in all direc-
tions, a bit uncomfortable and dizzy. it's time to sleep said some of the
other gods, and they lay down and went to sleep, their bodies floating
about and nuzzling each other. it made the other gods tired, and they went
to sleep a little bit later, they had this conversation before, it always
went nowhere, and they were floating out of each other's hearing anyway.

well, i've heard this before, and you might, just then, find yourself
hearing it again, and you might be wondering, did i just hear this, and
you might find yourself thinking, i did hear this, just a moment ago, and
you might be thinking, i never know when this will stop, i never know when
this repetition will end, and you might find yourself listening and
wondering, all through the end of it.

recycling older and older thoughts, i would take comfort home in the
thinking of them, i would be comfortable with the thinking of them, i'd be
one with repeating them, i'd be one with repeating myself, all through the
end of them, all through their coming to an end.

don't you know all this new language? are you blind to this new language?
do you understand this new language? will i have disappeared (lit. be one
of the disappeared) before you are born? (for i won't be around to tell
you, i won't be able to answer your questions, i won't be able to tell you
anything new, you'll have only this from me, you'll have to make of it
what you will.)

you might find yourself reading this, you might find yourself making of 
it what you will, you might find yourself questioning, you might find an
empty space, you might find yourself questioning, you might think of me, 
you might ask a question.
