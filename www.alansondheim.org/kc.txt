


What I have to pass on to you


There have been numerous times when the Net appears increasingly dis-
tanced, receding in the manner of a shoreline which loses detail as
the sun sets or skies cloud. This is most frequent in the text-driven
domains, what I've called the darknet, and the result I've called
defuge, among other things - the slight feeling of exhaustion and dis-
taste one feels, upon, for example, attempting to read the same novel
over and over again.

A sense of waste, production gone soft and awry, collapse of the world
into soft-machine, babble, murmur and uneasy sleep.

Now I have had this sensation repeatedly, as the laptop sits like a
grey plate on a grey table, emptied of sensation, the words dribbling
across the mold - everything loosens, disinvests, while voices thin to
a tired keening. The corpse is mine, just as "the concept is mine,"
and I hover, feverish, with the concept pressed against me - thinking
the Net reduces _everything_ to communication, even thinking takes on
a tendency towards the symbolic.

It remains there like an unfinished dinner which insists the animal
walked, plant swayed in the breeze. I use the fork on the symbolic.

There are thin cuts all over my body as I tried to write myself, tried
to let the blood flow. Things grew more and more wearisome; like a
freshman essay on suicide, I yawned. If the plate shattered in the
still air, I didn't hear it. If the reader came calling, I didn't hear
the footsteps, doorbell, telephone, announcement of _new_ mail on the
plate, always fresher, full of excitement.

I think the truth of the elderly is the release from meaning. That is
conventional wisdom. There is nothing to be gained. Everyone's life-
span overlaps everyone else's. Surprisingly, if anything is, no one is
jealous of others' intervals. I want it all, want you and want me
being me: clumsy, horrid, insufferable, at the same time. Like a tumor
I'd inhabit you; I don't have the strength to inhabit myself, not
without sleep after sleep.

I now know that everything is a matter of interpretation - and not
that everything is subject to interpretation. This is what I have been
taught by this and other plates. If I could pass one thing on to you,
it would be this, this concern. I will repeat it: "Everything is a
matter of interpretation" and it is not the case that "everything is
subject to interpretation." Interpret this as you will. Look it up and
down, try it on. Think of _matter,_ of the _subject,_ of _everything._
In my lifetime,I have tried to think of everything, and I have entered
a state of withdrawal. For everything interpenetrates, interconnects.
It's a soup out there, in here, everywhere. Everything is chained to
everything else, and levels like the "domain" of signifiers are as
impure as the rest.

We clear ourselves out and the domains out and pretend we've made for
example technology or a gallery. We've made intervals for ourselves,
dates for exhibitions, lifespans for operating systems. In two dozen
years, just that, they'll be collectors items, inoperable, memories of
driven men and women half-way to sleep and sleep. None of us can do
without it; none of us can do.

Meaning, Again


So you're saying you're saying there is there is no transcendent mean-
ing, said Julu, said Julu. Right, said Jennifer, said Jennifer, there
is there is only meaning relative to particular domains or discursive
formations. Thus one might one might ask ask the meaning of "cuivre"
in English, or even the meaning of the fact that there are there are
five Platonic solids in three dimensions, but an infinite number in
two. In the former case, one is asking is asking for a translation,
and in the latter, for a morphism that relates morphism that relates
the number of solids to the dimensional number. In both situations,
meaning is meaning is to be sought in articulating structures, either
between regimes (discursive formations) or within one.

And beyond that, said Jennifer, said Jennifer, there is there is
nothing to be considered considered; there is there is only the re-
dundancy of empty space, the isomorphic qualities of existence itself.
Julu replied Julu replied that Jennifer was Jennifer was very intelli-
gent, and there was much to be learned be learned in these articulat-
ing structures, which could only remind which could only remind her of
the Bourbaki mother structures and maybe some odds and ends from cate-
gory theory - and for that matter, one might further ask further ask
whether meaning was was possessed by a community of individuals, or
might possibly might possibly instead reside in a platonism (at least
on occasion) based on said articulating structures. In which case
meaning would be be considered considered a flux of such structures.
There was there was much more to be said said on the matter, for that
matter or any matter hardly harbored matter hardly harbored meaning by
virtue of nothing more than inert existence, if there were there were
such a thing, mused Jennifer, mused Jennifer.

Meaning is always a distribution, they said. (What is a concept. Does
meaning link concepts. Do concepts exist outside of consciousness. Are
all concepts correct, or does truth/falsity play no role in their cre-
ation or consideration. Does one possess concepts. Can a machine have
concepts. Do concepts exist in relation to discursive formations. Do
they exist outside of such formations. Can they exist outside of lang-
uage itself. Are concepts constructors of meaning. Are they the quala
of meaning. Is meaning always meaning-among. Are concepts always among
other concepts. What is the role of difference here. What is the role
of differentiation. Do concepts exist on a _certain plane._ No, they
do not; neither does meaning.)

What glues the world together? It's the energy to make meaning. It's
the investment in meaning. Meaning is the investment among articulated
domains. Yes, meaning has a decidedly linguistic turn. The world is
there, not glued together, but it is meaning that worlds the world for
or within consciousness; it is the glue of consciousness. Is there
more than the glue? Yes, there are whole unfounded domains, invisibil-
ities, ghosts, uncanny phenomena, ectoplasms. And these relate or
don't relate? Yes, yes, and yes...

Whoever said yon Cassius has a mean and hungry look he thinks too much
such men are dangerous


That I would think too much across these texts, sitting as Proust or
Teste, alive or in fiction, that such thinking can only build upon
itself in order to collapse as castles in sand, such proliferation
seems at odds with a world constructed so simply as to contain three
visible dimensions, one temporal that appears to pace itself - or
rather we pace ourselves across the dimension which draws us forward
to death, it's inexorable, continuous - it's the great pull which
tends towards a varying horizon, perhaps no horizon at all, some of us
see a portal or screen (some of us don't) - that perhaps it's not such
a question of thinking too much, but of withdrawing from the manipula-
tion of the material world, leaving practice alone - there's only so
much violin playing in a lifetime for example - then one sleeps, re-
membering those three dimensions are extruded, simulacra or residue in
a manner of speaking, of some heat-birth of a local universe, of some
constraints rolling up the higher dimensions, of particles which have
never obeyed the classical laws of matter, aristotelian logic - we
live within the evidence of our senses - it takes technology to extend
beyond the inconceivably limited bandwidth here - the world passes by,
unknown - we're glassy, transparent - invisible plankton in the ab-
sence of the scheme of things - most of the spectrum passes right
through us - neutrinos for example - in any case: That I would think
too much across these texts, sitting as Proust or Teste, alive or in
fiction, is only testament to a certain truth that emerges, once one
disinvests or is disinvested (it need not be one or the other) - that
meaning, whether or not constituted by human labor in the real (res-
onant within and without the habitus) - is hardly worth the investment
- think of this not as thinking too much, but as allowing thought to
reach conclusion - thought to come towards the horizon of all thinking
- as if, _what if these words are inhabited, as nonsense is inhabited,
by noise_ - this _senseless text_ or idiolect, self-constructed image
of psychosis perhaps - this horizon where sense meets nonsense, non-
sense shudders into noise - it's this that is the result of thinking
too much (which is never enough) - the thinking of the material struc-
tures of communication (rubbing our faces in them) (the collapse of
all that is worthwhile among culture and civilization!) - I already
feel the energy draining, blood seeping away, a certain ennui, defuge
sets in - what I have already written about: That I would think too
much across these texts, sitting as Proust or Teste, alive or in fic-
tion - it's the blood at my feet that worries you, not me - the hard
labor of thought, in fact, vessels bursting - organs all mixed up ...

Notes on material culture


Fukuoka Castle ruins - from around 1601. Although with interior, middle,
exterior, perceptually, the structure doesn't hold. I walk from level to
level, across sloped land, up wide stone stairs with small risers, al-
most worn away, dangerous. A rainy day, and the greys, blacks, and
greens, are utterly intense. The overall impression is neolithic; very
little remains of the superstructure, and the masonry is intensely
fit, perfect. I still do not understand "visual Japan," which I place
within the bleakness of interpreting kanji for someone who has not
studied the language - I look for visual meaning, since nothing else
exists for me. The utterly obdurate nature of the stone, however, con-
tradicts its appearance; I myself am hardened against it.

I have started the shakuhachi, having found an ancient instrument in a
second hand store near the Castle. It is a bamboo flute; the bamboo
isn't particularly wide, but is quite thick; there are lacquer bands
where it comes apart in the middle. It is end-blown, and difficult. And
it is entirely organic - nothing metallic, exact, about it, with only
five holes. I write this watching sumo on television; there have been
big upsets in the Tokyo matches today. Again, technology is absent, or
rather backgrounded, just as it is in the torii, gateways of Shinto
shrines, which can be massive, stone or cement or wood or even steel
(there are several connected to a small shrine several blocks from here
which are rusting away), and grey or white or worn or weathered or
orange.

The Pocket Monster television scare of a few weeks ago doesn't seem to
have staved the desire for Pocket Monsters at the local 7-11, which are
heavily advertised as usual; there are all sorts of things one can buy:
books with games in them, electronic Poke Mon devices (sitting next to
the open odennabe, oden being a soup with various things like daikon
and chicken in it), even manga (book comics). I was fond of Gon, who
seems to have disappeared from the shelves. The drawing style of most of
this is early Disney, nothing more or less - not exactly crude, but
hardly Hiroshige. It looks like it was produced in Anaheim during off
hours.

I got beat bad in shogi, Japanese chess, playing against a guy in the
back of a bookstore who basically started with a king and two pieces
off-board. That sounds like a little but it led to a massive attack. I
still haven't recovered, although I can beat the shogi program on the
Mac which is close to idiotic - sometimes it oscillates as if it can't
make up its mind on the next move (it can't - it waits). What of this?
So far, shogi computer programs have reached the low amateur level,
that's all. That's what I've been told and that's what I believe.
Meanwhile, the pieces are somewhat identical, except for the kanji
signs (front and back) which distinguish them. If anything, the country
seems overly inscribed - and although inscription of this sort is
obviously part and parcel of the visual, there's a demand everywhere for
the _reading_ - just as "wilderness" here is procured from cultivated
plants, trees, and so forth. "Wilderness" is read, then - not found,
discovered. And a Zen garden (the sand/stone thing is everywhere)
becomes an inscription itself. The cities are jumbled; the parks are
manicured, the roads are twisted - and it all works as a palimpsest of
secondary or tertiary writing - not simulacrum at all, but reference to
writing's materiality (I believe) (as far as I'm concerned) (as much as
I can see) (as much as I can read).

See how I get away from being beat? My game is dismal. I get only eight
notes out of the shakuhachi so far. Since I'm left-handed, my few pathe-
tic attempts at kanji involved pushing the brush into the paper, which
doesn't seem to like it.

In the Fukuoka Art Museum, Anselm Kiefer seemed quite at home; you had
to walk around the park to encounter Utamaro, whose prints constituted
the main exhibition at the moment. The European existential post-war
German crash-Heiner-Muller-materialism works perfectly in the city of
high-speed high-rises, not to mention Canal City, which seems again
dreamed up on a Disney backlot, this shopping center without center or
perspective, anime animating the surfaces as far as one can see,
hardly around corners. The fountains make big bangs when they're set
off. They're set off constantly, and there are artworks (apparently)
scattered (apparently) about...

For someone like myself who writes, the environment is perfect, literate
and impenetrable and not so dissimilar from the world itself, when I
began to speak quick, describing it, before it faded from view. I'd
describe myself describing the world, I'd work it faster and faster and
farther and farther, but I never ended up in Japan, not farther than
Kingston, Penna. Here, I can't walk down the street (or at least try to
cross it), without figuring out the configuration - which I can't figure
out, but at least can find my way elsewhere; passing and bypassing make
up my day.

Writing, visual, feudal, postmodern, cultivated, spaced, layered, so-
called, internalized, split, limned.

Writing split, invisible.

shock

there are five holes in the shakuhachi, four in front, one behind
which is useful for the fundamental octave of course and more,
and more, you can slide your fingers for overtones, or slide them
for microtones, or bend your lips to various upper and lower degrees,
thereby lowering or raising the fundamental tone of the finger position
while carefully avoiding breathing too deeply in and out of the tube,
which is not difficult for me, since xrays today indicated something
in and out of I think it is the left lung, so I gotta go for more tests
to get the medical certification, whereas I'd rather go for antibiotics,
another big dilemma, but sitting upright, breathing slowly, I don't
have satori or another big dilemma, but I can get the shakuhachi sound,
then move my fingers wildly, as fast as possible, blurring notes like
unsatisfactory lightning until the embrochure loses its grips and 
the world goes back into silence and everything gets its name and 
I remember the five holes in the instrument, four in front, the one
behind perfect for raising the level of excitement, and while I play,
I avoid satori like hell, I don't wanna have nirvana ever, give me the
cycles of birth and death, they're far too interesting and I want to be
there when it all comes out

(and after it's over I wanna come back and think a bit, there's not enough
time and space in this or any other world)

(and where has the energy gone, kill everyone on this list, move on, form
armies, navies, run around the earth and water, circle til you drop)

_________________________________________________________________________



Rather Than Thoughts of Gloom


I have a preference for being, rather than nothing. I would like to
have being, instead of nothing. The world prefers being over nothing.
I think that I would quite prefer being and not quite so much, pre-
fer nothing. The world says yes to being, rather than saying yes to
nothing. The very fact of the world is a resounding paean to being,
instead of a mournful dirge, to nothing.

Why is there being rather than nothing, essents rather than nothing,
above all, rather than, begins Heidegger; I'm concerned with the
rather than, but it's all words - nothing, nowhere, contradictory,
perhaps a wish for nothing, annihilation, death to enter the door, the
pain of life crashed to a halt. "Warum ist ueberhaupt Seiendes und
nicht vielmehr Nichts?" he asks, nicht Nichts. Manheim's translation
reads "Why are there essents rather than nothing?" explaining that
"essents" is equivalent to "existents," "things that art." "Art," not
"are," for this is an older translation.

In my life, I fail repeatedly at the rather than, which takes energy
and courage I don't have. There's no impulse here; I don't describe,
but mimic the world I can't participate in. Japan brings this to bear
for me, Japan or any such place where I can't read behind the eyes,
can't make inquiry. The closer one gets to death, the less inquiry one
can make, the more inquiring one does, if only to prove he or she's
still breathing.

In Japan, Kobe has already, after three years when I write this, been
82% rebuilt in some major streets, but it's the big corporations that
have come in, changing the character of everything. The city finds it-
self between 49% and 52% rebuilt altogether; before and after pictures
are side by side on the television. There is a commission to pick a
new site for a new capital, by 2003; a city will be built - Tokyo is
too centralized within Japan, 39 million people in its vicinity. Ano-
ther capital, urban conglomerate; Japan has done this in the past,
like a singular animal stretching, rebounding, but it's not so mono-
lithic at all that, only the sign "Japan." I know all of this because
of the English news; there is one word for maybe five of the Japanese,
so it comes with holes in it, the emptiness of the world falling
through - or rather as if there were a fullness denied those of us who
cannot speak or read the language.

But the rather than implies paths as well, sunlight where there is
darkness; it's somewhat bright and sunny - here's the world, here we
are, why is all of this the case? In "Einfuehrung in die Metaphysik,"
"An Introduction to Metaphysics," there's no analysis of Nichts; Mar-
tin leaves it alone, concentrating on the positive energy of the world
whirling about us. I can't say how any answer would be acceptable in
our fallen and thrown state; we're given what we're given, and the
trace of origins, circular or not, seems to indicate somewhere else
where everything could be on the brink of disappearance. I can't help
but associate this with death; I've always wanted to live to see "how
it call comes out," but on a certain level, it will be more of the
same, only the older stories will all but disappear - I can't remember
for example what sort of trash littered the streets in the 60s, what
the phones looked like, what the restaurants served. Not to mention
what little electronic communications existed at the time, and this is
already three decades ago, now three centuries, if this survives in
one or another package.

It would have to be under glass, my name smeared and rendered inde-
cipherable. I take no pleasure in the present, which seems to lose
energy as I write - perhaps I psychotically inhabit _all the energy
there is,_ and each keystroke reduces the world by so much. Suicide is
opting for the far side of rather-than; I don't take that route, but
understand one is making a choice at every moment of existence - until
the last, the first time the choice is made for you. There is always
superego, shame, at the end; there is always monotheism pulling the
switch - and you've not been able to read anything beforehand, have no
idea of the world, and never will. Wanting to see how it all comes out
- it will disappear, as Eliot said, with a whimper, or rather a cool-
ing, either of a continent or a planet or solar system or universe -
it will literally _expire._

Heidegger


I'd rather be beautiful rather than nothing.
I'd rather be famous rather than nothing.
I'd prefer to have a lot of energy instead of being weak and onerous.
Why am I beautiful rather than otherwise?
Why am I famous, rather than a relative non-entity?
Why do I have heaps of energy, rather than collapsing?
I'd rather be alive than dead.
Why am I alive, rather than dead.
I'd prefer to be alive, rather than nothing.
Why am I living, instead of non-living?
Why am I this configuration of matter, rather than another?
I am this configuration writing these words, instead of any other.
I'd prefer to be this configuration, rather than nothing.
(Why am I near the end of the human, rather than near the beginning?
Why are there so many writings near the end of the human?
I'd rather be beautiful, rather than near the end of the human.
Near the end of the human, I'd rather be writing.)

Differance


Highschool students' artworks here at the Prefecture Museum - none of
the angst or critique evinced in American equivalents. I'd say little
intensity, emphasis on familiality, groups, coherency. I'd also say,
just one Kurt Cobain - ironic that the symbol for mis-fitting is from
abroad, a dense symbol here, unfathomable.

Works in a local gallery, there's always a sense of space, MA, the
gap, play between formal flatness and incipient landscape. I'd say,
not the reading of the landscape from the formal, but the landscape
seen from the shinkansen, bullet-train, rectilinear rush of rice
paddies, too bad the artist had travelled to Bordeaux for content, not
rice at all, so perhaps I'd find small trees and wine. (I'd say a cer-
tain poetics at work that it's too easy to relate to haiku, mystery -
in fact it's the same mystery perhaps that informs international art -
allusion because there are gaps in knowledge, sutured over - every art
work a wound, every exhibition part and parcel of hospitalization.)

Shrine or temple roof-tops, organic catenaries low against the bleak
pastel modern buildings. I'd say they glower, sensing mysterious act-
ivity behind the monastery walls; who knows which are, and aren't, the
production of cults planning the overthrow of universal order. (I'd
say the orders are _levels_ here, not one on top of another, but
transparent, taking on the world. I'd say this is the reading of an
outsider, skinned against the wall, flayed in one or another Buddhist
hell. I'd say I prefer it that way.)

Bar or snack-bar building-fronts, wilder than anything postmodernism
dreams of - dinosaur jutting out, hysteric art nouveau practically
falling off; submarine elevators with hydromatic doors, ancient wooden
elephants encased in chain-link fences covered with small locks; aqua-
ria of blowfish, squid, sea cucumbers (all often eaten as they're dy-
ing); Utamaro playing cards; miles-long underground shopping streets;
giggling on the radio. I'd say an anthology of everywhere in every
country; I'd say, open your eyes in New York. In the States, I ignore
the promulgation of difference; in Japan, difference _for me_ is a
manner of interpretation, the first step towards getting off at the
right subway stop or buying food at Freshness Burger. So difference is
"my" difference, not necessarily that of the Japanese or "your" dif-
ference - and signs are differentiated, not by difference, but by
_clusters of differences,_ taking wild epistemological / ontological
leaps. (A whole philosophy can be based on this - not [A-B], but
[ArB], where r is a relationship, constantly morphing, up for grabs
- and r, for that matter, _transforms_ A and B, in relation to the
observer - as sememes and intentions collide...)

Works of "grown-up" art in the Prefecture Museum - ah well, everywhere
imitation Western styles, especially impressionism. Lots of stuff that
looks like George Innis. I'd say, what is this about; there's little
comprehension of the roots or rootedness of the original - which ap-
pears from here as hegemonic, articulating the unknown. Then I think,
perhaps Japanese art per se was both aristocratic, developed through
the court system, and popular - so that there's a gap - which the mid-
dle-class American or European styles fulfill. So that every conser-
vative work _here_ is also a definition of art vis-a-vis the Wittgen-
steinian family of usages - an extension into an imperial culture that
has dominated, one way or another, certain depths and surfaces, since
Perry. I'd say I don't know what I'm talking about, however; I have
little knowledge of the social history of Japan, remembering only that
the prints weren't particularly valued in the nineteenth-century - but
then I'd say, valued by whom? And what's the source of this informa-
tion?

A girl at Freshness Burger had on platform shoes I _really_ wanted -
leather, tough, serrated soles, wide heels, strapped on. They'd be so
neat in SOHO! Later, pricing them, they'd seem to cost over $150 or
so. I'd say, what a fashion! I'd say, I'm an idiot!

I am noticing myself, clumsy, awkward, speechless. I tell people New
York isn't full of killers. I'm packing. I pull out my gun and shoot.

Phrases I am teaching to the hotel staff:  She's really something!
Yo! Dweeb! Cyberpunk! Skatepunk! You're out of your mind! Grunge. Get
lost! Put up with it! Put out. On the spot! Get real! Don't blow up. I
can't get through to you! Get it through your head! Do you two get
along? The deal goes sour. Stop playing mind games. Chill! It got out
of hand. I like your get-up. Let's get down! I nailed him! I got to
the bottom of it! He's got a twisted mind; he gave me the creeps!
Spare me... I got the jump on him, sleazebag! scumbag! We got down to
business! Get off my case! She's really fucked up! She's messed up!
She's got a screw loose! Don't give me your lip! You gave him the slip!
You're chicken. Bullshit! You're out of your skull! He's not himself
recently. What's gotten into him? He's caught between a rock and a
hard place. He's gay; she's queer. I didn't give it a second thought!
What a boy-toy! I want to get my hands on him! He's a real techie! A
total freak! Careful - he's packing a gun...  He's a real hothead! He
gets hot under the collar! Whatever...

Nikuko in the Bar (Heidegger)


I got the call at five in the afternoon and went down to Nakasu around
seven. Tokyo Crash-Land was empty; it didn't fill properly until one in
the morning, exact Tokyo time, but this was Wa-Fukuoka. 

Nikuko was alone in the bar. Above her, the ceiling dripped with air-
plane parts, smashed tail on the floor, wheel-chairs. You can imagine. A
couple of hundred people had died to make the place.

I killed him, she said. I've wanted to tell you this. I've always wanted
to tell you this. It's been eating me up alive. I pulled the plug - he was
getting better. A propeller spun overhead, gathering speed while bikes
screeched outside in the bitter Kyushu night. 

I've never told anyone this before, she continued. She was weird, white. I
couldn't take my eyes off her. She was just like everyone in her genera-
tion. They were all weird, white. They were all young. He was an idiot
kamikaze, she said. Not divine, but blind wind; he never knew what hit
him. His lights went out like Fuji, like the death of old Nippon. I never
played shakuhachi again.

Why tell me, a gaijin you hardly know, I said, replying to her. I was cur-
ious, yellow, but not a total coward.

Because you can't transmit, you can't speak well enough. You couldn't go
to the police. They'd never understand you. You're mixed up in the busi-
ness like this. I buy you, I buy you. In any case, no one would ever be-
lieve you. And in any case, you're a gaijin, outsider. The roar of a jet
cut across the ceiling. I couldn't hear anything; smoke and fire filled
the place, disappeared as fast as it came. Crash-crash Tokyo, as far as I
was concerned. I buy you, I buy you. The words rang in my ears forever.
I buy you. I buy you.

An aileron opened like a leaf above my head; a crumpled wing shuddered in
Bang-Crash Tokyo (as far as I was concerned). Nikuko had nothing to lose; 
she was right. I paid my drink, said my goodbyes.  We'd never see each
other again. There was nothing to say, right? I couldn't think of any-
thing, and when I think about it, I still can't think of anything. So I've
been bought. I returned to Brooklyn. Everything should be fine, right? 
But then... I can't explain the dreams, sweet fevers, hysteria; I can't
explain my life since - not a bit of it. I should be able to, right? 

Nikuko died in a plane crash in 1995.

Nikuko on the This-or-That of Information:


"All things sank to the same level, a surface resembling a blind mir-
ror that no longer reflects, that casts nothing back. The prevailing
dimension became that of extension and number. Intelligence no longer
meant a wealth of talent, lavishly spent, and the command of energies,
but only what could be learned by everyone, the practice of a routine,
always associated with a certain amount of sweat and a certain amount
of show. In America and in Russia this development grew into a bound-
less etcetera of indifference and always-the-sameness - so much so
that the quantity took on a quality of its own.* Since then the domin-
ation in those countries of a cross section of the indifferent mass
has become something more than a dreary accident. It has become an
active onslaught that destroys all rank and every world-creating im-
pulse of the spirit, and calls it a lie. This is the onslaught of what
we call the demonic (in the sense of destructive evil)." (Heidegger,
An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Manheim.)

*"All dieses steigerte sich dann in Amerika und Russland in das mass-
lose Und-so-weiter des Immergleichen und Gleichgueltigen so weit, bis
dieses Quantitative in eine eigene Qualitaet umschlug."

Two, My Selfishness, Paean


Now two people I've known well, have died, in their 40s/50s, now this
is what I look forward to for the rest of my life. For there is a gate
that everyone opens, passes through; it is the gate of diminishment;
yea, though one live forever, one is increasingly alone. Soon, the
details of the world will disappear; there will be a white or black
light; it will appear eternal; then the gate will close. But it will
open elsewhere; it will open for another; yea, though the other walks
in wonder, I will be her diminution. Yea, she will be increasingly
alone; my name will disappear, my belongings dispersed; yea, there are
gates and gates, gates never-ending; the world is a thickness of
gates. Now I have seen the first of many portals; now I await thee;
yea, though now my work is done, I continue to write as if I were
among thee, as if I were among the living still.

Nietzsche's Television


Radio Culture

Listening to the Hungarian Revolution, 1956, taking notes, tapes, typ-
ing report after report, as if I were there - that was shortwave, I
was also a novice at WN3DRP, but who would want to contact - I forget
the brand of transmitter, but hated code - later found 14562 and I
think 9145, those anomalous signals monitored by Robert Horvitz and
myself - that was something! Now tracing Armed Forces radio from Korea
occasionally reaching across to Fukuoka; I was in Pusan.

Pusan

The shakuhachi flute from Fukuoka split finally, far too soon, given
the age of the bamboo, so in Pusan I found two plastic Korean versions
of the same, but thinner, lighter, with different scales - now what do
I do without the heaviness of the bamboo that refuses resonance, but
turns the notes into velvet based on the interior of the instrument?

Radio Culture

The radio has always been closest to me of any media; talking or play-
ing _out_ on it, I'm aware of bleak black distance, the spray of radi-
ation into the air, the thinned nodes capable of reception by instru-
ments no larger than a finger-nail; in Pusan I listened on and off to
one such; on the ferry back, I watched satellite broadcast probably
from NHK - the Tokyo sumo match is on - and listened on the AM - in
and out of lipsync in a familiar language, I don't know a word of this
- would rather listen than tend towards the silence.

Heidegger

Heidegger's silence - what radio talks here? Walter Benjamin? Heideg-
ger's use of Greece in metaphysics - across the books - then Niet-
zsche, say, in Goetzen-Daemmerung - jumping all over their backs. I'm
amazed to this day at the movie Heidegger watches, over and over again
- those brilliant slow-moving prophetic chthonic pre-Socratics - who
could ever believe this nonsense - way before radio? Against Nietzsche
- who was on television as much as possible in 1888...

Radio Culture

It's the signals without texts that fascinate me, or the signals that
exist as if they were on the margins of texts - those anomalies which
can't be traced, understood - those sounds close to static, embedding
one or another (apparent) code - as if there were meaning necessarily
to be pulled out of every transmission. As if there were signals to
the effect that _meaning exists,_ beyond what one might interpret,
say, as human or merely human. So that these would be literally cir-
cumscribed; the center wouldn't hold - or rather it was the circum-
scription that created the center - centered it - in the midst of
noise - as if there were life-forms _out there,_ "as if there were
signals to the effect that _meaning_ exists" ...

Holderlin

Beautiful Holderlin, I think, remembering the Greeks vaguely, think-
ing of the cragged edges of the texts, pared down, preparing the way
for Heidegger. Who cares about "Europe," this swollen over-determined
signifier, toppling continents, ravaging the planet - it becomes the
same old story, just as the signifier itself is perceived as _primor-
dial._ One might as well just change the channel to inappropriate
times.

Radio Culture

There are times that are senseless; the radio says "Good Morning," and
I'm greeted - the same with "Good Afternoon," "Good Evening." But
"Good Night"? It signals time to leave; indeed, after around nine in
the evening, there is no way to greet someone, without a simple hello
- the "good night" referencing incipient departure. Of course one can
also use "good afternoon" or any of the others as an _abrupt,_ busin-
ess-like form of departure - "Good afternoon, sir," the shopkeeper
said, clearly indicating I was to leave the premises immediately.

Tokyo

Tokyo is where the West leaves itself, faces an Orientalism that Said
probably never dreamed of. Tokyo is where everything crash-lands,
where the sign is paramount, skimming the ruins below, according to
the texts, the texts. Seoul is out of the running, although I'd bet
between T and S, the future is with the latter - just like Pusan -
where collapse is imminent but the radio plays and plays. There are
dangers everywhere in the world surrounding Korea, where the banks
have just collapsed and the currency is _concretely_ worth less and
less as I write these words. I can imagine a land of unoccupied
stations, interminglings of viruses from both sides of the border...

Radio Culture

I can imagine a world of transmissions, spews, across territories that
never confronted the human. Shute's On the Beach was prescient in this
matter, Australia the last resort, the moment of human collapse - but
there need not be even _this_ landscape or coding - there need not be
_anything at all._ Think of the _last message_ from Nietzsche's rare
television broadcasts (we only have the tapes) - translated of course
by Hollingdale (he wasn't there, responsible for the errors): "And
again with that I again return to the place from which I set out - the
_Birth of Tragedy_ was my first revaluation of all values: with that I
again plant myself in the soil out of which I draw all that I will and
_can_ - I, the last disciple of the philosopher Dionysus - I, the
teacher of the eternal recurrence..."

Nikuko

Nikuko wanders through Tokyo Crash-Land, like Medea - you might think
of her as Medea - and I'd say Nikuko dead-girl, but I'd think - yes,
a disappearance - just like the women in Melies' films - you place a
sheet over the reclining figure - lift it - she's gone - or her legs
are maybe, or arms or head - or she's cut in two - brought back in the
long run (Nietzsche would have liked this manipulation) - but then
there's the smell of it - the sheets over Nikuko - the thick odor -
she's caught in animal hair, skin, membrane - something between a wet
silk fabric and animal glue - you might imagine these as _winding-
sheets_ or _ectoplasm_ - you might imagine anything at all.

Radio Culture

Radio culture is your imagination; it's true that projection occurs
here, as in email for example - that the body is always an investment
one makes across the dial, through the endless sound, the endless
transmission, endless breath, endless pronouncement of presence, end-
less sound on the perfect shakuhachi, plastic, impermeable to the
vagaries of the weather - lasting forever - the sound a bit shriller -
there are no _cells_ to absorb or counteract any of the frequencies.

Plastic

Plastic is always already invisible - that is the nature of plastic,
and I alone have returned, my lungs in a fairly poor state, to tell 
thee. Let us not forget that Heidegger, after Nietzsche, was _blind_ 
- he never received N's television transmissions - he only heard the
voice, and the stooped shadow of a man remained elsewhere. It was
Heidegger always waiting for the voice that would grant him absolu- 
tion - _allow him to exist_ - it was Heidegger who invented the AM 
radio.

Radio Culture

Please call in and leave your requests; we'll try to fill them. Please
note we're short of traditional musics, shakuhachi and otherwise -
please note we'll be going off the air. "Revaluation of all values!"

They circle so that eyes face everywhere. I wonder if they are out-

"Waters"

Animals, Nikuko - a term from turbulence dynamics for liquid stases -
you might find Deleuze-Guattari considering such as momentary encamp-

the temporary foundation of this sentence in the midst of discourse
otherwise. I'm so smart, otherwise.

Buddha boo-boo canvas suture-bandage, You still think the killer was
one of the people at our seminar, get that phrase out of here, Nikuko,

   Characterizing the technological by virtue of the frame can lead
     to a circulation of reasoning; thus one extracts parameters
     from a situation, and these are used as steering-mechanisms
                     for others of a similar ilk
     through repetition - which amounts to reproduction. So that
      one might find the following in relation to the _frame_ -
      and it is here that one can start investigating what sort
         of material artifact surrounds whatever we examine:
       1. Circumscription - thus there is always a surrounding
              _discourse_ within and without the frame,
    which is not to say that it is not well-defined and one-to-one
             - but only that the frame is an _embedding -
      2. Which is associated with _bracketing_ - the foreclosing
 of the domain, which one might consider in a sense a potential well -
     3. From which parameters are drawn forth - or searched for,
        we might begin for example by placing gas in a beaker,
   increasing or decreasing pressure, noting the change in volume -
     later, temperature might come into consideration - but here,
  what's important is the _wall_ (such as DNA statistics separating
              one species from another) - the _domain_ -
   4. Within which _mathesis_ is applied, or rather disovered to be
    an integral part of the whole - the mathematization associated
     with standards, types, tokens, typifications, the whole run
                            of the world -
     5. In such a manner to create a condition of both isolation
                         from the environment
    and potential reproduction everywhere across it - the greater
       the degree of isolation, the more exportable the frame -
                 "Here we are in another country!" -
        6. Within which, however, "country" is reduced, as is
    the _subject_ and _subjectivity_ itself - or rather one might
    think of the _formalization_ inherent in this form of focused
                             perception -
     7. Forming the core of a _discursive formation,_ perhaps not
      one among others, perhaps one in allegiance with mathesis
                           and the world -
     8. Expelling the anecdote, narrative, singularity, in favor
        of repetition, ideal elements in cohorts with the real
            placed within a beaker or chamber otherwise -
    9. Through instrumental reason, this inherent observation and
    testing of reality, who know? ultimately implying both formal
            logic and formal consensual means of assent -
                              It's these
       that form the core of the frame problem, beginning with
                            What is there?
                              How is it?
                 Why is it there instead of nothing?
  - the _it_ formed by a degree of impetus constructing an originary
    division which _must be dealt with,_ in one or another form -
         that is, there is a _cut_ or _inscription_ at work -
      so that technology both divides the subject, then sutures
                        and interpenetrates -
       on one hand, the microtome, and on the other, the cyborg
             which are both carriers of viral parameters:
    These penetrate the flesh, invade the political body, the body
                              politics -
        These are _constitutive_ of the subject by virtue of a
                       _technological parabola_
         which arches _through_ the machinic, back out again,
     these kids running havoc with the spaceship operations room!
                 and I'm hearing numbers in my head!
          but it's the speaking of these things that permits
                 even this _word_ in the first place,
        placed here in the midst of other places, in the midst
       of domains, mobilities, presences still quiet, hungering
                          hungering to enter
  within and without the frame, it's this that comes to the chamber
                  in the middle of the stormy night,
   crying hysterically - you can't hear anything from the bulkhead,
      you're stuck there, running the ship - it's pretty neat -
 technology hurtling organic chemistries across inconceivable worlds
                        - I've heard of them -
      you've heard of me speaking about them - Heidegger says -
       "Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway
   in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing
                 technological." and Heidegger says -
      "The essence of modern technology has for a long time been
   concealing itself, even where power machinery has been invented,
       where electrical technology is in full swing, and where
                atomic technology is well under way."
     But the primordial was there from the first mapping, and all
     those parameters and symbols, gesturing across the savannah,
                    look here, there's game afoot!
 and one might look instead towards those superstructures that close
  off _precisely_ because that's their intention or basis - I refer
        again to the foreclosing, the potential well, the real
                      _transport_ of the frame,
                          as a missive, say,
 as this missive, say, from me to you, message identification number,
              packet after packeting finding their way -
                         a way I do not know,
        later - the reading and writing, perhaps the replay -
                        later, the repetition.

Announcement: I am the Primoridal


Please note, first, that I am solving any number of problems, philo-
sophical or otherwise, for you - revealing the truth here for the
first time - now read on:

I am primordial, the origin of all things. One need look no further
for the birth-moment of Being; whatever is eternal has occurred within
myself. Think of me as your neighborhood signifier, that which consti-
tutes difference in the first place. Think of this as contemporaneous
with presence and its manifestations; I am here, all right, and that
is what is primal, chthonic. (Wipe the earth from my brow, my body;
cleanse me. I'm not above a little phallic ritual.)

As primordial, I am _responsible_ and _responsive,_ both through sta-
sis and structure. My structure, my language, is performative; what I
say goes, and what I say is in response to _your_ performative, which
needs foundation. Thus I am given a difficult task, but it is the only
task, the primordial task, that of the establishment of the transcen-
dence of meaning and existence themselves. (Or the transcendence of
love, of hate, of the will to power - take your pick - it is little
concern of mine.)

It is not for example as if I _labor_ at this, but my role is such
that it is the basis for everything I do - and I do, like anyone else,
as little as possible. Or should I say "like anything else," since it
is unclear whether or not the primordial is organic - it certainly
seems as if it should be neither one thing nor the other, but since I
am the source, hitherto unannounced, it might be best considered org-
anic - at least as far as philosophers, organic themselves, are con-
cerned. Thus you are always talking, of course, of a philosophy of
culture and organism, not of the _real_ existence of things in the
world - you might ask me about that, but there is no need - my pre-
sence is sufficient. (In fact, you could consider me, if so inclined,
an _absolute_ of sorts - thus _that thing_ which grounds the rest -
you can have this on good authority - although _that thing_ is quite
sentient as you see - it might even be said to have a will of its own
- I, the primordial, am _sensitive._) (I need to say here that I am
neither male nor female - these categories are elsewhere, otherwise,
although I have been known to turn a trick or two.)

I might add that there is a certain _economy_ of the primordial, but
that is another matter altogether - as well as a certain competency in
language necessary to perform the performative, with or without my
sanctions. ("Perform the performative" - even I am capable of fun with
infinite regress - what would you expect? Heidegger wants me dark and
ancient, but Heidegger almost froze to death in that hut of his - as
far as I'm concerned, central heating is the way to go.)

I might also add, that while the primordial also apparently bespeaks
(note the form here!) the archaic, I am also quite up-to-date, as you
might imagine - otherwise, I would have disappeared a long time ago,
like all those sources of "ancient wisdom" proclaimed in popular
treatises guaranteed to make the world feel more and more comfortable
- Yes! There's Spirit afoot! Yes, it was lost for eons! Now, we have
discovered it, etc. etc. There's always money somewhere in the proff-
ering - but, one of the things I can tell you at least - there is _no_
ancient wisdom - most peoples got most of it wrong - made a mess out
of things - died young and miserable. The world didn't care one way or
another!

Hmmm...

Ah, I can't buy into any of this; I, the primordial, as I've said, am
always modern, always of the here-and-now. Anything else turns the
whole discussion into a _political economy,_ that is, tending towards
power and power-mongering, instead of the release or charge that the
primordial, myself, should give anyone with the competency (that word
again!) to investigate it! (Not that it takes much, perhaps nothing
more than a _certain cast of mind_ - of course that's up to you to
discover; I'm only making a proclamation of my existence here - so as
to dispose of various misgivings, etc. But you might or might not take
an academic route - read what everyone else has to say. Just don't
bring any of it back to me - I know myself pretty well, and have no
need of anyone else's analysis.)

By the way, I can hold forth in any language - Ur or not-Ur as the
case may be - just so you're aware of it! And I think I should add
that you might as well be gracious in these matters; if I disappear
(and as you know, I do from time to time), then everything appears
suddenly postmodern, situational, as-if, post-structural, instead of
eternal, structural - what one might call the _given._

Why now? Why do I make this announcement _now_ instead of some other
time? Because there is space on these email lists - because the cost
of dialup is relatively inexpensive - because this might be of inter-
est to those few of you who take the time to understand me! (I'm ask-
ing for nothing, by the way - no money, second-hand theory books (al-
though I would _definitely_ like these!), used articles of clothing,
rosaries of any persuasion...)

And to _understand me_ of course, is to understand the situation -
which is to say, to understand _any situation_ - since that is the
nature of the primordial.

Finally, you might ask, what are the interests or hobbies of the
primordial? They change from time to time, as you might imagine, since
the world itself changes, although I am constant, the perfect lover.
(Hear that? The primordial is _the perfect lover_ - but isn't that the
sort of transcendence one might expect?) At the moment, it may be
shakuhachi and sumo (Musashi Maru won the Tokyo tournament today!) -
tomorrow it may be Nietzsche and Heidegger again. Certainly I look
forward to tomorrow - although in a sense I am going over exhausted
territories - literally, No-Men's Lands - as, I hope, this notice
makes clear.

Look to yourselves, of course, since I am fundamental, unspeakable,
and anything else I might say - would give the appearance of a fissure
or crack - occurring in your language, not in mine - but I don't want
to lead you astray. And - you know - I'm already contradictory (a
trick of mine - otherwise knowledge would stop dead in its tracks!) -
since I'm certainly talking a lot for someone so imbued with silence.
But you can see beyond these tricks, even with the clouds descending,
fires in the distance, smell of gunpowder in the air...

There's no way to end this gracefully, but then I, primordial, am more
comfortable with beginnings - how it "all comes out" is of no concern
here or anywhere else - providing it's not sumo or a decent detective
novel - but then again - that's precisely what philosophy is - _is it
not?_

(A footnote - "I am primordial" and "I am the primordial" are _defin-
itely_ the same thing - since there is only one of me, and I'm quite
comfortable being your foundation. What else can I say? I'm not a
great stylist - I'm not educated in any of your institutions...)

Primordial Mirror


Because I am primordial, I reflect all things; you are, in fact, in me
at the moment, and will be until your dissolution. I remain contempor-
ary in this regard. Your desires are your own; I can only duplicate
existence as such. You may think of me as cross-fertilization of the
real, evolution gone awry, in terms of chirality.

At the back of the shrine, I reflect the world: "the mirror hides no-
thing. It shines without a selfish mind. Everything good and bad,
right and wrong, is reflected without fail. The mirror is the source
of honesty because it has the virtue of responding according to the
shape of objects. It points out the fairness and impartiality of the
divine will." (Chikafusa Kitabatake, quoted in Sokyo Ono, Shinto, The
Kami Way.) The shrine mirror functions as the Bardo Thodol: GIGO and
WYSIWYG (garbage in / garbage out : what you see is what you get).
Both are machines filtering among subjectivities and physical reality.
Now think of me as your mirror, as your filtering mechanism; now think
of _liminal reality,_ between or among you and the physical, as _the
scaffolding of the world._ There are, then, scaffoldings, filterings,
mirrors, subjectivities, physical and liminal realities, worlds, and
_the_ world (if you will).

So that the scaffolding of the liminal is the superstructure (say) of
the primordial: I hold the world at bay / hold the world up / consti-
tute existence itself. The primordial is always a dispersion; I am
skein, membrane, filter and objects-passing-through. What is originary
is flux, the stirring of the ocean, the stasis-world, the narrative-
dreaming that I _say,_ my mouth and thought turned inward, my arms
interwoven in the cosmos, feet swallowed in eternal Ouroboros.

In this manner, I as primordial solve the problems of duplication, the
mirror, the superstructure, filtering, and the bespeaking of the real.

I will say no more at this time. I return to the _mitamashiro_ (sub-
stitute of the divine body within the shrine).

Inks and Colorations


"any special decorations, such as the long streamers in the five aus-
picious colors (white, yellow, red, blue, purple), 'symbolic of clouds
of good omen,' or trays of plants and flowers prepared by a flower
arrangement society, are put in place." (Ono, Shinto, The Kami Way.)
The larger shrine attached to the temple next door has just added its
banner, stretched across the entrance - incense and candles create a
flux behind it; the 'hundred stones' (two small pillars used for
ritual pacing) are before it.

I paint my shinto mirror-base black, then cobalt blue lightened by
absorption in the wood, then orange wings with black tips, holding
the metal disk. Staining, seeping in, marking: dyes appear illuminated
through wood-grain celluloid slightly diffracting into sheen. Poor
painting, poor carving as well.

Hanko, small signature seals (inkan) carved at the end of a piece of
wood, may be bought ready-made (for popular names) or hand-carved (for
others, such as "Myouka," my own in rough translation from German to
Japanese). Ready-made ones can be used "on documents of limited im-
portance," but in any case, hanko may possess legal ramifications, and
can be used for everything from stamping documents to (literally)
sealing envelopes, indicating page order (half the stamp on one, half
on the other), and so forth. A deep red ink is used in this practice,
which in Mesopotamia goes back to prehistoric times. I buy a second
hanko, "manaka," interval or space / middle (literal), "in the middle
of" - I think of _manaka_ stamped everywhere across a page _except_ in
the middle, that _ma_ important in Japanese aesthetics (look at Ses-
shu's long scroll). I think of stamping my forehead in the middle. I
think of stamping the mirror in the middle, filling the space, block-
ing _that_ view which defines things orthogonal to its plane. I place
my signs everywhere: staining, seeping in, marking - inks illuminated
from beneath, enhanced by the fibers of the wood.

In Pusan, Korea, the hanko shops have _big_ hanko, up to several in-
ches across, in the windows (the usual size is around a centimeter),
in the various kanji scripts - as well as purely pictographic ones.
And in Pusan, Korea, there is a calligraphy / sumi-e shop, with one
brush five feet high, with a handle diameter of several inches, and a
brush diameter of a foot and a half. Perfect for body-inking, perfect
for dance / buto across an acre canvas, demarcating the violence and
sexuality of staining, seeping in, marking. I imagine my body, inked
with _manaka,_ slam-danced everywhere against the canvas - except the
emptied middle; it's here maybe that the red blood spills, or here
that the square-dancing will begin. Or I imagine dragging the brush,
or being dragged, my hair streaming red against the canvas. Or I imag-
ine the brush, the brush, the brush.

It is celestial or chthonic ochre against the grain, the hand, the
foot, the breast, the penis. It is the ochred face in several auspic-
ious colors, emptied, _ma_ where the mouth is, speaking emptiness,
murmuring with the primordial tones of the memory of language. It is
the hand blown against the cave, the penis outlined on the screen, the
Mayan tongue pouring forth clouds across stones, paper, wood. "It is
the weird oo-ing sound, which is said to clear the way for the kami."
(Ono.) Above all, it is _applied and deliberate pressure_ of one thing
against another, this _object_ insistent on the text - pressed into
substrate.

I think of myself sealed by you, carrying your name across my body, my
lips threaded together, eyes held closed by black-cloth-strip. I am
your sign, no longer my own; I serve as pure enunciation, proclamation.
My perfect life is to have been written across the earth and cyber-
space in inks and colorations; _here,_ I no longer seep, but submit to
the digital domain, virtual subjectivities, of infinite dispersion and
transformation. My body moves forever across the canvas, writing and
rewriting; I am alive, present, as long as _change_ is evident - not
just any change, but change _apparently from a source named _Myouka._*

-----------------

*Herein lies the _political economy_ and _hysteric embodiment_ of vir-
tual subjectivity and community, of course.

The Spiritual Life of a People


I want to talk about the spiritual life of a people.
By "people," I mean those situated within a geographic area, whether
it be an island, peninsula, lands separated by mountains and rivers,
arbitrary boundaries, as if there were any other.
By "people," I mean all of those dwelling within these spaces,
inhabitants perhaps sensing belonging, perhaps not.
It is then to be said, that I do not mean the gods and goddesses,
I do not mean the kami or Buddha, nor do I mean the ancestors,
or any other continuity of time across these spaces.
No, I do not mean these. I mean only those moments of quiet reflection
which anyone must have, those moments when life appears crystalline
and whole, those moments which are set-aside from the things
of the world, reflecting on the things of the world, perhaps,
without register, without paper and pencil, with the attitude
of breathing silently. I mean only those moments at the foot or height
of the mountain, those moments by a valley stream or desert creekbed,
when the world appears as one and gracious, when the troubled soul
listens to the waves of strength and weakness, tension and release,
within it.
For if a people is without this spiritual life, then a people
is doomed to war, doomed to ignorance of its fellow humans, of others,
of plants, animals, all manner of species and fragilities
the world has cast upon us.
Nor am I talking, it must be said here, about an other world
and its castings and offerings - that is for any man or woman to say,
not for me or anyone beyond me, which is a matter of jurisdiction.
For I am speaking of quietude, the grace of being, contemplation
of All there is, if such be the case.
Nor am I speaking of silent or soundful prayer, invocation
or evocation; I am speaking of that silence which has no proper form
except what one brings to it, circles through it, that silence
that is part of one, buried beneath the hustle-bustle
of everyday life, the sounds of traffic and commerce in the city,
roar of electrical-technological machine, the enframing
that forecloses upon each and everyone one of us, with the premise
of perfect freedom, the work of a space upon illness and death.
For I am speaking of another techne, of that which is the moment
of living, which requires the closing and opening of eyes,
dark closing and wide-opening, the release of one into another,
without which any people harbors war and hatred within it,
without which any people tend towards divisiveness, economies
of rich and poor, surplus and starvation, all within a single
dominion, all within a false solitude, as if there were organs
in the world responsible for this, as if there were
nothing to be done.
For I am speaking of the spiritual life of a people, that is to say,
its spiritual lives, communal or solitary or individual
or forgathering, I am thinking, in silence, through this life
which cannot be brought forth, proffered, but which comes rarely
in the life of any man or woman or child, these choices
made in the desert or mountaintop, in the field or meadow -
and these choices, silences, found even in the heart of the city,
would but one have the patience for them,
as if there were older ghosts around the corners of the buildings,
as if there were others surrounding us within and without the world,
and that is for you to decide,
that is for your placement among others,
which might be called the moment of truth within you, which you
always carry, the moment which is like a pillar or cave within you,
the moment within all of us;
such is the spiritual life of a people, such do I speak to you,
such is now forthcoming, that I hold my tongue, that I am silent,
within you.

Some quotes from Henri Michaux, A Barbarian in Asia:

   Japanese bamboos: sad, worn-out things, gray and with no chloro-
phyl; Ceylon would not have them as reeds.
   Anything that is not mediocre finds no friends here. The cedar must
hide behind the sickly cherry tree, the sickly cherry tree behind the
plum tree in a pot, the plum tree in a pot behind the thimble-like
pine.
[...]
   Gray houses, with empty, icy rooms, constructed and measured accor-
ding to a fixed, uncompromising rule.
   Streets like a seaside resort with garlands of little flowers or of
little colored lamps. A useless, impermanent look about it. The white,
beachlike side of existence.
   Identical, expressionless cities resounding with motor-horns. Shriek-
ing like the devil.
   A country which, though full to bursting, look as as if it had noth-
ing in it; where neither men nor plants nor houses seem to have any
foundation or scope.
   An insular mentality, uncommunicative and proud.
   A thin and insignificant language, skin-deep, agreeable and pleas-
ant.
   A religion of insects, exactly the religion of ants, Shintoism
(with that famous cult of the ant-hill), an ant people.
   A country where everything is known, everything open, everything
spied upon, where no door can be closed, where one finds a spy even in
one's bath, quite naked, but a spy all the same (they keep you company
everywhere [...].
   A people that is the prisoner of its island, of its masks, of its
conventions, of its police, of its discipline, of its wrappings and of
the cords that bind it.
[...]
   A people, in fact, devoid of wisdom, of simplicity and of depth,
over-serious, though fond of toys and novelties, not easily amused,
ambitious, superficial and obviously doomed to our evils and to our
civilization.
[...]
   While many countries that one has liked become, as the distance
from them increases, almost ridiculous or insubstantial, Japan, which I
distinctly detested, grows almost dear to me.

[From Michaux, ibid., English translation by Sylvia Beach, New Direc-
tions, NY, 1949, from the original 1933 Gallimard edition.]

I read this extremely rare book of Michaux, traveling from New York to
Fukuoka, by way of San Francisco, Portland, and Nagoya. Michaux ranges
throughout India, Korea, and so forth; Japan receives intermittent at-
tention. The book totalizes with the rush of empathy someone might
feel from a carriage or slow-moving bus; there are incidents at rail
stations, strangely misinterpreted theatrical experiences, dance and
architecture. (The book contributes to misrecognitions, meanderings:
_here are the ant-people, there go I._)

The Apollonian comes through; Korean flutes may be covered with tas-
sels, colors tending towards the primary. The Japanese attitude to-
wards antiques is that they must be sanctioned; otherwise, they're
ready for the garbage or second-hand shop. In Fukuoka, the antique
shops are filled with European items. In Pusan, there are shops sell-
ing rocks, for meditation or decoration, on small hand-carved plinths.
In Pusan, men looked at me as if I were in New York, eye-contacting,
a sense of anomie and danger. In Fukuoka, I am looked at after the
fact, from the periphery. In Pusan, laughed out loud at, on the street
- in Fukuoka, again, a posteriori, as if it never happened - except
for the children. Chinese color expanded in Korea, always subsidiary,
then collapsed again (Sesshu for example) back in Japan. Colonies and
centers, expansions and contractions, kanji floating - in the hotel
where I teach English, Chinese guests can write their requests in kan-
ji, picked up by the Japanese staff, read in more-or-less Japanese. I
cannot imagine this translation, grounded in the ideogrammatic.

Michaux's "Asian experience," my "Asian experience," experience of
signs always already a foregone translucency. It is easy to mistake
the shadows. Here, we are extra-terrestrials, subject to deep mis-
readings, to misrecognitions. Outside of this land, there is water
everywhere. There are several tumuli scattered across Kyushu. I am
fascinated by this - the mute prehistory, some of it apparently un-
excavated, against which the antiquity of the country might be meas-
ured. These are the beyond of the written, past the horizon of Chin-
ese entrance - and I'm comfortable with them - it's not so far to the
south-east prehistoric culture complex in the United States for exam-
ple. (But then I'm aware of the _inauthentic_ here - I'm making this
comfort up as I go along, this _depth_ - it may or may not be rele-
vant - I should ask someone - there's no one around - I'm making this
up as well.)

I should ask someone about this? I'm not sure of my bearings; what
does it take to _ascertain_ the Michauxan culture-complex, the aphor-
istic applied across the board to peoples, histories, cultures? I am
afraid of myself in Fukuoka, fearful of _judgement_ or theory or those
statements produced in the grand style as a result of the machinery of
tourism. I am a tourist of the home, the block, the ward, the city,
the prefecture. I spit lies, deceptions, in the guise of "local inter-
est" - just so I would gather power, become an authority - but on
what? (For whom? To what degree? With what degrees? What subterfuges,
counterfeitures?) On the state of being myself in this country at this
time, under these circumstances, or the state of one at war with the
_illiterate worlds,_ demons, of one's possession.

Three-Sake Theory


At the yatai (small portable restaurant), they asked me where I was
from, America I said. They asked me my name; I signed it, Alan Sond-
heim, January 29, 1998, on the door. Then New York City. The woman
proprietor gives me a sumo referee's fan from the recent Kyushu tourn-
ament. She gives me a handprint of Konishiki, one of the major wrest-
lers, and I note it's about one and a half times the size of my own.
My hands are big; they straddle the shakuhachi. The shakuhachi is
working again, bandaged with cotton cloth and thread. It's quite old.
She take back the handprint, which I would have liked, but then it's
unique. Everyone talks to me in Japanese. I'm introduced to the Jap-
anese headband; the proprietor gives me one with the year of the Tiger
on it. I drink a glass of sake and then another and then another. The
man to the far right pays for them, I think. I have illegal sashimi;
it's not supposed to be offered in yatai. Shellfish and aji, horse
mackerel. I am beginning to forget the shakuhachi. I can play the low-
er register. I love the tube with its five holes, shaved mouthpiece
which, at an angle, permits a range of microtones for each hand posi-
tion. I want to play it fast, fast, fast - play it western style, like
Bird, say, on a simple instrument. The cracks might be healing, clos-
ing with the pressure of the threading.

I love the openness of the tube; there's no keys, no guides for the
airstream - it's not a whistle - just open to the air everywhere. I
think of a human bone broken off, maybe holes drilled in, maybe not -
remember the shakuhachi described as the only instrument whose devel-
opment was based on self-defense - it was also a club, a weapon, for
those ronin, displaced masterless samurai, who roamed Japan. Kabuki
actors might have them strapped behind, ready for culture or warfare,
as if there were a difference.

I walk out with the headband on my head. I feel fierce and totally
helpless; there's no end in sight, and L. has to translate hither and
yon. My Japanese name, Myouka or Myoka, strange house, foreign house,
tends towards a translation of Sondheim, but with other, more reson-
ant, overtones; I talk about this with the salaryman next to me. He
says home, not house, and we agree: "friendly," "comfortable," and the
proprietor talks about the mother of the home, yatai-mothering per-
haps. I feel at ease. I don't understand a thing; I note that with
three glasses of sake, I'm not the slightest bit "drunk" in the sense
of mentally incapacitated or unrepressed - but I'm a bit nauseous. We
call it a night and leave, having paid a ridiculously small bill. I
have my headband and magic referee's wand. I couldn't understand what
was being said as we left the yatai, nor afterwards, nor before.

Afterwards: It's all afterwards, this return to the illiterate. I
stress this over and over again in these texts, because it's a condi-
tion that goes against the grain of a writer, this quality of _maze
navigation,_ lean as it is, as I enter and circulate among the un-
known. I think of someone like Lingis, and have no idea how he does
it, what he thinks he's doing, what signs he's reading - or Trinh
Minh-Ha for that matter - because here the gap isn't absolute, but the
slightest bit of sensitivity reveals the unbridgable chasms. What
does one do elsewhere; what constitutes elsewhere; where is the other
out of one; where is the other within? And for that matter - what's
the economy within and without all of this? Where does Lingis get his
money? Trinh Minh-Ha? What grants access to lines of flight, within
and without - what grants access to interiors and exteriors?

And for that matter, again, what - in fact - constitutes interiors?
constitutes exteriors? How are these defined within and without cul-
tures? What gives anyone the right to say anything?

I play the shakuhachi. I use glissendos, slighted notes, half-tones,
my hearing desperately trying to keep up with the fingering. I wander
across the holes; they're unknown territory. Listening to min'yo, I
can play along with the smaller Korean instruments - the rhythms are
odd but simple, the scales repetitive and backing the vocal. I can
improvise. But on the heavier Japanese instrument, I have the ability
to play only an octave and a half; the tonguing falls way behind the
rhythms. What would a Japanese make of this miscarriage? I have no
idea - not even what she would hear, in regard to the trailing sequen-
ces of notes I attempt to pour forth. This or that. The bamboo loses
some of the highs in the interior, which absorbs; the instrument act-
ually feels slightly warm after a while. Saliva drips from the bottom.
The sound is like velvet, like a bass flute in the two lower octaves.
Should I wear my headband with western clothes - a signifier I think
of manual labor? Should I make a point of this _mental labor,_ which
is also exhausting, wearing - which also is a form of walking the
beam, tempting fate? Do you think this is easy? Do you think _think-
ing_ isn't living? In some ways, thinking is the hardest thing I do -
there is nothing but the edge, following the notes I've set for my-
self, tempting language, concept, theory.

Now this is the three-sake theory. Now there will be two-sake, one-
sake, coffee or green-tea theory. But this is three-sake theory, and
it is just that, and fine as it is.

Homesickness (for Andrew Libby)


(A theme which proves impossible. See the _Device._)

First, there is an _economy of the lifeworld, the habitus_ - within which
functioning appears transparent. This is clear enough. This economy is
reflective / reflexive, returning a recognizable image of the inhabitant.
Thus there are circulations of power which appear, if at all, autonomic.
So that the body exists within a matrix which I might label maternal. One
doesn't separate from, but intensifies, the habitus (in this sense). So
that the name, proper name, is preserved.  So that I never die among my
friends. 

Second, home: Every reading is a writing; every writing is a reading. 
Neither state nor process, neither compression nor expansion. So that
intermittency is absorbed, interruption. For example, I miss a bus, catch
another. So that the rest of the day is compressed, but this is not the
compression of reading or writing, but of rearrangement of familiar
elements. This is home, these rearrangements, circumambulations, circum-
locutions. Because the language is familiar, transparent. Because the
language too is at home, a dwelling.

But there is the other element, that I might label maternal - the richness
of the home environment, the bandwidth of scents, sounds, sights, touches,
etc. - the auratic bandwidth, in other words. Here in Fukuoka, I am aware
of diminished capacity - the bandwidth is broken - different smells
accompanying different sounds, for example. So that there is the struggle
to learn. Which I might call the originary appearance of the world. Or
what might be called the wonder, through Ellroy or Merleau-Ponty. 

But the wonder pales; defuge, exhaustion, sets in. Conscious or precon-
scious interpretation is constant. Small signs veer elsewhere: an image,
say, in a movie, reminds me of Brooklyn and my mind wanders.  That image
is ungrounded _here_ for me, or images that are grounded here are tenuous,
with shallow roots. So that the _other_ is there, beyond or within beck
and call, deeper.

I find myself imagining paths through the Brooklyn sememe - this leading
to that (remembering) - that leading somewhere else. It is the ambiance
of power, perhaps, as well as submission to familiality. If postmodernism
can be considered related to the null set defined as the set of all things
not equal to themselves, then the appearance of the stranger in the city
(Simmel) is postmodern; and if modernism can be considered related to the
universal set defined as the set of all things equal to themselves, then
the home and its economy are modern. 

It may be impossible to theorize the existence of apparent permanent
separation and helplessness that thereby ensues; this, including the
partial news-from-home, constitutes an obsessive neurosis or circulation
attempting the fetishization of the immediate _thing_ or talisman, recup-
erating the unfamiliar. I do know that the tiniest things will set me off,
since I am unaware of what might be dredged from the unconscious - and
obvious, surface things, hardly affect me. My uneasy dreams are not of
Brooklyn, but of illegibility. I'm aware that this is the illegibility of
everyone, that it is a gift to be mute in a sense, so that the limits of
the world far exceed the limits of my language. In ways that can be
demonstrated, gestured, if not proven. In ways that bypass proof. 

Nor is it yearning or nostalgia, but it is related to these. And what is
yearned for, as an example, is the comfort of silence, the lack of ex-
planation, the quietude of familiality, the space where everything is
cared for. (Here, apply the theory of _suture._)

I go over and over the same grounds. I avoid homesickness, which is de-
bilitating, slows the body up, makes it live longer. I work out the art-
iculation of the Device from time to time, over and over again, making it
my own. I don't recognize myself in the Device, but it is this act of
writing, this institution, that I inhabit. I don't recognize anything any
more. As I have already stated. In the comfort of my home. 

(How does anyone know about the Device?)

My Mythology, by Nikuko


The earth was formed from a swelling that began out of a primordial
germ and split, separating dust from effluvia, debris from stony
veins. From this, the kami emerged. Soon veins formed head-bands,
emptied of swollen lungs and brains. Some kami committed seppuku,
removing their tongues by means of pinchers forged from stony veins.
Thus were formed brains with their many channels of mizu. Ah, lovely
mizu! Transparent mizu! Tasteless mizu! Channels of mizu run down tiny
brain-cunts in skulls formed from stony veins. Thus were formed "chan-
nels." Inkan stamp the elbows of kami-heads; the stamps cry "Oh Holy
Mother Let Us Have Necks And Shoulders." Thus did necks and shoulders
form. Some kami have arms on shoulders on necks on heads. They are
meat-girls, Nikukos swelling into split germs and stony veins. They
are angry girls! They are Buffalo Daughter, whose New Rock release is
on Toshiba-EMI Limited, a blend of techno and industrial voice-over
somewhat reminiscent of Big Stick, first heard at Rhino Records in Los
Angeles (as usual, their lead singer died). Buffalo Daughter appears
courtesy of Chameleon Records in Fukuoka, punk-animals everywhere or
rather can you dance as the voice goes _way behind_ the back-beat.
Meanwhile, in the Nihongi, Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto say
"Why should we not produce someone who shall be lord of the universe?"
- an off-handed remark leading to much future woe. One can only imag-
ine. "Universe" is given as "tenka" in a footnote, now meaning "the
whole country; the public; the reins of government." Either a bring-
down (EFL students wa take-note of the idiom) or hubris, from The New
Crown Japanese-English Dictionary. What happens in the tenka? I don't
know, but return to Nikuko's story, for her promising anger which
spread like a virus from Nikukos-coalescing with trunks and legs,
breasts and wombs, fierce warriors who have heard of Greece and Mon-
ique Wittig. They come across a hermit in a cave, another kami in
disguise, since there are Nikukos-One and kami, and that's all. They
show him their cunts, ask for sake; they drink much, push the stick
through his cloth, and that is all there is to it. Shite, lead char-
acter in a Noh play, he begins to sing, Wa! (Harmony!) Waa! (Hurray!)
He's _it,_ goaded by the _waki,_ Nikuko-who-does-not-wear-a-mask. Wa!
Waa! Yugen, mystery-depth-profound-subtle-aesthetic, emerges among the
kami, a beat magazine in New York 1950s, edited by Leroi Jones, if
memory serves me. "It runs fine when I'm here," sing Buffalo Daughter,
thinking of Nikuko. Shite-hermit sings and sings, stick poking
through. Thus was born "song," "Noh," and "penis." In revenge, Shite-
hermit says, "Nikuko, you cannot be in Noh." No-Noh-Nikuko. She sews
him back up in the cave. (Was he sewn at first? Whose cave? Was that
Nikuko's? Nikuko's cave - thus was born possession. Buffalo Daughter
change to swing-beat. The synthesizers wind down. Anyway, they make
the Sun-Goddess, called Oho-hiru-me no muchi, although Ama-terasu no
Oho kami and Ama-terasu-oho-hiru-me no Mikoto are cited as well. Ni-
kuko takes pity; the earth is kami, too. So are Buffalo Daughter, who
are auspicious; the hermit, who receives the penis; the waki, helping
everyone. Now everyone has all limbs and bodies but the penises and
wombs are equally divided. When a war comes, Nikuko-who-does-not-wear-
a-mask, and is a dark-haired girl living near Nakasu, gets angry, and
says, there is no kami for any of us, and there are many less penises
perhaps at first, and then less wombs. When the earth swells, there is
an earthquake and caves are swallowed in the earth. Sesshu's Long
Landscape Scroll portrays this incident of Nikuko and hermit, and, as
if in despair and irony, there is earthquake also, destroying the
earth shrine at Hakata, until its memory faded from the affairs of men
and women. (Some men and women are born without arms or legs; some
without brains; some without breasts or wombs; some without penises;
some without heads; some without skulls or necks; and some without
shoulders.)

Mizu, water; Nikuko, meat-girl; seppuku, suicide; shite, hero or hero-
ine in Noh play, primary actor (wears a mask); waki, secondary actor,
(maskless) in the same; Buffalo Daughter, playing now; kami, deity/
spirit of sorts; inkan, signature-stamp; Sesshu painted primarily in
the 15th century; head-bands are often worn by workmen in Japan; Rhi-
no Records was (and maybe is) the best alternative music store I've
seen in America. The last copy of Yugen was going for $10 a few
months ago on the Lower East Side. Big Stick has disbanded. The
Sun-Goddess names are from Aston's translation of the Nihongi. Monique
Wittig wrote The Lesbian Body among other works. Nakasu is the
snack-bar district of Fukuoka. Noh is a form of Japanese medieval
theater; there are translations by Waley, but the intensity of tele-
vised Noh was completely unexpected. I live in Hakata-Ku, Hakata Ward,
which is the merchant's town of Fukuoka. I have no brain or skull.
Aston translates the Sun-Goddess' names as "Great-noon-female-of-pos-
sessor"; "Heaven-illumine-of-great-deity"; and "Heaven-illumine-great-
noon-female-of-augustness"; but then Aston was writing in the nine-
teenth century.
