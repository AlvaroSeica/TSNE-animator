

dark virtue, dark sublime (for leni reifenstahl)


i

i dream of the woman's voice, hundreds of kilometers away in the night-
time wind and rain, coming closer, almost broken up, received on a boat 
on a stormy sea, fading in and out, the man from maine at the controls,
her presence most real, we discuss the flatness of the world wide web

ii

the infinite depths of radio in the dark night, and the flatness-now of
the computer screen, rubbed raw against our skin, as if this were all the
world that is, this narcissism, decoy of the infinite :you listened to a
woman, north north cape breton, on the short-wave, her voice coming
through the air, radio in the pulsing air, flooding our bodies, her voice
faint, you replied, i can hear you, i can hear you :in the dream, in the
pulsing air, in the dream, in the pulsing air, between cape breton and the
rest of the world, in the fog and thin dark rain, we were on the boat, you
were a man i knew in maine ::and more distance and radio and distance

come with me, the infinite depths of radio in the dark night, and the
flatness-now of the computer screen, rubbed raw against our skin, as if
this were all the world that is, this narcissism, decoy of the infinite ,
this world disappearance into mist, this irretrievable

iii

radio was the voice pining in the radiating distance through the storm;
internet is the cleansed interior positioning the body : radio was the
truth, internet the corporate; radio was the labor of the world, internet
effortless :radio makes distance that internet takes away; radio is
irretrievable distance, the reflection of the universe among the universe;
screen is cauterization, the imminent promise and premise of goods; radio
is you, is audio, through you and within you; internet promises you and
surplus you as a given, as an object, as a goods::

collapses the radio beauty, cleansed fragmentation and propriety protocol
of the net, my pocket panoramas

iv

as a child, short-wave brought me the world and withdrew the world; i
heard the lightning before the thunder, knew of the weathering sun; in
this dream, i'm returned through the maternal to the infinite, given the
language of the air; through this dream, the trans-national disappears -
the equipment was so old! and working and bringing down the voice from
everywhere; in the dream, the voice and wind and rain, the vacuum-tube of
the radio, interior hearths; in the dream the dissolutions of narcissisms;
in the dream, atmospherics

Little Poem


that's easy for you to say;
you've never been there before -
your open mouth and a leer -
that's easy for you to say.

that's easy for you to hear;
you've not been deafened by war -
you know you'll get by some way -
that's easy for you to hear.

that's easy for you to sense;
you've always lived for more -
i've lost a mind, nothing is here -
that's easy for you to sense.

your being takes me by surprise;
existence is denied me -
nights like these, I'm not here
and nothing surprises me.

i can taste and hear and see;
what is here isn't me; there's no
me to be surprised, and no 
existence sensing other real.

__



i can taste and hear some / i can run some and walk some / i can eat and
drink some / i can breath some / i can see some / i can't taste and hear
much / i can't run much and walk much / i can't eat much and drink much /
i can't breath much / i can't see much /

i don't know how to say to you / i know how to talk to myself / i can hug
myself some and hug myself / i can cuddle with me and cuddle me /

some things i can't do so well / i can't do some things / some things make
me huddle next to things / some things i can see some /

i can't say much / i can't talk well / if i have something to say i guess
i'll say it / sometimes i'll be silent and then i won't have to say
anything /

if i knew you better but it's too much / it's too much to see and hear
things / it's too much to say things / it's too hard / some things like
this make me curl up next to some things / i'm huddling now / some things
i can see some / i'm cuddling now /

Non-Standard Inscription of Ashur-nasir-pal II


Homing, herein I write my declarations, my names, all of you know my
names. Ashur-nasir-pal, I'm the ruler here, even Izanagi and Izanami are
obeisant in these parts, I'm the favorite of Daishin Nikuko, I carry the
their vajra into Ashur, I'm the king of the names of the world, you can't
have their names; I carry them, because I'm the son

of Daishin Nikuko, the son of Izanagi and Izanami, I'm the king of the
names of the world, yes I am, I'm the king of the names of the world and
the king of Assyria too (which has a lot of land),

did I tell you I'm the son of Adad-nerari, the king of the names of the
world and the king of Assyria too (which has a lot of land),

the strongest here, I've memorized all the names, just about every one of
them, I don't think there's any I've forgotten, Daishin Nikuko has taught
me well, but I also trust Ashur, who wouldn't, he's just about the best
there is, in the four directions, did I tell you I know the names of all
four of them, 

anyway, Ashur takes care of his people, he's really strong, but not as
strong as Izanagi and Izanami, but strong enough, more than the waters
that are rolling in on occasion, I could tell you about the flood,

anyway as I was saying, I rule even those who don't want to be ruled
because I know their names and maybe they don't, and this includes just
about everyone,

I'm the terrific warrior, did I say thanks to Ashur, and I walk all over
enemies everywhere just by saying their names, I certainly bring them down
a notch or two,

because I live by my trust in everyone's name, Izanagi for example, and
Izanami for another, I think I mentioned Ashur and I know somewhere along
the line I said Daishin Nikuko,

I named all the lands around and even the names of just about everyone
living in them, you can be sure of that, it made me in real tight control,
and they gave me things, and they had a lot of names as well, 

I took their names, yes I did, and it gave me a certain edge,

Ashur and Izanami picked me out of the usual group of people, gave me my
name and the name of the kingships, and gave me the weapon of  knowing
everyone in these parts, 

I yelled the names at the troops of Lullumu who were everywhere, this
happened while they were trying to fight, and as for the others from
Nairi, Chabchu, and Shubaru, I know all of them, their names and
everything, I roared their names like Adad did, he had a name which was
Adad and he used it, and then there was Izanami and Izanagi, did I mention
Shumarh and Adad, they also came along,

I yelled the names from one bank to the other of the Tigris, and all
across Lebanon, you should have heard it, and the Big Sea as well and all
of Laqu and Suhu and even to Sato and Hokkaido and Rapiqu, and they just
about all gave up,

oh, there's more, did I tell you I got the land from the Subnat River to
Urartu, knew all of them, and took stuff from the Kirruru pass to Gilzanu,
that was harder, I almost forgot things, but then I was onto the banks of
the Lower Zab to the Til Bari upstream from Zaban and then from Til sha
Abtanni to Til sha Zabdani, I've been doing pretty well, you'd better
believe it, studying night and day, day and night, Shamash guiding me, it
was incredible, all this work, but pretty soon I knew everyone in the
whole region, 

just as I told you, even from the Babite pass through all the way to
Hashmar,

I never did get to Tamtu Babibu, but I heard it was pretty incredible,

so I set up a lot of people all over the place, keeping track of the
names, it was far too much for one person, I didn't even know whether or
not or how many lands or worlds were involved, but I sure did know their
names, and when I'd have to, I could learn them all over again, everyone's
to be sure, 

well, as I said, I'm Ashur-nasir-pal, and I worship all the names and hold
them in my beleaguered hands, and I'm the fierce dragon naming all the
cities and the mountains, naming all the valleys and the rivers, naming
all the streams and rocks, and even the grains of sand, to their full
extent, giving all their names to the full extent,

I'm not afraid of anything, I'm the dragon-lion and the lion-dragon, I'm
called the Dragon-Lion and the Lion-Dragon, and with one naming I can lose
the mountain and the sea and the city and whole nations, families, and
rocks and grains of sand to their full extent, 

everyone's giving up around me in the six and nine directions under the
ten suns,

well, there was Kalbu which Shalmaneser the Assyrian king, built up,
anyway I had to rebuilt it, I remembered everyone's name just like that,
in an instant of an eye, 

I brought all these people whose names I knew to live there, from Laqu,
Sirqu (you remember Sirqu I'm sure, it's just across the Euphrates from
here), all of Zamua, Bit Aidini, Chattu and Lubarnu, they'd have a good
time getting to work,

oh, and I also removed the ancient tell, it was pretty dilapidated, I went
down to the beginnings of the waters and put 120 courses of brick down
there, they were all inscribed with the names, and the courses of bricks
with names ran all the way up to the surface,

and then I built a palace of curved jewels and gold and swords and cedar
(that was for the halls), and cypress and juniper, everything was named
just with the right degree of naming, there was also boxwood and teak,
terebinth and tamarisk, and I did this all to be happy and to sit back or
recline and continue with the naming which was occupying a lot of my time
by this point,

anyway, I also put in a lot of animals from the deserts and mountains, and
valleys and rivers, and they were all named, and some of them were in
private quarters, and some were skillfully fashioned out of marble and
alabaster just so, there's no end to them, 

I used limestone as well, then I put in the gates which were named for
the five directions and the eight directions, they had names skillfully
fashioned just above them, I gave them the names they bear, everything
beautifully bordered with bronze studs, 

did I mention the doors, they were made from cedar and curved jewels and
marble and limestone and cypress and cedar and juniper and cedar and
terebinth and cedar and tamarisk and mirrors and swords and cedar
thereabouts,

I put a lot of stuff into that palace, you'd have to see the silver and
gold and iron and steel and bronze and tin and copper, it is all over the
place, and I took it and put it all inside and I was busy everywhere with
the naming for many months and years, even right up to the present, and I
have to thank Ashur and Daishin Nikuko and Shamash and Ashur and Ashur for
all that.

Adad


This is for her, gold and juniper orchards, everyone was named Adad and
used the "Adad," and then there was Izanami and Izanagi, did I mention I
brought all these people whose names I knew to live there, from Adad? I'm
the terrific warrior, did I say thanks to her and her, and I walk all over
Adad and "Adad," they also came along, all of them. All the streams and
rocks, and even the grains of sand, to their fullest and nothing surprises
me. And I built a palace of curved jewels and gold and swords and cedar
because I knew their names and maybe they don't, and this includes breath,
swoon, and languor. Ir\emum takes her, seizing her, called the Dragon-Lion
and the Lion-Dragon, and with one naming I can take her. It's all over; I
can taste her and hear and see; i can't breathe much. It's too much to see
her and hear in an instant of an eye, the interior of her body. "Adad" was
her lover, I took her mouth, I didn't know where I was.

i've been burning cdrom
it is now up to edition 2.06 with advanced improvement html firstpage
and flash collaboration with reiner strasser / annie abrahams added as 
well as nu images
there are articles from 80s to now and the file system of texts is
uptodate

so am gathering my material in editions advancing of which the original
railroad earth was 1.0 and now look 2.06

this is a heap of work but this explains as i run crazy through editions
why i am not writing all too much but have in fact been thinking about two
noh plays atsumori and matsukaze in terms of solo dance

you can always order and incise yourself into one or another edition and i
will send the latestest to you. but you must still end that sad 14 USD to
me and i will send you the latestestest

do you see how capital works, running fast thru edition, get them all! and
to be sure USD capital/ized here so exciting

Our research has found that many people have tried one or more of
the following...

    Free Classifieds? (Don't work anymore)
    Web Site? (Takes dozens of visitors)
    Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)
    E-Zine? (Hope they have a *huge* subscriber list)
    Search Engines? (Forget it, unless you're in the top 20)

         S O   W H A T   W I L L   W O R K ?

Although often misunderstood, there is one method that has proven
to succeed time-after-time.

***New Just Released - and now, 15 TRILLION addresses***

We have just increased our list size from 10-million to 15-trillion
without a corresponding increase in price!

Over the past 6 years, we have gained a reputation for having the
cleanest, most responsive e-mail address lists in the industry.
No one has gone to the work it takes to produce an e-mail address
list of this quality.

Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists:

1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates. We include alternative
life-species, bacteria, everything!

2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even
more. No address with inappropriate or profane wording survives!
Backyard nematodes in addition!

3. Then we use our private database of thousands of known
Internet "extremists", those opposed to any kind of commercial
e-mail, and kicked off every one we could find. Damn them extremists!
They will not reach the GOLD MIND OF OPPORTUNITY!

4. All domains were verified to insure they're valid. Except for
prions which are visible only with a super-human electronic microscope!

5. And finally, we sorted the list into easy-to-manage packets of
20,000 addresses in simple text (.txt) format that will work with
any computer operating system.

WHAT DID WE END UP WITH?


        Q U A D R I L L I O N S   V O L U M E   12
                   15 Trillion Addresses Strong!

Four Women and Men! Enlightenment!


Born low, we aspire high; our families embarrass us!

I have killed my father and was well satisfied. I killed my mother as
well, and, it does not matter whether you believe me or not, I killed an
Arhat as well. I further cut open the body of the Buddha, releasing the
blood of enlightenment. I talked about these things in the order and
created considerable dissension. With blood on my hands, I continued to
study. How terrible I am!

Our clothes are a filthy mess, covered with dirt, blood, and excrement!

I believe that being bound by beautiful women and men will bring about my
salvation. When I am bound, I am fondled and my passions reach the highest
level Buddha-enlightenment. My family is miserable because of these
unnatural interests of mine, which I follow religiously. Such interests
have rendered me and many beautiful women and men diseased; nevertheless,
we continue in these activities. I have induced them to begin wars without
end, defiling the very age we live in.

The flowers in our hair are really wilted!

I am afraid that all this is not sufficient, that I will not have enough
to live on, and that my reputation will be tarnished. Why not? I have
violated everything, indulged in every depravity without conquering them,
created misery throughout the world. Having caused the death of so many
others, I fear death myself, becoming a hungry ghost starving and doomed
to wander this war-torn world. I fear many will organize and turn against
me, hunting me down as an innocent and wounded animal.

Our bodies smell so bad no one will get near us! How wonderful!

I have desire for these wonderful beautiful woman and men, who fulfill my
every need. Together, we hate the world as a group; nonetheless we are
lazy in our actions, depressed in their consequences. When we try nothing,
we are wild with excitement, and excitedly wild; we indulge in every
transgression, swallowing each other's urine and feces, exposing ourselves
in public places, using animals for illicit purposes. Still, deep within
me, doubt remains supreme; is this the way to Enlightenment?

We're sweating! Look at us! We've done it!

JENNIFER on prayer


reading the sutras, the upanishads, the vedas, the analects, where is pro-
pitiation? why does the j-c-i tradition insist on giving thanks for gifts
we've never asked for - why this constant yammering of thanks - when deity
should be brought up before a tribunal, killed once and for all? clearly
prayer's of the nature of a contract - there's nothing i can do for you
god, but i can constantly praise you - like the oriental despot you are -
in the hui neng sutra surely there's obeisance, but it's freely given -
results in inward-seeking, satori of the sudden school - it's between one
and another, seeker and patriarch (hui neng) - there's nothing elsewise of
giving thanks - and for what, in any case - certainly not for an existence
one would escape from - yet in the j-c-i there's this spewing of thanks
and praise - it's out of this, i'd insist, that techne arose - technology
poured forth - the emblematic of the works of god - look at the end of
newton's principia - the horror of it all - i'm a baby theologist - it
doesn't take much here to see what's going on - the bourgeois contract
given over from imminence to immanence - grounded - since one is sought
among the materialities of the world - in foucauldian divinatio, reading
the book of nature written by god - we've got to thank him for that one -
god, not foucault - when one thinks clearly about it, prayer is horrific
itself - it doesn't do anyone any good - it places thought in a supine
position - not even mind-clearing - simply supine, crushed by rock -
granite-god - mind-numbing - all those absurd myths - christ the son -
seven days of nothing etc. - everyone's a chosen people, everyone's got a
story to tell - god's sitting somewhere picking them out - he's a jealous
one, won't have others around him - the fun is in the others - there's a
lot of women waiting in the wings - want thanks as well - mighty devilish
of'em - "what's the source of non-attachment - well, it's got no source,
manjusri. with non-attachment from the beginning, you've got dharmas just
about everywhere."

Water-shedding 


Shedding water / holding it back / in abeyance / closing the loopholes. 

For the past two weeks I have been burning cdroms of my work of the past
six years; I began with the version I did for a group in Atlanta (that I
abandoned) - con/text/sub 1.0. This has led to sub/con/text - the current
and final title - versions 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.2, and
2.3. The earlier ones were organizations and reorganizations; the later -
2.2 and 2.3 are the result of opening up other, older, computers I have
here, and re-editing a number of texts and files. The directory structure
- for such it is - is a tree structure, which has remained pretty coherent
through most of the history of computing; the root leads to /cdrom/ - at
which point, the directory tree and file trees are reproduced; the various
directories are given; there is a readme first text; and there is an
index.html opening file if one is entering through a browser.

Most of the time, all of this has had to be tuned and retuned; in other
words, I have been tuning and retuning six years' worth of work - as well
as another 20 or so essays from the 1980s and early 90s. There are some
parts of the Internet Text as well (found within the /cdrom/network direc-
tory) that go back to the late sixties.

I worry that all of this is a tomb, in a way; it contains most of my work
I've considered valuable over the past few decades. Odd things such as my
Structure of Reality - with its numerous diagrams and ruminations on
threshold logics - aren't reproduced, but there are descriptions of them
in the Internet Text as well. The three older records (two of which were
reissued as cds) aren't included; the films aren't included; and only very
recent video segments are found on it. None of the work from my post-
industrial group Damaged Life is on it. 

But the writing is there, in all fullness, and in the /cdrom/program di-
rectory are numerous programs exploring some of the fractal measure-geom-
etries I discovered (I'm sure not originally), for anyone with qbasic.exe
installed to play with. And there is _some_ music, including electric gui-
tar, which has been a major interest for years, and shakuhachi, which I
have been working intensely with, for the past few. Meanwhile, there are
all those graphics - the /cdrom/image directory alone has close to 380 -
which form a universe by themselves, resonating with the texts, wrapping
themselves around each other and the viewer as well.

All of which is to say, the watershed. I've been relieved that my work
stands a chance of surviving - the disks holds a great deal of work that
is not on line for example - in one or another form, that it might be
rediscovered sometime in the future. It's oddly supported now - I haven't
done a "real" book since Station Hill took me on in 1984 (Disorders of the
Real, 1988) - only magazine and book anthologies, e-venues, etc. So I hope
that the electronic venue of the cdrom will hold for at least twenty years
or so, at least on antique computers, and that I will, or someone will, be
able to update the materials, reconfigure them, in the latest incarnation
of mass storage devices.

There are issues for me of the phenomenology of the disk; the latest
copies have a colored label on the disk itself, instead of bleak black and
white - and somehow the whole seems more permanent. And a fair number of
them, in one or another version, have been distributed. Nonetheless, a lot
of people I would want to have them just haven't been interested - and I
ascribe this to - no matter how much the opposite is claimed - an intrans-
igent attachment to the _book_ - something I also feel. It's as if the
cdrom can only be a _project,_ or _resource_ - but nothing that carries
the weight or intimacy of the book - nothing, in short, that is _desirab-
le,_ in terms of personal ownership. The relationships and gaps between
computer and language are still labeled as "experimental," in spite of
years of development (my own first computer works were from 1971 for ex-
ample). 

I know the value of my work; I hold onto it like a hungry ghost that's
forbidden sleep or recompense, that wanders, devours everywhere. I get
nourishment back-channel which keeps me going, and I'm happy that those
people who do want the disks are world-wide (in spite of the postage). But
there are times I'm overwhelmed by the massivity, by a theory-thicket so
large that it literally borders on substance. I've noted with relief that
people tend to find the disks easy to navigate and explore (which is what
I intended), and I've thought that this might lead further to the idea
that there are language/image worlds opening up through this - that a kind
of intimacy may result after all. But the activity is very different; like
hypertext, it asks a lot of a reader, a kind of mobility he or she might
not be comfortable with.

It's odd to roam across the six years. They cover periods of intense dep-
ression, of my mother's death, of my successes and failures as list moder-
ator, as a writer inspired by such disparate sources as Donald Knuth, old
Akkadian, linux, contemporary Japan, and Jabes. Nikuko, Jennifer, Doctor
Leopold Konninger, Travis, Clara, Honey, Alan, and Julu come and go; there
are explorations of MOOs, netsex, protocols, and the very early history of
the Net. Different venues (editing an issue of New Observations on Cul-
tures of Internet, and the Lusitania Book, Being on Line; putting together
the chapbooks for the parables and The Case of the Real; etc.) produce
warps into the fabric, texts tending towards momentary completions (36 new
parables for example), images carried to extremes and exhaustion (work
with Blender for example). I tried all through the work to keep up both
intensity and resonance, as if each piece were my last (which is something
always haunting me, dreams of death without recompense or memory). I think
for the most part I succeeded, sometimes too well; there are sections of
the diary and the Internet Text that I can read only with difficulty at
this point. I wonder if this comes through, hoping that resonance will
carry through (each text, as if within Indra's net, resonating with, and
signaling, every other).

And all this fits on a single, distributable disk, finally reaching a pla-
teau of organization that _makes sense_ to me, carries a certain weight.

I find myself less able to sleep, feeling more physically ill, but as if
something were taken care of, taken account of - as if something unaccoun-
table and unaccounted for, were, nonetheless, subject to a form of tally.
So that my writings now, in a sense, are "beyond the disk," oddly cooled,
in a period of hiatus, as I wonder if the disk will be understood, if that
even matters, and as I work on distribution. (There are copies still
available, of the newer 2.2 and 2.3, through Alan Sondheim, 432 Dean St.,
Brooklyn, NY, 11217, $14 in any form. End of advertisement.) I find myself
spending more time within the languorous temporality of the burner, nap-
ping between finished disks popping out on this slow machine. I've burned
three copies of music cds as well - The Blue Humans, and the two old LPs
that were reissued a few years ago as cds - for backup. I've backed up all
my usual miscellaneous files and programs and teaching materials. It's as
if I could close up shop. It's as if a kind of work is completed.

It's a watershed and water shed - somewhere I'm beneath or elsewhere than
all of this, protocols splashing from my body; I'm down deep, inviolate;
I'm vulnerable, always in league with death.

Loneliness of Being King: Shooting Arrows at the Moon

Ethelbert: "If the king's drinking somewhere, and someone does evil there,
he's got to pay double compensation."

Ethelbert goes on: "If a freeman steals from the king, he's got to repay
nine-fold."

Ethelbert, warming up to the subject, continues: "If the king calls every-
one together, and someone does evil there, he's got to pay double compen-
sation plus 50 shillings to the king."

Ethelbert, on to something, adds, "If someone sleeps with one of the
king's girls, he owes 50 shillings to the king."

Ethelbert's getting really excited; he says, "If someone's fucking the
grinding-slave, he owes 25 shillings, and if he's fucking the third-class
slave, he owes another twelve."

Ethelbert's calming down, states, "If someone's messing with the king's
protection, he owes 50 shillings."

What about everyone else, he's asked, replies, "It's the usual type of
compensation. But I'm going drinking with the king." Someone says, "But
you are the king." Ethelbert says, "The arrows of fortune; I drink alone."

Ah'ulabi!


Ah'ulab! ("Woe!" old Akkadian), Ah'ulabi! ("Woe is me!") - two forms that
deserve recognition, reinstatement in the corpus. "h'" is guttural "ch" as
in "Achtung." But you can't mix those languages. Still, in English at the
very least I want to argue for the recuperation of this interjection. Why?
Ah'ulabi! I'm feeling ill at the moment, and this resonates from the depth
of my being. Note I did not say "depths," but confined it to that singular
plateau accompanying any sickness. Ah'ulab! for those who feel as I do,
unable to focus properly, the nose stuffed, fever high, chills percolating
through the body. "Ah'ulabi!"

Hlothhere, Eadric, Wihred, and Ine


"Hey, if you walk off with that cup and we're all drinking here, pay up a
shilling and twelve to the king!"

"But ah'ulab! If you walk out of here with a bit of bloodshed, watch
out! Give the king 50 shilling, and do something or other for the host."

The host: "I don't care what she gives me. I just want something or other.
It's been a rough night, what with the drinking and all."

The king: "You shouldn't have taken out that weapon! Now give 12 shillings
to me and one to the host. You'll feel better in the morning. Put that
away!"

"Now let's go somewhere really neat! If you're sacrificing to the devils -
I don't care what kind of sacrifice - and your wife doesn't know this,
you've got to turn over just about everything! And that's not all - just
wait! You've got to give healsfang as well - another 120 shillings!
Ah'ulab! Where are you going to get all that?"

Host: "It's terrific though if you're a slave! Just pay six shillings and
sacrifice to all the devils you want! You might be flogged, but that's a 
small price to pay!"

Slave: "Anything but this, I really don't want to be flogged! I promise to
be good, I won't sacrifice to the devils any more! I promise, I promise!
Look, I'm sweating!"

Host: "Well, we could always fuck of course. But then we'd have to give it
all up or be kicked out of the church."

Slave: "We could start a church of our own!"

Host: "We'd have to get a really big building!"

King: "Not if I have anything to do with it!"

Host: "We might have to fight, and if anyone fights in the palace, he's
got to give up everything and the king decides whether he lives or dies!"

King: "That's me as well! Now I don't know what to do! A'hulabi! I'll have
to give up everything to the luscious slave! She'll be my master! That
sounds excellent!"

"If you guys continue fighting and drinking, I'll be really patient and
you'll owe me 30 shillings."

Slave: "It's worth it! This is really great!"

"Hey, we're wandering way off the track here, but we're shouting and
blowing horns and making noise in all sorts of ways, so we don't have to
be killed or redeemed!"

Host: "I promise not to fight in the castle!"

Up-to-date kings, Alfred, Athelstan, and Ine


"This started with the shields. Don't put sheepskin on a shield! If you 
"do that, you owe thirty shillings! Ah'ulab! It's worse on Sunday!

"And I'd be careful about dogs, because if one bites a guy to death, 
"he's got to pay six shillings, and that's just for the first offense. 
"The second time, he'd better have twelve shillings, and the third,
"thirty. I suppose after that, we'd better take the dog away.

"If you've got a dog, it's called a "pet."

"Sometimes a "pet" means a particularly friendly dog. But if you keep 
"the animal which is killing all these people, you'd better be prepared 
"to pay.

"If you've got any sort of pet, you'd better be prepared to pay. If
"you've got a nun you've taken, you've got to pay one-hundred-twenty
"shillings. That's an incredible amount! Don't take nuns! It goes half
"to the king and half to the bishop and church.

"If you've got to "pet nuns," be careful; if the nun has a kid, it's not
"going to get any inheritence - and either will the nun! And this is on
"top of the one-hundred-twenty shillings. This isn't really worthwhile
"unless she's a terrific nun!

"You'd better be careful where you're going. If you break into the
"castle, you've got to pay one-hundred-twenty! If you break into the
"archbishop's place, that's ninety, and if it's just the bishop, it's
"sixty. If you break into a man who's got the twelve-hundred wergeld, you
"owe thirty; if he's got the six-hundred, fifteen shillings. If you break
"into the earl's enclosure, though, it's only five shillings, and that
"might be worthwhile!

"But ah'ulab! If you break in during Lent or when the army's running
"around, you owe double all of that!

"Now suppose you're the brother of the nun or just thinking about stir-
"ring trouble because your sister's messing about with the bishop. You
"can fight the guy any way you want without starting a vendetta, if the
"guy's under the blanket with her. This holds with your wife or your
"mother or your daughter for that matter. But your mother better be
"married, because if she's not, none of this holds and the vendetta is on
"its way. So think of it like this -

"Your mom screws your dad who leaves her. You're born later on and have
"a go at life. Your mom wants a go at it too and takes up with some guy
"who lives in the bishop's castle. Say he's a cook. Well you hear about
"it, but what can you do? First, you wait until the middle of the night,
"sneak into the room and find them both in bed under the blanket. It's
"got to be the same blanket - if he's under one and she's under the
"other, it doesn't count! Then what? You still can't do anything to help
"your mom by killing the cook because she wasn't married in the first
"place! So you go out and steal a nun and break into the earl's enclosure
"with her and owe one-hundred-twenty shillings, which given everything
"else going on in your life, might be worth it after all!

"Remember, you can't sell a horse across the sea! You can't even get it
"there! Not even if it's a pet!"

The Collection of Papyri in the New Museum


We first come to the Collection of Papyri. To the left are two cases which
contain book and writing accessories, including an exercise-book of nine
wax tablets; to the right, a seated figure of Sebek-hotep with a book and
writing-case (fastened on the left breast). On the walls are Texts in the
Egyptian Language, the most noteworthy of which are from the Book of the
Dead; to the right of the entrance, 3008. Representation of the judgment
of the dead; on the right wall, Syrian, Coptic, and Arabic Texts. On the
parapet are Greek Texts: in the middle, 11,656. Tax-roll under Hadrian
(A.D. 133); 11,547. Decree of Germanicus (A.D. 19); 10,582. Latin-Greek-
Coptic conversational book; to the right are fragments of texts from Euri-
pides (13,217), Sophocles (9908), Aristophanes (13,231 c), from the 'Per-
sians' of Timotheus of Miletus (9875), important as being the oldest Greek
handwriting on papyrus (5th cent. B.C., still previous to the Ptolemaic
period), Alcaeus (9810), Sappho (9722), and the Iliad (6485 and 11,510).

Up-to-date kings in meadows


"We've got a big meadow here! "Let's sign the Magna Charta! "Let's make a
smaller one! "Ok, we need some rules. "Ok, let's make some rules. "We need
a ball! "It's not a game. "Ok, well, you can't murder anyone. "We still
need a ball. "Ok, we don't need a ball. "That sounds good. "Does anyone
own this place? "I do. "I do. "Well, just kidding. "We don't really know!
"I like meadows! "If a slave rapes a slave-woman, castrate him! "Where'd
that come from? "Well, it's a rule. "Ok, here's one. If you're a woman and
you're screwing wizards and sorcerers, you'll be killed. "That's a little
harsh. "But think of it, wizards and sorcerers! "If you burn a tree down
around here, you'll pay sixty shillings. "That's absurd. There are no
trees here! "It's a meadow! "Well don't burn anything! You know, fire's a
thief? "Why's that? "Because it takes what you've got. "But it doesn't
keep it! "That's different. I think it eats it though. "We're losing track
here. "Okay! If you steal a nun and you're fucking like crazy and have a
kid and she dies, her inheritance goes to the king. "Would you forget nuns
for a moment? You're always going on about them. Nuns, nuns, nuns. "How
about this? Suppose you're a thief over twelve years of age, and you steal
over twelve pence, then we'll kill you. "Suppose you've left? There's no
reason to stay around with the goods! "Well, we'll look all over for you,
at least until everyone's had a go at it. "What if you're looking for this
guy and you don't have a horse? "Well then, go on foot! "What if you don't
have feet? "You're being silly. "No, you're being silly. "Okay, but if the
thief flees to a church or even my palace, no one can attack him. "What if
someone does attack him? "Then we'll all hate him and he'll have to give
up everything he owns! "Is this the Magna Charta? "Where's the ball?
"We're not doing the Magna Charta and we're not playing a ball game. "Ok,
here's a rule..."

(  here is where it came from

thinking about the Brhad-aranyaka Upanishad and the horse-sacrifice

naming of gods and unnamings of horses

thinking further, if there were no human languaging

there would be the running of horses, gods, gods and horses

would be no sacrifice and no delineation

gods massed like horses in herds

horses together in running like gods

at the beginning of the Upanishad, aum, followed by

'the dawn, verily, is the head of the sacrificial horse...'

it wasn't the gods that did the sacrifice :

"In this sacrifice a horse is let loose and a guard of three hundred
follows his track. If any one hinders the horses' progress, the guard will
have to fight. When the horse completes a victorious circuit of the earth
and returns to the capital, he is offered as a sacrifice, and the king who
performs the sacrifice assumes the title of sovereign, emperor." 
(Radhakrishnan)

it was the man taking the title collapsing the animal

it was the naming

no longer horses and gods horses and gods

the proclivity of the circuit or circuitry

from then on, speech, corrals, sacrifice, contract-gift

and that is the source of the text spreading like fire on the prairie
or the heart of the castle by the very refusal

among horses and gods, to include men

/HONEY HOLE in TEXT/

cut out from the archives:

screams in hebrew and aramaic - loud voices in akkadian and mitannian -
(modified from the akkadian) works of known or conjectured meaning with
sumerian and akkadian words - i note in passing alan, alam = essri, 'form,
statue.' even here the form is abject and wanton, the locus of desire.
think of a particular class, whether or not sumerian, etc. so the same
graphemes may be found within the "biblical" tradition and the presumed
sumerian origins of writing. at the "/e/...)" for example.

city is sumerian uru, perforated by a stick or stylus into clay, the gran-
ularity inherited from the sumerian incision into the body of the woman or
man. it is as if one stood on the shores of a gulf separating shumer from
man and woman, woman or brother. think of lugal, sal, lu, dumu su-ba-ri-
im. these languages erased across the text from which this text derives.

to be born a _foundling_ on a moo or mud, dumuzi's dream, oral poetry, the
protocols stuttered before every written. the tokens signify greek ideas,
without the theory; i think of them as resonances across sumerian, luwian,
palaic, hittite, akkadian, with _me,_ "attribute" in this context, an arid
environ within and without sumer. return to sumerian excisions, the stylus
cutting through the eye of the prisoner all across the region: no one,
ever-vigilent, sees the enemy.

the akkadians and sumerians were bored. the hittites enjoyed themselves in
a dirt-free environment. there were contests: who had the cleanest, most
proper body?

whole populations on the move; everyone gives me texts in unknown scripts;
i struggle with cuneiform incisions; this is how i earn my living. i orig-
inate the contract, drawn on clay, bone, skin, unreadable eyes, severed
genitals, the trampling of ashur.

inanna! women speaking incomprehensible tongues, palawian, sumerian, hit-
tite, works of unknown or conjectured meaning with sumerian and akkadian
words, akkadian burrowings, abject and wanton, loci of desire.

my name is a-bi. from the manifold of perverse sex, borrowing ideograms,
other incisions, trades. you'll find me at sargon square. do i wander in a
desert looking for you, o cuneiform? inanna, is this shumer, akkad? our
names are our incisions. cut deep into us, we become them, exist: do we
wander in a desert of names?

i've seen ghosts in akkad. i've seen ghosts in shumer as well. i've seen
them traveling. i've seen them carrying styli. i've seen them cut deeper
into flesh than the world has rules. desire has swollen ghosts; writing
procures them. burns and cuts leave scars. i look forward to screaming,
burrowing, abject and wanton, in the desert blinded by speech.

on glyphs


english has been recently considered, among other things, hieroglyphic:
hieroglyphs. twin worlds torn apart at the base of cyclicity - transli-
terations from hieroglyph to hieroglyph.

note we do not ask for hieroglyphic dominance, active as in days of yore,
among adepts, pc cuneiform in relation to mac hieroglyphic, everyone
looking to glyph stones, the scrawl of hittite hieroglyphs, scrawl of
jenny holzer.
 
position, the position of the _hieroglyph,_ the beginning of writing - a
_binding_ in cybermind, hieroglyphic of the body asserting itself, votary.
the hieroglyph is rough; the sign for "homage" (?) seems recorded once,
with the letting of blood.

taut, worked out and through the wires, tonight's hieroglyph. wherever
your text is, contrast produces the event - intractable wryting, hiero-
glyph of the delineated body, as in _this text_ appearing across the
village.

i do my best to render hieroglyphic the hieroglyph of imaginary usage.  
what's left of my texts will be read like legacy hieroglyphics, i'll be
sputtered, expanded on the side of meaning. i do my best with take-me
command hieroglyph, masochistic inscription of cord-bound skin.

backwards, the reversed boat. wavering, the hieroglyphic address: soft and
yielding to the touch, confrontation, articulation among the shrines. the
building of the shrines "for whom they are intended, soft and yielding to
the touch."

they are open all the way down the shrine or wall: an imaginary usage, the
uncanny. _the symbolic pours from the mouth._ (the _differance,_ o be
fine, o be light, o be many, render density filled with novel and strange
creations. the chambers form hieroglyphs of mind and theory-mind.

here is everything you need.

"clitoral read clitoris look look anal open anal take hieroglyph look anal
open anal take hieroglyph look anal open anal take hieroglyph from anal
look hieroglyph put hieroglyph in anal close anal look envelope take" 

"bruised hieroglyph, ruined prick, etched and flowered letters:
pours through in form of hieroglyph shattering bleak moon,
bruised hieroglyph, ruined prick, etched and flowered letters"

look, look hieroglyph: blood-red anal striations; evacuate down, 
hieroglyph and body

a print or hieroglyph, a body bound in the form of sacred writing.
the body an altered hieroglyph, reasoned and unreasoning - your body
writing, act of speech or even the idiotic carving of hieroglyphic -
speaking the hieroglyph of imaginary usage.
speaking the hieroglyph of imaginary usage.

his death is an other.

a writing which folds back upon itself, hieroglyph, i say: the land of the
hieroglyph of the production of meaning. such are _facts:_ glyphs mark my
way before birth, beyond death. you might read this from the air, and you
might read this as a sign of love.

as a sign of love, stained and measureless. sealed. what is within the en-
velope, unwritten thoughts, "but they know everything." i'm bent backward
split, there are women everywhere: they know everything.

( moments when the text fails, falls through - when there's a gap that can
be filled with just about anything - when "whole" appears - suturing over
the lip and depth in relation to totality - when it appears as if there
were a variable somewhere in the vicinity - as if a token impressed itself
in the substrate - as if this were the origin of writing - or the gasp of
breath - or the inhale of imminent language - when there is a gap or hiat-
us - when the text is shattered or broken - when a certain stylistics of
annihilation or ideological apparatus predominates - when the assertion of
the grain or granularity of existence occurs against an imaginary emptied
vacuum - when virtual or real particle pairs annihilate - vacuum of the
imaginary - when legs are spread, mouths opened - when there are entrances
and exitings - when the spheres are shattered - when defuge sets in - when
there's nothing more to say - or the writer's at a loss - death intervenes
- holes - absence sutured -

Of course what's of interest here is the insertion of any interrogative
into the violence of capitalism - an increasing tendency towards the
inhuman, suturing of bodies within imaginary cyborgs, bought and sold.
