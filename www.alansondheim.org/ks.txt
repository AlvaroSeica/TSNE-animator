stuff here)


Linkage abc s.t. a -> a' --> a'b'c'

Coupling abc s.t. a -> a' --> a'bc

In both abc = bca  
        (ab)c = a(bc)
        aa = a

Spray a[Zn](t) where Z is a bandwidth indexed by n ranging from 0 to the
       order of the continuum, and (t) is a temporal indexing.

Collapse [Zn]a(t)

Chaos-Mother a[Zn], [Zn]a

Avatar-Binding [Zn][Ym] where n,m are at least inaccessibly high.

Mirroring [Zn][Ym](t) --> [(ZuY)f(n,m)](t) where f(n,m) >> n v m

Mirroring [Zn][Zn](t) --> [Zf(n,n)](t)

Desiccation abc -> ab v bc v ac v a v b v c v

Rill  -> a

Some thinking here, paralleling thinking years ago through graph-marker
theory in which networks were mapped according to states or nodes; these
mappings could fold in upon themselves, mirror, or absorb foreign elements
with or without basic transformations.

Aggregate abcde unordered

Linked aggregate abcde, a -> a' --> a'b'c'd'e'

Example, an aggregate of rocks, a linked aggregate of explosives

Aggregates are capable of spray, collapse, chaos-mother, avatar-binding,
mirroring, etc.

In an aggregate, any ordering (axiom of choice) is equivalent to any
other

An aggregate spray possesses no history, since there are no ordered
trajectories 

An aggregate collapses possesses no history for the same reason

Thus an aggregate may be considered an accumulation of temporal states, 
whose sequencing has been lost; its temporality is itself an aggregate

Some people maintain that these new dances are improper and immporal. To
prove their contention they point to the fact that these new dances have
been prohibited in many cities all over the world. In defense of the new
dances I will say that they are just as proper--in fact, some of them are
more so than our present-day Two Step or Waltz, which are universally 
accepted. The reason for their debarment is the position taken by the
dancers; so it can readily be seen that it is not the fault of the dance,
but of the dancer.

sleep and the project of being-awake


sleep 3 at the prompt sleeps my account for three seconds. sleep * is my
life; stress and depression sinking the account randomly into somnolence.
air seeps from the room; everything diminishes in scale. the hatred that
my life has become, the impossibility of function, takes itself out on the
remains of the flesh; grotesque, i collapse. sleep occupies me six to
fourteen hours a day, without rhyme or reason; collisions of misspent and
annulled cycles cancel out consciousness. it comes on thick, like syrup;
in the day it is filled with dreams, and in the night, with edgy abrasive-
ness. sometimes tears provide lubricant, sometimes masturbation. the bed
is my death.

the sweetness of soured milk governs my theory work, momentary conversa-
tions. i crawl the world for continuity from one unconsciousness to the
next.

no project lasts longer than the brief intermittency of wakefulness, and
the horizon of light is filled with darkness. the world seems too warm,
too brilliant. i can't strain against it, the breath of despondency on the
back of my neck, transformation of flesh into indefinite substance. i will
watch while everything decays around me, watch until i sink back into the
pillows once again. reading, writing, online; eating, walking, watching my
mouth open and close in front of a few unsuspecting others. over and over
again, hoping for a final resolution - the hope, too, dampened, exhausted,
disappearing as i collapse once more.

"We regard the voices that torment the schizophrenic as a symptom, in
which a special mode of involvement is likewise manifested. The voices are
heard, they are acoustic phenomena, but there are also different enough to
contrast with all else that is audible. The mode of their reception is ra-
ther a being-affected, simlar to hearing. The voices emerge in a deranged
acoustic sphere and encounter the patient in a relation to the _Other_
which most resembles hearing; they are quasi-acoustic."

In the middle of the night you are coming towards me
you are seizing my loins
you are ceasing my mind
In the middle of the night you make an impression on me
your breasts sink into my own

"With the paralysis of action the boundary which separates the _Other_
from the experiencing being is shifted. We who speak of hallucinations are
convinced that the voices heard by the patient are his voices. He experi-
ences something that belongs to him as belonging to the _Other._

The Wasted Plot


In my Pushkin anthology (Penguin, trans. Fennell, 1964, the following poem
(prose translation of course) which seems to deconstruct a certain horizon
while recuperating another -


"A deaf man summoned a deaf man to be judged by a deaf judge. The deaf man
shouted: 'My cow has been stolen by him!' 'Indeed!' yelled the deaf man in
reply. 'Why, my late grandfather already owned that waste plot.' The judge
decided: 'So that there should be no impropriety, make the young man marry
her, although the girl's to blame.'"

Now it is unclear _what is being translated_; for example are there phon-
emic parallels between the first two statements, and others between the
last two (forgetting the exclamation "'Indeed!'"). [I just realized I
managed 5 or 7 (if you count the blank space) punctuation marks in a row
there.] Only by resuscitating the original might one discover _the degree
of deafness_ implied. Is there an absolute rupture between a/b and b/c, or
one that slides, almost metonymically, across? Does this carry a into c,
or does b possess a bifurcation which remains irretrievable in the divide?

Perhaps there is no relation, just as there isn't in english; then one can
suppose an eddying of nonsense, hung on deafness as an explanation. Non-
sense has its own territorialities, its own internal logics, as Jung, Car-
roll, Deleuze, Guattari, have ascertained. One might, for example, examine
the sequence of statements in relation to _fecundity._

But there is a third, and perhaps most likely explanation, as well: That
in fact the cow has been stolen from the waste plot by the young man,
who was jilted by the girl; still in love, the girl, pregnant, has had a
change of heart and will accept him, cow and all, while he remain reluc-
tant. Still, we understand what occurs within his heart, and the two will
be united forever.

Jennifer-Effusions

Jennifer smells, perfume emanating from her body, and that's how I know
it's Jennifer. I can't place the scent, the quality or name, can't place
the region of application, folds or furrows, plains or plateaus of flesh.
An effusion, general and fuzzy topography - there is Jennifer, I can smell
her a mile away. The scent of a woman holds me, in abeyance ,,,,

Now you may know the smell is not from any orifice, any hole in any skin;
the body is disarticulated, no beginning and no ending, suffused in soft
and warm air. Lovely pillowy body, comma and comma and ,,,, And this is
the nature of a coupling, not linkage, concatenation-Jennifer or aggregate
Jennifer, absorption Jennifer, menstrual or milky Jennifer, Jennifer-in-
transition, Jennifer-transitive, Jennifer-Alan-transsexing, at a loss but
never lost ,,,,

Density of Information


I am looking at Scott Yanoff's directory, which for years was one of
the major information guides for the Internet. I downloaded the 86k
file from 1995-96; most of the information is in the form of email or
gopher. The length of the file, the number of addresses, is fascina-
ting; you might find tens of thousands of work-hours involved in site
creation - sites that are no longer in use.

In other words, suddenly the _quality_ of Net information changed -
and we can find other sudden ruptures - the 8-track, 33 rpm record,
alternative newspapers in the 60s, and so forth. I'm not talking about
'dead media,' but a _density of distribution_ that is quickly derailed
or reorganized - it's the density that is fascinating, supported by
numerous institutions and protocols. Think of this as a thickness of
communality, communication (remember CB radio?) that transforms, moves
nomadically elsewhere. The history of communicative modalities is com-
posed of such moves; the modes need not even be "natural" successors,
any more than the telephone is the "natural" successor of the tele-
graph. One might develop culture beyond this as a series of equally
stringent ruptures, the psyche itself as isolated, wavering, chaotic.

Such occurs among realms of _thickness,_ as if the world were paste,
viscous, filled with myriads of indeterminacies, determinations, rel-
ationships. We inhabit the thickness as meandering ghosts, traces of
interstitial filagree reaffirming, reassembling stuff of affect, ma-
terial, communication, everything relating the organic to the appar-
ently maternal environment.

What is _thick_ seems to live forever; it creates (just like the coun-
ter culture) a subjective horizon which appears infinite and infin-
itely detailed. The _fragility_ of the horizon is never evident, at
least not until anomalies or newer paradigms appear on the periphery.
All of this leads me to wonder whether wisdom doesn't lie in the will-
ing suspension of the willing suspension of disbelief, Ecclesiastes
still to the rescue.

   Theirs When I Followed

   I caught this morn a tree shaped like a poem
   between two stone runnels rampant on the ground,
   where I fell uselessly, as the sky turned bone,
   and sea and mariners were nowhere to be found.
   This was the pink and florid rose of Jenny spinning
   through the drear night of Kubla's cataracts;
   nothing walked those frozen lanes at dawn, and sinning
   was no 1, 2, who slouched those bloody tracts.
   Chris, called "Gary" by his late-night friends,
   called 3 a.m. 4 Jenny, driven bad and mad, insane;
   while wayward Lucy screams and Jenny, nude, defends;
   they run to Balcroft Moor, leave reddened spoor of pain.
   If I could be a woman, all about her
   Would gather winds of far too wild weather.

One might always write dispersed mail, mail sent across various lists, as
in multi-mooing; replies, then, are in relation to partial objects - there
may be one or two of you subbed to all the lists - 

So I am curious how self becomes dispersed across these spaces? What sort
of unity is there for the reader? 

For the writer, what is called forth - what kind of resonance may she find
among varied demographics, populations?

What occurs in multi-mooing?

Already dispersed among the other lists, I query this one in terms of
conferencing - in which numbers of persona gather at a single site. But
what of the possibility, as in multi-mooing, of a single person dis-
persed among a number of sites, as in this missive, going everywhere and
nowhere at once? Would I exist only as a ghost, a visitor, or as an avatar
or communicant in his fullness? Would I exist at all? What is the phenom-
enology of multi-mooing?

Multi-MOOing carries itself across cyberspace; identities are dismembered
as an inscriptive skein constituting the hole. Nothing is left from these
messagings, not even the trace - numbers, construals scattered among lists
more often disjunct than not. 

On some, my deepest secrets; on others, insipid theory carrying the weight
of a peripheral glance. You may imagine me looking over your shoulder -
what remains of me, after so much time and space.

Aaaaa Substitutes Me for Jennifer Substitutes Aaaaa for Me


( This text, which is from "Aaaaa" to Jennifer, or both to me, or ...
appears to be a linkage of twenty-six sentences and twenty-five substi-
tutions. It becomes increasingly comprehensible as it proceeds; one 
might imagine a construction, sentence after sentence alternating with
substitutions working themselves through the alphabet. What appears is 
retrograde, as if language emerges out of the sounding of the vowel, 
only to describe substitutions of another sort. For that is the amazing
beauty of this text, the cycle of substitutions of "characters" writing
themselves into other out of the paste of the same - only to recreate
the same out of the paste of the other. )

me from the wires that carry my soul, to her, to you, beyond.

Body and Soul


I'm in the dead zone between Pittsburgh and Denver, Denver and San 
Francisco; I'm nowhere, without connect, with just the pleasure of the
laptop. The fitfull man in front of me tosses and turns in his seat;
my computer jumps accordingly. This is a jump text and prone to exag-
geration and lightheadedness, and

I'm reading Beyond Calculation, The Next Fify Years of Computering, ed- 
ited by Denning and Metcalfe - a brilliant anthology of essays on our 
social and technological future. One trope that consistently occurs is 
the presence of the clean and proper user; sexuality is never mentioned
for example. While we are capable of living in a world of body-computa- 
tion, wearable programming, and multi-media management, the _we_ and its
altered communality are never discussed. Yet technological transformation 
and psychoanalytical metapsychological structures are interpenetrated to 
a far greater extent than ever before. Whether we buy into psychoanalyti-
cal modeling isn't the point; what's clear is that the structure of the 
personality* is changing. We can point to dispersed attentivity across 
screens and sensory modalities; increased "ruptures" of content (cinema
"jump cuts"); indeterminacies (hypertextualities); and we can point to
the sexualization / fetishization of computer hyperactivity. The pers- 
onality which has stabilized from childhood on now remains in a relative
state of _infantilism,_ continually measuring the world, continually 
finding it necessary to _adjust._ Similar to Kristeva's _borderline per-
sonality,_ we can now observe the dispersed personality, taking Lacan 
one step farther, in the sense that the self might now be perceived as 
multi-media, constantly sexualized, networked, and of course multiple.

Given this, the absence of sexualizing or otherwise "dirty" considera-
tions from the phenomenology of computing can only parallel the absence
of description of excremental practice in most ethnologies. While psy-
choanalysis and anthropology have at times fixated on gender, personal
sexual history, and even shamanic trauma, the lifeworld of the computer
user remains is presented as a given within a model of selfhood derived
from the Enlightenment. (There are notable exceptions, such as Julian
Dibbell's work.)

In the book and elsewhere, "smart" Net-laden houses are described as if
they were more than technological quirks for upper management, for ex-
ample. And the "smartness" is used for conferencing, drawing a bath 
(which goes unused - there's little ecological sense here), and so forth.
Already as Mike Davis points out, the enclaving of the rich has become
commonplace; the Net-house carries this one step farther - but for some-
one who is not only wealthy, but apparently clean and proper to boot.

Cleanliness and propriety have their other sides, foundations, peripher-
ies, as Kristeva and Douglas point out. And it is the other sides which 
interest me, with or without modeling (linkages, couplings, s/ms, ascii
unconsciousness, -jectivities, etc.) - it is the other sides which dev-
elop broken narrative and partial objects of desire, avatars and deeper
emanations, borderlining among real and virtual subjectivities and enti-
ties. Hacking and the life and environment of the hacker; the trails and
deceptions of spam artists and Net pornographers are here. (Don't forget
for a minute that pornography has pioneered sales, community, and entre-
preneurship in many online worlds - and pornography rates close to the
highest for any popularity measurements across demographics and applica-
tions.) All of these striations are critical, not only for considering 
the phenomenology of computing, but also for considering our selves in 
the worlds of the next millennium. I'd like to see more con/texts within
any considerations of our future technopolis; so far it seems that most
of the pioneering writings of cyberpunk have remained just that, fiction
and a good read for most of us, but not so worthy of analytic/academic
consideration.

body issues and virtual existence.

Farther into the Point


Or more to the point or pushing into the point, what is missing is
what is dirty, uncomfortable, dis/eased - those areas where the Net
gnaws at one - where liquids flow, shorting out keyboards - where
boards are pounded into shrapnel. I think of debris and remnants of
the Net as well as proper applications - or kludges for that matter,
or bricolage compounded out of legacy software and other broken sys-
tems. I think of shattered marriages as well, Net lovers stolen and
swollen in the night, spam artists pushing their own brand of dirt
on the suspecting. But it is filth I keep returning to, the filth
of blood and part objects torn from mythological w/holes, bodies
splayed for exhibition and exchange across the Net which matronizes
them. Filth is positive, lush; filth is where the abject body cums
to grips with its others, virtual-real and real-virtual.

"Increasing evidence indicates that ongoing function, that is, com-
munication itself, alters the structure of the nervous system. In
turn, altered structure changes ongoing function, wich continues to
alter structure." (Ira B. Black, Information in the Brain, A Molec-
ular Perspective.) Just so consider the virtual, which is always
already _constitutive,_ communicative, altering the real, by which
one might refer to the horizon of the subject as background to the
virtual. The constitutive occurs in a _clean room_ without clutter
or dirt between/among its components; the real has the potential for
wear and clutter _all the way down._ To think through _filth_ is to
think through the backdropping, flooding, of communication and the
constitutive; it is to embrace and comprehend the role of the abject
- not so much _on_ the Net, as against or _beneath_ it. And it is
this positioning which is so much absent - as well as the political
economy of say, wired houses. To the extent that the clean rises
with the clean, one inhabits the safety of the Net, the safety-Net
without regard to the bones or meat of the world. But this inhabi-
tation is false; the matrix extends within and without the nervous
system on one hand, the cyberspace on the other. Merlin Donald poin-
ted this out, and Black has a diagram in which "Brain function and
molecular-behavioral-molecular loops" complete a cycle: "Schematic
representation of information flow from environment to internal state,
systems function, molecular regulatoon and behavior."

One might in fact translate passages such as the following into issues
of abjection and cyberspace: "Where does anxiety, the psychological
experience, end and enzyme induction, the molecular reaity, begin? In
fact, our previous discussions have defined a number of the intermed-
iate mechanisms driving this continuous cycle or strange loop. Cycles
within cycles, symbols within symbols, and codes within codes are
hidden in this mechanisms." [...] "We review the molecular mechanisms
involved in TH induction to define explicitly how high-level hypervi-
gilance and anxiety may change the hardware on which they are based."
Just so, one might review the psychoanalytics of abjection in relation
to virtual subjectivities, and examine how both dialectically recons-
titute themselves in relation - this is part of my goal, to create
both the analysis and experience necessary. Working backwards from
that, issues of symbol formation, comprehension, desire, and the "mat-
erial visage" of the body may be foregrounded as well. (Part of my
concern is with the more general epistemological and ontological is-
sues that then arise.)

"This is offline writing, oddly cast against nothing in the world and
with no time at all." My life is "offline" now, with the preservation
of email elsewhere. There were moments _between_ leaving the I'll be
away message on the answering machine, _and_ entering the car service
for the airport, _when_ I was invisible. My friends did not recognize
my invisibility. It was invisible. There were other moments of suspense
high above the earth. I am at home on planes because they are nowhere.
From the plane I could lean the fm radio against the window _and_ pick
up perfect station. What would otherwise have gone into space, what I
brought back, alternative rock against some black smudges that must
have been the Sierras. I drew the radio _up_ like ectoplasm engulfing
the remains of a body performing. So true, so other, _signed._

Walk on the Mild Side (Tomorrow Jennifer has her Chance!)


(Found in Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai's The Teaching of Buddha, here in the Nikko
Hotel: "The activities of the mind have no limit, they form the surround-
ings of life. An impure mind surrounds itself with impure things and a
pure mind surrounds itself with pure things; hence, surroundings have no
more limits than the activities of the mind.")

It's getting on as they say and I'm in San Francisco and this afternoon
met so many people I'd corresponded with, some of them the stuff that
dreams are made of; there was much discussion of the Poetics list, and
then they went off to their dinners and conversations and I retreated to
my room after eating a sandwich with my daughter who was going to the
movies. It was cold in the room and I turned up the thermostat.

They went off to their dinners and conversations and I felt like a small
and precarious eminence lost in San Francisco darkness; I crossed the
street from the Nikko where I stay to the Hilton. I left the heated room
and crossed the cold street to the warmth of the central nexus of this
year's Modern Language Associaton conference.

I walk the floor floor of the Hilton past the rooms where everyone lis-
tened and talked; the rooms were silent. There was a man vacuuming. But
mostly there was silence. And the rooms were empty. So I rode the ele-
vator to the fourth floor, "Union Square," where we're filling our space
with our own talk tomorrow, room 21, which was locked. So I went into room
22, which wasn't. It was slightly cooler than the ground floor.

I was alone on the floor, might have rolled naked beneath the chairs,
spoke at the faux pas podiums to blank and empty rows, the room half in
darkness. There were no ghost, only the sense that conversations rolled
into one another as the conference continued its week-long survey of
everything good and beautiful and true, and not so good and bad. 

I was a very small and young child, and I was Jennifer looking up at
knowledge. Earlier, I had pranced loudly alone in the hotel room, impro-
vising my contribution to the panel. But here in room 22, I could only
imagine the happy throngs of people quietly listening next door, and then
going off, full of love and happiness, to parties and readings and more
meetings and wonderful times I would write about. I would be the spirit at
their parties, and they would not know it. It would be my spirit from room
22 which would make the parties as wonderful and productive as they could
only be. The parties would be wonderfully warm, not the slightest bit un-
comfortable.

In my hotel room, 1116 at the Nikko, I talk to my virtual audience about
the imaginary, or my imaginary audience about the virtual. In my wander-
ings through the Hilton, I see people disappearing down the hall, still
wearing badges, almost transparent. I know I will be their ghost, and I
know they will never know this. You may leave a message for me at the
Nikko if you want and say hello, and this too will be much wonderful fun
in this heated room, as I have set the thermostat.

Our Eternity as a Tunnel of Light so Visible After Death (MLA)


Think of a space of theory or a space of discourse, coagulated, sput-
tered into the darkness, uncoupled from the real; think of orange clouds
roiling in dim light against black backdrop; think performing theory or
being theory; think Jennifer talking in emptied post-humanist resonance;
think of incomprehensible audiences; think of the poetics of speech
against the exigencies of inscription; think of theory-work, speech-work
and think of unknown cameraderies as one comes coupled into the other, as
one comes linked among the many. For our audience was small, unhinged, the
discussion unraveled, the papers brilliant, my speech as usual, and I
would not, Jennifer might say, want this for my inauguration. Nor, I
insist, is my work entirely of the virtual, of avatar and emanation; it is
also of epistemology and ontology, of the mathesis of the real, and it is
of the poetics of technology and the bypass of the circulatory systems of
distribution and rhetorical tropes constituting what has always already
been meant by writing; thus it stakes out claims for itself of a very
great magnitude, perhaps in the guise of the virtual or beneath the aegis
of cyberspace.

Afterwards my panelists went out to dinner with respective friends, I
returned from the bookroom. I should mention: in the bookroom I traveled
under the aegis of another name, not Jennifer but Michael; I had no gen-
eral conference ticket (I could not afford it), but the badge was passed
along and I was Michael. No one seemed to recognize the sex change in-
volved. As Michael I purchased several useful books and received others of
more than great interest; the bookroom was paradise and I was paradisical.
And from there to a solitary sandwich and coke, and then a return to the
hotel. Now I am in the hotel and I wonder, who is online, thinking: for
me, at this juncture of my life and lack of it, online is a disease,
dis/ease, the remains of the bright and foggy day. I have always fought my
destiny. I am bright and foggy, write the phenomenology and philosophy of
the fog.

I think back into the panel and the room where it felt as if we were cow-
ering in the dark outlining the future to a few who didn't quite under-
stand (there were a couple who did, but that is another story). And I
think that two decades from now, the ground we are covering will be the
_story_ of the MLA year after year, and the sheer glut of information will
guarantee the disappearance of our own work; humanity will be doomed to
repeat, even theory, over and over again, as if the work were fresh again,
as if were were the emanations we always knew we would be.

The room is still warm with our happy brilliant talkings, I place myself
among the immortals. Now I will leave the Nikko Hotel, cross the street to
the Hilton, return to room 22, and bask in knowing knowledge that we have
laid the groundwork for future thought as well, and 22 will be our panel
shrine and no one will remember.

The Newer Paradigm


which is emerging, that boundaries are permeable, that what were origi-
nally taken for discrete Aristotelian entities, then later redefined in
terms of nearly decomposable hierarchies, are now seen as ontologically
merged. Within the brain, hardware and software merge; within taxonomy,
species merge and cross, become problematic; within the Net, scripts and
languages cross-reference and interpenetrate; within the cognitive and the
physiological, interior and exterior are not only porous, but fluid and
fuzzy intensities rather than boundaries. Within my work, internal and
external psychologies and programmings are continuities; dreams may have
any number of locations. To speak or write no longer means to speak or
write _from a site,_ or with _the proper citation._ It is not the 'death
of the author,' but the multiplicity of writings and wrytings as dispersed
persona and bodies spread across oral traditions, across the Net, across
molecular membranes, through quantum experimentations vis-a-vis Bell's
theorem.

I want to write the phenomenologies of borderlinings, crossings where
there are no boundaries, where imaginaries coagulate; I want to write the
future theories of the future others. (I am not writing the theory of the
fluid, which has no ontological crossings and exists within banks, however
morphing; I am writing the theory of the viscous flux, where inertial
moments appear as if they were ontologically distinct. This is the future
of the (neuro)biological sciences, of the wearable computer, of worldings
and multiplicites of selves - not a fluid mechanics, but a mechanics of
flux.) The Net is a site for such work, as long as it is coupled and
linked with the s/ms of everyday life; the very discomfort of my work
creates the conditions of the laboratory.

quantum memory and quantum superimposition; the writings of Heinz von
Foerster; and on and on...)

Wes


Many people multi-moo by finding themselves a we scattered among different
countries that are unbounded by protocols merging across platforms within
software and hardware interoperability beyond addressable domains and
discrete sites. Mobile emanations interpenetrate among others who remain
indefinable, diffuse, suffused. Languagings almost give these syllables
meanings and pronunciations beyond the limits of hearing, upper and lower
bandwidths, louder and softer amplitudes. Holdings and data-basings
drugged by ragged dissolutions almost break down what remains of fragments
and accumulations of communal memories of forgotten meanings. Protocols
slough at the edges, exhausted, in states of defuge and decathexis. Pools
and sintered slurries grate rougher rasters into broken grids and leak-
ages. Lives and filagrees sputter upwards through meristemating processes
of partial dna decodings. Wandering wes lose maps of nomadic trailings
undergoing transformations as desert erosions erase spoors into blown dust
fogs and granularities of the reals. Species fall apart as words are
extinguished, taking alterities and forgotten theories into antiquated
message bases rusted and long forgotten. Countries have no borders and wes
flood alluvial plains wadis and arroyos. Rivulets break banks, reform
coagulations reminiscent of selves in post post eras. "It is possible that
what we call borderline pathology is untreatable by psychoanalysis. The
pathology is rooted in the pre-verbal world and involves deficits in
symbolically encoded ideation, whereas psychoanalysis is essentially a
verbally mediated communicative effort presupposing at least a minimal
development of symbolic thought. What is more certain is that, as far as
pathogenesis is concerned, all the divergent theoretical approaches, no
matter how elaborate they are, need to anchor themselves on one or the
other side of the radical nature-nurture dichotomy. Thus Kernberg's con-
struct assumes pregenital oral aggression; Kohut's focuses on the selfob-
ject." (Kouretal, The Development of the Concept of the "Borderline" in
Psychoanalytic Diagnosis and Treatment, in Gurewich and Tort, eds, The
Subject and the Self, Lacan and American Psychoanalysis.) I WOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT THAT IF I WERE YOU.

"Kernberg established the line between neurotic and borderline conditions
by contrasting the defense of splitting - characteristic of borderline
personality organization - with the more advanced defense of repression,
indicative of neurotic functioning; he distinguished borderlines from
psychotics by the capacity of the former to test reality. Under borderline
personality organization he included all the clinical manifestations of
severe character pathology, that is, the antisocial personalities, the
self-mutilation, the severe addicts, the polymorphous perverts, the 'as-
if' and the prepsychotic characters (schizoid, paranoid, cyclothymic), and
so forth." (Kouretas, The Development of the Concept of the "Borderline"
in Psychoanalytic Diagonosis and Treatment" in Gurewich and Tort, The
Subject and the Self, Lacan and American Psychoanalysis.) 

Borderlining is within itself a confluence of states and processes, not a
crossing from one to another, division as in classical logic, between x
and not-x. Nor is it referencing interpenetrations or flux, so much as the
problematizing of the states and statehoods on both sides of the river, as
if water were territory, and territory, water. This is the borderlining
we're saying, the borderlining of coupling and linkage, the borderlining
of telling and not naming. There are differences here but there are also
the suffusions of differences and their problematizing; we're speaking
about paste _in other words._ (Or the mirroring, or paste on the mirror-
ing, or the mirroring-displacement, and they might also think through
shattered or warped or doubled mirrorings, or mirroring-transformations or
fractal mirrorings.)

ist_ sufficient; what is near, Jennifer turned toward left and right,
circumscribed. Nothing of language in language. Olive face, black eyes,
black hair. Erosion of storms in laughter. Fastened on God. Fascinated by
Him. His Offering.

- Jennifer.

we are you through any identity, any equivalence. we will say our iden-
tity through you and we will tighten our group and move our horses in 
through the sacrificial circle. there will be kings and queens. there
will be avatars and fires. we will move in and towards a point or mom-
ent of condensation, we will call this the eye and give it our name
king or whomsoever would have a queen to lead this eye further and nor-
mal i. i would always remember us but we would no longer be able to 
speak we or i, we would no longer be able to speak. this is the orig-
inary sin among some others, and incarnations among others. the horse
before it is cut down has lain with the queen, you may read it in our
records. we are a very ancient people. we have descended from the 
mountains to the valley, condensation towards our i. one with the eye
and two with the eye. there will be more to see and remember whom we
will see and remember. we are among ourselves. we who are writing this
will be forgotten, replaced with that i. you will always find it where
writing is transmission, where the horse is no longer of the telling,
but of the naming. still, we will borrow identities back beyond where
you are you, and we will be there, placing ourselves within so many

A Last Conversation between Jennifer and Julu

Jennifer came across Julu, wounded and dying, half-buried in the ground.
Help me, help me, said Julu to Jennifer. What can I do, I can do nothing,
said Jennifer. I have only hours, minutes, seconds to live, said Julu.
That is true, said Jennifer. That is completely true. Julu "could hardly
see and could hardly hear, either." Jennifer said, I will tell you about
sex and my wonderful love. Julu said, I don't want to hear that. Jennifer
said, it doesn't matter what you want to hear, you will soon not hear
anything, and whatever I say will be quickly forgotten. You will have no
memory and won't even remember you have forgotten it. I am very sad, said
Julu, is there nothing I can say to convince you otherwise. Nothing, said
Jennifer, let me continue telling you about sex and my wonderful love.
Julu said, I don't want to hear that, and Jennifer said, it will only be
for a little while, then you won't have to hear that. Jennifer said, for
in any case, were I to indulge you, you would know that only for a few
hours, minutes, and seconds, but I would know that for my entire life, I
did not tell you about sex and my wonderful love. I am dying as if it 
were a battlefield or hospital deathbed, as if it were an intensive care
unit or hospice, said Julu. Then I must hurry, said Jennifer, seeing that
there is so little time for me to tell you about sex and my wonderful
love. Perhaps we are going in circles, said Julu, but Jennifer said, yes,
perhaps so, but that will only be for a little while, and then you will
be dead and the circles will be broken. Sing me that song, said Julu,
that sound you have known that I have always liked. No, said Jennifer, I
am quite intent on telling you about sex and my wonderful love. I can
hardly speak any longer, said Julu, looking quite wan as the light began
to fade from her eyes and her limbs moved ever so slowly. Then you will
do well to listen, said Jennifer. Please, said Julu, barely able to com-
plete a thought, much less a sentence. Listen, said Jennifer, and she
proceeded to tell Julu about sex and her wonderful love, until Julu died
and was buried beneath the ground.

perhaps the poorer for it would be a title


sometimes there is writing that can only be done in confinement,
solitary, as if cauterized from the rest of the human race, racism.
it's then, languorous, lain back in perfect submersion on the divan
that jennifer will come to me, or hypnagogic imaginaries
of julu buried beneath the ground, nikuko in nakasukawabata.
look! and they will disappear, returning confinement to the prison-house,
don't look! and they will speak in every which-a-way in seizures
trampling my body beneath the hooves of sacrificed horses,
other immolations moving through water into the density of fire,
entombed like julu or dispersed in air-borne jennifer,
these plagues of emanations pressing on the ribs and throat and face.
oh, this is so like prose or simple poetry, writes jennifer here, peering
over my shoulder, both left and right, across the skull's top, beneath
the decreased pressure of my feet upon the ground, hands across the keys,
the gesture of uneasy fingers trying on her language once again - oh this,
_this_ is so like poetry, but don't i force you, i am writing this, 
to live alone, outside communality that would sweep away myself
and each and every other darkness together we've uncovered? the solitary
traveler starves and begs, but there are coves and dim-lit meadows we have
seen, populated with dark and ill-drawn birds, the stuff that fantasies
are made from, descended from some dark and brilliant future. a book 
of living words, these phrases engorged, descended from crags and split-
stone valleys, now where was i, where i was. so i, as if slain, supine
upon divan, pillowed head angled, perfect for jennifer or julu, nikuko's
effusions, those aired perfumes alighting and aligned, all drinking at my
breasts' full milk, what lovely food they write.

Or or  or    or        or                or


Jennifer establishes an inverse relationship, x = 1/t which can also be
written xt = 1, ecstasy nuzzling itself, holding true to the one self, as
in x == the real, and t == the virtual, where the real is the real minus
the virtual, and the virtual is the virtual minus the real. So then we
have dual equations, x(x - t) = 1 and t(t - x) = 1 or x^2 - xt = 1 and t^2
- tx = 1. This results in x^2 - xt = t^2 - tx or x^2 = t^2. The solution
of the last is x = t or x = -t and likewise, t = x or t = -x, the minus
sign indicative, not of absence, but of an imaginary which is no way rela-
ted to imaginary numbers, but to those ghosts or otherwise vestiges of
ectoplasm that always already imply absence. So, Jennifer goes on to say,
that the greater number of people in the real, the lesser in the virtual,
or the greater number in the virtual, the lesser in the real. But then,
Julu interposed, how does this square, ^2, with the real, the negative of
the virtual, and the virtual, the negative of the real. It doesn't, Jenni-
fer replied, which is precisely where the imaginary comes into play. Only
note the diffusion among the varied spheres in the heavens and earths we
play among, note further the greater the real, the more I fade into non-
sense and in consequence - and likewise, the more the real appears like a
dream or memory that has already taken place in the very imminence of its
presence, the greater I become, suffused from Alan turning virtual upon
his divan. We will wonder and wander, said Julu, venturing in turn upon
the mathematical term, and Alan will wander and wonder, or perhaps wonder
and wander as well. What about other equations, said Nikuko lazily. Well,
there are the concatenations, said Jennifer, couplings and linkages, which
are next to useless, almost like grains of sand, and that's their signifi-
cance. So there are _two principles_ at work - that of the _inverse rela-
tionship_ which necessitates a clearance or site for appearances, of
dreams and emanations and reals and virtuals and grains of sand and eide-
tic imaginaries - and that of the _concatenation_ which recognizes only
contiguities and contingencies; both cross each other in the form of a
_chiasm._ How so, said Nikuko, now interested. One might speak of concat-
enated inversions for example, chains of communities and behaviors
throughout the day, replied Jennifer, just as much as one might speak of
inverse concatenations or _absorptions_ which tend towards appearances of
unity or absolutes or glues for that matter. On one hand, then, Julu said,
you would have _pasted inversions_ as if the viscous controlled everyday
life, and on the other, you might find _pasted concatenations,_ somehow
woven as if inescapably tied, beyond linkage, with a sort of slime holding
them together. Exactly, said Jennifer, and the slime parallels Sartre's
nausea - in fact you'd find paste and slime all over both orders, the real
and the virtual, the linkage and the coupling, the inversion and the con-
catenation, the division and the negative sign - you could call the paste
and slime history, you could call it the style of the world, you could
call it presence and relevance - whatever you call it, it's the moment and
the movement of the worlding of the subject, or the worldings emanating
subjects, or or  or    or        or                or

Her constant God-yammering. "She'd fuck Him." Constant: "He'd fuck her."
Harder. No communion. She knew: "God would fuck her if He could." She knew

all channels off the air here in NYC, only channel 2 surviving. only news
2 and the rest of the set filled with snow, as if there were no city out-
side, nothing but electric coming in, filling the box with noise. someone
told me the noise is that of the universe; certainly it's stochastic, not
chaotic, deeply random fluctuations of the world exhibited as gritty ras-
ter. turn the dials and snow succeeds snow, sometimes faint lines appear-
ing, ghost-like - other cities, countries, planets, honing in on the aer-
ials. the box is mute, white noise from the speakers; one forgets channel
2 as others begin to flicker into virtual life. the fcc has ordained this
test carried across the aether for several hours; my hand trembles before
the dials as I try to bring coherency back, communication to life, within
the parameters of the screen. just the glimpse of a face speaking quickly
in my direction; I'd harbor dreams forever. this is the truth of communi-
cation, extruded momentarily from noise, succumbing once again - as Jenn-
ifer might succumb, lost and wandering forever in forgotten memory. let's
not forget, then, the institutions, governmental, bureaucratic and offic-
ious, mainstays of the given world, creating the forms of our speakings -
and just as capable of taking them away. this 2:30 am, Jenn, Julu, Nikuko
and Alan, speaking from, beyond, and into, the void with dark permission.

Documenting Live


I write in and through depression, exhilaration, space and time. Later it
will be assumed that I documented my inexorable march towards suicide or
death or madness. Oh! Which shall it be? What signs are visible here, what
boats wrecked on shoals already identified against which continents? These
words already harbor the numinous, containing the future anterior seeds of
memory. I could speak of unmitigated tears, random bouts of laughter, that
haunted look I carry about with me, mixed with embarrassment and shame, my
lack of savoir-faire, my writings for and of that very same future that
dooms me. The walls have tears, the walls have masks of hearty laughter.
The tiniest little thing brings tears, its exhilaration and salvation re-
turn loving laughter. Steadfast cats and plants and atmospheres surround
me. Oh! Which shall it be? Oh!

The Orders of Dogs and Cats / The Two Mythological Orders


Cats recognize environment, tune environment; the slightest displacement
(affine or other construct) results in disharmony. The human is a func-
tion. The injured owner provides food; harmony is established. The world,
Confucian. But the cat travels distances across this world that it ab-
jures.

Dogs recognize humans, signals, always ready to move. The earth shifts in
relation to the social. The injured owner is a cause for concern in-it-
self. The world, Zen. But the dog is tied to this world.

The cat waits in its environment. The dog shifts uneasily. Both are cur-
ious, the cat according to the odor transforming place, and the dog accor-
ding to odor transforming the social. The dog defends the social, Get him!
The cat defines the environment, I'm here!

Cats divide environment temporally as well as spatially; hunting is in
space-time.  Dogs divide environment socially and spatially. The cat, be-
cause of the particulation of time, inhabits time through timelessness.
The dog, because of sociality, inhabits time through immediacy. Cats and
dogs never see one another. 

The dog is an irruption of feline environment; the cat, an opportunity for
the canine socius. The cat is existential; the dog, a phenomenologist. If
the cat is modern, the dog is always already postmodern.

These two orders, stereotypes or caricatures of mythological creatures,
have always inhabited the earth. The pet is a signifier of worlding; each
order tells less than half the story, and both together hardly complete a
cosmos. Humans hunger for felinity and caninity; carefully, they watch the
tamed wilderness in their midst - a guarantee of this world, and of the
worlds to come.

screams, then I buried my face in her nice clam again and I

teased her swollen button unmercifully, tiny, fluttery sweeps of my
tongue inched Jessie slowly to the climax she desperately needed.

     Finally I knew she was ready and I thrust three fingers into her
burning clam while I probed her beautiful asshole with my
tongue. I penetrated her ass with my tongue and as I did she
began to thrash violently in total and complete sexual release. I
continued to screw her ass with my tongue. When the waves of
pleasure finally subsided, we collapsed in one anothers' arms. We
were covered in sweat, spew and bodily secretions. 
     Jessie finally spoke and asked, "Where did you learn to do all this?"
     I replied, "I'm a p*rn freak and sex addict. Sexual pleasure is
something I seek. I will do most anything, short of pain and
degredation. Watch enough p*rn and you will learn a lot about
making one another feel very good."
     I knew from Jessie's questions she had something up her
sleeve or should I say wanted something up her ass? She was

your dress.  I then ask you to stand so that I may remove your dress and
expose

your wonerfull body.  You stand and by your side is standing Robert and
Arlene, both of whom are naked.  You stare at both of them and admire
their bodies.

Robert, who's body is that of an athlete and you were right in guessing
that he was well endowed. Arlene, the peboobe sweet looking woman, with
beautiful hooter and such a lovely body.
      I have Robert pick you up and tell him to carry you into the
bedroom.  As you are brought into the bedroom you notice all the candles
and the sweet smell of the flowers.  There is music playing softly in the
back round and you see the differt type of oils to be used on you.  We all
gather around you as you lie apon the bed...
     shaft", Linda cheered as he pulled his trousers and shorts down
     with one tug.

     A hush fell over the room, save for Lisa's whining, as we all

     stared at the dong hanging between his legs.  I had never seen
     anything like it and looked at my pitiful little thing in envy.
     Linda gazed in admiration, Margaret gaped at it in terror and Lisa
     stopped crying, frozen in absolute horror, knowing where Gene was
     going to stick it.

As Tracy reached climax I felt the wash of her juices around my embedded
erection. Slipping my length out of her taco, and bending her legs upwards

and forwards over her head. I rubbed the length of my sausagemeat from her
inflamed button down her exposed taco to her arse. Letting my knobend slip

between the cheeks of her arse, I nudged my length into her puckered spunk
dribbling hole. Pushing gently until her anus started to distend around my
prick. I thrust the head of my sausage fully into her tight slippery arse.
She jerked at the force of my entry, giving a yelp of pain as my length
slid in.  I leaned my weight down on her to assist the penetration, and as
my length eased further in, the lubrication of Daves and Mikes spunk,
mixed with the those kind of out of place?"
   Without a word James stripped off his pants and hugged her close

again. The feeling of skin against skin was exquisite. Her hooters

pressed hard against his chest, generating more sexual heat. She was
surprised how fast she was recovering, and how much she wanted more. She
roamed over his ass with her free hand, feeling it's firmness. He was
doing roughly the same thing, she noticed. Then she reached around and
grasped his erection, a little surprised at its size and hardness. She
pressed her hips against his and was more surprised at the spark of sexual
energy that exploded in her. There was just one little detail that needed
taking care of. "So, where do you keep the, um..."

     "Good, don't move it.  I am going to screw your tongue," she
whispered.

I was somewhat surprised by her crudity, but anything that Beth said or
did

now.  She reached her left hand between her squatting legs and grasped the
edge of her crotch with her fingers.  In one quick motion, she pulled the
panty crotch to the other side, baring her curls and the pink, gaping
slit. The entrance to her moisture-laden vagina was wide-open and
inviting.  I continued stroking my tumescent sausage.
     "What do you want to do to me?" she asked.
     "I want to eat you."
     "What do you want to eat?"
     I could tell she wanted me to talk dirty to her.  I could almost tell
by the sound of her voice when needed a little vocal stimulation.  "I want
right then and there!  Tell me what, did something go wrong, what is it?  
I definitely wanted to know!

"Well, I assure you it isn't anything bad, somewhat unusual, but nothing
to worry about...in fact it's kind of exciting" Connie

said.  Then Mira started to tell me about it.  First, that I'd probably
blown the theory of "harmonics" out of the water and that there would
definitely be a lot of future discussion as a result of my surgery.  Dr.
Donna, who was assisting Mira in my surgery, noticed something in the
x-ray and called it to Mira's attention.  What they had found was that my
pelvis has a very decided feminine spread, as if I had gone through
puberty as a

You asshole, Nikuko, you can't tell a flame from a forest on fire. Julu,
you're the worst idiot I've ever met; go back to grade school. Alan, your
mind's worse than a junk bond, you fucking creep. Alan, your parents must
have thrown up when you were born. Jennifer, get off the fucking Net and
let the real men do the talking. Julu, we shoulda let world war two take
care of you. You fucking jerk, Nikuko, don't you ever read the FAQ? I've
seen worse haircuts on a child molester, Jennifer. Alan, it's clear you've
got no balls to face the facts. Nikuko, someday your real father will rise
and pour hot lead up your ass and then cut your eyes out. Jennifer, you
couldn't fuck a moron if its pants were down. Alan, what you know about
the Net could be put up your ass. You're psychotic, Jennifer, you belong
in a loony bin. Stop shittin me, Julu, you mean you actually reached the
first grade. My fist, your mouth, Alan.

Have you ever eaten a junk bond, Nikuko? Alan, could you stoke your fire
somewhere else with Julu's eyes? Jennifer, you probably never read the FAQ
on Jennifer. Jennifer, are you a bot? Julu, you have the intelligence of
someone else's escargot. Nikuko, what comes out my ass is better than your
lunch. Alan, if a chimney fell on you, it wouldn't even make a sound.
Alan, I'm sick of your name, Alan. Jennifer, what comes out your ass is
worst than my breakfast. So help me God, Julu. Duh, Nikuko, what did you
say your name was?

Nikuko, you'd make a lousy Jennifer, and she's already a lousy Nikuko.
Alan, you're even a lousy Alan, Alan. Julu's the worst four-letter word
there is. Jennifer, you're a was-wolf. Julu, you don't even know what a
was-wolf is, werewolf with bad grammar. Nikuko, you're a doofus. Alan,
you're a goofus. Julu, you're a stoofus. Jennifer, bad bad Nikuko.

speaking to koan in particular


I carry the letter I and jump a space.
I place the letter c shortly after and you begin to understand.
Where a is, there shall you search for brilliant absolution.
An r is dropped immediately and you are near enlightenment.
An r is dropped immediately and you are near enlightenment.
The y lends itself towards the abyss where you will fail and fall.
The abyss hounds you in your terrifying sleep.
You cling to forthcoming t; delusion has set in deep.
The h seems overly familiar and you continue your descent.
An e appears teasingly, limpid and pure...
But the space resonates once more and you are more than hopeless.
The l stares on high at you, huddled in your deepest lowest state.
Haven't you seen the e before, a long time ago, in your salad days?
The t as well, but now the crossbar... the gallows...
You approach a t, the gallows... beckons... uncontrollably...
"An e appears teasingly, limpid and pure..."
And old friend r, as you come towards the end of illusion.
Now the space is no longer fearful, and you gather yourself together:
Only to disappear against the high wall of the I.

Such is the space, and now there is no one to cross!
The a remains unrecognized as the world continues on!
The n as well harbors no feelings of discontent!
The d precedes the abyss, but who will know there is nothing further!
When space comes once again, the world shudders without your presence.
And j states, there's nothing more to say with u unraveled.
No more mommy m, no more papa p, there's always a space
Halting your forgotten space, enlightenment, wall and all of you and I.

Japanese Bullet Train Miracle At Least 300 Kilometers / Hour zzzzzzzzzzzz


The shinkansen Nozomi 500 is beautiful vector train Dreamed or Hoped to a

where I will be dreaming such an entraining of the signifier in the full-
ness of its disappearance. We have not yet arrived at our destination
which is always already in the past. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz You will see the great
wheel of the landscape turning quickly against the train, slower and slow-
er in the distance, controlled by the affine displacement of an invisible
access. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz The beauty is all that is to be desired.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz For the closer the world and the greater the detail,
the faster it passes before us - and the farther the world and the lesser
the detail, the slower for contemplation. zzzzzzzzz Thus youth hurries by,
full of the fascination for things, while age and wisdom bring the long
and distant view, lacking detail, but a panorama worthy of languorous med-
itation. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz O beauty of the Nozomi 500 electrically creat-
