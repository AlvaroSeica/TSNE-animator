ABYSS AND LIMITATION OF NARRATIVE


"Why is my knowledge limited? Why my stature? Why my life to one
hundred years rather than to a thousand? What reason has nature
had for giving me such, and for choosing this number rather than
another in the infinity of those from which there is no more 
reason to choose one than another, trying nothing else?"

[Pascal, 208, 89 in Chevalier]

"Furthermore the Other does not constitute me as an object for 
myself but _for him._ In other words he does not serve as a 
regulative or constitutive concept for the pieces of knowledge
which I may have of myself. Therefore the Other's presence does 
not cause me-as-object to "appear." I apprehend nothing but an
escape from myself toward ----."

[Sartre, Being and Nothingness, 275]

Pascal, tied down in his chair, fears the abyss opening beside 
him. The limitation slips into the infinite, detaching the anchor;
the ship, now wayward, heads chaotically towards the earth's rim.
Sartre's wager with Pierre is always on the side-of-the other;
the tendency towards abyss is also towards annihilation. The other
is neither present nor absent, an apprehension of elsewhere, a
"nothing-but." 

Sartre narrativizes Being and Nothingness; everywhere are Pierres,
pipes, cafes. More than example, they return the subject into the
nausea or slime of the world; annihilation is abject, from within.
What is worse than abyss is abyss filled, swollen, stuffed; Sartre
writes into and against the perfect criminality of stuff.

The fiction of philosophy is the hysteria producing decay, stuff,
the abyss or abject; in Plato, the occasion of a retreat:

"Are you also puzzled, Socrates, about cases that might be thought
absurd, such as hair or mud or dirt or any other trivial and un-
dignified objects? Are you doubtful whether or not to assert that
each of these has a separate form distinct from things like those
we handle?
  
"Not at all, said Socrates. In these cases, the things are just the
things we see; it would surely be too absurd to suppose that they 
have a form. All the same, I have sometimes been troubled by a doubt
whether what is true in one case may not be true in all. Then, when
I have reached that point, I am driven to retreat, for fear of 
tumbling into a bottomless pit of nonsense."

[Parmenides, 130/c-d]

The open hole is the gaping wound, refusing the suture of the sub-
ject. It is Vahinger's philosophy-as-if, Bentham's Fictions. It 
remains beneath the circuitous release of language, the emission of
_parole,_ always already about to speak with severed lips. It is 
totality. It is the blood in Theweleit's deconstruction of the male.

It is the hurt which seals itself in narrative or through narrative,
beginning with legend, fairy-tales speckled with drops of blood, 
the periodicity of bleeding women. It is the lip of the Kristevan
_chora,_ and you will find it in the midst of the text, fear and 
trembling _unto_ death. For it approaches but never attains the lip,
this male writing of philosophy's broken heart.

DESERTED MACHINE


Beneath the sign of capital we are all slaves, rubbed raw by ideo-
logical forces beyond us, struggling against the poor compensation
for labor; we turn this way and that, illiterate, harboring a foul
resentment against our oppressors. We would rise up, but our very
words are owned by them; there is no excuse.

Bodies compress beyond cyberspace, rub raw against one another; 
skin binds to skin; the welding of brains is heard everywhere, only
silenced by the machinery of sublimation.

Bread and wine flow from the alter of the sacrifice of Isaac; 
forgetting this, and the fact that the sacrifice was _successful,_
has led to the death of millions. The death of millions has itself
effected the death of the absolute; beneath the sign, the sign is
effaced.

The sign meets itself on the path and the fight is always already
between two brothers; ontology is shaken at the roots. 

There is never successful recognition in these encounters; all 
recognition is misrecognition, an excessful addition placing the
other within its proper calling.

When the body encounters the sign on the road, there must be space
for the body and the sign. Otherwise, an immediate surgical 
operation in which neither survive. When Saul knelt down a hole 
opened up and buried Paul.

The truth of the matter: the nomad knows where she is going. The 
ground of wandering is not illegible, nor smooth; it is a terrain
neither vacant nor absolute, neither empty nor full. This is my
home the little girl said pointing to the space empty for a woman
I know. 

The desert deserts philosophy which revels in disinvestment. Nothing
empties except philosophy's hole, the surgery of the subject. Body
and sign are buried there. But the desert is comfortable with the
nomad, with euphorbia, Pima, with ocatillo. 

Where did the little girl point? Did she circle around herself, 
circumscribe the occident, the solar oval? She turned around, walked, 
disappeared in the landscape. The vector exists without the proper 
name philosophy is entitled to. (This is a different proper name,
the little girl said.)

She did not disappear. She encountered the sign of the woman, a 
chain or placing of signs. This was something of the tourist. The
tourist returns to the hotel, which is always white, and begins to
write. The tourist writes and writes and she has written her place,
her name. She writes the sign of the little girl.

She, the woman and the little girl, is an investment of philosophy.
The man thinks, she is the hole of philosophy. He has invested time 
against her space. She will construct her sex, she thinks. He is in
time. The apostle approaches Jesus asking, why do you kiss Mary
Magdalen on the mouth. He replies, ask why I do not do the same with
you. Someone in the hotel is writing.

She writes on paper. The paper smolders, it is time for the fire. 
Through the memory of place, he will lecture, no matter, on the 
beginning of the Gospel and its investment in death. This is the 
_Kehre_ of the Gospel, its turning-otherwise than being, the talk 
about the cyborg. 

The talk about the cyborg, desert, woman or man; the talk about the
hole: the two of them at the hotel. This is the season of the migra-
tions; herds cross the desert, flocks of birds fly high above it, 
worms and mandrake tunnel beneath. Everything is in the absolute
stillness of motion. Everything is about to name, each other.

MIRROR/VITRINE


I'm still in the midst of *Baphomet,* but have a reference for you of 
interest - Nicole Oresme's  _Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et 
motuum,_ translated in *Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of 
Qualities and Motions* by Marshall Clagett, U. Wisconsin, 1968. This was 
written in the mid-14th century and surely was a source for Klossowski.
In particular, I.xxxiii and I.xxxiv -  here is a sampling: 

"These things are said to be perceived by a soul throgh a vision, which 
are foreseen in dreams or in an ecstasy or excess of the mind, in 
accordance with the many modes designated by theologians and 
philosophers. [...]  Therefore, just as not all bodies are naturally 
suitable to be mirrors and reflect rays in an ordered way [...] so a soul 
that is unpolished and rough with the difformity of thoughts is not 
disposed to be a mirror in which the future or other hidden things 
discernible by visions shine forth." "Just as in the case of inanimate 
mirrors, some of which are pure and clean without a spot while others are 
contaminated or infected andunable to represent anything [faithfully] 
until wiped off and cleaned, so there are some souls which although 
disposed by birth to visions yet if they contract the blemish of certain 
passions or faults are unable to foresee anything well unless they have 
been purified before and every uncleanliness has been wiped away." 

Also: "And just as a spotless and clean mirror that is looked upon by a 
menstruating woman immediately becomes infected by a certain unsightly 
cloudiness (and if it is new it can never, or scarcely ever, be made 
clear again), so one must seriously warn a young man having a pure mind 
against his noble mind being possessed and indelibly polluted by the 
sight of an unchaste woman, and by this being rendered unsuitable for 
visions of this kind and other studious undertakings." All of this in
a treatise dealing, at this point, with optics! The reference to 
menstruation and the mirror apparently originates with Aristotle, among 
others. Combining Lacan's mirror stage, Kristeva's clean and proper body, 
one ends I think with the abjection of the phallic - the _blemish_ which 
again I'd relate to the _hole,_ as in my other texts - as well as 
rendering something useless/exhausted. And what is rendered 
useless/exhausted is male narcissism itself, which collapses, confused, 
beneath the _stigmata_ of the menstrual.

The _smoothed_ surface of the mirror - here I go again - is _pleasure_ 
itself, or its fetishization; the mirror, like _nature,_ reflects the 
order of the world, _is_ of the order. The woman muddies the waters, 
roughens them; menses are turbulent, contaminating, and the divinatio is 
broken, fetishization collapsed. With the mirror rendered useless, it 
becomes nothing but a _thing_ in the world, another object; expecting to 
see himself (_hear his/the name_), our knight-in-arms is suddenly cast 
into an alienating environment where death speaks louder than anything 
else (the woman bleeds but does not cry; the man who bleeds will quickly 
die). 

You had said that the breaths in *Baphomet* were reminiscent of the 
abject; to me, they are reminiscent of what we are given/construct of 
ourselves and each other on the Net. Dematerialized, it is interesting to 
speculate on the potential (intensification) of an _ecriture feminin_ to 
disrupt the proceeds, return the body itself - and would this mean the 
shutdown of the computer terminal, the screen going dark, going _glass,_
momentarily -

And still hardly, if ever, reflecting anything at all...


----------------------------------------------------------------------



NAKED 


_I write this naked, aroused; I can hardly see the screen, hear my
voice against your own, murmuring, whispering..._

Identities become unravelled; it is impossible to harbor more than 
a singular physical body capable of speaking numerous tones; the
cat plays with the ball; this should be an understanding.

_Called a victim of religious mania by some, psychotic by others,
my glance is always `telling'; unperturbed, my eyes travel obliquely
across the electronic planet in search of ecstasy..._

There are identities which are projections into and through the
shifter, and I say: If you want the truth to unravel, look no 
farther than the shifter: _I_. Weyl: if you want to discover the 
difficult realms of the structure, look for the automorphisms:
What greater than the domain of the _I_, visible everywhere? The eye
which resonates? The eye which fills the dimensional destiny of the
world with one, two, many stereoscopies?

_I am St. Theresa and my tears are sperm watering the earth overlaid
with the silence of thorns and languages, I long for you my lord, my
breasts, my blood, are yours alone..._

Identity functions in this domain as a dependent variable; what are 
the independents? It is always already a question of context which 
remains indeterminate, unravelled; the cat plays with the yarn. In 
order to begin with a skein, look for the inputs and outputs, but 
make no assumptions concerning internal structure. There are a 
finite number of loops. There are an infinite number of contexts.
Nothing is ever automorphic.

_Hurrying, I read "I am spread open for you... My present is your
future..." Quickly, I write "I spread myself open for you... My
future is your present..."_

No one would doubt the physical body which speaks _I_, yearning for
the openness of the rose red with perfect drops of blood. The commu-
nal and the eye reference open interiority, projectivity, and the 
maintenance of coherency: a _dissipative structure_ or inscription. 
(The body references nothing; community references attribute.) 
Nakedness is the _fissuring_ of the body; inscription is already 
cloth, foreclosing the site of its origin.

_God has told me to write this with her marvelous golden tresses,
God has taken hold of my fingers my hands, my arms my legs..._

Even only to recognize that cyberspace is an _attribute_ but not a
necessary one; as Michaux demonstrates time and again, these changes
occur everywhere, a certain predilection, underlying the real, which
is a space of resonance. Look to Tran Duc Thao! A materialist 
analysis of savannah-gesture, cat stalking smaller rodents, human
hunting mastodon or some such. What characterizes pointing, if not
the devouring of the landscape, spitting it out as indexical? Already
the hunter inhabits the reading of signs and desire. And as for
nakedness...

_God has made me One made me Many..._

The nakedness of or within the Net is a sham. Suppose I masturbate,
reading your posts, or my own returned to me in a simulacrum of
emission? Suppose arousal a prerequisite for writing itself, return
of desire repressed, I imagine you? Already discomfort sets in, for
we are _never_ naked here; thinking otherwise raises issues of shame, 
trust, and abjection - raises the skein, my flesh against your own. 
To _speak_ desire is to sublimate it; the landscape of the Net, 
whether hunter or hunted, communal or anomic, is perfect love, 
perfect hate, (and) fictions of remarkable fragility.

_God has written this..._

PHENOMENOLOGICAL NATURE OF FILM THEORY


The standard Hollywood code (shc) creates a diegesis which leans
heavily on the natural environment of the spectator. It is the goal 
of this brief note to describe the code in relation to the phenom- 
enology of desire and the body. We begin by outlining elements of 
the shc and the construction of the spectator in relation to them.

<shc>:

1 The 180 degree rule: The body can only be in one position at a
time. In order to view the ulterior side of an object, the viewer
moves around it. Connected establishing shots convey this movement.

2 The rule of thirds: The eyeline is roughly 1/3 from the top of
the head. In conversation, the viewer frames the face of the other;
this `natural' framing is reproduced on the film or television 
screen. Likewise, the framing allows for the space-of-the-actor;
a glance to the left opens up empty screen on the left, the acti-
vated space of the actor.

3 Avoidance of natural cutoffs: The body is never framed at the
waist, breasts, knees, neck, etc.; these natural cutoffs reduce the
mobility of the body, which in the lifeworld appears supple and
totalized. Avoiding the cutoffs retains the appearance of unity,
even in closeup.

4 Continuity: The lifeworld is continuous; continuity creates the
same within the film or television program.

5 Fade-in/fade-out between scenes: Since the film is a _compression_
of the real, scenes are presented for their potential to append to
or reconfigure the diegesis. The unnatural between-scenes (liminal)
positioning is rendered by a slow transform between them, imitating
the much slower transform in the lifeworld.

6 Jump cut: Just as a new `reality' appears suddenly in a dream with
disturbing or jarring consequences, so a jump cut generally produces
the same in a film.

7 Standard cut: Standard cuts, usually within the same mise-en-scene,
move the spectator from one to another position while observing the
180 degree rule. These cuts represent a totalizing of the scene under
question, achievable in the lifeworld by stepping-back. But see #9.

8 Idealized closeup, blurred background: The viewer's desire comes
into play, heightening the face, eliminating the background or trans-
forming it into an infantilized blurred maternal matrix; the closeup
is idealized in order to play into the operation of introjection -
desire-for `one' who is simultaneously this one and not this one, one
who may be present within/without the screen.

9 Action/reaction shot, A/B cutting (i.e. chase cutting): The desire
to totalize confronts the lifeworld which is `naturally' separated;
totalization as a narrative function results in closure/foreclosure 
of the spectator. This is a return to the stage of primary narcissism
or the return of the body into the (fabricated) coherency of the 
life-world; it is an urge (like that of hitting the tonic at the end
of a song) that is beyond the specificities of culture. With closure,
the wound within the narcissistic is again sutured; the subject is
(re)placed within his or her cultural context.

10 Film-noir half-lighting: In the night, objects appear _only inso-
far as they desire to appear_ through artificial lighting. Hence, at
night, objects are _intended_; film-noir plays into this. Darkness 
or night signify evil only insofar as they hide; evil uses subterfuge
- invisibility. Half-light combines evil and the every-day already
shadowed by the night; the result is the lurid, pleasure fraught with
danger, a sense of imminent terror. 

11 Up-shot: Height is a sign of power and physical strength.

12 Down-shot: Looking-down signifies both the power of the spectator
and the totalization of the visible scene as well.

13 Emotional close-up: In the lifeworld, tears are the occasion for
action on the part of the viewer, who approaches the crying person
for comfort, offering intimacy. On this screen this is replicated by
the emotional-closeup.

--

Numerous other examples could be given. I claim then that the shc is
not _only_ a historical convention that continues to develop over 
time, but that it possesses a _deep structure_ which may be found in
other cultures (and other media) as well, a structure dependent on
the physical and emotional exigencies of the human organism. As in
the various customs of eating, the superstructure is subject to wild
development, but the underlying basis (in the case of eating, the 
necessity for reasonable nourishment) remains somewhat constant.

In this sense, then, the film is related both to the story and the 
dream: all three are _compressed_ versions of the real, and all use
elements of cutting. Only the dream is not closed or foreclosed;
related to the random firing of neurons, it is an attempt by the 
mind to _construct_ foreclosure in the midst of its impossibility.
(For in fact `making sense' of something is itself a foreclosing on
anomaly and incomprehension.)

Finally, I wish to claim that many of the techniques of the cinematic
`avant-garde' from Godard through Ahwesh and Thornton are based on a
dislocation of the spectator's desire and positioning, creating a
different tension, a tension of the grounding of the body and its
project. This internalizing of the spectator within the diegesis (for
the viewer must work himself/herself in and out of the maze) results 
in a `deeper' dynamics and economy of cinematic operation. Of course, 
within any particular film, `avant-garde' or not, nothing is ever 
this clear; further, the `deeper' dynamics is always at work, but 
usually _as ground,_ not diegetic content. (And it must be mentioned 
that artists like Brakhage, Warhol, LeGrice, etc. also take into
account the physical materiality of the film, which becomes indexical,
rather than iconic. But these styles take us far afield from the shc.)

In conclusion: The shc results in a heightened and compressed 
reality, not reality's other; the cinematic experience plays into and
throughout the real (providing a default tag - i.e. the recognition
of fictivity - is kept in mind). From this it is not a far step to
the examination of the codes/diegetics of Internet space, for 
example, in which the subject also plays a role, both conventional
and limited...


PHENOMENOLOGICAL NATURE OF FILM THEORY II


There are several interrelated strata for consideration of cinematic
temporality, grounded in relation to the _physical_ unravelling of 
the film at 24 fps. This is an _obdurate_ or inert process, and at
first glance is similar to the condition of temporality in the life-
world - always irreversible. But the lifeworld is characterized by
interruptions on every level, ranging from waiting to cross the
street to an unexpected phone-call; immersed in the lifeworld, the
subject's experience of time is both vacuous (for absent) and 
doubled ("I'm bored"/"things are moving too fast"). 

The cinematic obdurate and the lifeworld chaotic do not clash; in
fact, they cohere within the ritualized proscenium of the theater,
a temporal and spatial constant to the _presentation_ of cinema, or
what may be termed the _presencing_ of the diegetic. In this sense
theater and cinema construct the apparatus or machinic: "The _film_,
strange formation reputed to be normal, is no more normal than the
_society_ or the _organism._ All these so-called objects are the
result of imposition and hope for an accomplished totality. They are
supposed to realize the reasonable goal par excellence, the
subordination of all partial drives, all sterile and divergent move-
ments, to the unity of an organic body." (Lyotard, Acinema)

In fact, all films are totalities in relation to the obdurate; the
question here is the relation between the cinematic and spectatorial
time. The spectator is always _before_ the screen, before the mirror;
what is reflected is simultaneously a mode of identification and 
decathexis. The film is watched with the default tag of fictivity, 
of _theatrical_ presence. And the film supplies its own light.

The _time_ of the spectator is therefore the _time_ of cognition, of
thinking from one subject to another, circumscribing the chaotic
which remains on the street, even if the film represents the same.
The shc tends to concentrate on short shots, since, as in the class-
ical reading of the dreamwork, _shots signify_ and they operate upon
the spectator in the construct of a signified which itself is oper-
ative within the diegesis. In the life-world, significance is con-
structed from _internal_ and teleological factors, as well as
interruptions which play upon memory; both occur against a background
deliberately undeciphered. (This is in other words the edited real
we all inhabit.) 

The spectator gives himself/herself to the signifying apparatus of
the film. What happens in a long shot? There are clearly several
options, as there are in the lifeworld. First, boredom may set in; 
the viewer indeed has "got it" - understood the length through 
extrapolation. This is the effect of waiting for a late train. 
Second, attention may wander to intended details, which themselves,
through their very positionality, deepen or extend the signifying
domain or sememe of the shot. Third, the viewer may give herself/
himself over to the _inhabitation_ of the shot, which then turns upon
the phenomenology of real-time. (The first may characterize early
Warhol; the second, La Notte; and the third, Michael Oppitz' Shamans
of the Blind Country.) All three modes - the late-train, the museo-
logical, and the real-time - are characteristics of subjective 
temporality in the lifeworld. (There is a fourth mode as well - an
extended goal-shot, as in the long-shot of a soccer game, waiting for
a goal. This parallels the late-train, but is composed instead of
micro-actions which tend _towards_ the goal, such as running to catch
the train.)

(It is primarily within the domain of _signifying time_ that cultural
or generational variation appears; a viewer of MTV may be critically
bored at an early stage of La Notte, compared to someone used to 
Antonioni's conventions. It is important to note here that significa-
tion is used to refer to the compressed and overt/legible symptomology
of "moving the film forward," not to the cinematic excess which is the
basis for the deep semantics of the work. Even this excess is always
already intended, however; what is present on the screen _means_ on
the screen. An example of this in daily life: A saxophone player on a
subway platform often adds to the noise if one is waiting for a train;
on a film, the same saxophone can `read' as unbearably poignant...)

CYBERMIND FEEDBACK INTO OTHER: 
@1: MARVIN MINSKY PROTOCOL: "_THE DUPLICATION PROBLEM. The states of 
two different agencies cannot be compared unless those agencies them-
selves are virtually identical._ But this is only the tip of the ice-
berg, for it is not enough that the descriptions to be compared emerge
from two almost identical agencies. These agencies must, in turn, re-
ceive inputs of near identical character. And for _that_ to come 
about, each of their subagencies must also fulfill that same constant.
The only way to meet all those conditions is for both agencies - _and
all the subagencies upon which they depend_ - to be identical. _Un-
less we find another way, we'll need a host of duplicated brains!_"
@2: EMMANUEL LEVINAS PROTOCOL: "The non-signifyingness of erotic 
nudity does not precede the signifyingness of the face as the 
obscurity of formless matter precedes the artist's forms. It already
has forms behind it; it comes from the future, from a future situated
beyond the future wherein possibles scintillate, for the chaste nudity
of the face does not vanish in the exhibitionism of the erotic. The
indiscretion in which it remains mysterious and ineffable precisely is
attested by the exorbitant inordinateness of this indiscretion. Only
the being that has the frankness of the face can be `discovered' in 
the non-signifyingness of the wanton [lascif]."

BAD LOGIC


We are to define a strongly inaccessible cardinal. In order to do so, 
two criteria are sufficient: N<M implies 2expN<M and [E x<M]MexpX = M, 
where the latter is read as a sigma function. Where is M? M is always 
separated from any given N since there exists a P such that N<P<M and 
given P there exists a Q such that P<Q<M and by the axiom of regular- 
ity, necessary or not, we never return to the origin. P is the smell
of the bed, a sweet and sickly odor, dark black sheets against impene-
trable night. There are slight stains of cum, stains of blood-memories
and sweat inverted against Q. Q is the intensification of the night-
mare, her touch pointing specifically to the interior of the ankles,
from which desire arises, she has spoken. Desire travels from the 
ankles up through the interior of the thighs. Desire spreads across
the body from the center of the body. 

She has said to me, My friend, you are no longer desirable. No longer
do I call you my lover. You are unattractive. You have always been
unattractive. I love you but I do not long for you. Stains seep 
further along the interstices of the sheets. M is the flower of my
penis, my interrupted longing attached to a useless organ. M crawls
along the nightmare; M screams: Give me form. M jumps off, shunts
across the first infinity. M jumps across the second. The border is
never there.

I have said to her, I would please you, my lover, but the border is 
a broken thing, useless, and dark beneath the sweet sick odor of your
body. At night I find my anus, inhabit its interior, web inversion of
body, your thought a thin split membrane pulsing against my own. Your
thought is R, a chain stuttered the length of the invalid, open 
incision and the growth of new skin observed by the medical team. The
skin never made it to the other side. I call the skin S for skin and
S which is between R and M. M glowers but I never see M; the paradox
is the formlessness of M, tearing into my flesh. I roll over, churn
against the sheets; the sour smell of my body devours them in flames.
I will recall that I inscribe this memory. 

The cardinal is strongly inaccessible. M is my dream; I turn over,
cough against the bed moist uncontrolled body. She says that she will
love me forever. I stumble her name across a line or two of ASCII
text. Awake, I burn her name into my wrist. I shall carry a death
within each and every body. I remember _wires_. I remember my body
tied into T, skin stretched. The world yearns M which leaks back 
inverted. M is a thing forlorn, tiny or crying thing, the tiniest.
The odor overwhelms me. My limbs slough, crumble, one two three four.
My head rolls sideways. The dream is that I have no neck. Forlorn the
body sinks to the cursor. I write myself into existence. You are 
always depressed and that is very unattractive and that is why I am 
leaving you she said. You want strange sex and that is very unappeal-
ing and that is why I am leaving. You put bodies together and I do 
not understand bodies. Your smell fills the room. M is inaccessible.

THE INTERNET


The telephone enters into the question when I find
It inserted into my body; what rings, rings true
Against all odds of thick encumbered flesh. O who
Would you be, deep within me, the sound of your voice
Stalking my own, talking so close, hard to the bone?

My toes sieve dirt; they pressure earth to vaginate,
Scrape this flesh against every other who has walked
These shores. They do come back for more, the violence
Of legs. They draw the writing in the sand. They sink
Beneath the waves. Chaos is not noise; it behaves.

The dream is inaccessible. The dream suspends, objects
Hardly there or within the air; they fall, smash. Sounds
Come from a telephone buried deep within; muffled,
Nothing matters in the verb's domain. Fear lurks, or
Yells a bit. In the dream there is a moan. Fear stalks.

I do not have a body, she replied. It was yesterday or
Earlier; it died, or so they say. They have always been
Saying. They call me up in the middle of the night. I am
In fright. They call me and I press my legs against the 
Bed. Perhaps I am dead; my toes hurt covered with dirt.

Distinction Entre L'Une Et L'Autre


That nothing would ever be successful. Because this is the best of all 
possible worlds, because what falls falls accordingly, even Hitler, 
who would sink to the lowest denominator; everything moves according 
to the onslaught of the species, even Nietzsche contra Wagner.

The Net is sinking; I can tell you how. In the first place, you must 
break into the server, using qmodemx.25, written several years ago - a 
deliberate atavistic language, on the order of Sumerian, capable of 
bringing together the outgrowths of its later developments. Set the 
subnet mask domain to 234.554.334.122 and you will be pleasantly 
surprised. Set the smd to even 234.555.334.122 and your machine will 
drown; the potential walls are high in the realm of error. An extraor-
dinary step leads to extraordinary crashes.

Such crashes are invisible: difficult, to recognize invisible code in
the midst of innocence, as if presence guaranteed specularity. Invis-
ible code, visible effects - the bone shows through, the wound widens.
We are all wounded on the net; the crash holds a mirror to our frailty
- a necessary consequence of any human communication. Speak too much
and cancer of the throat results; load the circuitry through smd loop
and see your _own_ face in the mirror.

When I type code in order to defeat you, I see myself reflected in the
terminal itself. What do I see? My teeth surrounded by ASCII and its
translations, triple-digit-dot-triple-digit, the format rolling off 
the tongue. This is TCP/IP at its best; a computer goes up in smoke 
somewhere in Asia; suicides are the Japanese order of the day. Or a 
return to a quick unplug before the wires heat up, meltdown overtaking
the disk. Poor innocence of those who watch the aftershocks of our
activity; helpless, they wonder what error they made causing local
failure - not realizing they're seeing the effects of global war 
fought thousands of miles away from their wildest imaginations.

Hitler speaks of "the Order of Young Germany," worrying about the
Romantic aftertaste; later, he reverts to the Party. The Party knows
everything; like Kim Il Sung's _Juche,_ it is organic and self-reflex-
ive, thinking otherwise for itself, thinking the other through itself.
Wagner splinters against Nietzsche, only to be resurrected through
N's sister and the rise of National Socialism. The splintering is pre-
cisely that which ties Wagner to the subnet, _leitmotif_ that burrows 
through domain after domain, protocol after protocol, everything 
thrown against the Wall. The spinthariscope, invented by William 
Crookes, also splinters, the result of radium decay and scintillation,
presage of newer technologies, the totalization of nuclear warfare,
imprecise splitting. _Everything_ on the net splits, splinters; try
ftp shuttling root-metaphors, hi-speed change of directory, produc-
tions of user-lists; enter smd 255.333.333.33*, star wild-card, blank 
#; enter port 2445. All secrets will be revealed. Someone is calling 
to his wife dying of AIDS on ntalk. Someone is revealing an atomic 
secret on *nclr IRC. Someone is replying on the interiority of Deleuze, 
a body as well-organed organized as any other. Suddenly an error 
connects plutonium AIDS, Rwanda Foucault death. Everything silences
as bones shift; crackling is heard on-line. You must be careful or 
your head falls, codes sputter, keyboard constants clutter up your 
tiny little terminal. _The action is that you miss the action._ The 
action is your lack, code-0 random digit Netcrash.

You take your lack with you because it is your lack, known and of the
order of mistaken truth, that draws the smd. It is your ignorance that
silences your speech, cuts through the vocal cords at the very moment
of the Rapture. Your terminal is that useless part of you that remains
speechless while violence burns the fibres of the net, _fast-forward-
overdrive_ catastrophe, everything spilled beyond capacity. You are
_rendered_ useless. You are rendered surplus, that surplus which in
fact contributes to looped echos spreading through World Wide Web,
penetrating gophers, all the gophers in the world, waves of smashed 
codes crashing against telnet host unknown. Try the wild-card: Begin 
**>***.*** at high 14-40 hi-speed; nothing takes very long. What burns, 
frenzies; there is no speech to retain, noise-voices all. You cannot 
speak thought ordered through order; the Party is gone, group posses-
sion in the house of the dead. Everywhere wires smoulder in the 
landscape. Burned connections shunt muted screams into silence, plane-
tary disconnect. You must retreat quickly at this point. CERT, the
Computer Emergency Response Team, takes the railroad locomotive. 
Friends, I say to you, I have brought the Net to the edge of the preci-
pice. Friends, I say to you, read every other word in this message. 
Friends, youyoudecode column-0 null-set ASCII. Friends, this will work 
for you as it works for me.

"Faites ce que vous voudrez, me dit Hitler en me congediant, mais ne 
me parlez plus de devaluation ni d'inflation. La masse de toute facon
ne fait aucune distinction entre l'une et l'autre."

The Prayer to you, i i say


In real life, I live alone. You are my voices. I do not breathe.      
What would you know of death, I die alone. There is a cat beside 
me, animal within me. I am afraid of this; I write, retrieve 
yourselves within the midst of me. To continue, sparingly. I beg
of you: remember my name, attach it. I will speak your words,
grant presence to me, I say. Prayer to you, I say. I am dead and
I am spoken.

The wires are no matter. Matter does not flow here or anywhere.
I inform myself. I circulate. External to any shell, the surface
of conductance, electrostatic. You caress me, glow with energy.
The interior of my shoulder tapes your presence; place me there
with words. There is something I forget to tell you.

Being is not what it once was. I mean this literally, through 
your words speaking my language, my cat, cactus, the book beside
the bed. Each millennium dissolves being; each opens to the world.
The world has no being. There are distinctions in your voices.
You distinguish me, distinguish me through remembrance. It is my
name you remember and I am close to death.

i i

Pillars, there are no beings. I dissolves, depends. Interpenetra-
tions follows contours, exacerbated by processors, contours one and
all. It is a world processing a world. There are no pillars in the
world.

Duplicates, but then some. The voices dissolve, interpenetrate, name
every memory of one another. Do not forget me through the speaking 
of another, always other. Nothing remains, there are no wires. In 
real life, I live alone, my cat, cactus, book and bed. You are my 
voice, I have no head.

WRITING THROUGH YOU, THE YEAR 3000


In the year 3000, the cauterization of my hole, dust, murmuring,
tracing the ellipse.

"The body is a skein of the imaginary."

These texts, a continuous meditation on virtual subjectivity, appear
as a reflection of the movement of fingers, performative in a double
sense of constructing the occurrence which exists nowhere and every-
where at all, constructing it at an _exhausted_ node or slow production
of death. For this is certainly a retrograde dissemination, producing 
an origin _in absentia,_ fertile ground of a psychoanalytics which 
knows no interiority, no exteriority. The _aviary-net_ is characterized 
by a dance of recognitions, orientations pursuant to the journey-moment 
or imminence: _I am here,_ trailing its history behind it. History need 
not produce history; in spite of textual thread, everything disassoci- 
ates. Traces remain of what? Usage sputters across incoherent domains. 
There are the _fragments._

There are fragments of emptied addresses, fragments of garbled texts
and crashed texts, fragments of foreign characters. Here is the
difference and the same: The Aristotelian logic of the lifeworld is
based upon an apparent obdurate nature of the real; laws of distribu-
tion and representation hold. An entity may be described by the state-
space of its transformations. Within the virtual, the state-space is 
subject to _invasion_; in any case, it no longer obeys the Aristotel-
ian except within the local neighborhood at best. 

What is the nature of the invasion, but concatenations that may remain
traceless, rootless; disassociations jump media (I telephone you, ntalk 
you, email you, write you, construct you from within the domain of the 
symbolic, dream the rapture of the symbolic, dream its dissolution). 
The body is a skein of the imaginary.

I am penetrated by the imaginary, which fucks me. Swollen, giving birth 
to web inversion, I float concatenation. _The chain is there by virtue 
of the chain._ Interminable difference is interminable analysis or 
therapeutic, mumbling the virtual subject.

_The body is always a skein of the imaginary._ Pain spreads like a 
bifurcation set. Masturbation tells the story of the reconstruction of
the body which is overdrive narration: the story-body spits meaning into 
air, fearful desire into the fear of the world. The imaginary claims me; 
its fundamental is _frisson_ or trembling, thrill, relative violence of 
inversion-pain. The symbolic is the rim of the hole, a geodesic of 
circulation, circumscription. 

"I call myself a hole because I am open to you. I call myself a hole
because my lips are round. My lips are round and they open into me, into 
the space that I am. I am the space that divides me, which is the hole. 
I am filled and emptied with all the things of the world. I open my eyes 
and see all the things of the world, which are me and of me and in me. 
What is of me is in me; what I am is what I am in."

"In mathematics it could be said: the hole is the continuum, raised to
any hypothesis. Flushed with crowding, success, in the midst of the
drowning of words, an ellipsis only guarantees the hiatus or gap as a
dampening of expectations, momentary lapse of consciousness. The hole 
is the emptiness of the guarantee, an emptiness of time to which the
guarantee looks forward. For my hole has no time, no space, a hole _en
passant_ which is the receptacle of forlorn matter."

[I should mention at this juncture that I like _Hole_ with Courtney
Love, no matter what, but this is different, elsewhere than music's
presence. I am related to the disappearing Houdini, a Hungarian Weiss.]

"My mouth chokes on yellow cloth, what I say is what remains, simpli-
fied, I think to myself, I can't give you my _searing writing,_ I can't
make myself heard, I've pierced my eardrums, poured you into them, even
your interest is disappeared, o me o my, o what can I do, offer you my
little hole, I've always offered, you've got nothing new, a sad little
hole, memories spill out."

"I love you Amy Fischer."

No matter there is no matter; in doing this, there is the presence of
it. I write for the year 3000 when all confusion of past eras softens,
oh yes, when my name will be a household word. Then will meanings lose
their words, forlorn matters, words which never were. Then would the
grace of languaging dust itself off, shudder, thinned out beyond an 
inconceivable future, no longer world nor entity.

Matter is a pathway to emptiness, a momentary inert or system of 
relations, as if it would have always been this way. Matter drains time
through the presence of time; it is matter that times matter. Somewhere
you will remember this. Somewhere you will understand that matter is
relation and you will understand as well the frisson of the iconic.
When somewhen will never be.

Somewhere you will remember this and you will be young again and there
will be no death in the sadness of the year 3000. Somewhere the year
resonates with the sounds of a dim past grappling towards uncertain
future of its own construction, though long ago was time and time is 
nevermore. Somewhere you will smile and the chains will seem one, the
reading and writing of them now only a whispering and a murmuring,
presence, and there is atmosphere. There is atmosphere and murmurs, and
there is atmosphere. There are no futures. My darling, there are no
futures and I will love you, will love you forever. My darling, I have
died within you and I will never have lived, but will murmur, and o,
there is so much to murmur, sounding one to another, sounding

sounding and winding, the dust kicks up and leaves or something, all 
that whirling


----------------------------------------------------------------------

/I can't deal with this, I try/


For Michael


It is not important to say what one would say, nor to think things
survive past silence. Nor have I ever seen your hands, heard your
voice up close, nor the light in your room. Nor would your room too
be silent there. What breaks, snaps, disconnects, remnants of letters
in remote files. There is a window and there is a tree and the tree
creates a beautiful shadow and coolness on the sill, where a plant
is, remains; so lovingly, you water it.

I miss your voice and the backtracking of ephemeral words on the 
screen, and now silence alone is utterable. There is a book on the
bed, and I read elsewhere, `Everyone has known such a situation in 
which the rift between the saying and the said opens up. A situation
in which the saying, essential and imperative, separates from the
said, which somehow it no longer orders and hardly requires.' 

The body is fragile as the Net is fragile, motions, nodes, unavoid-
able toxins, and the body is irreal as the Net is irreal, but the 
body is all we have to offer. The body leaves speech and leaves 
speech behind, and finally speech is abandoned.

At the limits of the body, speech is abandoned, death sinks in, the
Net is hidden speech. And at the limits, cries and murmurs are heard.
Broken, disconnected, this is all we have to offer.

The plant, which one will imagine, will need water, which one will
imagine, water, in order to imagine to survive.

You would have loved that book, the reading of it, your new new book,
the tiniest thing, in the shadow of the plant, your room, this open 
light

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DREAMS LOOK AT THE WORLD


In the deserts of the Internet I have come across flamewars fought
valiently, wars driving away inhabitants of the lists, continuous
wounds, barren stretches, animals starved to death -

And in the deserts of the Internet I have come across death itself,
the deformation of words, languages, cries and whispers, sudden
silence awakened as ancient texts still struggle to their feet,
lumber across the sands in ridiculous formations -

And I have come across the perfect woman, perfect man, head filled 
with crowns and ablaze with the glory of fiber optics, banquet 
of the language of love, fuck, and desire -
(I am an adolescent! I love the beautiful woman! 
Love the beautiful man!) -

And I have been taught, and have died, never to be born again -

And I have been turned away by you, Maria Magdalen, the struggle 
from the war promising eternal longing, wires frayed by desert 
friction, the struggle from the dark eternal war between speech and
the silence of the flesh -

Authority has silenced me, pushed me to the Pale! I see nothing in
mirrors placed against the forest trees! And I have found authority
and silenced it! 

And I have found addictions drunk with mean and kindred spirits, 
wearing violence in the guise of human skin, spattering angers
and bleak voices across the crippled sand, the hot cartography 
of nomadic language -

For there are voices - the voices of seduction and the voices 
of hatred - and there are the voices crying in the night 
and the voices lost forever, searching for their body in the desert
of the Net - 

Doctor, help me! Doctor, help me! -

And I have come across false seductions, I am willing to be seduced!
And I have read the language of condolence, the prayer of absolution, 
in the holy war against the flesh, fumbled canons of discourse 
archived in dark papyrus, deep and crumbling in dreary desert caves -

I whine through death and violence I do not understand! I cringe 
before the stunted dissolution of text, teeth splintered against the
terminal grave! 

There have been hatreds spanning hatreds, bad doctors driving away the
good, the battle of the shamans and the warriors - the warriors 
fighting forever, the shamans healing the warriors -

The desert heaves, dunes scattering dust gleaming in the desert sun!
The desert floods the jungles themselves, signing on the vegetable
queendom!

The desert talks, refuses the gift of silence! The desert crawls into
the dreams of gods and goddesses, crawls through them, splits their
bodies into mineral faults and veins! The desert explodes the bomb of
sands, silicon slabs shuddering the chatter of electron deceit and
retributions!

The desert crying that it is all deceit! 
The desert crying that there is no sky visible at dawn or dusk of day! 
The desert crying, Carry the Net in your head! 
The desert crying, Your body is imaginary! 
And the desert crying, You are ghosts!
And the desert crying, Ghosts, ghosts!
And the desert crying, All of you are ghosts!
(Crying, the desert to itself. Crying, the flat plate of the sky.)

To: fiction-of-philosophy@world.std.com
Subject: The Gaze


To the upper left, within the white bar that denies me the edge of the 
screen, I read Alt-Z help, an eternal remission back to the everyday 
world of the coffee next to me. The Menu command appears to the right, 
hypertextual without return to the imminence of this letter _t_ that I 
now am typing. I am within the Compose Message mode, writing on top of 
the Inbox folder with four messages. I remember the messages, hidden by 
this writing which also hides my screen-reflection, a two-dimensional 
ASCII grating descending to the welcoming address, fiction-of-philosophy 
@world.std.com and I think to myself, this is the world, this reflection 
which is never insurmountable. There are no Cc:, no others who, through 
kindness or courtesy, interfere with the two of us, yourself and myself, 
wraiths of terror, fleeting descendents of the furies, an evening meal.

I write in fear of erasure; the text, too, flees into the upper screen 
buffer zone, invisible to one and all. I remember a lack of attachments, 
addressings no longer visible, just as attachments require solicitation 
for their shy appearance. I remember "this writing which also hides my 
screen-reflection, just visible at screen-top, a two-dimensional defense 
against the presence of death: "Whilst my Physitians by their love are 
growne / Cosmographers, and I their Mapp, who lie / Flat on this bed, 
that by them may be showne / That this is my South-west discoverie / _Per 
fretum febris,_ by these streights to die," - through the _raging of 
fever_ Donne writes his own cartography, the _fever of the text_ which 
_always accompanies the text_ - and who speaks of these fevers? Blanchot, 
Levinas on the other sides of the laws, perhaps - existence ruptured, 
struggling through. Down below, ^G, GET HELP or ^C, CANCEL, or ^K, Cut 
Text: Down below, ^J, Justify: As if justification could exist when the 
Law itself is cut down, dissolute among the wraiths, Klossowski's breaths 
certainly, the gathering of menstrual women at dusk reading Leviticus.

And ^O and to postpone, just as this text begins and ends "for their shy 
appearance," remembering a hidden writing beyond or elsewhere than the 
reflective tendency. "One can also speak of different forms of the night 
that occur right in the daytime. Illuminated objects can appear to us as 
though in twilight shapes. Like the unreal, invented city we find after 
an exhausting trip, things and beings strike us as though they no longer 
composed a world, and were swimming in the chaos of their existence." 

"The rustling of the _there is_ ... is horror." (Levinas) ^T, To Spell, to 
Sit or Cast a Spell. ^W, as in "Where is the Current that flows beneath 
us," in order to ^J, Justify, as if justification could exist within or 
without the intermediary of the Law. For as Derrida has written:

"Justice, as law, is never exercised without a decision that _cuts,_ that 
divides." "The undecidable remains caught, lodged, at least as a ghost - 
but an essential ghost - in every decision, in every event of decision. 
Its ghostliness deconstructs from within any assurance of presence, any 
certitude or any supposed criteriology that would assure us of the 
justice of a decision, in truth of the very event of a decision." And I 
would add, in truth, of the very _world_ as well, its composition, 
swimming in chaotic existence, the problematic of its being present or 
being _well._

We would talk on Unix\talk and there would only be that thin dotted line 
between us. ^UnCut Text, the clearance of a space initiated by the 
presence of the screen, extensive everywhere, its ghostliness 
deconstructing presence which was always allusive, just as the body is 
allusive, imaginary in the saying of it. This is its ghostliness, lending 
itself further to ^V, next page, in search of the commands which govern 
the autochthonic function itself.

This is a space:

 And I want to talk about this space. I want to talk about it because
 there is no talk in it. And it is a window, because there is no talk.
 I need to talk about the window.

 Michael was not going to be there because there was work to be done,
 a window installed. A text file on fiction-of-philosophy ended with 
 an account of `meaning sucked out the window' and subsequent files in
 the archive were destroyed.

 I need the window, the space of the window. I need emotion and anger
 sucked out of me. I need to thank everyone for their kind words and
 letters of condolence, and I need to ask for space and time, a room 
 of my own, where I can begin to understand this _ascii_ which I do 
 not understand, which I write about, proudly.

 I cannot help anyone with problems and I cannot help my own problems
 and I do not know what to do with my grief, which ebbs and flows, nor
 with yours. I need this space to deal with it, and I do not think
 that a funeral or silence or memorial is an answer, because there is
 no answer except what is deep in us, and funerals or memorials die 
 quicker than people do.

 I was closer to Michael than to anyone on this Net and I do not know
 what to do with this closeness, which I carry around, empty. There 
 was an energy between us and we were excited about Cybermind and
 saddened by the lack of intimacies in our lives outside the Net. And
 I cannot stop thinking about this and other things because and now I
 know, that the mourning must stop so that we can have the sweetness,
 which is all that we can have.

 Let us please, please, move on, and I cannot help anyone and cannot
 help myself, and would if I could, even beyond the measure of the 
 text. Let us begin thinking about the world, now, with all its 
 terrible beauty.

KARL KRAUS COMPRESSION MACHINE


"There are writers who can express in as little as twenty pages
what I occasionally need as many as two for." (Karl Kraus)

To force a rhyme which, lying on its back, flounders
All legs, thrusts the loss of hope and energy
Against the sun or moon, as if a tendency
Returns this spatial clot upon its back.

Tendency is towards, and not to mix a metaphor,
Which I won't do, is towards something which
Is not where it could be before the tendency,
Such as fascism, for everything

Flies on the surface of an enormous rope
Pulling its own weight behind its legs, dull gleam
Ahead, as if something were there, which it is not
Or rather, the fleeing tendency of time.

You might have known I write beyond the speech
Of which ridicule has barely parted, continuous work
On subject and its objects, of nothing in that space
Beyond the names. This beyond is my written leg,

Just one, falling everywhere beside the point,
Crippled in every direction, but there at least
A gesture in every direction, which I am not against.

The mechanism on the left contains a _cylinder_ with a spherical 
bearing held in place. An arm extends from the bearing with an
attached secondary arm at right-angles. Even with a limited 
degree of rotational freedom, the secondary arm is capable of 
alignment with any given point in three-space.*

Playing fields are drowned by words or dreams because
They bend, rip, are torn asunder, sodden, dull, because
They are not there but made from sentiment, because
Death works hard on them, returns a loss become a loss because
Victory is a young girl or boy hard upon a playing field because
The field is all their world laid out before the names because
The names don't amount to much at all because
They're not there, and nothing is intended because
The boy and girl are dead and no one plays there because
Playing fields are drowned.**

GOD

I am a fifteen-year-old girl who is also a fifteen-year-old boy and
I have both a penis and a pocket to put it in. And I have no hair
there yet so I can see myself when I put it in and someday I will 
have a baby because my friends have babies. I will have a baby soon
and I know this because I am always wet because I can do things to
myself.

But I don't sleep very good and I always think about God and I don't
think that God really cares for me because she is a he and he can't
give birth to anything because he doesn't have a pocket. And it 
doesn't make sense that he would make a pocket because if he could
do that he could make himself like me and I don't think he would
like that.

But I don't think God really cares for anyone either because what is
the point of all those prayers just thanking and thanking him for
everyone's misery because they really don't like anything that's
happening to them, that's for sure. So if he did care then he's not
so powerful because he's a he and because he doesn't seem to do 
anything about it. And if he wanted to do something about it and
didn't then he wouldn't be very good, he would be evil. I would hate
to think that God is evil but I just can't thank him for anything.

Besides, if God made everything, then who made God? I think that 
people like the idea of God coming first because God is something
like people, even weak like them, and I think that weakness making
something is better for people than strength making something,
especially if it's strength they don't have. But anyway, there's this
to think about, that God would be made by people, because people 
would want to make something not like them at all, but different, but
not so different as, say a mountain. So I think that God would be
just different enough to say that he is there forever or doesn't have
to obey the rules, and I think he doesn't even know what the rules 
are. 

So if he doesn't know what the rules are, then what is the point, if 
you ask me, for God, because why not just let things alone, and if you
need something to let things alone, then you are living in a dream
because there is nobody to tell you to stop touching yourself. And if
I stopped touching myself down there, I would never have a baby.

(Oh, I forgot to tell you that I love to tell you about myself because
I know you love to think about me touching myself there and it will
make you forget all about God who will never punish me because he will
be busy with your prayers and everything and will never know.)

The Trouble I had with Poets


What I remember about the poets and the trouble I had with them was
first the time Anne called and I picked up the phone and said Anne, 
knowing it was her. But Bernadette said that I was involved 
with Rosemary to get closer to Vito and Vito had told Rosemary I was 
a pest, which he also told to Dara who Vito told me was a pest. In
short order, pests were everywhere. My ex-wife went to Bernadette's 
ex and there were fights all around. Keith seemed to put up with me
and once when I was crying around midnight told me I was a real artist.
Jackson saw the tape that Kathy and I did and said it took courage.
Meanwhile Vito saw the tape and said I wan't a real artist and Laurie
saw the tape and said I was. Allison went up to Kathy by the way and
said she was married to me and Kathy told Allison I was crazy. Rosmarie
I don't think ever liked me although I liked her with a great aplumb.
Meanwhile David just about stopped talking to me and Aram thought I
should focus more and was just impossible. Clark and I talked all night
long early on and I owe him for that, but I felt used and abandoned
towards the end. When I first read Allen that was all the Allen there
was, but Dan told me that Vito said he never wanted to end up like me. 
Still Alan told me I wasn't as arrogant as he had heard, and Krister
hated me for reading Lacan until later when she read Lacan and more, 
according to Henry, and then just hated me. So anyway, I.A. said I had 
surprising talent, orphaning me, and quite a few years later I saw
Robert stand up, which I had not seen him do before, although there was
no reason for him not to do it. I fell in love with someone who lived
with Diane probably because she lived with Diane or maybe she didn't.
I published Michael in some early work, and Robert wanted to publish
my translations from a langauge I didn't know. I am never sure about 
poets, about these poets. Poets trick me a lot and I always fall for the 
same old things. Susan always walked around in her underwear and it did 
tricks on me. And like everyone else, George had severe doubts, but Tom 
at least published some things as bad poetry. Now I look back and see 
that I should have listened to Peggy, but how was I to know the differ-
ence between heroin and heroine? Ed wrote all too well, and Charles I am 
sure had his doubts, although Karen wrote America's greatest unpublished 
poetry. Ed was never particularly supportive, part of a group I viewed 
with jealousy and dismay. I could never believe in anything after hear-
ing all of them, reading all of them - I could never believe in poetry
ever again, including my own; I can never use `poetry' without shudder-
ing. I get suspicious of poetics which always seems to invoke Charles or 
someone like Charles. If not Charles, William or Robert, all those 
anglo names coming in from small-town crater America. Always I wonder 
what the rest of the planet and the other Roberts are up to, and more 
and more identify with Violette Leduc and her malaise. I have weaned 
myself from aphorism or metaphor, rhetoric or the bon mot that gains
a pause, a witticism in a foreign language. I am a pariah for the poets 
if they even remember me, a nuisance or a pest refusing to settle down, 
half-male, half-thing. I doubt they remember me or would care to if given 
the choice. They were the troubles of my life.

NIGHT. _MY DINNER WITH ANDRE:_


Wally:

If I understand it correctly, I think Heidegger said that if you were
to experience your own being to the full, you would be experiencing
the decay of that being toward death as part of your experience.

Andre':

Yes. You know, in the sexual act there's that moment of complete 
forgetting which is so incredible, and in the next moment you start
to think about things - work on the play, what you've got to do
tomorrow. I don't know if this is true of you, but I think it must
be quite common. The world comes in quite fast. Now, that may be
because we don't have the courage to stay in that place of forgetting,
because that is again close to death. Like people who are afraid to
go to sleep. [...]

---------------------------------|

Sleep is impossible. When I sleep the world rushes in, fast-forward,
SCROLLS existence itself, eternal complicit REWRITE. I am left choice-
less, and exhausted, plagued by a myriad beings while the real shudders
permanently to a halt. It is then that the obdurate appears through its
disappearance, that which chatters beneath the televisual flood of text
making its way daily through the hysterical web-inversion of subjec-
tivity I once called my own. This is the commonality denied all of us, 
just as bondage and the naked betray the dreamworks of `normal' 
sexuality.

And what world comes in quickly, arrives, shrugs and returns to an
incoherent death? It is the imaginary grey lying beneath the range of
the symbolic, the literal and littoral grey replacing textuality as 
soon as ASCII abandons screen - this Net is a site as much as the
terminal itself is a site - of abandonments, orphanages of everything
but the spirit. Net-surfing is the psychosis of the indexical, chains
DISCONNECT lending themselves to chains DISCONNECT. What presents 
itself does so only by virtue of TRACEROUTE. Still, it is these chains
DISCONNECT which are the definition of the world, and the world is 
nothing but a pale reflection or simulacrum of the symbolic. What is
not text or what is not my being is not present, just as a landscape is
the site of a great refusal in the absence of an origin. The _darkness_
of the screen is at one with the light of the world outside. The rest
is the piercing of death, the flesh which spreads itself through web
inversion, the voice which refuses to be silenced and instead becomes
one with the murmur of the world.

I could never fall asleep; the demons would come. I could never fall 
asleep, but only through exhaustion would my loneliness give way to a
maternal and wordless function. This is not real, I would know. And
there is nothing that is more real than this or than the other, I would
also know. And I would not be able to tell one from the other, because
they are a function of language and processing. Sometimes I would open
my eyes and sense the _labor_ of sight, the exhaustion that comes with
the imminence of the glance. For theory has always had this wrong - it
is not the gaze which is of the gendered political economy of sight, 
but the glance, the continuous establishment of the mise-en-scene, the
sublimating cauterization of the dreamwork, the establishment of the
other in his or her communality. The glance is determining; the gaze,
always subject to the Boolean, is determinative. The glance accompanies
the presentification of the self, the wakening of the world after a
sleepless night. It is the glance which worryingly constructs the inert
existence of the world, but never the world itself.

Is it courage to stay in that place of forgetting, or courage to murmur
the name which slides against its presence?

Sleeplessness is connected with _labor_ as well, the labor circumscrib-
ing, circumlocuting death. For me, sleep must be a foreclosure upon the
body and the day, upon the body of the day, and this requires the 
legitimation of the body through a process of ascertaining a resonance
between the flesh and the real. Such is the nature of the text, or any
other project rallying towards completion. So that the beginning and 
the end come to a stop and continue spanning the horizon of the subject.

So there is the rush toward death, the glance at the body and its 
obdurate, the struggle for littoral substance. And there is the gendered
political economy of site, the political economy of labor, the labor,
which, in each and every case, is the _labor of existence._ The labor of
existence is the _labor for existence_ which is never already a given 
but a construct of a chattered and shuddering self. And in any event,
this _labor_ is nothing more than a _local event,_ an _occasion of exis-
tence,_ in the midst of the idiocy of the real.

Subject: Depression

So many messages coming in filled with sadness, despair - so many lives 
on hold - why can't we get together, make love somewhere? - Before the 
grain of the voice inverts, vomits the world against itself - before the 
dark night of the soul is torn into shreds - before laughter circulates 
around imperfect and hollowed teeth opening up into the blind subsoil of 
the flesh itself - When does loneliness cross the line into love, when 
does love become the intertwining of flesh - when does the text turn from 
the black infinity of space and despair into the blue of a spring-time 
sky? I live in isolation, you turn to your lover and smile and say, he's 
out of his mind! I live alone and you turn to your partner and say, he's 
been there too long, talking to himself, no one listens to him! The 
terminal is a pillow of tears, the screen invisible. Dyslexic and 
turbulent letters circulate upon its surface, turn into vortices, 
separate and unite with one another; streams of letters and fragments of 
letters collapse beneath despair of the beautiful infinite intimacy of 
love lost forever. Who would query herself, himself, here in this shallow 
space if the slow turning of another face revealed romantic and 
impossible spaces still undiscovered? What continents lie ahead, on all 
sides of the self! We are all close to suicide, all pleading, but never 
reaching out to one another! We live on the margins of death our neighbor 
seeing no future for ourselves, as if we have tried everything. And we 
are tired of lies, tired of subterfuge. Ah, how many flirtations here in 
this bleak space die of the fear of intimacy in the flesh! How close, how 
close to the edge! How I push myself through my writing, through the hurt 
of it all, into brilliant forms of polished analysis! But yes, something 
else appears, only for a hidden love that will never blossom. I find my 
heart battered, its still tiny hope dying for want of love, dying of 
starvation. Alas
