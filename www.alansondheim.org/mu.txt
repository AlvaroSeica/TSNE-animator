turning 60 -


The last of days, I'm 59, I'm reading as follows - and
now listen carefully from The Honorable Jacob Willsey's Journal,
1831--1860, I'm not sure where to put the line breaks in (not 
the quotation, but this domain where history and thought
lose one another) -

On October 28, 1831 - "Mr. Clark sawed in the mill 1 week, pd. him $3."
Now listen, November 6, 1830 - "Clark quit; Warren went to Dryden; wrote 
to H. Warren in Pittstown; Gaylord on the RRoad at Tinneros; Gaylord went 
to Ithaca on the RR."

Who is Clark? Now again February 2, 1831 - "Weather warm and thaws today; 
people flock like pigeons to a wheat field to see Clark hung; snow runs 
fast; bot 2 pr boots and 2 pr shoes of Mr. Smith, Springville, Pa. for 
6.75." 

Then - on the day of my birth, 112 years early, February 3, 1831: "All
hands went to Ithaca to see Clark hung; carried a clock to R.  Jennings;
warm, thawy weather; I went to the mill and cut ice to save the dam."

The same Clark or another? The weather of ice, as here against the 
Susquehanna, merganser ducks around, ice beginning to break against the 
culverts speeding the water downriver, huge flows of free water.
February 1, 2003, spent the afternoon rephotographing the muskrat lodge.

Which Clark? Of this, no other record, the same or different? In the
Journal, accorded a mention, and now 1835, Utica, New York, near Ithaca;
William Williams publishes a new edition of The English Reader or Pieces
in Prose and Verse; selected from the Best Writers: Designed to Assist
Young Persons to Read with Propriety and Effect; to Improve their Language
and Sentiments, and to Inculcate some of the most important Principles of
Piety and Virtue: by Lindley Murray.

A select sentence: "Mixed as the present state is, reason, and religion, 
pronounce, that, generally, if not always, there is more happiness than 
misery, more pleasure than pain, in the condition of man."

Another: "Time, once past, never returns: the moment which is lost, is 
lost forever. There is nothing on earth so stable, as to assure us of 
undisturbed rest; nor so powerful, as to afford us constant protection."

Here at the dusk of my 50s, I wonder, who is Clark? The first edition of
Lindley's book was 1822; did Clark or Jacob Willsey glance upon it? In
January, 1859, on the first day of the new year, Willsey writes:

"1--Comes in Moderate. El Wilcoxen is about leaving of us & going to
Lisle.  Started the 14th with his wife, which leaves us destitute of
preaching. He has been here 11 years & I fear we shall not get another
preacher to supply his place soon as our church has run down & but few
members & they are more engaged after the things of the world, than they
are after their soul salvation. Oh what the results will be is yet hidden
in the future. I feel that my days are very few & full of trouble, And my
labour is about done and I have nothing but the promise of a crucified
Saviour to rest upon and in Him I put my trust, believing that He will not
afflict us willingly more than we are able to bear."

This next morning of the 3rd will be dark, black beyond belief; I shall 
neither see nor comprehend. Debility awaits me & I cannot call on God.

recent work, experimental television center.


alan and azure bat balloons and you know your arm tires, why, jennifer?

because i do think that you must stop your arm all by itself because the 
balloon offers no resistance but the air itself.

and the air, jennifer, how does that work?

it works all the time and just see how the balloon slows.

===

his tiny little penis whips around with male abandon. her breasts and hair 
fly against the balloon always struggling against the tiny air.

===

alan and azure walk across the frozen pond. thump thump thump.

why alan, says jennifer, i like the look of the sound of the footprints in 
all the exciting snow.

thank you says azure, i was walking just to his right and watching the 
microphone. it was most fun and look at the graph of the tilting picture.

===

azure plays with her balloon which moves against time mapping into space 
along with the body of azure.

oh this is fun, says jennifer, i see you.

===

jennifer asks, why does the balloon change shape, why?

because it's mapping against time mapping into space., says azure, i 
already told you that.

===

alan makes noises and waves his hands. jennifer says, look at the pretty 
patterns, why, jennifer.

because, says azure, all sounds are things.

alan waves his microphones and the sounds make things.

alan and jennifer and azure hear nothing because sound things are silent.

alan yells and yells and colors come out of his mouth.

loud blue! says jennifer.

===

foofwa dances on a space capsule lozenge in stars across his eyes leaking 
into a room he's leaving tracks, he's turning against time, he hates time 
into space. why, says jennifer, why.

because people can't live forever, says azure.

===

he leaves traces of himself everywhere, says jennifer.

===

they all play the organ very fast.

My Composition in Language


It is entirely irrelevant to the world whether we exist or not.

Nothing is relevant to the world.

Existential statements serve an evolutionary purpose, the reification of
the self.

What occurs in language in relation to the copula or self-reflexivity, has
no effect whatsoever on the world.

Nothing has any effect whatsoever on the world.

Self-reflexive recognition is a form of pointing-out or gesture, in the
guise of naming (by virtue of nominalism).

Consciousness, self-consciousness, is a defense mechanism.

There is nothing to 'it' beyond this.

It is a mistake to assume that consciousness exists outside of language.

It resides in language; it is a tool which occupies or declares nothing.

Declaration occurs only in language. Physical gesture cleaves the air.

Inscriptions transform the imminent world of the substrate.

An effect already exhausts.

Culture is built on the predication that language means, and therefore
acts and creates.

Words are nothing and do nothing. The performative is a contextual myth.

Alarum is spread by language, just as identity precedes language.

"In its early stages the ballet also yielded ornaments which moved kaleid-
oscopically, But even after they had discarded their ritual meaning, they
remained still the plastic formation of the erotic life which gave rise to
them and determined their traits." (Kracauer)

We speak to ourselves. We speak for ourselves.

We never speak. Language has never been 'employed.'

The self-reflexivity of language is the routing of resonance; all objects
and cultures are resonant holdfasts for our existence.

Neither objects nor cultures exist.

"The cornered vessel (ku) has no longer corners. What a 'cornered' vessel!
What a 'cornered' vessel!" (Confucius)

The ku has never existed.

Language infiltrates speaker, spoken, and spoken-to with its semantic
skein. Likewise, the skein does not exist.

Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are correlated actions in the world.

They have no relevance.

The correlation is nearly decomposable. Every speaking is a composition.
Every composition is an appearance. Every appearance is an illusion.

Illusions are subject to entropy and dissolution. Neither the appearance 
nor the illusion exists. What does not exist, disseminates, dissembles, 
dissimulates.

Our existence is an illusion.

The world is neither an illusion nor a copula. The world is all that is 
neither an illusion nor a copula.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world is nothing.

My Composition2 in Language


It is entirely irrelevant to the world whether we exist or not.
It is entirely relevant to us. 

Nothing is relevant to the world.
The world would not exist without us.

Existential statements serve an evolutionary purpose, the reification of
the self. Existential statements procure the world in relation to our 
perception.

What occurs in language in relation to the copula or self-reflexivity, has
no effect whatsoever on the world. The world transforms with each and 
every utterance.

Nothing has any effect whatsoever on the world. There is no 'world,' only 
a confluence of interrelated protocols and effects.

Self-reflexive recognition is a form of pointing-out or gesture, in the
guise of naming (by virtue of nominalism). Pointing-out symbolizes the 
recognition which takes place all the way back, beginning with retinal 
learning; the pointing-out is a consensus or coherency for others, for 
community.

Consciousness, self-consciousness, is a defense mechanism. Consciousness 
defines and procures thought. 

There is nothing to 'it' beyond this. It is entirely beyond this, beyond 
this and others, beyond community and communality.

It is a mistake to assume that consciousness exists outside of language.
Consciousness is a priori and comes with the first imminence of the world.

It resides in language; it is a tool which occupies or declares nothing.
Consciousness declares everything, internal or external to language.

Declaration occurs only in language. Physical gesture cleaves the air.
Declaration is always prior to language; gesture cleaves thought itself, 
the psychogeographical substrate of the world.

Inscriptions transform the imminent world of the substrate. Inscriptions 
are contiguous to the substrate at best.

An effect already exhausts. An effect is always new; nothing repeats.

Culture is built on the predication that language means, and therefore
acts and creates. Language is build on the predication of the dialect 
between body and environment; culture creates, and language follows.

Words are nothing and do nothing. The performative is a contextual myth.
Words are everything; every utterance is an active performative. The world 
becomes comprehension and comprehends through language.

Alarum is spread by language, just as identity precedes language. Language 
comforts and transforms house into home; identity is situated in language, 
just as alarum is subdued.

"In its early stages the ballet also yielded ornaments which moved kaleid-
oscopically, But even after they had discarded their ritual meaning, they
remained still the plastic formation of the erotic life which gave rise to
them and determined their traits." (Kracauer)

We speak to ourselves. We speak for ourselves. We speak only to others. We 
speak only for them. This is the erotic gesture of culture.

We never speak. Language has never been 'employed.' We always speak; 
language always employs the other as our master.

The self-reflexivity of language is the routing of resonance; all objects
and cultures are resonant holdfasts for our existence. Nothing depends on 
language, which derails the resonance of the world.

Neither objects nor cultures exist. Objects and cultures exist in spite of 
ourselves, others, and the symbolic resolution of language.

"The cornered vessel (ku) has no longer corners. What a 'cornered' vessel!
What a 'cornered' vessel!" (Confucius)

The ku has never existed. The ku has always existed; it is Confucius who
has disappeared.

Language infiltrates speaker, spoken, and spoken-to with its semantic
skein. Likewise, the skein does not exist. Language deludes the speaking 
of the body; the skein of culture exists a priori to language. The sememe 
itself is a priori.

Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are correlated actions in the world. 
Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are mutually incoherent; they signify 
the breaking of the world, the tendency towards dissolution. What they 
hold, is released; what they confine, is loosened.

They have no relevance. They are relevant; it is their byproduct and 
phenomenology, their glance, that describes everything.

The correlation is nearly decomposable. Every speaking is a composition.
Every composition is an appearance. Every appearance is an illusion.
The correlation falls to pieces. Every speaking breaks with self, world, 
and others. Every breaking is immeasurable. Every breaking alludes.

Illusions are subject to entropy and dissolution. Neither the appearance
nor the illusion exists. What does not exist, disseminates, dissembles,
dissimulates. Speaking is subject to joining. Speaking, by measure of its 
breaking, is substrate to appearance. What disseminates, dissembles, 
dissimulates, returns, assembles, seminates, within the broken of 
language.

Our existence is an illusion. Our existence is the only real.

The world is neither an illusion nor a copula. The world is all that is
neither an illusion nor a copula. The world coheres through the breaking 
of the copula.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world is nothing. Everything is 
relevant; the world is everything. The relevance of the world is the 
beginning of politics.

My Last Composition of Language


It is entirely irrelevant to the world whether we exist or not. It is
entirely relevant to us. It is irrelevant to us whether we exist or not; 
that is the truth to be learned.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world would not exist without us.
We would not exist without the world; we do not exist.

Existential statements serve an evolutionary purpose, the reification of
the self. Existential statements procure the world in relation to our
perception. Existential statements are a priori errors in relation to the 
world. They disguise our truth and the truth of the world.

What occurs in language in relation to the copula or self-reflexivity, has
no effect whatsoever on the world. The world transforms with each and
every utterance. There is neither transformation nor non-transformation. 
The world is an illusion of its truth.

Nothing has any effect whatsoever on the world. There is no 'world,' only
a confluence of interrelated protocols and effects. There is world and 
non-world; we are ghosts looking in at the world; we are ghosts looking at 
ourselves. To eliminate perception of ourselves and the world is the truth 
of ourselves and the world. To see ourselves by not-seeing ourselves as 
ghosts, that is the truth of the world.

Self-reflexive recognition is a form of pointing-out or gesture, in the
guise of naming (by virtue of nominalism). Pointing-out symbolizes the
recognition which takes place all the way back, beginning with retinal
learning; the pointing-out is a consensus or coherency for others, for
community. Pointing out collapses the world, just as nourishment and sleep 
collapses the world. To eliminate the learning before language, to 
eliminate language, that is the truth of the world.

Consciousness, self-consciousness, is a defense mechanism. Consciousness
defines and procures thought. Consciousness and self-conscious break in 
relation to the world; through the broken, light emerges, that is the 
truth of the world.

There is nothing to 'it' beyond this. 'It' is entirely beyond this, beyond
this and others, beyond community and communality. 'It' is already an 
error of perception; forget 'it' and the truth of the world emerges.

It is a mistake to assume that consciousness exists outside of language.
Consciousness is a priori and comes with the first imminence of the world.
Immanence is neither of consciousness nor the world; nor is immanence of 
language or the a prior, that is the truth of the world.

It resides in language; it is a tool which occupies or declares nothing.
Consciousness declares everything, internal or external to language. There 
is nothing to declare, nothing to emerge. Declaration is false existence, 
non-declaration is false existence.

Declaration occurs only in language. Physical gesture cleaves the air.
Declaration is always prior to language; gesture cleaves thought itself,
the psychogeographical substrate of the world. Declaration occurs 
everywhere among gestures. Gestures declare; the world emerges without 
declaration, that is the truth of the world. 

Inscriptions transform the imminent world of the substrate. Inscriptions
are contiguous to the substrate at best. Inscriptions are the substrate 
which must be comprehended to be forgotten; that is the emergence of the 
world.

An effect already exhausts. An effect is always new; nothing repeats. An 
effect has no being, no relevance, that is the truth of the world.

Culture is built on the predication that language means, and therefore
acts and creates. Language is build on the predication of the dialectic
between body and environment; culture creates, and language follows.
Following or leading make no difference; what goes before, goes behind.

Words are nothing and do nothing. The performative is a contextual myth.
Words are everything; every utterance is an active performative. The world
becomes comprehension and comprehends through language. The becoming of 
the world is not the world, and the comprehension of the world is not the 
comprehension of the world. Everything and nothing are nothing and 
everything, that is the truth of the world.

Alarum is spread by language, just as identity precedes language. Language
comforts and transforms house into home; identity is situated in language,
just as alarum is subdued. Alarum for what, alarum hinders, ties one to 
oneself, to the languaging and things of the world. Alarum ties one to 
identity, identity ties one to language, to the world. Break identity and 
alarum, that is the truth of the world.

"In its early stages the ballet also yielded ornaments which moved kaleid-
oscopically, But even after they had discarded their ritual meaning, they
remained still the plastic formation of the erotic life which gave rise to
them and determined their traits." (Kracauer)

We speak to ourselves. We speak for ourselves. We speak only to others. We
speak only for them. This is the erotic gesture of culture. Speaking and 
eroticism tie one to broken meaning, taken for the meaning of truth, for 
the truth of meaning. Break what is already broken, that is the truth of 
the world. Do not break what is already broken, that is the truth of the 
world.

We never speak. Language has never been 'employed.' We always speak;  
language always employs the other as our master. Speaking negates the 
world; speaking is always busy. In silence is the world's truth, after 
employment and non-employment.

The self-reflexivity of language is the routing of resonance; all objects
and cultures are resonant holdfasts for our existence. Nothing depends on
language, which derails the resonance of the world. Dependency and 
resonance, already an investment; eliminate dependency and resonance, 
eliminate investment, that is the truth of the world.

Neither objects nor cultures exist. Objects and cultures exist in spite of
ourselves, others, and the symbolic resolution of language. More 
hindrance! more hindrance!

"The cornered vessel (ku) has no longer corners. What a 'cornered' vessel!
What a 'cornered' vessel!" (Confucius)

The ku has never existed. The ku has always existed; it is Confucius who
has disappeared. Confucius exists and does not exist; the ku exists and 
does not exist. So many objects! Forget existence and non-existence, that 
is the truth of the world.

Language infiltrates speaker, spoken, and spoken-to with its semantic
skein. Likewise, the skein does not exist. Language deludes the speaking
of the body; the skein of culture exists a priori to language. The sememe
itself is a priori. Skein and sememe, all these structures; what else 
emerges? What emerges, does not emerge; what does not emerge, emerges. 
Forget emerging, in silence, that is the truth of the world.

Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are correlated actions in the world.  
Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are mutually incoherent; they signify the
breaking of the world, the tendency towards dissolution. What they hold,
is released; what they confine, is loosened. Coherency is the skein of the 
self; non-coherency is the skein of the world. Coherency and non-coherency 
are joined by others and the spoken-to. The world fragments among the 
assumption of contraries, divisions, typifications. Forget coherency; the 
world coheres. Forget non-coherency; the world falls apart. 

They have no relevance. They are relevant; it is their byproduct and
phenomenology, their glance, that describes everything. The description of 
everything is the falsehood of the world; the truth of the world is 
neither description nor non-description.

The correlation is nearly decomposable. Every speaking is a composition.
Every composition is an appearance. Every appearance is an illusion. The
correlation falls to pieces. Every speaking breaks with self, world, and
others. Every breaking is immeasurable. Every breaking alludes. Breaking 
interferes; what is broken, has edges; what has edges, longs for 
completion. Forget composition and decomposition; be a ghost! Illusion and 
reality, all the same, that is the truth of the world.

Illusions are subject to entropy and dissolution. Neither the appearance
nor the illusion exists. What does not exist, disseminates, dissembles,
dissimulates. Speaking is subject to joining. Speaking, by measure of its
breaking, is substrate to appearance. What disseminates, dissembles, dis-
simulates, returns, assembles, seminates, within the broken of language.
Breaking and coming together, as of the spheres, that is nothing.
Semination and dissemination, that is nothing but the seduction of the
symbolic. Forget stasis and process, entropy and non-entropy, equilibrium 
and non-equilibrium, they are naming, and naming is not the province of 
ghosts. Be a ghost, that is the truth of the world.

Our existence is an illusion. Our existence is the only real. Our 
existence is our non-existence; our illusion is our real; our real is our 
illusion, our non-existence is our existence. Be a ghost, that is the 
truth of the world.

The world is neither an illusion nor a copula. The world is all that is
neither an illusion nor a copula. The world coheres through the breaking
of the copula. There is no copula without division, a white horse is not a 
horse, pairs never unite, that is the truth of the world.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world is nothing. Everything is 
relevant; the world is everything. The relevance of the world is the 
beginning of politics. The beginning of politics is the end of politics; 
the world is neither relevant nor irrelevant, nothing or everything. Be a 
ghost! That is the truth of the world, be a ghost!

attention to itself through the remaining tethers - it's there that the
pain occurs, increases - breakdown of connection - one can't keep up with
the other - one becomes another - the other - internalized - cutting
through the skin - one of the cuts will kill me - most likely sooner than
later - it's that kind of life - :none:none:none

There cannot be the slightest doubt that false charges of sodomy are more 
numerous than those of rape, and that this is too often a successful mode 
of extortion. This is rather a legal than a medical question; but it is 
especially deserving of notice, that these accusations are very frequently 
made by soldiers and a bad class of policemen!
