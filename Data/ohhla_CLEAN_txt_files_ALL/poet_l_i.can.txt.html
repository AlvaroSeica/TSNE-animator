[Vocal 1]
I got bored with four beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore a more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
You'll see I'm not behind them or in front of them, I'm one of them
Started with a hundred, The Game spit 3 I said "Fuck It!"
I'm a have to show these niggaz something
Too easy, who'd believe me if I said that it wasn't?
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward Sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R.
The rhymes are raw, deeper than yours, you crawled before you walked but
didn't think about you thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport - I won you lost
but you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is "The Greatest Rhyme Of All Time" supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy, not many can rock with me, 10
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said "Nobody benefits, Everyone perishes"
I tell them this, They say "Here....it's time for your medicine"
Imagine being fined over a rhyme? For stepping over the line?
When I inspired Hova &amp; Nas
I listened to '44 4's' 22 times
"I Gave You Power" God stop my heart if I'm lying
You like Red or White Wine? Let's talk about it I'm buying
Let's talk about the children of Zion, excuse me if I start crying
The Art Of Rhyming? I've mastered it certainly, 20
surely I'll celebrate capturing it for my Taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To jungles in Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual Widow Murder - searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it don't coagulate
The sex magic won't work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud 9, look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis - a capsule in Space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language, 30
and my mystic manners, Rip spit bananas
Systematic Global geographic systemic Neo-synapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step In Innovative Mobility
Most emcees try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
but my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur, The skill of Germaine Father Author
Poor Pauper Pastor
more than a rapper, 40
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour, then a Taser
then a Laser, then a Maser, then a Phaser
Then something they call Scalar
"That is not dead which can eternally lie
and with strange aeons even death may die"
But why? Coup de grâce for the coup d'État
In a man made lodge the Moon Rays replace God
I think I've had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off, I promise you we'll just talk, 50
No biting allowed just bark, Don't run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests Thought, Thought manifests Words Actions &amp; Reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me, you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Black List Registry
I'm a scruffy old man, with bloody cold hands
on my arm is a tattoo of a sullied old brand
If I am not myself, then how would I be?
If I do not look tell me how will I see? 60
The Law Of Attraction is attracted to me
The Laws Of Poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still can't recognize myself
I don't need anybody but myself
when I'm rhymin' like this I don't need no help
But.....Thank you for your purchase, these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
at least from MY interconnected introspective perspective
the more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence, 70
You are lazy and you wanna' be the best? You crazy!
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip The Jacker spitting inside a Zero Vector System
Brain waves reveal High Yield E&amp;D Fields
Chew emcees like I'm eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggaz tryna keep it Pseudo Real
A bunch of fake King Midas' with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my Poems, 80
Mad Max beyond Thunderdome under Red Rock
It's no use if you can't use what you got
buried in a mass grave covered in bones
my cell phone number's placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
she better do it I don't wanna have to hurt you dude
I'll eat from the same portion as you
just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
I'm a Deer Hunter all year if I could spare summers
fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband, 90
wide lens wide mattress she's an actress this is Monster Ball practice
I'm Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing Knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I don't care if we're not the same colour nigga I'm your brother
I don't care what you say nigga you're a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind, Waves Bars &amp; Rhymes
motivated by the Stars that shine
only lower density life forms get lost in time, 100
I don't care if I make history, I wanna be a part of INFINITY
Look at what your SUN GOD did to me
I am energy, I am he spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for 5 miles
More rappers than fans, more vans wrapped than vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers, rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent, 110
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live, Earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in the eye
Poetically Paralyzing, Where Are You? Are you hiding?
No! I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are Space Weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so?
Tell the people, they need to know
And if you don't think so, you're a talk show hoe, 120
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say "I'm crazy" I say "SO???" tell me something I don't know
something my psyche profile doesn't show
I don't have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
the substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus? Answer me!
I approached the podium, and delivered my encomium
nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous, 130
they feared I would spit, they don't like when I bust
the mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low, they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out "NO...do not go!"
Where the fuck are you going?
400mph wind belts blowing, think for a moment
we got to wait it out, that's what the training's about
we have to survive, that's what Germaine is about, 140
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
and the study of celestial bodies, follow me
The sheer size of the Academia implied by the rhymes
lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted thru the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, Battle the hardest
take out Hip Hops trash &amp; garbage
tunnel boring and jacking, water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing, 150
tough, pliable, relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I can't rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
in a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
that evolved into a spaceship, that hasn't been made yet
cause I haven't been paid yet, not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
but Hip Hop started hating, I tried to save them they wasn't patient
160 Responsibility entrusted
There's only one way for me to prove that I love it
that's why I'm busting
If you pursue revenge, dig many graves
be sure to add your name to the list that you've made
Musically still producing, I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit!
Distinguished English and Sophisticated senses
in sync with the Talisman I received from the Tempstress
with these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
whenever I spit it, concentrate you can hear it, 170
I've almost perfected this
I'm one word away from excellence, when I find it I'll begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
when the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness, I'm bout to show you who wildebeest WILLIAMS is
you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic, it warps the time and space within it
the hours become minutes, the minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit, from the Sirius Star system 
To observe the Gods, my thoughts graduated to the Stars, 180
to infinity, listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the Battle Grinder, created by King Osirus
my psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
and sounds like Chinese fireworks
several million years into the past
a primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity, Number 2 is intent, 190
The Flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles, for survival
Always remember, meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the Eve before Hip Hop ends
and make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
then spit a rap that you can't forget, 200
Oprah Winfrey don't like rap
All I got to say about that is "She probably don't like Black"
I don't blame her, she don't understand it's only entertainment
she'd probably feel different if she wasn't famous
She Traded Places, and her opinions started changing
as Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist, if not racist with colour?
then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion, the legs of an eagle
the wings of a dragon, not the sigil, this is for real though, 210
I sit down and think, when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God, even I am stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead, that's not fair
who I talk to?, go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!

Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
THIS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN HISTORY!

[Vocal 2]
I procured a small piece of the treasure, collections from a former era
dating back to forever, the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law, I don't govern them, I summon them
speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet, woodwinds, strings, then the conductor brings the
drums in, fingers trigger the drum kit
Other emcees be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance, Hip Hop Justice, Rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered, liars are denied water, you still alive?
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon Trident Seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaris Trench detour to Ultima Thule, Let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary, patrolling the Open Sea
at U-Boat speed beneath the Tsunami, where I'm supposed to be, 10
industrialists, civilians women and children directly
military chiefs, aristocrats in the buildings
membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical Professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
co-signed by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
the results were blinding, Lyrics Timing
shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding, so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open, a shark begins to circle me, 20
instead of trying to murder me, it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully
next time I see it, it's going to have a word with me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Under an assumed Identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made, field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate eliminate
the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this, there's no challenge, 30
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly, compare me
to Dante Alighieri's Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit who's ready?
I'll need a volunteer, do I have any?
Next year I'll get my SPINGS a master space badge
after that I'll stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean 40
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
worm screw elevators, descending to the bottom of the volcano's crater
the Devils Chamber
"That is not dead which can eternally lie
and with strange aeons even death may die"
The leaders lies got me reassigned, my loyalty was redefined
they will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought, 50
I'm a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
we'll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
the Teleological Dynamic will enhance
watch me wet up you weed then bust up you teeth
make you run for your life like there is a buss up the street, 60
The Dr. and I would meet, at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health, Killing myself
rebuilding myself, nobody feel what I felt
modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
writing with a feathered quill, getting more ill
The woman who is there for, she will take care of you
with Nexium, Avodart, Lipitor, and Theraflu
Rap Music Profession Immunosuppressants
One question per second, One answer per session, 70
Hip Hop made me, Hip Hop praise me
Ain't nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy, BATTLE ME BABY!!!
1000 BARS NIGGA AFTER THAT MAYBE!!
murder, murder, murder, kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill, but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians, I do it for the soldiers
Raptors, Comanches, STRYKERS, Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW PRESCOTT 80
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit 'til the story is told
it's a gift, this story is a part of my soul
We shouldn't keep fighting, the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth, where will we go?
Starving in destitution, Dying for retribution
Why would you wanna' blow a hospital? You stupid?
Why would you not force yourself to make better music?
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
like something harder than Tungsten, break your arm if you punch it, 90
I ride on a flatbed chariot, 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter, the Lovecraft Craft Lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor, "I see excitement coming"
I raise my hand, lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming, I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied, I decide to redefine rhyme
to create product of an applied mind
They say "we're divided" I say we're small minded
right after I said it I moved to a small island, 100
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
to be a mini me version with minor abilities
7.83 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the Observatory summit of Mt. Graham
looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision, 110
If A is a success in life
then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
by summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic, ultra, electro, and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
you cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone, 120
The Pope shook, they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute, I would like to propose this next toast
to maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary, but tell me who's the beneficiary
which one of us will sing Hail Mary?
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when I'm touring, 130
Acupuncture point or plus, is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute, or debate
My face, is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing, from the other side it looks like it's opening
where am I trying to go with this?
Fire and Ash fallout, that's what it's all about
we must construct a shelter, and then build a wall around it, 140
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
it won't happen 'til AFTER the official autopsy
a good psychological environment for science
I'm memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers, 150
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
but I'm unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and Salutations, my equations are inundated with information
Electro Cranial Stimulation
Burn skin off face, burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration, 160
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble, the effects of gravity on my
muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do, I have always been that way
because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future!!!
Pulsating Lights and Sounds surrounds spirits
Bio Oral Beats, layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second, for Dolphin hearing
The Electrical Optical Coupling Gear is effective, 170
88 Kilometres above the planet
my rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me, I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
himself, GW I'm positive it's him
I proof read my writtens, eat a chicken with the skin missing
spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die, Now it's don't vote, Why? 180
Weed is now legalized are you high?
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
but not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr. Iconoclast
if you don't leave the bottle outside you can't pass
Gather the evidence, then give it to the President
don't reprimand him, ask him for help next, 190
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
we need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I can't wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web, everyday we are burying dead
every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
you'll never reach the end of it, 200
Fire and forget, rhyme for respect
I didn't get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
with passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter, why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
the spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined 'cause I'm familiar what greed can do, 210
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said, let it be written, let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
about the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!

Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
THIS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN HISTORY!

[Vocal 3]
I spit at a thousand KIPS - Kilo tons of Pressure
every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December, 21st 2012 is the code
it was placed on the Sun Stone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers, the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really , Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe? Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitoba's melted by lava
a team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war, and at least half of my
crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
all what we needed, we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
my verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready, dress right dress
not messy, my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
you can't contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes, ears, nose &amp; throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite 33 3's 33 times
for 24hrs, 21 thousand Nautical miles
ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth, when you apply it, 20
devine design, a miracle of Metallurgy
every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate, the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back, my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
as I co-create rap, 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets, I attack it
access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
they can't battle me so they'd rather embarrass me
by being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
as handsome as my unborn Grandson, Rip The Jacker
call me grandpa, 40 as odd as it may seem
the microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers, evaporated weed vapour, Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
"That is not dead which can eternally lie
and with strange aeons even death may die"
Meteors fall from the sky, The Mars God looks at my eyes
controlling my heart, controlling my mind
Oh Lord, Tell me what to do, Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored, 50
My pain my joy my thoughts I've passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought, Thought manifests Words Actions &amp; Reality
That's how it has to be
In front of me, on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me, 60
sitting down at the mixing board/round/banquet table comfortably
they begin to study me, by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely, I rose &amp; I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship, pulling me with planet like inertias
words blinking like the text edit cursor
my sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
layer upon layer upon layer unedited, 70
You lazy &amp; you wanna' be the best? You crazy!
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven, white hot thermal
external vision, Every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real, Germaine is a sage for real
My sigil is the double headed eagle seal
Normal life is not real, we are cogs in a wheel
we work we hurt we search we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
circular motion in both the para- and the hyperbolas, 80
Tiger Woods knows this, everytime he plays golf he shows this
A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need, I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb
Try to hurt me, I'll murder you, lay you down vertical
made your life purposeful, germinated the earth with you
My black goggles, are covered with Bat Guano
I'll hang from the ceiling and watch you, act hostile I'll pop you
Rap Music and those who listen to it don't owe me nothing
I don't want nothing from you, not even your judgement, 90
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster, never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldn't waste time reading that rubbish
it might turn you into a media puppet, but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
but poetry continues outside the timeline, 100
Unnatural battle ability, the enemy tried to imprison me
but they would've been better off killing me
theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the God called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm, grammar and composition
don't ignore me, ignore the fool who tells you not to listen, 110
to you it shouldn't sound like I'm quitting cause I'm not
if I am to continue it's up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind, tired of swimming against the tide
why swim or walk when I can glide?
Zero Gravity exercising, requires expert timing, for Sky Diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
an impossible profession
St. Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message

Sho nuff, sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck
Countdown 48 more months
Does it amaze me? "NO!" Does it phase me? maybe a little yo
gotta' find a way to generate doe
Promoter won't pay me what I want for a show
why do it for free when I'm worth my weight in gold?
Mind Body &amp; Soul inseparable, incredibly
proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring, lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
but they should be more important, 130
the diaphragm, the thymus
activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay, The Alcatraz Way
You heard what I say? These pigs gotta' pay!
I steady my approach, this supposed to be a NO FLY ZONE
Black Sheep Squadron with strobe light hoes
The Hurricanes eye's open
Gale winds blowing, Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out, how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out 140
the ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy?
the Quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper, breaths to draw Prana
in a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted, The bombing will commence
Don't be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
drawing mathematics, suspended in space as holographics, 150
Scientifically Quantifiable megalomaniacal
viable style it's like trying to ride a Bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because I've built a citadel
of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason? A Patriot or a Pagan
West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons
the propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
I'm waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle rap is just aimless entertainment
2nd round K.O. was one of they favourites, Fuck all the haters 160
My luck was crushed, I felt like they fronted
my heart kept pumping, I had to do something
I turned the page, wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal X-Rays, they say "I don't burn I blaze"
Don't look at it like winning or losing, in '98 it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit!
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
but right now my image stands still in a prism
my light reflects like a mirror, I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing, I'm preparing 170
Assessment and Planning things, should I put mustard on these sandwiches, a
fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase, constriction and velocity decrease
You can't Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis? Is it a flying Silver Disk?

so intimate when I write it's a sin, 200
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
there's no way Earth you can get around that
this is a no brainer, stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead I'm here to save it
pages upon pages everything I've created 
the bar was below basic, I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers, I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful, aggressive but regal
progressive to the people, I hope the words reach you 210
