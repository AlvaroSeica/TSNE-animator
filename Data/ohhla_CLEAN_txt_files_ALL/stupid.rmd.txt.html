[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Hey, Rem, it's nice to home, baby
They don't know what we do, man
Yessa, yessa

[Lounge Lo]
It's the one Yessa, keep the thing up on the top dresser
Get money, stay chubby like I'm Hugh Hefner
Roll dice, get a six, take the money, step up
I'm hot this year, like Porsche Cayanne Pepper
Ask the kid, if he know about my repertoire
Staten Island Popular S.O.N., dog, yes you are
I know Bust Rhymes, I know Redman
I know Fatman Scoop, I know Method Man
I milk this cow, the yes way I know how
Been up in the ghetto like shit, nigga, ooh wow
I'm on my Fishburne shit, like, ooh child
I'm from the Ooh, so what you gonna now?
It's my O.B., not one, but two styles
I know some chicks who talk some shit, crew foul
I'm back to business, but I gotta go
Now I had to come two for the showdown, it's Lo, nigga

[King Just]
Stupid, dumb, retarded, Mel Gibson, Braveheart it
For the dearly departed, Billboard charted
Starving artists, with the hardest at the target
Stop, this is hip hop, we shop at the market
Sales and coupon, nights on the futon
Niggas is luke warm compared to Chokearm
The icon from Zion, I grips mics like pythons
Viacom, Vietnam, Transform', Megatron
Cannon arm, holy psalms, fast like Rammadan
All around the world, the same song
May he live long, long live, who gon' stop the kid, nobody

[Remedy]
Swagger on, dagger on, stick you in the neckpiece
Rip it down, skip a round, hit you in the chest piece
Everything's cool, nothing move but the money
Nobody said shit, ain't a damn thing funny
My family abandoned me, sister stole a fortune
Mortals out the door, and reached out of proportion
Took the word extortion to a whole 'nother level
Infected by the root of all evil, she's the devil
Things are fucked up now, recession got a hold of us
What's even worse, fuck, aggression got control of us
No telling what I might do
Do it to myself, but first I do it to you, Sun Tzu
Warface, body of armor, bad karma
No more drama and impeach the Dhali Llama
It never seems real til it finally hits home
Let's see how you feel when you cold and all alone</pre>
