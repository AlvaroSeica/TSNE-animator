Layzie Bone - Big Hollis what up uhhh

[Chorus - Young Noble]
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
get ya money, fuck the fame - get ya money fuck the fame

[Verse 1 - Young Noble]
We never walkin down easy street
when me and Layzie connect it's like Makaveli and Eazy speak
that nigga Nob'gotta flow with a greasy streak
on the road doin shows - fuckin easy freaks
gotta know how to read the streets, you gotta play it for keeps
go for weeks with no sleep - Young Nob gotta eat
probably it's just the hustle in me
thinkin of ways to get paid and live comfortly
fuck with me Outlaw warrior - my Bone Thug brother
we ain't forgot about you Flesh N Bone carry ya life and live on
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
make 'em pay for all the days we was standin out in the rain

[Chorus - Young Noble + Layzie Bone: repeat 2X]
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
get ya money, fuck the fame - get ya money fuck the fame

[Verse 2 - Layzie Bone]
Do you really wanna ride, ride with a nigga from the East na, na, na
the city's and the steets all mine, mine
them hustlers stay on the grind all the time
it's designed for warriors and rebels to win
them physics and faith will get in
this life is a gamble how much can you handle(red - rum)
real niggaz do real things nigga get ya money cause it ain't no game
alot of niggaz wanna do shit strange
down to sell ya soul for a second of fame
takin from a nigga that be grippin a cane
for the love of the money nigga that's the aim
run into some shit that you can't explain
nigga out the door and nigga you'se to blame
oh well on to the next young nigga with the next flow - put the medal to metal
better learn how to move and strive cause you gotta survive when you comin from the ghetto
better get on the level cause this is the business if you want the money mayne
we ain't playin with you niggaz out here if you owe me dogg you better run it mayne

[Chorus - Young Noble + Layzie Bone: repeat 2X]
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
get ya money, fuck the fame - get ya money fuck the fame

[Verse 3 - Young Noble]
Young niggaz playin the stoop - playin some Wu
learnin to shoot, stolen cars clutchin the Coupe
walkin around all day like it's nothin to do
ain't no time to waste my mind on pay, not playin a fool
for playin it cool try to capalize I done payed my dues
walk around in my shoes feel like I'm destined to lose
I seen the best of us go way too soon, I'm glad that I know my time ain't through
these young niggaz ain't playin by the rules look and learn a thing or two

[Verse 4 - Layzie Bone]
They run in ya crib and they go in ya pockets dogg - young niggaz ain't ready for war
we been doing this shit since 'Pac and Eazy y'all better just open the door
anything else will get you handled dogg might as well turn them camera's off
when national (?) was lookin at y'all now I'm a make it to where you can never floss
y'all niggaz is soft and lame to be and I'm comin to change this industry
back to the way it use to be when niggaz was really out runnin them streets
y'all niggaz be practicin tuck and hide - we them killas nigga we buck and ride
I say what I say and that's from inside - real thug shit nigga never die

[Chorus - Young Noble + Layzie Bone: repeat 2X]
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
young soliders in the game - get ya money fuck the fame
get ya money, fuck the fame - get ya money fuck the fame</pre>
