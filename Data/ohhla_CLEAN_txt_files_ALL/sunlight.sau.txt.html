[Saul Williams - singing]
Get it right {*6X*}
Get it right {*7X*}

Now every single day, I walk through my mind warp
It feel like a time warp, 'til the viewing distort
'Nough respect in Texas, 'nough respect in France
Music heightens poetry, meaning makes me dance
I wanna do what they say they be doing
I don't know where their nature went but they say it
They say they never write, not quite, they never have time for it
Well, what you got time for? I got plenty of time
Cause you got nothin but time, and you got money
I know, the truth Money and you know it
How come you never write that? Write that~! You can make it better
Their verses make me yawn, Jack, you can knit a sweater
Nah nigga fuck that, you can do it better
This shit is alchemy, you can change weather
And I'm a storm that, made that, G5
Crack jive, 'til I, feel I, 'til I
Get it right {*7X*}
Get it right {*7X*}

Now if I get it right, will you stay with me tonight?
And if I get it wrong, will it be a simple song?
Standing, in a room full of questions
Stripped down naked, furniture looks like suggestions
Now should I sit down, lay back, fuck that
Brave that, kick snare, high hat, 'til I
Get it right {*7X*} get get get
Get it right {*7X*}

Now don't stop - get it, get it
We won't - let it, let it
Become a playground for, business men
They got flu and I ain't, feeling them
Been writing poems and then, healing them
And on the day when the birds started singing
the call of love, the call of love
And on the eve of the day when 
the bees spoke in swarms, the bees spoke in swarms
And on the morn of the day when the bulldozer took the farm
And on the volcanic sunlight that bursts through their home

Get it right {*7X*} get get get
Get it right {*7X*}
Get it right {*7X*}
Get it right {*7X*}</pre>
