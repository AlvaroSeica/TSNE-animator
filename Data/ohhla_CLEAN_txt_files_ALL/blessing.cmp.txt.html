Iâm gone sing to your girlfriend cause she like it
Okay now baby girl you know exactly whatâs going on
Yeah
Still searching for what you canât find and oh its been so long
Whoaa ohh oh

But you ainât got to tell nobody
I know what you feel inside
Come ride like a Maserati
I can be your man on the side

Yeah I love when your body on top of me
When I'm deep inside no stopping me
Imma hit it so good you'll be proud of me
We can do what you want but donât lie to me

Want you to know you're a
Blessing [x6]

Blessing [x6]
Want you to know that you are a
Blessing [x6]

Blessing [x6]

The way you walk you got it
The way you talk you got it
The way you smile you got it
And you donât take shit from nobody

I know you a bad little chick that I met right around the way
I see your mind want you to leave, but your heart telling you to stay

You ainât got to cry no more, you ainât got you cry no more
I ainât telling you Iâm perfect but for you Iâll go to war (yeah)
So Let me know now, tell me how you feel
Cause whatever you donât do, another women will (true)
But donât get me wrong, donât think Iâm forcing you, no
You know how it go we can take shit slow

Want you to know that youâre a

Blessing [x6]

The way you talk you got it
The way you smile you got it
And you donât take shit from nobody
