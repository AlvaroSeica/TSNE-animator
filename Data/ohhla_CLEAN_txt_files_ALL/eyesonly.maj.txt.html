[Madam Majestic]
I don't believe your eyes
I do believe they are lies...
Words that you tellin' me...
These words I do despise
You seem to recognize...
You want me to believe
Snap for you, it's a wrap for you
Put a slap to you...
And I'll clap your crew, now I'm back for you...
I don't believe your eyes
I do believe they are lies...
Words that you tellin' me...

[Chorus: Madam Majestic]
Da-da-da-da....
Da... da... da-dudda-da
Da-da-da-da....
Da... da... da-dudda-da

"M... 12..."

"M... 12..."

"M... 12..."

[Madam Majestic]
I know the reasons why
No time to comprimise
And be how we used to be...
Not here to change my mind
This is the end of time...
And you're still here with me

[Chorus]

[Outro: Madam Majestic]
You're still here with me...
I don't believe your eyes...
I do believe they are lies...</pre>
