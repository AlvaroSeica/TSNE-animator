I don't need you, but I was thinking there's something about you, I d like to know
lets keep it good, lets keep it good

I don't want to tag, I'm guessing that time will tell
I guess my hearts been mended and I don't want to be a fool
I don't want to scare you away but there are so many things I need to say

I'm hoping you know how to treat my soul
cause if you don't I might walk away
I'm not looking for someone to raise
I'm not looking for someone to abuse me
I'm not as strong as I use to be, naive as I use to be
I'm blocking soul you see, not looking for anything to need

I don't need you, but I was thinking there's something about you, I d like to know
lets keep it good, lets keep it good

how could you be so lucky, ive never known someone as lovely
when I think of you I smile like an innocent child
the sun shines when your around, your like a beautiful view
I wanna be with you right now
I dream to see you right now, it helps me get thru
I wanna turn into us, forever want to own your touch
you're the meaning of truth, I know you trust me
I know your thinking of me
I know you mean it when you say I love you to me
I played it smart, followed my heart
I know its hard when we're apart

I don't need you, but I was thinking there's something about you, I d like to know
lets keep it good, lets keep it good

used up all my ___, and I'm not really interested
I'm on the piece to handle my biz, and I don't give a shit
I'm in, I'm out, I'm out of the streets and back to business quick
I'm trying to __, I got a love of my own
i've been down that road before and I Â‘d rather stay home
I'm cool with it, I'm cool
breathe easy, breathe easy
I'm not alone, when I'm alone
I'm not __, I'm on time
I'm always on when I'm off
they don't do daughters like sons
people try to take it from you, give it to you
back up off me
I'm not trying to pick your sin, but even if its what I want it

I don't need you, but I was thinking there's something about you, I d like to know
lets keep it good, lets keep it good</pre>
