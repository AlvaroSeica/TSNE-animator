I grabbed the mic and tried to say Yes y'all -----------&gt; Rakim
Somebody in the house say YEAH! ----------------------&gt; Chuck D
I grabbed the mic and tried to say Yes y'all -----------&gt; Rakim
They got me staring at the world through my rearview ---&gt; Tupac
Somebody in the house say YEAH!  ---------------------&gt; Chuck D

[Verse One: Tupac]
Nobody thought I'd make it, the world called me loser
Just a high school dropout, young drug abuser
Mama told me there'd be days like this, I never listened
Spent my childhood years; in my neighborhood prison
The world don't give a fuck about the kids
I can see from the poverty and the evil shit they did
To my young nation
Participation more hesitation can turn lethal
When ain't no love for a young nigga he turned evil
And burn people with no hope, there's no peace
To all my niggaz start regulating on your streets
Busting the neighborhood scatters, anther drug war
There ain't no use in negotiating with drug lords
Tried conversating but he won't listen
He said the world is a living hell for God's children
Picture him still in a pen, doing life plus two
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview

I grabbed the mic and tried to say Yes y'all -----------&gt; Rakim
They got me staring at the world through my rearview ---&gt; Tupac
To the tick tock you don't stop ----&gt; MC Ricky D AKA Slick Rick

[Verse Two: Tupac]
It's clearer now, cause I'm a newer individual
Plus I'm a Don, not just a small time criminal
Time has changed, homies died, only lives remain
Massive amounts of narcotics help me hide the pain
Wishing on Benz, came up on a Jag
They got a yacht for the quiet times, reflect on the past
All my homeboys that didn't make it, for you I'll do it
Remember back in the days as young truants
HUH! telling me to beware 
Because you cared and helped me to be prepared
Cemetery full of homies no longer here
But what about the babies, lost in watching burglars
Too dumb to be a dealer, too young to be a murderer
I'm begging you God, don't make their lives too hard
They're already scarred, too doped up to see the stars
We're living to die, everybody is high, plus I'm high too
Staring at the world through my rearview HUH!

I grabbed the mic and tried to say Yes y'all -----------&gt; Rakim

[Verse Three: Tupac]
Pictures are plenty, handle the semi, sipping Henni'
I hustle for pennies, know my own feared by many
I watched and took notes as a child I strategized
Witnessing crack dealings and drug killings have scattered lives
Niggaz don't know me but they think
That we could be closer than homies
Nigga you're phony so quit buying drinks
Mind on my money, you're funny about my currency
Niggas don't wanna see me
Shooting but they worry me, living to tell
Prison is hell for a nigga, they're using my bail
Built bigger jails for a nigga
Father I'm feeling tired, forgive me, cause I'm a sinner
Living life as a thug, while ducking cops and the criminals
Homies is dead and buried, past time has gone
Don't ask why trick nigga cause my mind is gone
And if I die, then let me watch what we've been through
Staring at the world through my rearview HUH!

Somebody in the house say YEAH! ----------------------&gt; Chuck D
Staring at the world through my rearview ---------------&gt; Tupac
I grabbed the mic and tried to say Yes y'all -----------&gt; Rakim
They caught me staring at the world through my rearview -&gt; Tupac
I grabbed the mic and tried to say Yes y'all -----------&gt; Rakim

[Tupac]
Staring at the world through my motherfucking rearview
Peep what a nigga trying to say; recognize that a nigga done did it all 
And seen it all and got shit to say to the motherfuckers 
that ain't seen shit and did shit yet
Peep game, look you little young motherfuckers
Stop running your heads up against brick walls
These old niggaz got something for you nigga better listen
Gotta get your over the dump
You know, you got to get over the humps ha ha
Staring at the world through my motherfucking rearview
That's right baby, Thug life, West Side
Death Row, outlawz, you what time it is
Staring at the world through my rearview HUH!
They got me staring at the world through my rearview
Alright
