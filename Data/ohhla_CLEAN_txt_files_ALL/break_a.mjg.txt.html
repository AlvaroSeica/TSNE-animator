        Good morning, class
        This is your teacher, MJG
        Look at me as I write my name on the board
        Class, do you see my name?
        Do you understand my name?

        Well, listen
        Okay
        Class, today at Break-A-Bitch University
        We will teach young bustas, playa-hatas
        And all of these weak, narrow-minded young sissies
        How to break a bitch
        Now 
        Really, it's so easy

        Mister G, I have a question
        Yes?
        Pimpology today is different than it was in the 70s
        Aha
        I wanna know how can anybody stroll today 
        And if so, what proceeds do we have to go through?

        Well, check it out 
        First here's what you have to do

{MJG:}
It's time to let the p-i-m-p in the fuckin front do'
One mo' nigga cuttin paper on the down low
It's so twisted in this white man's society
Why it be hard for a nigga when he try to be
Independent, on his own with a plan
You hate it cause you can't understand how I can
Rearrange and change how your daughter was raised
And teach her how to constantly get paid when she's laid
Ain't no use in bein the freak of the city, you still ain't got no ducats
You want a rolex or ride buckets?
Bitch, listen cause you gots plenty of competition from these other hoes 
Who think that you supposed 
To fall dead, short, lame to the game
Don't worry, put them bitches in your pistol range
MJ fuckin G settin your mind free with the type of knowledge
Class has started, day number one in Break-A-Bitch College

        And today, class
        We have a guest speaker, Mister Fat Mac
        Please introduce yourself...

        Good evening, players, good evening
        Eightball the Fat Mac here
        I'm here to let you know
        That these bitches, mean these bustas no good
        You see what I'm sayin?
        Now first of all, class
        Are there any questions?

        Ah yes, Mister Eightball
        You bein a Professor of Pimpology
        Tell me how these niggas let these hoes
        Get em caught up in that fuck shit

        Alright buddy, check this out...

{Eightball:}
Once again here I come pushin that funk into your ear
Do you recall Eightball, the player of the year
Calm cause I'm cool, and I'm cool cause I'm calm
Leavin hoes shell-shocked like they fall in Vietnam
Mayn, some have game, but most of them can't handle this
Those that I think are stars, end up bein scandalous
Welfare recipients, crib full of rugrats
Boost a couple of shirts, and now the bitch think she all that
Freakazoids have a nigga noid steppin up to me
Hoes that'll fuck you fast might be packin H.I.V.
Me, I'm packin jimmy hats 
So a hoe won't give me that
Shit about she on the pill 
Knowin that her pussy kill
See, through my education illustrations were the key
See, where I'm from only bustas have to pay a fee
Now you might ask what can a nigga do to get started
Pull a hoe and go enroll in Break-A-Bitch College

        Ah yeah 
        Now that was a very nice lecture
        And as I walk back over to the middle of the bulletin board
        I - I kinda figured, I wondered to myself
        And I looked at my class, and I
        It seems that you have more questions
        Is there any more questions?

        Yes
        Yes, Mister MJG
        I have a question
        Yes?
        Ah - in 94
        Do you think - ah
        Any bitches are gonna come up?
        Can - can any bitches be pimps?

        Look here, look here
        Let me tell you...

{MJG:}
Now these bitches got a lotta game for a nigga, so
That made me try to see how to break a hoe
What exactly would it take for me to make the bitch click
How damn quick could I make the bitch break a trick 
How fuckin long will it take to make my profit
And what kinda justice can this hoe do for my pocket
Talkin space-age pimpin, similar to the oldies
In ways like keepin our business tight, not by tryina be Goldie
These niggas gettin they game picked down to the bone
If you listen on what these hoes have to say, your money's gone
Nigga, focus on your own rhyme, make em follow your own rules
Don't be a fool, nigga, bring that bitch on by to school
I got a class for that ass, and it stars at seven
'I was a pimp' at ten o'clock, break till eleven
Future looks good for the smartest
Niggas in the school of Sir Break-A-Bitch College

        Okay class, okay class
        Everybody just needs to settle down
        Everybody just settle down
        We're gonna break in about 15 minutes
        But we have one more lecture, one more lecture
        Now ehm, eh 
        Calm down, calm down
        I'm gonna take one more question
        I'm gonna take -
        Are there any more questions?

        Ah yeah - ah
        I wanna know 
        How can a ordinary busta like me 
        You know, you know
        ...get in Break-A-Bitch College?

{Eightball:}
Not long ago I grew up as a youngster in this shit
When all I wanted to do is stick my dick up in a bitch
That dope made my ends, and my ends bought me weed
And all I wanted to see was them young bitches on they knees
Uncle Sam, damn, can I get a job, see
I don't wanna sell this dope, and nope, I don't wanna get out and rob
Today I was coolin like I usually do
I met this hoe after a show that wanted to chew me and screw
Now some busta-ass nigga woulda fucked the bitch
But at Break-A-Bitch College that's called trickin off your dick
On the corner ain't no pimps, real players are low-key
I'm on the verge of a splurge, settin up shop in Tennessee
Ain't no future for the lame, ain't no love in this game
Do you fuck them hoes and trust them hoes and love em with no shame?
9 times out of 10, trick nigga, if you do
Break-A-Bitch College got a scholarship just for you

        Ah yes
        Damn good class, damn good class
        Wonderful graduates
        I love em all, I love em all

        Now class
        Can you all join in with me
        For our school alma mater
        And let's sing it
        I'm proud to be an alumni
        From Break-A-College
        I'm proud to be...</pre>
