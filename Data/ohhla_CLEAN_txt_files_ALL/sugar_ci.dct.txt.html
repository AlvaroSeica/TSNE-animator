Movin' at the speed of sound
There has never been a lull in the motion
Conversations swirl around
Strangers questioning their devotion
Welcome to the world of talk shows
Where everybody seems to know

People talk and never listen
Come to their conclusions
So we'll feed 'em with the spoon
That makes the medicine go down

Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Maybe you thought that we sugar coat it
Aint gonna hide it
Gotta expose it
Yeah, we're gonna let our light shine

Standing on the stage of life
We are waiting for the final curtain
You can take a seat and watch tonight
But you're gonna get more than you came for

Bam
And welcome to our jam
Where folks are getting down
The Jesus freaks from every part of this here town
You can try and ask us why
We came to this solution
Though words may fly
You can't deny
It's in the air tonight

Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Maybe you thought that we sugar coat it
Aint gonna hide it
Gotta expose it
Yeah, we're gonna let our light shine

Boom
They thought we'd change our tune
They thought that we'd go bust
They thought we'd crumble like my grandma's flaky crust
Kapow
up in the here and now
The truth is screaming BIG
A light so bright
Whether day or night
It can't be hid

Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Aint gonna hide it
Yeah, we're gonna let our love light shine

Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Maybe you thought that we sugar coat it
Aint gonna hide it
Gotta expose it
Yeah, we're gonna let our light shine

Let your love shine
Let your love shine
Let your love shine
Let your love light shine
Your love light shine
Let your love shine
Let your love shine
Let your love shine
Let your love light shine

Sugar coat it</pre>
