Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You could-could get it those of the street shit, damn
You could come and copy a chick brick
I got a spot, you can pick it up my act, damn
But I got number trap
I got plug prices, I got plug prices
I got plug prices, I got plug prices
I got, I got I got plug prices, damn
I got plug prices, I got plug prices

I got plug prices, I'm talking load numbers
So much down work, feel a tam hummers
Standing in the kitchen call me baby... hummer
In my number trap, all we do is wrote two numbers
Like a calculator, all we do is have to comers
I got plug prices, tear the plug to keep on cunnin
Hundred thousand building gas, end it for the homie
To match your tones of fish get... like the money
Get it to the crash and we gonna serve every jonkey
When you in this street for real, everybody love you
Keep your eyes on the hoe nigga and the money
Keep your eyes on the hoes, niggas and the money

[Chorus]

I got plug lices
I drop my own pack, I can't tell all myself
So tool say hundred palmed ain't need nobody here
I got poor relations, plug do with hazin'
Plug... Jamaicans, I may be plazed, come get a dough sew it
I can serve you different waste
The rest of P to make a brick, I got six waste
Six hundred hours that 600, 000
I'm real boss, I get it off
Aren't you got lost, pass three a cost
Free band boss, I plug talk
If I ever take a loss nigga, I'll take you off

[Chorus]

You can get a chick brick of the remix
A lany ocean way, get sea-sea
In a Ferrari seeking yalling like a speech..
All about my brand, Maserati G stick
You can get a doughs, hundred real street shit
Pay a finer feet, since I gotta teach this
Pounds of gag going for the 36
Want a 36, then I charge it 36
Well damn!
Well damn!

[Chorus]</pre>
