Verse 1
[Debonaire] Check it out, it's the Poison Clan
            Debonaire, Drugz, and the Money-Man
            Low-life niggas, you see the Clan
            And say that it figures
            You can pull my file and see I 
            Talk about hoes and shit that's wild
            'Cause I don't give a god-damn
            Bein' that ghetto hood that I am
            Gamblin' for bread; my Smif-n-Wessun
            Beats any spread
            You can't play me like Atari
            Motherfuckers tryin' to will be sorry
            'Cause Debonaire's far from a sucker
            Another low-life motherfucker
[JT Money]  Mack-Daddy, another name for pimp
            Worried 'bout nothin', just struttin' with a gangsta limp
            Since the youth, had dreams of riches
            Makin' money by pimpin' bitches
            Parents hate me around their daughters
            Knowin' their kids sell for quarters
            And I don't pay any more
            'Cause that's all she's worth to me, the low-life whore
            I mean, she's makin' me rich
            And only God knows I love a bitch
            Who keeps me strong in the game
            Pimp your little sister, won't feel shame
            I go bitch-berserk, 'cause if your mother's 
            On my dick, I'll put the bitch to work

Verse 2
[Debonaire] It's a jack, so get against the wall
            And stop lookin' for a cop to call
            'Cause if you do so much as twitch
            You'll end up somewhere in a ditch
            'Cause I'm like that; you ain't heard?
            Motherfuckers had to spread the word
            This kid, I once shot him
            'Cause his Cadillac had too much bottom
            That's a good enough reason
            To me, any season is shootin' season
            For a wild motherfucker
            Debonaire's never gettin' played like a sucker
            Niggas know that I go get thugs,
            And come back shootin' buck-shots and slugs
[JT Money]  Yeah, motherfuckers fear me
            But most be even scared to come near me
            They know I'm stampedin', leavin'
            a bitch unconscious and bleedin'
            Puttin' bitches on the 'ave
            And when a nigga see a bitch, you say he gotta have
            But he will pay to fuck MY bitch
            That's when I get my percentage, which
            Keeps a nigga like me eatin' shrimp
            And makin' JT a motherfuckin' pimp!

Verse 3
[Debonaire] Debonaire's bad; the Devil's Dad
            Goin' on like I'm mentally mad
            See, I'm livin' like a villan
            You can look at me and see I'm top billin'
            I'm a goddamn player
            A bitch ain't shit to me once I slay 'er
            Once I get that ass,
            Best believe that bitch is gettin' left in the low class
            I know how to act
            The bitch won't ever talk to me behind my back
            'Cause if so, she'll end up wit'
            Pictures on the milk-box for talkin' shit!
[JT Money]  A low life nigga
            After I fuck a bitch, I egg her
            But then a brother gets mad
            But then I leave it up to the Devil's Dad
            'Cause when niggas start to roll
            Money gots to chill 'cause I'm on parole
            Professional hit-man
            Throwin' a blow no nigga can withstand
            It gots me bent
            Owin' me and not payin' every cent?
            JT Money's something far from a sucker
            Another low-life motherfucker</pre>
