[Intro]
{"StreetRunner"}
Dope - yeah!
Break it down slow - yeah!
Take it down, ohh!

[Chorus]
Said I'm a hus-t-la by any means, boy I don't play
If they don't give me what I wants I goes the other way (yeah)
I'm ridin dirty, dirty I'm ridin, swore to God I'ma ball each day
So come prepared, I ain't never scared, they gon' let my fo'-fifth bang
Ay~!

[Twista]
I got whatever you want, I got whatever you need
I'm a hustler from the Chi, I can flip that (ohh)
Billion dollar niggaz with the billion dollar looks 
when them niggaz got kush in the Midwest (ohh)
Used to be able to come up off it 
but then online it's hard if that ain't on weight (on the real)
Used to be able to get the elbow for the six (yup)
Now motherfuckers want eight (shit)
I'm supposed to honor the number but I know a nigga who would kill 
or who don't give a damn might just
come at you for the connect or I'ma have to do you in 
cause you chargin me middleman prices
I remember we used to break a bitch
Now it's a recession we gotta wait for the lick (for the lick)
For the kush they want six for the ounce (what?)
And they want 28 for the brick (what?)
Now how the fuck am I gon' get rid if these? (Rid of these)
Them too, I'm hopin them go soon (go soon)
Dude said he can't cop 'em, I want too much 
and I ain't leavin him no room (no room)
I gotta get it how I gotta get it 
Even if I break it down - dope (yeah!)
Break it down - slow (yeah!)
Take it down, ohh!

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Rollin with a pistol and the dope in aluminum
Room in the Ramada gettin down in the streets
Hustlin hard, takin what you can get 
but you steady reminiscin on 50,000 a week
A playa mode is about how to look good 
and different methods on how to cut that hoe (that hoe)
Hustle mode is if the cocaine cook good 
and different methods on how to cut that dough (woo~!)
Had to pop at a nigga that used to be cool 
because you trusted him and now you gotta go to court (go to court)
Cause he gave you the money and when he drove off 
he called you and told you he was short (he was short)
That's some shit that coulda got dude killed (yup)
Listen to it when the rap tune's real (yup)
Put the bitch on the plane with a couple of pounds 
that you can't smell cause it's vacuum sealed
Take off a quarter to smoke in order to choke
I cut it open then collapse from the scent (woo~!)
Pop it all off, for 600 an ounce 
I'ma get to smoke for free and get back what I spent
I gotta get it how I gotta get it 
Even if I break it down - dope (yeah!)
Break it down - slow (yeah!)
Take it down, ohh!
