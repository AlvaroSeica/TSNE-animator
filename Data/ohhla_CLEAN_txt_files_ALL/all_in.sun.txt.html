Yeah yeah I know
You waited too long because somethin went wrong
But now I'm back on wax and your problems are gone
Thought I'd make one record and then just fall?
Not at all, I'm still ballin in progress, y'all

Put it in gear, the King is here
Well it's about time, it took me a year
Certain party peoples put a hold on sound
And everybody has tried to keep a good man down
But I'm on stage, don't worry, I'm okay
Go tell your DJ here's the record to play
King Sun/D-MoÃ«t separated and yet
You bet money against me and you lost a bet

(Hey yo, you're all in
You're all in)

The power of the mind designed to incline
Shinin to refine uncivilized swine
Greed it and eat it, swearin you need it
Think nobody knows? But yo, I know you cheated
False advocated, denyin that you ate it
( ? ) on the righteous, claimin that you hate it
Poison intested animal infested
How could you request it? You? I never guessed it
One track thought out there to be caught
My insight was right, so it's time I taught
The student the lesson ( ? ) the guessin
Of all yes-y'allin and y'all yes-yessin
Get own checks, selected by executives
Thought I wouldn't make another record? I bet you did
Nevertheless I return in the flesh
Fat, funky, dope and the rest is (fresh)

Right out the pack, straight off the rack
Complete with a receipt for when I do my attacks
Paid in advance, sworn to make you dance
The way I instruct and conduct will enhance
The power on the floor, so give me some more
Take it from a connoisseur and then yell (Encore!)
I love it when I hear a big audience cheer
The words are clear and there's not a ( ? )
Straight up, wait up, the bet is not made up
Keep buyin records so the King will be paid up
Lending, spending, financially depending
Radio waves transmitting and sending
This is at the cost to employ from the boss
( ? ) loss
Which is how I beat you, defeat you and teach you
Don't ever bite the hand that feeds you

See I'm smokin like a Indian or should I say a chimney
Peace pipe sensi and a beat ( ? )
Settin in the mood to groove - but wait a minute
Heard about a contest, wondered who was in it
Could be an MC tryina be b-e-s-t
Let's see - who am I? (Who is he?)
Modern day warrior, never heard a story of
A rapper who could do it before, never before
See a whole lotta talk has been goin around
And if you ain't a snake then you ain't down
Well see I'm not down, I'm always too high
No I'm not addicted and I don't tell lies
Steady human being, buildin, emceein
You have somethin against me, you keep disagreein
Get off my back cause you can get a smack
You think that I'm a new jack? 
Now you don't wanna do that
Respect is mandatory and due to every king
Jealousy's the rebel of a positive thing
Rebel from the light, you be in the dark
I'm like a man with the bullhorn ( ? )
With the duty to change your ways and actions
You added up to nothin, so you're a subtraction
All on my tip, tryina get a grip
But too many field trips, now you done get skipped
Left back cause you failed the course
Not enough credits for hangin outdoors
Shoulda learned a lesson, got in a profession
20 years old, still nothin but a freshman

Hard is what you wanted, and that is what you get
The biggest, the boldest yet you never met
Or more to the point, blunt, I'll never front
A man of substance, what every woman wants
To show off I go off on immature ladies
You're not a human being but a part of a Mercedes
You come with the car, when it's gone so are you
But I don't need a Benz or a BMW
Jeep is for creepin afterhours, my powers
Strictly with the mental composition I devour
Females beware, see me and stare
But I beg your pardon, my girl is over there
So don't even try it, so good you can't deny it
You oughta be quiet before there is a riot
Led by the hand of the strong full-bred
From beginning to end my competition is dead
Fighting, writing, reciting to survive
A breath of fresh air will make a dead rhyme live
The rhyme has character, should be a ninja
Deadly style and very fatal when I injure

My mission's a death wish, I need someobdy to diss
Who souped you up to battle me? Oh, your psychiatrist?
Modern hypnotics for crazy psychotics
Lay off the Thorazine and antibiotics
Bad for your health and I go for self
I'm the hunter of the fronter with your head on shelf
Is there to remind me you snuck up behind me
The penatly was death, they couldn't find me
In a court of law, run to the judge for a summons
Mention my name and who's comin
(Here comes the judge, here comes the judge)
I'm loungin in a chamber sippin champagne suds
Livin it up, homeboy, don't interrupt
Just keep sippin brew from a plastic cup
I got too much to do on the avenue
So I write my girl a rhyme and let her battle you

And that goes to show and prove that you can't keep a good man down
So in other words what I'm sayin to all of y'all
I'll never be all in</pre>
