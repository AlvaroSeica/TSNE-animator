[Intro - Matthew Santos] - 3X
Look up in the sky

[Chorus - Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
Thought I left you alone
But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
Well, well, is that our little author?
Comin back, hummin his hymns, a little altered
Your attention put back on the flow like the department of water
Takin off of the dough, like Little Walter
Chess? Yes, baby I'm Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with a lawyer
Judge, jury like a loo, rap name Lupe but my daddy named me "Warrior"
This is his memorial

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
No, I ain't that nigga tryin to get a liquor line
When I be scriptin lines, want this petition sign
It says I'm sick of dyin, sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I'm sick of pimpin mine
Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed, fat bitch
Tellin us not to pursue it, just to shoo/shoe it like a blacksmith
We're trapped, and movin 'round in circles like it's chapstick
And that's the same encircled way of thinkin that we chat with
Well wrap this
Around ya head, like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in F.E.D.S., instead of National Geographic's
Well I'm not havin it, nah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain't never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain't never heard lyin
Lu' don't moo/move no cow herds/cowards, you only heard lions/lines
Not a facade cherisher, I'd rather have the scars
I don't "Idolize America", I'm "Dancing with the Stars"
Uh huh, all of them? Yeah, they are too
You look up and you see us shining down on you

[Chorus]

[Outro - Matthew Santos] - 3X
Shining down on you</pre>
