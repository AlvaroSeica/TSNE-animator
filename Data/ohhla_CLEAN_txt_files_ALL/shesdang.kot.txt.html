Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now a wise man once said
Don't fall in love in love with a pretty girl
Cause the pretty girls are the ones that can be so dangerous

Yeah she's dangerous
Lethal weapon, serious
Sex pistol, wind of her hips
She's dangerous, so dangerous
Rock steady as she goes
Love me down from my head to my toes
Yeah that smile that she wrote
She's dangerous, so dangerous

I love you love double up on the weekend
I'm like a sex torpedo heat seeking
And in any other case a cherry on top
But this night well the cherry gon pop yeah
You be the hottest little bunny in my life now
Sex so good, think I wanna fuck your lights out
And d for sheezy, I'm taking the bait, yeah
So beautiful, breezy and not a mistake

Tell me how you want it daddy give it to you right
Lay you on the bed body looking really tight
Get up on the stick and you can ride this bike
You all up on the pipe cause I know what you like
They shaved so nice titties bounce in my face
Get up on top and let me get a taste
Sexy babe from the sex you play
I really wanna make her mine
Make a fine girl say

Do you love me love me
Show me your body, body
Girl you make me wanna be naughty, naughty
Licky boom, boom, boom
You naughty little girl, boom, boom, boom
She's Dangerous

Yeah she's dangerous
Lethal weapon, serious
Sex pistol, wind of her hips
She's dangerous, so dangerous
Rock steady as she goes
Love me down from my head to my toes
Yeah that smile that she wrote
She's dangerous, so dangerous

It won't be long, another man is dying
But it wasn't like I wasn't trying
She's so fucking fine
I was beasting like a lion
But she was eating like its feeding time
And then she blew my mind, my mind
I'm talking next level black widow, praying mantise
The type that moves her lips like she dreams of belly dancers
And so fresh when she wakes up in the morning
Dude yes I'm having sex and success just for breakfast

Wait imma eat you down then take you out
Show you off around town lick your pounai
The way that you working you're turning me on
Yeah, your titties are forcing my fingers apart
And making me straight crazy, needing a spawn
Making love all night till the break of the dawn
You're dangerous, everybody knows you're the bomb
I wanna push you long time sex relations

Hey sexy thang with those short shorts on
And the rose you got tattooed right above your thong
When you shake to the song, jirate to the beat
You make superman so weak at the knees
You're a murderer, stone cold killa
Heart breaker and a body rilla
Dangerous when you do it like that
Licky boom clap, clap boom clap

Do you love me love me
Show me your body, body
Girl you make me wanna be naughty, naughty
Licky boom, boom, boom
You naughty little girl, boom, boom, boom
She's Dangerous

Yeah she's dangerous
Lethal weapon, serious
Sex pistol, wind of her hips
She's dangerous, so dangerous
Rock steady as she goes
Love me down from my head to my toes
Yeah that smile that she wrote
She's dangerous, so dangerous

Looking like a sexy lady, oh how you blow my mind
Nothing like a sexy lady, Make me wanna ha all the time
Call it out

Brown hair, brown eyes
I met this sweet sexy thang
She was blowing my mind
And she was one of a kind
And every time she come around
I was looking at the behind
Sunny like a beehive
Now she got me buzzin like, Bzzz
Just like the bees fly
Little mami got me so high
High that I hit it kush
Then a high rise
Talk about a good ride
All I want to do is make her mine
She's a good vibe

Ain't nobody ever met a woman like you
Ain't no one I know, wouldn't want to get a view
Take it from a playa that's seen quite a few
Bitches in my life time, a lot of taboo
Turning all the heads in a room guess who
That's you, my dirty little vixen
And later on I'm really gonna be fixen
To wreck that ass into submission

Do you love me love me
Show me your body, body
Girl you make me wanna be naughty, naughty
Licky boom, boom, boom
You naughty little girl, boom, boom, boom
She's Dangerous

Yeah she's dangerous
Lethal weapon, serious
Sex pistol, wind of her hips
She's dangerous, so dangerous
Rock steady as she goes
Love me down from my head to my toes
Yeah that smile that she wrote
She's dangerous, so dangerous

Looking like a sexy lady, oh how you blow my mind
Nothing like a sexy lady, make me wanna ha all the time
Call it out</pre>
