What's up? What's up? What's up?

[Intro - Chamillionaire]
They only love ya when ya on
They only love ya when ya on, the only other time is when youre gone
They only love ya when ya on
What goes up come do-own

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, welcome to true thousand eleven, where everybodys the realest
Everyone who a midget, say they do it the biggest (yeah)
Every part of ya business is everybody business
Got my name all in they mouth, I should've been a dentist (yeah)
Everybody done did it, everybodys a critic
Im like what you talkin 'bout like everybodys a Willis
Man, they say they love you when the block on smash
Since they so in love, tell em they can kiss my cash
Wait a minute, you dont like me? (me), well I dont like you (you)
These fakers sayin that they real but I see right through
The old me, that was the realest person I knew
The new me, probably the realest person times two (uh)

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
So when you feel like its everybody for themselves
And the place where ya livin isn't far from Hell
And they keep tellin you that you were born to fail
And everybody say they real but its too hard to tell
Say until I die, Im a always grind
Im a be okay, Im a be alright
If they say I'll fail, that'll be a lie
But it ain't no such thing as a tie
They only love ya when ya on

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Hold up, you got to be out ya conscience
They ain't got no sense and thats why we call it nonsense
How they gon' talk about what you never accomplish?
Like they done done something that's worthy of my responses (hold up)
Look at the tags, Im showin em how to stunt G
Candy and papers plates, it looks like I got the munchies (woo!)
Its so ironic they couch got money in it
But yall always on the couch and never get any money
Wheres Cupid? They only love ya 'til ya next hook
But I dont check the gossip blogs, I check check books
Ask LeBron, he'll say winnin is the best look
Every move I make is right like I ain't got a left foot
To keep it real, a record deal couldnt stop me
Im bootleggin bullets, you can still get a copy (woo!)
Lucifer is in a pair of heels in the lobby
I dont dance with the Devil, call it Trilluminati (uh)

[Chorus]

[Break - Chamillionaire] - w/ Nipsey Hussle ad libs
Northside, where ya at? Northside let me know ya got my back
They only love ya when ya on
Southside, where ya at? Southside, let me know ya got my back
Yeah
Eastside, where ya at? Eastside let me know ya got my back
They only love ya when ya on
Westside, where ya at? Westside let me know ya got my back

[Verse 3 - Nipsey Hussle]
Yo, look, Im a get money nigga, on a daily, basis
Road to the riches, potholes in the pavements
That's why I follow every rule and regulation
Makin rap money off this game Ive been laced with
Uh, and you can blame it on black Sam
Blame it on Crenshaw and Slauson Ave.
Fly with bad bitch with a fat ass
Bail money, big pistol and a black Mag
Thats how we play it, we livin for the fast cash
To all my haters, consider this the last laugh
Ive been the greatest in my city, now Im past that
Its all money ASCAP, broke bitches, bad back
Please, Louis locs, Louis backpacks
First class seats like a pillow top mattress
Uh, we cant take it to the casket
So Im a spend these racks, just to laugh at your reaction

[Chorus] - w/ Nipsey Hussle ad libs

[Outro - Chamillionaire]
I know (I know), I kno-ooow
They only love ya when ya one
I know (I know), I kno-ooow
They only love ya when ya one
What goes up, must come down
What goes up, comes down
They only love ya when ya on
What goes up, must come down
What goes up, comes do-own</pre>
