(Intro, Master P)
We in the club, poppin bottles after bottles
Makin Champagne rain, fuckin models after models
Bitch niggas see us, and they don't even holla
Bout to press a button, leave you haters in the flowers

(Verse 1, Master P)
Nigga got me for a brick
Gave him twenty-eight, nigga gave me bullshit!
What you think I'ma do when I see him!?
Fuck you and his crew if I see 'em!
Real niggas, G-code
I'm all up in that, D-Bo
Never miss a shot, Derek Rhoades at the freethrow
Catch him and I'm gone
Two bottles of that 'trone
Fuck these niggas hatin on me because my money long
I see pussy in his eyes, I know these niggas scared
Yeah I fucked his bitch, and that was the best I ever had
You toilet tissue niggas, I'm bout to wipe my ass
Keep my name out ya mouth before you end up in a bag

(Hook, Crazy)
I be! I die!
The Kush! I'm high!
The streets! The Pain!
The money! The fame!
These niggas hatin on me
Thinkin they ahead of me
(Master P)
Pussy nigga scared of me, actin like a nun
I was by myself, I didn't even have my gun
Talkin that bullshit, bout you put in work
Check a nigga resume, ain't never did no dirt
He scared

(Verse 2, Crazy)
Purple and gold Charger
Call it James Worthy
Shorty take it to the head while I'm at the derby
No fear, I live on the edge of life!
No Illuminati dawg, cause I love Christ!
My price, twenty-six a fuckin' brick
Your baby mama mad, cause a nigga came quick
Fuck the rats, everybody fuckin' tellin'
I keep a chopper, a firearm with a felon
I'd rather die bustin then to go without it!
Run up on me dawg, I'll show ya that we bout it, bout it!
Al Capone pushin work through the whole city
Come short nigga, you can meet Frank Nitty

(Hook, Crazy)
I be! I die!
The Kush! I'm high!
The streets! The Pain!
The money! The fame!
These niggas hatin on me
Thinkin they ahead of me
(Master P)
Pussy nigga scared of me, actin like a nun
I was by myself, I didn't even have my gun
Talkin that bullshit, bout you put in work
Check a nigga resume, ain't never did no dirt

(Verse 3, Tori)
When Tori enter the room, they holla hoo-ray
I spit more fire than two K's for two days
These rap niggas scared to meet sweet boo-tays
I'm on my Chi Town shit, nigga Lupe
In the hood, gettin dollas
In the club, poppin bottles
If she bad, I'ma holla
If she not, don't even bother
Lambo doors with the invisible roof
You can call that bitch rabbit, cause it's missin a tooth
Niggas scared, drug dealin niggas run with my clique
And my swagger so New York, I should run with the Knicks
Man, my attitude so shitty, niggas wish I would quit
Man, my dawgs ball hard til' I tell 'em to quit

(Hook, Crazy)
I be! I die!
The Kush! I'm high!
The streets! The Pain!
The money! The fame!
These niggas hatin on me
Thinkin they ahead of me
(Master P)
Pussy nigga scared of me, actin like a nun
I was by myself, I didn't even have my gun
Talkin that bullshit, bout you put in work
Check a nigga resume, ain't never did no dirt
He scared</pre>
