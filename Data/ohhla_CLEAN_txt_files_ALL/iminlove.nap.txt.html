Artist: Napoleon XIV 
Album:  They're Coming To Take Me Away Ha-Haaa!
Song:   I'm In Love With My Little Red Tricycle
Typed by: Brian Rancourt

[Child's music box plays throughout]
[Tricycle bell rings a few times]

(In a child like voice)
Thirty days have Septober
April, June, and no wonder
All the rest have peanut butter
All except my dear grandmother
She had a little red tricycle
I stole it, ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Tricycle bell rings a few times]

I am in love with my little red tricycle
It has pedals, and a seat that has springs
And wheels that have spokes
That don´t speak 'til they´re spoken to
And a little bell that I can ring [Tricycle bell rings a few times]
See? [Tricycle bell rings a few times] 
See? [Tricycle bell rings a few times]

Thirty days have Septober
April, June, and no wonder
All the rest have peanut butter
All except my dear grandmother
She had a little red tricycle
It´s mine now! [Quickly] Ha ha ha ha ha ha
[Tricycle bell rings rapidly a few times, then slows down to normal]

When I'm riding my little red tricycle
Why do people always stop and ask me

(In a stern adult voice)
"Why must you ride on that little red tricycle?
Act your age, you know you´re forty-three."

[Total silence]

(In a child like voice)
I didn´t really steal the tricycle from my grandmother
It followed me home 
[slower and sadder] Ha ha ha ha

[Music box and tricycle bell ringing resume, then fade]</pre>
