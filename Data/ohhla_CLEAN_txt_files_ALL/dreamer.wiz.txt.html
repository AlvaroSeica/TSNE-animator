Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yup... it's all raw
Motion right here no paper no none of that

I must be dreaming
yea I must be dreaming
Yea cus
I got the cars got the clothes got the money and the hoes
and the way I see that ain't gon change
I must be dreaming
yea I must be dreaming,
Yea cus
I got the cars got the clothes got the money and the hoes
and the way I see that ain't gon change
I must be

I wake up early in the morning to a fat blunt
a phone full of miss calls my shit back'd up
A flight to catch my shit pack'd up
them superstars you hear about that's us
The 12s and the trunk hit like a mac truck
I see your bitch it's a wrap like a packd lunch
My diamonds shining
they motivating
I see you smiling
I know you hatin
I'm on the road like here there an everywhere
in hollywood eatin god smokin heavy there
Ain't comfortable unless I got alot of money near
I'm in exclusive shit you got alot of funny gear
Flat screen tv no glare in em
an all my rooms got king size beds and em
I'm not jus talkin
That's all it seem an
my lives a movie
I must be dreaming
yea I must be dreaming
Yea cus
I got the cars got the clothes got the money and the hoes
and the way I see that ain't gon change
I must be dreaming
yea I must be dreaming
Yea cus
I got the cars got the clothes got the money and the hoes
and the way I see that ain't gon change,
I must be

I go to sleep and a new city every night
an pray to god he lookin over me evry flight
a new time zone,
You hear me right
LA to MIA I be ther tonight
then I'm and daygo shopin for new shit
Eatin at roof chris right cross the cruise ships
hear niggas talkin bout it
I really do this
U could'ntwalk a mile and these niggas shoes here
car service when I land homie I'm the man
Don't live the life of a star it's hard to understand
everywhere I go they no my name
They see me smiling
they no my chain
plus they no I got flow like the sink brah
Diamond linked up
all my niggas inkd up
alot of starving
I'm out here eating
and making history

I must be dreaming
yea I must be dreaming
Yea cus
I got the cars got the clothes got the money and the hoes
and the way I see that ain't gon change
I must be dreaming
yea I must be dreaming
Yea cus
I got the cars got the clothes got the money and the hoes
and the way I see that ain't gon change
I must be</pre>
