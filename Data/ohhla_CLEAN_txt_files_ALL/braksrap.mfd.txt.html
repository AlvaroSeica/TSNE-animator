[Brak]
Check me out
My name is Brak and that's a fact
I got a mom and a dad and they are out back
We sit by the pool and we nibble on snacks
Then we eat a big lunch and we all take naps!
Why'd the beat stop?  Hey!
Heyyyyy... I got a mask too so gimme the mic!

[Zorak]
Cheh!  You're no Doom

[Brak]
C'mon Danger Mouse, gimme that beat!

[Brak - singing Vicki Sue Robinson]
Turn the beat around!  Love to hear per-cussion!

[Zorak]
You suck!

[Brak - still singing]
Turn it upside down!  Love to hear it...

[Zorak]
I know talent, and you ain't got it

[Brak - angry]
I WASN'T DONE!</pre>
