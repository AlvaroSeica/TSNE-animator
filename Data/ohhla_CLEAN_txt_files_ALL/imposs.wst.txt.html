[CHORUS: (Keyshia Cole and Kanye West)]
[Keyshia Cole]
I've been waiting my life; and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind; it's been way too much time
That's why...It's just impossible - It's im-poss-ible
And you know that..

[Kanye]
I don't wanna hear that bull sh..; I wanna hear that official sh..
Kanye and that Twista sh..; that's so impossible to get it (it's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Twista]
Ain't no way you could pull up to the party
in a Bentley blowing B in a club like this; (oh no)
Ain't no way you could cook up in the studio
with Kanye and get it jukking in the club like this (oh no)
Ain't no way that you could win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin on my Henn'
Holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollering at her friends, (its impossible)
For you to ever be the nicest
You ain't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't never stood on a tip like this
You ain't never stood for no sh.. like this, (Its just impossible)
For you to get it if you don't wanna win; so get up off ya ass
and go for yours, and never for mine
now you ain't from the ride that I'm in
Know what I'm sayin..

[CHORUS]

[Twista]
It's impossible for you to eva get wit me because of how I ride on the track;
Got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? When my celeb
used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac (it's just impossible)
niggaz always hatin
leaving me for wilin out for po kim
you be sittin back talking yo shit
I can't help but I see you tho, I don't get it (Its impossible)
Lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants; movin kinda wilder
turn a regular jeans in a low riders
tell me can I be your man (its just impossible)
For you to eva deny, that I'm about chi-town
represent the city with the deal for 12 years
and sell a couple a mil and still hold it down...THAT'S POSSIBLE

[CHORUS]

[Kanye]
Get it; bundled up and - lit it; smoke a lil blunt don't - admit it
do it like I did too late - I did it
The controversy can't worse me man; I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty what is you saying
I gotta a duel with a couple niggaz that's Thursday man
Why the hell is I'm worrying; hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
Man your life must be perfect man; look at how they came up with the perfect plan
Its impossible
got strip clubs playin gosspital
girl so sick in the hospital
you know I jumped out like 'Pac'll do
I only break it down I when I rock wit you
Since Michael Jackson made rock wit you
I done did shit on logical
maybe cause we did the impossible
maybe we done did the impossible

[CHORUS]

[Outro]
No matter what I do, see I been waitin all my, waitin all my life, yeah
And I know I stayed on my grind, I know I stayed on my grind
Its impossible for me to fail baby, I gotta keep on movin
Gotta keep on movin, its impossible

(Its just impossible) (its impossible)</pre>
