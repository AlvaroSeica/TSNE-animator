[Fes Taylor]
Staten Island, Shaolin, Fes Taylor, what up yo
Thursday 2 to 6, Sunday 4 to 9
I spit hot rhymes all of time
Megatron on your radio, Hot 97 pumping out the stereo
Blow o's like a Cheerio
Smoke that la-la, laught at you haters like ha-ha
I chase paper, you chasing na-na
Mega San Fran, Fes Taylor smoking his fans ran
Staten so happy they doing hand stands
Blazing like hip hop and R&amp;B
I split a dude like Moses parted the sea
Profes, I'm the hardest M.C., I harvest the beat
So all my people starving could eat
Yo, send me the sergeant of your fleet, guaranteed
Bullets I throw 'em like Steve, launching deep
Park Hill in the place if you real, then
Tell me how you feel to my face, I can't wait, yo
Hot 97, blazing hip hop and R&amp;B, plus co-starring me
Two 4 War Entertainment, we the greatest
Profes, hip hop in the heart of me
Fes Taylor your boy, Staten Island stand up
We back in the building...</pre>
