[Domo Genesis]
This life is a game if you wanna play, countin all your own mistakes
Livin it with no delay, so fast I'm gettin growin pains
Father didn't show me my instincts to take the open lane
I go insane, all these problems come with my growing age
Blowin haze; tryin to clear the doubt that's sittin on my brain
I don't complain, but the kid inside me feelin so restrained
Gotta stay golden let desire rekindle the flame
Searchin for the Fountain of Youth, when I'm free in my brain

[Chorus One: Tyler, the Creator]
(Bring in the horns) You hear that fuckin brass?
(Fucking brass, nigga) That's little boy nigger with the trumpets
Marching with the bandwagon looking for his heart, no sleeve
but his hand carry muskets
Lurking in the meadows, Oblivion
Motherfuck Giupetto he's a leader, not a puppet
Some Professors +Nuttier+ than Klump's dick
So think before you blink and "aye aye" make assumptions

[Chorus Two: repeat 2X]
Niggaz (Your left! Your left! Your left, right, left!)
Niggaz is comin! (Your left! Your left! Your left, right, left!)

[Tyler, The Creator]
They want a story, a story, I write the shit that I find very amusing
cause all of they fuckin stories are boring
It's really awkward to know that a bunch of kids do adore me
It's like I fathered these fuckers, so you won't find me on Maury
I'm still a kid in my heart, so I have a problem maturing
but it'll come from experiences and shit I see touring
I'm like a bird when I'm soaring, really high and I'm
really horny from watching this porn; nope but

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Interlude]
Five {*vocal scratch: "bring in the hook"*}
Four {*vocal scratch: "bring in the hook"*}
Three {*vocal scratch: "bring in the hook"*}
Two {*vocal scratch: "bring in the hook"*}
Now where's, Tyler?

[Tyler, the Creator]
Bottom of the countdown; shit ain't been the same
since I found out Hodgy Beats ghostwrote for Bow Wow
Now I'm the loud shot, body-style foulmouthed fucker
That your teenage kid likes to bow down
Riding around town in Seattle
with the same shotgun that Kurt used to CLICK CLAK BOOM POW
Still suicidal, but some assume that I'm cool now
cause I got a fucking award in my own room now
Nope~! But I can flip shit like a couch pillow
Annnd, have my death silent like a loose vow
The bandwagon turned into caboose, so
So, don't let that little nigger trumpet lose sound
Just let him play</pre>
