[Chorus: Robbie Nova] *Maino &amp; Robbie Nova on the chorus together
See we could do it big like Beyonce and Jay-Z

Girl you wanna do it? Baby just come with me
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us

[Verse One: Maino] (Robbie Nova)
(Maino talk to em right!) Drop dead gorgeous, diamonds on her necklace
She's serious Louboutin princess
Somebody's girl, she probably might be one
I know a real bad bitch when I see one
I'm like, if it was me I'd keep hun
Because she the kind of girl a nigga need son!
No games I'm serious I think I really like her
Oh lord she's it I'll wife her
Hopin I can get close enough to try her
Man I would lock her down, life her
'Cause she's the baddest bitch in the world
And all I think is how I'm supposed to make her my girl
Damn! I just want to get the chance to please her
Look at Jay-Z and B that could be us
You got what I need I knew it
Let's not wait time let's do it

[Chorus: Robbie Nova] *Maino &amp; Robbie Nova on the chorus together
See we could do it big like Beyonce and Jay-Z
Livin that life like Swizz and Alicia Keys
Barack and Michelle! We could start our first family
Girl you wanna do it? Baby just come with me
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us

[Verse Two: Maino]
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!
Presidential dine, presidential nights
You Michelle Obama, the president's wife
I done made my old girl jealous
On the red carpet now my new chick famous
My dog told me lately I ain't focused now
'Cause it's clear, shorty got me open now
She really got me spinnin like a ceilin fan
I ain't in and out the clubs I'm a different man
I used to play around with the groupies yep
Met her, then I gave the groupies
Long hair, green eyes
True Religions lookin tight around her mean thighs
I ain't trippin off of what my boys said, I'm juist tryin to be her boyfriend
And you ain't got to worry about them chicks
'Cause baby, you that bitch!

[Chorus: Robbie Nova] *Maino &amp; Robbie Nova on the chorus together
See we could do it big like Beyonce and Jay-Z
Livin that life like Swizz and Alicia Keys
Barack and Michelle! We could start our first family
Girl you wanna do it? Baby just come with me
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us

[Verse Three: Maino] (Robbie Nova)
(Maino! Talk to 'em) You my Gabrielle (Yeah) My Halle Berry (My!)

Nose turnt up walk like you that bitch

The new Louis bag, before it's even out
Yeah! Baby I know how to treat ya
Handcuffs you a keeper

[Chorus: Robbie Nova] *Maino &amp; Robbie Nova on the chorus together
