DECA:
(If you want to take it personal you can take it personal
do how you feel, but I'm in the zone, and I'm all alone
and I'm just getting grown, thinking really what's wrong)

Like how my folks tried to hide it from me but they was splitting
beside that, all alone is how I was gonna be livin
gotta be quick to grow, so I'm grinding, on a mission
and family don't want to help, but they all in my business
and real homies will be that, and fake ones will be BITCHES
they talk behind my back and in my face they blow me kisses
I got alot of shit to say, but they just don't be listening
why you don't come around me when my diamonds don't be glissesing? but FUCK EM
and I can't be getting caught up with all these women
yet everytime I hit the club I keep collecting digits
today I sent my dawg a letter, told him that we miss him
and how it's so fucked up he got to be in this position
nobody wants to help us, but they judge us cause we sipping
on goose, and taking blunts to the head to release the tension
respect my way of thinking, or one day you gonna be wishing
I never put you to the side and worried about these riches

HOOK:
I guess I'm getting selfish, but I can't really help it
I feel alone and I can't trust nobody but my weapon
in front of me they smiling, behind me they be frowning
and I just wonder why the fuck they wanna come around me
(x2)

I realize I've been a shallow friend
I promise that right now I'm better than I ever been
I close my eyes and pray to God to please forgive my sins
and matter fact, forgive the ones I'm gonna commit again
cause I don't have good friends that help me do good things
we got good dro, hoes, good links
I'm riding in the whip and fired up while I play this thunder
I get real high and think about down under
I'm thinking "man aint none of these motherfuckers loyal"
they all impostors, I bring them crabs to a boil
I'm stating this from all the information that I coiled
I'm sticking to my word until I'm buried in the soil
and man it seem like all these hoes aint nothing but groupies
they trying to act like wifey, all they want to do is screw me
forget a verse, I feel like I could write a book, a movie
I'm going through it, damn right I'm motherfuckin moody
I'm feeling like ya boy Faheim I'm going through a lot
the jack boys plot and police wanna see me locked
and even when the better days come, this will never stop
so if you plan to come around, I think you better not, I know...

HOOK:
I guess I'm getting selfish, but I can't really help it
I feel alone and I can't trust nobody but my weapon
in front of me they smiling, behind me they be frowning
and I just wonder why the fuck they wanna come around me
