[Intro: D-Sisive]
I'm feelin somethin somethin underneath my sneakers
so run, run, around the world (around the world)
Around the world (around the world)

[Slim Twig]
Heat! As the baton twirls
{*next two lines are slurred*}
World of his caved in
There's nothing dating the impulse itself
it imposes itself and it's there
or left in the rain, let the story explain
(I'm scared) Foe packing disguises
Hidden in bushes, under grey skies
All for one, {?} blow to the world
Blow to the girl...
I wish for a fistful of curls
{*more slurred lyrics delivered*}
And a lesson that left me bereaved and unfurled
I dipped around the world

[Chorus: D-Sisive]
I'm feelin somethin somethin underneath my sneakers
so run, run, around the world (around the world)
Around the world (around the world)
I'm sceamin louder now that I can see what I was feeling
So run, around the world (around the world)
Around the world (around the world)

[D-Sisive]
A boy in a box is a boy with a problem
Born with a strong-gripped palm on a Glock
Boy did he pop those boys running hard
to avoid being targetted, boy did they drop
Boy did the boy ignore the remorse
most boys come across when a loaded is shot
towards other boys that bothered the boy
Boys picked on the wrong boy to assault
Now the boys sleep with their faces on concrete
Concrete jungle meet the jungle boy
Boy did the police tackle the boy
Even though boy sat not making a noise
Why would the boy escape?
A race would only make his situation crazy
Some say the boy needed saving
Some say the boy was trying to save himself

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
