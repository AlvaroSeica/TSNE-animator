Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we bout' that action
He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action
I lost so many niggaz, turned into a savage
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clappin
Where I'm from the Chiraq, you get that fast attraction
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic
And where I'm from that's 300 normal, spelled backwards

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Letting a nigga go on me, I can't imagine
But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic
My niggaz shoot for free, they'll let you have it
My niggaz do it for me, ain't no way around it
Blood hound for that money, bitch I gotta have it
Going crazy, 20's, 50's, 100's, bitch I'm cashing
And I ain't really with the talking, bitch I'm money stacking
And he ain't really bout' that life, cus' he don't love that action
And they don't come from where I come from, they won't born a savage
Late night shit, catch him in traffic
I ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic
And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
We don't really play, homie we bout gun action
Pistols get to flappin', ball like the Mavericks
Chief Keef bitch I'm savage, I'm paper stackin'
Pistols get to clappin', niggaz get the lapping
Bad bitches packed up, inside a Maxima
That bitch gon' give me neck, neck like a dracula
Fuck nigga, talk shit, delete him, no schedule
That bitch want some ransom, she say I'm handsome
I need me a dancer, to come and dance up on me while I'm wallin' and throwing sets up
I need me a dancer, to come and dance up on me while I'm wallin' and throwing sets up

[Chorus]</pre>
