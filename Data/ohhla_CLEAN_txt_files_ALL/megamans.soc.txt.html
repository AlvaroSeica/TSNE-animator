[Soce]
Cannisters of energy
Bosses in my old phone
I should use their weaponry
I've been in this level too long
The man that I would try
is always such a good guy
But I'm filled with power ups
So I'ma call him anyway, and say

[Chorus One: Soce]
Fuck that robot that you love so bad
You are old enough that you could be his dad
I say fuck that robot that you think you found
He'll put you in danger I'll keep you safe and sound

[Interlude One: Soce]
I'm just sayin you could do better
Why don't you spend the night in my castle?
I'm just sayin you could do, better
I'll call off my robots and save you the hassle

[Soce]
You've got a full beard
I've got a bald spot
We are both Doctors
Together we'd be so hot
Workin on your robot
What you doin that's so important?
I try to take over the world it's true
But I'd give it all to you so

[Chorus Two: Soce]
Fuck that robot that you love so bad
You are old enough that you could be his dad
He's got a girlfriend and a trusty dog
I will treat you as much more than just a cog

[Interlude Two: Soce]
I'm just sayin you could do better
Please come over, boy don't tease me
I'm just sayin you could do, better
I will give you a yashichi

[Soce]
I'm too shy, so I send bad guys to do my bidding
And you send Mega Man, but who are we kidding?
You know that it's me and you - I want nuptials
We should be a couple like Cliff and Clair Huxtable
The obstacle course has rocks to the doors
You gotta, collect the bombs then you lob them with force
The Rush adaptors are the key to explore
When you've covered the main path and you need to see more
How 'bout a detour? Every single time we play the same game
Mass destruction reigns, and I take the blame
I should be hoppin that you're bigger and more mature
I can offer you riches way beyond what's at your corner stoe
I've got a spaceship with chromed out rims
So much land at my disposal I don't know where to begin
But it means nothing if you're not with me
I'm gonna go join Megaman Legends Part 3
