Song:   Never Say Goodbye
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[English Translation]
Meets always end with separation
Maybe I shouldn't have loved
People always see the end someday
Maybe I shouldn't have been born

The world is bad and life hurts
So I pretend to cry but it's no use
So I smile

Never say goodbye
Because nothing is forever, there's no such thing as an eternal goodbye
Never say goodbye
Because I know we'll meet again, we smile as we leave

They leave when the applause starts, a beautiful separation
Life lives on Â– tie up your worries
Remember the memories, recollect the recollections
Even if you cry your eyes out, tears dry up
Comedies and tragedies are all plays that have an end, life is just an instance of those
Out of my remaining days, I'm the youngest today
So I'm leaving to somewhere again

People are bad, love hurts
So I pretend to be dead but it's no use
So get up

Never say goodbye
Because nothing is forever, there's no such thing as an eternal goodbye
Never say goodbye
Because I know we'll meet again, we smile as we leave

I did all that I could
So will I have no regrets?

Meets always end with separation
Maybe I shouldn't have loved

Comedies and tragedies are all plays that have an end, life is just an instance of those
Out of my remaining days, I'm the youngest today
So I'm leaving to somewhere again

Never say goodbye
Because nothing is forever, there's no such thing as an eternal goodbye
Never say goodbye
Because I know we'll meet again, we smile as we leave
