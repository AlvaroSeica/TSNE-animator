	(Lee Majors)
If I could rule the world like Kurtis
I'd wear my crown to a tilt
garnish the world with fine silk
and look over what I build and say
wicked are those who cross the path of righteous men
let me start again (for what)
for those who can't comprehend
lee majors
the virus
niggas they run from us
we the spot runners
i'll snatch your land like colombus
take crews in large numbers
who'll be the 1st to seal their fate
and make me play the album
I'm out to rule the world 
while you talk about your silly glasses
half-ass rappers can't match this 
the shit I practice
shakes the world off its axis
your vaginal flow can't compete with my 
god like tactics
sharp as a cactus
my personnel behind doors
getting ready building missles for the next world war
I kidnapped the president's wife
strapped with a butter knife
planned to take her life in exchange for insight
about the new world order
my troops will move across the border
with plans to overthrow your government
seal up the border
more than a corner
the whole earth is a game
we bout to take over this world
like the brain
man your shit is insane
	(Lee Majors 2nd verse)
my crew line up like picket fences
cautious
no remorses
we squaring off on the oval office
shacked up on iron horses
no playas
just coaches
deep like army ants on the backs of roaches
you can't approach us
my team's strapped with knowledge of self
giving love to a few
hated by everyone else
coz up on the earth it's kind of hard to maintain
we 'bout to take over this world
like the brain
show 'em what you mean

	(Lee Majors 3rd verse)
face to face
the mics embraced
tracks is laced
if I ruled the world
I'd create a whole master race
in distant lands
where they quote my rhymes and scriptures
words feel like hitler's worst shit
my baby pictures
lovin' me
using my old clothes for currency
words against me
blasphemy
see it has to be
ask me
my faculty will stomp through like genghis
rappers get extinguished through flows that we relenquish
I mean this
dope since the stage of a fetus
nowadays they still cant fix my broken english
so find a exit
when we come through we rule the world like the brain</pre>
