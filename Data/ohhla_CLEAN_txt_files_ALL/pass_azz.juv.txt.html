[Juvenile]
Everybody wanna be a real azz nigga
Sometimes they wanna fight cha
Sometimes they pull the trigger
Everybody wanna be a real azz nigga
Sometimes they wanna fight cha
Sometimes they pull the trigger

What does it take to be a real azz nigga?
You coward azz nigga, you fake azz nigga
First thing, you gotta be down, ya heard me
So listen to your ma and don't get mad trying to serve me
Now a days niggas be starting a rappin
Jealous out they're mouth cause they know what I'm stressing
It's true, niggas take me way way back
To my home, to my home, to my ma and my mac
I love my boys they have alot of respect yah
I be Juvenile, I'll never forget ya

[Juvenile]
Now I'm about to talk about these niggas
The ones that talk alot of shit and make their rump a little bigger
If you be stutterin, you a pass azz nigga, 
pass azz nigga, a pass azz nigga
If you don't like me, you a pass azz nigga, 
pass azz nigga, a pass azz nigga
Now I'm about to talk about these niggas
The ones that talk alot of shit and make their rump a little bigger
If you be stutterin, you a pass azz, 
pass azz, a pass azz nigga
If you don't like me, you a pass azz, 
pass azz, a pass azz nigga

[Juvenile]
Niggas are droppin
Police is stoppin
They jump in your car
Just to see who you are
So I'm a pass azz nigga
Just come and handcuff a nigga
Pass azz, pass azz, pass coward azz nigga

[Juvenile]
The niggas in my hood ain't nuttin but hustlers
You say you might be down, but we still don't trust ya
We knew his face, we didn't know his name
Bout to show this motherfucker we true to the game
My boy grabbed a nine and I grabbed a 47
A 37 and grabbed a mack 11
We see these fellas trying creepin our tape
Put fire on his ass and blew the fucker away
He tried to run, but we caught him on the melia
Had to take him out cause he's a pass azz nigga
Pass azz nigga, pass azz nigga, pass azz nigga
I can't stand no pass azz nigga
Pass azz nigga, pass azz nigga
I can't stand no pass azz nigga
Pass azz nigga, pass azz nigga

[Juvenile]
Where ya from, Where ya from
I come, I come from right out the magnolia
Coming, coming, coming straight from the magnolia
Coming, coming, coming straight from the magnolia
Coming, coming, coming straight from the magnolia
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga

[Juvenile]
You used to be real, you used to be down
But you turned a bitch when quick left town
You used to be in the clan, and all that cest
But now I heard you even less
Like a nigga like me out from the magnolia
When you like a bitch, and went out like a solja
Everytime I see you all in the mess
You got the slugs in your mouth, swear to god, you a pimp
With yout shine ass car and nothin left
Got niggas selling boards and mef's
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
Pass Azz Nigga
