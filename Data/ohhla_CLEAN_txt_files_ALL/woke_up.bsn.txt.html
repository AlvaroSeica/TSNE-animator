Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Big Sean and James Fantleroy]
I woke up
Boy it's time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up
Feeling like the mothafuckin' realest
Living but it's time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Bridge: Sean]
Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)
Tell these fuck boys they gotta pay
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)

[Verse 1: Sean]
I woke up, woke up, thank God I woke up
Wifey at home but I'm living life like we broke up
You hit the hood and post up, I'm gon' get it til I'm filthy rich
My hands dirty, my gross up, my money doing the toe touch
That's stretched out, til I'm in the back, stretched out, drinking Ace
Cause I'm decked out, whole hood with me
Need a guest house, yea a guest house
Lately I been getting like mo' ass and less mouth
Cause when they see that whip, they start to think about kids
Man, when they see this crib, they gon' start to think about cribs
Been dealt with real life too long, now it's time to live
Respect out the D, hardly had a pot to pee in
Now I'm at the Coliseum, lil' niggas gotta see him
Tryna be him, show you how to follow vision, real nigga
Politician, bad bitch, swallowtician, gotta get it
Yea (yea), last night I lost all that
I'ma wake my ass up, get it all back, thank God

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Say It Aint Tone]
I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, living like I won't see the night
A real playa like Pinky, when I'm in the game, I TD
And I'm all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, that's 3D
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high
Last week, I was so high, I felt drunk
I got a bitch so bad, I gotta hit from the front
I fuck Kim K hoes, that's Jay Ye tone, smoking weed, that's reggaeton
Get it next to free, that's AJ tone, what's my name
What's my name bitch? Sayitainttone, what she saying? Sayitainttone
Who they playing? Sayitainttone, fuck sleep that take too long!

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
I woke up this morning
Looking at the city that raised me
I can get it all now
And go get everything they never gave me

[Verse 4: Early Mac]
Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake
I'ma do dessert first, I don't even gotta wait
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray
By the way, my jewelry appraised, it's a couple K
On the lake, I'm out of the state, at my hideaway
Like Bruce Wayne, I'm saving the day, and I'm getting bank
I'm foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I po' up
Ok it's Early Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold
I'm fooling

[Chorus]</pre>
