[Chorus]
I'm feeling experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
Tryin' to cope with all this shit I've been through
These substances is fucking with my mental
My mental, I'm so experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental

[Verse 1]
Big blunts of that kush ducked off in that phantom
Can't no nigga do life this life I live I lench
Bunch of hoes in my mattress getting trippy off them bars
I don't do no handcuffin toss 'em to my dog
'Bout to start a bank all this money that I made, cash
Sour D, the smoking biff niggas getting paid
Bunch of bad bitches begging Juice to fuck
Drinking 'til I throw up smoking 'til I'm stuffed
Loud kush you can hear when I walk by
The room is moving side to side I'm feeling hypnotized
Getting faded in the phantom ain't no stopping the ride
These niggas smoking dirt acting like they high

[Chorus]
I'm feeling experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
Tryin' to cope with all this shit I've been through
These substances is fucking with my mental
My mental, I'm so experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental

[Verse 2]
Ok rolling weed while I'm sexing
Rolling weed while I drive, swerve
Rolling weed while I'm rolling weed
Getting high when I'm high
I be getting high when I'm high
Getting high when you not
Getting high on the low
Getting high oh my God
I just ate a edible edible
Swear to God I feel incredible
Swear that my textin is no longer legible
I got the pussy you put on the pedestal
Tell 'em to leave and come bring me back revenue
Getting paid down down down to the decimal
Medical vegetable I'm so professional
My life's a festival I'm just an investitor
In a mental
I feel like I just jumped out the window
Rolling OG, kush purple indoor
Right here outdoor in the indo
Weed is my crescendo ok so now we rollin'
She just popped her a pillie got her feeling all silly
Rolling paper from Philly

[Chorus]
I'm feeling experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
Tryin' to cope with all this shit I've been through
These substances is fucking with my mental
My mental, I'm so experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental

[Verse 3]
She asking me questions even though she know I don't know
Her pussy the best and she give the best blowjobs on blow
She love the way that I dress and the way that I stroke
She said she never sip lean I said I never did coke
I'm good I'm smoking I'm leanin' I'm tryin' to stay focused
Got my loc's on the chieffen' hope these mollys ain't bogus
We got hoes in the front got lean in the back
Getting head in the back got fix in the lag
Got xannies on deck bitch
Take these shots to the neck
We's gots ta connect we off in this club purple spice like it's nothing
Bitch just told me she ain't coming home with me unless we fucking
And she got a friend and they got some ins
Pleas don't mention your nigga 'cause I don't care 'bout your man
Now me and 2 hoes we on, we be true so they gone
Now we having a threesome in the whip on the way home

[Chorus]
I'm feeling experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
Tryin' to cope with all this shit I've been through
These substances is fucking with my mental
My mental, I'm so experimental
Just pop 2 now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental </pre>
