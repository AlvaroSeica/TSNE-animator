[It's the way I hold you (x7)]

[Masta Ace]
I will never forget the day that we first met
I wasn't even feelin you then but worse yet
I was all up in the mix with one of your friends
and when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins
like if I only knew what I was missin
I would quit kissing on this chick and change my position
I really thought you and my man was a better match
I never thought you was the type that I could catch
I used to see you out in the park with different cats
them big willie types that rocked them pimp hats
had every other guy on the block trying to get you
wishing that they had that rap to get with you
felt you was out of my league
its like if you was silk and linen then I was fatigue
I never would have pictured you and me together
but its like the way I hold you we was meant to be together
come on.

[Chorus]
[It's the way I hold you (x8)]

The way I hold you it feels so good (yeah)
I don't ever wanna let you go(a-ha)
can't see you with nobody else, (no)
I just really had to let you know,(yeah)
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you

[Masta Ace]
Now I spend most of my time just being with you
early on I was afraid to be seen with you
cuz I knew cats would do anything they could
to stop us from being together, its all good
they was mad cuz I got you and they didn't
some even tried to approach me I'm not kidding
had to be ten times I got into a fight
with niggas tried to say I wasn't hitting it right -
They kept on hating just kept on waiting
hoping that we'd break up but we kept dating
never knew it would be so hard to be with you
I should make it easy on my self and just quit you.

[Make it easy on myself x2)
I need to make it easy on my self
Yup, I need to make it easy on my self
Yup, I need to make it easy on my self
and just leave you alone

No Wait! When I hold you if feels so great
I realize and recognize that you're my soul mate
Its us forever had to let you know
its like I told you imma hold you never let you go
come on.

[Chorus]

[Jean Grae]
One-Two check it
you should have known from way back I tried to amp you
try to speak on your skillz when other niggas felt me
but you know that if you wasn't with me they can't even hear you right
and if you try to snatch me up it'd probably turn into a fight
I been through my phases with cats and shakes
I know you seen me chillin' with fake players
who tried to grab me in the club and dance with me on the stage in gators
they say you just hatin
-you jealous of the money that they're makin
Peep stripper broads, thugs in golds and punks
Cats would front, get me high with all the smoke from the blunts
its not love its just lust
they always put me down when shit gets rough,
I can't do it alone, I need someone to hold me right tell me their feelings
speak on us to they boys, that's why we dealin
niggas startin rumors like we ain't chilling or split up
when you've been writing poems for me just to shut they lip up
and there's still cats who try to touch me when they spot me alone
try to tap me just to see if im turned on
but it's the way you speak to me
its like we on the same frequency
and when you hold me, you make peak
come on

[Chorus]</pre>
