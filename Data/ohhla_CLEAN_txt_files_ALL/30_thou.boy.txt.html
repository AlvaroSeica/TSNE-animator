Soulja! {*2X*}

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Thirty, thousand, hundred, million
All my niggaz go, so, crazy, in this, fuckin, buildin

[Soulja Boy]
Word around town I got bitches on my dick (Soulja)
Word around town I got cameras taking pics (cameras)
Word around town mane I'm hot than a bitch (scorchin)
Word around town I spent three million on my wrist (true story)
Word around town I spent twelve million on my crib (foxtail)
Word around town bitch, that's just how I live (some say)
Word around town bitch my dick taste like ribs (some say)
Word around town bitch, what happened to...

Soulja! {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[Lil B]
S-550, drive with my swagger
Hoes on my dick cause I rock like Mick Jagger
Ten on my hoe, and I'm sharp like a dagger
Pineapple shawty and my bitch look like an actress
Young Based God, flex bitches on my dick
Young Based God, tell police suck my dick
Playboy mansion, chillin' with Hugh Hefner
West Berkeley nigga, waterfront on my sweatshirt (you feel me?)

Soulja! {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[Arab]
Oooooh~! A-rab, money, cheech
S.O.D. money gang, I think yo' have heard my name
'Rab, Soulja, B, uhh, makin dollars all day
Fine bitches on a nigga, hater niggaz fade away
Diamond grill on me shit
S.O.D. run this year, Rex, S.O.D. in here
Swag, swag, smoke that power pack (hey boy)
Paper chasin, money makin, diss they catch a counter-attack

Soulja! {*2X*}
