[Verse 1]
Blinded - when you can't see what's coming
But you're sure you hear something, first reaction - start running
Gunning down the hill till the pace catches up
Laces run a muck, soon enough face tastes of blood spill
Drill drive and dentistry, out spoken speaks up at assembly
Couldn't keep the words from drawing this destiny
Irrational is international and it travels with your visa form of identity, huh
Blinded - dramatic overacted song and dance
Shakes your leisurely stroll, got your feet off balance
Now you're jumping up and down, a rock and roll snare drum
Runs vibrations, interlacing with your 2006 digital console
Control on the whole is only half there, blindfolded, unaware
Of what the thin air had to offer, not the Mocha that will wake you up
Blinded - like right off your guts over the edge like your time is up
Fired up on the cup that brushes up your confidence
Start throwing around cue cards of all your accomplishments
Common sense sinks to the bottom of honest dominance
Now the arse hole within this claim in prominence
Wake up in the morning wondering where the hell my wallet went
Blinded - when you think you know it all
Stubborn thick skin splinters can't penetrate
Let 'em make covering, smothering room for breathe
Glad wrap surrounding the chest - poke holes through it
Never said sorry now you blew it - left lonely in pain
Holding the cellophane pane and look through it
Left 'em in the dark, now you're the one who looks stupid
Look, excuses don't change the fact you lack the ability to let go
Blinded - you ain't that considerate, we're X absorbing the oblivious
Walking past cries of help, felt like happy music
The one-way conversations with a dead end
Muted, tutored by the best in their field
Everybody you knew, knew how to steal attention
Thieving their name to get a mention
But you're blinded by the fact that you do the same thing
The lessons etched in your subconscious
A certain fondness that goes beyond just being proud of who you are
A superstar ego, we've all seen those
Blinded - by the beauty and the beat that her cheeks make when they speak to me
Back turned, gaining distance, I feel less free
She's really what I want, becoming something that I fiend
Like something of a dream, stunning high beam stays
Forgetting what the hell I was doing
Sometimes confusion, inter-fuses with what we see
We've all had a time when the mind's been blinded - and now you see</pre>
