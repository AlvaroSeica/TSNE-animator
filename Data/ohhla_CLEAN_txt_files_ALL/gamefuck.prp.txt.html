[Kelo The Work]
Now this is to them weak ass niggas flaugin, talkin about they gonna play our song
Quit dream sellin, stop frontin, yall ain't real jone
All yall tryin to do is hold us up and set up road blocks
Stop that shit pimp before I pull out my glock and pop
Fully loaded with my ammo when I'm ready to bust
I told you fuck-boys once before, man, I ain't with that stuff
Nigga I done ran wit'cha, roll wit'cha, and hit hoes wit'cha
Now my folks can peep you out and know what? they get the picture
Cause suckers, yall ain't real and yall need to quit fakin'
And stop ballin' motherfucking player hatin', quit traitin'
Cause I'm the K to the E to the L to the O The Work off in this fuckin' hoe
Man, yall niggas ain't real dog, I thought I'd let yall bitches know
Yall got the game fucked up
Yeah, yall got the game fucked up
Nigga, yall got the game fucked up
When I see you big boys I'ma pull out my tool so duck

Yall niggas got the game fucked up, got the game fucked up, got the game fucked up
Yall niggas, yall niggas got the game fucked up, got the game fucked up
Get buck after dumb shit
Yall yall niggas got the game fucked up
got the game fucked up, got- got- got the game fucked up
Yall niggas, yall niggas got the game fucked up
*stratching* Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid ass nigga still ain't ready

[Nick Scarfo]
Yall niggas got the game fucked up
Nick Scar, but the hoes call me Nickiopolis
I know that this ain't christmas but I'm still Saint Nick
Man, I can build a mansion with all these bricks (ha-ha!)
Naw Kelo, I don't need no witnesses
Before I go to court the case already dismissed
And I ain't dodging punk-ass federalis no more
Prophet Posse Da Posse, meet the C.E.O. (E.O.)
Yall niggas got the game fucked up
See we don't fuck with yall, cause yall don't fuck with us (fuck with us)
But the streets show love, that's off top
Fans bumping us before the Prophet Posse albums drop
So stop asking me about Three-Six
In your interviews like I'm gonna be all over that dick
I started this shit, who the fuck you think I am
I'm glad they won the Oscar but really I don't give a damn

[Hook]

[Capt. B]
These niggas ain't gripping a mic, they talkin about Capt. B, I'm back sucker
Bitch I'm a hustler, I'm still gonna shine motherfucker
You niggas know me, the one that caught with 44 bows
I went to jail, did my time, hooked up with Scarfo
See I ain't never been a hoe, you know how I get down
Yall got the game fucked up, I man-up on these clowns
Now my own niggas turning on me, what should I do
I hear you tellin niggas fuck me, no nigga fuck you
See you ain't real as I thought
You wasn't down when I got caught 
Sucker you fake it ain't my fault (yeaah)
You ain't down with the clan now the word is born (word is born)
Now we moving twelve bricks of that white chalk
See I'm boss, took a loss, bounce back slow (back slow)
Now I'm Prophet with a Posse with a Kelo
See niggas hate cause they know about to blow
But I ain't worried about them suckers, tell them niggas to get some doe, fo' sho'
