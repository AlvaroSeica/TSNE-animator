Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Krazie]
You felt that we should part and so I walked away
Mentioned something bout your head and how you needed some space
Needed time to think and decide what you wanted
Didn't know if you were happy or even if I mounted up
To everything you had in mind about me and you
Till we ended up together two months later we were through
And I was tripping you were gone lost yourself in the process
You weren't the same vato I met counted my losses
And I teared up I couldn't let it go it was mi vida ya perdida
Tuve que conformarme y ser tu amiga y nada mas

[Chorus]
Haven't I haven't I tried to be good to you
And because of this you thought you found a fool
I know your lovely and sweet as can be
But I'm not gonna let you take advantage of me

[Krazie]
Wanted to have me waiting till you made up your mind
Didn't think about the pain I would feel at the time
Cause when I ever thought about it it would trill me
But just being around you for a second
Would have killed me
I tried to take it in and give you my support
But within days of losing me I seen you with some whore
You said you needed time and I'm guessing time to fuck
Thats when it clicked up with me you had no luck
You didn't know whats up and I realized it then
We will make all this shit up and our relationship pretend
Are you serious homie

[Chorus]
Haven't I haven't I tried to be good to you
And because of this you thought you found a fool
I know your lovely and sweet as can be
But I'm not gonna let you take advantage of me

[Krazie]
I loved you I truly did and that I cant deny
But one can only take so much before she says goodbye
My ex came back around and held me close during the struggle
And during all that time forgetting you I had no trouble
See its firme I finally found what happiness was
Waking up smiling not feeling a buzz
Without the drogas desmadre while thinking of you
Wasting all my time while you made me a fool
You did me wrong and you know it
But I hold nothing against you
I had to learn a lesson from the cosas that we went through
And now I know</pre>
