[Chorus]
Yeah I play my music LOUD!
I betcha you feel me coming down the block
The thunder in the trunk gon' knock
You know I play my music LOUD!
And yup I got the neighbors losing sleep
From the way I crank it up and let it beat
Yeah
Turn it up like
(Boom boom boom boom)
Let it beat like
(Bang bang bang bang)
Turn it up like
(Boom boom boom boom)
Let it beat like
(Bang bang bang bang)
Turn it up like
(Boom boom boom boom)
Let it beat like
(Bang bang bang bang)
Turn it up like
(Boom boom boom boom)
Let it bang
Let it bang

[Verse 1]
Pulled up in a bucket, blowing on a blunt
Beat hittin like brrrump bump bump
Crack I crease sound like a big bitch
In the back trying get up out a little nigga trunk
Turn heads for I even hit the block
Lil kids running up when they hear the beat knock
Crank it to the max whenever I pass cops
Hearts keep a beat whenever the bass drop
My shit is quakin got my rearview vibrating
Pulled up next to my gran momma at the red light got her wig shaking
Seeing purple is what I'm tasting
Finna do some baby making
Gotta chop ta sixfy sitting next to me
Bitch lookin like some nialating
Hey sunday morning 'round eleven robot erupting in the reveren
I'll probably lose my hearing by the time I'm twenty-seven
It's a shame
But I need that dang
To vibrate my frame
ABS my game
Have to do a little switch up can a a player get strange
I tell my biatrice to quit yappin later or we gon' get nasty
You can do whatever you like to me, we can do classic or get trashy
Matter fact we ain't even gotta go to the crib girl we can do it in the back seat
For now sit back relax and let this beat massage your ass cheeks

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Prada]
It's WHO
Prada
Jesus that nigga that came with the heat that you needed
Loving the way it all hella hated on
Hungry little niggas 'bout ta eat till the plate is gone
Gotta flamer on, 'bout to step into the danger zone
Mind as well go ahead and call the cops
'cause 'em loud ass next door neighbors are home
Yeah
And we come up to tear the block up
Beat it loud banging like blocka, them bitches jock us
That why these niggas mock us but they not us, and it not just
Music with me and my partner, we done put time in this bitch so how can you stop us
Prada (WHAT) Get 'e
Can I get up in the rhythm of the money
For the woman with 'em other niggas in the city to shred now
I'll never make let 'em hear now,
Got it made now,
Gettin' hoes now
Gettin laid now
Cause when I getta laying down,
Gettin paid now
You motherfucker shouldn't hella from the say now
Gotta middle finger for yall scratch that I ain't even thinkin' of ya'll Pass that
So pass the gat to the back
Where I'm sitting now with the kitty cat I'ma laugh when I'm gettin' now
Roll down the window and let the beat slap (??) and strange you can't beat that
That's what it's all about Paul
Don't be hatin' on a nigga cause a nigga gotta a little bit of cloud boy
Shit talk shit down anyways
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth BOY

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
They don't want me to live in the end of my block
'cause when I get to the killer I don't stop
Partyin' with the ladies I pull in Mercedes you know we gonna
BANG BIG SOUND
We kickin' it loud at 3 o'clock on the spot
Pouring liquor around we doin' shot till we drop
Every once in a while we get a knock from the cops saying
TURN SHIT DOWN
Yup
My neighbors probably wishin' I resided in hella prison
'cause they always tellin' me and mack to turn down our Television
And we got it into our stereo, you would think the scenario running lights
I got the mic when the bass kick hit very low
I can't help 'cause I like it loud I hype the crowd
I party and I despise the cloud
It might be froul the neighbors wanna fight me now
In the night we growl the woman excite me wow
So with the volume button 'cause I be bustin' the thang
And I don't wanna nobody hearin' us when we bang
So I turn up the music and then lust then we came
Now I know the neighbors know my name
Can't help 'cause that's my style
More beat then a lolla loud
'bout to get me a killer in the country
Nobody to hump me tellin' me to
TURN IT DOWN!
I'm gonna live it really black and proud
Go up in the yard nigga reveren in doubt
Until the cops run up to me and then I crack a smile

[Chorus]</pre>
