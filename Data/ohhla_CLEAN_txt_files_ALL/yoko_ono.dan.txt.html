[Verse 1: Che Grand]
Listen
My mind work a little different
I can see the vivid in the most vague description
Try not to be a hypocrite
Everything can kill you, don't smoke cigarettes
Binge quick the dollar menu
Folk crazy hate you in the same vein they shootin' heroin in
That's why either way, I don't listen
The point you've been missin'? I'm hot
You strugglin' like tryin' to warm a mansion
With a stove in the kitchen
It might happen with a little bit of patience
A case of pneumonia, whole lot of prayin'
European euphoria, I need a Desparate Wife
Like a Eva Longoria, I can see the whore in ya
Huh, and your gimmicks is fresh hardly
Pardon me, my interest is to get that money
Fuck being in the Concrete Loop and makin' buddies
That's a buddy with a female anatomy and she's smutty
The answer is Grizzy, the question is what's really better
Than your average backpacker doin' a lot of chatter?
Who want a lot of cheddar, it's not for flossin'
My whole fam got a gift that need endorsin'
So I'm takin' a portion and givin' it back
Other than that I'm fixin' to throw some D's on the 'Lac
Desalena Pass, we can talk when I get back
Cook a little more audio crack
"Grand" tatted on the small of her back, and Danny she like that
(She like that?) She like that Danny, she like that
(She like that?) She like that Danny, she...

[Verse 2: Danny!]
Blessed with a style but
You clones messin' my style up
Big mess in my house, wrestlin' with Jessica Alba
I dubbed this whole album on tape decks for nostalgia
Let me break it down for ya
I defy the standards, I supply the anthems
Hold rap for ransom, y'all ain't gettin' it back
I seen all these wack niggas get championed
Yo where's the love for Danny and Grand?
Far be it from me, I'm tryin' to set an example
You wack niggas startin' to run out of Curtis Mayfield records to sample
So I +Hit 'Em Wit Da Hee+, took it overseas
Now my crates bigger than Quarter Pounders With Cheese
Resort to poundin' my keys if it needs enhancement
Y'all niggas STILL sample Gladys Knight? Goddamn, son
Not again, get your hands out the dollar bin
Don't fake moves, take cues from Colin Quinn
'Cause I swear, some of y'all are better off as comedians
I gave you the blueprint, but you can't be him
I gave you a few hints, but you can't see him
D.I.Y. 2.0, go cop my new joint yo
2003, made y'all aware of my prophesy
Beats, rhymes, equal on both sides, isoceles
Arrogant, I gotta be
The derelicts might bother me
Claim non-violence then chop you in your larynx (it's hypocrisy!)
So 'til the kid's Def Jux debut
(Whenever that is!) Wish him the best of luck, stay tuned
They tried to play me but they can't fade me
I call this track "Yoko Ono" 'cause this bitch is crazy
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can)
Yo can I kick it? (Go on then)</pre>
