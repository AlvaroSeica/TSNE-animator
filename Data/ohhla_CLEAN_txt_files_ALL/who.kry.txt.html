[Intro: Kryme Life]
Yeah, nigga, we here, been a long time
T.M.F. in the flesh, nigga
But we still here, think you can fuck with my squad
Youknowhatimsaying, who, where they at, tell me who
Tell me who want it, tell me who want it
Tell me who..., tell me who want it

[Kryme Life]
This for all my niggas who ship coke, flip pies, and pitch dope
And we living real fine, niggas aren't broke
Go, flip a nigga offline, try to get close
I keep a nine, keep a point that's fine
Kryme keep the ambition in grind, spots been deceased
It's my time now, feel like it's been a century
That's my word, let it hang up, woudln't mention me
Put the fire on 'em, make 'em burn rotisserie
I come from a long line of gangstas
Understand I come from a long line of anger
Done got my way up out of all kinds of danger
This is why I don't indentify with strangers
Only fuck with fam, try to fuck with my plans
I'mma see you in the field, boy, his guns don't jam
It's their time, let ya'll pay homage, young nigga
We ain't spitting no more, straight rhyming on niggas
T.M.F. in the flesh, fingers throwing up, what?
Watch me like Jamie Kennedy and see how I'm 'blowing up'
Same my enemy in the street, and I tore him up
What, you can see it inside my face
It's going down, if a nigga violate my space
From the hood of all hoods, rep New York state
Gatting Island, we slave niggas get no more rhymes
When I come through, lights out, no more shine, let's go

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
Who do it like Kryme New York
Who do it like Trife Dies' and Tomahawk
Nobody, who come through and tear cyphers up
Eating MC's, claming that they nice as fuck, that's us
Who got the knock, put your speakers on blast
You ain't saying nothing, you ain't talking bout cash
Who still in the hood and bang with the best
That's us, T.M.F. in the flesh, yes

[Kryme Life]
It ain't hard, to see who make the hood pop, product on sale
All up in the street corner, throwing back ale
Who be them niggas with that white block like Zale's
Diamonds on j's, got it locked like jails
Do twelve, two way team, niggas know get CREAM
And who wreck, you may see 'em
You'se a bird, I'm clip your wings, and pluck your feathers
Walk with them things tucked under a leather
You ain't built for this, kid, get it, get it together
This year, ya'll all gon' get it together
Face down with a tray pound, selling ya sweater
Niggas praying on my downfall, hoping I slip
Thought Kryme lost a slip to the wrist, but he wasn't comfortable
With the grip, a few niggas got snuffed in the whip
When I was broke, making wish after wish
But now I'm in the studio, it's hit after hit, I can't miss

[Chorus]</pre>
