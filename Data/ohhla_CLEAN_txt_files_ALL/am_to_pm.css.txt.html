[Intro]
I still move work, from the A.M. to the P.M.
Niggaz got beef, I'ma spray 'em when I see 'em {*2X*}

[Cassidy]
I pump on the street from the A.M. to the P.M.
A nigga want beef, I'ma spray 'em when I see 'em
Lay 'em when I see 'em, AK 'em when I see 'em
Hop out the Bronco, I'll O.J. 'em when I see 'em
Cut a bone out his skin, fish fo-lay 'em when I see 'em
Then wire his grill, Kanye 'em when I see 'em
My young'uns on their job, so I pay 'em when I see 'em
Turn Boyz II Men, I'll Wanya 'em when I see 'em
Cause I be on the grind from the P.M. to the A.M.
Paint pictures with my rhymes, you can see 'em when I say 'em
My songs like movies you can see 'em when you play them
If a nigga want beef, when I see 'em I'ma spray 'em
For six G's, I could get your whip swiss chessed
I'm like a red nose pit, you a mixed breed
Bitch please, all 'em dudes in your crew ass
I'll get you strangled with the strings on your doo-rag

[Chorus]
I still move work from the A.M. to the P.M.
Niggaz got beef, I'ma spray 'em when I see 'em
I still move work from the A.M. to the P.M.
Niggaz got beef, I'ma spray 'em when I see 'em

[Cassidy]
I'ma let you niggaz talk all stupid, 'til you get hawked all stupid
Sparked all stupid, outlined in chalk all stupid
Dog I bite I don't bark all stupid, it is what it is
I'm in the coupe roof dropped all stupid
Fitted hat cocked all stupid, gettin' top off stupid
My clientele cop all stupid
Make sales on the block all stupid, it is what it is
It's a fact that I rap all stupid
Get your wig pushed back all stupid
We strapped all stupid, I'll get you clapped all stupid
Don't let the pills and the yack make you act all stupid
Yeah, I do my thing all stupid, let my chain bling all stupid
My ring all stupid and my earring all stupid
I got them things and I slang all stupid

[Chorus]

[Cassidy]
Yo, my flow'll have you amazed and astonished
I been hot since I got my first Sega with Sonic
Back in the days when Shawn Kemp played for the sonics
I rocked the huge jeans and I played the atonics
You know I blow haze, I be blazing the chronic
It got my mind scrambled like the egg in a omelette
I talk to God every day, and he made me a promise
Me and T like Malcolm and Alicia Mohammed
Me and Swizz like Martin and Jessy
But the fact that I can get assassinated, is startin to stress me
I ain't tryna let the police department arrest me
But I still keep steel tucked under the fresh tee
And I ain't just rapping for my health
So before you diss me, you be betta off clappin' at yourself
Cause I ain't tryna battle on the mic
I have them goons hop out on you like they did Harrell at the light
