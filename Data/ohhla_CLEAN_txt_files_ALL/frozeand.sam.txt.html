Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x3]
All this ice on my neck got me froze
All the kush in the air got me blowed
All the kush in the air got me blowed
All the kush in the air got me blowed
All this ice on my neck got me froze
Pull up to the club with a porsche four door
Pull up to the club with a porsche four door
Skinny Skinny nigga with a whole lot of whores

[Verse 1]
Fly nigga my swag might lift off
And my dick is in love with her lip gloss
You kiss that bitch I laugh at you
Swag less, I might throw swag at you
Damn, I'm back to the cursing
And I look better in person
I'm a hustler like a Mexican
And my flow so sick I need medicine
Too many sponsors
I don't have to buy clothes
She the shit, always keep fly hoes
More kush, more liquor
Trying to fuck her and her sister
Yeah, do it big like I'm huge
Slap her on the ass yeah I'm rude
I smoke that kush I'm so high
Finish my verse, so bye bye

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Look ice on my neck got your girlfriend froze
When she saw me she chose
You lost, I won want to trip then I might get my gun, run
You kiss that bitch I laugh at you
Swag less, I might throw swag at you
Walk in the club I'm too high
Walk out the mall I'm too fly
Your bitch call me papi chulo
And I'm probably on Pluto
Smoking on that uh oh
I'm the shit no culo
She love me like I'm Santa, red bandana
Blue chucks on, so crispy, skinny nigga with a thick bitch with me</pre>
