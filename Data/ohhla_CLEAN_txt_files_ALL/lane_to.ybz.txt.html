Ok, you knowimsayin, this Sean Paul like you knowimsayin, I'ma tell it
like it is right quick you know,  a lot of niggaz drink Cristal
Dat's cool and everything you knowimsayin I ain't got it like
That I'm fucked up a lil bit you knowimsayin I still drink
Hennessey and Colt 45 you already know

[Verse 1]
I ball, all day 'til the money gone
Hit the trap with that and get it back on
Big body Cadillac frame with the chrome
I'm Gettin a lil mo' sucka make punk niggaz run home
I'm mashin, phone steady on roam
Still ride dirty hand placed on my chrome
Cuz I'm nervous, I'm get my Cadillac swervin'
I damn near hit buddy in that suburban
I'm selfish, and I ain't 'posed to be drivin
I'm DUI and got bro right beside me
Still mashin, no gives a damn about crashin
I'm geeked up I took a blunt up out the stash
Still rollin, no tags cuz it's stolen
I'm fucked up, out of parly and control
Slow motion, outta gas and just coastin
I'm dead drunk, fuck ............ (switchin lane to lane)

[Chorus]
Watch out I'm drivin, destination unknown but your boy still ridin'
dirty I'm wildin, grippin the grain switchin lane to lane
Watch out I'm drivin, destination unknown but your boy still ridin'
dirty I'm wildin, ain't nothing changed switchin lane to lane

[Verse 2]
I'm wild, SS 'til my gas gone
Hit da club like dat and get back home
Got a couple freaks on their way on the phone
Talking bout they ready to burp and get it on
So I'm scrollin, doin' 50 just chokin'
On 85 with my nigga straight smokin'
Bout woozy, so they ain't no excuse me
Disrespectin' get yo ass in the movies
That's gangsta, I break you down to ya ankles
Jump pussy nigga watch me make you famous
You was laughin', Shoulda known you was actin'
From how you came out yo mouth bout the attic
That's tragic still sittin' in traffic
In the left lane looking for some action
What's happenin, ain't nothing what's crackin'
Nothing but these hoes lookin' for some stabbin'(Switchin Lane To Lane)

[Chorus]
Watch out I'm drivin, destination unknown but your boy still ridin'
dirty I'm wildin, grippin the grain switchin lane to lane
Watch out I'm drivin, destination unknown but your boy still ridin'
dirty I'm wildin, ain't nothing changed switchin lane to lane

[Verse 3]
I'm ridin dirty, and see these hoes that disturb me
Fuck niggaz poppin' shit ain't never worth it
That's crucial, toned out is what I'm used to
In the back of the 'lac where hoes choosin'
We foolish, getting crunk off the music
On Billy D that's just how we do it
Slidin, wit my niggaz right behind me
In the streets on the go is where ya find me
Po-Po on my tail, gotta stay coo
Buckle up I'm ridin with a car full of fools
Blunts up, man I don't wanna make a move
Bad news, I done swerved on them 2
I'm scuttlin', little button I'm ridin ugly
I'm full of smoke, just finished smoking a dubby
Trippin, can't get caught out here slippin'
If they want me they gonna have to come get me (Switchin Lane To Lane)

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Watch out I'm drivin, destination unknown but your boy still ridin'
dirty I'm wildin, grippin the grain switchin lane to lane
Watch out I'm drivin, destination unknown but your boy still ridin'
dirty I'm wildin, ain't nothing changed switchin lane to lane</pre>
