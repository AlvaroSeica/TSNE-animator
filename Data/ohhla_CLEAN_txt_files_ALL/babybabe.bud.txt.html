[Intro: Grime]
To be all that high energy..
Yeah... the haters and instigators
Grime, nigga... brother is...
For them haters and instigators
For the Brooklyn, this is for them haters and instigators
Yeah... yeah... yeah

[Chorus 2X: Queen "Sail Away Sweet Sister" sample]
Hey, little babe, you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
It ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

[Grime]
I thought, keeping it real was taking care of your fam
For the peeps out the hood, and not living the lam
His whole life's a scam, when the heat surrounds me
The same people that be the snakes is all rounds me
The what ups, the hoopla, puffin' the la's
Giving 'em five, saying slick shit on the side
See, if I got that, what's this
And if I got, this, what's that
I can't get 'em off my back
You got money, you're hated in the hood
And if you got nothing, then the nigga no good
So what the fuck is I'm living for?
To make a little cheddar or choose to stay poor
But I, I get mines whether envied or not
And those who feel Grime, is you with me or not?
I don't give a fuck, I'mma still deal me a knot
So it don't make a difference, if you give me my props, uh

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Grime]
You see niggas want to hate and talk about me
But they don't go clubbing unless they getting in free
And I don't give a fuck what whip you choose
It can't be all of that, if you copped it used
And a nigga know, he never walk the show room floors
And it took about a year to fix the dent in your door
So what, I ain't got no ride, but the Grime will thrive
And that's all I need to get by
No matter what I'm blessed with, I'm still the same nigga
That you used to smoke weed on the steps with
Hustle in the lobby cuz we getting the cash quick
And run from police when they rush in the exits
Same muthafucka used to play ball with you
And everytime you need me, go to war with you
But that's my word, kid, you forgot
That while you was playing toys in flip flops, nigga

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Grime]
Yo, I make sense and not fingerprints in precents
But this peephole snitch next door is straight bitch
But those who talk alot, they wound up being broke alot
Broke alot, all broken up in the lot
I stop fucking with them haters and instigators
Now I'm rolling with big dogs and flippin' papers
Meetings in skyscrapers, eating in five star places
Miami, at the door places
Those need niggas, cuz them niggas need me
And I'mma bring it to ya'll niggas, if need be
See Grime get money, but they hair peezy
I stay clean cut with the hands, greasy
And I ain't gon' let the next nigga lead me
Cuz the next nigga for sure, ain't gon' free me
See I get the cheddar, you get cheesy
You don't want no problems, nigga, leave me

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]</pre>
