[Chorus: French Montana]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' - HAAAH~!
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' - HAAAH~!
Ridin' round with that work (HAAAH) strapped up with that Nina 
Got two bad bitches with me (ay ay) molly and Aquafina (ay ay ay)
Money don't mean nothin', niggas don't feel you when they see you (ay ay ay)
My whole hood love me (WHOOP) but naan nigga wanna touch me - HAAAH~!
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' - HAAAH~!
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' - HAAAH~!

[French Montana]
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin') ridin' 'round through East Tremont (Tremont)
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin') ridin' 'round with that Nina (that Nina)
Ridin' 'round with that AK (HAH) that HK, that SK
That beam on the scope (scope) window down, blowin' smoke (smoke)
Niggas frontin be broke (broke) try rob me, gon' get smoked (BAP BAP BAP BAP)
That gun automatic (HAH) my car automatic (HAH)

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Money don't mean nothin' (nada) bitches don't mean nothin' (nada)
Come here with your hand out, nigga I don't owe you nothin' (nada)
I'm ridin' round with that work (work) Max lost trial; I'm hurt (hurt)
I'll ride through Mott Haven (HAH) I'll ride through Castle Hill (HAH)
You know that Coupe half a million, fuck how niggas feel (HAH)
Cause I ain't really worried 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin') my niggas ain't worried 'bout nothin' ('bout 'nothin')

[Chorus]

[Outro: French Montana]
MONTANA!

See you niggas shakin' in yo motherfuckin' boots
The Untouchable Empire, Dream Team - HAH~!
(HAAAH~!) I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' - HAAANH~!
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'; nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin' - HAAANH~! {*echoes*}</pre>
