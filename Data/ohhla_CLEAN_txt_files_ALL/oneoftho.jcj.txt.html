[Intro/Interlude: The Weeknd]
Hey.. I'mma visit the sky today
Hey.. I'mma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[The Weeknd]
I'm tryna sink in some gin - I need, I need, I need, I need, I need
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hatin' on me, on me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then
Then I'm doing something right; and if their mamas know my name
And if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right; and if their girlfriends know my name
Just cause she loves me, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band
{*I love the guitars*} And I already know
I've seen her at my show banging out XO all day
And her friend's a freak (yeah)
She can't feel her throat (no), she can't feel her knees (ohh)
And I'm not tryna talk (no)
And I'm not tryna walk - just lift me out the club (lift me out the club)

[Chorus: The Weeknd] + (Juicy J)
One of those, it's gonna be one of those, nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those, nights
(Weed blowin', champagne poppin)
('Pagne poppin', champagne poppin') One of those, nights
(Got that, drink flowin', champagne poppin')
('Pagne poppin', champagne poppin') One of those, nights

[Juicy J]
Uh, yeah.. {*I love the guitars*}
Pounds of weed, Sour D - that medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl for bout a week, shootin a shower scene
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker (yeah), rollin' blunts in my flying saucer (yeah)
Juicy J - the new skywalker, Ill put your ho in a body auction (ho)
When Im having fun, Im still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay ridin' through the city with my twelve gauge (gauge), hatin' ass niggas, get it any day (day)
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mill, Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil (damn)
Keep snow bunnies that like poppin' pills, keep a double cup, I like cracking seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong, bought the loud pack now I'm in my zone (in my zone)
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut (Tut), got my codeine cups, bout to drink up (up)
If you're talking about money, we can link up (up), bad red boned bitch, body inked up (up)
Your girlfriend coming home with me and when she alone with me
She gonna suck dick and she don't spit or I'mma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi (bi)
Cause their pussy is the best and their head fire (yeah ho!)

[Chorus]

{*I love the guitars*}

[Interlude]

[Outro: Juicy J] + (The Weeknd)
Got that, weed blowin', champagne poppin'
'Pagne poppin', champagne poppin' (one of those, nights)
Got that, drink flowin', champagne poppin'
'Pagne poppin', champagne poppin' (one of those, nights)</pre>
