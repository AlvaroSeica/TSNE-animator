[Slaine]
I've been caught up in the darkness of my anger and my hatred
I close my eyes and see myself hangin in the basement
Danglin my legs, veins strainin in my head
Blood drainin in the tub, drownin in it {*glub glub*}
I been down in it: the mud - I mean down in it: the dirt
I mean really down in it, lost and found in it bezerk
I've been burned by the fire, scorched by the flames
of my own sins and desires so I call them by their names
when they come~! Greed, Gluttony, Sloth, Envy and Lust
They're all enemies, but they act so friendly with us
They roll with, two other guys we call Wrath and Pride
Now I'm half as high as I am low..
I can laugh and cry at the same time but I can't slow
down, feelin manicky, panicky, full of anarchy
Can it be so simple to get rid of them with Ritalin?
I'm tryin to get into Heaven cuttin out the middle man

[Chorus: Slaine]
Every time I drift away I see myself dead and buried in the cemetery
Accidentally starin at the sun
Shinin through the filthy glass windows
Broken bottles in the bedsheets dangle bloody naked with a gun
I'm livin in this tiny-ass room with the mattress on the floor
and an ashtray, look what I've become
Light up a half-sniped cigarette and take my last swig of liquor
Smoke the filter down down till it's done - but I ain't done

[Slaine]
I'm cold-blooded, stuck with the spirit of Hell frozen
Here's a hole inside my soul, my fear and my self-loathin
Got me hallucinatin that all my walls are closin in (closin in)
I think I'm losin my grip - there it goes again!
These demons live inside of me they talk to me and lie to me
Whisper homicidally, I'm tryin to get 'em out of me
But I can see this side of me, it's just becomin clearer
I'm startin to hate the sight of me, I break the fuckin mirror
Please Jesus just just just listen to my prayer if you can please
I'm believin that these distances I've gone too far to leave
I'm breathin in the sickness this addiction and disease
This mess I'm in, this vicious is my missus and my mistresses
I'm twisted and ballistic, I'm addicted to this world
Forgive me for the pain that I've inflicted on my girl
And my son, I was stuck holdin his bottle and a gun
And I couldn't get away where I was from
