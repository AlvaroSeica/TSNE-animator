[Verse 1]
(Jaylib)
"Yo man you here dat you here dat shit man"
(Madlib)
Like what the fuck is this
Hey look at this what kinda luck is this
(Haack) Uh Madlib and Dilla is the illest my niggaz
Only haters holler they can't feel us
Wanna get looser then we?
But just gonna be a looser to me and Dilla (ha)
Killa, Talkin bout how you kill cops, you softer then a pillow
Backslapin' ya neck while you covered in rep?
cause you bluffin and you aint said nothin to spec?
Anyway I'm straight high off the trees
Your girl don't wanna lie she's gonna get on a niggaz dick
Turn it up, y'all niggaz must be outta ya head
If your system ain't up to the red

[Verse 2]
(Jay Dee)
"Yo what was that you said right there what was that?"
(Madlib)
Mr. Leadway, instant replay, instant relay
Instant MC, producer, and DJ
I do this shit without a cell beeper or 3-way
Your coming off like like a G-lay?
"Anyway" Ay, Peace to A.G.
Peace to Pete Rock, Diamond D, peace to Sage
Oh that nigga Wildlight, Wildlife, Hannibal, Cannibals
"WHOOOP What else?"
Um, male fascists, womanizers, mymphos, niggaz in disguises
"Ah what else" Fine women that like pretty women
Some fuck women some fuck woman?
"Mostly Fuckin Women"
Y'all niggaz must be outta ya head
If your system ain't up to the red</pre>
