(Intro)
Uh, uh, stop. Stop, don't...
Don't ever do that... No...
Because, I know if I let you it's gon' be all around town
And I just don't have my business sounding like that
You know what, you don't know how to keep no secret
I mean when this song is gon' be out, people are gonna know my sh's the bomb
And I'm not worried about that. Uh, uh, no, stop
Don't, don't, stop, stop. Aight, you gon' get yourself in some trouble
Alright let's do it...

(Verse 1)
Damn, this a trip I know he wanted to get at me
Jumped into my hoopdie wanna feel something ???
Knockin' for a head of this bump...
Flava I give it to him now if he don't tell later
Patience baby, don't rush, it's been too long and I just can't give it up
It's vigin material,  gotta watch what I'm doin'
I can't hand it to everyone just because they rulin'
But I let you cause I sweat you and your style is unique
You just don't have your business all in the street
So people, slide it in and press play
Let me take you for a ride around my way, okay

(Chorus - Teena Marie)
All you do is push it in, then you push it out
That's the dance we call the push
If you got it let me hear you shout  (x2)
...Push out, and, push out, and, push out, and push out, and in
Go 'head, go 'head let your body work
Go 'head let your body jerk

(Verse 2)
Hot of the wax, wait till you hit the back
The B-Side is the bomb, word to Mom...
Check the material, juicy like cereal
'95 flava, a year later...
You know it's poppin and ain't no stoppin' my beat
The techniques you use are those of a freak
Sit back and observe, right next to the kerb
Gettin' it on, Daddy got nerve...
You know I let cause I sweat you and your style is unique
You just don't have your business all in the street
So people, slide it in and press play
Let me take you for a ride around my way, okay

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Be honest with me when it's done
Don't be callin' me Mommy if I ain't number one
Aight son, what you think, tell me if this shit stinks
So let you here before we hit the streets
Do I... have enough funk in my trunk
To make a fella do right or make a fella do wrong
Was it better from the back on every track
I won't be offended if you say this shit is wack
See, you know I let you cause I sweat you and your style is unique
You just don't have your business all in the street
So people, slide it in and press play
Let me take for a ride around my way, okay
