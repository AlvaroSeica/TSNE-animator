Boy Wonder (Boi1Da)

Drizzy

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy gucci, I buy prada
I spend dolla after dolla (x2)

[Drake]
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
my flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants
I still fly, you can't float
run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke
chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat
I cant see you through a Mosley Tribes
so I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
they try to measure up but there is no one my size
whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes
beast mode on em, I never take a night off
every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off
baby go ahead and cut the light off

[Chorus]

[Kevin Cossom]
I'm the rookie of the year (year)
about to get my dough on
I'm  about to take off, baby you should hold on
but I aint about to prolong
I'm ma keep it short and tell you whats about to go on
bottle after bottle cos the money like so long
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
baby... we about to put a show on
Imma show off, like I'm supposed to
yeah you can get lost, I don't know you

[Drake]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I aint picking up an' entertaining them at all
got your girl face down banging on the wall
while you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
hmm, hmm, hmmm
I cannot relate
riding with some tags that I got from outta state
riding with a swag that I got from outta space
just show me who's the hottest imma knock em outta place
call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego
I'm  about my green puffing guddi like I'm Cee-Lo
you can go and take a glance at your hero
while a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
fantasy to you, reality to me
and my g-pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree
waving at your girl while she smiling back at me

[Chorus]

[Kevin Cossom]
Louie too
yeah, Alexander McQueen
Im so clean
Its KC and Drizzy
and its the remix remix
