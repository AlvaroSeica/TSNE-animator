[Chris Rock - Intro]
2010, that's right, we in the future
Atlanta, Georgia
MILLIONS of albums sold, MILLIONS of moneys rolled
I see why +Everybody Hates Chris+ - YA LIGHT-SKINNED BIATCH!!

(SING ALONG WITH MEEEEEE...) {Cannon...}

[Chorus]
Say, "FUCK you, Luda!" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, "FUCK you, Luda!" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, "FUCK you, Luda!" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Yeah, I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+
Say, "FUCK you, Luda!" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, "FUCK you, Luda!" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, "FUCK you, Luda!" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Yeah, I guess that's why +Everybody Hates 'Cris+

[Ludacris - Verse 1ne]
Hey! Okay now, this is for the Gs' and this is for the hustlers
This is for the diamonds and the WATCH all clustered
spread 'em like mustard (yep!), canary yellow
Now women in my face like "HELLO?" (Waddup?)
Yea, I'm sort of a big deal (deal)
These Giovanni rims are sort of a big wheel (wheel)
This five course dinner is sort of a big meal (meal)
This Bentley GT can make Luda disappear 
faster than David COPPERFIELD, mutha-FUCKA!
...Hahaha
I'm talkin five star tellys, and Penthouse Suites
Yea, I'm just a +Playboy+ between +Penthouse+ sheets (okay!)
Hit the club and go and party with some Penthouse freaks (say what?)
Party with Britney, Lindsay and Paris together 
Get in line and buyin bottles that's taller than Chris Webber
And makin haters sneeze from diamonds and sick leathers
'cause my ice gives 'em cold as if they under the weather (cool!)
but my women keep me warmer than a POLO sweater - they better
(I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)

[Chorus]

[Ludacris - Verse 2wo]
Hey, now I stay fresh to death draped in gangsta fits (okay)
Over twelve million sold, I drop gangsta hits (yes sir!)
Live in mansions and drive around in gangsta whips
You would swear I'm 'bout to get into some gangsta shit
Oh no! Here comes trouble, my vision is skewed
I can only see in doubles, two models, two bottles 
that'll pop like bubbles, and when I get home      {Two...one...zero..}
the girls' tops lift off like air space shuttles   {Liftoff (*rocket flies*)}
(And I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)
It's sixty seconds 'til BLAST off!
My car got a face lift and took its mask off
Tint so dark it look like I took the glass off
The body was white for eight weeks
befo' I finally decided to take its cast off (whoo!)
Now it's blacker than a bottomless pit
You talk shit you'll end up, wit bottomless lip (BLAOW!)
I hit a nigga so hard, I'll make him swallow his spit (BLAOW!)
Then I be wit Bobby V. on that +Anonymous+ shit - ya hear me?
(And I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)

[Chorus]

[Ludacris - Verse 3hree]
Hey... (Let's go!) 
I go for BROKE like TLC
The hottest nigga on the mic - yeah, I believe that's me (Me, bay-bay!)
Now all the ladies wanna give a lil' T.L.C. (C'mon, girl)
'cause Luda was set for LIFE after three LPs' (Ching!) - Yep!
Still countin, still climbin the charts
and rappers still talkin shit like they was rhymin in farts (Waddup?)
I cross the finish line twice, they still tryin to start (Nope!)
But my infrared beam will make 'em shine in the dark (BLAOW!)
(And I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+)

[Chorus]

[Chris Rock - Outro]
I never did like this motherfucker..
The only rapper that, goes to the airport without a gun in his bag {*audience laughs*}
WHAT THE FUCK?? You tryin to stay outta jail?
How DARE you?! {*audience laughs*}
He got six albums, what you tryin to fill up an iPod, nigga?! {*audience laughs*}
Ludacris, onstage at the Oscars
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!!
That nigga onstage at the Oscars
I don't like it, I don't like it one motherfuckin bit
Taking parts, from good actors {*audience laughs*}
This motherfucker can't act
Ah, "Hustle &amp; Flow" - NIGGA, YOU +PLAYED+ YOURSELF!
{*audience cracks up and applauds*}
Nigga...How DARE you?!
{*appluads continues 'til the end of the song*}</pre>
