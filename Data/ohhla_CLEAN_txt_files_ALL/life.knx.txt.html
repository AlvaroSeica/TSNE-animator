[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
It's always about money, It's always about money because...
That's just the way life goes, everybody wants to appear to be rich
Ain't nobody tryin to appear to be broke, you know
'Cause at the apperance of money, you know it's the deception
That everybody wants to put out there
That's the way they live their life

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
It's the life that we live, it's not by the rules
The lessons that we learn is not by school
Any boy, that wants to be man before his time
Is out his god damn mind, fiendin for the life
Full of pain full of strife, full of guns, full of knife
Full of good when your a nigga's girl, full of shit when you his wife
Full of dope fiend's dopin, full of crack fiend's smokin
Full of niggas who think the cops ain't watchin
Jokin full of Jesse Jackson hopin, we can be free
Full of niggas in the jailhouse that look like me
Full of pimps full of players, full of thugs full of macks
Full of hardcore rappers with a car full of gats
Full of fake ass niggas that rap
That will get exposed when they run into a real live scrap
Full of little green paper, with dead people on 'em
Got the graveyard full of flowers, with dead people on 'em
Full of them that don't like me 'til I figure how to stack around taxes
Full of loved ones that ain't comin back
Full of snitches full of rats, check the stats
We losin real bad in this game that we call the life

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (Bumpy Knuckles)
L-L-L-Livin on the line-"Inspectah Deck"
(The Life!) E-Everything your hands could touch
(The Life!) Let-L-L-L-Let's all be professional-"C.L. Smooth"
(The Life!) You-You-You gotta respect the game

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
I sit and listen to the preachers talk about fair play
And that nigga knows the game don't play that way
This life is full of niggas that can't buy a tank full of glass
And sleep behind the buildin that's a bank full of cash
Temptation, they got sunshine
While niggas feel Bill Withers, "Ain't No Sunshine"
The life, for the niggas that got the funniest jokes
And the biggest diamond rings and the longest mink coats
And the best lookin houses, and they put 'em on cribs
And show the god damn feds where the fuck they live
Full of niggas with too many kids, they can't feed!
Full of niggas who went to college, and still can't read
Full of fake friends smilin in your face
Plottin on a safe, full of money while they keep it full of grace
Full of poorly runned government, that stole this land from the red man
Now we celebrate thanksgiving
Friends taken, fuck 40 acres and a mule
Gimme 40 million and I'm cool, then it's back to the motherland
Not to live but to buy diamonds, flawless
Shinin, not this fake shit that niggas wear rhymin
It's life full of niggas climbin, from the bottom to the top
Full of niggas fallin back to the bottom
Urbanized culture got 'em, check the stats
We losin real bad in this game that we call the life

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (Bumpy Knuckles)
Live-Live-Live-Live-Livin on the line-"Inspectah Deck"
(The Life!) E-Everything your hands could touch
(The Life!) Let's-Let's-Let's-Let's all be professional-"C.L. Smooth"
(The Life!) You-You-You gotta respect the game

[Verse Three: Bumpy Knuckles]
The life! Struggle for survival, watch the game
That's why I'm glad pop left me this, glock to aim
Watch yourself now you can be reckless
And feel your whole body get snatched like, Marbury's necklace
I know we on the government check list
And soon they be droppin all the bombs and all our lives will be Flex less
This life is full of fake saints that won't start prayin
'Til they see this big room full weak nuns payin
What's the message I'm relayin?! It's all in your head
He say givin it to God, we say givin it to rev
This life is full of people who wouldn't give a fuck if I was dead
'Cause it means that they could come out from under they bed
Why they scared?! Life is full of dudes like me
Niggas rude like me, takin food like me
Full of jazz, full of soul, full of new, full of old
ASCAP full of publishin that people that done stole
Full of life love, but people won't share it
It's responsibility, and people won't bare it
It's the hardcore truth, but people can't wear it
That's why they all lose in this game that we call the life

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (Bumpy Knuckles)
L-L-L-Livin on the line-"Inspectah Deck"
(The Life!) E-Everything your hands could touch
(The Life!) Let's-Let's-Let's-Let's-Let's all be professional-"C.L. Smooth"
(The Life!) You gotta respec-respec-respect the game
