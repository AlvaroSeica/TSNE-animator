Typed by: AZ Lyrics

PCP! Meth, mad anti-depression pills
Everything spills into one pot
on top of that I smoke rock
I hear that shit but I wont stop
Last time on the spot, choked a cop
Stopped and had a Faygo soda pop
In the back of my trunk, Chuck the chainsaw
Usually chop wood, but that ain't all
It's a bit strange, all up in your mid range
Cut a hole in your head til I hit brains
Left a cop in a pile while maybe
It's the night of the chainsaw baby!!!!

Cut em up Chuck, Somebody!!!
Cut em up Chuck, get bloody!!!
Cut em up Chuck, go nutty!!!
Cut em up Chuck, Cut em up Chuck, Cut em up!!!

No you can't calm me down, you can't calm me down
you can't calm me down, you can't calm me..

Petroleum, Inhale it and take a swig
Eat my brains up, make my wig
Killin time with no shirt homie!
I love it when the blood squirt on me
Walked up to a house jabbed the door, and kicked it in my victim hid!
Stuck Chuck in the closet, and I could tell by the deposit, I got my target!
French poodle, stomped it limp noodle, revved Chuck up and stir the stroodle
Guts on the lawn, fucks goin on?
Chainsaw Chuck til the break of dawn

Cut em up Chuck, Somebody!!!
Cut em up Chuck, get bloody!!!
Cut em up Chuck, go nutty!!!
Cut em up Chuck, Cut em up Chuck, Cut em up!!!

No you can't calm me down, you can't calm me down
you can't calm me down, you can't calm me..

Bloody feet, no shoes into a party
I wasn't invited, but that bitch ignited
I screamed and laughed, choppin fools in half
I stab and hack, a mad lumberjack
Smell that fueeeel, Hear the machine
Chucks a demon, I must be dreamin
Bloody showers, feel the power
We devour you fuckin cowards
A loony loose, Chuck full of juice
Beggins no use, I knows no truce
It's your noose, bout to see your own produce
Night of the chainsaw, written by Joe Bruuuuuuuccccceeeeeeee!!!

Cut em up Chuck, Somebody!!!
Cut em up Chuck, get bloody!!!
Cut em up Chuck, go nutty!!!
Cut em up Chuck, Cut em up Chuck, Cut em up!!!

No you can't calm me down, you can't calm me down
you can't calm me down, you can't calm me...</pre>
