They thought it was cool to burn crosses in your front lawn
As they hung you from trees in your backyard
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded - KATRINA
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom
and open fire - Virginia Tech and Columbine; Stop the Violence
They thought it was cool to tear down the projects
and put up million-dollar condos - gentrification
They think it's cool to stand on the block, hiding product in their socks
Making quick dime bags dollars
They think it's cool to ride down on you in blue and white and unmarked cars 
busting you upside yo' head...
Freeze - 'cause the problem is we think it's cool too
Check your ingredients, before you overdose, on The Cool...
