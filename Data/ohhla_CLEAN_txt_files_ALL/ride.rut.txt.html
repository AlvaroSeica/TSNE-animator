[Intro: Apocalipps]
Ruthless Bastardz, Staten Island's best kept secret
Let's go yall, What the fuck, Yo

[Apocalipps]
Ayo these niggas wanna test my flows, They wanna step in my clothes
They wanna feel the blows, Fuck it let's go
I gotta clip and you can have it all
I'll cut your nuts off and give em back to you then tell you to have a ball
{Even though what we do is wrong}
And you could think what you want about Lips
For real partner, Got so many niggas pushin up flowers, Think I'ma gardener
A nice guys, But it's always vics that push me
I'm like aids, Cause all I kill is dicks and pussies
And real niggas do real things
So that means, If my crack stops sellin, I'ma split me a melon
And if these niggas stop tellin, It'll be a less felon
(Now you know that shit I'm smellin, Keep flowin Lips)
{Even though what we do is wrong}
Yo, In my hood I'm the throw back king
Not cuase my jerseys, Because I throw that thing
Leave your ass with a toe-tac string
And my iron don't plug in, The difference you should know that sceam
Ruthless, You should know that team
Introduce you to me inferred, You don't wanna know that beam
And I never liked exams, So I'm not gone test you
But when they find your body, They gone know Lips blessed you
{Even though what we do is wrong}
Yo, Yall niggas got some audacity
Yall made some records, But yall after me
What the fuck, Get em Truck

[Truck]
Hold that nigga, Start the ignition
I'm about to straight ride on these mark ass bitches
My gun jam I'ma put my knife to work
Poke your ass, And see how nice it work
Spit my razor out, And straight plat it on your face
Guerilla niggas, Straight Planet of the Apes
{Even though what we do is wrong}
Kick the door down, Take the money out your safes
Straight gangsta, Smack your honey in the face
Post it up in Bowling Green, Not good for a sceam
And I'm good for a jukes, So I'll be changin rings
I'm on some shit this year, I got a new mission
I got a new check, Spit you out like New Addition
Stay the fuck out my lane, Don't you know who Truck is
You want me to run your ass over with these 18 wheels
{Even though what we do is wrong}
It be back in the four building, Head in the olster
Flippin on these red neck, With the guns in the holster
Like soon as this butts cut off, And they take these cuffs off
I'ma fuck around a shut the Ruck off
I was born in 73, Like the great wars of Attica, Shit happened in 73
Whose willin with me, Who smokes raps inside swifties
Slap the woman up, And then go to the box with me
{Even though what we do is wrong}
Collapsed lung, Wanted dead, Death row
And if yall niggas comin with me, Then let's go
My niggas roll like the orange crush, Fuck you up
Bats, Guns, And knives, Or we can knuckle up
Hit you with a body shot, Make you buckle up
You might crash in the V, You better buckle up, Muthafuckas
{Even though what we do is wrong}
{Even though what we do is wrong}</pre>
