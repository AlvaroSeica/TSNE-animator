Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Real rap real shit this is not no drill shit
Only speak what I live bitch, white sean goin' kill shit
I was out in that field bitch, bout to come up real quick
I don't fuck with no fake niggas only niggas I eat meals with
My bitch nina I chill with, real niggas goin' feel this
I don't hang with a lot of niggas cause that hating shit
I can't deal with, while you was wasting yo time, I was out on my grind
Every pennie nickel and dime, I put everything on the line
I be painting pictures for the blind
Just talk about my life and make all that shit rhyme
Young nigga I'm winning and I came from behind
Step up to that thrown
Yeah I'm here to claim whats mine, nigga Ima count to 5 ha

I got money all on my mind, bitches all on my line
I got shit I wanna buy, I can't give a bitch my time
To the top I climb
Made a couple mistakes I wish I could press rewind
Smoking on that loud
Just to clear my mind, I be putting in work
I be putting in time
Bibby I'm that nigga all these labels wanna sign
They wanna see me fall, they don't wanna see me shine
They bitch know I'm a star, so she give me top while I drive
I call it giving me mind, thick bitch she threw it back
I call that shit rewind, young nigga got one mission
Ima get this money Ima fuck bitches
Liddo niggas guna talk down but they know they really can't fuck with us</pre>
