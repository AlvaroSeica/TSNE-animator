[Cappadonna]
Yeah, '96 Park Hill style
Burial ground sound, in it forever dunn
Politic

Here we come, right through your eardrum Dunn
Cherry-head catch, feel the draft of the ox
You catch one, trying to pretend you gonna win
Headlock, show the block kid counterattack
Dunn of mine stay connect, 4th Disciple trife
Ain't nuthin ice cream, kid you get blown like steam
Park Hill Projects, the black Idi Amin
Ninety-six era, not the crossover lever
Chain swinger talk swing, probably wardrobe king
So what now? Industry kids'll lock it down
Only too loyal, dustin and then they're there for you
You wanted to enter 36 in the soil
My technique is speak, have you knocked out weak
Forever in it, my slang dick goes so deep
Thirsty for hip-hop, Staten Isle' niggaz can't stop
Runnin wild like a child til we reach the top
Stapleton, New Brighton, and West Brighton the harbor
Connect, me for vet, Don King and a tech
Thug cats'll get done up on black man's sun up
Cap the imperial, bring out new material
You hold me down, analyze all cherry-head
Wu is in town, catch the hand-off
Prepare for my dancehall standoff
Mercy when I come blow your mic hand off, sorry I touched him
Here they come again through customs
Mad ways to dead the wax, one way to bust him

Chorus:
If it's alright with you, it's alright with me
We can take this rap game to a higher degree
We can do this Spike Lee or how you want it to be
Check it, Golden Arms plus new Cappadon'

[U-God]
These 99 powerful circlin swords
Impact from all the heat dug deep and locked on
Chip off the bone, hard face and hard fists
Chop off your option, have you felt a neck twist
Cassette disc and wrist, meltdown your pistol mist
Burnt to a crisp, bombaded my pistol grip
Tongue gripped the nigga, raw tone the jawbone
Leaning tower Pisa sounds off the Mars zone
Chef dropped that bomb, the takeout will still linger
Twenty crazy christians, to lock in hole and heat up
Who the finger rap singer with hip layers of phlegm
Caused by blunt smoke, heart disease plays the friend
I ran out emotion, my rap style's devotion
I got hosts for you Soviet peoples across the ocean
My path releases, volcanic ashes
Engage in the page activity is autographics
Fraction of my bustin microphones start to lust and
Words plays over power practice might bust em
The black male persuasion known to hunt you for Satan
The Big Apple verbal concert was the occasion
The vital snap, now insert my spinal tap
I got forty more swipes to pipe, thirty slapped
The power from the cram broke the bottom of the pan
With Earth Wind &amp; Fire, ice water dead grams
American hustler up and comin with a vengeance
Makes no magnet charge, plug vivid my extension
One lesson motivation for my pistol profestation
Slang person nailed now we move on a motation
Location, point-blank, on point be the vessel
Politic the defecit measure, point the decible
We're credible, renaissance, eatin off the barrel
Advanced chemo, die hard to my demo

Chorus
