[Intro: Rico Love]
Yeah, turn the lights on {Maybach Music}
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on {Maybach Music}
Turn the lights on...
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em

[Meek Mill]
Maybach...
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
I crushed them hoes, I never love them hoes and these niggas be sweatin' 'em
Cause I run shit like Edgerrin or better yet, like Rev and them
And on the bottom of my sneaks they red, man and I ain't talkin' 'bout no damn Meth and them
Stay Louboutin and I super grind, VS stones, they super shine
I pop the Perc, I get super high and I drill your bitch, root canal
I rock Tom Ford, Concords and I shine on these dime whores
This bitch done bought me a Rolex and I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be acting up, these niggas be acting tough
I'm in the Phantom, I'm backin' up and I'm bust down, but I'm strapped as fuck
So hold your horses, Polo horses, Aston Martin, we roll in Royces
Real niggas up in the building; then hoes choose us, ain't no more choices

[Chorus: Rico Love]
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em
These niggas be lettin' 'em, these niggas be lettin' 'em
These niggas be lettin' 'em, and me I don't be sweatin' 'em
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be actin' up
These hoes be actin' up, and these niggas be lettin' 'em

[Wale]
Whatcha here fo'? Haha
Work.. work, young
Run 'em out then, haha
Double M-G, forever though
Hold up...

These hoes be actin' up, see me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth, gold bottles in the back of us
These Jones be broke as fuck, too uptight, they won't open up
She got her arms folded even on the phone: I'm like, "what the fuck is she here fo?"
These hoes be actin' up, these niggas keep wifin' up
Please homie, got me crackin' up, never spent one more than a night with her
These hoes be a fucking joke, they'll never say a nigga didn't warn you though
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning and I be like, "hah, told you so"

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Wale, Rosay, MONTANA~!
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma +Coke Boy+ {*2X*}

These hoes be actin' up, big bread we rackin' up (huh)
Straight to the bank, cee-lo (huh), cancel that bitch like Nino (huh)
Ratchet ass ho, don't play with me, want to Kobe me, want to Humphrey me
Want to Michael me, Russell me, take me to the bank and Tiger me (ay, ay, ay, ay, whoo)
Now these hoes be actin' up (huh), these clothes ten stacks and up (huh)
These cars 100 racks and up (huh), these drums 100 rounds and up (huh)
Bitch, blow me, like a, trumpet, twenty, thousand, all in, hundreds
Fuck it, money, money, money, money, money, money, AH!

[Chorus]</pre>
