Each weekday seems the same to me these days
These alarm beeps rage wake from a deep state
Of sleep, ache cuz I see day feel deep hate
T pleads begs for escape from my bleak fate
I'm still in a deep dream state half-asleep haze
Can't keep pace legs weak thinking is delayed
But I need to be on that three train or I be late
Then laid off when T need to be paid
Got responsibilities so even this weak wage
Is needed it Keeps my place's heat ablaze and my lease paid
Not conceited greed plays no part in T's ways
My female and me feed and see that our seed's raised
We may one day seek our space flee this crazed
Race speed pace peace waits in some freeing place
work is fine but I still feel it keeps me caged
in steel to be free I need to create when beats break
with speech lay in clean slates my dreamscapes
deep, keep faith that T will see a release date</pre>
