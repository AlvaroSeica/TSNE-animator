[Klashnekoff]
K k lash ya rasclat neck off
I'll split you in half like a gun blast from Lennox
Hotter then flammable rocks
From the manor when man are animal yammin you like fox
Experts slosh we specialize in handlin' kop
With man's hatchin' and plannin' plots lookin' to jam in ya spot
But their stamina's not up to par get ripped apart like red rizzla tarars, rasclat
This Terra Firm dargart state of the art
But tell them jankrows to stay in they yard
Or get stabbed with a stake to the heart
I'm tryna walk a straight path but you dun say it's hard
Sick thoughts are flingin' on mask
N killin' ya clark
Keep runnin' thru the back of my head like old dance steps
Get dropped on ya doorstep like dando
Many men ran prang cuz my nine flows better than Taliban still ban shows
Spit flows over bhangra spit so cold make you shok out like it was soka
Terra Firm take over take you thru the mind state of a tortured soldier
Who tells tales of unspeakable horror with lyrics lethal like bora
Leave you leakin' on the floor star
That's y I don't watch no talk
I read auras and books written by forbidden government authors
Infiltrate ya borders like ITN reporters
Then return with the slaughter
Captured on camcorder I'm trapped in a damn corner chattin' to Pandora
Bout boxin' a man for her
But she don't no Klashnekoff
That black cunt from out of stokey
Banana boat mango munchin' monkey kick off ya door like jumanji
Dash you off the 28th floor like it was bungee, I want the blood cleaned

[Klashnekoff]
I'm not ready to die but ever ready for bury a guy
They're not ready for I
I can see the fear in they eye
Scared of the rhymes that ricochet and tear them inside
N fear for they lives
Prepare and try to stare in they eyes
Wife cry bucket of tears
When the brare get iced but that's life
Its all lies write rhythms like a dive spit cyanide saliv'
N blind they left eye
Subliminal crime snipe you in the back of ya mind
With killer quotes and one lines that cuts throats like knives
Baffle da vibes come fathom how the fuck did he die
With tux and a tie with 21 bucks to the sky
Askin' me y a brethren is deeper then I
This piece by my side lookin' to eat a piece of the pie
So come in peace or draw for ya piece or please reach for the sky
My ether is 9 like 9 millimetres times 9 millimetres times 9 millimetres from ya spine
So take time my rhymes take life like tek 9's
And we take y from guys who flex their chest size

[Klashnekoff]
Batter the spanner banner with a black bandana
Darren d the dan dappa wrap the trees like strappa
Stab the beat with a dagger the hackney hack attacker
shabby like shabba shabba like shaggy verse oshuka
In the six sick cities situation get butters
Man switch like burukas
Come swingin' like McGuigan with a barrage of punches
The spit boxin' champion who spark man unconscious
And knock out they dentures
See the drugs don't work they jus make you worst
Man smoke a little merch and feel say he cant get hurt that absurd
He get sliced and served like hors d'oeuvres
Bury six feet deep like sword in the dirt
Where you frauds shot work from the back of ya mercs
I reverse the hearse stick 'em in the back of the boot
And baffle you fools you cunts cant ackle this yoot
Or tackle my cru get beaten till ya blacker then blue
While I'm strappin' a zoot you on the floor catchin' a boot
Lookin' to catch a bag blood but that's a catch 22
And you done know da crew</pre>
