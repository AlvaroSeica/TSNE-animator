Aint to many mother fuckas bad as us

Do u plan on givin me some?
If you wont I wont fight
you never know maybe your girlfriend might
freak me down before I leave
pass the blunt, hit the weed
you can bounce if you too fly
gotta watch out cant get to high
fuck these hoes, gotta get G's
Benjamins, gotta get keys
sexually, gotta get pleased
sex aint free, gotta pay fees
niggaz can chill, aint no stress
