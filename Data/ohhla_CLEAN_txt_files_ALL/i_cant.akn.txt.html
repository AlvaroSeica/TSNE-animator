{"I think we..."}
{"I think we..."}

[Akon]
I think of you
When the morning comes and the nighttime goes away (all day)
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay (no way)
There is nothin stoppin me from lovin youuuuu
Touchin and rubbin and kissin and huggin you
What's this feelin taking over me?
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me

[Chorus: Akon]
{"I think we"} Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just youuuuu, and meeeee
{"I think we"} Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just youuuuu, and meeeee
{"I think we"}

[Akon]
I can't believe
That someone like you will love me endlessly (forever)
If this goes our way my love will always be (eternally)
You have set my mind, my love, my heart so freeeeee
Together forever however just you and me
What's this feelin taking over me
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
Cause that's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you're in love with me

[Chorus]

[Akon]
To have you right next to me here by my side {"I think we"}
To kiss and caress you girl while I'm holdin you tight {"I think we"}
Can't imagine life without you, it just ain't right {"I think we"}
I got a whole lot of lovin, and you gon' get it tonight

[Chorus]

{"I think we..."}
{"I think we..."}
{"I think we..."}</pre>
