I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxin at Happy Camper
The fuckin financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxin
I'm taxing, "Fuck 'em all!" I'm chanting
Don't complain I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best
I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in "Liar, Liar"
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott
+Cable Guy+ like +Larry+, Peter Pan in my youth
Fuck you +Fairies+, I'm using my +Tooth+ bait
to give that bitch teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis, black Nazis don't copy
We perfect, you sloppy, hotter than Saki Takei
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Hang with thrashers and jackers, drug dealers and crackers
AP students and slackers
I'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93
Escaping from concentration camps with a fuckin girl, board and a ramp
that I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White, red-headed bitch, reminded me of Annie
She dyno like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That's for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
Wasted fuckin youth? All you old niggaz antiques
We go skate, rape sluts, and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tina Landry, watching Billy and Mandy
Motherfuckers wanna be +Odd+ but you can't be
Sit the fuck down all you old niggaz stand me
Faggot

I guess I got to be a fuckin hand-me-down rapper
from Los Angee' area anytime I'm fuckin landin
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight, shout out to Hype Track
them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fuckin song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip-hop bloggers to start feelin me
Because I'm 17, compose my own beats, lyrically
I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fuckin skinny jeans
and follow in your footsteps like a motherfuckin millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and cigga-weed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfuckin little league
No I ain't no fucking hipster, mister
No I'm not no fucking Kid CuDi, all my fuckin fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming FUCK BUDDIES~!
Yo, yo

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fuckin drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't +Walk It Out+, DJ Unk
My nose is filled with coke, and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished
I'm managed, hop off my dick and make a fuckin sandwich
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
Fuck you... faggot (fucking bastard)

[Outro]
Ha ha ha! Yeah, umm
As you can probably tell from listening to this record
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period
But um, I didn't mean to offend anyone
Alright, I'm lying!
