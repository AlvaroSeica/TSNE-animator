[Verse One] [Bambino]
We got the flows on deck and got the tracks on deck
Ayo the hoes on deck, a fat sacks on deck
A pack of beers on deck, you know the gears on deck
The Level is like a frat we knock boots and then step
Into the A.M.
Still to the P.M.
Thought that you could play them and really you can't see them

[Stenge]
Well can I wreck this?
Get rich and flex a Lexus
Check this rhyme from a couple of west kids
For some strange reason when I'm splifted 
I'm gifted
And I got the flows to keep the hoes on my shit

[Ced Twice]
And I straight shift into fifth then back into fourth
I once drank a fifth but I hurled on the porch
Still I skeeeez
From here to Tel Le Viv
Tell the fees
+Don't Stimulate+ these

[Bambino]
Even in school you know I pulled straight tens
(Pretty Butt is what they called him)
All them cheerleaders callin' my name I had two
Mary Jane and Mary Lou
So I smoke one and then I poke one
Oh what the heck, we got so many hoes on deck

[Chorus]
We got the flows on deck and got the tracks on deck
Ayo the hoes on deck, a fat sacks on deck
Ummmm, thanks for the jockers, I gotta get my propers
It's on deck, it's on deck, it's on deck

[Verse Two] [Stenge]
I got faaaaame
But I'm not Dana Dane
So much on deck, oh heck, but who's to blame?
I blame it on the flows cause they grows like a tree
You can't see me with a telescope
I'm hella dope

[Bambino]
Well I'm back on deck and extra strength like Advil
If a hoe don't give me time then my tag will
It's no biggie
Honey come over, take a swiggy, then I diggy
We can get blowed like Ziggy's
Father, don't bother me after I bust one
Never get done son cause I never trust one

[Ced Twice]
Plus one
That makes two
But that won't do cause there's five in the crew
Ayo, I think I hear a cho cho
(Yo I hear it)
(Yeah, me too)
Taaaaag me, now I'm in
Grab your ticket and your twig and let me begin
She rode the night train
We gang banged the booty
Just a few hooties
Now we makin' movies
We filmed a flick called "Freak Me, Freak Me"
She said, "Don't break it.
Take it easy."

[Chorus] [x2]
We got the flows on deck and got the tracks on deck
Ayo the hoes on deck, a fat sacks on deck
Ummmm, thanks for the jockers, I gotta get my propers
It's on deck, it's on deck, it's on deck

[Verse Three] [Stenge]
I'm on deck like a pirate
Cause I rip
The mic with the Lev
I write more rhymes than was in Charlotte's Web
Rip down all the freestyles also
I slam like that kid from Charlotte, I'm all pro
Although
Y'all know I'm the sporty shorty on deck
I shoot the gift, I'm on next

[Bambino]
Well excuse me, suckers don't run, you can't loose me
A little more than flows to make the hoes choose me
The retros, the hoochies, the groupies, the floozies
The newbies, the shoobie doobie whop, the jock and won't stop
Check what I said
Fuck what they said
I'm feelin' Guinness Stouty, rowdy, outty I'm wasted

[Ced Twice]
I'm the most flow havingest 
I know you're glad that it's
On deck
I mic check
A whole check
I cash checks
I eat Chex
What's next?
Flex
Time to have sex
Roll a phat Lex
Drink a quart of Becks
And I still hit my ex
From the coast that's the best
Call it the west
Don't second quess
I'm buddah blessed
Confess
I open eyes like Zest
Forget the rest
I'm the best
Your high-ness
And it's all on deck

[Outro]
Yeah it's all on deck! Fo' the nine fo' season. Yeah! It's all on deck
For the nine fo', know what I'm sayin'? Buckle up
Echo rippin' up shit. Yeah, Lawhouse Production. 
Lawhouse. D's in the house. Law's in the house</pre>
