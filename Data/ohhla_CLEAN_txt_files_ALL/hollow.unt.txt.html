[Intro: 50 Cent]
50! Believe me it's easy! We number one effortlessly!
Ha ha! This is the Unit!!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me, movin
I'll put a hollow through him (Hollow through him)
I'll leave your body, oozin
I don't know who confused him (Who confused him?!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
From PR to DR, niggas know who we are
They know how we do it it's the motherfuckin Unit
Push the rock move the yayo stack paper like Leggos
Rap tornado yeah we fuck with Tego
He don't even speak spanish he a fraud
Joe really don't want drama he a broad see that cannon oh lord
That nigga get to talkin to God
Like father forgive me for my sins and forgive me for my friends
If you give me one more chance I will not do this again
Why 50 never lose man he always wins
It's cause the block love us, you, cocksucker
I, got your number, this could be your last summer

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me, movin
I'll put a hollow through him (Hollow through him)
I'll leave your body, oozin
I don't know who confused him (Who confused him?!)

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Passport's stamped up, money mesmerizin
Tropic horizon, juicy socailizin
Oochie girl conivin but Gucci girl poppin
Chloe bag, Chloe boots down to the stockings (Ohhh-OHHHHH!!!)
I catch extras, wit extra toppings
Hunnid E-X, 50 dropped the top in
Ain't no stoppin, G-Unit poppin
Audi R8, jake cannot stop him (Break it down now!!)
Joe ain't poppin, Khaled ain't poppin
Fans see them and they not stoppin (NAW!!)
Fans see me when I'm hurr mate shoppin
Gucci shoppin, tags is poppin

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me, movin
I'll put a hollow through him (Hollow through him)
I'll leave your body, oozin
I don't know who confused him (Who confused him?!)

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! You could take your white flag and stick it, I'm different
Which means a nigga diss me we can't kick it
Matter of fact a nigga diss me he diss himself
I'm papa, I'll whoop these niggas, pick a belt
A clown won't bump heads with me, Hulk Hogan bold
I'll crush you, like bugs on a open road
Another sixteen bars another overload
It's hot out, and none of my shoes are open toes
You see alot of bling on stage, probably mine
I got four rings on me, like the Audi sign
I take the elevator down make the lobby shine
A nigga try to take what's mine nigga shotty time

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me, movin
I'll put a hollow through him (Hollow through him)
I'll leave your body, oozin
I don't know who confused him (Who confused him?!)

[Outro: 50 Cent]
That nigga's a rat son, you heard that nigga he's like, the truth will come out
Donnie Brasco ass nigga man!
You know who the fuck he is man, he gonna be like yo Macho!
They got us come out from behind the car, come on they got us!
Niggas sweet man, the fuck is these niggas from!
They make the Bronx look bad!!!!</pre>
