[Andy Cooper]
In the place to be, since 1993
We are the record makers
and the record breakers (UD)
And we came here to help you do one thing
(What's that, what's that, what's that, what's that) 
You got to let it out!
AHHHH!!

Here we go!
Trapped in the house, I'm about to burst
Getting fat by the TV, that's the worst
So desperately I'm yelling rescue me
Cause I'm running out of gas like an SUV
And everybody's saying "You're not getting any younger"
But I can't settle down, I've still got the hunger
To get involved cause "You know I got soul"
Pick up the phone, call everybody I know
Don't care where we go or what we do
Could be lots of folks or just a few
But I'm tired of waiting, enough debating
So stop delaying, I'm suffocating and

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
I wanna, I gotta
I need to let it out
You wanna, you gotta
Come on, let it out
We feel it, you feel it
We better let it out
We gotta get it out
Come on and let it out
AHHHHH!! Let it out
AHHHHH!! Let it out
AHHHHH!! Come on, let it out
AHHHHH!!
Einstein, yeah, like that, alright!

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
It's the last day of the week
and I'm watching the clock tick
I'm dying, left in the cold and frostbit (Uh-huh)
Close up shop, turn the monitor off
Heat it up so hot the thermometer pops (What)
Time to let loose (Yup), drop the excuse (Uh-huh)
Stop complaining and cut the noose (Okay)
Take the reigns (Yup), break the chains (Yeah)
Time to blow off all the aches and pains (Uh-huh)
Go ape, beat on your chest like a primate
From southern California all the way to the tri-state
Take a trip, I'm the aviator
Letting off steam like your radiator

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
I wanna, I gotta
I need to let it out
You wanna, you gotta
Come on, let it out
We feel it, you feel it
Let it out
We better get it out
We gotta let it out
AHHHHH!! Let it out
AHHHHH!! Everybody, let it out
AHHHHH!! Let it out
AHHHHH!!
Einstein, let it out!
Yeah! Uh-huh
Make it funky, man
("Breaking these chains, I could never come back!" 
Yeah, let it out! AHHHHHH!!

[Andy Cooper]
Yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, hey!
Yeah, keep moving!
I hope you feel better, y'all
Ahh, I do
Let's get on outta here
Let it out...</pre>
