Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Only thing I wanna do is come around and lay with you tonight
I don't wanna waste no time, the mood is right
I just wanna come over and lay with you tonight
I'mma do this on my mind

It's when I lay my body
Next to yours, you got me
Addicted to your love
Boy, you got me

Addicted, addicted
I'm your addiction, addiction
You're my heroine and cocaine
I know you're not good for me
But I don't wanna go away

All day, I just been thinking about you all day
I don't even wanna think about your delay
Cause you was running through my mind anyway
And I just wanna lay my body next to your sweet body
Addicted to your love, boy, you got me

It's when I lay my body
Next to yours, you got me
Addicted to your love
Boy, you got me

Addicted, addicted
I'm your addiction, addiction
You're my heroine and cocaine
I know you're not good for me
But I don't wanna go away

[French Montana]
What'up Cassie, baby, when I land I'm gonna hop it
Addicted like that cocaine they'd be folding in that dollar
That Special K, that heroine, got two watches and my ay chains
Got phone crays about two place, that space ship like Bruce Wayne
That sir I'mma talk, see that pimp on my wall
I be the prince in my city and you know we run New York
From that corner block to that big house
Under bottles stand on to couch
Now on the bottoms when I read about
Can't be with you, can't be without you
Damn, this shit cray', we're getting wacked
Holding up money ground up, shit gonna change, I don't blow up
But shawty kept that hundred next to me
But dollar signs is all that I can see

Addicted, addicted
Addicted, addicted
Addicted, addicted
Addicted, addicted</pre>
