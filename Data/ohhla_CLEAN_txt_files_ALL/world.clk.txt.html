When I said it once (When I said it once)
I said it all (I said it all)
Watch (Watch) Pray (Pray)
And live Holy (And live Holy)
Amen (Amen) [* Applause *]

BASE ROCKS NIGGA!!!

[Hook: E-40]
I remember when the world went crazy back in 1985
I remember when rock cocaine used to be rich man kind of high
Till one day in my neighborhood motherfuckers started havin' fetti
They was hangin' on the corner yellin' "BASE ROCKS NIGGA!"
Bumpin' Too Short "Blowjob Betty"

[E-40]
Eleven, fifteen, sixty-seven nigga learn about it
A nine pound breach baby, future Al Capone
Hit the cradle with a big ass naple, young beginner
I tend to be well, country club cross child care center
First grade elementary, mama Vista walkin' the home trail
Bobby leavin' after school, snotty nose
Fist fightin' in the battlefield
Thumps, bought some matches books
Live down the street from coochie dippin' drive
With the girls and guys
I prepared for the worse
Moms and pops divorced
Time to switch the scene
Smob to magazine
Government grilled cheese single-parent inner-city shit
Only way to get your's
Is to get out there and pull some sort of illegal shit
Way before the distribution of the coca plant
Niggas was pushin' grass
Residue from the hip, concentrated hash
My folks from the hood helped raise me
Can you remember when the world went crazy

[Hook]

[E-40]
Now it's 1984
And I haven't quite made my way up to a unit yet
My sinister game was boomin
But I haven't quite made my way up to a unit yet
Standin' in front of my next door neighbor's house
I made my own set, money was comin' to me
Turf fired up, base rock boomer
Only nigga in the town besides cokin' sidin' in the Cougar
LL had the bumble and so did Bobby Jenkins
Everybody in Viejo yo ass was on grimmies
Smash through Foley Park with tremendo
Claimin' hella fame and the dope fiend window
To a nickel and dime ass nigga
To a top hat ballin' big rigga, BITCH!

[Hook]

[E-40]
Livin' it up to the fullest
Never thinkin' about givin' it up
Maybe it will maybe it won't be foolish
To get out of dodge and drove to Grambling College
Me and that nigga B-Legit
On some ol' D-Shot I'm home sick
Ripped back on tron, garglin' rocks and rhymes
From turf to turf, when it goes from worse to worst
Ain't no fuckin' mirst gotta go for what it's worth
Young Ive with Yap and cousin Cavio
On the two-four twist like this
Suga, E-40, D-Shot, Legit
Who never had no ideal that we would become The Click
Shot the game to the left, got it up to par
Now that's how the fuck you become a rap star

[Hook x2]

[E-40 talking]
C-L-I-C-K in this motherfucker
It's 40 out on a solo shot
Smab, smab, smab [* Sniffs *] [* Burps *]
Swirvin' BITCH!

[Repeated till end]
BASE ROCKS...BASE ROCKS NIGGA!!!</pre>
