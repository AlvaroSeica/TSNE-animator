[19 second skit about a drug addict headed to jail]

[Opio]
Say what?
Listen baby brother, don't let 'em take your 'etti from ya
Keep a razor your under your sleeve, don't be afraid to cut 'em
And you can always count on me
I'll be your foundation in this foul nation (every day)
I'm out chasin money and dreams
Funny it seems, funny it seems I'm wastin time
But just be patient, I got the ace in the hole/whole
life of the entertainer out to her centerfold
It gets distracting, caught up in the interaction
of feminine attraction, they get the backspin
and flare when I break 'em, beware don't mistake 'em
for a square or a fake when the air starts to get thin
I put my gas mask on, poison can permeate
Private eyes blasting, scream with the 38
Clashin with Branch Davidians in the dirty state
Raelians, make full blown clones, it takes 30 days

[Chorus]
Tryin to escape, you wanna fly away
Feelin like you gotta stay high everyday
But it's always consequences and a price to pay
Keep focused, don't throw your life away
You wanna fly away... try to escape today...
But there's a price to pay... don't throw your life away

[Opio]
That's the type of shit that make my uncle see a early grave
Standin at the pearly gates, beggin for mercy but wait
It's all cyclical, so watch what you do
Recognize game, you'll reach heaven, but it's pivotal (that)
you let your mind gleam like a white tennis shoe
Money might interest you, but it shouldn't be intrical (nah man)
Keep your physical in balance with your spiritual
Indivisible, it's nearest you, so listen dude
Edwardian theories you can throw 'em out the window too
Thinkin 'bout fuckin your moms? They was trippin
Divisive, destroyin the bond, I'm not with it I'm cool
The trick-knowledge in school, they kickin to you
You know +American Beauty+, the movie
where dude pops for some booty? Stay aware
Cause they tryin to do you see, sick as Hitler and Musi
Young George W, put your neck in the noose G

[Chorus]

[Opio]
So called hard times they facin ain't shit
Complainin, yet complacent, a double agent
What an understatement, wait shit, correction
They falsifyin information, the main objection
Keep your head on a swivel, stay invisible
And watchful, for nocturnal beings that stalk you
With binocu-lars, and telescopic lens that see to Mars
Every day they follow your car
Catch you droppin your drawers
like a girl who say she'll swallow it all
And she's a model that's tall
Make your toes curl up like a nautilus shell
White powder up your nostril, damn it feels swell
Then your house turns hostile, like Amityville
Anxiety takes over, you reach for the pill
You didn't try to be that angry, but Danny got killed
And now you in jail (motherfucker)

*jail door slams*

[Opio slowed down]
You wanna fly away... try to escape today...
But there's a price to pay... don't throw your life away

*laughter and voices to fade*</pre>
