[Intro]
{*cough*} Yeah
It's what we do everyday...

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
We popping bottles of the pink shit, take 'em to the dome
We ain't ever on that weak shit, all we blow is strong
Every day we party til early in the morn
Put that shit on Instagram so they know I'm putting on
I know you see me... (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I be puttin' on... (I be puttin' on, there's no way that you wouldn't know)
I know you see me... (Stop and pose for the picture)
Yeah, I be puttin' on...

[Wale]
Yeah, Double M, Genius to be exact...
I know you see me with your looking ass, what the fuck you looking at?
This is MMG and we don't speak to all you fucking crabs
Got a bunch of cash, but money is under, fam
I'd rather be over-prepared than slip in here understaffed
Did you understand I'm down to ride with my niggas
Just a double M, you can't fuck with them unless you're certified to ride with us
Keep the broads far up out my business and my mind following the ditches
And I ain't tripping off of potential -- that's another word for "ain't did shit"
Haha, work, and I put D.C. on
we ain't been this high since the E.R
See y'all niggas be some peons, talking about y'all be gone
Whole time niggas wouldn't swing, playing tee-ball

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
I know you see exactly what the fuck a nigga like me doin'
{*laughing*} Uhh.. it's hard not to see that shit man
Clear the motherfuckin' smoke, it's loud enough
Uh, haha...

Hundred thousands, hundred thousands, I be throwing hundred thousands
I know why they trusting me -- cause I got all these funds around 'em
My fan base consist of niggas with drugs around 'em
Educated sisters to bitches dancing with ones around 'em
I know you think all we do is have fun around here
But I'm from a city where young niggas carry guns
Don't single out any corner -- its popping on every one
They talking bout what they gon do, its probably already done
I'm running through cake, running through states
Take your one to the face every one or two cakes
Just bought a new crib, that's a wonderful space
Ask me how I feel I got it so my nigga

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Whattup Wiz? Roscoe whattup?
Rosay, whattup big bro? HAAAAH~!
I know you see me...
Ha-haaaaaa...
I know you see me.. haaah
Puttin' on, Putin' on, puttin' on
Ay, ay, ay...

I be cooler than a motherfucker, wanna hit the fans
Selling work on the Internet -- call it Instagram
And you know I do it for my city, you know I'm putting on
Hundred racks on this clothes a nigga putting on
Self made, self paid, forty on my belt waist
Hundred round lobster feast, get a shell face
I be twisted off of molly doe, chopped bricks karate doe
Closet two floors -- safari doe
Brown bag paper tag, nigga can't pay for swag
We know we love the game but we hate to brag, Montana
Me and Rozay twisted on a boat
Watching all you fuck niggas choke, Coke Boy

[Chorus]</pre>
