[Frost]
(Verse 1)
Q-vo
Aqui estoy, MC Kid Frost
Yo soy jefe, maton, yes, the big boss
My cuete's loaded
It's full of balas
I put it in your face and you won't say nada
Vatos, cholos, you call us what you will
You say we are assassins, determined out to kill
It's in my blood to be an Aztec warrior
Go to any extreme and hold no barriers
Chicano
And I'm brown and proud
Want this chingazo, simon, I say, "Let's get down"
Right now
In the dirt
What's the matter, you afraid you gonna get hurt?
I'm with my homeboys, my ties, my camaradas 
Kickin' back
Con mi ganga y pa mi, no digen nada
Yo soy chingon, ese
Like Al Capone, ese 
Control a todo, so don't ever try to sweat me
Some of you won't know what's happening, que pasa
It's not for you anyway
Cause this is for the raza

[Frost]
This is for the raza
Raza (Raza...)
This is for the raza

(Verse 2)
The forms that I'm speaking is known as calo
Y sabes que, loco
Yo soy un malo
Tu no sabes nada, your brain is halo
Been hit in the head, too many times with the palo
Still, you tryin' to act cool
But you should know
You're so cool that I'm a call you a culo
You're just a pee wee, you can't get it and ever
You are a leva
Your own barrio doesn't back you up
They just look at your ass
And call you a poo butt
And so I look and I laugh, and say "Que pasa?"
Mmm-hmm
Yeah
This is for the raza (Raza...)

[Frost]
Raza...

(Verse 3)
Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo 
No one to go with me, so I had to go solo
And when I go out alone
I pack
I touch all the chavalas when they know that I'm strapped
Every time that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick
All the nonsense must cease
Just like the song, when you're Eighteen With A Bullet 
Got my finger on a trigger
I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand, I know some mafiosos's
Quick to pull out cuetes on some stupid ass baboso
Sittin' there, wonderin' what's happening, que pasa
Yeah
This is for the raza

[Frost]
This is for the raza
This is for the raza
Raza (Raza...)</pre>
