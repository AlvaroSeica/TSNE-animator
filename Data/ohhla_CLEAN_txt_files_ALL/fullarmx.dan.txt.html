[Verse 1]
Can't get no rest from this mess
I don't know how I put up with it
It sucks to get lied to, that's why
I don't trust a muh'fucka
Shit, I'll cut a muh'fucka off
Tryin' to run some game on me, see
This one cat tried to ask for my CD
To get it reviewed, I said "true, what more you need from me?"
He said "your beats homie, throw me a freebie"
So I said "fuck it"
Passed him heat
Weeks passed, nothing published

[Danny!]
And I felt like a shithead
'Cause I told everybody to check out
The magazine review and shit
It's cool, I'ma leave it alone though

[Verse 2]
Well I, after hatin' I forgave him; it was hard
Then I got a call from a major label A&amp;R
He said to send a demo
But my dreams flew out the window
When I peeped a Trap Squad mixtape with my instrumentals
Damn, I'm sick of niggas shittin' me
I'm fixin' to be the cynical-est nigga alive, I
Picked up the phone, gathered all my loose pennies
Hired lawyers for the case, I have a lawsuit pending, c'mon

[Danny!]
I'm kinda glad I paid that $45
To copyright my shit too
Word up
I'm sick and tired y'all
Fuckin' with these liars y'all

[Chorus]
Games people play
Why, why, why you're just not matchin'
What they should do
Me me me me too
Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spendin' all day
Thinkin' just of you

[Verse 3]
1,245 hits a day
On my website, e'rynight
Damn, I love the e-mails
Damn, I love the females that hit me up
Some are weird
And some are ex-girlfriends I ain't heard from in years, yeah
This chick was like "I bought your album, Danny
I love your puns and metaphors
You're headed for the Grammys!
Boy, you the best...
Umm, P.S.
can I get $2,000 from your royalty check?"
Fuckouttahere

[Danny!]
You know where YOU can go
You and your kids
It's kinda hopeless man, I'ma call it a day
They pull the wool quick
Miss me with that bullshit, uh

[Chorus]</pre>
