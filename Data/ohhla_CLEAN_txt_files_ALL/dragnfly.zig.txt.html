Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride that never stops

Hey mister bee the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you'll survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey miss dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am I

A dog looked at me and said ziggy why can't we trust man
Puss and me get together why can't you all just understand
An old tree stood there silently listening to every word we said
As a tear fell he cried what type of creature is man

I said hey mister tree the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey miss butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what kind of creature am I
You must be wondering what kind of creature am I

Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride yes we're on a ride we're on a ride that never stops

Hey mister bee the world change but you remain the same
And I hope you'll survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey miss butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am I
You must be wondering what type of creature is man</pre>
