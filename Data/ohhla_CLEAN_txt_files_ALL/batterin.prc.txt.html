[Sean Price]
Ha ha, yeah, P!
What you say nigga? Get the fuck outta here
Listen, P!
It go - beast mode, I live by the street code
I beat foes the fuck up when the heat blows (heat blows)
Don't talk crazy on cell phones (nah)
Workers get ten off a buck like hell no
Hell yeah! I am that dude
with balls, sell drugs, rapper with an attitude
Punch niggaz through pizza shop windows
Red devil dust mixed with a little indo
Sean P, call me Kimbo
On drugs paranoid, who's lookin through my window?
... My nerves bad
English class failure, nigga my words bad
You herbs had your chance, it's my time
Serial killer theme music is my rhyme
In my prime, I'm a primate
Ape nigga with the ape vision that's why I'm...
The fuck outta here

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yeah - battering bars, pa what's the matter with y'all?
Simian twins, me and my friend shatter your squad

[Pumpkinhead]
This is that trunk pop music, make you pull the ratchet out
Blood fire heat you up, then pull a casket out
I'm who you should ask about
I'll body any rapper, and get my paper back like Random House
Put your Henny up, and burn them trees down
+Butcher+ laid the +Beat+ down, I'm like a beast now
You should not speak now, zip your lips God
Matter fact, log on to SHHHH-Zip-It.com
My watch flood, shirt Lo, kicks Nike Air
You'll never catch me in tight gear with spiked hair
Ten stand at issue, the pimp hand'll hit you
so hard it'll feel like a camel kicked you
I get ends and set trends
Roll with smokers that keep +Bud+ on the side, like Rudy's best friend
Niggaz talk crazy, like they just popped an ox
Come at me and Sean P like that, you get popped an ox

[Chorus]</pre>
