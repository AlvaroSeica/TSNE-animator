[Intro: Nicki Minaj] + (Brinx) + {Busta}
I got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin awayyyy
So keep on gettin your paper...
(F'real ye ain't never had to tell me get this bread)
(*"HOLIDAY SEASON!"*) {Busta Bus} Nicki Minaj
(Billions baby) Frank Bill-ion (C.I.T.)
(*"This is a world premier"*) (Let's get it)

[Brinx]
Now behold it's your excellence, C.I.T.C.
I'm oh-fourward slash president, Eastside resident
It's oh so evident! Brinx Billy ride cousin
Black on black Phantom, 26's on the side of 'em
Ninas on the side of 'em, Goonies on the side of 'em
Anybody get it boy, be careful on the side of 'em
These niggaz'll bury you, guns no fear of you
Money hungry honey with me holla she gon' carry you
Flyer than a aerial, there I go, jet-to
Sittin on my feet when I'm stuntin on them people
I tell no fables, e'rything tailored
Fax machine, OfficeMax, see me for that paper
You workin with short bread, ain't my money long youngin
Bitch I'm 'bout trappin more digits than a phone number
Different time zones on 'em, kill these niggaz lyrically
Left side of my closet look invaded by italy
Right side Paris, left side flaggin
Oaper is is my main chick me, and money married
(PAPER~!) And that's all a nigga know bitch
That's why these brand new niggaz is on my old shit
(*"HOLIDAY SEASON!!"*)

[Nicki Minaj]
Guess what I did I came out of the truck?
In the lane like I just... I chunk my deuces like...
That's all I do like... Young Money
Nicki Minaj, is the ninja
Harajuku Barbie all that like y'knahmean?
Like yeah that's what we doin gettin money like y'knahmean?
You writin disses we gettin money!
Yeahhhhhh boyyyyyyyyy!
(*"Trapaholics mixtape"*)

Get me my limousine, all in your magazine
And when I come them better lean like Promethazine
Dem no say Nicki nice, I'm 'bout my money momma
And tell Michelle I got my eye on Barack Obama
Tryin to get that Madonna, you know Hannah Montana
Could find me sittin indian style with the Dalai Lama
Konichiwa I get my yin then I say sayonara
I'm meditating I'm in cahoots with a higher power
Mind on my money mind-mind-mind on my money yeah
Mind on my money mind-mind - Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Mind on my money ay, mind on my money babe
How does this money taste, wine and gold money's face
You see the signs and the teachings
If you ain't know well this is grinding season
Now and go get your gangs signs, throw it up
Where all my niggaz on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't goin away
My niggaz bring the heat, and it's not a summer day
So mind on my motherfuckin money
My mind on my motherfuckin money
Ohhhh

[Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo I speak foreign languages and shit
But the language I speak best is that money language
Hahahah~!! Flipmode bitch!
Brinx I like how we doin a Brinks truck job on these niggaz homey
Time after time again I love to tell niggaz
and remind niggaz, how I hold out on motherfuckers

Niggaz out here frontin 'bout they bread they can't trust a nigga
My money so stupid call me Warren Buffett Busta nigga
Gladiator toss, see everything about me butters
Countin money so long that I'm seein dollar signs in different colors
My money'll smear and smother yo' money, you hear me brother?
Been about that bread like I was broke and I'm still in the gutter
And in case you ain't knowin there will be no replacement
of the bags of that "Arab Money" I got stashed in the basement
Face it; whenever I shine I glisten, whenever I talk you listen
Ain't no money gettin made in these street without my permission
I keeps it drug infested, my money is well connected
It's to the point where my +Conglomerate+ is well +Respected+
You need to check my method; I promise you I'll be the wrong nigga
when it comes to my money that you ever want to mess with
Grind like missionary labor, holdin dignitary paper
You ain't know? My team is filled with consiglieres
We major! I don't give a fuck about your stipulations
Type of bread appropriate for E'RY situation!
You can tell from the jewelry that's sittin on my collar
From the bread to the crib niggaz KNOW I'm all about the dollars

You know I ain't into all of this long talkin shit
Shit is confusin me when I'm countin paper, hahaha
Brinx! Busta Bus bitch!
You know I only wanna inspire y'all to get it like how we get it
You know it's a recession out here, we all need to get it
So when we walk around we ain't gotta look like foolish niggaz</pre>
