All nite long, we'll be on fire babe
All nite long

(Verse 1)
I'm on my way to pick my lady up
And I'll be rolling out tonight
I've got my glass full of brew
Of course my outfits tight
Got to get my swerve on
Lookin smellin real good
Gettin money feels good
Paying niggas, still hood
Smoking trees and jettin down the west side highway
Sound system rocks, it's nine o'clock friday
Snow is coming down
And you know that I don't care
I'm about to see my lady
I'm on my way, Yeah

(Chorus)
Hanging with my lady
Riding and we rolling
And we acting crazy
So you know I'm horny (?)
All Nite Long
We'll be on fire babe, We'll be on fire

(Verse 2)
She told me to give her a while
Cause she was jumping in the bath
I told her to take her time babe, I'll be there in a half
Can't wait to be alone, me and my lady
All that talking on the phone is driving me crazy
It's been a minute now I'm riding on the G dub
Don't know where we go but we got to hit the speed law (?)
Roses in the passenger seat with a card too
a pair of earings, theres just certain things I've gotta do

(Chorus)

I put the key in the door
Walk to the room
Before I could reach
I smelled the perfume
Those candles is lit
The Music is on
Yeah that's my shit, baby I'm home
Now I get to see her cause I've been thinking about her ass
She came up out that bathroom
Man I tell you, out of sight
Immediately hugging and we kissing
Doing this and that, this is the shit that I've been missing

(Chorus)

(Chorus repeats with voice over)
Hanging with my lady
I'm kissing with
I'm rolling with
I'm touching with</pre>
