[skit]
[Danger] Lemme talk to you baby
[Ms Krazie] Wassup Mijo?
[Danger] I just miss you ma, ya know?
[Ms Krazie] You knew what this was about..
¿Qué No?
[Danger] Yeah...
[Ms Krazie] So why you getting so attached now?
[Danger] Cause I love you.
[Ms Krazie] Was it something that I did?..
Lemme Know...

[Chorus]
Got him thinkin' I love him but there's just one problem
I'm teasin' and he's expecting I'll call him
But I just wanna know are you serious baby?
Damn right cause you must be crazy to think someone
Like me would just calm on down and still want you around me boy
I just used you and no longer
Need you so stop telling people this babydoll's with you

[Verse 1]
It was just one time that I made you mine
and we been through this {one time} I told you from
The Get-go and I thought baby you knew this I can't be with you
like you want me to be {hell nah} you're
A nice guy and all but with you that makes three
I'm not the one for you Yo no puedo ser de ti {nunca} we can
Never be living happily just you and me {nah}
you're lying to yourself go with someone else see when
I recognized that what I did was wrong you wish this was a happy song
but now you're on your own wishing
I would get back with you
You lost me once before and that time it was your choice.
You say you want me back and you been missing my voice
{well well well} Qué tu quieres que te diga
You're a little
Too late I already found another man who was more than happy came and took me by the hand.
I don't know why I made you think it meant something to me
Payback's a bitch it's my turn now you'll see.
Cause I was only teasing for a little moment {sin razon}
When I make you feel what I felt for you and why you broke
Mi corazon {how does it feel?}

[Chorus]
Got him thinkin' I love him but there's just one problem
I'm teasin' and he's expecting I'll call him
But I just wanna know are you serious baby?
Damn right cause you must be crazy to think someone
Like me would just calm on down and still want you around me boy
I just used you and no longer
Need you so stop telling people this babydoll's with you

[Verse 2: Danger]
You caught me cheating but I told you that it wasn't me
{nah} You left to a party mija now you know
About my jealousy
I don't want no other vatos in your face wanting you to say the time and the place
Mija I could still taste the love spell
Lotion fucking you in slow motion is what I miss most and
I regret that I said that I want you but I don't need you that doesn't feel true
Girl I wanna
Feel you I wanted to reveal the love that I had for you
I ain't mad at chu but your attitude holds
Me back from what I have for you
I wanna cry and laugh with you
Change the number in my pad for
You
Find the bitch that helped you catch me cheatin'
I'm a slap for you just something that I have to
Do
I wish these bitches would mind their fucking business
Gotta G like me thinking damn what the fuck
Is this? But on the real babydoll papi loves you
place no one above you Damn I wanna fuck you

[Chorus]
Got him thinkin' I love him but there's just one problem
I'm teasin' and he's expecting I'll call him
But I just wanna know are you serious baby?
Damn right cause you must be crazy to think someone
Like me would just calm on down and still want you around me boy
I just used you and no longer
Need you so stop telling people this babydoll's with you

[Verse 3]
Everything I needed from you I already got so I can't complain
{I got it all} I've taken almost
Everything and now you're feelin' stupid ese what a shame
How does it feel when somebody messes
With your mind, used to say you loved me all the time {siempre}
You used to call yourself a mack now
I got you wrapped around my finger feeling bad
How sad that I treat you like like this {oh well} wanting
Me so little now you wanna fuck this
why'd you change your mind did you get a sign or did you see me looking
Fine? {Danger} Are you serious? Are you teasin'?
Mija can't you see that I'm feenin'? That I used to be the
Type of vato that will beg no fucking Bitch on this planet
Damn it! I took you for-granted and now I can't
Stand that you're not on the side of me
took all the life from me now you wanna hide from me
Don't ever wanna see you with another I couldn't take it
you packing rubbers gets me furious picturing you
With someone else I best stop this drinking cause I need some help
I miss you.

[Chorus x2]
Got him thinkin' I love him but there's just one problem
I'm teasin' and he's expecting I'll call him
But I just wanna know are you serious baby?
Damn right cause you must be crazy to think someone
Like me would just calm on down and still want you around me boy
I just used you and no longer
Need you so stop telling people this babydoll's with you</pre>
