[Diddy]
you gonna believe me now though 
tryin' to get up in your mind in your body your spirit 
take your soul 

[Chorus]
come here girl 
let me creep in your world 
let me see the backside of your moon 
no vickies only la perl-a
let me take you to indonesia 
where nobody can reach us
theres no need to take your phone 
'cause you far away from home 
baby let me be your tour guide 
I'm your burger 
you my fries 

[Diddy]
run through sets 
come through sets 
chicks hypnotized by my 1, 2 steps 
I'm way too fresh 
so complex 
niggas try to predict what I'm gonna do next 
lets get the party started 
far from a motherfuckin' starving artist 
got something to prove 
dont talk it, walk it
my niggas outside on them walkie talkies 
pop that trunk 
pass that dutch 
lets get crunk 
baby dont play dumb 
baby dont say none
its on me 
louie 13 and the cris on me 
dimes wall to wall in the vip 
the age dont mean a thing 
i ain't chi ali 
i bring them out with no id
them boys they bring them out like I'm t.i.p. 

[Chorus]
come here girl 
let me creep in your world 
let me see the backside of your moon 
no vickies only la perl-a
let me take you to indonesia 
where nobody can reach us
there's no need to take your phone 
'cause you far away from home 
baby let me be your tour guide 
I'm your burger 
you my fries 

[Twista]
ready for action when I attack on the track 
and I flat up a sac on strap on the cadillac and the glove 
could call me when you start shit with the ambassador of new york
and the queen of the chi 
and I'm backing her up 
flow be ugly but its a beautiful thing 
aluminum rings 
get money like I'm moving dem thangs
I got connects in every section 
when I'm up in the hood 
chain looking so nasty all the bitches going uhhh 
heard they wanna get me 
but I got my guns cocked 
I'm dirty ridin 30 somethin' cocked like yung joc 
I'm the talk of the town 
lettin' off 50 rounds 
meet me in a circle everybody its goin down 
give you hpnotiq to get you erotic 
and then I take you somewhere exotic 
where we can blow chronic 
a full clip for a lil drama 
you know I aint a hoe 
snap yo bitch 
come here lil mama you know you wanna go 

[Shawnna]
I'm from the city wit nothing pretty 
and everybody know 
I spit a flow to get up with diddy 
and now we finna blow 
niggas in the hood show me love 
I'm the girl 
pimp tight let my mink hang down to the floor 
pardon me if I gotta be a boss bitch 
I dont give a fuck what it cost bitch 
I floss big whips 
I floss big chains 
I talk big shit 
'cause I'm got big thangs 
now what you wanna do 
you betta not step 
now nigga move back 
let me catch my breath 
bring it, bring it back to the floor 
so sick with an ass so fat 
it's shawnna, twis' &amp; diddy with tim on the track 
you know it gotta be tint with 20's on the llac, ahhhh 
I see 'em looking at me like whats up 
but I'ma sit low in the cutttt</pre>
