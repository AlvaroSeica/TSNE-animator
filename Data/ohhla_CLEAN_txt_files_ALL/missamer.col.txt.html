[Intro - J. Cole - talking] (Sample from John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address)
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
(And so my fellow Americans
Ask not, what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country)
Excuse me

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggaz is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like proverbs
Niggaz don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke, 'cause she always givin bread to the church
Now Pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggaz holdin Desert Eagles like they Rambo
Pumpin my shit, always wonder why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's about the knowledge, not about who's suckin my dick
But oh well, I'm gonna sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece, I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggaz

[Break - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Took chances, slow dance with the Devil bitch
Overcomin the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
"If you ain't fuckin me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge"
Bring dollars, splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin hoes at the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin life on the edge

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
(Miss America), petty thoughts
(Miss America), petty thoughts
(Miss America), petty thoughts
Just to floss, pay any and every cost
Heavy heart, as I sit in this Range countin thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis, he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin, blood spillin, I love killin
Niggaz that swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassin shit
Bunch of bitches posin on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my Therapist shit
Movin careless as shit, in a city where niggaz really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young, little nigga tryin to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on them niggaz but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam, I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'm a pass your classes, I'm a learn your craft
I'm a fuck your daughters, I'm a burn your flag

[Break] - w/ ad libs

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - J. Cole - talking]
They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio</pre>
