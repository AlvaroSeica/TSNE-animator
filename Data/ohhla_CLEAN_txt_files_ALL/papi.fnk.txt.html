[Sun Doobie]
Don't worry, Kingpin Don Sun Juan
Papi Chulo, the only one, fun
Shake your booty, for my crew FunkDoobie
Yours truly lonely sleestak, kick my duty
Gettin groovy, Funk is ?Sun-ny to the Boonies?
Black hoodie, they'll say I'm home now boogie
What they told me, ?bunch of germ tango showbie?
Mango juicy, you know who I be
Latin formanizer, luxury liner
Fly designer, penthouse hind finder
Nuttin finer, than this latin mic sniper
Godiva's know who's hype, who brings it liver

[Chorus]
Soy, Papi Chulo, muerte la caldera
Soy, Papi Chulo, muerte la baca, ahh
Baby don't you know I wanna be with you
Ohhh baby let me see your body move...

[Daz Dillinger]
Papi wid it, notice how we rush the floor we get it
yo who did it (he did it) we bustin and we watch the deez spinnin
This inner zone's forbidden, Daz Dillinger comin
with the force of a cobra, and now you been bitten
Bustin to the extreme, show my, broadest and realest
You know me to get the illest, now hah, can you feel it?
Dope, gangsta FunkDoobie, all in my trunk, every
time you see me but you won't, check out the way I
smash stumps to rude comps, what?
Breakin down your doors, for you and yours, say what?
Bronze Tony's baddest status, a mean being
the brother's the toughest and the baddest, hah hah
Check it out

[Chorus]

[Sun Doobie]
The rugged 'Rican puts five to your blunts and
congo drummin, countin stacks by the hundreds
Doobie's comin, so don't act stubborn
Girls by the dozen get the toast uncut

[Cobra Red]
Senorita, toast strawberry margarita
Lady like ?man of bring? the pool out the heater
Big cash, no time for laughs when you request
?over? for hire, hoes retire, the battle was won
by the rest, we take your chest, intrude a vibe
that is best, game sewed up tight, like a seamstress
Petite, in a long ?spleen skin? skirt, puttin it work
Pushin em in the dirt, doin the maneuver, by being a flirt flirt

[Chorus]
Papi Chulo, I wanna do
the things you do, you make me move
Do what you do when you do
what you doooo
Baby don't you know
I wanna be with you
Whoaaaahhh baby let me see
your body moveeeeee!

[Sun Doobie - 2X]
Mueve las caderas 
muevela pa' acá
aquí está
señor boricua
Soy el papichulo
papichulo
soy el papichulo
papichulo</pre>
