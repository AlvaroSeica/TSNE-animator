[Intro]
Heary, heary, y'all come kick it ---&gt; K-Dee

Get a taste.. Get a taste..  -----&gt; King Tee

Heary, heary, y'all come kick it ---&gt; K-Dee

Get a taste.. Get a taste..  -----&gt; King Tee

[MC Eiht]
The hood done took me under no wonder
I'm still; chilling in the city with no pity
Steps out on my front Porch to check my spot
Bails to the store to get that Crooked I shot
I gots to have it in my body
Bring about two or three cases to the party
Yeah, don't give me that Old School Chicken bottle
Don't try to fool son, I want that cool one
The black Can is the one that I'm looking for
Make you stop at your neighborhood Liquor store
I save a quarter, just to pour it down
Known it tastes good to my homies around (*censored*) 
My Gs dipping, and we chill like the Outsiders
On my front lawn profiling low-riders
I hit the main (*censored*) and rewards to get loose
Reach in my pocket, get out my Deuce Deuce
St. Ides, St. Ides

Get a taste..  -----&gt; King Tee</pre>
