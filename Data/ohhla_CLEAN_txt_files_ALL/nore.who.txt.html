N-O-R easy
My nigga DJ WhooKid (WhooooooKid)

Aiyyo N-O-R, everybody loves me
Niggas wanna front, but niggas they can't thug me
Ride with Smirnoff, I just skip the bubbly
We could go outside and shoot shots thugly
N-O-R, everybody loves me
Niggas wanna front, but niggas they can't thug me
Drink Smirnoff, I just skip the bubbly
We could go outside and shoot shots thugly

These lil niggas actin like they even iller than me
Mo'fucker, y'all niggas ain't no killers than me
Ask Mike Livey, I had niggas shook
They call me Hit Hard NORE from the way that I hook
And I'm a Violator for real, before I knew Chris
Before "Banned From TV" my shit was switched
Aiyyo and I can handle any beat, I rock any beat
I stay alive and get head on any street
If I started it all over I'd be signed to Def Jam
Naw, fuck am I saying? Nigga I am
I used to pen well, nigga yo I can ???
Stop calling for a show, hit M-L
See you the most bogus, and I'm the most focused
And back then I had the crib with the most roaches
And WhooKid, smash niggas til they both notice
And we could do this like back and forth
But right now I ain't tryin' to go back up north
See the dorm too cold, the food too fast
In the cell, beatin' off is a bitch with no ass

*NORE talking*

N-O-R, everybody loves me
Niggas wanna front, but niggas they can't thug me
Ride with Smirnoff, I just skip the bubbly
We could go outside and shoot shots thugly
N-O-R, everybody loves me
Niggas wanna front, but niggas they can't thug me
Drink Smirnoff, I just skip the bubbly
We could go outside and shoot shots thugly</pre>
