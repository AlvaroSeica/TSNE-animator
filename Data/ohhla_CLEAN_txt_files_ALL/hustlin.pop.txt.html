[Chorus: Pops]
Got me goin' crazy
Hustlin' for my baby
Times gettin' shady
Hustlin' for my baby

[Pops]
(Verse 1)
Am I doing it right? Sometimes, I don't know
I'm tryin' so hard, but will it ever show
Money can't buy love, then money can't pay the bills
And love can't pay the doctor when my little girl's ill
I'm strugglin'
Tryna make things right
With what little I have, money's so damn tight
Got a dead-end job that pays half the minimum
Most my dollars, to the, bills, I'm givin' 'em
Tired of this
Being broke all the time
Got dreams of making it big, spittin' these rhymes
And I'm tired of seeing my little baby girl cry
Cause her friends got what she don't have, she wanna know why
What kind of daddy am I?
To give her life so rough
I keep tryin', but it seems like it's never enough
At the end of the day, when I'm tired and unhappy
My baby says "No matter what, I still love ya, daddy"

[Chorus] - 2X

(Verse 2)
Livin' life ghetto
Broke as fuck
Got a world full of drama, dealin' with my baby's mama
Tryin' to be a man, the perfect dad for my baby
With a mama on my back, damn, it's drivin' me crazy
Sometimes, I feel I'm losin' my mind
But I got a little girl, so I'm keepin' in line
Tryin' to maintain in a world so cold
Tryna keep a real job in a world where drugs are sold
Got a job, breakin' my back, a one bedroom shack
And there's always drivebys where my baby's school is at
What kind of life is this
For my daughter to see
But this is all that I can afford, so this is where we gotta be
Fuck that I had it
Livin' life scandalous
I gotta change somethin' cause my mind just can't handle this
Diggin' to my pockets and see what I got
Make a move, now I'm the new dog spot on the block
Damn

[Chorus] - 2X

(Verse 3)
I thought life would get better
By slangin' some rocks
But it's only getting worse cause it's so damn hot
And then if I get caught, tell me how's that gonna look
With me headin' up state
And my baby gettin' took
Away from my daddy
My life would end
Lord, tell me why they make good money, I must sin
It ain't about me, so I ain't being greedy
And if you got kids, then you know it ain't easy
Workin' 9 to 5 for your baby, doing it right
Barely making enough to pay the rent and the light
And so on and so on, it gets no better
But now I'm kickin' rhymes, bout to make major cheddar
Tryna make it happen and I got a good shot
Doing it all for my daughter cause she's all that I got
Tryna make my baby girl proud of her daddy
Someone that could floss her in a brand new Caddy

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
