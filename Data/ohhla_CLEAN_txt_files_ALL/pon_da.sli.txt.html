Song:   Pon Da Horizon
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Stare at the horizon
Fell beyond a tree
Fell into the ocean
Melt into the sea
Stare at the horizon
Millions miles of it
See my love on the horizon
Like an ocean bottom me

I'm calling
Pass the weed man pass the D
My girl, play this song again
My children, past the D, man you are free
My people, live in love and unity</pre>
