[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Give them niggas what they deserve and that's nothing
Kick them niggas to the curb, word, they stay fronting, man
No, I won't let them eat, won't let them breathe and won't let them sleep, man
Give them niggas what they deserve and that's nothing
Kick them niggas to the curb, word, they stay fronting, man
No, I won't let them eat, won't let them breathe and won't let them sleep, man
Give them niggas what they deserve and that's nothing
Kick them niggas to the curb, word, they stay fronting, fam

[Dom Pachino]
Yeah, I'm back on the block again
Back carrying oxes again, I need oxygen
Man, for these bitches, I need a mach for sale
I need a couple vests today, these New York cops are killing
They say you give and receive
What if you give all you got and got nothing you need
Nothing for your mom dukes, nothing for seeds
I'm not talking about me, cuz I'mma grind knowing that I got
Something to see, got something with my name on the shit, bitch
And it's coming to me, and you gonna see
Here's a little something for fronting on me, you looking hungry eat wood
You nothing to me, when I was hungry, you had nothing to give
Nothing to eat, and you wan' think this little bitch ass shit sweet
But when I see you round town, we handle this in the street, man

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
You ain't popping bubble gum, you don't want no trouble, son
Stand there, watch them run, when you ain't hurting none
Watch how we folding, son, don't let me get a hold of them
I take control of them, in the streets, I know the code to them
Give them something that they didn't expect, a hot record
Half a mil on the track, hundred thousand on the necklace
Now I'm, on the guest list
And little faggot niggas like you is on my deathwish
And now my taste is expensive
If I want, then I buy it, no longer do I rent it
No longer do I stress it, when money come double, so niggas could come test it
And get they chest blessed, kid
And get they chest blessed, kid

[Chorus]</pre>
