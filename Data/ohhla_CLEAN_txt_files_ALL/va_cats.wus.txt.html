Intro
Watch yourself
Keep where my eyes could see
International
Crime Syndicate
Thugs, niggas
Whatsup Whatsup

{Myalansky}
Cats be eyeing me, somebody snitching somebody dying see
Twenty five hundred a big ache, heard he was buyin three
Stop lying, money was sweating, my man was eyeing his leat
Slap off his bracelet with ice, and jetted cross the street
Death was my first instinct, I had to stop and think
Smiling faces always remember, they rock ya ass to sleep
Disregard this camouflage batter shattering thirty teeth
Heist pulling drug selling niggas coming from dirty street
Look what? Pretty boy get him, right there yo pass the heat
Heard he like to trigga bang slang, but he ain't ass fast as me
Slip behind a trash can blasting watching his ass retreat
Chrome is two turned bitch, I love this city heat
Arsenal, blazin them weapons when there some murder beef
He's unheard of sort of, VA Cats, them dirty streets

Chorus:

Unheard of VA Cats, we bring it well done
Do them dolo hit, we never tell none
Sittin in the cell for blazing hell's gun
We aight though, we just dip bail
And like they say or somethin
You heard of us VA Cats, for real

{Joe Mafia}
I heard the judge got a grudge
No love for thugs pushing drugs
Guerilla warfare with ice mugs
Inside the borough, pure bred head the stero
Style deniro, slottin in chrome is hero
The Max Mil era, I pick steel whenever
Time to exercise my five, your a terror
Ill vatal, roll with my crime team and feel stable
With your betrayal, I place you in the field cradle
I heard a thirty eight, it ain't hurt regurgitate
Swerving in the irving, sippin Feron in the paper chase
With thug niggas, that's born to rub niggas
Trickin gold diggas, my whole mentality is "Fuck niggas"
Mafioso, the savage, breakin your barrage
Crossbows, aiming darts at your torso
Constrictor, boa, backdraft a flame thrower
Bank quoters, I damn pulled a Range Rover
Melting glaciers, the ice water
Spit gems to murders, twin propellars, ice cold polar
Burn solar, king traced the god sonar
Holding a toaster, alias on wanted posters
Sweepstake, my whole click is keep safe
For Pete's sake, I generate wait and scape
What's in the lab? Crime Syndicate fam patrol the ave
What's today math was bad

Chorus

{Myalansky}
Street science for night time crime, bullets ricochet
Constantly inclining them faggots need some reminding
Split your coat lining, Crack bone marrows having that ass crying
Rob shit just like DeNiro, keeping cigars lit
Fed pop but don't know shit, we camouflage with
Scandals come in hand in your turnpike, for trafficin
Virginia, that's where money was head, and drop the packages
On the corner, there that cat go, he's come flaggin it
Don't let that cat to my man, money aight and shit
Them new cats was plottin to get them
I'm coming back let them
Greatin ass faggot you pussy, this time we murder them
It's unheard of VA Cats be on some dirty shit

Chorus

Outro:

Va Cats for real
California yo
My Miami niggas
My real New York niggas
Jamaica P
All my live niggas
all my cuban link niggas
Raekwon, big Daddy-O, big Daddy-O</pre>
