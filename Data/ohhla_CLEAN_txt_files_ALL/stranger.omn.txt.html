so many faces, some are from ages
driven crazy, I stare in amazement
can you relate to something you aint been thru
maybe you can understand if it happened to you
and I'm a rebel, I fight for a cause
your not on my level
your nearly your god
and I don't think theres anybody that can do what you do
or be who you are, you and I are misunderstood
and your

strange (strange), not quite the same
what's your name (name) don't play that game (x2)

you're a stranger, strangers
don't talk to strangers (x4)

strange (strange), not quite the same
what's your name (name) don't play that game (x2)

I recognize the voice but I couldn't place a name to it
looked up and saw his face change, the strangest shit
I couldn't think, I couldn't blink
it couldn't be
I walked off and put my hoodie up until I couldn't see
time pass√©, heat flashes, I need matches
chain smoking till my feet soaked in black ashes
he night crashes at a cheap hotel
I'm at the front desk, ringing the bell, I need some help its

strange (strange), not quite the same
what's your name (name) don't play that game (x2)
you're a stranger, strangers
don't talk to strangers (x4)

and you're an angel, sent from above
you know how this game goes, I'm falling in love
I wanted to tell you but you already knew
plus these words couldn't express how I feel about you
you're a heart breaker, I couldn't replace ya
I don't hate ya, its part of your nature
and I don't think theres anybody that can do what you do
or be who you are, you and I are misunderstood
and your

strange (strange), not quite the same
what's your name (name) don't play that game (x2)

you're a stranger, strangers
don't talk to strangers (x4)

strange (strange), not quite the same
what's your name (name) don't play that game (x2)</pre>
