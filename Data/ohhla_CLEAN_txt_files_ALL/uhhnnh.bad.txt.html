Seed's this..
Here we go..
Uhhnnh, here we go y'all
Here we go y'all, once again..
Yeah, who betta nigga?
Let's go

[Verse One]
Nope, I never got locked up, never got shot up
But fuck around though, beat your whole damn block up
Find your bitch knocked up, Seed keep it cocked up
Sick, call a doctor, beat the shit out ya
Beef? I don't sweat that, niggas wanna dead that
They come home, find a bullet andtheir girl head red
Uhhhnhh, how you love that, what happened to them thug cats
And all the gats they was getting in the club at
Now y'all done fucked up, I done caught y'all fronting
Get ya jaw tabbed up, with ya chin bone buzzin
You can't squash, now you all alone cousin
Your kids got no pops, wife no husband
Goddamn shame though, that's how the game go
Why y'all acting like ya don't know my fucking name fo'
(IT'S BAAAAAAD SEED) Style off the chain yo
Only close my eyes when I'm getting brains yo

[Hook]
It's like uhhnhh
Thought it was a game huh, didn't know the name huh? Uhhnnh
It's like, it's like.. uhhnnh
Still for the kids dog, niggas let ya clips off, uhhnnh
It's like uhhnnh
Bitches take ya thong off
Shake ya stink ass baby girl til the song off, uhhnnh
Meet me at the ball dog, blow shorty back out
'Til she gotta crawl out

[ Verse Two ]
And I'm tired of you rap cats, where you get the tracks at
Scratch that, put your dough up dog, match that
BROOKLYN! Where the killers and the crooks live
BROOKLYN! The pot where the beat cookin
Catch you while you ain't lookin, right hooks and look kid
Get your self esteem took kid
Shorty ass fast, think I gotta bag that, right hips, sit back, collect ASCAP
Roll a L, pass that, steal a whip, smash that
Bad Seed, hot light, mama flap decks
Stay in the cut, made nigga, stay with a slut
And I'm a very cheap nigga, I don't pay for the butt
I stash cash, baby girl wow, you must got be mistaken for pub
Spend a lot of dough, only on me
Not a Prada for you boo, but you can catch a Rollie on me

[Hook]
It's like uhhnhh
Thought it was a game huh, didn't know the name huh? Uhhnnh
It's like, it's like.. uhhnnh
Still for the kids dog, niggas let ya clips off, uhhnnh
It's like, it's like.. uhhnnh
Bitches take ya thong off
Shake ya stink ass baby girl til the song off, uhhnnh
Meet me at the ball dog, blow shorty back out
'Til she gotta crawl out, uhhnnh
