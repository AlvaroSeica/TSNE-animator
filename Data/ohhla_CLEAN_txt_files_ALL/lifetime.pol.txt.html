[ VERSE 1: Torae ]
Yo
Who you know more sick with the spit, more slick with the gift?
It'll take a lifetime to get with
I'm the top competitor, editor, ProTool predator
Studio sabotage and I beast the bars
They say my lyrical range is further than yours
So if I shoot for Saturn I land on the stars
When I talk about Saturn I ain't talkin the cars
I mean the next door neighbor to Mars
I'm amazingly ( ? ), retartedly hard
Solo, group or squad
I put 16 darts on the beat, give me applause
Cause the more ( ? ) you hype, more muppets to snipe
Niggas chains get swiped, ( ? ) up with a knife
More ( ? ) with the white than the typical type
Puttin all this fictional hype in the sentence he write
When it come to the stu' and what I do on the mic
It'll take niggas a lifetime to get it right

[ VERSE 2: Torae ]
Yo
I don't know if it's the appeal, the thrill, the lackluster skills
But something about these niggas that's out I don't feel
You should see 'em front the radio when I get a chill
Every track back to back it'll be somethin ill
Now the lack of the skill got us slackin for real
To the point I could do joints, I ain't lookin for deals
Kinda hurtin my feelings, the damage you build
Shit is hard to be a fan of it still, dammit for real
Bound to hand him a mirror for he see how he look
And I ain't tryin to throw the book at you, just throw out your book
Oh I forgot, y'all don't write, niggas be so tight
They do magic in the booth - just poof - niggas is nice
You can say what you like about me and my type
Or give it any label you like, y'all know that I'm right
When it come to the stu' and what I do with the mic
It'll take niggas a lifetime to get it right

[ VERSE 3: Torae ]
George Bush don't fuck with blacks, Torae don't fuck with wack
MC's and they garbage tracks
Back to the drawing board with that
The fuck you doin recordin that?
Hit me more on the scratch
Nigga, get the thoughts out of your head
I'm lightyears, days, hours ahead
Most of y'all rap niggas coulda stayed in bed
If that bullshit the best that you did
Shit is garbage, you dig, my nig
But this the shit
You could copy what I write and I'ma still get biz
That was just to show love, no subliminal diss
I'ma take it to the max as a minimalist
You feminine ish, you bitch like the faggety type
You can hit your website and type to your delight
Cause when it come to the booth and what I do with the mic
It'll take niggas a lifetime to get it right
