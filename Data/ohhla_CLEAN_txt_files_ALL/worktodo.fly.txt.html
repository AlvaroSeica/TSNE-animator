Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do
Fly got work to do

[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
Back wid plenty work to do, Playa job is never through
Just another busta bustin' hustla cause my game is true
Do or die, down wid you, jumpin out Fly wi-zay fool
Work is bought and time is short, that won't keep this playa cool
Must I come up wid it from decision sittin' on the bluff
Workin' out to rock the house, many youngsters get it buck
Rollin' wid the rough and tough, risin' wid the early sun
All about my hog, standin tall, when my job is done
Then you know that I'm the one, only one, for the one,
One who gives me power over cowards till thy kingdom come
Fly will be second to none, toastin' every chauvinist
Male or female makes me bail when I choose to dis
My time that rock market pacin' poppin' on Fly paperchase
Not illegal ain't sequel the playa moves on me makin' pay
Sayin' what I wanna man, cause I'm backed up by a crew
Down wid me to clown wid me, what Flizy got work to do

Chorus:
(Fly got work to do keeps shouting over singing)

Fly, Fly, Fly got work to do
He's got a job baby, he's got a job baby
Oh ohohhhh, Fly, Fly, Fly got work to do
He's got a job baby, he's got a job baby

[Verse 2: Playa Fly]
Tell me how to do my job, boy that ain't your job to do
If you plan on yankin' Playa, Playa plan on yankin' you
Most unlawful entry of the century that you ever seen
Don't attack my dollars you will holla as this playa gleam
Stealin' robbin' killin' mobbin' never is a job ah mine
But if Funkytown take me under, I'm bonin' you all the time
Insist to commit a crime, Allah is not likin' you
When you play wid the child of God, my God gon' play wid you
Still wid plenty work to do, speak or hold a brother's peace
Playa choose to represent with intent to make mil increase
Opposition is deceased, Fly response for some and pay
Ain't got time for cuttin' games that you suckas choose to play
Your plan I will infiltrate, I'm strapped wid the piece of manner
Like other down brothas Flizy got sense and that ain't my kind
Playa is the subject of the public with nothing to prove
Don't you try to tell me Flizy know what Playa gotta do, gotta do

Chorus

[Verse 3: Playa Fly]
Rappin of my mission with intention to this pimpin' now
Stackin' up some paper cuttin' capers takin' lemons out
Workin' out and showin' out to be the best that Fly can be
Easy done and easy said will sure and that's forever G
Chuckle back me up, if a playa  have to handle this
Fly ain't got no work boots cause my family who I'm rollin' wit
In this click you can enlist, it's reserved that you deserve
For the unique motivated playa showin' skill superb
I-B-N be full of bird, dirty dud and D-A-B
Pee wee we gon' get 'em if they crossin' out yo fi-zo G
Since you issue idle threats, boy you betcha come correct
More determine than Kermit and you Miss Piggy so get it checked
Stay away from this Playa Fly, hangin' low and chiefin' high
I'll be found with the crown on me with the sound like no other guy
Don't invest in the Triple mess, just a waste of time for you
Mixin' business and pleasure right when you make it Fly chargin' you
