God is here (2X) 
Necronomicon is comming
God is here (2X) 

[Blaze]
Mass murderer, strangler
Wig splitter, mangular
Blood sucking vampire
Dark Lotus king of fire

[Violent J]
I swing off your ceiling fan and jump like an ape
And stomp on your head until it pops like a grape

[Marz]
And now you flatline 
Cuz I shot your face nine times 
All you see is bright white lights
then you feel your heart stop
Well bro good as day is any day to die to ride
I dont give a motherfucking fuck buh-buh-bye-bye

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Sitting on a tree branch like a crow I haunt your every move
Dropping down on motherufuckers backs and twist they heads like screws

[Violent J]
Fuck your electric chair, I don't care
Bring it on bitch
Crack an egg on my head I'll fry you an omlette

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Deep off in the woods naked I do my fire dance
Around a pit of hot with my skull drums and voodoo chants

[Jamie Madrox]
What it take to be an egg it will never take shape
It'll only mutate
See the fetus with a microphone
3 arms, 2 brains, and only one leg (only one leg)

[Violent J]
Shoot me, c'mon blow a hole in my lung
I'll lick out the hole when I swallow my tounge

[Jamie Madrox]
Death to the whole fuckin world where hate and anger's the key
You can tell that the judge was re-creating all that shit you see on TV

[Marz]
I feel for the unclean
Letter Unseen, Me the obsecene
Make your eyes bleed to the extereme
What do dreams mean?
when you wake up screaming
With a demon, sucking on your dick eating semen

[Blaze]
Bullets passing through your skull
Bam my fist into your jaw
Retract my hand, release your teeth
Chiclets fallin to the street

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Pull youe eyelids over your head, staple them to your skull
Drip bleach into your eyes as I face-fuck your girl

[Chorus]
This bread I eat, This hope I swear
As I inflate myself with prayer
There is no grace, there is no gill
This is the love do what thou will(x1)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
A cup full of chicken blood, 3 shakes of a monkey paw
I have you cutting through your own arm bone with a hacksaw

[Blaze]
Bones exposed from the skin
Blood drips from innocence
Pulling lungs up outta chests
Leaving bodies where they rest

[Marz]
The voices in my head is whispering, listen (you must kill them)
Hammer to the head, they family gone missing (kill all of them) 

[Jamie Madrox]
When we attack, we attack like a swarm
Punch through your face, rip off your neck and play my
rythm on your vocal chords

[Violent J]
I walk on your ceiling, and drop thread in your mouth
Let posion drip down it and silently take you out

[Jamie Madrox]
One bee protecting the hive, we stay alive
I'm on overdrive; with my axe will you survive?

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fuck a formulated plan, reflex come and take control
Dip my hand in broken glass and pull your heart out through your butthole

[Violent J]
My eyeballs are black, my tears drip like oil
I fuck holes in my yard and grow children from soil

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
See through the eyes of they dead, they come back alive 
I want the air out your lungs now I see through your eyes

[Marz]
Cyanide, do the body ride
Motherfucker can't hide
Cuz I'm in your mind
And we finna bring the die
Cock back, never aim just let it ride

[Violent J]
Scientists study me, but they always quit (why?)
Cuz I eat through my butthole and talk nothing but shit

[Blaze]
Dark Lotus devestation
Murder without no pre-meditation
Demons from beyond the earth
creepin up on off the dirt

[Chorus]

[Violent J and Jamie Madrox]
Posion us with their preception (2X)
Lightining follow their deception (2X)
I look at my relection (2X)
God's resurrecton (2X)

[Chorus] - 2X

[Violent J]
Gods resurrection (2X)
Look at my reflaction
Gods resurrection (3X)</pre>
