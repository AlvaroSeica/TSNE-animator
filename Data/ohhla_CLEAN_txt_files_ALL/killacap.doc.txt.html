(Intro)

(Doc)
Yo nigga they bustin watch your bacc
God looks at Zo
Yeah its the loc
Pass the motha fuccin meana
Cuz I'm dumpin cuz they dumpin on me
Drop the "Ides" Zo
Lucky I was high popped off five
And something threw me bacc 
That ripped the shit up out my side
Damn I'm spinnin
Niggas ain't kill me yet so I got up dumpin
Them niggas hit so quick how could I do somethin
Damn I'm out too
Around the field and out of dodge
We coo was breathin hard
Then I seen the hole up in my blue
So now I'm stunned and let my shirt ride
Losin my high
I spot the blood not like all over me
But I'm feelin tired
So I passed the strap to Ant
Tight just cuz I'm shot up in my gut
Got this crampin and shit
Zo like "come on Doc, we out"
Now bout this time I ran my ass bacc in the apartment
Got the phone dialed the 9-1-1
Dropped the phone and fell on the floor
Ant like "don't die on me Doc
Loc you gonna C coo"
And I'm like "yo cuz nigga bacc up of me
Fool you're smutherin all my breathin room"
I'm takin short breathes
Would've swore to Gardens that I was dead
Big X was right ain't one motha fucca alive
With a bulletproof forehead
And I'm feelin faint
Knowin my insides is to-up
So now I lay me down
But it's still Lincoln Village Killa
  
Chorus
  
(Doc)
