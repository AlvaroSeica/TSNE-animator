[Verse One: Twista]
Now I know it's been a long time since a muthafucka done made a good song about reefa
And who better for you to handle this then a tidanamo with analys of the cannabis sativa
Go and get a pillow and a cigerillo if I know it's the killa I'm yellin roll one up joe
Open the backwood up trippin on me cause I was sloppy I better get fucked up though
I be smokin 4 diffrent kinds of kush it's the best of me especially the purple and the og
But ya'll might call it the granddad rather safer and take a pull slowly
I ledge low ain't no doubt about it that somebodys gon peep me
Go ahead and ride I think I'm a chill because I'm kinda sleepy
Me and my niggas in my crew will get into it now we be at odds hardly
Cause we smokin on a ounce of the ganja that bob marley
Me a rock to the reggaemusic whenever me feel the spliff workin
Kill off in dem rudeboy fin take away my herb when the herbs in

[Chorus]
Smokin on dat fire(smokin on dat fire)
Puffin on dat dro(puffin on dat dro)
Kush weed gets me higher(kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed(and the diesel get me blowed) [x2]

[Verse Two: Twista]
Smell good, let me hit dat
Blow kush with Ball&amp;MJG
Smoke haze, I use to a Seagal
Freeway put me on to the backwoods
And Bleek introduced me to Diesel
And Snoop turned me on to The Chronic
smokin it I was feelin bionic
lookin at me rollin a blunt and I'm huffin and puffin
and I can't get enough of this stuff
am I loosin my logic, you can smell all of my follicles
and I'm a follow you cause of the dro
but if it ain't, I'm call my autobile
I be gettin nothin but love cause I be smokin the bud
it's lookin like it's from a high time auto particles
I be grindin up with the hash
and I put some on yo blunt if you come up with the stash
so take it to the head it's a gift from coupe
but if I share it with a bitch, I'm a be fuckin her ass
stay havin sessions and my ends is plenty
so when I'm smokin my friends is with me
make em feel the slow breeze cause I blow trees like the windy city
let me call up the weed man cause if we out
then shit we on it, me and you can hook up
and go get an ounce and I got 250 on it

[Chorus]
Smokin on dat fire(smokin on dat fire)
Puffin on dat dro(puffin on dat dro)
Kush weed gets me higher(kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed(and the diesel get me blowed) [x2]

[Verse Three: Lil Boosie]
Extra blowed, top floor in the double tree
in dis Chi-Town winter smokin dis kush shit back to back
Got me rippin track to track like Webbie say where dat real at
dat one hit and you feel dat, I know I'm a dog I then smoke train?
betta yet, I'm a smoke til it hurt my chest
on the east coast they feed me man, kilt me with dat diesel man
got me in New York eatin everything
Dade County jamaican kush, thick to the bag(yeah)
put my whole click on his ass, don't like to brag
but I smoke, choke on the best of the best
I be high as giraffe pussy when I'm up in the west
I chopped and tired I'm so high, I then smoked dat biscuit
smell good let me hit dat, dats why michael phelps did dat

[Chorus]
Smokin on dat fire(smokin on dat fire)
Puffin on dat dro(puffin on dat dro)
Kush weed gets me higher(kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed(and the diesel get me blowed) [x2]
Smell good, let me hit dat</pre>
