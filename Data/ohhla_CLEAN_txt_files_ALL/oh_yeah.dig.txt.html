Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro - Lupe Fiasco]
Diggy, what's good man
It's your big brother, Lupe
Long time coming
It's like the future meets the future, the future
Ya heard
With some of that laid back light up some of that (?)
(?)
You know some of that make you wonder
Make you ponder
What's he on
Most likely what's beyond ya
It's a beautiful thing

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
This gone a fine right
See it in my minds eye
Black man in a white man's world, blind sight!
Sweeter than (?) pies
Look how fast the time flies
Where you gonna be when the parties over and the wine dries
Yeah we got nine lives
But they got nine knives
We only get one chance and they get 9 tries
Tell you that dimes fly
Baby girls a fine price
All I see is money when I look inside this dimes eye
Life's a bitch I'll be rich if I make her cry
Tears of tissue turns to money if you let it dry
Increase my work if she get hurt
I'll make a fortune if she dies
Take her off of that machine
I'll benefit from her demise
Damn, that's how we are
Take a life then buy out the bar
So lets celebrate
Lets make a toast
To succeed in life just make a ghost

[Chorus - Diggy Simmons]
Oh yeah [repeated]
I got it like
They screaming like
I can't hear ya, louder
I got it like
They screaming like
Turn it up
Oh yeah
You hear the crowd
They want it now
I puts it down, oh yeah
Owooh oh yeah yeah
Owooh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
The one metatronic
Mind control's sonics
Davis and Shapira(?) if your tryna get me on it
Bitches miss me they on it
Haters just leave a comment
And if how I (?) make you sick of me. vomit
Let me finish my composite
As the game change it's interesting how odd the cards get
Such a random thing and so ironic
I used to oh yeah, trying to defy logic
Trying to be the birdy, Jay said it was too early
Just trying to tell you what's happening, Shirly
I use my gut when my vision gets murky
Help me, but thank you Lord at the same time Mercy
Excuse my french I guess I am not worthy
Quietly watch your number like your watch, observe me
Often misunderstood you often get me wrong
Y'all tryna get it in, I'm tryna get it on
Life is your wife that keep calling me saying you did it wrong
Life don't suck, suck life till her titty gone
You niggas mission wrong
Plus you misinformed
Hanging under assholes you get shitted on

[Chorus - Diggy Simmons]
Oh yeah [repeated]
I got it like
They screaming like
I can't hear ya, louder
I got it like
They screaming like
Turn it up
Oh yeah
You hear the crowd
They want it now
I puts it down, oh yeah
Owooh oh yeah yeah
Owooh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 3 - Diggy Simmons]
Uh, ahead of time, sometime like a pre-me
And I got the co-sign from the (?)
I don't see none of y'all, you see me
Y'all can't see me you Stevie
Blow up and I make it look easy
Yeah I'm so wack cause I'm on TV
If I am such an amateur, when I come around what you panic for?
Cause you know I'm hotter than a planets core
Hands are sore from writing ice
Colder than a winters lighting device
My clock is mantle and my timing's tight
I know you think Lupe's writing right
But I'm this nice, foolish thoughts
Got more class than a school is taught
You haters talk out your cheeks I call it (?)
I hold it down in the streets I rep that New York
Just a young-un that's doing his thing
So why are you distraught
I got you buster's so gusted
Cause I wasn't so much (?)
(?)
Don't watch me, watch the repeats
You ain't ready now I think I'm Big Meech!

[Chorus - Diggy Simmons]
Oh yeah [repeated]
I got it like
They screaming like
I can't hear ya, louder
I got it like
They screaming like
Turn it up
Oh yeah
You hear the crowd
They want it now
I puts it down, oh yeah
Owooh oh yeah yeah
Owooh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah</pre>
