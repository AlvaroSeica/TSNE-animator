[Intro: T.I.]
Okay, ay man
I'm sucka free, sucka duckin
Tell all them suckas get the fuck out my way man
Ya understand? G SEASON~!

[T.I.]
Told you motherfuckers once, prison ain't change me
All it did was made a nigga crazy, deranged, see?
Psycho, nutso, what I give a fuck fo'?
All I know now is to get out and go for the gusto
So, fuck niggaz, fuck hoes
He said, she said, nigga and what, so?
Fuck what they say 'bout my cases, fuck what they say 'bout my lady
Fuck what they say we were doin on that day in visitation
All I care 'bout is my out date and this next year of probation
How much dough I'm set to make and where I'm gon' go on vacation
Wait (wait) damn (damn) okay that's way too far ahead of me
So I'm just tryin to take it day-to-day if they would let a G
breathe; cop cars by the threes
Bitches call me Papa John cause I keep that extra cheese
Overseas in the sun, livin for the fun
in Milan with some bad bitches probably wanna yawn{?}
When will it dawn on them I'm a don?
Ridin foreign, curtains drawn, gettin blown by a blonde
I'm the bomb, terrorist, hella rich, wreckin shit
Nigga ask about me homie I suggest you tell 'em this

[Chorus: T.I.]
I'm sucka duckin, I'm sucka free
You ain't a G, don't fuck with me
Them sucka niggaz out of style, G season
Them sucka niggaz out of style, G SEASON~!

[Meek Mill]
G season! Meek Milly!
Oh, big plates on my Aston Martin, bitch I'm ballin (ballin)
Killin all my haters, tell your momma pick ya coffin (yeah)
Hundred rounds shorty, I just gotta pick a target
Put my name on that flier, watch the party get retarded
And I go crazy in that bitch, look like Baby in that bitch
Got yo' lady on my dick cause I got like 80 on my wrist
K.O.D., I make it rain, I know they hate me in that bitch
So I be there, just throw that moolah like they paid me for that shit
Hold up~! Started in the back, now I'm that nigga in the front
Shorty want the real and I'ma give her what she want
OG nigga, you can put it in the blunt
Fuckin all the baddest bitches, I'ma hit 'em from the front
Just to see the faces on 'em when the nigga lay it on 'em
E'ry time she ride that dick I tell her go Jamaican on it
Lord have mercy, these bitches thirsty
I'm in the Merci', she kissin on me, Hershey's
We in this bitch~! I'm sucka duckin (yeah) I'm sucka free (free)
That's yo' main bitch? (Bitch) She fuckin me (me!)
I don't fuck with niggaz (niggaz) I'm a fuckin G (G)
It's Meek Milly, T.I., fuckin P!

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Hey, my best flow too cold to just bring it out
But go to talkin crazy though you'll get yourself singled out
Half a million bucks to pack a whole arena out
Bein a sucka I don't know the first thing about
You get the scene about for comin out your face
Like a volcano hair, lava runnin out your face
Hey, if ya ass out of place
You'll find the weapons they took away, I'll replace
What can I say? Another year another case
Another sentence completed, I'm confident and conceited
I'm sucka free, sucka duckin, so tell them suckas to beat it
Don't fuck with me busta, trust me your future will be deleted
Such a G, ain't no touchin me, luckily I defeated the odds
Without my tool, Allah and glory to God
And I ain't even Islamic, so sick whenever I vomit
Just throw me a mil' or two and that oughta settle my stomach
'Bout some money he done it, call me Mr. He Run It
These niggaz ain't really 'bout it, they just be speakin ebonics
I'm nothin short of iconic, promise you ya don't want it
Strong as gin and tonic, my left you won't see it comin
My right you'll be runnin from it, I catch you with it you done
I'ma keep it a hun'ned, you better get you a gun
Haha, word bond, real talk
Do my dirt all by my lonely cause them suckas will talk

[Chorus]</pre>
