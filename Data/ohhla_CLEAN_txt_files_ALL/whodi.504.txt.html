[Master P]
our mission is to get money, power, and bitches, ya heard me?

Chorus: repeat 2X

Where you at whodi? (I'm over here whodi)
I'm in dat 5, dat 0, to da 4, ya heard

[Master P]
We drive Excursions with TV's
Bubble eye humvees
A mouth full of gold teeth
and i represent that CP3
Where my niggaz on the block boy
Open up shop boy
and they'll kill ya for them rocks boy
Gimme some money, dollars and I'ma give you 400 back
Give it to me in powder and imma change it into crack
I'm tryna change my life but im tired of bein broke
Thats why I post up with my niggaz and we hustle by the store

Chorus (2x)

[Magic]
(Where you at whodi?)  I'm over here Shaggy
Smokin my do-do in the mo-mo in the black navi
Bitches will love to have me, because I'm livin lavish
I'll take some pussy but head is what really makes me happy
I'm downtown in the 9th ward, Saint Claude
Friday night when the boulevard is full of beacoup broads
Im on the scene full of Henny
New Orleans love me so I ain't gotta spend a fuckin penny
I let em know that I'm a 504 boy from across the Canal...

[Mystikal]
...And I'm from the 12th, I roll by myself
and if you can't tell, I'm bad for your health
Bitch im the man, keep up if you can
Yall niggaz cant stand it
When i come with them uptown niggaz 
from the 504 with a gun in both hands
I'm the tracks, I'm the wheel on the tanks
I live on the bill in the banks
I come in and do my thang 
Where the motherfucka that think I'm playin?

Chorus (2x)

[Mr. Marcello]
Life in the bricks, believe me niggaz we live it
If they aint made it yet then bitch they gotta build it
Money to the ceiling, I used to sell rocks on blocks
Fuckin round wit Master P, nigga got NY socks
Whodi I'm hot, enough cash to buy yall blocks
Trucks...hold, I got NYPD locked
I'm a killa nigga, raw dog guerrilla nigga
Try to download the spot cuz willow was hot nigga

[Silkk]
When I come through I come through wild
Come through foul, come through loud
Run through the crowd, run 2000
Come through this kickin like its kung-fu style
From the front to the rear whodi, it's No Limit year whodi
(Yo Silkk where you at?) I'm in this No Limit gear whodi

Chorus (2x)

[C-Murder]
Where I'm at? I'm over here, in the project on the block
Im C-Murder, I'm bout dat drama nigga
Fuck you and your mamma 
Incarcerate me if you could 
But you gotta find me in the hood
Im foreva gettin blunted 
Nigga, No Limit niggaz keep comin
Never runnin from them bitches
Dumpin fools up in ditches
And snitches, I give em motherfuckin stitches
Dat 504, tha Calliope, we rattle street and rust ya blade
Duck nigga, watch yo head, it could be ya early grave
Check your rearview, lock them doors
Beat your hoes and cock ya shit
Count your money by the bit 
and get TRU niggaz in your clique nigga
N-O, L-I, M-I to the T
It's just a bunch of crazy motherfuckers just like me
