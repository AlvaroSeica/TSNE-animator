[Chorus: Dyce Payne]
They 'gon say the same thing (About us) It's always been the same thing (About us)
We 'gon stay the same way (About us) Never will we ever change
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!

[Verse One: Styles P]
King everlastin into money and fashion (Kings!)
Champagne and good weed smoke is my passion
Whoever makin the plate, I need the biggest ration
Get the type of headache that'll melt down aspirin
Wake-Wake-Wakin up gaspin, dancin with the devil
Breakin bread with assassins, pain when I'm laughin (Pain!)
Boss shit, I shoot the office you put your staff in
Enjoy now, 'cause in the future you'll be a has been
King of the four five thirty niggas that all ride (All ride)
You don't wanna bullet in your mouth like fluoride
Louch, 'Kiss and I let a bullet it off sword'll fly (Whattup)
Kings of the slums frontline when it's war time (Frontline!)
Nigga!

[Chorus: Dyce Payne]
They 'gon say the same thing (About us) It's always been the same thing (About us)
We 'gon stay the same way (About us) Never will we ever change
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Hold up, checkmate king me (Yeah!)
L.O.X. see the treasure that it bring me (Ah!)
Uh! Firfty large in the carry on
You ain't reach our level yet ca-ca-ca-carry on (Carry on)
Ha! One hit wonderama
Then you grow out of them niggas like your old pajamas (I remember them)
Talk about us on your lil' block (Go 'head)
She can't call so she text while she suckin cock (Suckin cock)
I don't give a fuck of what your hood say
You barely made a hundred dollars on a good day (That's it)
Always keep the metal on my hip (WHATTUP?!)
But my hand and feet work is even bet it don't trip
HAAAA!!!!!

[Chorus: Dyce Payne]
They 'gon say the same thing (About us) It's always been the same thing (About us)
We 'gon stay the same way (About us) Never will we ever change
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Uh! Royalty at it's finest (Yes!)
Might as well address me as your highness
Loyalty bars pure flyness (Fly)
We been the same way since we was minors
Day one respect from the jump start (Jump)
For the fact we pump hardthen dump hard (Dump)
Straight from the palace to the junkyard (Yep)
Alot of times a king is your Trump card (WOO!)
All eyes on hustle 'til the pies gone (Hustle)
Integrity is somethin we can't compromise on
Never change the three letter acronym
L.O.X. the streets still backin 'em
Three kings!

[Chorus: Dyce Payne]
They 'gon say the same thing (About us) It's always been the same thing (About us)
We 'gon stay the same way (About us) Never will we ever change
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!
You fuckin with the three kings! You fuckin with the three kings!
