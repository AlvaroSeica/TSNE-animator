(Intro, DJ Paul)
Yeaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!
Hypnotize Minds!
Three 6 Mafia!
It's goin down (Goin down)
We da reason why them V.I.P's in the club!
Ya know I'm sayin?
Lookin good, feelin good, smellin good
The broads choosin
And these haters cruisin for a bruisin!
And they can get it, for real!

(Hook, DJ Paul)
I said I look
I look, I look
I look, I look
I look, I look (Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!)
I look, I look
I look, I feel, I smell like money
I look, I feel, I smell like money
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down
Get a good look at me dummy
I said I look, I feel, I smell like money
I look I feel, I smell like money
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down
Get a good look at me dummy

(Verse 1, DJ Paul)
Once again it's on
Or should I say my eyes on
Back on the stove
I'm somethin' like a Amero
The way I make it twerk
I got some good work
I'm into Culinary
See me on the Food Network
Smilin' in her ear
With a 'gar in my mouth
In the V.I.P.
Man we standin on the couch
And I got a whole lotta lock-jaw women
But it's too bad half already in me
Clownin, doin donuts in the Charger wit' a Hemi
Comin down ya block like
Vroom-vroom, do ya hea' me?
Headed to the club
You can catch me in the powder room
When I'm in the hood
I'm in that trap bangin that boom-boom, boy!

(Hook, DJ Paul)
I said I look
I look, I look
I look, I look
I look, I look (Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!)
I look, I look
I look, I feel, I smell like money
I look, I feel, I smell like money
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down
Get a good look at me dummy
I said I look, I feel, I smell like money
I look I feel, I smell like money
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down
Get a good look at me dummy

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
Everyday I keep a buzz
From the kush and sticky rush
Man we just a bad influence
Maybe you should hang with us
Passin pipes and rollin dice
Nigga flowin wit' no ice
Smoke so much, I got the munchies
Mayn, I need some shrimp fried-rice
Tryin'ta stay up on my toes
Laughin' from the clover rolls
People askin' stupid questions (Why ya playin' wit'cha nose?)
Foo, we keep a party packed
Full of drink and apple-jacks
Stuffed off in the plastic sack
So my nig, remember that
We be up all night
Maybe from the all white
Til' the morning sun-light
Keep my eyes all bright
Even though I'm rollin
And dollars un-foldin
I'm paranoid as hell
Cause the police patrolin

(Hook, DJ Paul)
I said I look
I look, I look (Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!)
I look, I look
I look, I feel, I smell like money
I look, I feel, I smell like money
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down
Get a good look at me dummy
I said I look, I feel, I smell like money
I look I feel, I smell like money
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down
Get a good look at me dummy

I said I
I said I
I said I
