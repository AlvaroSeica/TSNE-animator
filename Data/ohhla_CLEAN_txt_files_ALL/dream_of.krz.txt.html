Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, and they told about the capital games, venom
Will they be if they in shackles and chains, sen' 'em
Off to battle by Catherine to the grave summer
'Til the gates await for one soul murder
Women livin' in sin killed the children
The squad producin' to pop the pills in
It's all confusions, are not solutions
I'm topin' up the plot to drop stop the blueprint
If anything's ever gonna get better we gotta get rid of the vendettas
And suffer in our endeavors
Don't the king that build this legend
Never ever step on the huffle one another
Be stubborn enough to hate one another
Remember that we are brothers
And since the scheme from the same mother
The earth and we go through the same struggles
It hurts when we gotta make it work for us

What are we fightin' for?
And why do we sell war?
All my country tears me brief
Scream our needs and all our grief
And those who scream want peace
The secret dream, the king of kings

In the UK mama had a itty bitty lil boy prue
With a man that wasn't like quite likely approved
Walked around Cape Town, ready for the abuse
Cause the color of the skin was so difficult to few
Not dark enough, not white enough
Hey boy, what be your background anyway?
Is there really an answer to this type of a cancer?
Human beings what my pop said we'd better save
Now speedin' up the days on the countdown
Present day is a race, better stop high
Get up and get your freedom to love one another
My brother suffered from the fuckers underneath the plot now
Now push here and just limit the true clears of the nigga men initiative
Like the fear of traditionally ignorant
And let your guard down with the stitch you are member with

What are we fightin' for?
And why do we sell war?
All my country tears me brief
Scream our needs and all our grief
And those who scream want peace
The secret dream, the dream of a king

Come on God, we see the one in size
But we steady reachin' for the climax of a earthly high?
We love the money and sex more from the grace from the sky
Cravin' a plan for someone to save me
Could he be real? Feelin' me?
Or should I look to the heaven?
I can see my sanity in a world of profanity
Temptation at a all time high
Women, minister, does their pry
Avoidin' the questions, tryin' to survive
Maybe yet we should just die

Even kings fall
Sunset on my back bringin' in the dark
I ain't always even killed, tryna gain a lil' balance for real
Because I've been lost
Played grand politics for the kids
That's how it is
Innocence lost to a Mosberg kiss
What it is and what it was, plus it ain't getting better for us
Life's worse and enough on the high when the cops speed by
Someone told me about a dream that my son is alive
So I told him to run it back but he didn't reply
You see they all oughta wait dyin' than close the high
And the world's getting smaller, yes it is
That's the world real like, break it to doctors, the shame that parts us
But I got American
Pain follows illusion my friend</pre>
