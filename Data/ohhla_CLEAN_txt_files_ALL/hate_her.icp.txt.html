Song:   Hate Her to Death
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I fucking hate her to death
I fucking hate her to death

She's incredible, unforgettable, undeniable, breath taking
Furious, she's so mysterious, I'm curious
Earth shaking

She's always right every time
I fucking hate her to death
She gives me sight even though I'm blind
I fucking hate her to death

She's always saving my life
But she don't belong to me
She tells me things are alright,
But she don't belong to me
I try to follow her light
But she don't belong to me
I feel her venomous bite,
'Cause she don't belong to me

She's funny
She's shinning
She's happy
I fucking hate her to death
She's caring
She's fun
She's smiling
I fucking hate her to death

I want you off this planet
I fucking hate her to death
You don't want me and I just can't stand it
I fucking hate her to death

I fucking hate her to death

She's unbelievable, unachievable, inconceivable, breath taking,
She's incredible, unforgettable, unregrettable,
Earth shaking

I see her wings and halo often
I fucking hate her to death
I'd be happy with her in a coffin
I fucking hate her to death

She makes the pain go away
But she don't belong to me
She makes the awful okay
But she don't belong to me
She brings the light to my day
But she don't belong to me
And then she just goes away
'Cause she don't belong to me

She's funny
She's shinin'
She's happy
I fucking hate her to death
She's caring
She's fun
She's smilin'
I fucking hate her to death

I want you off this planet
I fucking hate her to death
You don't want me and I just can't stand it
I fucking hate her to death

I want you off this planet
I fucking hate her to death
You don't want me and I just can't stand it
I fucking hate her to death

I fucking hate her to death

She's funny
She's shinin'
She's happy
I fucking hate her to death
She's caring
She's fun
She's smilin'
I fucking hate her to death

I want you off this planet
I fucking hate her to death
You don't want me and I just can't stand it
I fucking hate her to death

She's smilin'
She's happy
She's funny
I fucking hate her to death
She's smilin'
She's happy
She's happy
I fucking hate her to death</pre>
