[Chorus]
Jus do it, jus do it
Jus do it do it do it
Jus do it, rock to it
Put your hands up high and move it

[KJ-52]
Sometimes I flow weird throw verbal Spears like Briteny
That literally goes from here to Houston jus like Whiteny
Battle me, ya kiddin me, ya funny cat
I bet 50 Cents for Eminems ya wont get a Nickel Back
The track I'm rippin it really aint that hard
See Jesus gives Destiny to every Child of God
Im battle scared kind of raw, what do you think
No matter race, religion, or the color or the Creed
If ya black, brown, or Pink, or in or out of Sync
Or hang wit Beasties Boys, jus on the Backstreet
You can live in Linkin Park, no matter jus to me
See the Prince of Peace is guaranteed to give ya what ya need [2x]

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
One day these peeps were goin past me
Walkin wit a Limp eatin Bizkits they hair was Shaggy
What's your name is the question that I'm askin
I'm Micheal, she's Celine, She's Dion, He's Jackson
That Ricky, that's Martin, that's Tony, that's Braxton
Dru is on a Hill chillin and relaxin
Alicia lost her Keys and she's really kind of sad and
I said you too? I said No Doubt I know how that be happenin
But I need all the Dixie Chicks jus to gather in
And let me explain jus the reason now why I'm rappin and
So I told Mariah, He Carried my sin and He died for me
My Faith is in Christ who on a Hill called Calvary
Gave His life on for mine so Genuine I tried to be
If the world tries to stop me, I'll Rage Against the Machine
So turn ya raido up, head to the spot
Get loose like Slipknot, watch the Kid Rock

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
My Uncle was eatin Korn on a Kracker all alone
It was 98 Degrees out and he was Counting Crows
And it was jus then when my Papa he jus saw a Roach
He dropped his Red Hot Chilli Peppers and then he ran home
And jus went and called up John the Mayor on the phone
It's a 311 3 Doors Down, now dont be slow
But he was like wait a second hold up a minute bro
Before I Usher over there is something you should know
Jesus is the firm rock, not a Rollin Stone
Wit Him Heaven not Nirvana is where you'll go
I'll tried to show and let you know but your Third Eye is Blind
So you need to open them up real wide
And even if you have to Blink 182 times
Its so Obvious, that it cant hide
TLC, tender love and care He'll provide
From girls to Boys to Men need to let Him inside</pre>
