[Intro: Sharecka (Self Rachet)]
Miss, come on (yeah) Yup (yo)
New and improved (Recka) Yeah
(Yeah, Self Rachet) Nothing but music (Gotta love it)

[Self Rachet]
Yo, excuse me lil' mama, I ain't trying to be rude
Just got my click off the ground, I ain't trying to be sued
Plus there's a million other bitches that been eyeing me, boo
Add you and your cousin, that's a million and two
Now what you wan' do? You wan' tear up the club?
You wan' forget about ya problems? You wan' go home and what?
You like to what, huh? I ain't tough to please
Pretty grill, banging body with some cute ass feet
Roll with three to four girls cuz we 56 deep
Call my niggaz my ninjas cuz we know how to creep
You like pearly white sand, fresh, straight off the beach
I'm like pot holes, smart apartment with big leaks
It was destiny for us to meet and it's first for us to speak
Come talk about this, is this ya party? Is this ya birthday week?
I know how to read between lines, you was talking to me
Oh, you pulling an all nighter? Then you fucking with me

[Sharecka]
Come on, yeah, uh...
Yeah, wooo, come on, come on, yeah, mami...
Now you my pride and joy, my future wife
I'ma let you take up my whole life, keeping it so tight
Feeling is so right, taking trips every weekend, living the good life
Shorty you got it, I'll take you out of the projects
Give you a great book, let them Gods twist ya face upon ya bank book
Girl look, everything you be dreaming of you could get it
House, trucks, big whips, baby we been did it
Tailor designed, fitted, showing ya shape well
When you walk through the block, shorty, it shake well
Getting hate from other chicks, hoping we don't sell
It's just, wish they could be in ya shoes, they sell
Taking luxury cruises, mad cuz we be moving
Trying to do exactly what we doing
And I ain't never gon' ever gon' change on you
Because, you so beautiful... look...

[Timbo King]
Yo, I'ma walk in, yo, yeah, better walk in
Yo, yo, yo, I need a Queen sister soldier like Betty Shabazz
On some, Angela Davis, she ready to blast
Read books to the seeds when I take out the trash
Cooks with herbs, my ebony, Pocahontas
She the baddest since Vanity, and her bedroom eyes match the canopy
Yeah, (uh) me and you ma', table for two, a room for three
Yeah, you thinking what I'm thinking? Fuck it, let's explore that
Being that Don that I am, charmed, she looking at the tat on my arm
Infinite, no beginning or ending, perhaps we should just start fucking... (Yeah)</pre>
