Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Not even they can stop me now
What have the flying all ahead
And every words can bring me down
What happen [?] from the day day day

Kim cargo when shells and wells Fargo
Laughing waiting to go cash this with draw-wards
My chick bad with class she been shop though
Name bround horse she worse than malo
Great choco four pipe gelado
Dark low hoodie on like fuck colado
For trade barn I'm strapped with ney palm
Running the biggest bank like this won't take long
We don't want your money we're coming for straight bar
So stay calm no O spray for spray all
So bug off get rapped off
My chuck soft drugs and car plus long
Chuck Porsche meet em Bugatta with drug loss
Discuss soft speaking the powdery much more
Niggas at when they sign deals
Rent to the dealer for the same knocking resign field
I got a lawyer that's corrupted like car field
Go to calido way it's a month that you [?] still
Trapping back on my mind still drunk at the table
As I make the battle or whine spill
Fresh of my high haters, high haters
Reckless when I bust around [?] later
Only square you ever bought was now later
Once you buzzin the whole's coming vibrator

And then the dreams can drill somehow
Passed what I chase underlie was dead
I heard the streets were faithless gone
Passed where my father said

Cossie on some new shit made it from breaking two bricks
Bosses take losses and working just make excuses
Every verse is exclusive, every word is abusive
Playing dirt if you use it
Get the bur you can move it
That's what I'm about nigga
Crib on the mountain
I'm so far like a couch nigga
Crack this G spot a temple sense to the house nigga
Get on your shit I'm the rapper spit on
New bound slippers my chillin smoke jacket
Niggas don't wanna get money they got a broke habit
Got a toe habit automatic is a low fabric
You had a shot it was too late no basket
The strip driny way work rapping the [?] second when you bustin the check first
The second she fussing I'll be under the next skirt
Network flew me the Mexico the connect dirt
Left the [?] took the marina
The surrender corner can overlook the arena
No no [?] diva selene bag on the [?] Jeremy how I did it
She live single Regina
She's remember who's [?] for your ride you'd better know who you rolling with
No need to hide out as long as you appropriate
Balling he might the foe five you approaching with
Shit

And then the dreams can drill somehow
Passed what I chase underlie was dead
I heard the streets were faithless gone
Passed where my father said</pre>
