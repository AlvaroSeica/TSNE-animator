(Intro, Juicy J)
Strippers!
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance

(Hook x2, Juicy J)
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin pussy; I'm Just poppin bandz
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin; And they ain't usin hands

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Short hair like Nia Long
Lose one, she don't need a loan
She start twerkin' when she hear a song
Stripper pole; her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she roll it...
She put that ass off in my hands; I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone
After K-O-D, she leave with me
She got friends; Bring three
I got drugs; I got drank
Bend it over; Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy; Juicy J cain't
Racks err'where; They showin racks, I'm throwin racks
In the V-I-P; Rubber on, I'm stretchin that
Rich niggas tippin; Broke niggas lookin
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin pussy

(Hook x2, Juicy J)
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin pussy; I'm Just poppin bandz
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin; And they ain't usin hands

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
Down in Atlanta; Bout to hit up magic (You know it)
Throw some money in the air; All the bad bitches gon' grab it
Scrape off the floor; She gon need a couple of bags (Mmhmmm)
Like a broke ATM; I'm spillin all this cash (Yeah, ho!)
Them niggas in the club don't be spendin shit (Yeah, ho!)
Twenty stacks in one night; I be on trippy shit (Yeah, ho!)
My cribs paid off (Always)
But I'm still payin rent (Always) (Yeah, ho!)
A couple of condo's paid; She lovin err' cent (Yeah, ho!)
She make that ass clap; Dancin like she on the dick (Ho!)
Bring it back, I threw a stack; That's a lucky bitch (Ho!)
Up and down she go, when she slidin on that pole (You know it!)
Makin money, stackin them hundreds; Shawty cold (Wooo!)

(Hook x2, Juicy J)
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin pussy; I'm Just poppin bandz
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin; And they ain't usin hands</pre>
