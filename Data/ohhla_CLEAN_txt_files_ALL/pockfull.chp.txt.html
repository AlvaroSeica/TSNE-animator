[Chorus]
Pocket full of dough
Closet full of clothes
And everywhere I go you know that all the hoes
Know I'm getting money, I be gettin money
Everywhere the money go you know I'm gonna go

[Verse 1]
I just seen your bitch looking at me
This where she supposed to be
Damn she got them buns
Her stomach F L A T
She saw me pull up and seen passenger seat empty
She approached a G began to choose very quickly
Girl you know when I'm on
Don't wait too long
To let me know you down
Blink twice Ill be gone
Checker print bags in the back seat
She told me lean my seat back then she attacked me
A couple of her girlfriends want me too
She ain't trippin we just livin this life until we through
Matter fact her and like five more chicks is coming through
And they know when they come through they gotta cum too
Lets just do whatever I want to
Anything you need on me but damn they got some funds too
Yeah, we gon have some fun boo
Magnums we gon run through

[Chorus x2]
Pocket full of dough
Closet full of clothes
And everywhere I go you know that all the hoes
Know I'm getting money, I be gettin money
Everywhere the money go you know I'm gonna go

[Verse 2]
Baby girl roll up some of that tree
Gone and get like me
In a whip parked on the street
Right outside C L U B
Windows blacked out niggas tryna look in but they cant see
Haters only try to go against what they cant be
I'm moving on up in the game
All the hoes know my name
Thousands for the jeans
All black everything aint know stains
A nigga don't rock no chains
Might see four or five rings
See this goat on swole
Black diamonds in this thang
Gotta brand new whip off rap
New crib on the West Coast
These hoes want a nigga like me cuz I'm overseas doin the most
Honey mustard leather couches in my studio
Wish your bitch'd stop callin but she got dat booty tho
We in other countries, spending other money
Euros and pounds you can keep that US money
Got a plan in life I'm good
Mercedes got leather with the wood
Just got back to the US now I'm ridin around my hood with a

[Chorus x2]
Pocket full of dough
Closet full of clothes
And everywhere I go you know that all the hoes
Know I'm getting money, I be gettin money
Everywhere the money go you know I'm gonna go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we livin this life
Don't give a fuck how you feel
We livin this shit for real
We all around the world
We got these girls
If you really livin put the champagne to the sky right now man
I want you to grab the baddest bitch you see walking past

If you don't give a fuck put them drinks up
If you never gave a fuck put them drinks up
We hustlin
Yeah
East side, west side, north side, south side
Europe, Australia, Brazil, Africa, we got ya

[Chorus]
Pocket full of dough
Closet full of clothes
And everywhere I go you know that all the hoes
Know I'm getting money, I be gettin money
Everywhere the money go you know I'm gonna go

Pocket full of dough
Everywhere I go</pre>
