[Verse 1: Louis Logic]
Yo
When the lights go out in a psycho's house
It's cos I don't wanna be seen slicin the white hoe's blouse
Down the back before I inspect the skin
And slice two down insections in another bitch's pressured flesh again
Police dream of arresting him, Buffalo Bill
Agent Starling even shot him but there's some you don't kill
Not with man-made guns and knives, cos once he dies
You turn your back on him and he comes alive for one more try
Run and hide if you must
But I'm in the shrubs outside of ya house pushing ya bedroom window up
So when you burst through the frontdoor tonight
I'll be the crazy jerk who's in persuit screaming 'RUN FOR YA LIFE'
You can pump up your nikes and reeboks
And hike your kneesocks and run like you're Steve Austin
I'll catch you, no getaways from Jason the Leatherface
The guy who keeps marchin like he's sleepwalking

[Chorus: *cut and scratched by the DJ*](2x)
'Rip off all your flesh and make a outfit'
