Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hmm...Tech N9ne!

[Tech in sing-song voice]
Smashes, the masses, but the industry's hatin' asses

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Strange days, when your favorite rapper's popping
But is he on top of something you can't gauge
Especially when he's topping the charts
And you see me, K. Lamar, and Macklemore sharin' the same stage
I'm the nigga all these artists look up to
Yes, the Tech has been the hardest to bust through
But I keep my fans fiendin' like clucks do
You don't like how we live it, well...
I dominate, your conglomerate, what a beating I can accommodate
It'll be a non-debate, coming up against Aaron the Great
So many got arms, legs and necks tatted
Strange cause Music show conceptually I'm the best at it
Let's have it, for all of these Tech addicts
Any disrespect to family will get your chest gatted
Aimin' at 'em and its agony
Burner blew his brain in, back and these
Cannons came in, caved in cavity, caliber, connect, cap it
Yo, there it go
Red is in my head, it grow
Headed fo'
Let em, dead it, yea the medic, said it so
Let it grow
Shred it and get no credit
So pathetic though
Dreading that it steppin' in heaven's crevice, wettin' edible
Give her the shivers when I deliver this
Hit her then quit her cause she's on Twitter shit
And when she compare me to Eminem I said
I'm different, she said how, I said I'm black and I can say nigger bitch!
To him I may just be another bro with a flow
Will probably never tour cause it'll be thousands of Juggalos at a show
And I heard fatalities happen on each side
So there's never no let it go
So I get it, I keep what I'm makin' incredible
All of them scared of a nigga tho
Strangeulation, this occupations so scand'lous
We stopped the hatin', no chances
When I rock the nation so damn sick
I'm killing all these niggas
Operation Code Kansas
Strange gang playin' triggered assassins
Got a bunch of untamed, aim, trained spitters are blastin'
My insane brain sayin' give up the rappin'
And go back to the gang bang thang, nigga what's ha'ennin', soo-woo</pre>
