[Hook-Billy Cook]
Father please forgive me for what I'm about to do
but the pressure lately takin'me out my cool
I tryed to chill but they keep on speakin my name
so now they bout to get interested to my pain
Momma please forgive me for what I'm about to do
if the Drama start I never meant to hurt you
but if everybody keep on fuckin with me
on everything I love I'm not gon'let 'em be

Drama keep calling me-Drama keep calling my phone
I told them to let me be-it is what, it is so let's get it on
Drama keep calling me-Drama keep calling my phone
I told them to let me be-it is what, it is so let's get it on

[Verse 1-Trae]
Drama callin'I guess I gotta give it to 'em without stallin
everybody wanna know what I'm haulin
inside of my chest-inside of my head but it ain't no phony
godamn what you wanna go and fuck with Trae fo'
alittle bit of fame but it ain't gon' pay hoe
now you gon'feel how the fuck I feel ain't nobody finna move till I say so
they say you wanna know about Trae and Doug who is T-Ray? nigga it's the Maab
it's Trae ready from the S.U.C stay ridin his dick must be ya big job
it's Trae and Z-Ro we the kinfolk I think y'all require too much info
niggaz say that I turned my back, that's falsified and him and I both know
Dinkie told me not to feed the fans and what's fam is fam and stick to the plan
but everywhere that I go niggaz say I cap-and they speak on shit they don't understand
want every be no more Guerilla Maab if you step up to me I'll be solo maab

right about now I'm about to blow and kick ass nigga I done had it
so don't you come with no hoe ass shit this young asshole finna let you have it

[Verse 2-Trae]
They say they know about Trae who the fuck lied to them
cause everyday that I breathe I'll be forced to live
and forcing no slugs to protect myself, I'm a asshole I ain't got nothin to give
I've got nothin to lose, get these blues
some of these niggaz don't wanna pay dues
I hope they buckle up they belt
cause it's finna get rough 1 of these niggaz finna get bruised
why you start it if you ain't want the beef
you got plex you really don't want no teeth
these Silvaback girls come on dogg
you better get ya weight up before you fuck with me
cause I'll maab on a nigga-swung on a nigga
hit ya block up to harm me a nigga
put 'em in a figure 4 and get raw with a nigga
put 'em in a box so they don't find that nigga
everybody wanna hate me like I changed
said the hot block since I got fame
but I know one thing they better get they bitch ass
the fuck from round me cause I got aim
so I'm back again-I got a pack of men
I pull up in a black 'Lac with a back again
cause these cats don't know how to act again
Trae they attitude off track again
so what you niggaz hatin on if it's the crime you gon' be waiting long
cause day after day it's gonna be takin on, I put it on leak and the 4's I'm skatin on
I promise you don't really wanna take it there and I advise you for this
ain't too many finna be too many finna be after this
cause these bitch niggaz done got me pissed
