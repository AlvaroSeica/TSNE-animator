[Talking]
Caught up
Dirty Game
Nigga I deal wit it though, you know
Shit aint easy out there on them streets boy, you know
Y'all niggaz watch yo ass boy, hold it down, fo'sho

[Chorus]
They got me down but it aint no thang
When I hit the streets gotta let my nuts hang
Got a nigga cased over so much game
And everybody goin through the same ole thang x2

[JT Money]
What up dogg hope you chillin cuz I aint
I wish I could be out with the boys but I cant
I really dont know what kinda time a nigga facin
Cant get a bond cuz I aint cooperatin
So ima strap down they gone take me for a ride
You'll look out for my shit while a nigga on the inside
Been here before so it really aint shit
You'll let me know what's goin on in the streets and whats sum flix
Probably get a buzz when I think you got this letter
Shit is at it's worse and it can only get better
I be holla'n at my lawyer and he be tryin to work su'um
But I aint copin out shit cuz they aint got nothin
Just maintain'n here waitin for a court date
Dont need no loot becuz my commecery straight
And give a wussup to the boys 'round the way
Im shootin you this kite on the 9th day of May
My dogg had a b-day I hope his shit was straight
But when I hit the streets it'll be to late to celebrate
Just hold the fort down cuz your boy gone be alright
Right now im doin 500 pushups e'vrynite
My shit be on tight feelin like my shit gone burst
And im lock down on nigga merc from off the turf
That nigga dats jus (???) tell the boys peace
A couple otha niggaz we know from off the street
I would say they names but you prolly wouldnt know em
But I bet chu'd recognize these cats if you saw em
We got shit locked so you know your dogg straight
I'll write you page 2 when we take a smoke break nigga wut

[Chorus]
They got me down but it aint no thang
When I hit the streets gotta let my nuts hang
Got a nigga cased over so much game
And everybody goin through the same ole thang x2

[JT Money]
Yea boy nigga back afta I smoked 1
And this FD fuckin C shit aint no joke son
They have a nigga locked down all day 
And the only outside a nigga see is the hallway
No bitchez 
You know da ones they got on the streets in pictures
The whole thing operatin on snitchez, witchez 
Why I dont talk bout mah case
You nosey ass niggaz tryin to be up in a nigga'z face
Muthafuckaz better back off me
These niggaz try to act soft, (???) in they rooms tryin to jackoff
Poor fucka run around and catch a new charge
To many niggaz flaw talkin bout how dey live large
And to use the fone it be a long line
But I just whup oneofdez wannabes down b4 they fone time
Cuz ima be here alot more days
And aint nothin up in this thang but niggaz and o-yay's
And a couple crackaz who robbed banks
Da otha day my nigga swallowed some balloons and got a nigga dank
We was gettin all serious on the rec y'all
Gotta be careful cuz them guards be sweatin hard
Or them jealous ass gramps might snitch
So ya gotta break em a lil picture get shook down
These muthafuckas out to keep me
But im shill cuz I still my ole girl weekly
Wit my lil sisters and my 2 kids
But im out boy I gotta do this bid im holla though
catch y'all niggaz on the turf

[Chorus]
They got me down but it aint no thang
When I hit the streets gotta let my nuts hang
Got a nigga cased over so much game
And everybody goin through the same ole thang x2

[JT Money]
Boy I cant wait to get up out this shit
This muthafuckin institution life's a bitch
Police tell you when to eat and sleep
Shit jus creep a nigga miss the streets
Always get strip searched right out the vizo
Lost that right cuz I slapped up my hizo
Fuck that nigga aint about dis shit
A nigga gotta stay the fuck out this bitch
Know what im sayin

[Chorus]
They got me down but it aint no thang
When I hit the streets gotta let my nuts hang
Got a nigga cased over so much game
And everybody goin through the same ole thang (4X)</pre>
