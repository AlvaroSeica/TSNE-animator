Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Hands in the air
Presidents, prime ministers
They said that we didn't care
But that isn't fair

Hands in the air
Presidents, prime ministers
They said that we didn't care
But we're the circle in the square

[Chorus (x4)]
Up, hands in the air
Presidents, prime ministers
They said that we didn't care
We're the circle in the square

[Verse 1: Jonny 5]
The time is now, our time has come
We show them how, what can't be done
No matter what they say or they don't say
We make a way out of no way
Against the gun, beneath the veil
Yes we can, too big to fail
We are the ones we're waiting for
We save ourselves; Praise the lord

[Brer Rabbit]
We are sly and the family
Stone in calamity
Triumph when thrown to the domes
Of these Goliaths
Planted seeds in silence
And granted meek compliance
And in the spring rain exploded in a riot
Of color and excitement
Wearing no disguises
Declaring to the stars that we trek like enterprises
Of candlelight revivals and how we lift the blindfolds
We end in Revelation, like it was the Bible

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jonny 5]
We are the circle in the squee-are
We beathe air the same as the ones who didn't prepare
Don't be scared
Whatever time it was when you began
The clock is now 11:55 on the big hand
So you're invited into the circle that we sleep in
Invited to depend on friendships we deepen
To uncover the secrets in the [breath] that we're bleepin
The treasures maps we pretend we do not believe in
Show us how to

Party at the protest, Rally like a rockstar
Yaya, yaya, allahu akbar
Do svidaniya Ego Foster all the people
El pueblo unido, jamas sera vencido

Party at the protest, Rally like a rockstar
Yaya, yaya, allahu akbar
Do svidaniya Ego Foster all the people
El pueblo unido, jamas sera vencido

[Brer Rabbit]
We are the night light bearers for night terrors
We are group dreamers, vision seekers and pall bearers
In aftermath of blight errors, blood type and marrow to the bone oaths
And beat hope into plow shares
We're balancing the balance beam
Pulling strings from battle scene tapestries
And ravenous advocates for smaller teams
Pop the bubbles of crystal schemes
We are the sleep walkers for stalled dreams

[Chorus]</pre>
