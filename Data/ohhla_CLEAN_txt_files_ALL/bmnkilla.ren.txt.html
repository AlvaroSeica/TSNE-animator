Typed by: SALTR1N@aol.com

1995 and Compton's still up in this motherfucker
Yeah, this album's dedicated to all you real niggaz
But most of all it's dedicated to you bitch ass niggaz

[MC Ren]
Who is it? The bitch made nigga killa
I'm swingin' on niggaz ever time I feel 'em
Cause niggaz walkin' 'round with their ass out
So I'll be droppin' funky shit till they pass out
These bitch made niggaz swingin' on the dick
Back the fuck up before I have a fit
I'm peelin' niggaz caps, makin' gang of snaps
Be true to this shit with hard motherfuckin' raps
187 bitch slappin' on the track
Makin' fools break theyself like as if it was a jack
Keep a big stick just incase I gotta swing
The heater is the mack, stashed at the shack
So while your rollin Danas in your force mobile
Just remember motherfuckers the shit caps I peel
Niggaz just a piece of cheese for a hood rat
Falsin' for a hooker and I never understood that
Cause it's the same old shit everyday and every night
Cause nigga Ren won't put it down if the shit ain't tight
So listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to a bitch made nigga, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Chorus: Cold 187Um]
You know the color, the villain is in black -&gt; MC Ren
Bitch made niggaz better watch they backs, hooker
You know the color, the villain is in black -&gt; MC Ren
Beatin' niggaz down and it's like that, fool

You know the color, the villain is in black -&gt; MC Ren
Bitch made niggaz better watch they backs, hooker
You know the color, the villain is in black -&gt; MC Ren
Beatin' niggaz ass and it's like that

[MC Ren]
And I'm stalkin', walkin' in my khaki suit
Tryin' to see what niggaz I'm a have to shoot
This ain't a bang-bang boogie like the new booty flow
New niggaz tryin' to do the shit I did years ago
Cause if it ain't rough it ain't E-motherfuckin' nuff
You bitch made niggaz, here to call your bluff
Pull your hoe card, like my nigga Kam said
Crack my big stick up against your damn head
Yeah, radio suckas never play me
But you can hear bitch made niggaz on daily
Ren gonna have to put his foot down
Motherfuckers ain't gonna like how it's put down
So mic check one, whatever I don't give a damn
Me be ready to slam, when I hit the jam
So yell controversy when I bust the rhyme
No more irresistible bitch made niggaz in '99
Black reign is coming, niggaz it's bad weather
Whenever 187 and Ren get together
And listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to these bitch made niggaz, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Chorus]

[MC Ren]
Hypocrite niggaz always runnin' they mouth
From the north, to the east, to the west, and south
Cause the freaks come out at night
And all bitch made niggaz be comin' cause they don't have no friends
So don't come around playin' double-O 7
Cause your ass might get caught in a two-eleven
Niggaz don't call me 'less the video is poppin'
Only come around when my new shit's droppin'
Niggaz ain't nothin' but some hound dogs I betcha
You bitch made niggaz didn't know that I was the bitch catcher
I'll choke ya with a grip
Stranglin' motherfuckers not comin correct, so don't slip
Real niggaz don't die, so I'm still alive
Fuckin' up shit in '94 and '95
Cause I'm livin' like a hustler
Busta, heard you was talkin' that shit so ya musta
Thought it wouldn't get back to me
Niggaz ya shoulda thought a million times before you tried to do me
But listen to this funk as I deal a
Blow to you bitch made niggaz, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

You know the color, the villain's in black</pre>
