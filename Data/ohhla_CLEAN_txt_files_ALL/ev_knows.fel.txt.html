[Toker]
Sabes que
It's thief
It's thief like a motherfucker
From the 213 all the way to S.V.

[Verse 1: A.L.T.]
Now it's been said that eses are deep
And not only in way side, but out on the street
And somebody gotta represent, it's got to be
The best O.G.Enius and me, fuck the rest
It's the G-Spot, fool, I gotta stay true
It's me, A.L.T. stayin' west up too and
You
Better not trip
You better not slip, A.K. with a .30 shot clip
Banana, Tony smoke cigars from Havana
From L.A., and all the way out to Alabama
But that's it, because the east ain't on the agenda
Roll me some indica, that's what I'm into
A Mexican thang, but y'all can be down
Because finally, someone came through for the brown
Walk a straight line and you won't get stuck
It's that G-Spot for life, fool, so don't fuck up

Chorus: A.L.T.
G-Spot's the clique that I represent
You see, it's all about making them presidents
I put my gat in the air and I wave it around
Because we stompin' in the Nikes and we all creased down
Plus, my, crew, don't
Give a fuck, and if they do, they get stuck
We makin' shit move like pounds of ki's
Because everybody knows them G-Spot G's

[Verse 2: Nino Brown]
Now it's about time for the new era
And my people, got to take care of
So I can't stop, won't stop, and they wonder
Who's that brown-skinned brother
Rollin' with that G-Spot click
Comin' with another east side hit
Represent the city where I come from
Throw your set like dum, ditty-dum
Mic check, watch me get wrecked
M-E-X, I-C-A-N, fool
Keep popping that lip, I'm a trip
Then I'm a go search for another clip
Hip, hop, bounce, what
Through the avenues and we can't stop
G-Spot motherfucker til I die

Repeat Chorus

[Toker]
Ha ha
Simon, this is Toker from the Brownside
And you listening to these locos kick it off for the real eastsiders
So fuck it off, ese

(Verse 3)
[A.L.T.]
I'm juiced up like a six-four on a Sunday
Sittin' on T's, hittin' corners, bumpin' one way
Because this Mexican is known to slang
I got every thing ridin' on my G-Spot gang
It's like that
Plus I got a big black gat
And a little red dot on your New York hat, fool
Hey G.Enius, peep out the plan
I put the nine in the clip, and the shells up in your hand

[Nino Brown]
Hey yo, G
Homey, how we fin' to put it down
We stayin' true, all the way brown
So what, stick the funk back, who's the mack
With the beast O.G., hit the G track
I'm a get 'em up, so west up, fool
Now you can't funk with the crew, when the
It feels so good, from the hood
For my people, like I knew we should

Repeat Chorus

[Toker]
That's right, you heard it
But from Mexicans
You like it, bump it
If you don't, fuck you
You'll see us any fuckin' way</pre>
