[Intro]
Pack it up..
..what the fuck~?!
(Did you get that?)

[Evidence]
I started my day great, don't hate what I do 
Instead get a plate, heh, don't hate my food for thought 
Don't wait, don't watch {"don't hate"} what I got
Even if it's not what I wanted to view (okay)
I'm first up to crack the blinds {"don't hate"}
Racin time, in fact I love to smoke la-la-la
They couldn't tell me nada, so I burned it up hot as the sun
and came back a product of my environment's done

[Defari]
Yeah, yeah, {"don't hate"} the maker, the car
They international - AH! Don't hate the actual star
Killer than me and E-V? (Nope!) No question
It's obvious, the homies are prosperous
Watch them study and follow this (follow us)
Got love {"don't hate"} where I'm at
I never left, I holla, "Don't hate, hit me back"
And now you seem bothered, don't hate, I'm runnin today
I'm switchin my gates in London at 8

[Evidence]
One of the greats, passports stamped up, don't hate 
Wait a minute, listen, record spinnin, {"don't hate"}
I-I play the game well, lanes change course
Don't make the Change of the Guard
My pen is like I'm in the pen far bangin these bars
Back from the yard, small glimpse, don't hate freedom (no)
Eyes lock you in so I stay at the beaches
Fake chicks and leeches, I still {"don't hate"}
I let 'em off, yellow car, then it's back to relate

[Defari]
Burn one before the wake up call 
{"Don't hate"} the rise and the fall, I outlast 'em all
Don't hate the neighbor next door, I'm glad that she saw
Don't hate the tree that he rolled, the bag that he bought
The blunt that we blew, the courtesy call
YEAH~! Don't hate the live that I'm livin
The gift I've been givin, don't hate the love for my children
I'm wheelin and dealin, don't hate, the man is just grown
He does for his own, he rest on the throne

[Chorus: DJ Revolution cuts and scratches]
"I got mine, so-" {"don't hate"}
"I got mine, so-" {"don't hate"}
"I got mine, so-" {"don't hate"}
(Don't hate these haters at all)
"I got mine, so I show no shame"
