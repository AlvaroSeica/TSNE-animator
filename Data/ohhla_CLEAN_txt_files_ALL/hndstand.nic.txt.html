[Intro]
"Da Aphilliates nigga, holla at your boy"
I know why you fuck with me Nicki, knahmsayin?
(HOLIDAY SEASON!) Cause we got the same type of shit in common
We like to get money (PAY CLOSE, FUCKIN ATTENTION)

[Nicki Minaj]
We like them boys with them rubber band bands
He-he-he-he-he move weight, keep a couple gram grams
So-so-so-so where your money, put it in your hand hands
Now-now-now-now-now make it flip, make it do a handstand

[Interlude]
I want y'all to count my money, got a paper pile and shit
(TRAPAHOLICS BEITCH) Huh, huh? Shouts out to Trapaholics
{TRAPAHOLICS MIXTAPE} Nicki Minaj!!

[Nicki Minaj]
We like them boys with them rubber band bands
He-he-he-he-he move weight, keep a couple gram grams
So-so-so-so-so where your money, put it in your hand hands
Now-now-now-now-now make it flip, make it do a handstand

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Do a handstand, could you do a handstand?
Flip that money make it do a handstand
I can make 'em cream like a Summer Jam band
Where are my bands? Where my rubber band mans

[Nicki Minaj]
It's offical, bang your pistol
Play your money it's funny, I mean it tickles
I need a D-boy, I need a President
And if you spendin them stacks, I needs the evidence
Then you can bring out all them cars that they rap 'bout
Then I'ma let you eat it like I put the snacks out
Don't say you can't, say you can, say you can can
Flip that money, fuh-lip it like a handstand

[Chorus]

[Shannell]
He's a banker, by nature
He'll call a stick up the debt that you owe and thank ya
He'll switch the toys out, never the same route
for niggaz actin like they ain't about to pay out
Takin me out just to ask me how my day went
Tryin to show me I'm his #1 investment
He know what I like, stay on your job type
I'll pop if you can pop like you got rubber bands, we like

[Nicki Minaj]
We like them boys with them rubber band bands
He-he-he-he-he move weight, keep a couple gram grams
So-so-so-so where your money, put it in your hand hands
Now-now-now-now-now make it flip, make it do a handstand

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj &amp; Shannell]
Cause we like, bad boys and bad cars
Them hood rich, dope boys and trap stars
We like, bad boys and bad cars
Them hood rich, dope boys and trap stars
{Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhh}
(The Aphilliates, pay attention!)

[Shannell]
See I'm a rubber lover, so wrap it and I'll hug ya
Then we can stick together like them dollars out the printer
Bad boys I catch, call me undercover
Street grindin, cold cut motherfucker

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
He flip it like handstands, he cookin them ten grams
Give him the grand slam in back of the phan-tam
Heh I mean the Phantom, I can't stand bums
Somethin 'bout his money make a nigga handsome
Cuff cuff, throw your badge on me
Guaranteed you can't puff puff pass on me
We can crush crush, you can spend your stash on me
Cause I know you want to smash like a crash dummy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
