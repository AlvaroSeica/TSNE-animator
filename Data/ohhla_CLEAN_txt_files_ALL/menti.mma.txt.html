[Verse 1]
Check this out, baby
tenemos tremendo lio
last night you didn't go
a la casa de tu tio (huh?)
resultase, hey you were at a party
higher than than the sky 
emborrachada de Bacardi (no I wasn't)
I bet you didn't know que conoci al cantinero (what?)
He told me that you were drinking, and wasting my dinero
Talking about, come and enjoy what a woman gives a hombre
(but first of all see, I have to know your nombre)
now I really wanna ask ya, que si es verdad (would I lie?)
and please por favor, tell me la verdad
because I really need to know yeah necesito entender
If you're gonna be a player, or be my mujer
cause right now you're just a liar, a straight mentirosa (who me?)
Today you tell me something, y mañana otra cosa

[Santana Samples]

[Verse 2]
I remember the day, que tu me decia
Time and time again que tu me querias (I do!)
and at the time, hey! yo te creia
porque no sabia that you where a relambia
You and Fulanito y Menganito, Jose-ito y Fernandito
Larry, and Joey, y then his brother Chico (uh-uh)
Mucho de frontera, that's a straight skeeza
si quieres un pedacito go her way cause she's a pleasa
But I'll tell ya, straight up porque broder me di de cuenta
That on Main Street her cuerpo estaba a la venta
Now get some el que quiera, get some cualquiera
Hey yo, she don't care man, she's a tremenda fiera
Yeah, you're hot to try and out to get what I got
Pero ya que te conosco what I got I guess not (porque)
Cause you're just a mentirosa con tu lengua venenosa
Today you tell me somethin y mañana otra cosa

[dialogue]
Mellow-"Girl, I can't believe you.  
You know my mother's talking about me, 
my friends are talking about me.  Not me about you."
Girl-"About me?"
Mellow- "You're nothing but a skeezer"
Girl- "A skeezer?  Don't be calling me no skeezer!"
Mellow-"S-si eres tremenda fletera mami uhuh la verdad."  
Girl "Uhuh eso es que tu te piensas"
Mellow- "I bet you go to church and you're scared to confess."
Girl-"No, I do confess baby.  I do confess."
Mellow-"Uh huh.  Do you tell the truth, though?"
Girl-"Yeah I do."
Mellow-"Yeah right."
Girl-"Do you?"
Mellow-"Yeah!  You're nothing but a skeezer you know what?  
I got some  other stories to say about you.  And it goes like this."

[Verse 3]
Un dia estaba en tu casa y ring, there goes the phone
Recojiste y dijiste (call me back, I'm not alone)
El queria tu direccion, yeah just your address
y ante que colgaste I heard you say (I'll wear a dress)
Ay, alabao' que descar'a is what ran through my mind
So I said let's go out tonight 
She said (we go out all the time!) Alabao' man!
Ella no sabia that yo, I knew her plan
de que iba a salir with that other man
So I told the girl in spanish I said hey!  Ya me voy (pero porque?)
Cause you ain't treating me like I'm some sucker toy
Cause who needs you anyway (I need you!) con tu lengua venenosa
(no te vayes mellow no te vayes, yo te necesito!)
Today you tell me something, y manana otra cosa (tsk! but?!)
Mentirosa!</pre>
