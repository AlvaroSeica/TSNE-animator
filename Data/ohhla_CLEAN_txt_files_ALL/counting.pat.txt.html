(Intro, Project Pat)
Niggas out here talkin bout... it ain't bout the money
I talked to this nigga the other day man
This nigga said told me "It ain't bout the money"
Haha, I'm like my nigga...
If it ain't bout the money, what the fuck it's bout?

(Hook x8, Project Pat)
Ho, I'm countin money
Ho, that shit ain't nothing (That ain't shit!)

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Fresh up off the press, I got ink all on my finger tips
Thumbin through that check, make it flip, maybe cop a brick
Money on my mind, I can't sleep; I gotta have paper bitch
M's stacked on top of M's, I want that Bill Gates shit
Fuck nigga, counterfeit? Talkin all that fake shit?
Chop 'em on ya like some grams, clean out my estate bitch
Money on my mind, in the sky; I'm stayin blunted
Money make that pussy wet, countin all these hundreds'
Talkin bout you flexin, but you broke and lookin bummy
I pull up; Maserati, red bitch and a bunny
Ho that ain't no money, pop your ass with twenty bands
All this cash in my hand, watch me do the money dance

(Hook x8, Project Pat)
Ho, I'm countin money
Ho, that shit ain't nothing (That ain't shit!)

(Verse 2, Nasty Mane)
Ho I'm countin money, I'm thumbin through the check
She said money make her cum, it make my dick erect
Nasty Mane, I'm always on some money shit
Hey, fifty g's to hold my pants up, that's that Louie shit
I'm in the club throwin money, it look like it flies
My niggas hangin in the back throwin gang signs
Yeah we pop them bottles
Yeah we fuck with models
Leave that bitch swimmin in the money, say I need some goggles
We see them niggas hatin
Well fuck it, let 'em hate
If they had some hustle about they self, they could participate
They got they hands out
It ain't no hand outs
That type of attitude will keep you with your ass out

(Hook x8, Project Pat)
Ho, I'm countin money
Ho, that shit ain't nothing (That ain't shit!)</pre>
