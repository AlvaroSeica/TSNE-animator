I'm a bird with a fix
I lay with the roaches
My 85 Cutlass red and it be smoking
Posting and hustling
Struggling and plugging
Mean muggin and thuggin and cursing out you cop suckers
My all black soldier Reebok's with the bubble gum sole
Good for walking and running from the dumb ass popos
Mo hustling slicker than Earl, colder than furl
Trying to get a little something something in this cold cold world
Everybody and they mama out here shooting game
Perpetrating and faking, even the got damn preacher man
Gangstas harmonizing like my nigga Mo B
Prime Suspects, 3rd ward soldiers
Living raw better have my boulders
Shooting dog water all ya'l back up call
Rob with Silkk up in the Viper
Can't catch me, I know they don't like me

[Chorus x4]

Get it how ya live how we live be raw
I ain't bout being broke crooked officer

One more strike a nigga out of this bitch
Coppers on my ass I gotta think real quick
Trying to make it over for that LAP
Plus its dark in the trees, gone cushion the seat
For a smooth getaway, at least that's what I thought
Head up the alleyway they had two more cars
(Freeze mothafucka freeze, oh shit he's armed and dangerous)
I know that I'm a die if I let them coppers get me
My oozie got 32 rounds I'm taking two of ya bitches with me
I refuse to be a victim, going out like Adolf Arjay
You got a gun I got a gun I run no more bitch
NOPD trying to send me upstate
With a murder case, what the fuck
Can somebody pick the place
No not today I'm gone get mine
Never ever dying
But if I do than its cool, in between time of food
I got away

[Chorus x4]

I'm on some other shit
Some killed my brother shit
I'm out here getting and I'm gone get what I can get
Dicksuckers in my mothafucking place though
Smiling in my face
I keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
Millimeter get to bucking your whole body turning numb
Now the cops running after me now I can't cope
I hit the parkway when I stash my dope
Cause if these pigs catch me slipping or tripping I'm dead
No suspects no motives, with two to the head
Fuck that I ain't with it, so I'm gone sell my dope
Yes its ran buy boat, but these niggaz can't cope
Cause they caught in the dope world
Fancy cars, fly clothes daytons and vogues
And these fucking pussy popping hoes
Them dick suckers fitting to been man they already done had
But fuck that I gots this mac so I'm busting back
Its hot as fuck, you better duck
The last thing in my mind in this world is being locked up
I'm on probation, life is what I'm facing
In this damn zoo
Them boys in blue is always after the crew
Because we stay true in doing what we do
(25 with a L son)
Man fuck you
And do this time shit never mind
I'd rather rhyme build my client
Get mine never blind and pack a nine
They never see my desperate signs
And fuck a bind
They think I'm blind to his kind
Crooked as fuck, you out of luck
Stuck in this cell, a living hell
Bust back, you might as well
peep this I'm clocking figures
Pulling triggers on niggaz that run up
They getting done up
From sun down to sun up
It don't stop I'm on the block slanging rocks
You crooked cops, they on my jock my glock
You cop catch me now I bust a shot
Get it how you live how we live be raw</pre>
