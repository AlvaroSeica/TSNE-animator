[Ras Ceylon]
Did you ever have a day that you knew was mystic
things went right and your vibe uplifted from that
normal routine discover new things
like a lifelong friend and a true queen
now I know this seems like its so ordinary
I'm at the grocery store with 7 bucks and 3 pennies
picked up potatoes oranges and water
at the register stood an african goddess
ethiopian daughter so I say tenastalin
she smiled then those eyes never did pretend
lemme begin these the first lines in a book
called the love of my life and yo she's off the hook

[CHORUS-SCRATCH]
There she goes again the Dopest Ethiopian 4X

[Ras Ceylon]
Now she's on mind like all the time
I'm up at her job just trying to find the line
with only her in it I asked for the digits
said she aint with it cuz she's seeing someone
Im done with those sad stories familiar tunes
usually soon the game would resume but
few could match her beautiful petite frame
angelic face Amharic strain telling me things
without even saying a word I left her a speech ofÂ 
His Majesty's work hit the curb then jumped in the ride
bumpin the Pharcyde shes passin me by

[CHORUS-SCRATCH]
There she goes again the Dopest Ethiopian 4X

[Ras Ceylon]
Its been a few weeks since I last struck out
I know where shes at but thats a tough route
specially now cuz I got a steady thing too
girls become women I do what I do
I was 22 and just sick of the playground
tired of the clubs drunk chicks stay around
I may have affection but need love perfection
invest in that spiritual metaphysical connection
and yes its been a long time sistren
you forgot the I but you still look a ten
maybe when your little fling is done
you can give this king a chance your queendom
needs dem vibes I man supply deep
couldn't believe my eyes she left her number on the receipt

[CHORUS-SCRATCH]
There she goes again the Dopest Ethiopian 4X</pre>
