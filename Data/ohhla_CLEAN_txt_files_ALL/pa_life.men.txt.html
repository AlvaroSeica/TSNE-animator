Typed by: apach3chicano@aol.com

Now I'm kicking back with my head against the wall
Reminiscing about the time I used to buzz
Kicking it with the homies always slanging rocks
22nd and Naomi yeah that was the spot
Damn I miss those days gangbanging
Juras sweating us cause were trying to make a lil money for our families
Homies all around
Real Gs never go to sleep
Remembering times we creeped on our enemies
Damn we used to party and fuck up the spots
Puro desmadre running away from the cops
Yeah those were the good ol days
98 past and I did not do the same
We were some crazy ass cholos
Just trying to survive on the eastside of the SC
Now I'm just wiping those lil tears from my eyes
The good ol times of this parqueros life

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm reminiscing about the times I used to ride
From now till the day I die
I kick it smoke a sack
Letting time fly by it's a parqueros life

Some crazy motherfuckers with the straps
I remember we used to get high and laugh talkin about the hoes we fucked
Damn I miss the past
We used to sit in the car smoking shirv and grass
But everyone grows up its just a matter of time
It was hard to survive on the streets
But I stood by
We ghot the feria really quick
Drinkin on the Malibu run till we got sick
It was hard trying to live a life of just memories
The good ol days will never die
Life as Gs
So I'm sittin in the park wastin my time
Reminiscing with some rhymes of this parqueros life

[Chorus]

So I guess its all over I guess this is the end
The memories will never fit
We'll always be friends
You're my camaradas so please don't let me down
I always got my homies back simon I'm down
So I guess il blaze and smoke a 5th
For the homies that past away (I love you dawg)
There still doing there thing
I know your in heaven and with your angle waves
Be my guardians so when I die
I can rest in peace (rest in Peace)
This piedra that I stand on will never grow old
The parque is here and its never gonna go (that's right)
Gangbanging for life I'm doing my thing
In my blazadory I'm living my dream and with this park I have a hope
You realize
I got love for my hood and its never gonna die
Parque for life EASTSIDE

[Chorus]

Well... Guess it all ends up to this you know
for the good times the bad times
I'll never give up my love for the hood you know what I mean
So every day got my memories
I sit back and just think about it you know about the
Parqueros life </pre>
