[Chorus]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you know about that {*3X*}
Ay, don't you know I gotta key by the three
When I chirp shawty chirp back
Louie nap sack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that {*3X*}
Hey I know all about that
Loaded 44 on the low where the cheese at
Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
Hey what you know about that
Hey I know all about that

[Verse 1]
See me in your city sittin pretty know I'm shinin dog
Ridin with a couple Latin broads and a china doll
And you know how we ball
Riding in shiny cars
Walk in designer malls
Buy everything he saw
You know about me dog
Don't talk about me dog
And if you doubt me dog
You better out me dog
I'm throwed off slightly bro
Don't wanna fight me bro
I'm fast as lightening bro
You better use your Nike's bro
Know you don't like me cause
Your bitch most likely does
She see me on them dubs
In front of every club
I be on dro I'm buzzed
Gave every hoe a hug
Niggaz don't show me mugs
Cause you don't know me cuz

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Candy on the six four
Leather guts and fish bowl
Fifty on my pinky ring just to make my fist glow
Your bitches get low
Because I get dough
So what I'm rich hoe
I'll still pull a kick yo
What you talking shit for
You gotta run and hit for
Got you yelling and I thought you put out a gun hit for
But you's a scary dude
Believed by very few
Just keep it very cool
Or we will bury you
See all that attitude's, unnecessary dude
You never carry tools not even square, he cube
You got the people fooled, who see me on the tube
Whatever try the crew, they'll see you on the news

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Fresh off the jet to the block
Burning rubber with the top popped
My partners busting shots, I'll tell them stop it make the block hot
Yo label got got
Cuz you are not hot
I got the top spot
And it will not stop
A video or not that will bust it to the glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
I know we not y'all
If it may pop off
I'll answer the question "Will I get your block knocked off?"
This what it is bro
Look I will kill bro
I'm in your hood if you a gangsta what you hid for
Somebody better get bro before he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for
