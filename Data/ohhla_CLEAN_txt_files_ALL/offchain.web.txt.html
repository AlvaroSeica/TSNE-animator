Album:  Teenage Mutant Ninja Rapper
Song:   Off the Chain
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, okay
I got high and wrote this song in like
45 minutes
Ha, what's good?
Check it, ay

I'm a go ahead and do my thang
You just gotta let me off the chain
Yeah
I'm off the chain
Off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain

I'm like a rap star
Minus the money and the record deal
Bitch I'm whippin' in a piece of crap car
But I don't give a fuck
'Cause I spit it mad hard
You could inspect my lyrics
Never find a bad bar

I'm in my backyard
Rollin' kronic
Rap rollick
Artists like Jack Pollock
Drop shit so sick
I need an antibiotic
I'm an otter
And I'll crack you like the shell of a mollusk

Oh my God, it's Webby
With a machete
Ready to go after
Both Jason and Freddy
I am deadly like a black mamba
Sippin' Odwalla
Mixed with vodka
Runnin' shit like the Godfather

So call me Corleone
I'm rollin' with 40 homies
And you could hold the camera
Come watch your shorty bow me
My first is in five minutes
Like off of the brains
Or as anybody bitch
I'll say I'm off of the chain, ay

I'm a go ahead and do my thang
You just gotta let me off the chain
I'm off the chain
Off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain

I'm the next big thing
Incase you couldn't tell
Give me one mother fucker
Who'd say I wouldn't sell
I'm good and well
Hearin' me underground
Unsighned tight
Dude, I don't fuck around

And see I'm buzzin' now
All over internets
Webby's on the web
You're behind if you haven't clicked it yet
I'm shootin' free throws
All you people miss the net
I'm off the chain bitch
Like an evicted pet
Get it?
'Cause if a pet got evicted
It, uh, wouldn't have a leash on..
Man, forget it

I'm twisted
Roll it up, hit it
I'm so fucking dope
They should put me on exhibit
'Cause you know I rip it
Every day spittin' more and more
Magic than any Slytherin or Gryffindor

Dumbledore's steppin' in
Feelin' like the principle
Don't need a body guard
Webby's invincible
My life is inimitable
But I'm a push 'em to the back
Like I hired 'em as actors
I'll put 'em in a cast
With the punches that be flyin' at speeds above fast
So retrace your foot prints
Bitch step back
What?

I'm a go ahead and do my thang
You just gotta let me off the chain
I'm off the chain
Off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain
Off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain

You just got to let me off the chain

I walk in
They call me the kid like Billy
Crushin' Keystones all night
Get silly
Let's throw down at beer pong
'Cause bitch I'm illy
Hit six cups
Then I re-rack 'em like Willy

I am a Gremlin
And I rhyme
Never ending
Stay gettin' high
Got no time for descendin'
People give me praises any time I get mentioned
Even though my skin's whiter than the belly of a penguin

I need an intervention
Before I go brain dead
With a pencil is the only time I aim lead
But me and your girl gon' wake up in the same bed
Wiping her mouth
Claiming she never even gave head

I'll murder K-Fed
And hit Britney up
Oh, you got two kids?
I don't give a fuck
She said hit me one more time
So I hit it up
Lohan, I got a Trojan
Come here you little slut

So messed up lookin' for a pair of
Double D's, please
Step to me, I fucking dare ya
Oh God, I'm seein' double
No Tia and Tamera
'Cause I hit 'em like bam
I don't need a Margera

I'm a go ahead and do my thang
You just gotta let me off the chain
I'm off the chain
Off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain
Off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain

You just got to let me off the chain. [x2]</pre>
