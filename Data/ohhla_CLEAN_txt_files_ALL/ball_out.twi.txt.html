Typed by: AZ Lyrics

ball out we ball out
ball out we ball out

yea look at my chain man
look at my reign man
this ice around my neck got me lookin insane mayne got me looking insane man
and tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
you can tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
look at my chain man
look at my reign man
this ice around my neck got me lookin insane mayne got me looking insane man
and tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
you can tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
and tell 'em we ball out

nobody mall out
we go to big money when we never go to small house
you can tell 'em we ball out ball out ball out
you call us we hit your city and club bring barbies and dolls out
what you about this is our house and this is how we does it
it's young money baby never put nothing above it
yea now tell them haters fall back
I pull out that jewelery box and show 'em all that

yea look at my chain man
look at my reign man
this ice around my neck got me lookin insane mayne got me looking insane man
and tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
you tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
look at my chain man
look at my reign man
this ice around my neck got me lookin insane mayne got me looking insane man
and tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
you can tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
and tell 'em we ball out

I do it all day like I never ever did it before
swinging my money like it grow on trees
and this is about time we dig more holes
but I'm still riding in my rolls
collecting dough at my shows
take the dough to the crib [?] now it's time to fill these hoes
tell me what you know bout me heard this like a G
T-W-I-S-T
Trying to go the college and get a degree
but the ice distract me diamonds so tacky
bout to go the mall and steal like a G
now hater look look

yea look at my chain man
look at my reign man
this ice around my neck got me lookin insane mayne got me looking insane man
and tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
you can tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
look at my chain man
look at my reign man
this ice around my neck got me lookin insane mayne got me looking insane man
and tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
you can tell 'em we ball out (ball out)
we ball out (ball out)
and tell 'em we ball out
