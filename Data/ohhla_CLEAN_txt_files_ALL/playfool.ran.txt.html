Thinkin of a master plan
Cause my controller just slipped right out my hand
So I dig in my pocket, all the money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some Dead Presidents
I need money, a paddle's like 25 bills
and them third party joints don't help my skills
I used to roll up, like buddy hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Traded my games at Funco cause I ain't have the money
But I now learned to earn cause I'm righteous
But now I'm desperate, so maybe I might just
grab my Spider-Man #1
Run into the comic shop so I can get some funds
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin kinda bummed cause man do I miss
#1 with the Todd McFarlane
But it's a rare gem he gon' probably bargain
And I'ma take the money that I rake in
Flash it in mom face cause she was always hatin
Threatened to throw away the comics
Almost did when I went to camp, I had to make a promise
Walk into the cave with my mylar sleeves
Thin post to my chest so the cats don't see
So I got my swag back, thinkin 'bout later
Me and Jon Bap, gettin up a game of
TecmoBowl had a hold but I let go
Dropped the joystick and {*ca-crack*} I heard the echo
It sound like a dream about gettin paid
So I stopped at the comic shop around the way
Then I looked at the clerk, and to my surprise
He said I'll give you like a $1.75
... Gotta be some kind of mistake
This a rare print man, this ain't no fake
He said - Marvel gave your leg a pull
They made three million of these - so I played a fool
