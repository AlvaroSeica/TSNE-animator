[Nicki Minaj]
I can be selfish, yeah so impatient
Sometimes I feel, like Marilyn Monroe
I'm insecure, yeah I make mistakes
Sometimes I feel like, I'm at the end of the road

[Chorus]
I can get low, I can get low
Don't know which way is up
Yeah I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down
Call it a curse! Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst, you ain't gettin my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt? (Felt felt felt)
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt (felt felt felt)

[Nicki Minaj]
It's like all the good things, they fall apart like
Like-li-li-like, li-li-Marilyn Monroe
Truth is we mess up, 'til we get it right
I don't want to end up, lo-lo-losin my soul

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Take me, or leave me; I'll never be perfect
Believe me I'm worth it
So take me or leave me! (So take me or leave me)
So take me or leave me! (T-t-take me or leave me)

[Outro]
Call it a curse! Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst, you ain't gettin my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt? (Felt felt felt)
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt (felt felt felt)
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt? (Felt felt felt)
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt (felt felt felt)
