[Intro]
Hey now... all you sinners
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now... all you lovers
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now... all you killers
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now... all you children
Leave your lights on, you better leave your lights on

[Everlast]
Cause there's a monster, livin under my bed
Whisperin in my ear
And there's an angel, with her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
There's a darkness, livin deep in my soul
Still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine, deep into my hole
And God don't let me loose my nerves, don't let me loose my nerves

[Interlude]
Hey now {*4X*}
Whoa-hohh hey now
Hey now {*4X*}

[Everlast]
Hey now... all you sinners
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now... all you children
Leave your lights on, you better leave your lights on
Cause there's a monster, livin under my bed
Whisperin in my ear
And there's an angel, with her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
She say la ila-ha il allah
You gonna shine like star
La ila-ha il allah
You gonna shine like star - oh let me fade away</pre>
