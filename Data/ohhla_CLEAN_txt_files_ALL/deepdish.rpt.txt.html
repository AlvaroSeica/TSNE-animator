(Intro)
It's Gotti Bin Laden
It's Gotti Bin Laden
They say I'm the evil one
Gotti Adolf Hitler

[Chorus]
You niggaz ain't nuthin but bitches
I roll down the streets with the homies on deep dishes
Crack niggaz like plates and dishes
authentic, malicious, vicious, piranha fishes motherfucker, eat a fat dick
You and every single nigga that you fuck with, you stole my shit
My style, my name, and the way that I bang

[Verse 1]
Think just because you got diamonds you niggaz is shynin'
Your diamonds ain't bigger than Simon's motherfucker
I'm preparing to pump fear, and I'm fearless as fuck
The Count Armani Crystal Young Gotti Kurupt
Knockin' cinder block sections outta cars and trucks
I'm back and never left, I came and never leave
I see bustas now-a-days wearin flags and chucks
Actin' like they bang, lookin like fags in chucks
They turned bangin to a gimmick, nigga its the truth
You don't wear kahkis with Timberland boots, or Air force ones
Juss Cortez and Chucks, you copy-cat punks
The thunda's official on California Soil
Made him mass destruction and termoil
You ain't got weapons of mass destruction on you
And I'ma make you leak like gallons of oil

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Think just because you got diamonds you niggaz is shynin'
Ya diamonds will get motherfuckers to firin'
I'm tired of watchin BET
And all I really see is imataions of me
And everything that we used to be
They used to say we couldnt Gang Bang on TV
But now-a-days thats all I see
Nigga im Pharatic in a G'd up fashion
With a passion for dumpin' and blastin'
A terrorist nigga
The most wanted Gotti Bin Laden for ridin'
Homicidal vibes is the object
My objective strategic selective
I'm back home nigga so mark off your sections
I got all bad news, Make niggaz move, Relocate to a different state
I get shit dumpin' like motherphukkin Austrailian Kangaroos
I got all the tools, from the homies that Crippin' nigga to pirus
I'm the fire fly nigga, I'ma show what happens when 5 fly nigga
Nigga I ain't no bitch, And I'ma tell you bitch niggaz just like this Nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So what you know about rollin' these streets so deep
Juss G to a T nigga rollin on 3's
What you know about Gang Bangin' nigga
Or are you just imatating Gang Bangin' nigga
Some of these niggaz might go for it
20 others just sit back and ignore it
But not us from Tha Raw motherfuckeraa
Gotta let you bitch niggaz know motherfuckeraa
We Ride these Streets, All Weeks
Hood than a motherfucker
ZEEET ZEEEET !!
Bangin these streets
What you know about us
What about you nigga
We don't know about you
What you really wanna what you wanna Really bout to do

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro]
Motherfucker, Every nigga you rolled wit
Every nigga you fuck wit nigga
It's Gotti Bin Laden, Gotti Adolf Hitler
Nigguh Paul Vitti Stallone, Ne Ohafa, The Juggaknot
Hannibal the 8th, Gotti Vorhees nigga, fuck y'all
KURUPT! Suckaa ass niggaz, yeah Death Row</pre>
