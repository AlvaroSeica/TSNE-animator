Refrain:
[Ya-Boyy]
If I gave you a dollar everytime you gave me head,
you be a rich bitch, a rich bitch,
for all the time you came clean and you made a nigga scream,
you be a rich bitch, a rich bitch
[C-Rena']
If I gave you a dollar everytime you lick my click,
you be a rich nigga, rich nigga,
for all the time you got love, diggin' in my booty, hoe
you be a rich nigga, rich nigga

Verse 1:
[Niece]
I still get chills thinking 'bout last week,
the night when you straight played dog on me,
stuck your tongue out and you crawled on me,
had a nigga jumping like a front, ooh wee!,
what the hell you be thinking 'bout when you going down?
you got my knees shaking, nigga please slow it down,
your name must be Lu by the way you do-do brown,
calling me a bitch? Shit, who the bitch now?
the plan was: shake the little ass you know,
hit you for you cash, kick your ass out the door,
I had to say it, for reala, you don't know how to fuck, nigga,
I'm a thug hoe, calling you a fuck nigga,
suck a dick to get rich, yeah, I might, you bitch,
but you said I sucked your dick, yeah, right, you bitch,
It's not that I despite what to spike ya bitch,
It's all about them pays, hoes, get your game right bitch!

Refrain

Verse 2:
[Ya-Boyy]
Whoa! Hold up! Why you blowing out?
Ya-Boyy, do-do brown, yo, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
Talking 'bout Ya-Boyy, tricking, not playing, having fun,
spreading lies, talking bout Ya-Boyy tricking with his tongue,
I never knew a bitch who told lies on me,
a bitch like you, who despised on me,
tryin' to get cute, get fly on me,
a hoe, just underground, trying to rise on me,
holler, midday-bitches like, send a pigeon down friends,
I hit it from the back, but just as far as I'm with, see,
I'm the type of nigga that's down for paying dues,
fuck it, never sucking, just straight fucking, bitch,
don't get mad at me cause you did what you did,
hoe be a hoe, stop lying like a kid,
'cause if you had a dollar everytime you wit' down,
you probably be the richest bitch in town

Refrain

[Ya-Boyy](C-Rena')

[Now you need it like, this hoe?] (Fuck you bitch)
[But how you want it, like this hoe?] (Fuck you bitch)
[But how you like it, like this hoe?] (Fuck you bitch)
[Why's that?] (Cause I don't trying to hear that shit!)
(How you need it like this nigga?) [Fuck you hoe]
(How you want it, like this nigga?) [Fuck you trick]
(How you like it, like this nigga?) [Fuck you bitch]
(Why's that?) [Cause Ya-Boyy ain't trying to hear this shit!]
