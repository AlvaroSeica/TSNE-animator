[Chorus: Margeaux Davis]
It's Rode, muthafucka, Rodentz, muthafucka
It's Rode, muthafucka, Rodentz, muthafucka
It's Rode, muthafucka, Rodentz, muthafucka
It's Rode, it's Rode, it's Rode

[Cno Evil]
I spit prequels to life that go beyond the past
I stick my ancestor's knife real deep in your cast
Itching like a rash, you need stitches for that gash
I'm an ar-teest, watch me draw a dash with a slash
So fast, you might think I'm The Flash, Wally West
Guns to your chest, no vest, cause Somali stress
Somebody request a contest of the best deployed
I suggest a test to detect steroids
Red and white blood cells fight, I got a war within
Before I draw an outline to life, I trace my origin
I hear the violin, and wanna commit sin
I form a grin as thoughts of Berlin start to begin
You take it on the chin, make you taste 'defeat'
Sorta like Zohan kicks to the face, you get beat
You seem incomplete, two wheels with no seat
Should we repeat to stomp feet on these concrete streets?
He, is, just something you gotta witness
Here to put hip hop back in shape without the fitness
Delicious, but yet his rhymes so vicious
I think I've seen him on stage next to Stan Ipcus
You created a monster too big for your roster
While you still 'Dancing With the Wolves' like Kevin Costner
You lobster-headed, hip hop embedded in my skin
Now watch me pass the mic to my Rodent twin

[Li-Mouse]
Li and Cno E, we back, but we never left
We slept to build more shit to blow up our chest
We came back, and now we see that rap is a mess
So all you other MC's, breathe and give it a rest
I suggest, ya'll listen up close, dog, we been hot
Rodentz making the deaf able to hear a pin drop
This just comes natural, our spirits are actual
The way we spit 'em, are no less than tactical
Hitting nerves and vessels, in your cranium
Wondering why the hell ain't nobody paying them
It's because hip hop deaf-ness, is a plague
And they become as soft as a shell of an egg
The Rodentz Forever, kid, ain't no other
Contest us and it's definite, that we will smother
The competition, challenges and obstacles
Death or life, the choices are optional
The heat we bring, exceeds that of tropical
Once started, this train is unstoppable
Hating ass cats need to keep watching
Don't look my way, once The Rodentz start to pop off
Like champagne bottle corks
I'm sick, like we all swine, fucking with the pork
Cno Evil and Li-Mouse, the unbreakable team
Hip hopping, like we was listening to Wu's C.R.E.A.M.

[Chorus: Margeaux Davis]
It's Rode, muthafucka, Rodentz, muthafucka
It's Rode, muthafucka, Rodentz, muthafucka
It's Rode, muthafucka, Rodentz, muthafucka
It's Rode, muthafucka
It's Rode, it's Rode, it's Rode

[kung-fu sample]
They've mistaken ideas
But they're both good men
Get up... </pre>
