We be doin' murder everyday, we be good enough to get away
You won't even know a wicked clown has hit the door
Until your melon hit the floor and roll away

How can I stop myself from murdering your neck
Methadone and Prozac only keep me in check
As soon as it's gone, I'm gonna KILL!
And that was my last refill, God damnit
I drink Lithium and I don't even know what it is
Only reason why you diss me is cause you want a sip
Everytime I drink it I piss out a laser
And cut holes in the wall with my dick phaser
I'm a do time I assume
I bitch smacked the judge right out his own court room
Then I took the bench and sentenced myself
Eternal happiness and good health motherfucker, motherfucker
Motherfucker, I represent the Hatchet
I see your eyeball lookin' at me like I'm a snatch it
And throw it to the garbage can down the hall
Then kick you in your ass as you search and crawl for it

We be doin' murder everyday, we be good enough to get away
You won't even know a wicked clown has hit the door
Until your melon hit the floor and roll away

We be doin' murder everyday, we be good enough to get away
You won't even know a wicked clown has hit the door
Until your melon hit the floor and roll away

You know Jamie Madrox rapped about something like this
Only I never really thought about how horrible it really is
Laying in a coffin in the pitch black dark
The only sound being that of my heart, if I'm alive
But I've had no pulse or even breath for days
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze
But I do recall my funeral, them lowering me in
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in
I tried to move my fingers or somethin', got nothin'
But dirt hitting the top from them shovelling, I'm fucked
It's been at least two weeks but I don't keep time
I just lay here motionless in this rotting body of mine
I tried fantasy realms and dreaming my way out
It only leads to mind panicking and torturing thoughts about
Running and breathing, will it ever really happen again
Please God, heaven or hell, just let something begin

Am I asleep or not, I don't know
My body is rotting and I feel pain
Gimme to heaven or gimme to hell
But don't leave me dead inside this thing
My body won't let me go, let me go, go
My body won't let me go, let me go, go

Am I asleep or not, I don't know
My body is rotting and I feel pain
Gimme to heaven or gimme to hell
But don't leave me dead inside this thing

Am I asleep or not, I don't know
My body is rotting and I feel pain
Gimme to heaven or gimme to hell
But don't leave me dead inside this thing
My body won't let me go, let me go, go
My body won't let me go, let me go, go</pre>
