Typed by: AZ Lyrics

A wise man once said
We exist in a bizarre combination of stone age emotions
Medieval beliefs, God like technology many people can reach

I can sit on the beach, watch the sky turn violet-red
While moving through a planetary spider web
See the jungle through the eye of a tiger's head

Black hat hackers fight from their lion's den
While truth lives and dreams that go free
We got rickety boats bursting at the seams with refugees
(Check it)

While some kids fight just to make the honor roll
Other kids fight just to claim the waterhole
And you know it, the moment the air is motionless
Compassionate emotions stick when your motion shifts

And I don't trust my TV news caster
My world flips likes a 3D view master
Look out the window and put it in a paragraph
Watching life travel past back in cattle class

Harness the beat and the passion that you heart gives
The Noah Ark kid, captain of his starship
Don't let him tell you different to all you school kids
Being smart is cool, prepare your mental toolkits

And with this knowledge, start to get your bandwidth
The architecture of science and I can chase the planet
I got the fresh force I hopped and leapt forth
So check it mate, I'm the palm to cross the chessboard

Sometimes they try to break me
(Hey, ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound
(Hey, ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

Sometimes they try to break me
(Hey, ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound
(Hey, ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

I was told that life is as easy as can be
But apparently the tragedy is freedom isn't free
I've been bleeding on this beat and spilling my guts
At the last supper where the Gods fill up my cup

See the truth is, it's all in your head
And time will only stop still when your wings are spread
There's no map to buy for the trail to my heart
So I'll be coming home after I sail to the stars

And that kid hovers high, yelling live, love or die
While he swallows caterpillars and spits butterflies

With a mic and a Molotov, missile's on a message
It's a lunar eclipse when I listening to records
I brainstorm to rid the taxes and change laws

The worlds on course to clash with the claymore
The captain that came forth packing a chainsaw I never knocked
I took an axe to the stage door

I'm like the ever lit match when the rain pours
A legend to my friends coming back from a great tour
The true crusader stands up to the man
Mind over matter turns handcuffs into sand

It's contained in a flame and it lives in a heartbeat
So fuck this party man, give me the car keys
I wanna give like Mr. Smith in 'Seven Pounds'
To change my brain to a plane that never grounds

Sometimes they try to break me
(Hey, ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound
(Hey, ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

Sometimes they try to break me
(Hey, ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound
(Hey, ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

Sometimes they try to break me
(Hey, ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound
(Hey, ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

Sometimes they try to break me
(Hey, ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound
(Hey, ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air</pre>
