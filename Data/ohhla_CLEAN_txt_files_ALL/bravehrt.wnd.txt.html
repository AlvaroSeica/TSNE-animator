[Intro] 
[Braveheart Movie Sample]
Sons of Scotland
What would you do without freedom?
Will you fight?
Fight and you may die
Run and you will live
At least a while...
And dying in your beds
Many years from now, would you be willing to trade
All the days from this day to that
For one chance just one chance 
To come back here and tell our enemys
That you may take our lifes 
But you'll never take our freedom

[Deeko]
My name is D double E to the K O
And I've been writing rap songs since a day old
A guess even back then you could say oh
That's that boy with the ill type slick flow
Fresh outa Portobello spitting that fire
Always wanted to be a rapper until the day I retired
Flyer than a helicopter shooting civilians
Like troops out in Irque am making a Killing
In the Game now 
Not Eminem But similar skin color 
Same feelings towards my mother (Bitch)
A check rappers like am writing on chessboards
The boy Steve told me 'Deek kill them and destroy'
So thats What a will do 
Take you back to the boy with the shit shoes
Fastforward to the mic and the Pro-tools
So let me show you crews what a do to dismember you
Cut up you actors like a fucking film editor

[Werd]
Allow me to re-introduce myself my name is Werd
The one and only
Used to rap pretty good Thats the old me
A Guess now am so dope a could O.D.
S.O.S. joint CEO (Werd)
Out of Edinburgh spitting that fire
A be that new cunt taking it higher
Tierd of these fakers all spitting the same
A got a flow thats insain care for the name
(thats right Werd)
And im gonna get payed
So Girls grab the fella wanna switch like Cinderella
But me make chedder thats a little far feached huh
My mate Deeko told me stick in and they'l check this
So thats what I will do take rap and start a checklist
Score off what we get like fans cash ect
A told you dudes what I do so respect this
Spit hot as the Sahara so rap a wont desert this
