Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Oh shit, I'm high now
I'm hurt

I thought I told you I'm a star
Whether with a free or written down bars
No jewelry, piece of shit car but that's just Webby
Bitchin' I'm a star

I'm a star bitch
No five points
Just a high white kid rolling up a joint
I run the fucking beat until I pull my groin
Eating competition like some stakes sirloin
All about my coins like a damn pirate
Fuck with my doubloons bitch, you should never try it
If you don't like it, you're probably just bias
'Cause I'll stay flyer than a helicopter pilot
Phone on silent nobody could reach me
Smoking on that piece pipe we're the fucking TP
Cause I come from CT, hold on 203 C
Hold my nothing special but I know where all the weed be
Beep beep rolling up knee deep, king of all the suburbs and they need me

No need for a receipt, you gon' keep me
Caveman flow I've been rapping since the BC
All about my green like the center of the kiwi
Up and outerspace R2D2 C3P
Your girl's facebook creeps me 'cause she wanna meet me
Flow so magic Veni Vidi Vici
No GED kicked out of Hofstra but I still lay it down on that beat proper
Private school hustler weed up in my dockers
'Cause I always stay high on trees like koalas
Give me twenty dollars put it in my wallet
Rowdy on a beat like a motherfucking mosh pit
Oh my gosh it's Webby baby watch it
No holding back when roll a phat
L up I only bomb shit
I'm the bomb bitch, ecstasy pop it
And then I'm rollin' like Otto Rocket
I got it, no hold up I got it
I'm at the summit bitch, you'll never top it
I'm up in here, Webby's always gonna start something
Always coming with the flame like a carved pumpkin
Got your heart thumping and your car bumping
With this music that I'm making, I don't charge nothing
These are all freebies, so don't start man
'Cause I'm all the way more animals that Tarzan
I live in the Bronx zoo so what you gon' do
I'm a mongrel and I will chomp you
Varsity rapper never on the side lines
Rhyme fine 'cause my mind is Einstein times nine
So start understanding my rhymes cause I've been kicking flow
Since the land before time
I'm back up on a beat, did I stutter bitch
Always gonna come with something sick
Anything you did Webby done that shit
I'm the come back kid, you better stand up
That's why the DEA in Nassau wants me handcuffed
You see ya get down and then I land up
Me and my mic are soldiers, the beat commands us
So roll the gram up 'til we're getting superhigh
Y'all are just fake sick like that Ferris Bueller guy
Me I'm the bird flu, do not make me hurt you
'Cause I spit it raw bitch uncooked perdu
I'm a jerk dude and I will burn you
When the moon is up a werewolf is what I turn to
I'm the rapper you should call, look, always chasing after tail like a dog
Woof, paws, hook-line, hit 'em with the sinker
Then skate away bitch, call me Andy brinck-brincker

I'm a star bitch
Well at least in CT
Feeling right
You know, he's droppin' bars
It's what I do
