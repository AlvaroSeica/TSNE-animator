Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Intro)
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag

(Hook)
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
Ohhhhh

[K'naan]
Born to a throne, stronger then Rome
A violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survivors
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Except no defeat, surrender, retreat
So we strugglin', fightin' to eat
And we wonderin', when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say...

(Hook)

[K'naan]
So many wars, settlin' scores
Bringin' us promises, leavin' us poor
I heard 'em say, love is the way
Love is the answer, that's what they say
But look how they treat us
Make us believers, we fight their battles
Then they deceive us
Tried to control us, they couldn't hold us
Cuz we just moved forward like Buffalo Soldiers
But we strugglin', fightin' to eat
And we wonderin', when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say...

(Hook) 2x

Ohhhhhhh...
Ohhhhhhh...
Ohhhhhhh...

[Interlude]
And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

Ohhhhhhh...
Ohhhhhhh...
Ohhhhhhh...

(Hook) 2x

(Outro)
When I get older; when I get older
I will be stronger, just like a wavin' flag
Just like a wavin' flag, just like a wavin' flag
Flag, flag, just like a wavin' flag</pre>
