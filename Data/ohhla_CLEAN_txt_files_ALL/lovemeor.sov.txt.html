[Lady Sovereign]
Yeah!!
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I dunno...
Make way for the S-O-Veeeeeeeee!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then - thank you
If you hate me then - fuck you!

[Lady Sovereign]
I'm fat, I need a diet, no in fact I'm just too light
And I ain't got the biggest breasteses, but I write all the best disses
(Cha-ching!) I got hairy armpits, but I don't walk around like this
I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty shit (yeah)
Ewww! Never had my nails done
Bite them down until they're numb
I'm the one with the non-existent bum
Now I dont really give a - EWWW!
I'm late for my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missin her diamonds
I'm missin my clippers lies, now bow down to your royal highness
No I dont own a Corgi, had a hamster it died cause I ignored it
Go on then, go on report me, I'm English - try and deport me!

[Chorus]

[Lady Sovereign]
I'm that funky little monkey with the tiniest ears
I don't like drinkin fancy champy, I'll stick with Heineken beers
{*LOUD BELCH*} Whoops! Might burp in ya face
A little unladylike, what can I say?
Well oh gosh, I'm not posh, may I wear odd socks
I do what I'm doin - YEAH!
So everybody's entitled to opinions
I open my mouth and shit I got millions
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid
I'll make you giggle 'til ya sick, my nose jiggles when I spit
Yeah I do have some stories, and it's true I want all the glory
Go on then, come on support, I'm English - try and deport me!

[Chorus]

[Lady Sovereign]
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
Love me or hate me.. ah ha ha {*laughing*}

[repeat 2X]
So I can't dance and I really can't sing, yeah
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign

[Chorus] - 2X

[repeat 2X]
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me...
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign</pre>
