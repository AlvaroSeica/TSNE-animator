[Gucci Mane]
I make it look easy (BURR) easy (BURR) easy (BURR)

[Chorus 2X: Gucci Mane]
I make it look easy (BURR)
All my real get money ballers stand up

Ted Smooth, stay face, you remember!

[Busta Rhymes]
They know me as the king of the shine - true!
It's Busta Bust bitch, they call me Stimulus Rhymes boo
Familiar with winning, got you curious times two
Delirious with bread, so serious with what mine do
Conspicuous, you might wanna take a flick of this wine you
I'm sick with this, think you really wanna get with this swine flu?
Ridiculous, with such a maticulous grind, ooh!
Ventriloquist the way niggaz'll spit what I rhyme too
Hah, sometimes it's hard to believe me the way I
come with them classics and make it look easy, and then I
make me this money and spend it so freely, and jet I
corner the market, that's WHEN I

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I make it look easy (BURR)

[Busta Rhymes]
Know what this custom Louie just cost me?
Well if you did you'd probably get your FUCKIN HAND OFF ME!!
This Damier leather chocolate darker than coffee
Starin at the space shuttle, when I pull up and pull off, see
Shorty be properly pushin her ass on me softly
She love the fact that I rep everything that a boss be
The type of boss you should get to know, and never should cross me
Can make certain shit happen, I don't really think you should force me
(OHHHH!!) All the way from the start to the finish, my friend I
be gettin it poppin from the spark 'til they timid, can I
make it look easier than fightin a midget, red eye
off of that kush nigga THEN I

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I make it look easy (BURR)

Tostito make my diamonds, I mingle in high society
And bust a rhyme and rockin custom diamonds
I'm blinded, shit to me is easy grinding
Even if I was signed ain't no need to sign me
Entirely, too turnt up my mind is
Focused on money like the IRS is
I pull up in a stretch Lexus with Texas
Tag so many bricks I cause erections
Lethal injection, electric necklace (bling!)
I'm flexin, so check that off the checklist
I'm hungry, I'm eatin rappers for breakfast
Respect me, one verse it leaves you breathless
I'm rappin on a Biggie beat, they didn't expect this
Fuckin with me expect the unexpected
It's easy, breezy, cover like makeup
Y'all break up to make up, I weigh cook cakes up (Gucci!)

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I make it look easy (BURR)</pre>
