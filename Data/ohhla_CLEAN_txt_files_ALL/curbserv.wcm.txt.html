[Intro: Mack 10]
Uhh, give it up!

[Verse One: W.C.]
Creep, creep, creeping up on ya
From the blind side, fool I'ma put them on ya (UHH!)
Back in the pezzack, to record on deck
The whole Thirty six ounces is hitting, nigga check it
Get down, get down, with the real MCs
Would not to step the fuck up now (NEVER!)
How many niggaz must I kill?
Play hardcore before I start tossing tapes out the window
One, two, three million MCs, everybody is claiming Gs
Nigga please, you're more like Super Chicken
Cause half of y'all is scarier than Bonnie on Eddie Griffin
While you're tripping
Talk the talk, walk the walk
Matter of fact, break yourself on perpetrating
You're on violation
Pump them pump them, pump them pump them
Here I come, get out the water
Fuck around and get your punk ass slaughtered (PUNK!)
Order in the courtroom, order in the court (WHAT?)
Will the defendant please rise for the sentence
Out here by Curity streets
I'm charging all y'all niggaz if he had the first degree (BITCH!)
See for too long, I done stood on the sidewalk
And watched niggaz blow the fuck up like the hawk?? (Fuck that!)
So don't say shit to me, turn your ass over for the toss
So I can break that punk ass off, I'm curb Serving

[Chorus: DJ Crazy Toones Scratching quotes below]
Break them off something ---------------&gt; Ice Cube
Now, it's popping like the firecracker, nigga
I'll break you off something proper ----&gt; Ice Cube
Keep it up rocking, gots to make my profit
Break them off something ---------------&gt; Ice Cube
Now, it's popping like the firecracker, nigga
I'll break you off something proper ----&gt; Ice Cube
So what you need, what you need motherfucker?
Break them off something ---------------&gt; Ice Cube

[Verse Two: W.C.]
Now what's up nigga, I got them Double-ups cracking
Serving all these fake ass radical poor black niggaz (All y'all)
Y'all be killing them softly, talking that talk G (Bullshit)
Nigga where was you around the time of the Peace Treaty?
I'ma be one of the first out shooting
When it comes time for this so-called revolution
So you niggaz need to quit (Quit)
And play like El Melvin in the Blue Notes, miss me with that shit (Bullshit)
Not just sagging, waving them off flagging
Fuck Bill Clinton, I'm still packing; AK-47 and Smitty-14s
Cause guns rule everything around me
Fuck the cream, never would I, would've or could've put it to rest
Cause these little niggaz be out just to get a rep
Look brrrr stick them, down another victim (What?)
Better came to me, a nigga should've had his pistol (Fuck Him!)
Crib, hawk, talk, ready to bust
Cause now what remains is at the dust
May y'all say it's a black thing, but shit I'm with it
But you better tell them little niggaz on my block that shit
Got the hood harder than hard, cars drive-by got me sweating
Double checking, grab the neck and.. (What?)
Increase the peace; Fuck That! increase the heat (Why?)
Cause one of us down, it's either him or me
I'm curb Serving

[Chorus:]

[Verse three: W.C.]
Tan datta dan dan taan, here I come (What?)
Here I come (COME!) that's the thump from the.. lyrical
Ex-criminal; getting physical over instrumental
Tell me; where you're gonna go, where y'all gonna hide? (Nowhere)
When I get to dumping on this vocal drive-by?
Shit! I'm sending niggaz in this pazzums
After that, I'll stretch some rappers like the middle balls on phantasm
I'm coming at them, smacking them, steady tagging them
Like the cold sets and gorge your Adam's Apple
Ain't no escaping; this junkie lyricist is cocking this ripping
Just when I finish you should be like goat sheep
Run Charlie Run! - Fuck what you're saying
The Maad Circle niggaz ain't playing (WEST SIDE!!)
Uhh.. I'm tearing niggaz new ass holes
Fucking up the party as if it was put you on the little rascals
I'm taking it back to the streets (why?)
Cause niggaz that done gone Hollywood on Dub-C..
Must see the money, just making me clown (What?)
Cause like Rolls Royce motherfuckers is going down (I'm Going Down)
So like Patreich now I'm watching their spots
Setting up shots with jams like this, and ?? the game mean not
So if you ever get the ?? of that pure run cock
My shit is guaranteed to get you fucked up!
Dub-C, I'm curb Serving
