"Ladies and gentlemen it's rap time"

[Hardwerk]
Steppin out the motherfuckin dark matter
I see numbers and I talk data
Feel the beat in my heart's pattern
Movin at the speed of the planet's orbit
Breathe in oxygen and absorb it
breathe it out and transform it
My DNA's prehistoric, twisted up and encoded
Mixture of two of those who consented and then consorted
My mind is full of files, it's only I who can sort it
So let me say exactly who I am
I'm a West coast vegan nerd with bad times and with words
that digress, and already spelled shit on my shirt
Just a nice guy, but all the ladies think I'm tryin to flirt
I wish I knew what it was, so I can know how it work
A bookworm, who's hooked on phonics and good herb
I could turn, this verse into something you could learn
After research, but after research, I'd rather teach 'Werk
And I keep shirts, the same color as Greedy Smurf

"Ladies and gentlemen it's rap time"

[Trek Life]
Your albums are dope rap deficient
Them beats sound like they eaten yo' ass alive
I swear to God you shouldn't have a fan that exist
and y''ll don't wanna see my tribe like we canibalistic
If you but any microphone near my hand
I'ma rip it straight up Infirmary style
All my soldiers is the illest
with no known cure or vaccine man we villains
In your system taken over like addiction
Ladies love the diction, that's no pun intended
Y'all went for the sprint and, your campaign is winded
Tried to buy the love spending cash on a friendslist
But that can't cover up the fact you ain't gifted
Who me I'm like Christmas, Hanukkah &amp; kwanza
I sonned y'all daily man I'm kinda like your father
10 steps beyond ya, give y'all GI Janes and Jane Fonda's
with broken down rap lives to ponder

"Ladies and gentlemen it's rap time"

[Bishop Lamont]
I kick the hottest shit ever scene
since the Byzantine empire; verbal menace, part chemist
Spit Greek fire
I be that emcee that emcees secretly admire
Blessed by the Messiah, dressed in regular attire
I live in God's Attic, from the roof I'm even higher
So let's G-O, turn my foes into vegetables
And stir fry it if the weapon blows
Yeah; my demeanor
is a cross between a great white shark and the Grim Reaper
I whisper death through yo' speaker, at low frequencies
See frequently the hoes freak with me, creep with me
If she missin, I might know where yo' bitch could be
Huh~! I've been grand with layer, probably where I lay her
out in Maui, blue waters around me
Waldorf-Astoria, where you clowns ain't be
I'm overdue to celebrate it
Ten years up in this bitch and niggaz hate it
I'm just warming up, incincerate it
Hot 'til I'm sizzlin, pop I'm hot you fizzlin
Your career's slowin down like it's on Ritalin
I begin extend where you faggots end
The Mayans was describin me
New reign of terror bring the whole world catastrophe
I'm so fly bird flu make you sick of me
You niggaz make songs on me, I make history
Been ready, preperation breeds victory
I'm legendary - you rappers ain't shit to me
