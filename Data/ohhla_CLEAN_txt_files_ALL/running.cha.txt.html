[Intro: Chamillionaire]
See me dere reppin for dem Texas down to Naija
And you can trust dem try to crumble the empire
But we go fire, 'til dey expire
See they go run and they go hide but we gon' find ya, find ya
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh, oooh, oooh
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh, umm-de-lum-dela oooooh
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh, mmmm, mmmm
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh (ooooooooh, yeah)
I can never slow down, I'm runnin laps
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh, umm-de-lum-dela oooooh
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh, mmmm, mmmm
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Umm-de-lum-dela ooleloolelooh (ooooooooh)
I can never slow down, I'm runnin laps

[Chamillionaire]
Hold up, first of all
Who the hell you know that's this versatile?
If you don't think that I can get back in my spot
I don't think that you gon' make it into work tomorrow
Or church tomorrow, I murk 'em all
I'm on top of the paper like cursive drawin
You know I'll be the first to be a curse to y'all
Somebody better go and give that black hearse a call
Cause I promise that I'll kill it
while you sittin back on that sofa
I'm tryin to keep the straps in that holster
And I would rather chase the stacks and not chocha
And they stay mad while I'm grinnin
cause I'm doin what they didn't
They losin while I'm winnin
I can never slow down, I'm runnin laps

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
I don't just do it for the H-Town
Gotta do it all for my whole state now, state now, state now
I can never slow down, I'm runnin laps
I don't just do it for the pay now
Gotta do it cause I wanna be great now, great now, great now
I can never slow down, I'm runnin laps
I can't stop, I'll never lay down
And you know the whole world is my playground, playground, playground
Hey, hey, hey

[Interlude: Chamillionaire]
All around the world then back to the tropics
Makin Ben Franks get back in my pocket
Hope you don't think these cats finna stop this
I can never slow down, I'm runnin laps

[Chamillionaire]
All around the world to connect the dough
I'm tryin to tic-tac-toe X the dough
X the dough, X the dough - mmmm, mmmm
If you ain't tryin to help me get the checks to grow
I hope you get familiar with the exit do'
Exit do'... uhh
I came along way from bein next to blow
And movin mixtapes by the Texaco
Texaco... mmm-hmm-hmm
Ya past always gonna try to catch you though
They sky miles couldn't get 'em out to Mexico (no!)
If you don't like me then be the next to go (go!)
Shoot yourself - Plaxico (whoooooa)
Slow money like the meter in a slow cab
That ain't in the vocab
The reason every woman that I know mad
They say I travel way more than a nomad
... And they know that
When I'm showin up, I'm showin up with no bag
It don't matter if you ridin in coach or you ridin in first
Some people got no class
No cash - unlawful
Waste time, realize what it'll cost you
If you ain't showin money like a vault do
You better find somebody else to talk to
When I do it I'ma do it like a boss do (boss)
If you reppin my state then you ought to (why?)
Cause I'ma do it like I'm Mr. Miyagi
And you ain't gon' deny me cause I'm the one that taught you

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Chamillionaire]
These boys tryin to act Hollywood
Better act like y'all know the real
I'ma give y'all that cold shoulder
Let 'em see how my shoulder chill
I don't play games I'm so for real
Lend me yo' ear like Holyfield
I'll shoot yo' buzz up out the sky
Let's just call that overkill
Run away wit it, run away wit it
Try to say I'm not the one, I'm okay wit it
Cause I don't have to get an okay wit it
Home-run, I ain't never gon' base hit it
The people that'll say the kid ain't did it
The people that can never say they did it
Don't see 'em, why they actin like they get it?
I see through 'em, everybody opaque wit it
Opaque wit it, so fake wit it
Beatin on my chest, 'bout to go ape wit it
I don't chase no little dough, it's no taste in it
And if we talkin big dough let's bake wit it
(Hah, hah) That's cake, get it?
Every day is like a Jason skit
Terrorizin everything while I'm chasin it
Makin a killin, not the villain to be racin with
No~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
Now you got to go kill it (kill it)
Now it's time to come wit it (wit it)
Now it's time to go get it
I can never slow down, let's run some laps
