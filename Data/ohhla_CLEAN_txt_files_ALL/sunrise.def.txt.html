[Intro]
The night has been so dark and cold 
I want to walk all alone in the sunrise
In the sunrise

[Tonedeff]
Hey-ye, hey-ye, hey-ye
When the day is done 
And I can't breathe, no I can't see 
No, no with my eyes on fire 
Yeah, with my eyes on fire
Oh, I feel like I'm working every single day of the week 
And I can't sleep, no no, with my heart on fire
Yeah, with my heart on fire

[Chorus]
The night has been so dark and cold 
I want to walk all alone in the sunrise
In the sunrise, oh
The night has been so dark and cold 
I want to walk all alone in the sunrise
In the sunrise

[Tonedeff]
Do you wanna live? I wanna remember what it feels like 
To be embedded in a real life 
When the deal's dicey and it's evident it's another surreal night
Then I'm f'in to check if the lid on my head is sealed 
I would give anything to replenish the dream inside 
Tethered together by a steal line  
Drawing it's heat from the light, deprived, reaching for Helio's height 
Leaning without a means to survive, till the ceiling divides 
I hid every bit of esteem and concealed it inside 
Cause when you need to feed on it, then it eats you alive 
Cause when you believe that you're right and nobody's seeing your side 
You tend to agree - I don't need another reason to die
People can turn a blind eye and you've gotta pardon them 
When your character flaw is a self-imposed martyrdom 
Part of the prob is shock it exists 
It's seen but never felt like a victim describing a shot to a witness
Isn't this just coincidence? The shit's a mess 
Missing photosynthesis in this den I'm imprisoned within
It's a sin as I wither away
As if business will give me the pleasure that flickers and fades as I live in this haze 
I wanna be riddled with millions of rays on the skin of my face 
Till the cinnamon pigment is colored crimson in shade 
And I've been in the gray and I'm sick of waiting 
And I don't want to wonder anymore if the sun has risen today

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In the sunriiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiise...

In the sunrise, in the sunrise {repeat in background}

Let the sun rise on
Let it shine on 
Until it burns away</pre>
