Typed by: Chppshop@hotmail.com

Wakin shakin the early morn
Playa Flizay you know its on
Nappy Hair and some golden teeth
Fly be in to the fuckin ball
Blunja stay up in the air
Fuck the square its not good for me
Everything growing green is good
But Newports gone tear my teeth
Heres a seldom look at me cause thats just not so cool to Fly
Check the definition 
Nappy hair all you will see as I 
Lookin mean with the golden gleam
Nosey suckas read and weep
Regroupin bustas that dare to stare like im just some big site to see
Flowin straight from funky t-izo
Fly full of plenty game
Fly predicts me
Fly aint trippin I roll wit some ballas mayne
Gorilla pimpin Fly spit to get up on funky ho
Flizay hair may be rough and tough but that just don't matter doe
Standing on the track playa fly grilling on you tricks
Playa lookin wild so I style and its evident
Staying on my level theres so many hoochies choosing me
Golden child is styling and profiling with 
NAPPY HAIR AND GOLD TEETH

-chorus- 

Nappy headed youngster who's a monster in the studio
Flowing it in dope and it in nappy hair is on the go
Yo I blo wit golden gleam
Wonder do you know what Fly mean
I attract plenty of attention when public people are listening
Education youll be tasting times a wasting prejudging me
You open up yo ear you wanna hear it I guarantee
-Why do you wear your hair like that?
Why do Fly have to cut it
-I like them golden teeth you got
Well if you like it I love it
And now im grinning at you tricks
Dont think Fly rich cause you see my golds
If I know something you dont know game is sewed
And I told hizo crown, evil frown
Start to spread from town to town
If you growing nappy rolls you and playa super down
If you dont you super cool thats just what this playa do
Plain and simple Fly remember ever since I was only two
Same old rough and tougha hairdo
That suits me to a tizzy
But later on I added a touch of class
My gold teeth

-chorus- 

Flizay has no idol
Playa title placed before my name
Grilling just to gleam
And wit no meaning I was born wit fame
Profile so low key mizayne
Nonchalant without a care
Playa dont dress to impress, but love to wear my nappy hair
Snizort sneezing
Blizunt blinking
Thinking of a master plan
A nappy headed playa joan
Iz-out from the crowd I stand
In a very solo clan 
Wiz-one of a kind its me
Sport yo trizack, fade, or curl but Fly gone wear mine naturally
Happily is how I be strolling in a lonely world
Girls who scoping everywhere saying itll be cute if he had a curl
On my hair I twist and twirl when im B-O-A-R-D 
Even when im on that funk or thinkin bout Fly H-O-G
Believe me when I tell you so that Flizay love my nappy hair
And love to see my gizold beamin, hate to see them bustas starin
Hizo you should now knizow
Why the playa so unique 
Partially not only me ho cause my nappy hair and gold teeth
