Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now they sippity, brothers kickin me everyday
Why thy fuckin plottin on mine? Touchin my 5 grades
A girl's face, friend of mine say yea I came
They such a drag but they say it's a nay nay
Stevie Wonder had them visual problems
It's a wonder my 20-20's can see tomorrow
You 20 something, those rockets jumpin like Vietnam
As mama be within me importantly grip tighter

Ain't no hope for a young nigga
Ain't no goals for a young nigga
Too short for a sport nigga
That be horrific, we glorifyin them drug dealers

Yea, so where yo keys at Playboy?
I sling high, purple leafs at a warp speed
Usain Bolt runnin from ready set bang go
Throw it out my face, nothing the bank doin
I paid for em, they layin more that I paid more
The X showin to sell your love, try to thank do it
I must influence some better music, let the hate show up
When ladies show up we make noise, that mechanic noise
Coke boys, just stay up on em, wants to get em open
Go and slaughter, haters trading thoughts with brain storms
We all existing for dreams whether music a ball
Wonder who in the song or simply pursuing them all
Just paint a picture, I'll ignore the mission
Have my fun at district everything but monumental
I ain't gotta mention all the little flaws
Where the stairs it's the boys, ride on heart to follow politicians
And they marrying yo bro, yea I have Barry Saunders
Nother one that be gangster, put them dirty pads up
The mad route, try and get my pants off
The stash bright, I was mastering with the slam walk
Slide out, I ain't right, double white offs
Is the rhyme got the whole city taking my row
Taking my row
Hey nigga that is my house

Black hero
Ain't no black hero

Ain't no hope for a young nigga
Ain't no goals for a young nigga
Too short for a sport nigga
That be horrific, we glorifyin them drug dealers

Ain't no goals for a young nigga
Too short for a sport nigga
That be horrific, we glorifyin them drug dealers
Ain't no goals for a young nigga
Too short for a sport nigga

Say we all get
We all get aha
And we all and we all and we all
And we all get aha
And we all and we all and we all..

And I wrote this album without a care in the world
But the outcome as long as long it's an out pour of em
Came out they downfall like an overblown round ball before my sound off
Or maybe this music will inspire a future mountain mover or two
And if I ever rush more music out to you
Then know that I'm overworking myself 'cause my heart and mind into it
Ain't been a black hero since Robert Townsend
So for meeting your man I hope you found something profound
and enough to expand on before the sound falters
Ha ha, before the sound falters</pre>
