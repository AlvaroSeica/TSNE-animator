Song:   Be Alright
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah (be alright [X3])
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The earth is spinning and your still living
And Im still saying that its gonna be alright

I say everything is good in this beautiful life
And todays the day you know that shines so bright
Only time for love and never no time to fight
Lets all get together and enjoy the life, we doing big things
And we say so great
We on that red eye flight, we erase all the hate
And there is no better place than this right now
And there no better time than in this town

All things in life happen for a reason
No teasing, no making believing, the spice of life is not a season
As long as theres air in sky and Im breathing then Im fine
I gonna drink a little wine in the evening
And when Im leaving I hope you smile like Jackie Gleson
Im telling jokes, cheesing, nobody grieving
Let this be a lesson, change it comes with the seasons
Everything gonna be alright
Lets start to the singing

Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The sun is shining the wind is still blowing
And it good between me and you (you and I)
Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The earth is spinning and your still living
And Im still saying that is gonna be alright

I know I drink way to much party way to hard
Smoke so much weed out these with my 215 card
Its legal now for us to medicate, what is justice use?
I'm gonna blaze anyway, really folks life is way too short, to
Spend life in jail and wind up back up in court, So I stay lit
Take my time, I 'm a man of peace, connecting words that rhyme
I know stress and pressure can get you down
The system is design to see us drown
And when the waves get big you got to learn how to surf
You can shoot down the line and fine peace on earth
So let the music play and the challis bubble
Pass the doobie to the left hand side its gonna be alright

Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The sun is shining the wind is still blowing
And it good between me and you (you and I)
Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The earth is spinning and your still living
And Im still saying that is gonna be alright

It gonna be alright
Its gonna be just fine
When the days turn night and the starts a line
Dont Let them bring you down [X2]

It gonna be alright
Its gonna be just fine
When the days turn night and the stars a line
Dont Let them bring you down (everything changes)
Dont Let them bring you down (everything changes)

Been in a lot of situations man I've been in a pinch
When I'm sneaking 10 yards noone gave me an inch
And no one cares that I'm under attack
Nobodies watching my back
Nobody matters its simple as that
When you think you know somebody, truth is that you don't
I've learned a 100 times over trust know one and I won't
I'm done looking for the good staying closer to my hood
Thinking what the world need from me if only I could
I will stand up and fight just for the never ending party
And each all the times I'm inviting everybody
Bring your best energy and play it on slow-mo
Enjoy the right make the most of your solo
The world is open for the taken and I'm a stuff my face
Fill my pockets full of bread bring every race
Smoke weed have fun only waking at night
Knowing that I can rest easy and feel alright yeah

Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The sun is shining the wind is still blowing
And it good between me and you (you and I)
Everything is gonna be alright now
Everything is gonna be alright yeah
The earth is spinning and your still living
And Im still saying that is gonna be alright

It gonna be alright
Its gonna be just fine
When the days turn night and the stars a line
Dont Let them bring you down (everything changes)
Dont Let them bring you down (everything changes)

It gonna be alright
Its gonna be just fine
When the days turn night and the stars a line
Dont Let them bring you down (everything changes)
Dont Let them bring you down (everything changes)</pre>
