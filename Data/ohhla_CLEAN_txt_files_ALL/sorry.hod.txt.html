[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uhh
O.F.
Yeah, yeah
Hodgy Beats, O.F.

[Hodgy Beats]
I want to apologize first and foremost
That donkey on me cause of clothes in my wardrobe
I got a lot of butter, spread it on more toast
and I seem to catch groupies when I rock more shows
They scatter and screamin while I'm runnin away
I run for the +Future+ when they run for today
I run for the money, I be chasin the hay
And hay is for horses, in the way I am sorta
the differences between wat don't matter and what's important
Through all the backward static and distortion
The ladies don't force him
They are assigned to a mission, and Hodgy aborts them
When I try to get past but ghost, there's more of them
I know you don't trust none of them
It's all in your head be sure of them
Because baby girl you're the cure for him
You make him born again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry - please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay
Girl I apologize, please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay
I apologize, please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay
Girl I apologize, please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay

[Hodgy Beats]
Look, I use to cheat in the streets
Hotels and suites, cheat in the sheets
Skeet on her teeth, freak for the leap
Then it leaks in the heat, he greets her when it meets
She ready, to pick up somethin heavy
Slow your horses, steady before you hop into the Chevy
I wanna be faithful, for your love I'm grateful
But it's hard, and hard you can relate too
When the girls be beggin on
Getting in my head eggin on, I'm wakin in the bed with thongs
You ringin on my doorbell, DING-DONG
They better get gone, on the double
... I'm already in trouble
And if you open the door, you burstin all bubbles
I swear I wish I never cuddled
cause from the bottom of my heart, I love you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay
Girl I apologize, please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay
I apologize, please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay
Girl I apologize, please don't go away
If you leave I'ma chase cause I want you to stay

You know baby, I really apologize
I'm sorry for everything that I done
But these women, they just be on me
I can't help but to, look the other way
I mean it's hard to look, the other way
If you understand what I'm talkin 'about
But... I'ma do my best to try and keep you
I'm sorry</pre>
