[Intro]
YEAH~!! Yo 4th, you killin 'em
It's fuckin war!
The only reward of those who make war pile 'em up
And his messanger, inscribed as the corruption of the land
will be that that they will be killed or crucified
Or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut of
Or will be expelled out of the land
Such will be their degradation
In the world, and in the hereafter
Theirs will be an awful boon

[Vinnie Paz]
If you listen to me then you know my father was G
And the apple don't fall too far from the tree
Me and you is different as we could possibly be
Me and you is just different philosophically
I don't think it's anybody as obnoxious as me
I don't think that anybody else could parted the sea
I don't think that you wanna discuss the horror with me 
If I was you I'd move a little bit more farther from me
It ain't nobody livin more of a sergeant than me
It ain't nobody alive more of a prophet than me
It ain't nobody livin possibly rockin with me
On the stage, in the studio, or boxin with me
Every second I'm awake there is a toxin in me
Anti-depressants, Suboxone, Oxycontin in me
Only a stupid motherfucker have a problem with me
Cause he don't know I got the fuckin problem solver with me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I was washed in the blood of the lamb
Whoever touches my hand, gwan leave nuff blood in the sand
I was washed in the blood of the lamb
Whoever fuck with my fam - sufferin, a muh'fucker should scram

[Vinnie Paz]
I slaughter anything I get my hands on
Inside the Church of Anton with bloody pants on
I was in the land of Israel and heard ram's horn
I was in the sand with Ishmael and fought sandstorm
I'm just waitin for the raven to thaw
Cause I don't argue with Mesopotamian law
I submit my will and faith into the grace of Allah
And the Mayan calendar say it's erasin us all
The four-fifth you should see this thing, it's berserk
And y'all are royalty inside a fuckin kingdom of dirt
How are y'all original when y'all ain't think of it first?
I just wish I could put everything I think into verse
But instead I decide to drink in a Russian bar
I'm Rasputin, I'm influencin a Russian Tsar
I'm Dave Lombardo on drums leave the percussion scarred
I drink the bottle to the bottom put my trust in God

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Kill them whenever you confront them
And drive them out from where they drove you out
For though killing is sinful
wrongful persecution is even worse than killing
Do not fight against them near the holy mosque
unless they fight against you
But if they fight against you, KILL THEM~!
For that is the reward of such unbelievers
Pazienza, 4th Disciple, the assassin's creed
