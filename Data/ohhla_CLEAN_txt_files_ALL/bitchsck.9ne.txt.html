Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I will mistake your bitch sickness gets dismissed with the quickness
this nipsit get the lipstick kiss this dick... [x2]

[Verse 1]
This is the beginning
I only been it for winning
Through every inning
Till the ending chase g's these pretty women
Are just here to make my ride a full course with all the trimmings
Women in my water tank and drinkin henn and lemon
Its realistic you got ur twisted lifted off the feet
I keep 6 clips with my heat like I'm enlisted
nigga this is far from the army navy or marines
we forming the gravy newly recruit criminal team
To make the green
fuck you fakers my eyes dreamy
for that
2000 years we doors like lamborghinnis or carrera porche
still enforced ones with flava
bitch save the royal playas don't hate an innervator...

[Verse 2]
U gotta disease nigga
so please ease away from me's nigga
my feas ease be's about that cheese nigga
your PH balanced for a man but made for the woman lets understand this
niggas backwards ish hop when do the shit stop nigga like a land lets live and learn
about to playa hate when a nigga get his Gs
flippin hella keys
fuckin bitches money got the riches when the other mitches working miccy d's
I done seen niggas straight hate me
mean mug me
wanna slug me
currency thickness due to the bitch sickness
this tecca nina
niggas hate me thinking that they're grass is greena
they the tortoise and I'm the huffin hyeena
never dealin witta bitch
nigga this one goes to the bitch ones hoes
this one flows like a quick gun blows when the bitch shit unfolds

[Chorus]
I will mistake your bitch sickness gets dismissed with the quickness
this nipsit get the lipstick kiss this dick... [x2]

[Verse 3]
When the bullets fly squat knee high
like magnum P.I. lace my chucks up vest up this life is messed up they the fake on a playa hata
low like snake beat a snitch to beat the cakes its straight laugh at your wake
ur outta shape to take the H you been losing the race couldn't keep the pace butta hates just seeling ur fate
talkin wut you at wut you gone do
like you the man
bumpin two bazooka tools in a dented trans am you living dreams
like a crack fiend who say he clean
when we riding beams you steam we drunk off lean
life for riches
gold diggas havin finesse
put a slug to ur chest with that bitch sickness

[Verse 4]
I hit it high I got it so go get this with the quickness
I'm anti biotics for that bitch sickness a few [?]
I spot it the scope made them open they mouth to see if mah [?] dick fit
bitch nip this shit in the butt split or split twist above flick the bic light
let my lips hit the but ain't no trying.... the bud brains on drugs
investigate a over resperator rain unplugged
since I'm ballin rhyme they all in mine for this one love
you ain't knowing this R&amp;G prodegy is building flowin
dope selling to the paper touch the ceiling...

[Chorus]
I will mistake your bitch sickness gets dismissed with the quickness

[Verse 5]
A menace in this business for this village stack of papers

[Verse 6]
These niggas copy cat practicing
