[Intro: Joe Pesci sample]
You don't my money for me, I'll
Crack your fucking head wide open
In front of everybody in the bank
And just about the time that I'm coming out of jail
Hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma
And guess what? I'll split your fucking head open again
Cuz I'm fucking stupid, I don't give a fuck about you
That's my business, that's what I do

"So come on and chiggity-check yourself, before you wreck yourself" - Ice
Cube sample

[Shawn Wigs]
Get out of line, and you might disrespect yourself
Get backed down and layed up in I.C.U.
I want my money, told you, I ain't playing with you
Cash is green and I ain't got time got games
I'm like, Boston George when I'm flying them planes
It's all games, now you wanna to try and cut my prophet
I have you, slapped in a coma and dug out your pockets
In the bank, while you there for a cash deposit
I got, boxes of loot, just stashed in my closet
But you ain't paying yo bids, you fucking with Wigs
Now I gotta go look for your kids
Have my goons just pull in your crib, take your jewels
And your "Audio Two" like they Milk and Giz

[Chorus: Ice Cube sample (Shawn Wigs)]
"So come on and chiggity-check yourself, before you wreck yourself
(Chiggity, check yourself, before you wreck yourself, yeah boy)
Yeah, come on, check yourself, before you wreck yourself
(Cuz fucking with Wigs is bad for you health)</pre>
