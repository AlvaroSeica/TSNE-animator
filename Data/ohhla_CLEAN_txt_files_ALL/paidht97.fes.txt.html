[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Yo, Real Deal, what's good baby
L.I.S., Lon Dini, it's Fes Taylor, your baby
Yeah, uh-huh

[Fes Taylor]
I said Fes got rhymes for days, dudes you don't know
Nothing talking bout crime don't pay
Get money I'mma find a way, either with
Nines or AK's, or I'm buying the yae
Might see me in the O, then I fly to the A
Drive back to N.Y. and my pilot'll bathe
She a bad bird, just came home, and I hard bird
Got cash out rappers buying my adverb
Grown man, still might cry cuz my past hurt
Before I shed a tear, I'll murder your ass flow though
Flirt with a short skirt, right for the Jag' murk
You a broke dude, jersey cost more than your cash worth
Sneakers don't come out til next year, 300 dollar bottle
Of Remi, you sippin' Beck's beer
Son, just wait til my check clear
Buy the Staten Island Yankee Stadium, I'm putting the Mets there
Park Hill, ate and I slept here, hell yeah I rep here
Place where they only respect fear
Real Deal gave me a budget, labels is fronting
I made it, they hating, it's nothing, I love it
Aiyo, throw the tape up in the deck, I spit it for the projects
Homeboy, what you expect?
Listen, son, L.I.S. and Tuff is next
They both bought Cadillacs, me? I jump up in the 'vette
Aiyo, the m&amp;m and Esca' vroom, I'm putting down
Money on the house, so you can rest your dome
I'm the best when I bless the chrome, illest with the microphone
I ain't waiting next for the throne
Medieval rhymes, kidnap kings and queens
Swords and horses, replaced with guns and limosines
When I come for your team, see if you can run from the beam
I do it for the love of the green
I mean if CREAM don't come with your dream
Then somebody wake me, how can I sleep, pray like stray sheep
Wolf Pack, Fes Taylor, the gangsta, I got ya'll
Two 4 War, son, that's the reason I shop for
Pop off, killing mad beats, blow your top off
Soon as we drop in stores, I'mma be the top dog</pre>
