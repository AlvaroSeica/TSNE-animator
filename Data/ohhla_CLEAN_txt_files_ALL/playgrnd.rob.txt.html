[Lil Rob - almost whispering]
Girl I just wanna conversate
You're leavin wit'cha friends, yeah well they can wait
They look cool but I'm into you
You look like you're into me too
You can do what you do
Leave with them or stay with me and break some rules
(Let's break some rules)
C'mon girl, you're old enough to choose
What's it gonna be, your friends or me?
(Is it gonna be your friends or me?)
See we can have a lot of fun
With them the night's over with me the night's just begun
Finish up that Coke and rum
I wanna lick you up with my magic tongue
I saw you, I said she's the one
Hopin you saw me and said he's the one
Fuck it, let's get the fuck on
Back to the pad and get our fuck on

[Chorus One: Lil Rob]
We can have a lot of fun, between the sheets
Let me get naughty wit'cha body come lay next, to me
And we can share a night of ecstasy, oh how the sex would be
Now lay back and leave the rest, to me

[Chorus Two: Lil Rob]
We can head back to the pad if you want to
If you want me just as bad as I want you
I just wanna show you how it goes down in my playground (playground)
You can act as bad as you want to (as bad as you want to)
Go ahead and scream, I won't stop you
I just wanna show you how it goes down in my playground

[Lil Rob - almost whispering]
I lay you down on the cama
When I hit it, I hit it con ganas{?}
Your eyes look like you're in a trance-ah
I make your body twitch when I lick your pants-ah
Make your body shake when I go down lower
How much can you take girl before it's over
Sexy how you scream and giggle
Have you back that ass up with a little wiggle
Ooh girl, you turn me on
Kick your panties off but keep your heels on (keep your heels on)
Foreplay will keep you smilin
Keep you wet so I can slide right in
You're better than I imagined
Now turn around and arch your back end
No more than physical attraction
Satisfaction guaranteed with no attachments

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Lil Rob - almost whispering]
We met deep in the ci-ty, now we're deep in the sheets
There's no bet-ter feelin than when our bo-dies meet
{?}Parive pavajo{?}, we rocked and we rolled
Como, dos animales fuckin out of control
