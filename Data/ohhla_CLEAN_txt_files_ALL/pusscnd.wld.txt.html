[Intro: Willie D]
Here's something for you fraudulent ass niggaz
Uhh.. signing loyalty contracts
You motherfuckers is bitch
Taking a nigga kindness for weakness
Wishing I knew, some of y'all niggaz was whores
Smiling under the frown turned it upside down
Watch these niggaz, peep their asses!

[Chorus: Baby Girl, Ms. Mel X4]
Pussy in the click, pussy in the click
I got a motherfucking pussy in my click 

[Verse One: Willie D]
Say nigga, you'se a whore if I ever seen one
Pay me my fucking dough, when I see you there son
Clear the way, What the fuck was coming out of that fool's mouth?
Here comes the realest nigga down south
Yeah, Have you ever had a nigga in your motherfucking click
Claiming that he real, but he's a motherfucking bitch?
Acting all hard, nigga can't squab
Give that bitch your dope and watch his ass get robbed "Get That Shit"
Gotta watch my back, cause these niggaz are making dirty moves
Screaming that they're down, when in fact, they're hating on the crew
Call me a fool, but I roll on them sons of bitches
And I don't give a fuck about the consequences
I'm jumping fences, it's me, the police is trying to fat me
Cause my motherfucking homie downtown rapping
Homicidal, ideas, crossing my mind
Bitches calling my parole, officer lying
Can't seem to find a true pearl
You say you're down with me, but trying to fuck my girl
Thought you was real nigga, but you fake as shit
Yo, girlish ways make you a pussy in the click

[Chorus: Baby Girl, Ms. Mel X4]

[Overlapping the chorus]
You'll never know, you know what I'm saying?
Niggaz turned pussies these days, you gotta keep an eye on the click
You gotta keep a tight eye on them niggaz, cause niggaz'll set you up
Niggaz don't shit but fucking with your money to make it
Set you up, ride on you, pussy in the click ass nigga
Willie D, tell them..

[Verse Two: Willie D]
Remember when you brought whores to my crib, and vice versa
After the club getting pussy on the dresser
Fucking in the same room, that's how it was
If I had a quarter, it was yours
Like a crackhead and his pipe, me and you was tight
So fucking close, we even dressed alike
You used to say, Fuck L.L. and Run-D.M.C.
They can't fuck with my nigga Willie D "Stright Up"
But then I started making money, and you started acting funny
Telling people I changed, speaking bad on my name
But I'm the same, motherfucker, that saved your life
When them killers, was trying to get you; at the club that night
Coming off tour, kicking you down on the strength
Bought your kids Christmas gifts; and paid your goddamn rent
I can't believe all the shit you said; putting my business in the sewer
Gossiping like a bitch, nigga you are.. Pussy in the click!

[Chorus: Baby Girl, Ms. Mel X4]

[Overlapping the chorus]
You ain't never got aware, I got your back nigga
I know that shit ??, I'm down with you to the end homeboy
Straight up nigga, I'm down for life
Hooked to the end nigga, just me and you, you ain't got a worry about

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Fraud niggaz, stay out of my reach, capisc'
And get your own shit like Lil' Kim, you're goddamn leech
Don't make me preach, cause I can talk about this shit for days
Chive-hearted bastards and their bitchy ways
These niggaz out for self, they can't be trusted
In your face when you got paper, but where they at when you busted?
Well adjusted to riding solo, who needs a friend
When every nigga and his mammy trying to win on the end
I fight by myself, get drunk by myself
Smoke weed by myself, cause I don't need no fucking help
Watch your step, cause loyalty is taught to locate
From the streets, to the suites, everybody so fake
Snake in the grass, I see your ass, and it's trembling black
We ran a train on that whore, and you keep doubling back
Now we don't speak, but it ain't my fault you fell in love with that bitch
Down to play, now you stuck with a pussy in the click

[Chorus: Baby Girl, Ms. Mel X4]

[Outro]
Bitch ass niggaz, yeah
Yeah Willie, fuck these niggaz, man
These niggaz ain't about you, man
These niggaz is about self, you know what I'm saying?
These niggaz don't wanna see you come up
Every man is out for his motherfucking self these days
Don't nobody give a fuck, niggaz out here perpetrating and frauding this shit
You know, nigga gets himself x-ed out the game real fast
We ain't got time for that bullshit, these niggaz is out to make money
If you ain't out to make money, stay the fuck out this nigga reach
You understand what I'm saying?
Willie motherfucking D
Nigga, we don't fuck with them hoe-pussy ass niggaz that's in the click
But you'll never know, in your click
You can have the vary same pussy ass motherfucker
Biting, roting, snitching on motherfuckers
Trying to fuck them bitches, you know what I'm saying?
Fucking your game up, fuck these niggaz
Willie D be right, man, these motherfuckers were pussy ass niggaz, man
Fuck them, fuck them, fuck these niggaz, man
Fuck them, you know what I'm saying?
