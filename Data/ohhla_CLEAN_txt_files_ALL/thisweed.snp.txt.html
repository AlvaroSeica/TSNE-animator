[Snoop Dogg]
I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smokin on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy, envy, please don't feel bad
This weed is mine, get your own bag
A sack full of O-G under lock and key
None for the homies, this is all for me
Got a blunt lookin like a Cali palm tree
Police roll by, I got nothin on me~!
(Oh oh) Cause the smoke's already in the air
I'm loc'ed up with two braids in my hair
All-star with the khaki suit
I'ma fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the Eastside standin on the V.I.P.
Back then the only red was my E-Y-E
You's a P.Y.T., and you lookin so fine
I'm sorry baby girl but tonight

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine, you can't have it
This weed is mine!
This weed is mine, you can't have it
This weed is mine

[Snoop Dogg]
(Back-back) Back to the episode, sacks full of chronic
Out of this world, could relax on a comet
This is church music, listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire!
D-O-double-G like never heard before
Smokin that bomb like THC4
West Coast worldwide, seashore to seashore
When's the last time you seen a G in a G4?
(Oh oh) Don't worry, I'll wait
Time's tickin, I'm trippin, I'm slippin away
into a zone where these hoes on my Dogg bone
A Dogg whistle and they download my ringtone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine, go and get your own
I put beats to rhymes, get peace of mind
O-Z's to dimes, and this weed is mine

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, I - hear niggaz talkin 'bout what they rollin up
Smell what I smoke 'fore the bag open up
Good chance if you see me there I'm smokin one
License to get it from the man who roll the shit
Real nigga blowin weed for I's zonin up
If I'm in the buildin it's hard not to notice it
Hit up Willy, said dawg I got some hoes to fuck
I'ma fall through with a ounce of that potent shit
(Oh oh) Don't trip
Bitch, we gon' all sip, blow the whole zip
Let you hit mine, plus you supplyin your own lil' bit
My nigga get high and let the hoes twist
Say you don't fuck with twist, look how you rolled it
They ain't smokin like ours
I'm rollin up papers, they be burnin for hours
And if it's fire, I'm smokin the whole thing entire
Hahahaha, yeah!

[Chorus]

[LaToiya Williams]
I got a blunt for you
Do ya, wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke wit'chu
Do ya, wanna smoke with me?
I got a blunt for you
Do ya, wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke wit'chu
Do ya? Do ya? (Do ya?)
Do ya, wanna smoke with me?
I said I wanna smoke with you
Do ya, wanna smoke with me? (This weed is mine)
I wanna smoke with you</pre>
