Song:   Back Down (Running Out of Time)
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Al Pacino "Scarface" sample (Trife Diesel)]
All I have in this world, is my balls and my word
And I don't break 'em, for no one, jou understand?
(Running out of time, nigga... this is real hip hop
This is real hip hop, Trife Da God, uh-huh, yeah)

[Trife Diesel]
Aiyo, leave the guns, and the crack, and the knives, alone
T.M.F.'s on your microphone
Bum rushin' and pushin', smackin', what's cracking?
This shit is not a game, ya'll niggas don't see me laughing
S-T-A-R-K-S, Starks Enterprise, Trife Da God, in the flesh
T.M.F., Theodore Unit, we gonna do it
Pack heat, and tackle a beat, like Ray Lewis
Ya'll niggas better face the music, and back down
Cuz I ain't got shit, but a click and a black pound
State to town, yo, my beard's is grizzly, get busy
That's right, and the'll put you on ice, like Walt Disney
Walk with me, now, and strap on your boots firmly
Tredding through the field, it's gonna be a long journey
Keep a "Mack" like Bernie, niggas act like Ernie
Fuck Sesame Street, we bring the heat to attorney's
And my team stay, close like, fraternity brothers
While ya'll niggas pull guns and try to turn on each other
I deserve me a standing ovation
So recognize, nigga, what you facing, this is real

[Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo, ten straight rappers, I'm guilty, verbal assassin
Microphone fiend, my heart beat with passion
Thirty pairs of J's, one pair of boots
Eleven tracks straight, I'mma murder these loops
Break beats, Beat Street, don't fuck with freaks
Got a rainbow of flavors, I shit style for weeks
Coconut shrimp, playboy, hustle a nigga like Larry Flynt
More fur than pimps, more bars than Riker's, more chains than bikers
Work hard, and stop try'nna be just like us
Your half baked, twelve bar verse is elementary
Thirteen years, my style is penetentiary
Rock hard cherry heads, knock the big numbers
See life is like math, and everything equals something</pre>
