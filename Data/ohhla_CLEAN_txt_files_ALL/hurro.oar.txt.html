[Sample]
Let me say something about language
We're discussing sexuality
Not everyone is comfortable talking about the sex
We'll use words you may not be accustomed to
But we do this to clarify, not to shock
We hope that our openess with permission given for you
We hope to help you to open the lines of sexual communication
Between you and your partner

[Verse 1: Sesta]
Alright listen 
You're better commitive the lyricism is insane
Then suck a dick vien like Venom leaving em in pain
Quit the laying I been sayin I'm feelin like Rick James
These fingers itching to get at ya click, face slap!
You can't better the rapper that had a speech inpediment
Now he's badder then Mike Jack-son with someone's son
Getting him drunk, feeling him up
Feeling generous? (heh, give him a fuck)
Yeh I lost it my rap here's still so so
Posing in promo photos fuckin homo's
Into chicks over dosing getting close n 
Then I'm leaving em looser than popes clothing
I poke her face with a poker face
On the first date talking about your supposed to wait
Fuck that I'ma Funkoar, hopeless waste of space
Toast to Sesta eight breakin it great

[Verse 2: Hons]
Now we a hard act to follow
Ask ya girl I got a hard cock to swallow
While I swipe half ya bottle and we back for round 2
So let the speaker sound booth
polute everybody in the club thats around you
Meet Mr. E grade celebrity 
who'se sick of dog cunts that are posing as a pedigree
Fuck them I should open scars
Like the Funkoars loose at an open bar
And that only rap about tits and arse for sure
Cos if a oar in your bitch then that bitch in awe
Yeh so check it, this shits become too effortless
My rhyme books pages rival that of the New Testiment
I been charmin since Bush been after Bin Laden
Ghetto pimpin in the club with rip garments
And she still cop the stage dick
And sex sells thats the reason oars always drop your A-list

[Verse 3: Trials]
Ay well let me set it straight, then come n twist up the weather vein
24th of the 5th 83 set a date
Mr. T's name deep in the streets
Beef with me is like a three week lease on your teeth
In a few years trust me nothing has changed
Besides the fact bitches never use my government name n
stand rank n god damn fuck I'm handsome
If the hat leak seed then the skeeze hand standin
Women want a piece of the beast, rappers want a piece of the beats
and faggots want peace in the streets
'Til the cops kick the door, Funkoars 
Pockets sworn raise hell like Robert Thorne with dumb borns 
A good man is hard to find
Says who? take another look at sister she and there's two 
How dare you compare you to F-U-N-K oars
