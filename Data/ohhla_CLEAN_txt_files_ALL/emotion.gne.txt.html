"I wish that I had been there to hold you when you passed from life to
death, but I guess it was meant to be that way: you were always alone.  I
hope you were not scared.  You're in a better place now with the Lord, that
we love, and you are whole.  I miss you.  I'll never forget you.  I love you
yesterday, today, and forever.  Love always, your daughter."

Why does God let good people suffer, and bad people prosper?
My grandma loved me more than anybody on this planet
She let me know it and I think that's why she landed
The way she lived was just a little bit different now
Call her crazy, diagnosed schizophrenic, Wow
She was a patient at a hospital for most her life
And when she wasn't she was fuckin' with somebody's life
She used to lock my mama in the basement for no reason
The same basement we made meats in and peace in
If that's all I ever got from her I loved her for it
But it's not, she always thought that Cory was the purest
She built me up and let me know it like I needed to
Grandma I learned from you and also how they treated you
They would pump you full of drugs like you was a horse
So many drugs you ain't never coming home for sure
Now when we visit, are you lying? Are you telling the truth?
Grandpa ain't the enemy, he just didn't know how to deal with you
I guess what's out of sight is out of mind
I know it's true because that's how I kept you out of mine
Your body was strong though
You was in it for the long haul, on call, waitin' for God to take you
Devil tryin' to break you but you never let up
Just recited that Bible to the end, you was tough
Your life was rough, and your pain was real
You hurt for us, and now I know the deal
You had cancer, Parkinson's, arthritis
Non-stop shakin' you couldn't fight shit twenty-plus years
This verse is not enough for what you went through, and what you meant to
Brings to me tears
You helped me be who I am today
You live inside of this man I pray
Forgive me I ran away, I know you understand though
Because we all live for a reason, one of yours was thought to grow
(faint) Thanks

My earliest memory of you was in the ocean tides
The current pulled me under the water up above my eyes
I was a little guy, just a little shy, my younger days
Lookin' at you and it makes me wander the beach just like you; phase it
Last the song: you was the strongest person that I knew
Growing up thinking I was stunted every time I grew
You put a red notch on the doorway in the laundry room
Making you proud was the main achievement I pursued
And when I quit and threw in the towel, man it ripped me up
To see the look on your face when you came to class to pick me up
Now I see you just wanted me to follow through
A lesson in life that's more important than to follow you
I remember that time in life: that warehouse, you were workin' nights
Two men came in to rob the place and almost took your life
You showed them pictures of your son and daughter: "Let me live"
The cry you must've gave while staring down a 12-guage
And for a moment in time they put you in a birdcage
And for that moment in time you didn't have a word to say
Playing catch with you in the backyard were the funner times
Runnin' around the baseball diamond were the funnest times
And I remember the word "divorce" scorched my corpse for remorse
Where the fighting in the hallway and the slamming door now I'm seeing you
on the weekend forever for, but that's the score
Now that's a common day occurrence, in the United States
The love was lost, but now it's found again for you to stay
And now you're working every day to get that mortgage paid
Blue collar to the bone
Spend your days away from home
Wish today would be the one
Twist a greater beamin' sun
Make my way and be your son
Pay your way until your done
That's a goal in life, for real
I want you, Dad, to know the deal
Workin' ya fingers to the bone
Just to spend a night at home
And no, I don't regret the way
Our relationship has played across the board and on the stage
That's how you love every time I spray my words across the USA
And who's to say: This is the right way
To love the people you love the way you love 'em
Fuck the money
In a funny situation
In the past
Father and son's love last
You helped me be who I am today
You live inside of this man, I pray
That I could make you understand that I love you, all the way
All the way</pre>
