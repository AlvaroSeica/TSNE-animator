[Miami]   Yeah
          You done brought your bathwater, this body parts
          Your ugly bitch
          But you ain't brought no Hennessy man
          And we did bring the Hennessy
          It was the one with pork in it
          We don't drink pork
          Bitch
          Privilege in
          A pork
[Mac Dre] But did you bring that Hennessy
[Miami]   But did you bring that Hennessy
[Mac Dre] But did you bring that Hennessy
[Both]    But did you bring that Hennessy

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I left mamacita in the taqueria
Half Selena
Half Aaliyah
Bitch little thang, with a sexy little swing
Got on the thang like eat the vi cream
Started spittin' game, mayne, I got words
Rap your ear off, til I get on your nerves
I say somethin' (???) never heard
Like, "I'm, fly as a wings on the
Humming bird"
What you runnin' for, girl, I don't bite
Let the game hit a bitch, chicks, I don't bite
I don't got all night
Get ya thing together
Tell your guide, bye
Get some brain together
I mean, it's whatever
I don't see no limits
To be the biggest thing since the fall of the menace
Kick yards like Emit from here to Tennessee
And oh yeah
Baby, bring that Hennessy

Chorus: Mac Dre
I brought that hoe, slim chicks and bad hoes
And backwood blitz
For that, tobacco (But did you bring that Hennessy)
Three kegs, freaks that give head
Treats and beach beads
Petites and big heads (But did you bring that Hennessy)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I got a master plan, I got some hash in hand
Comin' straight from a coffee shop in Amsterdam
And I don't give a fuck, somebody split the blunts
My currency like some surgery, it's Nip and Tuck
Mr. Ed, gettin' head in the back of the S-U
I'm a bring my cousin, but I'm shakin', my nephew
And you can even ask my agent
He gon' tell you this, "Ronnie Ray's impatient
And he's so flagrant
Ready for liftoff
Yeah
You know they love it when he's dustin' his kicks off" (Mayne)
I'm higher than a fire escape
I got the munchies
With seventeen topless models from different countries
And don't let me start to vaporizin'
Endorse me a chick on the horizon
She swear she love the way I'm grindin'
That privilege heat is tandalizin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Jay Tee]
Now when I walked up to 
I jumped in my county
And told my mayne Hutch
"Oh yeah, that hoe"
I stepped on the gas
Let off the break
I'm in the V-Town, playboy, there's money to make
I hit the liquor store
To cop a fifth
I seen Cadillac grindin', yeah, I'm Andre Hitch
There ain't nothin' but real bad broads all over
Tryin' to get me to come and park the Rover
Stepped off the load in my Oakland Raider
Black kangol, grey alligator
It's nothin' like
A million beaters
I asked baby, "Have she ever stank, scrill and heaters"
Cause if she wanna
Hit the corner
We can take over California
Don't trip
I'm born to mack
Half tank of grey, half cognac

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Miami]
Man
I done rather you bring the Hen
Than your funky ass
Your ugly bitch
Your bad karma
Or your broke ass mama
And we gon' bring the Hennessy
And not the one with pork in it
And this is
McGhetto
Lagantey
And I'm out
