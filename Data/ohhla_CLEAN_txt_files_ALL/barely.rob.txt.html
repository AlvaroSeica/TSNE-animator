Chorus
I'm barely gettin by
Still work-a nine to five
I'm barely gettin by
That's why I'm stayin high
Oh baby, aw

Jump into the ride, cruise the big S.D
Homerows and the originals and P.O.D
And it won't be long till you hear from me
Hopefully I'm not lying that's what they told me
Make the town proud
Make the brown proud
Ever since Brown Crowd
Lil Rob gots his sound down
And I'm still down
Some things just don't change
Like crusin on Sundays
Sleepin on Mondays
Drive thirty on highways
Drinkin on my driveway
My four nine eight still pays fourty five ways
That's how I do it
I thought you knew it
If you didn't now you do
Smoke this, this bud's for you

Chorus

Open up my eyes
I look hypnotized
I feel hypnotized
I apologize
This is recognized
As bein really high
All day everyday this is my way of getting by
Makes me thinking
No way that you need me
Makes me feel different about the streets that I creed
Makes you feel good about em
What would I be without em
Couldn't be without em
Wouldn't be me without em
Lil Rob fuckin clowns em
Twenty six years in the same town
I remember how we used to be it's not the same now
It's still something that I'll drink a beer to
Viva La Colonia Southern California

Chorus

Wait a minute check this out

I'm very very high
I'm very very high
It's time to say goodbye

Keep it on the low
Time to let you know
I don't wanna go
But I gotta go
Till the next time around
Catch you on the rebound
Until then go and bump my jam round your town
