Monoxide, blaze up a smoke!
Monoxide, blaze up a smoke!

(Monoxide Child)
I might smoke a Marlboro for the fuck of it
But I'ma keep it menthol till you all wanna puff on it
Rough and rugged, and my voice is all raspy
Teeth all rotten and yellow, my breath nasty
I smoke 3.. 4, 5 packs a day
Just rottin my mustache away
It ain't no time to play, cause I get winded so quick
And when I spit it's so yellow and thick
It'll probably make you sick and wanna throw up
Naw, baby, hold up, what'chu mean it ain't no smokin in there, I'm bout to blow up
I like my shit whenever, know what I mean?
And I can't help it if you can't appreciate my nicotine
I'm not a quitter, so never give no love to the patch
I'd rather smoke by the patch, now where my motherfuckin smokers at?
Now light it up and take a hit
You gotta admit that you addicted to my menthol, bitch

Monoxide, blaze up a smoke!
Monoxide, blaze up a smoke!
Monoxide, blaze up a smoke!
Monoxide, blaze up a smoke!</pre>
