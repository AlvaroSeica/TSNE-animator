[Intro: Yukon Black]
Yeah, Old wise man once told me there's three sides to every story
Your side, My side, And then it's the truth, It's true
Yo, Yo, Yo..

[Yukon Black]
Your full of shit and that's the motherfuckin truth
Yo put your cards down on the table, Lets see who the fuck is who
You miss lead me, Now I feel a little deadly
What the fuck you expect, Peace, That's just a motherfuckin word
You got some motherfuckin nerve, You won't roll up and murder my heart
It's just a few niggas, And a few bitches, I let get within a few inches
And a mistress is a fantasy, I save it for my sanity
It's gravity that's holdin me down, And keepin me from goin senile
I see know, Few of them cats just be askin for a beat down
Me I'm a king without a crown, And I aint gettin blood all over my rings
So go ahead and just bounce, Bounce, Bounce

[Chorus to fade: Yukon Black w/ ad-libs]
All your lies, Sick of all your lies
Time for the truth cause you aint really fuck with me
The bullshit that's the story of my life
All your lies, Sick of all your lies
Stop it, You've been lyin since the day you first say me
The bullshit that's the story of my life

[Outro: Requiem for a Dream Sample, (Yukon Black)]
(Rock out)
Huh, Fair enough, Shit, Haha haha</pre>
