Song:   Never Satisfied
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Future]
âNo matter what you do, it's never enough
âI don't understand these bitches, Drizzy
Tryin' to, hear all these niggas, they never say
â
â[Chorus: Drake]
âTime after time after time
âMoney's all I get and there's still money on my mind
âBut I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
âI found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
âWe don't talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

[Bridge: Drake]
I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I'm still on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

[Verse: Future]
And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosÃ© with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
How do you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My veins still runnin' deeper than the ocean
[?]

[Chorus]</pre>
