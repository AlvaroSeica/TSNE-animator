[Intro: Magazeen]
Ehhhhhhh
Maga to the Zeen
Gyal come whine p'won it
Come sit up on it
Gyal me know you's a freak from a long time
She take two men: one time
She no care, take it anywhere, pop off the brassiere

[Chorus]
Tell me say she want it
Now she callin
Now gyal you want me right now
Til ah mornin
She tell me say she need me
Now she callin
Now gyal you want me right now
Til ah mornin, alright girl

[Wale]
Yeah, red bottoms, she ain't trying to dance
She gonna chauffer, after let's call a cab
Wet willy shit, pussy, I need a minute
I try to have them lips sing Milli Vanilli shit
Okay I'm trying to hit, something's just gotta give
Can't read the future, my limit is so illiterate
Lyrically celibate, you can't fuck with me
Y'all crazy to share the same cup with me
Low fitted, sure I'm with it
Polo purple like the dope I'm hitting
Word: one dope a-s nigga
Bitches scream "Ralph" they don't know Mike Gibbons
As far as these bars my flow life sentence
And I be in they panties and they be independent
I be in her mind, and y'all be "nevermind"
My marijuana loud [?]

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]
Alright then, back up p'won it
whine for meh gyal
sit up p'won, whine for meh gyal
Excuse me behavior
You rise my nature
Divide your legs
Let me get in at the centre

[Verse 2: Wale]
Clicquot for the girls in the tight dress
Dotty wine for access, show me your neck
I feel good, I look great
A nigga cold, I'm New York, I'm upstate
Lord, I think I'm Ted DiBiase
I had a million dollar dream, who gon' stop me?
And be a freak, for me, Sleek, and Lil J
When I say [?], then, they on they way

[Verse 3: Wale]
Dreads like Rapunzel, big bread, cocoa
Give me the poon, have you shoppin out in Soho
And bring a friend, we can kick it like a Dojo
Let's see what happen when you mix 'Tron with Nuvo
For real, I gotta pole in the basement
My raincoat and gold rappers, amen
And what it taste like? Hey you a freak, right?
No strings attached like velcro sneaks, aight?

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2: Magazeen]
Alright then, back up p'won it
whine for meh gyal
sit up p'won, whine for meh gyal
Excuse me behavior
You rise my nature
Divide your legs
Let me get in at the centre

[Outro: Magazeen]
Start whine (start whine) start whine (start whine)
Start whine, my gyal, start whine
Slow whine (slow whine) slow whine (slow whine)
Slow whine, my gyal, slow whine
Speed it up (speed it up) speed it up (speed it up)
Speed it up, my girl, speed it up
Tick tock (tick tock) tick tock (tick tock)
Tick tock, gyal you got it like dat, eh!
Tree pine (tree pine) tree pine (tree pine)
Tree pine now, do the tree pine
Jump shot (jump shot) jump shot (jump shot)
Jump shot, my gyal, jump shot, eh!
BUMBACLOT
YOU GOT THAT!!</pre>
