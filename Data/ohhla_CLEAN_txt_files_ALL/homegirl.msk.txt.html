[Verse 1]
Believe it's hard to let go
Once knew a girl who came to be so in love
She would say so
Looking in the mirror couldn't even find herself
Blinded by the love that she felt
He was everything to her
She would always talk about him
He was great, he was this, he was that, amor
When in fact
She had more than that
Of course she wasn't gonna tell me
It was embarrassing
Couldn't say what was going on
She wasn't weak
If a man ever hit her it'd be over
It was a whole lot easier forgetting
Sweep under the rug like there wasn't really anything
She smiled, hugged up on her gangster
Behind closed doors things were a whole lot different
I mean this is what I heard
I probably heard some other shit
But didn't wanna disturb

[Chorus]
I don't wanna understand what's going on
I don't wanna realize that what you're doing may be wrong
You tell me that you love me and I wanna believe it
let me pretend because mi corazon is grieving
Wanted to stop because I know a lot better
Must be sick in the mind to put up with this forever
Gotta wake the fuck up before it's too late
Baby doll dry your eyes and don't hesitate

[Verse 2]
He wasn't hitting her
He would treat her perfect
That's what the homegirl told me every single time
She'd get defensive
Or really really quiet
If anyone accused her man
She'd start a riot
You couldn't ask her
But somehow you knew
I mean the look up in her face said more than anything
She really loved him
At least that's how she said it
I wish she would of seen all of the stuff so she'd forget it
But nothing worked
She was better with denial
Even when he cheated right after having a child
She wanted a familia
So she tried to make it work
Put up with anything and whatever that shit took
She really thought he would change one day
But when the liquor hit his body he forgot okay
He didn't know her name
He didn't know her meaning
He didn't know it was his baby's momma he was beating

[Chorus]
I don't wanna understand what's going on
I don't wanna realize that what you're doing may be wrong
You tell me that you love me and I wanna believe it
let me pretend because mi corazon is grieving
Wanted to stop because I know a lot better
Must be sick in the mind to put up with this forever
Gotta wake the fuck up before it's too late
Baby doll dry your eyes and don't hesitate

[Verse 3]
She didn't wanna be alone
She didn't wanna mess around and have nothing at home
Needed a purpose, hizo la rutina que hacer en la cocina
While her man partied out
Blowing feria and cocaina
Nobody to talk to
But that was typical
Anything she had to say
Would of been ridiculed
Besides
It was nobody's business
She'd dealt for so long she had forgotten it was wrong
Everything he said seemed to always stick around
She just couldn't forget the things he said to put her down
I saw that mess maybe a couple of times
And I'd try to understand but it would kill me inside
The whole purpose of me telling you this story
Is to hope you take care so you don't gotta be sorry
Take care of your kids and be sure to love them well
They just don't deserve to see you in that kind of hell..

[Chorus]
I don't wanna understand what's going on
I don't wanna realize that what you're doing may be wrong
You tell me that you love me and I wanna believe it
let me pretend because mi corazon is grieving
Wanted to stop because I know a lot better
Must be sick in the mind to put up with this forever
Gotta wake the fuck up before it's too late
Baby doll dry your eyes and don't hesitate</pre>
