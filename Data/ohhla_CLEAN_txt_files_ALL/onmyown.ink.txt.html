Song:   On My Own
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oooh oooh ohh

Did it on my own, I did it on my own

Couldn't wait on u gotta stand on my own too
Yeah we just weren't on the same beat
Right way goin down the wrong street
Uh it gets real deep u dig trynna feel me
It is what it will be
Say you've been there but it's still means
Nothing
Where were u when a nigga had nothing
Got kicked outta the crib two at a time
Sleeping on couches outta my mind
Uh I gotta get on the grind pray god get on the line
I got nothin but time but u can never take none of mine
Remember that

[Chorus]
Please don't take it wrong when I tell u that I'm alone and cause
I appreciate the love and I appreciate the trouble
But it just wasn't enough so I did it on my own, did it on my own
I did it on my own, did it on my own, I did it on my own

Yeah right on cue came in the game no IOUs
I'm the only one liable say u ain't made it till they lie on u
4 am, hair down, long drive, lil child
Goin to see his daddy on lock down ain't really seen em since... he got out
Made me my own mad look around count about 4 friends I asked for this but don't need no help I ain't ask for shit

[Chorus]
Please don't take it wrong when I tell u that I'm alone and cause
I appreciate the love and I appreciate the trouble
But it just wasn't enough so I did it on my own, did it on my own
I did it on my own, did it on my own, I did it on my own

My blood, my sweat, my tears
My days, my nights, my years
I did it all when they said that I couldn't
That's why I'm standin here telling you

[Chorus]
Please don't take it wrong when I tell u that I'm alone and cause
I appreciate the love and I appreciate the trouble
But it just wasn't enough so I did it on my own, did it on my own
I did it on my own, did it on my own, I did it on my own</pre>
