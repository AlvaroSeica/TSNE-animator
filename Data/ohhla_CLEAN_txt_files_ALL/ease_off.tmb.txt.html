[Timbaland]
Owww.. owww...
Timbo is back... Timbo is back babe!
Timbo is back babe! Ay (ay) ay (ay)
Ay (ay ay) ay (ay ay)

Ay lil' momma cool it down
Mmhmm, she's the talk of the town
Yeah! She gets around 
A little later she'll turn you out!
Beware! Can't hold her down
Not her, not baby gal
Ohh! She's a, crazy gal
Somebody come get the gal

[Interlude: Timbaland]
Easy! She's 'bout to drown
Easy! She's outta bounds
Easy! Come save the girl
Easy! She's about to earl
Do you love that? (Another round)
Want some more of that? (Another round)
You enjoy that? (Another round)
Girl you all that; but

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Ease off the liquor (the liquor)
Lil' momma you off the Richter (you off the Richter)

[unnamed female]
My tolerance, is high
Four shots don't do nothin to me, I'm fine
Can you hold your liquor? Cause I can hold mine
And if I get pulled over, I can walk a straight line
Talk to me

[Timbaland]
She can hardly walk! Let's go, let's go, let's go
You can't drink no mo', put your cup down and let's go
Don't need no mo', put your cup down and let's go
Don't need oh no! Now she taking off her clothes

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Owww! Hey... hey... hey...
I need you to put that drink.. down, put that drink.. down
You had too much.. now, you had too much

[unnamed female]
I ain't gon' put that drink.. down, put that drink.. down
I know what I'm doin, I, know what I'm doin

[Timbaland]
I need you to put that drink.. down, put that drink.. down
You had too much.. now, you had too much

[unnamed female]
I ain't gon' put that drink.. down, put that drink.. down
I know what I'm doin, I, know what I'm doin

[Timbaland]
Lil' momma you had too much... ease off the liquor
What I like is a lady who can hold her liquor {*2X*}

[unnamed female]
What I like is a man makin more than six figures {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Owwwww! {*echoes*} Owwwww! {*echoes*}
Two drinks, is enough girl
Two drinks is the minimum {*4X*}
Four, babe you gonna do too much
Ease up, ease up
Ease up, let's have fun, ease up
Let's have fun, ease up, ease up
This is like... the alcohol anonymous song
Ease up off the liquor
Ease off the liquor, so you can't blame it on the alcohol
Ease off, the liquor
Why? So we can't blame it on the alcohol
So, we, ease up on the liquor
Why? So we can't blame it on the alcohol
Ay, so we can't blame it on the alcohol
Ay, so we can't blame it on the alcohol
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol</pre>
