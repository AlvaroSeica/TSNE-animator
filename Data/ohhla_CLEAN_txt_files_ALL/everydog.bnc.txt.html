[AWOL]
I wanna kill a Slob it's the fifth of the month
Blue rag on my head, on my side, on the front
Blue Pumas on my feet, blue khakis on my ass
Black Glock in my hand just in case I gotta blast, see
You get gaffled like a bitch if you chin check
The A-K 47 put him on his back
Broke him down to his motherfuckin' mainframe
Dropped top forehead lookin' at that Slob's brain
Make a Slob break out in a sweat
Cause I'm a Kelly gangsta A-K-A a walkin' threat
B.G. niggas do it the most, I got my A-K
Ready and steady servin' Slobs problems Loc
How in the fuck can I mix with the Inglewood?!
I only got love for third of my own hood
Killin' when I'm rollin' with my niggas
Not just any niggas but them killa Slob niggas
Fuckin' with a Kelly Park Crip now you know
I give a Slob a home on Palmer when bullets roll
Ain't no more steppin' through the smog nor creepin' through the fog
I'm a motherfuckin' Loc sayin' fuck all Dogs

Every Dog has his day, every Dog has his day...
(I'm a Dog killa, I'm a Dog killa, I'm a B-Dog killa)

[G-BONE]
Slobs better kick at and pay a fuck attention
I'm crippin' through your hood on a Slob killin' mission
Strap on my lap all ready for the K's up ???
To the other side I'm makin' Slob drop
Raise out the window pull the trigga and I blast
Pumps some of that lead in a Slob nigga ass
The nigga rolled over and I shot him in the fuckin' jaw
Hollow shells in my shit, blew his shit the fucked off
Mr. gang bang motherfucker boogie bitch
Slob nigga don't slip cause I'ma cock the set trip
Snoop should have knew I was a trigga happy nigga
Original Baby Gangsta Atlantic Drive Crip gang member
I'm a straight motherfuckin' Brim murderer
None that peace makin' nigga, a bullet stone cold killa
A nigga called Bone that's a motherfuckin' hog
A loc'd out Crip B-K nigga fuck the Dog!

[Chorus]

[SIX PAC]
Shiiiit
Now I'm a menace from the past kickin' hoo-ride best
Tons of blue rag in their dice game and watch 'em catch whiplash
Damn flood who did it and I'ma bank him
And while I'm blastin' I'm yellin' out FRANKLIN!
See I'm a soldier thought I done told ya
And everytime you slip
I'ma peel up fool
You Snoops think they slick
Tryin' to creep
Through the park
But the nigga Six Pac ??? like tiger sharks
They sniff a mack
Then roll 'em up like that bomb
?And win their daughters like a Watts Loc Vietnam?
Leavin' a killa dead bodies nigga dressed in red
But that's O-K a motherfucker look better dead
CAlifornia Revolution Independent Pistol Slinger
Watts Franklin Crip O.G. gangbanger
A 44 Mag to the dome when I take him home
Boom! Boom! on the corner another Slob is gone

[Chorus]

[TROLL]
Look who you stuck with
A Kelly you don't wanna fuck with
So Slobs duck quick cause I'm fits to fuck up shit
And it's a must I kill D-O-G's
Dead rags gettin' served tryin' to fuck with these
Two C's
Puttin' 'em on their goddamn backs
Slob fools throw back when I'm packin' a Gat
Set trippin' if you caught
In your colors dead shirt
Dead pants leaves a dead motherfucker
So all Snoops better bang repercussion
Tuck your rags in or get killed tryin' to floss it
Sportin' that bullshit
I'll get your card pulled quick
Test me if you will but I'm pass 'em with full clips
And
Another die-'Ru lies Restin' In Pieces
Put my Gat to his mouth and made his bitch ass see it
So when you see a B.G.
Drop down and pray
Cause every motherfuckin' Dog is fits to have his day

[Chorus]

[BIG FREEZE &amp; BRONCO]
Crips bustin' shots from Glocks to Slobs steady droppin'
Killin' off all Slobs cause see Cuz it ain't no peace poppin'
Eastside Watts madness Snoop buster
Crip 4 live
Do or die
F for death MOTHERFUCKER!
Servin' you Slobs on a day to day basis
Can't floss on real boss so what's up with your bitch trick?
Down with the Franklin Fudge Front from murder skills nigga
Off jack next the flex with that itchy trigga finger that kills
As I snatch the trigga of the Tec or A-K
As I spray
Cause all dogs have a day
To die you know why punk fool this is Crip
Give it up
What that F like bow down to the set trip
From sun up - to sun down
From Franklin - to Fudge Town
Should've been a Crip cause Slob niggas get beated down
This is the life of a loc'd out slanger
Active gang banger that keeps one in the chamber
So hip hip a motherfuckin' raid
I'm so takin' fuck peace makin' every Dog will have his day

[Chorus]</pre>
