I dey ride for my ppl boooooossss
I dey ride for my ppl broooooossss

Stay Dreamin'
These dudes go wan try kill your grind
Stay Dreamin'
These dudes go wan try take your shine

Life is similar to
Scenes from the movies that I saw when I was just a youngin'
They try to kill the protagonist but he keeps comin' - back
Back to life I'm talking that soul II soul
I'm on my Janet Jackson steez I won't lose CONTROL!
I never worry about the dweebs trying kill my dreams
Know the truth that they're inspired by my enemy - the devil
Always trying to get a one-up on me - but
Greater is He the King of Kings that always lives in Me
Conquistador conqueror and Lord of Lords
Chew out the skin of the beef is why I spit raw - PYUGCHK!
Most rappers careers could end, dead off of one song
Mess around and end up becoming that filet mignon - BON!
A tout' a l'heure to you rap posers
Let that boy Sam Cook, change gon come closer
Treat your free-styles like e-mails in spam folders
One listen was all it took - deleted forEVER!
Sick of the sycophants in music and real life
I rather talk the sacrifice of Christ and forget hype
I'd rather see my woman dressed in heels and just red-stripes
I'd rather see my wife naked in heels and just wet-wipes
if I was too graphic this is M for mature onlyy
Put the kiddies to bed they aint spittin' so coldly
Give 'em bigger pants they gon' need 'em to grow in
Fellas need to do better, start acting like grown-men
Be a father to your kid, be good examples for children
We need more role models, less video vixens
....No disrespect to the video vixens
I'm just saying, who gon rave about the regular wo-men
If I ruled the world it would be complete-ely diff'rent
Nas said it best yet I'm still illmatic
Lauryn to the rest miseducation is catchy
School systems broke teachers molesting the babies
They'll never make us fail cos success is the elbow
Trying to make us lose is just a slippery kill slope
Y'all can keep planking on your temp'ry c-notes
I'm in Denver with bad Beckies just doing the Tebow - UNGH!

I ride for my ppl doooooooooooohh
I slide for my ppl doooo-ooooo-ooohh

Stay Dreamin'
These dudes will try to kill your grind
Stay Dreamin'
These dudes will try to take your shine</pre>
