[Intro: Chris Brown] &amp; (Wynter Gordon)
She ain't in it for the fame (for the fame)
For the fame (for the fame) for the fame (for the fame)
She ain't in it for the fame, for the fame, for the fame
She said that she ain't in it for the fame (for the fame)
For the fame (for the fame) for the fame (for the fame)
She said that she ain't in it for the fame

[Tyga]
Uhh please +No Intro+, Tyga she already know
Come and spend the night with me and tell me what you into
Uhh~! Can I take you home? Wake up in the morn'
My-my side of the bed; next minute I'm gone
You smiled too; I'll probably smile if I was you
Always keep it real with me and I'ma keep it real with you
Her friends like "How you gon' handle him?"
Always hidin from the camera

[Chorus: Chris Brown] &amp; (Wynter Gordon)
Cause she ain't in it for the fame, for the fame, for the fame
She said that she ain't in it for the fame (for the fame)
For the fame (for the fame) for the fame (for the fame)
She said that she ain't in it for the fame

[Interlude: Wynter Gordon]
I ain't in it for the fame, I ain't tryin to play the game
Boy you know I'm down for you
I don't need your money no, I ain't in it for the show
But I love you; I said that I ain't in it for the fame

[Tyga]
So what you here for? Is you really down fo' sho'?
Let me know, fly you out to anywhere you wanna go (wanna go)
Same night... new ice
Flashing lights, I can tell you like
But she don't really want none of
Homey trying to holla but she only be wantin my love (My love)
Bein on the magazine
Movie screen, she ain't never seen

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Chris Brown]
Shorty I gotta be real honest, cause I got a thing for you
I'll do everything I promise, so what you wanna do?

[Wynter Gordon]
Boy I want you, and I know you want me
Why don't you put it on me? Cause you like what you say

[Tyga]
Hands up, stick up the crowd, I wanna hear you shout it out
Young Money in the house, show you what them dollars 'bout
Ghetto girls, loud mouth, quiet chick, never 'bout
Point 'em out, they all good as long as

[Chorus] + [Interlude]
