{BRING, THE ACTION}

[Britney Spears - in faux British accent]
When you hear this in the club, you're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up, you're gonna turn this shit up
When we up in the club, all eyes on us
All eyes on us, all eyes on us
See the boys in the club, they watching us
They watching us, they watching us
Everybody in the club, all eyes on us
All eyes on us, all eyes on us

[Chorus: will.i.am] (Britney)
I wanna scream, and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out

And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, ohh wee ohh wee oh-wee-ohh

It goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever
'Cause I was feelin down, now I'm feelin better
And baby it goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever, forever
Fore-v-e-r, fore-v-e-r, fore-v-e-r, fore-v-e-r
