[Krizz Kaliko]
I'm kalico ala I like that pu wah wah
She let me do what I want to her then I'm through with her
I never smooch with her

She got a fupa it don't matter I'm still scooping her
See see see see see baby like beats like
Shes like smellin right then tellin what that peach like (HEY!)
I take a sniff and sniff her up like snuffaluffagus
A horny lil devil's what shes up against
She drippin perfection
Perfect sweat drippin all ova her
Bodacious bernadette is what I'm callin her must sop her up
I cough it up to get a proper slop with her
Ya I'm confident but hopein it can pop with her, she popular

This swag is atmosphere so that means it out of sight
Made my way thru the crowd yep approach got near
Post at chu at the bar and whispered in ya ear
Hey Miss lady (radio edit) got chu from a crush
She said she ain't a groupie chick and I know you a star
Don't sweet talk me if you plan on playin around
So I jumped on the ground and I start to scream loud
Yo body so bad like Jessica Biel
No mirage booty pop saggy booty conceled

Don't need no water got a big big bottle of that pu wah wah wah
Drip drip drip
