{*car crash and glass flying everywhere*}

Woo yeah
Woo yeah
Go mc {*11X*}

[mc chris]
It's mc chris I'm twice as wide
As a kid whose tall enough to ride the rides
I be in your files like the FBI
So my shit quick and slick like slip and slide
That means I'm fat not with a P-H
But with a pound of bacon and a basket of eggs
You're whack so no matter how you bake
I be chillin on the mics and you be lyin in your grave

[mc chris]
It's mc chris, I'm scared I'm frightened
And all my cliff notes I'm highlightin
I'm in a blue font and the piranhas are brightened
If I am a puppet I wish the strings tightened
But that's all right I got my ray gun and jet pack
To all the blood suckers got my AK so get back
Where you came from? I won't mind
My name is mc chris, now's the time to press rewind

[Interlude]
Yeah so like I made rap song
It's not that wrong is it?
mc chris is so fly, mc chris is the best
mc chris is a super rapper, he's a super rapper (#1)

[mc chris]
Kick it Macy's Day, please press play
It's more like Halloween than independence day
My phaser on stun and I'm on the nod
I said I killed Godzilla and now here comes his son
and his reptilian daughter and I'll never be odder
But I blow them all away like I was the Godfather
I take over the school like I was Mr. Kotter
And I did it my way, just like a punk rocker
