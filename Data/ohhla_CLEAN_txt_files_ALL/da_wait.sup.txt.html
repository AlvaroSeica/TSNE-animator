Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time
Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time
Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time

[Chorus] 2X
But is that too much to ask?
I wanna be the man who touch the cash
I sent my tape off and two months have passed
And I ain't heard a word from y'all frontin ass
you laugh

What I wanna know was, when am I gon make records like y'all?
Better yet, when am I gon get respected like y'all?
I rap in an environment where I'm expected to fall
I send 20 demos out and never receive one call
And you got the gall to ask me, for a little bit of my paper
I'm sticking with rap like I wrote rhymes on fly-paper
While the A&amp;R sit back in his office space
My tape go in the trash with a big smile across his face
See, when you're broke, you gotta do it for the love of it
Niggas ain't gon buy your joint, they gon make a dub of it
So why would I waste my time saying I rap for y'all
After all I'm black, so it's either rap or basketball
And I ain't got enough skills to hit the NBA
And anyway, around my block its hard cuz too many play
But anyday now, I know I hustle women
When I get the long-awaited call from Mr. Russell Simmons
Maybe then, in my two eyes you might see a tear
When he tell me, that I'm gon do my album with Premier
Shh, don't let me wake-up, I know I won't get none of that
The day I do, the day you see a one-legged running back
But coming back to what I was saying before
You heard a million sob stories, but I got a million more
Used to try to make beats, stopping the bars in the tapes
But all I want is my record beside yours in the crates

[Chorus] 2X

All my peoples like, "Yo, you sound phat on the track"
But I can't make a living off that little pat on the back
See everybody wanna rhyme, and everyone that rhyme is selfish
Intimidated... don't wanna support nobody else shit
But when you get recorded
You think I'm gon support it?
I'ma look you dead in your face and be like, "man, I can't afford it"
How can I have sex? Women won't let me get a feel
Lookin at me like, "This nigga still try'na get a record deal?"
One day I be on
And I get rid of my Neon
With the same chick, picking up every single that we on
So every night, I'm calling from Carolina to Michigan
Sayin I'm givin up rap, cuz ain't nobody listening
7 Years of Bad Luck, I been jerked with 2 deals
I better switch it up and dye my hair blonde like Dru Hill
Or dress up in a leather suit, and y'all would buy it
But I swear Kelly Price will go on a diet before I try it
I'm sick and tired, of being sick and tired, disgusted
Why don't you give me your deal? You ain't doin it no justice
I wanna live illustrious, but I'm living a lie
So while you're writing raps to get paid, I'm barely getting by
I sit and try to think of future dreams, and try to make the best of nothin
My life's about to blow, somebody must've pressed the button
I gotta bounce for now, what a way to end off
And plus, I got 25 more tapes to send off

[Chorus] 2X

Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time
Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time
Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time
Cuz I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting, I'm just passing time</pre>
