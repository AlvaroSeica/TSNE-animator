There's only one truth and everyone has 
delusions at different levels of insanity 
knowledge is forever expanding 
every piece of it brings more questions than it answers 
so the spirit of wisdom is 
constantly increasing awareness of your ignorance 
beware of all the simpletons 
pretending that the answers are here and that they're infinite 
everything doesn't need to be balanced 
not all ideas are equally valid 
if you want to speak you're allowed to 
but then I get the freedom to critique and to challenge 
truth don't hold an allegiance 
you've got nowhere to run 
doesn't matter what you believe in 
you've got nowhere to run 

nowhere to run 

ideas are bigger than the people that have them 
people are bigger than beliefs they imagine 
disagree but you can not demonize 
all of me cause we don't see exactly 
eye to eye, 
these hypocrites don't have to go tip-toe 
why do I? 
don't have to respect your beliefs 
if it does harm then expect me to speak 
shouldn't let it get in between 
my respect for you cause they're separate things 
your beliefs you're entitled to 
but when they feed your actions the line gets moved 
cause it happens in my world too 
and that virus of the mind stays alive through you 
and those ideas feed the soil 
that we grow in so then the seeds get spoiled 
cause if you tolerate disease you can plant a million trees 
but the weeds destroy them 
if you have a thought, defend it 
no one has the right not to be offended 

(hook) 
know I, know I know I 
gotta face whatever comes 
may not like it, got to get by it, 
got nowhere to run (nowhere to run) 
don't hide, don't, don't hide, it'll get you before you're done 
the truth has ways to find you any place 
you've got nowhere to run (nowhere to run) 
na na na na na nowhere 
na na na na na nowhere 
na na na na na nowhere 
nowhere to run 

religious moderates are the first to blame 
the fundamentalists for all the murder and hate 
call their books holy and interpret away 
the words on the page to make them worthy of praise 
in that search to relate 
you're providing cover for the very worst of your faith 
whatever you end up believing 
suspending your reason has a burden to pay 
tribalism is in our nature 
reinforced by a simple danger 
the history of victimization 
defines self-image of religion and races 
the more you try to level the pavement 
the more difficult it is to ever escape it 
driven by guilt or pain 
the problems rebuild with a different name 
ideas are the DNA 
of social evolution, the seeds of change 
we're genes that will be replaced 
mutation is now survival 

(hook) 
know I, know I know I 
gotta face whatever comes 
may not like it, got to get by it, 
got nowhere to run (nowhere to run) 
don't hide, don't, don't hide, it'll get you before you're done 
the truth has ways to find you any place 
you've got nowhere to run (nowhere to run) 
na na na na na nowhere 
na na na na na nowhere 
na na na na na nowhere 
nowhere to run 

na na na na na nowhere 
na na na na na nowhere 
na na na na na nowhere 
nowhere to run</pre>
