I'm K. Born no amateur, yes I'm a vet
You probably ain't heard of me yet cause we ain't met
but I'll bet, when I test the fire I signify
Leave fools crucified, just say my line, yeah
Jesus, lay your hands on me
Never let me fall into the hands of the enemy
Don't release me please, hear what I say
Send your angels at the right time and let me slip away
from these demons, keepin me from slippin
But I ain't tweakin, cause I'ma keep on sneakin and defeatin
Get back when I attack, with a supreme weapon
Your competition can't compete, so get to steppin
I'm representin to the endin in this rap session
so may God be with you until we meet again
I lift my hands to the sky and he rain blessings
