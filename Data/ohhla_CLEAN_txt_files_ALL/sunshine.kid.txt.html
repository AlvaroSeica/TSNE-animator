[intro - Prince Teddy]
What is time?
Time is when a man is trying to make time with your woman,
but you're doing time behind bars and your time is standing still
Yo Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?

[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sifts through the hourglass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
So I can manifest what I've seen on a drum beat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)
roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)
a tattooed tear dropped as the iron gates slam

[chorus - Bill Withers &amp; Frost]
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Anytime, hey - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine, Anytime - Bill Withers

[verse 2 - Frost]
Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
you're lost so take the caution don't play the game
should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
but no you didn't think (sucker)
you just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
so there's no one else to thank but yourself
so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways
corrupt and wicked
out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
pow pow bang bang and all that noise (yeah)
yeah you and all your homeboys
take time to read between the lines
cause ain't no sunshine

[chorus]

[verse 3 - Frost]
(yo kid) I know about being macho
Callin the shots the big time head honcho (yeah)
But here's something even more gacho
One of my homeboys is your old lady's Sancho
Yo shit happens
A number lights up on his beeper right as I'm rappin
While you sit in a cell writing a letter 
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)
but man she couldn't wait 
so she's going out on a date
with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
so how you gonna handle this 
When your ho's in Los Angeles, acting so scandalous
Yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
and now, ain't no sunshine

[chorus]
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
That's for you, '92 you know what I'm saying? - Prince Teddy
Anytime, yeah - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine, Anytime - Bill Withers
Damn - Frost

[interlude - Prince Teddy]
So if you don't wanna do no time, 
you better take time to try to draw the line you know what I'm saying?
Or you're gonna be the next fool in line doing time, 
you know what I'm saying?  Like my man said...

[chorus]
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine fool - Prince Teddy
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't nothing happening up there you know what I'm saying? - Prince Teddy
Ain't no sunshine, Anytime - Bill Withers 
Yo, me and Frost is out of here, Peace - Prince Teddy

There just ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
