Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When she's around yeah

I love Marijuana
She is one of my favourite lovers
Yes I love Marijuana
What would I do without her
In my head she's always make me feel so iry
If I are cool I'ma clear meditation

Marijuana make me feel so good
Marijuana make me feel so nice
When she's in my head I feel open
She always lands on my hand and I feel so fine
Marijuana wooo

All I need is take some bullets with the gun
This trailer full of herbs I let sit in the sun
Marijuana
So many things that we love but only a few that we need
It's the good sensi bean with them herbs with no seeds

See all love or just hate me I just don't care
In the end in love I really just share
Marijuana, marijuana
Then she surround me

One thing to do open the mind get disturbed
Get a match and then light some herbs
Only girl share nothing in this world
It's the herb that smells just like rose

Love marijuana
I love marijuana nice
I love marijuana
She is still my lover</pre>
