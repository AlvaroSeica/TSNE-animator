(Lyfe Jennings, talking)
It's that man again, haha
Some people refer to him as a hustla
Pimp, or playa

(Hook, Lyfe Jennings, singing)
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my windows, yeah
Hear the man? Seventeen years of pain
But, I'm still here though
Ohhhhh
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my window, yeah
Hear the man? Seventeen years of pain
But, I'm still here though
Ohhhhh

(Project Pat)
What? What? Yes sir

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Even though a nigga still in the hoo-oo-ood
Gettin' drunk and smokin' on woo-oo-ood
I'ma make it up outta this street life
On the corner is where I stoo-oo-ood
Out there all by my-self
Cause a playa gotta get this mail
Welfare ain't doin' us no good
Kill a brother, they gon' make you pale
But I'm still ten-toes in this
Hustlin' tryin'a make it hood-rich
And I still ain't trustin' no bitch
Cause the motherfucka's always snitch
It's hard in this ghetto mayn
Fifteen years old wit' coke and 'cain
Cheese don't come, I'ma go insane
Snatch me a purse, snatch me a chain
Out hurr on the block, wit' the fiends and the moon
Squeeze on the Glock, tryin'a pop at a goon
He done stole me dough, he took my food
Project wasn't born wit' a silver spoon
In my mouth, in my grille
Wearin' six chains, then niggas get killed
One in the grave, the other in jail
Nobody wins, that's for real

(Verse 2, DJ Paul)
Back way, when I was a runny nose
Runnin' round, up and down the town
Carryin' a black Glock, and a gold frown
I kept that product on me
It wasn't no problem homie
You said it, I had it
And met'cha at the store for mo-ney
Just tryin'a buy Balogna
But now I'm buyin' lobster
Still totin' a glock
For pushin' a Rolls Royce
And winnin' Oscars

(DJ Paul, Talking)
Yeah, Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat
Lyfe Jennings
If you can believe, you can achieve
Every day above ground is a good thing
Ya hear me?
Yeah

(Hook, Lyfe Jennings, singing)
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my windows, yeah
Hear the man? Seventeen years of pain
But, I'm still here though
Ohhhhh
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my window, yeah
Hear the man? Seventeen years of pain
But, I'm still here though
Ohhhhh</pre>
