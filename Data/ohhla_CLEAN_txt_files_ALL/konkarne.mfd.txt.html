[MF Doom]
Darker than the east river
Larger than the Empire State
Where the beats to guard the barbed wire gate
Is on the job not my fate
Tired of the wait to the villain bring deliverance from the dire straits
Fire at a higher rate
Why'd they make the liars
Fliers scatter
Buy a plate
Isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers if not the vise grips
A real price saver way to acquire nice whips
What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner a funner summer number one meal deal bummer
A bizarre phenomenon is your armor on
Take ya cash coma or break ya fast Ramadan
Trons action drama awww come on barney
Clack clack pardon me wack rap Kon Karne
He came to feed the childrens like Sally Strothers
After that he's going back to cali where's da

[love is]

Wilder than the nile
Old power like the great pyramids of giza
And stay leanin like the tower of pisa
Give him something he can feel that's off the squeeza
Raw with the pen and on the mic off the hezza
Get shot off that wide eye talk
If he had a pot he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street person
Looking for the perfect beat co worsen into heat bursting
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that comes with a free hot plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3-D ring sittin stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting
It ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motorcross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to snuffiluffigus me and Sub is like the brown Smothers Brothers

Faster than the seven seas
Bigger than mount kilimanjaro
If they don't know fill them in tomorrow
And the horror show
I'm into no return bars regularly
Swear to god before he gets a job he robs head hurt
Blessed with a hot flow
Tested and got doe
Invested and stressed the best to finest an opto
As I reminisce never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the henny straight couldn't afford to cop the cherry coke
Or should I say broke with wealth
To know enough to give them just rope to yoke they self
Playin me before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog on it
Do the statistics
How he bust lyrics was to futuristic for ballistics
And far to eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc the Hip Hop Hendrix</pre>
