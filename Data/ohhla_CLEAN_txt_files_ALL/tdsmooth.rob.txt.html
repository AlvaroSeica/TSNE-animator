[Intro: Pharrell]
E'rybody get up! E'rybody get up! E'rybody get up! 

[Robin Thicke] (Pharrell) (*DJ Tedsmooth):
Get up! Get down! Get up! Get down! (E'rybody get up!)
Do you like it hurt?! (*U REMEMBER!) Like it hurt!
Uh! What you doin light work?! HEYYYYYYYYY!!!! (E'rybody get up!)

[Busta Rhymes]
No identical (Huh!) Salute the general
Beautiful pedastal and prepare for your burial
Every single time I set it go call up a medic if you don't you'll regret it
Better believe I'm comin to get it (HA!)
It's wild how they lovin my style see how I jump in the pile of money
Then I look in the crowd it's funny
Just to see the way I get 'em up and sit 'em up and let 'em up
And hit 'em up we makin a toast go 'head and GET A CUP!!!
You 'posed to know the glow the flow will come quick (HA!)
Just for the record if you ain't knowin I run shit! (HUH!)
So take a look at the kid as I advance
High speed and I led on they ass and then I dance
Right across that finish line get in line with the rhymes that I spit
Anytime at the drop of a dime SHIT!
I remind niggaz as I get bigger never test this
Be clear on who the best is
Robin talk to 'em!!!

[Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Turn me up
If you can't hear, what I'm tryna say (hey girl, c'mere!)
If you can't read, from the same page
Maybe I'm goin deaf (hey hey hey) maybe I'm goin blind (hey hey hey)
Maybe I'm out of my (hey hey hey) miiiiiind (e'rybody get up)

[Interlude: Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)

That man is not your maker (hey hey hey) and that's why I'ma take a

[Chorus: Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Good girl! I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
You're a good girl! Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic, talk about gettin blasted
I hate these blurred lines! I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
But you're a good girl! The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty, go 'head get at me (e'rybody get up)

[Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
What do they make dreams for, when you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for? You the hottest bitch in this place!
I feel so lucky (hey hey hey) you wanna hug me (hey hey hey)
What rhymes with hug me? (Hey hey hey) Heyyyyyy (e'rybody get up)

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me, Dakota to Decatur

[Chorus] w/ ad libs
