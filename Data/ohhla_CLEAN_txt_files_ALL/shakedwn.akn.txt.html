[Intro]
Stand up, salute!
Devyne Stephens, Upfront is in the building!
Let's go (oh-ohh-oh)
It's the Konvict album (oh-ohh-oh)
Yeah, y'all done fucked up now (oh-ohh-oh)
I got money now nigga (it's a shake down)
I got enough money to free Amistad (oh-ohh-oh)
 
[Akon]
He ain't lyin, if you're sellin we ain't buyin
If it's scattered on your block you best believe that we supplyin
From a ki' down to a half a pound, a quarter to a dime
Tryin to own a piece of Brooklyn like my niggaz John Klein
Hey, ya know me I'm known to rock wit it
Roll through your spot wit it, post up rock wit it
Hey, ya know me I'm on the block with it
Non-stop wit it, violate and get popped wit it
Hey, so I suggest ya keep steppin homie
Cause you will rarely find me without my weapon on me
Got the whole Konvict squad bettin on me
And now the dots around the world are now connectin homie
 
[Chorus: Akon]
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped so make 'em wait now
When they come wavin them gats ya know to lay it down
And give 'em all ya got cause it's a shake down
Oh-ohh-oh, hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped so make 'em wait now
When they come wavin them gats ya know to lay it down
And give 'em all ya got cause it's a shake down, oh-ohh-oh
Cause it's a shake down, oh-ohh-oh
Cause it's a shake down, oh-ohh-oh
Cause it's a shake down, oh-ohh-oh
Do I make myself clear? Oh-ohh-oh
 
[Akon]
Hey hey hey
A fleet of European cars in my driveway
Murciélago, Gallardo, Ferrari
My shorty ridin shotgun bumpin Sadè
Toes hangin out the window loadin up my army
You know I keep a bad bitch breathin on me
Also known to handle business when I'm beefin homie
And won't hesitate to cock it when them people on me
So guess what, no exceptions to ya neither homie
Ya know I got that African connection
Locked up in a facility correction
Amistad style chains hangin like blaow
Block Royal's Upfront, we in the place now
 
[Chorus]
 
[Akon]
Now I'ma show you how to break this down
Peel back, show you how to shake this down
First nigga to create this sound
Can't believe it took a convict to shake this town
Dipped in European linen with the V-neck
Diamond-studded VVS's, no less
Kunta Kinte bracelet, lit up the whole set
My nigga we on deck, best believe it's no sweat
Need street credibility, who you go get?
I give you that credibility for the right check
Keep your future on the shelf, quiet's where it's best kept
Don't want them Upfront shooters bringin wreck, like
 
[Chorus]</pre>
