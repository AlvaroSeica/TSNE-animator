[Chorus]
Like that like that
Bounce ya ass like that like that
Bounce that ass like that like that
Bend over let me see it from the back
Like Beyonce, like Trina
Like a big bootie ass black diva
Like a stripper, up and down like Flipper
Bend over let me see it from the back

[Verse 1]
Double shots of Hennessy, let it get you groovy
Gone work yo ass do ya thang, I'ma do me
I done switched to doucher and the switcher got a room key
Act like you auditioning for a video or movie
bend towards the floor I want your hands where your toes be
I'ma Squeze all on you booty all nasty
done made 18 girl I'm legal you can harass me
cash and a bemmer I can't seem to find a bad beat
a big fat ass like Trina make me happy
titties shake thighs shake vibrate while she dancing
like to shake her ass like Ciara real fancy
wonder if Ciara can shake her ass on this lamp peice
betcha Jada Pinkett shake that ass real classy
Ain't ready for the real betacha she be actin Will have it
you see me I'm picky I rate that ass
I gotta ask 50 how Vivica shake that ass

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You see big fine you when I find you
I'ma beat that pussy from behind you
show lil thang up girl I ain't tryin to
I'm trill young savage boo must I remind you
all I need is one night and a few minutes
I'ma handle that there and then I'm through wit it
tell me is you bullshitin or is you cool wit it
our baby parents ain't got nothing to do wit it
I want a J. Lo yonce' coke bottle shape object
cook soul food bake cake straight out the projects
a female savage straight bad bitch prospect
Baby Phat, Apple Bottem big booty Gucci and Prada
I be lookin for the kinda lil mama thats bout some dollars
350 dollar bottles thats all she want to swalla
and if you ain't a big balla she ain't even trying to holla
she gone take ya lil measly dollas and walk off like a model

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I need something like Nia Long make you wanna bring her home
feed her bone and don't even treat her wrong
Ever seen that movie monster ball
bend over like Halle Berry on that part when ole boy knocked her off
I'ma dog I like it soft I like to rub I like to grip
to tell the truth I like them loose cause me and my thugs we like to flip
I like the friends who get involved all the broads say I'ma trip
I like the picture takin pictures while you catch it on ya lip
I like to sneek and take ya shoppin when ya niggaz start to trip
drink my liquor out the bottle on his couch and watch you strip
stick a couple fingers in ya make it tickle make ya drip
make ya holla like I'm robbin ya like a pimp and then I dip
I want to get an ounce of hydro get alicia eyes low
take her to the suite and make her hit all of her high notes
Strapped up fa sho cause I don't trust no hoe
anybody can go Eazy-E perfect example

[Chorus]</pre>
