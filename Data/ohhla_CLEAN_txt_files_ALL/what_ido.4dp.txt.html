[ VERSE 1: Klas 1 ]
A nigga walkin down the streets and I'm tryina make it home
One-time's on the dick like I'm tryina get my serve on
Damn, I just can't fade this shit
I guess they thinks a nigga gang affiliated
Huh, just because I gots on a fuckin flanel
Slammed to the ground is how I'm bein handled
The cop had a MAC-10, he kicked me in the back and
Threw me on the car and punched me in the jaw
These motherfuckers tried to beat my ass to death
Fuck Rodney King, I'm thinkin 'bout my damn self
And I'm wonderin why me
I said, "What the fuck I do?" The cop said, "Don't try me"
Or we gonna have to whoop you
Nigga, you look suspicious, so we gonna have to book you
But what's my charge, Mr. Copper?
Is it because a young nigga live proper?
Or maybe cause my khakis sag
Searchin my pockets and all you find is zig-zags
But I smoked all the Indo
And if you give me the chance a nigga might go ( ? )
And then you can give me a case
But for right now get yo bitch ass out my face
Cause I ain't done shit for you to be sweatin me
What I do, what I do?

[ CHORUS ]
What I do, what I do, what I do?
Now I'm gettin jacked by the boys in blue
What I do, what I do, what I do?
Excuse me Mr. Officer, fuck you

[ VERSE 2: Big Boss ]
Rollin 4 Deep, try to make it home
Stopped to get some gas and use the pay phone
Rod took the money, went to pay for the gas
I'm talkin to this hoe tryina give me a piece of ass
I left my nigga in the backseat sleep
All of a sudden two fools tried to creep
Tip, tip, you better raise up out the car, bro
Or we gonna have to blast on your ass, hoe
What? Klas came to me sayin, "Boss it's a trip
Them niggas got your Benz, I got the Glock but where's the fuckin clip?"
They thought they got away cause I started runnin
Five steps later turned around and started gunnin
Hah, now I'm aggravated lettin off lead
Two to the head, yeah that bitch the driver's is dead
The car started swervin, it ran into a ditch
Don't you know, fool, this is Boss that you're fuckin with
Hah, I walked up to the do'
The other nigga cried like a hoe but he still had to go

Clicked on his ass till he shit in his drawers
Shit, damn, here come the motherfuckin laws
"Nigga drop your gun, face down on the ground"
"They tried to steal my..." - "Shut up, nigga, don't make a fuckin sound
We seen you shoot him in the motherfuckin face"
Now I'm in jail for a murder case

[ CHORUS ]
What I do, what I do, what I do?
Still gettin jacked by the boys in blue
What I do, what I do, what I do?
Laws packin they shit, so I'ma pack my shit too
What I do, what I do, what I do?
Excuse me Mr. Officer, fuck you</pre>
