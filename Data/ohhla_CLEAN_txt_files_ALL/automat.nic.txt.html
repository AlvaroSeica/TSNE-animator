[Intro/Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor to get with
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

[Nicki Minaj]
It's automatic I'ma run away train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'ma show you best side tonight, tonight, ni-i-ight
It's automatic my conditions alone
There's no remedy and no anidote
It's just the way that I am
Nicki Nicki so bad tonight, tonight, ni-i-ight

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
It's automatic some might call it insane
I assure I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be fallin for me boy
Yeah just like a domino tonight, tonight, ni-i-ight
It's automatic when I'm rockin the beat
Systematically I'm droppin your heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki Nicki so bad tonight, tonight, ni-i-ight

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Puh-puh, p-p-press rewind
Puh-puh, puh-press rewind
I'm-I'm, Einstein
I'm the controller, Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland
Scotland, I can idle in
South Africa, and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill
Bring bring, bring, bring the bill
Bri-bri-bri-bring-bring, bring the bill
Bring, bring, bring the bill
Shut the club down, bring the bill

[Chorus]</pre>
