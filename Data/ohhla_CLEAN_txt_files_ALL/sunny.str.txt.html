[Intro: movie sample]
Wait a minute, you can't see the tape?
FDR check him out, like he's some little freak
(You wait a minute...) No, no, man, you wait a minute, mister
I mean, lady, ya'll be showing people how you down with breakin'
And that's bullshit, because you ain't down with nothing
And you man, you was looking so proud
I found that nigga myself, do I get a A, teacher?
You just like all the biters, you just take a bite and leave the rest

[Chorus 2X: Christbearer]
Sunny, yesterday my life, was filled with rain
Money, the day we got it right, I feel the change

[Christbearer]
Nigga, I got it right today, I feel the change
Yesterday the rain drops fell over my brain
Sunny, the dark clouds have me blind
The ways of your sun rays I had to find
Money, we got it right this time
My brother spared a dime, while the note prepare to rhyme
Hoping the elevator world beyond with Melachi and Keyon
The stars bring big change, the young commode
The hot to cold, next day, the same, just we will remain
On another plane, doing our thing, West Coast, Wu-Tang
It's sunny in the future from the past
Gradually getting greener, on the grass and cash
We getting money now, making dollars and cents
The present tense of hits, convince evidence
The whole world seem brighter, for Dudley-do-Right
The survivor gauge, triple stage lighter
Today I feel a change, yesterday
I felt the rain drop on my dame, I can't complain
I rock wheels like Judge Mills Lane
And Frankie Lymon and Neil Diamond when the sun came

[Chorus 2X]

[Meko the Pharaoh]
Big faces, bitch chasing, mind scaping
Time changing, sunny, raining
I stay aiming for a higher position
Man wishing, dishing out them blind eyed missions
Equipped in all areas, my bars bury ya
Especially if you scared of the truth (nigga)
Northstar stay knocking down ya roof
Rocking muthafuckas with the new world proof
You snooze, you lose, you always get bruised
Fucking with the ultimate rules
And the North don't play that shit
Stupid bitches try and play that shit, and get hit
So let me zone with my NS, the core
While ya'll feel the sunshine of the world we born

[Christbearer]
The children of the corn, on the swarm, getting warm
Yesterday, my rose had a thorn
Today, the way the window pane reflect
The sun ray, rain, is a bygone thing
Listen, one lip, and you can observe change
The block won't stop calling me and Lil' Zane

[Lil' Disel]
Me and my peeps, we drink Henny, and flow til we brethrens
Like that Xzibit title, on they daily basis we Restless
In fact, check this, we the new Wizards like Jordan
Henchforth, is the North, cuz most of these other clicks is boring
Half assed and washed up, mad, cuz we popped up
Doing it our way, like some young Frank Sinatra's
And now, slow down on the strip, now we spitting it hard
Just like that brother I killed, what, we from niggas to Gods

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
