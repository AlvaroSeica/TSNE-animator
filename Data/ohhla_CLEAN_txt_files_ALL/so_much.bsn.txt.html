Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice
Debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I done lived a couple lives
Like why? cause I stunt, bags of trees, like it's fall
The girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard
And when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge
They gave us a bridge card, nigga
Ridin' low, puffin on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said "me and your grandma proud"
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me get a job, save up for a 401 (k)
Man I'd rather be young and shit, countin' $401k.
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs
B-I

(Been this way before)
(Dream of having so much more)

But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred (I deserve)

Throwin' westside up like Pac, when they pop ya block up,
B-blocka, Big Poppa flock off, you holy, lil wodi, holy cannoli, chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I betchu that you won't find it
Rocking Louie and MCM
Guess I'm closed (clothes) minded
Obama suite, you one below, up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding?
24k for the fit because it's 24 carats
And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-Town reppin'
And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I loved Ashlee Marie
And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy
Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy
And the whole world seen me
Bitch I know you seen me

(Been this way before)
(Dream of finding so much more)

"Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring"

Tell me that wasn't verse of the year
Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up
Man I turned impossible possible
And what these niggas can barely see in the optical
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
And said I'm throwin my life away if I drop outta school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything that they told me not to do
After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules
Little hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication
I'm yellin' fuck em all, with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'm a be the man til my fucking expiration

B-I-G, I do it
This goes out to my muthafucking city
Detroit, Westside to be exact
Right over there on Northlawn...
