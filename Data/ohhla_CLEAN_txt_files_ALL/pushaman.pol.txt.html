[Intro - Arlo Maverick]
Ladies &amp; Gentlemen (Yo)
We Are Back (Back again)
I'm sorry it took so long (Back again)
We had things to take care of you nahmean (Team, we are ba-a-ack)
 
[Arlo Maverick]
Now first things first, let me address the congregation
Hustlers, mothers, whatever the occupation
Your work, synonymous and if you're watching this
I tip my hat, with the raps I give back
I'm aware that the game provides so many options
But the fact that you're listening proves they are not him
They are not them, just replicas
And time will tell, no one can do it better than us 
Who, the Mavericks Team
And I'm a bring Elympia mad more cream
Doing for the city, what Jay did for Marcy
Without coke and braps, just dope raps
I will not lose as a matter of fact
With beats by Kaz you can kiss my ass
With a team so strong you cannot hold on
Just buy the ring tone and sing the damn song
 
[Chorus 2X - KazMega]
I'm that pusha,
Hustler in the alley
I support your habit
You support my family 
 
[Dirt Gritie]
Ayo, walking on a fine line balancing my options
Money or the fam, to me that ain't an option
For shooting off your mouth I'd advise you use caution
Words ain't bullets but they still can cause harm when
You in it for the money, in it for the glory
In it for the change or in it for the stories
Try'na build a brand but your name won't support
I came into the game with an aim that was honest
And for the cattle, parts are divided
As they buy studio time with no plan behind it
Not walking through this world blinded I keep my head
So erect that I bus like nuts
That thick rich intelligent stuff
And might birth a hot track within a few months
I might name it rock and roll Mary rock my soul
You want mo, then sing the damn song
 
[Chorus 2X - KazMega]
I'm that pusha,
Hustler in the alley
I support your habit
You support my family 
 
[Jay Stacks]
(STACKS!) I hear them calling my name
I'm from a different world, circle shades Dwayne Wayne
Bring the heat to the court, Dwayne Wade
Put the burner to your thoughts, torch your braids
I'm a vulture I don't know how to behave
But when you get me on beats like this I'm okay
J, S-T-A driving down the freeway
Aretha in my deck and I'm out for respect
Need a verse cut a check and I'll fulfill your order
My niece is doing good she listen to what taught her
Came from the corner, transitioned to an owner
See Sonia, told ya, now I don't want'cha
Said I don't want'cha, decline your offer
Now I'm back in the office conversatin' with lawyers 
(Yeah) Can't we all get along?
Upload to your iPhone sing the damn song (STACKS!)
 
[Chorus 2X - KazMega]
I'm that pusha,
Hustler in the alley
I support your habit
You support my family</pre>
