[Chorus - T.I.]
Hey, it dawned on me and
I see the big picture I know
On everything I love, I'm the shit and I know
To do it big, I gotta keep 'em out my business I know
Because these niggaz like to gossip like the bitches I know
(I finally get it now), I see the big picture I know
On everything I love, I'm the shit and I know
I run this city, wish they was in my position I know
These niggaz softer than the pussies than the bitches I know (I know, I know)

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Aye, what it is big dog? I know I'm the shit 'cause
I bounce back, totally recover from a pit fall
Don't make you a fighter just because you got your fist balled
It's get right and get paid or good night and get lost
Bitches talk big shit, even when my dick soft
Everyday my birthday, they just wanna get they licks off
Rocket ship lift off, come sit on my launch pad
G5, mile high, group sex, jet lag
Bullion, checks, cash, millions, just stashed
Even if you hate me, surely you respect that
Yeah, you're now rockin with the best dad
Chicks see me and be like "look at T.I. with his sexy ass"
Wishin they could take a ride on my mustache
Or maybe see the inside of my plush pad
But I must pass, I know what you on homie
Up late one night, early morning and

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Aye, all my motherfuckin life, I'm so motherfuckin tight
They say "he think he the shit", I say "you motherfuckin right"
Teach a motherfuckin dyke to learn to love suckin pipe
Buses, cars, trucks and bikes in my yard, up the price
of my performance, now I'm goin for a half a mil' a night
Quarter million just to party, if you gossip, get it right
Niggaz shiest but I know somethin if I put in a nigga life
It's gonna begin a nigga trip to God and end a nigga life
Man I keep it one hundred, a thousand to be precise
If you 'round me frontin, go find a mountain and take a hike
Yeah I know you set your sights on me, tryin to get stripes homie
Look smaller but feel bigger in real life, don't he?
I'm all that and more, ain't nothin about the hype phony
I'm sharin life moments, can't nobody write for me
You a one trick pony, I'm quadruple threat homie
Up late four in the morning and

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
I'm clearly somethin special, officially I'm the best who
Did it in my city and even in the U.S, you
Must agree, they can't fuck with me, I'm a beast unless you
Hatin, you ain't gotta be sneezin for me to "bless you"
If the records don't hit you, I bet the movie'll get you
If cool don't seem to catch your attention, I'm a impress you
With swagger long term, Hollywood bitches to tag along
Groupies just imagine on, they know what I'm braggin on
I got a message you can pass along, tell a friend
We gettin long paper Jay, we made it back from Hell again
Been knockin on Heaven's door, residin there forever more
Promoters, this worth every cent, you couldn't buy a better tour
And you are forced to admire the Messiah
Expressin your desire, you're just preachin to the choir
The nation has inquired to hear your Majesty, Sire
I'm flyin high up one mornin and

[Chorus]</pre>
