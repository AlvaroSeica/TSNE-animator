I'm too powerful, you horrible
Ain't nothin sweet, cute, neat, adorable
It's deplorable, I get this green like chlorophyl
The order's full, so I throw a audible
Ey, I'm sort of ill
Homie, you better chill
You get a head of steam and the head is still
The lead is real, Ed is real
You feelin like the driver, take the steering wheel
I been smart, you been dumb, and then some
I turn outcome - into income
You lose some, you win some
I'm at the wind, son
Or the (?), head coach you (?)
Hey, you fillin in, Edo's ill again
For them dividends, on my own like Gilligan
The ground I broke, dog, you just drillin in
This is hardcore rap, ain't nothin feminine
Edo's incredible
Your writing style unlegible
New England safety, James Ihedigbo
I never step foot on a pedestal
Blew once, second time inevitable
Caught the pain, fought the fame
This game will lend you an umbrella
Take it back when it starts to rain
And I don't floss for birds
Never at a loss for words
This, that and the third
Haven't you heard, my verbs never slurred
Prefer the absurd till money is transferred
You unheard, young bird
When beef gets stirred you get bullied like Young Berg
I throw a new pitch, thugs do snitch
Gangster's played out, smart's the new rich
