[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Now I'm gonna tell you bout this flippin
When I ride down the strippin
Bentley rolls on these hoes
Couple months a nigga be flippin
And you always see me glistenin
Window down bumpin system
Some of these cowards out here hatin
Keep on hatin cause I aint finished
Just a nigga from the hood
Tryin to keep it to the good
Wit dem gangs run the street
And they push dem Cadillac woods
And dem fellas on parole 
Tryin to keep them pockets swole
But we gotta trust dem gods 
Neither one can save our soul
From these crooked ass cops
That'd be rollin down our block mane
Tryin to flip dis change 
But they fuckin up my stock mane
Baby need sum shoes 
And my broad need some weed
But I cant work no job
So I'm out hurr smokin weed
And I gotta keep on hustlin
Cause a nigga gotta eat
You can find me at the candy ladies
Slangin packs of P
Minimum wage five fifty 
And they wonder why we deal
Why niggas always stressin
Drinkin liquor 
poppin pills

[Chorus: Frayser Boy] + (Juicy J)
The game aint the same, we done changed the game
Stay the fuck away from us, we dont fuck wit you ladies
The game aint the same, we done changed the game
Stay the fuck away from us, we dont fuck wit you ladies
(So I hit the dope, grab the glock, and the chrome, and the rocks)
(On yo block, in your fuckin face, hit this all off)
(So I hit the dope, grab the glock, and the chrome, and the rocks)
(On yo block, in your fuckin face, hit this all off)

[Verse 2: Frayser Boy]
Nigga I dont fuck witch you
Nigga u dont fuck with me
Dogg you talk behind my back
Just because the shit you see
Man you got yo bitch ways
Glocks up in ya just like a hoe
When you mention pimpin
Best believe it
My niggas let me know
All up in my niggas face
Got my name up in yo mouth
Dont make a nigga like me
Knock yo fuckin grill out
So you best chill out
Keep everythang on the straight
Dont be smilin in my face
And when I leave dogg you hate
When I see you man we sweet
Just before the shit go
Nigga I aint fuck yo bitch 
So what the fuck you hatin fo
Ol shaky ass nigga 
I aint bust a fuckin grape
Wanna throw sum fuckin bows 
Nigga I'll participate
Leave the brakes off yo ass
Nigga you dont think I will
If you wanna keep some peace between us you better chill
Just because I dont talk shit
Doesnt mean I wont bust heads
So dont let nobody else 
Tell me bout some shit you said hoe

[Chorus]</pre>
