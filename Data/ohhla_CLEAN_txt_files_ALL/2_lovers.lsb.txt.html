(Chorus Repeat 2X)
Two lovers
And I'm ashamed
Two lovers and I love them both the same

(Verse 1)
You know I got two lovers so just call me the mack
As I slang my dirt like this and like that
Kickin up dust from sun down to sun up
Cause for me and mine it ain't nuttin but a come up
What's goin round another sets out to get me
Sweat me
In other words wet me
But the homies from the hood they got my back
Together putting it wide cause it's like that
One for all and all for one
Yo, there ain't no sunshine where I'm from
So I live my life by putting in work
Everyday all day cause I got it that way
Strivin to survive to keep my family alive
Cause it's not goin to work with a 9 to 5
So I live my life up under the covers
And they call me the man with two lovers

(Chorus Repeat 2X)

(Verse 2)
Well I got two
Not one plus a daughter and a son
I live day by day troubles put me on the run
I stay so comployed to buy each kid a toy
Plus I pay the rent
See that's how my money's spent
Now as for my lovers I got it undercover
Only one fives and tens just to buy the milk and butter
But that's okay they don't know I got a bank roll
Fatter than the super bowl and still play the hero
A zero I'm not
And I got a lot of pride
Brown pride that is
So a few of you might not understand
I got the juice together of own brown clan
So I'm the man
Who keeps the life just to keep my family strugglin
The pot is hot and keeps on bubblin
With the lord next to me I'm no different from the others
Except two lovers

(Chorus Repeat 2X)

(Verse 3)
Now I ve been there and done that
Came up like a fat rat
Ain't like they see me
Can't be that with a bat
Cause players only love you when they are playing
And if you are playing you know what I'm saying
I'm at the poin of no return
So take it from cause I ve already been burned
And now I'm singin that sad sad song of how I ved so fast and died so young

(Verse 4)
And all good lies must come to an end
If you think this is right you better ask a friend
Coming from another side point of view
I can feel the heart beat
So can you feel it too?
Life in the hood shouldn't be like that
It gets kinda rough when you gotta use a gat
In fact when you have to live with some others
Yo, I'm talking bout two lovers

 (Chorus)</pre>
