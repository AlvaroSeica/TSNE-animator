[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo it's the mixtape bitch, guard your life
I spit like the mandible, sharp as a knife
Sit like Chris Reeves and study, Aim At M.C.'s
Sit like Chris Reeves, study, Aim At M.C.'s
Apparition in the booth, John Brown
Eagle talents rain from me in the cirrus cloud
Hope in his ?
Dope in his desolate pockets
Don't put the world in his hands he might drop it
Then blackness, Bronze might run this rap shit
If I can get my packets wrapped up in plastics
Snatch up the asses, lung verse that crash kid
Scrape up your double helix, just like new shuttle pieces
Swarm with Killa Beez, still had a cold summer
Gone 'Til November, still came home to fuck her
Still in the picture frame, rockin' the SampsonMay
Dabble with ample reign, my brain stains your brain
Like the Zodiac, slave chains ain't hold me back
Handcuffs your threat and now fuck Judge Jordan
Whine like the Spartans when blood just pours in
Whine like the Spartans nigga, blood just pours in</pre>
