Flipsyde

You used to call me
Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way
We kept keeping on, feelings were so strong

Always knew that I would occupy your mind
You would always find a little more time
To show me I was number one
Put me there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone

When it was good
We were sitting on the top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right, not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world

When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would, would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world

That picture of everything I ever dreamed
Now the picture's crashing down around me
Calls are coming in and we're looking at our friends
Wondering who's it gonna be

It was so good, once upon a time
It was a simple time, it was a good time
Now we got the perks and all the cr√®me
And it's tearing us apart at the seams
But I remember

When it was good
We were sitting on the top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right, not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world

When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would, would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world

Yeah
Once upon a time it was real
Once upon a time I was thrilled, to get yo call
Then I could get yo all
Then I could get your heart
Now ain't the same
Seem like now it's a game
Once was reckless, but now it's tame
Once was real love and now it's fake
Who would've known this path we'd take

Yeaahhhh

When it was good
We were sitting on the top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right, not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world

When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would, would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world

When it was good
We were sitting on the top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right, not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world</pre>
