Let's kick it ese

[B-Real]
COMIN' OUT DA SLUMS!!! It's da hoodlums
I'm pullin' my gat out on all you bums
So bring it on when you wanna come fight this
Outlaw, kickin like Billy Ray Cypress Hill
Chill, I'll bust that grill
Grab my gat, and load up the steel
And if you wanna get drastic
I'll pull out my plastic glock, automatic
Synthetic material, burial plots in order
Headed down to the Mexican border
Smokin' that smellie, Northern Cali
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum - hear the gat come, boooooommmmmm!
Let me see what you'll do
It's a sin to kill a man
But I'll be damned if I don't take a stand

[Chorus]
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out!"
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out!"
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out!"
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out like that!"

[Sen Dog]
I'm high strung, click I'm sprung
Cause I don't live on the hum-drum
Where I'm from, the gats'll be smokin'
I'll be damned if you think I'm jokin'
Know - that I'll come with the static
Erratic, .45 automatic
Screamin' at ya, the red lights beamin' at ya
No need to run after
The punk-ass hook, in the oven I'll cook
Dig the grave for the one who got played
Now he's under, don't make Stevie Wonder why
Cause he'll testify

[Chorus]

[B-Real] 
I got you thinkin' "What the fuck is this?" 
Lettin' you know I take care of business
Can.. I.. get a witness?
To verify when I depict this style
That makes you ecstatic
Tragic, when I get a poof of the magic buddha
When I roll with my crew
I betcha one time can't find my hootah
In my vehicle with the belt unbuckled
Pig rollin' up but he ain't that subtle
Pulled to da curb, so we exchange a few words
But he got me stirred up, enough to grab the handcuffs
I'll huff-n-puff and blow ya head off!

[Chorus]

[Sen Dog]
Yeahhh!  Takin your disses and dissin y'all right back
Dissin the Cypress Hill crew, like we ain't shit
You little taco stand rapper, eat a bowl of dick up
Then you got my man (?), you can eat a bowl of dick up
Anybody got beef around the way, yo
EAT A BOWL OF DICK UP!! GEEEYEAH!!</pre>
