Yeah, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
Yeah..

Yes, G-U-Y and I
Gotta get a piece of this pie
Gonna take you on a high
Do or die
Are you with it
Cause you can be the one who can get it
And if I get money we can split it
If I gave you my life could you live it
Would you feel it?

Now who wanna be the freeloader?
Who wanna be the shareholder?
Who's gonna be the downloader?
Cause when I download this [shit] on the black
All consumers just be ready to cop, cause I'm ready to drop
* rumble noise * The video pop
You better let me know, if you want it or not
Yo, it's gon' be gone by the end of the day
Cause the [shit] is headin Y2K

Cause I'm talkin bout the best
Take it to the Wild Wild West
Talkin bout the Dirty South
That's what I'm all about, no doubt
Take it to the East
Gotta move fast in the streets
Cause I'm livin in the belly of the beast
I'm just tryin to live in peace

And now we rollin on the Southside
With my true player ? from the Eastside
Got my shorties in the back and my [niggaz] in the front
and my fifteen inch rims on my whoride
Now who rides, rollin through the A-T-L
So don't trip, cause you bout to get yourself
in some [shit], and you know we got your back
All the clubs are packed, from front to back, the girls are fat
Booty bangin like a buddha sack
And when you're livin in the ghetto
you gotta know when to let go, how to hold, let the dice roll
All your plannin from ? go
puts the prices on your soul
And everyday's in vain, treatin your love
like a Monopoly game, and everybody's lookin
for the fortune and fame, that's the name of this game

Cause I'm talkin bout the best
Take it to the Wild Wild West
Talkin bout the Dirty South
That's what I'm all about, no doubt
Take it to the East
Gotta move fast in the streets
Cause I'm livin in the belly of the beast
I'm just tryin to live in peace

[1 Life 2 Live]
Only the best, like pushin black Bentley Coupes
You ain't the best, so that just can't be you
Only the best, like coppin you a platinum piece
You ain't the best, [nigga] you too [god damn] cheap
Me?  Toxic, I spit vintage
Everything you talkin, you know we been did
You kick one rap and you all winded
Your career, real quick, started and ended
We the elite, means we the top of the line
Means we go straight in while you stoppin in line
Means, I don't give a fuck what you got in your rhymes
Means y'all get to goin when I'm cockin my nine
When Teddy told me to pull, the [shit] hit me hard
Pay him HOW MANY THOUSAND for sixteen bars?
You whylin, you gon' regret that you started this mess
Got 2-G, you'll never be part of the best

[Guy]
Cause I'm talkin bout the best
Take it to the Wild Wild West
Talkin bout the Dirty South
That's what I'm all about, no doubt
Take it to the East
Gotta move fast in the streets
Cause I'm livin in the belly of the beast
I'm just tryin to live in peace, roll out

I'm talkin bout the best
Take it to the Wild Wild West
Talkin bout the Dirty South
That's what I'm all about, no doubt
Take it to the East
Gotta move fast in the streets
Cause I'm livin in the belly of the beast
I'm just tryin to live in peace, roll out

Just tryin to live in peace, yeah yeah yeah</pre>
