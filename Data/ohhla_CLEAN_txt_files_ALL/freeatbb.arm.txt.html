[Intro: GZA (Armel)]
We got, Yeah, We got a lot of niggas up in here tonight, (Yo)
Yeah, (Ancient Coins shit) We got my niggas up in here
(Off the new album) Yeah, Armel, (Yo check this shit out, Listen) Yeah

[Armel]
If yall can spit we can spit, Please get it together
Anything you can do I can do better
Your image material looks, Hidin behind hooks
Raised to fear no one but self, Who's shook
Bring the plague like the Revelations in the holy book
Whose spot yous took, Dukes off the hook
I'm from the land of the crook
Like the man better known as the brook
Brother take the lint, There's a lot of wack records
This aint one of them, DJs off the books, Go head put the gun at them
All groupie MCs about to start sonnin em
Don't matter what crew, Every last one of em
Getting crowded in here, Some acts got to go
LetÂ’s start be eliminatin groups that can't flow
I bet a meal, My deal, My career with no fear
That none of yall dudes can touch what's over here

[GZA]
You ruff cut metal tape, Quick to break your label mate
Won't hesitate, Negotiate your table stakes
You can't flow right, Leave the show right
Yeah get your flow tight you need to get your, Yeah

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, GZA mack, Legend of the Liquid Sword
Yeah, Go get that right now baby
Check it, (Prodigal Sunn) Yo RZA
Let me tell you about these niggas son, Yo Yo</pre>
