"On and on, to the break of dawn" {*4X*}

[Ad Rock]
Now, let me introduce myself, I'm Ad Rock (Rock)
No matter what you order from I got it in stock (stock)
We doin our thing, well we got it on lock (lock)
Gonna pop off the lip with the old non-stop

[MCA]
So take it from me now I'm gonna give it all I got (got)
I'll take a licking, still tick tick tock (tock)
Smoked salmon, ate old school lox (lox)
A zooted buddha baby and I buy gray socks

[Mike D]
It's Mike on the mic and I'm known to please (please)
Stinkin, nasty, like the head cheese (cheese)
Cat scans, honorary degrees
Rhymes fresh pressed like eighty-three Lees

"You can't stop you've got to keep on"
"Keep, keep-keep-keep, keep-keep on"
"You can't stop you've got to keep on"

Well that's all I got, except I just got...
{*unintelligible*}

[Mike D]
Touchin all my nails when my feets in the cab (cab)
I am {?} but her past is bad (bad)
All you perfect bums that are into crabs (crabs)
Come take a shower and wash that ass

[Ad Rock]
Rock non-stop in the New York City (City)
Got the heat on the mic lookin so damn pretty (pretty)
Sittin by me well it must feel shitty (shitty)
The real thing to say - here it goes - tough titty!

[MCA]
I got my rhymes in the picture and it's time to floor (floor)
I'm at the two and I'm screamin four (four)
Get into your party as I declare war (war)
I'm gonna feed this hunger that smile like a dinosaur

"You can't stop you've got to keep on"
"Keep, keep-keep-keep, keep-keep on"
"You can't stop you've got to keep on"
"Keep, keep-keep-keep, keep-keep on"
"You can't stop you've got to keep on"
"On and on, to the break of dawn"</pre>
