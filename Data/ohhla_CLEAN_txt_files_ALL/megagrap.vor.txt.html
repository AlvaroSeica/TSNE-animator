[Verse 1]
Trapped in the darkness
Spittin' these raps like we trapped up in Spofford
Goin' through nonsense
Spittin' forbidden raps off the noggin
Trapped up in Gotham
Rappin' assassins from Harlem
Burn you trash-ass rappers to ashes
We sparkin' the L's in the parkin'
Burnin' the cess and reflectin' on life as a young adolescence
Pressin' the pen to the page, learn the lessons
No worries, no stressin'
Just tryin' to calm the pain, so I bomb my brain
Straight up, with Absolut vodka
Tryin' to get at these coppers
Who lettin' off 41 shots on the block-a
Represent heavenly divine, and we'll pop ya

[Hook]
It's like war on the ghetto on streets
It's like war givin' metal to beasts
I got caught tryin' to settle some beef
Now I chill, tryin' to get up in me
Writin' these raps, blazin' them trees
It's like war on the ghetto on streets

It's like war givin' metal to beasts

I got caught tryin' to settle some beef

Now I chill, tryin' to get up in me

Writin' these raps, blazin' them trees

[Verse 2]
Ready to put holes in you crime unit po-nuts
Eatin' jelly donuts, chillin' on the block and we go nuts
These cops tryin' to blow up every damn spot
And you know what, I'ma stay bustin' Ghetto Revolution
Blinkin' wit the luger, doin' what I gotta
Trapped in that everyday saga, bustin' for Diallo
Livin' trapped in the Apple where it's rotten
Cats stay plottin', fiendin' in the market
Knowin' us niggas is nothin' but targets
Starvin', surrounded with nothin' but everyday problems
Bust Ghetto Rev, bust Ghetto Rev
Bust Ghetto Rev, straight to the head
Puffin' on a beadie, yo, pump Megilah graphitti
Live and direct, interject with thoughts that get me vexed
Bitches and Becks get me wet
Hyped on the set, bustin' Ghetto Rev 'til I'm dead
Crackin' dutches to fuck up my head
It's like everyday it rains
Sometimes it feels like I'm trapped in a maze of pain
Tryin' to escape insane thoughts that cross my mind
In due time, I was like...taught divine
Holdin' the mic, starvin' to shine
Writin' these lines you snort, to pop the cork
Everyday remain live, 'cause animals rock
New York, it's like we pop all sorts of pills
To painkill, yo, days that's cold
I stay froze, trapped inside New York, the Cold Vein
Just a blood vessel tryin' to move, but I own pay

Straight up, raps thats raw, not, ugh
Raps thats raw, Ghetto Rev, Ghetto Rev
You know, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Hook]
It's like war in the ghetto on streets
It's like war givin' metal to beasts
I caught caught tryin' to settle some beef
Now I chill, tryin' to get up in me
Writin' these raps, blazin' them trees
It's like ... in the ghetto on streets
It's like ... givin' metal to beasts
I got ... tryin' to settle some beef
Now I chill, tryin' to get up in me
Writin' these raps, blazin' them trees

Zach One on the boards, you know
We out in the street doin' our thing, whatever
It's all clever, Megagraphitti
Straight up for you Rap City niggas
*Sirens* Oh shit, po' comin', let's slide man, let's slide</pre>
