[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, peace Stones, what up?
I was just a linger my mode
Why what's gold? That's what I was doing though, holla

[Lounge Lo]
Duquan with the Yukon, seats is luke warm
Interior cashmere, floor match his futon
And I see that two on, but this is me
You fuck with me and I'mma make sure you gone
I know cats that move on and move out
Do sticks, jump in they whips and cruise out, like
I pass piff like Poupon, me and my niggas
We still rock, to them good ol' Wu songs
And who said that the Ooh was gone?
I heard it's money on my head and ya'll taking too long
I might be right and I might be wrong
I even got Ghost Killah screaming 'yes my Lord'
The way I bumpatry, everything Lord, my yes-yes
Shout to Wu-Mami, yes, Lord my steff-steff
I'm Most Popular, Staten's hometown
The cop killa, top peeler, that shit goes down
So fuck a train ride, I'm right at the bus stop
And right there lingerin', before I bust shots
Rappers still fronting, like, what happen and what not
The zone that I'm in is Meth rapping to "Blood Clot"

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Lo]
I said, why niggas acting, they act like movie stars
When shit hit the fan, then they escape like moving cars
Tell cops who shot 'em, Big Ooh in the photo op
That's the nigga right there, and yeah, I wanna blow his top

[Lounge Lo]
Ma, dang, your gang, we can ride tonight
I know big big Bloods, who wear five on them stripes
Fuck the law, old lord, twenty five to life
And peace to Big Un with twenty five to life
And the hood ain't the same, it change, it's all lame
And niggas in the game with 'caine, they all strange
That's why I ball in the hall with them thangs
And the conehead hood, must have the draw strings
I'm back to business, and Cap's my witness
If you test Lord, yes, you get clapped with the biscuit
Muthafucka, you ain't nice, don't act suspicious
And yes, I know Trife, I throw you back to the fishes
No gun, no knife, you get cracked with dishes
By me, L.O.B., and I'm back for Christmas
And my dad always told me, to watch them niggas
And at the same time, you might have to slap some bitches
Park Hill, what it be like, I be like Big Don
The whole Staten Island, yeah, get ya'll shake on
I post up Stone, with a bottle of Patron
And make sure I get it man, before my day gone

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Got muthafuckas talking... knahimean
Let alone, niggas get with they chicks
And talk to they bitches in the house, man
But just imagine when they call up the man
And talk to the mans, and be like
Lounger did this, Lounger did that
Knowhatimsaying? Come on, this Most Popular Son, man
I got connects to get your girl popped, and all that man
You deal me? This is what I do, stay soffy, man
Everything orthopedic shoe, man
I'm the rider for Staten Island, man
Fuck with your boy, and fuck what you heard
And I dare one of ya'll niggas to even come and try and front on me
That's word to my momma, holla at the Yessa</pre>
