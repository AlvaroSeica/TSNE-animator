My main chick caught me cheatin, OOOH I'm Tiger Woods (OH!)

Ev'rything cool 'til I black out, OOOH you 'gon get it
Run it back you be my target, OOOH I'm 'gon hit it
Niggas see me with the strap out, OOOH they start snitchin
Fuck the wrong bitch raw then it's OOOH when your pissin
All I do is blow paper, OOOH I got to get it
Back to bag my two Ferrari's, OOOH I just shitted
Come through, bumpin Murda, OOOH I make 'em sick
It's a warning, I'm tired of warning them pricks
I tell the homies to drop 'em not even the D's can stop 'em
Bottles and bottles we pop 'em they scream we sit there and watch 'em
Trust me they move on we got 'em, got them Gemstars and the chopper
My niggas pull 'em and pop 'em click clack now back yo' ass back!!!

[Chorus: Mariah Carey] (*Female) (**Young Jeezy)
