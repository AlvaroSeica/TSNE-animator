[Chorus: Jesse West (True Love Everlasting)]
What's your name, son? (I'm True Love Everlasting)
Are you a thug or a God? (I'm God)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[True Love Everlasting]
Now the Gods walk the streets, the same as the next man
We say "Peace", and give niggas pound and spark land
We see the overall picture, and rush to make plans
While you put your life right, into the next man hand
Survival of the fittest, mad ghetto, hard hitters
New York City's finest, greatest rhyme spitters
When it come to this game of life, they all beginning
Playing in the game of death, they all winners
Them niggas start selling they ass to eat dinners
They don't care, they going all out, they all sinners
I guess they said 'fuck it', once the Devil jumped in us
We can let his ass do what he want, until he finished
The Gods give us gas to, when we have to
But we don't put that, on every track, that we rap to
We could still build and spark L's, when we come back, dude
But if you sling shots, we sling 'em right back at you

[Chorus: Jesse West (RZA)]
What's your name, son? (Eighteen, Twenty-six, One)
Are you a thug or a God? (God Cypher Divine)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[RZA]
Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah, never reneggin'
Don't fuck with the dead pigeons or pigskin
You fuckin' fake, 85 percent snake
Derelict ass bitch, you dead weight
Ain't no fire escape in hell, every devil ain't pale
I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds"
Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall
Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I'm hurlin' ya'll
Lightin' bolts, by writin' quotes
Strikin' jolts that frightenin' adults
From A to Zig-Zag, you get smacked, bitch, thrown into a shitbag
Bust like the spermbag, because your germ had
You on some fake thug
Drunk from the drink and gassed up by the drug
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis
While the Gods rebuildin' Jerusalem, living inside golden palaces

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What's your name, son? (Jess West from the beam)
Are you a thug or a God? (I'm G-O-D, son)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so (true that)
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[Jesse West]
Now when I drop degrees, 85 percent freeze
I bomb 'em with no problem, when they ease up
I squeeze off, I represent for O.G.'s
Who lay up in the cut, save that, roll trees
Used to flip bricks, and shit, sold d's
Did a bid, came home, switched my whole steeze
I'm only in the game, to win more cheese
And you thugs who ain't show me no love, can hold these
My game Trump tight like Biggie and Lil' Cease
I reign on MC's like Wu-Tang Killa Beez
I got peeps that hold heaters, cuz they need that
And ain't scared to roll either, thinking something sweeter
Cats roll up, they say West, is you the hardest?
I say "Do Method Man know where the buddha spot is?"
Do 24/7 get paid regardless?
They try hard but couldn't stop it, when we dropped this

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What's your name, son?
Are you a thug or a God?
Peace, son
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak</pre>
