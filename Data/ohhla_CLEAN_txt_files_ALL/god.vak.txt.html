Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em
Talkin to you

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm from the era where we murk the bearer of bad news like Leonidas
And family don't speak till tragedy reunite us
Scout to see who tightest and slay hordes
Who want test V-A sword?
I wanna meet the 'Fockers', no Gaylord
A angelic presence, the delegates' blessin
It's hell against heaven
My flow is God's relic in essence
Why in the fuck is you replicas testin?
With a delicate pressin
I can blow you to maggot delicatessen
They restless till I'm soul-clapped with no mercy
Till they witness the crown get hold captive and murk me
No industry flow active can hurt me
The upper echelon's about effective as Proactiv to herpes
Instruct spit to keep niggas with chalk employed
The god's fully armored, the prodigy talk is void
What part 'beast' you don't understand?
I write the sickest shit to hit white sheets since cross-burnin Caucasoids

[ CHORUS ]
(V) A Verse for all the fallen that left me
(A) May the Armor of God protect me
(Kill) everything that's movin expect me
If you offended then I'm talkin to you directly

(Watch out)  --&gt; KRS-One
(Come correctly when testin this)  --&gt; Lil ' Fame
(I done had it here)  --&gt; Royce da 5'9"
(Baddest dude)  --&gt; Royce da 5'9"
(Yeah)  --&gt; Royce da 5'9"
(You already know) --&gt; Beanie Sigel

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm sick as an abortion activist/germ biochemist
Strapped by yo clinic
Clappin clients with a grill that's cryogenic
The ice that my tear ducts cry authentic
Enough to hypothermia what I breathe upon
Even freeze a pond
The game'll never be fixed
Cause every new nigga heavily bricks
And exploited like '70s flicks
Machine and beast cleverly mixed
So fuck around and get carried by six
Like the Nuggets in '76
I'm a G, fucker, a sick migraine
Cross-contaminated with strychnine strains
And click - nine's aimed
Split a soul three ways in a auction
You Celebrity Fit thugs weighin your luck and weighin your options
Subsequently no slugs can dent me
Spit freeze, whatever rubs against me, I creep like a stealth winter
Frost-bitin shit till your health splinters
This is I-fill in the blank-Lord and Master, bitch, I'm Self-centered

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Niggas want me to rehash beef with Twista till the target's destroyed
Run up on him in '106 &amp; Park' with the toy
Fuck all that, that's a marketing ploy
In fact, I'm proud of what the nigga accomplished, bark at ya boy
Envy breeds from not stackin right, not packin pipe
Insecure non-tough, tough-actin tinactin types
You clients of panda-pussy pimpin
The source of your extinction in existence is right here in black and white
Till I'm emancipated
I birth terror that stands Al-Qaeda
Switch up, give a fuck if fans okayed it
All I got is my balls and my word
If the streets hold me to my word
We already know where your hands located
Your fears confirmin my thesis
The time fabrics in permanent creases
Pressin the luck you weigh
When bucks spray you lay
Uckfay ouyay
Want some positive shit? Motherfucker play Lupe

[ CHORUS ]

(VA)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(I'm not the one)
(Motherfucker, you fuckin with)
(The hardest)
(Oh)
(Motherfucker, so be careful who you fuckin with)
(Motherf...)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)</pre>
