[Intro: Jae Millz]
Can't fuck with me, huh
I'm from the click called N.I.B.
Move back, move back, can't fuck with me
Huh, I'm from the click called N.I.B.
Huh, yeah, you know what it is, Harlem
Get ya face smacked in it, Harlem
Harlem, right here, Harlem
You stupid if you don't bounce to this man
You gonna only look like a hater, huh-huh
Lennox Ave. Boyz, what up, it's only right
They know what it is, man, remix

[Jae Millz]
Move back, its no touchin' me, I'm from that place called NYC
H Dub to the death, and I don't give a fuck what party it is
I'm still in the club wearin' sweats (hah)
Milk ears with the money colored check
Ill two step, blowin' dubs with the best
Live life, most hated, with my Lennox Ave. Boyz
Remix, Move Back, with Grease providing all the noise
Huh, your home boy game so raw
And I ain't even gotta say my name no more
Haters wanna give my name to the law
But punchin' and kickin', to kick us all, they can blame you for
Might catch me in the 'Lac with Snaps
Or lightin' sticky green 'dro, with Wink and Meeno
You from the hood and you ain't no coward, well me neither
And before you step on my sneaker, I really think you need to (move
back, move back)

[Drag-On]
This your boy to the dash
Same nigga, no talkin', just result to the mass
I stab niggas, throw the hawk in the trash
Peroxide my bullets, give the burners a bath
Three fifty Z, burnin' the Ave.
I'm old school, I still got the fiends burnin' the glass
I pull the pump off my waist, and dumb in your face
I'm a little bit too hard for the radios to play
I still can spit eighty miles an hour in a verse
And my Coupe go eighty miles an hour in reverse
I let my tool go, ya'll niggas just studio killas
Nigga, I'mma killa in the studio
I got guns that'll hollow a wall
Point it to your jaw, make you swallow it all
Ya'll niggas want hardcore?
What the fuck you think the R, Full Surface and D-Block is for?

[Cardan]
Big ask, who's back, that's P-Cardi
And what he in, what he in, he in a Fer-rari
You know I'm strapped, you know I'm strapped, I got the heat on me
And what I'm wearin', and what I'm wearin', a long Bigari
Thinkin' I'm Joe Clark, nigga, try to 'lean on me'
But if he is, like Biggie said, 'he gon' bleed'
Niggas ain't hard, niggas heart full of creatine
But go against that, green, I go against your, brain
And don't fuck with me and the kid, I've been a daddy all my life
No 'dro, we gon' blow that alley all day, say what
Act stupid, we gon' it crackin' here tonight
Greasin', Meen' on the front, with Snappy on my right
If rap don't work, nigga, we go to the kitchen
Those ain't hoes, so then you know we ain't pimpin'
I'm on, my toes, so nigga, no, I ain't slippin'
Too close, hold somethin', or now I know Cardy didn't

[Terra Black]
And if he know, what keep me little
Think you know, I think it later
See me, and my guns come to, just like a waiter
You up north, singin' just like Anita Baker
Make up your mind, then come and ready, feen to meet your maker
The man that laugh last, will surely laugh harder
Me have a gonna shut up and eat bars, and all of the prankster
With them and I for black gangster (huh, I'm from the click called N.I.B.)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
But drunk, when he hop inside, in the club gettin' tired
Bitches scatter all around me, ready to excite it
All these kittens got me flea bitten, eatin' out my mitten
I'm comin' off top, my moves are unwritten
Now slitter to the snake, in the spring time wither
But strong on my own, Wu-Tang, I'm forever
Women desirin', jobs is hiring
Money admiring, never keep it tiring
Dominate nothin', the easiest job ever
And I'm doing mine, holdin' it together
While money quadruple, from playin' the cripple
Drinkin' from a titty nipple, sippin' on ripple
Blunt keep on flippin', from keep gettin' dippin'
The mic I'm rippin', the record skippin'
The pussy drippin', the wet got me slippin'
The bitch I'm strippin', I'm platinum shippin'

[Chorus 4X: Jae Millz]
Move back, move back, you can't fuck with me
I'm from the click called N-I-B</pre>
