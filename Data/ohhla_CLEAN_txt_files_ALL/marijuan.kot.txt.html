[Daddy X]
I'm just gonna be getting stoned (getting stoned)
You'll never wanna legalize (legalize)
Marijuana, I'm just gonna be getting stoned
(getting stoned), cause it makes everything alright

[Richter]
Marijuana, yeah my one and only, she keeps me company
When I'm feelin lonely, we go together like cheese and bologna, if I was made of weed
Shit I'd even try to clone me
Natures gift filled up with her powers, a couple hits and im lit for hours
I'm talkin how high like the Sears Tower
I like my Skunk sweet and my peach is sour

[D-Loc]
Yeah I smoke the bomb you know its time to get it on
Roll it in a joint you can put it in a bong, fill your blunt up, smoke it til its dust
Theres no need to hurry theres no need to rush
Feel the rush when im all up in a cut, see me slowin down while y'all cats is speedin up
Never too fast I creep like a lowrider, fuck the cops when I puff

[Hook (Daddy X):]
I'm about to lose control I'll pack myself another bowl
Cause marijuana helps me with my high (marijuana) helps me open up my soul
Powers of a magic bowl, everythng is better when you're high. (marijuana)

[Richter]
(hey dude I saw that show) you can see I dont breathe (well no I dont smoke) well you know what I mean
When you're stoned it's a different zone your brains in heat
People get ta laughin at ya even im a comedian
And im gonna keep continuatin the fight til its legalized, til completely everytime that I aint getting high
So tell me why you want to fuck with me, come on dog let a stoner go free

[D-Loc]
Now ya didn't burn it back homie wheres your sack at, break out your bong dog where you at at?
Yeah we smoke kush and we smoke green crack, rollin endless blunts in the bus in the back back
Always smoked out always blowin clouds, I got the killa chronic and the dirty dirty mouth
24-7 stay high everyday, k-m-k stays blazed

[Hook (Daddy X):]
I'm about to lose control I'll pack myself another bowl
Cause marijuana helps me with my high (marijuana) helps me open up my soul
Powers of a magic bowl, everythng is better when you're high. (marijuana)

[Bridge: Daddy X]
I'm just gonna be getting stoned (getting stoned)
You'll never wanna legalaize (legalize)
Marijuana, I'm just gonna be getting stoned, cause it makes everything alright

[Daddy X]
Marijuana, yeah its a cheeba, chronic, page, stress a freedom leafa
You're the giver I'm the reciever, mary j make me a believer
Teacher teacher, oh faith'll teach ya, to reach a little deeper
Still old schoool I still call it reefer, mar-i-jua-na ow!

[Hook (Daddy X):]
I'm about to lose control I'll pack myself another bowl
Cause marijuana helps me with my high (marijuana) helps me open up my soul
Powers of a magic bowl, everythng is better when you're high. (marijuana) [x2]</pre>
