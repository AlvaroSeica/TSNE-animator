A whole lot of money and I'm still here nigga

[Hook]
You better believe it

[Young Jeezy speaking over hook]
I ain't never told on no nigga
I ain't never turned straight on no nigga
You know, I ain't never been in no nigga case or his paperwork
None of that bullshit nigga
You heard what I said
Yeah, better believe it nigga

[Hook]
You better believe it, you better believe it, you better believe it
My money don't fold I'm gettin' this dough
You better believe it, you better believe it, you better believe it
Always stay true stick to the G code
You better believe it

[Bridge]
I'ma stay on the grind get mine like a real OG (You better believe it)
I'ma still be me be the same ol' G (You better believe it)
I'ma rep my block every city, every town, everywhere I go (You better believe it)
That's if you didn't know (You better believe it)

[Lil' Boosie]
Ladies and gentlemen it's Boosie Boo 
King of Louisina I been the truth 
If you don't know betta ask somebody 
I am the show and the after party 
I'm stacking dough, ain't gotta sell crack no mo 
Still on my grind, got a lot of kids at home 
Gotta get it on, late night to the early morn'
Fifty grand in my pants like Ivy Smith 
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown 
Neck kind of freezy boy believe me
You can playa hate but take it easy 
We done got the streets, me and Jeezy 
Learned from the game how to stack the breezy
Got love from the hood so it's all good 
We both gonna eat, me and Jeezy
Riding down the highway (Zoom zoom) 
Forty-five on the side me (Boom boom)
Bad chick on side me (Ooh ohh)
She rollercoaster ride me (Whoa)
In the projects where ya find me
I got the hood behind me 
My records selling out the stores now 
My money don't fold now
You best believe it they feeling me 
From Alaska to Tennessee 
From the east to the west coast 
I smoke on the best smoke 
We pushing Lambos, Phantoms, and Bentley coupes now 
People hollerin' out the windown, hey Boosie you got the juice now

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy]
Stack brick on top of brick, yeah laid my
foundation till I built my house 
And it was mixtape after mixtapes and then the
next thing you know I was runnin' the South 
Streets introduced me to
the trap, see that wasn't enough see I wanted the world 
And that's about the time
my album dropped and the next thing you know I was pullin' the world
Who ya think ya is bitch, one of the girls
See ya ass in ya jeans makes me wonder girl
I'ma super nigga need a cape for me 
Real street niggas they relate to me
A big disappointment I would hate to be 
In the wrong place at the wrong time 
In the wrong line with the wrong man
Right car with the wrong thang
Can't tell me shit I'ma a grown man
Sixteen years old with a old thang 
Same clothes for days, same spot for months 
Two AKs and a box of blunts 
If it's money you want
then it's money you get 
Ya hang out with the boy then it's money you get 
Ya ever believe that I'd ever believe d
That I'd ever achieve what I ever achieved

[Webbie]
Stop this bitch let me tell the world something
From the bottom to the top
should of seen that shit
Me and my lil' thug gotta it from the mud 
Every thang I spit I really mean that shit 
It's crazy ain't it, hard to explain it 
I done got famous, all I did was bring it 
The Savage Life behind the mic, now everybody hollerin' about Trill Entertainment 
Rest in peace Pimp C, I scream that shit every time I do shows
You put me on and I ain't forget so
for my nigga I gotta fuck two hoes 
Whatever ya'll mean I aint got cream
If ya see me in the hood don't think I can't leave 
When I was nineteen I really had whole mill
These other lil' niggas just sellin' ya'll dreams 
I ain't through yet, I done done at all
But I got a lot of stuff I ain't get to do yet 
I fucked up, I ain't make it through school 
Wanna see if my kids gonna make it through that
From Miami to L.A. back to Manhatten where the big cake 
From Baton Rouge I done did it go ahead admit it I'ma the shit hey
And I don't care what a bitch say, I'ma be like this till I get gray 
And I ain't puttin' no rims on it, when it's five hundred ya ride factory 
The new album is on the way, when it's
the real deal ya know ya gotta wait 
Bad Azz gonna act a dog ass and ya'll already know this

[Hook]
