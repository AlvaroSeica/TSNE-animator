[Vinnie Paz]
I'm a fuckin warlord, what the fuck is you kiddin?
The gun's always by my side, it's a juxtaposition
I believe in Isa, but I don't fuck with the Christian
Ultimate killin machine I kill puppies and kittens
I kill anybody cousin why the fuck is you livin?
I take mines while you faggots is stuck what you given
I don't envy y'all dirtbags current position
Eating Crown Chicken stuck on the bus with your pigeon
I kill em all with my bare hands or the homey's shot
And fuck around with more grams than Naomi Watts
It's either war with myself or it's a holy plot
John tardy I hope that you faggots slowly rot
I hit you motherfuckers in the head leavin bruises
And if the Tea Party, win America loses
My hands clean but I still get you touched like masseuses
My therapist told me that workin with me is just useless

[Chorus 4X: Ghostface Killah samples]
{"Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?"}
{"Why did Judas grab the Romans while Jesus slept?"}

[Ill Bill]
Rebel conflict, military all green
Glenwood Projects, fifty-seven, fourteen
Money buys life or death; the best surgeons are the death merchants
Depressed urges lead to confessed murders
My whole family was in the projects
Paint chips we didn't have to eat cause Ruthie got wrecked
Pissy elevators, Marcus poured coke out his pockets
Eleven years old, talkin 'bout he's hopin to profit
We were the children of foreigners, born with the American dream
But then my Uncle was a heroin fiend
And there were things that he once assumed that he would never achieve
His legacy has affected people of every creed
Every religion and race, time or place, Earth or space
It's infinite, Uncle Howie Records is the name
I'ma speak my philosophy, you speak yours
I'ma teach my seeds well homey, you teach yours
As I walk through the valley of death, I fear no evil
Only the evil hidden in my heart could cause people
to throw prods in your face, even more lethal
Written in all Hebrew, fightin to break the spell of Kingu
Sent to notify the people blinded in they mental
Call me Paul Revere, war is here, listen careful
Orchestrate assassinations and massacres
Kidnap ambassadors, coronate kings, and kill savages</pre>
