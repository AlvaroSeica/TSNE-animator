(Fyah...)

[Big Gipp]
They call him Gipp Zagga, it's the mutant Mr. Get Down
Livewire, words poke you like barb wire
Maroon rain, sugar cane, oil stains
My right leg longer than my left foot
Put stripes next to squares, STILL get a circle
See spirits out for people, I don't see color
I'm a special mind, yeah a special kind
Conceived in the South at a special time
Covered in heaves of gold, scripture written in scrolls
Spoken so clearly in tounges, so my children would come
Look around, can't you see?
The industry, they look like me

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe] 
I don't wear the clothes you wear
I'm just different and I don't care
It's kind of sad and it's a shame
Everyone wants to be the same
If you are listening here and now
I'm sure I can show you how
It's okay to be afraid
Don't you wanna be special?

[Khujo]
I'm so special, boy title one stupid dumb
I eat nuclear waste and spit atomic bombs
Plutonium explodes, that's my trademark
Mushroom clouds and psychotic brainfarts
Gamma rays charge my system, now I'm going green
G-force in my veins pump hydrozine
KG 13, a microphone fiend
Cosmic juggernaut, extraterrestrial being
Reign supreme, once conceived, boy they broke the mold
All this glory-seekin is gettin tottally outta control
No one's original, +Attack of the Clones+
Invasion of the swagger snatchers, aim for the dome

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Scientists stood around in silence as I was being born
Was I quote-unquote "special" or was there somethibg wrong?
My skin was black, my heart was gold and my tounge was silver
And the fact that I could TALK already, that was a (THRILLER~!)
I fear what I don't understand so let me warn you
Especially when you make too much noise about bein normal
Unusual but beautiful, the bond, the blessing
Summa cum laude, School of Exceptional Youth, X-Men
Let me put something poetic into plain English
I'd rather die than to not be distinguished
Outsiders have no desires to be equal
When V.I.P. stands for Very Insecure People

[Chorus]

[T-Mo]
S-P-E-C-I-A-L
Heavyweight in the game, T tip the scale
I travel over the world back to ATL
I'm friends with the mayor, I'm a truth sayer
A crusader, a natural-born raider
I need a deejayer, to be the illustrator
Let's get it dollar signs, I said my Gucci rhymes
I think it's T time, don't need a co-sign
T-Mo is on the grind, I'm 'bout to let it shine
Off in the skyline, don't worry 'bout mine
I can handle lies, and watchin third eyes
I make 'em go blind, I don't just rap the rhyme

[Chorus]</pre>
