Song:   Where the Party At
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh, whoa, okay
Ha ha ha ha ha..
It's Chris Webby mother fuckers
Yeah
Where the party at?
Where the party at?
Yo back in middle school yo
This used to be my joint
For real
So let me get it uh
Yo..

I can't lie
All day
I'm a partier
I walk in more fly
Than Laguardia
Yeah I'm white
I don't mean to startle yah
I rep the burbs from CT
To Narnia

I'm talkin' Solo cups
Keystone Light
Cop 'em by the 30
Ain't no beating the price
When it comes to gettin' twisted
This dude here's gifted
Got cats and boss
And sayin' I'm wicked

'Cause if you bring a beat
Them I'm a bring bars
Then I'm a show you
Where the Wild Things Are
I make it rain till it's pouring
I don't spit game
I put my cleats on, bitch
And start scoring

Ye, I'm nice as fuck
So light it up
Hmm, where's the journalist
To write this up?
In the tabloids
'Cause I'm making mad noise
Fuck making a band, dude
I already know I'm a bad boy

'Cause the rules?
I don't follow 'em
And my family jewels?
She gon' swallow 'em
'Cause you know
I'll make your neighborhood rock
Turn the house party
Into fucking Woodstock

No cut, paste, and copy
Don't mean to sound cocky
But that's just my confidence, yo
And I'm hardbody
Cruisin'
Something like Ducatis
Maybe Kawasaki
I'm cooler than Lifanzie [?]

'Cause I've been a superstar
Ever since my mommy
Wen't into labor
Then out popped me
Not even a street sign's
Capable to stop me
Keep my lyrics stuck in your head
Like some Epoxy

Now, motherfucker
Comin' out of the south
On a CT
Get it poppin' off
And I'm out
I'm nice, so you better notice
Pop bottles with
Andy Sandberg and T-Pain
On a boat, bitch!

So honey how you doin'?
How's your night goin'?
We can head back to my crib
If you like boning
And I like boning
Until it's bright mornin'
And I'm a spit
Until I get my fucking mic stolen

But I won't allow a burglery
I'm goin' in like
Open heart surgery
Until I'm on TV
Like Ron Burgundy
I'm a spit until everybody heard of me

It's Chris Webby
Man
I said it's Chris Webby
Bitch
Where the party at?
Now, where the party at?
Where the party at?
Now where the party at?
Bitch, and I'm out</pre>
