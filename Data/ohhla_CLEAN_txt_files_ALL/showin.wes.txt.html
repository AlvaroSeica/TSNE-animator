Typed by: graumit@hotmail.com

I'm showin' you
Simply clean

CHORUS 
	"Between a rock and a roll, yibby yibby you"  X4

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
Dope hit after hit, bust lip after lip
Bitch lick after lick, no tricks or horror flicks
No review to see through preview to tease you
You can't leave, you're trapped I seized you
Caught in the rapture capture
Round house in the mouth, your speach I will fracture
Just I got juice, lyricist on the loose
What's this the recruits, regroup
I'm an arch hero rhymes from a barrel
Bust ass like glass to Elle Fitzgerald
Gazed, amazed, you crazed
Fully fazed and engraved, and I go on for days
I'm showin' you *echoed*
I'm showin' you *echoed*

Moses lead the people 'cause he was choosen
I'm like a sequel, 'cause I'm showin' you
The choreographer of this move, conductor of the dope state groove
Strapping always rapping like shoes I'm tapping
On the walls I'm slapping
Licking always ticking like my Rolex kicking
Stages to stages, I'm sticking MCs because on record they nice
But when you see them in real life they ain't worth the price
Because you bored right out of your skull, you rate zero
'Cause your hero is dull
I'll make it easy for you to get into me
I rock the concert hall just like a symphony
That's how it is I was born ready
Just like the bee Maestro stay steady
I'm showin' you *echoed*
I'm showin' you *echoed*
Break it down

CHORUS

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
I don't do needles and I never do coke
But I'm a LSD freak, my lyrics are so dope
Tell the folk, my vote no joke and you know it
I'm more than just a rapper, I'm a poet
T-O critics are hard to please
I've witnessed the death of many MCs
Just like birch, I down from the sky
But not me, years ago I made MC cry
But nowadays nobody wants to battle me
They just saddle me, sit back and straddle me
Ask me for forgiveness, I ain't forgetting it
Y'all wrote my rhythmn and now you're bowlegging it
I'm a professional, you're just a novice
Girls love me state to state province to province
Me and my homeboys they just jockin' us
We got variety, hell not monotonous
These are the rhymes you wish you was owning
But '89 is mine 'cause I'm showin' you *echoed*

Aries the Ram, I am hot damn
I say man, check my fans in the stands while I slam
Sometime I'm Aquarian or Sagitarian
Libra me cool, but Gemini vegetarian
Super dope step beyond, a Capricorn
Too many angles, damn I'm like a pentagon
Devil to death, I'm in depth
Multi-dimensional, more complex than a test
Everynight I rehearse each verse is diverse 
If I fuck up you will curse
But if you bite it out first, I was the first
All my reords you thirst
You jabba jaws on my dreaws since the day of my birth
And I'm showin' you *echoed*
'Cause you need to be shown
See you blew it you blown, and let my knowledge be known
That way there won't be an apocolypse
A rapper gel and jocking this
Clocking and you're talking, all I see is a flock of lips
Blabbering, slabbering, what are you saying?
You're spraying, delaying, stop playing
You got to adapt your own style of rap
Break away from the pack before you're trapped
I put a lash to your back to rap I'm like Zorro
The capital M-A-E-S-T-R-O Fresh W-E-S
Hell yes, the monologue I manifest is blessed
Are you impressed?  Yes, then forget the rest
Then climb aboard the Fresh express
'Cause I'm showin' you *echoed*</pre>
