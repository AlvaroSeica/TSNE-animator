[Intro: Iron Sheik on Howard Stern] + (Warrior impersonator)
Fuck that! (Sheik what happened?)
I heard about you! You can be son of a bitch
sometimes BAD, but I'm the MASTER of the bad
You lie to me again? (I'm sick, and TIRED)
(of what you've been saying about me in the media)

[Canibus - over Intro]
Lyrical Noir
This is Lyrical Law
Say it some more
Lyrical Law
Lyrical Noir
Yo

[Canibus]
Give me some more slack on this rope
I run your boney ass throat over in a zodiac boat
46 degrees North, 6 degrees East
The Large Hadron Collider gave birth to a beast that speaks
They quote my speech, vocal motifs over dope beats
All lyricists know me!
That's why the industry's debunkin my lyrics
with digital trunking equipment, they don't want you to listen
The Ripper's language won't appeal to the masses because they look past it
Only the masters know the seal of theSscarab
Some humans are born average based off environmental circumstances
You organic piece of shit, you sub-standard
But do not be embarrassed by your underdeveloped status
It's up to you to find the right questions and ask it
Research leads to results, sometimes we find meaning after
Other times they're just meaningless babblers
Don't believe these rappers, fake unbelievable bastards
Comet Elenin is comin straight at us, don't believe NASA
Take matters into your own hands
Stop being slow and actin like hoes, get with the fuckin program
Hip-Hop is the greatest genre known to man
If we focus, the poetry is so advanced
We can overthrow any plan and control man
You got soul? Let's Jam! "Lyrical Law," I'm the Canibus Man
What's the buy-in minimum? 88 sales program
and the number of stores, I don't care no more
This is Lyrical Law Noir hardcore raw metaphors for you and yours
You can't say you wasn't warned
Thousands of bars, them dummies couldn't stomach my bars
They rather conform, they throwin up they pompoms
You don't wanna wrestle with Armstrong
We sever blood vessels tryin to mess with the God's poem
Damage any motherfuckin beat that I rhyme on
Connect to the God's thoughts, possess your iPod, I grind hard
Intellectual hardboard, take it back to hip-hop +Style Wars+
Gruntin like a pack of wild boars
Power source "Lyrical Law," my bomb squad full force
Call 'em off we got too much torque
Nitrous oxide bars pull a bull of course
Pitch fork to you neck just to prove I'm raw
Iron horse, smack DVD, battle rap dwarf
Slap you with the flat part of the sword, now you back for more
Passing yourself off like a rap star
But you support whack bars that's why rap is lost
Fact! You a Cool J crack whore
You snitch like police labradors tryin to sniff out Sasquatch
Man up, no more lip service and back wash
Stand up! I'ma break off you're back paws
Thor's hammer crack jaws, attack y'all, fracture your skull
Mountain man axe to your loins
Self-employed like Donald Goines, cash cows on steroids
I don't fall for deceptions or decoys
I'm a beast and I'm clairvoyant
Your soy won't tear the beat up whether or not you appear on it
Double trouble dear promise fuck you and your comments
The chairman of "Lyrical Law" will be honored
The last man standin, after the internet is abandoned
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
Nekobs brainwashed Hip Hop, and they came from Saturn
They were the first alien race of rappers
They landed in North Africa, their teeth be gnashin
Their names look like acronyms, they released the Kraken
They live in underground cabins
They slither fast through the inner-earth labyrinth
They move in S-patterns though deep planet chasms
I chase 'em and trap 'em, detailin the action
for tryin to desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master, faggots
I laid them on top of each other like Abu Ghraib
They spacecraft look like the Eiffel Tower in Paris
They pray for my downfall to orchestrate all hip-hop's imbalance
They underestimated my talent
I hold the globe up like Atlas, they lied about Canibus
Ask 'em, I'm the world's greatest motherfuckin rapper~!
They slandered my character through private and public propaganda
They tell the people I'm Dr. Doppelganger
They ask me shit, that they know I'm not gon' answer
Extinction Level Event, they can't stop the disaster
Cocksucker stop the camera, cause you know that I'm a miserable bastard
I crack lens, break microchips and melt plastic
You Canibus? Who's askin?
That's Captain Cold Crush to you maggot, you a lyrical has-been
"Lyrical Law"'s a classic they can't get past it
The beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet
"Lyrical Law"'s a classic they can't get past it
The beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet
The microphone assassin 'bout to get at 'em
The Dragon of Judah breathe fire 'til his last breath
Full battle rattle in action lyrical metal jackets
Coming through with several new attachments
Computers is crashin, hackers is laughin
Rapid eye movement, try to keep up with the captain
What's happenin?

[Ultimate Warrior impersonator from Howard Stern returns]
I am a true champion, I will fucking beat your ass
Any time, anywhere, when the moon, and stars, and the planets align
I will beat your ass! {*scratched in: "he's my kind of man"*}</pre>
