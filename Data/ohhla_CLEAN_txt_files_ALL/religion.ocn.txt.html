[Frank Ocean]
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
and leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you
He said "Allahu akbar"
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion

[Chorus]
This unrequited love
To me it's nothin but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Frank Ocean]
Taxi driver, I swear I've got three lives
balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you, the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say "Allahu akbar"
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo you need prayer"
I guessed it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's a bad religion
To be in love with someone who, could never love you
Ohhh I know, only bad religion
Could have me feelin, the way I do</pre>
