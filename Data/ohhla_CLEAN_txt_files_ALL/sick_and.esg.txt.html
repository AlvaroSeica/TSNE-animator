[Hook] 
Now every chick, trying to claim that she better 
And every young nigga, claim he got swagger 
But how is that, it's gotta be impossible 
Everybody ain't a rapper, every chick ain't a model uh-uh 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
  
[E.S.G.] 
Now hey it's pay day, reality check on the way 
I got a PSA, a verbal AK 
They say they grown men, I see a bunch of kids 
It's time to see who's real, Donald Trump wig 
Say they do it big, real big folks 
What's the problem homie, you doing big bro 
Rolling big spokes, sitting on big smoke 
But let the hood tell it, just a big joke 
Say she a dime, yes I'm talking ten 
She on your twitter page, Facebook friends 
Say she super thick, yeah you know the chick 
But she don't look nothing like, her profile pic huuh 
  
[Hook] 
  
[E.S.G.] 
Say he sold this, say he sold that 
Boy can get an Oscar, cause he can sho' act 
Now she was super flat, and now she's super thick 
See I just pick the real, don't care who ya with 
Said he was moving bricks, said he was moving pounds 
He ain't got a car, now how he get around 
See you could keep it real, and we could still be partnas 
I graduated from the trill, Magnum-Cum-Lade 
Land of the trill, see I know ery'body 
This my building homie, you just in the lobby 
Being real my hobby, 3-65 
Everyday Street Gangsta, 3-65 
  
[Hook] 
Said he had a Lac, and a trap house 
Can't believe everything, these boys rap about 
Said she keep it Gucci, new Vuitton and Louis 
Everytime I see her, she in that old Gucci 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
  
[E.S.G.] 
Booshie rats I'm tired of that, haters man I'm tired of that 
Lying bout racks and lying bout stacks, man I'm sick and tired of that 
Dusty feet I'm tired of that, fake Gucci bag I'm tired of that 
Still hating on the South better close your mouth, this the year I'm flying back 
  
[Hook] 
Now every chick, trying to claim that she better 
And every young nigga, claim he got swagger 
But how is that, it's gotta be impossible 
Everybody ain't a rapper, every chick ain't a model uh-uh 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that 
I'm sick and tired of that, I'm sick and tired of that</pre>
