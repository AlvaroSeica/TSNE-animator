Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Not today
Just not today
Please not today

I don't really got time to stop and talk
But don't take it personal
I been up all night with my son
I'm tryn'a reach the doc before he close
I'm stressed out, upset, the lack of sleep got me emotional
And its that time of the month
just to really fuckin piss me off
I'm feelin' self-conscious
Just need me a little space
So Mr. Media, ya betta' take ya camera out my face

[Chorus]
Not today, I got things on my mind
Not today, Now ain't that the place or time
Not today, I'll do it all any other day
Just not today, please not today

I don't mind signing an autograph
But you the 99th person to ask
And all I really wanna do is break down and cry
Cause a close family friend just passed
I know you already booked the studio
But at the mo' my head can't cope
I'm aware that I made a commitment
But I never knew my heart would be broke
I'm dealing with some issues
Believe me I don't mean to be rude
Only human, forgive me, if you sense a little attitude

[Repeat Chorus]

Now let me get one thing clear
I know its ya'll that keep my here
And I'm grateful like you could never know
More thankful than I could ever show
But if, you could sympathize from just a second
I reckon you could understand where I'm coming from
Sometimes when I'm steppin' out my house
I aint steppin' out as Dynamite
I'm stepping out as Mum
Tryna' spend some quality time with my son. Whew!
If you could understand
This weren't the way I planned, its gotten out of hand
Sometimes I feel I don't even know when I am
Since I picked up the mic, my private life don't exist
Love my job, but I never know I was signing up for this
Dealing with makeup's and breakups gotta smile and be strong
Clearing with heartache and heartbreak, but the show must go on

[Repeat Chorus Twice]</pre>
