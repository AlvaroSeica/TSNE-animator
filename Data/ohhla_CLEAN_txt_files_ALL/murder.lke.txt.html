[Justin Timberlake]
Uh, yeah, hey
Walking 'round middle of the night
might end a man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck
killin everything next - it's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, somethin might go down
Good, I really wanna take this
under the ground, under the ground
And I will be down to go to that level
Uhh, and even when you speak regular or sick freak
Girl, I say okay
So come on and lead me
cause the deeper you take me the better, better
You're killin me softly
But we can go as hard as you want 'til the bed's way
under the ground, under the ground
I will be down to go to that level

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Oooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down!
Oooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down!
Under the lights and sound everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch her get down, watch her get down
Watch her get down, watch her get down - murder

[Justin Timberlake]
You're dancing 'round, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all of that below your waist
Girl you know the next scene is murder, murder
Maybe you need to watch out, somethin might go down
Girl your body's gonna end up
under the ground, under the ground
I will be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular or freak chique
Girl you compliment my taste
So girl don't be stingy
The more that you give me the better, better
You know you're killin me softly
But we can go as hard as you want 'til the bed's way
under the ground, under the ground
I will be down to go to that level

[Chorus]

[Jay Z]
Bloody murder murder murder murder, yeah

Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Uh, know that shit gotta be lethal
Uh, if that pussy broke up The Beatles
Uhh, chocha ruined pop culture
All them playa days is over
Got me buyin Rovers, rings
Jumpin over, brooms in, church rooms
Kaboom's that bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red Bottoms, white sheets
That's murder, she a beast
Uh, faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide, I'm tryin to cut
White chalk, line 'em up
Give new meanin to "dyin to fuck"
She's

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
