[Big B]
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me who's the greatest muh'fucker of 'em all, hey
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me who's the greatest muh'fucker of 'em all
 
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone] + (Big B)
Everywhere I go, everybody know
Cause it's around and around we go
Everywhere I go, everybody know
And it's around and around we go (around, and around, we go)
Everywhere I go, everybody know
And it's around and around we go (around and around)
Everywhere I go, everybody know
And it's around and around we go (around, and around, we go)
 
[Bizzy Bone]
I wanna see your body, I wanna see it baby
Let's get it crackin mami, you gotta take your time with Bizzy
Seen it in yo' eyes how you want me
My baby Beyoncé was sweatin on stage, the vision still haunts me
Need to let me wipe that off, where your Jigga at?
Find me in the hood, where my niggaz at (excuse me miss)
Shit, I can hit it better - hold up
Don't get mad Jigga, you did it to Nas' baby moms, 'member?
What goes around comes around, cause I believe in karma
Let me wifey that and you can have my baby momma
Puffy my man, you know what it is, you know what it was
You know what you did, just because
It's Bizzy the Kid, original hip-hop thug
I heard that Mya was on fire now she's all grown up
Ol' Halle Barry, I asked you to marry me and you passed
You don't remember me from first class
and this is the way I'ma hit it from the back
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bizzy Bone]
Readin the Ebony and Toni Braxton, you gon' make me stalk you girl
Bizzy go to jail and you just up and change your whole world
You finally got someone to love you, complimentin yo' style
When y'all got married I was in my cell, goin wild
Rippin the posters off the wall, I had to be detained
Shoulda been happy for you but baby I'm slightly insane
I hope you still got that thang that I gave you
And if you ever needed a friend I put on my cape and come save you
Please believe; momma I wanna sing, I know I can do it
It ain't a thing - been married to music since I was 13
My baby mama tried to kill me fo' sho
And I ain't wit my baby momma no mo'
Remember Peanuts like a secret society, better be quite Dee, I won't tell
My lesbian sisters, all is well
And you don't never need another woman's man
That's why, you need a thug like Bizzy the Kid
and this the way that I'ma pay you back
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bizzy Bone]
I wanna see you baby, sometime
Don't practice let it go, I'm even willin to grind, grind
Gotta get you happy for your man, ohh
But if you don't care, and I don't care, let the good times roll
And I ain't scared to get physical up in this mother whoo
Better shut my mouth, same ol' knucklehead from the gutter
Never leave the strap at the house, sucka
Remember the Bone Bone Bone Bone? Ask Monica, baby is butter
But she was with her homies, I don't be rappin actin phony
This is all real, all trill, no bologna
I been diggin on Mariah since back at the days of Sony
I been checkin on babies and she gave the candy out to Kobe
Holy Obie Trice, I'm livin a dangerous life
I need to quit stalkin these women, I wanna hit 'em like Wesley Pipes
And ever since Wesley Snipes stabbed Chris, I been feelin this way
about Beyoncé, every broad that I name, hey!
