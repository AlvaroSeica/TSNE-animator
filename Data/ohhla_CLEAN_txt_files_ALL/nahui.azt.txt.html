Five trillion worlds
Of war paint adorns my face
Like twilight dancing with the stars in deep space
People once celebrated my name and my grace
While now most consider me insane
Yet still I am life's surrealistic planes
I am fire, stone, air, water, and the womb
I am the stars, the sun, the earth, the mother, the egg, the sperm
and the moon
I am Chaos!!!! And I am harmony
Two sides of one balance, none the less
Where you live most people call me insane
Yet their fright laughs when you say its their ways that are to blame
But that laugh is a laugh that fills them with false righteousness
A laugh that to me sounds like wickedness seeping from the face of a blind
existence
Ignorance accepted as fact!
True righteousness victimized!
Where you live most people are shells
Filled with insanity!
And the shame
But the shame
Is that they refuse to realize
That
I am the love, I am the love, I am the love, I am the love, I am the love
I am the love
That gives the seed of life!
I am life and everything related
I am the red road! I am the black road!
I am the crossroads
I am the crossroads
I am the crossroads
I am the crossroads
Between!
And I am you!!</pre>
