[Intro: Free Murda]
Check, one-two, ya'll
Yeah, Fort Green, uh-huh, check
RZA Rah, beat, uh-huh
Rest In Peace Dirt McGirt, yea
Uh-huh, Wu... yeah... turn my mic up
Brooklyn, stand up, yeah, check

[Free Murda]
Nigga apoligizing when I creep through lanes
Paralyzing, have 'em numbing in some lethal 'caine
Leave holes the size of P clothes, man, in your pete coat lane
In the streets, they call me 'free cocaine'
Niggas say he got the magnum, never see those things
Niggas say he got platinum, only see gold chains
Clapping in between those frames, nerve ass nigga
Throw 'em right under the wing, bird ass nigga
Only time you get dap, is when you mob deep
Only time ya'll niggas is strapped, is to the car seat
Pap-pap, through the back, go through ya heart beat
Now you niggas gettin' toe-tagged, chalk on the concrete

[Chorus 2X: Free Murda]
Yeah, make you sit there, in that wheelchair
My niggas don't care, please don't stare
I know you won't dare, to do a thing like that
Get that shit clear; yeah, nigga, yeah

[Free Murda]
Disrespect a stick-up, I melt they hair
Have they head lit-up like the bottom of L.A. Gears
You shouldn't get that Pele hair, your heart racing
I could look at them, and tell they scared, they start shaking
I could smell they fear, they arms stinking
When they put they hand in the air, they palms facing
Right towards me, with my heat like this
Sideways to his head, make him leak like a piss
Coming sideways, you dead, on your cheek you'll get kissed
And that's cold, you can even bet ya heat on this
Mami told me not to beat on chicks, now it's hard to touch these hoe ass niggas
Without police in my biz

[Chorus 2X]

[Free Murda]
Niggas need to knock it off, 'fore I let the object off
Right on the project courts, glock in a Roc valor
Like a cork I pop it off, judge wanna see us in jail
So they knocked Cochran off, point a finger, chop it off
Even though I'm hot and all, still let the rocket off
Whole team is soft, like a big bag of cotton balls
I shoot accurate, shells speed racing for these faggots
That's backwards, and don't know who they facing
Keep getting slitted, make that hard face better
When I give you more stitches than that Scarface leather
My dick get kisses, cuz the God make cheddar
Blow my shit like wishes, I want long face Heather

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
