Typed by: AZ Lyrics

That's What I Do
Yeah
Uh
Feelin kinda famous, yeah
That's What I Do

[Verse 1: Classified]
I'm feelin kinda famous in my hometown
People hold me up, cause I hold em down
I never moved away from my family
And got the same friends as in elementary
You know the name in the style
But don't know what I have
Cause in my circle of friends,
The one imposted and brag
Ended up in secure
A list of what others had
Glad I got raised a little different by my mother and dad
You know what I mean?
I was a skater and a jock
Oh we showing off
My rolemodels were Wayne Gretzky and Tony Hawk
A C-student, I was average and best
Till I found hip hop and put my attidude to check
Then I found my identity, stopped caring about what anybody said to me
Alot of people make music to make you go forget about life
I make mine to hopefuly help, you won't deal with the right
That's what I do!

[Chorus]
How many times I got to tell ya
I'm doin' this with or without cha
I went through all of it and back again
That's what I do, no need to ask again

[Verse 2]
And I ain't playing about the books, I don't know how
I write my own story as it goes down
And you can either love me or hate me
No one cares about the ones who play it safely
Even my manager partys more than I do
I usually leave the party by 2
Go get high and hit the dry through
I feeling kinda old for the shit
But the kid inside of me don't know when to quit
Huh, I bring the weed to the party cause of courteous
I started burnin' it, cause I was curious
Now marihuana is my reality
But never touch a harder stuff cause my addict to personality
I know my limits, what I can and what I can't do
I understand myself so why don't underhear my health
I share determination and true grid face it
Don't follow any bad places
That's what I do!

[Chorus]
How many times I got to tell ya
I'm doin' this with or without cha
I went through all of it and back again
That's what I do, no need to ask again

[Verse 2]
Yeah and it's true
I think about this music every day and night
I'm just passionate about the way I write
But every now and then I need to take a break from this
Cause I can't even raise my kid or take a shit without attempted to create a hit
My lifestyle ain't change it's 90
And I'm, still at the liquorstore gettin' ID
With the same crew
Jay brew IV [?]
It might be as losin' touch
Highly unlikely
Ask the wrong person, I'm I has, been and done with
Ask the right person, I'm a legend to run shit
You either gonna love this or dumb this
But all I can do is keep it 100
That's what I did!

[Chorus]
How many times I got to tell ya
I'm doin' this with or without cha
I went through all of it and back again
That's what I do, no need to ask again</pre>
