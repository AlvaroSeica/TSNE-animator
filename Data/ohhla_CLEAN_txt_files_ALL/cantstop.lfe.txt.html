[Intro: Streetlife]
Yeah, yo, yeah, yo, yea

[Hook: Streetlife]
I can't stop, won't stop, don't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, won't stop, don't stop, get it, get it
I can't stop, won't stop, don't stop, get it, get it

[Streetlife]
We niggaz with attitudes, don't approach us
Or the guns will start coming out the hosters
Who wanna bang bang? Do you really, really?
I smoke niggaz like blunts, mixed with illy-illy
I'm down for whatever, whenever, who wit it
Niggaz want mine? Come get it
I send you to your maker, take me to your leader
All non believers, get slapped with the heater
I'm straight thuggin' it, gotta say I'm lovin' it
Got my middle finger up, at the government
I want it all, the fame, the fortune
I'm trynna get it, before I'm dead in a coffin
The drama thickens, my baby momma's bitchin'
I can't complain cuz nobody's listening
So feel my pain, I'm hurtin' the same
Faggot niggaz kickin' dirt on my name, I'm Streetlife

[Chorus 2X: Streetlife]
Aiyo, they don't call me Street for nothing
You know, you can lose your life for fronting
Oh no, Staten Island niggaz is coming
It's like whoa, young'n, let me show you something

[Streetlife]
Yeah, we down for the cause, we all outlaws
When we kick down the door, everybody hit the floor
When we bust off a shot, drop it like it's hot
Uh-huh, nobody move, nobody get popped
I'm holding you hostage, you, rap impostors
All you fake gangstas, and wanna be mobsters
All you stank bitches, that suck dick and gossip
Keep my name out your mouth, hands out my pocket
Uh-huh, I'm certified street, check my credentials
Quick to snuff a nigga, fuck up his dentals
Uh-huh, a little mental, my screws is loose
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, with the missing tooth
Uh-huh, don't count me out, deal me in
I got hang time, I play 'above the rim'
You ride the pine, watch mine move from the sideline
I don't need the lime light, nigga, I got shine

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
