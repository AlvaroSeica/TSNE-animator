On the phone talkin money while I bend the curb
Bendin rules so I'm hurtin feelings like I pinched a nerve
In my city niggas think I blew up like the Hindenburg
So I let em believe it I can think of plenty worse
Hop out, throw a dollar to a homeless man
He said âSpare a little more young brotha I know you canâ
Wish I could share more paper but I'm one
Check away from bein ya next door neighbor
He said âPor Favorâ in Ingles
Then he said âI ain't gon spend it on no E&amp;Jâ
I said that's good to know these days
So I gave hin 25 cents and said âKeep the changeâ

As ride through the city lights
Got my mind on gettin by
That's the way I gotta move
Everyday every night
(repeat)

On the phone talkin money while I bend the curb
Engine pur beatin down ya block like Leonard/Hearns
Rehabilitated like I left a prison sentence served
Bout my business, Stern like commissioners
Gettin to the paper mane, Rakim in â88
Paid In Full favorite statement fish is my favorite plate
Yea I do this on the day to day
Killin beats Cain and Abel listen to the 808s

They talk loud, but we got then silencers
Burner after burner they be pilin up
And another one you can line em up
You see just how we workin
They talk loud, but we got then silencers
Burner after burner they be pilin up
And another one you can line em up
You know we always servin

Big bills Mr. Russell
I need em in my wallet &amp; much more than a couple
This isn't just a hobby but far more than a hustle so I'm
Workin til I'm restin with my aunties &amp; my uncles
Heavenly, since 17 it's been this rappin thing
Hip-hop was my Coretta King yea I had a dream
Manifested fruition
Everyday I'm in the kitchen cookin up some nutrition
Amen I need that daily bread
Motive stay motivated pray before I lay in bed
New year new moves you doin the stanky leg
Still on that same old I'm fresher than some baby's breath
In a bouquet on a weddin day
Married to the money never throw it when I celebrate
I need every penny, so whatever I'm spendin
Better come back twofold do a 720</pre>
