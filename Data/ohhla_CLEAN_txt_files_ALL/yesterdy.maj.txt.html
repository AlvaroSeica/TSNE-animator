[Intro: Carlos Bess]
They would each take seats, in King Bottom Rocking Chairs
And they would begin rocking, back and forth
When they all got going, it was like so many metronomes
Just rocking... in time, turns and could be about as dust
As speaking into early evening
Lightning bolts flicker and out of all
Supervise just beyond the porch
And they would talk each evening
Unless there was some local gossip to superced it temporary
They would talk about this self same thing...
It was a long narrative history of a family

[Madam Majestic]
Yesterday... days I knew as happy sweet...
Said yesterdays... older days...
Golden days... days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine, then truth was mine
Joy is free and flaming life, soup was mines
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of, yesterday

[Interlude: Carlos Bess]
By warmest, earliest memories
Bits and pieces and patches
Which were told together, kind of in a mix
Of marginized way, about my warmest earliest memories

[Madam Majestic]
Yesterday... days I knew as happy sweet...
Said yesterdays... older days...
Golden days... days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine, then truth was mine
Joy is free and flaming life, soup was mines
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of, yesterday
Yesterday... Yesterday...
Yesterday... free and flaming life...
Glad am I... sad am I... </pre>
