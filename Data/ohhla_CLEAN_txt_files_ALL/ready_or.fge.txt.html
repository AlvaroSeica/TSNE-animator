Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you, and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you, and make you want me

[Verse One: Wyclef]
Now that I escape sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jailbars ain't Golden Gates, those who fake they break
when they meet they four hundred pound mate
If I could rule the world (if I ruled the world)
everyone would have a gun, in the ghetto of course
when giddyupin on they horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin moonshine
I poor a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin 'bout the robbe-RY that I did last WEEK
Money in the bag, banker look like a drag
I wanna play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinch my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest no stress if you don't smoke sess
'less, I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make tracks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgie and Bess
capture your bounty like Elliot Ness YES!
Bless you if you represent the Fu
but I hex you, with some witches brew if you doo-doo
Voodoo, I could what you do, EASY!
Believe me! Frontin niggaz give me heebie-jeebies
So while you imitatin Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone, and defacatin on your microphone

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these styles I got 
Oh baby, hey baby cause I got a lot, oh yeahhh
Anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know 
Oh baby, hey baby you can't hide from the block, oh noooo

[Verse Three: Pras]
Ready or not, ReFugees takin over
The Buffalo Soldier, dread like rasta
On the twelveth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover now they under pushin up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die
Toss me high only puff lye with my crew from Lacaille
I ReFugee from Guatanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay

[Chorus]</pre>
