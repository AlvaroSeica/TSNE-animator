(*talking*)
Whoa uh Killa, C-Mo yeah nigga (nigga)
This what we finna make you do mayn
Listen up one-one, two-two
Three-three nigga, breath easy
One-one, two-two, three-three nigga

[Kyleon]
Kyleon flow cold, like when you see snow
You black cats on the track, Kyleon is C4
You might see a lil' do', Kyleon see mo'
And ain't none of y'all better, than Kyleon and C-Mo
If it wasn't for this rap, I'd still run D
Who the hottest on these streets, ask my nigga Bun B
A hundred percent hit spitter, that's how they rate Kyle
Never battled at Rehab, never battled at 8 Mile
They hate Kyle cause he sick, like polio
I'm 24 and in my prime, like Kobe hoe
I'm MJ on these beats, you can't hold me hoe
I'm thoed, cause Cory Mo told me so
You might see me with Slim Thug, you might see me with Po-Yo
You might see me with Dre Day, you might see me with yo hoe
You might see me at 4-4, in Garden City
Or off of 'Stead spending do', at Bargain City
Killa finna be a superstar, as large as Diddy
In a house in a car, as large as Diddy
Talk shit, Kyleon'll stain your 'fit
And really turn you niggaz, to the Color Changin' Click
I'm a pimp, I come around and bang your chick
Day 1 Fam, my gang is thick
And I got mob ties, like Frank Sinatra
I'm the shooter, you don't have to think I shot ya</pre>
