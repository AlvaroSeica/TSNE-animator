(Demon voice)
(Flesh Flesh...) (laughs)
Tough boy you can fake like you hard
But if you ain't rollin' with the Lord
Bigga get your (bitch ass pussy)
Get your ass a hoe card bitch 

[Flesh]
Well, hit 'em with the middle ? 
creepin' sleepin' competitors nothin' but silence 
? Flesh ? I'm soft niggas afraid ? 5th Dawg ? 
book of thugs he's so raw raw motherfuck the law
Law get 'em off a your dog ya'll ya'll ? 
Ya'll niggas ain't ready for the armaggedon 
? In a daze and if you come around my way ? make my day Flesh 
Have any mercy not when he cock buckshot feel his ass drunken 
? bloodclots ? fill his ass hot slugs when he explode 
Now get 'em off poppin' gotta glock flossin' a beam 
And call off shots right in between his eye when I hit 'em 
With a Nina should've seen his split wig ? 
Never wanna fuck with my lyrical status can't touch my 
And my style you niggas in the game wanna talk foul ?
100 proof thugstyle put it down
Sure you wanna bite us now (now, uh)

Chorus: Flesh
1 9 9 9, 2 triple 0 0 0 
we be the heroes souljahs of the new millennium ?

[Afta Maff]
Runnin' with a bullet proof vest and put 'em to rest 
When I meet a motherfucker with a fifth of Cal. AK-47
Mac-11, Hollow Points trailin' the bitch 
And watch me dip with my trues I fool
Nigga know the rules, rules 

[Flesh] 
Whatever you do, you do what you gotta do
If you snooze you lose

[Afta Maff]
My niggas be strong with a bullet proof on 
I'm checkin' the niggas' claimin' to be thugs 
Thinkin' of poppin' my pistol bangin' the brains 
I'm leavin' the niggas sho' cuz I don't wanna be judged 
by a 12 than carry by 6 

[Flesh]
I'm a empty the clip and dip
For fuckin' with B, G get your wig split
Remember the silence... 

[Afta Maff]
And I'm off here with pigs
Let me get that glock cocked put 'em on the spot 
When I run around roofs with a bullet proof on but it won't save
You trues ? lovin' that Black Hole and sho' and I'm ready to roll 

[Flesh]
Gimme the cheese and weed really don't wanna play hero 

[Two Gun]
Puttin' in clips with the hollow point tips Two Gun say 
"Trip and stay ready to rip" 
Equipped with the infareds on the automatic Mac 11's 
Better step with your weapons niggas, thugs is who you be testin' 

[Flesh]
If you try then nigga you wreck it with my 
double glock glock better off leavin' them restin' 

[Afta Maff]
Stan be sayin' the missions impossible
Murder one gon' get me unstoppable you better be watchin' 
or waitin' my nigga be flippin cuz nigga we profitable 

Chorus

[Menenski]
Spittin' real with my killas
These niggas gon' hear us, gon' feel us (they gon' feel us) 
With 7th Sign and Mo! Thug; all my niggas get love and I gon' ride
My nigga Flesh pray to God with his niggas from Watts
Don't stop, won't stop

[Flesh]
It's another one of them days Stack gotta get paid
Hockin' a rage cockin' a guage aim to peel when I dump, kill
when I pump I'm a send 'em a trip to the grave
I'm gonna pop on to dump 'em on a trip to the cemetery
Fairy tales of the crypt I'm the keeper; 
Nice to meet you, busta ? niggas ? 
60 figures they got they feelin' heated up repeatedly
sweeped everybody ? every motherfucker wanna go to hell 
And I'll send 'em makin' a maulin' niggas fall to the 9
We the heroes of the new millennium
Hear me now 

Chorus

[Flesh] 
Yeah, Mo! motherfuckin' Thug soldiers
In this bitch takin' over
Like we told you
FBI, Flesh-N-Bone Incorporated
How many ya'll bitches hate it? 
Understand me motherfucker
When you see me what you gon' do
When the 5th Dog trip on you?
