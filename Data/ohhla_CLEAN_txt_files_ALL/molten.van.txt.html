[Verse 1]
Something is taking over
My brain is like a motor
Release me from these binds
Help me free my mind
Everyone's so disguised
Can't find truth in their eyes
Living this masquerade
Everyone's so afraid

[Chorus]
To die is all we got, 6 feet down our bodies rot
As our souls get released, next our carcass lays deceased
Can't get it out of my head, can't get it out of my head
Can't get it out of my head, can't get it out of my head

[Verse 2]
This is virtuality
Someone explain to me
I keep on seeing illusions
of living institutions

[Chorus repeats]
Don't wake me I'm feeling fine
I'm outta here in another time
I'm more alive even after I'm dead
Remember me with every breath
I am a holy soldier!  I am a holy soldier!
I am a holy soldier!  I am a holy soldier!</pre>
