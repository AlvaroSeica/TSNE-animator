[Mr. G]
Oh yes it's I 
The gangsta that be leavin' niggas bloody
Told ya that you can hurt
Mr. G gettin' nutty
You get hauled off
My clique'll break you off
I run with nothin' but G's
They all claim boss
You might get lost when we get hold to ya
Representin' that Wood
But don't ya know what we'll do ya
Put them bullet holes through ya
Now you havin' no future
Didn't really wanna do it
But you was beggin' me to shoot ya
I show my folks much love round my way
Cause if it's beef then I need them
Them all gon' spray
Them all got K's
Shit them all don't play
And to them ones that's fakin'
Them all gon' pay
I got these niggas lovin' this old Dirty ass shit
Plus I got them bitches rubbin' me all over my dick
Now we all gon' ride until the day we die
Fuck them other niggas cause my G's get live

[Hook]
Now we be dipped in that black
Tote my clips to the right
We gon' stay poppin' 6 from the day till the night
We gon' stay stackin' cheese cause we grind to get paid
We gon' stay representin' nigga hittin' on blades
Repeat

[Mr. G]
We got G's in the front
We got G's in the back
We got G's all around cause they down like that
We got G's in the South in the East in the West
Fuck with these and believe that you gon' be put to rest
Now don't try to test cause this shit is for real
Comin' through slangin' steel
Knockin' niggas off they heels
What the deal hoe
You know I'm out to get my cheese
Makin' you niggas bleed
Just to stay on my feet
Keep a fat sack of weed just to have my mind throwed
Rollin' with Optimo
Cheefin' till ain't no mo'
Nigga we holla fo'
Fuck with us and get smoked
Choke ya until you cold
Watch how quick you get broke
So if we collide
I puttin' out yo lights
I know that it ain't right
It's just how I feel inside
My clique thugged out
You know what we about
We spittin' game at hoes cause we straight from the South

Hook

[Mr. G]
Now all my G's known to put a nigga to sleep
All my G's bury niggas 6 feet deep
All my G's never leave they house without that heat
And all my G's know we runnin' these streets
All my G's known to put a nigga to sleep
All my G's bury niggas 6 feet deep
And all my G's never leave they house without that heat
And all my G's know we runnin' these streets

Hook

Y'all niggas just don't know
Y'all niggas don't never understand how these G's do it
Uh, but we stay dipped in that black from the day through the night
Aight
