Yeah
Story of my life

I woke up 'round 7:45 in the mornin'
Told the world "What's up"
Unh, I worked all day so you know tonight
I'ma try and find my way to the club
And get a couple drinks
Order couple rounds, rounds, rounds
You know how it go
And watch the pretty girls bootys go down, down, down
To the floor
I found one girl
She was lookin' good
She must be new
I ain't seen her in my neighborhood
I said excuse me I don't know just who you are
But if you come with me in my car
I'll make you say

Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
We can sing a little song
Every time we get it up
Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
We can sing a little song
Every time we get it up

Left out the crib 2:43
Had a couple girls waitin' for me
(Unh huh, Unh huh huh huh)
One said that my ex-girlfriend
Told her somethin' and she ready to see
Haha, Hahaha
Speedin' in my drop top with the windows down, down, down
You know know how it go
A-A-All the haters
Take a picture now, now, now
Hold up lemme pose, haha
There go another girl
Mhm, she lookin' good
She must be new
I ain't her in my neighborhood
I said excuse me I don't know just who you are
But if you let me give you CPR
I'll make you say

Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
We can sing a little song
Every time we get it up
Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
We can sing a little song
Every time we get it up

Unh, girl you make me wanna sing a little song
With cha little dress on
Shot me in my chest
I ain't have my vest on
Man down
But they got they hands up
Talkin' loud
So I took you from your friends
And we dipped off in the crowd
You said "Maejor, can you make me feel good?"
I said "Yes"
You said "How can I ever be sure"
I suggest that you leave this club with me
I know it sounds iffy
But if you just roll I can make you umm, quickly
Three one threezy
Two fourty-two
Seven seven seven five
That's my number, that's for you
You can hit me up anytime
But keep that on the low
'Cause them things we talkin' about ain't nobody gotta know
Upside down

Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
We can sing a little song
Every time we get it up
Ooh baby, ah baby like
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ah baby like
Ooh baby, ah baby like
We can sing a little song
Every time we get it up</pre>
