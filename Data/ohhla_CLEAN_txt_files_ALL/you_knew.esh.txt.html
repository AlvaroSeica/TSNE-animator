[woman singing]
[Esham]

I thought you knew,but it seems you don't
So now I gotta put you in yo place because most niggaz won't
Give you all a piece of my mind
The truth'll set you free and the truth is hard to find
Had a little hoe, she loved to wine &amp; dine
Her favorite number's 69, so is mine
In those times a nigga felt good
In the sunshine, I misunderstood
Many hoes,many hoes
I ran thru plenty hoes, plenty hoes
Call me a pimp or a mack dad
Or call me a Mr.Propalac dad
It's a toss up if my homies fell thru
See I shouldn't have to tell you
I thought you knew
[singing]

I thought you knew about the Unholy Black Devil
Dick in my hand
To let you know where I stand(stand)
I with my man with the 40 in his hand(hand)
I can't trust the cops cause they the Ku Klux Klan(Klan)
Motown, all the real niggaz know
The radio try to play me out like a hoe
Cause I won't criss cross over to the pop
Just cause I gotta little problem with the cops
Props come and the radio go
But I ain't nobody's hoe
I thought you knew

[singing]

I thought you knew about a nigga like me
I'm just into clockin cash
But some niggaz clockin me
And still don't know the time
All on my line
Just cause I'm fuckin ya woman's mind
I gotta get my roll on
I gotta get my stroll on
I gotta get 'em on
And once it's on, I'm feelin alright
I think I'ma fuck yo woman tonight
Cause I don't care
I don't give a fuck
About bushy kissin ya baby and how she sucked on my nuts
I fucked her in the butt like yesterday
I ain't got nuttin else to say
I thought you knew

[singing]
