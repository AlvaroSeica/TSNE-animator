[Havoc the Mouthpiece]
Yo Russell Simmons
This is your commander in chief of your West Coast operations
Havoc the Mouthpiece
My orders are to assemble a team
of 6 of the West Coast's dopest rappers
I have chosen Prodigy, Havoc the Rhyme Son, Spice motherfuckin 1
2Pac, Eiht from Compton's Most Wanted, and Ice-T
so let the gangsta team begin

[Havikk the Rhime Son]
Gnaw on a dick motherfucker cuz I'm a rip a gangsta skit
and blow your motherfuckin ass into anincrement
I rip 'em vertical diagonal I mean fucked up
show that ass and I'm a physically tear it up
another G witha glock givin a fuck about a cop
I do my talkin with a 12-gauge buckshot
like Spice 1 I'm just a giggity-giggity gangsta
and keepin a motherfuckin slug up in the chamber
+I Don't Give a Fuck+ like 2Pac
I get a fuckin thrill when I see a cop drop
Squeeze yo motherfuckin neck and snatch your head off your shoulders
Peel ya cap read your brain like the devil boy I told ya
Make a move for your gat and I'ma split your fuckin back
6 ways with a mack Havoc's in a mood to put a dick in the dirt
Jeffrey Dahmer gets no love cuz I'm the murder 1 expert
You couldn't deal with the real shit so you got ass whipped
Fuckin with a lunatic bitch West Coast on a wreck
So motherfuck the mainstream you tuned in to the gangsta team

[Prodeje]
I broke it down for the gangsta flex
snappin necks as I wreck from the gangsta teks
You gets no love you get a 9 in your asshole
droppin it in the back the fuckin niggas with a damn pole
and that nigga Prod he's a gangsta I know the game bro
And I could be a fuckin murderer the hot shells melt yo ass G
And the Tales From the Crypt grabs yo ass like a movie
You got fucked up nigga when you fucked up
The brain splat on the floor like some damn nuts
West Coast they hoo-ride on your ass if you fast
you will still get mortified members only motherfuck the phony
I give your ass the blues like Tony Toni Tone
Regulate in the 9-tre nigga this is payday
Comin from the mists with an A-K
O.G. stand no G. nigga from the S.C.
with a glock in my hood it don't stop til a nigga drop
I don't drop but I bust hot slugs from a drop top

[Havoc the Mouthpiece]
Yeah Rhyme Son and Prodeje
That's the way to show motherfuckers
how the gangsta team is runnin shit
Now it's time for the rest of you motherfuckin gangstas
to show 'em how we livin

[2Pac]
