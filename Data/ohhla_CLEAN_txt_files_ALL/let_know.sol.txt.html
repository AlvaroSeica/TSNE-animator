[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Ok, fucka, whatever you wanna say, B.
Killa Mob, nigga, uh, yeah, let's get it now, nigga
Uh, uh, time is now, Staten Island nigga
Heroin nigga, you see me, nigga, you see me
I'm that nigga, you know it

[Solomon Childs]
I have 'em slither like centipedes
The kids'll find you dead in the weeds
Only tote jungle trees, sponsor, I lead big leagues
Mail ya momma hands to you
Fuck a whip, I want a space shuttle
Diamond stones around the nose of my pitbulls muzzles
Move, pitch, double time
I'm that Don Cheedle'ly grind
Kill 'em if they cross the line
We project kids'll glistlen
And so what, we hard headed and don't listen
We on a life or death mission
Besides, niggas want boats and planes
Diamonds and Cuban chains
And you can hate til you turn blue
The jackal, and niggas ain't doing it right
So I'm taking over the Rotten Apple

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Let 'em know (New York), let 'em know (Chi-Town)
Let 'em know (L.A.), let it blow (M.I.A.)
You already know (Texas) It ain't where you from
It's where you at...
Throw 'em up (blood up) throw 'em up (crip up)
Throw 'em up (put 'em up) Let 'em know (brrrat)
You already know, it ain't where you from
It's where you at...

[Solomon Childs]
Nigga prayed I wouldn't make it here, but I made it
Now I'mma burn like the electric chair
It's real live extortion here, so fair it's fair
And it's crunchtime, who wanna slam dance?
Homey, change me, the hammers enhance me
I'm up on my anties, these muthafuckas is panties
Al Qaeda, the criminal assassin
It's that New York passion, attracting your baby moms
And niggas can't swing at what's coming
Cuz they ain't got no arms and I'm like whatever, God
Slaughter the dead, perish, let the bullets move in with grits to the left
Blow the audobon in the recliner, gutless
Serve you niggas, surrounded by a bunch of bird niggas
You don't know nothing about a struggle, nigga

[Chorus]

[Outro: Sha Blood]
Let me tell you niggas something right now, man, this is Blazzy
Yo, you know I don't like none of you niggas, man
None of you niggas, man...</pre>
