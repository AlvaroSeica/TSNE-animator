[Popa Wu]
Yeah YÂ’all
Yeah
Buddhism, is thirty five thousand years old
Buddha, the twenty-fourth scientist, manifest through his supreme wisdom
His culture
What brought forth the equalities of his Buddhism
With a knowledge that he manifested, was through his own reality
And had to be cast out, cause it was so real
He brought forth his own reality, a' how he was going to win this won
Because in reality, the warrior always lives through death
There's no death in man
At the beginning of time, man came to existence of himself
All it was is life
Cause from life, brings life
Buddha bless me
Buddha seen an everlasting life, of his own reality
How he gonna master his own universe
The sparks and friction of the Buddha Monk
Was conquering in destroying the death
Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me
The reality, the reality, the science of the sparks and friction's
Well the spark was the knowledge in his mind
And through his wisdom, they all realize
Understanding told him to see through his third eye
By being G-O-D, he's seen his reality
Arm leg leg arm head, Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me
Can I see? I can the forest from the trees
And it brought forth my reality
Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me
Yeah let me give you a little Jew
We have all agreed as the Sun of Man there is only one God
And we wasn't losing no time, searching for that, that does not exist
We knowledge the cipher that we existed in
And brought forth are own reality
So now we understand the cipher, and what and how it was made
In the beginning, God said let there be man
And let the man bring forth light
Through his wisdom, he manifest his own cipher
To be in the sad person of that ability
That the civilized is held responsible for the uncivilized
And must be punished by the old mighty Buddha Monk
Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me
So I took it into psalms eighty-two
Chapters sixth, seventh and eighth
It says he Buddha, is the God of the most highest
Rise and take your place
And show the using and in hurting the universe
Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me

[Buddha Monk]
Open your eyes, have knowledge to bring forth the truth
And the truth is life {*laughing*}
