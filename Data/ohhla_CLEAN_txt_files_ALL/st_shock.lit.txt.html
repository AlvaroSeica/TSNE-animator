I hear the game 'bout to switch gears
how that be? It's been riding stuck in fifth gear since two O three
see me
I'm happier popping in an old school track
and get me a lesson not some children bringing old school back
don't want to go through that
so
I'm straight
I'll wait
I'd rather find a pair of my daddy's socks
and rub my ankles 'gainst each other for a static shock
or maybe take it to the future let me grab a clock...

You know what time it is? Like this here
let's play a game of get like me
cause I'm feeling like I got this period on lock
and ain't fearing no imposter with no ID
thinking that they're Pac or the B.I.G.
and they really need to stop cause they just might see
and I don't think that any of them meant for us to emulate or mimic them
apparently
it's probably me
and I mean gee
I wouldn't want nobody in the following generation on the same stuff I did
that would stop the circle and defeat the purpose entirely
with a proper invitation to some music that's timeless
a mind full of dungeons and dragons'
here to floss like a monster that brush with a tractor
what's lately cracking? Ya'll mind
I'm nosy with my neck up in your business like a brontosaurus...

What ya'll doing
man? What that be? Why ya'll hiding all the good music?
Where that be? See me
I'm happier popping in an old school track
and get me a lesson not some children bringing old school back
don't want to go through that
so
I'm straight
I'll wait
I'd rather find a pair of my daddy's socks
and rub my ankles 'gainst each other for a static shock
or maybe take it to the future let me grab a clock...

Is there a light in here? No? I'm not scared
I just hardly even see my feet
and I'm ready to put the stomp on enemies
and it won't mean anything if I can't see their teeth
duh
some got the grills with the diamonds
yup
and that'll make it easier to find them
yup
that'll make me Indiana Jones
it's on
now I ain't the type or kind to crash a party
but since my music is as funky as a fart from a rooster
I'ma laxitate my stomach and put the party with poop
continue laughing when it's plain to see it's going to be true
and ain't a parking lot filled with U-hauls that could move me
I feel like a cancer patient of the clinic with the cure but got no cash to pay them
what's cracking and lating
ya'll mind
I'm nosy with my neck up in your business like a brontosaurus...

What ya'll doing
man? What that be? Why ya'll hiding all the good music? Where that be? See me
I'm happier popping in an old school track
and get me a lesson not some children bringing old school back
don't want to go through that
so
I'm straight
I'll wait
I'd rather find a pair of my daddy's socks
and rub my ankles 'gainst each other for a static shock
or maybe take it to the future let me grab a clock...

You know what time it is? Right this year
I'ma make the game revolve around me
and I bet I put a stop to the snapping
and it's not really happening cause everybody's on the same beat
the same little step and the same little snap
I ain't no professor
but that ain't rap
is it? I was living under rocks and probably born yesterday
it's stupid to say it's stupid
shawty
I don't know what else to say: Oh well
I'm gelling
you gelling
a fee fie foe fum
then I found a felon when Peter piper got plucked picking pickled peppers
and Susie sold sinning by the shore and called it Sea Shells. Oh well
I tell ya'
if rapping was a death row inmate
I'd bail her
gain attention when you try to ignore me
but my necks still in your business like a brontosaurus...
