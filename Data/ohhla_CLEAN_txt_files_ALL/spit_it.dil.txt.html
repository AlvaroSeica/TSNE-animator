[Evidence]
Move, we don't lose, second place ain't my groove
Play to win even if I played the fool
How could I break 'em, I made the rules
Got tools, big fish, never swam in schools
Eye to hand coordination is on, never lose my cool
If you got beat down you didn't sue
That's the era I was from, it was double or none
Whether New York nights or days in Cali sun
I'm the best when it comes down to weather and them
Troublesome and the blaze go out 'til it's done
Co-signed by Alchemist, stamped by Babu
Executive Produced, yours truely, got loot
It's a new day, phones still tapped, watchin' the crew
They put out one of my joints and I still got two
steps ahead, don't sleep just rest my head
Bless the dead, 'til the day we meet I'm through

[Chorus]
{"Y'all hear me?"}, {"I spit it clearly"}
{"Time is money, got no time to waste minutes"}
This ain't play time, we don't waste time
{"Time is money"}

[Iriscience]
My style's like crackhouse and how I hit on the street
But kinda like Trackhouse and how I live on the beat
I'm a Mid City miracle, moms glad I made it out
them knuckleheaded streets to Jamaica out with David house
For the shock is forever shootin'
Strictly self defensin' for revolution
I know the temptation of retribution
And that circle of death's not the solution
But I got insurance, I can see another day
Don't make me pull the policy and put the love away
It's the R-A-K to the double-A
I hate a bitin' MC like I love L.A.  
They be activated, can't tell proof on how my mouth was runnin'
Then they heard the solo album's comin'
"Duck Seazon 3" locked on, Weatherman watch storms
Cali King Rakaa with a crown but it got thorns

[Chorus]
{"Y'all hear me?"}, {"I spit it clearly"}
{"Time is money, got no time to waste minutes"}
This ain't play time, we don't waste time
{"Time is money"}

[Alchemist]
I hear nothin', see nothin', feel nothin'
Still hungry, ribs is still touchin'
my chest, yes my blood is still rushin'
I'm near nothin', no one, I fear nothin'
I keep bustin', who bluffin', we stuff 'em
to the dirt, then roll up the earth then keep puffin'
Keep rollin', hold it down and keep holdin'
position, fold up the grip then keep foldin'
Stay clickin', pen grippin', page flippin'
On stage kickin', nothin' but the straight business
(Business) Comin' out my face with it
Time is money, got no time to waste minutes
But still I sharpen these bars and stay fitted
Post up, stay on my pivot, I handle my business
Calculate, stay on my digits
Stick and move, I don't lay with them bitches

[Chorus]
{"Y'all hear me?"}
{"I spit it clearly"}
{"Y'all hear me?"}
{"I spit it clearly"}
{"Y'all hear me?"}
{"I spit it clearly"}
