[Intro: repeat 2X]
Shattered dreams, feel like I could run away
Nothing but shattered dreams

[Verse One]
Damn~! Poor me, pour me a shot of Patron
Cigarillo or bordello I just gotta be blown
In a silicone zone where, titties are grown
In sessions of the recession where, 50's are thrown
Rose pedals, pedal within cities of stone
Reefer and liquor dance, my chemical romance
My pitiful cold hands, that ache to be warm
Like a tux with gold cuffs that, waits to be worn
Nowadays, love's in the haze of a flashback
Those who invest deeply need be gettin they cash back
Bein in lust with love, feels so dreamy
'til they shattered in beautiful pieces scattered beneath me
I still chase it, you gotta believe me
I just don't think it's as instant as an instance on TV
We try to close the distance but persistence ain't easy
There's a ribbon in the sky, if you listen to Stevie
Problem is - my arms can't reach that far
or stretch that high, is it best I fly?
With the wings of a Goose mixed with Red Bull
And a nightcap slapped on to keep my head cool
Awakened in a state of confusion
Dressin quickly to get back to my city, fuckin delusion
Where I live, where I stay, where I sleep, where I lay

[Interlude]
I've seen all the things that pass me by
Oh why can't it be real?
I cling to my dreams as I grab the sky
Oh why can't it be real?

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Shattered dreams, feel like I could run away
Nothing but shattered dreams</pre>
