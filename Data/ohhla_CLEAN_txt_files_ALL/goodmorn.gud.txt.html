Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I swag on em, let my nuts sag on em
Open up a motherfucking can of woop ass on em
The bitches that you stalkin Â– I pass on em
I dive in a pool then I splash on em
I don't smash it, I wreck it then I crash on it
Get the pussy donated, you can spend the cash on er
Take a lame nigga face and tap dance on it
Rest in peace tease with your fake ass on it
Money talks and you ain't speaking no English
The fire that I'm spitting is something you can't extinguish
Your girl is a fiend, she clinging, swing on the penis
Boy I'm space age pimpin, my flight landin from Venus uh

[Chorus: x2]
Let me get me, yea it's time
Draggin, flame spittin every time I rhyme
Good morning, watch how yo boy rise and shine
While you watchin what I do, I'm doing me, getting my bitch

[Verse 2]
Southern flame spitter, like sure dawg
Bring the champagne now pop the coke off
Rich nigga but I still buy sports cars
SS Camaro, top cut like a sports bro
Crazy flow, but you still find no floors
No ceilings bumping, your girl no draws
I'm on the takin wins, no L's, no draws
Always shit, one plus, four stars
Living like a outlaw - no rules, no laws
It wreck rhymes when I flow 'cause I go hard
Fuck networking, I'm a Bogart
They ain't see my vision, now it's time to show y'all

[Chorus: x2]
Let me get me, yea it's time
Draggin, flame spittin every time I rhyme
Good morning, watch how yo boy rise and shine
While you watchin what I do, I'm doing me, getting my bitch

[Verse 3]
I'm a murder them, I'm a murder them
All black suit and a hearse for them
Call up the pastor, get a church for them
I'm a beast boy, welcome to the lion's den
You say that you was a ride, you's a goddamn liar
Shotgun bullets, for the shotgun rider
Passenger soaked up, you never should provoke us
'Cause all my niggas riders, riding like a tow bus
I've been rapping in the game for some years now
It's bout time for me to punish all my pears now
I've been sitting on the side just analyzing
Now it's time to snap necks, I'm a paralyze em

[Chorus: x2]
Let me get me, yea it's time
Draggin, flame spittin every time I rhyme
Good morning, watch how yo boy rise and shine
While you watchin what I do, I'm doing me, getting my bitch

[Outro]
Yea, Gudda Gudda bitch
Yea, Gudda Gudda bitch
Oh, yea
Hot here, it's good
Watch yo boy rise and shine bitch
We gon kill em
Yea, good morning
Yea, good morning
Yea, good morning
Watch yo boy rise and shine bitch</pre>
