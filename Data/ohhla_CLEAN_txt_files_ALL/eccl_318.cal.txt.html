Typed by: CORPORATERECORDLABEL

My money angel has been realized
and is preparing a table before me in the midst of my enemies
no one can stop me know, ha ha ha ha ha...

For everything there is a season
and a time for every matter under heaven
A time to be born, and a time to die
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted
A time to kill, and a time to heal
a time to break down, and a time to build up
A time to weep, and a time to laugh
a time to mourn, and a time to dance
A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing
A time to seek, and a time to lose
a time to keep, and a time to throw away
A time to tear, and a time to sew
a time to keep silence, and a time to speak
A time to love, and a time to hate
a time for war, and a time for peace
Hey yo Calvin Crabtree
We Tradinh Love And War Stories homey, LETS GET IT
