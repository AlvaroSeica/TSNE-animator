[Hodgy Beats]
Keep smokin
Keep smokin

Bring something new to the table
And I don't want yams because I had some yesterday
But I can smoke grams blaze one almost everyday
And I will shake hands and make plans with a featherweight
+Wolf Gang+ clan sold out when we set a date
Klux Klan burn the stage down let it marinate
Correlate circulate percolate
A work of fate it hurts to hate
For me there's no surrogate
Bring some fuckin food to the table
And if you get cheese make it provolone or parmesan
Rollin Mary Jane, kill this pain in my other arm
Holdin on a dame and her maid in my other arm
Such a charm, so it's on, smoke til it's gone
Feel withdrawn, these bitches blown
They better call Tyrone, about where upon
She's at and um, sit on a bus stop like she do salons
Or bag a bitch for me like she fuckin works at Vons

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It's the M, the E, the L
The L, the O, double-U
H, the Y, the P, the P, the E
It's the M, the E, the L
The L, the O, double-U
H, the Y, the P, get your money

[Left Brain]
Never been a buster nigga
I ride with them thuggish niggaz
MellowHigh, Loiter Squad
I ride with them ruggish niggaz
Never fuck a bitch up in the bucket
She just suck a nigga
Eighty-one, box Chevy
Dirty seats, dirty Sprite
Ridin dirty through the night
Shinin like some pearly whites
Lurkin for the po'-po' though
Fuck them punks, exit out the way
I'ma hit the "Shake Junt"
Hit my nigga G we gon' smoke eight joints
Kill the bottle, full throttle
Bad bitch still fuck with me I still fuck with y'all
But we ain't fuckin for free
All my Wolves, we eat feet, said we all flossy
We boss hogs ain't all talk
Sawed off y'all small talk
Big noise, big toys
Monster truck, dumpster truck
Fuck the slut, then dump and smut
+Trash Wang+, that's what's up {*5X*}

[Chorus] - repeat 2X chopped up as it progresses</pre>
