[Intro]
New York, Put it on the flo'
New York, Put it on the flo'. (What!) (C'mon)
Cali, Put it on the flo'
Cali, Put it on the flo'
Miami, Put it on the flo'
Miami, Put it on the flo'
Atlanta, Put it on the flo'
Atlanta, Put it on the flo'

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
One time, the women start sniffin around
when we be rippin' it down, we got 'em stickin' around
The way they love to feel like I'm the king of the town
The way my money stack steep and got 'em flippin' around
And got 'em makin' a sound
Ayo, you looking delicious. Baby girl, I only use my dough for coochie or chicken
Listen, cooked food. Shorty fatten my tummy
You can go in and have my slice, don't touch my money
Even though you looking good and it was nice to meet ya
you be lucky if you even get a slice of pizza from me
Before you ever try to touch my money clip
I'll put you on the corner walking up and down the money strip
Now looka here, honey dip betta find another dummy quick
Homie tryna stunt, betta jump inside a money whip
I see where you can get and keep it over there
you betta try your luck cause you ain't getting nothing over here

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I think you need to move it to the left (Shorty)
Move it to the left (Shorty)
If you ain't got your own paper, I don't suggest you hold your breath (Shorty)
Keep it right (Shorty)
You betta keep it tight (Shorty)
You betta bring money out ya crib, cause you ain't getting none of mine, tonight (Shorty)

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Ma, let me see you twist it like a centipede
I keep a sack of that, plus some Hennessey
Since I got rich, I keep a lot of enemies
But trick when it's like that, it's cause I been a G
Look at the way women tend to grin at me
I like the way she shake it with a lot of energy
Magnums, alcoholic freaks the remedy
I'm the young Donald Trump, is y'all hearing me?
Girls on the side line, yeah they cheerin' me
Ask her, can she drive a stick, now she steerin me
Man, I'm sick. Know it ain't no curin' me
C to the H to the I-N-G. Y

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I think you need to move it to the left (Shorty)
Move it to the left (Shorty)
If you ain't got your own paper, I don't suggest you hold your breath (Shorty)
Keep it right (Shorty)
You betta keep it tight (Shorty)
You betta bring money out ya crib, cause you ain't getting none of mine, tonight (Shorty)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Put that ass up on the flo', make it clap when you see cats pass for the door
I ain't tryna act gassed at all, chicks attack like he's Joe Crack the boss
Played it back, cause I be so paranoid
I got a wife, but baby please don't back it off
She understood that, said, What's good, Crack?
Got me screaming with a hood, with a hood rat
Mami, I ain't gotta pop the pistil
But the rocks got a gleam, so hard to miss 'em
So I, cut the chase, took her out the place
Put her in a bed, put a smile on her face
She don't know Joe Crack, the Daun
Never spend no type of real cheese on a broad
All I keep is a 100 G's, limit credit card
Could you believe, we could spend it all

New York, Put it on the flo'
New York, Put it on the flo'
Jersey, Put it on the flo'
Jersey, Put it on the flo'
V.A. Put it on the flo'
V.A. Put it on the flo'
Chi-town, Put it on the flo'
Chi-town, Put it on the flo'

[Verse 4: Nick Cannon]
Shorty, you gon' work for this little bit of change
Side order of pimpin', little bit of game
What ya know, gon' hurt, just a little bit of pain
When I rip your skirt, from your little bity frame
Whole lot drinkin', whole lot of cash
Dirty ol' Nick with a whole lot of ass
Fly Guy, Antonio Vargas
Porsches we ain't even parkin
Valet, alligator Air Forces
Waves in my head have them chicks getting nauseous
Let 'em cause the fame, my dough, your world
So shake it like a n-n-n-nasty girl

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I think you need to move it to the left (Shorty)
Move it to the left (Shorty)
If you ain't got your own paper, I don't suggest you hold your breath (Shorty)
Keep it right (Shorty)
You betta keep it tight (Shorty)
You betta bring money out ya crib, cause you ain't getting none of mine, tonight (Shorty)[2x]
