Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Woke up this morning thinking about the other night
Trying to do it all again, like every day is the weekend
Some say it's a problem, I ain't really worried about it
Trying to party over here, like every day is the weekend

No, I can't wait, I can't wait
Stay turnin' up, like every day is the weekend
No, I can't wait, I can't wait
Let's turn it out, like every day is the weekend

Yeah, Monday thru Sunday
Red carpets and runaways, got three girls like the runaways
I'm taking shots, back I, caught that, gun play
Shades on, no sunrays, gone overtime, never underpaid
Ah, all week, no days off like a nine to five that's bossing up
You know I paid the cost
Got a sweet tooth for the sweet life, but I ain't trying to floss
I'm just trying to have a good time, now tell me what you on

Little bit of that orange mixed with Patron
I'm a get you faded by the end of the song
Now we could blow it up, know I got that bomb
Just keep it on the low, so security don't find out

Woke up this morning thinking about the other night
Trying to do it all again, like every day is the weekend
Some say it's a problem, I ain't really worried about it
Trying to party over here, like every day is the weekend

No, I can't wait, I can't wait
Stay turnin' up, like every day is the weekend
No, I can't wait, I can't wait
Let's turn it out, like every day is the weekend

Yeah, summer time and spring time
You can find me intertwined, twisted, bitch, get in line
It's tens here, but if a nigga didn't have a dime
I still find ways to turn it up, better get out your earplugs
It's relevant, we're killing it, no evidence
Straight to the head like Evelyn, no aspirin my medicine
It's that loud pack the bass hit and I bounce back
Don't think that I could drive, try to crash where the couch at

Hold up, what the fuck happened last night?
Can't find where my phone is, throwing up shit like west side
All I need is a shower, let a nigga freshen up my odor
And I see you in the morning, said the party's never over

Woke up this morning thinking about the other night
Trying to do it all again, like every day is the weekend
Some say it's a problem, I ain't really worried about it
Trying to party over here, like every day is the weekend

No, I can't wait, I can't wait
Stay turnin' up, like every day is the weekend
No, I can't wait, I can't wait
Let's turn it out, like every day is the weekend</pre>
