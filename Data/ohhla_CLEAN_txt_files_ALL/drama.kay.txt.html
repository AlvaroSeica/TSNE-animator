Fuck him now, fuck him later, niggaz know cause niggaz seen it (seen it)

So if you wanna fuck wit us, best of have it on ya mind, nigga

[Chorus: Lil' Jon]

[Verse 2: David Banner]
KaySleezy, man it's easy, look, for me to go and bust
On pussy-ass niggaz who can't shut the fuck up

If it's problems come and get me man, I'll dump 150
Out the (A) K, blowin' my way, make his momma say, "oh my!"
Niggaz die, I roll around high
All the dro clicked out bustin' the .44
If ya really buck girl, then you slap that hoe
Knock her out
Bitch look, ya know what I'm about
Born fair
If ya real then put it in the air
Big guns, big funds and real big wheels
Go on hit him in his chest and watch his body windmill
Aw FUCK, David Banner is comin' out the cut
All I got in this world is my word and my nut - fuck nigga

[Lil' Jon talking] + (David Banner)
Yo we gotta let these (yeah) niggaz know what they gettin'
When they fucking startin' wit that bullshit

[Chorus: Lil' Jon]

[Verse 3: Baby D]
Motherfucker want it, get done up
Packin' heat out the summer
BLAOW! BLAOW! in the crowd
Now watch the crowd go ball
And this here (yeeah) about the clip and (hoe) they dug it (hoe)
And givin' blood up (come on)
I'm too fast for 'em
Mr. Potato (oh) Head (ooh), nigga then slid and mash on
Clash on 'em (yeeah), harass 'em (yeeah)
Flash 'em (yeeah) wit a full tank of gas
Then put this (oh) in ya ass
Wit acid (yeeah), without a reason (hoe) ain't leakin'
But (come on) how my tolerance is limited
Got 'em smokin' like chimney, leave ya body dumpin' like Jimmeny
You the enemy that envy me (hoe) it's a sin to be (come on)
Friends wit these niggaz who ain't kin to me
Family, countin' (ooh) the problems, when we jump off probably
Hard and he soft (hey), I was taught (hoe)
Uh, (come on) when you done wit 'em (what?), they better not be able to walk
Don't talk (yeeah) and let your answers speak for ya (for ya)
The block ain't hot until it boil
I love the block (yeeah) like hot pot did Donald Boyle (ooh)
I make bread on the soil

[Chorus: Lil' Jon]</pre>
