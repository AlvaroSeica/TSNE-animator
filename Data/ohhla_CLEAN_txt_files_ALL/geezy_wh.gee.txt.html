(Ziggler the Wiggler talking with B.G.)

[Verse 1: B.G.]
I been on the road movin coke and slangin raps
traveling putting Chopper City on the map
I know I´m a get it with other niggas
I´m the underdawg so they doubt a nigga
but the streets bout a nigga
I´m a uptown big dawg and everone baby left hangin
I´m comin back to getchall
and we gone do it like real niggas do
not one maybach ten lac's comin through
we all got bitches on 24's spinnin
thats how it´s goin down when a real nigga get it
thats why they holdin back and they wont break bread
cuz they already now how B.Gizzle gone play it
I´m a go in the hood bring em another route
all my niggas with bonds I´m a get em out
all my niggas with monkeys I help get em off they back
I done got ride of mine so we rockin like that nigga

[Chorus: Ziggler the Wiggler] + (B.G.)
Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
I heard Juve went back now is you goin back
(you know  Juve thats my dawg but I aint rockin like that)

Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
say Juve went back now is you goin back
(man Juve thats my dawg but I aint rockin like that)

[Verse 2: B.G.]
man I know people who know people
that give me work on the strength
I dont even have to owe people
I know arabs that know arabs
they get work from overseas
I bring it on V.L. and on the ave
I´m off the block so I´m a hold it down
I´m gonna pump this white I´m gonna bump this brown
I´m gonna get it out the mud I´m gonna stand my ground
nigga play me once I aint backin down
nigga fucked me once think he fuck in me again
I might aswell go to jail and be a punk then
I got connects in Detroit Michigan
you coke price fucked up see yo boy and I´m fixin it
I be all in Atlanta Georgia
I still be hollerin at them haitians down in Miami Florida
I´m a hustler baby said he fired me
but that wasn't nothin cuz the streets hired me

[Chorus: Ziggler the Wiggler] + (B.G.)
Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
I heard Juve went back now is you goin back
(you know  Juve thats my dawg but I aint rockin like that)

Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
say Juve went back now is you goin back
(man Juve thats my dawg but I aint rockin like that)

[Verse 3: B.G.]
I done had a one on one with Lil Wayne
told him I got the game for him to do his own thing
I done had a one on one with Lil Turk
I told him kick that dope and we can make shit work
I done had a one on one with Juve to
I told him handle his business and holla when he through
nigga know I´m a hotboy for life
but I aint goin back aint no matter the price
I dont need no nigga nigga need me
I´ll jack him for I let him birdfeed me
I´m a fool with that pistol better ask around
if I´m broke I make niggas pay draft Uptown
I had coke make a fiend catch a cab Uptown
I told him on V.L. on the ave Uptown
it's 2004 if you real then you know
the streets is all mine Chopper City in the do
