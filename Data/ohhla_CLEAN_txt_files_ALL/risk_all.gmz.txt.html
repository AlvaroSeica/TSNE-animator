(Chorus)
What ever happed to the days on the coldasack?
Playing kick ball, stick ball, had the mullet back then
Before I picked up a pen
I was chilling on the block where we had a dead end

[Gumz]
Life; Yo what am I here for?
Same question every single day with no answer
26 years same old shit
Is kinda frustrating when you have this gift
Uh, I lift the pen everyday and put it to the paper
The ink dries and evaporates it into vapor
I make up stuff inside of my head
And put it down and make it rhyme and then I forget
I'm a vessel, created for the greater good
Tried to spread knowledge and I'm fortunate I could
Uh, you gotta live everyday like is your last second
It makes me reminisce when I about eleven
I gotta lesson that I wish I get back
That's about the time I had a chat with my sick dad
"Son you gonna grow up and be strong
Live life to the fullest, soon I'll be gone"

(Chorus) X2

[Gumz]
Growing up everything was a competition
Always had to win, second never my position
From 'Little League' to beating 'Mario 3'
Perfection is the only way I wanna succeed
I try to pass it all down to my brother
You gotta work hard having talent is a mothafucka
Is like it pulls you in two different directions
Take the safe bet or risk it all and be a legend
My personality can only stand so much
Fork in the road, dealt a straight and a flush
I keep getting older and every year I wanna fold up and just quit
And say "fuck this shit" - Is it all really worth it?
Sitting here spitting, trying to figure out my life purpose
And while we living on the surface of Earth
About to give it up and then reverse my birth

(Chorus) X2

[Gumz]
Things are all fucked up from a distance
Growing up shit will change in an instant
Shift the focus from your hopes and your dreams
To money and obscene amounts, greed is the key
Innocence's lost what is it cost?
Your soul and integrity without the remorse
Uh, holy cross shit, get right out
The game is in session you can sit right out
It's all about ranking what is more important
'Cause at the end we all end up in the coffin
'Cause at the end we all end up in the coffin

(Chorus) X2

(Scratching)
"Take the safe bet or risk it all and be a legend"
"Take the safe bet or risk it all and be a legend"
"Risk it all and be a legend</pre>
