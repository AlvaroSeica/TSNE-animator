Love Jones, I got a Love Jones

(repeat 2X)

[Bobby Digital]
Yo girl you shinin like a brand new spankin black glock
or a thousand hundred dollar bills inside a shoebox
Exotic bird, special blend of selected fine herbs
make me wanna kick my bitch to the curb
Shaped like a naked statue, but look sacred
Candy to a baby y'know, I'm ready to take it
She spread your wings like a peacock
Girl you be the bomb, and Bobby be shellshocked!
Behold as I shape and mold your formless globe
into a perfect O, and breathe the breath of life into your nose
With the fragrance of a fresh pink rose
and stroll into your eyes, the windows to your soul
And choose the best part, the dark pupil I chose
Your heart was mutual, into the center I dove
Backstroke in your abyss like a fish
Countin every thought and dream and wish, that exists within six
She was filled with pleasures, of all measures
But never took the time to discover, her own sunken treasure
Unlock the jewelry box, knowledge rose to the top
The distilled back in the fine mists, that gave birth to the crops
and seas, that brought us together, for the better
We could never seperate so maintain your stormy weather
So maintain the stormy weather
Word up, and let's walk these dogs together Boo

Chorus

[Bobby Digital]
Yo, Power Equality, Allah C's Everything my Queen
Whattup Love, won't you just slide under my wings
so we can take flight, to the edge of the night
And like doves, we makin love above the bright moonlight
You know I fills you, so let my love pass and spill through
your sexual vessels, that bless you then fills you
up with knowledge and wisdom you understandin
that bring forth the power refines your whole planet
She couldn't maintain this heavy slang that I dropped upon her
She claimed it never rains, down in Southern California
Bein a black man is most prominant and all dominant
I couldn't wait to get her home so I could explore her dark continent
And put my fountain, between her hills and mountains
Impingin every square inch of her circumfrence I was countin
Twelve trillion, four hundred and seventy-eight billion
one hundred and eighteen million, four hundred thousand ways
to make children, by buildin
Detected a fine mist but couldn't resist, I told her,
"You wanna travel inside my head and see if you could rise above six?"
Then tilt her at the axis then bent her at her equator
and stuck the diamond might deep inside the crater
