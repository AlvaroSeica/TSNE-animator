[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, Napalm
It's the offering, trust me
I built this shit, from the ground up
It's my baby... it's my seed, yo, check it out, yo

[Dom Pachino]
I done grown up, shown up on B.E.T.
Made it possible for folks to see me, G. me not
See me, greet me, see me hot
If I, put out an album and the CD flop
I'mma, do it again, until they treat it like pop
I put work in, so you see I treat it like stock
Pull out a squirt and these bitches scheemin' on cock
Fuck the young shit, you will never see me off lock
But I, see your money and you see my product
If I splurge, and you see it, then you see that I got it
If a paparazzi flashes then that means that I'm spotted
If you seen a power move, then be turning off rotten
Rapped at everybody, killers, most soften than cotton
As far as this new thing shit, you can say that I got it
You can say that I lived it, you can say that I rocked it
I've done did it to the point, ain't a damn one can stop it
I can take it off the head, or build on the topic
I can spit it like acid in a form like it's toxic
Napalm'll make 'em jump and, form like a mosh pit
I'm the talk of the year, I'm the latest gossip

[Chorus 4X: Dom Pachino]
Scuffed up guns, toss the filthy heat then run
It's the arsenal, fill my clip with rusty dum-dums

[Thirstin Howl III]
I'm from the Mecca New York where hip hop's religion
2Pac got shot, Big Poppa sizzling
Ghetto centers, many male benchpresses
Ten crack commandments, broken in the message
I'm a full clip, full throttle, fullano
Fugazi murato, fame, fortune, fools lotto
Fact is of the matter, that my gun ain't spoke yet
Hustle this trigger nigga, language broken
On the train tracks with rats, walking with gats out
I turned real pale, token booth black house
Metro card, EZ Pass, my dick's favorite words, she be back
Grammar grind gritty, glossy, flossy
Alcohol toilet shortage, kidney's frosted
Spectacular, back it up
Albino nickels ain't black enough

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
