Ex (Yeah)
Ex (Kelly and Yung Texxus)
Ex (Yeah)

[Kelly]
I never thought that we would break up for the better
Should've never made the promises to each other
So many things I should've said that you didn't know
Coming in from a past with a heavy load

But I knew that you were a good man
Give me love, you were faithful - It showed on my hand
I know there are questions in your mind you don't understand
Through the words of this song, I wanna answer them

Honesty (Check)
Conversation (Check)
A shoulder I can lean on anytime I'm feeling stressed (Check)
Good loving (Yes)
The perfect soldier (Yes)
Was about to say "I do," when I know it wasn't meant
So I

1 - Search in my mind, trying to figure it out
And thought I was happy but I'm having some doubts
Think I found the answer and I know I must confess
I'm still in love with my ex
And I wasn't ready when I said that I loved you
And in my heart, I know that I gotta tell you
I shouldn't have gone from a situation to the next
I'm still in love with my ex

[Kelly]
Every moment that I stayed, I dug a deeper hole
I was with you but my heart wouldn't let him go
All my family told me, "Kelly he's the one for you"
I know your family love me and I love them too

(I'm so sorry) I'm so sorry for the pain I put you through
But you shouldn't have to suffer cause I'm confused
So much for looking forward to future plans
Lost the love of my life and I lost a friend

Good to me (Yes)
Security (Yes)
You were all the things I wanted
Checking everything (Check, check)
You were comforting (Yes)
Romantic man (Yes)
How could I have said "I do," when I knew it wasn't meant
So I

Repeat 1

[Kelly] (Yung Texxus)
Silence
(I don't know why you're telling me all this now)
I've gotta own this
I've gotta own this game
(Yeah, I ain't the one you chose)
I can't believe I'm saying this..
Saying sorry is the hardest part
(Yeah.. aye, it's Yung Texxus)

[Yung Texxus]
From make-up's to break-up's
His and her Jacob's
Mi amore got issues galore, sure
We was all good-good, and it was all good-good
Now I'm reading old love letters (Damn)
My homies looking at me like, "You know better"
But I'm reminiscing so I had to consider
Did she go hard for me? (Yes)
Take a charge for me? (Yes)
Turn her head when them other hoes was callin' me? (Yes)
I can't lie, when she left she took a part of me
Part of me want her back but part of me can't pardon she (Nope)
Call it foolish pride but shit, who am I?
I made my mistakes, tossed my dirt to the side
Er'time we meet I see the hurt in her eyes
Cause I'm an ex-friend, ex-homey, ex-lover
So stop the phone calls, voicemails, etc.
Shawty keep the ring, forget the day I ever met ya

Repeat 1

Ex
