Song:   Tat It Up
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm goin hard body til theres no more room left
And you ain't ever seen nobody sittin thru this
You got space, tat it up, tat it up, tat it up, tat it up

First off yea I'm tatted up and my bitch too
You just got a bunch of different names like a bitch do
You the type of nigga in the bar tryna pick thru
I be gettin blasted mothafuckin click, boom
Duck, move, no pen but you can call me Bic man
Showin skin you ain't goin ham like an Islam
Light to a dark skinned nigga wit no tan
No shirt in this bitch, Hollywood Hogan
Frankenstein tatted on me cuz I am a monster
See I like the pain you can meet me at the hostel
Face like a aztec, hair bones fossil
All that I did yea my mothafuckin lights on
See it from the front or the back like an iPhone
Walk inside a room n I'm the one they got they eyes on
Me say, you ain't even fuckin with my DJ
Catch up, you ain't even started on your sleeves yet
Need to book a couple more sessions tryna reach this
Ink gun stuck into my flesh its like leeches
All that shadin shows that you just soft
And if you gotta problem middle finger read fuck off
I'm on some new shit, how my face look
I know you wish you thought of this like facebook
And I don't talk give a fuck how the case look
Cuz niggas tryna steal my shit, Bill Gates crooks
And I could pass for a vato
If you tatted, nigga I'm Picaso
I'm the shit you can get it on your nostrils
You can take a picture or get it on your iPod

I'm goin hard body til theres no more room left
And you ain't ever seen nobody sittin thru this
You got space, tat it up, tat it up, tat it up, tat it up
I'm goin hard body til theres no more room left
And you ain't ever seen nobody sittin thru this
You got space, tat it up, tat it up, tat it up, tat it up</pre>
