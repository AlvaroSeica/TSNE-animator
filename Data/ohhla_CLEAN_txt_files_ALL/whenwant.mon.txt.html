Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Pre-Chorus]
I got kush from California
I got bricks on Arizona
Hundred whips in every corner
Bad bitch from Taiwan

[Chorus]
When I want I'm throwing stacks
When I want I hit the dealer
When I want I blow one back
When I want I blow a mil
When I want we poppin bottles
When I want them bitches wilding
When I want that coup a mil
When I want them bitches fine

[Verse 1]
I just got a whole brick from papi
About to hit the stove, get her poppin
None of my niggas moving sloppy
I said meet me on the air, nigga copy
Bitch mind yo business
Them foreign cars, we in em
That blunt money we spent it
They got my partner right sense
Got me smoking on that OG
That granddady my granddady
That purple young like Kobe
No, the drug dealers they know me
I be growing up with Snoop Dogg
On that track with Kendrick
Whippin off my root dog
With cheech and chain, they drippin, whippin
Pump till my wrist hurt
Got a hundred more on my wrist work

[Pre-Chorus]
I got kush from California
I got bricks on Arizona
Hundred whips in every corner
Bad bitch from Taiwan

[Chorus]
When I want I'm throwing stacks
When I want I hit the dealer
When I want I blow one back
When I want I blow a mil
When I want we poppin bottles
When I want them bitches wilding
When I want that coup a mil
When I want them bitches fine

[Bridge]
Them niggas crying all day
We poppin bottles all day
You see them wheels all day
Them bitches lying all day
We counting money all day
I'm talking mils all day
We popping bottles all day
That shit for real

[Verse 2]
And I got white gold, got yellow gold
Got red gold on my neck
I got white hoes, got red bone
Got yellow bone on my dick
And I take it by thanking and I ain't talking about 10 K's
I been counting money bout 10 days
My wrist in chains and houses
I done stuffed up that shoe box
I can't find my sneakers
Money six five, my bitch high
Here am I am wicked
Man, them niggas choke that Lambo
Got Fendy on that hoe
Hundred Gs on that OG
When I talk about that smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
I got kush from California
I got bricks on Arizona
Hundred whips in every corner
Bad bitch from Taiwan

[Chorus]
When I want I'm throwing stacks
When I want I hit the dealer
When I want I blow one back
When I want I blow a mil
When I want we poppin bottles
When I want them bitches wilding
When I want that coup a mil
When I want them bitches fine</pre>
