[Nicki Minaj]
I drove for miles, just to find you and myself
All these screams, al these voices in my head
You gave me strength, gave me hope for a lifetime
I am for once satisfied

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up, givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up, givin up
Givin up... givin up
Givin up

[Nicki Minaj]
It's not your fault, am a bitch, am a monster
Yes am a beast and I feast, when I conquer
What, am alone on my throne, all these witches
I came this way, all this way just to say

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up, givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up, givin up
Givin up... givin up
Givin up

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj] + ad-libs
Am givin up baby, am givin up baby
Am givin up baby, this time won't you save me
This time won't you save me

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up, givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up, givin up
Givin up... givin up
Givin up</pre>
