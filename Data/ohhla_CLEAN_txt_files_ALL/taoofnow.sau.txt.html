(Esthero harmonizes)

[Saul Williams] + (Esthero)
Children of the night..
Only some will star the sky
Only, believers in death will die
And fathers must feather the wings of women
For the unfeathered masses dangle ridiculous
Carrying crosses to phalanx filled tombs
The future sells silence through blood rivered wombs
That ripple with riddles of cows and spoons 
And births Moons and earths
Sun-centered at noon 
And, (Now..) here I stand
Court jestering infinity
Fetal fisted for revolution
But open hands birth humility
Now what you the density of an ego less planet?
Must my, spine be aligned to sprout wings?
I'm, slouched into sling steps and kangoled with gang reps
But my orbit rainbows Saturn rings
Mystical elliptical, Presto Polaris
Karmic flamed future when Saturn and Aries
And now I'm a fish called "Father"
With gills type dizzy
Blowing liquid lullabies through the spine of time
I'm, certain of Saturn rivers, and all else is fact
So baptize me in the stars
And wrap me in nighttime, moon blue
Pupil my sight with orange balls of light
And echo my plight
Through the corridors of metaphor
What else are we living for, if not to create
Fiction and rhyme?
My purpose is to make my soul
Rhyme with my mind over matter
Minds create matter minds create fiction
As a matter of fact as if, matter were fact
Matter is fact
So spirit must be fiction, science fiction, art fiction, meta fiction (Now..)
The tao of now
Is here amongst the living in the voice of children is the tao of now

[Esthero]
You are the divine reflection of this earth
She does not belong to you
No, there is no need for your correction
All rivers run in the same direction

[Saul Williams] + (Esthero)
If you're serving the father, there's no son without mother
Parent bodies discover, water bodies and drown
Wade me in the water 'till Atlantis is found
On the sea floors of self I'm starfish and unbound
Heard that name of that mound is stone mountain
Underwater volcanoes erupt water fountains of youth
Let's us carnal the equation, cancel out wind and truth
Swirl me beyond sometimes, drench me water proof
Let eve drop forever rain sunsets on my roof..
As I, sit on the front porch of my sanity
Deciphering ham bones, to "Van Gogh" this vanity
Oiled egos canvased and framed
To be, reborn unborn, unburied unnamed
(Is it a monster living, it's in the voice of children, now..
It is the tao of now)
A reflection through a blood stained glass window
Of souls gone yellow around the edges
Carbonated dreams and blurred daily lives
But let family bring focus
Out of swamps blossom lotus
The muddy water blue daughters of infinity
Gravity we water bodied Bodhisattva our serenity
As we rise with the tides toward divinity
Yes, we rise with the tides towards divinity
The muddy water blue daughters of infinity
Gravity we water bodied Bodhisattva our serenity
As we rise with the tides toward divinity
Yes, we rise with the tides towards divinity
Yes, we rise with the tides towards divinity
Now, we rise with the tides towards divinity
And we rise with the tides towards divinity
Cause we rise with the tides towards divinity

[Esthero]
Is it a monster living it's in the voice of children..
It is the tao of now..</pre>
