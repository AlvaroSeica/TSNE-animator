Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Last of a dying breed, soil of the Earth
Policed and been hated by the Church since birth
Bent and forgotten was the Prophet in the Prophecy
The Opaque Brotherhood they label it hypocrisy
Like a lost practice of the guilty crimes
Stricken from the blood so they think it won't survive
But the Call the Brotherhood Opaque is too strong
Time to write another chapter, we've been gone far too long

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Look once you see a flash like a shadow
Make a double take your wife gets left a widow
Dark Lotus kinda like a boxer's fist
Five of us packed together, covered up and ready to hit
We turn bodies to souls, souls to blackness
The Devil's most cleverest trick is to make you think you don't exist
We Opaque, translucent and eternal Brotherhood
A secret society buried deep up in the woods

[Jamie Madrox]
Opacity basically means that you can't see
the Brotherhood of Five Elements we get deadly
Behead me
Throw it at your Devil call it wicked
Knee deep in the cloudy water see a Lotus never pick it
Conflicted by thoughts of life and death and in between
If you're true psycho skitso then you're knowing what I mean
As we marchin in concession down the long and windy path
Skeleton hand for a compass, dead skin for a map

[Violent J]
Even on a sunshiny day, I'm grimy
I can't find my way, untie me
I don't mind the hate, it reminds me
I'm of time and space
Five nomads (five)
Followers of no fads
Lotus stem rises up above the pedals of grass
Which was once over towering
Now we overpowering
Planting our seeds for whatever tomorrow brings

[Monoxide Child]
I'm separated and laughed at from most kinds
I stood firm on my own two and passed by
My middle finger in the air because I'm that guy
Who don't give a fuck to watch each and every one of y'all, die
Now put that signal in the sky and let em that I'm a Lotus
And Brotherhood is the life and if we growing keep the fuckers stronger
And we're gonna get it
No longer can we forget all the power that we can shift

[Chorus]
Opaque, black light haunted by the flash
The Lotus grows where the roses pass
No light, no dark, no bad, no good
You can't see through the Opaque Brotherhood
Opaque, black light haunted by the flash
The Lotus grows where the roses pass
No light, no dark, no bad, no good
You can't see through the Opaque Brotherhood
Opaque, black light haunted by the flash
The Lotus grows where the roses pass
No light, no dark, no bad, no good
You can't see through the Opaque Brotherhood
Opaque, black light haunted by the flash
The Lotus grows where the roses pass
No light, no dark, no bad, no good
You can't see through the Opaque Brotherhood
Opaque, black light haunted by the flash
The Lotus grows where the roses pass
No light, no dark, no bad, no good
You can't see through the Opaque Brotherhood</pre>
