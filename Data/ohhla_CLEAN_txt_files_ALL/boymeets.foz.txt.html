Song:   Boy Meets Girl
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Okay this is how the story goes here
Boy meets girl and overcomes fear
The last girl that he dated broke his heart
And right now trying to find some hope is hard
But he's at a new school, got a fresh few
And he says to this girl let me impress you
Starts spiting a rap right in front of her
Tells her everything like he's in love with her
Wow, that's the sweetest thing she's ever heard
But she doesn't understand what he sees in her
She always thought that he'd be like them other guys
But now he poured out his heart she thinks otherwise
So he grabs her hand and sees the sunset
He says "baby just wait I'm not done yet"
I wanna ask you something, don't judge me
You reckon maybe one day you could love me?

And oh he thinks he likes her
Oh he thinks he likes her
But she thinks he's great
And oh he thinks he likes her
Oh he thinks he likes her
But she thinks he's cool

Yeah, he goes home and he's sitting on cloud nine
He's saying to himself, damn it's about time
I finally found someone I can share my life with
And if I'm lucky then maybe I can wife it
So he calls her up to see if she's home
But she let's it ring right to the message tone
An hour later, somehow she calls him back
He can hear someone else saying "who is that? "
"Please tell me you're not with another guy"
"Don't be stupid that's only my brother, why? "
He said sorry but I have some insecurities
That's why I need to be with you, you can cure me
My heart still skips a beat every now and then
And if you can't see by now I'm a gentlemen
I'm the type that will open the door
Not the type to take you home just to hope he can score

And oh he thinks he likes her
Oh he thinks he likes her
But she thinks he's, great
And oh he thinks he likes her
Oh he thinks he likes her
But she thinks he's, cool

Yeah, he rocks up in his ute for the first date
He says usually these are the worst day
But there's something in the air and he feels that
Looks in her eyes and says "can you feel that? "
I don't know if it's me or it's just the vibe
Nah forget about it, you know I'm never right
She says "look I know you're a nice guy
But I can't keep holding back this white lie
I don't think that you and I can work out
And I'm sorry cause I know that you're hurt now
But like you, my heart was in two
And just like a rose, I'd be a thorn to you
Don't get me wrong, it was fun you're a sweet heart
I just honestly don't think that we'd last
It always happens to us with the biggest hearts
I guess they're right, nice guys finish last"

And oh he thinks he likes her
Oh he thinks he likes her
But she thinks he's, great
And oh he thinks he likes her
Oh he thinks he likes her
But she thinks he's</pre>
