[La the Darkman]
Yo
Niggaz is feeble, I call up a vine-man like Ben' Siegal
I'm anti-evil, plus I touch a Desert Eagle
My life's illegal, slave man princess' is equal
The Devil's leathal, he killed a hundred million people
I'm Darkman, Iceman, La, Wu-Tang Clan
Trapacanty, Sensai, Â¿comprende?
My marine corps, straight from the trojan war
Black capped crusador, trapped off, flame thrower
Stuck a chain store when I was dirt poor for my reward
Next week the Germans have me on a bulletin board
I beat that case, they couldn't identify my face
I'm Triple Darkness, silence or I'll have you erased
Me and my Wu pirates start riots with Osirus
Math, I apply it, kill you, but I'm quiet
Repect the Abbott, it's love Allah
Shine like a superstar, sting with the cobra claw

Yo
I enter through the chamber of your ear
in a high-pitched silent tone only a dog could hear
And impregnante you, with the wisdom of the Wu
Then your sub-conscious dreams come constantly true
Have you in such deep thought, your pulse and blood presure's so low
you diagnosed as corpse
Havin outer body experience, Clan no interference
Everything with physical form, lose appearance
We become one with the formulas, now you feel the strongest
Escape, trample lies, you live for the longest
Live a thousand years in a day
Without opening your mouth you say everything you wanted to say
Attract to the call of the Earth, I stay grounded
The Sun in the center of this, I'm surrounded
My planets in midst, I spins, the windchill
But my light melts your snowflake from ninety-three mil'
All with the ear, let 'em here as we reveal
Cause one ear of corn can produce a cornfield
And one cornfield can produce the corn mill
The bread from the body of Christ, Orangeville
With the truth of life inside your bone marrow
You could make your physical as large as your shadow
Whether space or cyborg, optic is fiber
Become a pawn, multimedia subscriber
And hibernate, the Wu tape in your mental state
Let it meditate, sit back and await
The orders, for this you don't need no tape recorder
So let's prepare for the Wu World Order
