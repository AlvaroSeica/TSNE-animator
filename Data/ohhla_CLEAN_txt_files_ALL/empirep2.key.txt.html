[Intro: Raekwon]
Shallah! Yo Green! Young God with a blue hat on

[Raekwon]
I'm not like Sinatra, more Samy, the jammy in my right arm
The streets that I rose from, goes on
Living in poverty, it gotta be a way to get on
I sit back watch the just kids follow me
You can't touch it yet, the best ones know
And the rest kept seeking, I survived the check, yo
From living on the wrong side of the town, where every problem occur
Everybody heard it went down
It's just our city, our hometown, our squad, the yard
From out the east coast, with plans like Shallah
The dreams, they can happen, but it's near, so protect ya dome
Whenever nine home, we standing right here
Yo, from playing Green Lantern to the Hamptons
Or camping in the next nigga hood, I'm just good, I'm lamping
The Empire, the flyer we get, the higher we sit
But everybody wanna ride on our dick, but

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of, there's
nothing you can do
Now you're in New York, these streets will make you feel brand new, these
lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[N.O.R.E.] (Capone)
New York State of Mind (always) pissy elevators and (hallways)
Cheese line grease (crudded in the doorways)
42nd Street lights (gamble harder, three dice)
Niggas get murked at the same place they was raised at
(We shoot niggas, run for cover) they don't even graze back
(Army suits and Timb boots, New York made that)
CNN The Embassy, Mafioso Militainment
Peeing cases in the city, Roset Jose
(They saying New York fell off? That shit never bother me)
No place like home, go and ask Dorothy
(Money stacks still in the bank) Taller than Barkley
(Queens blood in my vein, New York make my heart beat)
Big Pun, ODB, Biggie Smalls
Jam Master Jay, keep it (yes yes ya'll)
(The birth place of rap, the number one city on the map
New York we put it down like that, like that)

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
The New York walk, the New York talk
The New York streets, with New York thoughts
24 dollars, used to be New York cost
We all got what it take to be a New York boss
Rich or poor, we all have a ball here
So every New Year they drop the Ball here

[Chorus]</pre>
