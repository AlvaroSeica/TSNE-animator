9th Wonder, Warren G
It's classic y'all

Yeah, give respect to the trigger finger
I've been pushed that line since grade school, a fool
Since I touched down, bitches they want to fuck now
But can't get it, she got ass with her nose like... Pippen
My pimping, it ain't never scared
Got real estate over there and hustle over here
Dare a nigga try to take it, he gon' fake it till he make it
Shorty break 'em like a bracelet, that's real talk
Yeah, don't you snitch if you get caught
You already know if you do then you dead
And now niggas in the hood trading kush for your baby mama throat
But suck it up bitch, deal with it
Huh, ain't no glitch in my computer
Banging beats for the Gouda, paper plains, no hookahs
Yeah, I'm driver and the shooter and the taxi
I dare you motherfuckers get at me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I dare you motherfuckers get at me, yeah

[MURS]
See I grew up with the blue team before there was a Ustream
Seen a lot of niggas knocked out over shoe strings
Rhyming on these beats since the nineties, I'm a factor
Here with this career until I'm in the hereafter
Classic with this mic like Mike when he was blacker
And you? You remind me of me when I was wacker
I read lines and bring drama like an actor
But I'm so Hollywood that you would think that I'm a rapper
You think I got it backwards? It really doesn't matter
Producer meets the rapper, he's the former, I'm the latter
Spacing out these bars so you niggas can climb on
I'm proof that you can still make loot and keep your rhymes strong
Burn out the industry as hot as my performance
Be the mainstream dream meets the nightmare of normalcy
The anti of everything cool
Still most likely to succeed cause there ain't no rules, yeah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, my nigga we out chere, photo cutlass
Another known for your luggage, don't trip
You fabricate to the public, we don't believe shit, believe it or not
Call your bluff, then leave your ass with knots
The juggernaut is in your rectum, call Pac and resurrect him
I'm sure to cause a spectrum, especially when my mental telepathy
start to F 'em, A.K.A. fuck 'em
A.K.A. nothing's in my way once I start b-b-bucking, fuck up your function
and your house party, my life surely about fortune and vice
If the Feds caught me I tread softly, judge toss me life
And your high-tops and my posse came to properly fight
Everyone's watching alright? If you're not watching me, lie
Still my big cousin a kite
Got my shit buzzing when shit wasn't a doorbell, an insect or a light year in sight
Amen, now won't you be a man and pay respects
Enjoy as we progress, destroy your baby steps
