[Pitbull]
Me not workin hard?
Yeah right! Picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, that's right

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Tonight, I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight... let's do it tonight
Grab somebody sexy tell 'em HEY
Give me everything tonight {*4X*}

[Pitbull]
Take advantage of tonight
Cause tomorrow I'm off to do battle, perform for Prince
Yes but tonight, I can make you my queen
and make, love to you endless
It's insane to wait and they ain't growin money
Keep flowin hustlers move beside us
So I'm tip-toein to, keep blowin
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my life, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight - dame

[Interlude: Nayer]
Excuse me (excuse me)
But I might drink a little more than I should, tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could, tonight
And baby I'ma make you feel so good, tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab them at least you fall on top of the world
Think about it, cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of yo' girl (ha~!)
What I'm involved with is deep and it amazes
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family is from Cuba, but I'm an American Idol
Gettin money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight - dame
