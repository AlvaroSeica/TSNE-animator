(Love)

[Grouch]
Treatin' the lady in your life right's not uncool
Think back to all the good thing she's done for you
Why you wanna lock her in the house?
And when she tell the truth you wanna pop her in the mouth?
That ain't right, it's suicidal
All she ever did was make you look good when you riding
Plus you have someone to confide in
She's your other wing, how you glidin?
Without that, you out back forgettin about the facts of life
Testosteroned out, actin like
You wanna fight
Really you want love
Silly if you stop if she can fit you like a glove

[Grouch]
Girls, are girls, they love me (x4)

[Grouch and Eligh]
I can't do it by myself with this god, without Earth, without (?) mic stop
Every good man needs a woman and a woman needs a man
We need balance in life and hip-hop

[Eligh]
If I can't be myself I'm by myself
That what I gotta remember if I'm placed on a back shelf
Sitting alone on the front porch with a bottle of moonshine
Couldn't handle that bottle of sunshine
It was too strong for one heart to contain, no one lie
From a (???) you can make it right
On my flight, my path took one where it did
Took me too long to realize the simple truth
that now I'm all decrepit on a porch with 100 proof
Change my ways, rearrange my days
Feel the comfort of a love affair to play inside like a byline
Fresh like the ride to the touch of a groom
in a room full of folk that ya love, givin hugs
Pull the plug - when the passion is gone
I'm lashing out against the world because my love is my girls
And my girls consists of two things on this Earth that I feel
One's my best friend and one lives in the periphery
Being on this planet
Came to meet you
I love the both of you
I love the both of you

[Grouch]
Girls, are girls, they love me (x4)

[Grouch and Eligh]
I can't do it by myself with this god, without Earth, without (? ?) mic stop
Every good man needs a woman and a woman needs a man
We need balance in life and hip-hop

[Grouch]
How you treat a flower like a stick?
On a power trip
Only a coward flips out on a female
Mad when she get attention
That's your own insecurity like you didn't have a ?pension
Settin rules and double standards
Cuz you ain't cool
You're troubled and scared
Be a man, there's a way to treat a woman
Let her be herself or else she'll hate to see you c?min
Strong and stunning
Confident and cunnin
With a softer side to keep em running to ya
I'ma ?pun It to ya' like ?(dear sketch it)
Treat your love right or someone might snatch it
