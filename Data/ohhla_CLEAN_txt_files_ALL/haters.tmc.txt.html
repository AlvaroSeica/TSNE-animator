Shit, brah Bucks, these niggas' can't stand to see a nigga' like me 
They hatin' and shit brah, I'm sayin' why is they hatin'? 
Cause I'm fuckin' they broads, I'm drivin' my cars 
My house keys gold, What the fuck they hatin' for? 
My record company worth six figures about to be seven figures 
Man they can't stand this shit, 
I'mma keep on fuckin' they broads nigga' 

Dem' haters can't stand to see a nigga' like me 
They see dem' gator boots and (ver)sace' suits they know who it be 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air 
Man dem' haters can't stand to see a nigga' like me 
They see dem' gator boots and (ver)sace' suits they know who it be 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air

Y'all know me gator boot down from Chucktown 
I represent the south, I'm the coldest nigga' in this town 
Hoe's this way, hoes that way shit 
Cars and broads nigga' that's the only way I play 
Bezels nigga' with the 20 karat begets 
I'm mobbin' round' town with my fuckin' wet sex 
Ice on shine nigga' keep your eye's blind 
Ask anybody I be like this at all time 

(MegaBucks) 
You better reach for your heater 
Put up your dick-beaters 
Mega-Man wettin' niggas' like a Pepsi 3-liter 
Geech(ie) boys got dem' niggas' in the club gettin' wild 
Niggas' drinkin' Dom P. like its going out of style 
Hoes steady clockin', cause' a nigga' on shine 
Playa-hatas congregatin' tryin' to take whats mine 
I stay strap with dem' thangs, in case a nigga' wanna trip 
I got 44 ways to put a stop to that shit 

Dem' haters can't stand to see a nigga' like me 
They see dem' gator boots and (ver)sace' suits they know who it be 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air 
Man dem' haters can't stand to see a nigga' like me 
They see dem' gator boots and (ver)sace' suits they know who it be 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air 
Put your hands up nigga' throw dem' Rollie in the air

60 g's on my Lexus truck 470 
Candy paint, twenty inch, a nigga' rollin' heavy 
Woodgrain, TV's,????????????? 
Sunday at the Battery I'm comin' through 
Megabucks layin' in the that Rover 
Got pulled over 
I think you betta' let em' go brah 

(MegaBucks) 
Even dem' cops know me and T dem' Carolina dogs 
Gotta clique of major niggas' 263 be the bomb 
If you ain't holdin' 50 g's why you talkin' bout' cheese 
I open the door to my home with gold and platinum house keys 
When it's cold outside I put the Misses on the street 
If it ain't a hundred percent it ain't touchin' my feet 
I love my sex wet stack chips like duplex 
Ice keep my wrist cold 
Bought a sweater for my Lex 
Bitches I ain't hatin', ain't no breakin' my bond 
If I make a million my whole clique gon' make a million 
If you can get with that, you betta stack up your chips 
If you can't shut the fuck up and let us ballas do this
