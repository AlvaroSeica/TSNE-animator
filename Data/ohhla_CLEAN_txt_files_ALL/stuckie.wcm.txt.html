OOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
I'm gonna fuck your motherfuckering ass up!
I put that on set
I'm over here; entering the territory with my Rag Trey
With the Hundred Spokes Gold knock-Ons
I mean the Gold Knuckles, whatever the fuck it is
With my Ken Wood Facer
And I'm in Enemy Territory like I said
Now you get one of the homies from the hood
With the flat bed, to get me on the fuck up out here
This ain't Audi, seventeen thousand, five hundred
This is the Tap Ass - and I'm out!</pre>
