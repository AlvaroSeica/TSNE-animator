[Chorus 2X: Mike Posner]
French, inhale
I like the way you French, inhale
Do it again

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, you don't gotta sell it, cause it's already sold
And you don't gotta roll one cause it's already rolled
Check out my technique, just weed, let it fold
Shit I've been smokin since I was 14 years old
I had a dime who never smoked blunts, just bowls
Taught me how to blow O's, inhale through my nose
So if you see me smokin don't blow my high
Hm-hm... uhh
So I roll one and we both gon' fly
You smell it all in my clothes
I'm takin in all the smoke when I

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I take it to the face, inhale it through my nose
Blowin with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes
And crack-a-lack, peel it back
What you call a mack who crack a bad bitch like that? A Cracker Jack
I'm like a florist, tourin like a tourist
Godzilla flyin on a Pegasaurus
Niggaz know about it, even 'fore I pull it out
I put some fire on it, and now they beggin me to put it out
I'm in the hallway, rollin on the purple site
I know the ins and outs so I'ma do what the fuck I like, yeah

[Chorus]</pre>
