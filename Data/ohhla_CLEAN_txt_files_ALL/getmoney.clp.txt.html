(Bridge - Pharrell)
Take money, money, ha
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money

(Pharrell talking)
This where the party at y'all
The whole world, y'all ready, come on

(Verse 1 - Malice)
Remember me, I called you brainless
I made you famous, first line crimes I commit heinous
Listen up, while my whole team glisten up
We flossin' up, so the on-lookers feel the rush
Call out Terror, arrogant like such
Keep two hot ones, never too late to bust
Fifty bricked up, lapping sipped up
Shake on each y'all baby I'm tricked up
Feeling me no so, y'all niggas, oh so
Got three bikes, there's money, sex, and Polo
Either you a no show, or lit up loco
Can't never miss type shit
No more comin' a y'all masked out, open face I blast out
In that NSX targa top sun roof then mash out
That's how we lash out, 100 g whips to crash out
Target get hit, money get split up, then dash out

(Chorus - Pharrell)
We get money, whether rain, or sunny, why y'all looking funny
Baby we get money, we could get money
We on E, cause everyday is a fee, baby don't you worry bout me
Cause I'ma get cash, and push the S Class

(Verse 2 - Pharrell)
Yo, you cats mind flying colors, me and my crime brothers
Blind lovers, full of love and shine mothers
Piss me off like duck tape, and bind mothers
Time cutters, paint off a Rarri's, wine colors
We speed out, since I'm the leader only I lead out
No worry navigational, L-C-D, read out
Y'all broke fellas, they cold fellas, really weed out
I associate wit short Miami, Cubans keyed out
And only friends wit low pills, that coke kill
That drive that rimmed out Ac' Coupe, wit Brooke Shields
Pray to God she don't find out, m√©nage gon' sell
And if it ain't 100 grand dog forget it no deal
Check it out, yo fellas I'm nice, listen to my verse
Hold your breathe long enough, you might see Christ
Y'all critics killing me, y'all must have got my point
All on my dick, and all I drop was on hot joint, what

(Chorus - Pharrell)
We get money, whether rain, or sunny, why y'all looking funny
Baby we get money, we could get money
We on E, cause everyday is a fee, baby don't you worry bout me
Cause I'ma get cash, and push the S Class

(Bridge - Pharrell)
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money

(Verse 3 - Pusha T)
Now blessed with the finer things, in my years designer names
Parking my ride sideways in fire lanes
See it's kinda strange from have-not, to now have
If I flip and I wreck my whip and now laugh
Went from restless, to guess list
Diamonds and necklace, 500 S's, 100 miles and reckless
Except this, we wanna burn you out
Team feed up, or speed up, you know my style
Like shots, through, the room, clap, clap
Yo my crew, move, the room, it's like that
And if you feel, you wanna resume, than write back
But yo, I hope y'all know we strike back
Now you exhale, I'm Nextel, two less shells
And get to let the market at, cassettes sell
I used to be in a storm, now I'm sipping Gennycong
Flips be, owning the streets, yo through an intercom

(Chorus - Pharrell)
We get money, whether rain, or sunny, why y'all looking funny
Baby we get money, we could get money
We on E, cause everyday is a fee, baby don't you worry bout me
Cause I'ma get cash, and push the S Class

(Bridge - Pharrell)
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money

Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money, what
Make money, money, take, money, money</pre>
