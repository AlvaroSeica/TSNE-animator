Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ooh ooh yeah
Have you ever loved somebody that has been knocked down
And then nobody lend a hand to pick you up off the ground
You got to look inside yourself baby, you got to believe
This is your moment, come and ride with me

Yeah I'm travellin' at light speed
Yeah
Up up and away
Up up and away
See I'm runnin on a laser beam
Yeah
Come and take me away
Come and take me away

And I do a fifty buck on the one way
Till tomorrow I get there someday
See me ride with my back to the past
And my face to the flash
Takin' pics on the run way
I'm a model this
Can't throttle this, give us free
Ya know how I pull the throttle back
Give us speed (let's go)
I'm focussed like a laserbeam (let's go)
Scattered brains don't make the team (let's go)
Everythin' that I am
Everythin' that I am not
Put it all on the line
'Cause I'm real with it
I don't care from where you're from
I don't care what you got
You can still get it

Yeah I'm travellin' at light speed
Yeah
Up up and away
Up up and away
See I'm runnin on a laser beam
Yeah
Come and take me away
Come and take me away
Ooh ooh yeah

Don't ever sweat what you can handle
Take one step at a time
And if it get's too hard
Call me up anytime
I'm gonna be the one to show you
Who you really can be
This is your moment, come and ride with me

Yeah I'm travellin' at light speed
Yeah
Up up and away
Up up and away
See I'm runnin' on a laser beam
Yeah
Come and take me away
Come and take me away</pre>
