Song:   Dust Off
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
We make make mistakes as we want
We fall but we get up and dust ourselves off
Try again if it don't work out
1 - We ain't perfect, we ain't perfect
2 - You ain't perfect, we ain't perfect

[Hodgy Beats]
Uhh~! I'm on my come down
Hi everyone! I'm high everyone
Sick with tellin the truth because I lie to everyone
Smile cheese with ease provide a piece of pie to everyone
Though I hate you inside I wish you'd all die everyone
Everyone is death to anyone without a cause
Unless it's with a fuckin semi gun and some balls
These nuts, over his hail like there's nuts, over his head
Pause - I'm on my come down
So let me come down and let my kids run around
She lookin up at me dumbfound
Keanu who, oh you dumb now?
It got a little reckless, with a random bitch nekkid
It's brunch, she cookin me breakfast and she rockin my necklace
Real diamonds on a fake woman is a fail
That's a love lockdown without the cuffs and the jail

[Chorus]

[Mike G]
Uhh, yeah - I tell 'em don't stop, go forth
They wasn't grindin like I was, that's their loss
That's why you see me in the streets like there's 4 of me
And I don't need support because I'd rather have loyalty
Yeah, that's what these niggaz lack
I heard once you hit the top there's no goin back
But I ain't worried cause I like how that sound
because once I hit the top, I ain't fuckin lookin down
I gets in jars full of green, spinnin gold bottles
Kids already treat me like a fuckin role model
I stayed in my lane, set my own speed
Now O.F. is all I really need
Cause I just wanna get high, make money money money
Cut the niggaz off that try to take somethin from me
Yeah I'm on my high horse like I'm playin rugby
And nigga I put in work, you can say that you are lucky</pre>
