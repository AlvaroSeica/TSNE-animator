[Intro: RZA]
One-two.. yo..
Yo.. yo.. yo.. yo.. yo
Yo.. yo..

[RZA]
280 grains of gun powder stuffed inside the cartridge
Split ya wig, drive you off the Gotham's Bridge
Wild like a finger of Hercura
Scholastic type brain like Aken Handsurdera
I've got wolves that'll murder ya for a veggie burner
Spaghetti heads, meet the heavy burner
I put a oodle up in ya noodle
Then I head to the dread spot for a bag of that doodoo
Black photographic, I don't know no magic
But I know how to hold a full automatic
Add a nickel to it son if you have to add it
Better make sure ya kevlaar is steel padded
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I've got beaucoup cess
Get beaucoup from best bitches plus I shoot through vests
Drive Fast Cars, crash bars at 5 AM
Stash jars of hash inside the backyard

[Chorus: girl (RZA)]
Come on Bobby
Let's lay down and let's get some sleep
(Word)
Bobby.. come here baby
Lay down, let's get some sleep

[RZA]
I can't sleep like a child on Christmas Eve
Like a tender head girl in a shop gettin' a weave
Like a woman in labor about to produce the seed
Or Method Man with Playstation and an ounce of weed
Some say it's hard to distinguish, cuz my form of broken English
when spoken, the light I provide it cannot be extinguished
or eclipsed by a 1000 moons, I stay in tune
And praise the Most High past the day of their doom
I squeeze black rubber grip 22 D's on the rims
Squeal out, leavin' black rubber skids, other kids
couldn't match to the old Pistol Pete pop, beast stop
The heat pops, you better get your mother kid
This is Bad News Bears
like Eddie Munster, I keep a dragon under my stairs
Plus a gun in my hat, ain't no runnin' from that
Ain't no runnin' with that pack
The poison apple, dunn, I crush Kings
Get my daily protein from rice and crushed beans
Leap over a fierce MC in a single bounce
Detect the name of a song from a single sound
You get blown from a single round
of a tre-pound, last wiz you heard was that single sound
BLAP! Now you flame tingles, you don't want to mingle around
Check it son, I raise ya Sun ya get burnt in a twinkle
In the spin of a rim goin' 80,000 RPM
Girls be like, nah be him, that grilly be sparkin' shit
And give these other dogs ideas they be barkin' with
Whether landin' airplanes or parkin' whips
Sippin' on that Goose or sparkin' spliffs
I put ya head in a vicegrip
Have my man tag the W with a ice pick
Buy ya girl a pair of nice tits
So you know that I keep all my ho's in some nice shit
Tell ya moms I said nice lips
And she must've been bustin' ya ass cuz her hands had a nice grip
And tell ya pops get off that Ike shit
Or I'ma go across his mothafuckin' head on some old pipe shit
Y'all jump like some Mexican beans
I move with the most excellent team
We invested in jeans and we invested in teens

[Chorus]</pre>
