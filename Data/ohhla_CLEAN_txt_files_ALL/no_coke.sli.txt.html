Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Cuh we don't need no cocaine
We don't need no ecstasy
To ruin our brains
Only one thing sets us free
Frees our pain
Talkin' 'bout the herb

Cuh we someone just like you
Everythin' we do the same
Or is that true?
Girl, I love you Mary Jane
What would I do?
Fall without the herb

So put your love into this
Girl, and don't you feel no shame
Just let this be
Girl, I love you Mary Jane
And she love me
All about the herbs

Cuh we don't need no cocaine
All we need is good sensi
To rule our brains
Only one thing sets us free
Frees our pain
Talkin' 'bout the herbs

Cuh we someone just like you
Everythin' we do the same
Or is that true?
Girl, I need you Mary Jane
What would I do?
Fall without the herbs

So put your love into this
Girl, and don't you feel no shame
Just let this be
Girl, I love you Mary Jane
She needs me
All about the herb</pre>
