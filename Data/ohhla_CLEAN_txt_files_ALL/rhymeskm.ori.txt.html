[Verse 1]
Cops is looking at me
Even when I take a piss
Thinking I got rocks in my pocket
Like I'm the alchemist
But that's not me not O
Never served that yae yo
Not even proud of the fact I've been to jail
Another Hispanic male who turned to a stat
Another number for the government
To hold my people back
Hunger is like the price of freedom
For a smuggler
Younger guys capitalize on music
And bring us under
Ground I'm that shit that civilizations hide
And the discovery won't be understood
Till 2045
Spit on a page to create a dna strand
Scientist try to clone it to create a new society plan
See hope for the future
If they succeed
Because the world today is full of money
Power and greed
I try to explain over rugged terrain
The mind within the brain
And the knowledge contained
In this systematic aristocratic
Fake diplomatic illusionary crafted
Balance within the planet
Amongst the people but not divided to them
Left to fend for themselves
In a world reaching its end
Heard sermons on apocalypse
Last days lunar eclipse
Scientific prophecies on when we'll seize to exist
But I'm going to keep writing rhymes
As that day approaches
While the president gets drunk
Off power risking cirrhosis

[Hook]

Illegal business control the justice
System now we off the chain
If you got no dough then stay on bolo
Cuz freedom is hard to obtain
This environment is parasitic
Pigs with quotas for tickets
District attorney wanna mark us with digits
Misinformation is givin to us daily
My paranoia state is driving me crazy
Whatchu think the CIA didn't have a part to play
Bringing the drug epidemic to the USA
They funding the prison industrial complex
Shit is worse than an airline receiving a bomb threat
Be on the look out for stake outs
And cops who
Plant evidence and later arrest you
See my mind's focus can't help but protest
Never turn the other cheek I've always notice
Tantas noches los pobre homeless
Abandonado enserado viviendo hopeless
I always think of the possibility
That it might be me
Begging for a dollar fifty
Holding a squeegee in one hand
Hoping if you see me that you really
Give a damm
Give me change and I don't mean coins
Life is a pain in the ass
Worse than hemorrhoids</pre>
