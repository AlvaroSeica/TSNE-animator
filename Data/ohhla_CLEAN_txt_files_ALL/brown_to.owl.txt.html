[Knightowl]
Well Im brown to the bone
Cafe is the color of my skin
The crazy knightowl is back once again
With another dope rola
I stop the car, I see a hina walkin sola
She got near the raffla
She was lookin kinda buena
Como te llamas she said Elena
Le dije mi nombre
Pero me dicen Tecolote
Y saves que girl you got me all ?
Your fine
And your a perty as chicana
Spend the night, I'll take you home in the manana
Di que si baby doll
Get in my carucha
You heard about me and they told you to be trucha
Otraves como la ves, the same story
A rumor started by a girl named Lori
Selosa, cause down came her pantalones
When I was through I sent her home sin calsones
All excited, and told her friends I was her vato
And then I had problemas with her brother gato
A cholo, a young vato actin kinda loco
I put in check cause to me he's just a moco

[Knightowl]
Another day is about to begin
Fresh out the cama
Open the frige and I grab me a cahuama
Temprano, early in the morning pistiando
Por que ando crudo y me la estoy curando
Wating for the homies
The car show is about to begin
All of a sudden hear the telephone ring
Quevole, who's this por el otro lado
Then heard the horn of my homie's El Dorado
I broke, I got in the raffla
So now we take a little vuelta
I almost flew out the puerta
Damn homie, slow it down
This is a low rider
And as we turn to the right
A couple of stacked up feel them brown chicanitas
Se miran vuenas y pa todas las hynitas
Un veso les damos por ser las mas hermosas
Hoye como van y mira com son las cosas
With the O - W - L
A mexicano vien tumbado
Creased up y con el pantalon ahuado
Who is down for the verde, blanco, y colorado
Toda la sangre que por uno a deramado

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
Im cruisin around a young bum flips a dedo
Yo paro el carro y digo "que honda? quieres pedo
Con migo?" he said "simon" haora
I gave him credit cause soca had some ?
But still, that aint enough to try to come to get the gloves on
You te dejo just like a tampon
Sangrado so who you tryin to mad dogg ese
Got out the ride and had to teach the boy a lesson
El respeto no meresen of an O - G
Then drove away as I listened to my oldies
Una ves mas
We better get along and have pas
The brown against the brown
That aint the way to get down
Thats why Im doing this sound
Now dont get me wrong
Im still down with the barrio
I dedicate this to The Wolf and Mario
Rest in peace from this earth
You had to depart
But you will always be inside of the heart of the town
And all the homies that gather around
Agaren la honda and be proud to be brown</pre>
