Song:   I Know
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know, I know, I know, I know
Cause I know you are the one I can call
My own, my own, my own

I'm just wondering if you can find time for me
Cause I'm standing, at you walking love, you finder's a fee
And I'm willing to pay, shit I'm willing to save it
I ain't tryina hit and quit, I'm tryina hit it and claim it
I'm talking all night, then hit it in the morning, is that alright
Breakfast in bed, while you yawning from that long night
Then we sex 5th shoppin, blow it all right
I'm just saying that you looking like a goddess
For you I'd go the hardest
Honestly baby, I'm being modest
And you ain't even with me for the fact I'm making dollars
But you love it when I get you in that bed and make you holler

Your love is all for real, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you hold me down for real, I know, I know, I know
And if there's one thing in this world
That you need to know is I'm your girl
Cause I know you are the one that I can call my own, my own, my own

Ah, when them lame niggas holler, you just pass them, laughing
Sexy ass fat as a kardashian
You know how to hold a nigga down when them times get rough
And when you come around, them other bitches' time is up
Yeah, you all I need in my world, no need for a groupie
All I need is my girl, she keep my head on straight
And she my eyes behind my head, and she keep a nigga focused
And she keep a nigga fed
Kiss her on the forehead, then she give me more head
Gave her 20 racks and tell her blow it, this is your bread
Safe in the condo, baby I got more loot
Offshore accounts large amounts, you could blow through

Your love is all for real, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you hold me down for real, I know, I know, I know
And if there's one thing in this world
That you need to know is I'm your girl
'Cause I know you are the one that I can call my own, my own, my own

Ah, you the one like Neo, a dime times 10, all them other bitches zero
Riding in the coup, trees burning while the top off
Louie V queen, them other bitches is knock off
Red bottoms, red dottem, you killin them
Gudda chick, but you still sweet like cinnamon
You was made for a nigga like I, so tell them other niggas don't try

Your love is all for real, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you hold me down for real, I know, I know, I know
And if there's one thing in this world
That you need to know is I'm your girl
'Cause I know you are the one that I can call my own, my own, my own</pre>
