[Intro]
Papoose
Streetswerps entertainment

[Hook]
This is mixtape murder, I say some of the illest shit they heard off
They better off going to get there burner
This is mixtape murder
Mixtape, spit straight murder
This is mixtape murder
Mixtape murder, mixtape murder

[Papoose]
It's streetsweepers to the death on you bastards
When I die put a streetsweeper in my casket
And close it just let me lay there with the ratchet
Yeah, dust to dust and ashes to ashes
So the snake who killed me can walk in laughin'
By the grace of God I will jump up blasting
Acting like you're built,
yous a fucked up has been
I dress with a gun tuck fashion
I'm a monster son of raw, I spit Americas most wanted bars
My will power got more will then a hunderd cars
I'ma show these niggas how to deal
just cut the cards
Yous a cocksucking broad, look
You got something you wanna get off your chest
besides your fucking bra
stop throwing hits
throw shoots confront it pa
I don't got drama with none off y'all
But I hope you niggas kill eachother
I don't like neither one off y'all
You can go try too get whoever you wanted, ball
Tell 'em I'ma problem that they can't fucking solve
Acting like you're really
thugin' hard and bucking craws
He thugin' because of y'all
They put the battery in your back, now you think you're a fucking star
Hit you in your back and blow the battery out off your stomach pa
Who died left them in charge
Carried so many hoods on my shoulders
I need somebody to give me a massage
Sellin' jars off weed, if he pull out another jar
Fuck huggin' the block I'ma have him huggin' God
Cross me your heart won't live to beat another throb
My gun got fired so much it need another job
I told you in Alphabetical Slaughter, I was enlarged
My whole borrow be bustin' crawns
You can't walk too Coney Island bumpin' niggas you buggin', pa
You ain't just brushin' past niggas you bumpin' hard
Next time make you sure you know who you bumpin', pa
Most of my coney island niggas will leave you slumped on them bumpin' cars
Stop sayin' you wont get a nigga who frontin', robbed
I don't care if you won't, I would (wood) like a lumberyard
Everytime you see the entourage we come too rob
Charged with a burage, regadless commin' hard
Hit harder then Bernard
We parked in your garage
Your broad's, in MÃ©nage
Hearts become enlarged
Your dogs just duck and dodge
Your squad just run and jog
Arson, grand losety laws
And rip, bars apart infront off y'all
Carve a couple scars,
Harlem some parts of Yonkers
Way across the Bronx and
From cradle too coffin'
Give a fatal abortion
I'm able to off 'em
Brook-nan too Parsons, buzzin' hard
Don't cross the repertoire
Dog, see you at the next morgue
The son off song, What

[Hook]
This is mixtape murder, I say some of the illest shit they heard off

This is mixtape murder
Mixtape, spit straight murder
This is mixtape murder
Mixtape murder, mixtape murder
