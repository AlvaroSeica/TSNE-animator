Beautiful Mixtape

[Ghostface Killah]
Don't get the flow mixed up, this is uncut raw
You can cook it in your spoon, that's what your lighter's for
And the aroma are set to move the right tone up
And your girl, I really wanna ice tone her
Don't get made of she like rappers
I'm be an MC who like Bergundy, and ?he man perty?
Look young in his face, and he over thirty
Giving out Hancocks, like my name was Herbie
Survived from a fucked up past, set my bed where the springs reside
Now they ask what my rings about
This is Ghost, God type man only, stay true
You disagree, well then fuck you
I don't gotta say jack to you
I got alot of metal that rat for you
And if I point it your way, he gon clap for you
Body something mad terrible, you know how them ratchets do
Extra caskets and church classics, blowing an ill dust joint
At your wake as I drive past it, now that's murder
2004 blood further dick, you ain't that big cus you ain't never heard of
Or brought up in any combo, Benny Blanco your style will get your face picked off
And your nose ripped off, you fake niggas don't understand
This is Theodore, we gon blow like a hundred fans

[Talib Kweli]
New York will test you, try to get you, don't be scared about it
It'll carress you and molest you, but don;t be weird about it
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve and dare to come here without it
You bout it, then let it flow out like tears of fear shouted
Ain't no kick the can, chutes and ladders and candyland
Mothers survive their sons, trying to be a family man
Out to there like hand to hand, walkers, bikers and camel stands
In order to tell my man for man, here, you need a manogram
Patrol, substance for nothing to blame the manners on
Up at the crack of dawn, heard the word and your path is on
Still working for nothing, abandon your dreams
Now they touting, torn to peices, headin on the ground that we walking on
Same ground around the body police took chalk upon
Your name on the radio familiar, police are talking on
Do what you gotta do to eat, and keep the heat from off the arms
Sometimes you gotta compromise what you don brought upon
The most exciting lyrics Kweli and Ghost is writing
Psychosis leading to excessive and hopeless biting
There's no denying your ho is eyeing, the flow is iron, the bottom of the sea
By the color of the pea, the muthafucking, most gutter MC
Dropped out of school at eighteen
With a dream and started running the streets
Keep the reciepts, don't need your college degree
Because my lyrics earm me honorary PHDs, yeah

[Chorus 2X: Talib Kweli]
People ask my why I keep it so hood
And I simply reply, it feels so good
We hit your ears in ways you ain't know the flow could
And make your momma say boy, you up to no good</pre>
