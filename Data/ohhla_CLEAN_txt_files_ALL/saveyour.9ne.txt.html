[Intro - Tech N9ne (Taken from S.H.E.)]
I got the idea to do this next one right after the S.H.E. shit happened
So my nigga Kaliko came through and blew this shit!
You might have heard it on our shows, it's a little skit called Save Yourself
All Kaliko, no backround singer or nothing, you know what I'm sizzlin
It was writen and produced by me, Krizz, and Icy Roc
It's called Save Yourself, check it out

[Big Krizz Kaliko]
You can't get my money hoe, you're scheming on my wealth
How about getting a j-o-b then you can save yourself
I don't know why these hoes are always in my face for money
Gran Rice, Kutt, and Tech N9ne said save yourself. Save yourself
Gran Rice, Kutt, and Tech N9ne said save yourself
(Applause)</pre>
