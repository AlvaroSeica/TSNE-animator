[Intro]
Dr. Greenthumb
Captain Planet with a Xanax
The Karl Strot of hip-hop
With birds like Hitchcock
Fuckin gas is too expensive man
Better send some more fuckin troops
Start a fuckin draft, {?} gas
Fucking barbecue, punch you in the grill

[GDP]
You can plant a garden, eat some calamari
And give the earth back to the jellyfish we started from
New Orleans, Haiti, Bahamas
Obama's mobster ass cigars in our garages
It's like Chuck D meets Charles Darwin
Spark it far from borrowin a parked Bentley orange
We sent waste into space for Martians
And pour a little oil out for my dead lobsters
Scientists gargle jargon about
how air got more led in there than oxygen
To a Congress that doesn't acknowledge
Cause they're in the wallets of monster conglomerates
Got bargained for carbon, forests beg our pardon
Waste enough garbage to feed the ones starvin
Bargain for carbon, greenhouse exhaustion
New-fangled energy vs. modern economics
.. you can almost smell the carcass
Bones growing weaker, heart pumping harder
Storms more often, summer's getting warmer
Geo molded toxins cockblock farmers
Went to the market to cop something processed
Every other product got a cancer ribbon on it
If a tree falls then there's no more forest
They'll measure regional climate using yardsticks
In a hybrid with a bitch getting carsick
Start it like George Carlin, I'm Johnny Carson
I told her, darlin, home is where the heart is
Nothing lasts forever, except water bottles
... water bottles
Bargain for carbon, million man marches
Hotheaded sergeants that call war progress
Praying men to kill with foreign objects
No big contract, oil drilling prospects
Want to leave but the borders are guarded
like mold in the wall of my apartment - catharsis
Now they're vaccinating kindergarteners
Tree farms and chemicals that wind up in our drinking water
Bargain for carbon
Conglomerates bargain for carbon
We're ruining the land we stole
But you don't feel responsible
You don't feel responsible
So let the next of kin pay our carbon toll</pre>
