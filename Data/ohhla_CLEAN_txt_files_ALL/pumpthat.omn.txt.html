Typed by: iamomni dot com

we make you say what
we make you say what
we make you say what

we make you say what
we make you say what
pump that music

we make you say what
we make you say what
we make you say what

we make you say what
we make you say what
pump that music

you got the bomb bomb diggi
you gotta get with me
uncover your kitty cat
when you gon' give me that
where all my ladies at
show me your tattoos
and show me your belly buttons
I'm saying
the way you move is trying to tell me something
come on
see your body moving
hypnotic
you got it baby
freakin' it well
yeah you're freakin' it well
slide to the side with me on the low and get high with me
I'll light your fire only if you let me inhale
do what you wanna
you wanna party so carry on
don't let nobody say you're nobody
you're number one
you keep it hot like a saturday in the summer sun
I wanna see those buttons undone

[Chorus]
come get fly
get high with me
keep your hands to the sky
and keep your eyes on me
I'mma kick it to your mind
'cause the blind gon' see
that we freakin' it well
we freakin' it well
and niggaz can't stop me
you can't top me
listen for the disc jockey
you can't cop me
we gon' take the party to the hotel lobby
'cause we freakin' it well
we freakin' it well

you're a freak
I can tell by the way you speak
and the way your ass left a dent in the seat
smoke a pound a chee out of mocha leaf with me overseas
with them aborigines
cali and tay
omni presidente
been originale since my first entr√©e
all up on the style
wanna bill with the sensei
bet they know me now
'cause I'm real and they feel me
ozzie holla back with a twenty dollar sack
pen and pad leaning on the tracks
dippin' on some jack
with the tag still on my hat
never hold me back
hold me down
yeah you owe me that
baby won't you show me that
whoa
how'd you get through that
whoa
you make me wanna pat my afro
and sing you a song that I wrote
then ??? how it go
if you can keep up with my flow
off to the hotel we go

[Chorus]

go dj go
go dj go
go dj go go go
go dj go
go dj go
go dj go go go

we make you say what
we make you say what
we make you say what

we make you say what
we make you say what
pump that music

we make you say what
we make you say what
we make you say what

we make you say what
we make you say what
pump that music</pre>
