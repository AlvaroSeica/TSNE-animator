Bay area, bay area... (repeat till frayser boy starts)

[Frayser Boy]
Allow me to introduce myself two tenty one seventy six
Busted out my mama's womb, the haters havin a fit
the birth of a frayser boy is now on the fuckin scene
raised in the Brier ain't too many things I ain't seen
bay is in my blood, I came up around them real niggaz
niggaz on the run, got feds watchin and takin pictures
hooked up wit them thugs thats hypnotizin yo' minds
good lookin out paul and juicy, now I'm back on this grind
ain't no stoppin this time, because the sky is the limit
And I'ma stay loyal to my dawgs, till the day that I finish
you know this race i'ma win it and much love to the bay
and all them niggaz I fucked wit then, I fuck wit today
so this yo' dawg comin at ya, so haters dont ya start
if you wit me you can catch me robbin frayser boulevard
gone on that bay, dont you play, this is where I'm gonna stay
found my home H.C.P. no longer a fuckin stray, dont play

Bay area, ain't love fo, fuck you hoes we down till we die(repeat x8)

[Lil' Wyte]
this the verse they gonna show you right off the wamb I throw them thumbs
h.c.p. w-y-t-e frayser B bay we be droppin bombs
watch-the-fuck-out, here we come(pop! pop! pop!)ya'll can't get none
all of a sudden this long haired green eyed faggot tryin to get him some
let me let ya in on a little bittty secret I could lyrically toast ya
plus I'm from the bay that explains my reactions like a vulture
quickly find ya, sniff ya out, now matter how far you mite be
strong aroma, pass is over, all the air the bay I breath
that got me places, call me crazy, somehow I done fuckin made it
so mo' in my verse weak then you did it 3 months I know you hate it
watch me rise up to the top because my hood has put me here
sometimes I feel some parts of the bay got its own atmosphere
haters, hustlas, rappers, real-ass-niggaz, rednecks, and fuckin queers
chokin doja, watchin po'po's ride by while they throw a beer
yeah its kind of hectic in my neck of the woods but respect it
life is so damn gravy in the bay for me you had to check it(BIITCH!)

(hook, with scratches, frayser boy giving shoutouts to the Bay)</pre>
