The ice cream man is co-miiiiiiiiiiing~!

[Intro: 8Ball]
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in yo' guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck, you know whassup

[Devius]
8:30 Monday morning on the courtesy flight
to my St. Louis bitch, she converted to dyke (f'real?)
No luggage, shorty told me I could shop when I land
All expense paid trip, she my #1 fan
Good sex 'til the sunrise, her friend joined in
Hump day, Wednesday afternoon, I'm back in the wind
Touched down, L-A-X, this my West coast thang
Bitch family got money, daddy gave her the Range
Two story condo, overlookin the beach
Gave me head in the window they can see from the streets
Gucci frame matched the loafers on the pedal of the Rover
Dropped me off, kissed my cheek, said she wanna do it over
Friday night, thick yellow in the lobby at the hobby
My H-Town piece, 19 with plenty body
Escalade seats caressin that pretty frame
It's a shame, that a handful of cats can play the game

[Chorus: 8Ball]
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in yo' guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck, you know whassup
Ice, cream (oh) ice, cream (oh)
My bitch is wet like ice, cream
Ice, cream (oh) ice, cream (oh)
My bitches taste like ice, cream~!

[8Ball]
Oooh what a pretty pussycat that I'm lookin at
Dime with a diamond stud where her bellybutton at
Wow, make me wanna hit it right now
Do that thang she like and have her screamin out loud
Like Percy Miller pimp I keep it 'bout it 'bout
Club lookin like, Black Girls Gone Wild
Earnin, we tucked in the corner just burnin
Do a little tippin but a nigga never splurgin
Grabbin up steel like a muh'fuckin surgeon
Met a bunch of bitches but I never met a virgin
Mouth superior, girl I'm doin ya
Might get your Gucci like my old school interior
All your friends hate me, say they wouldn't date me
Still had a threesome when I got 'em on that ecstasy
I won't tell, if you won't tell
And we can do it like both of y'all my girls

[Chorus]

[unidentified woman]
Damn nigga what'chu doin?
Oh so you just gon' take my panties off?
What'chu doin down there?
Ahh I see what'chu doin
Mmmm...
That's the spot... yes... oooh...
{*moaning until chorus comes back in and through it*}

[Chorus]

[unidentified woman]
Oooh yeah baby
Oooh God damn
