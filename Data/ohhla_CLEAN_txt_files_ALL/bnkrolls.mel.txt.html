[Intro]
Man one day I'm get there
I'm be countin these bank rolls, nigga
(Right man, we gon' be gettin all the dank 'dro, rollin up)
Man, I'ma be fuck with a model bitch, no stank hoe
(For sho' man, we gon' be countin all the bank rolls)
All the bank rolls!
Hodgy... Beats, Left Brain
MellowHype uhh
Odd Future... uhh

[Hodgy Beats]
First one up, yup, good mornin
I'm already out the door by the time you were yawnin
Head start for the green mow lawnin
Prolongin in the game, sing-a-longin
Bounce if you like, come on bob yo' head
Obey every single word that Simon said
Blood diamond flow, it's shinin red
What's up with your hip-hop? Mine is dead
Wolf Gang bred, cook 'caine bread
If they ain't associated, I don't shake they hand
Pretty-ass nigga with a girl from Japan
She don't speak any English but she understand
So in demand, I'm him the man
The music plants the cash in hand
I can't be concentrated on what the press might hear
I buzzed in less than a light year; how did I arrive?

[Chorus: Left Brain]
What the fuck you thank, yo? I be smokin dank dro
You be fuckin stank hoes, I be countin bank rolls
I be countin bank rolls, I be countin bank rolls
Fuck you nigga, I be countin bank rolls
To the bank every week
Y'all already know, I fuck with the freaks
I be countin bank rolls, I be countin bank rolls
Fuck you nigga, I be countin bank rolls

[Hodgy Beats]
You know it's Odd when I come through your area
cause you scared of a monster, tell your uncle I'm scarin ya
Workin on my form, MellowHype bury ya
626 on your local carrier
Nothing's set in stone until the stones are set
I - plot and break a sweat until my bones are wet
You want me to give like there's nothing to get
But there's nothing to get, just music to share
We've got music to spare like it's musical chairs
Beats are the truth and lyrics take dares
And I'm comin after whoever want it
And I swing for the fence nigga don't pitch
Home Run Derby, I don't miss
Then I go home, eat beans scrumptious
MellowHype is better than the rest
Better than the next, yeah, better than the best

[Chorus]

[Hodgy Beats]
I be countin bank rolls, I be countin green
Count so much money, need a paper machine
I be countin money, I be countin paper
I be countin bank rolls, I be countin bank rolls
I be countin money, I be countin paper
I be countin bank rolls, I be countin bank rolls
I be countin money, I be countin paper
I be countin bank rolls, I be countin bank rolls

[Chorus]</pre>
