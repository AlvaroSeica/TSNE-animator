[Intro]
You in trouble
Baby, you in trouble
And you gonna get it
Open up your eyes
Come here, you're gonna get it

[Verse 1]
Baby come in here, lay right there
Gonna touch your body everywhere
You rolling and shaking baby, I like that
Telling me to go harder with your legs in the air

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, right now girl it's about you, oh
You yeah, I'm going down, down baby on you, oh
I'm a do it here, I'm a do it there
I'm a do it like this, I'm a do it like that
Baby this is how it's gonna go go go
When, when we make love
I'm a go fast, I'm a go slow
I'm a go so hard girl you gon' say 'oooh'
Baby this is how it's gonna go go go go
When we make love

[Chorus]
Baby I know you're ready, ready
Because you're about to get it
Like you in trouble
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble
Girl, I hope you know that, know that
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble

[Verse 2]
I'm a give it to you like oh my God
Tell me how you want it I'm a do it all
If you wanna release baby Ill fight that there
It's gon feel so good you gon pull your own hair

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, right now girl it's about you, oh
You yeah, I'm going down, down baby on you, oh
I'm a do it here, I'm a do it there
I'm a do it like this, I'm a do it like that
Baby this is how it's gonna go go go
When, when we make love
I'm a go fast, I'm a go slow
I'm a go so hard girl you gon' say 'oooh'
Baby this is how it's gonna go go go go
When we make love

[Chorus]
Baby I know you're ready, ready
Because you're about to get it
Like you in trouble
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble
Girl, I hope you know that, know that
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble

[Verse 3]
Uh yea, like the board games
Tellin me stories how all the exes are lame
Well I'm quite different
For practice, I throw you on the mattress
Then we can make a movie and it don't involve actin
Rather see the streak when that boy go deep
Dick like Tylenol RPM, it puts the hoes to sleep
And where your man slip up
That's where I pick up
Bitch niggaz ignore me just like hiccups
Turn between your legs, eyes rollin back in yo head
We done soaked up all the sheets, fucked up your best bread
Girl you nasty, just so you know
Right back at em again, it's bad when oh you know
YMCMB MMG, word!

[Chorus]
Baby I know you're ready, ready
Because you're about to get it
Like you in trouble
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble
Girl, I hope you know that, know that
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble
You're about to get it
Like you in trouble</pre>
