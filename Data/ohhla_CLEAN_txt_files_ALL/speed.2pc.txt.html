High Speed
For all my niggaz livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright

[2Pac + E.D.I Amin] 
Life at High Speed
Fuck the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time

[2Pac]
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, harm me
My army, niggaz decease swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna hack out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb all lessons, provide protection for the boss 
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, we crooked, be mistaken for Jews
We all about our cash, blast if you break the rules
Fools turned snitch for the D.A., be heaven-sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned state's evidence, why?
Then they wonder why niggaz die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime trade, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and thai weed
Puffin' through this High Speed
And people say

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[Yaki Kadafi]
Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
Hot plastic stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to split ya
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's softer than tissue
I ride by like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Pepper shots pourin'
Catchin' niggaz while they snorin'
Kickin' his door in
I'll leave your whole fuckin' family in mourning
Bust me, you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like you're hard
I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[E.D.I Amin]
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on passin', pushin' me into danger
No stranger to hard times or the good ones
At times I'm amazed
At what the motherfuckin' hood done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
Niggaz is dying tommorrow
We, bet on all time
Nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you gonna need money or glocks spittin'
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't know what
Soon that money gon' be illegal when you die to
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like ya'll, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Lets get blowed out High Speed til the end of my dayz
Now my people say

[Chorus: 2Pac - repeat 5X]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[2Pac]
