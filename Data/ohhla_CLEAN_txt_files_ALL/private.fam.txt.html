[Chorus 2X: Crunch Lo]
It's like, all is trouble, smoking bones in huddles
Reality hits and now I'm all about this hustle
It's real, in this game, either life or death
Keep me vexed, niggas like me, we all stressed

[Crunch Lo]
Aiyo, baked out my mind and it's 3 in the AM
Sitting in my rest, thinking bout today's mayhem
Jake on some shit, wanna pat me down
Fucking up our whole mood, making the hot come down
The fiends was fighting and my mans got hit last night
Not my day, couldn't even get the whole rolled right
I'm up tight and my prayers pain like migraines
Projects a mess got my whole clique stressed
Beans wit bitches and bitches and blunts blowing up
All fucked up, so now I lounge in the cut
Result of hatred until I make it
And if I don't get what I want, then I'mma have to take it
Body B then fits for lands of misfits
Rather stay on point and keep the gat to a full clip
And strong mind for chicks who try to play the tricks
Hit 'em wit the dick and then I bounce real quick
Up the ave and my winds are blowing
But still be feeling leery in the middle of broad day
Cuz niggas busting, baby's mother is steady cussing me out
This shit is strange, I need a bone to my mouth

[Lounge Lo]
Private sessions, got me meditating through my lessons
Meditating Killah Hill jack's slang perfecting
Niggas try to poly and grease, and Molly like cards
Pap sack, 20 guns coming with my squad
I got a lesson on the Isle, profile to act wild
But they child, the food of my thought, does the mile
But who wanna be thug, who wanna bug
Talking bout this real life, real drama, never bust a real slug
What's happening here, it be the interlude rapping yea
Hard rocks get five shots, step into my square
If you dare enter, infered got your centered
Bent out your tile, who gives a fuck about your mental
It's a problem, my .38 snub done revolved them
This continued, Othorized on this venue
Twenty thousand, with my crew from the Housing
Staten Island, Angelow, Loungin' Loungin'
That's the wild style that I brought with my talk
And my names just walk, and rep Shaolin, New York
Who's the Riddick Bowe, who had a poke on my flow
I jelly from the 1-6-Oh, and shotties blow
I beg ya pardon, this the Hill, not the Garden
From the fruit of G street, niggas is well known for starting

[Chorus]

[Crunch Lo]
R.I.P. Ron Due, to my man, B.D.
Two Cent, Pioneer and K-A-S to the E
Stay fly, and I'm still trynna stay alive
In these projects, the shorty's pack the tech
But all in all, I refuse to take fall
Survive like a trooper with my back on the wall
Stand tall with my eyes open, scoping for drama
Stop cats in they tracks like a comma
Two a sentence, for ever representing
Some snakes in my face always hissing and talking
But niggas still stalking through my home, looking for
This stint, but I stash the chrome, 45
If another of my man dies, it'll bug the hell out of me
Holding a dream and we can all live lovely
You know the situation and the life we live
At any given time, something has to give

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
