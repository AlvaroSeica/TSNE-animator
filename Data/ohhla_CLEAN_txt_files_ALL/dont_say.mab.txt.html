[Hook: Peaches]
Don't say no, before you know me
Lay your body, on my body
Until you insist, on being lonely
Just don't say no, before you know me

[Trae]
Now tell a nigga what's the deal
I know you still be peeping a G already wanna see if he be ready for me
Wonder if I'm thug for life now baby get it right
I really wanna chill tonight and I ain't taking a wife
I ain't thinking of conversating I wanna be penetrating
and run a massage to make a nigga be feeling good
It ain't gotta be no all over the place
but when you see me in the street go on shoot me the fuck face
I'm a ghetto superstar and I'm a national playa
so when your partnas running up then I be knocking 'em down
I'm thinking about getting laid in the back of the Navigator
and it's really good that I'm sticking around
And let your seat recline and meditate for a second
then another 45 I'll be on top of you wrecking
And I ain't wanna leave you soft, but that's the way it'll go
I got a meeting with the click so you better get gone, and I gotta go

[Hook]

[Dougie D]
I think you wanna let me slide on in
your body is hella-fied and I wanna see what love is
With your sensual lips and curvey hips and beautiful skin
you got me thinking bout committing a sin
Me and my baby two deep in the wind
I'll let you push the six, after you pack the ten
A lil' while later I'll be beating it up again
and we lay down chest to breast from hot sex that we about to begin
I know you love that girl, the way a nigga be pumping
and hitting it from side to side, as I caress your thighs
I got you up on cloud nine
as I tell you to throw it back, when I hit it from behind
Don't be shy now kiss it for daddy in a long black Caddy
as we floss up on the freeway
It's the same thang tomorrow whenever you feeling horny and freaky
baby do me a favor and call me

[Peaches]
You don't seem so dangerous, when it's just the two of us
Not your thugged out friends with us, and no messy hoes with us
Got a piece that's ready to bust, when it's time we'll do your crunch
When it's crime who do you trust, when it's mine now it's us
What's going down, what's going down-what's going down
When you coming around, what's taking so long are you coming
No one has to know, no one has to know no-no-no
Keep it on the low, we can keep it on the low oh yeah

[Hook]
