Intro:

ah yeah, Dream Warriors
as we enter the brink of reality
battlfield
trust me seven times seven times
but you prefer not to
here I go into a lifelong trip
are you ready for this?
come solider


Verse 1:

ringin' on into his disorder
I serve the square
so step there's nothing left you can't compare
to the noble unbeatable length of hair that I bare
so bare witness I'm physically fittin' this
a desease so MC's please take a techna shot
you got what I give I never get got
glue to the gift so what's up dread
you couldn't bob to the bass but now you're hooked like a bass head
I'm about to show ya contract and attract ya
blow off track come back and smack ya
loaded lyrics stronger than a game of tug-o-war
Dream Warriors are built right cause I got a megabyte of storage
so don't tempt me I'm empty
don't get too close I might absorb your energy
if you're not a friend of me I grow you like cannibus
make you give me a hand you can't handle this
crazy rampagous makin' team ages
walk through the getto with getto blasters playin' us
general entrance be part of the solution
you take it to your brain but your brain is confused
and confusion is the style that I send
don't think it makes your mind bend
just journey on


Chorus:

draw your mics men
and wipe the sweat from your dome
as we enter this battle with a fearsome rage
universal peace must be this outcome
dust and strife stricken
we have moral to the full
board your steeds my minions as we path on
tray me I slay the no mutiny


Verse 2:

take a picture of this 
you trying to dis
so much smoke you get choked from the microphone mist
aw shucks you're outta lucks
yo try to tax but get waxed
the song strong enough to carry you
and my rhymes strong enough to bury you
but I don't I make you jam until the jam is done
until the cash is cahsed unto me the nickelodeon
like that snap ??? back the style has hung you
buy a noose produce who
now this is the part 
mystics prevail
the critics wrong song goes up in a sail
the legacy begins check the store
you want more then tie up your boots and just journey on
pankgooes and scallowags vanish
MCs who talk about me vanish
when I'm on stage I'm kicking harder than a tidal wave
I'm making bootys like you memory save
cause when I entre pronto en delay
I hear on the dispatch
(mayday mayday)
an S.O.S. for a new bag of sess
and kick and shook you into nothing less
proceed on


Verse 3:

on your 12th daydream you try your best to control it
but the magic avoids you the stage is a street
and the wink of an eye you could fry in agony of defeat
now toothles ruthless and raw
looking for a way to get even but you withdraw
cause with no label you're disabled and handicapped
but you pledge allegiance to the life of battle rap
no choice now you must face your own fate
no straight path so is life nothing is straight
maybe one day you'll wake up and realize
you the live by the sword you die by the sword
suprise Dream Warrirors posseses intelligance
but you cry wolf but that's irrelivant
no what you must be now is simply
sit back and rock in your own inequity
city's the limit from when you finish your song
now you journey too but what you really must do is journey on

Outro:
we must change
we must change
we must change</pre>
