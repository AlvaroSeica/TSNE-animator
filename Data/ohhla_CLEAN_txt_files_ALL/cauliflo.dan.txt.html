Fell in love with a boy from the city

I fell in love with a girl from the city
Still got cauliflower ears from when her voice first hit me
And a swollen lip, from when her lyrics first kissed me
As I went to pull away ever so gently bit me

Within those three days it gets no better
We were inseparable; no-one could seper-
-rate us make us question our status
It was like someone, somehow found a way to syncopate us

And it'll stay that way forever, in my mind that is
Coz it was a stolen three days and a stolen kiss
And although those three days I sorely miss
I own those three days when I write like this

I fell in love with a girl from the city

You're all I want, you're all I need
You are the one for me
You hold me close, you hold me near
You are the one for me
The pain I feel when you leave
You are the one for me
You're all I want and all I see
You are the one for me

Fell in love with a boy from the city

I fell in love with a girl from the city
Still got cauliflower ears from when her voice first hit me
And a swollen lip, from when her lyrics first kissed me
And when I went to pull back ever so gently bit me

I still hear her sometimes but it's not the same
Like when you get a pen and paper and write your name
Over and over and over again
Although it hasn't, in the end it somehow seems to change

But I feel right now I must stress
That I write this with a smile on my face and nothing less
Coz when I think about the times we waste on regrets
I realise for those three days I was blessed

I fell in love with a girl from the city</pre>
