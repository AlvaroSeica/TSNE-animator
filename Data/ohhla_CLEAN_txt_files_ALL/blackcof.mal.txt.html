Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, ah-ha-ha-ha
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, ah-ha-ha-ha

[ Styliztik Jones ]
At 12 o'clock on the dot with a cup of Joe
Because my nightmares and day dreams won't let me doze
See the souls of the slaves when my eyes are closed
I can't sleep around here, my pride is strong
On the stove is a pot of some freshly brewed
I'm fed up cause the feds, they won't let me move
Not amused by the views of the nightly news
And although it's hard to watch I'm slightly glued
To the television tube, it's the dummy box
Flippin channels tryina see what the dummies watch
Sippin java, thinkin what they done to Pac
I'm on a caffeine high and my gun is cocked
I'm gettin death threats, the next step they brung the cops
I'm tryina express I'm cool, except my tongue is hot
Anybody round my momma and the gun'll pop
I'm gettin paranoid, now all the fun can stop
I know you wanna see me hung or decapitated
Puttin kids in jail before they even graduated
I coulda been dead but you see we gladly made it
So I'm up all night on that decaffeinated

Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, ah-ha-ha-ha
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, ah-ha-ha-ha

The blacker the coffee, the deeper the mind that taught me
Cause most of y'all seem lost like car keys
This is a rare breed, we raw like sardines
The marquee reads what the march mean
We sick on the mic, niggas swear we swallowed too much chlorine
My legacy is somethin that's foreseen
I can give a fuck less if I'm never heard on the mainstream
I'm doin me and that's the main thing
You can give me all the money in the world, it still won't change me
I still be pissed and angry
And mad at the world cause the man tryina physically hang me
With the same noose on the same tree
Mainly I shoot for the stars, if I miss don't blame me
You softer than a muffin, please pass the pastry
And y'all can go head and daydream
It's Malcolm and Martin, we the newest version of the A-Team

Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, ah-ha-ha-ha
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, ah-ha-ha-ha

No mocca latte sugar-coatin the facts
My coffee like my skin, friend, both are black
To change we doin ten, we don't hope for that
No Sweet'N Low in my Joe, we don't go for that
No no, just a mug that's full of black Folgers
The truck pulled up all full of black soldiers
Say we takin over, say you shall exhort me
Niggas better wake up and smell the black coffee
[ KB iMean ]
I got a scheme that's as clean as a coffee bean
Walk with a awkward lean since Dr. King marched with a dream
Believe in that, my jeans is black
Just like the clouds that try to impede my path
Black sheep of the fam but I don't eat grass
I black out every time I see the police pass
So pass me a black cup and fill it to the top
Take a sip of the truth, the movement is all us

(Listen sucker
I'm blacker than a ace of spades
and more militant than you and your whole damn army put together
And while you're out there chantin at rallies and brow-beating politicians
I'm taking out any money-fronting sucker on a humble that gets in my way
So I tell you what
When your so-called revolution starts you call me
And I be right down outfront showing you how it's done
but until then you need to shut the fuck up when grown folks is talking)</pre>
