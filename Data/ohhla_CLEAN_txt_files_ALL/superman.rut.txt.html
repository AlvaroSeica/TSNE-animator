[Intro: Truck]
Oh, shit, fuck, up in the sky
It's a plane? No, it's a bird

[Chorus 2X: Truck]
Yo, you ain't Superman, nigga, you can't fly
If you, catch the slug, you gon' die
Where all my real niggas, that's ready to ride
We gon' ride.......

[Iron Mic]
It's Iron Mic, you claim you the best, I got to come atcha
Everybody's a thug, everybody's a rapper
Personally I care less, you a punk when ya gat bust
We got drama, nigga, when it comes to this rap stuff
So click clack up, nigga, and come with ya gats up
The four-fifth'll prove that the nigga ain't that tough
We ain't no click, we ain't no gang
It's Ruthless Bastardz, our guns go bang bang
It's Iron, muthafuck, you know my name
Come at me, I'm coming back, like a boomerang
Your niggas ain't thug, they more like Pootie-Tang
You wanna rap, let me show you how to do the thing
It's real life, this ain't no movie, man
We spit uzi's, your shit when toolie hangs
Before rap, I was creeping with the mask and the glove
We held it down for a minute, damn, where's the love?
Fuck it, my nigga, where's the drugs?
Where's the guns, where's the slugs, where all my thugs?
That'll, grab the snub and put it in your mug
Mob style, burn his ass up in the rug
I'm God's child, we buckwild, heaven, I need a hug
And fuck you to all those who didn't believe in us
See I don't speak much, I let the heat discuss
And sort out all my problems if you beef with you
Like Sunday dinner, only fam eat with us
We don't trick on these hoes, for them to sleep with us
We get 'em, weeded up, and just beat it up
You Stevie Wonder rap niggas ain't seeing us
And all you gotta do is holla, if you wanna scrap
A hundred shot calico's, keep ten in a mac
You know a Pac ain't taking a wrap, til them jakes pull us over
You know they catching a cap
We Ruthless, nigga, we don't run the cops
Word to my pops, word to Sandy Brock
Drag his ass to the Ferry, throw him over the dock
I got a thousand more bars, you lucky this beat stopped, nigga

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
