Uh, Rasaq on the block

[Hook- Rasaq]
Catch me where them ballas be
Dranks in the air for all to see
Ever since a youngin in poverty
It's hard to be
A nigga like me
But y'all gonna see
All I need is god wit me
And my squad wit me
Who come as hard as we

[Verse One- Rasaq]
Not a damn click, nigga we so damn sick
Don't get me and cham pissed
The thing in the hand kicks
Like a horse in a panic
Got damnit, they told me not say it
But I had a chip on my shoulder like dandfruff
And they said my niggaz don't come real enough
But I don't gotta symphyse my life, god built me tough
And trust me nigga, I got steel that'll bust
Maybe you can feel that, if you ain't feelin' us
But if you feel like you real, and you feel like I feel
Then all we show is love, when you dealin' wit us
Holla at me nigga, I got millions to touch
I got a adrenaline rush, to stack paper till the cealin' is touched
I'll poor ya hipnotic, till they spill in the cup
Cuz hypnotize by the wheel on the truck
Hit they head, leave 'em strung outta luck
Without feelin' a buck, they tounge still out from feelin' my nuts
Leave 'em mill in the dust
My click is gon stay on top, and I can feel it in my gut
We know we the shit, you just feel it in ya butt

[Hook- Rasaq]
Catch me where them ballas be
Dranks in the air for all to see
Ever since a young in poverty
It's hard to be
A nigga like me
But y'all gonna see
All I need is god wit me
And my squad wit me
Who come as hard as we</pre>
