Let me see you clap feet and stomp your fingers
'bout as much as you're neglecting what your mama teached you
if you crunk then walk in Church and throw a rock a preacher
pray somebody in the congregation stop that Negro
evil  evil
we do need you now to regulate the goodness of these Christian peoples
'cause they're listening to scriptures and then believe them
and they only think of Jesus when they really need Him; out this state
I'm long gone
I don't care at all
keep my attitude as funky as my only set of drawers
on stinking like a flowerbed but ya'll can't fade me
you're leaving by the hour said the doctor's statement
yep! Statistics show most anybody living with disease
that's found to kill them is as hollow as a phone pole
holla at some grown folks
they won't tell you 'bout the Bible and the whole world 'cause faith gon' fail you...

Follow what's popular
copy what's in
everybody's doing it
so
I think I can. Shawty
what's popular
shawty
what's in
everybody does it and it's like a new dance
so
gone 'head
hey
do it anyway 'cause no matter what we do
it's gonna happen anyway. Oh yeah
and everybody knows that if dying weren't an option
it'll probably be chosen...

Well
it's a hop
skip
and jump 'round the corner to hell
so
if you riding
hope you find a spot before it swell
'cause people Amtrak ain't got near 'nough room
to ship a growing population to the Center of Doom
the quicker we move
the sooner we could all rest easy knowing everybody's burning till we all black people
evil  evil
where you be at? The government is using money where we need it
caring less about a homeless mother and her three kids
a death is not a problem to the government; Hot water
I done touched a cord
and by the music I be hanging like a bungee cord
to watch the whole world fall like a junkie's drawers
in the middle of the winter
a Christian and a sinner tells you holla at some old folks
they're gone swear that if you're not a Church goer
you are satan's helper...

Toss a lit match in a bucket full of gasoline
and burn a flag if the blast ain't a massive scene
wear a KKK robe happily inside an NAACP gathering
and pull a drive-by through a nursing home estate because the might die
you could do them all a favor
draw and ending in their lifeline
since all these elementary criminals think they're God now
bet if the whole world jumped off a bridge you would probably do it
dip a pack of cigarettes in embalming fluid
go on and do it
kids only imitate things that may seem like a party when it's killing their dreams
so bleed if you positive for H.I.V.
OD on a product that you cannot read and swallow till you don't choke
ain't no air 'cause there's a lot of space open for graves to bury...
