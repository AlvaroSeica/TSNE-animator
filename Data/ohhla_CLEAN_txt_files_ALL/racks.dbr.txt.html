[Da Brat]
If you ain't talkin racks, we ain't talkin back
If you ain't talkin stacks, what the fuck I'ma do with that?
If you ain't talkin racks, we ain't talkin back
You know me I'm about my money (what'cho name is) Brat-Tat-Tat
I got a So So sickening flow, six-oh-six-fo'-fo'
Tryin to get to my crib, Westside Chicago (there it go)
Atlanta where I live, nigga got mo' than one residence
I'm the undertaker, for them dead Presidents
I gave 'em two and a half, I been behind that fence
Threw on an ankle monitor, on parole, then probation seven mo' years
I ain't got no mo' piss for 'em, my fear gone
Strong, 'bout to show 'em how the fuck I come home
Jumpin on e'rything I can get on, spit on
Gettin down and dirty well I'm bound to get my grit on
Bottle hustle hard, 'bout to buy two, three mo' cars
Grand open my club, let me empty out the whole bar
The next stop is Magic (yup) City we stop traffic
Police escort we got it, gone I'm showin out and I'm laughin
Some faces lookin shitty, cause they can't do what we do (never)
I'ma make it, make it, rain, for me and you
Have you ever seen a lady, who stacks the hundred dollar bills?
Better get'chu an umbrella, I'm floodin it up in here
If you ain't talkin racks, we ain't talkin back
If you ain't talkin stacks, what the fuck I'ma do with that?
If you ain't talkin racks, we ain't talkin back
You know me I'm about my money (what'cho name is) Brat-Tat-Tat</pre>
