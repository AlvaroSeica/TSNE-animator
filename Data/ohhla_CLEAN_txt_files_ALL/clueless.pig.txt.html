[Intro] [Pigeon John talking]
I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I know-know that, I know that
I give up. Forget it. Now known as the once unknown way
Look at me dancing. Now known as the once unknown way
Look at me dancing

[Chorus]
Whether I'm coolin' in Hawthorne or in the South Bay
Huntington Beach or Costa Mae
Out in Whittier, east or west L.A.
Now known is the once unknown way

I'm clueless [4x]

[Verse One]
Now is the time and time is now
Go through situations and wonder how
In the world is this thing gonna work on out
When I'm filled with frustration with brings forth a shout or
Tears packed in by years of memories and heartaches
They roll down now with no breaks
I do not see an answer to my quest
No light in the tunnel makes me fumble all the rest of my
Sanity, now I've poured all I have 
And doubt and anxiety begin to take there path
To destroy my whole view and direct me
On a fear driven road to a lost society
Where trust is unheard of 
Life is absurd
And vision itself is blind to what will occur
That's the slow suffocation
Calm death of life 
And planned assassination of faith with a knife

[Chorus]
Whether I'm coolin' in Hawthorne or in the South Bay
Huntington Beach or Costa Mae
Out in Whittier, east or west L.A.
Now known is the once unknown way

I'm clueless [4x]

I do not know what going to happen next
State of mind is drenched with sweat of stay fresh
The choice is mine 
Worry or recline
With Kool-Aid in hand knowing all will come in time
But-but-but-but my mind 
Begins to spin
Sending waves of confusion to erode the state I'm in
So I cry out loud past the clouds
And surrounding mountains casting my shroud
Cause the God that I serve never let's me down
He supplies all that I need, so why should I frown
My life's His for the changing
Replacing
Things rearranging 
Brings true victory
Joy unexplained
Real through the pain cause it last and remains
Hallelu, I've not a clue
Of what precedes but I'm in the hands of John Sitilu
And that's enough to abolish all hindrances
Naked and butt free, showing what we live
And I'm holding back I know I've got a lot to give
Yet, I still don't know is that positive?

Whether I'm coolin' in Haw...
wait, wait, ok, ok

[Chorus]
Whether I'm coolin' in Hawthorne or in the South Bay
Huntington Beach or Costa Mae
Out in Whittier, east or west L.A.
Now known is the once unknown way

I'm clueless [4x]

[Verse Three]
The first time my crew split in '95
I was broke at the same time so alive
And I wrote this little song in order to survive
Trying to find out the seeds in my pie
Cause they feeling like a big plank in my eye
Are they here to hold back or to multiply
And this nags like a bug but I know to hug
The most complex question with a shrug

[Chorus]
Cooling in Hawthorne or in the South Bay
Huntington Beach or Costa Mae
Out in Whittier, east or west L.A.
Now known is the once unknown way

I'm clueless [4x]</pre>
