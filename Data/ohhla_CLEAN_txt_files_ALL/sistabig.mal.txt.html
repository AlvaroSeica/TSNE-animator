- Hey pardon me, sista
- Ugh, is you walkin?
- I'm sorry, didn't I see you at the African Festival last weekend?
- The fuckin African Festival?
  Hell no nigga, you look like you was there, though
  What the fuck you doin over here with me?
  Comin over here sweatin and shit, you need to take that rag
  What's that - Kunta Kinte cloth - some shit like that
  Wipe your face off because you look like you hot from walkin the -
  Where's your car at anyway?
  I know you ain't tryin to step to me

Sista Big Butt

[ KB iMean ]
Astonishing obvious how big your bottom is
You ain't gotta wear them jeans, you comin out of 'em
And that's a double meaning, if you don't love him, leave him
He don't care, he just mad cause the bubble leavin
The train left, you went to college for another reason
But now you payin for it, dancin only on the weekends
But you ain't trippin cause God gave you the gift
To shake what your mama gave ya, and make tips
Now we all lookin down like, "What happened to sis?"
She got a bad misconception of what happiness is
She still puttin on a g-string, ambition dyin
And she can't really see things, her eyes gettin tired
And she don't wanna be a lawyer no more
She content with makin her ass drop to the floor
Now Sista Big Butt ain't a catch no more
But she caught somethin from lettin 'em go in her raw
Yeah

Who do you think you are
Sista Big Butt
Never gonna get in my car
Sista Big Butt
Who do you think you are
Sista Big Butt
Never gonna be a star
Big Butt

[ Styliztik Jones ]
Most beautiful baby with the gluteus
Your booty is rotund but we don't need none of your bouginess
I only tell you hi, you reply the moodiest
I know you have a problem, I can tell you what it truly is
(Big Butt) A big butt but you're truly that blind
Thinkin that the whole world is gon' revolve around your backside
Talkin super crazy, really baby, you ain't that fine
Sayin you don't need a man, here you go with that lie
Couple months pass and you're pregnant by that guy
Now your butt get bigger but your belly wasn't that wide
Thickness turned to fatness and your titties turned to flab
Now you ain't attractive to your little baby' dad
He leavin you alone cause he headed for the next chick
Some girl with a bigger butt that he can go have sex with
Why you was in love, because that brother had a Lexus?
You was just another slut with butt that he slept with
You said that you didn't need a man, then that's when he exit
( ? ) but yo new baby stressin

Who do you think you are
Sista Big Butt
You're never gonna get too far
Sista Big Butt
Look at you, you think you got it goin on
Sista Big Butt
Somebody must've told you wrong
