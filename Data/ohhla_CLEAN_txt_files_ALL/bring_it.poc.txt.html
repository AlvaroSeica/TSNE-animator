[Verse 1: Mr. Shadow]
I split the blunt down the middle, throw away the brown shit
Replace it with mean green, roll it up and take a hit
And you bitch-made fools
Homey, there's no excuse
So stay down, so stay one
You learn from your roots
From the steel toe boots
Hush Puppies and Chuck Taylors
Smugglin' pounds of shit across the border, can't nobody tell us
A damn thang, we bang, slang and clang
Huh
It ain't true that we're all in the same gang (Aw hell naw)
Hey, hey
Who got the yay
Who got the weed
Who got the shit that'll make your motherfuckin' brain bleed?
Me
Nino B, maniac and tricky
Got some bomb weed, now the situation sticky
Hit me on the cellphone
I'm out grindin'
Lettin' the chain swing in the wind when I'm grimin'
You're runnin' out of time
Fuck
Nickles and dimes
It's P's and K's when we come across the borderline

Chorus:
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] I heard a rumor going 'round
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] It's the Mr. Shadow, Nino Brown
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] We cock back when we strap
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Stick 'em with them gangstafied raps
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] I heard a rumor going 'round
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] It's the Mr. Shadow, Nino Brown
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] We drop the bomba, que onda?
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Sick 'em like some Pit's, fool, we sick, huh!

(Verse 2)
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Lil' bitches start to hatin'
             From the S.D. to the big Los, the great collaboration
             Anticipation
             Throughout the great brown nation
             Lurkin' in the shadows, it's the Mr., motherfucker
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] We stack fast bucks and mack ducks
             Step on wack ducks with blue chucks and nunchucks
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Criminals slash rap subliminal
             ASCAP, booty ass crack, sorry sap
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] See this my motherfuckin' hale
             Mr. Bri-down, creepin' through the fog with my dog

[Nino Brown] Mr. Shadow be my perro
             Bout to blow this muh'fucker up, pucker up
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] And duck quick

             Dedicated to them haters in the calle
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Step back

             Threw that muh'fucker out the window

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Mr. Shadow] You can catch me and Nino
             Walkin' in casinos
             Drinkin' expensive wine and spendin' stacks of C-notes
             You see, hoe?
             That's how we pimp playas do
             Takin' over the game, everyday, actin' a fool
             We make news with the shit that we do
             Crack you and your boys with a 4" by 2"
             You motherfuckers, what?
             We on top of the list
             Don't get mad
             If you can't handle it, then hoe
             Call your dad (Daddy)
[Nino Brown] Bring it on
             Don't get it twisted
             I know you listed
             Mas chingones matones
             We pay a visit
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Catch your ass in a deep sleep
             When we creep and we crawl, gang-bangin', then we ball (Homie)
[Mr. Shadow] Bring it on
[Nino Brown] Infiltrate the game, fuck the fame
             Nino rearrange your whole mente, sippin' Presidente
             Respecto, respect the flow
             N-I-N-O
             Mr. Shadow
             Bring it on, you muh'fucker (What)
