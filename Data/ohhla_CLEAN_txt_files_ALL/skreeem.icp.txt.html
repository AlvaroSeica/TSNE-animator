[Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; Violent J]
SO WE GO phantom lungs
Southwest strangla here he come's
And I'm the duke here to rock the place
Crack a faygo &amp; sock your face
Let's run to the graveyard quick, fast
Dig up a body &amp; kick it's ass
Live life like some kind of dream
That your face get off &amp; SKREEEM!!!
Psychopathic, luni bad shit
Off with your head when I swing my hatchet
Once it's gone you can't reattach it
Volleyball it, toss &amp; catch it
One of my nutbag itch, I scratch it
Your soul, right out your throat I snatch it
Juggalo love can nothing match it
Blew out my mattress fucking fat chicks
You never been cute bitch scrub life
Till' my dick shoot goob on your dumb wife
When the hate on my group I become hype
Stab your belly in a suit with one knife
Deep in my head pressure rises
But we love being who the world despises
(AHHHHH!)
And that's a just a taste
Inhale it bust one nut out on your face

[Chorus]
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
What the fuck like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
Busting up like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!

Up &amp; up like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
They can't stand me but can't command me

[Hopsin]
Hey bitch hopsin's here
Stick your tongue when my cock is near
I ain't about shit but a lot of nonsense yeah
I'm a asshole hoe &amp; I'm not sincere
Come sit on my lap your a hot mess dear
Your face kind of ripples a lot that's weird
I can tell feces smell that's all over your breath you've been smoking a lot pot this year
What I'm yelling out I'm a motherfucking beast &amp; a freak when it's usually the truth
(True)
And I can give it to you anyway that you want it baby just let me know what you want me to do
I'ma keep it raw (Raw)
I'ma keep it ill (Ill)
I'ma a psycho so I never want to chill (Chill)
I figure by looking at me that you would know the deal
My penis is hard why don't you come &amp; feel
Oh my goodness it's coming

[Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; Violent J]
I feel it building in me
(It's coming)
I'ma let it go, fast
(It's coming)
So much weight on my shoulders
(It's coming)
Let my volco blast
(It's coming)
I just can't keep it in me
(It's coming)
This shit I can't get passed
(It's coming)
So much stacked up against me
Snap. At. Last. Just.

[Chorus]
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
What the fuck like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
Busting up like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
Up &amp; up like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
They can't stand me but can't command me

They can't stand me but can't command me
They can't stand me but can't command me
They can't stand me but can't command me
They can't stand me but...
(The death pop)

[Tech N9ne]
So damn sick I shock hoe's
Fuck em' that's my motto
Said it gonna be done tomorrow
You fucking mothafackos'
All the mushroom's ex &amp; lean
It'll never take away this dream
Check out the way that I bust a scene
Fucking the industry I'm making it scream
Hi motherfuckers
Why motherfuckers
Thinking I can lose you can die motherfuckers
They saying I'm a thief &amp; I'm a still a type of god?
Whoever saying it is a god damn lie
O-W-H-H!
Off with his head
You really don't ever want to see the boss in the read
How can a stupid motherfucker talk when he dead?
I'm leaving you niggas deep in the mosh give me cred
For being a innovator
How long you've been a hater?
You want to start it up nigga I'll be the generator
Telling your team this is a murder machine
Don't intervene cause' the drama I bring it'll make a motherfucker

[Chorus]
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
What the fuck like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!
AHHHHHH!!!!
Busting up like a wild banshee
SKREEEM!!!

They can't stand me but can't command me
