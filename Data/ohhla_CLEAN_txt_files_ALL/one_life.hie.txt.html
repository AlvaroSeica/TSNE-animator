(Chorus)

Energy that we exchange is imperative
Intricate so simple
Life is the spirit and the body is the temple
One Life One Love
Tell me this are you prepared to live
Energy that we exchange is imperative
Intricate so simple
Life is the spirit and the body is the temple
One Life One Love

[Casual]
All they seen was one hand bust through the white sand
Illuminating the land with liberation
And mysterious, ferociously, serious black man
Experience the urban warfare of fully strapped assault
As an angel hoping my benevolence will change you
Singing folklore of the poor
Natural born warrior
Since the days of Spain was ruled my the Moors
Then again, before your existence
Imhotep
The presenter of the mystics
Geometry, trigonometry statistics
It's simplitics embedded in my bloodline
Just like the pain of my forefathers
The chains of slavery remains
Behaviors we obtained in days that we were slained and tortured
Tormented and scorned
Shackles on my feet, feeding me pork
Lashes on my back, lost my family
Not to belittle the middle passage calamity
I gotta make decisions
Cause I keep havin' visions of flight bombing politicians
On some midnight marauder missions
It gets harder
They shut down your energy, cut off your water
Close the gas station, food supply shortened
Dying of starvation and smoke ventilation
I'm coming realer than you fairytale killers
We disciplined, that's why no militias can get with us
Sure, shot hit us from a thousand meters away
All day

[Del]
Tomorrow, what you gonna do?
Your past is haunting you
You know what, I'ma tell as I'm sipping on this brew
You know it's wrong and true
So what you gonna do?
The truth is long overdue 2X

[Tajai]
I'm talking bout
Demolitions, ammunition
No more propositions or petitions
Seditions met with lynchings and whippings
But they won't crush my wishes into submission
Foresight courtesy of 3rd Eye Vision
Tells me hit 'em
Get 'em before they first force strike
Meet in the black of the night
Dodging ghetto pterodactyl lights
Bring the full gats and precious metals if you true dat
Get wise with medical supplies
Conceptualize and plan
Or get caught with your ass wide open
And not get to ask
"Why", I'm hoping you hear
And I'm hoping your here
For the millenium season opener
I keep ample degrees up my sleeve
For brothers who no longer breathe
No reprieves
Nothing but memories to retrieve
Black babies disease
Stomachs distended, arms out stretched
For any care extended
This is the flock to which I am attended
But I'll do it
I'm committed, commending
All commandants vowing to be uncommon
Fuck the promenade
Underground and granite-strong, granted
The path is jagged and long
And we look raggied
But I want more than this wall at my back in days
Back we would have been mobile
It's time to make power moves
And put the all in all-powerful, all in all
I can't close my eyes
And I would be a coward too
And so would you, so sir
Are yor scared?, no sir
I see answers to irradiate
Eradicate this cancer
They won't catch me playing patty cake with hands up
You might catch me spraying
But I think you better get them flight masks up

[Voice]

I'm ready

[Pep Love]

Yeah, ah huh
One Life One Love
Tell me this are you prepared to live?

(Chorus)

[Voice]

I'm ready
I'm ready</pre>
