Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be thy Name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
Word up!

I make a call but you're not there
I fly a ship into outer space, there
I'm beneath, but there's nothing to say
I forgot how to pray now
And if the sun falls out the sky
And all the truth you know, turn lies
Up to you, but nothing to say (to say)
You forgot how to pray now

Check it out
You've read every book on your shelf
and you know every word by heart
But it does no good
Cuz the world so cold
world so cold
and when the morning comes
it's just so hard to get out of bed
Because this world doesn't know how deep you go
But something's holding you

I make a call but you're not there
I fly a ship into outer space, there
I'm beneath, but there's nothing to say
I forgot how to pray now
And if the sun falls out the sky
And all the truth you know, turn lies
Up to you, but nothing to say
You forgot how to pray now

Oh deep back slide
Hard to believe how we left this ride
Used to believe int he man in the sky
Now we believe in the planets in the eye
besides, if we tried to pray
who'd be listening anyway
tried to get down
to the sounds of my youth

If you can't dance in the car
then you can't dance at all
they can take you far
make your way to star
get in your car
but heaven calls
dance in your car
or you can dance at all

(whoa!)

I make a call but you're not there
I fly a ship into outer space, there
I'm beneath, but there's nothing to say
I forgot how to pray now
And if the sun falls out the sky
And all the truth you know, turn lies
Up to you, but nothing to say
You forgot how to pray now</pre>
