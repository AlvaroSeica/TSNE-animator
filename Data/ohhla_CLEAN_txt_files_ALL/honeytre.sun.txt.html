[Intro: Hell Razah (60 Second Assassin)]
Uh, a Sun of Man letter right here, this one is written for ya'll
Another scripture, this one is written for the young black sister
(She was a run away life, sweet girl from around the way)
Though went through hard times, still beside with us
(She was a run away life, sweet girl from around the way)

[Hell Razah]
She was only 15, but looked much older when she in jeans
Loved to go downtown malls and spend CREAM
Wakin' up late, cold sweats and wet dreams
Over sex, she barely got raped by 18
Already had two abortions and blamed the ecst'
When the doc said it might be a cause of death
Then she popped positive on the pregnancy test
That's the cause and effects when there's no latex
And if daddy found out, he'll be mad upset
To know his little baby girl ain't graduate yet
And when she should of been in class, she was given up ass
And been in bed with every drug dealer nigga with cash
She ain't know who could pass for the baby dad
And when she asked, everybody, son, it made them laugh
It's like her heart was a plane that was made to crash
From the thought, she was sinkin', baby, put it in trash
(She was a run away life...)

[12 O'Clock]
Listen to the smooth pimp talkin'
Load up walkin', met the baddest wiz in Boston
She was seventeen and half with all ass, young Stacy Dash
With a pair painted on bill plaques
Said her birthday comin' fast, I tricked that ass
She wanted ice, I copped the class
Her pops was Jamaican and Arab, sellin' that skab
He bought her a lab and a brand new Jag'
She attended the coochie school in A.T.L.
Leavin' in June, and sure she shared the room
With a chick lookin' like a racoon, with thirty-six size tits
D's with hips, face lookin' like a mechanic fist
Nasty ass chick, gonna kiss you, with a wish

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin (Madam D)]
She was a run away life, sweet girl from around the way (run away)
She was a run away life, sweet girl from around the way (run away, away, yeah)

[Prodigal Sunzini]
Little, from Tahiti, caramel sweetie, honey complexion
Money, love and affection, all she wanted was heaven
Lessons, blesses, hugs and kisses, a thug is vicious
I met her on the Isle to Port of Riches
Sportin' nice ridiculous Nike's, conspicuious, shinin' my talk
Divine spine, style of New York, shorty had the face of dream
Feel of a queen, real as a scene, remind me of the purest of things
No time to waste, no oil sheens, her soil was clean
Beauty was keen, sort of like the flowers of spring
She said she lived the law by king
Kept her mind, body and soul free from poetry
Healthy and wealthy, house, car and the keys
Graduate, college degrees, baby was me
I said, in time, baby girl you'll soon be mine
Let's connect like the stars above, forever shine
(She was a run away life)

[60 Second Assassin]
Mine was like one, queen of soul
Walkin' like a pimp, plus you shinin' like dough
Acknowledge me, while formin' the mind
Of a culture of blacks, day and time
Have you not heard, that you the queen of the Earth
Plus you're precious, womb to home of God, physical birth
Sun of above, it was a gift of surprise
Created by I, the God, the glow in your eyes
Of course, you're complexed, in reference, it's my creation
I make sure, you vision, I'm about elevation
I seen the jazziest of women, the swiftest of men
Fall from the top of glory to the bottomless end
Pimps, pushers, sniffin' cocaine
Why Harry hold the shot, at a young sister's fame
Brothers runnin' round claimin', to be mad
Sudden sisters virgin, for a ten dollar crab
Sister of potential, but known not they skills
Pure days lies in the crack dealers build
Latin Queen, can you see my universal diamonds and emeralds
And nothin' but jewels, the governer hustles, and masters the fools
These people like cups on they shield
Still tryin' to get the emeralds out they dollars and bills

[Outro: Hell Razah]
There you have it, scripture written
Hell Razah, Prodigal Sun, 60 and 12 O'Clock
All the young ladies understand that
We all need God, to every black man there's a black woman
Word up, we gonna rise, we gonna build and feed food for the multiply
Knowhati'msayin? S.O.M., Sunz of Man, to the world
Rewind it and read it, study it and understand it
Share it with your family, let your baby listen
It's all good, understand us, we all hood</pre>
