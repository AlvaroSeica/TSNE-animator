Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing is for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
[Repeated]

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter hoe.

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter hoe.

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Stack that paper
Stack it stack it stack it up some more
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more
I'm smoking up on that tropical jolly green yeah Galapogos
Rainbow chain on my necklace look like a pot of gold
I'm who these girls is tryna know jumping off Jeronimo
They tell me I'm the best I say I ain't even trying hoe
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
So now I'm in two hoes, real shit boy
You don't drink, more for me
We chillin out when niggas can't afford to be
Look baby girl you better act accordingly
Cause I see bout ten more of you but sorry there's no more of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can
Cause I might go from plane to whips
See my money is hand to hand
I'm shining from neck to wrist
And your girl want mouth to mouth
But I make her get neck to dick
Cause she just want connections with a nigga that's connected
Bitch, I'm who they want see want see
Used to tell me everything I won't be
You gon be, fucking with piranha's and they gon eat
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
Oooh, and now my life is beautiful
I'm a boss bitch you should come and grab a cubicle
Look and I remain until my funeral
Stand up nigga like I'm in front of the urinal
Boyyyyyyy

[Chorus: Big Sean]</pre>
