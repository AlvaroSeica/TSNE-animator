[Verse 1: MC Magic]
When I
Sit back and I close my eyes
When I got you sittin' by my side
When I feel that sexy body rubbin' up all over mine
That's when I know I got a tenderoni
More than a homey
When the lights go down, you all up on me
Damn; what I gotta do to show you, mama
Touchin' places that you wanna
So hot like Arizona
NY to California
Cause you that type of tenderoni that I been tryin' to find
Tell me your fantasies and all them secrets in your mind
Let's roll in a hotel suite
Lingerie and your pretty feet
Looks so good that I wanna eat
I think you twistin' me
And I know you love this place
So good like birthday cake
Let's put it down like Bobby Brown, and my man
Babyface

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Jx3]
Used to be a dame when I pimped the game
Different kind of girl for a different day
It's funny how life take a sudden change
Cause any more pimp left in my brain
Got one girl that makes me whole
All them other girls is out the front door
Once was, in a rush, to be grown
But now I sit back, relax and drop slow
Got a lot of money and you knowin' that
So let me give you ice like a polar cap
Get a Gucci bag outfit to match
And then, get the shoes that go with that
I love it when you walk out and represent
Jx3 to the full extent
The way you dig a dame give me confidence
That I'm a company, get the bombest chick
Can't anybody tell me that you not that girl (Nope)
Can't anybody tell me theirs are better than the world (Nope)
Everybody wanna be a judge
But the reality, is they mad they ain't got that girl
Let's sit back and live it up
Get a couple whips and ram 'em up
Turn the focus from them to us
All my non-believers can give it up

Repeat Chorus

[Jx3]
Welcome to Magic City, baby
Hey

[MC Magic]
Shooby-doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop
I wanna love you
Shooby-doo-wop, my tenderoni
I wanna take you to Magic
City, city, baby
Shooby-doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop
I wanna love you
Shooby-doo-wop, my tenderoni
I wanna take you to Magic
City, city, city, city (Baby)
