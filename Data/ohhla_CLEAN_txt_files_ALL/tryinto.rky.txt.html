[Intro: R. Kelly]
Ooooooooooh-weeee!
Ohh! Ohh! Guess who?
It's Kells and NELLY!
Nelly you ready? Uh-huh
Y'all ready? Uh-huh
Okay, let's go

[Chorus 2X: R. Kelly]
I pull up to the club steppin fresh up out the Hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter make it feel like summer
What I'm doin? Hey, hey, I'm tryin to get a number (yeah)

[Nelly]
Half you niggaz goin 'bout it all wrong (all wrong)
Let me tell you what might help to get her home (get her home)
You think that lame-ass demeanor gon' make her wan' come and see ya
Should've listened to Big, you're +Dead Wrong+ (you're dead wrong, hey)
First you get your swagger right, then go stand right by that light
Let that light hit off that ice, lookin like you landin flights
That shit there like kryptonite, she tryna put up a fight
But she can't help it she enticed, she done looked like more than twice
St. Louis, yeah! Chi-Town, yeah!
This a lot of money mama, this ain't even fair
They climbin on the tables and they standin on the chairs
They tryin to get a glimpse of what the hell is over there
Then pop-pop-pop go a round of bottles, then pop-pop-pop R. Kelly follows
This shit here like hard to swallow, only real niggaz here know this power
Only real niggaz give paper showers, three or four grand like every hour
And I don't give a fuck who else in town
Midwest come through shut this bitch DOWN!

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I'm in the club and I'm sippin on Patr√≥n
And I'ma be up in this bitch, all night long
So many my baby mama's I'm scopin out like a hunter
I'm tryin to see which one of them I'm takin home
Look at her, look at her, I like her, go get her
Fuck it, go get them, let all of them bitches in
Got a lot of cash and I'm ready to spend it all
I'm so high up in this motherfucker, I can't see y'all
Before you take a picture (HEE) give me time to pause
And it go like suit (uh-huh) my ice (uh-huh) my stunners, now pause
R. Kelly (that's what's up) Kells and Nelly (that's what's up)
Get that paper (that's what's up) fuck them haters (that's what's up)
Hey, y'all got the game all misconstrued
I'm about to break it down and try and talk some sense in y'all fools
Lookie here, playa let me tell you what's happenin
Get that number, keep it private
Tell that bitch to write it down, shake your hand and get that napkin

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I'm gettin my drink on, I got my stunners on
Just stop the music, you could hear this on your ringtone
We in here all night long, this goin 'til 6 in the mornin
Wake up with two chicks, wash our ass and goin straight to the mall
Now give me that number

[Chorus] - 1/2X</pre>
