[Intro: John Waters]
Hi, I'm John Waters and this is "The Creep"

[Chorus: The Lonely Island]
When you out at a club and you see a fly girl
Do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 
And you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do The Creep (HOOOOOH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 

[Andy Samberg]
Well, we got a new dance, so get up on your feet
It's real easy to do, and it's called "The Creep"
Let your hands flap around like a Marionette
Pop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shakin ya neck

[Akiva Schaffer]
Now pull your waistband up like you expectin a flood
and slick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your speakers - you a certified creeper

[Chorus 2: The Lonely Island]
When you see a country peach layin out at the beach
Do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do The Creep (HOOOOOH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 

[Andy Samberg]
I was 6 years old when I started creepin
My parents took it to their room and I started peepin
You can't imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
and saw my little ass creepin at the foot of the bed

[Akiva Schaffer]
Yeah, they knew I was a creep, since the day I was born!
Poppin out my momma like some kettle corn
Yeah the doctor caught my head and he started freakin
'Cause I came out clean, and I came out creepin!

[The Lonely Island]
Nicki, Nicki
NICKI, NICKI, NICKI, NICKI

[Nicki Minaj]
When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside, it was my little creep s-s-stalker room
As they disrobed, I was ooglin and ogglin
Little did they know, that for me, they were modelin
And I would laugh -- HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA, HAAAH!
And they would dance -- (La-la-la-la-la-la-la, lah!)
So pop-pop-pop your peepers and t-t-tweak out your sneakers
Don't sleep, come on get your Creep on wit me!

[Chorus 3: Lonely Island + Nicki Minaj]
Gon' get to sweatin off a bride at her wedding
Do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 
Or when you sneak into a wake and you see a beefcake
Do The Creep (HOOOOOH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 
When the judge is a hottie and you can't control your body
Do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) And do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 
So getcha knees flexin and ya arms T-Rexin
And Creep (HOOOOOH!) Do The Creep (HAAAAAAH!) 

[John Waters]
And don't forget to smile!</pre>
