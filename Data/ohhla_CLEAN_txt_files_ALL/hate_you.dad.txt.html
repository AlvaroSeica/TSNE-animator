Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Dirty Money]
I don't even know if I've found redemption
Cause I still hear somethin, whisperin
Tryin to tell me somethin 'bout you
Don't know how to tell him I'm through
I gave you my sanity
You gave me a chance to live
You're tellin me I don't need ya, I don't believe ya
Cause I don't need nobody like you

[Chorus]
Don't go, don't go; don't want you, I hate you {*3X*}
Don't go, don't go; don't go, I hate you

[Diddy]
Turn my wings and leap to the sky (to the sky)
I smoke my reefer gettin high (gettin high)
You know without you I would die (I would die)
You clip my wings, now I can't fly (can't fly)
My momma told me never cry (cry)
She never told me to say bye (bye)
I cannot let you go, I tried
I hate you girl, you know I lied {*2X*}

[Dirty Money]
Boy you're gonna have to use your senses
Just to figure out the distance, difference
How you wanna love me, you choose
It's simple, why you lookin confused?
I gave you my sanity
I gave you a chance to live
Tellin me I don't need ya, I don't believe ya
Cause I don't need nobody like you

[Chorus]

[Diddy]
Leave the motherfuckin bridge for me
You just let me bleed
You just let me leave
Now I can not see
Cause when I cry, I cry tears of blood
You the one I love (I love)
You the one I love (I love)
You the one I trust
And you said you can't fuck with me
I can't fuck wit'chu
We can't fuck with we
And we can not see
I hate you girl, you know I lied {*2X*}

[Dirty Money]
Baby I can't stand you, baby please don't go
I'd rather hate you than see you out the do'
Baby ain't no love left here for you, nooo
If that's what I'm tellin you
I hate lovin you
I don't wanna, don't wanna be without you, nooo
Why not tell the truth?
I hate lovin you
I don't wanna, don't wanna be without you
I let you control my heart
Baby but you go to far - don't want you, I hate you
Don't go, don't go; don't want you, I hate you</pre>
