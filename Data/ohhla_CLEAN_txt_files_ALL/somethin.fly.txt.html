[Ese Daz &amp; LaLa]
Somethin' about you

Chorus: Ese Daz (Ese Daz &amp; LaLa)
Makes me high (Somethin' about you)
The way you love (Somethin' about you)
The way you look (Somethin' about you)
The way you are (Somethin' about you)
The way you kiss (Somethin' about you)
Your sexy eyes (Somethin' about you)
The way you smile (Somethin' about you)
Makes me crazy (Somethin' about you)

(Verse 1)
[Ese Daz] Here I go again
        Distracted in them thighs, got me smilin'
        Where do I begin, it's like a story untold
        Revealin' my feelings while the plot unfolds
[LaLa]    So what you sayin'
[Ese Daz] So let me tell you what I mean
[LaLa]    Quit playin'
[Ese Daz] For real, baby, you and me
        So what you sayin'
[LaLa]    I don't know if it could be
[Ese Daz] Quit playin'
[LaLa]    We'll just have to wait and see
[Ese Daz] No way, it's cool, but girl, I'm tellin' you
        Okay, it's true, this love I fell into

Refrain: Ese Daz (Ese Daz &amp; LaLa)
I ain't lyin'
I'm comin' right out to
Tell you
That there's (Somethin' about you)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Ese Daz] Here I go again (Damn)
        Follow my lead, mama, come and hold my hand
        Don't be scared (No)
        Don't be nervous (Uh hun)
        Give it a shot (Yeah)
        Nothing can hurt us (Right)
[LaLa]    So what you sayin'
[Ese Daz] I'm tryin' to take you home with me
[LaLa]    Quit playin'
[Ese Daz] I know you want me desperately
        So what you sayin'
[LaLa]    Take a look, but don't touch
[Ese Daz] Quit playin'
[LaLa]    Promise me we won't rush
[Ese Daz] Okay, I promise to take it easy
        Between the sheets, slow love, please believe me

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Ese Daz] Here I go , won't you go with me (Come on)
        Let's come together
        Don't need to be lonely
        You know what I want
        And what I'm tryin' to get
        The way you dress, the way you kiss, baby, what you except
[LaLa]    So what you sayin'
[Ese Daz] We gotta get down tonight
[LaLa]    Quit playin'
[Ese Daz] For real, girl, the time is right
        So what you sayin'
[LaLa]    I'm ready, boy, bring it to me
[Ese Daz] Quit playin'
        Come on, girl, sing it to me
[LaLa]    Somethin' about you, it ain't that I doubt you
        So boy, let me know that it's real
