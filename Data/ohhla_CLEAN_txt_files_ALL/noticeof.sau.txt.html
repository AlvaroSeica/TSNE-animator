[Saul Williams]
Something is dying tonight
There will be no more breath and no more light
I've burned every candle and extinguished every fear
And I've waited for your time to pass to bring in my new year
Something is dying tonight
There will be no more struggle, no more fight
And I've known that I'd have to live through suffering and youth
but I'm the landlord of my dreams now and my tenets rent is due
Something is dying
Something is dying inside of me
In spite of me..
Something is dying tonight
My old paddles off to Saturn
Taking flight and the astronaut within me
Has no air supply at all so
So he's plunging into the deep sea with no parachute to fall
Something is dying tonight, I can't eat and I can't sleep
So I just write.. cause I wanted you to lean on
To distract me from my feet
Oh, my karma will cure me, out of bounds and out of reach
Something is dying
Something is dying inside of me
In spite of me
Something is dying
Something is dying inside of me
In spite of me...
Author of wind of change, "Phantom of the Opera"
Tenor of the octet range spews volcanic lava
Silent heart of the sun not just the world of interest
Sun retires calls it a day and sleeps a hundred winters
Darkness echoes thunder cries and wager war of laughter
Dolphins come ?for view? sea and sky and the here after
Bumble bees crawl to the tops of trees and call out to the children
Little girl awakes from dream as Elvis leaves the building
Elvis leaves the building
Elvis leaves the building
Elvis leaves the building
Elvis leaves the building
Down pour from the darkest cloud and humiliated attention
Flasher of the third leads him to the fourth dimension
Shotgun rings across a plan down goes another line
Harlem church cries sing refrain; a margin of design</pre>
