[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Right here, ok, love is an art, it's what we living
Love is a house, that we live in
Love is for all of us, show ya love

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
I love my pops, I love my moms
I love my kids, and I love my arms (I love living life)
I love my brothers, I love my sisters
I love my aunts, and I love my uncles (I love living life)
I love my nieces, I love my wife
I love my nephew, and I love to write (I love living life)
I love the sun, I love the day
I love the rain, and I love the night (I love living life)

[Lounge Lo]
Yo I, figured it out, I'm growing up, bugging out
My brothers, and my sisters, I hug 'em out
My mother, from day one, she had to struggle out
But listen, mommy, Lounge Mode, I love you out
Remember see-saws, sliding boards, and baby swings
When I was young, I did crazy things
And I cried when you left, and even though
You was coming back, ma, I cried to death
And I smiled when you was there, I ain't care
Big sister, babysitted, took me outside, to the nearest
Picnic, with a whole bunch of food
So that I could pick with it, so I could pick with it

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
I was stuck in a tunnel with no light, til flamed out
And took life serious as soon as my daughter came out
Times is hard, my brother still bugging out
Respect ya fam, you love 'em in and love 'em out
That's all you got, that's all you have
And just imagine have to talk about, all them laughs
It been a long time coming, 30 plus with five kids
I'm try'nna live life like survivor's did
You know papa was a rolling stone, momma said
Take ya time young man, and control ya own
Lisa, Denise, thank you for the world you gave me
And Dana Cotto, thanks for them girls you gave me

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
Let me talk to 'em, I know you gone
And I wish you was here to see Lo get on
Because the times done changed, momma love's still crying
Ever since I was born, my heart been dying
But it's picked up the pace, since you left me here
I cried and struggled, just for the breath of air
Man, daddy, I miss you, and as I a grown man
I'll still kiss you, and do the favors if you need the tissue
Damn, life is bugged, and I'm talking bout a man in my life, I love
And if you grandma, give her a tightening hug
As I look up in the sky, the star lights above
And if you see Erin and Case, tell 'em that I'm still grinding
And if they ask you, tell 'em that I'm still rhyming
I love you, man, I love my fam
Rest in peace Alvin Cornelius, I hug you, man

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Uh-huh, yeah man, grandma I see you
Daddy... Uncle Sonny, knawhatimean
2 Cent, Case, this for all ya'll man
Y'all just hold it down, I see ya'll man</pre>
