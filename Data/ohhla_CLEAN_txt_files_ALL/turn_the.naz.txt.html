[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah, you can't win in these streets, this Gaza Strip, Middle East
Who would know before long you struggled for so long?
Make you wanna go long, shock then bomb, war face on
The camouflage became these concrete lawns
It's a robbery, tired of tryna be righteous
Tired of not letting it bust on nigga
So you can see the gun blast, run past your lenses
Flash before your eye pitch, crumbs is all is digest
Readers in the pool of words and heaters
Merged with slurs of reefer
And watch it glow when you 'turn those lights off'
I can't save your city before I save me
So what's it worth? Four spins or J-O-B
Woman, chains and bell, we sinners
Waste can tell me different ways to G-off
A different stage to flee off, different lights to see off
Just saw you feed off and try to walk with me
That's how it be, guns rule the city
Slums they move with me
We an army of orphaned, fostered child miracles
Hand me a burner nigga, I can help you get spiritual

[Chorus: Bronze Nazareth (Kevlaar 7)]
When they 'turn those lights off'
There goes your dreams, there goes your plans and scheme
Reach for the high beams when I 'turn those lights off'
This is not a camera flash, no silencer when my grandma blast
Fuck a mask, when they 'turn those lights off'
They'll never see me like saddles in the pitch black
Get back or hear click clack
When they 'turn those lights off'
(That's not lightening, nightmares igniting
Starring niggas sniping when I 'turn those lights off')</pre>
