Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Give me your hand
And I'll take away your pain
This to shall pass
It's such a shame
I'll be your army
Your army of one
And you'll feel better when we're done

Wrap yourself in my arms
I'll keep you safe from harm
Fall into me, love is all you need
Walk back from the end
We can only do our best
Gotta keep on doing... you'll forgive me [repeat]

I'll be gatekeeper
I'll be your gatekeeper
all your secrets drop your defense
I'll be gatekeeper
I'll be your gatekeeper
all your secrets drop your defense

Tell all your secrets, share all your shame
I'll hold you closely
You'll be ok
We're only human
We're sometimes wrong
Don't be your motto, tell someone

Wrap yourself in my arms
I'll keep you safe from harm
Fall into me, love is all you need
Walk back from the end
We can only do our best
Gotta keep on doing... you'll forgive me [repeat]

I'll be gatekeeper
I'll be your gatekeeper
All your secrets drop your defense
I'll be gatekeeper
I'll be your gatekeeper
All your secrets drop your defense

Said I'll be your gatekeeper...</pre>
