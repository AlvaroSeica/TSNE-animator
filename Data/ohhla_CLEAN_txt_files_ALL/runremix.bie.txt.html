[Raekwon - Intro]
Visual visual...JB
Yo 'Ye waddup?
Raekwon

[Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone, me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love; I sit at starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin, you seen the Captain?
Blinked at me, then I threw on my thinkin cap
Take her, then we can slide to Jamaica
shopping for a year or two, stop in Diega
It's obvious, I wanna see who your mami is
We just friends, so she can't Clyde-Bonnie us
Fly walls, dinin in the fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in a knots 
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather
Playin the field tryna outsling Berretta
{Tiger style~!}

[Justin Bieber]
You see my, BABY up and hit the road
Where she's going, that's where nobody knoooows
I need to FIND her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just tryna to be cool, cool, cool (tryna be cool)
What would you exepct me to do? (Hooo-hooo, whooooa, yeah)
I'm just tryin to find, find, find
That sweeeeeet, love of mine

[Chorus]
I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin up
I give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

[Kanye West - overlaps chorus]
Yeah 
Raekwon, Yeezy, JB

[Kanye West] (Justin Bieber)
Uh, last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, "Yo, what's ya occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon 
Stuntin in our high top Louie's, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you +Meet the Parents+, you tell DeNiro
Her boyfriend's a zero, she needs to cut the weirdo
Next show, they got it up to zeroes
Nobody rockin like this sixteen-years-old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm tellin you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top ol' school, bumpin the "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin
They say, "You lookin good, fly colored Asian!"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my +G-Unit+ like Olivia
'til she caught me gettin numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, huh!
(Sweeeeet, love of mine)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Why, can't I find (why can't I find)
you, love of mine
when you're standing in front of my face
Oh, I (Ooooh-oh I)  
Girl must be miiiiiiine
How did I let you get awaaay-eeeee-heeee..
Heh-heh, yeaaaa-heaaa-yeaaaaah

[Raekwon]
Leave it up to the Most High, sittin at Ghost's fly
Chillin with two of my brothers 
We both live on deck, baggin 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go I'm a go-get
Take that queen, assure to ya
We can live it up every month, baby girl just call me up
wakin up, restin in cold sweats, thinkin of this {sex} 
The video tapes even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste, no love lost 
I know I'm goin crazy I can't floss
me my lady, left my homies
It's all baloney, just like rockin the old Ponies
So when I'm chillin, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that film it
Take your time, Rae, Just' and 'Ye'll shine
My runaway love, gimme mine, c'mon

[Chorus]</pre>
