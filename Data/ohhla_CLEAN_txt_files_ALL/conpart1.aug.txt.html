Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Late nights tryin to get a bar right
I said go ahead girl you know your body tight
Shoes coming down I was looking up
Caught her attention that's when we got stuck
7 minute conversation
Shawty talks about our life in lust
Introduce myself as August
But her loved ones call her darling
Exchange numbers now she dialing
When she's calling then

Can I come over?
Come over
Can I come over?
Come over

Going up and down on the pole
Got the money she do anything for
And all them insecurities gone
Girl I ain't gonna judge you
Plans are reaching her bells
On the grind and know what she working for
She be throwin it up and droppin it low
Confessions, confessions</pre>
