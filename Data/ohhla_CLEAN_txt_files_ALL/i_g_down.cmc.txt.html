It's goin down

[Daddy Free]
black cat saggin, got my black flaggin
my back pocket raggin as I enter like the dragon
far from no-show, freak hits the do'
crawlin back street and stays low from the po-po
even though I'm Christian, LA's twisted
make the whole good nuz and now my 12 straight commission (?)
I'm fishin for the lost men, catchin 'em and tossin 'em
into my net and I'll just to my set (?)
now check out the mission that was layed at my feet
I was told "no returnin till the mission's complete"
first look at God's Word as meat, cause you are what you eat
and second of all, you must practice what you preach
teach me the each and believe what you speak
take the Bible, take ya brotha, and ya gangsta beat
now it's on, we makin the Gospel grub now
It's too late, why, it's goin down

ba ba ba da, ba da
goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
goin down
ba ba ba da, ba the

[Gizmo]
It's goin down, may day, may day
but people won't listen, oh thats what they say
but they don't know, that God had a plan from the get-go
into the ghetto, and gave me the vision I never let go
so many tried to hold us back
couldnt understand the fact of two Gs doin Gospel Rap
tellin the youth the Truth, upon this mic that I'm checkin
in my life Christ is first, makin records is second
I'm a minister before artist, cause in this rap thang
the sun will be gone but the Bible stays on my lap, man
the war is on, time to fight, hold ya sword tight
with all your might, do whats right and shine ya light
upon a hill, feel the thrill of Victory
and satan can't get with me, in Jesus' name you're history
so I'm gonna, steady runnin, for my crown
you can't stop it, it's too late, it's goin down

[repeat chorus 2X]

It's goin down

[Gizmo]
please, let your mind be at ease
as your stereo tunes in to the C dash M dash Cs
let us take you on a ride, jump on your saddle quick
because it's goin down like the sinkin your battle ship
that'll get, you swingin, to what we're singin
the music is playin, we're praisin Jesus all day and night
It's only right that comes tight with the written
Christian for steady hittin, avoided the unforbidden      (Daddy Free):
Christ liable lival from the time of arrival (?)
so I paws my tribal as I pause, and go for my Bible (?)
tuck it in my waist
satan tried to come and steal it but I stuck it in his face
time for the get-back, or time for the set-back
goin church to church with the Gospel
like apostle Paul, I can't stall
and can't nobody stop it as I drop it, it's goin down y'all

ba ba ba da, ba da
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down
ba ba ba da, ba da
It's goin down</pre>
