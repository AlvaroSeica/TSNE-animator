[Intro: 50 Cent]
I guess this is 6 out of 6 motherfuckers!!!!
RRRRRRRRR!!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You runnin I'm comin to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothin can save ya
Times runnin out I'm a get ya boy

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I do it b-boy style, bullet wound in my smile (AHHHH!!!!!)
That beef I cook it, nigga I gets down (YEAH!)
Call it what you want it's the clip, the ladder, banana
I bet when I squeeze it niggas scatter (AHHHH!!!!!)
The hoes that's a whole different story
Find out the baby ain't mine right there on Maury
Me I make the whip fish tail, trunk full of fishscale
Raw market itself, sucka the shit sell (WOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO!!!!!)
That's thirty six O's of love, give me kiss, give me love
Get to talkin in codes the phone bugged
It's Ferrari I get to the green, half man, hald machine
(*Tu-Tu-Tu) I'm on ya head with the beam
So focused ferocious, I shoot ya pretty ass out them Gucci loafers
Your fuckin with the wrong one
The strong one that God gave the gift, stop the hater shit 
You wanna make it why would you be mad? 
I done made it bitch!!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You runnin I'm comin to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothin can save ya
Times runnin out I'm a get ya boy

[Freeway] (50 Cent)
Get get gully, get, get get gully (Yeah)
Get get gully, get, get get gully (Yeah)
We get gully and we get money
Them schemin ass chicks can't get shit from me

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Tear drops from heaven, the angels cryin 
It's rainin outside, envision my gun firin (RRRRRRRR!!!!)
Red and white flashes the police comin
Nigga you aint hittin none, why the fuck are you runnin?!!
I make your mama wish your ass was a stillborn (HA!!!!!!!!)
When that eagle get to chirpin on the front lawn
Where's the love? I don't know but here's the snub
Suck a barrel swallow the slug, die like a thug
You know it's really not worth it, to fuck with me,
You rather tongue kiss the serpent, don't cry we all die
It's just a matter of time
Nigga one shot from the nine will shatter your spine
Fine! I'm! The last of my breed, criminal tendancies inside of an emcee
Fuck around I will line you, run from me I will find you
Forgot I'm nice I'll remind you

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You runnin I'm comin to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothin can save ya
Times runnin out I'm a get ya boy

[Freeway] (50 Cent)
Get get gully, get, get get gully (Yeah)
Get get gully, get, get get gully (Yeah)
We get gully and we get money
Them schemin ass chicks can't get shit from me

[Outro: 50 Cent]
One, two, fifty coming for you
Three, four, better lock ya door
Five, six, grab ya crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
The monsters back!!! Yeah!!! I need a target!!!!!!
I need somebody to get out of line!!!
So I can smash their head!!!! Yeah! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
