Artist: David Mars f/ Eyedea, Impulse
Album:  Davis Mars
Song:   Go to Hell
Typed by: Steven Medina

Eyedea: Now that people give it up
I no longer have to steal
Now that I can get this numb
There's no reason to feel
Ive built a rot garden and killed every flower in the field 
Now where are your day dreams when you need them to be real

David Mars: So loosen up the neck tie
You'll get em on the next try
And drink/dream? for what we are trying to see
This is the only time where we can make believe in between the screens
of the perfect scene that rises from the darkness
Your the one that starts this

Impulse: If everybody stays in line
There is no need to persuade the vibe
They kill themselves in room at night
So why do we sustain its life
Everyone will gain tonight cuz I know my aim is right between the eyes
Putting an end to your surprise 

Eyedea: Believe me its as easy as rotten apple pie
Your drive was fastified and its obvious a clown would laugh then cry
Sorry to offend you
But I cant pretend to even wanna give a shit
about the choices that could end you

David Mars: So the vaster that you tend to breathe
Is an issue with my self esteem
I say you need to be in the path of present that will never last
Suicidal thank you man for your wife and dreams and couldn't? cash?
I robbed a bank and didn't ask
Where the fucks the passion at

Impulse: At this point you couldn't break me of my ways
Or tell me something you checked the disinterest in my face
Put me in my place cuz I'm feeling kinda home sick
They label me unstable
So I guess I have to own it

Chorus
Eyedea: So wash your hands clean of the guilt that tends to stick to you 
Impulse: I understand me enough to know that im getting sick of you

David Mars: Until we eliminate this thing we know so well

Eyedea: You can do the 
Impulse: You can do the 
David Mars: You can do the 
All 3: Go to hell 
Eyedea: So wash your hands clean of the guilt that tends to stick to you 
Impulse: I understand me enough to know that im getting sick of you

David Mars: Until we eliminate this thing we know so well

Eyedea: You can do the 
Impulse: You can do the 
David Mars: You can do the 
All 3: Go to hell 

Eyedea: Twenty below
Twenty seconds flat another candle light
20 in my pocket looks like PBR in ?Rail? tonight
Its funny how everything has meaning if you see it right
I have to spread my wings and sing a song in the key of flight 

David Mars: I invited self loathing to a party full of fingerings
They beat the piss out of naked bliss
Now no one can miss the happy part
I'm torn apart from the naked start
Right to the nose to the strangled heart
Bank in the name of the picture frame we use to hang so gracefully

Impulse: Grab your partner by the hand
Tear the heart in half and laugh
If I didn't (paint or hang) the stars you left 
Id want your autograph
Remember this night
Take a photograph and frame it
Hang it on your wall and name it the day you stopped complaining

Eyedea: Whats this
I understand why your upset
They drained all the blood from your brain and painted you love sick
I get it and I'm sorry if you think ruining my day would take the pain away
and some how magically make you feel ok 

David Mars: Impossible is not far away
When (entitled words or tidal waves) come out to play
You say the blood in your veins are stained from the caffeine and the nicotine 
But hey little angel child I got this stick of dynamite
To open up your magic wings and crack the mirror of vanity

Impulse: For petes sake
You call that a clean slate
You just sweep under the rug and then call it a day
So call it half essence or lack of passion 
But I'm in no position to give advice and then cash it

Chorus
Eyedea: So wash your hands clean of the guilt that tends to stick to you 
Impulse: I understand me enough to know that im getting sick of you

David Mars: Until we eliminate this thing we know so well

Eyedea: You can do the 
Impulse: You can do the 
David Mars: You can do the 
All 3: Go to hell 
Eyedea: So wash your hands clean of the guilt that tends to stick to you 
Impulse: I understand me enough to know that im getting sick of you

David Mars: Until we eliminate this thing we know so well

Eyedea: You can do the 
Impulse: You can do the 
David Mars: You can do the 
All 3: Go to hell</pre>
