Acting pretty heinous, we're all slaves til you unchain us
And you are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you're way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I've created

On her forehead, I tattooed my name backwards
So when she looks in the mirror she sees her favorite rapper
I'm a stunt actor, first on Fear Factor
Eat spiders and hide inside of a trash compactor

Get smashed harder than Kardashian backdoor
Make me wanna smack whores in nuclear reactors
I'm all eyes; your girlfriend- she's all fours
That means she's a dog but got a face like a raptor

What a dinosaur, looking bad on her best night
Are you perfectly sure your woman's not a transvestite?
That's not nice- I've got bad behavior
Got ten years of labor for killing all of my neighbors

I used a light saber, thought I was Darth Vader
I made her dress up like Laura Croft from Tomb Raider
Dipped into the acid, kidnapped Ralph Nader
Hijacked a rocket ship and hid out in a space crater
Take a look at the data, obvious that I made a
Different state of mind for all the common denominators

Acting pretty heinous, we're all slaves til you unchain us
And your are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you're way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I've created

I call upon Poseidon; spear you all with a trident
You say your mouth hurts?  Well it's my lines, you bite em
I have the moxie to go- you can't stop me
Knock your teeth out on the floor- it's not hockey

No Wayne Gretzky, heck, you can respect me
Took it to the bank with a bouncer, they never check me
I'm not next to blow; I'm not an upcoming artist
I'm just a white boy who so happens to spit the hardest

Every song I make is just another credential
I'ma keep going cuz I recognize the potential
Quintessential to me to implode your cranium
Forget gold or platinum, I'm double uranium

Dictionary rappers see me and go back to Webster's
I'm a bit of an expert, smarter than Poindexter
If you make one song- feening to sell big
You have a worse chance of fame than Kenan and Kel did

Acting pretty heinous, we're all slaves til you unchain us
And your are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you're way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I've created

You rappers are laughable, edible and forgettable
You only get wet when I chew you up, it's incredible
Not a laughing matter, this chatter is not humorous
The ways I make all of you dreams shatter are numerous

More bars than a cellular tower, my signal's strong
Feeling even more powerful by the hour, what's wrong?
I've scoured meteor showers for hours hoping to make it clearer
The only star I see is looking back in the mirror

I crack my ankles, my back, my neck and knuckles as well
And since my music is cracking you might be stuck on the shelf
Katy Perry got my cherry chapstick, it was magic
Pulling on my rabbit, we can go and make it a habit

She kisses girls but I don't kiss boys
Lil Wayne can kiss Baby all he wants but I won't do the same
I should refrain in case people take it as a diss
It's not a diss, just naming the person that he kissed!

Acting pretty heinous, we're all slaves til you unchain us
And your are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you're way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I've created
