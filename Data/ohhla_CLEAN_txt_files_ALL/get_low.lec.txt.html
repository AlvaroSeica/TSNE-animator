Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, humility, humility
Get low boy
Get low girl
Humility, humility
I really shouldn't trust myself
Cause without God I'm nothin but dust myself
So full of pride I disgust myself
So I stay tryin to crucify and crush myself
I ain't tryin to say I hate myself
But my sin nature got me tryin praise myself
So I get low, prostrate myself
And pray to God that I don't play myself, yeah
Folks actin like Nebuchanezzar
Like they feet don't stink like they got it together
God have to break em down put em back together
Cause he looks to the humble to find his pleasure
Whether, we missin hub caps or roll on dubs
The Earth is the footstool of God above
Check Isaiah 66 and face it bruh
We only significant because he raised us up
To get low

[Chorus]
Get low, get low, get low, get low, get low get low get low
Dis ain't one of dem nasty throws I'm talkin bout humble yaself befo' the lord
Uh, Get low, get low, get low, get low, get low get low get low
You ain't gotta touch the flo', but ya gotta give props to the God who rose
Get low

[Lecrae]
This easy don't let me get comfortable, so full of myself I'm comfortable
Folks wantin you the radio pumpin you start feelin yourself and now the Lord gotta humble you
Make sure you do a heart check mayn
You trying to rep Christ though you reppin your name
You in it for his glory or you in it for your game
Cause the Lord know the truth and if you doin it in vain
You think you gon miss yo chance?
You trust in the Lord over circumstance (Whoa)
Cause God will open the do', for those
Who don't chase, ain't hopin for gold
I pray this song soak in ya dome
So our God won't have to leave you broken to know
That he's searchin your heart and he's bound to know
If you goin for his name or you goin for yo's

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Check, Christ got low for days
He's the God in the flesh we supposed to praise
But he made himself low like the folks he made
And he died so our God had him rose in days, yeah
And that's the way you do that mayn
We submit to the God who can do all thangs
Call him el elyon yeah pursue that name
Not da money not the glory don't pursue that thang, what
In a matter worthy of yo cause
You a Christian, humility, you know that dawg
Yeah I know it's kinda hard eva since the fall
Humility hasn't made much since at all
Everybody say it's all about youÂ–but naw
Don't believe in the lies don't trust a dawg
Just trust in the God who can crush us all
But to those that he chose - yeah he loves us all
Get low</pre>
