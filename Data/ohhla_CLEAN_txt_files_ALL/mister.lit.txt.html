Well, I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...
I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...

Like candles, the flame can't stand to - sit within the wind
And while the haters get handled
The people grant you, me, yours truly
To project my music-with-a-plan-to interrupt the movement
Seeming so cool but being so rude, who living on this Earth
Could change my mind from what I do
But Lord Jesus as the heater at the center of the globe
If I finish then I'm finishing to end at all wrong
Gone, be about your business 'fore I reach off in my trunk space
Ending all descretion with the heater that I brung
Make children spell my name like in an alphabetic soup
Swoop gently through the middle of the sinning like a bullet
If I pull it then I'm pulling so consider me a nutcase
Pulling every obstacle that's all up in my front face
But - Hey! Brother ain't tripping
When I say that I am crunker than a mother
And little shawty ain't slipping...

But, I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...
I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...

Give me a cup, give me a blunt, that's right!
I ain't tripping, I'm crunk, sharing the love, that how
I live in this dumb, filling with scum, backside
Small planet with nothing but bitter thoughts and crime
But I be off in the cut, perculating on the come-up
Flipping music discs like I was baking for the armored
Forces, hiding like Osama with a lot of endorsements
But I don't endorse them, mama been taught me
That life would be exciting with the bottoms of a bucket
Rising to an height of unbelievable perfection
I'm higher than a kite and never falling to a muppet
Watch as I recite an uncompleted composition
Then switch the bigger significance; and kill them with the spirit
For a throne that was meant for me, don't make me trip
Ya'll came to get crunk, so, put a song in your hip, now, planet, get crunk...

If I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...
I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...

Well, the spelling of the name be B - O Jangles
Raised within Decatur where these thieves go hang you
Moved to Lithonia where the bulldogs reign
Black and gold be the colors so, what all ya'll saying?
I'm a soul from another planet, all ya'll lame
With your golds and your feathers but it now shall rain
Cause I'm known to be gutter, in the fog, I'll stand
In a zone where there's nothing but a tall light beaming
Clean in the scene is an image so raw
You just tremble and begin to feel a feeling so awe-some
'Cause I'ma kill them like the people did my Jesus on the cross
Just to quick-i-ly diminish this and end up at the crossroads
R - O - A - S - T -ing the game
And solve a problem by the moment I put me in the game
And by the power that am holding with no cheese and no chain
I'm the highest scoring leader and believe it's no game...

'Cause I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...
I got ya'll tangled, Mister Bojangles
And my rapping's okay because I'm coming from the 'A' dude...
Bojangles, Bojangles, it's okay because the flow, I's handled...</pre>
