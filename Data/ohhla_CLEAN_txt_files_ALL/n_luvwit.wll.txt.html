[Chorus: Chamillionaire singing]
Big Swangaz and Vouges
Them 20 inches sittin low
We Ball 24's 7's all that we know
Screens and neon lights gon show
When my trunk unlock pop and show
Ya already know
Paint drippin off the door
Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with em no!
You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before
I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough...
I"m in love with my money... mmmm

[Paul Wall]
Hold on hold up a second man
I never mack to a metro dame
You better respect the game
See my gecko chain and correct ya brain
I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain
Followed the wheel and I got aroused
swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame
Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac
The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat
I act a rat, cuz I'm from the gutter
ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya
You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall
is the reason she won't give sex to ya
Why all that plex in ya
Cuz a german company made my rims
My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz
Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames
I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name
Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain
Everytime it rains, paint drips and leaves a stain and I get the blame
My TV's are the pet I train I can make em roll over and play dead
My car was blue on the freeway
but when I stopped at the light it changed to red
You betta re arrange ya head thinkin I trick my cash to a broad..
Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard
And thats so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud
I shine like a blasting star, pushing a car more blacker than tar

[Chorus]</pre>
