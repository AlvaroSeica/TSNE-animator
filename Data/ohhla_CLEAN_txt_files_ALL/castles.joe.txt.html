[Intro: Joe Budden]
Some things need to be said
So why not say it, uh
Only say this one time
Just once, just listen
Check this

[Joe Budden]
My castle started shrinkin, somethin's gotta give
Ended up bein the smallest place that I had ever lived
One of the reasons I would do away with fame to say the least
Don't know who these people are (and) their names ain't on the lease
It's a different type of monster, entertainment is a beast
Was supposed to eat together, then I became the main feast
If you're preyin on my kindness, takin advantage of Joe's cool
I'd have to ask what's your definition of soul food
I bust my ass for my whole life and I worked hard for my profit
And envy I know cuts like a knife so you probably work hard to stop it
If you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic?
You know I'll cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket (word)
A pretty good judge of character, maybe I mistaked a few
Cut some people off, but had no choice, it's what they made me do
Why would you take advantage when it's somethin I'd have gave to you?
And in the long run, it doesn't take from me, it takes from you
You'll probably tell me I'm a fucked up nigga
You got it wrong, I just won't be fucked up with ya
Which forces me to get distant, and I never wanna act a way with you
But passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical
No longer enable you (nah) that's no longer favorable (nah)
But pride is on your sleeve so you'll just act like nothin phases you
Which can never equal good in fact
So love can't be lost, I know exactly where I put it at

[Interlude: Joe Budden]
Word, got no problem with nobody though
Just have no problem with me, figure
It's no beef, no malice
I got no vendetta with y'all
So I only want better for myself
Might even want better for y'all

[Joe Budden]
My castle started shrinkin (word) I tried my best to fight it (word)
Don't know how it happened, don't know how they got invited
Was good with cabin fever, and maybe that helped create the space
Fuck your good intentions, more concerned with what's takin place
But everyone feels entitled, made up their mind, they got a right to
My peers transformin right before my eyes into my rivals
Y'all can have the cars, you can have the clothes, take all that shit that I don't love
I'm learnin fast that recognition is its own drug
And what's worse than some of your actions bein feminine
is I got no way of knowin if your moves are really genuine
You there when it's bright, better be there when it's dark
You wasn't there for the ride, don't be there when I park
Figure I love niggaz enough to let the world come and stay with me
And I'll stay trapped in this room to keep y'all away from me
What's supposed to happen when I'm not hot anymore?
Your job rely on me bein crazy, but what if I'm not anymore?
The funny shit, them Mollies were cool when we all were doin 'em
But nobody recalled when I was the only one they were ruinin
I learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair
So +No Love Lost+, but not much is there
Déjà vu, this happened rapidly before
Every day's a constant struggle and you're a casualty of war (dawg!)
Uh, which could only equal good in fact
So love isn't lost, I know exactly where I put it at</pre>
