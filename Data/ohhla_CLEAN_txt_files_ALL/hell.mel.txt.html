"What the Hell?" {*4X*}
"What the.." {*4X*}

[Hodgy Beats]
I ain't been home in a week
Barely been to Pasadena since them San Fran streets
I stayed at night at the studio, I get no sleep
My passion for this music yo it's far too deep
I rest for 3 hours a day, 4 and a half if I'm lucky
4:45 in the mornin and I'm the only one up see
I'm all about the hustle, Hodgy 'bout his grind
And y'all no longer struggle once you make up your mind
I had up my mind and now I'm takin the time
Steady niggaz takin from mine, I record in outer space
Spendin time, lendin rhymes
Out and hand mixtapes to a fan giving and gettin grams
Odd Future shinin S.P.F. sunscreen
Needs to be applied to burn from sunbeams
Teach a lesson if haven't learned from one's schemes
Mankind wouldn't be realistic if no one dreamed
Yeah~!

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I got, I got - anime on the screen
I got, I got - pen in hand, scripting dreams
I got, I got - a rich man said to me
Just remember one thing you'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time {*3X*}
"What the Hell?"

[Hodgy Beats]
I knew it; momma I knew it
One wish every birthday candle before I blew it
Son carved the paths out but I drew it
Sicker than the flu I'm on my stew shit
Just let it simmer and brew, with no remembering you
We fall out in the winter, September, October, Novembering you
No contendor with you, I'm like tendering food
Zip-Lock marinate it, cook it if you care to take it
There's time now to bake it, momma show me how you make it
Bring me to life with them icing covered knives
Single handedly raised us, sacrifice and had to fight
for pages to raise us, loveres is what made us
Today trust we always got steel
I'll proceed to protect if I'm goin shot kill
I'm the star, twinkle twinkle
Thanks for every birthday you lit candels for cake sprinkles
Uhh

[Chorus]

[Left Brain]
Yo
Yo what the fuck is an interlude - anyway?
What the fuck is an interlude for man?
What the hell do you need a fuckin interlude for man?
Fuck that
Just play the next song</pre>
