[Intro: Troy Ave]
See now I went to the club and I ran into this girl
And she was tellin me 'bout how she feel and eevrything
Her name was New York but she said Troy listen

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' new shit pumpin you make us so proud
We've been wantin somethin this good for awhile
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo' waist
And you know, she like my style she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved she knows
I came so far from dealin blow, been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody 'round who sound like this, we ain't the same they rode that dick
Fuck them lames get down with this, pop champagne girl shake yo' hips

[Verse One: Troy Ave] 
Wife beater with the cake (Cake)
She got the long hair ain't nothin fake (Fake)
All blue thong with the stars all on it
Layin in my bed and she all on it
Rewind back before I grind the cat
Two steppin in the club with my dogs all strapped
There for dough, playin with the bitches
A flashy young nigga before we took the pictures
I can take ya number can't be yo' man (Can't be yo' man)
But you can act like it in ya Instagram (In ya Instagram)
I like flippin grams and you like me
And if you into gettin money baby you like me
(Come on) I'm out here sound the alarm
I heard one good girl is worth a thousand whores
One good song is worth a thousand tours
So before I leave, proceed with yo' boy

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' new shit pumpin you make us so proud
We've been wantin somethin this good for awhile
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo' waist
And you know, she like my style she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved she knows
I came so far from dealin blow, been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody 'round who sound like this, we ain't the same they rode that dick
Fuck them lames get down with this, pop champagne girl shake yo' hips
Hips! Hiiiiiiippppppsssssssssss!!!!!

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Shorty got a thing for me it's only right that I slide with her
Spoiled with money ice and your a G it's the same
Poppin like I'm celebratin spend a week in the pane
Next two cities I'm a sleep on the plane one time for keepin it real
Still in your heart where you stayin
Lift yo' feet up like the marksman I aim then leave 'em
Two times for any non-believers, now we even
I think your run is a public a lineup out of the seasons 
You're beside me for a reason 
Come check the breeze nout with the flyest nigga breathin
Everything here is mine for keepin 
I see your reachin you want the vibe back
Bodies on my N.Y. hat gotta be in my palm rap still catch a contact
Chill, gather yo' mind back
We in from the gutter babyhard to outshine that
New faces every morning I recover
Feelin like we never knew each other

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' music pumpin you make us so proud
We've been wantin somethin this good for awhile
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo' waist
And you know, she like my style she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved she knows
I came so far from dealin blow, been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody 'round who sound like this, we ain't the same they rode that dick
Fuck them lames get down with this, pop champagne girl shake yo' hips
Hips! Hiiiiiiippppppsssssssssss!!!!!

[Bridge: Troy Ave]
It's that N.Y. sound (Check it out check it out) Oooh this that no N.Y. sound (Uh huh uh huh)
Here he put it down, for the town (He puttin it down)
I use to put them birds (That dough) In and out of town (Powder!)

[Verse Three: Troy Ave]
But look at me now, one brick at a time on the road to get mine (Vroom)
Spit up out of them rhymes now the hustle combine (Tunes)
Popped from killin these bitches I'd done stayed on my grind (Yep)
Motivated by money and puttin on time (For what)
To get busy these other niggas beneath me
They callin me young Jay they call me the new 50 (Aight)
Call me what you want except broke let's talk (Hello)
Who the fuck I'm 'pose to sound like I'm from New York (You know)
Troy Ave got the streets in a frenzy though (He alone)
I brought the spotlight back you should thank me no? (Right or wrong)
And if you don't then we know you a hater bro
A +Playa Hater+ Biggie quote (Baby!)
I'm on the radio baby e'ryday that's my word
I restored the feelin I kept up my word
The new sheriff in town the truck is open
BSB roll with us or you get rolled over

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' music pumpin you make us so proud
We've been wantin somethin this good for awhile
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo' waist
And you know, she like my style she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved she knows
I came so far from dealin blow, been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody 'round who sound like this, we ain't the same they rode that dick
Fuck them lames get down with this, pop champagne girl shake yo' hips
Hips! Hiiiiiiippppppsssssssssss!!!!!</pre>
