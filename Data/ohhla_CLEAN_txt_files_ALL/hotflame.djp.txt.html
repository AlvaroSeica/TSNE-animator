[Intro]:
Right! Sometimes man I be thinkin, what the fuck?
These niggas 'gon tell me, what to do

[Chorus]:
You can't tell me shit bitch I know everythang
A Young'n, yet a mother fucker throw this in the game
Don't you speak my name, you catch hot flames
I let y'all niggas know that I'm bustin
Like I don't be sippin loud, trippin and cussin
Can't tell me shit bitch I know everythang
A Young'n, yet a mother fucker throw this in the game
Don't you speak my name, you catch hot flames
I let y'all niggas know that I'm bustin
Like I don't be sippin loud.....

[Verse One]:
What you tryin to get mad?! Fuck nigga I pull the shiny trigger
I, plot more fuckin schemes than you be richer
I'm smart and quicker, suave more better, clever for cheddar
Playa whatever, if you come to the hammer or leather
Got me in the mix to just the flip shit captain
Like allergic reaction of pollen 
Necks soon be snappin from undercuts
Stupid nigga, copped a Lex and a mansion think he ballin
+Year Round Records+ hit the streets and these bitches is callin
Callin god damn shawty stalkin my fam, I think she know who I am
In the bright lights which I lower my sight
I keep it focused on the surge for the 'fetti, pistol poppin in Chevy's
I kinda figured that these boys weren't ready
I got the region man I'm winnin in season, rejectin advice
Come at me right, my prices is tight, I'm breathin tonight
Khaleel's the type that you can't trust in the game
Stuck with the name stuck with the fame can't tell me a thang

[Chorus]:
You can't tell me shit bitch I know everythang
A Young'n, yet a mother fucker throw this in the game
Don't you speak my name, you catch hot flames
I let y'all niggas know that I'm bustin
Like I don't be sippin loud, trippin and cussin
Can't tell me shit bitch I know everythang
A Young'n, yet a mother fucker throw this in the game
Don't you speak my name, you catch hot flames
I let y'all niggas know that I'm bustin
Like I don't be sippin loud.....

[Verse Two]:
Say you can blame it on the satellite my information stay heavy
Them young'n got game, don't weigh much but they weigh heavy
Know what I mean, get drafted by teams then sharpen they game
Say man my papa was a gangster pimpin taught me the slang
I hit the middle lane this man like electric 
hit hard 'cause I'm so excited I got my own plans
Better protect your chest and your home man 
Or leave me 'lone man, move along man, for this rebel from Texas
I hold my own man, while you bake it fresh out the pan
Now it's 22 wood grain workin my hand
Fuck who I am from beginnin to endin, I'm only eatin that spinach
So no I just don't finish, overthrowin the crew
Ask who I am, who are you? A million dollar youngster with bars of baking soda
Exceed my quota, shit nigga just to sbiff on my odor
Just 'cause you older that don't make you better
2010 like my unguarded open treasure
Man I'm wilder and freeer than ever YOU CAN'T TELL ME SHIT BITCH!!!

[Chorus]:
You can't tell me shit bitch I know everythang
A Young'n, yet a mother fucker throw this in the game
Don't you speak my name, you catch hot flames
I let y'all niggas know that I'm bustin
Like I don't be sippin loud, trippin and cussin
Can't tell me shit bitch I know everythang
A Young'n, yet a mother fucker throw this in the game
Don't you speak my name, you catch hot flames
I let y'all niggas know that I'm bustin
Like I don't be sippin loud.....
