[Bronze Nazareth Talk Intro]
Gotta do 'em right knowwhatImsayin
Hey I still miss you from time to time
You on my mind..yo, yeah, I miss that baby..
Sometime a nigga gotta look back, and see what he had
To be who he is

[Bronze Nazareth]
I miss the old shit,
Splashin the clit Spillin the oceans
by now we'd be swimming millions bank account bloated
pull ya hair from the spinal tap tidal wave floatin
bang a migraine home and watch you rain the solution
still I'm a hoodlum to a city queen
'music like the dope game, "hoes tours and cocaine
Can you remain the same?"
We separate paths and get to strayin
Sometimes I think about you through a wind draft, or old fragrance
I Thank GOD for you Like wise I wouldn't have made it
The sun was setting on my brain The pressure on my cranium
You stitched a broken man together mighta never weighed in
Put me at ease with my head in your lap at days end
Rubbin your hair wonderin where heaven had been
I was mesmerized by your almond eyes and ebony skin
Remember Bennigans? Track Five on ATLiens?
I saw it settle in, wisely accepted it was never meant
But it dawned on me one day why you were sent
I burn incense in your name and reminisce
Though I lost you young Queen it was nice to share a glimpse!
It was Peace to take minute with you!

[Phone Message from Woman] (Bronze Nazareth)
I know your black ass is not sleep
You need to get up and answer the phone! (King of Queens!)
It's Saturday,
that better be the only reason you aint answer the phone
It better not be 'cause you running around
with some chickenhead you met at fairlane
Call me back! Bye. {Hangs Up} (King of Queens!)

[Chorus]

Summers ago warm air
splashed through your hair
maybe this year
we'd be wealthy with an Au Pair
I know love is in the air
But I still can't forget
Whatever was isn't there
And I miss you like you wouldn't understand
That noted, she beautiful my black lotus
Her smile golden, meanwhile my mind hopin
Sat up nights rockin Gladys Knights 'If You were my Woman'
Told me they treated you like glass when you're a diamond to em
you found a cloud with silver lining
And I aint trying to stop your movement
the Sun was setting on our moment When we hugged I knew it
She left with our future in a U haul truck it was moving!!
Soothing nights now gone, she stayed on my mind
Visions of my face between your waist, Splashing juice on your thighs
My wolverine queen Africanized
I was hypnotized by your round hips and thick thighs
I found that distance is a conqueror of time, and read the signs
Memories unfold in the corners of my mind
Though I lost you young queen, Our moment's frozen in time

[Phone Message From 2nd Woman] (Bronze Nazareth)
(King of Queens!) Baby hey I just called to see what's going on
I'm getting ready to go to bed, so talk to you later
Goodnight, Bye. {Hangs Up} (King of Queens!)
(King of Queens)

[Movie Clip] (Bronze Nazareth)
Woman: We just better forget it, I'm sorry
Man: Comb your hair and let's split
Woman: But I can't, I been working all day
I gotta change my dress, Take a bath (King of Queens!)
Man: You smell like a field of flowers (King of Queens!)
Woman: And aint no more hot water
Man: Plenty hot water a my place (Waters of Nazareth!)

Man: I turn on my television, and see all kinds of pretty chicks just
washing, taking a bath taking a shower
but every chick I ever met said shut the door!

Woman: (laughs) ahhh when I get to know you better
