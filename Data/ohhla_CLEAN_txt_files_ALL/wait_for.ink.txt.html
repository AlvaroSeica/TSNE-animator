Song:   Wait For Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Girl you can hit me on my phone
When ever you are alone
Ready for me to come take you down
Baby girl I'm on my way
I don't mind that you play

You ain't gotta [x2]
Wait for me [x6]
Girl just make sure that you think of me
Think of me [x5]

Girl its okay
You don't need to waste no time
I wont be jealous babe
Just keep me on your mind
It ain't a crime go ahead and unwind
Nobody gotta know but me
So baby don't be shy
You know your spots
Just make sure that the door unlocked
When I walk in baby girl don't stop
Ima sit back here for a minute and watch

I'm your biggest fan
When you get tired I can lend a hand
Ima be back real soon
But till then girl you know what to do

Girl you can hit me on my phone
When ever you are alone
Ready for me to come take you down
Baby girl I'm on my way
I don't mind that you play

You ain't gotta [x2]
Wait for me [x6]
Girl just make sure that you think of me
Think of me [x5]

I know I'm running late
But here I come to help
Since you cant love me babe
Until you can love yourself
Rub yourself

It turns me on when
You show me that your comfortable
Inside your own skin
So use your mind
And baby not your eyes
And make sure you move your hips
Counter clock wise
This ain't forever, just in the meanwhile
You can call me night time
Cause I bring them freaks out

Girl you can hit me on my phone
When ever you are alone
Ready for me to come take you down
Baby girl I'm on my way
I don't mind that you play

You ain't gotta [x2]
Wait for me [x6]
Girl just make sure that you think of me
Think of me [x5]

I said you ain't gotta wait
Just pulled up feeling good all day
Sorry that a nigga had to work so long
I was up in the studio makin this song

Girl you can hit me on my phone
When ever you are alone
Ready for me to come take you down
Baby girl I'm on my way
I don't mind that you play

You ain't gotta [x2]
Wait for me [x6]
Girl just make sure that you think of me
Think of me [x5]</pre>
