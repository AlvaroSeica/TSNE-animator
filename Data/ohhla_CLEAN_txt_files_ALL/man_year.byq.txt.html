Y-y-y-yeah

[Intro/Chorus]
Bruh I see girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here; shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year, ma-man of the... bounce!
Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here; shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year, ma-man of the... bounce!

[Verse One]
Yeah, home of the party and the trees
Sunny la-land of the G's, please let a nigga breathe
Tank top, top down for the breeze
Burnt lips, got a blunt full of weed
Peace, love, enemies; nigga I ain't come for the beef
You ain't know she came for the skeet?
Got pipe for the cheeks; nigga I'm the life of the beat
Fuck that bitch, she ain't gotta eat
B-bounce for the crown, you be hatin and I still hold it down
When you round man the girls never lounge
Man I heard you a hound; bruh man, that bitch need a pound
Tip, tip, tip bounce out her gown
Hands high to the sound, uh yeah I'm the rich nigga now
Bi-bitch, I'm the talk of the town
Make a bitch run her mouth - go south for the border
Pop, pop, pop, down to the floor - bounce

[Interlude]
Uhh (uhh)
Uh-huh (uh-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

[Chorus] - 1.5X

[Interlude] - 3X

[Verse Two]
Home of the slangin on the curb
Weed cards, every corner sell herb; watch you fly to a bird
Nigga I could pitch you a curb
Let this real shit occur, make mills from a verb
Nigga cop a crib in the burbs
Nigga you ain't said nuttin but a word
Smoke something for your nerve; home of the paid on the first
Then nigga going broke by the third
Bounce for the crown; fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow
Every once in a while - I see hands in the crowds
See whites, blacks blazing a pound, ju-jumpin around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
B-b-b-bounce from the ground
High for the sound; this verse straight from the morgue
Pop, pop, pop down from the floor - bounce

[Interlude]

[Chorus] - 1.5X

[Interlude] - 3X</pre>
