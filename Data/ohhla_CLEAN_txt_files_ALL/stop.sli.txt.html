Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Stop!
Go!
Hey man I say it almost every single day
That I wanna break another bottle over someone else's head
Feelin' to hit you but we calmly step aside
Don't you care about me don't you care about you
Say!
Stop!
Pick it up!
Hey man I say it almost every single day
That I wanna break another bottle over someone else's head
Feelin' el loco but we calmly step aside
Don't you care about me don't you care about you
Say!
Stop!</pre>
