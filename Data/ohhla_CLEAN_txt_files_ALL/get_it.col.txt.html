Song:   Get It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
Yea
Yeah
Uh
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Petey started
From Carolina where niggaz spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggaz used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggaz. (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggaz, non clapping niggaz
Niggaz is real, y'all is action figures. (ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggaz GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggaz praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
So I'm slaying niggaz, yea

[Chorus]
This is for my niggaz tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggaz tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it. (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

Niggaz in the streets, no
Niggaz blessed beats
I got that priest flow, heavenly
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock
Just a figure a speech for the glock
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot. (yea)
Like our beats yo, it's hot
Niggaz laid out
Caught a fake nigga centerfield it's cause they played out
Watch our boys fade out, niggaz tryna hate
If he only knew my dick's in his dame's mouth
Just made out, came out the woodworks
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork
I'm getting real green, y'all niggaz playing on some good turf
Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God
Fuck a facade
I'm just focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I
Yea

[Chorus]
This is for my niggaz tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggaz tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it. (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

Tell em Geppettos my niggaz is ghettos with scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggaz killing niggaz in broad day on all they screams
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggaz arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggaz invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggaz left in
Slay dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yea it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break
They never wanted us to make it, yea
To my niggaz smart enough to be smart enough to take it, nigga!</pre>
