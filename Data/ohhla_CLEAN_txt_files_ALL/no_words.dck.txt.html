[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, No words at all boy
I say how could I be scared to death
When I'm not scared of death, Bitch I'm prepared to rep
Gettin fat like wheres the ref, Fuck it, Where's the tech
I'm not scared of the stares and threats
I swag hard like I swear I'm best
My shit put hair on your chest
Like a shot gun square at your chest
He first, Then I swear yall next
I come through, We fifty-two, Air ya set
I'm a hungry dude, Where my check
My wolves push through, Thirty ace threes apear on deck
I've met few that would care to step
Duck the onslaught, Where ya vest
I aint playin, I'm smear ya rep
I don't give a fuck where you rest
You buy this like gear and sex, Beer and cigarettes

[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, No words at all boy
No words at all boy

[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, How could I bow to them
My first name's Rebel, My knees not allowed to bend
It's bout bread you can count me in
My presence alone will crush stone, Aint no doubtin him
I move with a thousand men, Ex-cons fresh outta the pen
Neck charms, White powder, The Benz
Plenty fitted, Flavor styles of Tim's
Hard body let my housing in, Tell me how and when
I don't trust smiles and grins
Stress life got me down in gin, Still I'm down the wind
Ridin dirty with an ounce of stem
He mackin, Won't catch him without the M
Then I bounce before you count to ten
Chameleon through the streets, I breeze outta town and blend
I make domes spin around like rims
House Gang, Wu-Tang motherfuckers, Pop rounds for them, For them
