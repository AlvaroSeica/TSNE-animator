[Intro: Rocko]
Yeah, I keep it turned up to the max (yeah)
Live e'ry day like it's your last (okay)
Okay, okay, doin it for the streets

[Chorus]
Dis morning (what?) I woke up
Feelin like money (what'd you do?) I jumped up
Put on my Gucci's (and what?) And my hat (what else?)
Got my bag (what else?) Got my strap (yeah)
Gotta start rollin (y'know?) I was thinkin ('bout what?)
'Bout jacks and cracks and Ben Franklins
Only thing on my mind (was what?) Gettin dough (what's on your mind?)
Gettin dough (what's on your mind?) Gettin dough

[Rocko]
Only thing on my mind is (is what?) Money money money!
For some reason she just be callin my name
(Rocko, Rocko) I guess it's all in the game
Cause I always run get her, she a part of me mayne
I left the studio at 7, took a three hour nap (then?)
10 o'clock flashed, I'm right back in the trap
I been addicted to the money for more than half my life
Grew up fast, I bought a car, ain't never had a wife
Boss player type of cat, I never had a wife (why?)
I'm married to the cash, she treat her daddy right
Fuck you - what would I do, if I ain't had my muscle?
I don't know - what would I do, if I ain't have this hustle

[Chorus]

[Rocko]
Only thing on my mind - from the get-go (is what?)
Is wake up, get up, time to get dough
Only thing on my mind - is the bubble
So I can all my niggaz out the gutter
Only thing on my mind (is what?) Is to be the best
(We the best) #1, won't settle for anything less
Only thing on my mind (is what?) is do my thing
(Do ya thang nigga!) Break bread with my team
Only thing on my mind - is to stack my cash
Ball e'ry day just like it's my last
Only thing on my mind - s my kids (okay!)
So they ain't gotta do the shit that I did

[Chorus] - 2X (second time minus lib-ins)

[Rocko]
Only thing on my mind - is money money money! {*repeat to fade*}</pre>
