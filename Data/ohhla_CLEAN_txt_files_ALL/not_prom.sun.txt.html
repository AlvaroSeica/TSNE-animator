 [ Hell Razah ] 
Your not promised tommorrow
 ( You know what Im sayin )
We are livin by the bottle
 ( The pages of life turn every day )
Be careful what you follow
 ( Word up, check this one )

Guns and clips, carried by cliques, eighty six
Same shit nine six the old and young switch
Poor verses rich, wars and conflicts hit
Politics get rich off the bloods and the crips
Slaves shoot slaves, modern day Egypt
Brooklyn convicts is conned to be vics
Harassed by the cops from up the block precinct
Fugitives forever they choose to live together
Scheme to get cheddar from anybody livin better
However, the money getters follow trend setters
Wit black nine berettas now they writin jail letters
Government give us guns so we go and kill each other
Handmade drugs destroy our sisters and our brothers
Some turn thieves defeat theyre seeds and theyre mothers
Undercover cops under the cover sell glocks
A free box of shell if you miss any shots
Crack spots and hell only stops burn cells
Pale horses, evil forces, crime bosses
Weak mind double crossers cause mic forces

 [ 60 Second Assassin ]
If it dont fit dont force it
Cant mix the nine wit the Caucus
Picture the ocean without the saltness
Killas without the forfeit
Theres no time without me sixty be the last sec youll see 
Another chance to breathe so save it for some ease
Cause it be a lot of yall takin in war wit no grease
In never seen a time to be so easy for a real O.G.
Cant forget Ol D Sixty Sec back on the set killin spree
Its been a long time
No here from, check it for the well elected
Fans know Im blessed ( power moves ) yo, come and fear some
Those wit an ear let em hear somthin
No more light for a fake to live none
Heres one, careers done, here come
The analitical, political, nonsuperstitial
Biochemical blast the earth by storm words I bomb
For Korans holy bible the archer rival
The comin of the Noahs, Mahadis, Messiahs
The street vibers, the burnin of all MCs by the fire
The great instead of poles up for hire
The putnam avenue shotgun
Up they do run run run they do run run
Now my niggas around the way F.A. rock
To the far rock run sews up the block
Full of bugs get up the sucker trapped
This aint Halloween take off the mask
Lot of chumps fakin jacks
Anty up the money put it in the pot
I wanna see all this trife
Or are niggas gonna get blast fast
No hesitation cause Im on probation
Niggas think I got loot to be taken
Im in for the makin
Mouthpiece retained so therell be no vacation
Warning warning a word for the snakin

 [ Hell Razah ]
Your not promised tomorrow
( Word up yo, people dying everyday )
We are livin in a bottle
( Drugs and gunplay )
Be careful what you follow
( Open your eyes kid )
We got four individuals 
Each member come together just drop a jewel { repeat sung }

 [ Prodigal Sunn ]
It was my third day in Supreme court, accused as a murder suspect
Caught me blazin wit Tomalin in Guana projects
A young fugitive soldier but still sober ill
Over the hill still, punch a cobra in his grill
Snitches and bitches I reveal, soon to make the devil kneel
Writing his will for what, for how he got a sway pill
That will be the day that my skills enhance
Strengthen my stance no longer takin the world by chance
Only got one life to live, so I create, make, then give
Keep it active rollin massive intelligent
As the days went blood stains still remain on the pavements
Spear razor sharp, another adolescent shot
Corrupted cops, yo this shit gotta stop

Word up man, shit gotta stop man 
 ( Your not promised tomorrow )
Niggas is dying everyday 
 ( We are livin in a bottle )
When are you going to realize man  
This shit is for real out here man 
Word up man niggas got to keep their eyes open man )
Keep your head above water 
( Be careful what you follow )
Because you know why man? 
We all we got 
Thats my word man
Yall niggas dont realize it man
We all gon burn in the motherfuckin fire man
Thats word up man
Peace to all my bredderns</pre>
