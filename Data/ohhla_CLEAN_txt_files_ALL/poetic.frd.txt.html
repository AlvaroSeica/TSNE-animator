Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Any time, any place
I don't care who's around

[Verse 1]
Same court, different team
Lamar owed em, poetic justice what Fred and Kendrick Lamar owed em
As far as flowing I'm The God
Not nearly alcoholic, but they know me through these bars
I'm in Miami with some loafers
The irony in life is so far I'm getting closer
Remember slinging D that my man ordered
They getting followed by 7 D's no cam carter
I do this for my fam, more than myself basically
'Cause they got faith for me
When I'm not around they wait for me
I'm a noun, I'm a person with things with places to be
Huh, lyrically, the shit that he spit
You baby Heathcliff, you kiddin me? Arsonist
Tell Duane let's get a sequence
And I don't kill shit for free
But I do it free when Freddy go

[Chorus]
Any time (any time), any place (any place)
I don't care who's around
You want a word
Just finish mopping the floors
Please take off your shoes
You know I'm nice from the door
Any time (any time), any place (any place)
I don't care who's around
Ya'll want a word
I just finished mopping the floors
Now please take off your shoes
You know I'm nice from the door

[Verse 2]
My team sell drugs like the Duane Reid
And I hit plays like alleyups that Duane rid
So fuck with Fred you'll dread it like Lil Wayne please
P pie set of genetics, you ain't the same breed
I'm a mixtures of Bible scriptures
Married to the streets, I mean that recite it with ya
I'm the God that spit, my flow show you around
And no one need my poetry, it's just survival kit
I'm the only one that solid here
And every car got a bar I'm playin solitaire
Dreamt I was talking to Shannon and she was crying there
Getting worked up, for nothing, those were volunteers
Says she was sad 'cause where the game was at
Told er we Okay, I don't play The God play it back
But when I spit something, practice yo free-throws
Don't wanna miss nothing, Fred

[Chorus]
Any time (any time), any place (any place)
I don't care who's around
You want a word
Just finish mopping the floors
Please take off your shoes
You know I'm nice from the door
Any time (any time), any place (any place)
I don't care who's around
Ya'll want a word
I just finished mopping the floors
Now please take off your shoes
You know I'm nice from the door</pre>
