Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(I say kill it like ya
You say hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
I say arrrgghh you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it)

Fuck you starin' at, didn't know I'd be so quick to flash
Terrified by the way a basilisk come out him skin so fast
Not the first won't be the last
Barrel of my gun down the hatch 187 deep throat chokin'
Eat dis fourty-four magnum dick

Murder the bar raiser, inverted crossfader
Ash lung blastin' bum rush balls to the wall
Bitch slayer
Rainin' blood, burnin' paper
A j acksons catchin' vapors
Fuck this cage
I'll thrash you later

(I say kill it like ya
You say hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
I say arrrgghh you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it)
{*2X*}

Step to me wit dat bullshit
Like I don't know
What you're doin'
Talkin' fast lookin' shady
You can't fade me keep it movin'

Hopes that
Mo cash will help you cope
Sorry to tell ya... but it won't
How do I get out then? You don't

Can't keep this locked down
Fuck that
Watch me now, fit the crush that
Hit it once knock it down and I'm done can't.
Stop this break out get it come back.
Underground railroad
Gunclaps to sound of sirens screamin'
Count on it I'm leavin'

(I say kill it like ya
You say hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
I say arrrgghh you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it)
{*2X*}

Yeah I got that man fa show
But tell em why you had to get em though
Get em, get em

Cuz the beat bangs, cuz we came
Ta flip the oz out your sleep train
When the smoke clears
Who remains
This right here, why we claim
Outta nowhere, for keeps game
Don't go there
This the real thing
Get em, get em
Board the plane
They're watchin' me
Bullshit stains
What they want from me
Fuck that man, my philosophy
Don't take a goddamn thing
Voice in my head
Kill everything
Startin' wit dis asshole
Right next to me
Get em, get em, cuz I had to get em though</pre>
