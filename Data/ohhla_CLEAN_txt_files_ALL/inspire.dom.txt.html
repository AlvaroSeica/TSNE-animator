Song:   Inspire Me
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah, I think I hear them calling
Yeah, check it out, do me a favor

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Inspire me, to do what I do
Inspire me, so I can inspire my crew
Inspire me, cuz the last time I was inspired
It was Dirty Weaponry, and the kid was on fire
Inspire me, so I can inspire the youth
Inspire me, so I can inspire my truths
Inspire me, cuz the last time I was inspired
I impregnated the wisdom and gave birth to Tiara

[Dom Pachino]
Inspire me like them dirty rats, sneak thieving cats
I must be weak, I think they perceiving that they must be believing that
Nah, they can't be believing that they see my strength
Plus they listen to the shit I invent, nuff said, fill my clip full of lead
Empty a clip, for my troops and the feds
To my fam, you the truth til I'm dead
Remember them cold nights in the lobby starving
Robbing everything that empty tray pound revolving
I was a hoody rocker, Timb stomper, card' hardware
Rocked the same suit as my partners
I can tell you a story, like an author
Put Stephen King out of business, my story's darker
I give a stellar performance, rock shows and fuck hoes
With the same endurance, caught your informants
I'm a serious dude, just need to be inspired, need to hear something new

[Chorus] </pre>
