[Chorus]
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you

[Young Deuces]
I rep dat Ma-ma-ma-milly Bitch, aint spittin dat silly shit
Get love from the east so I head down to Philly quick
Scoop me up a bad bitch that's garauntee'd to kill the dick
I-9-5 I'm beamin out like I was Willie bitch
I call up Streetz tell him let's get it crackin'
If niggaz beefin I'ma show em what's happenin'
It's all clips no actin, and all my niggaz ready for action
We raid ya spot, have ya block lookin like Manhattan
Now where's ya captain, shit you know dem boys be clappin
I only fuck with shit that's whiter den Mike Jackson
I'm low on my product, then nigga I gets ta taxin
New School hustler got more base den Tony Braxton
Nigga I know you laughin, but nigga you gotta hear dis shit
Me im a brick, you a nick you don't compare to dis
Ya'll can get ya'll muscle on, I'm a get my hustle on
And make sure my shit bump loud like the muzzle gone

[Chorus]
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you

[Streetz]
They call me dat dude, I'm so gutter that's true
Run when the beef pop, nigga that's you
I sneeze on the beat, it's still hot, Ahh choo
Plus you can't forget the kid rep from the brew
I'm here to get my city on, rocks in da chitty arm
I'm hot I gotta admit I rip whatever I am on
Callin all gangsta's, smackin all wanksta's
Don't do graffiti but the kid will spray paint ya
Niggaz outta pocket up, I gotta pop it
Niggaz getting money, you know I gotta lock it
Market wide open for a dude like me
When it comes to getting cars dog, I'm tryna cop 3
Relax on the got damn beat, like a love seat
Niggaz hard for seven days you can call it thug week
But ya'll don't bug Streetz
Cause when it's on its Ammo dropping, vest coppin hommie ain't shit stoppin

[Chorus]
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you

[Young Deuces]
If you gone talk about it, nigga betta be about it
Claim you getting money, have my niggaz come and see about it
If I got beef then I'll snatch all yo peeps up out it
Run up on a nigga guarantee I be a beast about it
Dog don't try to move me
Come with yo squad guarantee you clapped first like niggaz in scary movies
Please respect my gangsta you won't see me creepin
Raps Krueger I'll catch yo punk ass while you sleepin

[Streetz]
For those who don't know I don't like shit stopping my cash flow
My big gaks gone blow, nigga you touch mines
I'm in da whip flyin, car quick as a bitch
I call you a bitch you actin like da heels don't fit
Get fucked up, when you come listen to our shit
Niggaz know who and who not to start with
So you betta take notice, dem boys heat holders
Pop shots in each one of yo damn shoulders

[Chorus]
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you
I bet niggaz gone Move, when I let the 2 pop off
I knock yo tube socks off I come through
You wish you could do some of the shit, that I just do
You not like me and im nuthin like you</pre>
