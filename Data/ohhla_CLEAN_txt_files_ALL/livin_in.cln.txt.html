Intro:
Boy, it's some shady times out there goin' on right now.  
Man, shit be out there, you got them real niggas and them 
fake niggas, then you got them coochie-ass niggas who say 
they down when they ain't down.  My nigga, you better get 
yourself together, boy, 'cause this shit real!

Verse 1:  JT Money
Where, I'm, from, the M-I-A-M-I
Young nigga got on, got strong, now he's too fly
'Cause of what he has in his possession
A few keys of coke and some pounds of that cest
And a flurry of hoes
Drop tops, flip-flops, ??????
Now he don't holler at the fellas
And the homies from 'round the way is gettin' jealous
So they sit back and scheme
Strapped with AK's, Mac10's and car beams
Now what you think they gon' do?
Sit in front of his crib, and wait for him to come through
So they can touch his ass
But if the nigga try to buck, they gon' bust his ass
+gunshots+ And fill him up with holes
But that's just how shit goes, when you're ...

Chorus:
{Livin' in the ci-ty}  <i and="" bad="" enough="" gettin="" now="" still="" worse="">
{Livin' in the ci-ty}  
{Livin' in the ci-ty}  <i ain="" frontin="">
{Livin' in the ci-ty}  <talk me="" quick="" to="">

Verse 2:  JT Money
Wake up to the sound of somebody screamin'
Look out my window, some niggas triple-teamin'
A nigga who ain't from 'round the way
And ass-whippin's the price you gotta pay
For tryin' to play bold
Walkin' through my neighborhood wearin' your gold
Talkin' 'bout goin' to a bitch' crib
Now you're fucked up and stuck with broken ribs
That's the way it's gotta be
If I was 'round y'all way, y'all gon' front on me!
So I look out for self
If I wanna see a bitch I'll see her somewhere else!
'Cause hoes be settin' niggas up
And at the same time, gettin' niggas touched
But so a bitch can't get me, 
I'm always packin' that thing with me, 'cause I'm ...

Chorus

Verse 3:  JT Money
Life in the fast lane should be your last game
You didn't do it but you still got yo' ass blamed
For a crime you did not commit
Have knowledge of nothin' to do with
But that description fits you, police get you
Ask you questions; no answer, he hits you
Holdin' your jaw?  That must be a mistake
Scared to speak and you're weak as your knees shake
Expressin' anger as you go to jail
Denied a phone call, no chance for bail!
Enraged in a cage as you suffer
Day by day, the wait gets rougher
You never planned on bein' an inmate
Hangin' by a string, waitin' for a court date
You struggle and fight to stay alive
Man is to survive 'till court day arrives
Step in the courtroom, beat-up and filthy
Judge takes one look, and then claims you're guilty!
Head drops.  No way to bail out 
Like the innocent brothers in the jailhouse
Now you're lookin' at 5 to 10
Yo, a nigga just can't win, when you're ...

Chorus

Outro:
This ain't no bullshit that I'm feedin' you now, this ain't no 
bait.  A nigga ain't tryin' to reel you in, or nothin'.  Y'understand 
what I'm sayin', my nigga?  'Cause when you be out here 
bullshittin', y'ass'll be outta gas.  So ya better take 
motherfuckin' heed to these words, motherfucker, 'cause 
it ain't no bullshit!  Y'understand what I'm sayin', man?
