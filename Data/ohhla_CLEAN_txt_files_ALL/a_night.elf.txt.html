[Talking]
Yeh, you wild man, you wild
That's no place to meet a nice girl
You wanna meet a nice girl you gotta go to nice places
Like church, the library, or shit
Go where I'm goin' tonight
Go to Hunt's Point boy, Hunt's Point
That's where they at, that's where they at

[Verse 1]
Started off the night right, it was me and three of my boys
down at some bar sip lil rum, feelin' kinda lonesome
Mad open off the port hole that made me wanna explode one
Figure we'll go find something to do once this nigga Dalow come
I chilled continued takin' sips, I knew I was buggin'
Cause I see this chick pass by and had thoughts ah rapin' that
nah my mind was buggin', eased up to the rump
I wanted to exchange some words with this chick
and not come off as being dumb, so I
Settle for the car a little tipsy so I stumbled
Got distracted by a horn goin' off feelin' the conscience rumble
I turned around and see my man Dalow
I peeped him call my man Isley to the car
and ask him where he wanted to go
We all hopped in, inserted some hip hop in his radio's cassette deck
Conversatin' who can have sex best
Gettin' bored circlin' the block
Talkin' about how lovely it would be right about now
to have a chick, workin' the cock
My man Eric said let's go to H-P, no doubt
We haven't even been there lately, yeh we out
I said, I'm gonna have a bitch drinkin' my babies
My man June said you crazy
Nowadays these condoms'll dead the AIDS B
So we hopped on a major D (detour) and
Tip of my joint buck wid pre-semen
Ready and willin' and heavily breathin'
Anticipatin' the moment as we hopped on across Bronx
My man June was singin' along til Ikinelli tossed him a blunt

"Looked her up and down and said, hmm-mmm I'll take her"

[Verse 2]
We finally get to the area
Seen a blonde black chick wid a fat ass
Lustfully sayin' I'll take care of ya
Tell her to get close to the car so we can get a good step at her
She pulls false teeth out her mouth
tellin' me just get prepared for ya?
The sight made my joint go down
My man Isley said make a left on this corner
I'ma show y'all where to go now
Some next chicks suckin' some next dick
We see her face is bangin' so we're tryna find out if the rest is
She steps up, get a good glimpse of her breast-eses
Pulled her shirt back down
reaches for the door handle then exits from out the vehicle
Tellin' her home gal, here we go we got some customers
I said, how much would it be for up-in-yas?
So we started negotiatin' prices
I said chill what if you 5-0, and you tryna arrest me
Let's see some titties or somethin'
Bitches physical frames was pumpin' they said
Let's break it up yo them niggaz seem to be frontin'
I said yo, if you show us somethin' it's on
She flashed a left breast
Had us open askin' if she accepts checks
Makin' em laugh, anything to get there face in the grass
She smiled slightly, sayin' that, all they accept is cash
Chargin' thirty bucks a blow, twenty if it's three sucks or more
I was broke and my man spotted me the dough
So we, parked by the curb
Three of my peeps stepped outta the car
While me and my boy where patiently awaitin' to get served
Two chicks stepped into the ride ready to get loose
I said, you gotta rock my mic correctly in order for me to produce
