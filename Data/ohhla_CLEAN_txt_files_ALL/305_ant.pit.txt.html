Typed by: Cr8tivemindz@aol.com

This my way of letting my city know
That I'd ride for 'em
I'd cry for 'em
Bust 5 for 'em
And most of all fuck it die for em...
Hey, 305...till I die (5X)

(Chorus)
Nigga
I ride for my motherfuckin click
I die for my motherfuckin click
I bust heads with my motherfuckin click
Talk shit, once my shit go click (2X)

(Verse 1)
Man I've been on the grind
1 in the head
16 in the nine
I'm extra man
The game is mine in due time
Its alright Im patient man
I know how to play my position
I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches
I know how to play with they hearts
Ive done some dumb things
But for the most
Ive played it smart
Who cares if you run things?
Cause Im as live as 106 &amp; Park
This game is nothing
But a pool of blood
With a bunch of sharks
Only the strong survive
Its do or die
Get it right
That why I roll for my peoples
Cock back, go to war for my peoples
Break bread with my peoples
Man, ill die for my peoples
Everybody knows its the truth
That why they respect everything that I do
Everywhere that I go
Every friend every foe
Every bitch every hoe
Man I sold it all
From the weed to the X
From the X to the blow
Mark my words, Im next to blow
P to the I I
To the T T
To the B B
To the U
Double the L
Me, Ima sell like ice cream in hell
This for my peoples
That's locked up in jail
Ima succeed
I'm never gon fail
Papo just watch me

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Man I'm watchin the game closely
Uncle Luke that man did coach me
He taught me the who, what, wheres and whys
How to cross T's
How to dot I's
Little did he know he created a monster
Pitbull nigga I'm that monster
D.B. them chicos is monsters
Lil Jon that niggaz a monster
Everybody in the clique is well equipped
Ready for Pit to take over shit
This here is not a game
This here is our lives
We cant fuck this up
We gotta get it right
If you with us and you ready for war
Then lets ride
Lets show how we do in the south
Kick in they door
Run in they house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck it, put the gun in they mouth
Follow me now
All these bitches wanna swallow me now
All these niggaz that I don't even know
Wanna holla at me now cause they wanna be down
But fuck 'em man
Me, I'ma turn it up a notch
To my hustlers
Be careful when they murder in the blocks
To my killas
Be careful when you burnin up the glocks
Last thing you wanna be is runnin from the cops
Pits gon take it from the bottom to the top
Haters can hate but it ain't gon stop
Everybody knows I'ma blow
Just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock

(Chorus)</pre>
