Typed by: dsgbwils2@aol.com

[Chorus]
In the club tryin to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall
That's all, babygirl that's all
18 for the whole nine-five for the half
Came up in the hood sellin fifty dollar slabs
That's all, playboy that's all

[Verse]
When them bottles start poppin girls start jockin
The girl so fine that I took the chick shoppin
Deuces on the old school smokin on the dro fool
Know that it's a hit, my voice done hit the pro tool
Gucci mane frank nitty got it like
That never seen a chick wit a body like that
Shawty actin feisty too damn sheisty
Get wit Gucci mane baby you be so icy
Can't lie baby girl you fine ass hell
Will I hit it in the first date time will tell
Baby says she like the way the top drop back
Never thought my home boy girl a jock like that
40 on the bracelet back to the basic
A mill worth of ice in these playa haters faces
A mill worth of ice Gucci mane good gracious
Got a sick flow and I think it's contagious

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I ain't wit that flexin cat he investing
Tell these playa haters to check my Bds Benz
Like Yao Ming man my money staked tall
I deal for a half a mill nigga that's all
See a bad broad Gucci mane ill buy
The same dude you shop wit I'm his supplier
Gucci Gucci Gucci yours truly that's me
Hood rich or cocky I just might be
Wit my chain so bright Ray Charles might see
More ice on me than a game of hockey
If you want a mean dick you can ride in my six
Suck a good dick then I'll get your hair fixed
Gucci brake bricks down used to sell fifties
Watch on my wrist man it cost a buck fifty
King of the city Gucci mane Frank nitty
I'll gives a bitch a dove if she let me touch her tities

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Gucci Mane make you look like you posed to look
Gucci shoes Gucci fit and a pocket book
Let you party like a rock star, ride in a boxcar
Have you gainin weight everyday eatin lobster
All you friends invited so you can bring a partner
Gucci in the hood sellin weed like a doctor
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house cause I'm always doing shows
Teamed up wit big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash road, flat shoals represent that
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy
Is it hot in here nigga or it's just me
Have you at south beach falling of Jet Ski
Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees
In Biloxi we could spend a hundred gees
I'll play the ??? You can get the slot machine

[Chorus]</pre>
