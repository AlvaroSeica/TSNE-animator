(Listen Carefully)

[Intro: Trife Diesel]
Yeah, Poof nigga, Vamoose, Your wack to me
Casualties, All you weak emcees get slapped for free
Word up, T.M.F., Theodore, Criminal Grind
Uhh, Phenom the Don, You know how we do it
Mental Instruments, Let's get em

[Trife Diesel]
Ayo, Ayo my rap style's bizarre like Hendrix on a guitar
Getting lit, Blowing piff out of cherry scented cigars
Ghetto stars, Black armored cars sitting on corners
P.L. pimp'n, We some true definition of ballers
Theodore is S.G., Kryme, Tommy and me
Robbing sprees, Bob n' weave, Catch a body and flee
Cause when a Ruger pop, I could care less if it's you I shot
My name ring bells from Broad Street to Huguenot
All the way to Crime's Hill, Nigga we rhyme ill
With signed deals, T.M.F. is how I define real
I wish a nigga would try to violate fam
The lead will leave his head swollen like a prostate gland
No disrespect to the Wu, But I annihilate clans
From East coast to West coast my feet'll vibrate lands
And I spit blades of glory, Writing ageless stories
And walk the same path these rap legends laid before me

[Tommy Whispers]
Frank aint last, Nino aint last
Tony Montana, These is things of the past
Fiction, Played on the screen with a cast
You need to listen, We all got a dream to get cash
I get mine slow, You get yours fast
The Building Boys, Stapleton, Broad Street is the Ave.
Posted by one eighty-one, Them guns'll blast
We roll grass, Decorate blunts with chunks of hash
Puff pass, Blow smoke, A nigga done sold coke
Truth, British walkers, See the Hawk flip'n gold ropes
I'm old school, Twenty-eight year human pro tool
That hold tools, No rules, Fuck cops
Walk back to your block with no shoes and your socks
No jewels on your neck, No ice on your watch
Send a kite to the box and let the big kids rip you
And get Biz with a ox, shoot out your ribs with a glock

[Kryme Life]
They can't stop the bum rush, The guns bust
Charge, If you in it to win it
Word to God run hard in the race
Now a days niggas out to get that cake up
Money coming slow, Better pick that pace up
Hustlers never know, Where it all goes
Til they get caught sleeping then that ass do wake up
I'm Bo, Hit the hole like Brandon Jacob
Straight splatter a nigga, Make him pick that face up
I'm a New York Giant, Grip iron
Shit fly'n out of every direction
Eli Manning arms, You better tell your mans to come
I'll put the heat on him like a tanning salon
Hot shots, Chop rocks, Make blocks pop
The product get sold, Beat the road once I got the drop
Haters wanna catch me slipping, I think not
My strip stay clicking them yellow and pink tops

[Outro: Trife Diesel]
Poof nigga, Vamoose, Your wack to me
Casualties, All you weak emcees get slapped for free</pre>
