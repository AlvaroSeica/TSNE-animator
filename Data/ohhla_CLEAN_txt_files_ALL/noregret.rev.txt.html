[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Gotta make it through
Comin' through, gotta carry on
Word is bond
One, two, yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
Understand the style the brother bringin' from the get go
I only flow for the killa beats, beats my people love in the streets
Beats that y'all remember till you decease
Beats that make you wanna grab your piece and lick shots at the police
Beats that bring the hottest heat, fiery, scorcherous
Rapper blood drippin' from my teeth, check the ferociousness
Rollin' through, dirty deep, the way that soldiers is
We nightmares, so don't sleep, you feelin' hopelessness
Yo, I'm approachin' this with the mentality of a scarred animal
Who's in the corner during a ferocious battle
when I'm tryin' to get a handle, but it's hard
Because I gotta fight to get my album out
I gotta fight to make the crowd shout
I gotta fight to make y'all understand just what I'm talkin' 'bout
Gotta fight myself just to overcome this damn doubt
I'm lost in the wilderness, tryin' to find the right route
Before it's "Lights out!", ay yo, good night now

[Chorus x2: The Reverend William Burk]
Strugglin' for progress, searchin' for the success
Those on top tryina keep me down with the rest
But I swear until I exhale my last breath, I'mma represent to the fullest
With no regrets

[The Reverend William Burk]
I put my heart into my every rhyme, I put my soul into my every line
I put my name behind it every time, Burk Divine
My mind's a weapon, sendin' you directly to heaven
With fatal shot injections, 'Cause every (gem/jam)'s a lesson
Meant to be my profession, the truth is my protection
Along with Smith and Wesson, the Desert Eagle method
'Cause nowadays it's hectic, I try to teach on record
But ignorance embedded inside a brother's mind
(?) won't let it, but I don't ever sweata
I just hold a Beretta, she wants to shoot, I let her
'Cause I don't ever hold back on these savage barbarians
My nine will eat the beef, sham vegetarian
I try to be a good Samaritan, but as soon as you try to test
A brother like me, I'm crazy as Marylin, hip hop is my medicine
I told the priest that I'm a killer acting fashion
Stay out my section, I leave you in depression

[Chorus]

[The Reverend William Burk]
I've been doin' this for quite a while, you wanna see me fail now?
Let me spell it out for ya, N-E-V-E-R
Stop tryina defy the force, comin' from the purest source
I'mma hear the crowd's roars, and the loud applause
At the next awards, scorched like a blowtorch
With speeds of a Porsche, rhyme wars, brother actin' hardcore
But they ain't, they paid for (sites?) wearin' camouflage
Rollin' with an entourage, thinkin' that they really hard
What's the odds that every brother who talks it actually walks it
They turn it on and off like faucets, it's so insultin' to my peoples
They sorry, A.L., they tryina stop us from excelling
Yo, like what the hell</pre>
