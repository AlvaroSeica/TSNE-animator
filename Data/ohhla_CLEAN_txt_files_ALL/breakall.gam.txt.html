[Intro]
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this!
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Know what I mean, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the

[Childish Gambino]
Hollerin at this Japanese girl, Asian mami
But is it too soon for Japanese girls? Too tsunami?
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame?
Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me
(What the fuck is up?) Yeah, it's Cheezy hoe
I'm so cheesy hoe, my swag got high cholesterol
I know y'all girls, I met them all, you're her ex-man like Cannonball
I ain't got shit to say to ya, I'm known for bad behavior
Look at me; man I went to the W from Doubletree
Makin out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee
Can I live up to all this hype they have for me? It's hard to tell
But these girls I'm kissin chase the blues away like Gargamel
I'm back in the game, coach put me in, T-Pain flow, "All I Do Is Win"
With a glass full of McCallan to mess me up
And the cash we can throw at them unless we fuck
Dopeness~! After this I hit the highway
I'm headin +West+ like I'm fuckin blowin +Kanye+
Read the fuckin +News+, +Huey Lewis+ nigga
You can't go HAM, youse a Jewish nigga
Donald Glover, you don't have to call me Childish
Except for when I'm flirtin with your half-Latino stylist
Photoshoot, beach house playin Beach House, free wireless
So I can post these pictures on my website of her smilin
I kissed this girl I've liked since back when I was just a sophomore
But I'm afraid to text her "What the fuck it take so long for?!"
What the fuck has changed? Is it swagger? Is it money?
I still dress the fuckin same, and my nose is still as ugly
as the day you fuckin met me, they tellin me I'm the rapper
for these white kids; cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit
I wanna bring you back to the studio, try and get your number
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their Tumblrs
I like it when you tweet me, you smell like baby lotion
I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean
Her pussy tastes like vanilla, tasty hoe
Clown niggaz then I kill 'em, +Gacy+ flow
It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick
I'm Pryor in his last years: comedian who's sick - fuck
But I am sick; seriously
I don't feel so good, cause I don't get sleep
And I'm always travelin, and I don't go home
And my friends don't call, cause I turned off my phone
I've made mistakes, I've bumped my head
inside of this girl, inside of my bed
Whatever man, I'm just havin fun
I'm sorry that I fucked her but now you know that she's not the one
I'm doin you a favor, like every time I rhyme
or write a script or do a movie there's a million ways to shine
Choose one, instead of what you're doin tonight
"I Am Donald" comin soon, we've got all of the lights

[Outro]
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Know what I mean, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the</pre>
