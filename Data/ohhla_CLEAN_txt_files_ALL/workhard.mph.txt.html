[Verse 1]
You rise early, fall outta bed to get to the nine to five
Gotta get paid it's do or die swept in amongst the suit and ties
Peak hour traffic moving by, your stop get off and supervise
Prepared with skills to utilise Friday morning walking move aside
Huge pressure better be super wise, who am I? Working class suicide
This is for the blue collars who do the grind, tread water, scuba dive
Honest dollars now move the line, accomplished scholars, whose to thrive?
In a mutual divide? (mutual divide) In due time it'll pay off
With a new life and a safe box, you'll cruise by in the same socks
Ya too polite to ya lame boss, moonlight, tablecloth
Not tonight it's been a hard slog, Friday night knock off
You the chosen few and a boom box

[Chorus]
You work hard just to pay off them loans
With ya gas bills and ya mobile phones
And ya keep workin' till ya own ya own home
And ya won't stop, don't stop never leave it alone

Make some noise if ya love to get paid
Make some noise if ya love to get paid
Make some noise if ya love to get paid now
Make some noise if ya love to get paid

[Verse 2]
Whatcha gotta do is handle the biz, own ya own home with a wife and kids
For a slice of the pie, it's the grind and grit, you can get by over the minor glitch
Without the brick stackers, bread packers we'd be left lost
Minus the virus hackers, vet practice and a guest spot
With no tractors, janitors, managers or red cross, we'd be breathin in a season
That's seein chaos, we line up like soldiers waiting to finally step off
Friday and it's 4:59 about to knock off
Clock off, get home and bust them bloody socks off
I'm a head to dummetts barby and party with some scotch
Thirst on the brink, breaking point first drinks shake them coins
get rowdy and make some noise
Ladies night or hangin with the boys
all week employed now it's Friday night the vibe is to destroy
We humans consumin the decoy we build houses, save lives, sign contracts
This goes to the hard workers scrape them scraps

[Chorus] {2X}

Make some noise if ya love to get paid
Make some noise if ya love to get paid
Make some noise if ya love to get paid now
Make some noise if ya love to get paid</pre>
