[Chorus]
I'm on the road, dog
Got my back pack, maps and my road dogs
If you could see what we see
you would want to go where we're going just to be where we'll be
In the presence of more than a baby boy
The Lord who can save you and save me, or
Maybe if it's still not clear
Let wise men open your eyes and take you there

[Verse One]
The sky was clear that night, right?
Cold, crisp air, stars shining bright
Remember that y'all?
But there was that one star that was shining brighter than them all
I remember that star, thatÂ‘s why I called y'all
We were getting restless while we waited
For a special child with a mom highly favored
No more singing the blues
The sky signified the coming of the King of the Jews
We'd studied the script, next step was to study the trip
Packed up, ready to dip, ready to roll
Wasn't even sweatin' the cold
Convinced of Hotness, ready the gol
Hold up, don't forget the planks to anchor the tent
And with that gold grab the myrrh and the frankencense

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
It's been a minute but we're still steppin'
Still trekkin'
Can't wait to put our eyes on what our heart's expectin'
Can't wait to find the palace
Recline in the palace, sit back and drink wine from the chalice
You know they from out of town, right?
They probably down town in the Crown Plaza, not in Crown Heights
He probably got a long line waiting to see Him
I bet you even King Herod's waiting to see Him
I should give him a call, I know he can get me in
And if he hook it up we all - get in free then
Yo, I called Herod, he don't know where he at
But he said if we find Him we should call him right back
I don't trust that dude, I ain't callin' him back
Chill wit all that, you can see we're on the right track
What makes you say that?, cause the star's right there
Well if the star's right there then we must be here

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Fading in the distance
The place where all of us faced a twist deeper than the sixth sense
It wasn't what I expected to see
Someone as great as Him living lesser than me
In fact we were blown away
By a King with no bling, just a throne of hay
Even shepherds had heard of Him
Somehow they got word of Him
Wise men, herdsmen, all of us worshipin'
Anybody notice how the sheep and cows
Seem to peek and bow [down] to the sleeping child?
We went home a different way, not just geographically, but he impacted me
Never forget the day, we got to sit back
And see God's presence, a present, gift wrapped
