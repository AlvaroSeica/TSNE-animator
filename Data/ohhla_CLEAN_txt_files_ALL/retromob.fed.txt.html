[Husalah talking]
I'm in the studio let me do this song
I'ma call ya right back please
You feel me? Bitch!, nigga
Retro mob nigga,(uh uh uh uh)
Nigga we rich bitch

[Verse 1: Husalah]
Niggas on that new shit, but I'm a mobsta
A seven three Caprice big blocker, drop topper
Seven chicks too poppa, (poppa)
Comin' round the corna wid a long ass choppah
Yeh, nigga it's Husalah
I get money in the kitchen on suckas
Burn rubber on a bitch don't love her
Only thing I love is when it's time for the smother, bitch
I make music for the psychos skitzos
Thirty-six shots out the chop betta get low
Bitch ass niggas sayin' this sayin' that
But when the funk is on niggas ka-ka, smack
The projects, cocaine and gunshots
The mob is deep, from the streets to Longpark
Promise me, that ya phone is not hot
Cause I if I get knocked niggas dyin' from dumb shots

[HOOK: Fed-X]
Project gutta or the block still grindin'
Knot for knot, I hear the police sirens
Automatics startin' to click start kickin'
Guerillas in the trunk, listen to the system
Listen to the system, listen to the system
Listen to the system, listen to the system
Project gutta or the block still grindin'
Knot for knot, I hear the police sirens
Automatics startin' to click start kickin'
Guerillas in the trunk, listen to the system

[Verse 2: Fed-X]
Mobbin', back to back
Two guns on my hip so I'm strap for strap
Got a half kick of soft so I'm crackin' that
Real quick on the draw get ya blapped in ya wave cap
Niggas know the business so they stay back
And if we want it then the jacka take that
It's GT steering on mine
Swingin' in the middle of the street man this is a crime
Windows rolled up still steamin' the Bob
And all you broke ass niggas get a job
I can help you out come and work for the mob
Buy you a house a car and then ball
Huddle up ya team and tell 'em we want it all
We need it all, we get it all, we want it all
