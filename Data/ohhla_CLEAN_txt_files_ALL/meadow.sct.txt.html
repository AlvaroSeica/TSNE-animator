[Intro]
What we gon do with that boy?

[Travi$ Scott]
Fuck I lost my mind; I've been runnin' since a quarter eight
On the dirt road straight out the mo'
Flip the bird 'fore a nigga faint
Fuck moms think a nigga strung on dope
Niggas thinkin' I can't; shit you wanna know me?
Let me show your ass a little thing
Every time I walk in this bitch fresh feeling my for finna fish
She want to hold a nigga dick for the piss
To the squat for the flick, give me yo thoughts for a bit
Right, gon' hit the weed, gon' head just cough little bit
Cum in her mouth 
But the kid's loss, coulda been a good spouse

[Outro]
"Wake the fuck up baby Jack!"
Fuck, I was dreamin', "Junior, get the fuck up!"
Fuck, I cummed on my boxers, fuck; "Get yo ass up boy!"
What the fuck they want? Fuck; "Baby Jack wake the fuck up!
Get yo ass downstairs!" Shut up bitch, fuck
"Junior! Junior! Junior! What the hell!?"
I gotta get the fuck out of here, fuck this</pre>
