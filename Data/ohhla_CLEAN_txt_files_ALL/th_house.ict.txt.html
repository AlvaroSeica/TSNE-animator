[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo man, I don't like how this is going down homies
Shit is real fucked up!

[Ice-T]
You know that house down the street where the kids are
And everyday they seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on and everybody knows
Doors always shut, windows always closed
The little girl had a burn, the boy was black and blue
They said it came from play, you know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm is broke, girl is scared to speak
Their parents drink all day, couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school, and other days they might
It's hard to stay awake, after you cry all night
You see them everyday; tear tracks on their cheeks
But they will never tell, it goes on weeks and weeks

[DJ Aladdin]
But what can they do?
They're only children man!

[Ice-T]
You ain't no fucking kid, act like you give a damn!
Want someone to save these kids?
Do something, call a cop
The other night I heard gun shots!</pre>
