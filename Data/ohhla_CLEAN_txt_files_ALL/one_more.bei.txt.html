Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If we only got one more chance to get our dance on
We got more chance to get our jam on
I got one more chance to get my hands on you
Might as well do it now
Cause they playin' our song
Yeah yeah
Ooh
Yeah yeah
Ooh
Yeah yeah
They playin' our song
Yeah yeah
Ooh
Yeah yeah
Ooh
Yeah yeah

See I don't wanna waste no time
Girl let's get straight to it
To it (To it) To it (To it)
Cause this moment here may be our last chance to do it
(Do it) Do it (Do it) Do it
Ooh
That's how it feels when I'm touchin' on yo body
Lovin' on yo body like
Ooh
Yeah yeah yeah
I want it and you got it
Ain't thinkin' 'bout nobody but you
Yeah, the club is 'bout to close
Last call for alcohol
And everything is movin' slow
It's only right that I slow dance with her
Oh, oh, oh
Don't wanna miss my chance with her
Oh, oh, oh
Nah, nah, nah, nah

If we only got one more chance to get our dance on
We got more chance to get our jam on
I got one more chance to get my hands on you
Might as well do it now
Cause they playin' our song
Yeah yeah

If we only got more chance to get our drink on
We got one more chance to get our touch on
We got one more chance to get our love on
Might as well go and do it right now
Cause they playin' our song

Now this may be the last time I get to feel my skin against your skin
We may never get this again so
Would excuse me if I pulled you real close, unh
Would you excuse it?
Would you do it?
Ooh
That's how it feels when I'm touchin' on you body
Lovin' on you body like
Ooh
That's how it feels when I'm kissin' on yo body
Oh

If we only got one more chance to get our dance on
We got more chance to get our jam on
I got one more chance to get my hands on you
