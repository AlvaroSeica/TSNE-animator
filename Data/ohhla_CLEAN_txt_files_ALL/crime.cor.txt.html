Stupid...can't fuck with this (I know)
Bring your whole team kid. Yea dunn

[Verse 1- Havoc]

Yo, I love my niggas for that
We strike back, handle business
Test the realist, stay focused
And keep the, enemy near us
Niggas is careless,  slippin up
Switchin up teams, crossin over
And gettin stuck for they cream
Frontin like they skills, it superb
Got the nerve, to get knocked the
Fuck out, then kicked to the curb
Thats for you and your whole click
You roll thick, more the better, so like
A dick bitch you gettin whipped, shitted on
Scuffed off a Mobb Deep song, take your thug off
You had it on a bit too long, tuck your chain in
Your gettin yaked, for you 14 karat slum gold cubic zirconian
Ass having, talking 'bout it, being 'bout it
You ain't been doin it, so don't start
Matter fact, keep it moving
When it's on, accumulate like cancer cells
With advanced sales, leave a snitch dead 
Son he can't tell, like a Viking, we strikin
Reconstructing maps, plantin QB flags
Son we want to visualize picture, analyze
Situate another occupation, in cardiac arrest
State of mind, you must be out your motherfucking mind
Put you out of misery, short your lifetime, expectancy
Didn't even reach 23, first class shot, special delivery
No doubt you wanna lay it for at you, at your own crib
Talk out the ass, at your own risk, it wont give one fuck
Two mysterious Chevy trucks filled with black cats, crossin ya path
Thats bad luck, Everyone has a destiny, so we destine
To make the best outta life, crime connection

[Verse 2- Prodigy]

Yo, I send shots to any man who come to close
Niggas get fold like a letter, and shipped across coast
Who goes, to go against my militant crime militia
Like these street niggas sending missiles to hit ya
Up from the ground up son, you get the picture
If not write it down, take a picture
Botanical exotic shit, keep me lifted, somethin retarded
Fuckin up my high, beefin don't get me started
Too late, Iam already on ya ass, beat the fuck out anybody
With you, and anybody that grab me, 
Move back we attack like pits locked in basements
Hungry for blood, deranged this, craziest
Type a shit ya ever seen in your life
Nigga bled to death, standin up, holdin his life
Applying pressure to his wound, tryin to stop the blood loss
Found layin in a pool of the shit, his own fault
It's P the exulted from NYC, you get extremely, cut the fuck up
By scarlee to can't recognize, do I have to prove all the time
And get up close and personal in front of ya eyes
See me dipped in down-low, ready for action, crept slow
Moved on ya enterprise and crash ya stock, put a hold on your assets
And dug your pop, You National Geographic niggas is known for flippin
This animal wildlife surround me I live in, and flow through the jungle
At night on Expedition, I got a jones for that life shit, 
Survivors of block wars and crime niggas, know what I talk
In a black Tahoe, throw it in forlo, and blow the scene dancin'
Doin about a 100 all the way to Queens

[Verse 3- Cormega]

It seems, like gettin ahead, lead being dead or in the feds
I kept a glock in my shoe box under my bed
And had dreams to bag Ki's and fill duffel bags with madd G's
Parle in a condo with a warm breeze and palm trees
My projects is like a fuckin Vietnam scene
And my team be reppin, settin with shit that'll rip through vests
Flexin' Diamantes, when it's on I'll regulate shit the calm way
Yo Iam smooth like a drop top benz with fat rims
I made moves, in war gear and black tims
And layed low, cause I was tryin to stay paid yo
Pumpin minerals to criminals called Yae-yo
The drug blocks, full of unseen riches and snitches
Guns blast and cops flashin pictures,
Son askin, can he get a package
And took a loss when the new task force snatched him
9's and Tec's, my hollow-heads outlined your vests
My only fear 25 years and death.
