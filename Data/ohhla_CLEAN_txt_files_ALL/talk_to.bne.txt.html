[Krayzie - 2x]
I talk to myself (myself), when there is no one to talk to

[Tiffany]
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?

[Krayzie]
It's so hard to believe that i'm still living, i'm alive
My clock is still ticking, guessing that God is still with me (with me)
Cuz I could have been gone so many times before
Murda Mo is chasing me i'm bearly escaping it
My instincts is tellin me that I might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?
Kill 'em all
Last night I had a long talk with myself (myself)
Drama had a nigga wondering, wondering how close am I to hell
Then I had to pray can't let them brake me, awww nah, awww nah
But it's everyday they try to make me soft
But so fried, so high is my mistake
Don't worry when i'm in the clouds
Well that's how I stay (stay)

[Chorus: Tiffany]
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?
Never thought I make it this far
Kinda wonder just where you are?
Will you ever make it through the day?

[Krayzie]
Caught up in my complications nowhere to go
It's mandatory that I face them, even though I don't want to
They say karma can murda ya, murda ya
All this drama just got me nervous
Cuz I know i've popped shots that don't stop
They don't stop
Soon as I lose it they know I get stupid
Ain't nowhere to you, to you
Stop, stop, look, look, listen
Where heard them
I'm hearin they put to get me (get me)
Can't let 'em get me
I won't stop dumpin until my clique is empty (empty)
When this one finish (finish) i'm buckin 'til I put my other clip in (clip in)
Then get up spittin back at y'all (back at y'all)
That's cuz the can't get with this at all
The war is really raw (raw, raw, raw, raw)

[Chorus: Tiffany]

[Krayzie &amp; Tiffany]
(Last night I had a long talk with myself)
And I told myself I can't depend on one
No one else

[Krayzie]
Crazy, crazy this thing done made me crazy
Hate to say it, I done went crazy {2x}
Walkin in the rain (walkin in the rain)
Disaster calls my name
Callin my name feelin so much pain
Wanna get away but ya can't, can't run, run, run

[Chorus: Tiffany]

[Krayzie]
I talk to myself (myself) when there is no one to talk to {2x}
Walkin in the rain (walkin in the rain)

[Tiffany]
Last night (myself) I had a long talk with myself, self, self
Will I ever (myself) make it through the day?

[Chorus: Tiffany]</pre>
