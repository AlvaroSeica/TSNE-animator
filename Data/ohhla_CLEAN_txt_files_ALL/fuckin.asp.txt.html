{If findin somebody real is your fuckin problem}
{{Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it}}

[A$AP Rocky]
Hold up; bitches simmer down (UGH)
Takin hella long bitch, give it to me now (UGH)
Make that thing pop, like a semi or a nine
"Ooh baby like it raw" with the +Shimmy Shimmy Ya+ ha?
A$AP (YEAH) get like me (UGH)
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me (YEAH)
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me (UGH)
Put that chrome to your dome make you +Sweat+ like +Keith+
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Gettin figures, and fuckin bitches, she rollin Swishers
Brought her bitches, I brought my niggaz, they getting bent up
off the liquor, she love my liquorice, I let her lick it
(ALRIGHT) They say money make a nigga act niggarish (UGH)
But least a nigga nigga-rich!!
I be fuckin broads like I be fuckin bored
Turn a dyke bitch out have her fuckin boys
Beast

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Hoe I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggaz you've been leadin on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin on
Got a feelin that's the same dudes that we speakin on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin read-along
Ain't a fuckin sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then just... (okay, okay, okay)
Then just, drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin from a nigga I don't know then I don't trust it
If you comin for my head, then muh'fucker get to bustin
Yes Lorrrrrd! I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin
I beast

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah hoe, this the finale
My pep talk turned into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the Valley
Now vacay'd in Atlanta then she goin back to Cali
Mm~! Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein me like a nigga don't exist
Girl! I know you want this dick!
Girl! I'm Kendrick Lamar
A/K/A Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mm, kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Halle, Berry, halle-lujah
Holla, back, I'll, do ya
Beast
