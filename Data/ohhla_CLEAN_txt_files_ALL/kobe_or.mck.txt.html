[Intro]
Stop!

Mackie Ray Cyrus
Tell molly holla at me

[Interlude]
Throw it back like you don't fit it like you owe me
If you bout that life then baby girl show me
Bitch I ball hard like Kobe or Ginobili

Now bring it back like you fit it like you owe me
Bitch I ball hard like Kobe or Ginobili
If you bout that life and baby girl show me
This ain't a game shawty, no this ain't Ginobili

[Verse 1]
Now this ain't sicker baby, and I'm a street fighter
But I ain't viga baby, and I ain't blocka eat her
I know you like them purses
And if your man disrespect the rich game
Then I'm a soon that he lack them hurses
You know your sister, she been a freak girl
She's been givin that pussy up before she learned had the right incursive
She been nasty ever since she was younger
In the winter, in the spring, in the fall, in the summer
She pop it off, and when she ride around like the stripper the top is off
So look when I see her, I just holla I'll pop it off
I'll pop it off, I'll pop it off
For me and my fucking love
Yea I ain't tryin' to see you baby when you're blaze
After I twap em a pass you ask to Farid
And then I'm a let Sean hit em, then I'm a let Boo hit it
Then I'm a call the rich game and let the whole crew hit it

[Interlude]
Now look, throw it back like you don't feel it like you owe me
Bitch I ball hard like Kobe or Ginobili
Ain't a game baby girl it ain't Ginobili
If you bout that life and baby girl show me
I hit you with that 9 to 5, show me what you're burkin with
I hit you with that ten or six, show me what you're working with
I fuck around and do overtime what you're working with

[Verse 2]
Shawty what you're workin with, shawty what you're working with
I see you when your earn men's fit, but you're all broken shit
Now you got some lute, yeah that shit back you
But hop yo ass in this coupe, and coming break it off
Yeah, break it off, this rubber baby don't take it off
I need it all like right now, yeah pop it off
For me and my dog, yeah pop it off
Forget your nigga I got his life in my wallet
Me and you could do it big like Christopher Wallace
I can have you on the beach willin, happy you met me
And you can ride me in the water, like a jet ski
I fuck around and put this fish up in your booty
And don't take it out until they free my nigga Boosy
See I'm a New Orleans nigga til I'm gone
Bitch I'm a New Orleans nigga til I'm gone
If you can't get it right, then I'll do you wrong
I eat the cheetah thong, go for me alone

[Interlude]
I'll make her bring it back, like it don't fit her she owe me
Bitch I ball hard like Kobe or Ginobili
If you bout that life then baby girl show me
You bout that life then baby girl show me
What you're working with, yeah, what you're working with
I'll get you with that nine or five, that ten or six what you're working with
Yea what you wokin with
Show me what you're workin with

[Outro]
Now pop it off for my dog, pop it off for my dog
Pop it off for my dog, pop it off for my dog,
Now fuck me good like I just came home
Now fuck me good like I just came home. </pre>
