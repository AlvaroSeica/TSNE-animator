[Eightball talking]
Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said "Hey, ain't you Eightball?"
I said "I'll be whoever you want me to be"
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme

[Hook - Eightball] 2x
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear "I know you like this"
She said "I'm ridin wit'chu" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho wanna kick it
Get down lick it, cuz I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy

[Chorus] 2x

[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

[Chorus] 4x

[MJG whispering] 4x
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
