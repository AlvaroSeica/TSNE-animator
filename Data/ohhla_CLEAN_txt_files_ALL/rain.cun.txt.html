[Mr. SOS]
The saddest thing I ever learned is relationships don't last
Or maybe I just feel that way cause of my past
Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey
feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me
I'll still see something that reminds me of her
I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur
She found somebody quick. I won't find another for a while
She was about to be my wife and mother of my child
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
and the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
like everything's changed and suddenly you don't trust her just the same
then you find out some other man's been fuckin out her brains
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
so much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you Literally go insane
and you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

[Chorus]
Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today"
Crackled on the speakers
Trickle down the sleepy subway train

[Mr. SOS]
I'll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man
and turn around and have sex with another man
I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand
than to get interrupted and get a call that she's touching hands
with another man. Oh God! Another man!
I can't even cry. My tears been dry. That's why it's thundering
hard out tonight and it's dark and it's cold
Cause the angels can hear me cry, and it's all in my soul
and all of them know I've never felt this pain in my past
And it's ironic the first place we made love's the same as the last
In the shower ... that's why I put the rain with her name
And my power to trust someone again has faded away
Other girls want me? Tell em it looks like rain today
I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made
And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades
The day I almost gave up everything that I gained
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
and the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
like everything's changed and suddenly it's on tape and you crumble
cause you notice on the tape she doesn't kiss you, she just fucks you
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
so much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you Literally go insane
and you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

[Chorus]</pre>
