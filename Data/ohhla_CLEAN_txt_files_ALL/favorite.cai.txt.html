[Chorus] 
I wanna be your favorite song 
You can turn it up, play me all night long 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

(Common) 
We on our way back, we wanna play back 
We want some new plus o never change that 
We got a new tip, good music 
We see the pen and the paper, we gon use it 
It takes a late night, to get them bright lights 
We keep writing them songs, still in that good life 
I do it for you, I do it for me 
We break it down, Colbie, tell them the story 

(Colbie Caillat) 
Listen can you hear me 
Am I coming in on your frequency 
I got a story 
Subject that apply, you and me 
And when you're sleeping, and when you awaken 
And when you're feeling good 
I'll be the thing you want to sing back 
Stuck in your head like I knew you would

[Chorus] 
I wanna be your favorite song 
You can turn it up, play me all night long 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

I wanna be your melody 
Flowing through your head, when you think of me 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

You'll be singing like 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Turn it up) 

(Colbie Caillat) 
Baby can you feel me 
I'm the kick drum that gets your heart to beat 
I gotta help me feel me 
You can count me in every song I sing 

And when you're sleeping, and when you awaken 
And when you're feeling good (Feel good) 
I'll be the one that you want to comeback 
Stuck in your head like I knew I would 

(Common) 
We on our way back, we wanna play back 
We want some new plus o never change that 
We on our way back, we wanna play back 
Play back play back play back play back 

[Chorus] 
I wanna be your favorite song 
You can turn it up, play me all night long 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

I wanna be your melody 
Flowing through your head, when you think of me 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

You'll be singing like 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Turn It Up) 

(Common) 
You're the songs you sing 
Play my favorite things 
You stay in my dreams 
Something is lookin supreme 

Love is the key, and it's made your life see 
Common and Colbie, I'm dusting off the homie 
Like the OLB we call it ODs 
And in your melodies, I'm hearing things you never told me 

We stay in tune with each other, and our room will discover new ways to do 
Covers, no matter how they dub us 
We should stay true to the trust, and the winner of the best duoÂ is us 

[Chorus] 
I wanna be your favorite song 
You can turn it up, play me all night long 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

I wanna be your melody 
Flowing through your head, when you think of me 
I wanna be your favorite song 
La la la la la 

You'll be singing like 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Turn It Up)</pre>
