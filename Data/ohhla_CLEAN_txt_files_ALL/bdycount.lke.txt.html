[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Timbo, hey, right, right
J, huh, yeah, yeah
This what we do
I know y'all been waitin, but

[Timbaland]
Hey girl
I bet you I'll talk you right out out out them them them them drawers
I bet you I'll talk you right out out out them them them them drawers
I bet you I'll take you right out them them them them them drawers
Hey JT, sing that shit, as I... pause

[Justin Timberlake]
I was a boxer 'til I knocked that, out
I played a doctor 'til I made that, house... call
I had a shy little quiet girl but now she sings opera, loud
But my train is on yo' track, now
Uh, so watch out

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I'm gettin my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want, hey
And by the end of the night when you hot like a light
It'll be cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on, then you already know, c'mon
"Help me, I'm goin down," that's what I hear her say
Baby my body count, is blowin up all the way, hey
Sign up, put your name down, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count

[Timbaland]
Hey girl (hey girl)
I bet you I'll talk you right out out out them them them them drawers
I bet you I'll talk you right out out out them them them them drawers
I bet you I'll take you right out them them them them them drawers
Hey JT, sing that shit, as I... pause

[Justin Timberlake]
That's what I'm talkin, 'bout, waitress 'til she got that, tip
Haha, sail until I sunk that, ship
Yeah I had a hot little fire girl but now she just smoke that's, it
And I ain't gon' stop 'til I get you out on top of this list

[Chorus]

[Justin Timberlake]
Make my body count, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
Sign up, put your name down, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count...

Make my body count, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
Sign up, put your name down, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
Sign up, put your name down
I'll make your body count, until you say (heyyy)
C'mon, sign up, put your name down, make my body count (make my body count)
Make my body count (make my body count) make my body count 
"Help me, I'm goin down," that's what I hear her say
Baby my body count, is blowin up all the way, hey...
"Help me, I'm goin down," that's what I hear her say
Baby my body count, is blowin up all the way, hey...

Sign up, put your name down, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
Sign up, put your name down, make my body count
Make my body count, make my body count
