[INTRO]
Ooh
How could you forget me, Forget all about me
How could you forget me, Forget all about me

[VERSE 1]
Y'all remember me from back in the days
The wrestling' O.G. Randy Savage don't play
Been chillin' in da cut but I'm back on the scene
I'll still kick ya butt cuz I'm still real mean
I'm comin' wit da heat so don't try to stop me
Refuse to get beat so y'all can't top me
Still got the fury still got the fire
The best til' I retire cuz that's my desire
But now I flipped the script I'm rappin' on the mic
But don't get it twisted I'm always down to fight
Cuz it's in the blood to pass on the legacy
Macho Man from the school of hard knocks remember me

[CHORUS]
Remember Me I'm the same ol' Macho that I used to be
Ain't nuthin' gonna change so remember me la la la la
La La La La La La La La
Remember Me I'm the same ol' Macho that I used to be
I'm still the reining king so remember me
For those who forgot I still rock I still rock, remember me

[VERSE 2]
Bow down pay homage or the price you'll pay
I've been the king of the ring since back in the day
Beware I'm warnin' U to stay outta my way
Cuz I'll have ya runnin' scared like a castaway
The M's cuz I push it to the maximum
And the A's for the aura that they try to become
The C's for the champ 6 times I became
And the H is for honor I'm in the hall of fame
The O's for OOHH Yeah cuz I'm so outstanding
The M's for Macho I'm the last man standing
The A's for anytime anyplace we can go
And the N's for Notorious the one Macho, remember me

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
Ya can't forget me the 6-time champion
Some call me Randy some rather call me Macho Man
Back in 88 I won the world title
Controlled my own fate it was all about survival
Remember Trump Plaza in Atlantic City
That's where I took the belt and didn't take no pity
Remember the Silverdome up in Motown
93,000 strong I came to put it down
Been gone for a minute but now Macho's back
No time to be timid I ain't takin' no crap
I was the bad boy of this whole wrestling game
Ya haven't seen me for a while but y'all remember the name

[CHORUS 2X]
(So) Remember Me I'm the same ol' Macho that I used to be
Ain't nuthin' gonna change so remember me la la la la
La La La La La La La La
Remember Me I'm the same ol' Macho that I used to be
I'm still the reining king so remember me
For those who forgot I still rock I still rock
Remember me

How could you forget me
Forget all about me
How could you forget me
Forget all about me
How could you forget me
