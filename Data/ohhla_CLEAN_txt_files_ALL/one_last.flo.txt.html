Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Nod your head like, yes no
We be givin' out love like x o
A'kissin' and a'huggun' on the big fat flow
Cat's got game
We got tic tac toe
If that's so get that dough
Do re mi fa so la ti
Bring back dough
We rock the party for the riff raff
Show you how to get into it like a pistachio
Cut a rug exacto

One last show for the lonely souls
You are everywhere we go

Move like a worker to the pole, mayday, gala
Move like a movelikea earth to the sol, de la
Move like a zombie, fela
Move like a robot, re-root data
Move like a Muppet, hands on sticks
Move like a clock, hands on six
Move like a bandit with a handgun fix
Move like a fan get your hands up quick like this

Levels la main

Oh we came to save the night
We're trying to do what's right
We're trying to get by
Oh the circle has no sides
But at the end of the day
We're trying to change our ways

Cuidado, cuidado, danger, danger
In private or in general we major, major
Put the hands up
And rattle sabers mazoltov
Gettin' cats up
Like tomato sauce, yup
Comes to moving solo
Get my Boba Fett on
Colors of our struggle has more hues
Than Langston
From Don Cheadle to Beelzebub
Raise your hands and keep 'em up
Aluminum posse
Fluid as fosse
Moving from thoughts
Truant apostles
I'm painting pictures with my tongue brush
Raps tight like mumra
Needs lines supplied
We provide like UNRA UNRRA
Recharge like stun guns crumpin'
From dew until dark
Doin' the whoop
Doin' it proper
Hakuna Matata

It goes peace in the middle east
Peace in the middle east
Just an expression, but we sing in literally
Really we wanna move feet like little league
But diddly emcees get the boot like Italy
Peace in the middle east
We mean it literally
Stand up visibly
Fingertips wiggling
Hands up like a grizzely
Grrrr, a grizzely
And move like a unified entity

One last show for the lonely souls
You are everywhere we go

Oh we came to save the night
We're trying to do what's right
We're trying to get by
Oh the circle has no sides
But at the end of the day
We're trying to change our ways

From the ocean to the sea
I want mostly to be free
All my folks to move with me
Ohoh Whoahoh

Thank you for letting the music hit you
Bless you, you know we never did do what they do
We only ever just do give you what's new
Your just due</pre>
