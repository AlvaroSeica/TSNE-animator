[Timbo King]
Hello, hello, hello, it's me, it's me, it's me
The T, the I, the M, the B, the O, you know
What time it is, sucka, I'm a bad muthafucka
The man far a crack in it, and marge in ya bumper
Breaker, breaker, breaker, testin 1, 2, 1, 2
Me, I am, P-O, test I want you to laugh
Have a good time as I bust this rhyme
I'm dope, I know, you know I joke line after line
I roll wit the peoples, cuz the peoples hit harder
And if you wanna battle son, don't you even bother
Cuz I can kick a verse and make the whole crowd shiver
And just like UPS, on the mic, I deliver
Sometimes I rock a hat, but then again I let my 'fro show
If he sweatin Timbo, I say let go my eggo
Temperature gon' puff up, this sucker make you skinny
Shop at the Gap, A.N.S. and JC Penny's
Better step back before I swing and start droppin you
When I'm on the mic I'm rockin you, rockin you
Takin at ya crew, I guess you knew it from the get go
Know you from the start, don't mess wit King Timbo

[Chorus 4X: Spark 950]
Original, Timbo King, uh!

[Timbo King]
I drink a Mystic, when I listen to this dialistic
Bake you like biscuits, better yet fishsticks
Fix up or get so don't play me as a minor
Baby Timb, 49ers be that mill that calm diners
Sing a song like Aretha, guarantee'll freak ya
When I meet ya, have ya scared like a creature
You can suck your teeth, your teeth, wit the big chief
I can cause beef, I be grief, trynna newly
I'mma type of rapper that yells, smell Sara Lee
Member me, time trapper me, Tim Timothy
Strong like a horse when I eat up all this finished cake
Rock to the limit, no image, no gimmick
Spark makes the tracks, that makes the rap sound perfect
Mic that be on, to ya girls, you wasn't worth it
Darkman, tales of the darkside, get's no darker
When I write around I use a pen or a marker
But come, here I come, here I come
Say what's up to the rap, cuz he's under 21
Take as your crew, I guess you knew it from the get go
I told you from the start, don't mess wit King Timbo

[Chorus 4X]

[Hook 2X: Timbo King]
Hello, hello, hello, it's me, it's me
It's me, it's me, it's me, hello, hello, hello

[Timbo King]
Timb keep the pockets full, never talk it then he pull
You wanna play hard once your cards get full
Don't need it brag it love, east coast hit the most
Don't try to play me close, you get toast like a roasty
Sandwich, and I'll damage, leave you cryin like a baby
Nanananana, you can't faze me
Play the instrumental, I get simple like Simon
Suckers start whynin, when I start rhymin
Respect me like a L, I got a big big truck
Of loads of girls, my girls, especially wit pearls
I use my complexions, so you better get protection
Listen to me, listen to me, walk in my direction
Takin out your crew, I guess you knew it from the get go
I told you from the start, don't mess wit King Timbo

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Spark 950]
Come on... Timbo King...</pre>
