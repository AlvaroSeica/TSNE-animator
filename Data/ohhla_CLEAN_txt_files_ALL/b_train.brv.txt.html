[Wiz]-All aboard!!
[Jungle]-All the whores!!!
*sound of train tracks*

[Chorus]
(Wiz) Yo, we came to take shit to the next stage!
{Jungle} And all ya mothafuckas, y'all betta be brave!
(Wiz) Cuz its that new shit
{Jungle} Exclusive! Jungle and Wiz!
(Wiz) Ruthless my nigga, straight out the brig

[Verse 1]
{Jungle}
Whats happnin', comrade, you ready for combat
There aint no turnin' back with guns and cardiacs
I watch my money stack and pop it like that
I broke a nigga back with a baseball bat!
I crack ya fucking skull, you'll need a body bag
Ya family mad and sad, I'll be glad
I'll cause ya laid out, in a bloodbath
Sneak attack with the ski mask and the mac!

(Wiz)
See I got no gun range
I got the block man
I test my gun aim on soggy Cornflakes
I got no love it's all pain
Y'all muthafuckas dont wanna bang with my gang
And all these bitches over here wanna give a nigga brains
Got the stainless talk
Police searchin' the Range
They wanna war when I'm doin' my thang
I got ice on, chains and rings and things
If you dont smoke purple, you cant hang

{Jungle}
Is you a Braveheart to the graveyard?
Ahh, lets get this mothafucking paper
Is you a Breaveheart?
TO THE GRAVEYEARD!!!

(Wiz)
Ahh, lets get this money now, not late
Cuz its the B Train (the B Train)

[Hook - Wiz]
All the whores, all the whores!
The B Train        (repeat)

[Verse 2]
{Jungle}
Ayo, I dont stop, fuck the cops
Body drops in the hood
Guns shots, pop alot
Get the cash if you could
Im in the shade when the coke is cookin'
I got hoes in L.A. to downfield Brooklyn
Jungles the king of ballas and Queens
I got a little ice on my pinky ring
Money on my mind
The hands on the 9
Understand my nigga, its all about crime

(Wiz)
While the blocks full of money and gettas
That know the difference between shootas and hittas
Buyers and sellers
Buyers and tellers
No one guessin', investin' it up with a big weapon
Wait till I catch his lil face, I'ma step in
And all these brave niggaz got you in a daze
No one stoopin' all the bitches gettin' paid
I like that
Ill Will
Bring it back, QB to the death
All these otha niggaz is wack
Cuz its the B Train (the B Train)

[Hook]
