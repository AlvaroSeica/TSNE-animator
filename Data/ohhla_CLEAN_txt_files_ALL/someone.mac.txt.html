Someone like [x8]
Someone like you [x2]
Someone like [x8]
Someone like you [x2]
Someone like [x8]
Someone like you [x2]

[Verse 1]
Laying up till the pain gone
All i hear is this same song when the radio came on
Fuck around and get waste dawg
Do this shit till the day i die
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Terrified but my hands are steady
Verify get the camera ready
Carry my own weight all these earthquakes don't wait
Need up from this sleep diving into this cold lake
Fuck all this let that hoe shake telling me I'm her soul-mate
Disguise the emotion no face bull shit with that no thanks
Dealing with her since 08 fucked around I'm done
I heard your suppose to race when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of it's fun spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logicial getting high jump off the moon
Looked right into his soul when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible when the mind is so close
Came in for your money then left with all your hoes

[Chorus]
Life moves fast but my paper keeps it slow
Open up your mind and start forgeting what you know (Ohhhhh!)
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Woaaahhh!!)
You move so good
Girl you let it hurt so good

[Verse 2]
Uhh love me love me then trippin on ignore me
Beautiful to get ugly turn you into a drunky
Still searching for something but i don't know what
Dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass checks
Isn't that sweet same shit you did last week
For all the cash you might of stood up and would've walked past me
Wake me up from this bad dream put a match to this gasoline
Everynight you somebody different got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up can't feel myself work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio where all my problems outwere themselves
Trapped in this wish and well death creeping like sprinter cell
Getting high put my mind away find the words I'm tryna say
Imma think of that later when the world goes against you
You better get that paper

[Chorus]
Life moves fast but my paper keeps it slow
Open up your mind and start forgetting what you know (Ohhhhh!)
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Woaaahhh!!)
You move so good
Girl you let it hurt so good</pre>
