(Hook, Project Pat)
Papers and cups
Papers and cups
Give me some kush and some drank and I'ma fill it up
Papers and cups
Papers and cups
Got my kush and my drank, I'm gettin fuuuucked uupppp
Papers and cups
Papers and cups
Give me some kush and some drank and I'ma fill it up
Papers and cups
Papers and cups
Got my kush and my drank, I'm gettin fuuuucked uupppp

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Yellow drank in my cup
Purple Haze in my papers
Kobe Bryant swag, you can call this hit a Laker
Birthday candle lit and you lames best not blow it
A nigga got that drank around Pat, you better pour it
Trippy sticks and trippy cups
Two bitches at the same time, now that's a trippy fuck
I'm smokin on this grass, it came from the Earth
Ballin on you niggas ass, like a nerf
These hos gettin high, then they gettin low
Needed her light bill paid; Her knees hit the floor
Oh my golly, on that Molly; She's a sexy dolly
Ran through her pussy like some tracks; My dick the trolly

(Hook, Project Pat)

(Verse 2, Nasty Mane)
Give me some trippy papers and some trippy cups
Mix that Sprite with that lean, then pour it up
This that animal house, and we get fucked up
Smoke nothing but Cali weed, you know that A plus
This that Cheech and Chong, making fucked up music
I'm a drug addict, I'm talking everyday usage
Plenty weed smokin; Plenty lean pourin
Plenty molly poppin, we love them girls pink poppin
If she throw it back (Swag) we gon' throw that cash (Swag)
I ain't nothin but some money, "bandz a make her dance"
If she throw it back (Swag) we gon' throw that cash (Swag)
I ain't nothin but some money, "bandz a make her dance"
