Song:   Diary of a Dreamer
Typed by: PremRock

It's So lovely...
It's PremRock.... Willie Green pound them sticks
let's keep them drums dusty
I Dream as dream does..
Watching the clouds shift
Shaking my proud fist if they give me a mean mug
I inherited this, we all inherit the trouble
And though we share in the struggle 
I live in marital bliss
My character traits have made their share of mistakes
But I sharecrop with my folk to keep a share on our plates
I in-terrogate fate like,  "sir I don't approve"
I keep it cyclical if you were unaware of the shape
Thoughts outside the box
get each corner erased cause if
you're not within my circle
Stay outside of my space!
I can whatever's dished
trust me on this
Life's only a bitch if you don't you can't study her hips
so I created a developed penmanship based on being a gentleman
to jot down the notes on where she likes to be kissed

Chorus (2X)

The diary of a dreamer
I live between the lines
My destiny to shine
You ain't taking what's mine, mine, mine
You can never marginalize
Whats inside the margins I find, find find
Is every part of my mind, mind, mind

My designs intelligent, 
Mind defines dangerous
inclined to punk plagarists,
growth stunt their development 
The diary of a dreamer
Thoughts exist within the margin
But break through when creating *whoops*
I beg your pardon.
Gotta pay a few dues before you finish paying homage
And now I'm cooking with cayenne
Brooklyn to Iran
Cairo to Thailand
Gone to the fly jam
And....where-ever I land there I am
Who I am, PremRock rock the land
watch the crowd pop, lock in the spot
like "Goddamn!"
A child of the ink
Descendent of the page
I can tell you what I think 
If you give me the stage
Trying to form my own lane
Listening to Cold Vein
mixed it in with Coltrane
Stitched into my soul's frame
No shame not knowing where your going
But I know where I been and I know my aim

Chorus (2X)

The diary of a dreamer
I live between the lines
My destiny to shine
You ain't taking what's mine, mine, mine
You can never marginalize
Whats inside the margins I find, find find
Is every part of my mind, mind, mind

I dream without the rapid eye movement
Fly rapper guy movement
Baptized through the fire cracked eye to find music
Read back lines while yo clap to it
Oh...so thats how you do it
Leaving ignorance detained Through the light I seer
Born with filaments for veins I'm God's bright idea
I was forged from the flame, I shine bringing the pain
Or the power to heal whatever measure I feel
Built for forever you can't sever ideals
I dream with every piece of the sky 
With piece of my mind
Reach peace through the speech as I climb
As it peaks out the speakers wattage freaking the rhyme
This is my diary
To help achieve a higher me
Through the Papryus is how I reach Piety
No way to silence me
My journal is eternal 
A mouthpiece for dreams
Keep the conversation fertile

The diary of a dreamer
I live between the lines
My destiny to shine
You ain't taking what's mine, mine, mine
You can never marginalize
Whats inside the margins I find, find find
Is every part of my mind, mind, mind</pre>
