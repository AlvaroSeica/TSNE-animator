[Intro: singer - repeat 2X]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing lasts forever

[J. Cole]
Hey, when this shit end, man it's gon' get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmomma love me
And your momma love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me
Uh, soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin in my crib, you gotta get up out it
Cause if you're layin in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin and we no longer upset about it
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon' call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass nigga in that Honda
showin up with that drama
On my momma we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends know it's gon' hurt

[Chorus: singer] + (J. Cole)
(You can't say we didn't try though, huh)
I tried, you tried, we tried (you can't say we didn't try, hey)
All of the times that we had together (hey)
We should've known nothing lasts forever
(You can't say we didn't try though)
I tried, you tried, we tried (you can't say we didn't try)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing lasts forever

[J. Cole]
Hey, they say we won't last
I know you suspicious but you don't ask
And I don't tell - that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad, good chick alone, mad as fuck
She done had enough
I be, out here tryin to raise my status up
But success bring bitches and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should've looked both ways 'fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could've ever lost you
Now I'm out stuntin with this bitch who ain't about nuttin
while some nigga learnin all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect
I'm just hopin you don't look at me as somethin you regret

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[J. Cole]
Huh, I got your message I been meanin to respond, know it's been awhile
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it but I know that shit is different now and times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?
I mean you, lookin good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from, friends to somethin much more
To breakin up to makin up and fuckin once more
Second chances, we gave enough to finally
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin up and wantin one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each other's hearts, so maybe it's for the better
Holla whenever cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin lasts forever, least we got these memories

[Chorus] w/ minor variations
