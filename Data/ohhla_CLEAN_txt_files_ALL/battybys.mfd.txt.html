[Intro]
If you were waiting for a parade there ain't none
Sharpen up your spirit of adventure the fabulous gay way
Hey what's the big idea? (Gay!)
I have no ideas, in fact I'm quite bewildered
Now don't get gay with me (Gay!)
Sir I'm far from gay
Now listen, Keep your shirt on
Grown man in a rubber suit running around with a young boy (Homo!)

[DOOM]
Oh shoot get a load of that fruit
In thigh high boots, red tighty whiteys and blue catsuit (Holy homos!)
Even the rats know its tacky 
If you ever see me slippin' like that bitch just smack me
Posin' chest and legs open couldn't stand worse
All was missin' was a bandanna and a man purse
Cryin' dyin' laughin' till glands burst 
Faster than a speeding blast, bleeding ass land first
Fixin' baby hair messed up wave your curl 
Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl
The things some people'll do for fame
Its a herb, its a lame, its a god damn shame
Villain willin' when them cold streets call
You can keep your hero and hold the meat balls
Worthy title lock it with pockets on empty 
He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry
Turn dirt to dolla's like Don Henley
Ugly and still get holla's like Ron Jeremy at least monetarily
Terribly MC's need therapy it's like a fairy spree
Hit em' wit a kryptonite prick (Kryptonite!) 
Children come and prick is dead, body wit a stick
Wrote this lyric from in the bed wit' a chick 
She had the tightest grip around the head of my...

[Snippets of a conversation #1]
Man 1: How much money you got? 
Man 2: I ain't got but 4 dollars on me, 
Man 1: Damn
Man 2: Anyway I done got this whole cock for ya
Man 1: Shit you must be some kinda faggot man
my partner a faggot, why don't you come on out here man
Man 2: What the hell!

[Doom] 
"Bic" now can I get my pen back 
Got no enemy, got no friend black
With the green goblin got the batcave robbed
Bust in Batman head bobbin, slobbin Robin's knob (This is a stick up!)
Yall already got you belts on the floor so 
Kick them shits over here and click off the porno
Alfred come home and found them both naked (Master Bruce!) 
Handcuff to each other (Huh!) just as he had suspected (Sorry Alfred!)
Red and chrome batmobile wheelin and dealin
 Aquaman sleepin with the fishes for real for squealin'
Pssst! the low low, on a seal skin blazer
It's just a little graze from a laser thin razor
Amazed at these so called wannabe players, 
showin off they tit balls to all the free gay'ers
It's like a leotard fest
How it got started is any retards guess
Regardless thats they choice no hate to bake
Becomes a problem when he try attempt to go straight
And raise the monster rate in the whole population 
Its starting to effect the super pimpin occupation
Now who's the hater headline the newspaper
Fate of a fake you out caped crusader
Tied to the tracks make a damn tram derail 
Rap is like a scam, spam nigerian email 
The man with no beard is more weirder than a shemale 
Sucka got bagged on a temazepam street sale
Told on one of ours shut it up yeah doubt 
Did it like the dirty draws wet 'em up and air it out

[Snippets of a conversation #2]
Man 1: I got myself a nice cock
Man 2: What?
Man 1: Listen you got any money?
Man 2: Man you goin crazy! What the hell for?
Man 1: 4 Dollars only
Man 2: Damn!

[Outro]
Batman's gay, Batty-Boys
