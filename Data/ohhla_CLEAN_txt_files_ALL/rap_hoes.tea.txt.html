[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, it's rap and hoes, right here
Uh, yo, here it is, yo, aiyo, aiyo

[Chorus 4X: Dom Pachino]
I, love, rap and hoes
A nickel plated nine and jukebox, baby

[Dom Pachino]
Aiyo, my nine got a mind of it's own, I don't knock him
He lick like lollypop shots, I don't cock 'em
He spray like anyway, he don't play
He don't display, where we come, you get laid
Lay the fuck out, straight up and down, ain't been announced
Come through, work by the ounce
Fuck it, chop it up, jakes wanna lock it up
Rock it in a truck, my niggas spark it up
Shit, darken up, yo, shit, darken up
Shit darken up, to the point where you can't see
You fucking with the Terrorist, you fucking with the Army
Dirty, Saddam laundry, thugs, they can't harm me
Cuz I'm in for life, Terrorist put the muthafuckin' cannon in your wife
Shit, darken up, shit, darken up
Yo, this shit is crazy right there...</pre>
