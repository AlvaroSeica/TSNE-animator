back up wait a minute
Why you lookin at me like that
do you really wanna trip or you flippin the script
do you wanna rap with a nigga are you bangin some whoop in the whip
I don't ever wanna come to us bussin off shots
nigga misery can't produce enough cops
and I don't if you wildin or what
all you wanna do is freestyle in the cut
fan or foe (foe)
I don't really know (know)
off at the show (show)
niggas they know (know)
what I look like was a good night
now its lookin like a motherfucka wanna jack all me doe (doe)
come to me and kids when we chillin
better think twice I'm a five six villian
all you wanna talk about he did it when I did it
but all I thought about you gonna get a bullet in a minute
You should be careful how you talk up on us
got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it
I know they wait for tecca nina moments
before when they be pop up it hit you don't it
You don't know if they be trippin or not
probably cause all of us live on the block
when you rappin niggas know what you got
show us when up on the top
show some respect when you approach me
don't be muggin me
might have that drug in me
pluggin a nigga from nearly shruggin me
Ain't nothin wrong with people peepin
geekin with a man or hoe
with a gramma so bamma stamma
I don't if you fan or foe!

[Chorus]
if you trippin we can go
peepin like he seekin doe
wanna throw him on da po
I don't know if ya fan or foe
I don't know if ya fan or foe
easy how you speakin bro
I don't know if ya fan or foe

[T-Nutty]
now be easy how you speakin bro
T-Nutty the young floheakin tho
don't be chokin
show yo ass and youll be walkin off wit it broken
run up on motherfuckas in the open
makin shut up they with that hoe shit
cut the shananicans
nigga you fakers are manakins
thinkin you slicker than lotion?
back up wait a minute y you lookin at me like that
I'm just a nigga wit a little bit of fame
but if you get to trippin you can get it out my gang
never catch me slippin you can get it out ya brain
mayne fan or foe sucka nigga tryna get his hands on my doe
but if you really wanna be the one to try to get on it
you can be the opponent chokin with hands in your throat
man I'm a loc
one to pack round from sac-town
betta watch out for the blow blow
blackout blackout blackout blackout brrrrrrraaaaaahhhhhhh
stay with my killas that be knockin noodles
wakin the game up like a cock-a-doodle
think you gon catch me slippin at show
nutt factors lookin like they shock a ?zooloo?
I see through u
with all the fake shit
You feel one hatred
hopin and wishin you was my replacement
comin so vicious you gon have to face it
and try to taste it
Cause I laced it like a tennis shoe when I ben a foo
like c-bo lynch and x-raided but this is a different interview
(back us up nigga)

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
dippin the b for that idea
for never go home again
niggas lookin at me like I'm a chicken dinner
lookin back at niggas like I'm ?shante henderson?
You a foe (foe)
so I gotta carry the fo (four)
do they recognize me I don't really know though
Cause they walkin up past and givin me doubt
and when they pass they ask me when ya new shit come out (me and my dawgs)
at the picture house
they be huddled up got me thinkin pick one out
lookin at the nigga bigga than me
for the trigga to see
if ya tough enough make it what ya tryin to be
but he a fan tho
don't know how to approach up voulta
get to close and ill post ya
(I'm 'possed to know the difference of fan or foe when ya muggin tho
Can't even live in peace
and when I eat with my peeps in the place
You all in my face with ya mixtapes
and if I ain't tryin to listen to it we get into it
and if I'm off the fluid then its time to do it)
Cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
ya girl be lovin me givin me mouth to mouth
and it ain't fair that the music got her doin what you want when you ain't there
and you to softly softy
when you see me up you betta get up off me
(if ya girl actin a hoe we tell her fan or foe)

[Chorus]</pre>
