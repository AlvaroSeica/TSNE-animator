[Intro - Rick Ross]
It's ?
Well acquainted with all the ? and all that shit
It's Ricky Ross the rich boss

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
Wet bars on the boat
?
Crib like Scott Storch all from the coke
Maybox were a dream now it's all real
It's hard to get sleep layin next to five mil
I'm still gettin chips I call 'em the guce bumps
Yeah Alexander vision I'm buildin like two Trumps
Steppin guce bumps I'm the main event
We got a pocket full of game brain it made me ten
Six bitches numbers on the same yacht
? that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it these niggas livin of the past
I ran a hundred miles but I did it all with class
Hands of glass wrist all glass
Mirror on the wall ? with a Cristal ass
Champagne pours celebrate the curse
? above the laws with the mercy of the lords

[Hook - Rick Ross]
This me nigga
It's me nigga
While we do our thang give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin money you can't miss me nigga
This me nigga
It's me nigga
While we do our thang give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin money you can't miss me nigga

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
What's worse the ? from your homey
Tables turn fast I told you not to fuck me Tony
Started with the dishes ending with the digits
I had to cross friendship it's rules to the business
? with a sister like Gina
Beauty salon dream got the keys and the beamer
On the way to ? it's disappointment only
Land my spaceship with the spoilers only
? folders
F-B-I's eighty yeah let 'em know how a nigga ride
Fo-fo and fo-five and six fo's
Half a pill two dime six hoes
I need a slice of the pie fo five six
As I throw my dice in the sky
Head crack nigga
Bread stack nigga
Convertible Bert yeah I let my hair back nigga

[Hook - Rick Ross]
This me nigga
It's me nigga
While we do our thang give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin money you can't miss me nigga
This me nigga
It's me nigga
While we do our thang give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin money you can't miss me nigga

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
Lamborghinis and Maseratis ?
When the beats over back to the street, soldier
The cold ? on the mic make me bring the heats over
When the beefs over might see the peach rover
We eats but we try to reach each quota
No soda Rolls roller one on her
Rodeo eighty gram one coda
Louis Vuitton bright sides don't want 'em
They trippin I'm drippin in Tiffany stones
Yeah the mob peel ? I'm livin it homes
Show ? I blow purp in ?
Four chains I'm puttin down with more work

[Hook - Rick Ross]
This me nigga
It's me nigga
While we do our thang give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin money you can't miss me nigga
This me nigga
It's me nigga
While we do our thang give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin money you can't miss me nigga</pre>
