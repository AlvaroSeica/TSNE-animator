Song:   Fo
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Fo niggas in the low rider
Smoking gas, screamin' jet life when we go past
I'm the one behind the wheel, mind on a mill
Just wonderin' how long will it last

[Verse 1]
Never been a square one from square one
All about that there, K them layers
Counted up away, fans fair
I must say I'm feeli'n quite debonair on this speedin' boat in this night air
Transport this cargo rare
Just recorded these, rappin' like package keys
Higher than the flyin' trapeze
Might give you the roaches when I leave
Closest you getting to smoking like G's
Freeze, it's AOB
What could you do for me?
Hard on a bitch, but we can't all do this
Some of you niggas a sip water whip, camera pimps
I'm here to close the lid on all that shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
One foot in, one foot out
I can't get out, I can't get in
As the wheel of fortune spin, torturing men
Find my pot of gold, same time lost friends
Sail out with some niggas as my ship came in
Now I'm smooth sailin' and they barely can swim
Try vitola, Testarossa pop up head like showed him
The road was golden and they didn't know it
Like you gave up when the race was almost over
You could've placed and won the trophy but you chose to fold up on it
That's a luck, I can't afford to give a fuck
With all these bitches tryin' to get it I'm too busy livin'
To be concerned with suckas who don't earn
What I earn, you just a threat to yourself, you a learn
As the world turn, the joint burns
Time machine on date of 13's, I'm the one stuntin'
Sucka scared, better cop some insurance
Niggas in the van on yo block, word to Big Worm

[Chorus X2]

[Outro: The Godfather]
[Hyman Roth]
Make sure that everybody sees the cake before we cut it
When a man comes to this point in his life
he wants to turn over the things he's been blessed with
turn them over to friends
As a reward for the friends he's had
and to make sure that everything goes well after he's gone
I want all you to enjoy your cake...</pre>
