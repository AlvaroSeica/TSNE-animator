Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Walkin' through the club, bitches show me love
Niggas hating so I'm up, you, you know wassup (shit is getting heavy)
Walking through the club, goose up in my cup
Niggas hating so I'm up, this shit I can't be touched (shit is getting heavy)

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Ah, Shit is getting heavy
Killing these niggas and you ain't even gotta tell me, ahh
Is it my demeanor, is it cause I'm cleaned up
When I step up on the scene, uh
Is it my inner swag, packing the shit you lack
Nigga you wish you had, that
I backseat ride, I'm chauffeured
Can a young nigga feel any older?
I'm a boss like Ross or Hova

[Bridge: August Alsina]
Your girl looking good, damn you know she mean, bra
Soon as I make my move, you know she gon leave ya
Let's not make her choose, cause she's not that confused
I know that it's me she want and you know too, no need to front, ahh

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Walkin' through the club, bitches show me love
Niggas hating so I'm up, you, you know wassup (shit is getting heavy)
Walking through the club, goose up in my cup
Niggas hating so I'm up, real shit I can't be touched (shit is getting heavy)
She want me, she want me, she want me,
She want me, she want me, she want me (shit is getting heavy)
She want me, she want me, she want me,
Shit is getting heavy

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Hold up, let me check my Rolex, time for me to roll out
Meet me at the telly, my room girl, lets show out
Yes, time to have sex, we can do it how you want it girl
Let you get a taste the August's World
Ahh, ahh, ahhh, ahh
Don't stop [?] now, better pull my brakes, we trying to make a baby
Just wanna hear you make that and oo-ooo-ahh sound

[Bridge: August Alsina]
Your girl looking good, damn you know she mean, bra
Soon as I make my move, you know she gonna leave ya
Let's not make her choose, cause she's not that confused
I know that it's me she want and you know too no need to front, ahh

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Walkin' through the club, bitches show me love
Niggas hating so I'm up, you, you know wassup (shit is getting heavy)
Walking through the club, goose up in my cup
Niggas hating so I'm up, real shit I can't be touched (shit is getting heavy)
She want me, she want me, she want me
She want me, she want me, she want me (shit is getting heavy)
She want me, she want me, she want me
Shit is getting heavy</pre>
