Angelz Wit Dirty Faces

[Verse One] [Pep Love]
I certainly had
Suckers in servitude 
With sick sermons
I've been a serpent since I was a wee lad
My tongue was sharp
Rippin' this shit from the start
A buff brain and a humongous heart
How can I make this world a better place?
With the words comin' outta my face if it's some fake shit?
How can I reach my peeps if I'm rhymin' over beats that's weak
And my songs ain't unique?
So from the beginnin' my instinct
Was to have a style that was distinct and in sync 
To the beat of the brink of eruption
I think I think too much
So I water the page with ink
Incredible art form
Wrought from the part of my thoughts
That shake concepts and start storms
I graduated from broke four tracks and ear phones
With the short in the wire makin' these here songs
I swell 'em when I'm in my element
You better tell 'em
My flows sexy 
Elegant, bringin' the rebellion
Hip hop's the cure to the ailment
I've been waitin' to unveil hits for our further development

[Pep Love talking]
And it don't quit. And it don't stop. Uh huh, yeah. And it don't quit.
And it don't stop. Uh huh.

[Verse Two] [Sunspot Jonz]
Peep peep
In other countries
Hostin' TV shows
Clear my toes
On sandy beaches makin' doe
Off of throwin'
Our own shows worldwide
Show me the money
If you want a tour
I think back
Three or four years ago doin' shows to pay the electricity bill
Still
Broke, livin' off a taco truck
My real
Folks was the people
That I starved with
Fuck the bullshit
I put a beadie butt in a bong if the weeds all gone
Makin' songs at the house if a beats on
While we smokin'
Somebody starts freestylin'
And grabs the broken
Microphone
Bustin' raps on the four track till the whole pack spit
Sometimes endin' up with nine minute songs and shit
You know how it get, now you feelin' it

[Verse Three] [Luckyiam.PSC]
I only write when the beats on
I guess it's wrong
I leave it to the track to dictate the song
Topic
View from the inner optic
Plug in the sockets to energize the loose leaf
Both sides of my sheet is never neat chief
Crossed out lines and rhymes I would never use
I'm a picky dude
Dues been paid since the last time Snoop had his fade
Tell promoters +It's A G Thang+
Like they don't know
We rip it everywhere that we go
Bitch please
You dealin' with some underground O.G.s
Internal rippers
It's the microphone tripper</pre>
