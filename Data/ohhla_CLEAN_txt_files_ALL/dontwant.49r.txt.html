Jas Mace

Now I don't want no wack emcees
To even think about rhyming on the Beat Machines
And I don't want no pork on my plate
I'd rather wine and dine with a nice round steak
And I don't want no bitch in my face
Trying to get me for my money like she's down with Jas Mace
Cause, man I'm really sick of the hoes
You should see them when we chilling back stage at the shows
And I don't want no fraudulent kats
Trying to get up in my crew, just to stab me in my back
And I don't want another four years
Of blood, sweat, and tears we got to get him out of here
And burn this bush, set it a blaze
It's the only way we're ever gonna see some better days
And I don't want to hear your sob stories
Can you dig it, kid, I ain't your mother fucking mea ticket

Hook (2xs)

If you ain't from my clan, then just back up man
We do it for our fam the ones the ones who love it and
The ones who stay on the grind even when we're struggling
Laugh now but we gonna be laughing when things is bubbling

Jas Mace

I don't want to deal with A&amp;Rs
Trying to tell me what's hot and how to make me a star
I ain't trying to make a wack beat
Just to move some units in the street bitch please
I don't want to deal with y'all
I'd rather do it by myself then even fuck with y'all
Cause nowadays they're moving like snakes
I'm like a wack dj, can't even catch a break
And I don't want to take what's yours
But the system's fucked up they're trying to take what's mine
And, I don't want to find out
One of my boys took the wrong route, he needs a time out
I hope he realize that we got love for him
So let's get it together cause we don't live forever
I don't want to be a flash in the pan
So I'm gonna make my stand and be man come on

Hook (2xs)

If you ain't from my clan, then just back up man
We do it for our fam the ones the ones who love it and
The ones who stay on the grind even when we're struggling
Laugh now but we gonna be laughing when things is bubbling

Jas Mace

I don't want to hear no more raps about
Getting shot, cooking crack, or busting caps
Cause, everything sounds the same
Got me falling asleep to this boring ass game mane
I don't want to really start stressing
About an industry founded on expression
But now they put a sticker on our lips
We can't get no money if we ain't doing the same shit

Hook (2xs)

If you ain't from my clan, then just back up man
We do it for our fam the ones the ones who love it and
The ones who stay on the grind even when we're struggling
Laugh now but we gonna be laughing when things is bubbling</pre>
