[Verse 1]
Lil' nigga I dont give a fuck
If you like me or not
Young Noble Outlaw keep it piped &amp; hot
You say you used to love Pac
And you lovin' the Lawz
Niggaz used to love Pac
Now they lovin' it raw
Sick in the head
I spit words lifted the dead
You skip to the fed
They put the triple beam on ya head
Niggaz bettin' on my creamless bread
Will they make it or not
Straight to the top
We moving ahead
We tryna drop 50 albums a year
I'm afraid to lose
Plus I was taught I had to challenge my fears
I was born lost
So what that make me?
A muthafucka fighting his-self
I shall succeed

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna eat
Don't nobody wanna hustle
When niggaz start eating
They forget about the struggle
Niggaz talk a lot of shit
But don't nobody want trouble
Being a Outlaw
Niggaz hate you or they love you

Everybody wanna eat
Don't nobody wanna hustle
When niggaz start eating
They forget about the struggle
Niggaz talk a lot of shit
But don't nobody want trouble
Being a Outlaw
Niggaz hate you or they love you

[Verse 2]
I could lace you with a couple of jewels
You gotta listen
Or lace you with a couple of tools
When shit thickens
Throw aways -- slower days was in front of us
Foster child -- don't nobody want none of us
We all was wild -- muthafucka
Not some of us
The hawk was out
Dawg the block was the comforter
Plottin' on some other shit
Them niggaz'll get you
You think them niggaz hustlin'
Them niggaz is snitchin'
The one pointin' at you
When they read you ya sentence
And all along you thought you kept it real wit'cha niggaz
The ones who ain't say shit them really the killaz
And those who on that snake shit
Somebody'll kill 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm faced with the trouble
Of the everyday black male
Black male, crack cell, packed jail, gat tell
How many of yall niggaz take care of ya kids
How many of yall niggaz tryna straight from the bids
They wonder why we wild out when we get big
We rappin' with a foul mouth
Teachin' ya kids
Ya know it aint no worse then what they hearing at home
Plus it aint no food and he always alone
He said "fuck school mom leave me alone"
And though he feel peace when he hearing my songs
I tell him go to school
I ain't teaching him wrong
We connected to the streets like each in my arm
The industry is just like reading a palm
You mention me
It's just like ringing the Lawz
How could it be the streets keep screaming for Nobe
Them muthafuckas knownin' that I'm one of they own

[Chorus]

Ah
Noble justice!</pre>
