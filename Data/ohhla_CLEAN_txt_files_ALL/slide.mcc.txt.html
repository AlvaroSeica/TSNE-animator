I love the slide!
Cause you can, go all the way up and you come down
And you go all the way up, and you come down (yeah)
And you go all the way up, and you come down (uh-huh)
And you go all the way up... and you come down
And you know, you don't need a friend, to enjoy the slide
So if you're like me, and you don't have anyone to play with
You can just head up the slide, that's what I do
(Oh yeah, you just go on there by yourself?)
Don't need anybody!</pre>
