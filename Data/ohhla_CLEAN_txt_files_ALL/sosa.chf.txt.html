SOSA [x5]

[Chorus]
Them bitches screaming out, Sosa
Who always off the loud, Sosa
Shooting niggas down, Sosa
I'm at the top, you niggas down, Catch up

Them bitches screaming out, Sosa
Who always off the loud, Sosa
Shooting niggas down, Sosa
I'm at the top, you niggas down, Catch up

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Who smoking on the loud... SOSA (bang, bang!)
Known all around... SOSA
Rob you for your pound, CATCH UP
I'm on top, you niggas down, CATCH UP
Rolling off a 3 in it?
I can't lose, I'm so used to winning
If you deliver bullets, send it
We got them beams, shoot that gun, sent itch?
I'm ridin' with my gualla-guallas
And we some fucking ballin'-ballers
And campaign sosa bitch nigga follow
Middle fingers to them fuckin' oppas

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Shots fired, 9 niggas falling
We see ya oppa my lil niggas off him
It's not my asthma kush got me coughing
Real nigga.com, bitch nigga login
3hunna niggas with me and we all smashing
Fuck a bitch and get money, I got a passion
It's you who gon' do the team bitch I was asking
Smoking trees and I'm busy lumberjacking
Bustin' bitches with my gualla-guallas
Ain't paying no hoes, we some shot-callers
Living life like there's no tomorrow
Everything I do, bitch, I do it for my daughter

[Chorus x2]</pre>
