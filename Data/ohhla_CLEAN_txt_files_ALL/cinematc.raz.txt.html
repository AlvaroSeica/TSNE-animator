(Intro)
Yeah Cinematic, Renaissance, Razah Rubiez
You know, I ain't writing rhymes no mo' I'm writing movie scripts
And this one's all Blaxploitation

*Blaxploitation film sample*

--"Well, I think that's a little bit out of our league"--
	--Only out of our league if you think it's out of our league"--
--"Well, then that's what I mean"--

[Hell Razah]
Yeah!
That's when I met 'Coffy', a Belvedere dear hair like Pam Grier
Sipping on some Gran Marier
Gave me a cold stare
A glare that can 'Sparkle' like 'Claudine'
She brought fiends, said she want 'A Piece of the Action'
And more CREAM, more fiend
'Pipe Dreams' was just an old fling
She moved on a bigger and better things
Like wedding rings
Married to a 'Superfly' guy, they went to 'Cooley High'
With 'Five on the Black Hand Side'
They wanted 'Short Eyes', a hundred grand, dead or alive
They found 'em hogtied inside the 'Car Wash' of his boss ride
It cross-fired the minute the 'Truck Turner' arrived
They paid the court bribe
(I want him and his bride married side-by-side)
That's 'One Down, Two to Go', no witnesses no clues
'Lady Sings the Blues', so we cut off her air play
That's 'Three the Hard Way', gun spray when it's broad day
'The Mack' had his ho's lined up in the hallway
One girl 'Mahgony', known because her skintone
Use to bone 'Black Belt Jones' and check his cellphone
Redialed and got a dialtone from 'Cleopatra Jones'
Notice she was after the throne so she grabbed the chrome
And called up 'Trouble Man'
(An then we need a better plan
It's 'Hell Up in Harlem' when 'Cotton Comes' with more grams)
Yes ma'am I'm keeping it low-key
I'm 'OG' just make sure there's 'Cornbread, For Earl and Me'

--"Don't listen to this little lady"--
--"And get your hearts together"--
"Street cinema"
--"Talk about taking chances"--
"Cinematic"
--"What do you think you're doing everytime you pick up a gun?"--

[Hell Razah]
'Black Caesar' caught the kite, he was 'Up Tight'
Cuz 'Dolemite' was 'Uptown Saturday Night'
Moving that china white
'Willie Dynamite' had a bet on Iron Mike
Gambling with money trouble, can't break the 'Monkey Hu$tle'
So it's champagne bubbles, cigars and card shuffles
Money in the duffle bag, 'Shaft' will get the other half
He put it on his badge, his staff will leave a blood bath
The 'Spook Who Sat by the Door', showed 'em the .44
Said keep on recording more footage for 'Gordon's War'
Cuz 'Slaughter's Big Rip-Off' was hurting his credit score
With 'Petey Wheatstraw' who was getting his 'cain raw
He paid for his 'Sugar Hill' in crisp hundred dollar bills
Heard killers out in 'Bucktown' got his brother killed
The word is it happened up in 'Uncle Tom'[s] cabin (Word!?!)
A witness saw it all, 'Across 110th Street'
Convinced me and I can get the low with the chargers
We 'The Black Godfathers' love the silence revolvers

--"Listen to me!"--
"Black Cinema"
"--You atleast a chance to get some out of 'em"--
--"Yeah, that's besides laughing, and bragging,
-- over how many brothers you done shot and killed in some fool's gang war"--
"Cinematic movie"
--"Now sit your funky asses down before I change"--
--"I heard that!"--
"Street cinema"
"Cinematic"</pre>
