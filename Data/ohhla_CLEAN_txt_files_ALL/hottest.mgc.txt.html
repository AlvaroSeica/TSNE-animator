Typed by: AZ Lyrics

welcome to the heat
everybody knows
when I'm on my grind
I always steal the show
I represent the hottest city in the world
bouncing in the low
you best take off your girl

welcome to magic city
part 2 602
magic city

welcome to the heat
(welcome)
everybody knows
when I'm on my grind
I always steal the show
I represent the hottest city in the world
bouncing in the low
you best take off your girl

I've been a whole lot of places outside of my state
with laz in miami
felli fel in the golden state
but this year I'm about to break wide
and make more money than the president lies
and you kno thats a whole lot of dough
rock the stage with two flags &amp; let them know
that magic city is bout to bring fire
like kanye when he spit thru the wire
ive been south west for a long time
way before you heard az side
and you can find me al over the bubble
I got big d chasing money &amp; trouble
always ridin on a beat thats dope
I'm trying to do it like destiny hope
hottest in the world and it jst wont stop
ladies show love and take off your tops!

welcome to the heat
(welcome)
everybody knows
when I'm on my grind
I always steal the show
(602)
I represent the hottest city in the world
(magic city)
bouncing in the low
you best take off your girl

if you can deal with the heat
then this cld be the place for you
it aint vegas or sunset
but you can slide thru and uuu
the ladies out here they dress less
take it off lil mama and show daddy the rest
You blessed baby aint too many out here like you
a born and bred stallion of the 602
come thru the magic city well be up all night
we roll hundred spokes mama and take off on site
southwest til I die aint no fakin on mind
fromt he valley in the sun to the alley up in your mind
bout time magic gave truebreed a lil shine
if you stare at my glare jst be aware you'll go blid
(he aint lying)
cuz everything I touch go head
You mightve sold a few records but you still aint shhh
so welcome to my city where them jaws get broken
becareful who hit up when you slide thru loc

welcome to the heat
(welcome)
everybody knows
when I'm on my grind
I always steal the show
(602)
I represent the hottest city in the world
(magic city)
bouncing in the low
you best take off your girl</pre>
