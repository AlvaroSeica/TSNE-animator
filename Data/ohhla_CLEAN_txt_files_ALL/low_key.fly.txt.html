[Young Brown]
Yeah
I got some money on my head
Money on my head
I got some money on my head
Money on my head
Ese Daz

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
Get down on it, jump inside
Six-four low low, everytime I ride
We just cruise down the block with the gangsta lean
Sunroof top
You know it don't stop
We got it locked from the Gate to the H.A.
Latino players puttin' it down in a major way
110 South to the top with the rooftop
And everytime we rock a show, you know we blow the roof up
Hot tracks con la lady, cars in barrio
Bumpin' out the system of the caros in the calles, holmes
Only in L.A.
Where we got the bomb weed
Finest bitches, home of lowriders and palm trees
So have a toast with me
Or light it up, homie
Whatever you wanna do, as long as we party, homie
I take the girl with the green eyes and big ass
So what's it gonna be
Let's keep it low key

Chorus: Young Brown
She wanna hang with me
I know you got a man, we can stay low key
We'll floss through the city on the night, we creep
Baby
It's on you, we do what we players do

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Young Brown]
You don't even know my name
I'm off the Gate, with a plan, up with my fans
You wanna get
Down, cause you know we movin' game
You got a man, but why hold back, you want romance
Somethin' really I don't plan to give you
I'm doin' my thang, and if I'm with you
All my fan's leave you
Tellin' me, "Girl, I don't want to leave you"
Hold my hand, you got a man, how can I believe you
Girl, you know you chasin' a dream you never even had
Girl, you told me that you love me
I'll make you take it back
You told me to be honesto
That's why I look into your eyes
Es todo nothin', say "Aqui, no hay sentimientos"
Yo lo te miento
Yo le halimiento
With these money makin' movimientos
See, I can't take you where I wanna go
But hey now
I'll be right back, girl, we can hang out

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Ese Daz]
Ese Daz is a name
I'm just an international player
Tryin' to get paid
I love all women, any color, any race
Mexicano, Japanese, or black that's played
I want the crown
Like the homie Young Brown, Out Tha Gate
Watch me rock, roll, skate
Bouncin', dancing with this little mama
Swing to the left, to the right, do the cha cha
We party all night long until the cops come
But since they didn't come, mami, give me more run
I wanna get faded tonight because I'm on one
Don't trip, your man's at home, get ya freak on
Get ya hands up, shake that ass, don't stop
You lookin' bad for real, savvy mamacita
Out of all the women tonight, you're a ten
I wanna experience your mind, body and soul, let it all begin

Repeat Chorus Four Times</pre>
