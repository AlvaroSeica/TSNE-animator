As, we, pro-ceed, to give you what you need {*2X*}

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch, get your bitch, Nickel quick
Joey, Crook you know we shut, everybody down!
Bitch this ain't no club hit, this ain't for no bitches
This a motherfuckin stick-up, quick, everybody down!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm about to rob the hardest nigga out here, yes I'm on my Joker shit
I keep a Heath, Ledger for the joke of it
I don't plan ahead I'm done, I don't gamble I just keep a fo'-fo' clip
full of bullets that resemble poker chips
I'm so the shit, bitches jumpin on my pogo stick
Slaughterhouse you know we sick; everybody down!
Take your bitch, same bitch you wake up with
Make her trick, 'til her fuckin thighs hurt
Mama if your pussy wet, shouldn't have a dry purse
Call me Ryan Rhinoplasty, I will augment yo' ass if you mess with God's work
When it come to drama fightin's second, homicide's first
I don't look for drama, drama follows me so why search?
Everybody everybody, we gon' need you quiet (shhh)
Slaughter got a message, everybody - down!
I'm a cheddar getter, you a teller, I don't care whatever
I'll just scare the witnesses - I'm the illest in here
Bring your pen and pad and we'll compare the sicknesses
Where the fuck the ruler at so we can measure sentences?
I am better than I ever been, never been better
I don't follow trends, I set trends for the trendsetters

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
As, we, pro-ceed, to give you what you need
As, we, pro-ceed

[Crooked I]
And now, the drive-by.. first I pull up on your block
Let my entire torch all spit fire, burn down your empire's boardwalk
Bitch I am meltin my rim tire, draw off
Porsche hit the wall then my pill high has worn off
Crawled out, grabbed the new banana clip
Lacerations on my face, travel agent shit I still plan a trip
Ran up on the first nigga who had a whip
Either die a hero or abandon ship (get out yo' car nigga!)
I could kill you now, fuck a witness
I'm all about my business, you all about your bitchness
And I ain't 'bout to slow down
You oughta ask yo' daughter
about fuckin around with Slaughter, you bound to go - down
I'ma disappear when you meet the Lord
I'ma be at border G for the Singapore with mi amor
Or, bring a whore to be a slut, either or
We ignore casualties of war, you can meet the floor now

[Chorus]

Look here, yo
I get on my I-don't-give-a-fuck tip, fuck the money, fuck the wealth
Fuck your label, fuck your lyrics, you sit on the fuckin shelf
Lava so if I ain't in the topic of the constant the discussion fell
Tell the bitch that this dick ain't gon' suck itself
Nigga! I ain't a rapper, I'm a mercenary
Every verse I bury some'll blame it on the perks I carry
Been in disguise when I failed or I lost
But they won't know I'm a god until I'm nailed on the cross
And these rappers is a mess, sad if this they best
Magnum to they chest, they can piss me it won't matter what they said
They just rhyme, I just climb on the ladder to success
And may even bring in some niggaz that would rather me with less
My advice for the fuck boys, make some hard improvements
Career at a standstill, how you gon' start a movement?
Slaughterhouse the gang, take part in what we doin
or get steam-rolled over nigga, pardon the intrusion

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, y'all just heard my man snap, this is rubberband rap
Twist a Tropican' cap, pop a Zantac; everybody - down!
Faithful, I ain't fuckin around
Uppercut a clown for bein playful, pay homie with a frown
I don't think y'all understand the magnitude
Mathetical radical equations are easy to solve for YAOWA
I'm the square root of a truth table
In the booth able to raise the bar for some part of the 9th power
I don't pick at food, I devour
You think you hot dog? I'm walkin round with the sauer-
-kraut and onions, buns and ketchup, mustard, relish
Wow I think I'ma fart, everybody DOWN!
I don't want the crown, I rock a fitted navy brown
Well it's blue but y'all been colorblind since I done came around
Nobody can see me, I'm pissed off like my pee-pee
Then bought it in Ouija, be easy - Slaughterhouse this is it!

[Chorus]
