Song:   The Fantastic Truth
Typed by: timespitkicker@aol.com

this is the fantastic truth
where all your beliefs are dangling from a rope
this is the fantastic truth
where everything's beautiful and theres no hope for hope 

nothing is stable, it's all dependent on thought
the key to the universe is forgiveness
ego is the problem, the anchor is guilt
fear is the ship and ignorance is a belt
this life's a roller coaster a 5 second ride
aliens, angels and humans are the same inside
we're all separated from god, cuz of ego there's no such thing 
as evil that goes back to the thought part
cuz even the afterlife is fake, there's no sin
there's no heaven and hell, good and bad's a mistake 
cuz no religion is right but Buddhism is the closest
but still take slow sips, of universal knowledge 
from jesus and moses
kindness is your dharma, happiness is your karma
everything is your perception 
so don't look at death as bad cuz everything needs an exit
and yes there are ghosts, but they're just confused souls
reincarnation is real, we come back cuz of guilt
fear is the problem, intoxication helps
we live in a world where something the size of this
can take you on a trip, and make you see shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
drugs and alcohol make you feel content
but habit it a ritual that turns to cement
people tell the truth when they're drunk cuz it numbs the ego
how can one man tell another man somethings illegal
everything happens for a reason, words are things
so what you say manifests, be careful what you sing
forgiveness, ego, do you notice a theme?
forgiveness, fear, do you notice a theme?
forgiveness, guilt, do you notice a theme?
this is the truth do you know what I mean?

this is the fantastic truth
where all your beliefs are dangling from a rope
this is the fantastic truth
where everything's beautiful and theres no hope for hope 

there's no hope for hope cuz its not even needed
this world's a placebo your instincts are seeded
without instinct we'd all be extinct
cuz we wouldnt want to make love, ego is envy 
its the reason for jealousy, war and quote "evil"
its the reason for problems, this song and people
enlightened ones with third eye sight
try to light the way but we squint cuz it's bright
we're on separate paths heading to the same place
life's an algebra problem X equals faith
there's other dimensions, but they vibrate at different speeds
to where we can't see, so we say we don't believe
jesus and hitler are the same as you and me
read a course in miracles, this world isn't real
the big bang, banged when we thought of ourselves
dont get rid of your ego say you never had one 
cuz if you got rid of it that means that you had one
there no such thing as anything 
god doesnt even acknowledge the world, cuz its a dream
the universe shrinks every time we forgive
we're here to remember, to wake-up to live
all roads lead to good only close minds have gates
if religion didnt create god then why did they give him human traits
maybe Nietzsche was right or maybe Nietzsche was wrong
or your religion is right and these are all lies in this song
one day itll all make pennies, nickels or change 
everything occurs for reason, words are things
forgiveness, ego, do you notice a theme?
forgiveness, fear, do you notice a theme?
forgiveness, guilt, do you notice a theme?
truth, truth, do you notice a theme?
no ones better then anyone, do you notice a theme?
this is the truth do you know what I mean?
there is no truth do you know what I mean?</pre>
