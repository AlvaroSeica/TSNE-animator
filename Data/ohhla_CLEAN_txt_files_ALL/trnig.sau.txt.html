[Saul Williams]
So you don't like the way we're running things?
And you don't like the way the chisel glang?
You want to blame it on the government on why you got no money for your rent?
You want to start a revolution? And blame it on the institutions?
You know there's only one solution
Now tell me what you're gonna do son?

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
So what you gonna do?

[Saul Williams]
You wanna blame them boys in Lebanon and act like you don't know where they get it from?
You wanna project all your problems and murder every hope to solve them?
Would Jesus Christ come back American? What if he's Iraqi and here again?
You'd have to finally face your fears, my friend
Who's gonna hold your hand when that happens?
..Hey!

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
So what you gonna do?

[Saul Williams]
What do you teach your children about me?
What do you teach your little children about me?
Pimp, thug, bling, drug, lord of the undergrounded kings
How can you be so sure I won't call down the rain?
What do you teach your little children about me?
To point your gun way high and rob I sing and pray!

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
The nigger is you! The trigger is you!
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
So what you gonna do?!
The trigger is you! The nigger is you!
The nigger is you! The nigger is you!
The trigger is you! The trigger is you!
So what you gonna do?!</pre>
