[LongShot]
Check it out, my man Profound on the beat
If you catch feelings off this, you know who you is

LongShot the sure shot 'round here
To blow, from the go, you don't know about him?
Where you been? Tell yo' men I'm the boy around here
So they can go on, with some pussy-ass raps they sound queer
On the real, fuck a deal, when the dough down here
I can't get on the road cause niggaz slow around here
Get on yo' job! See that's the problem niggaz floatin 'round here
Comfortable, but what fo', you ain't gold 'round here
("You get anything out of that?") That's what I'm askin
Where's the passion, really hate to see us clashin
But you're not, feelin somethin
And I can tell, by your actions
Or lack thereof, I wish your man could be a man
And tell me to my face, realistically his plans (yeah)
But most of y'all was still a fan
I'm feelin grand and fin' to graduate
Glad you hated, or waited, to support me
You can not believe well I'ma keep givin hotter raps
I only got one question for y'all
("You get anything out of that?")

[Chorus]
You made it easy for me to leave you (yeah I had to go man)
Right where you standin
You made it easy for me to leave you (I couldn't just sit around)
Right where you standin

[LongShot]
You're cheatin and I can smell it
You're creepin and I can tell it
By the way you're not, talkin to me, no more
Comin over late at night
Smilin all fake like
Everything is kosher but it's not, and you know it
So I keep a normal face right, never ask you questions like
Where you been, where you at, I talk - to your boy
He told me 'bout the spanish cat and how he like to handle that
Besides the gonorrhea ma ("You get anything out of that?")
Cause I heard, from your girl, that he wasn't ever clean
An STD, don't mess with me, man I'm not, the one
No way, go away, I done learned without a burn
Love's the turn man a word, that we throw around too often
Who talkin, cheer action, that's the life and I'm rappin
So I'ma make moves and shake blues, I'm ov-er you
Lookin back I'm thankful that I double-strapped the jimmy hat
Yeah you fucked a man with scratch ("You get anything out of that?")

[Chorus]
You made it easy for me to leave you (where you at)
Right where you standin
You made it easy for me to leave you (I gotta, I gotta go)
Right where you standin</pre>
