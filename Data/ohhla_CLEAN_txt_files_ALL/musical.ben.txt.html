Went to napster dot com and remoted it voted it downloaded it
uploaded my song and promoted it
wack capitalism like a state capital prison
but free enterprise has risen
no executive decsision
its reflected in the rythym, trade a mp3
industry monopoly so let them be free
when we see; freedom of speech, freedom of listening
an opposition in the position to stop this missionem
unregulated trade, online community
we can keep the music free on time with unity
music will be and leavin 'em bleedin believin 'em
fighting for freedom, trade laws we dont need 'em
especially when living in the information age
contact your local newspaper, syndication page
with vindicated rage, let your voice be heard
them controllin what we trade thats just choice obsured
 
Chorus:
 
Go to napster dot com and free the music

An idustry livin for critical fast cheques
while i focus on the social political aspects
?massdecks? break necks when theyres wack tracks blastin
companys will fall when the nasdaq's crashin
but the internet is readily, steadily getting rid of thee
many who make our freedom a penalty
we need a remedy and napster is the key
fast and free mp3 trade technology
follow me. placin the population on music communication
pacin with napster and rapstation
infactuation with realness
prepectuation on musical freedom, now feel this:
napster is free thats the grand round total
to make incredible sound quotables downloadable
im holding you to let your voice be heard
them controllin what we trade thats just choice obsured
