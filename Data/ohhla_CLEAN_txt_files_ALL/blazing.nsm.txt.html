[Greg Nice]
Greg Nice, are ya blazin hot?
Smooth B, are ya blazin hot?
Ah no doubt, you know we're blazin hot
Ah no doubt, you know we're blazin hot
Ah Greg Nice, are ya blazin hot?
Ah no doubt, you know we're blazin hot
Ah Smooth B, are ya blazin hot?
Ah no doubt, you know we're blazin hot

Right about now I'll be stoned to the bone
Just puffin scarma with my man P. Tone
Got Big Fred makin moves on the phone
So we can lock shit down like Al Capone
Been a long time since you heard my style
Ain't shit changed, still buckwild
Been wreckin mics since Gomer Pyle
Way back when I was a juvenile
Everybody rappin like it's goin out of style
Can't roll up weed hawks on the prowl
Fellas say ho, ladies saw ow
No hump, no pump without creden-tials
Call me dough maker, now with sex appeal
Rock the British Walker, with the quarter feel

[Chorus]
Greg Nice - YOU KNOW YOU'RE BLAZIN HOT
No doubt - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT
Greg Nice - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT
No doubt - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT
Smooth B - YOU KNOW YOU'RE BLAZIN HOT
No doubt - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT
Smooth B - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT
No doubt - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT

[Smooth B]
Who's the messiah?  Was he a rasta?  Kill the impostor with fire
Number one MC, I'm much flyer
They tried to catch me by the cross, they lost
So I teamed up with Greg Nice on the mic, and now I floss
I flow faster, faster cause I has'ta
Some of my disciples call me the rabbi, the master
I opened up the 7th seal to reveal
Every rhyme that came out while I was gone has no appeal
So chill, let me step up to the front and get my propers
When it comes to dope routines on the mic, no one can stop us
or drop us or rock us, like Spike Lee we be the "Clockers"
Flavor Flav and all my peeps in the Bronx, we be them knockers

[Chorus]
Greg Nice - OUR STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
Smooth B - STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
Greg Nice - OUR STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
Smooth B - STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
