[Deeko]
Deeko is coming up Werd and them came back
With a new catalog for you to play back
If you dont like us you can just lay back
But face facts we coming to stay so take that

Nineteen eighty seven two thousand and six
Nineteen years on from when I was born
Got to be something until after Im gone
Even after that date the music lives on
My mind follows instinct 
This music never gonna be extinct like dodo 
At least not a hope no
I feel that my throats closed
At time I find the game hard to swallow
Like I was in some kind of a chokehold
Reaching for the top but when I get there I wont go
Oh no not ready to pass like old folk
Am so broke you hear it in my voice its no joke
I got no money plus small problems you dont know
Plus I dont want to get in to that
Couple of names I wouldnt mention in my rap
But I will stick to my word 
Told Werd wouldnt hold nothing back
Thats why I spit so absurd on the track
Never learned how to write rhymes or rap
Was self taught like someone threw us a notepad
And said give it your best shot
So I gave it my best
All that I got
Is the music moving on from the past 
Looking forward to the future

[Werd]
Yeah you can take that
Cause we are back

[Sample]
These boys were a completely different class
Yeah they thought
They really thought</pre>
