[Intro: DJ Evil E]
We're gonna bop it like this, the reason to come here
UHH!! Come On!!

[Hook: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Bop your hands like this, YEAH!!
Bop your hands like this, COME ON!!
Bop your hands like this, UHH!! YEAH!!
Bop your hands like this, YEAH!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Do this, HUH! come on! come on!
Time to get wreck and kick the so on
And so on, the I-C-E-T
O.G. M.C. - L.A.P.D. H-A-T-E-S (Ho!)
Watch the mic blow
I flip scripts, and the Dump drops the Ammo (Yeah!)
Time to get wreck with the new style (Come On!)
It's '95 and MCs are getting buck wild
But I - ain't a - nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one
Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if my flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts in my LP there's none the same
I ain't new to this

[Chorus:Ice-T (Trigger Tha Gambler)]
I ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
Switzerland (NEW TO THIS!)
Montreux ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
My homies ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
The Jazz ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
We ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
Fuck fuck around you'll catch left and a right fist

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Boom bang, I drop fat slang
When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, we used to roll with a street gang
If you wanna squabble homeboy, it ain't no thing
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
HUH!, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft, cause my records went gold
Sucker, you was a - motherfucking punk fool
Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine, and you're blind
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop goes the nine
Yeah, what you're dissing about friend?
Saying I went out, but you ain't never been in
I got R-E-S-P-E-C-T in the industry
That's something that you'll never see

[Chorus: Ice-T (Trigger Tha Gambler)]
I ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
Montreux ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
My homies ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
We ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
We ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
You ain't (NEW TO THIS!)
Fuck fuck around you'll catch left and a right fist</pre>
