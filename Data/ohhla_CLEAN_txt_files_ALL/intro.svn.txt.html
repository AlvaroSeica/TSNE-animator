[Intro]
Yeah, Sometimes you make those steps
And you never come back
God, I could never let him out the game, Cmon
Six years nigga, Cause I'm a soldier!

[Verse]
I cry out from the heinous slum
Back out where the pain is from, Demons sound like nightowls in my crainium
And yeah it begins wit light showers then the rain'll come
But when it does, The pain'll numb, And I just might forget where I came in from
And it's likely that I might be slightly sick, But can ya blame ya son?
Dreams get slightly young, Wit the sex, Alcohol, Guns, White, And meth
Slightly inviting death, Last night nigga, I ain't slept
I scream for ya christ and wept
Cause without ya, God, I flip out in violence, Every breath I breathe is a lifeless breath
I grieve for ya children that riders left
Because there ain't enough righteous left
Swing gats and they liars when decisive step, Never know what you roll til the dice is set
Life's real when all you got is all you got and all you got dawg, You had to fight to get
So tell me to get the caskets open and the safety's off all .9's
That when they take, It's all fine
They receivin the tape just to make if y'all mind
You have now awakened the greatest of all time
C'mon

[Outro]
Yeah, We back at it again, Homie
G'n up, Chuck soldier, Mama told ya
When you laugh, The whole world laughs wit ya
And when you cry nigga, We cry along also
So get it for all it's worth</pre>
