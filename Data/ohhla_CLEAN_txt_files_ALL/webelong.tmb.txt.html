I'm gonna put on my dancin shoes and find a crazy outfit cause
Tonight it's all about you I can't wait to show you all my new moves
I got a brand new two-step (two-step)
You're gonna like this outfit (outfit)
I got it all right here, no need for you to go
anywhere (anywhere) anywhere (anywhere)
Turn it up until it can't rock any more, Mr. DJ!
Look at what you made me do out on the floor - that's when we say

[Chorus]
Hey, hey!
We belong to the music, we don't answer to you!
Hey, hey!
That's right we ain't movin, we don't answer to you
It's a party we can dance if we want to
C'mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, hey!
We belong to the music, we don't answer to you!
