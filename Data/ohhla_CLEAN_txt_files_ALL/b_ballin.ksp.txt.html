[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I want more chips than maze now peep me close if you don't know
20,000 on Black Jacket on MGM Casino
Limos and fine hoes wait for me to exit
Cool as full of Cristal cuz that's the way we kick it
Once again it's now pass that dome to the Kingpin
More mail for room sales my gals be making ends
I pimp his favorites you single if you step with major
Fat paper I'm paying the cheese so watch you save her
It's gets greater been legit and intelligent
Player I got women from every state of the continent
I swing by staying high and fry til I die
Millionaires we idols I done witness homicide
Over petty change homies don't act the same
When you start from having thangs I was the fifth in month of game
And it's true no more friends when you start falling
I'm down with that Forty Street for life and we big ballin

[Chorus - 4X]
And it's true no more friends when you start falling
I'm down with that Forty Street for life and we big ballin

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Now picture me front row at the Tyson fight
Moscino down and everything feeling tight
Them cock gaze got me scoping all the high whores
While I'm high rolling I'm negotiating with big boys
Iced down with diamonds and Bogets
My nigga Forty got all the side bets
Yes this shit is phat look at Vince in the Freaknic
Rich players and tricks it's private business
Movie stars and entertainers acting out
Living large the Skinny Pimp is in the house
And I got game from years of experience
Tears thru years keep me above cuz I got street sense
And dead presidents the ruler of all evil
And all your fantasies legal or illegal
It doesn't matter get richer mane fuck them laws
And best in the best Skinny Pimp big ball..

[Chorus - 6X]
