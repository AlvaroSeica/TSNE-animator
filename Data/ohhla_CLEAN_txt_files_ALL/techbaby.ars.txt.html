I just want an Android... For my tele.. I mean smartphone
Let the data roam... I got two tablets... Laptops and PC's ah 'ninja gotta have it
(Ugggh) You still stuck on VGA.. my monitor display is AMOLED in Jean Grae
Bluetooth on my mouse... So I can right click and delete from yo' house
Don't know alot of pimps but I seen some Macs...
Aluminum tints with tin foil raps

(Oh what a feeling!!! )
Ah f@ck it I need a billion...

Gigabytes so I can download the universe..
reboot the data disk and watch how the Tron work...
Caress the motherboard put the USB in raw...
Design the interface to fall in love with time and space...
You ain't ready for an Arsun nation
I'll spread sheets that excel and punch a hole in pavement...
Homie I'm just saying...my upload speeds got modems constantly failing
I.T. connects won't callback I'm lethal sinister chip set...
Quad cores I breath thru
Blueprints of intricate circuits inside sentence...
Techcasso... Painting with high intelligence
Literally... Easily as I kill the beat
Venice Dawn... My horizon is the dream of kings...
Even Still -water running with mechanical steam
Syllable eloheem with tractor beams..
pulling in that hard drive cloud service worldwide
Earnings stripes paying dues burning mics making mooooves...
This Audiolution is televised...
Get it right mother f@cker this is Wi-Fi...
Why fight? Just step aside... I got a liquid cooled CPU Inside my ride...
(Oh what a feeling!!! )

Ah f@ck it, I want a trillion

Terabytes so I can hijack a satellite
Manipulating sound waves at interstellar heights
On special nights I hang glide with fiber optic kites
Erasing viruses with pathogens of dynamite
You damn right... This is air tight...
I flare mics shortbussin' it with A-alikes
Your Radio Shacks are Best Buys to Target
so I'll pop the cartridge and unload this rawness...(uggh)</pre>
