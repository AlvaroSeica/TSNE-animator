[Childish Gambino]
I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggaz makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my shit has got 'em dancin like a baby Oakenfold
Yes I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
ad these hoes are acting different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lyin just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck... you know I gotta give a fuck
My face is broken out, my shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes, were the potion
cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah I'm self conscious; go ahead, laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull somethin out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up - what the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit, quit writig gay shit
Now they see me and have to squin like asians
Cause I'm too bright like an old night light
When I do not talk I am being polite
Rap all night, act all day
Momma so scared I'ma waste away
I don't have time to sleep, I don't have time to eat
These niggaz got time to do everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin to a mirror
I AM JUST A RAPPER, can't make it clearer
To every kid in a world full of pain
Please give a listen to this song in my name
Childish Gambino, we are all children
I am just a murderer, man I just killed this~!</pre>
