[Verse 1: Possessed &amp; Psiklone]
When the fists fly your face is the landing strip
Rock your boat and your teeth will abandon ship
On sulphuric acid trips
Catch my drift and get dragged under the mid Atlantic ridge
Anti-philanthropist, antagonist 
You rappers with no punches - clench your pacifists
RA anarchists
And if you don't know the ropes then I'll make sure you get the hang of it
Fuck SWAT defences
Re-spawn below my enemy, block the entrance and lock the exits
I'm not what God intended, non compos mentis
Blasphemous, to hell with the consequences
Ninja that channels chi
Jumping across rooftops spitting crow bars at Brandon Lee
Just after you battle me 
You'll hear 'Finish Him' before I execute the fatality
Man of no humanity
Show me the full moon and I'll show you full proof of lycanthropy
Insanity 
Hollowed out human heads hang from my haunted house on Halloween
Amputee 
Write bars with disembodied hands and feet like thing from the Addams Family
Living catastrophe
Began to levitate as I disproved the existence of gravity
Assassinate presidential candidates
Have their heads impaled on my palace gates
Bathe in gamma rays
As a baby you played with rattles, I played with rattle snakes
I fire arms and hand grenades
Screaming faces are reflected in my metallic blade
Blood boils and evaporates
At rapid rates and comes crashing back as acid rain

[Verse 2: Possessed &amp; Psiklone]
My vocals shatter window panes
Inhale so hard the broken shards reconstruct in the frame
Shake hands and they disintegrate
Tattooed with asylum blueprints in case of prison breaks
I walked out the back door like Billy Hayes
Imitate the killings at camp Crystal Lake
Rebuilt Rome in a single day
Aim to eliminate all living trace of religious faith
In a fit of rage
I throw a discus with such force it won't fall till the next Olympic Games
Pissing in the wind of change
Torture methods to my madness - I bring the pain
Breathe and stop
Take me with a pinch of salt and 100 litres of tequila shots
[Hold up] grab a gallon of cold blood     
A packet of Pro Plus, back them and go nuts
Look but don't touch
Throw punches with the strength of silverbacks - knock out your gold fronts
War machine
My voice don't just stimulate ear drums it awakens dormant genes
Run towards the sea
Before we reach the shore the water forms as steam before our feet 
[Concrete jungle] I walk the streets
And free fall asleep from the tallest trees like autumn leaves
Sole survivor of a dead chain gang
Drag the other carcasses across a wasteland
Next level, make a change to game plan
My brain scan results are the same as the Rain Man's
Psychotic compulsions and urges
Spit on your grave 'til the corpse floats to the surface
Realize what I wrote in my verses
So my existence negates the phrase 'nobody's perfect'

[Bridge]
Yeah we back again, yeah we back again
Back to back again back to back - RA
Yeah we back again, yeah we back again
Back to back again back to back - RA</pre>
