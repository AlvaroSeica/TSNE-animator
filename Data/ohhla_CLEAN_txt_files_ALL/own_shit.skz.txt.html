Chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on, 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my, own shit 
Chi-ki-chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my own shit 

I'm on my own shit, blast the microphone shit 
While you're home alone playing In The Zone shit 
On some clone shit, I'm on some ol' "get the skits blown" shit 
On some grown shit, Im a get my shit known shit 
Check shit, the best shit, put you to the test with 
Latrell Sprewell, going straight for the next shit 
Always talk shit, rock with Top Notch shit 
Rippin' over beat box shit, that hip hop shit 
On some breaking shit, hate kids faking shit 
On some take your chick, taking pictures of her naked shit 
Turkey bacon shit, never eating pork shit 
Representing Cambridge, the coast and the port shit 
Sick of herb shit, using big words shit 
Im on some old, "Herb, Im a throw it in ya bird" shit 
Word, its the microphone specialist, wreckin' shit 
Get ya bitch flippin' like Mary Lou Retton shit 
Blue collar shit, Make You Wanna Holler shit 
Always getting over never paying top dollar shit 
Better get, benefits, messin' with the Menace shit 
Let your clique, know you got the new Skitzofrenik shit 

Chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on, 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my, own shit 
Chi-ki-chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my own shit 

I'm on some rare shit, chillin' drinking beers shit 
"Swear I could tear every motherfucker here" shit 
With the raw shit, studied The Art of War shit 
Try'na break your jaw so you cant talk no more shit 
Off with the drawers its, Check on some Pimp shit 
Got your broad in leather and chains like the gimp shit 
Shiiit.... you on some shit like this? 
Then you on my shit, so get off my shitlist, 
It's the Skitz shit, slap you in your lips with your biscuit 
Twisted, like your chick's hips when I dicked it 
Switched it, up another level shit, on some Rebel shit 
Rearrange your brain when you talk devil shit 
Bone in your broad's head like Pebble's shit 
On some ol' top of the line, never settle shit 
On some picky shit, "none of y'all can rip me" shit 
Get drunk, and run around naked like a hippie shit 
Hit you with a rhyme shit, dickin' all the dimes shit 
Like Prince, Im on some old nineteen-ninety-nine shit 
Rewind it, quote me in your phony off the dome shit 
Battle prone Skit, Check, on my own shit 

Chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on, 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my, own shit 
Chi-ki-chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my own shit 

Chi-ki-chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my own shit 

Chi-ki-chi-ki-chi-ki I'm, Chi-ki-chi-ki on 
Chi-ki-chi-ki my, my own shit </pre>
