[Intro: Sean Kingston] (J.R. Rotem)
J.R.!!! (Sean Kingston!!!)

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Your way too beautiful girl, that's why it will never work
You'll have my suicidal, suicidal, when you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls, they only wanna do you dirt
They'll have my suicidal, suicidal, when they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston
See it started at the park you stayed chilled after dark
Oh when you took my heart, that's when we fell apart
Cause we both thought, that love, last forever (Last forever)
They say we too young, say get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care, we made it very clear
And they also said, that we couldn't last together (Last together)
See it's very defined your one of a kind
But you mashed out my mind, you have to get declined
Oh lord, my baby your drivin me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Your way too beautiful girl, that's why it will never work
You'll have my suicidal, suicidal, when you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls, they only wanna do you dirt
They'll have my suicidal, suicidal, when they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in ninety nine watchin movies all the time
Oh when I went away for doin my first crime
And I never thought, that we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out mommy moved me down south
Oh wine with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be, that she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)
See it's very defined your one of a kind
But you mashed out my mind, you have to get declined
Oh lord, my baby your drivin me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Your way too beautiful girl, that's why it will never work
You'll have my suicidal, suicidal, when you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls, they only wanna do you dirt
They'll have my suicidal, suicidal, when they say it's over

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now were fussin and now were fightin 
Please tell me why I'm feelin slighted
And I don't know, how to make it better (Make it better)
Your datin other guys, your tellin me lies
Oh I can't believe what I'm seein with my eyes
I'm losin my mind, and I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

[Chorus &amp; Outro: Sean Kingston]
Your way too beautiful girl, that's why it will never work
You'll have my suicidal, suicidal, suicidal...
