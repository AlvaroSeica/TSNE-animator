[Busta Rhymes]
What I'm gon' do with Erykah Badu, I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun?  Fun, natural fun

[Erykah Badu]
I said what I'm gon' do with my man Busta Rhymes, I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun?  Fun, natural fun

[Busta speaks, while Erykah sings'n'scats]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh
Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu y'all, just one
One love everybody just one

[Busta Rhymes]
Well as I universally great the whole entire world
And focus on the energy that'll make your skin curl
The one strategy, the one universal plan
The master blueprint, one survival for all man
I Self Lord - AM, so divine
When me and my woman coincide as one mind; bear witness
One respect, one culture, one way of thinkin
One vision, makin the one decision on one WAY of livin!
Common destiny amongst all
One understanding amongst me and my woman, so that we can't fall
And keep movin forward based on actual fact
Yes y'all, my beautiful Mother Earth, respect her to the max
Can't mix dilute or tamper with us no more
We on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure
And what's mines is yours, especially if we move
in the same direction just for ONE common cause

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Just one - opportunity to handle our biz
Just one - mindstate so we can equally live
Just one - you know we only have one life to live
Just one - come together as one

[Erykah Badu]
As one - one family
As one - one little kiss now
As one - one entirety
As one - and let us all uplift now (talk to me baby)

I value (uh-huh uh huh) that I've found me (what what)
I gave you tea (that's right girl) you shed degree (oh yes love)
A family (one family baby) is what we be (uh-huh, uh-huh yea)
So that you'll see.. (right) .. c'mon

[Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
I know my woman's love for me, the way she cherish me
Fulfil my every appetite for the God Degree
Always inspire my encouragement, the right amount of nourishment
Secure enough so I don't have to ask her where my lovin went
When times is hopeless, sometimes I had to focus
on the priceless moments, when my Wisdom Body wouldn't notice
Cause you're my everything, what's mines'll be yours
Movin in the same direction just for one common cause

[Chorus]

[Erykah Badu]
As one - one family
As one - one little kiss now
As one - one entirety
As one - so let us all uplift now

As my sunlight, I bear witness to you
Bein the foundation, you can come home and watch the babies too
(The one way we agree on how to follow tradition)
This one family come in thirds, play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
(From all the struggle) that I see, that's why my love is for you

[Busta Rhymes]
You always hold it down for me, so I'ma hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food to come through

[Erykah Badu]
Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole livin condition (true indeed)
I know you symbolize the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities

[Busta Rhymes]
Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go 'round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours
Movin in the same direction, just for one common cause

[Chorus]

[Erykah Badu: repeat 2X]
As one - one family
As one - one little kiss now
As one - one entirety
As one - so let us all uplift now
