Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
Uh and I'm one of those
I don't wanna boss
But I waited most
When I was born I already made it to be a ghost
Life was a cage instead it had an age
That I had to wait hated everyone of those years
And I cried actually I tried I'm surprised my eyes froze nose couldn't blow
So emotional couldn't flow I supposed had it wait
For the autumn to go then the springs in my tears
Came and fell of the snow
They made a well in the snow, cheers!
Then had to be 18 to make a toast beer
And half of us gotta get to heaven just a half one
And I probably gotta die just to have time
But how long have I waited just to have mine

[Chorus]
Waiting for the sun then
Waiting for the rain
Waiting for the night then
Waiting for the day
Waiting for a holiday so we can get away
Waiting to come home, at home we never wanna stay
Waiting for the love, waiting for a love
Waiting for the love, waiting for a love
Waiting for me the sun got the stars
Girls for you waiting is a drug

[Verse]
And I wanna taste,
I don't mind trouble but add a little bass
I don't mind subtle but add a little waist
If it was me though what would you say
Got a cold blade following my bay
Send what you want bucks not under what you play
Throw one ain't long in Tanamo Bay
Skinny bup well fed walk one dread
Shout out anybody named Mohammed
'Cause no lie I know about a hundred
The right mom bled 'cause we ain't back niggas
Wonder K'naan dead
But now K's getting so much nom bread
Everybody turn butter chicken switching my story was written
Living my vision you've been waiting for either bug
Or waiting is a plural

[Chorus]
Waiting for the sun then
Waiting for the rain
Waiting for the night then
Waiting for the day
Waiting for a holiday so we can get away
Waiting to come home, at home we never wanna stay
Waiting for the love, waiting for a love
Waiting for the love, waiting for a love
Waiting for me the sun got the stars
Girls for you waiting is a drug

And I wanna taste</pre>
