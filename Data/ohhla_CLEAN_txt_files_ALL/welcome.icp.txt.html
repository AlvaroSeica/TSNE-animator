(Violent J)
Well hello boys and girls come on in see the show
Its the mystical, magical, great dark carnival
Don't bother lookin for parkin get rid of it
It aint like you ever comin back ya fuckin idiot

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
The carnival emerges only when you bout to die
And right now muthafucka you bout dead in the sky
So come and put your soul up on the murder go round
And we'll strap you down and spin you into oblivion

(Violent J)
I got a spike for yo neck with my ninja blowgun
Because I be the jugga-lugga don dada lada shogun
I swing my sword down and split you in two
Before you even fall I bitch smack both of you

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Welcome to our carnival, Fifty thousand juggalos
Freaks and weridos and killas at our shows

(Violent J)
Im just glad we down with em, hate to be yall

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
And have a juggalo shatter my skull for the carnival

(Chorus)
Welcome to the show, Shangri-La or the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, BITCH BOY YOU DEAD
Welcome to the show, Shangri-La or the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Welcome to my exhibit I be the Shags
Sit back and enjoy, relax ya nipples and nutbags
Theres only juggalos here ya know what we about
Swingin hatchets, Faygo, and a dick in ya mouth

(Violent J)
So they call us a circus we accept the role
Weve been sayin that its comin for like ten years or so
And everywhere we go from Alaska to Spain
I'm seein juggalos dancin in a Faygo rain

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Some of those at our shows feel a carnival high
I see em jump on the stage and float off inta the sky
They aint never comin back the carnival is defined
And all we can do is dream about em smokin a dime

(Violent J)
I got love for dead people and I hope to die
I got neden waitin on me up in Shangri-La
But if ya really wanna see the fuckin devil's exhibit
The shit is called "TWIZTID" run out and get it

(Chorus)
Welcome to the show, Shangri-La or the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, BITCH BOY YOU DEAD
Welcome to the show, Shangri-La or the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD

When its yo time, death is near, step right on up over here
Games, prizes, shows, and rides, its that carnival paradise.
When its yo time, death is near, step right on up over here
Games, prizes, shows, and rides, its that carnival paradise.

Welcome to the show, Shangri-La or the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, Its that carnival paradise
Welcome to the show, Shangri-La or the Dark Carnival
Welcome to the show, Its that carnival paradise

(Carny)
*Necks Slitting*
You dont like it, get the fuck up outta here

When its yo time, death is near, step right on up over here
Games, prizes, shows, and rides, its that carnival paradise.
When its yo time, death is near, step right on up over here
Games, prizes, shows, and rides, its that carnival paradise.

(Chorus repeats until end)
