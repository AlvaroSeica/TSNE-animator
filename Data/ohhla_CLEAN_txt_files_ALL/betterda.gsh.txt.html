Song:   Better Days Ahead
Typed by: [transcribed from jacket sleeve]

And now it's time
To gather all the things we need to fly
To better days ahead

Just wave goodbye
We've better things to do now, you and I
In better days ahead

Just take my hand
You're one I need to understand
For better days ahead

With you I can stand
As long as you respect me as your man
There's better days ahead
Yes, coming on

Just take my hand
You're the one I need to understand
For better days ahead

With you I can stand
As long as you respect me as your man
There's better days ahead
Yes, coming on

Coming on
Better days ahead
Coming on
For you and me</pre>
