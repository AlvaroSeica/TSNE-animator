[King Lil G]
What? alright
Lil g

[Verse 1]
My style's unique like a muthafucka
This song's for the hoodies &amp; the undercovers
Coming through in little ass dresses
All up in the pictures
Throwing up the "s"'s
Showing ass &amp; tits
We treat 'em like herbs
We pass the bitch
Never fall in love with 'em
You want some with 'em?
I ain't trippin' homie
You can go and fuck with 'em
I'm not dealing with emotions
With a hoodrat
I do what I'm suppose to
I'm like the flavor of love
I got bitches getting in line
That want me to fuck
Do I want 'em? do I need 'em?
The flip way is how I treat 'em
In my hood ain't nothing sweeter
First I fuck 'em then I leave 'em

[Chorus]
Girl you should roll with me
I could be a part of your fantasy
Take you to your spot
If you want let's go
It could be addictive
You just don't know
I could make you feel good
(good, good)
I got that shit
That'll make you feel good
(good, good)
I said that shit
That'll make you feel..

[Verse 2]
You know
I always got it crackin'
In a hotel room
Chillin' with this bad bitch
I bet ya you never seen her before
She don't fuck with you
Cause you will never leave her alone
I don't smoke
But I'm fucking with the Hennessy
Laughing at the things
That this fine bitch is telling me
I love a girl with class
That makes me wait
For me to get that ass
I'm tired of it being so easy
1 phone call
Then the girl will come &amp; see me
I'm taking over your area
Hoes in your city
Already heard of us
Come chill with young &amp; the famous
All about jewels, diamonds &amp; paper
Do I want 'em? do I need 'em?
The flip way is how I treat 'em
In my hood ain't nothing sweeter
First I fuck 'em then I leave 'em

[Chorus]</pre>
