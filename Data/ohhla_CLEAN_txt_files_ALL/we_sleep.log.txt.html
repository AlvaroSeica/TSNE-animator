[Ice Oscillator]
Yeah, whassup pimp?
Man, I'm tired, I'm tired
I don't get too tired
I got hoes for that

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We sleep days, late night purple haze
When it blacks out, pimps and players and hustlers get paid

[Ice Oscillator]
We sleep days, nocturnal night breed player of high speed
Dream bout nothin but cheese and hoes makin money on they knees and new Rolls keys
Sunlight offends me, so I sleep soft on a pillow
In order not to fuck up my do, I sleep days, nigga how about you?
I hit the track about 2 AM
Pimps play-in, hoes got them tricks, pay-in
If you ain't real busta stay in, now FUCK with me
Fuck that twenty-fo' and some mo', I save that worst sketch for my hoe
What you thought?  Everything I own is Hoe Barton t'd
Me wear somethin off the rack, nigga please, Iceberg nigga I sleep deep
Known to stand on a bitch, break my hand on a bitch daily
Bitch don't fuck with me, pay me!

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

Hey, we sleep days

[Silver Synth]
Players of the universe, we sleep daily, stays in leisure
Same procedures pay my way at night purple haze keep our pockets laid
Blown daily, nightly you sleep we creep
Hustlers gotta get they money, stay fly never fall
Streets ridiculous, vampire slice necks, what's next
Switchers gon' stay up, high on speed, streets gon' give 'em what they need
Sun up, we get the cash from the come up
Blaze one up, sleep days, "Groundhog Day" and shit never change
Stay on fade, pimps players and hustlers, they gotta get paid
Trash gets recycled nightly, don't hate us we the greatest of all time
Hypnotize my prey, sympathize you'll get slapped

[- unknown -]
Yeah eyes open, scopin, street hot got me floatin
Frozen, sippin Nosferatu potion
Night breed, you might bleed, daylights be sheisty
Dark pays, boy I sleep days and come up nicely
Advice be, to shake all the product too pricey

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

Hey, we sleep days

[Jacky Jasper]
I'm pimpin and trippin, spittin to kick it, trippin and flippin
those hoes who pose those egotistical hater staters
Invaders, P.I. invaders, 3-J-5-2 K-Y LeBrea's finest
SkyWorld, hit the flo' yo thorough with the dolo
with the hoe go mo' shoes move course, Beverly Hills superstar
Jacky Jasper master faster retainers stuck a lame
Strangers with arrangers, Capitol Hill pagers outrageous
Iniquities, liabilities, trick V's, we sees, slang ki's
and double release, we sleep deep
Strip tease and believes P's up thugged out smoked up
Comin to put enough dick and out
Turned out 150 mo' hoes, 150 mo' shows bro
Well hell, my cheese don't melt
So check the cologne, 3-J-5-2 K-Y smell
(That's right)
