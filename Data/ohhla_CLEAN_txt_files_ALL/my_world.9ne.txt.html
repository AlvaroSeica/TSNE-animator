[Intro]
In a world of misery
Within this, three planets collide
Brother Lynch, Dalima, Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride

[Brother Lynch]
Wait a minute
I'm from the West coast Conference like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me King of the Valley, all I need is a game jersey
Niggaz nuts and guts get served up
when I get it all spittin' up, mmm, serve it
Cut it up gut it up with cold cuts with another nut heated up came dirty
I'll be off of that kryptonite
Turn them into liquid ice
Stain his jersey
Leave him in the back of the El-Co
Like Helter Skelter stick it to them like velcro
Nigga I'm a bitch killa
I'm a nigga that's quick to rip ya
Paint a murda pictur' witcha
I'ma jackknife ya strip ya that night
split ya legs open and dick ya.
But then I'm into rippen ya guts
Eat your meat deplete with the meat clever
I did not see ya either
Fourth quarter receiver
Court order delete ya
Tech order to me
I'm bringing the seasoning
And a suicide note
Do or die low
Keys in the backseat
Cut necks I'm sexist rocked to get kidnapped???
Brother Lynch I'm neckless express this sexist

[Chorus]
Welcome to my world
(Where hearts are broken and laws are broken, potions pulling me closer)
Welcome to my world
(Dark's my ocean, my arc is floatin, but I'm living like I'm supposed ta)
Welcome to my world
(Where hearts are broken and laws are broken, potions pulling me closer)
Welcome to my world
(Dark's my ocean, my arc is floatin, but I'm living like I'm supposed ta)
Welcome to my world

[Dalima]
(Lyrical asylum)
Cause I've been dealin' with motherfuckers hatin' me for the longest
Could it be critical, cause I'm lyrically flawless?
And if I'm heated I cannot be mentally cautious
(Could be pain)
From the flame
Only kid to be held accountable for making the change
To whatever regards I'd rather be (insane)
In the middle of the stage
I'm bustin' like a 12 gauge
You could never relate to a nigga that'll hang you up
Slip a couple millions up and fill your drink for ya
I'm outside with a fully loaded rifle
Undecided whether or not I could cut up your brains or guts
(I get spaced out sometimes)
And it's like I'm a heathen
whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap, a motherfucker stop breathin'
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason? (nahhh)
Well let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin' future (and then?)
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of (my friends' souls)
Nigga you better get ready cause we done put together the fettiest chemical
frame
Energetic, well I embedded into your brain
Tech N9ne Dalima Brother Lynch

[Chorus]

("Welcome to my would" in reverse)

[Tech N9ne]
Fight this phantom, your freakin' family will fall flat
Bunk Bianca's beat 'em black and blue with a baseball bat
I might be a small cat
But I won't use discretion
Hit 'em with a weapon
They be steppin' with a mallrat
20 minus 11 I make 'em all scat
Not prosperous now
Tech's not with his crowd
He's lost in his clouds
Rather be off'ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I've been broke so I might swipe your chedda
You better get ready to get me, I got a vendetta
Coming to get a brother weed and money and whatever
Nobody said it was going to be easy
But to deceive me and leave me in the dark
And buried off in Acropolis
One day you gon' see me on TV
You better believe we takin' over this
And never the opposite
Rewrite my life
Give me life in a fight
For what's right I'll liberate, cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim slums then comes diablo
I need a medic cause a murder energetic in the cerebellum never tell 'em I got
One of the worst problems in the medulla oblongata you oughta go in one hell of a shot
No more darkness
How did I start this?
Feelin' bizarre shit
Like kickin' your carcass
I am the ruler in my kingdom and my dark seat's hot
Step into my world and your heartbeat stops

("Welcome to my would" in reverse)
