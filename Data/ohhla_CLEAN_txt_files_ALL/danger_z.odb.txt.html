[Chorus 1 2X: girl]
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
In the danger zone, in the danger zone

[Chorus 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Say what?
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
In the danger zone, in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
In the danger zone, in the danger zone

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
From coke to PCP, from Marie to Penelope
I'mma smoke this cocaine, like white boys smoke trees
Can I get that G, autograph me
I feel like a refugee, how people run up on me
Pussy is powerful, it feels wonderful
It got me worshipful, money is plentiful
Niggas is full, and plus you're bored
Any girl I pull is too wall for war
Power plug on, pussy turned on
I rocked it on, rap colored thong
Weight, I put on, strong like protons
I polly, then I'm gone, my style carries on
It's my party, holdin' too much hotty
Go and dance, and it's a robbery, actin' all snobbery
Real name: Moses, I pantyhose it
To all my hoes, industry, I sow's this

[Chorus 1 2X]
[Chorus 2]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shorts give me five scars, unlock this bar
Known to fuck you all, keep off that radar
Only crash cars, get pussy like calender
Premium cigars, stab that pussy, excalibur
Places, I'm going far, break that guitar
My dick burn lazer, I'm not your regular
I want ya shit, going insane, smoking out ya brain
You cracked, don't complain, that doesn't work, OK?
Party with a flame, so much I feel ashamed
No one else to blame, I want more, it's my name
You want trouble? You get it on the double
I break ya syllable, ya unacceptable
That excalibur bitch I fucked in the ass was unbelievable
I shoot you in ya muthafuckin' face, it's horrible
I'm uncompatible, swift, inchangeable
Teller available, get this money while it's capable

[Chorus 1 2X]
