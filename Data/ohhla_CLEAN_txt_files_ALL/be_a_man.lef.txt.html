[Intro]
What I love about his work is they are completely conscious
You may like them, you may NOT like them
You may say well what about this that or the other thing
But, y'know everybody pretty much acknowledges he's the man

[Jake Lefco]
I tell myself relax, don't forget to exhale
Even if your breath smells
While some won't accept you, the rest will
They're the ones you want to let chill, let's get real
Always keep your focus on your family, you understand me?
Nothin compares, can replace them with a damn thing
I think it's easy to slip
Cause the hardwood floorboard's greasy and shit
Half the people out there think they need to be slick
The other half's just waitin on a reason to trip
I tell myself ignore it, can't avoid it
You only get one life, enjoy it
Light your L's, raise your cups
Learn to laugh at your half-ass ways and puff
It isn't enough, I'm givin it up
Lil' knucklehead young bucks, listen to us
I'm not used to that, but I'm learnin
Just look at how I used to act, wasn't workin
I'm a person determined to change
But these things take time, I'm not a machine
A second chance is what a lot of us need
And my people want peace, but not a regime
I tell myself breathe, drop an LP
And see how the outside world receives me
In the meantime, wait tables
Get the bills in the mail, stay stable
Serenity now, label me later
When I get the widespread recognition and paper
I labor like a lumberjack, stackin chips
It's a trip ain't no comin back, that's a gift
Inch by inch, row by row, flow by flow
It's hard work, don't I know
My freestyles and written rhymes both sound dope
This hip-hop shit's somethin that I won't outgrow
You 'bout to see me rock a sold-out show
Watch, I'ma shine like boathouse row
I tell myself Jake you can, understand
Your future's all in your hands, take a chance
You need to take a stand, you need a plan
Quit floatin like Peter Pan, be a man~!
