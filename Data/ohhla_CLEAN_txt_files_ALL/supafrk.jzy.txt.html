[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Turn me up!
Straight like that, straight like thaaaaat
Hahaha! YEAH, nigga!

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Last night, it was Kush and Ciroc, I was super geeked
Cash flowin, money flowin, yah that's a super week
Got em for the 26.5, now that's super cheap
Cain't you niggaz tell? I'm just lookin fo' a supafreak
Supafreak, supafreak, yeah you know I want a
Supafreak, supafreak, yeah you know I need a
Supafreak, supafreak, yeah you know I want a
Supafreak, supafreak, yeah you know I need a

[Young Jeezy]
What it do? What it is? Whatchu workin with?
Er'rytime you see me on grind, stay on that workin shit (Yeaaaaah!)
All I ever wants a bad bitch in a Chanel bag
Street niggaz want her cause they know she got Chanel swag (GO!)
Straight like that, yeah I fuck with her the long way
Been braggin to my patnas, I been talkin 'bout her all day
Pull up in that super coupe, you know them diamonds glistenin
Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then (Woo!)
Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet
Now that I got her to myself man, you know I'm tryna get that girl wet
Keep it one thousand with you, I really think I'm diggin her
Cain't hear nothing but the money so she might just think I'm biggin her

[Chorus]

[2 Chainz]
Yeah... 2 CHAINZ~!
Rick James (Rick James), +Super Freak+ (Yeah)
She got that wet-wet, now that's a super leak (Tru)
Tell yo' baby daddy that he's super weak (Uh..)
Fucked yo' girl last night, it only took a wink 
2-2 Chainz charm cost a hunnid stacks (stacks)
Ten thousand wit my shirt off that's a hunnid tats (tats)
Okay I'm done wit dat, you can run wit dat, I'ma switch it up
This bitch I'm with is thick as fuck, I'm rich as fuck
Layin in the bed and I still got my semi tucked (Bow!)
Goin online like, "When they gon' make that Bentley truck~?!" 
Listen (damn)... My bankroll make 'em pay attention
The white girl like it when I whip it (whip it), whip it (whip it)

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
(GO!) She wit me if I'm wrong or I'm right, yeah she my type
Baby girl go and get the bread, she know what I like
Meet her at my low-key apartment, never at the house
Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth (Yeaaaaaah!)
Fuck with real niggaz, get money, baby off the chain
Long as baby stay gettin money, how can I complain?
Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills
Last nigga she was fuckin with was worth a couple mil (Ha-haaaaaah!)
Even when she goin for the low, says she's not a hoe
Yeah you know that thing is super wet, talkin Sloppy Joe
Said she like it when I whip it fast then I whip it slow
Even though she got a lot of names, I just call her blow
