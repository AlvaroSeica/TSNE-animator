[The D.O.C.]
It was recorded on eleventh of june, blood drips, the groom excited
Only later to be indicted
Rewritten so the whole thing went far from tense
Suspicion of murder, sequest for evidence
Residence, eluded to a crime scene
two sliced clean, now they got me in quarantine
Thee introduction to thee white world, nigga
'Cuz you been fucking with that white girl, nigga
They wanna stick me with a murder case
My first mind Jet, now I'm in a slow chase
To see my mama and give up, when I get back to the cut
I'm cuffed up and fucked up now I'm stuck
I know who, I know you know I do
But I aint saying shit, for they might get my ass too
and thats survival nigga, I'm on the brink
America, Justice look, witness my killer instinct

[Back to telephone conversation between OJ and friend]
(Say man you know what?)

Man you want me to go over there and get them motherfuckers? I'll do that shyt

[The D.O.C.]
Now I sleep, every morning some nigga creep up
To my six by six positioned with thee ammo clip
Saying shit like, nigga you'se a punk bitch
All that running you done nigga you aint done shit
I'm, escorted to a court room
Let the whole world speculate my fucking doom
Or I assume, Justice be a fucking joke
See they don't want me dead nigga they just want me broke
Nothing but perjury, prosecution illusion
confusion Dramatic, climatic conclusion
Put up in the box, vision
They don't like race nigga, so they wantz to see a lynching
Lets look at how they word it, they recount the verdict
Whats up with me up in the penetentiary?
The room quiet nigga, my mouth wide open
And I'm like damn them motherfuckers say I'm... {*echoes*}

[Back to telephone conversation between OJ and friend]
(Damn man this phone is getting ready to hang up man, tell my uh family my
kids I love 'em man)
Ahite I'll do that man
(Ahite peace)
Peace nigga</pre>
