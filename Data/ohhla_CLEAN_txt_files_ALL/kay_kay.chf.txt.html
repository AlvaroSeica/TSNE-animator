Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Me and my niggas we balling
We don't do no talking
I see it, I want it, I bought it
In my closet bout 40
Pulling up in my foreigns
I'm balling I'm balling

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Me and my niggas we balling
We don't do no talking
I see it, I want it, I bought it
In my closet bout 40
Pulling up in my foreigns
Pulling up in ignorance
You niggas is boring
I'm balling like I'm jordan

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Bitch love me cause she ballin'
Everyday I spend like 40
On my side a 40
So don't run up on me shawty
My money so gorgeous
And my niggas clap guns no orders
Bitches see me they on it
Pulling up in all foreigns
Tats all on my body
Don't make me catch a body
This street shit is my hobby
Wack a fuck nigga like hockey
These hoes love Chief Keef
They say they like my steeze
They say I got everything that a nigga dream
I say that his bitch wanna fuck me
He sneak disses ugly
I ordered the bitch a buddie
And I got him to hit it for me
I say that his bitch wanna fuck me
He sneak disses ugly
I ordered the bitch a buddie
And I got him to hit it for me

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Yo tell the girls we on it
Yo Fredo join he on it
He looks like Fiji water
But weÂ’ll take his life if we wanna
300 enormous
OBlock be on it
We don't give a fuck if niggas warn us
We gone run up on them
Blowing on this good chronic
I'm feeling like super sonic
Broke niggas make me vomit
Can't do what I do stop trying it
Bitch won't get none of my money
But in her mouth I'm cumin
Money call I'm coming
Can't miss that shit for nothing
I say that his bitch wanna cuff me
But she can only suck me
I ain't with the lovey dovey
That's why all these bitches love me
I say that his bitch wanna cuff me
But she can only suck me
I ain't with the lovey dovey
That's why all these bitches love me

[Chorus x2]

I put that on my daughter(Kay Kay)</pre>
