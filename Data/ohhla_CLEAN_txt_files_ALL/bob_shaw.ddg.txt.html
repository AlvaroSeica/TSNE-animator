I take a flight with my niggaz
I do it right with my niggaz
I hit the night with my niggaz
I rock the mic with my niggaz
I get around with my niggaz
I hit the town with my niggaz
I spit a round with my niggaz
I sport the crown with my niggaz
I got the flow with my niggaz
I do a show with my niggaz
I pull a hoe with my niggaz
I gotta roll with my niggaz
I spit the word with my niggaz
All on the curb with my niggaz
I hit the herb with my niggaz
Talkin 'bout words with my niggaz
Watch basketball with my tigaz
I hit the mall with my tigaz
Break all the laws with my tigaz
Man, Bobby Shaw is my tiga
I hit the sky with my tigaz
Get over high with my tigaz
Cut cherry pie with my tigaz
I'll probably fry with my tigaz</pre>
