give his kids all he can
give his fans all he can
what up to all the pioneers of the south mayne
everytime I hit the mic ima give you all I can
these are the tales of the southside

[Verse 1 - T-Rock]
one love to my niggas in the jail and traps sellin crack
these streets nigga I done been to hell and back
I done seen alot of niggas losin life over materialism 
murderin and kill for a trell of stacks
and it coulda been me
sometime I hate tryna even look in the mirra feelin it shoulda been me
got me livin in the gutter with crooks and thieves 
so I dont trust friendly faces looks deceive
watch yo foes
keep em close
learn like the back of ur hand and take notes
I done had niggas in my house one day next day try to rob me on ??
ya I gotta protect mine to the best of my ability
niggas aint feelin me until I come out with that artillary blast 
attack to em 
and let the coroner pick his ass up and take him to the mortuary facility
I been livin in the area over eleven years
I been doin it gettin riches on back roadz
never thought id be slippin without a pistol for protections
if they aint ready to murder you on flash hoes
so I gotta be strapped with calicos
for assholes who try to get a nigga fo the cash flo
blast hoes in black 4 doors 
yo back do catchin bullets like a poe poe sparrow
teflon is the war apparel
choppas sittin low in a black camaro
ima kill em like the plague of pharoah
aint no bitch in my bone marrow
you betta go get you a life and a job or somethin
and you really need to stop the frontin
I'm cockin sumthin
poppin somethin
let anyone thinkin they stoppin somethin
robbin somethin
speak up ho cuz I'm not fo mumblin
yall niggas sweeter than a flock of pumpkins
u dont wana see me go kamakaze how bout it
you niggaz ride out set up shop in london
I'm psyched up
psyched out
strapped up
iced out
dont cross me I turn lights out
smoke weed sip hen drank ice house

[Yung Hazardus]
keep yo friends close
keep the enemies closer
keep ur eyes open
and ur 45s smokin
cuz niggas mobbin out
nigga its jackin season
so when they try to rob me
I'm blastin with no reason

keep yo friends close
keep the enemies closer
keep ur eyes open
and ur 45s smokin
cuz niggas mobbin out
nigga its jackin season
so when they try to rob me
I'm blastin with no reason
