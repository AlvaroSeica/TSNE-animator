[First Verse]
Ugh, I can't feel a field nigga pain, devious skill
That make a strong willed
Nigga wane since a little nigga hang with the killers and distributors
Of cane they dismemberers of swishers then refill it with the Jane
Then they tilt it and they lit with a flame then they took a pull of killer
To the brain like (inhale noise) ah
Evil minded like crane
They became they deranged like the rover that I rolled
That was the Wings that I drove when I was a little bit older
Mayne declaring war on the deck like they the Joker
All while ducking from Bruce Wayne
While they poker with the devil
And our moon littened ghetto
Hello my name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was on back of a nickel like Monticello
When the underworld had to be smarter than Donatello
No honor amongst fellows
It's harder than sitting with a blind man and trying to describe yellow
Got me feeling like killer Joe
My life the album
Know the classics by heart and exactly how the filler go
Repeat it on my way to the liquor store, chocolate

[Second Verse]
Cause I can't feel the field niggas chains
Though I covet mine, so I covered mine in bling
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hon and uncovered mine again
Diamonds been under minded mayne, they give a nigga with no mack another kind of game
See money talks in another kind of slang
Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire as I accept the call
And listen to the life of
Getting religion and making voodoo in the sink of your cell
Reciting Al-Fatiha in the kitchen
In deed on his deem and in addition to doing dishes
Listen as I get schooled on the rules to rule
Fuel of fools, the obstacles, the cool
Had to slow it down homey
Chopped and screwed
Said blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only god's words can stop the wolves
And don't fraternize with pigs those kids will think your stool
Not at the bar but trying to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said borrow my jewels and bar the fools
Cause they a playa like the space bar and twos
Theme music to a drive-by, put it in your car and cruise</pre>
