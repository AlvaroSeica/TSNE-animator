[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
You wanna sip Mo' on my living room floor
Play Nintendo with Cease and Nino
Pick up my phone, say "Poppa not home"
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'
Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on tattas, sayin' "Big Poppa," now check it
You wanna be my main squeeze baby, don't ya
You wanna get me what I need baby, won't ya
Picture life as my wife, just think
Full length minks, fat X-and-O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard
Things got hot, you sent FEDs to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take, all I got
Another intricate plot, the tramp said I raped her
Damn
Why she wanna stick me for my paper
My Mo-sci-no hoe, my Ver-sa-ce hottie
Come to find out, you was hittin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin'
Came out on bail, commence to ass kickin'
Look in the door, wavin' the .44
All you heard was "Poppa, don't hit me no more"
Disrespect my clique, my game's imperial
Mess around and made her milkbox material
You feel me, stealin' chips, runnin' your lips
Cause of you
I'm on some real {*fuck a bitch shit*}

Hook:
[Kim]    Get money
[B.I.G.] What you say, uh
[Kim]    Get money
[B.I.G.] What you say, what you say, uh
[Kim]    Get money
[B.I.G.] What you say, uh
[Kim]    Get money
[B.I.G.] What you say, what you say, uh

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Better grab a seat
Grab on you quick as this chick gets deep
Deeper than the {*pussy*} of a girl six feet
Stiff ones feel sweet in this little petite
Young trick from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work out of town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard bound, ballers pressed to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm stressed to get it
Rather do the drivin' than the stick up jooks
Rather count a million while you eat my {*pussy*}
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while my tongue is down your throat, then
You wanna be my main SQUEEZE, baby
Don't ya
You wanna get between my KNEES, baby
Don't ya wanna see me whippin your 3 down the Ave.
Blow up spots on chickens because I'm mad
Break up affairs cause you know I don't care
You get vexed and start swingin' everywhere
Me shifty, now you wanna flip and hit me
Pull out, that's fine, I'll just cop on mine
So what now, I ain't got time to clown
So what, trick, I ain't got time for this
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vitadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things to make up, for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards, sayin' "I apologize"
Is you with me, how could you ever deceive me
But payback's for real
Believe me
Naw, I ain't slow, this ain't no bimbo flow
Just a little somethin', to let you player haters know

Repeat Hook Four Times</pre>
