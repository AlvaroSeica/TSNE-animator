[Ludacris]
If men sleep around we some playas but for women they be sayin

[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]
HEY HO! They be sayin - HEY HO!
They be sayin - HEY HO! They be sayin - HEY HO!
They be sayin - HEY HO! They be sayin - HEY HO!
If men sleep around we some playas but for women they be sayin

[Ludacris]
Now I been ridin up in my Bentley coupe, stuntin with the top down
Fo' 24-inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
24 karat necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things you can't take away from me - money, power and respect
I got it and hold onto it, you knew that I never let it GO!
You prostitute it, but money I never let it HO!
Speakin of hoes, oh yes we meet 'em and we G 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't wanna be 'em dude
I put my fist UP, I got the power girl
I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl
It's been a hour girl, it's time to GO
And if my neighbor see you while you walkin out my do'

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Nowww, can't nobody do it like Kim, only woman that can do it like men
VVS's be them gems - ho, now count that!
My-my-my money comin in, bendin them corners on them rims
Gold-plated checkbook, tell me how do ya bounce that?
I, bounce into position like I invented the Kama Sutra
But money make me cum, go and ask Luda!
And women cheat better than men, we don't disturb 'em
My motto is "What they don't know won't hurt 'em"
We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched
If I'm a ho, you's a ho, if I'm a bitch, you's a bitch
Know that I'ma stay rich so fellas do what ya do
Cause y'all don't fuck us, niggaz we fuck you!

[Interlude: Ludacris] + (Lil' Kim)
HEY HO! (Now we sayin) HEY HO!
(Now we sayin) HEY HO! (Now we sayin) HEY HO!
(Now we sayin) HEY HO! (Now we sayin) HEY HO!
If men sleep around we some playas but for women they be sayin
HEY HO! (But now we sayin) HEY HO!
(But now we sayin) HEY HO! (But now we sayin) HEY HO!
(But now we sayin) HEY HO! (But now we sayin) HEY HO!
If men sleep around we some playas but for women they be sayin

[Lil' Fate]
She likes the night lights, bright lights, big spendin
Lil' Fate been big pimpin pimpin
So don't be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
Cause you know that most you ladies tradin sex for money
So if you comin out the pocket then you might get laid
That's how the rent, car note and cell phone get paid
I bet the snakes all show, once you cut that grass
And I'm a pimp, so it's time that I exploit they ass
You see it's hoes after the party, it's hoes after the show
It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll
(Hey ho!) Here's some No-Doze, no dough, no sleep
Ho, on your feet, if you don't work you don't eat!

[Chorus]</pre>
