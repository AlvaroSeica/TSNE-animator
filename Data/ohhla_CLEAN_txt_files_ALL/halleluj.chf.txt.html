Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2]
Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya
Bitch chief Sosa getting that mula

[Verse 1]
Every time I look up my bitch starting some shit
Damn I hate a bitch that like to argue and shit
Got so much designer shit you'll think I'm all on this shit
There go the glory boys again they popping bottles and shit
I say if you need a feature homeboy hit up my line
I love when me and Ben Franklin be spending some time
Walk in the mall by all the stores bitch get on this grind
And if your boyfriend wanna be like me tell him get on his grind

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Tadoe off the molly he retarded and shit
Take a look off in my closet lots of robins and shit
And if MJ bring out the same shoes I'm still coping them shit
Bentley coupes and hummer trucks and raris and shit
I do this so lolo don't have to worry again
And KayKay can be like pops riding raris and shit
There go Chief Sosa, girl he ducking paparazzi again
You looking for me I'm in the woods with Harley and shit

[Chorus x3]</pre>
