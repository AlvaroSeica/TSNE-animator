[Intro: Future]
(That's what I DOOOOOOO...) Dark marks all on me - I'm just honest
(That's what I do...) Rock star my swag - I'm just honest {"This beat is so so rich"}
(That's what I do...) Everything exotic I'm just honest
Gold all on my neck I'm just honest {"Cut it up!"}
(That's what I DOOOOOOO...) Yeah.. I'm just honest
We got the club on smash.... yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Name another nigga hot - I'm just honest
Gold bottles on bottles - I'm just honest
100,000 on watches - I'm just honest
Coupes all on coupes - I'm just honest
(That's what I DOOOOOOO...)
I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
And we ain't never goin' back to what we used to do
I was gon' lie to you but I had to tell the truth - I'm just bein' honest

[Future]
AY! My piss comin' back dirty - I'm just bein' honest (I'm just bein' honest)
Got bitches kissin' on bitches - I'm just bein' honest (I'm just bein' honest)
I'm a rock star for LIFE - I'm just being honest (I'm rich)
Got a check on me right now - I'm just bein' honest (we rich)
We done turnt up in Platinum then we gon hit Onyx (cause we rich)
Ain't nothin' but a dope boy - I'm just being honest (yeah)
These niggas get shot, for being honest
I fucked her on the spot - I'm just being honest (GEAH!)
I'mma stack it 'til it rot - I'm just being honest (woo!)
And I'm, drivin', foreign, coupes, dash, two, hunnid (SKRRT~!)
Live a rich nigga life - I'm just being honest (FUTURE!)
Real street nigga ain't get nothin' but some pain from it (straight up!)

[Chorus]

[Future]
Got crack all in my draws - I'm just honest (that's what I do)
My diamonds ain't got flaws - I'm just honest (that's what I DOOOOOOO...)
These Zoes on sight, nigga - I'm just honest (that's what I do)
We can ball all night, nigga - I'm just honest (that's what I do)
You fuck niggas, y'all don't even know struggle (that's what I DOOOOOOO...)
You ain't even know why a nigga out here hustlin' (that's what I do)
Got flat screens in the trap spot - I'm honest (that's what I do)
Kept it real with all you niggas - I'm just too honest (that's what I do)
Took some bitches out the strip club - I'm just honest (that's what I DOOOOOOO...)
To the niggas all out in the hood - I'm just honest (that's what I do)
Lil Mexico fo' life - I'm just honest (that's what I do)
I came up shootin' dice - I'm just honest (that's what I DOOOOOOO...)
