[Legacy]
Uh, uh hoes in the club
Scared to get wet like toes in the tub
Give her a drink like new soul in a cup
What's in there? potion and stuff
She enjoys it too, like this is why I was avoidin you
She said she with this one boys in school
Showed her my dick she like "Boyfriend who"
She graphin girls as we walked out
So like we rollin with 3 now
I didn't know rappers had lockouts
They tryin to take the whole team down
Ha got you sweet like bloaw
Fuck being shallow betta deepthroat now
With the hotel neighbors scream so loud
Blast Ciroc and heard 3 doors down
Get it, get it, think a bit I'm a handle that ass like brakes on it
I got the brink shield on my cock, you can't take the dick
Hse play hard to get then play get it hard,
Then drove home in her niggas car
Like I hope he don't kiss when he takin her out
I'm a tooth came in her mouth

[Chorus]
Same shit different city from the way they speak
That's we adress these women from the day we meet
Same shit different city from the way they speak
That's we adress these women from the day we meet

[Ben J:]
Uh, clubbin everyone lookin good bartender pour them dranks
Bumpin witcha cups up tell the DJ to play that beat
Drumsoff this girl tellin me how niggas is scandolous
Bullshit talkin bout when ya girl drank you can't trust that bitch
She think kuz she in the VIP she about to be on
But what she don't know that girl hangin around my bros
She look go and they know, ooo she feelin herself
And she about the spill her cup,
But she too good for a lil bit of help
Girls get drunk and forget about ya
Wanna sit by ya when niggas
Drinks and lil weed supplyin
Ya'll losing ya minds said ya can't remind them
Chino hills and some drinks
It's the second out and you can't rely
And I'm a know her inner freak
She tryna walk with me kuz she know I'm ballin out, uh

[Chorus]
Same shit different city from the way they speak
That's we adress these women from the day we meet
Same shit different city from the way they speak
That's we adress these women from the day we meet

[Dizzy Wright]
Man I try to tell these nigga I was gon' be winnin
Independent livin turn my vision to my mission
Did my grind work took my instants turn my dreams into my business
Man my business make a killin bitch I'm headin for a million

Ya'll nigga don't wanna get involved
Ship that beat heat it up eat it up

Higher than a muthafuckin ceiling fan and I'm still the man </pre>
