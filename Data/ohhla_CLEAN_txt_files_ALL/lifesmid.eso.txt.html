[Eso]
Imagine a 5 year old, without a doubt in his mind
Where Star Wars was still real; and no mountain's to high
That mountain was blue, my first birthdays residence
And since then, I've made earthquake evidence
See, positive thinking's an actual fact
Way before gangster rap had you packing a gat
I'd watch Breakdance and idol Ozone
Way before you had that bling bling
Way before I puffed the home grown
Rented it so many times, back in Kurrajong heights
I wore out the VHS, imagine long nights
Day after day, I'd let it play, reciting the lines
Try and fathom what I imagined, inside of my mind
Grabbed a dollar off my dad Shabadoo I had it for ya
To save the centre, If I ever made it to California
And then the moment came, my mother said we're going
Jumped on a jumbo and we sailed across the ocean, like

Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, Then I'm coming at you [x2]

[Eso]
My arrival was an eyeful, of everything I thought
My Disneyland dream was everywhere I walked
With that dollar in my pocket, I was on a mission
Deep inside, I knew I'd meet him, I had gone the distance
And on that last day, down Melrose Avenue
2 worlds collided when my eyes saw Shabadoo
There was a crash, so you can capture it accurate
But the accident was no accident, it was actually happening
My mum hit the brakes, I jumped out the car
Ran to an angel, blood pumped through my heart
He showed me his Jag, he took me to his restaurant
Photos signed, B-Boy stance, this is the best of
My memories that I cherish forever
The last time I really remember my parents together
Lifting the movement, they never pictured I'd do it
But I'm a living example and I got the pictures to prove it, so

Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, Then I'm coming at you [x2]

[Bliss]
From the back of the yellow bus when PGC brought me new music
Singing and Mimicking what I heard, beat boxing in a blue Buick
From Virginia, continue to when Max and I met
With our heads between 2 boom boxes, making tracks on cassettes
Yeah we were sifting through them singles, searching for some instrumentals
Thirsting how to make 'em, when we learnt that we would be instrumental
Late 90's. back in NZ for a visit
Shit, my cause gave me Che Fu 2b S.Pacific
Brainfighta in my head, man it gave me light
Like Rachid giving Izm that X-Men tape that changed his life
And I remember Macka's mother's Joan, calling me on the phone
Telling me to turn on basic equipment and we learnt we weren't alone
And saw that SP and that MP up in Benz or a Beamer
Back when if you were white, you were speaking through the pen of a dreamer
Outkasts, from the farthest depths finding fate
Lay your own track, art express 98', check it

Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, Then I'm coming at you [x2]</pre>
