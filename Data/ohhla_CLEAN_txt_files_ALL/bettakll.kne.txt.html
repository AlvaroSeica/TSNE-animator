[Verse One]
You believe in miracles huh
Miracles ain't gonna save you
Look into the four eyes, two hands, two killas, two villains
Known as Kane and Abel
Ice Cream Man fronted me some yayo
Thousand 8 grams of that uncut coke
Bakin' soda, razor blade, cutting up
Get paid, fiends gonna choke from a hit off this big dope
Pose a threat, bitch made niggas put the rest back
Put terror through your bulletproof vest open up that chest
Knock ya head loose, juice leaking out yo FUCKIN' neck (Bout it!)
Bout to take over this rap game, like Castro took over Cuba
Po'po can't prove we using drug money
So fo now that shit is just a rumor
No Limit Ruler, Kingpin pourin' out gin
For my niggas lost in the fuckin' wind
Crash Dummy Hoes gettin' fucked for my playas in the pen
Cracking a bank it's on once again
Can we please get into some gangsta shit
Niggas is sick let's hit 'em up wit the 32 round clip
From their head to the upper lip
Got them looking like tales from the fuckin crypt
Welcome to the worlds most dangerous
Drug dealers, thug niggas, cap peelers, killers
Only way to stop these G's
Only way to stop these ki's
Is to drop me is to kill me

[Chorus]
I got me a glock
It's a glock for them niggas on my block
Cook me some rocks
Set up shop wit them soldiers on my block
Blow me a gun of that fire ass weed
It's a fuckin shame
Only way they gonna stop a G
Betta kill me bitch you, betta kill me
Betta kill me bitch you, betta kill me

Outside you and your who
Your fuckin brother
Y'all fuckin scumbags (Come on) {*echoed*}

[Verse Two]
Wicked heart of a killa you fuckin right
Hollow tips travel at the speed of light
Eyes stay dry, can't cry til you niggas die
Niggas bring knife to a gun fight the price is your life
Kane alias Stephen King
Kneel down kiss the ice on my pinky ring
Bitch you can't pinch, but my hollow tips
Make that faggot ass wanna sing
Merciless like Ming
Got you niggas in my pocket
Like a bag of Indonesian weed
Streetsweepers makin' neighborhoods bleed
Like tumbleweed usually wit cheese
These niggas betta have these fuckin keys
Ain't no scary hoes
Bold down here rollin' on triple golds
From Texas to N.O., niggas smokin and leanin'
Fiendin' for a hit of this bank roll
Got to sell your soul
Represent no matter where the fuck we at
Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder got big gats
Po' could hit you wit the mac and leave bullet holes
In your fuckin starter cap, nigga fuck with that
Welcome to the world's most dangerous
Drug dealers, thug niggaz, cap peelers, killers
Only way to stop these G's
Only way to stop these ki's
Is to drop me betta kill me!
