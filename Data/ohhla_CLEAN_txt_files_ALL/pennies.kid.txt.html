[Chorus]
Pickets in the city when we in around town
Next door neighbors tellin us, that is too loud
"Now neighbor, can you please just turn that mess down?"
This is the sound of throwin pennies on the ground

[Chuck Inglish: Verse One]
Turn it up, I don't think they hear it enough
Back when Jordans' and a gold chain was livin it up
Up top, I had a hi-top fade wit the high-tops
Watchin my highlight tapes from a skybox
Auburn Hills, Michigan - home of the palace
The place on the map where Isaiah beat Magic
Throwin elbows, had them rip my horn habits
with the 8-9 bad boy hammer on my cap
and you know Chuck wit it, now the girls get wit it
Tell 'em, kiss it off the glass or, pass or, kick it
Callin shots from the bench and, finger pointin picks
I'm Coach Chuck Daly, a/k/a Daddy Rich
I, meant Chuck Ing-ah-lish, the flicker of the flicks
All net, finger roll, Allan Houston off the pick
Yeaaah, the pick, of the litter with the kicks
It's new, we kick too - Who do? The Cool Kids

[Chorus]
Pickets in the city when we in around town
Next door neighbors tellin us, that is too loud
"Now neighbor, can you please just turn that mess down?"
This is the sound of throwin pennies on the ground

[Mikey Rocks: Verse Two]
Twistin off the faucet washin washin spittin while I'm walkin
Then I start thinkin I should hit the sink and get the flossin
Awesome and then I hear the Mrs. barkin
Not my Mrs., Mrs. Wilson from the yard across us
And while I'm flossin my teeth
I see her walkin 'cross that street than I waved
Like, what's up Mrs. W? Sorry 'bout the trouble we've been causin
The cops came over but it wasn't true
They said the music which is way too noisy
She said I know how you boys be
But, if you not busy come over for some lemonade later
I'm a Minute Maid man, made minutes into paper
The vapors, the kid that stayed rude that you will see
Sittin down with some twins now I'm wishin it was two of me
Whenever my sales hit the pavement
I'm 'spoed to arrange in the range meant to bang 'em
