[Talking]
Yeh, I had a conversation wid hop
I was talkin' to him
I had a conversation wid hop
Hip hop that is

[Verse 1]
I had a conversation wid hop
and he told me it wasn't hip what's happenin' to rap nowadays
We're believin' that our culturalized music
Is that falsely narrow rated crap I would say
It's funny now, ninety per cent of these rappers skills
Is dull like pencils that get worshipped
But it's even funnier when ya skills are sharper than kitchen
utensils and you still get chopped down now that's nervous
Ain't no such thing as being, true to the game
When open mic battles, these days are useless to gain
Being ruthless is the aim
You got the nerve callin' y'all selves emcees
Visual hollow heads is more like emp-ties
Extra terrestrials sent me to this earth
to turn ya into vegetables gent-ly, ascend-ing
From a place not really known to the average man
Where emcees get thrown out like extra baggage on planes

[Hook]
Fudge be rockin' it, yes he be rockin
To the beat he be rockin' it
He don't stop rockin' it
Rockin' it rockin' it
He don't stop rockin' it
Rockin' it, L-Fudge rockin' it
(x2)

[Verse 2]
In my life I heard a hundred renditions of realism
And I still don't get it yet
I'm tryna make my music's attraction to get it
Far more addictive than a cigarette
Instead of bein' caught in the spotlight and glamor
I stay true to the game, by flippin' english grammar
A distinguished anthem that's comin' to realisation by
Keepin' the stakes higher than that of today's inflation
My infatuation, to hip hop's got me stuck to the mic
Like junkies free basin' in subway stations
It's a proven fact, that niggas are usin' tracks this phat
But not takin' time to do they raps
Useless acts like that get waxed like vinyl
For not makin' the crowd scream ho like Thunder Cats' Liono
My cavalry watches me constantly
Therefore I have to spit shit that's more catchin' than an allergy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I X competition, like destinations on treasure maps
Raps travel at light speed freezin' time like
Water wrestlin' at night on polar caps
Words is more attractin' than a million march of black men
Fuck what you think I write rhymes for my personal satisfaction
Ya lyrics ain't funky like crime re-enactments
Front like you're a crime boss wid a mafioso name
wid more syllables, an ingredient to the bottom factor
Stickin' kids like velcro
My main objective is to spit lyrics
that struck the jaw wid them elbows
Naturally when emcees rap wid me, they witness tragedy
Notice I gt charged just like batteries
Me and hip hop go way back like butt cracks

Hook
