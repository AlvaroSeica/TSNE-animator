[Intro]
Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad..
You know I love you

[Hook: Intrigue]
But why do some it wasn't me
But why do some in front of me
Oh baby baby you was acting so shady
I thought that you were stickin' me
Another girl your tricking me
I gotta go cause I thought that I was yo' baby

But why do some it wasn't me
But why do some in front of me
Oh baby baby you was acting so crazy
I thought that you were stickin' me
Another girl your tricking me
I gotta go cause I thought that you were my baby

[RZA]
Girl you can't trick me
Nor can you stick me
You try to play slickly said you strictly dickly
But you and your friends you play the licky licky
I figured it out when I caught that hickey
Between yo' legs with yo' chocolate splippy
Now bob busy gotta taught you like Frisbee
Out the window
Off and away you go
'Aint got no time and no love for hoes, fuck
How many project sluts wanna nut or get touched?
And ramped up in the back of my truck
Or to eat the Benz up when yo' girlfriend would
Have her knees to her ears so I can slip in good
Bobby
Now walk the block with black hoody hat
Dog on the prowl upon to snatch the little putty-cat
Red red riding hood
And I'm the big woof
'Bout to puff off these pistols like I'm George Bush
And push push through your power-u
Goosh goosh explode my load
Have it running down your toosh toosh
Now you speakin' the round like a crook crook
Tryin' to look inside my phone book book
Bout to loose it all girl you shook shook
It 'Aint my fault that your love got jooks jooks
It 'Aint my fault that your love got jooks jooks
It 'Aint my fault that your love got jooks

Hook [1x]

[Beretta 9]
C'mon man save it go ahead with that boo
Oh you take me for a fool
I shit my sister for you
Claim on sneakin' sleepin' creepin' cheatin' you buggin' yo
Listenin' to yo' cuzin' now because she a lonely hoe
Siffle fickle minded dizzy tryin' to insult I
Now you wanna go and turn around and to ask why
Peace be out bounce
Spread yo' wings fly
Me loud c'mon how?
That aint god's style
C'mon man
You don't know me by now?
Three years in
I should of messed around but somehow
I kept it real
Girl I was ya' nigga' until
Ya switched the whole current
And if that's how you feel
Be out
Be out yo'
Be the fuck out

Hook [1x]

Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad ... You know I love you
