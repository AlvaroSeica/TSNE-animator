[female news reporter]
That verdict just came down
Those three detectives, not guilty, on all counts
Not guilty of the manslaughter charges
Not guilty of the assault charges
Not guilty of the reckless endangerment charges
That verdict, is going to rock this city, this community
The, groom's fiancee, the one who was killed
They were, they had said prosecutors, proved this case
But they put on witnesses
But I want to show you, let's just turn around
I want to show you, just what's going on here
{*BLAM BLAM*}

[unknown speakers]
We out here with the youth
The youth is saying FUCK THAT, it's enough is enough
Well you the final one right now man, y'knahmean?
So we gotta take back the streets, you understand?

(We face this every day, it's not an isolated incident)
(We all know, how we feel about the cops)
(And how they practice this institutionalized racism)

House by house, door by door, block by block
Neighborhood by neighborhood, we need to organize
We need to have our own system set up, to control our communities
We don't need these racist pigs comin in our neighborhood
with their hands on their gun cause they're scared of us

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Blap, blap blap that ass up {*3X*}
Blap, blap blap, blap blap

[unknown singer 2X]
What you came fo'?
What you came here fo'?
What you playin fo'?
Seri-seri-seri-serious

{*BLAM BLAM*}

[Paris as radio announcer with singer in background]
And yes yes y'all you in tune to Hard Truth Soldier Radio
Shoutin truth to power, representin freedom justice and equality
Comin in every city and every town
Every ghetto all 'round~!
Worldwide, where we ride on the police
cause the police beat us

[unknown speaker]
I don't care what they say
We're not the only ones that can bleed
We're not the only ones that can go to funerals
Unless they stop killin us, we're gonna take it into our own hands
We're not the only ones that can bleed... {*echoes*}

[male news anchor]
Recent police shootings involving African-American victims across the U.S.
Has led to a string of angry protests from outraged black community members
(There is a culture, of police officers out there that represent)
(a legalized genocide, and we need to recognize that)

[Paris]
1-2-3 in the parking lot
Make it pop so they feel when I peel the glock
Hear the shot, killer cops all drop and fold
Ring around the rose pocket fulla slugs and holes
Controlled beef like demo-lition, the mission
Most prof-ficient with those that don't listen
We merk this bitch ass pigs when we ride through
Me in the front seat, T through the sunroof
Now gas, break, shoot
Cause it's an eye for an eye for the lives took and the bru-
-tality and the rapes and the bleedin'
For dope and the choke holds, water hosin the people
But the blap make it equal
"Blap, blap" be the sound for the WOOP WOOP when we see you
It's a gang war sequel
Between us and the punk police for what they do 

[Chorus]
