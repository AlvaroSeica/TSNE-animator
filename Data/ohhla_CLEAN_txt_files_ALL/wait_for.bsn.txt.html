Typed by: Ben Clemmons

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Riding in a Chevy that should have been a Mercedes
Trying to keep my head above water so I stayed out the Navy
I, I, I made a promise to my girl
So I'ma leave time to bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket, took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was (it's too late)
Like nigga I got needs too
I found the man who gave me what I need now I don't need you
I barely got a text or call back, you old lying ass nigga
You a dog, out here chasing paper fucking bitches (it's too late)
Nah nigga ya too late, live with it, now you got a roommate
My homie served 10 years, it's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Ridin' around doin' my thing
Is it too late to be trying to live dreams
Turn 'em all real, reality is just a technicality
So is being fake so don't tell me that now I'm too late

[Chorus]

[Lupe Fiasco]
Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
But how long would you take?
Waiting's got me here in the first place
So the second I've been second maybe third in the worst case
Now on display are my word plays
Moving weight, that is such a trap
Move and wait I can't do that
I know I'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fraction way of thinking 'bout your plans
But I tried bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit Lupe from Chicago-land
But both of our chains say "Made in Japan"
German engineers designed both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right On Time but stay Miss Another Chance
Man, redireted at the girls
Not an ultimatum just an option in this world
Things come and go, and the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot

[Chorus]

[Big Sean]
Too late
I hope it's not too late
Last thing I want to hear is too late
yea, yea
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick</pre>
