Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Outro]
You do what you gotta do just to get your pot of stew
And once you've got a modest pot you want a lot it's true
And once you've got a lot, you gotta stop and lock your view
on those that need it most, get 'em on their feet and show 'em
How to do what they gotta do just to get their pot of stew
And once they got a modest pot they'll want a lot it's true
And once they got a lot... they gotta lock their view
on those that need it, get 'em on their feet and walk 'em through

[Verse One]
At the end of the day if my rent isn't paid
Then I'll be livin in a tent or beggin friends for a place
to rest my head so yes my bread's on my brain
It's a lead ball and chain but I get it all the same cause
Everybody's got a struggle man, you can either
let it stress you out or say fuck it, get up and start hustlin
Shit, stop makin someone else rich
Hell get selfish, then split the wealth if
I happen to get caught, time to sit down
Analyze the risk and revise the script
Nowadays I play it safe cause even loyal people lie
right to my face and try destroyin me behind
my back, that's why I keep the lawyer fees aside
I can't get by with what royalties provide
So I, steer clear of the rats and venomous snakes
They'll get theirs at the end of the day

[Verse Two]
Tryin to get some property under me and stay properly funded see
I'm talkin 'bout real wealth not Monopoly money
Cause paper ain't worth a damn thing, but acres of land brings
a place for my family to build and live forever
Gotta get the parmesan, gouda, swiss and cheddar
And keep it in the freezer so my kids can better
they lives with it and hopefully they use their brains
and get themselves in a position to improve and change
the lives of others, cause at the end of the day
Why strive and struggle for nothin makin minimum wage?
Cause if I get paid, then I could give some away
That's why I hustle for tomorrow but I live for today
You see
