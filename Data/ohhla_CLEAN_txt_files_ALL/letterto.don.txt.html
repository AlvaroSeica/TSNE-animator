[Verse One: Don Trip]
Please! No pity for a G
Though I got a son that I barely even see
I see him for a hour after that he gotta leave
On top of that I only get to see him for a week
Yeah! Right! Lucky me!
Well fuck Cal Tripo and whoever disagree!
I learned a valuable lesson indeed
But I'm just tryin to be the best father I could be
Apparantly I'm a unfit father
'Cause all I know is dope and all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm sellin dope to help my family get farther
'Cause no 9 to 5 is gonna prevent us from starvin
I'm sorry Jalen, I don't get to see you like I want to
I just want to let you know I want to
If the court grant me visitation then I'm goin to
But you too young to understand what were goin through
And your mama low down, she just doin everything to hurt me right now
Why? 'Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me she know she gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do 
She don't understand it this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court
So either way it's a lose lose

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
I'm writin a letter to my baby, I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over it's not done
I told ya mama I don't lover her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'm a be the bad one, I'm a be the bad one
I just wanna see my son

[Verse Two: Don Trip]
I'd tried talkin to the bitch
But she keeps using you as a barganin chip
And I am not the one to be barganin with!
That just made me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch!
I swear this shit ain't even right bruh
I ain't even got the chance to change the fuckin diaper
This is what I get for goin raw when I piped her
Thinkin that I loved her when I shouldn't even liked her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch I just wanna see my child!
Do what you may but you won't never make me bow!
Fuck child support bitch take me to trial!
Why you with this shit 'cause I ain't reach no vows
Bitch move on me and you ain't workin out!
So what it matter if I moved or workout?!
As long as I provide and put food in his mouth

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
I'm writin a letter to my baby, I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over it's not done
I told ya mama I don't lover her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'm a be the bad one, I'm a be the bad one
I just wanna see my son

[Verse Three: Don Trip]
Matter of fact I'm in school right now
Incase the music don't work and I could put the work down
My mama say this shit sure to workout
All this bullshit I'm goin through to see my first child
See his first steps, see his first smile
Hear his first words, teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out
Seein as the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice so he just looks around
I know she enjoy it so I suck it up and smile
But fuck this stupid bitch I just wanna see my child

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
I'm writin a letter to my baby, I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over it's not done
I told ya mama I don't lover her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'm a be the bad one, I'm a be the bad one
I just wanna see my son</pre>
