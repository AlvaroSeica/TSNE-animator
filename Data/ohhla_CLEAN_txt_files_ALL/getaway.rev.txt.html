[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[The Reverend William Burk]
I remember it was a tragedy, I bust five shots, he blew 'em back at me
My wiz got hit by three of them, screamin' in agony
Her blood was pourin' down on the passenger seat, so graphically
It made me nauseous, tryin' to be cautious as not to crash the whip
Below the clips I'm clutchin the grip of my Wesson and Smith
Full automatic, now I'm panickin', speedin' and shootin' back
Attackin' my enemy, tryin' to kill me from his Cadillac
This savage cat is gunnin' and my back's against the wall
My mother told me beef with these crabs would be my downfall
I felt a tear crawlin' down my cheek and heard my bird call
My name out before the undertaker put the flame out
The way the things are lookin' I'm lookin' to go the same route
I gave a last shout and screamed out to the heavens above
It's me who got you into this mess, please forgive me love
He was the ex from my wiz's last relationship
When she abandoned ship, he flipped and couldn't take it when she dipped
And especially when she got with me, previously he has stepped to me
But always had trouble catchin' me, cause my army's ready next to me
Blessin' me with the backup for cats who act' up,
We give 'em bad luck when slugs bust
But this time he caught us all alone and off-guard
Me and the girl were in the car, travelin' to the store, God
His number one intention: Even out the score card
I'm followin' on the dolo, just my heater and the war squad

[Chorus: Maria Elene Calederon]
Gotta make a getaway, if it was up to them I wouldn't live another day
But I gotta live, I gotta make it anyway
(Do you ?) fightin' with the enemy, gotta persevere, I know they wanna finish me
They wanna put it into me so I can't succeed, but I must proceed
You know you wanna stop this more than ever
If you're thinkin' you can stop this, never ever

But regardless, yo, I sucked it up and popped a uey
Thought I felt a bullet travel through me, without the pain
This scene is like a movie
I made a left into a narrow alley, bleedin' badly
When he tried to trap me I put two in the wheels of his Caddy
while he's flippin' over, I'm hoppin' back in the Range Rover
Starin' at my Earth, it's unbelievable, her life is over
I lean down and put one final kiss upon her lips
I hold her by the hip and feel the blood upon my finger tips
I grip my heater even harder, travel back to the car
That the fool had flipped, and I pulled him out
And gripped him by the collar, pistol-whipped him
And he hollered "Let me (down..ahhh...?)"
I look down, I saw the bullet holes in his leather Kenneth Cole
Feelin' sorry for his soul, when I hear the sirens
That's the way I know it's time to go, I'm dodgin' 5-0
Although I didn't commit a crime, the swine
Would still lock me up for life time, that's why they never find a brother
Travel to another location, but unexpectedly, I saw a copper checkin' me
He picked up his radio, said "Backup! Bring weaponry!"
I see the enemy on a corner, I need some energy to get away
The hunt for B-U-R-K's relentless
Crabs and the pigs all got me on their hit list, dun, I need assistance
I'm runnin' past a cellar, call my cousin Killa on the cell
"Scoop me in the lane, I ain't doin' so well, the jake is on my tail
Tryin' to lock me up without no bail" Told me he will be there in a half a minute
Maintain, I turned around and bust ten shots at the cop makin' the block hot
Buyin' myself time on the shot clock until my man arrived in a ride
And we rode out, blowin' the globe out, with guns out
Showin' out, blazin' 'em up, no doubt
Holding it down even though I had lost a loved one
I guess it's true what they say when you livin' by the gun, dun</pre>
