[Chorus: X2]
I drift from job to job, place to place
My life switches like the expressions on my face
And I love the chase, and although it ain't a race
It's my life and I'm not one to make a waste

[Verse 1]
I thought when I was older that I'd be a businessman
Not a full-blown Hip Hop fan making music and making a stand
With only a five-day plan it gets bland
I can reveal the hidden like a hair strand
Only simple shitty jobs so I doubt I'll get canned
Far from tanned but not your freakishly pale
I check the mail to see the response on the interview
Whether I passed, or once again I failed
Drifting, I've even sailed upon the Great Barrier Reef
Sun baked at the Portsea Beach, from girls I've caught some grief
Felt the pain from those close who became deceased
and spoke in relief after V.C.E
A good T.E.R., yeah that could have been me
But seemingly I took life like my rhymes, I just flowed
Kind of like some fools had their grass mowed whilst I let it grow
I'll let you know I occasionally panic
Get frantic over petty antics, but most often I relax
like humans in hammocks, or cows in paddocks
I reminisce like people in there attics
Pick up the mic and bring the static
and travel on, drifting upon song to song
The journey's long and yet to reach climax
Have your eyes gazing like the Imax, I raps
with high-hats, minds snap, I've sat in the wrong chair
I've been kicked out by the bear left in my underwear
Well they say one day tht you're gonna get caught
Hold that thought, as the spiritual nomad puts on his shorts
and the walk continues... and the walk continues

[Chorus: X2]

[Verse 2]
The bear was once there for this fellow, but he turned yellow
and hella selfish, appearing kind and cuddly on the outside
He left me helpless, we were good mates and then you dumped me
and I felt it like a tonne of bricks
Felt like a tonne of shit
Why have you done this you fucking punk bitch?
So I switched from being the kind and easy to befriend
To one who has tied his ends like your mum her tubes
Now I only hang with the dudes who really keep it true
and upon the path I pursue, wandering like Caine from Kung Fu
Now if I sung you a lullaby would you get emotional and cry
or merely punch me in the eye?
What I'm asking is are you quick to criticise? Minimise your growth
It's a checkpoint so in the shower I'm about to soak
with the soap, but no rope, clean away negativity and sparkle hope
My dreamscape helps me to float
and when I die people will relate to the words that I wrote
Well so I hope, Hip Hop helps me to cope
and better still build, and I'm not referring to my skills
bills or any of that, I'm talking as a person
The one that you hear rap
Giving me the strength to stay stable rather than collapse

[Chorus: X3]

[Verse 3]
Am I going anywhere? At times I don't know if I even care
But I can't bare the thought of a life filled with regret
I found a girl to whom I can connect, but is this the one yet?
My hair gets wet from the light sprinkle of rain
I walk in it to wash away the pain or the tears
For only so long can I use the beer
I got a car but I don't know where to steer
A blue sky but it still ain't clear, +Overcast!+ like +Atmosphere+
Cause it's hard here in Australia to make your career
out of Hip Hop, it's easier to be the failure
Even if you're sharp like a Schick's razor
Too many haters, not enough people to support the local
when it should be the focal point, independent vocals
Inhale 'em like a joint, and we shall continue to motivate
Tracks will circulate and we'll activate a more powerful community
Separation? Nah I'd prefer the unity
I assume to be seeing more and more regular releases from my travels
Making sense, avoiding babble, and random words like Scrabble
Upon the beats my life journeys and experiences are unravelled
and you wack emcees make me laugh like The Castle
Huh, like The Castle... like The Castle</pre>
