Song:   Down South
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Looking up North, while you're touching down South (muah)
I say it where I want it so you taking it out

I'm looking up North, while you're touching down South (muah)
I say it where I want it so you taking it out

I'm going, going, going, going, going Down South
I'm going, going, going, going, going kiss that mouth [x2]

Kiss that muah muah muah [x4]

Went down the kiss...
This pink pussy got no lipstick...</pre>
