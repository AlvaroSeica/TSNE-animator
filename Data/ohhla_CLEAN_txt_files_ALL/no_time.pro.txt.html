[All verses by Profile]
It's time to make amends for the sins you've committed
You ?, with the venom that you spitted
Everything was peace, you put that to a cease
Now you rallied a petition for your early release
From the team you used to run with, have fun with
Severed your ties, now you're over and done with
The choice you make, is the path that you take
I got no time for you and all the moves you fake
It's bad enough, you fronted on the next man's wealth
You tryed to play the game but only played yourself
Now you roam around town with the crew of the week
With the hopes of resurrectin' the respect that you seek
There's a thin line between, the fake and the real
You chose to cut it lose, now your fate has been sealed
Maybe it's the fact that you think that you're better
Now you wonder why you been stamped with the letter
Ever's for fake front, fraud and all above
And that's the reason why you never get no love
This is somethin' that I had to get off of my chest
That's the way that it is, so I'ma put it to rest

(Dj scratches)
"So we suggest you put an F on your chest"
"I got no time for you and all the moves you fake" (3x)

"I got no time" (echoes)

This is dedicated to the ones that's overrated
My problem is this, so let my vice be stated
You claim the forefront of this socalled scene
But constant move fakin' is your daily routine
Livin' of the backs of those who came before you
Talk a good game but now I got somethin' for you
The real way, when we step to the plate
Guaranteed to break it down so everyone can relate
And see the bigger picture, yo you're still small time
Here' the ? and the makin' on a lyrical climb
To the top of the game, with the mic in my hand
What more could you expect from the three man band
Underrated, ah never, my crew is too clever
Foundation is layed, now it's time for me to sever
The week links, it's a thinkin' man's game
You should have thought about that, before you ruined your name
And took the easy way out, no doubt you felt the pressure
Never thought you would be, top bailin' in my lecture
You know who you are, so take a seat with the rest
You're through, we suggest you put an F on your chest

"So we suggest you put an F on your chest"
"I got no time for you and all the moves you fake" (3x)
