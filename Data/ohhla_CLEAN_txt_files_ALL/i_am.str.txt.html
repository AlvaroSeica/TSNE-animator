[Chorus: Christbearer]
I can turn grey skies to blue
And I can make it rain whenever I want it too
I can float a battleship on dry land
And hillsides crumble with the wave of my hand
The man, that built a castle from a grain of sand, God I am...

[Christbearer]
Aiyo, I make them niggas see God
Like my nigga G-Rod, he the pimping in Ji'had
Bitch spring for the King, everything
Young hooker, high king, either Eloheim
It seem controlled, but unseen
It's Professor King Bean, number thirteen dean
Christbearer, like Theloneous Monk
With the hormonic funk, but come crunk, young punk
I can make the devil back pedal, the devil
Be wearing Aeronaval, black shovel, getting ghetto
I can rain blow in the wind rain
Thank God, came in the game, banging Wu-Tang

[Suave]
I'm likely shacked, taking flight on a track
Whether day, when it's light, or at night when it's black
Put the chaos to rest, and let the heat melt you
Swell, ring a buster bell, breaking loose like all hell
You fail to realize, that we hitting like hammers
With the impact, of a sledge, can put you on a edge
Eyes gun shot red, the Mary Jane got a flame
Stepping on the scene, made a gang of eyes strange
Cause the game to change, the wonderful guys behind it
Young far from blinded, one-two can grind it
Now truth shining, acknowledge, my prescence
Drunk with heater message, turn a Christian to a peasant
Hollow shots from the grill like a weapon
To your heaven, cuz you was half stepping
Cuz you was half stepping, cuz you was half stepping
Yeah, on the West Coast crew, nigga, SUUUUUUU!

[Chorus]

[G.I.'s]
Knowledge a track, thought strong in my psyche
I'm seeking the streets, defeating devils that might be
Knowing that my world, or should I say kingdom
Into the school of mourners, Killa Beez must bring them
The new and improved bring sales, get abused, divine
Rhymes that hit, straight to fit, like new shoes
Meaning firm and tight, unless you don't wear a mic
You tacky wack scoundrel, to you I say "goodnight"
Say we using big words without, any point, fool
Bow to these masters, to weak and annoint you
With the bound that we speak, uh, put in battle form
So we can warn reform, any one that's torn
I'm the inferstructure, in the line with the sun
Raping ghetto days with these babies from the slums
Blessed with knowledge of self, so I stays on one
React once, speak twice, but understand my price
I leave you thirty two degrees frozen, no chaser, just ice
Knowledge power knowledge, you been born to I
Self Lord And Master, slow nigga, don't try
My games twice the speed of light, I do the knowedge of sight
So I, nigga, no mind, your whole act is Jim Crack
Walk what you talk, so you can gain some respect
I'm a A-star, be on the streets, so you can bet
They got on the shine regardless
Like it's a sword slicing through the darkness
It ain't no debate, you need the knowledge, the wisdom
Understanding, and I'm straight, cuz I'm Big I

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
