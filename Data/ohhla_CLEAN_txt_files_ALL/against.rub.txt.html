Song:   Against the Wall
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Rubbabandz]
They say they want beef, but they don't
Cuz if my gun come out, it will smoke
And I don't want no problems with ya'll
So please don't push my back against the wall

[Rubbabandz]
I'mma come out swinging
Like Tyson in his prime and you hear them bells ringing
Eyes like I'm slightly Korean
And I ain't high cuz I been stopped OD'ing
You start the drama then you start fleeing
Put your panties on, run a marathon
And I chase your ass straight down a boulevard
I might catch your ass tripping at the Source Awards
I, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so called gangstas past
I got a universal worldwide ghetto pass
I can come through, anybody hood and blast
And my homey always told me, nice guys finish last
I always conserve my energy while a nigga talk trash
Catch him with his jaw open
Two piece, no biscuit, no doubt, it's broken
Go 'head, get it off your chest, but you gotta
Spit it through the wire like K. West
Bandz ain't the best, yeah right
People, shit rappers running around and they tight?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
