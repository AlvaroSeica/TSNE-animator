You know I never thought I'd see the day when doin it the easy way
Would leave me pondering an escape from the very Dream I chased
My favorite student knew it from the second that I'd seen his face
That I would never see the place
Again after I leave today
yet I tried to run the routine as usual
But when the realization that's its over gets through to you
there aint much that you can do
Try to pretend, that I am not at the end
But I ain't got any friends
So I gotta pretend, head on my desk, I'm nodding again
but-- on everything I love and cherish
I'd rather go out like Aerith
than to watch my dream just perish, blame my parents
I put my all in to them students put my all into the music
Told myself I'd never sell 'em short as long as I could do it
at a level higher - higher
heard that a servant can't call 2 different people sire, sire
so I had to spread my wings
pack my things, chase my dream, break off clean
stuck in the groove
cuz there aint no need to fight when there ain't nothing to prove
so walking away is your best move
no more khakis and dress shoes
calculated like chess moves
Now or Never..lets move
momma, know I love you but I gotta be a man
did it your way, so I gotta do it mine
left those childish ways behind
if I don't try, I'mma lose my mind
Here goes..
Just what WE need
Another rapper,Telling kids
That they can do the same
Leave a 9-5 and defy the odds
And if you work real hard you can rule the game
That's foolish mayne, funny how you can give every-thing that you have
Tell your story, and still they get it misconstrued; only heard the good half
I suppose, You know how the game goes
loot bring a playa much love
In the club, buyin up all the champagne
high on designer drugs
Cuz
You wasn't there when I put in my notice, yet you wanna speak as if you know my motives and you wanna speculate on my new focus, but you wasn't ready when I was approached with this vision to transition out of this life
and I reached out and you stabbed my back with a knife and you- told me I'd never succeed and I guess--that we disagreed on the look of success cuz you pictured money and yachts, running the block, while my plan was not to spit fire but to inspire kids to fly, whether they want to or not
Even if I fail this test
Lord knows I tried my best
Carefully ordered my steps
But I still can't shake this stress
Sold my land and all my dreams
Hit that field and sowed my seed
Cuz this faith is all I need
So here goes everything
i sowed the seed
i plowed the field
Took every chance
missed opportunity
and I crossed the sea
i crowned the king
sold all my land
so here goes everything...
do not remember my words, for they were only my thoughts
and not reflections of what had truly been placed on my heart
do not remember my lessons, cause whatever I taught
came from a text on a desk and is just a miniscule part
of what it means to exist, so remember my wish
remember the courage it took for me to take such a risk
do not remember my rhymes and what I wrote on a page
and what I did on a mic, or I performed on a stage
do not remember my beats, or remember my skill
just remember my passion and how I made you feel
how I bottled my emotion just to spill it in a verse
how I did what everybody thought of once, and did it first
get a nurse, cause I'm suffering and no one knows the cure
but I do, and it's simple all I need is a little bit more
more devotion more dedication
more hunger more education
cause stagnation is death
and though I know heaven's watin
when its over ---gotta say I did my all, lived my call
stood up tall, and did not fall, did not fall
and no accolade can quench this fire I got inside
call it farewell for now but no, it's not goodbye
cause yo, the time has come, to lift my hands
close my eyes, spread my wings
take that leap, for everything.. (everything?) everything.
the time has come, to lift my hands
close my eyes, spread my wings
take that leap, for everything.. (everything?)
so here goes everything..
i sowed the seed

and I crossed the sea
