Song:   Do What You Do 
Typed by: Lil Hustle 

(*talking*) 
Sometimes you gotta get your grind on 
Sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty, just to get your shine on 
(you sick for this one Sinister), yeah 
I tell a nigga to do what he do ya heard me, look 

[Magic] 
How many of you remember when I was broke, taking all them losses 
Things change, I'm the big boss of all bosses 
I'll come off in your office, hear me coming 
Like twelve horses, that's pissed off and fully running 
But I don't mean no harm 
I'm just trying to get mine, 'fore the good is gone 
Hard hustling, I gotta get it while the getting is getting dispersed 
I'm hitting hard, with intentions on hitting to hurt 
For years, I've been putting in work 
I be damned, if I'm kicking the dirt 
Gotta put a couple chips, up in my mama purse 
Gotta keep me debonaire, so I could flirt at every motherfucking concert 
Pass the Henn' nigga, keep the cup 
Just give me the flame, so I could blaze a dutch 
We smoke we drank, Henn' dog and dank 
We gon' do the damn thizzle, for the ones who can't so nigga 

[Chorus - 2] 
Do what you do, do what you do 
Do what you do, do what you do 
Now if you let me get me, I'ma let you get you 
My nigga do what you do, do what you do 

[Magic] 
It's getting harder, to ignore me 
You see thug niggaz support me, thug bitches adore me 
Clubs need me, and the streets demand me 
A few gon' hate when I'm walking, to get my Grammy 
Let it be known, that I did it for my mammy 
And all these cocksuckers out chea', can't stand me 
In denial, heart full of envy 
Tell the truth, to hell is where you send me 
In my face you smile, and acting friendly 
But to my back, you put a knife up in me 
I ain't mad at ya, you gotta get you 
Just stay out my way, and let me do what I do 
Hurt you behind mine, let it be written 
If any ass is getting kicked, I'm doing the kicking 
Leaving you with a slur, speech like Sly Stallone 
(Adrian), I take it you better leave it alone shaggy 

[Chorus - 2x] 

Do what you do - 7x 
Yeah do what you do, go head and do what you do 
Do what you do - 4x 
Now if you let me get me, I'ma let you get you 
My nigga do what you do, do what you do 

[Magic] 
I ain't tripping on...now I'm on my own 
You feel played shaggy, do what you do 
We could do it, however you wan' do it 
Whenever you wan' do it, shaggy do what you do 
Grrrrrr, now if you let me get me I'ma let you get you 
My nigga do what you do yeah, do what you do</pre>
