[Will Ski]
I reach and teach many masses at the podium
My rhymes are designed to flow smooth as linoleum
I suggest you thinj twice before you step to this
Verbs and nouns combine with a cool twist
Dollars I fold bend up pack it and stack it
I'll take your girl sport her like a Raiders' jacket
But you ain't said jack son get ready for action
My usual style causes fly reactions
Crowds get lift as if I was pumpin barbells
All hell it's gonna take an army to stop me
Watch me get into this like a pair of Timbaland boots
Kick rhymes that drop suckers like parachutes
Foes oppose so I'm forced to diss a fiend
Smoke me like nicotine wake up it's a dream
Punks talk junk but if they listen
Of course they'll find that each line is sharp
As a porcupine I get nice on a mic
And with your girlfriend I'll turn a kiss
Into a sexual whirlwind there's not another
The ladies hawk the lover I play them all out
Like a game from Parker Brothers rhymes I write
Stick to the mind like superglue
Smooth but rough like an Isuzu Tropper 2
Stupid respect all the girls say he's groovy
Cause I can get liver like a Schwarzenegger movie
Back up you better back up brother skip town
My style will horrify you like Tales From The Crypt clown
I'm sure to esculate don't underestimate
Shut your mouth drop the mic
And just bless the great rhyme I disperse
Burst until somebody's hit cause I'm avenging myself
Like a karate flick talking all that talk
Behind the back of the super funky rhyming spectuacular

[Suave Lover]
My rhymes alone make me remarkable
Hand me the mic and watch me do the impossible
I rip and run on MCs with a tight fist
Close my eyes grit my teeth
And swing for a hard hit for those who can't catch
This hip hoppin thinking they were close
In fact they're quite far from this
I break MCs into 123s for assuming that
The Suave was just ease please get out my way
When I'm in your area before I get the 1-84
To take care of ya cause you don't know
Who you're dealing with so listen brother
I'll run over you your microphone plus your mother
So get out of my way when Suave is making tracks
I'm switching microphones and breaking MCs backs
I'm nothing to be played with believe me you'll get burned
I kill MCs like Listerine kills germs
It's just a style of mine I kicking every kind of rhyme
And you are sure to find I put your head all in a twine
Crush any MC in a large sum treat rappers like pimples
So Suave Oxecutes them so sit down yeah
And I prevail all hell I pack more rhymes
Then volts on the 3rd rail so who's up next?
You wanna get dropped kicked?
Cause I'll put rappers down faster than a Van Damme flick</pre>
