Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Blue Raspberry]
Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child
Alone... I'm home... alone... at... home...

[Blue Raspberry]
I remember being told, that when I was 3 months old
I remember being told, that when I was 3 months old
You left me, left me, all alone
Alone, in this hard world...
When I was small, I point my finger
My daddy did the same
And tried to make me feel, like I was the blame
Why could you leave, your first born child
Alone, in this, hard world...

[Chorus to fade: Blue Raspberry]
Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child
And also I feel, that I'm a fatherless child
Sometimes I feel, like a parentless child
Alone, from home...</pre>
