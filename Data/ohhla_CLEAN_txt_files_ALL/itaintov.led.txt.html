[Fabolous]
I said we the best at making this green
I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team
F is for the family that's holding it down
I think niggas know who run this town
A is for the action I'm all about
Blow a nigga head off kill all the doubt
B is for the big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend they own money
Shots of 'tron at like 4 in the morn'
It ain't over til it's over, Loso I'm gone

[Mary J. Blige]
Lights stay on they don't fade
Pay my last call don't hold your breath
Everything makes something out of nothing
Move a mountain and still keep running
Never come down, make no mistake

[Chorus]
They can say, ay
That my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ay
All I see is the sun rising
Just when you thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word
It ain't over til it's over
Just when you thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you
It ain't over til it's over
It ain't over til it's over
It ain't over til it's over

[Jadakiss]
I smoke weed you sip on lean
People always saying what the hell does that mean
J is for the justice I did to the game
Lot of these niggas that's on is lame
A is for the way I airs em out
Coupes by the two's I pairs em out
D's for the dope that a niggas still pumping
12 hours shifts got the spot still jumping
Rocking on til the block is gone
38 a snub nose but the chopper's long

[Mary J. Blige]
And everything takes time so they say
When it's been on my side everyday
Every second gone is another way to come up
In the poor and then to crash into the jackpot
Twists and turn I can take

[Chorus]</pre>
