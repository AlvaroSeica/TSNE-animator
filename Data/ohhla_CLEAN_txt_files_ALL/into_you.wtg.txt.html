[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
We going platinum, Rah, check

[The Reverend William Burk]
Yo, I was on a mission walking down Stoney Island on the way towards Church's Chicken
Front to help myself to a big heaping fix, and about six wings and seven biscuits
When I seen this chick from a better of distance
So I guess the notion to go get the digits, this instance
She was bad too, had a juicy booty and a Chi-Town tattoo
I asked her "what that it do?"
They call me The Reverend and I show I'm impressed with you
Shit, it's like a blessing of you
I seen you from across the street, needed a close up too
Ooh, so I approached with game, such an incredible thing
To see you walk when you off the chain, true
So what I oppose we do, is that we get ourselves something to drink
and something to chew
Then take it back to the crib
I'm already sick, sugar pie baby, where do you live?
She said, she 75th, but her momma in the house doing hair with a bunch of the kids
And wanted her to run up some ribs
I said "You dig on swine?", she said "Nah, that's up in they biz"
Say well this the thing, you need to be with me, you need to be on my team
You looking so fine, it's like I'm having a dream
How's about Kenny's BBQ and Ice Cream?
She said, "Kenny's BBQ and Ice Cream? He got ribs, tips, fish and even chicken wings"
Right, so we can do our thing, go and reach in your purse and give me some green
Go and reach in your purse and give me some green
Go and reach in your purse and give me some green
So we dropped the pork off, then I broke off
Hand on her thigh and the shit was so soft
She rolled up a blunt for something to toke off
I'm in the crib eating, and smoking at no cost
Take, take, take, taking no loss
Say Rev, you a sure nuff boss
I could tell by the gold in your grill
And the game that you spill and the way you so floss

[Chorus 2X: Tash Mahogany]
Baby, you got me, into you
And I'll do anything you want
Baby, you got me, into you
And I'll do anything you want

[Rugged Monk]
Forgive me God, for committing these sins
Fucking these birds and fucking they friends
Serving all night, trying to make these ends
Smoking sherm, sniffing coke, sipping juice and gin
Flipping these hoes off double stacked pills
Til I met my match and I wanted to chill
But a nigga acted ill, posted with an ice grill
Nigga, you bluffing, you know you ain't busting
Say you was, and you know you wasn't
Say you does, and you know you doesn't
Tony the Tiger be fucking his cousin
Hoes I got, yeah, dime a dozen
Have 'em huffin, screaming and cussin'
Put that butter on an English muffin
Bang on that ass like a tight percussion
Bang on that ass like a tight percussion

[Chorus]</pre>
