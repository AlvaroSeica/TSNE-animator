[Intro]
Trunk Muzik...
Trunk Muzik...

[Yelawolf]
Straight from the back and the game I rock it (Yelawolf's got that crack, boy)
In the woods with the SK I'm cockin (you don't wanna play with that toy)
Droppin this heat like a (asteroid) good in the South like (Paster Troy)
Pull up inside of a 1977 sittin back and sippin my Crown 
and seven pimpin I'm about to get down
Look at me (changin lanes)
Twin pipes lookin like dragon's breath (roo!) Chevrolet's blowin flames
Yes I (know it's strange) hit you in the left eye (hold the change)
Bitch I'm too heavy to carry you don't wanna bury yourself underneath the 808
I drop it in your face like ugh

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the DJ's... out cruisin...
I got that trunk music...
Everybody hop in the Cadillac and idle back on the throttle 
and Chevrolets with the bottom, won't you roll the window down
If you cruisin...
I got that trunk music...
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf on the 808
Come and fade away, ain't no better way to get down

[Yelawolf]
I told you I was comin, said I'd be here in 5
And even though I brought you glasses, you still can't believe your eyes
But if you don't believe it by now, fuck it, just lean to the side
Hold up wait a minute, I don't really wanna leave 
without a single solitary soul in need of what I'm bringin to him
Be a sail and catch my drift, lead me to the door, check my list
Meet me at the floor, catch this fist, or meet me at the store, catch this lick
Build this house, flip this brick, real skateboarders, feel this grip
Movin through the alleyway and look at all the people trippin 
cause I'm on it choppin like

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
I have to be the hardest, I got diamond nuts
I piss excellence, Ricky Bobby lines 'em up
Catfish Billy half-pints 'em up, Yelawolf country fries 'em up
Put 'em in a duffle bag and roll 'em in the river then I... hold up
Watch what the fuck you hold up, dynamite sticks will blow up
Ghet-O-Vision got this sewed up, roll up, smoke up
Everybody wishin they chose us, but we don't give a fuck, you know what
I know you didn't see me comin but I'm comin anyway
Bitch Yelawolf is stylin on, ROO!

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf from the 808
Come and fade away, ain't no better way to get down!</pre>
