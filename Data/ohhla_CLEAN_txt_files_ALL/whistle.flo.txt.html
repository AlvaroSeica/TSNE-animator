[Intro/Chorus]
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby, let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby - here we go

[Flo Rida]
Look - I'm bettin you like people
And I'm bettin you love creep mode
And I'm bettin you like girls
that give love to girls and stroke your lil' ego
I bet you I'm guilty yo' honor
but that's how we live in my genre
Who in the hell can break the Rottweiler
There's only one Flo, and one Rida
I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pull a damn hamstring tryin to put it on ya
Bet your lips bend back around karma
Slow it down baby, take a lil' longer

[Chorus]

Whistle baby, whistle baby {*4X*}

[Flo Rida]
It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow
Shorty don't leave a note, she can get in it by the low
Permission not approved it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano, cause girl you can handle
Baby we start somethin you come up then part clothes
Girl I'm loose and want my whole body the same note
Show me your perfect pitch, tou got it my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out the candles
So amusing, now you can make it whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it
Give me the perfect pitch you never lose it

[Chorus]

Whistle baby, whistle baby {*4X*}

[Flo Rida]
Go on girl, you can twerk it
Let me see you whistle while you work it
I'ma lay back, don't stop it
Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it, on me
Now, shorty let that whistle blow-ow-ow
Yeah, baby let that whistle blow-ow-ow

[Chorus]

Whistle baby, whistle baby {*4X*}</pre>
