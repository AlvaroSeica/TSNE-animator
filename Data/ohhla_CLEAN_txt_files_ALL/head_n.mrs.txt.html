[Silkk The Shocker]

Yo, Silkk The Shocker, Serv-On (and the biggest mamma)
bout to rip this bitch.
Think not.  Believe that.
Trying to do somethin for ya nigga!
Uh huh, want yall to dance.
For the dance floor.
We gonna do somethin new.
Touch your head, your shoulders, your knees and your toes.
Slide once too and stomp your feet on the floor.
Throw your hands up.
Back in this bitch.
We bout to get rowdy.

[Chorus x2]

Touch your head, your shoulders, your knees your toes
I want you twirk that body right across the floor
Cause gangstas dont dance man we groove
I want you hoes bouncin your ass when you move

Nigga I step through the door
clear my throat like DJ Kool (cough cough)
Cause I lay back motherfucking fool, down more hoes then pool
You know like me comin through this bitch sick or
Watchin em with my dick hard
Put my dime to the side as I slide my way to the bar
Dig this hoe named Michelle
or it could have been Danielle, Tanielle
Kiss and tell I won't
keep it on DL (you know I'm smooth like that)
I'm smooth like that, I'm cool like that
And a wreck like effect, jack a fool like that
See, I see some hoe from the rear come over here
Whisper in here ear make myself clear
fortune let's break up out of here
See boy watch how I bust when I run through it
The game I spit get my hoes, fuck it alcohol and slow music
You know how I do it run the game on em
Playin, say the right words then it's like I'm layin on em
Huh, nothin wrong with making you bumpin and grind nigga
I been this

[Chorus x2]

[Mr. Serv-On]

Hit the bar I'm your star Mr. serve alazay
With the chrome keg, so how you play
Six hundred on them things in the parking lot
I like to bang alot, my babies momma never called alot
So aint no stop when I drop a flick for the chicken
licking on your breast
And your necks in the club step
So what's next, I'm bout a drink or two
One for me, three for you
I gotta woman you can be my boo
You say your name is Tiki so how you wanna see me
Twenty five for guest
on my rolex ticks on the wrist
I know you with this
Drop the number on the under you can be my hit
For the same no wonder you keep coming around
My homie young Silkk put me down with the game and the flow
If i teach you how to touch your head
your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I can flip that ass till the morning light it's my life

[Chorus]

[Mia X]

Might wanna shuffle all the way to the dance floor
Get your hands up, tell the DJ to turn it up
A bottle or more, with a straw in my right hand
I know I'm feeling good cause very seldom do I dance
I usually play it cool moving side to side
Be too clean to sweat, but tonight it's all right
Got my ice on shine like melt the club
And I ain't trying to go home until the sun comes up
nigga what
Aint no leaving with you
I aint no one night rome (who you think I am)
You'll be hustlin all your life
so you can afford these droors
Your pimping gotta be large, converse to the point
Then in a month maybe we can blow this joint
And you can meet my up and down southern rodeo
For sho', chewbaccas leaving niggas on my toes
Oh, the biggest mammas hard, laying non stop
Hold up, I think I see some playas kickin off the bus stop
And twirkers pop while them niggas watch em get hot
You all know this shit don't stop so let the chorus drop

[Chorus x4]</pre>
