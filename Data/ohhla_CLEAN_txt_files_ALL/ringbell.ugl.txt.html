[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Yeah! Hey Einstein, I like this beat man
(Yeah, it's nice man) Pretty good
Yo Diz, it's been a while since you did some straight braggadocionics
"Tell it like it is!"

[Dizzy Dustin]
I'm cooler than an ice chest, colder than a snow cone
Nicer than the nicest kid under the ozone
I'm worth every penny and tighter than vice grips
Your style is overpriced like a pair of nice kicks
I cover the terrain like my name was John Wayne
Shoot Â‘em up like Roscoe P. Coltrane
It costs to be "The Boss" like Bruce Springsteen
And I'm good for your health like a bowl of string beans

[Andy Cooper]
Einstein drops the beat, I say holy mackerel
Swoopin on stage like I'm a terradactyl
I can get funky like Ahmad Jamal
So people come to see me like the Taj Mahal
I wanna pen a classic, like Rachmaninoff
Turn it on and off with chops like a tomahawk
I never dug "I Need Love"
In fact, I taped over it with high speed dub
Ugh...

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
(Man, why you dissin LL?)
Well, it's not really LL, it's just that song I didn't like
(You thought he was pretty soft)
Yeah, he was kinda soft, "When I'm alone in my room.."
Well, anyway, we gotta do the chorus, here it comes

[Chorus]
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Okay, now it's verse two, right (Right)
Now your first verse was interesting (Eh...)
Some tricky flows in there
So I wanna see what you got for verse number two
Alright, here it goes "Everybody!"

[Dizzy Dustin]
When I do my thing I bling like afro sheen
Got an old lady, not in the bachelor scene
My mother calls me Dustin but you can call me Dizzy
Don't drink water with the bubbles or water if it's fizzy
So keep it off my rider, yeah, as if I had one
Why do I have to be so darn handsome
It's a curse like the goat is to Chicago
I'm out a here, you can catch me down in Cabo

[Andy Cooper]
Man, I'm a cat in command, call me Heathcliff
And I'm heading straight to the top, like a ski lift
When I'm swingin in this hip hop slugfest
competition fails like Bobby Brown's drug test
Jiggasauraus keepin it real
You're about as real as a three dollar bill
Blowin more hot air than a hair dryer
I eat cheeseburgers and I got a spare tire

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
(Man, you are getting a little fat there)
Well, you know, I'm trying to be more like a rapper, you know
(Well, alright, you mean fat and large) Well, you know
Anyway, we gotta do the chorus, here we go

[Chorus 2x]
[Chorus]
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell
(Now you can ring my bell all through the night)
Ring the bell, ring the bell

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin) + {Young Einstein}
That's right, now we gonna send a fat shout out
to all the ice cream truck drivers bumpin this song man
(Man, the ice cream truck don't even come down my block, anymore)
Why not, man?
(I got bad credit)
Well, that's Dizzy Dustin for you
Now, when it comes to ice cream truckin, what's your snackly choice?
(I'm feeling a strawberry shortcake)
Now I like the classic ice cream sandwich
What about you, Einstein? {Drumstick)}
(Einstein likes the drumstick)
He wants to know if he can buy cigarettes from the ice cream truck (Candy cigarettes)
Now we gotta hurry up and get outta here so Einstein can get back on Friendster, man

Hey, uh, what do you guys want to do after work?
Movies, yeah, movies
Yeah, I was thinking about seeing a movie
GENTLEMAN, a word?
Einstein (Yes?), the pork grinder you're supposed to fill? (Yes?)
YOU NEVER FILL IT!
Andy (Yeah?) the way you talk to customers? (Yes sir?)
IT'S NOT GOOD! (I thought it was witty)
You insult them (Ohh...)
Dizzy (Yeah) your bathroom habits? (Right?)
WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER THE BATHROOM!
Gentleman, I've got some good news, and some bad news. (What's the good news?)
The good news is, remember that trip to Brazil you wanted to go on? (Yeah..)
Well, you can! CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED!!</pre>
