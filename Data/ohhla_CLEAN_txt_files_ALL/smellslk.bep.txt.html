	[Will.I.Am]
Yeah, that's funky, funky
Yeah, that's funky, funky
Yeah, that's funky, funky

	[Will.I.Am &amp; Fergie]
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
Cause nobody's funky as us, cause we keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky

	[Will.I.Am]
The funk phenomenon, we funk you on and on
There's no need to hold your nose cause this pong sing like a rose

	[Taboo]
Big booty funk, toe jam funk
Underarm funk, like you headlockin' a skunk
Reaking like diseased athlete's feet
The stench didn't come till after this beat
Smellin' like drawers, no weezin', no pause
Put your hands up on the speakers get smelly ass paws
You knew we was coming before we entered the door
Cause you could smell the rhyme when we was walkin' down the hall
We bring the funk worse than a wet dog
Stinkin' like fat ladies shittin' out hogs
We drop enough shit and keep them toilets clogged
Keep the people jumpin' like the bullfrogs
The first one who smelt it ain't the one who dealt it
Black Eyed Peas keep the scent blind like delta
Funky like onions you fryin', sure is funky, girl you ain't lyin'

	[Will.I.Am &amp; Fergie]
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
Cause nobody's funky as us, cause we keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky

	[Will.I.Am]
Y'all, you funkin' with the funk family
The non fabricated factual faculty
We formulatin' up in a factory
Focusin' on the energy of fluid flow free
We flawless, everything is fo' free
We flourish and we flaunt our flavor freshly, ha
Can you believe we flip the frequencies and
Freak MC's, they leave all franticlly, but
Our intent is all to be friendly
But they fightin' when we start the freestylin' frenzy
I funk up your flat till your girlfriend beef
Fillin' all anatomy, bringin' me flattery, ha
She'll be diggin' these rhymes, phat ease beats
Like cellulite lyrics, all flappy
We bring the funk to your festivities
If you think something stank then it must be the Peas

	[Will.I.Am &amp; Fergie]
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
Cause nobody's funky as us, cause we keep it stinky, stinky
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

	[Apl.D.Ap]
Cellulite overweight stankin' MC's
Stench smells so strong it's insanitary
Cause you can sense me a mile away so chanky
With the jungle funk sound from Seringhetti
Meaty, fat, nasty like Ms. Fat Booty's tights
Gettin' dirty like mudfights and dirtbikes
Turning these drawers black that used to be white
And we shittin' on these tracks that you gonna need to wipe
The odour's so contagiuos that it shows up in your dream
Man you could pick me out like food in between
Your two front teeth cause you be lacking the streets
We got beefy ass beats that we bumpin' in the streets
We salty, not sweet, like stank boxing feet
Sour underarm funk you ain't washed in a week
And man we be reakin' every day and weekend
We could all bounce to the funk and the season

	[Will.I.Am]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, hahahaha
Yeah that's funky, yeah that's funky
If you smellin' somethin' funky then you know
It gotta be nobody other than Apl, Will and Taboo
Cause you know that
If it smells like funk then it must be us
If you smellin' fat funk then it must be us
If you smellin' somethin' funky then you know
It gotta be nobody other than Apl, Will and Taboo
Cause you know that
If it smells like funk then it must be us
If you smellin' elephants then it must be us
If you smellin' somethin' funky then you know
It gotta be nobody other than Apl, Will and Taboo
Cause you know that
If it smells like funk then it must be us
If you smellin' elephant shit then it must be us</pre>
