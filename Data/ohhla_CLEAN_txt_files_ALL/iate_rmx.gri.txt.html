Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You wanna talk about stress and the heart left hanging from the string like a necklace?
I'm the guy that you've been warned not to mess with, the farthest thing away from an
Emotional investment. Step back you don't want this; might look good in your head,
But I'm a monster. Caused more tears than I can even account for and it drowns my soul
Face down when it showers. I wanna die like a rockstar, all alone in my lost thoughts.
Can't live like I wanna and spoke no lies when I told you I'm a lost cause. But still
You gonna try and show me a different life and get eaten up alive and say...

(I ate your soul) And I'll eat you up go hide before I eat too much. (I ate it whole.)
And this is what I do, go hide girl I'm just like you. (I ate your soul) And I'll eat you
Up go hide before I eat too much. (I ate it whole.) And this is what I do, go hide girl
I'm just like you.

You wanna talk about luck? How nobody loves you and your whole life is shit? Girl,
I was born to be crushed and enjoy what it's like to be thrown in the mud. Go, and
Never come back, stay where the sunshine can cover your tracks. I don't wait for the fun
Times to savor the laughs, I drop dead at good-bye and lay straight in my casket. I wanna
Live where the blood dries, a lot quicker than some like. Without a smidegeon of guilt I'm
A sit right here until the next woman comes by. But still you gonna try and show me a different
Light and get eaten up alive and say I...

(I ate your soul) And I'll eat you up go hide before I eat too much. (I ate it whole.)
And this is what I do, go hide girl I'm just like you.

(I ate your soul) And I'll eat you up go hide before I eat too much. (I ate it whole.)
And this is what I do, go hide girl I'm just like you.

I ate your soul, I ate it whole...
