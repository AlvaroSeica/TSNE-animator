Diiieee Miss Illusion
Mmm yeah I love it when my lips are on her
There's a spark in our relationship I plant a kiss upon her
I fuck around too much and there's a risk that I'm a goner
So I've got her on hand like a badge of honour
The downside is she's never there when I'm lacking dollar
So I've got to try and go through a day without acting bothered
In the hope she'd leave me alone because I'm better off her
But I see that spark and I just accept the offer

So many people say why are you with her
And I'm like; she's a damn good kisser
She feeds my addiction
She leaks something different
The smoke from our last meeting has risen
Keep her away from all of the other boys
Cause you know she's every single cutters choice
Always there when the cold nights are lurking
Gotta keep hold of my Golden virgin

[Chorus]
I think she's good for me
That's why I don't want her to leave
She helps me get down even when I shouldn't be
She's there when I'm in need
But she isn't cheap
The last time I saw her
Mostly I couldn't breathe
And they say she's bad for me
But they say she's bad for me
But I don't think she's bad for me
But it's a bit of a miss illusion

She's got a mate called Benson
But he's a bitter of a WASTER
Always chats about silver and gold
But I don't think that he's safe (right?)
Plus his mate like's to come out at break time
Try's to act bad but I've smoked him like 8 times!
And if I take it the wrong places then I face a fine
And if I don't take it much she say's it's a waste of time
In fact she doesn't lie
She tells me that she's bad for me
Even when I patch things up I don't feel like I have to leave

I said I had to leave; I had to get away
It's funny when I'm not around I've seen better days
Sometimes I demonstrate how to set it straight
I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case
But when I'm chilling she's always in my mind
I do her out but the doubts are just glassed in side
I should respond in time but then I found out
The last boy she kissed coughed and died

[Chorus]

M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be
M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be
Can you please leave my vicinity
Can you please leave my vicinity
Actually wait nah I'll have another kiss
Oh fuck I'm in love with this chick what this its straight robbery
She's always there when I'm by myself and I can't remain solitary
Babe honestly
It appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty
You went from my pal to my lover
Now I see you outside with thousands of other
But you're on my mind right now
So I guess I'm coming down from another little fling
Gotta confess this

[Chorus]</pre>
