Say Mike Dean, dig these blues
 
[Z-Ro]
I remember situations, as an adolescent
I couldn't roll with the homies, they'd rather see a nigga stepping
Was it cause I was a school boy, trying to get my grades together
Stayed on the same block, but we never played together
All of a sudden, why they wanna come and kick it with Ro
Thinking they can get free c.d.'s, and free tickets to shows
No pay at the do', or you stuck out
And if you get in don't ask for nothing, or get escorted the fuck out
And say lil' mama, I ain't trying to go to bed with ya
You smoking, thinking I'm about to be breaking bread with ya
Keep my money in my pocket, never leave it with hoes
Put a ring on my own finger, cause I sleep with Z-Ro
I love my enemies more than friends, that's why I treat em so friendly
Cause they let ya know they you, but a friend hides his envy
Ain't no use in flagging me down, when I'm out on the creep
If I'm stopping my gun cocking, you dropping I live and die one deep
 
[Hook]
I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time
 
[Z-Ro]
It's the same everyday, everyday is the same
Dealing with fraud ass fellas, I swear it ain't gon' ever change
Even speaking on the hood, nigga the hood ain't shit
So when you see me I'ma speak, and that's as good as it get
But ain't no riding with me, getting drunk or getting high with me
Ten out of ten, I bet you would never ride or die with me
All my drugs are for personal use, cause I be stressing bad
Poverty and pain, is all I've ever had
I remember I was down in the dumps, no one lifted me up
Niggaz said I would never make it in music, cause I wasn't gifted enough
So why the hell, would I chill with y'all
I'd rather deal with felony charges, before I'd have to deal with y'all
It's one cup one sweet, cause it's Z-Ro only
Forever lonely, I don't need no phony homies all up on me
Cause when niggaz get to tripping, with they guns and shit
For me I bet my homies won't empty the clip, I live and die one deep
 
[Hook]
 
[Z-Ro]
It was hard to dream, when I was hooked on coedine
Killing myself slowly on purpose, cause humans make me nervous
And I knew, I'd have to kill one one day
Then how can I sit up in front of the Lord, come Sunday
That's why I eat by myself, and I sleep by myself I'm alone
24-7, I'm out here on my own
Plus I'm confident, that I would never jack myself
For all I know, homicides are homies watching as I stack my wealth
When I was tripping with my steel, pointed dead at my grill
All my real niggaz was laughing, didn't try to tell me to chill
I ain't never had a friend, like Joseph
Cause he don't give a damn, if I ever was on a poster
A skinny ass, never had a penny ass nigga
Treated like a food stamp, till I dropped a few jams now they digging a nigga
It's plain and simple, to witness
If it wasn't for rapping, who'd give a fuck about my bidness let me live one deep
