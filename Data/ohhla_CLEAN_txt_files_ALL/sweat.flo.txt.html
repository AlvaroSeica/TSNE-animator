I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before your screaming my name, oh baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like oh yea! You'll be like oh yea!
Partying down bumping here
Making us sweat
Put her lil' pedicure up on my chest
And we gon sweat, sweat, sweat
Ill be like oh yea! Youll be oh yea!
Making us sweat

[Flo Rida]
Hey!

Gotta put it down on the drop on the clock
Be the last one to punch out first
A little bit of sweat wont hurt
Youre a little bit hot Shawty wrecked Ur skirt
Right up to the top, good sex-no shirt

Go slow good hilling it get in with a jerk
Looking at the ceiling with your legs in the air

Giving you the fitness of that player
