[ VERSE 1: Don P ]
Let's see... how should I start?
Where should I begin? Fuck a pen, I'ma spit it straight from the heart
My life been fucked up from the beginnin to the present
My whole damn life been one hard fuckin lesson
Still I take every day as a blessin
The good days and the stressin
And pray one day He'll answer my questions
Tell me why am I livin if it's just to die?
When I spread my wings and fly, my nigga, please don't cry
Cause my time on this earth's been more like a curse
Everytime I think it'll get better that's when shit get worse
Still I thirst for the good life and pray that better days'll follow
Get what I can get today, man, fuck tomorrow
Another swallow of the green bottle, another hit of the weed
And try not to marinate in my sorrow
But I'm too tired to sleep, I'm too angry to weep
I'm too hungry to eat, man, shit is deep

[ CHORUS: Kim Morgan  ]
Live today, born to die
In this hustle got to survive
My only choice is to rise
It's like I'm runnin out of time

[ VERSE 2: Don P ]
Aiyo my nigga, let me holler at ya
I know sometimes it seems I only pop collar at ya
But I'm just tryina shine, it's been a long time comin
But I know change gon' come
And even though I got mo' change I know mo' pain gon' come
And for all the sunny days I know mo' rain gon' come
The good and the bad, I take it how it come
When it seems the world's against me I just close my eyes
Take a hit of the weed, buckle up and ride
Inside I'm feelin scarred, outside I'm lookin hard
They say the only way to fix it is through God
So I get on my knees and pray: Before you take me away
Let me make a better day for Lil D and Mone
Through them my name lives on (that's my shorties)
Through my name I be remembered when I'm dead and gone
I move on, hustlin in thls life of sin
Till I see my mama, Tupac and Biggie again

[ CHORUS: Kim Morgan  ]
Live today, born to die
In this hustle got to survive
My only choice is to rise
It's like I'm runnin out of time

Gotta keep your head up to the sky
Pretty soon everything's gonna be alright
I know you feel like givin up sometimes
But you know in this game it's ride or die
So when this whole world seems to get you down
And you're feelin all alone cause you're grown now
Trust in me, child, don't you weep
Cause you know your time is gonna come around

Live today, born to die
In this hustle got to survive
My only choice is to rise
It's like I'm runnin out of time</pre>
