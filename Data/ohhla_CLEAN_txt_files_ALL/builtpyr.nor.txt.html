[Intro: P.A.P.I.]
Yo! Large Pro! This my first Large Pro beat! 
You a genius! I'm honored! 
And with them grays in your beard, you even lookin more like a genius!
Crazy! Queens! Let me talk to 'em Extra P!
Yo! Yo!

[Verse One: P.A.P.I.]
Flushing Meadow Park drama heights a store
We play baseball then we slangin 8 balls
Mission impossible, alley catty shot
Y'all shot too, locked at the hospital
Jamaica Ave chicken patty with the coco bread
I know jamaicans on drugs call 'em coco head
Since +Lookin At The Front Door+ I always want more
So I got drugs and pumped more
This is probably, my philosophy
Geography, ecology, biology, psychology
I use to spit Glilette razors
Hand to hand with my pakistan man we made papers
Fish scale from Jackson Heights columbians  
I.S. 61 was raised with no republicans
And I don't mean to get all political
But Mitt Romney don't plan to do shit for you

[Chorus: Large Professor] (P.A.P.I.)
What the theory is? Sunlight to one at night
We the areas tell 'em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It's that Q talk serious
What the theory is? Sunlight to one at night
We the areas tell 'em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It's that Q talk serious (Second verse yo, yo)

[Verse Two: P.A.P.I.]
See I'm a student of the game how I pay attention
You so poor you can't afford to pay attention
Catch me downtown by L.E.S.
Or in Flatbush, Fort Greene D.Y.S.
(Who you be with?!) My niggas I was locked up and sparkin with
Killers that will kill killers marvelous
I know niggas never used a gun but got bodies 
You could do the math go and ask who you ask
A1, since day one just ask
A G-Shock watch flooded with the black diamonds
Louboutins with the spikes is for weirdos
I'm a hood nigga, I don't wear those
Still in Dapper Dan's designs still immaculate
Gucci ain't make that nah but it's they fabric
And still I get cabbage with 
Pun's style, gold piece lazareth.....ok!

[Chorus: Large Professor] 
What the theory is? Sunlight to one at night
We the areas tell 'em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It's that Q talk serious
What the theory is? Sunlight to one at night
We the areas tell 'em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It's that Q talk serious

[Verse Three: P.A.P.I.]
Yo! You wanna fly in the city you gotta go to Queens
Fly out of the city you gotta come to Queens
My borough brother John Gotti
And other killers big drug dealers wild ball players
Lamar Odom, World Peace Artest
Kenny Anderson, Kenny Smith, Lefrak the best
Yeah! Rafer Alston, Anthony Mason
Mark Jackson on the layup line they got action
Supreme Court where I fought 
But this ball playin, rep Queens on the courts
Talik and Kymani could've made it
And Raheem, Manchild the fuckin hood favorite
Orchestrated, sort of related
Black and puerto rican, like locs we stay faded 'cause
Yeah! On the real to the real! On the real to the real

[Chorus: Large Professor] 
What the theory is? Sunlight to one at night
We the areas tell 'em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It's that Q talk serious
What the theory is? Sunlight to one at night
We the areas tell 'em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It's that Q talk serious</pre>
