[Intro]
Oh, (oh), oh, (oh)
H-A-R-D-R-O-C-K yo BK no
Oh, oh, oh (EA Sports)

[Bridge]
You ain't gotta love what I do, like what I do
But you gon' respect what I do
I don't like nothin' about you, frontin' about you
We gon' get money without you

[Verse 1]
When shakedown come through, we break the live through
And sack ya quarterback, they can't find you
My defense, crush ya offense
Wit no conscience, we tolerate, no nonsense
When Warren Sapp on the line, it's trouble
We got a blitz to stagnate, ya whole hustle
Is I, one nine on my arm, like the jersey
Keyshawn John-son, shakdown, strong-arm
I rock heavy ice, when I'm cruisin
Caught a bullet like Jerry Rice, and Kevin movin'
He's going, going, the twenty, the ten
I'm heading for the endzone again, and again
The game shut down, the crowd scream, "What, what!"
Another touchdown, for Buck Town, is I

[Chorus]
May I, keep a little something for the G's
And, make a few ends while I breeze, through
The late night shift on some late night {shit}
On the gangstas roam
May I, keep a little something for the G's
And, make a few ends while I breeze, through
The late night shift on some late night {shit}
While ya momma ain't home

[Verse 2]
Hut one, hut two, hut three
You offsides, that's a penalty player, you can't touch me
The Mike Vick spin move, is e-ssntial
If it's in you, they can't defend you (nah)
You know the process, forward progress
When Brett Favre, throwing that ball it's no contest
Now on a nice summer day, they think
I'm gon' deep hit 'em, wit a running play, don't sleep
Ricky Williams, start runnin'
Don't matter who comin', they can't do nothing (one)
First down, but if it get crazy
I'm going for a field goal, gotta keep it real though
It's three minutes, before the game finish
I'm down six points, I'ma pass it to Emmitt
Now all though, I step, all slow
Y'all know, Red Cafe all-pro, oh

[Chorus]</pre>
