[Intro: Blue Raspberry]
Oooh-ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh...
Oh, baby...

[Blue Raspberry]
In the middle of the night
I woke up, yearning for you, you...
Old enough, in no time
Pretending that it was you, you, you, you, you
It's just something bout the things you do
Everywhere I go, look in my eyes, I saw you
I try to keep my mind off of you
And I don't know what to do, I know

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
I know you feel the heat
I see it in the way you look at me, what's good?
I'm not the one to speak
But I don't wanna let you slip away from me, what's good?

[Blue Raspberry]
Now you got me on the dancefloor
Straight up rubbing me, ooh
I try to move away to some space
But temptation's a crazy thing, oh
My body is saying yes
But my mind is screaming no, no, no, no
But before you do, what you do
I'll feel, I'll feel, I'll feel

[Chorus]

[Blue Raspberry]
I know you see, what I see
Cuz everytime I look at you
You're already staring at me
Trying to peep what's going on with me
But not knowing your the one I want with me
No one else can get my attention
I'm hope I knock on you, and I'm going crazy
My body is saying yes
But my mind, my mind, my mind is screaming now
But before you do what you do
I'll feel, I'll feel, I'll feel

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
