still on a motherfucking mission
biatch

[Verse 1]
I'm on a late night mission for some ass (some ass)
I had to pull over and get me some gas
and some rubbers and some drank (drank)
orlet me count my bank (bank)
to see if I can get a fat sack of dank
now let me think
about which bitch I gone fuck (fuck)
poorless bitch with the willing to suck
my dick grew quik without saying shit
cuz I'm the gangsta ass lay down with the hot style clip
that nigga H-D dog is a mack
my lil' homey Neo got 5 on the sack
and I gots 5
so that makes 10
so we got a dime sack
now we sip and hin (well allright)
and a nigga got drunk ass fuck
and now it's time for me to go and get my dick sucked (by who)
by a bitch I meat the other day
I'm rolling in my 6 tray down M-L-K
and uh

[Chorus (2x)]
I'm still on a mission
hittin' switches, fuckin' bitches, collecting ritches
I'm still on a mission
getting blowed away
and you know that's right

[Verse 2]
now it all comes back to me
befor I was a O.G. I was a B.G.
way back in 80-treezy
I puttin' it down on the eastside of L-B-C
21st is where we hung at night
and we squabble any nigga who wanted to fight (right)
and if a nigga really wanted to trip
I got a nine with an extra clip on my hip (whoo yea)
so get your ass of my block (block)
befor I pop you with my glock
and take your sack of rocks (rocks)
you know I don't got no love for your ass
so hurry up, nigga move fast
befor I have second thoughts about breaking you off
like L-B I'll be killin' you soft
and I'll be sure to break you off proper
I beat your ass down and bush u like a copper
you know why

[Chorus (2x)]

[Verse 3]
you better watch yourself
when I'm slanging this rhymes
I'm coming with the douser and the funky lines
real fast, I blast, take your cash, and stiff
niggas don't wanna trip cause my weapon is ciff
one of 'em shurt
didn't gave a fuck if it didn't hurt
I love set tripping and I'm puts in work (on who)
on any nigga who fiddin to didding in me
I got a 9 millimeter and my heat of sceats
I'll ship that will take you off set so quik (damn)
you'll be lying in the dirt with a dust of dits
shit, it's a shame when you got no game
and you straight dissin' nigga tryna get a name
don't change
be yourself in this hard game
show no type of shame
and express your pain
and, to be the shit and don't be dissin'
and lookin' me loc
I'm still on a mission

[Chorus (4x)]</pre>
