Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Say when I look inside I've got this bad bad feeling about her
You know she cheated and she lied
And she's throwing it all away
But if you come to me
Try to tell me that you're sorry
You better shut your mouth
And kiss your ass away
I say how many times must I come up with all of the answers
But you're the meaning and the reasons
That you're giving it up today
But if you come to me
Try to tell me that you love me
You better get down on your knees and start to pray
I never needed anybody
Quite like this
Don't try to tell me how to be
Don't try to tell me how to act
You might get smacked
Right in the head
And then you turn around baby
And you might be dead
And I know that I'm feelin'
Kind of numb in my fingers
But straight down to my toes
But let me give her up
And feel her up
And use her up
Until she gets cold
Whoa whoa
Baby won't you step in line
Just let me grab another piece of your behind
You better come on girl
And give it to me now
Tim wu (the man) sax solo
Well some take lines get drunk talk shit and waste their time
__ (this part's a bitch)
If your lucky
Someone's comin' round
I'm calling you to me
Don't take time
Don't take long
To be forgetting of our pact
........
Take another thing back
Some times you think it's right
For you to try and tell me how to be
But if your comin
It best for you to ask
So I dont come all the way
Come on now
Come on later
With the offer every day
If there's a lesson to be learned
This is the only way
I'll catch the longest barrel rides
Deep in the barrels where I ride
It takes 12 beers to get me right
But that's okay
But that's okay
Oh yeah
I'll catch the longest barrel rides
Deep in the barrels where I ride
It takes 12 beers to get me right
But that's okay
But that's okay
Oh yeah
Low tide jetty is where I play
You best stay lurkin' out my way
I don't care what you have to say
No way</pre>
