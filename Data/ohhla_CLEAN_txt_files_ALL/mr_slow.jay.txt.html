[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
Mr. Slow Flow is back again
So telephone - but then again tell a friend
You suckers better hold your ground when I come around
Cause pound for pound I beat the perpetrators down
I house the mic and I mash like Scarface
I'm treated like a criminal because I got a dark face
But I ain't trippin on that other color
I make peace with the brother and chill with the other
So drop the AK's, nines and the 12-gauge
So we can get busy on the flow and on the stage
So back to my program, on which I am
'Bout to slam another dope jam
Last time around the sound wasn't profound
But this time around I got 'em all spellbound
And you know me, the MC, not the wanna-be
I drop the serious beat and make it funky, G

(Mr. Slow Flow)
I'm Mr. Slow Flow

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
I held on to the beat and made it slam real well
Grabbed the mic and just told my tale
You know I made the beat deep to slam on any street
Section or corner, baby, I'm all on ya
See what I'm sayin what I'm sayin because it's sayable
And don't front because it's radio-playable
Bust the motion, it's smoother than lotion
Cause I rock rhymes that go deeper than an ocean
And baby, I love your Guess jeans
It seems so supreme on young African queens
Check the kicks of the bass I start to kick
And when I start to kick my brothers start to trip
Because they know the Rock Jay slows flow
So when it comes to grabbin a mic I'm a straight pro
That's how it is, G, that's how it goes
And I roll a rhyme like brand new Vogues

(Mr. Slow Flow)
I'm Mr. Slow Flow

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
You know it's on - like a pair of Nike sneakers
And kicked in with the big boom speakers
No need to act up cause I'm about to jack up
Those who oppose and make 'em run like panty hose
Smoothin as groovin with the smoothin you better bust
Cause I rush and crush you MC's to dust
So turn up the bass and kick up the treble'n
I'm not an angel, I'm a red hot devil in
Disguise and realizin just what's happenin
Nothin goin on but some super dope rappin
Kool Rock the roller, sip on Coca-Cola
The dead pres-folder and super mic holder
I'm hard as the concrete, suckers are obsolete
Those who try to rhyme against the Rock get beat
I'm usually stylin, wildin and profilin
Peace - I'm 5000</pre>
