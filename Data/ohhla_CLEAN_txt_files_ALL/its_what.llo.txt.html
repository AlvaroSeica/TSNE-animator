[Intro: Wonderous] 
Whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah 
For my loved ones, this one's for my loved ones 
(ay this one for y'all mayn), straight up let's go 

[Chorus] 
If you wanna hit the mall, we'll hit the mall 
If you wanna ball we can ball, don't pick one get em all 
Baby you my motherfucking dog 
What I spend for you, to me is small 
For you it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Ay on the cool, it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Cause you my boo, it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Cause you stay true it's whatever, whatever, whatever what you wanna do 

[Lil' O] 
Ay face of a queen, grace of a god 
If you ever left me, then he take from my heart 
Cause it would be broke, never break it apart 
Or play games with it, or just take it and dart 
When my phone wasn't ringing, and I wasn't bling-blinging 
You would hold me down, with the funds you were bringing 
To tell the truth girl, I don't know what you was thinking 
When you'd rub me on my back, and would gently start singing that 
Things would get better, now things done got better 
That lil' broke nigga, Fat Rat with the Cheddar 
I'm looking like a boss, in my throwed Louis sweater 
Every word that I say, get the whole pussy wetter 
So now like James Brown, it's the big payback 
Got you the baby Benz, but one day the Maybach 
And you ain't gotta work, lil' mama lay back 
All you gotta do is look, you ain't gotta say jack 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' O] 
Ay we started off fast, young niggaz on the block 
They say there go Lil' O, and Mack Biggers on the block 
Bro you made a nigga hard, you be like homie box 
Dope fiends would be like dang, you ain't got no bigger rocks 
Eventually street life, took it's toll on us 
Fast money came, and it took control on us 
We both caught a case, and the judges stole on us 
Me I made it out you still in there, getting swoll on us 
But one thing you know bro, I'm still out here repping 
A lot of niggaz hating, but a player still stepping 
Same ol' O, from the Southwest section 
Still ride around the H, one deep with a weapon 
And just like you told me, I keep money on my mind 
But I always reminisce, bout my partna doing time 
I made it out the grind, homie luckily 
So the minute you touch down, homie fuck with me 

[Chorus] 
If you wanna hit the mall, we'll hit the mall 
If you wanna ball we can ball, don't pick one get em all 
Homie you my motherfucking dog 
What I spend for you, to me is small 
For you it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Ay on the cool, it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Ay just for you, it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Cause you stay true it's whatever, whatever, whatever what you wanna do 

[Wonderous] 
And this is dedicated 
To the ones that showed me love, love 
So many people hated 
But you always gave me love, love 

[Lil' O] 
Hey I never switch it up, never turn my back 
Never act funny, like my name Bernie Mac 
If I'm walking in the rain, or I'm turning in a Lac 
If I ain't shit to smoke, or I'm burning on a sack 
And you love Ginuwine, no R&amp;B 
If I ever start to trip, I tell you now pardon me 
Just know in my team, y'all in my starting three 
In fact let me show you, everything all on me 

[Chorus] 
If you wanna hit the mall, we'll hit the mall 
If you wanna ball we can ball, don't pick one get em all 
Y'all, y'all you my motherfucking dog 
What I spend for you, to me is small 
For you it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Ay on the cool, it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Ay just for you, it's whatever, whatever, whatever 
Cause you stay true it's whatever, whatever, whatever what you wanna do
