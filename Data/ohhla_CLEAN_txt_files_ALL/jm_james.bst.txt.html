[MCA]	People how you doing there's a new day dawning
[M.D]	For the earth mother it's a brand new morning
[Adr]	For such a long while there's been such a longing
[All]	BUT NOW THE SUN IS SHINING LET'S ROLL BACK THE AWNING

[MCA]	This is a type of kinda like a formal dedication
[M.D]	Giving out a shout
[Adr]	for much inspiration
[M.D]	All I ever really want to do is GET NICE
	GET LOOSE and goof MY LITTLE SLICE OF LIFE
[MCA]	Sendin' out love to all corners of the land
[Adr]	I jump up on the stage and take the mic in my hand
[M.D]	I'm not playin' the roll
[Adr]	just being who I am
[MCA]	And if you try to dis me I couldn't give a damn

{Scratching}
*Cause I'm Rockin, Rockin', Rockin', Rock, Rock, Rockin'*
*Yeah* *Get Down*
*Rock, Rock, Rock on, Rock, Rock, Rock on, Rock, Rock, Rock on*
*Mic, Mic, Mic Control, Mic, Mic, Mic Control, 
 Mic, Mic, Mic, Mic Control*
*Can you get my drift?*

[MCA]	Bass from the back of my car feels soothing
[Adr]	Eight bazookas is what I'm using
[M.D]	I'm Mike D and it's been proven
[All]	I LOVE IT WHEN I SEE THE PARTY PEOPLE JUST MOVIN'
[MCA]	Strapped on the ear goggles and what did I see?
[All]	BUT THE MUSIC BROUGHT THE PEOPLE INTO HARMONY
