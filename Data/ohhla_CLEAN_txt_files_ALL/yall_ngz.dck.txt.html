[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Yall niggas aint live, Yall niggas don't ride
Yall niggas aint rich, Yall niggas turn snitch
Yall niggas aint paid, Yall niggas aint made
Yall niggas just frontin
Yall niggas aint ill, Yall niggas aint real
Yall niggas aint G's, Yall niggas don't squeeze
Yall niggas aint fresh, Yall niggas aint threats
Yall niggas aint nothin

[Inspectah Deck]
Everybody King of New York, Till up North callin
Boss niggas singin in court
Like rattin is the new shit, Snitchin for sport
Still certain death couldn't force a nigga to talk
I was taught, Bout to bring it to war
Cold like winter nights, Ears numb from the ring of the hawk
Hard time nigga bling and get caught, Big link in the cross
What you thinkin nigga thinkin he boss
Let em tell you how we gangsta man he playin it off
Verbal kid with the bad leg, Fakin of course
Where I come from made niggas wavin them fours
Broad day blazin off with no cases caught
Then your hommie on the side wanna taste of it all
Got the hammer on his waist bout to spry for the cause
Better take it easy, I aint playin wit yall
Prolly catch another case just to break in your jaw
Yall niggas

[Chorus]</pre>
