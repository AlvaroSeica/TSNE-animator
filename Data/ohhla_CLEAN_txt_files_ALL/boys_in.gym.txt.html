[Travie McCoy]
And so it goes uhh
We mouth your words when your tongues are too paralyzed
We finish up the peanut butter and jelly
that you get on your rider but never eat
We still pee in bottles
We played your graduation parties
We have fallen comrades
We just rebuild the team
Our friends are rich and we love it
cause it makes us look wealthy too
Sheeeit~! I still got a Sidekick 1
with a crack in the fuckin screen man
We were your favorite crew
"I'm the first person to know about these guys" head quotes band
We dance to "Use Me" by Bill Winters in a drunken stupor
until, Ma and Gary tell us to go the fuck home and kick us out
We make mistakes
We love, we hate
We're not angry anymore though
We still miss you
We still love you
Like a slug hates salt
and we're still your heroes</pre>
