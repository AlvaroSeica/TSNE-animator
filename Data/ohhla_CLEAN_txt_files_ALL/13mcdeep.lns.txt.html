[1st MC - Cool Whip Brittle Lo]
Holy smoking Joe no jokes I post
No hoax for ya folkes no cocaine cokes
Cool whipper whopper wailing wit willis
Dillis do crills crills do dillis
I'm ills like wills for the thrills of
The phills nils phylis
My rap style kills dead bodies stay stillis
Cause Ben was friend he's the maniest
Crackerjack cool whip spontaneous

[2nd MC - The Capital]
Brittilism organic organism skism
Kanism is is I will I was I
Insanic poetic go panic standing stanic
Illy silly I made you hump a hillbilly
Kick your mother to Kansas or a hunch
Back hoodlum or hoody goody gets
New tricks for mind trips my flattery
Battery bus nuttus got your girley
In the buttus uttus now your whole
Cakes sluttish

[3rd MC - L.S.]
Well I'm feeling an astro flow to the
Afro and rumpelin' til and skin and
Amazing loops wit the lyrical hoops
Peace to Betty Boops pass my GI-Gibaud's
Posing for the ha holy matrimony
I love ya Rosie Perez who said you
Had bulky legs
Call me daddy short dreds look at al
The revolving beds
Kangaroos cold sportin Pro-Keds

[4th MC - Jeranimo]
Rough rough incoming flowing to the track
Look at the people throwing down in the crowd
(Ahh) pick up the pace and wiggle
Look at the girls (poom poom) just jingle
Ooh jump off the stage and jet E scoped a
Bitch that was sippin on a Beck's
Went to the flix ooh was it rated X
Pass it on to my boys so they can catch rec.

[5th MC - Rampage]
Extra, extra read it look what it's all about
I'm the Last Boy Scout I turn it out
Any time that I can
My Master Plan
Is to do what's grand
I'm a rugged nigga, a big rugged nigga
Sit back and relax and take a swigga
Ramp is no joke
I'm on some shit called Cutthroat
Fuckin' with my boyz watch you get face broke
Ol' Chilly Willy I think it's my time
To play the rap Billy
Hey you Fellas, Pass the Phillie

[6th MC - Blitz]
Well Well Well, here I go again round 2
Making brothas act (didi dum)
Having fun jettin' rhythms written by
The one I got the ultimate snap
I set lyrics like a trap
(Rump a pum pum) make the whole world
Shake Quake to my new sounds tapes
Press play
Let me include the #1 fact.
Trom is official A.K. Blitz on the track.

[7th MC - Sha-Now]
Remedy man yes I'm known as the sha-now
Remedy man he's a Rumpelstiltskin
The moment is my ritual response is
Spontaneous now is now I grab the mic for a sec.
Giving sponge baths for those who
Can't keep a rep (didn't mean to turn you on)
Fingers move faster than riffing rafts
Invision the sha being bolder than your dad

[8th MC - Pudge God]
Huh! Unstoppable when my mind is amp
I'm gini in bakinis coming from Bel-Air
Wizzy watch me get busy

Illy choco spillies into phillies
Causing mathematics static toolies
In the attic
So brainwash the wish cause this
