We just addin-lib?  Soon to, uhh, yeah, HUH

Back on the family tree.. (*repeat 3X*)

So won't you brainstorm, and bring a friend along
And then climb my rhymes and compare 'em with the times but
Keep it stagnant, the fragment of what I'm sayin
All in rewind in your mind and see what you find
Cause I get loose sticks and stones, I'm breakin bones my fruits
are comin at ya, verbally attack ya
I ricocheted on stage like a twelve gauge
And yet a shame, you only came
to see what you could find, my piece of mind, before my time
I wrote this rhyme reminiscin on a friend of mine
Boo, now what you gonna do?
In ninety-two, or ninety-three, or ninety-four
I got a LITTLE more than Clinton or Gore could bring
to the table cause I'ma able when it comes to speakin about my
black folks, and maybe it'll provoke the
devil to drop a note, on all the things he done now
won't you brainstorm with me?
Huh, yeah, back on the family tree

{*repeat 8X: "My family tree, my family.." - Arrested Development*}

[Nefertiti - over sample]
Back on the family tree
Uhh, back on the family tree
..
Yeah, back on the family tree
So won't you brainstorm with me?
..
Yeah, back on the family tree
Back on the family tree

[Nefertiti]
My voice gets wet, a little more than you expect
Now relax your mind and let me roMANCE this
And catch up on my b-girl STANCES
Take it to the streets..
My troops swing swing swing to funks I bring
"Bring the Noise" of course, (?), and hit 'em hard
I write rhymes for the times don't be trippin on my troops
Get loose in your boots if you're down for your roots
Unbuckled and (?), so chase and the sudden holla
If he screams let him go, aiyyo it's time to move
I caught you in the web, so my groove so cool
(?) might lose if I take your, life right
But let's get back to how, rap ain't nothin but a poem
All day long, from solid to liquid form
So won't you brainstorm with me?  Back on the family tree

{*repeat 8X: "My family tree, my family.." - Arrested Development*}

[Nefertiti - over sample]
Huh, back on the family tree
Back on the family tree
Now won't you brainstorm with me?
Back on the family tree
Back on the family tree
Now won't you brainstorm with me?
Back on the family tree
..

[Nefertiti]
It's a reality ride, watch me slip and slide
off your backside then take a double dose of me
I'm speakin the truth you should be takin notes from me
Back on the family tree.. the family tree
I'm diggin deep in my roots, salutin my troops and
clickin my boots cause Dorothy I'm goin home
I'm free to roam in fifty states I can call my own
So won't you brainstorm with me?
Huh, back on the family tree - back on the family tree
