[Intro/Chorus]
Cheers to the frickin weekend
I'll drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh let the Jameson sink in

Don't let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round

Everybody put your glasses up and I'll drink to that
I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Rihanna]
Life's too short to be sittin 'round miserable
And people gon' talk whether you doing bad or good, yeah
Got a drink on my mind and my mind on my money, yeah

Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feeling hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody's vibing so don't nobody start a fight, yeah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]

[Rihanna]
'Bout to hop on the bar, put it all on my card tonight, yeah
Might be mad in the mornin but you know we goin hard tonight
It's getting Coyote Ugly up in here, no Tyra
It's only up from here, no downward spiral
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feeling hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody's vibin so don't nobody start a fight, yeah (yeah yeah)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
And I'll drink to that</pre>
