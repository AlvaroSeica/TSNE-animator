Coming out of 112 one late night
Seen some scandalous hoes in my eye sight
Now being the bitch I am, payed it no mind
Gave niggaz that then hoped in the ride
Pulled out the heat from under the seat
Make sure the doors locked and the guns cocked
Pulled out the lock
Now I'm leavin the spot
Made a right on Cheser Bridge
Now I'm rollin down the block
Floatin across 80 by north
I seen some headlights rollin tight behind the Porche
MotherFucker bumped my shit
Oh now it's on
Thinkin it's an accident
Though I could be wrong
{motherfucker} Payin myself if niggaz really want it
Hit another exit so a bitch wouldn't get cornered
Couldn't keep going, niggaz will follow you home
Smack you with the chrome and take everything you own
I was taught better than that
So I grabs the gat
Holds my own
Don't need no one to watch my back
Lookin towards the heavens through the sun roof
Shit, I know I ain't untouchable and I know I ain't bullet proof
But I'll put it on these niggaz if need be
Your dead, On some two to you chest and two to your head
Lord please don't let it go there
All I see is a BP and I'm in the middle of nowhere
I'm ready for whatever and I know the routine
Before I get out the whip I check the gun magazine
Hoped out like "What the fuck ya'll got to be crazy"
Some tall nigga talkin bout "Yo hold on baby, it was just an accident"
I can't believe this happening
Then I see the Cherokee pull up in the back of him
Now I'm really on p
Oh, that's them same bitches from the club that was grilling me
So I pulled out the fifth
You niggaz coming for me
Money had his hands up, I smacked him with the heat
Thats when one bitch hoped out the jeep, I fired a shot
I missed her
But it cornered the drivers side and hit her sister
I ducked behind my whip
Bitch still popping
Wait for her to stop so I can hit her with a hot one
It's getting hard to maneuverer
I kicked my heels off
Had him knocked out
Stumbled to his shit and them he peeled off
Perfect distraction
GS is passin
I rose platinum sounded like a round of applause
I pack a line when a cock it back and I rore's
Now I'm the type that will get at the drama to it's gone
You bitches wanna dance then they playin our song
I'm done fucking with you
Jumped behind the dumpster
Reload the pistol
Pucker up until it kiss ya
I can't explain why this is going on
But tonight ot's on
Fuck who right and fuck who wrong
I got you in my sight, gun in my palm
Surprisingly calm
Lick of a shot, hit her in the arm
She running got my gun hot
Try to escape she pulled her dead friend out of the driver's side
Licked off a shot
Put it in the leg
I ain't gonna kill you quick, bitch I'm gonna make you beg
She still got in though and mashed the gas
I put four in the door and got out of the way fast
The jeep swerved and started to stray
Heading for the gas tank guiding my stance
Hit it with the last one, contact,it blows up
I bolted out before the APB shows up
Throwed my shit and fifth
Bucked forty on the dash
In my rear view
I seen the aftermath of the blast
To protect mine I send demons to hell
Stay strong just to live long
Those who weak they and fell
Knowing happened shouldn't have went down but it did
If it's me and you, bitch I gots to live
I know with guns hell
Only one can prevail
Either it's a done deal
Live by steel or behind steel
Ain't nothing fair
We in this for real
Could have ended up dead tonight or ended up in jail
Pacing in my cell
Trying to raise bail
And on top of all that, this bitch made me break my motherfucking nail
Fucked my shit up
I told Tricky ass I ain't wanna go out tonight
Now I got to get this shit fixed</pre>
