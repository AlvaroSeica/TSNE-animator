Young mothers (that's right)
I feel ya (hey)
I know how it is

Mama's just a little girl
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still
See her crying by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, cuz even though they died
You can best believe they're watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're getting
Is a blessing in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you're all alone
You gots to do this on your own, so baby go
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you're fighting the world
Facing all this drama when Mama's just a little girl

[Chorus]
Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
'Cause Mama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
At sixteen, what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?!)
She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated, if this is fate
I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find? Little growing boy of mine
With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police, don't come home (why?)
Cuz Mama's acting crazy at the hospital
About to have another baby, like a rose from the concrete
Growing within, blessed with twins
How the hell can Mama raise three men?
So we began, closest family, such insanity
A happy home from one act of inhumanity
Plus Mama said they seed was corrupt, it used to rub
Her belly, begging to let us breathe if she loved us
Now, Mama, since quiet, sipping peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops
How could Mama bring a thug like me into the world?
She ain't the cause of all this drama
'Cause Mama's just a little girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, will she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
Now, look here, I see her clutching her son in her arms, she's hurt
Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecies, but who could stop the grief
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? Nothing but pain since my birth
Only functions at the pen, cuz everybody's in
Paying back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried
Worried and scared, knowing I'm going to see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
Knowing it ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about, coward, what you niggaz want? (hey)
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world
'Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl

[Chorus]

[Outro: 2Pac]
They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
They wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this drama
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse is to ignore from which we came
You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had 
damaged petals
On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses
This is the concrete
And these are my damaged petals
Don't ask me why
Thank God, nigga
Ask me how
You see, Mama's just a little girl (hey)

Mama (repeated 'till fade)</pre>
