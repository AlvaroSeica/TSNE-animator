[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, ay, ay
That's right, yeah

[T.I.]
Hoppin out a dropped Impala, pants hangin to my ankles
Feel 'em hate from every angle, they intimidated, and uh
I'm a beast, they don't like to see me walkin out of prison
I ain't trippin, I don't owe 'em nothin but an ass whippin
What you lookin at? Girl you better cut the television on
Don't wanna show yo' ass, best to get to gettin on
home, I'm waitin on ya if you want it
I ain't gotta go for bad, I just go for my opponent
I ain't lookin for no trouble, I ain't duckin none either
Say a nigga jumpin ship I say so fuck 'em, I don't need 'em
Still greet 'em, with the same smile like I used to
Get wild if you choose to, I ain't fin' to shoot you
End up head bust, bloody nose, loose tooth
Whoop a nigga ass by himself or with a group too
Who, fight back, hoe it's like that
Where my knife at? Shawty I'll be right back

[Chorus: T.I.]
Fresh out the box I'ma mash out, ya hear me?
This year a hundred mil' I'ma cash out, ya hear me?
Today a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?
The king pullin rank, big bank take little bank
Fresh up out the box I bet I mash out, ya hear me?
This year a hundred mil' I'ma cash out, ya hear me?
Today a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?
Rollin through your hood, can you hear me now? Goooood

[T.I.]
We gon' do it big like we did befo', fresh off a case
+ASAP+, +Motivation+ hoe, guess that's all it take
They got they ass with my poker face
Wait 'til they get a load of me like The Joker say (ha ha ha ha ha ha)
A lot of talkin that bullshit'll pass but it ain't today
Gon' be a cold day{?}, man down, like Frankie say
Ay, at the lair where the players meet
So all squares kick rocks with your bare feet, bitches cherish me
Came back, nigga raise up
Safe to say them suckers wanna see me caged up - that chapter's over
Pass the mic and set the stage up, throw your A's up
Tell my P.O. I don't blaze up, Pee Wee fire the haze up
They praise us cause old heads recognize the G in him
Black card, +No Limit+ like P and them
Ain't nobody seein him - who fuckin with shawty
When we pull up bitches yell out "O.M.G." just like my daughter and them

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
I'm in a jet black Camaro with my eyes on the sparrow
They say I can't have no pistol so I bought a bow and arrow
I'm just waitin, niggaz say it ain't the same and I get back
See ain't a damn thang change but my six pack
Heh, you want wreck you can get that
But all the disrespectin shawty I ain't with that
And partner I ain't fin' to chit-chat
Comin where a nigga had to break him off a piece like a Kit Kat
Tell them cats bless me to impress me
Best leave or get wet like a jetski
Overseas where you catch me
And when they holla King nigga they don't mean Elvis Presley
Hard body lumped up, chest like a dumb truck
Keep the sword on me shawty, this ain't what you want bruh
I ain't gotta bust ya, if you close enough you get stuck
Leave a nigga drippin like a sippy cup, pick 'em up

[Chorus]</pre>
