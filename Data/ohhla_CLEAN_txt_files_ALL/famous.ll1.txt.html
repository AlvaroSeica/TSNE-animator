Ha Haha Haha Haha
Ha Ha Ha (word a mouth)

Verse 1:

Step right up, step right up
And listen close
Fuck da beef
And just left the pot roast
Some shorties try to high boast
I ?block? em out
Puff blunts and drink private stocks of stout
I gots no doubt
To let the flow out
My windpipe
I make ya clap, clap ya hands
Like twin ?hype?
I keep my stems ripe
Puffin' on a peace pipe
Quick fast
Like Grease Light
I'm gonna recite
Rhymes re-ignite the mic
When the beat strikes
It get me hype
When ya punks try to beef bite
Tight, lyrics that I write is outta site
Like a satellite
You can't battle right
Grab ya mic tight
?Groove? like cellulite
I can tell you might
Be the type to bite
And all ?metabolite?
All you rappers that bite
Unite
And form like parasite
And swarm like locust at night
With the focus to bite
I take flight and rise the farenheight

Verse 2:

Arms locked in combat
Bombs locked on target
?Arm? blocked the march
While the flows are bombarded
Arch rivals stifled
By the likes of ??????
Slice ya face and neck
Place the set collect
Pay ya debt
Place ya bet
Stakes is hi-jinx chase my jet
If crazy heads don't make em pets
I'm with the dead
Got butt-naked snakes and bad fate
To take my ?bed?
I fucked mother nature
Made her ten nigga spread
And ain't break a sweat
Flowin' like Perry on the 28th and Mayhem
I make census worth a pennyweight
Evacuate
This track'll make you chickenheads ejaculate
You can't imaginate
My fire make ya flow evaporate
Set the date
Step to the square
I scared the record straight
Deficate in ya mouth and house you like Section 8
Near the rate
Of these litigates
Will leave a better taste in your flow
So middle aged men, will obliterate

Chorus:

I could burn ya, I could learn ya
Somthin' by ya, I could earn ya type
(Famous Last Words)

I could defeat you, beseetch you
To retreat, delete you
(Famous Last Words)

Son I blast you, I smash you
Point my Gat at you, Bless You
(Famous Last Words)

I'm the toughest, brag, and puffin drags
With they heads in a duffle bag
(Famous Last Words)

Verse 3:

Mc's scared to be square
My styles intimidatin'
They mimic me, timidly
Simulatin' my semetry
Claim they innovatin'
I seen like Satan
Breaking they flow with flames (DISENIGRATIN')
When they taking it all in vain
Main lie generatin'
Dialers and followers at the same time
They call my name
Hollerin' in the Hall of Fame
I shine like halogen
Got it locked with ball and chain
Ya'll all remain minute
I dilute, ya potency
No MC could hold the fate of my future

Verse 4:

1,2 Skip to My Loo
This lyric swerve through
I house you like a curfew
Curse you
I hit you off with they hex
I got more tech than Apex
That spray necks
YO Fuck safe sex
You get suplex
In my two storie duplex
Yo' rhymes is rejects
Pulled down like v-necks
Yo who next?
I take a ?four?
I stake me all in they heart
I'm way smart
I went to K-Mart
And stole a Go Kart
Without the flow chart
When the show start
I cause a ruckus
With rhymes on like Alan
&gt;From Nassau to Suffix
I stuff chicks
I tuck dicks
Caught in the mix
It depend
The dizzy flow will leave you seasick
Yo frequent
If I ruled the world
My first to free would be Rick
Hey yo my rhymes is mad phat
My mic's bulemic
Ya style's anemic
My scenic visions cycle like the one in prisms
My rhymes is larger than any tiny micro-organisms
Metaphors has risen over the top
I kick the ancient bee bop
Pump Like a Reebok
See through my eyes
Then a peacock
I leave you as a laughin' stock
I'm gattin flocks of mc's
Who  plastic glocks in they rhyme
But due time
I reach my true prime
Deaf like pantimime
As I chant a rhyme
You can't deny
My plan to plant ya mind
Inside my pocket
The lyric pilot keep ya in the cockpit
I rock shit
I fucking box it
I'm highly toxic...poison
I make more noise than a block orchestra
I'm stalkin' ya
Follow my road I'm forkin' ya
To the path
So YO!
Tell a friend
Tell a foe
Tell a hoe
Tell any fellow
I do it right like Danny Aeillo
I'm coming at you like a helo-copter
Chop ya
Couldn't hold the mic if I spot ya
