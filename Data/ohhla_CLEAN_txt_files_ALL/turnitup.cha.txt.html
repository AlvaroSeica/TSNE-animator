[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
I'ma show you how to get your shine on (shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song (my song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone (my phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home (take home)
I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk (club crunk)
Give 'em something thats goin' rattle that trunk (that trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk (get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up..

[Chamillionaire]
Give me that million dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it
(Who that is??) That's the illest rapper choppin' and screwin' it
Couldnt snatch the game that's what they told me, so I'm provin it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hittin never miss rep yo click and throw 'em high
Because Chamillionaire's the anwser to the game like Allen I
Middle fingaz to the sky, if they don't like that reply
Cause any DJ that deny is a mother fu errrwwwee lie
So give the ladies what that want
Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage
to feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up (Turn it Up)
Yeaah Sound of Revenge saying Universal to go get my plaque
Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back, like DJ's do when they hear my track
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigggga (He's Baaack)
You can't get mad if you feel that you and cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stat's ever so don't let that bbback hit ya

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
When it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thang
I told Johhny put 50 in my pankyrang
5 karot diamond chain vvs is in it mayne
You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hipnotic, Big Bodies with Blue paint
We got that oomp spray, but it still stank
You a lame so yo dame playin mind games
Ima pimp so I stay in that mindframe
Niggaz talk shit untill I let that nine bang
Me and Duke in that maybach switchin lanes

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Heaaded to the baar (I'm headed to the baar)
You know I'm V.I.P. (You know I'm vipee)
And since you rollin' with a star (You rollin with a staar)
You V.I.P. with mee (Chamillitary heey heey)

[Chamillionaire]
Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rapper thinkin' they doin it
(Who That Is??) That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shining They say our jewerly sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nuthin to do wit it (Do you kid?)
I ain't think so I'm tippin slow
Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo sho
Told me that she didnt care about my money Wasnt hearin it
Looks can be deceving as Chamillion paint apperances
You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did
