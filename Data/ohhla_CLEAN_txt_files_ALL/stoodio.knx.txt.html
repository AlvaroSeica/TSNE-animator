[Intro]
Word, to the beat..
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's why Bumpy Knuckles still rap, y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's why Bumpy Knuckles still rock, y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's why Bumpy Knuckles still rap, y'all (word)

[Bumpy Knuckles]
This mic I use, like my staff
and I wreck any rapper, in my path
It's been a long time comin, since I had
to shake so much hate, niggaz bein petty
Claimin they great (they great), no wait
Comin at Bump. that's your first mistake
I'm so raw, coke light, smoke mics, flow tight
Pac you was right, these niggaz is bustas
Mo' flights, try to get away from these hoe types
Oh right, a lot of niggaz, I don't trust 'em
I got a shit bag list, in my head
and I read it every time I, lay my head
Raw flow, emcee shit, it's my time
Cause, everybody got, to get they time
I still write mines (word up), notepads everywhere
Autograph every page, left bottom page
You can read it, but you probably never get it
In the booth, try to spit it, but you REALLY just can't get it
That growl, that bark, that bite
That pitbull rip a nigga face off tonight
Ha, RIGHT~! Touch the mic
Bump Knux, rock rock on, rock on (GRR!!!)
Preemo the boom bap, twisted in the goon rap
We make hot for heaters, to feed the next Derek Jeters (Woo!)
As a boy comin up, I watched Cold Crush
and really studied Kay Gee voice, shit was hardcore
I'm J.D.L. - HA, HA-HA-HA!
The girl taker A.D. baby, it's my car
But I paid close attention to GM Caz
I used to pay cash, to go see him spaz
From New York, New York, them hot Sinatras
Prez is on the mic, Krupt the Mobsters
Hah, and in the name of the God, I vow to never quit
RIP, Taheem Shabazz, who I'm forever with
Never forget, my grind, my hustle
Ups and downs, tussles, scuffles
Robbed niggaz, took duffles, tryin to get studio time...
