[Verse One: French Montana]
Light up the fire, you know we get higher
Rollin up loud real niggas movin quiet
Like it then I buy it, you donkeys on a diet
Bringin all my jewels I ain't know I start a riot 
Ridin with the blicker, messin up makeup 
You blowin up her phone, she ain't tryin to pick up
Drinkin out the bottle, leanin with a model
I throw a hundred racks up you think I hit the lotto
Ridin with the wolves I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty comin over, 'gon bend it over
Let me plank on it (On it) Put a drink on it (On it)
Heard you a freak, put my name on it (MONTANA!!!)
