[Makeba Mooncycle]
Back in the days when rappers were crazed
But now, it's a fab, with brothers shaking they ass
It was, about skills, on a quest to be ill
But, I'd rather build, teach the kids how to spill
Don't get me wrong, I wanna get paid off my songs
And live real nice, and live real long
I'mma, square off and mark my section
People all the tips that come in my direction
Mad at the fact that I love the truth
And I love to help, and I love the youth
Remember, the day, when I was all up in the Kingston
Reporting down on Nostrand, living off of tokens
With brothers in the street just hustling and hoping
Me, I kept it flowing, writing and growing
Hooking brothers up, so we can flex our skills
Trained battles, club scuffles, we lived for the thrills
Driving mess cabs, getting off them E pills
My brothers steady die and police giving me chills
Broke the piggy bank, to cop a nickle bag of looseys
Waiting for someone to come and scoop me
Acting like I ain't sweating, bleed no tears
But he was just reacting off of all of this fear
Ain't nothing change, after all these years
And I'm steady waiting for applause and some cheers

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
We have, full time rap stars, part time criminals
Trying to be slick, saying something subliminal
I'mma keep it straight, and will you see
Cuz there's nothing pussy in me

[Makeba Mooncycle]
The only difference between, is pussy and penis
Some be the sweatest, others say we're the meanest
I be, the cleanest, virtuous Madonna star
I light the sky and, follow your car
No matter who you are, you'll treasure my presence
Bring the party of life, was, truly a blessing
Brothers right now, be, fronting and fessing
Like they the truth but you'll never see me guessing
Part time criminals only hard for two lines
Acting like they know, but they really don't shine
Tried to stop climb by leaving me behind
But, as you hear, as you see
Makeba Mooncycle, forever I be
Again I represent this stressed out struggle
Give up to my peeps who hit the grind and hustle
I never take back what I gave to the masses
I will still be here when that other trash passes
Count on me, I won't, change my direction
Keep rising and striving for, ultimate perfection
I'll shout you out, brothers and sisters the same
While others look for someone else to blame
Put my, plaques in the frame, history I claimed
My success will be your shame
While other folks'll come and see, I already came

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Some say I'm Biggie, cuz I'm Ready to Die
Some say I'm like 2Pac, cuz I'm thuggin' for life
It's freedom or death, clear the tears out my eyes
But, I'm just Makeba, the queen of the nice
See, some say I'm mental, but I, perfect my symbol
There's love and, plain and simple, my body, is my temple
Nothing to lose, and everything to gain
I guess you lost yourself, it's that part of the fame
But I'mma keep it real and just do my thing
I'm so top shelf, I'll have just at my feet
So please don't even try to compete
See, me and BDP, and the art of the street
I teach not preach, cuz I'm sweet as a peach
I'm the, only one, cuz I hold my own
Have no one in me, cuz I stay in the zone
Are you, a serpent in cease, nonsense type of brother
Fronting like you hard but your soft like butter
You're ready for whatever, well whatever is here
No side mouth speeches, make it clear crystal
I'm so downlow, always up in the mix
I'm sharp as a blade, and I'm, ready to flip

[Outro: Makeba Mooncycle]
What? What? Don't ask nobody, I'm right here
They may say I'm ugly, but I'm here, I'm here
You don't remember that from the movie Color Purple?</pre>
