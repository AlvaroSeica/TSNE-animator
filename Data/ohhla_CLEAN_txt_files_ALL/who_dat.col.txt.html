[Intro - J. Cole - talking] - w/ ad libs
Who dat, who dat? (huh)
Who dat, who dat? (hey)
Who dat, who dat? (hey)

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waitin fo'
I mean, this shit was all bad just +A Week Ago+
Rappers was bullshittin, fuck it, I ain't hatin though
'Cause now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through Hell conditions
Wishin for air conditioning, feelin God was never listening
Now I'm on television and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speakin of positions, just witness how I elevate it
Real niggaz celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele, the only way to earn
So if you're sellin crack or if you're sellin rap
Make sure it's mean, so the fiends keep on trailin back

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfuckin name
I got 'em sayin - who dat, who dat? (Cole World)
Who dat, who dat? (I got 'em sayin)
Who dat, who dat? (Cole World)
Who dat, who dat? (hey)

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
The mind state of a winner
When you thinkin about summertime, I'm thinkin about the winter
When you thinkin about breakfast, I'm heatin up my dinner
I was plottin this moment back when y'all was ridin spinners
Now I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yep
Hungry like a nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me "ain't you Roc, well where the fuck your chain at?"
Guess it's somethin like your girl nigga, it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came, me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain, they took the boat, I took the plane
Dang, that boy sick, now hoes on his joystick
Heatin up like Mayweather dog, I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to ya day job, said you was hot, well they lied
Is that ya gal? Well I just G'd her/Jeter, no A-Rod

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfuckin name
I got 'em sayin - who dat, who dat? (huh)
Who dat, who dat? (I got 'em sayin)
Who dat, who dat? (Cole World)

[Sample of Andre 3000 from OutKast's "SpottieOttieDopalicious"]
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Cole?"

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claimin they sick, I heal niggaz for good
A couple y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
Hey me? I'm "Fresh Prince", I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't sayin names but we not the same
All that money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might wanna grab you a chain, wanna tip up your hat
Might wanna purchase some game homie, your shit is so whack
I got my finger on the trigger tell that nigga hold that
Boy I'm picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do, I could do better
And any chick you can screw, I could get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar 'fore I'm done
They say that I'm "The One" (huh)
Yeah nigga I'm "The One" (ha)
I got 'em sayin

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfuckin name
I got 'em sayin - who dat, who dat? (Cole World)
Who dat, who dat? (I got 'em sayin)
Who dat, who dat? (J. Cole)
Who dat, who dat? (Cole World nigga)

[Outro - J. Cole - talking]
