[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
It's time, here we go
It's time, here we go
Yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
Ay yo, my (?) blaze equality and think like Marc' Garvey
Be Godly, and organize an army that live out the legacy
I hardly waste artillery when I bustin' up lyrically
The Hennessy got a brother ready to kill my enemies
This industry is waitin' for me, sittin' perfectly
Filled to the capacity with garbage MC's
I'm like a cold breeze in a mist of a hundred degrees
I will cure the world disease, keepin' honeys on their knees
Bustin' lyrics for the G's, leavin' rappers screamin' "Please!"
Makin' sisters wearin' weaves change to afros and caribes
I rhyme healthy and naturally, passionately
No albums'll come out after me, they all be scared of tragedy
If you had a choice between dirty and clean,
Water, which would you choose, Burk is pure, nahmean?
Styles are so numerous, to testin' this is ludicrous
It's just a testament to show how long I been doing this
My sword is sharp and every dart is from the heart, regardless
Devour these rappers on the mic claimin' that they the hardest
Just because you bust a rhyme doesn't make you an artist
I'm ready to die like Notorious, life ain't glorious
The weight upon my shoulders is ridiculous, enormous
In this damn game of life I try to give my best performance
I wanna win it as a team, but I ain't even scoreless
Lyrically beautiful verses, stylish, (?) and gorgeous

[Chorus: The Reverend William Burk]
We need knowledge cause wit' it we can take the world hostage
And wisdom, with wisdom we can overthrow the system
Understandin', to know the things we can and can't change
'Cause life's a strange game, and no, nothing stays the same
Need knowledge cause wit' it we can take the world hostage
And wisdom, with wisdom we can overthrow the system
Understandin', to know the things we can and can't change
'Cause life's a strange game, and no, nuthin' stays the same

[The Reverend William Burk]
I kinda figured what was learned in the cradle lasts to the grave
My ancestors were slaves, nowadays still waitin' on the payment
I kick a verse for my liberation, avoid incarceration
Predicted cause of my death'll be assassination
My vicious army's based upon the principles of Garvey
Returnin' to Africa, safaris, livin' Godly, 'cause North America hardly nurtures
They only make us murder for the dollar, blue collar, livin' the squall of poverty
No opportunity, no unity, they distribute drugs and guns in our community
Police beat brothers brutally, now they got the AIDS virus to stop us from reproducin'
Causin' confusion, I think it's more than coincidence
That it's movin' through Africa rapidly, creatin' tragedy,
In this war (?) live we've had two hundred million casualties
What is it what causes them to stoop to levels
Way beyond the darkness of a demon or a devil
The insurrection, runnin' plantations, modern day enslavement, miseducation
We want our payment, this ain't entertainment
This is true to life oral tradition
Went from livin' in Africa to America, in the projects or prison
When the beat breaks it makes legs shake and treble causin' earthquakes
To crack mineral, lyrical is critical, the game is gettin' rather ridiculous
All my sentences are stayin' on point, other lyricists are impotent
I'm rhymin vigorously, seriously, intimately on a track
Beautifully with the rap, usually comin' phat
Puttin' suckers on their backs, causin' heart attacks
Combat unnaturally, (?) through your fantasy
Casually I walk on stage with my faculty
(And/in back up/of me?) we radically reload the clips and shootin' automatically
And brothers know not to come and test, or else tragedy

[Chorus]
