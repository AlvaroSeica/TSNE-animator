     "Action!!"
We taping?
Are we roling?
Yes sir
God damn
Who's the hip hop...
Who's the hip hop
That's action
Give it to me

I'm the hip hop drug, you want a hit give me a minute
I'm leaving your brain tinted, with scores of metaphor
Lyrical glim-fitted, bringing you sweet misery
Like sugarcane mixed with history
Kissing the sun could never blister me
Jesus, I said Jesus, will you relieve us?
A critic commentators who never believe us
Achieve trust, never gamble on expectation
Unless you in the future, got some kind of blood relation, ya dig
Potent rhyme moonshine, yo take a swig
Got a vegetarian dreaming of microwaving pig
Secular soul, the regular man's in a hurry
While I'm chilling in the studio eating iguan and curry
You're a pussy ass motherfucker (hell ya!)
I said you're puss ass motherfucker (hell ya!)
I get your flask, flipping my words backwards
Attach judge, either leaving the jury with the lackluster, impression
When I'm on trial for obsession
With the death of them MC's progression, learn your lesson
And search for the antibotic, I hook on cigarettes and coffee
Like you should get hooked on phonics
Before the thought of approach crosses your mind
I find your method of wackness, sending constant reminder
Your style's bullshit, your style's bullshit!
Want a key to be an MC, here's the full kit

CHORUS [Saukrates]
Now that's action (action! what) X4

[Saukrates]
Now that's act... this gonna take a minute, relax son
Play the government up in your ass to tax one
Unlawful MC, reach unlawful degree
Saukrates tear up, enemy by enemy gees
Something like a phenomenom, ghetto serial trauma don
Pain of acid rain, target the skin
I drop the bomb, fuck it
I'mma keep my jones irregular
So don't act surprised of Saukrates is checking ya
And even with your dogs protecting ya
Disgrace printed on your face
You had 'em saying 'dogs forgetting ya'
(Blah, blah, blah)
Representation's bizarre, my mind to my mouth
Shiny G watch(?) to a guitar
Never ghetto superstar, rather ghetto entrepeneurly czar
I'm twelve under, you're checking in at twelve over par
Toke a cigar and start travelling
I know it's potent son, I see your dreads unravelling
I have battled men who sculptured knowledge and culture
But poisonous dialects exposing cadavers to vultures
Excue me for being blunt while you get blunted
But in the words of Biggie 'hunt me or be hunted'

CHORUS
Can't fuck with this</pre>
