now I'm back in t-touchdown
to rule my world from the country
rock cds and touch your town
south parkway and backstreet
I'm still down, ain't no stop me now
since been leavin 3-6-0 degrees
fly gon do background
fuck the grime, mufuk the time
back on hard with a piece of mind
track for track and line for line
fly get right back on the grind
I serves up cuz I'm the reg-u-lar
imma deal what they beggin for
everyone must ansa up to Mr Minnie Mae Mafia
yall know this here fly gone burn
been burned before but y'all still ain't learn
yall niggas ain't talkin bout shit
as far as MR I here is concerned
snap this, pop that
fly say all that shit is whack
I don't mean no disrespect
but mane I'm glad that fly back
because he speaks the truth, he states the fact
and he bumps so hard on the tightest track
without a doubt, deep from the south
deep down dirty like artifacts
like big baby he anthrax
so dont fuck around and get hijacked
time has come around for y'all to back down
and welcome playa flizzy!

[chorus]
I don't need all that bulshit its behind me
playa fly say no mo
been gone so long but now I'm back
right back goin hard on this ho

whats up H2 Mista Tito?
(Mista Tito) I missed ya
ye bra I kno
(Mista Tito) here problems you can get to em
(Mista Tito) all like pac when he first hit deathrow
say no more you done fired up fly
once the fire from fly has lit em
hit 'em wit the minnie mae mafia rhthym
and a vocal uzi and watchin the music kill em
Jerry Calatil come find me and
snap right back like a rubberband
and not makin a bet, im a man and a half
I'm in command, not what I'm sayin?
so many ones tried to hold me back
still I touched my god, like I was mishak
walk through fire like I was anrak
and now bizak, time for payback
snap to sack, no exceptions made
outta control and can not behave
how d hell you expect me to act
when I alll the time I was trapped in a cage
turn the page, release the rage
back in the studio and on the stage
with more hosing spray in my cup
purple cracked ribs and a twist of glaze
I'm feeling great me lives to say
wanna thank my god for one more day
the boy be gone, for so damn long
and now I'm back to set the record straight

[chorus]

how many rounds wha bout d'time
is it gonna take playa fly to shine
I be here puttin in overtime
I'm down for mine , fly love to grind
got the game and watch a nigga like pac
neither us got striaght to the top
what the rap industry gon do
when the Mafia All Day album drop
I ain't gone stop bun been on flys depression
this the resurrection
fly been lost and caused a big recession
now minnie mae take exception
right straight to the point fly dont get
now all y'all suckers cant handle this
you suckers got to pay for my pain and sufferin
minnie mae mafia about to biz
my buziness shit on all y'all door
I know y'all pay for the fo
fuk that, let me blows a 2, I'll work wit you
now I still stand tall
everythings I stand for is now on the line
its my time fly still in my prime
slow me but couldnt not stop me
just because they put me in the vine
continue to shine, in d middle of the night
like star light star light is so bright
minnie mae mob gonna pray to god
right before we get hight tonight
build to may wit minnie may raised
and all this life that I've been doin
then you know this ain't no joke
and somebody gon get burnt for sure!!
