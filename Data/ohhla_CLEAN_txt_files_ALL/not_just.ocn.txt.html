Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[some random television show]
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
and disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot dog, hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars
