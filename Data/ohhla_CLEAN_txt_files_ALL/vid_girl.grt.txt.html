Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You a video girl
(you must be kidding me girl)
you a video girl
(you must be kidding me girl)
video girl create your own world
the only one in existence is you
no one's resistant to you
you and only you and you
seem like a dream on the screen
tantalize and titillate,
video girl of the world

she was slightly dressed
out 2 impress, ready 2 party
gettin casted 4 the club scenes dyin 2 shake her body
to get on the set
she compromised 4 the dollas
dancin freaky with the rappers obsessed with poppin collers
bought some hair and nails
found some dudes that rap
while shes rockin the tiny shorts and the shirt from Baby Gap
misinformed adolescent
she was teenage old
never told of her inner goal
when she was wrongfully clothed
just a jewel that got appraised by unqualified guys
they lied, shotload, dont kno her worth in God's eyes
fellas after the flesh, they aint goin' see wat I'm gettin
cuz they measure every girl by these video women

I'm sick of all they constant bouncin then they say
we disrespectful cuz we crave em with our instant
pouncin the money drive em to mishaps and under
they thongs lie decay and collapse no morals perhaps
the scenery's pretty the suns shining it's nice out
a pretty girl freakin on a pimp who'd knock her lights out

gangsta with gold fronts and the girl he's advancin on
would rather run him over with the truck she's dancing on
and he'd be hurt up pretty badly i must say word up
it aint over bone is third up
don't debate it i know they hate being affiliated
to this world they created with facades that leave you devastated

the glamorous life price for your souls rest
simple mentality in a world complex
star studded reality 5 minutes or less
broken dreams and ambitions lost with respect
she was an innocent queen with rubber bands and berets
young diva runnin things commanding every step
then the pace picked up and she learned to be fast
short skirt tight clothes good spirit turned bad
hollywood caught a glimpse of your beauty untamed
at the cost you played whatever price you paid
through away your identity even changed your name
in your world of fame child you need to be shamed
in the world of fame</pre>
