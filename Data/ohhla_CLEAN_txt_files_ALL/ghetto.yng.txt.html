[Hook]
war, we at war (yea)
We at war (yea)
We at war (yea)
We at war (yea)
gimme my rifle (unhunh)
gimme my rifle (unhunh)
gimme my rifle (unhunh)
gimme my rifle (unhunh)

[Kaine]
Let's get this motherfucker back crunk
It's gone be me and my niggaz with hella triggers and a gat punk
to take back what we once had
don't give a damn about them enemies
send they ass to Baghdad
they put a nigga on the front line
But when it come to gettin' ahead
they put you way behind
And they think we supposed to take the minimum wage
they givin' us choices and makin' us think we free
when we still slaves
Every nigga got some thug in 'em
Every nigga got some love in 'em
Every nigga got a grudge in 'em
Every nigga got a mug in 'em
And every nigga bust a slug in 'em
And like the catfish we'll skin 'em (hanh)
Y'all niggaz ain't holdin my denim (hanh)
check yourself (hanh)
I'ma drop yo ass off (yup) bitch (yup .....)
soon as I loosen my motherfuckin' belt! YEA! HANH!

[Chorus]
(war we at war - *4X*)
1 for the money
2 for the thugs
3 for the projects
4 for the love
(gimme my rifle - *4X*)
like micheal jackson they dont care about us and movin
too fast always get you caught up like UGH
Them ghetto classics (ghetto)
ghetto classics (ghetto)
Them ghetto classics (ghetto)
Them ghetto classics
I spent some time tryin to find just another piece of mind
talkin bout....them ghetto classics (ghetto)
Them ghetto classics

[D-Roc]
We as black people done lost our mind (hanh)
It's really time to draw the line
open up our eyes b4 we get left behind (hanh)
let me tell you something bout hard times
when we used to walk or we didnt have license to drive

And 9/11 wasn't on our side
We didn't know how to read
We didn't know how to write
all we did was sing all day and all night (yea)
then when they let us start learning y'all lose ya minds
think y'all forgot about the earlier times
when martin luther king had a dream that one day we'd walk together
We really need to get it together
kids stay in school
learn all you can
graduate
go to college
get knowledge
then we shall overcome
yes we can with the word and the faith I feel we can demand it
for real!

[Chorus]

[Kaine]
Hut 2 3 4 what the hell are we fightin' for?
gas and oil
relationships wasn't what you spoil
thats why they got saddam
hard time
hoot (hoot)
aim (aim)
shoot (shoot)
aint nuthin' but the young kids they recruit
(yup.....)
Is the ones that dont make it home in they suit

[D-Roc]
I drift away sometimes
thinkin' how it could should would be
If everybody in the world was free
no crime nobody doin wrong
everybody gettin' along
But when I step back to reality this world is tough
And thats why we at war
killin' ourself over bullshit that we value more than
life y'all people better get right
'cause

[Chorus]
