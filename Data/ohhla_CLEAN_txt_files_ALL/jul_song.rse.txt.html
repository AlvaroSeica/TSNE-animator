[Intro]
Yeah, she's like a year and a half now

[Chorus]
As long as I live and I'm holdin' my baby
What else more can I use?
As long as I love and I culture this lady
What else more should I do?
As long as I love and I'm holdin' my baby
What else more can I use?
As long as I live and I culture this lady
What else more should I do?

[Verse One]
And now my boo boo's talkin'
And runnin'/walkin' awkward
Stompin' like her feet are heavy
My little Julies talkin'
And she like pressin' buttons
Open and closin' doors
Sometimes she laugh for nothin'
And make me want to join
And likes her bouncy ball
She never gets enough
She throws her food on the floor like, "Nigga, pick it up."
And claps when Dora claps
And cats with singin' puppies
And if she sees you sneezin' 
For some reason chuckles
And mumbles Chinese, "Mea kouw lan" 
And when she's quiet
It kinda makes me see how I am
Her whole foot
Isn't half the size of my hand
Her little looks
Really make my life worth a damn
It's hip hop
It's nothing of course for me and my Jules
My life's grace
Like Jesus ridin' in on a mule
I got you
And what's let to worry about?
Your food, clothes, health and house
What comes out your mouth
Yo

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
She says "bye bye" ten minutes after you leave
Long hair
The other babies say she got weave
She grows fast
For mad long she didn't have teeth
And I remember in the sonogram she didn't have feet
And now she'd rather use my cell phone than Sesame Street
One day she'll have her own home and live with some creep
I prep for it though
I shop for shotguns
Daddy's little girl
I only got one
And I ain't got sons
Outside the rap game
Says "Go" 
If you say "Ready, Set" and then she acts strange
And then it gets excitin'
She's like the Runnin' Rebel
It sounds like wrestlers fightin' 
If you on lower levels
In public 
As sure as she sit
Ask her to count
She'll say she doesn't do tricks
A year and a half
Act like she was here in the past
For Jules my breath, I'll give you my last

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yo, my little bah bah
I call her a sheep amongst wolves
My own papa
Really tried to teach me the rules
I learned some
And those, what I'm teachin' to you
I live life
So you're gonna have to do what you do
Don't be alarmed
I'll always be your beam of support
You need an arm
There's no force, they're cuttin' mine off
Watchin' her walk
She balancin' 
She tryin' not to fall
She's havin' problems with steps
But aren't we all?
To see the world from her eyes
Where the tables are tall
And to have to learn not to eat the paper no more
Please remember being one
Do your pappy a favor
Reminiscin' on these moments that'll escape from you later
She gets quiet
Then as loud as can be
She acts almost
As childish as me
And I gotta teach her boundaries
And where to go pee
And she'll be a strong founder of whatever you see
