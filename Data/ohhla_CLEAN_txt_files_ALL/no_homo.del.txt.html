No homo, son, ayo, fuck all that gay shit
Capital stays among men gets paid, kid
No homo, son, I get more ass than bus seats
Get anal from the back the meat just crush cheeks
Capital got love for thugs, I lay down
For my dudes when shit's deep, my gun sound
Shots, vest on get sprayed from any blood
All over my chest, nothing puncture my lungs but cess 
No homo, smoke weed I take sacks to the face
the fattest longest spliffs stay between my lips laced
It burns and the sticky purple tips enter me
got me choking til I gag til I'm gone mentally
With brew I'm the truest, I stay guzzling, kids
This gangbanger swallow it all none on the chin
No homo, in the club, I get shots from my boys
I never pay I do me wylin, making mad noise
No homo, yo, I stay slangin' in the streets
Dudes love my crack, take my smoke into their cheeks
And lungs, no homo, they fiendin for me at night
The addicts get asthmatic as they grab for that glass pipe
Dream of T's creamy white rocks, my cash right
Lock horns with any dude who think he moving that white
This my block.  Don't make me pull my tool out and bang
I'm a G, string you up the butt of my gun rain
Blows, I pound fools, no homo. Fuck outta here
Make these assholes bleed, just for coming round here
Capital loves cocked, guns, I run the block son
I give mad heads the fear, you see my glock? Run</pre>
