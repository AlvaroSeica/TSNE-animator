[Barbie Hatch]
I had a boyfriend under the grou-ound
He said giiiiirl, wontcha come on down
To my way of thinking
California is sinking
It won't be long now

[Chorus X2: Barbie Hatch]
Don't ask me where I've been, waaay down
Don't ask me where I've been, waaay down

[Barbie Hatch]
My love, my love, is gathering dow-own
(My love, my love, is gathering down)
Throught the woods, it's my cold heart he was calling
His eyes were like falling
I burst like the stars (burst like the stars)

[Chorus X2]

[Barbie Hatch]
I had a boyfriend under the grou-ound
He said giiirl (he said giiirl) you're mine now
And there's no turning
Away from this burning (away from this burning)
It's all over now (it's all over now)

[RZA]
Yo, yo, yo, yo BOODOODOODOO
Ayo, underground king, only heard an not seen
Therefore, I exist in the deepness of your dreams
No exaggeration, you trapped in my infatuation
I'm like a wire tap that's strapped to your imagination
Years of love, tears of blood
You was up in club like beers and drugs
Now I'm trapped in limbo with your golden fist symbol
To see the soul, use my eyes for a window
Only if I could escape from this loneliness
The assault of your love is felonious
It was the kiss that broke my narcissist
Still I roam this Earth like the Prince of Darkness

[Chorus X2]</pre>
