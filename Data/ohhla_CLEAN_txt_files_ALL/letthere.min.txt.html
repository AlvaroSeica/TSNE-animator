Song:   Let There Be Light
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Got it good, got it good, did it done it, got it good
Got it good, got it good, did it done it, got it good

We livin' in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put His glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light
Let there be light, let there be light

I was in the dark, like the basement
My heart used to love sin, then He changed it
Lo-look what grace did, couldn't live without her
Got no strength on my own, yeah I'm livin' solar powered
Gettin' bright lit, this ain't no light switch
I can't turn it on and off, Lord come ignite this
I wanna be that flame in the dark where no light is
While I'm in this frame, I show them who the Christ is
When they see my deed's deed, I'm just being me
I hope that they seeing You, every time they seeing me
Treatin' others the same way that I would want them treatin' me
Yeah we say it all the time, but that ain't done so easily
So Jesus give me Your heart, mine is deceitful
Then give me Your eyes, I wanna see people
Same way that You see 'em, 'cause You all that they need
It's like I'm Peter, though I'm fallin'
You still callin' me to feed 'em

We living in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put his glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light
Let there be light, let there be light

We living in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put his glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light
Let there be light, let there be light

I took a trip back to the 'Cuse, I saw my old gran' gran'
Ran into my boy Ox, man it had me broken 'cause
He was been doing things that I know I had taught him
Back when I was in sin, now I know the world's watchin'
You're given hands, feet, tongue, eyes and the like
To show the world what we really prize is the Christ
So take that Romans 12:1 apply it to your life
Let your light shine, your body's a living sacrifice

This is worship, with you on them verses
The light in you could be darkness
So are you certain, I pray Father search in
Show me what competes for your throne
On the seat of my heart, so I leave that joint alone
All I know that is I'm prone, to wander and to roam
So put fire in these bones, by Your Spirit make me strong
If we like that we on, it's time to make Him known
We illuminate the dark 'till the day He comes home

We living in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put his glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light
Let there be light, let there be light

We living in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put his glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light,
Let there be light, let there be light

I was made to light it up, city on a hilltop
And I know the only way so hit me when you feel lost
Yeah, so put your shades on, you know lower your frames
'Cause when His glory shine, you gon' lower your frame
Higher than smokin' Mary Jane on an aeroplane
His name's great, that's why Crae is livin' for Jesus mayne
Much love to the folks in the church
Lighting up the world while they're puttin' in work
Even when it hurt, man we can't stop now
Something caved in when the cave caved out
But we can't lose what we never did earn
Walk with the Son so my lights gon' burn
Never giving up and I'm never gon' turn
Glowing in the dark 'till the Lord return
Yeah, Genesis 1:3 on mind homie
So let there be light, I'm tryna shine homie

We living in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put his glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light
Let there be light, let there be light

We living in a dark world, how they gonna know
If we don't put his glory on display and let it show
So let there be light, let there be light
Let there be light, let there be light</pre>
