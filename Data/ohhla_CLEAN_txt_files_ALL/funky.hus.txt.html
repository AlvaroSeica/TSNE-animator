[Hus talking]
Turn the music up, just the way I like it you know
Hus, straight mobbin' tho
H-U-S-A-L-A-H, H-U-S, H-U-S

[Verse 1]
This is the funky fresh Husalah song
Sorry that I made y'all wait so long
But I had to post up get my grindin' strong
Turn twenty TV's in my scraper on
Just to let suckas know I get my paper long
If you ain't from the Bay then just leave it alone
When you see us doin' the dance we do back home
We the Bay, Area, extra hyphy
And I am the king boy Husalassie
And all I wanna do is just rock your girl body
Cause everybody knows this is a gangsta party
I rep for the Mob we so hyphy

[HOOK]
Yeh, you know, we really wanna rock tonight
Yeh, I know, you know I got my choppah tonight
So it's nothin'

[Verse 2]
What you at my nig, let 'em know off top
I'm from the Bay I'm in the Mob and nigga we don't stop
Gettin' so stupid and dumb wid fullys and chops
I'm a dope game hustler swangin' eights on ya block
Yokin' the scraper five deep like what
Nigga what we live it real niggas don't want us
(Ya know, you feel me tho my nig, you feel me)
(know what I mean my nigga)

[HOOK]
Yeh, I know, we really wanna rock tonight
Yeh, I know, you know I got my choppah tonight
So it's nothin'
