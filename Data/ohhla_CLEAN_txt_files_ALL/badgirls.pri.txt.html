Did you think you could mess with us
Wanna roll, motherfucker, with the best of us
Watch out now, dangerous
On the back of the bus, smack you while I'm puttin' on my blush
You in a rush, never saw a bad bitch
Drive a truck, handling the clutch like what
Got a crush, know I got a nice butt
Know I got a nice haircut but thank you ver ymuch
Bad girls around the world, we just gonna rock their world
Can I hear you, all my girls, got a g-string and you can sing, say ow
Think you all ready now, loud
Plenty rockin' steady, many Betty in the crowd
Like Henny all around, bad girls gotta drop your teddies to the ground
I'm a gon' break it down

We just some bad girls, drive us in some Mag girls
We got some bags, girls, bad girls NYC
We just some bad girls, check us out in mags girls
Roll us out some jags, girls, bad girls NYC

You like it dirty dirty, we like it dirty dirty
Bad girls in Jersey Jersey, keep them men all thirsty thirsty
Now watch, the birdy gonna run this shit
Gonna get them platinum hits
Girls with the real tits, girls with them fake shits
Get rich and scream if you a bad, bad bitch
Miami chicks, shake your ass from your mommy, show the Cali chicks
2006, gonna help me win a Grammy
Keep pullin' down your panties, gettin' pussy licked
Showgirls in Vegas, show your body like dancers for the Lakers
Boys gonna lay us, we players
Girl DJs cross the faders, cause you know I'm gonna blaze us

We just some bad girls, drive us in some Mag girls
We got some bags, girls, bad girls NYC
We just some bad girls, check us out in mags girls
Roll us out some jags, girls, bad girls NYC

Bad girls around the world, we just gonna rock their world
Can I hear you, all my girls, got a g-string and you can sing, say ow
Sharp as a razor, let's wager
Smash your pager like, woo, Al Qaeda
Word detonator, kick you like a cheerleader for the Raiders, pow, pow
Walk in your trainers, UK, ok
Girls in the trailer, good girl failures
Girls on the Jaeger, rock your diamonds bitches, Elizabeth Taylor
But anyway have you seen our cars and anyway have you seen our mas
Anyway have you seen our thongs and some bad girls all along
And anyway have you seen our mans and anyway have you seen my plans
And anyway have you seen our bands and real bad girls understand

We just some bad girls, drive us in some Mag girls
We got some bags, girls, to all the girls from around the way
We just some bad girls, check us out in mags girls
Roll us out some jags, girls

We just some bad girls, drive us in some Mag girls
We got some bags, girls
We just some bad girls, check us out in mags girls
Roll us out some jags, girls, bad girls NYC

We just some bad girls, drive us in some Mag girls
We got some bags, girls, bad girls NYC
We just some bad girls, check us out in mags girls
Roll us out some jags, girls, bad girls NYC</pre>
