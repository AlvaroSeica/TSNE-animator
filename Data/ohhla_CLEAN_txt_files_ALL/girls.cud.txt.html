Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I'm single in the streets 'bout to get it in
Talkin' bout some drinkin' and some mingling (woh)
Can't believe what I'm seeing, man, all these girls, look, look
Hmm get in the car ya'll, I just wanna make her feel hot
Let me smell your sin girl damn you look so
No groupies, see a blonde girl with a brunette
See a nigga cruzin' in the red benz
I just want to double up, tripple up
So many surprises oh so many colors and sizes
Love them, I want them, they need me
I'm rollin' coastin'

[Chorus]
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go [x3]
(So many colors and sizes, so many surprises)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Guess what? A nigga turnt up
All the windows closed for the roast up
Club club letting out for the post up
All I need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
Down for doing acid
Sit up on that waist let that ass fit
Let me feel your skin on mine unwind whats on your mind
And tell me somethin that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up
So many surprises, so many colors and sizes
Love them (mmh) they're so dope, they're so dope
We're rolling, coasting

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Too Short]
When you live like me, you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
So I opened up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half black half Thai
Don't be prejudice, cause she's mixed.
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is, if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever and a big thick you know what I wanna feed here
Met a girl named maria, its your turn, I loved them senoritas
I'd like to fuck them, but then I said fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little somthin
OG Too Short dont stop
All the pretty girls come on top

[Chorus]
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go [x3]
(let me see that body)
(like everywhere, my favorite kind, bitch)

[Outro]
They love me. Yahm</pre>
