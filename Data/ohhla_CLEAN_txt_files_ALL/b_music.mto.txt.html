(Quasimoto)
"Hey yo Madlib("Who ME?") ya why don't you hit em up with that high speaking"

(Madlib)
I gets high and start taking out wack selections
First by electin' EricB for president
Zulu Nation for protection
Tribe Called Quest, KRS One secret Hip Hop Intelligence
Diamon D and the whole DITC
Ultramagnetic MC's
Gang Starr doing a show for free and you can smoke sensi
Lord Finesse teaching rhyme telepathy
Biz Markie did a couple for the Pistol 3
Back when style was the name belt buckles and Lee's
Boomers, Sticky green trees

("Grip the stereo in an instant")
("And then I twist up a bud light an incence")X5
("Bump the Boom Music nine times out of ten i use it to start this way")

(Madlib)
Hey yo Quas hit em with that green talk
(Quasimoto)
Oh I gets high and starts taking out wack niggas
Then fly up into the sky and use my lyrics as a trigger
Always Pull It , let the bullet slide through to the left
Went so far undergroud with out diggin ended up in west
China
Yo Style sounds like youve been eating some bad vagina
The Unseen you Unclean Niggas mad cause youcan't find us
