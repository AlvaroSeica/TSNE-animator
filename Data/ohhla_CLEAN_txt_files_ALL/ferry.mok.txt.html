[Verse One]
It's just the type of cool shit cruise ship at the dock
All aboard to escape and unslip the knot
And you with me? cause I'm the Navigator of this vessel
Move quickly and line up for the Expresso
It's this special, and it's got to be my way
Cause if I dont get the feeling its useless on a Friday
I wrote the fairy tales
I made the hits for the kids marine travel in between Van and Vic
Cafateria picks, you get your food and carry your shit
Find a seat in the area, sit (uhh)
Right across from the gram who cramps and if you muster up the nerve
She might give you a chance
Freelance, is my stance to feel
Details are everything to the fans it's real
Afternoon Buffet, you got your walkman rockin
Sip on Nescafe and its got ya poppin
Of the toppin walkin bound to the deck
Respect the View Please, dude you can't Neglect

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Cause these are the pictures we see, Livin' West Up Coast in the land of BC
Ocean Ride, put the stressin' aside, inside, outside with the lesson implied
It's all what you make in this sport
You can catch me on the ferry on the way to my port

[Verse Two]
Off the Water well the sun with the top of the swells
Recodnize a Mammal and my non-Topical Self
Someone's Sun Catchin', Got the Tropical Oil
You can Smell it in the air is she a Tropical girl?
I'm on top of the World, this is mine for the Spittin
We all got Locations to Rep, Rap a Statition
Not to keep Hittin' cause you want him to Pee
It's a Nautical Bump we're also workin' your Jeep
You got doors downstairs, deck 2 just waitin
To reach the Terminal and slide out while Debatin
The 99 North, or 99 South, the number 1 in or the I5 out
{???}
Out do er are all you niggaz only the stuck on verbals
Who can really bring a scene and describe the hurdles
Time to stretch, hit the magazine stand
While I give you my Distech it ain't Agony Man
I got a bag full of music shrinkwrapped then ready
Anytime you see me on the Ferry ask about it, get me
Rock Steady to the (uhh uhh)
Dont let me see you stand there just push it through

[Chorus]

Cause these are the pictures we see, Livin' West Up Coast in the land of BC
And these are the pictures we see, Livin' West Up Coast, Vancouver BC
And these are the pictures we see, Livin' West Up Coast, Victoria BC
And these are the pictures we see, Livin' West Up Coast, in Naniamo BC

Yea..and other places
See it from the Seaside
Yea, Rollin', bobbin' , Floatin'
Yea, Get that Clam Chowder
You want that Clam Chowder (you want that clam chowder)
You need that Clam Chowder (you really need that Clam Chowder)
Feed the seagulls, yea, keep it goin... </pre>
