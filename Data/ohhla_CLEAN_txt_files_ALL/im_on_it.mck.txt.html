Song:   I'm On It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Alright I'm on it, yeah I'm on it
Fucking right I'm on it if I want it
I'm coming like them people
When you wanted with no warrant and no warning
Early in the morning, my money spawning
I'm balling like rollers and own the Spalding's

[Verse 1]
Mouse traps for the rats in the dope house
The fiends coming and them boys giving dope out
They selling cocaine just to get a dock house
Money make the world go round can't go the broke route
When jack boys come to k with the scope out
Your chicks get dope dick and give dope mouth
I'm allergic to fake niggas yeah that's no doubt
I'm allergic to fake niggas yeah that's no doubt
I'm allergic to broke niggas yeah that's no doubt
And soon as you came damn I sneezed then I broke out
Drop the top and let my girl hair blow in the wind
Hail Mary for this paper, I'm living in sin
Father forgive me but I need them 40 acres
And a beach house in Jamaica
And some flootsies for the Lakers
See your girl she got that fire
But my girl got that Rihanna
She will have you niggas ouchea throwing bottles

[Chorus: x2]
Alright I'm on it, yeah I'm on it
Fucking right I'm on it if I want it
I'm coming like them people
When you wanted with no warrant and no warning
Early in the morning, my money spawning
I'm balling like rollers and own the Spalding's

[Verse 2]
Homie I'm still a boss, with a street aura
Play chess off the board, YNT on board
Yeah I got the game off the board
And I'm so off the board
With those who impersonate
It ain't flattery to imitate
You gotta be thug to affiliate
Without a shave, I got clean face
You too spec to tell
You aware what heckler is, you aware what Lecter did?
These streets shit fluent,
Got nigga been gone over decade with street influence
All this street endurance, you need some insurance
Do a lot of paper work, fucking niggas who fuck with me
We call this up my paper work, ya'll giving these suckers prays
Why don't you stay for church and watch you be fall your brain out
That's the book of G, first verse
And it's death on a hater, what you know about that curse
Take your ass on a boat ride, what you know about that hearse
Got nigga better think about it
Come on nigga won't think about it
Got niggas ready to kill you without a dime
Just to get brink out

[Chorus: x2]
Alright I'm on it, yeah I'm on it
Fucking right I'm on it if I want it
I'm coming like them people
When you wanted with no warrant and no warning
Early in the morning, my money spawning
I'm balling like rollers and own the Spalding's

[Verse 3]
Nigga I'm sharper than the teeth on jaws
On the 16 bars, I'm harder than cardinal jones
Smash rebel on the track like ping pong balls
Through coupe with yo boot doing loops in the coup with no roof
You said I got brain from your dame in the range
In the passing lane
But you really ain't got no proof
Get the fuck from the front of my Jag
Don't let a nigga handle me bad
Take me away from my plaques,
Stop me from getting my cash
Broke bitches ain't gon last
These getting money niggas gon win
You must be paking on up
If the fuck you ain't digging on any
What the fuck? You ain't drinkin no gin?
Shit you ain't speccing no skins
When you hit the bitch I'm always gon grin
No wonder he's all mad dead
Bragging like that you wrong
Yeah motherfucker we on
Bitch I can get her to play my song
And watch her pop it like that in the thong
When I'm repping I be clacking that chrome
Like 16 shots to the don
My nigga my baby got daycare
Yea nigga that mean my money grown
Bitch you won't leave me alone,
Niggas won't catch me at home
Time to go ring the alarm
I'm ahead of my bizness I'm gone.

[Chorus: x2]
Alright I'm on it, yeah I'm on it
Fucking right I'm on it if I want it
I'm coming like them people
When you wanted with no warrant and no warning
Early in the morning, my money spawning
I'm balling like rollers and own the Spalding's </pre>
