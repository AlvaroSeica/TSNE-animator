[Nas]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you comin, he ran when you tried to blast that man
Missed him by inches, he sprinted, some of his boys 
on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standin next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollers loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look, like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tryin to live out, his old wild-out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggaz could not aim and innocent niggaz died, you ask why cause of a...
 
[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer...
You just a accident murderer...
 
[Rick Ross]
We grew up doin graffiti, now hollows is gettin heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck 'em all, we ballin 'til they come lock us up (Uh!)
Twenty to life, I'm clubbin, blowin twenty tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marl'n all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a tec off the shelf, live forever that's Insh'Allah!
UH~! Memoirs of a rich nigga
(Whoo!) Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
(Whoo!) New Benz, chrome rims are for show killa
(Whoo!) You niggaz accidental, choppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, cain't be dodgin my clique {M-M-Maybach Music}
Cut a check, I use your bitch for some bargainin chips
In a hole sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This .45 in control, +God Forgives and I Don't+
 
[Chorus]
 
[Interlude: Nas]
Accident murderer..... 
Accident murderer..
You just an accident murderer....
 
[Nas]
Yo... 
For my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds 
and I'm guessin, tell me who you impressing?!
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test 'em
Make 'em throw up they hands, yolk 'em up, playin and wrestling
Watch 'em grow to a man, I see 'em now they reppin
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin where the respect went
Can't play with these lil' niggaz, gangsta lil' niggaz
Can't hang with these lil' niggaz, they kill and they reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you ain't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary
