Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Lately a lot of shit been on my mind
My home big but it be quiet
Lately a lot of shit been on my mind
My home big but it be quiet

[Verse]
I got my faith in the law, devil knockin at my doorstep
Rosary around my neck, I'm prayin for the Lord's help
I do more for others than I do for self
Weight on my chest with no spot, I need mo help
No crimes on record but a criminal past
You see a real nigga walkin? Let a crimin past
One man, one mic plus a pen and a pad
No subliminals, pop at yo subliminal ass
Penitentiary calls Â– I answer and I listen to em
Need money on yo books? Fuck it, I'm a give it to em
Real niggas speakin so real niggas listen to em
We all got the same heart, it's beating to a different tune
Same building, different rooms, with different views
I know some young niggas, dumn niggas that ain't got shit to lose
When them birds touch down, they celebrate like 50 cruise
So they can get that Mr. T ice, I pity the fool
Clippin the newsboy slang, over a gold chain
Just another day in New Orleans, ain't a thing changed
In my city we worship soldier slim and choppa bullets
Them young niggas turn they music up, they load the choppa to it
East side the choppa tulies, uptown the downtown
Nigga surround yo house with bass pumpin, that's surround sound
Nigga aks around town, ain't shit sweet
Several bodies found around town and that was this week
Sharks swimming in the water, boy this shit deep
The game changed a lot but still I remain me
One of the realest, blame the game, don't blame me
Gudda to the Gudda, double G, I'm the same me
Lately, shit been on my mind these days
Tryna thug the crime wave but we know crime pays
Lately, shit been on my mind these days
Tryna thug the crime wave but we know crime pays

[Chorus]
Lately a lot of shit been on my mind
My home big but it be quiet
Lately a lot of shit been on my mind
My home big but it be quiet
Lately a lot of shit been on my mind
My home big but it be quiet
Be quiet

[Outro]
