Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

(Verse 1)
Ever since the day, you went away
And left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same
Oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes
The moment that I let you go
I just
Broke
Down (Down...)
Baby, if I ever get the chance
To be with you again, I'm a sacrifice
Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man, would made me feel so right
It's nice
To smile
When I get your phone call at night
But I rather have you here with me
Right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

Pre-Chorus: Natalie
I gotta let you know
I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought
That I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know
I think, that we are destiny
For you, I cross the world for you
I'll do anything

Chorus: Natalie
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me and roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Break it down, now, I tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you, it's so, damn
Real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Everytime we speak, can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me
And you miss me and you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around, waiting for you
Put it down, be the woman for you
I'm fallin', so deep for you
And crazy over you, I'm callin'
Callin' out to you
What am I gonna do, it's true, no frontin'
It's you, ain't no other
I can no, longer go, on without you
I'll just
Break
Down (Down...)

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse: Big Gemini]
Look, ma, let me talk for a minute
Gah, feeling me and you ain't finished
Got the messages you left on my phone
Said you missed me, girl
When gets to being alone, now
Your world's turned upside down
Without me, being 'round
Hold up, now
I'm not done
Sit back down
See, I was goin'
Crazy for you
Before, you were going
Crazy for me
I don't want fuss
And fight no more over me, girl
That's just
Not how it's supposed to be
Oh, baby
I'm crazy
You crazy
We crazy
I, want
You, back
You're my everything

Repeat Chorus

[Natalie]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh</pre>
