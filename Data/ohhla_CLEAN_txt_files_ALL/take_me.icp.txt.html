you know the irony of life is that you have like
this big dream to get where you wanna be
but once you get there you start to dream about where you came from.
I guess thats the part of the circle of our lives
like the hands of a clock going round.
if only we could wind them back and return to a time where the dream began.
its all too soon thats all will be is a dream in someones mind.

Look at me I'm famous on top of the world,
I finally reached up in time (im a superstar)
stand up, step back and take a look
is this really whut I had in mind? (i dont really think so)
I guessed them goals that we set in the day,
they actually came to be. (yup yup)
but now I'm lookin at a black white paper,
and with a whole book of memories (but we never read)

seven deep in the jeep with the camel top,
everybody and they drunk as hell,
?? and awesome dre and anybody by the right would see us
(cause we always went there)
songs were long and polution strong, and the faygo always warm and flat
(thats nasty)
but if now if this supposed to be heaven for me, then just give me my own
hell back

so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
cmon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray)
cmon and take me home
??

(cmon cmon) lets go yall

theres another festival down town,
take some bottles back up to the store
(i found two of em)
that would get us bus money down there
to get back we have to find some more
(might as well get drunk)
hangin our flyers up everywhere,
we coulda sworn we was makin noise,
(everybody knew us)
finally we had everyone in southwest
representin with the jj boys (everybody)

I stole to eat (i stole)
I stole to live (i stole)
I stole only to survive (if yous a hoodlum)
just like j said in 'ghetto zone' I stole a car with my tape inside
all we did was try to talk to hoes,
and none of them was tryin to hear (not 1 hoe)
it woulda meant so much more back then
cause now its fake hoes everywhere

so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
cmon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand) (where you at yall?)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray) (summer time)
cmon and take me home (delray)

mike p yall

southern rock for ya

rudeboy

oh lord dont let me get my girlfriends call
if she dont get off until two (we got all night long)
I finally show up at 4:30 am
and I still have to drop my crew off (but i'll be back)
now I'm alone and ontop of it all,
looking deep in the back of my mind (looking deep in the back of my mind)
I realised the key to a happy life
was right here wit me the whole time

Chorus x2
so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
cmon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray) (where you at?)
cmon and take me home
   
what up everybody I'm here chillin with samantha
"HI GUYS!"
and I bet you wondering how we like to do things around here
well we like to do 'em with family

were family, family
everyone of us is family
what would life be like without family
were family, family

well my name is joe and I flow like whoa
I steped on stage and I stole the show
mini c, she down with me,
but today I'm representin all family
save this song for years and years
guarantee on day it will bring you tears
cause you remember how things were back in the day
lets try to keep it this way

my name is mom and the mom the might (yea)
kickin that style that I know you'l like
im from detroit the city of boom (boom)
I used to send violent j to his room (whut?!)
when I bust this funky style
my money stacks up over miles
now I think i'll pass the mic
to another fresh MC I know you'l like

I gots mad love for everyone on this track
this rob rollin strong on a hoop attack
samantha's my daughter, my mom is my mom
nancy is my wife cause she is the bomb
(hey don't forget about me in this roll call)
joe is my brother who is standing tall
together there as powerfull as my unity
and i've been blessed to have my family

I am samantha, i'm a MC
rappin with my family
love is the word I chose to use
I spread it around like it's the news
I do the booty shake everywhere I go
and I prove I can dance and also flow
if you have a problem with who I am
you can go and jump in lake michigan

nancys my name and I got much fame
cause my familys on the team
I flow as I go so act like ya know
or get slapped in the head without a ???
I do the booty shake with my daugther sam
cause she's the one with the master plan
I got much love for new york and back
don't question me cause that's a fact

my name is kris, as if you don't know
I ??? for a while with my crazy flow
I was born and raised in ramulous
that's where I first learned how to bust
this song is making history
cuz it's real, it's all about family
im quite I don't say much and I'm shy
any minute though I might sting your eye

were family, family
everyone of us is family
what would life be like without family
were family, family

yea, the bruce brothers will never die, thats right its all about family
i'll hax anyone that ever messed with my family
my mom, yea, my brother and sister, yea and there kids yea</pre>
