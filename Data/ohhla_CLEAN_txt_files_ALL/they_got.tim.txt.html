First Verse:

Now this is for my niggas on the corner
Act bad, nigga do what'cha wanna
But'cha know they got a bigger eye on ya
Watchin', watchin', they watchin'
They got us livin' upon dreams
Comin' up on schemes
Quest for long green
We offin' the wrong team
Members seen December's alot longer
Wind's alot stronger, not too long, 'fore they drop on ya
Then you got pneumonia, can't be cured
Cuz you debt to a
BITCH, which you never met
Steady get along, but, check your tone nigga
Better get a zone cuz bills will split your home
It's on, empty pockets make an empty conscience
If we honest, most of our real die over simple nonsense
But Tim has promised himself, and he is better
But I can't lie
At times, I'm crooked as a Saint I
Ain't I a hypocrite?
Or, am I excused cuz rules change so much?  This shit so thick!
Even my lil' clique is out'chea lookin' out for partners
We've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, makin' fool of us

Chorus:

THEY GOT US
Livin' up on dreams
Quest for long green
We offin' the wrong team
It's sad life!

(4x)

Second Verse:

Nowadays,
Everybody got their lil' issue with pictures of Malcolm and Martin
But nobody's takin' steps finishin' what they died startin'
Caught in this World of material
Baby serious
To save a nigga, it's gone take a major miracle
THEY GOT US, clutchin' our riches when we pass niggas
But, they ridin' tougher, DAMN THEM SOME SMART BITCHES
Picture, runnin' off a chain
Changes are different and it's strong enough to drag a truck or a train
"Maintain!" is what we holler
They game is what we follow
Claimin' our own kind on goals just to gain a dollar
Well who's the mack?
And who's the jackass?
Black ass just came and went, huh, that fast
And that's sad, cuz he may have been a gift from God
You knocked off, and that's the chance to lift us all
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
But, tomorrow's gettin' farther away
You best to pray
Let's just say this on God
Cuz all our attempts at takin' flight, tend to land in the morgue
Lord, I lay me down to sleep
Take my soul and help me teach my people how we really could run the street
Cuz we beat
