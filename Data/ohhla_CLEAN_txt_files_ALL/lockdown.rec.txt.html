[Intro: Rhyme Recca]
Ah, ah, check it out, Recca
Represent it like this

[Rhyme Recca]
Rat like von, sick like Saddam, the Recca bombs
Enemy, M.C.'s like walls in Vietnam
Far from calm, cool, rough like barb-wire
Rapid fire murder M.C.'s like Michael Myers
Mass destruction, crushin', men wit no discussion
Heads I'm rushin', like toilet bowls I be flushin'
Bullshit M.C.'s who lack raps like these
My R.A.P.'s burn M.C.'s like S.T.D.'s
I rap, whenever I step, bullets eject
And those who slept on rap, will victim to this tech
Weak, I freak, complete profound underground
Cuz sound compounds, like Chuck D., I shut 'em down
Recca the sound, bang it in ya ear like headphones
My flow dope, now causin' "demolition" like Stallone
Leave me alone, I'm not the one, two or three
Or fourth M.C. wanna be, I kill like H.I.V

[Chorus 2X: Rhyme Recca]
I lock 'em down, the way it's supposed to be
When the fake M.C. tries to step to me
I hold it down, the way it's supposed to be
Like a real M.C., on the M.I.C

[Rhyme Recca]
Expect the unexpected, most respect
Wit disrespected, in pieces you will be rested
Tested, Recca kills germs like penicillin
Antibiotic, mentally psychotic, when I drop it
Stop it, you ain't got enough skills to build
My ex-grills cause chills, plus I enter the ill
But if you will I break arms, legs and necks
My mic checks cause side effects when I flex
Like a muscle, fuck the hustle, I'm quick to crush you
Quick to rush you, I "def jam" rappers like Russell
Simmons, deadly venom, lethal like cancer
Battlin' the records, like tryin' question the answer
Dummy, it don't make sense to get against the grain
I bring more pain to dissect ya game
Retreat, threaten like you hard is illogical
I be the diabolical, violate, I body you

[Chorus 2X]

[Rhyme Recca]
I'll make you famous, Recca gets all up in the anus
Verbal homicide, hit 'em up wit the stainless steel
Rap appear real like revelation
The confrontation, I murder M.C.'s like Jason
Vorhees, M.C.'s, they ready for the ball
Bulletproof army suits and loaded four-four
Bulldog barks, I spark M.C.'s like matches
Laser beam flashes, bodies turn to ashes
Put on ya glasses, now you see me like a T.V
Photographic like graffiti, I come in 3D
Motion picture, paint and picked ya, record flipster
Holy scripture, press my finger on the trigger
BLADOW, I freak rap styles like wet jeans
Cock back gun machines, I roll deep like marines
Holdin' down the fort, nothin' moves but the money
Appetite becomes destructive when I get hungry
Best to front g, you ain't got nothin' for me
I'm fuckin' rappers up, period, end of story

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
