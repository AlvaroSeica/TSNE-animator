Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The lord looked down from heaven on the children of man
To see if there is anyone who will understand
Do you speak of righteousness weigh the violence of your hands
Judgment will return my friends to give justice to the land

mmm mmm

The vows are upon me I've surrendered myself
And I pray that you would see not all that is sad
Awake up my glory awake my guitar
Play me songs of mercy cause the world has gone too far

mmm mmm

Why should my liberty be judged by another man
Why would I listen to the voices on the stand
By the fruits of your tree I know who you are

mmm mmm

The lord looked down from heaven on the children of man
To see if there is anyone who will understand
Do you speak of righteousness weigh the violence of your hands
Justice will return my friends to give judgment to the land

Mmm mmm</pre>
