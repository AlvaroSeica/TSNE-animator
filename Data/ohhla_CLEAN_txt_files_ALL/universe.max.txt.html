*radio chatter*

[Blood of Abraham - ?]
Why do you stay fast asleep?
From confrontations with the sheep
The message has been redeployed
The emptiness to fill the void
The transformation has begun
And all at once the world is one
And one could wonder where he pleases
Flashing smiles instead of pieces
How long will it stay this way?
A lotta noise, nothin' to say
The maximum efficiency
The selfish souls drowned in the sea
Plate tectonics in a drift
The dark sarcasm to a bliss
Once you join you cannot leave us
God will lick you with diseases

"The most destructive force in the universe...
....nothing can escape"

[Blood of Abraham - ?]
We don't yell respect
Just a test to keep your mind in check
Luminating our projects, (?) the cybertechs
Comprehension, intellect, select a time to recollect
(?) of an architect, a double sided bayonnet
Cutting all the safety nets and breaking down the saber tech
Historical revision, the one with the incision
I'm spittin' all the venemous, so we can all get on with this
Thinkin' it's unanimous, The Universal Scientists
All the endanger-est and back-breakin' like a mess
Workin' televangelists that's livin' in Los Angeles
All the scientologists, you couldn't even acknowledge this
(*scratch*) Abraham - The Universal Scientists!

*scratch* ("Maxim") - The Universal Scientists!
*scratch* ("Osirus") - The Universal Scientists!
*scratch* ("Compton") - The Universal Scientists!
*scratch* ("Yeah, y'all") - The Universal Scientists!

"We want to talk about..."
"The most destructive force in the universe...
...nothing can escape it"
"We (*scratch*) want to talk about..."
"The most destructive force in the universe...
...nothing can escape it"

[Blood of Abraham - ?]
Now I want you on my mind like I want you on my sheets
A king without a queen and my life is still complete
My daily allowance of Vitamin P from all the women's juices
Don't confuse us, man, I'm still ruthless
My family tree, got the folks out to sea
And the only energy you got is animosity
Livin' your days through me, intraveanously 
Ain't positive 'cos Universal's how I gotta live
It's intrinsic, to keep ballistic
My metaphysical form as the whole crowd swarms (Like fabric get torn)
So charasmatic, I'm sworn to always do the duty
The rhymes are problematic and they always come profusely
Once a fuckin' (?) man the noose turns loosely
(?) while the fuckers try to secure they sexuality
Creativley unstable because they're lookin' for they record labels

[Blood of Abraham - ?]
Mein Kampf's so full of shit,
can't swallow it's own pride, it's own pride
Mein Kampf's so full of shit,
can't swallow it's own pride, it's own pride
Mein Kampf's so full of shit,
can't swallow it's own pride, it's own pride
Mein Kampf's so full of shit,
can't swallow it's own, swallow it's own, swallow it's own

Why do you stay fast asleep?
From confrontations with the sheep
The message has been redeployed
The emptiness to fill the void
The transformation has begun
And all at once the world is one
And one could wonder where he pleases
Flashing smiles instead of pieces
