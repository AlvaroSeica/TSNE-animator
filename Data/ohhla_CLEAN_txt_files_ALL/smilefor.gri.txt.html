Song:   Smile for the Blade
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Smile for the blade, everybodys watching
Everybodys always got something to say
They wanna put you into pieces, lie and make you believe it
Limit you from succeeding, Then take away your fate
Smile for the blade everybodys talking
Everybodies always got something to say
So no matter what it is and no matter what you do
There will always be a person trying to take it away

I've heard I don't know the words that come out in my songs
Like I was gone when I wrote it and didn't see the pendants outta my palms
Are you kidding, I understand that you have an opinion but it's ludicrous to
Think that I simulate? what I'm livin in, and it pointless cause I'm not a
Person of arms, with the whole world screaming and ready to bring it on
No point, cause I don't see the contest in art I only embarked in this
So I could depart and free parts of mind and what did I find
Grown ass men acting like bitches fighting over the time
Goddamn I'm sick of all this trying, to turn around and see a mouthful nails
Hurting me, Faking a smile and I hate it, cause I'm a fan of truth and you
Mothafuckas lie to get by in this game full of fools
And it's Useless, so you guys can chastise and blame me
But no matter what you will never change me

Smile for the blade, everybodys watching
Everybodys always got something to say
They wanna put you into pieces, lie and make you believe it
Limit you from succeeding, Then take away your fate
Smile for the blade everybodys talking
Everybodies always got something to say
So no matter what it is and no matter what you do
There will always be a person trying to take it away
Smile for the Blade

And Everyones an expert when it comes down to my life
And speak like they knew me before I got in the limelight
And what the hell does that really mean, I busted ass
To get these broken hearted love poems printed up
And seen and I liked it, so why you bringing me down
Your either trying to help me or burying me in the ground
And as of lately, I'm feeling a little drowning in the negativity
Surrounding me making a sound and you hate me for it
You gotta be out your mind thinking I would give a damn about
The flaws that you find, cause I'm human and never had
A problem with that and it's a shame that you think that I would stop
Cause of that, say never, this is just the way to behold
The best way to gather round the flame in the cold
So you can go ahead and chastise and blame me
But no matter what you will never change me

Smile for the blade, everybodys watching
Everybodys always got something to say
They wanna put you into pieces, lie and make you believe it
Limit you from succeeding, Then take away your fate
Smile for the blade, everybodys talking
Every bodies always got something to say
So no matter what it is and no matter what you do
There will always be a person trying to take it away
Smile for the Blade</pre>
