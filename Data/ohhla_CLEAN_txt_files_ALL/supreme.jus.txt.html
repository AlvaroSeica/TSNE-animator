[Jus Allah]
Jus Allah is black god, runaway slave with back scars
Devil won't let me in the cave, I'm blackballed
Niggaz ain't fuckin' with the sciences, at all
For every five divine, there's 95 slapped jaws
I fuck dimes, but I fucked a couple wack jawns
Pussy something that a nigga just act on
I can't help it, it's magnetic attraction
I can't melt in the sun, unless it's passed on
I'm the last born, the fucking end all
Marine tiltin' the machine like pinball
My niggaz fiend for the green like a menthol
When the fiend doesn't have a weed and some tin foil
We earn our stripes, turn out dikes
Smoke out, the sight brother, wanna burn off bikes
The anamoly, niggaz need to turn off mics
More idealogy, then you can learn off Christ
Set ya motherfuckin' mind, I'm the best you can find
It's like, lightning, striking consecutive times
Allah gave me extra shine, extra divine
The finest flesh mankind's ever designed
You ugly motherfuckers got a reason to be leaving now
Soap season on the hethen's and the reason now
We forever foes, beef will never close
Til you laughing in the pose in your dress clothes

[Chorus: Jus Allah]
Supreme, we shall reign supreme
We shall reign supreme
We shall reign supreme
We shall reign supreme

[Jus Allah]
We the motherfuckin' supremes, but not the African queens
It's like, having a dream in red, black &amp; green
Jus Allah is no trick, what magic is seen
You got devils, but then you got immaculate beings
The rap kings, y'all can't rap, what the fuck's that?
Motherfuckers sound gay like love shacks
Bitches I fuck, give me head and lick the nut sacks
And when I don't give a fuck, I never have the glove strapped
You against me, niggaz is pigmy
Make you fucking slaves like Fonzworth Bentley
You fucking fags, I rhyme like I'm in another class
You sound strange like questions undercovers ask
You just a joke, you no where near close
Motherfucker the seed, run weird like queer folks
You got rings in the wrong fuckin' earlobes
Hope God shows mercy on your meer soul
One mention of Allah and the tears roll
Fear grows in the motherfuckin' spear slows
One rhyme from divine, and the mind snaps
Spy cracks, there's a motherfuckin' time lapse

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
