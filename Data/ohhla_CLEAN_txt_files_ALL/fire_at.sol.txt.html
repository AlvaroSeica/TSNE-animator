[Intro: Solomon Childs]
What you say, New York City? (I am Staten Island, man)
Here we go (here we go) Niggas don't want it with me, son
I'm tellin' you, man, I got the shit on my back, man
Ya'll muthafuckas, kneel and kiss the ring, the king is here

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Fire at your own risk, murder with the steel grip
Niggas talk a lot of shit (Niggas don't want it with me, son
I'm tellin' you, man, I got the shit on my back, man)
Fire at your own risk, murder with the steel grip
Niggas talk a lot of shit (ya'll muthafuckas kneel
And kiss the ring, the king is here)

[Solomon Childs]
Time to bring the industry back to order
Work kingpin orders, stab nothing less than quarters
Results of been, nothing less than manslaughter
I want blood, the government left my fam to drown in Louisiana
Don't be suprised if you see me on top of a building
Smoke coming from the nose of the hammer
Louisville like pitbulls, sippin' gasoline
Shooting guard to this New York dream team
Been blowing them down since Grand Puba was getting skins
Even when Rakim and Jody Whatley was talking about friends
Life's a two-faced bitch with street credibility and jail pens
So fire at your own risk, murder with the steel grip
These niggas talk a lot of shit

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
This that intense adrenaline, like Red Bull with Bloody Mary
Pit life, push the powder down
Blood mota, big up to Washington Heights
Known for coke in the donias, with kill in my eyes
Like Red Soldier, wicked and paralyzed with amonia
My watch, in the Cuban polar, clientele been strong
Since the fat Oprah, batteries keep the socks heated
Ain't too much busting in the air, nowadays
Got to keep the ammo from when the beef is needed
Shit gotta be the raw base, or riz at the piff
That keeps me on my grind, money grip
Money on my mind, like Lil' Flip
Lil' Wayne, shit, Young Jeezy
Young transporter, count a little, camcorder
My ancestors run these corners
After West Brighton slaughter house, spark a techs
They be yelling "Billy Kid was black"
With a German six shooter, venom'll eat cha insides like a cougar
Nowadays the guns are called boomers
You gon' be praying to Latter Day Saints
These niggas imitate shit, like a kid with his cape
So you can fire at your own risk, or murder with the steel grip
Cuz niggas talk a lot of shit
Telling you, these niggas talk a lot of shit

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Twenty Oh bixs, nigga, what's really good?
Fuck all them other bullshit albus coming out with this year</pre>
