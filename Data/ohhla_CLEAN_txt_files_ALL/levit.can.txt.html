"You want power...but you're not big enough
 so you steal it piece by piece..
 take it in spoils...and step by step you'll weaken and the power is gone"

Levitibus..

I harness the power of the Chakra
Remote viewing into darkness, describing what I see in the process
Stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects, geoglyphs on the Pampa
A dose of papylamine makes you feel like a dream
the dreamstate is the playground for the supreme
critics attempt to follow a trend
Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men
to create a universe all I need
is 1000, trillion, trillion degrees
Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber
keep the noise down so I dont arouse my neighbors
Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman
In an unopened Coca-Cola can
showed the whole planet in coded program
Encrypted by a pro-scan modem with a low-band
hold up, let me load it in

"Darling I am a scientist..(you're a person, you ought to think that)
 None of this is able to work without an army.. (there's no need)
 vaporizin my spit and turnin liquid to gas"

I was created by intelligent design
You are merely a descendant of the unmodified
you diss me out of pride
but when you're finished talking about money and bitches you're simply out of rhymes 
even my worst album was sublime
if I don't slow down, I'll distort the timeline
Back through the time, tunnel to +100 Bars+ again
A master, like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon, the grand architect
Used to be a partison to Lamarkinson's theory but I lost the bet
no regrets, you live and you learn
I'm through givin advice, I just give concern
sterilize my hands to prevent catchin the germs
and try to rebuild all the bridges I've burned
I prefer modesty over con-troversy
but what am I to do when these jerks keep botherin me
Jealous because they can't rhyme like me
and they never had a scientific mind like me

"Darling I am a scientist..(you are a person, you ought to think that)
 None of this is able to work without an army.. (there's no need)
 vaporizin my spit and turnin liquid to gas"

I'm above average with verbal semantics
the aurora borialis in the form of a rap ballad
you look at me like "poor bastard
why cant you manipulate billboards with all your metaphor magic?"
no matter how hard I practiced
Every microphone I saw, I grabbed it
obviously thats the wrong tactic
I went through a long period of mourning and sadness when I wrote that Stan shit
but if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so
and i'll come out the eggroll with seven death scrolls
if you can find a better flow?
then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago
hey you shouldnt fall for the naivette
lyrically I'm the illest when my beats is ok
food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain
keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day
I'm ahead of my time, or so they say
I guess thats why I already feel old and grey
okay, thats enough knowledge for today, I'm killin em
you best not forget it cuz this is Levitibus
