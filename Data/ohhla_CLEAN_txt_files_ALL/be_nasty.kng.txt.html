[Timbo King]
Nigga Be Nasty so pass me the hot burner
cuz I'ma squirt, shoot 'em shoot 'em squirt, kisses hard dirt
Dirty sound gather round, the boots keep stompin
Brooklyn to Compton, I set it up like Al Sharpton
cuz I get wreck off the instrumental
I make it simple as a blow to your mothafuckin temple
I know it hurts money, but you fuck with the wrong man
So have these nuts to your honey, cuz everyday is a payday
Forever my lady, huh forever my AK
Now who's real when it comes to the steele, never ran never will
I got the mad skills, I'm spillin drinks on 'em, wordem up
Blow 'em up yo it's time to throw the sheets on 'em
on the corner cops harass me
cuz it's good to be a nigga when you're nasty

Chorus 3X: Spark 950
Yes we're nasty, yes we're nasty
It's good to be a nigga when you're nasty

[Timbo King]
Ahhh shit I need another clip
cuz if you flex I get vexed with the techs, who's the next 'vic?
cuz I'm a Gravedigga, on the mic I'm a brave nigga, the top paid nigga
So bring da mothafuckin ruckus, can you dig it suckas?
The heat is on yo, if there's beef I only have to, make one phone call
Get the peoples in a minute, fuck the sheriff I shot down
the god damn lieutenant, took his stripes off his shoulder
Slapped his wife up, took her home then I boned her, I'm kinda heavy baby
Put the pedal to the metal cuz these niggas gonna push daisy
So don't pass me, cuz it's good to be a nigga when you're nasty

Chorus 3X

[Timbo King]
*singing*
Bring 'em on bring 'em on come to me
I'm going to shoot 'em down one-two-three
If that sucka don't cough up blood
Take his face and shove it in the mud
Yes, its the murder sound, underground flava
I hate a bitch cuz a bitch is a traitor
Pop that coochie bitch pop that coochie
Suck my dick cuz you nothing but a hoochie..

Sparks swinging to the rear, officer, officer ain't no crack in here
So what the hell you want from me? Cuz I'ma nigga thats funky, see?
I ain't playing see, where's the loot at? You better start paying me
On the corner cops harrass me
cuz it's good to be a nigga when you're nasty

Chorus 3X</pre>
