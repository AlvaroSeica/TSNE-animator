Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One]
Attention all America! Here we come
Without fear it's the, UMC's
RNS kick the, reply to the man who said
we couldn't do it {*"Oooh, yeah!"*}
Well we started like slow, see
Before I was able to give blows of three
My man Tone couldn't get shows for me
But that's alright cause we're here now; we're here now
From the first to the last of the elements included
I'ma flip it wiser, meaning with the prudent
Recollection of my naan lawyer brother and kids
Here's an example of what smotherin did
I was supposed to supposed to end up
Without a harvest but the crew spore finally
of natural cause of course
Now when you hear the name U man, ask yourself who can
duck a traitor kind of fast and easily?
Flush all the haters in the path that seems to be
Not another in this dimension
I'm on the third y'all, and I'd like to mention

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
"Hey hey hey" "Here we go, here we go"

[Verse Two]
Okay I huff and puff, confirmin Kim is rough
You try that puffin stuff, hell I had enough
Sometimes I've come and gone
I hear my old adversaries and they're singin my song
Hey-a hi-a hey-a hey
I wish and pray they'd stay, stay the hell away
Away away, dead upon the shores of the Staten
Cause of cause of Kim, that first started rappin
A new style, a true style, a style of the new year
They, diss me too but now they sweat me anew
I flow with Hasim Kwan I'm gonna flip kung-fu
And flip my style and start to flow Tang-Wu
Little boy blue come blow my horn
You had a chance to beat out but now your chance is gone
True you knew me when I wasn't all that
But you dissed me in fact, behind my back
So now my mark is set and I'm set to attack
I flow the facts, and here's the exact

[Chorus] - 2X

{*scratched break: "too bad"*}

[Verse Three]
I took a punch from school and got an easy diploma
All the boys and girls said "Kim your life is over"
Even my lady girl held her part
Said I was a zero and it broke my heart
Cunnin are the actions of the few who dissed the U
(Try to blow us over with the compliments)
Too many complications have arisen from the fact
that you thought Kim was whack, way way back
But now ain't then and things ain't always what they seem

Yeah, I know what you mean
Like push, push, in the bush
It's a free-for-all says that girl from where?
Free for all the full, members of the U
Dear you never came around where we were in fact
Now that we're live and the stage is the scene
Song generated to its greatest potential
I think back to 1989
"You can't rhyme~!" Get the gills you little slime
Slug you get on out cause
{"I don't love you"} I got one for that
What was the moral of this fat episode?
Doubt me, I'm not the one
I'm not the one, I'm not the one for that
No I'm not, oh no I'm not

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
