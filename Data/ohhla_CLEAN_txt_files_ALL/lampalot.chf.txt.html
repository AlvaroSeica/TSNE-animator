[Intro: 12 O'Clock, (Raison the Zoo Keeper)]
Eh yo, what's up nigga? Roll up that shit
Yo, where you comin from, nigga?
(The fuck you talkin bout?)
I'm comin from Franklin
Nigga, Brooklyn Zu
(Yo, I got a bag) You got a bag?
(Nigga, just give me $5)
Aight, you know I'm sayin, duke? (Word up)
Now which one of you niggaz really got dough?
(None of us) Yo, yo, yo

[Chorus 3X: Merdoc &amp; 12 O'Clock]
We some GQ, get fresh, lamp a lot niggaz
Lettin all the world know, we be gettin high

[12 O'Clock]
What's up, nigga? Look how you strong, workin em off
Got that hoe-ass bitch tellin you you ain't worth it no more
She fuckin while you on tour, the nigga next door
Y'all even played basketball, should've punched ya in ya jaw
Now nigga need to stay on tour, 10 g's is worth more
She's a chickenhead whore, tryin to score
I knew a bitch like that before, named Moe
What a mink in the snow, a rink on the toe
12 O'Clock know, a bitch never want a bitch
Bitch!

[La the Darkman]
Yo 12, this bitch Sky livin in Bed-stuy
Used to be a hon' until she started gettin high
The high school prom queen, now she prom fiend
Her man was 85, so he sold her a dream
Told her he was rich, so she sucked his dick
Swallowed all his cum and she didn't even spit
Suckin him off in the whip, he loved that bitch
He loved that bitch.. he loved that bitch

Chorus 3X

[Shorty Shitstain]
I know this nigga on the Hill who got mad mils
Some masses, got credit cards, I mean this nigga got big bills
Well, anyway, I'ma sick him
cuz his girl Dawn put me on to the whole bitch shit
She say he don't be home to caress her
So I undressed her and made her feel better
He got the safe in the basement under the cemented floor
So what more, could you ask for?

[Popa Chief]
Last but not least there was a chick name Sable
Drinked like a fish, smokin niggaz under the table
A veteran, she'd bein doin this for years
Plenty exotic gerdles, plenty imported beers
She met these drug cats but they were doin everybody out
I said "Everything we need to chill with is at my house
I got a hot tub plus two bear skin rugs"
Drunk conversation, plenty of stimulation
And that's why my drug brothas walked in
Niggaz we're sayin "We all know what happens
Get off the tracks, girl, that drug train is comin"
