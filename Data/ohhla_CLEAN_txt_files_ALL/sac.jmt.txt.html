[Intro]
You've watched so many people die...
You've watched so many people die...

[Antz: movie sample.]
Sacrifice- to some, it is just a word. to others it is a code
{yo, Ikon the fuckin' Hologram}
What matters is the colony.
{take ya'll motherfuckers to war, what what}
He's willing to live for the colony, 
to fight for the colony, to die for the colony
{yo, yo, yo}

[Verse 1: Ikon]
Witness the art of combat
the center is where the bombs at
It's illegal for the feeble to see beyond that
Upon that, cyanide gases, sentinel dent through ya ventricle with nine axes
Time lapses, we on with, brutal and terrible conflict bomb shit
You gone quick- on a mission to meet your savior
A pitchfork through your bitch-heart [in] Castlevania.
Slayin ya'- we blaze all men
And storm through Allah battlefield with suede Timbs
The ra-ven {raven screech} who made men eyeless
Blinds evil, like a needle through the eye of Osirus
My vibrance will span to Negril
With the violence of Hamburger Hill, to kill
What, what

{unknown sample}
to the depths I dive- I dive

{scratching of the word "Sacrifice" as said by Big Pun in "You Ain't A
Killer")

{Verse 2: Jus Allah aka Megatraum}
The grains of my fingerprints rub against mics like match flints
Burn slow like Dutchmaster hits
Enter trenches of arms, the Paragon spawn
Your body's carried and dropped like surrogate moms
??Sarialities promote?? to battle me
??Find enemy beats, awaken my forsakens off the balcony??
A jaded man, never follows the Lord's plan
Rises for sacrifice like Isaac to Abraham
Expect wideness from Heaven's excels
Coming outta my shells like metal projectiles
Connect soldiers by straight edges, you're left endless
Severed by the line then bisected your necklace
Dreadnaut leaving treadmarks from lead shots
Silence your voice box, with infrared dots
Your optics, forced to watch raw torture
Therapeutic, combining your pores with iron straws

{unknown sample}
to the depths I dive- I dive

{continuous scratching of Big Pun saying "Sacrifice" throughout the end}

{Ikon} - talking
You know the fuckin deal
The hunter has now become the hunted, motherfucker
Jedi Minds, severing your spine
What's the fuckin deal, what's the fuckin deal
You will be consumed by your own fire, motherfucker

{more Antz samples}
I know you will all do your duty

{Ikon}
Jedi Minds banging you in the face
2G's
Fuck all y'all

{Antz sample}
I am proud to send you into battle... </pre>
