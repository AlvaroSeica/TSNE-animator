Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I said it wasn't that long ago
when all you thought about was drinkin'
thinkin' bout the weekend
when you didn't really wanna go
till you knew that there was someone
when you're ready to roll

but if you feel like making war
then you better talk about it
before you get it started
and if you feel like makin war
then you better realize what you're fighting for
so while you're waiting, hoping
every little thing's gonna be alright
you gotta know when, you'll be
lookin for the ones that are ready to fight

so if you feel like making war
then you better talk about it
before you get it started
and if you feel like makin war
then you better realize what you're fighting for

they've been searching for the answer, oh
to all the questions that are known
i really dont think you
never found the reason for the one thing
that will, keep on movin while im losin' my mind

so if you feel like making war
or feel like givin' up
they gotta see that no one else can
save you from yourself

so while you're waiting, hoping
every little thing's gonna be alright
you gotta know when, you'll be
lookin for the ones that are ready to fight

but if you feel like making war
then you better talk about it
before you get it started
and if you feel like makin war
then you better realize what you're fighting for

so if you feel like making
feel like making, feel like making war
feel like making, feel like making, feel like making war
feel like making, feel like making, feel like making war
feel like making, feel like making war

so while you're waiting, hoping
every little thing's gonna be alright
you gotta know when, you'll be
lookin for the ones that are ready to fight

so if you feel like making war
or feel like givin' up
they gotta see that no one else can
save you from yourself</pre>
