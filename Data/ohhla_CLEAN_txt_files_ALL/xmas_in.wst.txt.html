[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem, right after autumn falls
Soaking it all in, then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't balling, feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here, come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Kanye West]
Yeah, uh, Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all living the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
and we wiping snow up off the windshield
It's still, wonderful night to be alive baby
And I'm, so happy I'm with my baby
And we, a lil' late with the Christmas gifts
Rushing for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is "Where my presents?"
She said "Shhh", she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said it's deer-icious, hahaha

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]

[Kanye West - over chorus]
Yeah, uh, uh
I'm like Bad Santa though
Everybody sit on my lap~!

[CyHi Da Prynce]
Yeah, mom and dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Huh, I'm over eight-hundred miles away
in the city that's so pretty
where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with 'Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York I'm still repping for the A

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]

[Teyana Taylor and Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashing lights up on a tree
The house lit up so niiiiice
With your family's where you wanna be
here on Christmas niiiiight
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel goooood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
let's have a Christmas in the hoooood

[Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashing light
Yeah, don't they shine so bright?
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
and tell me everything that you want
cause baby I'm your Santa Claus

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]</pre>
