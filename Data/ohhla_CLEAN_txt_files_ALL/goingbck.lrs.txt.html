Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Some of my favorite people of all time, are from Brooklyn
Jay-Z, Spike Lee, my Uncle Joel, Mel Brooks
The Beastie Boys, Lou Reed, ODB
Now - I'm not from Brooklyn but, this is my story

[MC Lars]
Once upon a time in the Bay, there was nothing left to say
So I had to get away
I'd been sittin all up in Duboce Park with Lamar on my mind
Like Alistair Grey, feeling strangely fine
Twenty-six years old, at a crossroads
Was it time for grad school, or time for more shows?
Time to rock my thesis, or write more songs?
Time to call it quits when I'd been doin this so long?
I couldn't decide, so I made an EP
with a rapper named K. Flay that opened for me
I helped her get discovered and on tour with #OH!3
I heard she got a deal, I read it in AP
I bought the Jay-Z book "Decoded" and I noticed something funny
You've got to grind and hustle if you want to make that money
I met a girl with purple hair, a Puget Sound grad
Fell head over heels, life wasn't that bad~!

[Chorus]
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - DJ Premier!
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - the RZA, the GZA!
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - Woody Allen whattup?
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - Jimmy Fallon yo you're killin it!

[MC Lars]
I went to Europe, with Zebrahead
Ed played rums on my set and it sounded so sick
Knew I had to get back in the game, stop sleepin on my craft
and bring that fire back quick
I made some comments in the press, that got some kids upset
on white rappers that were taken out of context
But Sage Francis had my back and I don't regret a thing I said
I was just bein honest
So I got lost and rode my bike around Lake Merritt
I found a safe routine, but yo I couldn't bare it
Every day was exactly the same like NIN
My upper playground hoodie, was starting to wear thin
That's a metaphor - the Bay was played out
My inspiration was gone like a cerebral drought
So I, got running, and moved back East
Built a studio in Greenpoint, and made a bunch of beats

[repeat 2X]
Now I could be enlightened, or I could be in love
Or I could be confused, or I could be on drugs
Or this Buddha in my pocket, might just have been a sign
that everything was back on track and everything was fine

[Chorus]
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - Jerry Seinfeld you're paid
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - Mike Tyson c'mon!
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - Eddie Murphy, Charlie Murphy I see you
I'm going (going) back (back) to Brooklyn - Biggie, respect...</pre>
