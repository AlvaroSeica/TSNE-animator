[Beyonce](Jay-Z)

Bass (UH), hi-hat (UH)
808 (UH)
Jay (UH-Huh ready UH-Huh)
Lets go get 'em (UH-Huh)
Come on (Cmon)

[Jay-Z](Beyonce)
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like purple bags
Now I bag B. (Boy you hurtin that)
Brooklyn bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere they never at
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to steam, stand back

[Beyonce]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

1-      Boy I try to catch myself
But I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go

2-      Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Repeat 2

[Beyonce]
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Cause like I'm losing it

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

[Jay-Z]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
Cause you gonna need help
Tryna study my, bounce
Flow glow, what's the difference
One you take in vein
while the other you sniffin
It's still dough
Po-po try to convict em
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin
Like 4-4s
Like her from the H-O-UST-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one to one nuttin after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my OH!

[Beyonce]
Baby I can't go anywhere
without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you?
That I'm having Deja Vu

Repeat 1
Repeat 2 until fade </pre>
