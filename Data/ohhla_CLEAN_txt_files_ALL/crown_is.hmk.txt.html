[Intro]
{*scratching: "The crown is mine" repeated*}
Yo, yeah
Yo... Heavy Metal Kings, check it, yo
Yo... yo, yo

[Ill Bill]
I'm the numerical value of death, 9 double-M, shallow lead and explosives
Powder keg that engulf and devour men
South of Heaven in the mouth of madness
Shoutin at the casket, these idiots is drownin in the vastness
My science is accurate, while your favourite rappers be dyin by accident
in the closet like David Carradine
Who the last man standin, who survive?
How can a man that stand on top of the water be crucified?
I never been the type to throw stones in glass houses
I'd rather throw lightnin bolts and terrorize thousands
Make it happen when I lace the captain, ran up in the Chase Manhattan
You can't see my face I'm maskin, now taste my ratchet
It's the Cult Leader, the Isa Mohammed of terror
Every morning wake up and see God in the mirror
The truth speaker, I'm the universal chronicle bearer
Like Charles Manson being interviewed by Geraldo Rivera

[Chorus]
{*scratching: "The crown is mine" repeated*}

[Vinnie Paz]
This is Heavy Metal Kings, hard body shit, sniffin white
I'm concerned with dyin, y'all are concerned with livin life
I'm in the Church of Anton while y'all are kissin Christ
You ain't fuckin around with Billy or with Vincent Price
I have love for distance, I am the resistance
I am Godly while y'all are just lackin some specifics
I study bullet trajectory, it's my love for physics
Chicken ain't got nothin to do with my love for biscuits
I am cancerous, everything that's around me dies
I am scandalous, everything that comes out me lies
I believe that you got weaponry but I doubt the size
You won't see me on anything I'm pokin out your eyes
A bunch of John Wayne Gacys, fuckin clowns
Any of y'all that don't embrace me? Knuckle down
I don't fuck with small pay, at least a couple pounds
I don't need twelve to trash y'all, give me a couple rounds

Yeah, hahahah, BRRRAP!
Vinnieapacy, Official Pistol Gat
O'Drama Bin Laden, La Coka
Billy Idol
WE MOBBIN ON YOU MOTHERFUCKERS~!
Heavy Metal Kings, hahahahahaha...
Pazienza, Ill BilL!
