[Lil Herb]
Park the Audi on the side-block, hop out hit the corner everybody tryna' swag jock
Lil Herby bitch I'm the man out here, bitches stand out here got them bands out here
If you cause a scene on the land out here I just make a call and you' stained out here, now thats boss shit
And I talk shit cause my neck and wrists got my frostbit
Took this niggas bitch now he stalkin', he can buy it back at the auction
I be countin stacks steady countin stacks add more to it then I count em back
I will never change nigga count on that you ain't gotta hide cause I'm ballin,
they be shootin' streets till they heater gone like they knees ain't strong then they fallin'
But I'm trained to go and my heater strong they need to ball bitch I'm Spaulding,
Jordans swish they like shorty sick I'm in sacks fifth boy I'm forty six
When they hear my A's they go super sick
I'm a young nigga wit' a couger bitch
I forever trap till I'm super rich Ion' gotta flex I be coolin' it
If he disrespect let that Ruger spit head shot his madoola split
Ain't no leg shots when I'm shootin shit
I got Steph Curry on the shootin' tip thats a hit an ran, drop a nigga then hit again, later catch me countin' dividends

[Chorus]
...
Ey' Bibby lets get it man, fuck these niggas up

[Lil Bibby]
Big chopper no Harley call me young Ali
Or M.J I been great
Bow down to your sensei
I been real they been fake
Dough boy I been gettin cake
I'm in the field with the biggest steel that tough talkin that'll get him killed
This shit is real, Lil Bibby I go so nuts I mean so nuts
Foreign cars when I roll up might hop out and just post up
Grab some blunts roll those up
Tell bro call some hoes up
Niggas say they finna take off but tell these niggas whats the hold up?
Cause I ain't seen nothin'
Kill shit you ain't seen nothin
Know what snitches get
Big guns for the witnesses
No talkin I'm killin shit
And I walk around with like seven thou'
Nigga rob me? You was probably dreamin blow his brains out
What the fuck was you thinkin I stay stapped
You musta' been drinkin its no lackin'
My bro packin
See a opp have bro clap him
Goin hard its a fuckin classic
Kobe with the blunt dont pass it
I know the game like I'm Madden I got work but I'm taxin
Armor tough when in I'm traffic
Caught him at the light and then wacked him

[Chorus]
...
Told ya'll man niggas ain't fuckin wit us, NLMB 150, we goin back in.. lets get it! L's

[Lil Herb]
Me and Bibby steady killin tracks
Spendin stacks and steady get em back
Sneak dissin we'll get em wacked
Keep bitches get them niggas back

[Lil Bibby]
I ain't with all the chitter chat
I ain't lien' I'm spittin facts
Cocaine flow I'm spittin crack
30 shot clip I'll give him that

[Lil Herb]
30 shots hit he ain't healin' back
No sympathy when a nigga wacked
Street shit in me I ain't feelin' that
G' shit in me bitch I'm peelin racks

[Lil Bibby]
Savin hoes I ain't into that
Trainin' hoes and then send em back
Your bitch on me cause I'm gettin that
I ain't savin money I'm spendin that

[Lil Herb]
Range Rovers take a spin in that
Forgiatos bitches diggin' that
Horny models on a nigga sack
40 hollows sittin' in a Mac
Switching cars like I'm swithin broads
No Limit gang all my niggas stars
Doors tinted on my different cars
Foreign lot up in my bitch garage

[Lil Bibby]
My niggas ain't finna starve
My niggas broke? you gettin robbed
I'm in the booth steady spittin bars
I'm the real deal these niggas frauds
And I'm pullin these niggas cards
Lotta niggas tryna act hard let the gat spark
Find his ass in the backyard

[Chorus]</pre>
