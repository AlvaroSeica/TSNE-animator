[Verse One]
Lights flicker on the frame of a light sleeper, watching sports
In a stained wife beater and boxer shorts
The night creeps in between the uneven slides
Of Venetian blinds and it sees signs of struggle
He resides in a jungle where the weeds dry and tumble
Every time he deserts love and leaves behind his troubles
This time it seems he's finally humbled
Defeated by the feline he's been trying to subdue, beaten while they cuddle
Now subtle differences got him running from images
Weird as it is circus mirrors are a serious fear of his
He stays a safe distance from the scary kids
Beard is big and he wears a wig in public appearances
Here he is... half alive in the flesh suit
Curiously appetized by the fresh fruit
Served on a dish at his nightly help group
Who dreamt of catching better Z's most people would've slept through
If you ain't been through it, then you don't know the way the days
Just waste away, a change of pace needs to take place
I play with razorblades and I shake
Till I shave my face in the break of day (light)
Lights flicker on the frame of a light sleeper, watching sports
In a stained wife beater and boxer shorts
Sunrays creep, in between uneven slides
Of Venetian blinds and it sees signs of struggle
He hides a bundle of demons behind the stubble
Sleep dehydrates until the dreams dry and crumble
Bleeding out his eyes, the scene of the crime's a puddle
Where he cries uncle and doesn't realize he's lovable
In love, a girl doesn't purr cause she sees
Something of hers stuck in a world that needs to be free
And this cat gets tongue tied till she leaves
A curiosity that could kill an entire species
See these fingers of mine? Take a guess
It's time to see if one of them fits the dark ring around your eye, she says
So she sends me to a guy who signs permission slips
And if his finger fits, he's gonna poke inside to see what's alive...
He's gonna poke inside to see what's alive...
He's gonna poke inside to see what's alive...
He's gonna poke inside to see what's alive...</pre>
