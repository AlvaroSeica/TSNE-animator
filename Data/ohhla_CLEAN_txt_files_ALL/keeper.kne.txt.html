[Kane &amp; Abel]
Sitting in church lookin at the preacher life is stupid
Should have seen last night got this nigga spooky
And Marvin Gaye would have made Kane wanna holler
I seen a nigga get shot for five dollars
And my grandmamma can't see why I slang crack
Gotta keep clothes on my little sisters back
I'm with three G's in the offer rain when it pass
Later on smoke a blunt with the halves, when the past
In my hood everybody dirt poor
But the preacher come through with the lexus on more more
Wonder if the church take drug money if they know
And I don't know if I live to see twentythree or twentyfour
Fore I go, I pray to god but the devil keep knockin knockin at my front
door
Long as the hood got gats clips and triggers
Martin Luther King couldnt save these niggas
I seen it in they eyes aint no future
Or is it, my boy Half Pint doin life
Sundays is when I visit and damn this shit get deeper
Am I my brothers keeper</pre>
