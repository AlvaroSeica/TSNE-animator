[ VERSE 1 ]
If I could go back and change things that I done
I'd stall with my life and the pain that I brung
To my mama all the drama livin kamikaze
All I wanted to do is make you happy and be somebody
That you could be proud of, that you could speak loud of
I love you for bein there and helpin me get out of
The scene, cream on the triple beam, B-12 to swell it
I used to sack it, then sell it
Tryin to ball but I always seemed to fall
But you was there to visit me every Sunday in the hall
But everytime I got out I was back on the block
Havin a sack and a Glock with a stack and a spot
You used to tell me what comes fast goes fast
But I thought it would last cause of the cash
Ski mask came in the picture when we got richer
Now instead of gettin paid I'm diggin graves for my niggas
Now what you told me comes to mind
My life's a struggle, mom, but if the world was mine..

[ CHORUS: female singer ]
If the world was mine
(If this world was mine)
The world was mine
If the world was mine
(I'd do everything)
I'd give you everything

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now my mama sees signs of depression
See, I'm stressin, now she's asking questions
About my homies who I bury, the new obituaries
Late night rides and the .45 that I carry
"Hurry and leave the game, son" is what she tell me
But I can't run, mama, I need therapy
It's tearin me to see all my dead amigos
I never thought my future would be in kilos
$100'000 a week, I make it
I try to buy you things, but you never wanna take it
You say you won't be a part of my blood money
Call me a thug and a dummy
This may sound funny, but it's all for you
Everything I do, I know you miss daddy
That's why I'm tryin to make you happy
Every day you tell me pray and ask the Lord for forgiveness
For my sickness
I try to get on my knees, but I can't at this time
Cause you don't understand my struggles, mom
If the world was mine..

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Troubled water seem to calm as the water settle
Now I'm livin fine sippin wine served by the devil
And my level of hustlin has increased
From $100'000 a week to controllin the East Side O
Mom says I reap what I sow
But I feel like a giant, so fee-fi-fo-
fum, I'm runnin the slums with drugs and lead
I need to quit while I'm ahead, she says
But the drug trade's a broke remedy
Now I got slugs for my guage for my enemies
Tendencies of a hustler doomed for death
Can't seem to make mama happy, so I'm goin for self
Goin for wealth, I done done it
Caught slippin at a light and bullets rattled my 500
Try to mash, but I crash into a stop sign
Sorry, mama, for the pain, I thought the world was mine

[ CHORUS ]
