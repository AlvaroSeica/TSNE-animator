[King Just]
Stand back for attack this is anthrax music
Rem put the work on the table so I'mma move it
Do it for the love, plus the smell of the bud
I'm addicted to this hip hop shit, it's my drug
Put the record to the needle, the voice speaks to the people
He's lethal, his only choice but sour diesel
You see through, F.U., you and your nephew
Talking like you left who? I ain't gotta step to
Guess who's back, in fact, they start running
Dog Will Hunt or Good Will Hunting
I'm coming for the crown, this is how I get down
R.E.C., D.M.D. Posse, we Dick 'Em Down
10 Rounds and they won't make it past the first
Cuz every verse curse'll have you riding a hearse
That doesn't everything and your image is nothing
You been fronting too long, Chokearm, I'm starting something

[Remedy]
Yo, this goes out to anyone who ain't family
Using me, way too long, losing my sanity
Fuck you, you and your crew, they can't hold me
Blindfold, knowing my name, but don't know me
The dred unc's told me, lay on the rest
One round, I take you down, it's a no contest
My fortune, is based on range and extortion
Fuck the world, blow it out of proportion
Still M.C. wizardry, Killa Bee invasion
Men of respect, nothing left then amazing
My face bears warpaint, mark of the sword saint
Give me a reason, it's assassination season
The projects are filled with projectiles
The streets are a jungle infested with snakes and killa reptiles
Sue me, or do something to me, it's nothing
You've been fronting too long, come on, we starting something

[Solomon Childs]
Smoke your bone marrow, pharaoh
This shit deeper than you think it is, this is fucking war
And that's just what it is, shit I'm worldwide
The next day mail, and I can't fail
Cuz I'm so fresh, they so stale
I'm all tan, they so pale
This the rebirth of Staten Island, they will all hail
They hustle backwards, I'm in the space capsule
No gravity, the main module, technology's newest component, I'm so on it
Same passion of a black hornet
Truth, like a young Siegel
With my fingers brown, from the smoke of bugle
Tops, dirty, like them dirty cops
Ugh, shit I'm the main crops, so noisy
A championship time in Boise State
Romancing the Stones in they estate
I'm location with the trey eights
Shit, I'm harder than any one of you grapes
This my terra-zone, Planet of the Apes, fucker</pre>
