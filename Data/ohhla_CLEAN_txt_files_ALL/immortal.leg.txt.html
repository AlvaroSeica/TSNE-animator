*talking at start* (yo, dogg) (dooo, dooo)

Ahhhh.... ahhhhh
Ahhhh.... Ahhhh

I stretch through the lightness the brightness of my journey
Handpicked the atmosphere, blasted off warnings
Like this when the low fog sets, in my concious
Travelings, guidance a spectrum astonished
The eighth induced in debtness wets
Non believers, even the driest of poets turn receivers
For he who knows not, the realms in which we occupy
Earth, the galaxies, universe the most high alive and outside
Respect for living things, its all cycles of nature down to a bees sting
When death sets in, pressing through lessons survive
And alive in the food chain, chlore passed a stain, its vane
Bury life's tame, those not impressed
Who taking for granted, wasting these breaths

Ahhhh.... ohhhhh
Ahhhh.... ohhhh

Ahhhh.... ohhhhh
Ahhhh.... ohhhh

The last time I closed my eyes I didn't wake
All I remember is walking through heaven's gates
The last time I closed my eyes I didn't break
I felt it return and take me back to fate
My body felt cold as my soul left this hole
So I know, I been down the same fuckin road
For centuries, now we be chained to misery
Of life, floating on a broken corn flake trying to make it home
And since we all drift alone
Some suffocate in these clones, within this dome of plastic
Gettin their ass kicked by karma size 16
Sometimes at night do you dream where to return and be
When you wear out your new identity
And return to the holy purgatory
Where your held in matrimony with time
I'm just an experience captured within rhyme

Ahhhh.... ohhhhh
Ahhhh.... ohhhh

The last time I closed my eyes I didn't wake (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)
All I remember is walking through heaven's gates (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)
The last time I closed my eyes I didn't break (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)
I felt it return and take me back to fate (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)
My body felt cold... So cold (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)

It's so cold in here (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)
At night do you ever dream?
Do you ever dream?

Return... return
Return... return
Return... return
Return... return
Return... return

Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream

The last time I closed my eyes I didn't wake (ahhhh.... ohhhhh)</pre>
