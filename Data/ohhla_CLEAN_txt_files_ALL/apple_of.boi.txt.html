[Chorus 2x: Jake Troth]
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye, why?

[Big Boi]
In the beginnin', they say Eve bit it
They're still sinnin' cause they lettin' every Tom, Dick, and Steve hit it
Therefore, I'm quick to not believe in it
Like the weed with the seeds in it
Now proceed like a G, pimpin'
And some of the things you've probably seen in your life
Made you think a certain kinda way about findin' your wife
or your better half, it's better to love and to hold
than to never have it at all and ball on the ho
Make your stock go up, my Apple stock split
Took a gamble caught it at forty and now it's over six
We're rich, trick! And that's in hundos
So overseas you might catch us eating Nando's

[Chorus 2x: Jake Troth]
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye, why?

[Big Boi]
Some say the preacher's daughters are some of the freakiest ones
They been deprived of fun and now they just wanna cut loose
like everybody else, they wildin' try to find theyself
And by the time they do, they barely have nobody left over
Feeling empty and alone, cause the youth is gone
The thrill has been killed so let the truth be told
Look in the mirror, my dear, and it appears
that the eyes are the window to the soul, oh!!

[Chorus 2x: Jake Troth]
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye, why?

[Big Boi]
Mother  say what?
Mother  say
To my people say
Let go

[Jake Troth]
II need a big bite, baby, a big bite, baby
of your sweet red delicious love
II need a big bite, baby, a big bite, baby
of your sweet red delicious love

[Chorus 2x: Jake Troth]
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye, why?

[Jake Troth]
You're the apple of my eye, eye
(WAKE UP!!) (*Echoes*)</pre>
