Typed by: Pharaoh160@hotmail.com

The Beatnuts are the bomb-diggy
Uhm yeah, uhm yeah, oh yeahhh

[Psycho Les]
Rolling over the GW, on the west side you on the way to the buddah spot
And all of a sudden you start hearing these little voices in your head like yo?
What the fuck is this?

[Chorus]
Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin' on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

[Psycho Les]
Off to the Pocono's with a couple hoes
In high heels with open toes
Blowing smoke out my broken nose
Bent at the cafe like smoking Joe
Ask me if I'm choking no!
I'm seriously bout it like MP I'm a shout it
Come early and rout it cause it's gonna be crowded
Hold on to your honey (why?) we all about it
When we start that puffin' watch the place get cloudy you can't breathe
After the show honey screaming Les you can't leave
But I gotta, so I grab my main squeeze
And bounce to the telly to drink and blaze trees

[Chorus]
Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

[Juju]
Yeah, I only fuck around with you cause the rest would tell
You know you love it plus we do it in the best hotels
Ain't nothing like them niggaz you had
You be sad, Ju the nigga you could never introduce to your dad
Nobody keep it realer then you that's so true
Body any man who dares to put his hands on you
Expense paid vacation for two surprise boo
Make you scream like a gypsy when I'm putting it through
Leave it swollen go tell all your friends Ju is holding
Guaranteed to make honey nut my shit is golden
Never folding like twenty boxes of trojans
Hard like an iceberg honey thinking it's frozen
Make you get sweaty and hot ready or not
Laying up in telly's with plenty of pot
Dru Hill don't know what I got they better stop

[Chorus]
Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

[Psycho Les]
When the beat thumps it makes the gold on your neck vibrate
Surprise the tri-state unexpected like a blind date
Crime rate goes up every time we drop
We can't be stopped every time we chop beats like a meat shop
I know we gotta reach y'all since you can't reach us through dis-connected beepers
I'm a monster for music so prepare for a creator double feature
Take a seat I'm gonna teach y'all
Take notes forget them crystal clowns
Beatnuts baby a real hip-hop sound
Refresh your memory with a Psycho Les melody
Yo what the fuck you telling me?
What the fuck you selling me?
I only cop it if it's that potent thing grown in Poland springs
And one very very important thing
Always quality and not quantity
Unless it's not the hy-drilly and naturally better look out faggot

[Chorus]
Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could</pre>
