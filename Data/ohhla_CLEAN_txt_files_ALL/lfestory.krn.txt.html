(*talking*)
Let me give you a little bit of, insight
To the road your boy had to travel, so far

[K-Rino]
Whoa, it all started on a Wednesday
Labor pains, hospital room BNK
My grandmother named me, I was ready then
They wrapped me up, and brought me home to the Dead End
We growed up with love, neighborhood was fast mayn
Mama made sure her son, always had thangs
Daddy was a hustler, he did it all his life
Playing pool poker, making bets and shooting dice
He didn't live with us, but he wasn't far from me
First time in my life, seeing large money
Kept my pockets full, fifty bucks was great then
Chilling in the pool hall, at the age of ten
By now we in the village, I'm a over achiever
I played a little ball, coulda been a wide receiver
Life was pretty good, and everyday was new
But thangs took a bad turn, in 1982

[Chorus - 2x]
This is just a few parts, of my life story
I know I did a few things, that wasn't right for me
I'm still learning though

[K-Rino]
I lost my grandmother, mama's married now it's on
You know the drill, me and step-daddy don't get along
Felt like a third wheel, to young to understand
Tripping cause I'm the only child, but that's my mama's man
But then he went to jail, pain she tried to keep it in
By then we living on Zalinsky, two deep again
I met some new friends, and day and night we ran
Around 8th grade, is when my rap life began
Boys would battle rap, I never heard of that
Went home and wrote a few, came back and murdered cats
Figured I must be good, wanted to prove it though
My daddy broke some bread, and threw us in a studio
I'm 17 now, first rap record made
Traveling and talking major deals, in the 11th grade
A few mistakes were made, I went from group to group
A few years later, still never seen no loot

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
I'm outta school now, still at my mama's house
A grown man now, stepfather finally out
Music was in my blood, the demo wasted scene
They said go get a job, I'm trying to chase a dream
Although I love em both, I knew I had to go
I asked my dad, could we try again he said fa sho'
This time we moving units, so now we making chips
I'm living life rapping, struggling with relationships
Around that same time, I dropped another bomb
I visited the nation, confronted to Islam
The truth was uncovered, they stashed the tablecloth
My content changed, started scaring labels off
Went through some up's and down's, no longer concerned with fame
The hard road I traveled, just helped me learn the game
And this is just a short passage, to capture my life
Parts of my past, but I still got some chapters to write

[Chorus]</pre>
