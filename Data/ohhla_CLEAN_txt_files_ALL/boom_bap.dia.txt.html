"Nique-mon-mon-mon-mon-dia"
"Nique-mon-mon-mon-mon-dia"
"Mon-mon-di-di-di-di-dia"

[Diamonique]
You know the style
You know the name
Chillin' in the top
But it's still the same

[Verse 1]
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the, boogle in the, boogle in the party
This Diamonique here to wake up everybody
With an instant classic like this was "Lodi Dodi"
No west coast slang, you better ask somebody
She's a hottie with a body mixed with Bonnie and the shotty
I could whip you with a battle verse or make you move your body
Whether if I'm feeling hostile or if I'm feeling naughty
Naughty By Nature, they love to hate ya
Hate to have to get your body braced up
I'm ready for war, got the Air Force laced up
Back up, rude boy, get ya face maced up
I fuck your face up, now turn the bass up
Tear down the club, fuck the whole place up
Sweat out your clothes, run the hoe's make up
For the windows, DJ's, turn the bass up

[Chorus]
[Diamonique]   You know the style
You know the name
Chillin' in the top
But it's still the same
West coast is back, taking over the game
[Mixmaster KD] "Di-Diamonique"
"Nique-mon-dia"
[Diamonique]   You know the style
You know the name
Chillin' in the top
But it's still the same
West coast is back, taking over the game
[Mixmaster KD] "Di-Diamonique"
"I'm like a diamond when I shine"

[Verse 2]
It goes
Boom
Bap
Original rap
Get bitch
Slapped for talking bullcrap
You ain't gangsta, bitch, you ain't never pulled strap
How y'all hate a west coast that rap like that
I ain't
Holding my tongue, got a trap like that
Two G butterfly, cause I'm phat like that
Keep up the hating, get a cap like that
What's worse
They probably slept on the first verse
For the second I record this second, I started rippin'
This no question to reppin' the I.E. when I'm flippin'
And my suggestion is bump a Diamonique when you dippin'
And my profession is teaching these hatin' bitches to listen
And I ain't stressing the hate from hater shit, I hate this shit
Haters are just mad cause they ain't the shit
At the type of destruction, already tastin' it
Ain't no escapin' it, my time is now (Let's go)

[Chorus]

[Break]
[Diamonique]   Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the, boogle in the, boogle in the party
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the dance
[Mixmaster KD] "Nique-nique-mon-mon-mon-di-dia"

[Verse 3]
I'm a little like Missy, butterfly, fox ragin'
Boss lady, queen of the hill, (??) Steele
The west coast next generation of real
Nique got game, playa, pass me the pill
It's a 7-0-somethin', it's just the first quarter
Runnin' up the slaughters, game is not over
The way these bitches hatin' is flagrant foul
Believe I got next, I kill who got now

[Chorus]

"Back up, back up"

"I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm like a diamond when I shine"
"Back up, back up, back-back-back up"
"Nique-mon-mon-mon-mon-dia"
