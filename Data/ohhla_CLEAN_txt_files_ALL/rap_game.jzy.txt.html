Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
They like young where you been niggaz acting like I got ghost
Till I came back in that black on black phantom ghost
Looking better the picasso ya'll should frame me
Killing niggaz kunta kinte ya'll should hang me

[Chorus]
Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen em come seen em go you kno how the game be
Snowman's back young you to wild
Had to switch it up man niggaz tryna stiil the style

[Verse 2]
Anyway any how the stering wheel black and mild
Make the broad back that ass up think I'm juvenile
My leather to soft just like wayne and baby nem
Teacher ask me what I wanna be told dat bitch a atm
Dream was to turn my whole block into a cvs
Can't trust then broads around the way them bitches devious
Drop it in watch it make it circle like a dvd
62 and 1 25 half a quarter key

[Chorus]
Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen em come seen em go you kno how the game be
Snowman's back young you to wild
Had to switch it up man niggaz tryna stiil the style

[Verse 3]
Anyhow anyway it's snitches born everyday
Best thing to do is get yo money and stay out the way
Hustla of the year damn right let's be very clear
If you sell them brick to rocks to stone then it's belvedere
Posted on the block with the choppas guess it's voka now
Hard slowed up niggaz switched playing socca now
Do it for the killa and the dealers kno you heard of me
Young came back to save the day see the argency

[Chorus: x4]
Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen em come seen em go you kno how the game be
Snowman's back young you to wild
Had to switch it up man niggaz tryna stiil the style</pre>
