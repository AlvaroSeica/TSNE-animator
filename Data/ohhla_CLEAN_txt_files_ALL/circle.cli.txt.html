Chorus: G Money
I'll always
Spit this gangsta shit
I'm always
G'd up gansterish
I'll always
Have a gangsta bitch
That loves my gangsta ways
Now and ever

(Verse 1)
[Romero]
Some call me a dreamer
And it seems it's very hard to achieve 'em
Some say it's impossible
I find that hard to believe
See, I was starvin' with this hunger
To sharpen my steez
We all came up from a circle
Surrounded by G's
Fully equipped
Money, drugs, bullets and bitches
Everything I ever wanted
I would hustle to get it
Bustin' my knuckles on punk motherfuckers that wanted to chunk 'em
Bullshit ain't nothin' til someone says says somethin' to someone
Ain't have it
Grabbin' the heater, peelin' the hammer back
Don't look so happy to see me when I come blastin' back
I counterattack
On coward ass rappers
Who can't even rap, but can act
Y'all still need practice
My story is told and sold in the slums and street corners
Bangin' beats full of funk, you bums are sleepin' on us
Ill just keep those names anonymous
Keep away from y'all piranhas, always biting and shit
And my so-called homeboys, they didn't even buy my shit
While my motherfuckin' haters still alive for it
It's the L to the O-B-O in the low, low-minded for 'sho
Armani cologne with some barbershop
Crop to get blown

[Bad Boy]
Don't approach me dude, I'm not in the mood
I'm fightin' the mind
And if I lose, I'll be out of my noose
I left school just to ride with the crew
Lighting a few
Tryin' to do, whatever lies, tries in my cube
I'm not you, so you can't be me
I'm M.V.P.
You ain't scarin' nobody with your M.V.P.'s
I'm high grade
The ice alone zippin' in the crave
To pop's grave, and I put that on life, I will not change
I'm the same cat
Witness the power of the brain cat
Only the wise willin' to stare me when I say that
Only the light will ever teach me what the brain can't
The only prize can say for the same man
My name tat'
It's all related to the same crap
I know I'm not a killer
And I don't intend to change that
Don't make me have to bring the game back
You fuck around and get your plates tapped
Or get your plates capped

Break: Romero
We all came up from a circle, surrounded by G's
Killers
Dealers and ballers
Prey parts from your dreams
All in a circle
All of our anger, all of our verses
All for one purpose
To be this mob that will hurt you

(Verse 2)
[Kishwah]
The way I grew up was rough
My big homies was my circle
Used to have to box with 'em, til my knuckles turned purple
But they gave me game at a very young age, so I'd survive
That's real
It's no lie, it's cause of them, I'm still alive
They showed me to be cold, inhumane and crude
The knowledge obtained in the streets wasn't explained in school
Like how to use
Game as a tool 'gainst some fool the same as you
From the
Flame and the fuel, provin' there's no change in rules
They were here before you came
They gon' be here when you leave
Silly game won't ever change that, so players, please believe
Hate's like a disease, it can't be treated or cured
Unless you take heed to my word, that's why I need to be heard
I need the whole world to listen up
And pay attention
To the lesson I'm about to teach your ass, class in session
Welcome to How-To-Keep-It-Real 101
First thing's keep a steal
Never leave without your gun
Trust no one cause no one there should be trusted
Seen the hardest fool, and they can't permit, when they got busted
Never let your gun get rusted, bust, then make sure to clean it
You don't want that shit to jam, understand, man, I mean it
Throw a condom on your penis, before you decide to hit it
When it comes to the AIDS, if she's got it, trust me, you'll get it
If I said it, I meant it
And I hope you learn something
Like to you soldiers with no stripes, it's time to earn something

[Brown]
I pull my life
Right out on the page
Read, "Dawg
These are my days"
These
Criminal ways, they got us criminal cases
We gots to hold gauges and smoke O's, ain't no changes
We in the motherfuckin' same place
With the same thugs
Same gangstas, the same drugs
It ain't no secret where we from, this Click to the One
Circle of guns
Sicker than fuck, looking for any funds
We spit this shit in front of everyone, every word
Is meant
How I said it, son
You motherfuckers
Ain't ready for it, but here it comes
This shit is thicker than one
Cause all my dawgs sleep in the same slums
Doing licks with the same guns
And we ain't ready to run
The game is all, but a game to some
The game is fun
Until your brains laying out in the sun
You motherfuckers need to stay calm
You see what happens to fools
That was talking, they getting bombed on

[G Money]
I'm always
G'd up gangsterish
I'm always
Kickin' this gangsta shit
I'm a always
Have a gangsta bitch
That love my gangsta ways
Now and ever
And that
Is that gangsta shit
At last
It's that L.V. shit (L.V. shit)
At last
It's that Mexican click
That love my
Gangsta ways
Now and ever
At last
It's Mexican shit</pre>
