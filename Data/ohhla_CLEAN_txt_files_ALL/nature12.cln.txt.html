DRUGZ:  Yo Debonaire, there's that girl you tried to talk to!
DEB:  Word!
DRUGZ:  Hey yo, baby, c'mere, yo, why you tryin' to front on my man
Debonaire?
ANGIE:  Debonaire?
DRUGZ:  Yeah.
ANGIE:  Uh-uh.  All the girls tell me that he's no good.
DRUGZ:  Oh, aaight, I ain't gon' argue, but yo, wussup with me?  My name is
Drugz!
ANGIE:  Look, all you Poison Clan brothers are no good.

Verse 1:  Debonaire

Debonaire's bad and so I'm called the Devil's Dad
I kick the funky stuff because I'm rough, and I'ma add 
That, girls, I cold leave 'em, I totally deceive 'em
I soothe and then relieve 'em, and then you best believe I'm,
Outie-5000, and I find another bitty
They tell me it's a pity, I want to get the whole city
Girl, so don't you be shocked, you best to get set
Women say I'm sick, but ask me have I seen a vet yet?
Naw, I just keep on, I keep hoe-in'
I keep goin' nowhere and, I can't stop and so in
About a two year period I think I'll put Jim in,
Wait up, lemme see, well, about a hunderd women
(Damn!)  Because of that, lots of women wanna hate ya
But I'm sayin', yo, it's in my nature!

Chorus:  Angie 
According to the Poison Clan, you can never trust a man
I know a man would fool around, but I still can't understand

Verse 2:  JT Money

Lovin' and leavin', that's what I believe in
Yo!  I only think about me when I'm skeezin'
So, women get mad and call me everything from A to Z
But I don't care, 'cause you know, I'm the J to T,
To the dollar sign, and you will hardly find
Another brother with a pipe game as good as mine
So I flaunt the gift that I was given
And don't ask because you know how I'm livin'
(True.) Bein' in love's for the birds; I ain't a pigeon
They say love is blind; I got 20/20 vision
(Word.)  So if you don't want your feelings hurt,
Don't be on my back like you a Poison Clan t-shirt
And when I tell you these things, it's not to make you
Mad at me, but you should know it's in my nature

Chorus

Verse 3:  Debonaire

Women crowd around and say, "Look how insane he acts!"
When they need to check out Drugz and Uzi, man, they're maniacs
It's facts that I'm kickin', so girl, ain't nothin' made up
I'm talkin' on a straight-up, 
but still you're sayin' to hold up and wait up
You think I'm lyin', while talkin' of my nature then
It's not my fault that all the women wanna hate ya when
People can't help it, they shouldn't wanna hate ya,
But they think it's voluntary, not just in my nature

DRUGZ:  Yo, now you see what I'm sayin'?  
Yo, Debonaire and JT, they ain't got  no flavor, but I'm versatille!
ANGIE:  Uh-uh, 'cause y'all run the same ol' game, day after day.  
DRUGZ:  Oh, naw, not me, baby, I'm different!
ANGIE:  Look, birds of a feather flock together.
DRUGZ:  Hey yo, my name is Drugz, and I change up like the weather!  

Chorus

Verse 4:  JT Money

People say the things I do to women make 'em rowdy
Lie to get down, bang the boots, then I'm outie
5 on a mission, see I'm not dissin'
As long as there's fish in the sea, I'll be fishin'
'Cause one's not enough; I ain't a wimp, I'm a pimp,
And uh, I ain't lonely for no relationships!
You wanna be the girl that I hate?  I ain't frontin'
'Cause this ain't the A-Team, slim, You Gets Nothin'
No money, no clothes, or a lil' kiss
None of that unless you like gettin' dissed!
I act this way, not because I hate ya,
But you should know, it's in my nature

Chorus, repeat till fade</pre>
