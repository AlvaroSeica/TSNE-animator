Song:   I Said Who Says
Typed by: OHHLA

Yeah I'm still the kid in the back of the bus
Drinking beer I'm not actually fussed
Still in it for the natural buzz
And my tracks are smashing it plus
I love those (SLUTS) who don't give a (FUCK)
Well they do really that's the irony
Could'ntgive a shit about piracy
You better know I'm bored now please don't lie to me
I just wanna get my girls well fed
Nice warm toast with chocolate spread (YUM)
I could do my work, or I could just get pissed instead
Here's my to do list it says, ring my chick get kissed in bed (MWAH)
You get my gist I pledge, I won't do shit till I need to, people!
Stop sayin that the world is equal, on FIFA I know that at beat y'all
I thought Green Street was a mean feat
But what kinda dream said let's make a sequel?
They shoulda made a sequel to space Jam
Still got ma theme tune bangin up the bass line
Got a great band don't have to place round
with a sign outside sayin sorry no I said!

Who said I can't do what I want?
No I said who said I can't do what I like?
Yeah bruv! You can do what you want
But but but you can't be what I do if you tried. (if you tried)

No I said who said I can't do what I want?
I said I said no I said who said I can't do what I like?
Yeah bruv! You can do what you want
But but but you can't be what I do if you tried. (if you tried)

You got a reaction, you got a reaction didn't you?
You took a white orchid, you took a white orchid turned it blue

I still think in the back of my mind I'm young, so I'm never lacking the time
And in that case I might ask that chick and her sister "wanna come back to mine? "
That slap was fine but can't blame a boy for tryin man
The way I see it if I got those two naked on my bed I'd actually die
But I'm all good baby, we haven't done much talkin lately
And that's all gravy, was there after I was like my mind goes hazy
Then I come tight with bars, strip it all down like stripes and stars
nice and calm (still got it locked)
Well your flights cheaper than flights to France
The newest recruit in the toon squad, bangin ya boom box pass me a few shots
Oi mate you what still just a teen man, bangin out tunes for you lot to DO ONE
And when I'm played again or paid again or laid again
I'll know I'm great again, champion name with age vien
Save it friend, I said talk to it save it
Don't want to force feed you words once I've made it, your chanced are faded
Dominate your best friends playlist
When I say rizzle, you say kicks, rizzle, PRICK, why you gettin cheeky?
Easy I know you've got ma CD so don't get B.R.A.V.E- Yes I said!

Who said I can't do what I want?
No I said who said I can't do what I like?
Yeah bruv! You can do what you want
But but but you can't be what I do if you tried (if you tried)

I said who said I can't do what I want?
I said I said no I said who said I can't do what I like?
Yeah bruv! You can do what you want
But but but you can't be what I do if you tried (if you tried)

Something's better than nothing, (how dare you)
How dare you (oh you cheeky bugger)
Something's better than nothing
Ah ah ah uh oh, ah ah ananana
na na na na duh duh dun dun oh, did that track just stop?</pre>
