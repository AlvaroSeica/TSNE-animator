[Intro: Heavy D]
Awww yeah, somebody for me baby
Love somebody, uhh, Funky!
Alright, let's keep in nice love

[Chorus: DJ Eddie F &amp; Nevelle]
I wish somebody loves me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
I wish somebody loves me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

[Verse One: Heavy D]
Bust it!! 
I'll search low and I'll search high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
My destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again
They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debating and delayed it
But still came up with the same old thing
Nothing; it seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?
I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Heavy D]
Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never finds
They also say that love is blind
It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me, for me (I know you want love)
Love, that's what I'm talking about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for (Maybe if you take your time)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score

[Chorus]

[Interlude #1: Heavy D]
Yo, Eddie F. break it down
Uhh.. Uhh.. yeah, here we go, alright
Let's keep it smooth, Nevelle get funky on them
Umm, alright y'all, yeah, alright, here we go!

[Verse Three: Heavy D]
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber 
(Yo, word to the mother!)
I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover (Somebody for me)

[Chorus]

[Interlude #2: Nevelle Hodge]
I wish somebody who loves me for me
I wish somebody who loves me for me
I wish somebody who loves me for me

[Outro: Heavy D] 
Yeah, maybe I should just take my time
Yo Eddie F, would you stay with me
If we packed our bags, and take a trip around the world;
And go find this cutie, you with it?
Alright, with it, let's go and do this!
For me, here we go, the way that I want to be
For me, for me, for me, for me!
Alright!</pre>
