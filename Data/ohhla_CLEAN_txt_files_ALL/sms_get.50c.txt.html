[Intro]
Nigga I aint fuckin 'round, SMS, get the message!, get the message!
SMS get the message!

[Verse One]
I go hard full time, duck when I pull mine
I run from one time fuck a pig ya dig
I go to war with one nine I work you see mine
But I aint never ever 'gon say I did it
In a hoopty hoody on, cruisin the back blocks
You stuntin on hungry niggas go 'head get your ass shot
Your neck got your chain on it bullet got your name on it
Im serious, but sometimes it seems like Im playin don't it?!
Shell case in your face the Ds got forty eight
They tryin to find a rat or call it a cold case
I know some niggas some snitches I know some bitches whos scared
I got some shooters around me and they stay fully prepared
We got them straps at you niggas sit there and look at flinch
Ghetto nigga get rich, what you think Im a get?
We got that pump and that chopper we got the tek and that sweeper
We got that Rueger that Mac I call it my bitch nigga ether

[Chorus]
All we do is get that grain, let my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang, Im talkin bout the Unit gang
All we do is get that grain, let my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang, Im talkin bout the Unit gang

[Verse Two]
Inhale! Smell the gunpowder my hands full of residue
Niggas will shoot niggas you lucky it wasn't you
Nigga my best song, my trucks are bomb proof
You shoot I shoot back find God when Im on you (WOOOOOO!!!!!)
This ain't Tales Of The Crypt nigga this tales of the hood
Stay the fuck out the way with your mouth shut like you should
When the bullshit start, Im a find a spot
Aim it right at your knot then the shell cases will drop
Man you niggas dont know me you know my government name
Go head ask about Boo Boo they tell you I let it bang
Got a big reputation theres somethin wrong with my brain
Nigga front Im a squeeze it go head stunt Im squeeze it

[Chorus]
All we do is get that grain, let my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang, Im talkin bout the Unit gang
All we do is get that grain, let my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang, Im talkin bout the Unit gang

[Outro]
