Song:   Wicked Rebel
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bring bring me echo kick down the treble
Watch the bass line come
To bring the wicked rebel
So then me call the Dr. Moor
Who's got the chronic in his right hand
Say when you smoke it down
Boy then you called
Upon the right man

The smoke is clearing and the walls start shaking
What is this now prescription drug
You know that I be taking
He say son you've got to take it
At least 3 times a day
Said if you wanna be quick and livin in the irie way
You've got to pick it up
Before it gets knocked down
You've got to pick it up
Pull the seed straight out from the ground
You've got to pick it up boy before
The one who comes to steal your ganja say
He come up quick behind you
To bring back what he stole
Before you come to found out
That the one wicked man
He control the sound board

Bring bring me echo kick down the treble
Watch the bass line
Come to bring the wicked rebel

The lyrics that make you happy
The lyrics that make you sad
The lyrics that make you feel like
You've lost the love you have
To the man that come before strictly for the line say now
Me don't want no reason to be giving up on the rhyme

Bring bring me echo kick down the treble
Watch the bass line
Come to bring the wicked rebel

Mr. Officer oh no
Say please don't come and go interrogate me no no
Say don't interrogate me no no
But watch out
Me don't want no reason me don't want no rhyme
Me don't want no reason to be givin up on the rhyme
Come give good loving said give loving all the time

Bring bring me echo kick down the treble
Watch the bass line
Come to bring the wicked rebel</pre>
