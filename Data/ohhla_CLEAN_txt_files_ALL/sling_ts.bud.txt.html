[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me

[Chorus 2X: Buddha Monk]
Brooklyn love to sling them stones
Wherever we sling them rap, they get sold
And when we high, all we have to do is
Bust our chrome, well, well, well

[Buddha Monk]
And where we at? Brooklyn, what we do? Get it pumping
Sell those hard things to make my lump margin
So stand back, don't get in my way
Or I'll have to let the AK tear up your frame
It's a serious game, this big dog need to eat, ya'll
Mess wit me, ain't no problem to delete ya'll
I creep up on ya'll, then tie up all of ya'll
Take all your dough, you know I rely on ya'll
And I don't need the projects, I leave that to you cats
Any where else, nigga, you might lose that
Then I push the six, low to the floor
Head out of state, where I can get much more
If you a real thug nigga, you can roll in any slum
Set up shop, and sell that young
But ya'll dumb, ya'll rather sell shit where you from
Have beef wit ya mans, turn heat on ya man
Here's the plan, take six, roll a new land
Me deep and root in, now there's a new sandman
It ain't where you from, it's how you play your hand
Get that cheese, then you get that van, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
Like I said before, I ain't got problems selling raw
Roll wit two grips, and many clips
And I ain't scared of ya'll, shit I just fear for ya'll
That I might have to put one of these things in ya'll
Oops, did I say that, yeah I said that
And it's best for your health, that you don't forget that
I sneak from the back, rat-a-tat-tat
Then creep away like any normal ally cat
Your critics is wack, and let them know that you did that
Now it's a whole bunch his mans, coming to get that
I thought you knew that, bad boys move in silence
Ain't no need for the news nigga to tell that you violent
Look slow down, you wilding, didn't you know it's many miles
To that island, and you won't be smiling
You be dick like a hoe bitch, smacked like a hoe
Rock socks like a hoe, and your name is now hoe
So Duc-Lo, ain't no need for a show
You need that dough, ain't no need for ten folds
Got to roughly go, where no man has gone before
Deliver that raw, then the world is yours, critters

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
