[Intro]
Never be another man it's Mega Man forever
Dude there'll never be another man it's Mega Man favorite

[Random]
I look at my favorite gamin site and what do I see
Capcom pullin the plug on Megaman Legends 3
Now I gotta be honest, I wasn't really sweatin it
But something seems strange, I don't like where it's headin kid
First in line for Marvel Capcom 3
Then I found out that Mega wasn't DLC
All good not a problem, I guess no one would've stopped him
But it seems he's on a slalom headed straight to the bottom
Maybe I was the only kid who had a dream
of a helmet, arm cannon, a metal dog and magnet beam
Imagine me with an overbite
Fillin sketch books with prototypes, then it all changed overnight
Got into girls and I sat the games down
Girls weren't interested, they came back around
Mega Man dropped, I copped every iteration
NES, Genesis, Super NES to PlayStation
Universe had me gassed when I watched the demo
Inafune left, then we got the memo
Ads had us wantin more, interviews, somethin raw
But unfortunately now it's on the cuttin floor

[Chorus]
I'll never forget what you gave to me
Keep walkin the path that you paved for me
I need everyone to see
There'll never be another like you
I'll never forget what you gave to me
Keep walkin the path that you paved for me
I need everyone to see
There'll never be another man it's Mega Man forever - WHAT?!

Look in my mailbox and what do I see
Nintendo Power, issue number 3
And yup~! Mega Man 2 is the cover story
Now I just gotta convince mom to buy it for me
Easy; all I do is keep my room tidy
Do my homework, floss, and brush nightly
Long as I wasn't breakin the rules
I always got the newest toys but couldn't take 'em to school
Then, out of the blue, we took a trip to Clover
Saw Mega man was only 20 bucks, it was over
Wasn't even sure the game was official
Cause on the cover was some lame old dude with a pistol
I took it home and I loved it
Didn't come outside for a week, told my homies I was punished
I remember - the day I entered Dr. Wily's fortress
And I remember - The day I beat the Yellow Devil with the pause trick
Fast forward, got you tatted on my bicep
And when I travel the country I see hundreds just like it
Today they might not know you like we did
But I'ma make sure they feel you - believe it!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Mega Man, known as Rockman or Rokkuman in Japan
is a cybernetic video game character and the protagonist of the Mega Man game series
developed by Capcom since 1987
The pixel art for the character was created by the designer of the original game
and later refined by Keiji Inafune
Since then he has become one of the company's primary characters
and one of the video game industry's most recognizable icons
Mega Man... forever</pre>
