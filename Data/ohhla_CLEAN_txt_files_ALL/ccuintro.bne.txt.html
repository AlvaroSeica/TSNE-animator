[Devilish Voice Backwards]
(Heaven in art which Father Our
Our Father which art in Heaven)
I'm back... Straight of the
muthafuckin' streets of Cleveland
5 true thugs from the Double Glock
Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie, And that nigga Flesh
Ain't takin' know shit in the '94
About to shut this bitch down
Kick that shit, niggas

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
[Bizzy Bone]
East '99 is where you find me slangin' me yayo, daily {*shot*}
[Layzie Bone]
Cleveland is the city where we come from so run, run

[Eazy-E]
Now let's walk through the doors backwards
my thugs...and play with the Ouija board {*laughing*}</pre>
