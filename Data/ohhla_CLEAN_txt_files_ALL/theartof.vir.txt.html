Album:  The Final Conflict
Song:   The Art of Suffering
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

All great art is born of suffering
Tell me what you feel
In what dark, damaged place does it infect you?
Ancestral, primordial pain
That's what my work is all about
Fear and transcending fear
Guts, versus fear
That's really all there is</pre>
