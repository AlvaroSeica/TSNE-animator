[Verse 1]
I done told chicks I loved them
When I didn't really mean it
Sometimes I'm only thinkin'
With the head of my penis
Lotta niggaz preach monogamy
Like they ain't never cheated
Some conceited, the girls do it back
They can't conceive it
Gotta see it to believe it
Deaded from the waist down like a paraplegic
Now she creepin strategic
I just said that to get you mad
Ain't my fault yo girl won't give you ass
Player it's all on you
Maybe if you treated her better
She would call on you
I've been tryin to get my life right
I got a good girl, wants to be a good wife
You know 2.5 kids the white picket fence
Takin' my ass to church, so I could get my head rinsed
But, at the same time, I still be flirtin
I know it's asshole shit, but nobodies perfect

[Chorus]
I know I preach a lot of shit
I apologize I guess I'm just a hypocrite
I guess I'm just a hypocrite
Baby girl, I guess I'm just a hypocrite
I know I'm talkin' that and talking this
But I'm full of shit, I'm just a hypocrite
I guess I'm just a hypocrite
Damn, I guess I'm just a hypocrite

[Verse 2]
Tryin to figure how my guy looks his lady in the eye
Last night he had another lady in his ride
Fuck the same dick that she sucks
The same seat in his truck
Is lust really worth hurtin somebody you trust?
Damn, the Henny does wonders on the sex drive
She remind you of your jeep on the test drive
Mini-me got a mind of it's own
You lookin at ya ID like "God, damn it, I'm Grown"
Cause you only wanna see what the sex about
The genie's in ya pants and you tryin to let him out
But is it worth wastin three years
On one shot and three beers
Knowin she won't be here
Last week you was telling ya man to settle down
Now you playin Tupac, tryin to +Get Around+
That don't add up, that ain't calm down
Now you telling ya self you should just calm down

[Chorus]
But you know that ain't the end of it
Try to practice what you preach
But you's a hypocrite
I said you just a hypocrite
Damn, I guess you just a hypocrite
I hear you talking that and talking this
But you full of shit, you just a hypocrite
I guess you just a hypocrite
Damn, I guess you just a hypocrite

[Verse 3]
This chick told me Black men
Who date white chicks is trifling
I asked her out, she told me she only date white men
I asked her, how many niggaz she ever dated
She said niggaz gay, in jail or intimidated
Unemployed or players just tryin to get her naked
And white men are way more fine and educated
It's like she sees herself in the mirror and she hates it
Almost as bad as the niggaz that she's castigating
So hypocritical it's almost fascinating
She don't realize she the problem exacerbating
That foul is considered a flagrant
Called me next day and retracted her statement
Like I just heard your song on the radio station
And I ain't know you had a Ivy League education
The offer still stands if I could get up in your world
I'm sorry ma, I only date black girls

[Chorus]
Cause you know you preach a lot of shit
You lost out baby girl, cause you's a hypocrite
Baby girl you just a hypocrite
Damn, I guess you just a hypocrite
I hear you talking that and talking this
But you full of shit, you just a hypocrite
Baby girl you just a hypocrite
Damn, I guess you just a hypocrite

I know I preach a lot of shit
I apologize I guess I'm just a hypocrite
I guess I'm just a hypocrite
Baby girl, I guess I'm just a hypocrite
I know I'm talkin' that and talking this
But I'm full of shit, I'm just a hypocrite
I guess I'm just a hypocrite
Damn, I guess I'm just a hypocrite</pre>
