So.. what is all this talk about the 'mark of the beast'?
I just need somebody to explain it to me or show it to me
Is it in Revelations 13?
Is it symbolic or something?
Somebody please, tell me what this is all about

[ CHORUS 2X ]
Mark of the beast (the what?) mark of the beast
Never ever ever get the mark of the beast
The mark of the beast in your hand or your head
Means that you're livin in the land of the dead

[ Vex ]
Man, I been called to confession
Pope wants me to do a session
With this bishop
Pfft - aggravating like the hicups
Or the catholics who passed down the mark from the vicar
Rushin to mass to kiss the feet of a viper
Went to the Tishman Building, what did I see?
Triple 6 in red lights glowin down on me
They want me head on a platter like John the Baptist
Life's surreal like Jacob's Ladder as I map this
Path to travel on to fall on Babylon
Pens and prisons of death, crucified or beheaded
Or sentences for all who lack the mark in the hand or head
If I don't leave the city soon I'm dead, so it's said
Those with the mark snitch on those without
So there's no doubt that they track me on my everyday route
And as the hunger sets in, I realize I can't buy
So I bounce to the wilderness, the all-seeing eye
Can't follow cause I hide in the hollow of holy mountains
Drinking spring water from natural fountains
Eatin berries and fruits, word, herbs and roots
Word, stompin on terrain with my all-terrain boots
Now my lifestyle's changed, but no mark of the beast
And ?as God put they manners? to a cease
I'm to the East, my brother, to the East, my brother
To the East, my brother, to the East
With no mark of the beast

[ CHORUS 2X ]
The mark of the beast (the what?) mark of the beast (the what?)
Never ever ever get the mark of the beast (ohhh..)
Mark of the beast in your hand or your head
Means that you're livin in the land of the dead

[ Mondo ]
Open up your ears to the future and behold something awesome
This might be dangerous, so please proceed with precaution
The night of Christmas we just missed the carol singing
Gift unwrapping now delayed because my door bell is ringing
It was the five-o, screamin, "Freeze, bro, to your knees, no
Talkin, see, this is a national emergency
This is a Sunday, how come you ain't bowin to the Sun, boy?
You got no rights cause you in the middle of the Pope's ploy"
All my life, this what I've studied and been learnin
Now here I stand and my adrenaline is burnin
Off to Arizona in a charter bus
As I look around I see many of us
I pray to God my lady and baby is fine
And in my memory the year is 2009
Check, I see that none of us bow down to the Pope nor his image
Rested on the 7th day, we on our way, arrivin at the concentration camp
Receivin a UPC code for my name and the ????
The media labelled us as heritage's derelicts
?????? as we awaited our death sentence
Now tell me who changed the Sabbath to Sunday if not God?
And who made the day start at midnight, it's not hard
Just do a little diggin so that all confusion cease
And as you knowledge you know the mark who's the beast
Mark of the beast

[ CHORUS 4X ]
Mark of the beast (the what?) mark of the beast (the what?)
Never ever ever get the mark of the beast (ohhh..)
The mark of the beast in your hand or your head
Means that you're livin in the land of the dead

Straight up

[ female voice ]
Ohhh - that's what the mark of the beast is all about
I think I need to go and take some time to research that a little bit more</pre>
