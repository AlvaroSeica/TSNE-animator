[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Number one, all around the world
Yeah, borough to borough, state to state, baby
State to state, country to country, all around
We gon' do it

[Chorus: Madame Dee (Prodigal Sunn)]
Reach out, reach out, reach out, reach out
(I'm all about reaching my people
I'm all about reaching the people) for me
(Through thick and thing, we gon' do it again
And again, and again, and again)

[Prodigal Sunn]
Visualizin' on my block, first floor in my building
Crucial times in the ghettoes, killaz, criminal villains
Seen it for millions, perceivin' the blood spilling
This dude's appealing, black on black crime
Nigga please, please, stop trippin'
Cops splittin', fruit lemon, receivin' gold ribbons
It's all a part of the old system, destroy the rhythm
Toys I give 'em, jewels, I spit 'em, that's how I hit 'em
Expandatory, mandatory, Brooklyn, where you living
To my moms and my pops, aiyo, it's Thanksgiving
Thanks for giving me the mind to overshine prison
I love you all to my lessons, yeah I'm all right
A hell of a fight, we write it and sell it, they write it
That's how the game goes, same ol' shit
Same old click, forget the fame, I did it for my PJ bricks
Yeah, every chance I get, I reach out, let the world know
It's not a game

[Chorus 2X]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, for many reasons, I internet, connect thru legions
Season to season, a sound blast, region to region
Pace my tone, bury my bone, ace on the throne
Section eight grown, the place that we all call home
I shred two tears, before peers, three thousand push ups
Bodies falling in the hood, I calibrate my weight up
The simple rules to the game, baby, the game is trife
Many jewels, fame over life, wrong over right
I take flight like the birds and bees
It's good and evil, when every man
I seen it on, many degrees
Don't get puzzled from the words I spill
I let the truth reveal, necessary like the meat in the meal
Let me tell you what's really real, the dope and the coke
The crills and the pills, devil mental controls sills
I do the knowledge, take it easy, like George and Wheezy
Out in BK, that's where you can reach me

[Chorus 2X]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, this goes worldwide to every man, woman and child
Victims of the system, X-Files, prison exhiles
Due to your trial, environmental guilty and wild
Just keep ya, head up in hell excel, walk with a smile
Preachin' the babies, juveniles bleeding, key to the puzzle
Many got, knocked in the hustle, shot in the struggle
Government scams, poor less, fortunite fams
Got 'em loving, boat by the gram, recorded on cam
Many scram for the cheddar, better things in life
High price ice, it's all on how you scream them dice
A lot of steam broc', white rice, keeps me precise
The magnetic, calastetic, mathematic device
Communicatin' through pay phones, cell phones and land lines
With man kind, American Rap Star, on Showtime
HBO, Sex and the City, I held mine
Money makes the world go round, a gazillion times

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
