Yo, yo FUCK 2DopeBoyz and FUCK NahRight and any other fuck nigga-ass blog
that can't put an 18 year old nigga makin his own fuckin beats
covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake ass cliche jerking
L.A. Slausson rapping fuck nigga-ass HypeBeast niggaz
Now back to the album~!

{Well - Tyler hi, I'm Dr. TC, and um, I'm guessing}
{that your teacher sent you here to talk cause you were misbehaving}
{Um, it's gonna be three sessions, today, tomorrow, Wednesday so}
{just tell me something about yourself}
{Well look, if you don't talk}
{I mean these sessions are going to go slower}

[Tyler, the Creator]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought, this food for death, go ahead and fuckin eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fuckin meet
I cut my wrists and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

[Tyler, the Creator]
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
that I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
are much important I'm gettin angrier while recordin
I'm feelin like the Bulls, I've got a Gang of Wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em!

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Su-spended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil that you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Tyler, the Creator]
I go from A.P. to J.C. inside a fuckin week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitchin about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it
I used to be bullied for honor classes
by those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

[Tyler, the Creator]
Raquel treat me like my father like a fuckin stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
inside my head, telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught
Go to sleep

[Tyler, the Creator]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
"Fuck me" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music's either
a fucking sin or too illegal
Play this shit in church

[Tyler, the Creator]
I graduated without honors or fuckin father
He died {I'm so sorry} no bitch, don't even fuckin bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations
of the fuckin situation that's having our brains racin like
dating, wearin some fucking Heelys

[Tyler, the Creator]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
7, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
than 40 year old rappers talkin 'bout Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressin they peers
with the same problem, the only way to solve them
is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'ma toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
Annd the shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck so it's somethin I inherit...
My mom is all I have so it's never +Meet the Parents+
When Danielle or Milan decide to fuckin share
This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy
I'm bad for you kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it

{Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say}
PUh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating}

[Tyler, the Creator]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
and drippin cold blood like the winter, the summer
os never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fuckin name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggaz wanna know if I'm fuckin, or if I'm kissin
But I'm sittin here downin beers simply just wishin
with a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like, sittin down pissin
18, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma'll attend the
ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my +Zombie Circus+, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's e=mail
so I can tell him how much I fuckin hate him in detail!!!

{Wow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something}
{What would you tell him?}</pre>
