Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hello world
Ain't no friend of ya
So quit with all the smiles I wont bend for ya
I'm walkin' straight better now than ever
I guess I started late now my heart's awake
When did this all begin I guess it's hard to say
All I really know is that something happened inside of me
And it was not my own I was chosen
Now I'm flippin' paper for the prophets
I ain't talking about how my pockets grown
Not the paper with the dead people faces
Talking about them dudes that I read in the pages
Now I'm seeing clear but I ain't got Lasik
Im thinking about my past I never shoulda made it
But God in His grace saw it fit to come and snatch me up
I draw the line in the sand no I ain't backing up
Back in the days I was acting up
You know when communion came your boy had to pass the cup
Pass the bread too sin I was still in
Offering went in the plate my condoms almost fell in
Outside Im feelin' cool inside I'm yelling
Outside lookin' free inside's like a felon
Doing time for rebelling a slave to that sin that I was dwellin' in
Bought the lie they were selling like go, get as many girls as you can
And get it out of your system now so you'll put a rrrrring on that hand
Down the line when your thirty after you had like thirty different women
They so pretty feeling clean  getting dirty
Yuck, now what a lie from the mouth of Satan
Lets use logic for verifying these statements
Well you keep chasing them youll only want more
Sin is never satisfied boy we at war with ourselves
You ever want something so bad it was all you could think about
Yo you had to have it
Then you finally get it you like it for a minute but then your eyes pivot
Now your on to something different we got God-sized longings
Why you try to fill em with them things that you cant take with you in the coffin</pre>
