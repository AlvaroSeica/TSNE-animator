[Hodgy Beats]
You've come a long way - a long way you gotta go
And if you reach the end of the road, a pot of gold
Some people have no pot to, piss nor pot to hold
And I smoke pot by O's my green garden grows
Ashes on my mattress, where's that ash tray shell catcher?
This cloud supreme Cali king ain't cheap, you can ask my sheets
When the +Wolves+ are on the creep, you can count the sheep
And guess who gotta woody fin' to hit Bo Peep
I toy with stories from shorties who come escort me from my limousine
to the demons I see, who breathe the unliving beings
I'm just a living being, living - being - damn!
I'm just a kid that screams that fiends his dreams; yeah
They want to critique me negatively but who really cares
This air and land we share, there's no need to compare
Find peace within yourself and make peace with everyone else
Pick up the phone and call support when in need of some help

Womp (yeah) womp womp (everybody sing along with me) womp womp womp
Womp, womp womp (yeah!) womp womp
Womp, womp womp, womp womp womp
Womp, womp womp

Life is so simple, life is so precious
Life is everything, everything to me
Life is so simple, life is so precious
Life is everything, everything to me
It sounds like the ocean in here, all the commotion in here
Motion is fear, open your ears
Open your ears
Open your ears... nigga </pre>
