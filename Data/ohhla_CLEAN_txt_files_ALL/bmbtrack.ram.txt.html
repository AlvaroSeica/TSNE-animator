[Zack de la Rocha]
UGH!!
Yo, yo it's just another bomb-track
UGH!!
Aiyyo it's just another bomb-track
Yeah!!

It goes a-one, two, three; and it's just another bombtrack
and suckers be thinkin that they can fade this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm in-clined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold runna train on punk, hoes that think they run the game
But I learned to, burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete, at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall and the business-es that burned us all
See through the news and views twist reality -
enough, I call the bluff, for manifest destiny
Landlords or power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn
The thoughts of a militant mind...
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords or power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn!

[Chorus 8X]
BURN, BURN, yes ya gonna BURN!

Goes a-one, two, three; another funky radical bombtrack
started as a sketch in my notebook
But now dope hooks make punks took another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear (fear)
that ya card will get pulled if ya interfere ('terfere)
With the thoughts of a militant mind...
Hardline, hardline after hardline!
Landlords or power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn!

[Chorus 8X]

(RAAAAAAAAHHHH!)

[Guitar solo]
UGH!!
Yo, it's just another bomb-track
UGH!!
Check it out...

[Chorus 8X]

BURN!</pre>
