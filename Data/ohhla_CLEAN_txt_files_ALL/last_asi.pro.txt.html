[Verse 1: Life]
We are disciples
A derivative of discipline
Far from violent and we knew this ever since
Like those that came before us have been
We're teachin' the nation about our black civilization
I'm Life
I grab the mic and commence with a mic check
And proceed to read the tomes and manuscripts
I have nothin' to do with any history
Nor these half-ased facts with any mystery
As a disciple my directive is to be objective and selective
With a few
Or should I say the big picture
Life is my title and my words are like a scripture
From the good book, to take a second look
Knowledge is being restored
Because it was takin' by the crook
Mistook, it was mistaken
Don't be forsesaken by the music Sleek is makin'
Life is my title and it's vital my recital let you know
That I am a Last Asiatic Disciple

"Give me somethin' to dance to" ---&gt; Dr. Dre
"L.A.D."

[Verse 2: B-Wyze]
Knowledge flows coincidin' with wisdom
Ignited inside the path that I'm livin'
Fight for righteous, strike from lows
As I take your mind on a ride past death row
Those that chose to know where I'm comin' from
Music's the rebel, and we're the chosen one
The last to find a place and race
As we unite to fight for peace in every ways
Music we use as a different tool
To teach those that's unaware to stay in school
Whether black or white, once bright comes night
Power for the people
Yeah do that shit right
Black! Caught you lookin' for the same rap
But I'm a different brother of the same color
With a different rhyme and a gifted mind
That was once confined but now is free to climb
And I'ma climb up as high as I can
To prove to you that a black man can
We manifest the best so save that mess
Never gonna lay a black chain on my chest
B-Wyze, I emphasize that you get wise
Fuck the lies, we on the rise not the demise
L-A-D comin' at ya with Professor Griff
It's a myth that when they rift we stand stiff
We brawl hard with the power of God, of course
The L.P. has the Luke Skywalker force
Therefore when it hits, I see dollar signs
Hyper tracks supported by funky rhymes
Tells me that the jams will slam
Then helps you to understand this black man
In the past there was some who claimed the title
But, yo, I am the Last Asiatic Disciple

"What have we got here"
"L.A.D."

[Verse 3: Last Asiatic Disciple]
I'm Asiatic, disciple of those that tried to conquer all
Tried to stop the mass of my wrath
I'll make a path for y'all
Follow me back to where we once were kings
But now there's peace, and to knowledge I bring
I make it simple and plain to where I stand
Reach out my fist and open a palm to a brother man
Now I must go to help disciples of this era
Thank you very much
I'm Obie, the black terror

[Verse 4: Last Asiatic Disciple]
In-fo, what are you waitin' for
Limo, lookin' for a tour of rebels or my demo
Guess the man with an Asiatic plan
That had the strength and heart to listen double or death
With a voice you could not contradict
And if you try you will see a strong outcome to my lecture
Continuously, to wreck and keep shit in check
Live and direct
Bone to milk hot away with the cool effect
I have a plan that makes Mozart simple
Forget Einstein's theory I make ya mind worry
And if not I'll keep on the ?? of math
You will not comprehend till you accept the wrath
And meditation
Ya activated as you waited
For what else I had to say, you would contemplate it
The first on a road to an hourglass
Yo Griff, they be comin' and bombin' from the past
Last time I showed you the roof of stones
Because when they were alive negativity was colder
Imagine
So now I'm older
Bang! I'm an Asiatic ghetto solder
