[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
Who said dead men can't party too, muthafuckas?
Don't ya'll know what this shit is, son?
We taking this shit straight from the muthafucking graveyards to the clubs
Dumb muthafuckas, knowhatimean?
What ya'll know about that shit, son?
D the Dragon, Metatron, Dungeon Masta

[Chorus 4X: D the Dragon]
Blaow! Blown out the frame
Fuck around with the Chambersquad, all you get is blood stains

[Dungeon Masta]
First of all, give me a pound of that shit
Try to find me in a club, homey, you gon' need some foglights
I'm hugged up on a fat ass chick, sniffin' her famo'
Shorty said salutions to the meaty bone Will Wonka
Electrify your pussy hairs like I'm Blanca
Spit hot acid up in your shorty cuz I wanta
Split your melon cap and make your toes curl
Fuck that, you could of had a trip around the world, stupid
I know your type, I dealt wit cats like you all of my life
You lucky I don't split your throat for that crab shit
Listen, ma, you don't know who you fucking with, I try to tell you
I'm not having that bullshit, I try to tell you

[Chorus 4X]

[D the Dragon]
I hate this fucking world, and everything about it
Most rappers today, ain't got no fucking talent
It's the Pisces, and the Scorpio King
We dare profane cats, to jump inside the ring
Meta's throwing daggers, I'm swinging guillotines
With the strength of Superman, and the mind of Stephen King
Ain't nobody fucking around with the Chamber team
Swinging gauges at your neck, for the fucking disrespect
I only hang with Masons cuz they got intellect
I'm only doing business if you fucking cashing checks
A Killa Bee Mason on the square in the west
And if you dying to get rich then I suggest you pack a vest

[Chorus 2X]

[Archangel Metatron]
Boom, ahhh chill, it's just me
The Metatron coming out, killing any MC
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you think you special or something?
Boy, you best to step, cuz when I grab the mic, niggas get wrecked
So many questions, I hear so many questions
Everyday, somebody got a question
What your tattoo mean, what's that around your neck
What are you doing, like what what what -- shut the fuck up!
I don't got time to tame a profane mind
I'm busy, I got to go --- drop a deuce or something
And no, I'm not telling you the Lost Secret
That's why, it's a fucking Lost Secret
It's lost, it's secret, then peep it, you don't get it
It's all good though, cuz, I'm not really frustrated
And I don't give a fuck if you don't know what I'm saying
Metaphysical, metabolic, metatronic bombs
Mastermind, a mechanical masterpiece
From the flames of double headed phoenixes, you love penises

[Chorus 4X]

[Hook 2X: Dungeon Masta]
I heard you like to party, get down, and drink Henny
Pour me some, Courvosier, Remy
Christian Brothers, kind of be, I shall agree
And if you drink, it doesn't matter, more for me

[Outro: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Ya'll muthafuckas really really thought you was smart
Ya'll must be fucking stupid, ya'll muthafucking cornball ass muthafuckas
It's another G-Clef Da Mad Komposa production, I ain't going no muthafucking where
Bitch ass niggas</pre>
