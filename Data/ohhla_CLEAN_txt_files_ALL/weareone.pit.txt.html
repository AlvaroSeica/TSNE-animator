Mr. Worldwide
It's only right we did something for the World Cup
Seven continents, 195 countries
Give it take three, but one world

I've been around the world
Never seen so many things
Even though we may be different
We're really all the same

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Oe oe oe oh la
Oe oe oe oh la
Oe oe oe oh la

When the moment gets tough
You've got keep going
One love, one life, one world
One fight, whole world, one night, one place
Brazil, everybody put your flags in the sky and do what you feel

It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play

Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros
Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros

Put your flags up in the sky
(Put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)
Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Oe oe oe oh la
Oe oe oe oh la
Oe oe oe oh la

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Oe oe oe oh la
Oe oe oe oh la
Oe oe oe oh la</pre>
