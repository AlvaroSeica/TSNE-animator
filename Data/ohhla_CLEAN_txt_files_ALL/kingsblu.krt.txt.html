[Chorus]
I got no time to waste, I got more bills to pay
I got more mouths to feed now, now, now
I got no time to play, I got no need to stay
when ain't no money around, round, round
What's a King without a crown?
"Time's a wastin'" - {Erykah Badu}
What's a car without some sound?
"Don't you take your time, young man" - {Erykah Badu}

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Never been on that silly sucker shit, ride around pimped out, fo' doors
with a woodgrain dashboard, and a rim that sits swoll'
And the embroidered headrest, yeah that be dead fresh
In your ear like headsets, sleepy eye, forever grind, no bed rest
I can't depend on that next check cause it ain't vouched, shit
The type of broke that got me searching through my momma's couch
for some loose change, they got that dollar menu
McDouble and small fries, lemonade and sweet tea blended
Now here it is Monday, but will it get me through till Wednesday?
Will it kill them hunger pains, even though it ain't fulfilling?
I make do with what God give me, and I take it day by day
I would come around more often, but I can't stay, cause

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Try not to step on my toes with yo' swoll' bankrolls, you blowing dough
on stripper pole pros you barely know, make it rain
If I was paid with no knowledge and two months late on my mortgage
in a hood that ain't safe, I'd do the same thang
But wishful thinking ain't shit without genies
I can't define how I feel, that's why I'm searching for meaning
No need to pinch me in my players' suite, I know when I'm dreaming
My momma tell me be careful cause she know when I'm scheming
Lottery winners don't run in my family, nor do seven dots when dice are swang
No sense in me gambling, we just crap out
Maybe they would listen to me if I pulled the strap out
like give me everything or I'ma black out, cause
