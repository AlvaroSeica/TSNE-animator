[ Skee-Lo ]
the other day I was cruisin' the shaw I seen Jay
the big homey from Oakland runs the bay
I used to be in love wit his sister back in the day
had to holler at him see what he had to say
it's good to see him now and know that he's ok
he asked how I was doin' and then proceeded to say
what happened to the record, what's up wit the air-play
politics too many haters is in the way
it's ok now but really it's no excuse
I can tell you how it all went down but what's the use
it's a lot of people walkin' around wit there tounges loose
and I don't care what nobody tell you I got juice
takin' it day by day, do or die
hustlin', imagine this game wit I
did you think I would just lay back and not try
I'ma bounce back, get on my feet, get on my hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
if you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
it depends on how much in this life you wanna see
and to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo ]
do the math focus and stay on the right path
forget about the busters and snitches that all laugh
you know people when they see money they wanna grab
greed, how much money you wanna have
stay away from criminal act and crack labs
quick money ain't no money it turns bad
trust god make him the only friend you have
instead of short brothers wit tempers that get mad
whenever there's somebody that's tryin' to limit you tho'
downin' you tellin' you places you can't go
you got to have faith in yourself you gotta show
their opinions really ain't worth nothing they don't know
it's a whole lotta player involved you ain't seen
that ain't been half the places that you been
I'm tellin' you all you brothers that want cream
bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
if you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
it depends on how much in this life you wanna see
and to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo ]
will you go to the top, will you settle for crumbs
I hope you ain't none of these brothers that act dumb
never learned to chill and relax and have fun
steady livin' life in the shade wit no sun
you got to learn to deal wit your problems you can't run
how you gonna ever advance to number one
and settle for number two that's something I can't feel
got bein' broke mixed up wit bein' real
keep it real brothers, stay on your feet, get on your hustle
if you can do it without force use muscle
walk soft carry a stick ready to tussle
your friends really ain't your friends and don't trust you
wait for the day that you fall and hope and pray
you probably owe some of them money and can't pay
and you wanna know what I do think what do I say
bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
if you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
it depends on how much in this life you wanna see
and to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man</pre>
