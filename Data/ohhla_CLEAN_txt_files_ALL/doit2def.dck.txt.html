[Inspectah Deck]
I'm like D. Wade steppin to Dirk
I'll bring heat to ya Mavericks
Back down, Your headed for hurt
I broad day, Put your rep in the dirt
Boy aint fuckin with an expert
I don't need a weapon the murk
Charlie Horse put pressure to church
Investigators couldn't question my work
Die hard for my section of turf
Aint a scale built to measure my worth
Apparently it's destined that I'm legend from birth
Until I leave here stretched in a hearse
You'll remember my name, Like I sniped the President from the church
I'm a warrior, I weathered the worst
Still reppin with thirst
That's why the projects echo my verse
Who's next to be left in the dirt
While you checkin my steps I'm steppin in fly sweaters and shirts
With the full length leathers and furs
It's beretta or worse
The wars on I'll never dessert
I'm in the trench where the metal'll burst
With the medicine works, The Vendetta
Better get to him first
Small timer, Only rep for a spurt
I was questin the Earth
Gettin gwap plus the pleasures and perks
Wanna see me, Check the lens and observe
Twenty four-sev reppin the curb
So when you mention the word it's on

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
How we gone do it, Do it to def
How we gone do it, Do it to def
Deep in the pits big guns and clips
It's goin down, Then I'm down, Hold down the strip
Yo, How we gone do it, Do it to def
How we gone do it, Do it to def</pre>
