[Da Brat]
Guess who's back in the mutherfuckin' house
With two big tiggle bitties for your mouth
Heartbreakers must partake in the sensation
So So Def and Clue, hits in the making

[Missy]
Oh, guess who's driving the five double O
Like Yipi-Yi Yipi-Yo, yeah
When I talk smack y'all better skip back
Like here we go, cause the bitch don't play

[Mariah]
Oh your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist at all

1-	[Mariah]
        Boy if I do
        The things you want me to
        The way I used to do
        Would you love me baby?
        Or leaving me feeling used
        Would you go and break my heart?

2-	[Mariah]
	Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
	But I just keep coming back incessantly
        Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
        I should of known right from the start
        You'd go and break my heart

3-	I need someone to give me some real love
	I need someone to give me some real love
	I need someone to give me some real love
	I need someone to give me some real love

[Mariah]
Why, when I met you that night, baby
I didn't know it wouldn't last
I gave my love till you hurt me
Which I've been taking over

See I have never met a guy
And I was withdrawn into the lies
(Should've know you'd break my heart)

[Da Brat]
Come on, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, come on, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Come on

Well if the Brat gave a fuck about a nigga
My heart would be broke
Should've know you were star struck
When I left your stroke
My guards was up in the beginning
But then I gave you my heart and you broke it again
I'm a fool when you smile at me I'm convinced
I gets caught up in you and I just can't resist
I know you lie to me, it just drive me nuts
That one kiss could persuade me to believe your bluffs
You set it up and impressed me with pimps and rings
I wish love was dollars cuz, shit, Money Ain't a Thang
Cause Clueminati and MC move the party
I got a heater ready to blaze somebody
It's that dummy you, it's that for each member of my crew
In fact, I'mma heartbreak you
Lay you flat on your back
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust me yo

[Missy]
Yo, yo
Baby (Uh huh)
I'm the real thing (One, two)
So why you got me sweating you consistently, baby (One, two)
Baby, I got that good thing (Uh)
So while you're making love to me you crazy baby
(Oh!)

[Missy]
I like the way he used to spank me
He used to lie me on my back take that! (Uh)
He used to have me in the sack, legs back
But now he been buggin' lately
Hey boy why you actin' stinky? (Uh huh)
I keep ya stiff like wood, baby (Baby)
So if you wanna keep a good lady
You need to stop with all the heartbreaking

Repeat 2

Repeat 2 &amp; 3</pre>
