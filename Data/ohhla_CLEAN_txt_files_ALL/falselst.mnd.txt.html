Organized religion is false
And anyone that follows it is lost  (yeah, I said it)

Fuck Catholicism, I'll save you all from this prison
Christianity only exists within insanity
As I purch in a Saturday stance
Eliminating the Church of Latter Day Saints
Episcopalian, and I'm a distant alien
And listen as I whisk you away again
I'm determined to put an end to your sermon
Permanently burning all the vermin
These Institutes love to prostitute all of the destitutes
And that's the truth
A wafer doesn't make me feel safer
Jerry Falwell is a scary tall tale
Tell Reggie White I'm feeling edgy and uptight
Legendarily, sacrilegiously I'll write
All bibles should be liable
And thus tie-able to the tribal
Reading psalms is not like feeding throngs
It's like kneeding tongs over bleeding palms
I hope you don't take this strong
I love you, but you're wrong

Organized religion is false
And anyone that follows it is lost  (yeah, I said it)

God, you know that I'm your passenger
Eliminate the masquerading messengers
All these apostles are not colossal
Lost and hostile Pentecostals
I'm not saying that your faith is an impostor
You've been bossed into the wrong roster
Matthew and Luke are just people's names
Feeble veins versus old deep gains
There's no way in the world that the bible is the manual for life
Annually handing humanity the knife
Watch'em be hung on the neck by a rope
They're brainwashing the brand new pope

Organized religion is false
And anyone that follows it is lost (yeah, I said it)

Our slaughter who parts the heavens
Don't follow the insane
Thy will get done by the Sungodsuns
Take your worth to the so-called heaven

God, I'm waiting... tampering with greatness
I am pampering your lateness
Camper me from the hateness
Completely damp and yet weightless
Add another watercolor to the watercooler
Add another mother daughter to the father sooner
Watch the faithful balance
A hundred different ways all at once in silence
As I time travel, my mind is a blind gavel
For your --?-- gravel
This is an excercize in sacrilegious babble
For your unconscious to unravel
Religion was born to be material
We have been torn from our imperial
Destiny, brought to you in stereo
Excommunication is a miracle</pre>
