[Frank Ocean]
Yeah
I'm hitchhiking love
Could you take me to the hills
I'm not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try

[Chorus 1]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see
but just you and me, ohhhhhh
I'm spendin too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus 2]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it, it ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Frank Ocean]
Oh I really ought to ask
If I need a parachute or somethin
Cause if you take me way up there
I'll be scared to death of fallin

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]</pre>
