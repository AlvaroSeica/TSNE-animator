Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Have you never heard a sound like this before?
Black, still phat, and you want some more?

I said that c-c-can't be her's
All that bottom b-b-bottom
Then again, it might be hers
u-up top and get my dollars fo' sure
Then I meet my mama let's go
Think about this girl all 24
My mind, her whistle she blow
Make me wanna l-lick her below
I talk about her, shawty fly
I w-wanna be the pilot
Perfect girl, ...
And I can't keep silent
Tell my brother, my ex-lover
all my homies and my uncle damn
There she is, I'mma be quiet
Listen

Even got me talkin' bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on

I-I can feel her love
She's a model, super model
I know
Look at that-that strut
That Coco bottle, b-b-ottle
Hello
Just know
Shawty on point like, elbow
We can flip a coin and I want both
Her, head, her tails
I'm obsessed with this female
And her chest like, oh, jewels
She's so .. mm-mm she smells
..I almost cuss
This girl make me wanna fu- I mean cut
Action totally, it's some attraction
Mm! There she go again1
C'mere girl! I even be talkin' to myself!

Even got me talkin' bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on

So fine, you're the one (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on
So fine, you're the one (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on
So fine, you're the one (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on
Got me goin' on and on
On and on and on and on

Even got me talkin' bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on</pre>
