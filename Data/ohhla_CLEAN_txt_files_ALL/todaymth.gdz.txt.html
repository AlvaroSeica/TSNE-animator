[Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
Yo! Gravediggaz (yeah)
Yo! Y'all know what time it is (Gatekeeper, Grym Reaper)
Diggin up another plot (yo)
Dumb deaf and blind niggaz out here
Tryin to shine, yo, yo

Uhh, who give a fuck about a cop
when they move through the Brooklyn blocks lickin a shot
Where the hardrocks at, and the super thug killers?
If it ain't revolution then FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAZ
You talk about heatin up, blocks and streets
But your blocks go to sleep for the cops and beasts
Aiyyo, if I gotta see another black momma cry
Tony T.I.(?), I bring fuckin drama 'til I die
If y'all ain't ready, to walk that walk
Don't talk that talk cause I, live in New York
Where the Mayor, condones the outline in chalk
And the big blue gang stalks and bangs your corpse
And forced like American rebels into a rage
To force back Samaritan devils into a cage!
I'm the New World Order
The voice of electric currents of manslaughter
Unhand my daughters
and sons all Babylon, you're gonna hate me
Worser than Farrakhan even when I'm gone
My words carry on, my herds respond
Freedom is the road that my peeps travel on
My rap verse attacks first in from the black hearse
The wicked and weak, hurtin my peeps is gonna catch worse
No justice, no peace
It's just us kids in the streets goin to war with beasts

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Peace God, what's today's mathematics?
The Gods wreak havoc on the weak wicked and savage
Leave 'em in a panic, then take advantage
in the two-triple-oh, we knock 'em off the PLANET!

[Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper]
Peace to the Gods, yo
Seekin inner sanctions, I don't tangle with Satan
Couldn't cross with what, navigations
Original hypocrites turned Digital, access pivotal
Metaphysical state, you can't relate
Where each drop of water, symbolic to atomic slaughter
of Aurora comets, pay homage
I seek prominence, chop heads off devils
Remain dominant, blackness my practice of tolerance
Guided through a tower of scholars, mind equal in power
Collisions brought about, tactical violence
Simplistic, warriorlistic type knights
that existed, in a crucifix, that's twisted
Hex cursed upon the X, but I respond
In six sects, (?) intense foe bein four hundred million shoguns
Plus inside my dungeon for a psychiatric spongin
Foolish intrusion thumps in brain transfusions, I'm born true eyed
At this moment, while my opponents are what? Terrified

[Chorus]

[Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper]
Fuckin devils are evil
The hunger and pain in the father's plane of regents
I pledge allegiance
Swore to defend Allah's universal revenge
Conceal secrecy
The emblem of justice placed above the head frequencies
Shaped in forms with dark matter
Usin ultra gamma rays to shatter they stagment
Broke your compounds to fragments
Induced the science of hypnosis
Causin they mind to combine summer solstice

[Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
As my soldiers set to fire, to Boogie Down, Brooklyn, and Queens
is bein sprayed with green pesticides
But we the only pest that dies
Not the roaches, mosquitoes, the rats or the FLIES!
That's just a lie to cover
Until the cops hover over the city to make people of color just SUFFER!
I pity the unprepared
Who ain't tryin to hear what I'm kickin in his ear
We all aware cash rules
But some are unaware where and when to blast tools
When to act cool
Cause when you pursue beef on the street corner
Beasts bring the heat like a deep sauna
So I keep on a, glorious path in some water
Blessed with the warrior's wrath!

[Chorus]</pre>
