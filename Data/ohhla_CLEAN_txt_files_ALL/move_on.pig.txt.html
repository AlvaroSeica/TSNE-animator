[Intro] [Pigeon John]
Oh yeah, you know it's real
Fools don't eat, you know what to do
I do this ev-ery day
I do this ev-ery way
Oh boy, you know it's nice
Cinnamon rice, you know it's tight
My name is John and I'm gonna sing
My little song, my niggas sing

La la la la la
La la la la la
All my hard knuckleheads why don't you sing with my song
La la la la la
La la la la la
Ya gotta say
All you hard knuckleheads sing with my song
And it goes...

[Verse One] [Pigeon John]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait (wait)
I'm movin' on impressin', and to fill my fate
Switchin' the plate, tryin' to make things accumulate
Sittin' on papes, about 38, take a break

[Joey the Jerk]
I'ma speak to my seven riddles
Because I can't figure it out
I need a sixty second solution
Absent of doubt
Reading 0.00 in my savings account
Sewing seeds of success and can't anticipate drought

[Flynn Atkins]
Ayo I gotta think bigger for where I'm actually at
My mind state's my rate of keeping it on track
My destiny's in my hands can't look back
Just learn from mistakes and make the greenbacks

[Joey the Jerk]
Can you conceive a curse
Where your best becomes your worst?
You best to stay alert because it happens and it hurts
That's why Slurp puts in work for the Paramount jerks
And with my five T-Shirts Sunday mornings at church

[Chorus] [Pigeon John] [w/ various ad-libs]
Move on
Move on
Move on
All my people around the planet Earth c'mon and
Move on
You got's to move on
Move on
All my people planet Earth c'mon

[Verse Two] [Flynn]
She pierced her lip
Started to strip
Lost ten pounds and it made me sick
Ayo I loved her to death but death had its grips
Tightly clenched on her life and I flipped
I didn't understand why she still ran
From all the love embracing, gracing God's plans
For her life, I wanted the best
To be my wife, I wanted a "Yes"
But you're a lady of integrity, idle man

[Pigeon John]
See all I need is my Ferrari
And a little money they can never "Sorry"
But I don't care if I'm broke as long as we can joke
Drinkin' some Coke in CookBook's garage see
What's gonna last?
Brothers we gotta think fast
As we watch time as it passes
Look at the masses
See we just sheep tryin' to feed as we bleed slow like molasses

[Chorus] [Pigeon John] [w/ various ad-libs]
Move on
Move on
Move on
All my people around the planet Earth c'mon and
Move on
You got's to move on
Move on
All my people planet Earth c'mon

[Bridge]
Everybody c'mon
Ahh, put your hands up
Ahh, you know how we do it over here
Ahh, put your hands up
Ahh, you know how we do it last year
Ahh, put your hands up
Ahh, you know how we do it barbecue
Ahh, put your hands up
Ahh, you know how we bring 

[Verse Three] [Joey the Jerk]
I find an easy way
Sooner or later work hard
I assume percentages don't apply to those of God
Feel like foreman of the job still I feel I'm being robbed
Cause to me I'm Michael Jordan on the squad playing against Rod, ? and Duane
Got no shame, wait for fame
I see my destination and through sleet, snow and rain
I'ma maintain
Still remain on chain gang
Tryin' to stay sane
Earning minimum gain

[Pigeon John]
I wanna tour with Kenny G and make some hits
And blow the money on some fresh new kicks
I also wanna live alone
And paint myself black
And hang where the actors act

[Flynn]
Ayo my name is on the line I don't take no for an answer
Success is in my sights and I'll take more than a gander
Arouse, I'll arouse and possess what I claim
Superstar status in the name of Yahweh

[Chorus] [Pigeon John] [w/ various ad-libs]
Move on
Move on
Move on
All my people around the planet Earth c'mon and
Move on
You got's to move on
Move on
All my people planet Earth c'mon
Move on [echo]</pre>
