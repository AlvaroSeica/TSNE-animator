[Intro]
Back, back, backstabber {*3X*}

[Ke$ha]
Bored, stoned
Sittin in your basement all, alone
Cause your little conversation's got, around
And lookie what we all found out (lookie what we found)
Lookie here we all found out
that you, have got a set of loose lips
Twis-ting stor-ies all because you're jealous
Now, I know, exactly what you're all about (what you're all about)
And this is what you're all about

[Chorus]
Girl, you're such a backstabber {*2X*}
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it
Girl, you're such a backstabber {*2X*}
Run your mouth more than anyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it

[Interlude]
Back, back, backstabber
Talk {*8X*}

[Ke$ha]
I'm sick, and tired, of hear-ing all about my life
From oth-er peo-ple with all of your lies
Wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should
shut your mouth (shut your mouth) you never shut your mouth
Hon-estly, I think it's kinda funny that
You waste, your breath, talkin about me
Got me feelin kinda special really
This is what you're all about

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
Katie to my left, just rippin my style and damn
Jeanie why you gotta tell the secrets 'bout my sex life?
All I ever did was drive your broke ass around
Pick you up, take you out, when your car broke down
Back, back, backstabber
Stabber, stabber
Back, back, backstabber

[Chorus] - first half only

[Ke$ha]
Girl, you're such a backstabber
Taking and twisting it down you're so manipulating
Run your mouth more than anyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it
Talk, talk, talk - back, back, backstabber
Taking and twisting it down you're so manipulating
Oh girl, talk, talk, you're lookin like a lunatic
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it

Everybody knows... yeah
You're lookin like a lunatic
And everybody knows... yeah
Everybody knows</pre>
