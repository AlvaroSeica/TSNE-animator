[Crooked I]
No sleep gang, insomnia gang
We out here traffickin, that mean I'ma find me a lane
You wanna be celebrities, you remind me of lames
But I got bars, when I'm through sellin these, I'ma buy me some fame
All-all a-bout that moola, holla
I'm a Rottweiler with an iced-out collar
Prada, frames, Long Beach top shotta
I don't count on niggaz but I might count dollars
I don't count on hoes but I might count dollars
I don't count on haters but I might count..
Bottles in the V.I.P., when the club turn the lights out
I'm on the white couch yellin out
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang
O.G. mayne, how the dope fiends came
Get 'em so hooked call it dope T-Pain
Cardo on the beat, then it's no keychain
Push to start, then I crook to park
Seats vibrate when the dope beat bang
Drank the sip, nigga kush to spark, uh

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang
Bang bang bang nigga no sleep gang
Fuck sleep, get that money my nigga
Fuck sleep, g-g-get that money my nigga
Fuck sleep, get that money my nigga
Fuck sleep, g-g-get that money my nigga
Fuck sleep, get that money my nigga
Smoke in the club, roll that up
Drank in the club, po' that up
Haters in the club, so damn what?
If it don't make money then it don't add up
No sleep gang, throw that up
No sleep gang, throw that up
No sleep gang, throw that up
If it don't make money then it don't add up (turn up!)
House in the hills, thousands and mil's
Gettin wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel
to count dollar bills, to count dollar bills
House in the hills, thousands and mil's
Gettin wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel
to count dollar bills, to count dollar bills

[Crooked I]
No-no sleep gang, in-insomnia gang
Raised by some +O-Dogs+, that's why I polly with +Caine+
They pushed +Roc+ in the 90's, they remind me of Dame
Hundred on the +Dash+, Jordan's on the gas
Pull the top back while I'm slidin through the lanes
Yellin bang bang bang, no sleep gang
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang
Do-si-do with a hoe he claim
In the low-key mode 'bout to throw me brain
And I know she know, chain and the cross
C.O.B., I'm the COB gang boss
Bitch threw molly in her own champagne
This time around y'all can't blame Ross
Momma, told me, I couldn't behave
To that, dollar, was Crooked a slave
Now I'm, a master, fly right past ya
Louis Vuitton sneakers one foot in the grave
But before I die let me tell you this
I'ma ball on you niggaz, I can tell you're pissed
Talk about I kept your wife out all night
N-n-n-nigga don't tell me, homie tell your bitch
She rep

[Chorus]

[Outro: Crooked I]
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang (gang, gang)
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang (gang, gang)
Bang bang bang, no sleep gang (gang, gang)
Bang, bang, b-bang, b-bang, b-bang, no sleep gang</pre>
