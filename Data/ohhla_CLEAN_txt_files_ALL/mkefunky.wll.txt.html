[will.i.am - repeat 2X]
Make it funky for me {*repeat 3X*}
(Dee-jayyyy~!)

She said she said she...
Move it in, check it out, move it in, check it out
Move it... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-it's-it's

[will.i.am]
It's the funk that make you jump, sexy honies shake they hump
Got them dummies spendin money just to get up in yo' junk
Buy you drinks up at the bar, fill you up with alcohol
Why me, boo you, try to do you, even walk you to yo' car
You don't want what's goin down, you freak them to the sound
The bass was steady poundin, you dropped it to the ground
Hypnotized by the (dee-jayyy) when he select the beat
Steady rockin on a (weekday) heavy on repeat
So put 'em up, put 'em up, drop it down, to the ground
Back it up, back it up, somebody ask the (dee-jayyy)

[Chorus]
Could you make it funky for me
Can you make it funky for me {*2X*}
Can you make the (dee-jayyyy!)
Can you make it funky for me {*2X*}
Could you make it funky for me
Could I ask the (dee-jayyyy!)
I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel alright {*2X*}

[will.i.am]
Reach for somethin really high, go ahead and touch the sky
Ain't no limit when you in it, live it up cause it's yo' life
Any minute we gon' spend it like the {shit} never gets spun
Oh yeah this {shit} just begun, and we came to have FUN~!
Put away your guns, ladies keep shakin your buns
Some-body grab some-body party 'til the sun come up
And we ain't stoppin, I don't care if 20 cops come in
Let 'em keep knockin and knockin, we keep on rockin
So put 'em up, put 'em up, drop it down, to the ground
Back it up, back it up, somebody ask the (dee-jayyy)

[Chorus]

[will.i.am]
I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel alright
I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel al.. al... al... {*echoes*}

Yo, yo, hey
You like the beat {*4X*}
Go ahead girl rock it to the beat {*2X*}
Yo
You like the track {*4X*}
Go ahead girl shake it like that {*2X*}
You like the sound {*4X*}
Go ahead girl move it all around {*2X*}

[repeat 3X]

(Go 'head boy rock my body! Go 'head boy rock my body!)</pre>
