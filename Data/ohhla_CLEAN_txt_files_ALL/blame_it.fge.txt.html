Song:   Blame It On the Sun
Typed by: firstlinerhyme@gmail.com

Refugees up in here
Booga Basement style
On a John Peel show
Giving you a little reggae, a little R&amp;B, a little hip-hop
Stevie Wonder style, you know how we do

Where has my love gone
How can I go on
Is peace not here for me to see

Where is my spirit
See I'm nowhere near it
It seems dear love is gone away

[Refrain]
So I blame it on the sun, the sun that didn't shine
I blame it on the wind and the trees
I blame it on the nights I never was in love
I blame it on the times that could not be
But my heart blames it on me

You see I loved hard once, but the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I died for, he wasn't even concerned
In time he turned, he tried to burn me like a perm
But my eyes saw the deception my heart wouldn't let me learn from
Some dumb woman was I and every time he lied he would cry and inside I'd die
My heart must've died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left, he stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops that type of heat they can't arrest
Pain suppressed will lead to cardic arrest
Diamonds deserved, diamonds but he convinced me I was worthless

Wish I could tell you what I am feeling
But words won't come for me to see
Who poured the love out
What made this bitter doubt
Is peace not here for me to see

[Refrain]

Who poured the love out
What made this bitter doubt
Who poured the love out

Yo yo see cool it down, emcee's should slow it down
Ohh, watch out, before they lose control
Yo yo see cool it down, emcee's should slow it down
Ohh, watch out, Fugees is on a roll

We just looking for the love today
Where's the love at
All the peace emcee's settle the violence
Play more music, make more phat beats
Leave all the violence some place else

Where is the love
Say where is the love
Where is the love [x5]</pre>
