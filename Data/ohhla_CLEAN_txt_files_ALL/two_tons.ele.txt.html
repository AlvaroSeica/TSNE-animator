[Mr. Voodo]
Natural Elements, the name of this topic
You should pay close attention how we rock it
When we drop the album and single, you should cop it

[A Butta]
Yo Voo, stash that, L hit em wit 2 Tons

[L-Swift]
Yo, first and foremost
Natural Elements serve a raw dose
You ain't hear the first time, so I return wit more dope
And I just burned some raw smoke, Voo else wit a ?a-sand?
Like a life-size statue of Elvis in Graceland
The fucker of jakes, they rush the gates
But all they find in my pocket was two dutchies, a razor blade, and some 
duct-tape
So if you're lookin for a cut face and broken jaw
Make you feel like you was locked upstate, and close the door

[Mr. Voodo]
Pope John Paul, I bless ill figures (reputedly)
Dons fall when I caress steel triggers (rufusly)
Anonymously, toss shots wit an ominous force night
Not know two MC's, draw guns wit two's a piece
Your whore's is chossin me, rap wars is losin me, a true MC
My influence be showing and fluently

[A Butta]
True indeed, I flows by properly hop
Go-go's coppin your spot
Yo whatever we drop, you know it's gotta be hot
Blazin, Raisin Hell like Run-DMC 
Sprayin shells till my gun be empty
I heard you want it kid, don't wait to tell, come and get me
Save your hit for A&amp;R men
On drums and SP's, and ACE R-10's
Former friend, you can choose one of the two
But think quick before I bruise you in front of your crew
Oh that's your man? Well I'm sunnin him too
Nuttin to lose, Thelma and who?
Kick in your grill, blood on my shoes
Lyrics is ill, my click chill, while we guzzlin brew
Flip it Swift (fuck you want me to do?) it's on you

[L-Swift]
Police is huntin for Voo
Respond too, yo it's a Elements world
Elegant words make my legend unfurl
Even melons get bust, hold up nigga several of us
Niggas is jealous as fuck, yo got my metal to bust
Yo tell em what up
(Nah kid, I might touch up the flow)
You freeze like, you was stuck in the snow, duckin the po'

[Mr. Voodo]
What do you know, feet double-O
Bring the apocalypse, the ?accostra? chicks
Hold your babies as hostages
You want hydrogens and oxygens, here's a large dose
Born-again thug like Carlos
Y'all know the stimulants, inhalin reefer dark ? ?
Over the earth set, trick Jahovah for turf
I'm the ?defairiest?, clap straps and give brothas out of body experience
See we be N-E, we ne-gate the red tape
In the 2 Ton, no one shall ecsape
(So pick a def date, and things get set straight)

[Chorus]
"Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh" 4x
Most of y'all know what shit is exactly about word
"Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh" 4x
Always and forver, Natural Elements no doubt

[L-S] I lost my money on the Knicks
[A-B] I got honeys on the tips
[MrV] I got Rummy on the twist
[L-S] Aiyyo run me on the spin

[A Butta]
My click is heavy-handed
Something ferocious, fuckin toasters
One of the dopest so, but don't approach this
You want dope? I'll over-dose this
Propose a toast to candle, the king of smokin roaches
Guns and roses, some say my flows comes from Moses
Puff a whole spliff and let the smoke circulate
Deep throat my flow till you choke, hoe regurgitate
Y'all jokers don't flow, y'all impersonate
Me and my click, you wanna plead the Fifth?
Open your eyes and read my lips, yo the beef is thick
Heat an ?instant?, must be the sickle if you can see wit this grip
My click flow will make you flee the district

[Mr. Voodo]
You see this biscuit, I love this biscuit
Charlemagne shoved the disc in
Ain't a sample for me to construct the sickness
The product, the quick hit
Crazy cash, cheese like Stacey Dash
DE's tryin to trace the stash
We steady lace the hash
Up in spots large as Macy's bash, triple ?stake?
But anyway, I treat women like I'm Henry VIII

[L-Swift]
Yo, I could never envy a fake, all I could do is rock on
You can reach me at, Natural Elements.com
Log on yo, I do this for the illest in prison
I'm seein both sides of the game like peripheal vision
Shit you think about, I figure in my quickest decision
It's like I always play the game from a different position
Wit The Charlemagne, I'm playin both sides of the fence
I spoke in my defense, I stay wit low eyes when I'm bent
Yo when, I say N-E I mean Northeast too
Bronx county, Trump found me and he brought me through
Support me too, word up 2 Ton, word up

Chorus *replace "shit" w/ "this"</pre>
