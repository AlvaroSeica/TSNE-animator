Song:   Letter From God to Man
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is a letter, from God to Man, it says:

Hey There, how, how's it going?
Long time no see
I know I haven't been around much lately
But... it didn't seem like you wanted me to be
The last time I sent down a message you nailed it to the cross
So I figured I'd just leave you to it, let you be your own boss

But I've been keeping an eye on you, I have, and it's amazing how you've grown
With your technological advances and the problems you've overthrown
And all the beautiful art you've created with such grace and such finesse
But I admit there are a few things I'm afraid have impressed me less

So I'm writing to apologize for all the horrors committed in my name
Although that was never what I intended, I feel I should take my share of the blame
All the good I tried to do was corrupted when all the religion got into full swing
What I thought were quite clear messages were taken to unusual extremes
My teachings taken out of context to meet the agendas of others
Interpretations taken to many different ways and hidden meanings discovered

Religion became a tool, for the weak to control the strong
With all these new morals and ethics, survival of the fittest was gone
No longer could the biggest man simply take whatever he needed
'Cause damnation was the price if certain rules were not heeded

Some of the deeds committed in my name just made me wonder were I went wrong
Back at the start when I created this, the foundation seemed so strong
See all the elements were already here, long before I began, I just kind of put it all together
I didn't really think out a long-term plan

I made the sun an appropriate distance and laid the stars across the sky
So you could navigate the globe or simply watch the sun rise
I covered the earth with plants and fruits
Some for sustenance and some for beauty
I made the sun shine and the clouds rain so their maintenance wasn't your duty
I tried to give each creature its own attributes without making them enveloped
I gave you all you all your own space to grow and in your own way space to develop

I didn't know such development would cause rifts and jealousy
Cause you to war against each other and leave marks on this planet indelibly
You see, I wasn't really the creator, I was just the curator of nature
I want to get something straight with homosexuals right now: I don't hate ya
I was a simple being that happened to be the first to wield such powers
I just laid the ground, it was you that built the towers

It was you that invented bombs, and the fear that comes with them
And it was you that invented money, and the corrupt economic systems
You invented terms like just-war and terms like friendly fire
And it was you that didn't know when to stop digging deeper, when to stop building higher
It was you that exhausted the resources I carefully laid out on this earth
And it was you that even saw these problems coming but accredited them little worth
It was you that used my teachings for your own personal gain
And it was you that committed such tragedies, even though they were in my name

So I apologize for any mistakes I made, and when my words misconstrued
But this apology's to mother nature, cause I created YOU</pre>
