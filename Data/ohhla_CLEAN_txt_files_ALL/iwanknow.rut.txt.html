Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Apocalipps (Beno)]
Ma, I wanna know what's up (all my dirty dirty south bitches)
All I wanna do is fuck (all my inner city bitches where ya at?)
I ain't trynna spend a buck (all my high class bitches)
All I got to get is this nut

[Apocalipps]
Lipps ain't paying for nothing these days
All ya freaks, ya'll be running round fronting these days
Can I buy you what? You listen to that Bills Bills shit
Too much, and now you wanna walk around like you Destiny's Child
I get the rubber, that's it, then I'm stretching you out
I play broke a dumb bitch, all I got is some weed and a lump dick
You want this? Cuz I copped this shit from a kid on my block
If the pussy good, then I pull a drawer out my sock
You got me open, you can think that, you really wanna turn me on?
Ma, drink that, just think that
If you waste it, don't ever do nobody good
Ask your gynecoligist, bitch, dick does a body good
I hope your pussy don't stink up my place
Truck, bombay, pick up the pace

[Truck]
Ma, I know what's up, you like to strip all day
Shake ya ass in the club, collect tips all day
See I like to fuck the pitbull way, roof
I smoke a little bit of weed now the bitch wanna stay
Now she's up in the lab, eating dick all day
Eating fish all day, eating shrimp all day
Bitch please, mack Truck, I'm a pimp all day
Twenty four hours, seven days a week
Fuck a bed, all I need is a place to creep
Lifestyle, a floor and a couple of sheets
Fuck her to the beat, til her legs get weak
Superhead, you the best, one hell of a freak

[Chorus]

[Beno]
Ma, I got dough, but I ain't think about you
Picture me dead broke, just thinking bout you
Matter fact what you think of my crew?
What you think, that we think, when we think about you
All of us wilding out, with our dicks up in you
Cameras, coming out, taking flicks of you
Now ma, move ya head, cuz you blocking my view
I be damned if I think about stopping you
So keep going, keep flowing
All my hustling niggas be knowing
How a ho like you keep me open
Cuz you suck me good, and you fuck me good
So I can't lie bitch, yo it must be good
It must be good, you fuck me good

[Iron Mic]
Yo, it's Iron, where the hoes at?
Where the thug chicks, here, ma, hold that
Roll that, get towed back, before I blow ya back
She called back, telling me she never did it like that
She like it thug style in the Ac', head on my lap
You looking for the cash, ma, you can forget about that
I ain't come to play pitty rap, I got my hands on down
Where on ya titties at, looking for the kitty cat
You gon' give me that? She give me one better
Gargle on my titty sacks, swallowed all kiddies back
To all ya bitches playing hard to get
When I catch you, I'mma hit you with the hardest dick
Now sing this shit
