[Chorus: C-Lite]
I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't you take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't you take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

[Lecrae]
It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just going lose my soul
And my ways ain't pure if I don't live according to your Word
I can't endure this life without your wisdom being heard
So word, to every dancer for a pop star
Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rockstar
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright
So let me fall back, stop giving my suggestions
Cause when I follow my obsessions, I end up confessing
That I'm not that impressive, matter of fact
I'm who I are, a trail of stardust leading to the superstar

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I had a dream that I was captain of my soul
I was master of my fate, lost control, and then I sank
So I don't want to take the lead, 'cause I'm prone to make mistakes
All these folks who follow me, gon' end up in the wrong place
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, 'cause I only trust in me
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, you know what's in my hand
Me, I just roll and trust you, you cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is you the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background, like it's an instrument

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I know I'm safest when I'm in your will, and trust your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really Glorify your name
And it's a shame, the way I want to do these things for you, yeah
Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from you
It seems you were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's 'cause she never heard of this

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
