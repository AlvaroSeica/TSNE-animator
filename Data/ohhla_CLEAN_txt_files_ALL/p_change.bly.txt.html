[Verse 1]
Yeah
That's not who you use to be you gangster now damn that's news to me
You got your whole swag attitude from me
Don't confuse who you are and who you choose to be (shhh)
Momma told me pray to god for once I said don't worry am common son
What rolls around comes back around again
remember back in the day when y'all were clowning him (hein?)
not knowing I was bound to win now his boulevard his squad is down for him
round the town pushing keys moving pounds for him
every song is the counseling
would you trade a minute of hell for an ounce of sin?
would you even survive the time to count to ten?
what happened to being modest, honest, keeping the promise?
when the fuck did your head get so enormous
it's more then a war then it's on
when you're called into the room and all of a sudden you ain't got no heart
stop it the music is boring am yawning
by the time your recording am snoring by the time you're performing
common

[Chorus]
I can't lie; I don't sleep the same (no)
one eye open because people change when
Best friends turn to enemies then
Good times turn to memories
I can't lie; I don't sleep the same (no)
one eye open because people change when (what)
Best friends turn to enemies then
Good times turn to memories
I can't lie

[Verse 2]
behind my back I hear them running around
You can run with the head but hunt with the hounds
I found out what you mumble ling now
oh what a whole bunch a whose couple of haves
I started you I could end you (end you)
Sam says times don't change, men do
After all that I have been through
Imagine what my enemies can do if that's what my friends do
Sacrifice to make it, isolated, private life invaded
Name the price I have paid it
this is my air my yeah my hind pipe could cave in (breathing)
this advice just take it if you give a word then that is your life don't
break it
see people change like seasons
the problem is that it's not for the right reasons
hell if I go the hell if I go (go)
no matter what the price am never selling my soul (never)
but bending the road, doesn't mean the end of the road
just tell me you a friend or a foe?

[Chorus]

I can't lie about it yeah
(Don't lie nigga)
These people change
(You know me)
You can't stay the same man
No matter what you do
Give them life haha yeah
(People cant talk no more)
These people change Haha
Get your fucking mind right nigga
Holla at me when you grow up
These people change
Need help
(I worked hard for this nigga)
(Shhhhh Real hard)
These people change</pre>
