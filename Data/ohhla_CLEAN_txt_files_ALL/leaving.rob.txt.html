[Rob Swift]
In the beginning we was bonding, physically and mentally
But over the years, I see it wasn't meant to be
And as I ask myself why was it said to me
Eventually I hope you could be a friend to me
So when you call, get that anger out your voice
I'm lettin' ya know that this wasn't my choice
We came together for a reason
Not a season or a lifetime, leavin' ain't the right time
For us to get back together
Cause feelings change from day to day like the weather
I wish you the best in life
I didn't mean to cause you stress and strife
Cause on the contrary, I thought of you as primary
While everything else in my life came secondary
But now the tables turn
I guess these are the things you're supposed to learn
So my advice, take it all in stride
And everything will be all right

[Gudtyme]
Nah girl yo, I don't moonwalk
You be lucky nuff if I even talk
I'm bored and baby you're the chore
I thought I had you dusted out my life, am I mistaken
Are these phone calls the method to get me sayin'
I miss you baby and our lives are together
That's bizarre, so check the four side for the weather
Cause you could pass me by girl, I won't cry girl
I'll fuck your friends cause i'm just that fly girl
If you wanna get bow, wash your ass with the soap
I'll find another sisters lovin'
There's no more hittin' and runnin'
I think you're bakin' in your oven
You think i'm simple like some nigga named simon
Ya once ya lost, I ain't got time for findin
Don't change your mind cause we can't relive the past
And since you don't know how to act then I don't need you in my cast

I say it now like I said it before
I'm leaving, front door
