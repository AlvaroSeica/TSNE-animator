[Zack de la Rocha]
COME WIT IT NOW!
...
COME WIT IT NOW!

[Verse 1ne]
The microphone explodes, shatterin the molds
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin, quenchin the thirst 
of the power dons - that five sided Fist-agon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggers cold empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally round the family! - Wit a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family! - Wit a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family! - Wit a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family! - Wit a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2wo]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal
I, walk from corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetary now!
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally round the family! - Pockets full of shells

[Chorus]

Bulls on parade! Uh...

[Instrumental break along with Tom Morello's freaky guitar solo]

COME WIT IT NOW!
...
COME WIT IT NOW!

BULLS ON PARADE!!!
...
BULLS ON PARADE!!!
..
BULLS ON PARADE!!!
..
BULLS ON PARADE!!!
..
BULLS ON PARADE!!!
