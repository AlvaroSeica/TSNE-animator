"Big Black, high tech shit like radar systems"

[Black Attack]
Yo, I touch shit up, fuck shit up
What'choo thought cat I wasn't rollin heavy like those diamonds you bought
I be tight like slim cooch' get loose like cold bitches
Slip I's while constructing hot shit for more riches
My dough status, nothin for you to be concerned with
I burn cranberries and tap phones on some Firm shit
Now realistically speakin, 'Attack stay freakin
I be speedin through tracks like eleven hundred ???
Hold on like En Vogue, smoke stogs like Dice Clay
Play the Cheech and Chong daily twistin up nice play
By the way, I heard somebody say B-L-A-C-K
Sound like another rap from around your way
But on the contrary, my whole style very
Hard to catch on to, prime time like Drew Carey
So wild bury niggas who can't keep up
And keep some block niggas with me so you can't creep up, what

Chorus:

"Rep the Rosevelt Island"
"Lyrically I twist ya shit back without no hesitation"
"Rep the Rosevelt Island"
"Big Black, high tech shit like radar systems"

[Black Attack]
I'm crazy red dun, I gotta sit up
My shit ?Primus? and what 
So when I write I twist the hottest shit up
Play the rap game like I play lotto
Flow in a dream, you know the motto
Blaze it up, pass the bottle
The I'm on, got me in the zone like three-two
Tryin to bubble like the bus (Him him) thats how we do
AMV worldwide, gun on your side
The mics on mine, I might flip somthin and slide
You know me, jammin like a tech, no question I can flow
(I break the cigar, red it out) similar to P-R-O
Light the 'dro, let these niggas know how it go
I'm Illmatic like the clover dun now watch me blow

Yo look look, chill chill
Hold that down, hold that down
Right right, yeah
This that Blackattack type shit
But what we going do is like what...
"Big Black, high tech shit like radar systems"

Chorus 2x

[Black Attack]
Don't ask me who I be, this Black Attack
Now check this out though
Known for smooth shit, no go, walk without dough
My man used to play for gauchos, bomb shit
When I rhyme the ??? Black always flipping off the wall shit
Elevated since then, stepped it up anotha notch
I'm gonna keep gettin better, day by day nigga watch
It's just like scotch, raw like the henny
Flipped many joints and got reembursed every penny
There's a limited amount of raw niggas these days
Thats why I keep my shit tight (Aiyyo, who got them trees, blaze)
My shit is worldwide like Starsky and Hutch
While you holdin that weed, I'ma spark me a dutch
Release the cuts quicky, ridiculously
Go off the top all night long, expeditously
See, I'm in it for the gusto like Puff
My shit raw but crazy underated like McGruff

Chours 4x (With variations)</pre>
