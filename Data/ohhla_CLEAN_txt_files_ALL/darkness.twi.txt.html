(Madrox)
How come this wasted time
Is such a loss expressed on minds side
I'd give you everything
If you'd just let me stand beside you
Your kind is so amused
And still confused bout what you live with
Your darkness just won't go away
Your light, inside for you to shine on today
Nothin but darkness in me

(Chorus)
Darkness, night time
No moon in the sky tonight
Feeling like our lives been tucked away, today
Life is darkness, forever remain and again

(Monoxide)
How come these things you say
They always seem to grow and haunt me
I'd give you everything
If you'd just let me stand beside you
You seem to think that I
Would let things slide and have you change me
This darkness just won't go away
No light inside for me to shine on today
Nothing but darkness in me

(Chorus)

{Guitar Solo}

(Chorus)

(Monoxide)
And again (15x)

(Monoxide)
No light inside for me to shine on today
Nothing but darkness in me

(Chorus)</pre>
