Typed by: SLWUBM3@aol.com

[Chorus]
If you want to try
Then you must want to die
The baddest of them all
You should that it's I
I never been down
So best not fuck around
Do you wanna be the next
Victim under ground
[2x]

[Knightowl]
You wanna battle me
But I'm the dopest of them all
You know that I be the wickedest
Mothafucka that you ever saw
The streets of Cali getting full of paranoya
Everybody in panic mode when I explode
Cause I'm the mothafuckin bomb
Your life's about to get took
I be that fuckin crook
They all warned you about
I'm the same fool your mama told you about
Think you bunch of stupid mothafuckas
And don't you try and rush me
You might get your brain split
Like a fuckin clit
Knightowl be that fool that brings terror
Never made and error
Infact I'm so fuckin dope
I con like Ferra
So what the fuck gives you the right
To fight a man with the clan
So fuckin sick get off my dick
Before this blade I stick in your fuckin eye
Die when you kill one of mine
It's time for you to go
Pay backs a fuckin bitch like you
You're through so good night mothafucka
Be the words I gotta say when I spray
Thats gonna be your last day on earth
You fuckin punk mothafucka

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
Check out this fool that'll bust
The Knightowl's the one that'll smoke you
Mothafuckas like angel dust
Crankin a mothafuckas dome like a rock
Light em up like pot
Situation gettin hot
And I'm still not gonna get caught
Who in the fuck has a death wish
Is it you that wants to meet the fuckin Devil
I'll shake that ass around like bass
And hit your ears like treble
When I kick you in the fuckin skull
I split your temple in two you gotta doubt
Do you wanna find out what I'ma about
If not go to hell and fuck you
The Knightowl sly slick and wicked
That ass I'll kick it when I confront you
I'll hunt your down like a fuckin dog
And make your cry before you fuckin die
You wanted to act loco
Not knowin you pick the wrong
Mothafucka to mess with
But it's too damn fuckin late
I'll make you disapear
Like good food on a plate
You'll never be able to
Get rid of the baddest MC
That got's em all runnin for their lives
So fuck you, your mom's your pop's
Your punk ass kids and that
Slutty ass bitch of a wife
Fuck her too
You punk mothafucka

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
Get off the mothafuckin ball sack
It is I that you wanna be like
I'll make that ass jump sides
Like a fuckin dyke
Fool quit the bull shitting
And put your mothafuckin
Self in check you get's no respect
When I get violent
I be rollin with my dawg Silent
Now who wants to be my next
To end with a broken neck
And stiff shoulders
When I'm droppin these lyrical boulders
I be incredible
When lead becomes edible
It's too damn late
For you to become regertable
Dead like Nat King Cole
But there is a big differences
You will become fogetable
Alot of wisdom spoken
You be some what like a cherry
About to get broken, provokin
The wrong bald headed fool
What are you smokin
Let go of them fuckin drugs
And get a taste of reality
Before you become the next fatality
Knightowl's too damn fuckin sick
I'm like a dog in heat
Ready to compete
As all my opponents get fucked
Ya'll just ran out of fuckin luck
So ya'll best step the fuck back
Before I crack a hole in your fuckin dome
You pinchi maircon

[Chorus]</pre>
