[Off Topic]
Remember when our biggest fear was Y2K?
'Cause we were ignorant, blind, and we liked it that way
Overseas conflicts share air time on 60 Minutes
With corporate sponsorships and celebrity who-did-it?
We in a glass bowl living though a filter so we never notice
That the food they're throwing in is poisoning us
Tax money subsidize corn and cattle
Makes corn syrup cheap so you know what cows eat
That's why fruits and vegetables cost big bucks and candy's cheap
That's why our teeth rot and kids are obese
Now your fear factors into every aspect of Big Brother's military tactic classes
Lead the masses
Uncle Tom, Major Tom
Tomahawk missile bombs
Dying fast, lasting long
It's another Vietnam
Lock and load those machine guns, we're gonna need 'em all
Had my hard drive erased on purpose
So I don't know what day my birth is
No sign, my horoscope is worthless
For what it's worth, I'm as strong as my verse is

[Phase Fate]	I've seen too much, man
[Off Topic]	I'm desensitized
[Phase Fate]	These eyes roll back in my head
[OT &amp; PF]	'Cause blank stares are the norm
[Viro]		All I wanna do is write, record, and perform
[Off Topic]	I've seen too much, man
[Phase Fate]	I'm desensitized
[Off Topic]	These eyes roll back in my head
[OT &amp; PF]	'Cause blank stares are the norm
[Viro]		All I wanna do is write, record, and perform

[Phase Fate]
Like bombs whiz by my head
The dawn of the dead
I'm watchin' soldiers, they're wrapped in flags
Their bodies vacuum packed
Like that movie Stag, use 'em and fuckin' kill 'em
Send the family the bill
Watch daddy stand still in the picture frame
The angels came and took daddy away
Now who's to say that's what happened
Better yet the devil packin'
AK-47's Cold War leftovers, reheat
Just stir and add water
Just be sure keep on the edge of your seat
6 o'clock I'm on it
Downy-fresh, Ford'll take you further
By the way there's a murder
Not in your 'hood, its sure to
Make you pause for a second
And get back, back to eatin' breakfast
Walked by the homeless man
He just wanted some liquor
I'll get to sleep, quicker
Tonight, but the lights flicker, i try
Now my life's all biggie-sized
Man, how'd I'd get so desensitized?

[Off Topic]	I've seen too much, man
[Phase Fate]	I'm desensitized
[Off Topic]	These eyes roll back in my head
[OT &amp; PF]	'Cause blank stares are the norm
[Viro]		All I wanna do is write, record, and perform
[Phase Fate]	I've seen too much, man
[Off Topic]	I'm desensitized
[Phase Fate]	These eyes roll back in my head
[OT &amp; PF]	'Cause blank stares are the norm
[Viro]		All I wanna do is write, record, and perform
[Off Topic]	I've seen too much, man
[Phase Fate]	I'm desensitized
[Off Topic]	These eyes roll back in my head
[OT &amp; PF]	'Cause blank stares are the norm
[Viro]		All I wanna do is write, record, and perform
