"Once upon a time, there was a young man named..."
Hodgy Beats, OF, Super 3, yes

[Hodgy Beats]
I live for the money so I'm present in the Green Age
Mutant - like a Turtle that's Teenage
Look nice, but act gutter without a clean face
M-V-P me like D-Wade
I'm a shooter, like a computer for the internet
As if it's intercourse, I'm just not in it yet
My house like a sauna, I'm always in a sweat
Every time she in my bed, she always gettin wet
I wouldn't call it sex but physical intellect
Break your ass, then your back, then your neck
He's a gangster, you ridin with a roller
Wagon wheel, Cabbage Patch, he pushin a stroller
Don't show holsters, 'less he pullin the toasters
Is that fish dead? Oh yeah he's a floater
Full of holes, and I stay in rooms full of hoes
Got Tyler lyin to them all like Pinocchio
Grow a nose

[Tyler, the Creator]
Once upon a time there was a boy that could rap
Rap, rap, let me talk my crap
I said once upon a time there was a boy that could rap
Rap, rap... talk my crap
Once upon a time there was a boy that could rap
Rap, rap, let me talk my smack~!
Once upon a time there was a boy that could rap
Rap, rap... I said
