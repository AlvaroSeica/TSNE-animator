Typed by: AZ Lyrics

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

I might come to your town, shut a show down
Got the whole crowd screamin', "Lil' Bow Wow"
Without the "Lil'" but I'm still on top
Back with S.S.D., record sales won't flop

That's what you thought but I'm in that new Porsche
No box earrings, chain on, no watch
Picture a grandfather clock with diamonds
That's just the kinda mind state that I'm in

Caviar, Cartier, carterdrop
On my neck, call her dead cute shorty called liner
I'm on my p's and my q's
Stones green to the blue, 23's when I cruise

Feel my calf muscle on the gas and the brake pedal
Ain't another youngin' on my bank level
Where you at?
I'm right hurr, never late, please see clurrr, it's no blur, yes sir

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

I'm on leer jets, know what make your face
From your tears wet while you rockin' last years Sweats
Swag, yeah, I got it, Prada bags for my luggage
Face on screen for everything I does in the public

Boy wonder, make the other boys wonder
How we keep it comin' different e'ry summer
Don't be amazed 'cause of me
Be amazed 'cause the V came with a five year opped-out lease

That's 'cause I paid what I paid
If you paid like I'm paid then yo' cribs came wit the maids
And if it didn't then you slippin', catch up
But by the time you do, I'll probably do it different

I'm advanced, see the pants
See the kicks, see the stones on the risk
You see the phone on my hip?
Where it at?
It's right thurr, up to date, please see clurr, it's no blur, yes sir

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

Shootin' niggaz down, slappin' bitches up
Straight cash strut with some Henny in my cup
Rude for the hell of it, I should be the president
Aye yo homey, Doggy Dogg got that medicine

In the cabinet, I'm the magnet
Of attracting the baddest bitches on the planet, dig it
I once was a pup, never scared to run up
I did it 'til the day I came up

And stars do shine
I take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind
First I, chop 'em and den some flop 'em then flip 'em
Break 'em and bend 'em then fix 'em, convince 'em to buy my records

'Cause you know it's all hits
Spread the word 'cause you know it's the shit
Quit playin', go get it, quit hesitatin'
It's the young and the big on tha real my nig'

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield

On a mission, wishin' upon a star
Young Bow Weezy with the caviar
In the back of a limo, make them others seem surreal
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield</pre>
