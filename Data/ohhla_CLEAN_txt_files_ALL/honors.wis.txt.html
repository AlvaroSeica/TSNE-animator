Typed by: Knowledge God

[Anthony Chisholm from "Oz" sample]
My age is my honor and my strength...

[Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
If it was a million and one people, and I can only help a million
All I would think about is the one I couldn't help, man...
Speak to me, man

[Kevlaar 7]
Aiyo, the news hit my eardrum, the slums we came up in
Oakdale, smoke the Crooklyn Dodger weed, within
Slang in stolen tapes and swollen bags
Sipping blue, after-hours, cheating on tests, we made the honors
Honest on the block, we sic that Rottweilers on them
Flaunt it for bitches up in French class, wrote rhymes on note pads
Fronting like we push the newest Benz class
Bid fast on the grid-ound while you was rifling shots
Quick stop spots, it was the last time I see you
I gave you a dap inside the last dream I see you
I still peep you, talking fast and hustling cream
Chasing knowledge, the last breath told you set your feet
Teach your lesson, it's a blessing, the destined is gone
What went wrong? Is a greatest constant psalm song where I'm from
Your land is promised, you living better than us, honest
It's gorgeous to see your soul resting in honor

[Bronze Nazareth]
I was conceived in the foxhole, plenty of wolves
Alligator on my chest, see my face in the moon
I took AK grammar quote, one man platoon
Strategise third eye will lift rare spoons
Racoon hats soon, plus Nia in my room
Give a gold kiss, my future bright like UFO bliss
I hand you our page, could you feel my drift?
My heart is still mine skiff, diamond cave rich
Langston Hughes, intrusion poet at heart
Flowing like shark fins that glow in the dark
You can't miss me, sipping Mississippi Masala
Diamond Dixie, my bitches prissy, keep the pussy pretty
My life is a square with all left turns
If you step in my direction, it's your essence that burns
I'm a man of many hats, black hoodies, no furs
A tangled web of razor sharp thoughts travel in herds

[Phillie]
You know that type be, scrambling the night streets
Cherished riches, made killers before they're nineteen
I'm from the D and this is how we eat and
No matter what, your running the rock beats man
It's Hell where we sleep, half slept, dealt the boldest hand
Shall we stand some gone, where does the pain come from?
Missed by the floor show, lights shine too bright
I need silence in the courtroom, it's Fortune Five Hundred
Time's coming, but I ain't buying groceries with a bridge
Thinking big, fucking chain and a bracelet
His bank slip's no great shit, got too pissed they don't play shit
Be the ignoramus, catch five from the stainless
Fuck rap, all I hear is the same shit
Commercialised rap guys with a lame grip, too lazy to create shit
I'm outer space with this rap style amazing
Evaporate your 'Liquid Swords', inhale a great wind
Put in approach that was only known to cavemen
Get enslaved man, not happy where you're spaced in

[sample]
Some people are born where there's opposite sides
A wiseman knows his own limitations
You think of me...</pre>
