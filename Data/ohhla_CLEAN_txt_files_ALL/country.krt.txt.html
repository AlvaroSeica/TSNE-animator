[Chorus]
Let me tell you bout this super fly, dirty dirty
Third coast muddy water, shawty pop that pussy if you wanna
Let me tell you bout this old school, pouring lean
Candied yams and collard greens, Pocket Full of Stones, riding clean
Let me tell you bout this country shit, country-country shit (country-country shit)
Let me tell you bout this country shit, country-country shit (country-country shit)
Let me tell you bout this country shit, country-country shit (country-country shit)
Let me tell you bout this country shit, country-country shit (country-country shit)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I told him, aw man hold up, what you know about it?
Candy cars, superstars, rubber bands in my pocket
A couple broads for the popping, if she riding then she bopping
Bitch I'm selling if you shopping, if you need it then I got it
If I want it then I cop it, you don't like nigga? Top it
Why you worried bout mine hoe? What's off in your wallet?
I was riding my Screw shit, rims chop-chopping
Top dropping, throwing bread crumbs, crows start flocking
Knocking pictures off the wall, we sit tall but we still crawl
We still shoot, we still score, we still win, so we still ball
We still hood, so fuck them laws, I got nuts and I got loot
If you can't see the King in a nigga like me undoubtedly, well fuck you too, yeah

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Okay, the Caddy still swanging and the trunk still banging
Nigga, tricking ain't pimping shawty, what is y'all thinking?
Wh-wh-what is y'all saying? Wh-wh-what is y'all sanging?
Hit the club, buy the bar, like what is y'all dranking?
Old school foreign cars shawty, what is y'all cranking?
Kush blunts, bank teller ask me, why is y'all stanking?
If it's money I chill shawty, why is y'all playing?
She was bound to fuck a pimp, so why is you caking?
Saving hoe, caped crusader at her service, aiding hoe
Damn the hoe, blame the hoe for the same shit you paid her fo'
Shake it mo' for a pimp with my shrimp on my plate
Countryfied, country fly with a tape

[Chorus]</pre>
