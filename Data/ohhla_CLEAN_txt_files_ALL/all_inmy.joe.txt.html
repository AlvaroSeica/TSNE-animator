[Joe Budden]
Uh, uh.. uh
Maybe it started with Slaughterhouse, or was it tour life?
Maybe it wouldn't have started at all, if I had your life
Maybe it was needed or was I thinkin immorally?
If I wasn't myself could I say I gave the fans +All of Me+?
Can't decide if I'm more ashamed of what they saw in me
than I am of ignorin all the lessons that was taught to me
Headed up field but couldn't dodge the last tackler
How could a forward thinker move so ass backwards?
How could a dude with no regrets at all willin to bet it all
not realize that quicker demise? How could I neglect it all?
I'm so seasonal, some of y'all knew I'd spring back
With a heart this cold, how'd y'all think I'd be receptive to fall?
I'm plenty comfortable when danger's around
And even more so when strangers around
And the bigger picture is sicker, don't know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
Don't know a nigga, don't know my bouts with drugs or liquor or the harm it causes
Life or death, I tried to lynch myself
Thought I could keep it all a secret, I convinced myself
But really, the folk that loved me they could tell I was loc'in
I couldn't see 'em, cry me a river cause it fell in the ocean
Numb to my words now, maybe felt I was open
I cut so many people loose, do I need help with devotion?
That's just, some of the things I ask my Lord and Savior
And when He calls for me, will He have done us all a favor?

[Chorus: Kobe]
How did I make it herrrrrrre?
Who are y'all? (Who are y'all?)
I feel so lost (so lost)
Now I'm not seein it clearrrrrrrr
Is it my fault? (Is it my fault?)
It's all in my head

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm lookin around like "This can't be happenin" (can't be happenin)
Round of applause for the angry rappers (angry rappers)
Lord, my girl cried me a flood than me a river
That's love, dependin on me when I'm a dependent on liquor
I'm up in the shoe sto', she got no love to show
You ever look at a bitch you was fuckin behind your bitch back like "Fuck I was fuckin you fo'?"
I'm an artist so I'm intelligent
I would tell you to do some soul searchin, but it's hangin up in my closet with your skeleton
It's gotta be God's work, even a diamond gotta be polished first
A quarter's on the loose and I ain't been out here gettin my dollar's worth
I had to remove the goggles first
To see through the sippin Patrón and fifty phoners
'fore I need to go get me a kidney donor
Guru, Nate Dogg, go 'head, blink a eye
The doctor told me, "You close, go 'head, drink and die"
Buried under the stone where the Patrón fifth sits by
That reads "Here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy"

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
It go, look
They say knowledge is power, great cause every day I learn
As of late been havin revelations 'bout this hate term
Hate the way they judged me, 'til I got the case adjourned
Hated the belly of the beast 'til I became it's tapeworm
When I said I'd stop gettin high, tried to say it stern
Though I'm the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
They say my brain is off, I say "How can it be?"
If I'm out my mind, how can I be in-sanity?
And people used to say that I was scared of progress
They don't know how hard a nigga tried to advance
But I don't know who's more to blame, is it them for really not knowin me
or is it me for never really givin them a chance?
Get too close be too big of a threat
Now it's been little to no time thinkin why I ain't get rid of you yet
Gotta recognize my maturity, gotta see I'm grown
Let all my skeletons out the closet, just so I'd never be alone
Since I got trust issues, I won't discuss with you
Besides God, tell me who the fuck's supposed to save you
Pop won't have a man-to-man, was gone half my life so
Somewhere in his head probably feel it ain't his place to
Plus more people'll see me soon
I mean, I'll be on national TV soon
So when I ask if people I have around are a cancer for me
That's 4 million more that might be able to answer for me
Joey~!

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden over Chorus]
C'mon!
Who the fuck is y'all?
Nigga!
It's a couple of questions
Just some of the things a nigga goes through every night
OHH~!

[Outro: Joe Budden]
Parks on the board
Real nigga in the booth
Signin off, to who it may concern
Uh, uh, uh, uh
