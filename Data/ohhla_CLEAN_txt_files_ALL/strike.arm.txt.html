Yeah!

It's like that, you know it's like that, there ain't an army that could strike back - - &gt; Nas
Hey yo, it's like that, hey yo it's like that!
Ar-my! Pharaohs!

[Planetary]
It's the manifestation of rap greatness
I determine my life around the sound of a piano and bass hit
The basics of this hip-hop matrix, it's graveyard rap,
Quest build on your day, shift
I shake shift and get 'em to shake quick cause when Paz make the call I make grade A shit
Am I labeled a bitch so I say fuck chicks 
because who the fuck is gonna hold me down 'sides Crypt?
Who the fuck can control my sounds still don' got me, Scott be makin' my vocal sounds so cocky
Who got me? Yeah my dogs most likely
If I ain't loyal to my niggas, then god strike me

[Demoz]
Keep strikin'
I'm taking your life, take my advice it's basically right
If money's the root of all evil then Satan is right
Break me twice that makes me two, that makes me a double headed rapper now make me a booth
Next to the one now that I'm in now the day's legacy too
Crazy motherfuckers light a fire up under these roofs
Maybe it's true I'm a rapper and maybe it's truth 
between my ego and pride come make me the truth
Maybe I do need powder to make it juice, 
to go down with the first rapper claiming that he's too...
fuckin' nice, I'll fuck ya with a knife, fuck his wife
tell your bitch your husband said good night
Yeah it's like that ain't no army that can strike back
If hip-hop is dead then Demoz will bring it right back

It's like that, you know it's like that
there ain't an army that could strike back - - &gt; Nas
Hey yo, it's like that, hey yo, it's like that!
there ain't an army that could strike back - - &gt; Nas
Hey yo, it's like that, hey yo, it's like that!
Ar-my! Pharaohs!

[King Syze]
Raise up the white flags, man it's time to surrender
I'm on a mission for the dope with a cokehead agenda
We're stormtroopers, burst through the craziest rain
I'll burst through fire walls while lazy niggas complain
Your pride came and went, and you ain't make it
It was right in front of your face, you ain't take it
Never be me, I can't live with that
Cause the youth I got I can't have that back
I'm the general, commendable, overall dependable
Loc'd out of cosmos but most times sensible
Live for the minute the moment the older I get
When the digits rolling over that's it

[Esoteric]
Ya call me Eddie Brock
Venom with machete chop penny rock
guzzilin' husslin' from eighty block
You wanna battle band
But you ain't serve gallohan
You pussies take +Heat+ back like Shaq's travel band
But you ain't got no gun or paper in your luggage
The only 9Mil you have gets you fries and nuggets
We stab bucks like study Jack Sigma
We'll travel back in time and attack Hitler
Look at money grid tryin' to buy his life back
You ain't a pharaoh dog, ring him by his life back
Fuck 'round with the army get your ice packed
Cause we don't fuck around dog, yo, it's like that

[Vinnie Paz]
Anybody go against me gettin' tortured and slain
Slaughtered then maimed
We robbin' rappers off with their chain
I'm a cannibal eatin' motherfucker start with their brain
They say that Panzienza previously thought to be sane
I fought through the pain and established a remarkable reign
Lamatta Panzienza Marcientto all in the same
We coulda signed a couple deals but what they offered was lame
But that was regardless of the fact that we was awkward with fame
And I remember me and Jus Allah would spark on the train
And talk about how we were going to leave our mark in the game
We back together and we gon' bring the dog back to the game
And you know that we put our motherfuckin' heart in the game
Yeah!

It's like that, you know it's like that
there ain't an army, an army that could strike back - - &gt; Nas
Hey yo, it's like that, hey yo it's like that!
There ain't an army that could strike back - - &gt; Nas
It's like that, you know it's like that
there ain't an army that could strike back - - &gt; Nas
Hey yo, it's like that, it's like that!
Ar-my! Pharaohs!</pre>
