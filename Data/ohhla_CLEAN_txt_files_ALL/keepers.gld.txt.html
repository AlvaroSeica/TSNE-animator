[Santigold]
I walk by, with smoke in my eyes
Like we don't know where we've been
That's it boy, just state your case
You're just as wrong as you were then
Want to move? Throw your hands up
Say I don't make the rules; no one even knows I'm here
Now it's all you to man up
You see no way to hang on what you say

[Chorus]
We're the keepers, while we sleep in America
Our house is burning down, our house is burning
We're the keepers, while we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning down (down now keepers down)
Our house is burning down

[Santigold]
Ask me why, the dream that you buy
but later wants is a dangerous thing
Watch out for, the snakes ride past
and turns around and it sucks you in
What happens when you get stuck?
Get to the bottom of, the illusion that you're in
From the roof now, it's your go
No one else without will do you in

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
And not a thing, I've done, obeys, my fear
And not a thing, I've done, obeys - and still I never have to run
We are gone, we are gone
On our hills where we all are done

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro: repeat 5X]
Down now keepers down</pre>
