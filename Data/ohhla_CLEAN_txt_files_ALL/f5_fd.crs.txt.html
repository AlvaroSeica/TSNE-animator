[Chorus: Claret Jai]
We're so furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-furiously dangerous
We're so furiously dangerous
Fu-fu-fur-furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-fur..

[Ludacris]
L-L-L-Luda! L-l-l-listen
Death by lyrical injection, I'll KILL you rappers
A lot of green with a yellow complexion, women call me the Green Bay Packer
(Woo!) I pack the zeroes, meanin mucho dinero
So paid, rappers is waitin on trades and they all get +Knicked+ like Melo
Hello! Luda! Tell these other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck
My every record's jumpin, or playin double dutch
I SHIT on rappers, every verse just got the bubble guts!

[Joe Budden]
Let me tell this to the people not understandin my moxy
Animal watch me, if you think it's tangible stop me
But then I hit 'em with a flow that they can't even copy
See we don't play that where I'm from it's like fantasy hockey
Sup wit a dog, thugs want a war
Bad gene, what you wanna trade slugs with him for?
While you cuffin 'em all, I'm stuffin the jaw
Illegal for you read my kind of love on the board
Dawg, you and your skill versus hard parts from our squad
I'll put you on a crash course in a Smart car
Mach speed and not relyin on a brake pad
in a car you usually drive on a racetrack
So the lines 'bout your Phantoms and your Maybachs
are ghost tales for the phantoms, face facts
We ruin hip-hop, Slaughterhouse and payback
In the shape of the tat', now you done faded to black
GO!

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Claret Jai)
I went from eatin Top Ramen to bein top rhymer
Check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time where my only perfection was my momma
My mind a long erection, now it's time ya
bow down and erect a monu-ment in my honor
Cause bitch I'm bonker, plural
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous girl
She on E feelin on me singin on-key
while I'm bumpin "We Are the World"
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn't did he?
(We run this town!) No we didn't, Diddy
I feel like tiltin the glass, you take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson, I call her Mississippi
That was pretty witty
Your man like a black man tryin to get re-elected, he ain't get it did he?

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, Timberland to the pedal, pedal to the floor
Just whippin it through the ghetto, metal in the door
case I gotta throw some lead into ya boy
Referee mindstate {*whistle blows*} I'm settlin the score
I don't know what y'all hatin for
Wait, wait, know what? Matter fact
I don't know what y'all waitin for
I ain't finna say nothin, turn the bass up more
'til the speakers pop
I get a kick out of that like a sneaker spot
See I was a lil' kid with his thumbs in his ears and a tongue in the air
goin (na-na-na-nyah-nyah) just when you think it stop
(na-na-na-nyah-nyah-nyah) Everything I speak is hot
But don't be mad, at least everything you speak is...
I can't think of nothin nice to say
You're not nice, okay?

[Crooked I]
Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I'm launchin manure
Lord of the underground, God of the sewer
On Hennessy Black, all kind to the jawwww
Yeah, I'm off the block
This ain't work homie I'm off the clock
I'm a syllable, Hannibal killer, a cannibal
with a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable ammo
Lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West 'til I walk with 'Pac
We the +2.0 Boys+ with Crooked, Joe, Royce
New gold Rolls Royce pull off the lot
Pop me the only way you can stop me
I'm top seed, I clock green at Mach speed
So watch me if you haven't seen the phenomenon
I spit fast as Lamborghini's in Ramadan

[Chorus]

[Claret Jai]
I suggest, you shut it down
Pack your ish, and turn around
Because tonight, we run this town
So let your feet, still swiftly hit the ground

[Ludacris]
We too dangerous for the world!</pre>
