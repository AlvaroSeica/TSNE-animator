Do you wanna get loose and talk freaky and graphic
Top down, bass hittin when you're sittin in traffic?
Yeah, that beat got a brother fired up
Suckers lookin at the rubber when the Vogue tire cut
Dudes jock worse than they broads do
If the punk had a gun he'd be servin the crew
But I ain't the one to take advantage of another man
I'll give her the game, toss his hoe, then I'll shake his hand
Because a brother like me is a potential threat
Book knowledge and street knowledge makes them sweat
When you put em both together it's a combination
Of an educated thug that can run a nation
All my friends in schools ain't bookworms
The librarian's a freak, so we took turns
Ain't no shame in a player like myself
I get ya on the table, if I can't upon the shelf
Sex in bed is an old tradition
I like it at the beach, on the couch and in the kitchen
Man, I'm not comin up short when it's about to jump
I'ma do it till it hurts, but now I'm goin hump

(What time is it?)	--&gt; Beastie Boys
It's time to hump
(Hump)
(Get up)
(What time is it?)
It's time to hump
(Hump)
(Get up)

I've been checkin out your gameplan
You're straight lackin in mackin
Drivin hoes around town like a chauffeur, gopher
Yeah, your nickname is Gopher cause you 'go-for' all the bullshit
You go for gettin used and go for gettin pimped
Punk marks like you campaign on the coochie
Told him that his girlfriend gave head, he said: "Do she?"
Five minute man, four minutes for foreplay
That means you're only up in it for a minute
A brother like me is a Duracell
I guarantee she get a nut and make sure it's swell
Oh, you make love to her so cute and nice
That's why you tossed her once and I can toss her twice
Or three or four or five times
But she still rocked my ( ? ) on my sidelines
Romancer, cute Casanova
She's always layin on her back with you, so I bend her over
I got cockshots and videotapes of her
But I won't show nobody cause I know you love her
Take her out to dinner, to the movies and take her home
So when I get there all I gotta do is bone
You're a push-beater and a pussy eater
I'm not tryin to say it's bad but I just geed her
Had you thinkin she was wet cause she busted a nut
But that was MY nut, now you're lickin her guts
Baby, tell me your sexual fantasy
I wanna make love in the bed or with the canape
Dreams come true when you're messin with the sandman
You know the bone'll make a nut if the hand can't
We get freaky, but with you she acts like a queen
Got you bustin nuts in your jeans
Sittin with a hard dick sayin nothin
But only if you knew, partner, your girlfriend been humpin

(What time is it?)	--&gt; Beastie Boys
It's time to hump
(Hump) (Humpin) (Humpin)
(What time is it?)	
It's time to hump
(Hump)
(Get up)
(Where is all the humpin people at?)
(Where is all the humpin people at?
Where ya at?
Say it loud)

[ VERSE 3 ]
I was drivin down the street, man, slammin the beat
Then I smelled something strong: two freaks in heat
So I bent a hard left and made a u-turn
Hm, one had braids and the other one a cool perm
Faces proper, the chest and the booties swollen
Got at em, now we're three deep in the front seat rollin
Two broads and one dude will attract heat
I put the top up and headed for the backstreets
I got at both of em and had em interested
They said it's been a while since they been intimate
I didn't favor either one, I let them choose
Got em both juiced up so I can't lose
One was all on my zipper, I was gettin horny
They said that if I wanted they would cook dinner for me
So I mobbed to the condo very quickly
Packed a gat in case these hoes trick me
So I started touchin on em and playin with em
They started grabbin and laughin and givin rhythm
The freakin was on until dinner time
I was eatin and thinkin of a strategy of gettin mines
I said damn, they were already finished eatin
Went to the room so I followed them and started freakin
One undressed me on the bed to my buck skin
One got undressed while the other had sucked me in
I can't let her turn me out and toss a brother up
I switch it up and keep her workin for another nut
Put on the body armor, by now I'm ready for the war
I got one at the front and at the back door
You know the first nut shoots in no time
I ain't sweatin cause the second one is showtime
It started seeming like a bad dream
Cause these two thick freaks had me beat on the tag team
But I was tossin em, flippin em, grindin em, pumpin em
They'll remember Mhisani, man, cause I was humpin em
