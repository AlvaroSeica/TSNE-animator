[Verse 1]
She tap, the girl like flips yea
I stow here to walk across the sky just to get you,
Now use I'll be shooting but tonight I'm only cruisin,
At a speed it made it easy for them fiends to start choosing,
2 miles an hour with my partner playing puzzles
And I play dead like say Red you should've won an Oscar
I'm only in the running for the money, save the trophy
It will take more, to get you through this door than saying you know me
A pocket full of potent's blowing rains around the Rosie
The shots through up out it, shots to the sack it got er open,
Forget what you was wishin', get over what you hoping,
I'm fin to tear it down, in this bitch like I was Josin'
Now throwin' like you're...

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't gotta ask man, let's go, see when I touch down,
I'm looking for a nasty bitch, that I can bust on
Expecting from the gate when I see, 'cause I don't fuck round
I'm pimpin the bitches and chekin the niggas because I come from uptown

[Verse 2]
Can't wait to see my new work, just left Alley X
Can't wait to get to Newark, a little neck due work
Drove up to brick city, you know I got them bricks with me,
You ain't gotta aks what I do, 'cause I can spins it
Remind me of the time I was trippin' and put the apron on
Stretch a little 4 and 1/2 'cause they was taking long,
You ain't gotta aks me for shit, 'cause I'm a throw that,
At your door map like a clear picture, Kodak
You can take these here with you, but just know that
(I'm pimpin the bitches and chekin the niggas)
Yeah juvenile throw back,
I'm looking for a nasty bitch so I can cut up,
Now there's bitch aksing for shit, I'm like fuck sup?
She really just wanted some dick but I don't fuck around,
We can get back to that shit, after I bust them down,
Take that shit all for daddy, and throw it my way,
But keep them thongs on with daddy on em and I say.

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't gotta ask man, let's go, see when I touch down,
I'm looking for a nasty bitch, that I can bust on
Expecting from the gate when I see, 'cause I don't fuck round
I'm pimpin the bitches and chekin the niggas because I come from uptown

[Verse 3]
I skit it in the dope, you fell in love with her,
You buy Louie purses and do drugs with her,
I only call her over, just to release from stress,
And then I tittie fuck the skit on her neck, in her breast
You just a Simpson like home above,
I shop at sex 5th, you cop at Wal-Mart
I'm on some G shit, they said I wouldn't go beast shit
You stuck in the wood, you like a genital, you don't want sea shit,
I'm pimpin the bitches and chekin the niggas because I come from uptown
Don't call me if you're on your period bitch serious I won't fuck now
I tell that ho to suck prep and pass that ho the next flips
Until my niggas Izzle remind er she addicted to dick,
Bitch you got nut on your breath, so you can't hit this doja
I tap that ass 3 times for my nigga Soulja
I ain't a show for love, believe me bitch I know your drow
Bitch I'm from Haly Grove, bitch I'm from Haly Grove

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't gotta ask man, let's go, see when I touch down,
I'm looking for a nasty bitch, that I can bust on
Expecting from the gate when I see, 'cause I don't fuck round
I'm pimpin the bitches and chekin the niggas because I come from uptown</pre>
