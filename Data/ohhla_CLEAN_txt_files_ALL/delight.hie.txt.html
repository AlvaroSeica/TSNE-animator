Chorus 

[Pep Love] 

I'm about as swift as lightning greased 

[Opio] 

And I'm cold like Sub-Zero feel the deep freeze 

[Both] 

We the ones that make you feel right 
You need to open up your eyes and see delight 

[Opio] 

I'm at ease when I'm next to my keys 
Not the narcotic 
The Ensoniq ASR-X is my symphonic weapon
Stepping to these creations is like attempting to scale the Appalachian 
Mountains 
It's damn near impossible 
Without rigid preparation and lots of pull 
Delight 
Profound lyrics spit into mics 
Irresistible to bite on stage 
The instrumental incites the freestyle 
Fake MC's bust written raps 
Pupils dilatin 
Agonizing forgetting raps 
While I'm shining intensely 
Reflecting off the Hieroglyphic shield 
For real 
Reinventing hip hop 

[Pep Love] 

Open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 
You better open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 

[Pep Love] 

It go, Cancer the crab is my zodiac sign 
F.L. is the crew, I'ma let my light shine 
We multi-faceted, feel good pharmacist at this 
Now listen to the lyricist cease 
And desist so we can leave em deceased
If not stressed till they suicidial 
I ingest the mic 
Just a test of sound 
If I impressed, see delight on my face 
In the place of mess 
First Light 
The recipe for Saucee, serves you right 
You can ask Martini and Rossi 
You don't wanna grapple with that bullshit 
I'll pull a rabbit out my hat if I wanted trick 

[Pep Love] 

Open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 
You better open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 

[Opio] 

What are you doing? 
You're confused like a hermaphrodite 
Rapping like this one or that one won't get you capped at night 
Or shanked in the morning sun 
At the venue 
If you continue to disregard these warnings 

[Pep Love] 

Running into some problems 
Mic to mic, you must resuscitate 
Life in your mental state 
Trife when we infiltrate 
Tonight the light is felt 

[Opio] 

Like encountering an asteroid belt 
You gets pelted, welted up 
Face is green like a Celtic or Wimbly stadium 
Center court 
No back support 
You just a gelatin skeleton 
Lyric like a elephant tranquilizer 
Impeding your development 

[Pep Love] 

I'm runnin amuck, dumb fucks
And gunning 'em up 
They awe-struck by the light like deer
Game for the hunter, predator 
Ready to taste blood 
So blaze up a blunt and pass that shit here 

[Opio] 

Yeah, they need light like photosynthesis 
Biting sentences 
Witness to thee inventiveness 
That you can't resist 
Painful like a pistol whipping 

[Pep Love] 

Niggas is tripping they get dissed 
I mind my business which is this 
Ripping microphones 
Scratching suckers off my list 
With speed 
A level that you can't exceed 
I give the people what they want 
You need to take heed 

Chorus 

[Opio] 

You know 

Uhhhh!!! 

First Light
