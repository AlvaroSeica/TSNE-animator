[Intro: sample from "Willy Wonka and the Choclate Factory"]
Oompa Loompa, dupity-doo
I've got the perfect puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa, dupity-dee
If you are wise you will listen to me {*echoes*}

[Layzie Bone Â– during Intro]
Bone, Bone, Bone (L-Burna, Strate Jacket, LeathaFace, Big Flesh-N-Bone)

That's right, Bone boys is back (yeah)

[Chorus 2X: Layzie Bone]
I'm so good - y'all can't duplicate me {"Oompa Loompa, dupity-doo"}
I'm top secret, they wanna know my recipe {"I've got the perfect puzzle for you"}
They love it - all over the world they see {"Oompa Loompa, dupity-dee"}
All in the streets bumpin Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
{"If you are wise you will listen to me"}

[Layzie Bone]
We got 'em tuned in like CNN, the most watched, the most trusted
Guaranteed platinum hits, motherfuckers love it
How we destined to be addictive, I'm so sick with it like cancer
The greatest rappers alive, niggaz ain't got no answers
or solutions for this movement dawg, we run right through 'em
Don't mean to brag, but niggaz mad cause we don't come close to 'em
Got them 24's spinnin, off the sweat of my saliva
So much spit from the tongue, ain't nobody liver
I got that fire, real thug life supplier
I'm takin flight baby, I can get you higher
I figured I warned you when I drop this year
"But it's another rapper's turn!" Nigga not this year, hey!
But we ain't trippin, we got love for the real
If you hatin on me dawg, I'ma go for your grill
Don't try to battle cause we bustin them guns
I mean I'm second to none, that means I'm Number One
We got juice 

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
In '93 we had these Cleveland niggaz holdin they breath
Cause we was some young wild niggaz droppin "Faces of Death"
Let me get to tracin my steps, now who woulda thought that we would blow?
Took a trip to California back in 1994
Before long, dropped the "Thuggish Ruggish Bone"
Nigga Eazy-motherfuckin-E was puttin me on
And they love it, love it, +Foe Tha Love of the Money+
Niggaz was out here in they hustle mode, livin the thugsta story
In '96 other rappers couldn't stand me
Because my family was bringin home the Grammy
Thugged-out niggaz from the St. Clair area
Still up in yo' hood, niggaz never been scared of ya
Beware of the, way them Bone Thug niggaz tear it up
Darin ya to ever try to step or try to compare to us
Never that, Lil' Layzie way too clever, Jack
I'm goin diamond, y'all wood like a lumberjack 

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Tell the DJ play the music, put the needle on the record
Been a while since I checked in, niggaz still respectin
My mind recollectin, let me do some bill collectin
Put it down so it ain't no question, me and my dawgs is blessed man
Testin testin, one-two one-two
I'ma give you what you want, nigga what you gon' do?
I'm on cue, stay ready, I ain't got to get ready
Lyrics heated heavy, all the time deadly
Bet me, if you got the balls of steel
I look a nigga up and down like, "Is you for real?"
Better chill with the tough act, I know where the thugs at
Real niggaz bust back, tell me how you love that 

[Chorus]

[Outro: sample]
Oompa Loompa, dupity-doo
I've got the perfect puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa, dupity-dee
If you are wise you will listen to me {*echoes*}</pre>
