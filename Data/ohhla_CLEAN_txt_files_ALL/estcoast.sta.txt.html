[Verse One: N.O.R.E.]
Yo when Snoop and them was kickin buildings down by your fuckin house (WHERE WAS YOU AT?!!!)
Most of y'all was fuckin quiet like a church mouse (I AIN'T HEAR YOU)
They had "New York New York" (New York New York!!!) We had "L.A. L.A." (L.A L.A!!!!)
We had the army fatigues you had the negligee (GIRLS!)
HEY! You see I rep for my city kid (WHAT!!)
And even Biggie said he loved what my niggas did (WHAT!)
Just incase you wanna go and check the record (CHECK IT!!!)
It wasn't Mobb Deep that was CNN's record 
But them Mobb niggas came with us, trash spit flames with us
Nas said he had our back, then he put our name with us
Yeah! It was a east coast victory (Victory!)
It's not a mystery it's east coast history
Drink Champ drink Laga on the beer tip 
Now they dressin funny, they on some queer shit (HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!)
Yeah! I'm on some I don't even care shit
Just stay away from me, fuck the weird shit

East Coast-East-East-East-East Coast-East-East-East-East Coast
East-East-East-East Coast (**Yeah Lil' Fame!-"Notorious B.I.G.") (*BRING 'EM OUT!)

[Verse Two: Lil' Fame] (*Statik Selektah)
I take you back to The Source Awards
Suge Knight said "Come To Death Row" that was way back when (OK!!!)
I sit and think about it, and wondered how the shit would've went
If me and Bill would've wenmt back then 
But fuck that! I'm like an east coast Eazy-E
Nigga the floe is on PCP
You get pistol whipped and stripped (For your shine!) your footage on Forbes DVD
Worldstar and Vlad TV (*FUCK THAT!!!)
Alot of killers in rap over the years though (YEAH!)
We ain't worried 'bout them they all weirdoes (YEAH!)
Might move gorillas we don't hear those (UH UH!)
Frank Ocean ass niggas they all queer though
Y'all ain't fuckin with the kid, Fizz Royal
Half caribbean kid go wild
(AND THIS IS!) East Coast (EAST COAST!) Squeeze toast leave most
In the blood they layin in fuckin with Fame and them

[Chorus: Sample from Lil' Fame] (Lil' Fame) (*Statik Selektah)
