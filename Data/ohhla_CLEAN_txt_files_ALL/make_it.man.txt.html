"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"

[Verse 1: Rainman]
I drip trouble on tracks, spit humbling facts
Live a juggling act, and I stumble on cracks
in a, concrete jungle with a hunger for raps
I see monkeys getting done from the back
Just for something to stack, to get a suiter in the sack
To get credit, get debt - tell me who's the mack
when you're pimped by a system that's high on crack
(Riding the waves) not knowing it'll all fall flat
Filled by philosophies that promise success
And a positive approach to an ominous death
Cos behind their pretty words is an ugly effect
They expand and exploit til' nothing is left
Yet they sense in these words worth more than cents spent
in a book store looking for a self-felt text
Only to be fooled by a guru who's bent
using marketing psychology to pay the fucking rent

[Hook]
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"

"Try'na make a dollar outta what makes sense"
"Try'na make a dollar outta what makes sense"

[Verse 2: Samsonite]
I said I'm god forsaken and got no patience
I rap abrasive for capital cave print
They say you can make it if you pay your way
Never chased the papes though, so fuck the rap rates yo
I'ma Vietnam vet fiending hard for vents
Hungry like a starving army who devoured the dead
Unaccountable, canibals proud that we tred
through the depths of your soul where the spark is kept
And the drama ends when demand is met
Understand the master plan like an architect
The beat thump up in my chest where the cards are kept
Close-range poker-face mate, hard to detect
She sampled the heights that Samsonite stands on
Fire in the belly and a slamming Samsung
Cut from the same cloth, the same cup we drank from
And campaign to maintain, rampage and STAND STRONG

[Verse 3: Rocky Balboa]
The only Jesus I met was spelt with a G
A gut full of death and the peace still free
Examine the master, slick, damage and armour
Park man paranas still out for their laughter (haha....)
Bastards about, south where the sharks are
West where they bite at, west where they fight at
Praying for the rain - I pray for the Rainman
You're raping flesh inside your gay man
Flame to the fortune rout, we torture em' out
Weak spirits mate, we all pouring them out
Out to the gutter, the sewers still sick
That's why a mother fucker like me's a real prick
Deal with it, shit - I'm knowing the idea
I got the blueprint to life on the back of my eyelids
We collect and respect like dogs collect turf (wolf wolf!)
Fuck burning in hell, mate we burn em' ON EARTH

[Hook]
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"
"They say you... They say you can make it
... If it's right, if it's right"

"Try'na make a dollar outta what makes sense"
"Try'na make a dollar outta what makes sense"

[Verse 4: Raman]
It's necessary to bury the planetary committee
to rule you, school you - brain wash and fool you
Who you are is our property, word-wide monopoly
And no fucking slave will ever topple me
So it's probably end-time chronology
Run a scene properly, read demonology
The verse on earth just another slave colony
It's logically right, but the dark might eclipse the light
We desystemise all seeing eyes surrounding it
No doubt on their amount on a counterfeit
And I fit a definitive fixture
Recite tight scripture - lift ya
Slice mics and rip ya, trip ya
Face first fall down the infinite
Someone said I was an inconsiderate citizen
A decedent of the never world brethren
Discovering a ball of chain the devils revel in
