[Intro: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Yo, Metatron look at these mortals
They got like, 20 different demigods crucified to save mankind

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
I'm a general, ya not even a civilian
You faggots lack the heart to tangle with the Sicilian
Meanwhile, ya back at church with ya Benz
With ya preacha man pimp, work you up into a frenzy
When you talk about the church it's a unholy subject
Whether Roman Catholicism or even holy rollers
Just ask Jacques DeMolay or Geoffrey de Charney!
But no subject is taboo for microphone controllers
Jesus had a name: Youshua ben Joseph
His brother's name was James but Christians don't know most of
The story of Christ is mad older than his life
Back in the days there was cats same exact types
The founders of the Roman church had a strange explanation
They said Satan went back in time to create abominations
It's ruler Constantine didn't even believe in it
He only planned to pillage, conquer and enslave with it
History shows us their plan worked out very nice
Pope Leo X said "it has served us well, this myth of Christ!"
Centuries later the pope is still in power in the Vatican
All based upon a myth as real as Luke and Annakin

[Chorus: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Buddha, Dionysius, Quirrinus, Attis
Indra, Adonis, Krishna, Zoroaster
Mithra, Hesus, Sakia, Tamuz
Quexalcote (Alcestos), Promethius (Crite), Thulis (Bali), Osiris/Horus

[Archangel Metatron]
We engulfed by the flames of a, billion questions
While playin' chess wit death, each breath's a blessing
He tryna set dates, manifest fate
Cuz you just another dead weight, he laughs as he checkmates
You sweat hate, prespire fear and fury
I'm not worried, I lay foundations where ya ashes buried
And keep building, stones steeples and spires
Damn half this planet to an ocean of fire
I'm ya belief system, ya weak prism
That bends ya thoughts, got you caught in a web of preached wisdom
I'm a divide, conquer, steal lie and haunt ya
Using a comic book, all about the torture of ya savior
But who's right that other 16 won't save ya, fuck how they raised ya
Ya moms was ignorant, but she ain't know no better
Time to kill this cycle, or let it grow forever

[Chorus]

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Neither the Hebrews nor Egyptians had a devil in it's scriptures
Then man created the devil out of his mind get the picture?
It was after only Zoroaster an the Persians conquered the Hindus
That they felt compelled to make their enemy's Gods into
Devils, even ya minister will say God didn't create him
But the Romans had no problem teaching you to fear and hate him
So ya live ya life avoiding a ghost that don't exist
But I'm about to shine a light on a trick you might have missed
It's like don't live for today you'r a sinner there's no hope
Celebrate death, beware demons and follow the Pope's
Orders to the letter you can trust him he is so clever
Just sell your soul to him and you get to live forever!
Now who's the devil? (Pope John Paul II: Young people of the world,
hear his voice!")

[Archangel Metatron]
Archangels, Let's raise our flamin' swords
For every native, Mason, African and Spanish moore
Who was murdered for not buyin' the Christian advertisment
A Roman symbol of torture and death
That you display wit great pride around your neck
Your fuckin' disgusting, they say you was evil since you was in ya mom's stomach
And the gay preacher that touches children's penises
Will baptize you from nuttin, that's shit's meaningless
So sing ya gospel, like a buncha foolish slaves
But if you shutup, you can hear ya ancestors
In they graves, now I know what you thinking
If Metatron shit's on Christians he shits on my existence
Look in the mirror nigga, the fuck else you want?
Pearly gates? 72 virgins? But it's hell on earth and you still fuckin' burning
So manifest destiny, convert ya savages
The paradigm will shift, I'm a tip the balances
So say I'm wrong, say I'm against God be mad at me
But only thing I'm against, is an ignorant humanity

[Chorus]
