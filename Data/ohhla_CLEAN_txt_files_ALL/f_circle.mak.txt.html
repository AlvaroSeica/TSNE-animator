[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Yeah, this is Ms. Mooncycle
Hitting you again, for the 2000 and beyond
Infinity, and it's all about me, about this time
It's all about you, it's all about I
It's all about we, it's all about...

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Stop the fronting and smiles, are not cutting
All the niggas fronting in my face, saying nothing
So what's going on, this is my song
You know it's all politics, I can't put you on
Don't get mad, you can't flow like Makeba do
On the rise but will never ever shit on you
Hide your fears, over fifteen years
Blood, sweat &amp; tears, fights with my peers
I break beat, I break mics, I break fool
I like to keep it chill, prefer to keep it cool
Some like me hard, will test my charge
Forever remain humble and still reflect God
Still Makeba, I can still Mooncycle
No one before me, it's just their recital
I be the idol, you need to get your shit together
My skills are genuine, and yours are straight pleather
I'm light as a rock, representing on blocks
Half of ya'll is mad, the other half is not
Half of ya'll is mad how I rep the same
And won't fall victim to the previous game
Always yelling fam, your ma, I'm not
You should remember, cuz nobody forgot
Hold your head high, cuz karma is here
There's no more love, and I shed no tears

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
It's all about me, me, me
It's all about I, I, I
You should care about you, you, you
Cuz I'mma care about me, me, me

[Makeba Mooncycle]
You're stuck in spaces, in many places
Many fake embraces, representing racist
But who will chase us, when we wake out of this statious
Heavy as the Earth, I've been wise since birth
The tables done turned, you just got burned
Fast to follow crooked, when I'm straight like a perm
Been in this game, try to teeth, they won't learn
Try to help niggas seems to get me barred
Your only overstanding is greed and not God
You should never use his name in vein, and blame
Pointing fingers and snitching is one in the same
Close your closet, see the skeleton inside you
Riding up your horse and I pass right by you
You don't do the knowledge, you just look-bite
What's on your mind, you can't think, damn
Some find it strange why I always maintain
Always laying on my feet, and still remain the same
The ever so sweet, so humble, so meek
Do you know what I think before I speak
Regulating your reach as I rest at my peak
I'm the one who teach, while you look like freaks
Haha, it's all about me

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
