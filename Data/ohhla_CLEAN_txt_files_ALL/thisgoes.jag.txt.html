[Intro]
This goes out to all them hustlers
Everybody out there making them ends meet
I ain't mad at'cha
JE y'all, this goes out to everybody

This goes out to ya, this goes out to ya 
(This goes out)
This goes out to ya, this goes out to ya 
(I'm telling you this goes out)
This goes out to ya, this goes out to ya
(This goes out, hey)
This goes out to ya, this goes out to ya
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Some people sleep five to a bed
Three at the feet, two at the top
So I really can't talk about how they should live
When I know in my heart, if it came down to it
I'd be getting down the same as them

See Lord, tryna hustle 
Must be something that was heaven sent
A lot of rent, wouldn't it pay 
Without this trade that we call hustlin'

1 -	This goes out to the cats on the corner
	Stressin' and strugglin' just to get a dollar
	I ain't mad at'cha, gotta do something
	Hold your head up cause they can't touch you

	This goes out to the girls in the street
	That going all out just so their kids can eat
	But I ain't mad at'cha, gotta do something
	Hold your head up cause they can't touch you
	This goes out

I used to be at that point
Going on the road doin' things 
That I know just wasn't right
And now I'm looking back
I'm not afraid just tell it
No I never did shut up 
But I can tell you then
I'd rather take a bullet in my head 
Than leave my family unfed
And that's the way it is 
This goes out to my homies, yeah

Repeat 1

[Big Duke]
Uh, uh, uh
Ay yo, I welcome the struggle like I welcome the hustle
Find the right one, take it and bubble, that's on the muscle
I ain't giving in, I'm trying to win
And if I gotta get my hands a little dirty
Then I'm sorry for sin
But the Fed' don't understand, ain't bread
So brothers have to learn and bake to make bread
Chicks use their ass and shake to make bread
But I ain't made at cha' shorty, keep them kids fed

[Joe Blak]
This goes out to my whole 5-81 click
I often reminisce when we just dreamed of this
Rich cars, fine homes, girls with nice tones
Dime pieces standing in line to show us their thongs
Went from riding six deep in a little ass jeep
To Cadillac trucks and Benzes, prowling the streets
We gon' ball 'till we fall cause we fadin' 'em all
Put your glasses in the air, this goes out to y'all

Repeat 1

My homies
You can't touch me
If you don't really know me
This goes out to my homies
You can't touch me
If you don't really know me
This goes out to my homies
You can't touch me
If you don't really know me
This goes out to my homies
You can't touch me
If you don't really know me</pre>
