aye, aye aye
aye carumba (x4)
aye, aye, aye
aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye aye, aye yeah

mi vida loca, coffee colored, strong cup of mocha
the coca cola classic, pass the big bag of motta
heavy smoker, lung choker, always hung over
I run with vulcher's, young dumb and black gun culture
fuck the federali, what's the quickest way to cali
the locals waving at me, I forgot the weight the bag is
my senorita helped me get some shit across the border
I'm room 309 hotel california
donde esta diego, tell him hurry bring the pesos
don't let him see the prego, nothing moves until I say so
detective sanchez is on the move I got to lay low
its friday night party, jumpin' out the winnebago
papas and beer, on this bitch's ass like a lego
(2) coronas, club sandwich easy on the mayo
Omni's present, auz one, keep the game fandango
these mutha fucka's try to juice a nigga like a mango
you know the rules hommie, no money no honeys
these crooked federali's tryin' to get my dough from me
can't buy a drink, bitches think I'm so bummy
rosarito, spring break, damn it's so sunny
you know the rules hommie, no money no honeys
these crooked federali's tryin' to get my dough from me
can't buy a drink, bitches think I'm so bummy
rosarito, spring break, damn it's so sunny

special agent, Omni present, on the mash with auz one
spontaneous adventures often, never been outdone
coppers get outrun
every time I leave the city, positive outcome
shaking ass and titties, she let me smash the kitty
and whether she ugly or pretty, yeah she smashin' with me
passing time, macking dimes
when the line got connected, it was about 6'oclock on the dot when I checked it

six shots of tequila, at the breakfast table
me and Omni with blue prints discussing our record label
la hooda on the mirra, looking for sucka's
we'll drinking in public toss policia $100
no we don't want no chiclets
just me, I want dickless
to be the last niglet to showcase in that picnic
we'll take two tacos and four coronas
Omni's eating popcorn shrimp, poppin' wheely's and poppin' on ya
living with locals, adjusting our vocals
no senor, dont know spanish
but I'll shove dick in your bathtub, my ass in your face look like a sandwich
we vanish, taking taxis in tijuana, hording baby mama's, strippers and prostitutes and pocket pimps
with low backs looking tow back, with ponchos and beanies
flashing my weenie
asking senoritas to rub it and out pops the genie

you know the game homie, no money no honeys
yeah right, like if I had some she would get it from me
my name is molman, bitch not mole dummy
what you laughing at homie, aint a thing funny (x2)

the head hancho, kinda hostel, watchin out for pazanos
never ever ate munido chilling out with my muchachos
the hairs looking spicy mixed cayenne with cilantro from mexico
to munich looking out for the gustapo falling down like dominos,comical
weathar tropical</pre>
