Bet a nigga let off any hammer that my palm rip
Got the loud growin in my yard on some farm shit (On some farm shit!)
Try to front on Montana, Bus and Uncle Murda?!
Get your mother hogtied and your uncle murdered!

[Verse Four: Busta Rhymes]
IIIIIIII!!!!! Don't give a fuck about shit put your guns up!!!!

(STICK 'EM UP!!!) You gettin robbed unless you put your drugs up!
Shots flyin sound like the DJ just turned your drums up!
(WHAT'S UP!) Relax lil' nigga 'fore you get fucked up! 
Or get your face swollen and unbelievably scuffed up! 
You see I lock blocks and control avenues!
Spazzin on the theme music for the animals!
