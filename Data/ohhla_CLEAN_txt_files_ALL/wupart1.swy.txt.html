[Cappadonna talking]
Cappadonna up in here maintainin'
Big Prince know what I'm sayin'
Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef, Jon ya know

[Cappadonna]
It's like fifty Stapleton, Don fifty Park Hill
All of y'all other crab niggas better chill
What, Stapleton, Park Hill organization
Death threat, we cover square inches of the nation
Avoid confrontation by all means necessary
Gold chains and gold teeth is definitely mandatory
When you come through Tony Touch territory
The burial ground sounds become a whole different story
Acapell jobs are fat jobs
New Cappadonna have props for years
On the intercom, my outcome, no they couldn't get none
Cause I wreck mics for fun
Casually flowin' smack me if I'm not knowin'
Give em' a chance to understand what they hearin'
Lick shots ya better maintain ya military bearin'
Cause in 97 Illuminati carry glocks
But I can't afford to forfeit cause I was born to rock they knots
Danger if you ever want more anger
Bring ya whole drive by family into my chamber
Don is more maculate, Rae is more maculate
Ghost is more maculate, Prince came to tackel it
Who holdin' me down, 96 representin' for 97
All night grove right here
