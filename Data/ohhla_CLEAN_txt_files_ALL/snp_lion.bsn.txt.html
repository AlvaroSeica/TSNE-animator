Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ye it's so cold in the motherfucking D
I'm talking real cold man I'm talking about June 19 motherfucking 86
On a west side off 8 mile road
Living with my pops while he was working at a motherfucking post office
Right around the corner I was working at McDonalds
Getting up in the morning doing that breakfast shift
I was so cold in the motherfucking eggs, they call me young eggs
I mean I had it locked and loaded I was gonna fuck around and go to school out there
To the coaches wanted me to come to Cody High and play basketball
And do my thing, but you know what man, the experience I had in Detroit was a hell of an experience man
'Cause it shaped me, it molded me, it grew me
I came back from Detroit I was new and improved
I remember I wrote me a song, I said I went to Detroit to make my move a more track
Now I'm back and I'm new and improved
That's how I came back from Detroit you understand me I was new and improved
So all to my folks out there in the D, it's so motherfucking cold from the west side to the east side
Y'all know what it is, I used to stay on white street on the east side
Right by the east line mall you dig
So I mean I'm well routed, and tutored and suited and booted
Part of the D, it's part of the G and the LBC
This is Big Snoop Dogg, Big Sean you know what it is
Detroit, let's go</pre>
