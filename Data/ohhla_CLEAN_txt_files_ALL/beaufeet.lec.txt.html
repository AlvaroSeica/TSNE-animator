[Verse 1]
Carlos was born in killa cali was walking down an alley
and caught a bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly.
He lost everything at that moment except his life
he lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
he laid there in a coma but man nobody cared
the Gospel preached in his neighborhood? Nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
a missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
back to hood you could find em preaching the bible 
He led a homie to Christ from his same hood
part of Church plant come on now aint his name good
This is blessing but Im stressing that this is not the norm
we need leaders and belivers to help carry it on
but who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if Jesus is calling you that you would be found

[Verse 2]
Eric used to go to bible study as a kid
he got older and started doing what the hood did
a rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
but the jammed up so them beat him nice
he woke up in the hospital singing bible songs
praise God he had a place to learn the bible from
but then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ
they make him change his whole culture and way of life
he gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
go to seminary by then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth
and used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
the feet are beautiful if only they'd go
if aint nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
somebody please plant a church in his projects.

[Verse 3]
In Luke 4:16 on down to 21
jesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one
But more than that he quotes Isaiah
that shows our savior targets oppressed captive blind and the broke I'm saying
had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
and 1st John 2:6 is way we should go
In Dueteronomy even tho they under the law
the tithes every third year the poor got em all
I aint sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
Im sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
man if you aint burdened please pick up your word and
tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
we bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdend to have beautiful feet
you never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to God you'd be burdened for beautiful feet
Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet)
Go, go, go
You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world
They can't believe in something they ain't never heard
Go, go, go and run with those beautiful feet</pre>
