Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I don't know how else to keep it
So I'm a keep it one hundred (hundred)
I didn't mean to get your hopes up
I was thinking that's what I wanted
Kicked-flipped the script on ya
Betcha never seen this one comin'
I'm changing like autumn
Gotchu heated up like summer

[Chorus]
I can't say I'm not impressed with you
I'm not ready to invest
I can't say I'm not the girl for you
I just might not be her yet
Feels like all this pressures on me right now
Like I don't have a choice
Know this much, you can be sure that this
Ain't about no other boy

[Chorus]
Cus if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you..
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'm a come see you..
Somethin' always brings me back to you

It's not love but it's something like that
It ain't love but it's something like that
It's not love but it's something like that
Boy it's complicated..

[Verse 2]
Now I can tell you're disappointed
Looking at me like we twisted
Tryna figure out where my head at
Everything I told you I meant it, (meant it)
Bet you thinking I'm real free now?
But I'm feeling somethign different
You act like you don't understand boy
Why don't you just listen?

[Chorus]
I can't say I'm not impressed with you
I'm not ready to invest
I can't say I'm not the girl for you
I just might not be her yet
Feels like all this pressures on me right now
Like I don't have a choice
Know this much, you can be sure that this
Ain't about no other boy

[Chorus]
Cus if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you..
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'm a come see you..
Somethin' always brings me back to you

It's not love but it's something like that
It ain't love but it's something like that
It's not love but it's something like that
Boy it's complicated..

[Chorus]
I can't say I'm not impressed with you
I'm just not ready to invest
I can't say I'm not the girl for you
I just might not be her yet
Feels like all this pressures on me right now
Like I don't have a choice
Know this much, you can be sure that this
Ain't about no other boy

[Chorus: x2]
Cus if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you..
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'm a come see you..
Somethin' always brings me back to you</pre>
