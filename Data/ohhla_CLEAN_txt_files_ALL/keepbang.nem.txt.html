Uhh, y'all motherfuckers kill me B
Talkin gangster, when the truth of the matter is
You ain't a murderer, you ain't a thug, you ain't a burglar
What they call you? I never heard of ya
Probably a perjurer; met your Mom Dukes and now I'm servin her
What they call you? I never heard of ya

Listen fam-a-lam, you won't see my hammer jam
When it hits you niggaz seein your stomach like sonograms
Damn!! Understand, I'm the motherfuckin man bitch
Leave you fucked up like a tomato soup sandwich
Cast his whole damn clique, right in between the smacks
You straight pussy nigga, go get your bikini wax
Bitches I be with - straight fly like venus traps
Been live for a minute, but now the king is back
So basically, when I say, you die
Cause when the goonies come you'll cop please like "HEY YOU GUYS"
Smokin haze in that smoke gray new 5
Can't see me cause the AK shoots eyes
And I, and I, demand some respect
Black bandana over the face, holdin the tec
Don't worry told ya it'd be over in a sec
when you catch this whole round in your shoulder and your neck

[Chorus]
(Keep bangin!) You ain't a murderer, you ain't a thug, you ain't a burglar
What they call you? I never heard of ya
You, probably a perjurer; you girl was at my show, now I'm hurtin her
What they call you? I never heard of ya
(Keep bangin!) You ain't a murderer, you ain't a thug, you ain't a burglar
What they call you? I never heard of ya
You, probably a perjurer; met you last week, my man was herbin ya
What they call you? I never heard of ya
(Keep bangin!)

[Nems]
When it's crunch time, niggaz don't want mine
I'm in a class by myself like the teacher during lunch time
Take out your whole squad with one line
Cause my niggaz don't rap, but you can hear they gun rhyme
Catch you by the knife, you won't make it to the sunshine
Catch you by the light, steal your watch, take your son's shine
Niggaz like you be callin up one time
Youse a lil' nigga, I'll knock you out with a punch-line
After that I'll hit yo' chick with the fatty
In yo' crib wit'cho kid askin if I'm his daddy
I told the lil' faggot "NAH, but a G is in the place"
Rolled up the Garcia Vega, blew the weed all in his face
I guess he caught a contact, pissin in his bed
While his mother's in the next room, deliverin the head
You the type of nigga that be snitchin to the feds
Call my gun No. 2 cause it hits you with the lead

[Chorus]
(Keep bangin!) You ain't a murderer, you ain't a thug, you ain't a burglar
What they call you? I never heard of ya
You, probably a perjurer; met your Mom Dukes and now I'm servin her
What they call you? I never heard of ya
(Keep bangin!) You ain't a murderer, you ain't a thug, you ain't a burglar
What they call you? I never heard of ya
You, probably a perjurer; you girl was at my show, now I'm hurtin her
What they call you? I never heard of ya
(Keep bangin!)

[Nems]
