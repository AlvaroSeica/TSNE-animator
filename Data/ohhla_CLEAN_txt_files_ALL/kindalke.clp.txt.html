[Intro]
Til the casket drops
Third times a charm right?
Ha ha ha
Come on!

[Verse One: Pusha-T]
I'm kinda like a big deal
It's +Unbelievable+ you see my +Warning+ gives you B.I.G. chills
The flow runnin' on B.I.G.'s heels
My +Life After Death+, B.I.G. ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's a charm baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessin' to blow a hundred thou in a recession
With no second guessin,
Ha ha we're ballin', drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin'
Re-up is the Gang and I'm all in
To the powder &amp; the flame I have fallin'
Get money blow money is my callin'
Yea! Watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!

[Chorus]
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal...

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
Ay yo I'm sittin' on top of the-
It's more than a feeling ain't it?
I be killin' dame it, I'm illin' and I'm illin' -
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular
Go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be
Spittin' fire on the PJ in my PJ's
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like TJ
Y'all ain't peep how I said Marshalls, replay
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, +Got It Made+
Special Ed got head from a girl in special ed
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
"What happen Tisha, your boyfriend cum fast?"
Turn around gimme pound like we folks
"Hell no I went raw dog, three strokes"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Malice]
Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself is a damn distraction
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I be hoppin' the ring, niggas should cash in
It's like stoppin' a train,
Nigga think he's stoppin my reign
Talk slick while droppin' my name?
I'm puttin' y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits I X out the middle man
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies &amp; gentle-man, introducin'
The C4S with the rims protrudin'
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you sow

[Chorus]</pre>
