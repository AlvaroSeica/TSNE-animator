Song:   Hold Up
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus: Mr. Marcelo &amp; (Erica Fox) - 2x]
Y'all niggas better hold up (hold up)
These southside niggas got it sewed up (sewed up)
Little boys better slow y'all roll
Fuck around and get soldier exposed

[Mr. Marcelo]
Nigga it's tragic, soon as I up my plastic
Out of my elastic, come in just start blasting
Magnolia assassin, yeah that's me
Tuff Guy nationwide wouldn't put it past me
Tried out rapping, nigga you will never out last me
Come back and try to dap me, but never out cast me
Still look classy, T.V.'s off in the dash
Diamond rings around my neck and wrist I still look flashy
Busting they ass, slow down he going too fast
In a D or Monte with no tints on the glass
Hoes reaction, where this nigga popped up from
Meca jeans, bout cream, Magnolia son
I told y'all boys, fucking with a rolla boy
Shake the dice three times, and roll y'all boys
We throw y'all boys, you shady, need to roll y'all boys
Do it, renew it, come back and entrepreneur it
When the gun blast niggas tend to run like fluid
Get with it nigga, uh

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mr. Marcelo]
Killas, jackers and robbers, that's all I know
So I could buck like fuck it meet the desperado
No role models, I sip hen out the bottle
Called a couple of rivals, so I tote a rifle
If it's beef I dog it, fuck it, I did what I had to
Ain't gone say that I was glad, but I damn sure wasn't mad
Bloody a nigga's shirt, put in a little work
Fussing is minimum, fake niggas I'm sending em
Caps get peeled is real when I ain't got to tell you
Like don't you say if you fake I smack you
Nigga I dare you, my pistol stay close in hand
Red beam on your chest you the chosen man
I be the last to stand, but the first to bust
Don't have to worry bout the laws all they seen was dust
All black, camouflage hat to the back
In case they saw that, I'm reloading my gat
Hand it back to my homes smoking kissing my chrome
Tell them, thank you much for not missing your dome
When it's on, it's on and when it's over, it's over
I run with TRU desperados and uptown soldiers

Yeah, real shit, got to love that shit
Check it, new millennium

[Chorus - 2x]

(talking with Erica Fox vocalizing)
Them Tuff Guys baby, and we busting loose
Believe that, staying over the field at all times
That new millennium shit, roll with it or get rolled over
Y'all niggas better watch out</pre>
