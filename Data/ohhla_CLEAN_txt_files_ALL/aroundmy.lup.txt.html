[Intro]
Yeah! Great american! rap resurrecccccccctttttttttt!!!!
Rest in peace Young M! Pourin live from the, sound
Uh! POURIN LIVE FROM THE SET! YEAH!

[Verse One]
First off say peace to Pine Ridge
Shame to all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids 
To rap bells in small cells keepin they mind big
Say everything's hostile, suicide bombers 
And prosperity gospel, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pourin out they nostrils
They got to, just to stay awake
On the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a hand bag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, Fema trailors, human body, sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cost a non stripper mad dash
A friend request, a follow and a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a gas mask
Purple Jordan's or that mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the rat-a-tat
'Cause that's just more dinosaur for the Cadillacs

[Chorus]
Live from the other side what you see?!
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on earth is what I need
When I feel I'm in hell everytime I breathe
Pourin live from the other side what you hear?!
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free 'specially 'round my way

[Verse Two]
And! We! Marvel at the state of art of man
And turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin garbage man
If you ain't know you part and parcel of the probah lam
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescense is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary is.....manifested 
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustlin ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly uneffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin it's similar to separate 
To me, the truth is more fulfillin than the method 
Of findin really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowin out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you Pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
'Cause the Horn of Africa's now starvin to death!

[Chorus]
Live from the other side what you see?!
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on earth is what I need
When I feel I'm in hell everytime I breathe
Pourin live from the other side what you hear?!
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free 'specially 'round my way

[Verse Three]
In all white Los Angeles the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raisin' babies in spa six
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit, ghost town
Monopoly's on poverty where d boy coke bound
It's parts of Manila like the video for Thriller
But the U.S. Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate, and privilege vanilla
Then what's the flavor of the sunday preacher's pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas!!!
There's classrooms everywhere around me with a....
Here where you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers 
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the Midler
Of the extreme of America's dream
Froy find Neo, Freddy Krueger rep from Rainman

[Chorus]
Live from the other side what you see?!
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on earth is what I need
When I feel I'm in hell everytime I breathe
Pourin live from the other side what you hear?!
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free 'specially 'round my way

[Outro]
