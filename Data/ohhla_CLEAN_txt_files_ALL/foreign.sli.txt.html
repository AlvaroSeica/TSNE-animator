Song:   Foreign Land
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When you're rolling through the streets of the foreign land
You never notice where you are but do the best that you can
So the losers always lose and the winners win
The one is gonna keep his head up high is the one you depend on
And we ain't got to wait for her so long
And we ain't got to right what once was wrong

And you're out there on the road and you're rollin through
The places that you know you've been before, and the ones that are new
And though you've seen a million lights, and the faces too
And knowin you can find the one you want once the night is all through
And we ain't got to wait for her so long
And while were gone and we say you know it keeps us strong</pre>
