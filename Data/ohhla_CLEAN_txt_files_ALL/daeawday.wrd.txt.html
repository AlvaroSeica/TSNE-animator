[Werd]
Back again Alude Reekie mate

[Wardie Burns]
It's Wardie

[Werd]
Werd and Wardie who, who
Its Werd and Wardie so sorry
Had to come and tell you that we daein' it aw day
Rock like a quarry thought that we taught you
So please stand back we are having a party [x2]

[Werd]
It's S.O.S.
Cunt you ken who it is its fucking Wardie and Werd
And you wish you where here like a holiday card
In this game of rap check what level we at
Without selling all the crack or fucking yelling out brap
I'm making lines like a game of Tetris
Christ so good even kings want to check it
And check my logos you won't get this
The copyrights pending like it hangs on a necklace
Yes and I dont change when I rap now
My idea was stay Scottish no back down
You say that it's whacked out fuck it get whacked out
Like junkies going clean al be putting the smack down
So dont act clown I'm sipping on Buckfast
And at the same time trying to make a few buck fast
Yeah and you just aint got the bottle
So fuck your life and that's my new motto

Its Werd and Wardie so sorry
Had to come and tell you that we daein' it aw day
Rock like a quarry thought that we taught you
So please stand back we are having a party [x2]

[Wardie Burns]
It's Wardie Burns
Cunt in Leith Edinburgh I was born and raised
Crashing hip hop gigs up at the Corn Exchange
We used to get drunk and fucking storm the stage
And wake up freezing in the cells with my morning rage
But now I'm back cunt back on the right track
And with Werd on song you know I rap on the right track
No error it seems fuck American dreams
Because we are the new Scottish nightmare see the terror and scream
Cunt its Wardie and Werd and you've probably heard
S.O.S. makes a racket with a quality serve
Al drink a pint of hennessy until it whips my memory
See I'm the kind of cunt that hates his mate and likes his enemies
Anyway I run and snatch like I'm Brick-Top
My hip hop shits so tight like a slip knot
I shit not kid start believing the facts
S.O.S. the Burghs finest and we will leave it at that

[Werd]
Werd and Wardie so sorry
Had to come and tell you that we daein' it aw day
Rock like a quarry thought that we taught you
So please stand back we are having a party
Werd and Wardie we will stomp you
Fuck you cunts man give me a Johnny
Werd and Wardie we dont want you
So say something mate or come see us in Porty</pre>
