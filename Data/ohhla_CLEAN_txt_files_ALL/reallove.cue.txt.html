[Fingazz (Angel Rodriguez)]
Hey, girl
Don't you know
When it's priced almost anything
Money can't
Buy, real, love (So real)

[Lil' Cuete]
(Verse 1)
I see you everyday, but you never look at me
You're always lookin' good, but you look unhappy
Tell me why you choose to live like this
If you were mine
I'd never make you feel like this
You need a man, not someone that's gonna hurt you
You need to let him go
He doesn't deserve you
And when I say, "I'll make you happy," it's true
Or you can stay with your man and get your heart broke in two
But
Here's my number, call me up if you want
And when you feel lonely
You can roll through my spot
See
I ain't trippin', homie's loss is my gain
Nobody knows it til he say, "Cause I'm ahead of the game"

Pre-Chorus: Lil' Cuete
Cause I'm a king, what I need is a queen
I could have a million dollars, but it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich, but I'll tell you one thing
I can give you happiness than money can bring
And that's real

Chorus: Fingazz (Angel Rodriguez)
Oooh, I don't drive, a
Fancy car
No diamond in my pinky ring 
Man, I make enough, to
Get me buy
From the love of material things
But hey, girl
Don't you know
When it's priced almost anything
Money can't
Buy, real, love (So real)

(Verse 2)
I wanna be your only one, and you could be mine, too
Cause baby
I'm goin' crazy when I think about you
I get excited when I see you come through
Nobody else ever made me feel the way that you do
I need a woman, not a girl, not just someone to [{*fuck*}]
I don't mean no disrespect
But that's what's up
Hah hah
I see you smile when I talk like that
It seems like it's been a while since you smiled like that
But
Maybe we could kick it, you know, spend a little time
Sit down, one-on-one, I'll let you know what's on my mind
I know a good thing when I see it, and I see it in you
So tell me what I gotta do to make you feel the same too

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Angel Rodriguez
That's all I've got to give
My heart and soul to you
Only way I wanna live
Sharing each moment with you
Take it fast, take it slow, girl
You know it's real this time (So real)
Don't let, true love, pass you by
Baby

Repeat Chorus

[Angel Rodriguez]
So real (Real...)</pre>
