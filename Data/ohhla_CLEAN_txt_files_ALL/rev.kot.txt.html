Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Taxman]
Daddy X is like a REBEL! He's a fuckin rebel
I'm like god damn, you gotta have big time revolution for that

[Daddy X]
the revolution will not be televised..
RIGHT-you say you're right
I say you're wrong
You destroy lives
You build the bombs
Spend all your lives
I say we're spun
You call it war, it's just begun

Revolution..[x13]

We fight with thoughts, you fight with guns
You make the laws, fill all you jails
Fill us with fear, that's where you fail.. that's where you fail!

Revolution..[x18]

Lies, power, destruction, a world of corruption
Corrupting, and control, tell yourself its all LIES
The thoughts they keep exploding
And the earth is eroding; they keep on reloading and firing LIES
They stand they salute and they cheer and they shoot down men and ladies
I could puke on this earth, with all their LIES
So what will it take for this earth to break?
for people to awake a realize.. its all LIES
they got us believing by always deceiving
and what we're receiving is nothing but LIES!

[D-Loc]
Increase all the peace; we need to stop all wars
Innocent people are dying for no reason what for?
The country keeps makin the bombs we keep dropping
We're killin each other we the people can stop them
Who they tryin to fool? We're the leaders of the new school
We fight for our rights, realize the governments of of LIES
Don't ask us why? You can see it in our eyes
Who is he? Who is she? You got my screaming to myself LIES!

[Johnny Richter]
Its all in your face while their laughing inside
Tell you whatchya wanna hear
but its just a bunch of LIES!
Taxes Highest to help the Senior citizens
Social Security and Help Benefits being questioned
Its all bullshit its just a big scam
Uncle Sam got us fightin family wars up over land
Weapons of mass destruction, Yo where they at?
How Many Souljaz gotta die before we bring Americas Kids back!

Lies, Revolution [x4]

[Daddy X]
This is a freedom song, songs of freedom
Stand up for you rights
Right means not wrong
1 life 1 chance 1 earth 1 people
you decide?

RIGHT-you say you're right
I say you're wrong
You destroy lives
You build the bombs
Spend all your lives
I say we're spun
You call it war, it's just begun

Revolution..[x13]

Now we take it back, Slaves of us all
We will attack, sick of the lies
The lies and their hate
Sick of it all, ??
Its coming your way

Revolution..[x13]

Its coming your way, the revolution will not be televised </pre>
