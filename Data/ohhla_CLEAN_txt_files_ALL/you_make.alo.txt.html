Song:   You Make Me Smile
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

you make me smile
baby
uhm, you make me smile

I think its safe to say
things just havent been going my way
no work coming in so my money's spent
and I still got bills to pay
but through it all you're right here with me
when im sinking, oh, you come through and lift me
its nothing more then the love that you give me
keeps me from drowning in tears

you make me smile
oh, you make me smile
come through and save the day
you make me smile
you make me smile
in a very special way

everywhere I go
people keep and ask me
where i'd get my joy why am I so happy
in these trying times when a frown is the fashion
I'm beaming like the sun now how can that be
see the answer to the query is very simple
I'm always grinning from dimple to dimple
because you love me unconditionally
my happiness is heartsake
now cant you see

(where do we go)
[spoken words]

you make me smile
oh, you make me smile
come through and save the day
you make me smile
you make me smile
in a very special way</pre>
