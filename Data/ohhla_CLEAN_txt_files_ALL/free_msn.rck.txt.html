[Rick Ross]
This is for the soldiers.. that see the sun at midnight, ya dig?
Let me slow down {"It's so incredible!"}

I go in the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols speak in cryptic code
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of Gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal (WOO!)
Uh, it's just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason, freelancer
Free agents, we faster
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All white mansion, I'm the child of God
All black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga
All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga (nigga)
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK (AY)
So, so I JFK
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing, so fuck it I'll do it mentally

[Chorus 2X: Rick Ross]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God we never die

[Jay-Z]
Yeah.. yeah
Niggas couldn't do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I would have preferred niggas squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don't know who to trust
Whole world want my demise; turn the music up
Hear me clearly: if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me; fuck all these fairy tales
Go to Hell, this is God engineerin'
This is a Hail Mary pass, y'all interferin'
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check y'all appearance 
... Bitch, I said I was amazin'
... Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows he forgave him
Bitch I'm red-hot, I'm on my 3rd 6
But a devil I'm not; my Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet, keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker: it's Hov, just say you love it

[Chorus]

[John Legend]
If I ever die
Never let it be said I didn't win
Never, never say
Never say Legend didn't go in (I'mma go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Making love to my favorite girl
Making beautiful music, we making a movie
We knew we was born to do it

[Chorus]</pre>
