Song:   She Took All My Money
Typed by: PremRock

Lady liqs you shady bitch
She make me sick right
Someday I'd like to take my fist right to her windpipe
I'd never hit a woman
But if you know what she's doin
you'd reconsider to and
Look at all she ruined
No matter what I'm always back up on her doorstep
Fresh set of roses trying to coax her back my rest
smell her up on my breath
Every time I feel the stressed
She took it all
Every last red cent
and the last rent check
All weekend spent wrecked
with her
Can you believe it? I fell for the tricks up her sleeve
She is So deceiving... I'm seething I'm gone  I'm leaving
I shoulda been doing this, I coulda been doin that
Instead I'm with you not doing shit at my pad
I wish you, wish you, wish you, wish you leave me alone
In the morning all I got is your receipt and you gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
My resentment is strong

(Chorus 2X)

One shot, 2 shot, 3 shot Four
I gave her everything that she wanted and much more
Every time I turn my back
Take a call
Or burn a match
She learning a diff. trick to pin me further to the mat

You're the reason I am late
My Visa, my escape
The reason for the amnesia I'm feeling,
But still Im feeling great!!
Lady Liqs you shady bitch
How you get away with this
Make me wanna. make me wanna make me wanna
Cash in my change
And do away with this
Feeling of sobriety, prying me from piety
I seen your ways you spying me
Liar, Liar.. Absinthe on fire higher power
Let's write it down like Dear Diary
I swear gonna leave right after this Whiskey Sour
Staring at the hourglass
drowning in your sour mash
How long will your power last???
It's anybody's guess
I am mesmerized by the time that we spend intertwined
And in miiiiiiiiiiiiiind
Girl I don't really have the time
Agave barley or hops
Can I borrow a dollar ?
For tomorrow Scotch holler!
If not I probably drop
But she cares not
She knows I'll find a way
Go away she knows I won't
I'm always inclined to stay

Chorus (2X)
One shot, 2 shot, 3 shot Four
I gave her everything that she wanted and much more
Every time I turn my back
Take a call
Or burn a match
She learning a diff. trick to pin me further to the mat

I said I'm gone
My resentment is strong
But still I hate it really cuz I don't really hate you at all
And Everytime I'm going out I got to keep you involved
I had enough of her act
She calls my bluff and I'm back
The oldest trick in the book
She's slick, she's a crook
Thinks she's a queen and steady plays the kid like a Rook
Now Im sitting on the floor just look at all that she took
The reason I sing the blues
Laying here feeling used
My ego foreever bruised
Relationship's ina daze hazy I feel confused</pre>
