Yeah, uh, uh, I thought it came in right there and I got fooled
Joke's on you Chuck
There you go...

[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
I never had a stain on my shirt
I'm Pine Sol pine needle clean in the dirt
I got the works
I work the full shift full of work
Not work, work
But I shelf boxes of hotness
Don't drop it
Materials of value in them boxes
Don't box me
Sugar Ray Leonard to them Boxes
Watch me not watch them
I'm like clockwork
Charles got a Flava Flav clock on his shirt
And it tick tock tick tock tick when it work
Pick mine, get twist mine, Jack it'll work
I got a smiley face have a nice day t-shirt
Mikey said you should wear it at our next concert
And... it's a poster of The Kids on the CD insert
Hands in the air even if your arms don't work
The Cool Kids banging on the speakers in your system
Me and Mikey present: "When Fish Ride Bicycles"

[Chorus]
Every time I kicks it raw
You know we too legit to fall [word]
Of course you can get some more [hell yeah]
But only if you get the door [get, get it]

It's the deliveryman  but I ain't order that
It's the deliveryman  but I ain't order that
It's the deliveryman  but I ain't order that

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Add a little change to the pocketbook
I can shake each and every hand on an octopus
In the time it takes to blink  tick tock it took
6 seconds just to get the -ish poppin
Drop the hook
Let me drop a hint
I rhyme in tsunamis and this is just a drop of it
If you DJ you should get a drop of this
I could be talkative if I like what the topic is
If it's broke, gotta fix it
If I'm not a whiz kid at it
Then I guarantee that my partner is
Show me where the sockets is
I don't even need a toolbox
Give me a wrench and 15 minutes
And I'll having it kicking like it had 6 speeds in it
I'm a 10 speed and my gears keep on clicking
My ears hear things that I can't even mention
Oh was that just part of the invention
I go bananas before I let the monkey throw the wrench in
Now that I got your attention
Old folks still waiting on your pension
I'm your new landlord just call me when the rent's in

[Chorus]</pre>
