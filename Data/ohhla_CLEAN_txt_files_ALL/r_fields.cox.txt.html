[Vast Aire Kramer]
Yeah, know what I'm sayin
Think you got it figured out by now
Yo, yo

If first you don't succeed try, try again
Step up to the mic and die again
This is the next lifetime and you wanna battle
Either you like reincarnation or the smell of carnations
The sample's the flesh and the beat's the skeleton
You got beef but there's worms in your Wellington
I'll put a hole in your skull and extract your skeleton
Oh my God, said a word twice, Vast Aire, I'm twice as nice
You get caught up, in my blade, might get diced
The flesh is dangerous here
Yo, hahaha, yo, it's Can O, yo
If first you don't succeed try, try again
Step up to the mic and die again
This is the next lifetime and you wanna battle
Either you like reincarnation or the smell of carnations
The sample's the flesh and the beat's the skeleton
You got beef but there's worms in your Wellington
I'll put a hole in your skull and extract your gelatin
Mustard seed faith move mountains
This is jailhouse rap, rock hard
Like faces in a cell block
You'll catch a Kennedy curse from the speedknot
Son, I mack cause I think different
Plus your girl's sex technology, I wanna plug in
Now every golden egg my goose lay stay golden
With your poker face, I punch you in the stomach and you folded
Folded, f-f-folded, folded, f-f-fo-fo-

Yo, see what happens
Fuck with the wrong people
You might get dragged into a kitchen, and cut up
This is for real right here, Def Jux right here
I'm serious, yo, Vordul Megilah

[Vordul Megilah]
Yo, uh
Spit with lyrics, that spill off the grill nasty
Off the top, live five, fancy
Fly mic strapped with nozzles
Blowin Earth's color through a nostril
Apostle that write novels with thoughts, mega hostile
Ready to pop you, venomous snakes out the Congo
With through these clear optics
Yo, with large, I'll watch you
Rap in the coldest winters, strapped with
All sorts of snorkels attached to hoods that pull over Motorola goggles
We pigeons equipped, with talons to twist, split owls
Now watch me, skate off the scene with a mongoose
Pop a Willie and, I'll leave you deuce bottles of
Frozen rhyme juice
Smoke bubble gum while munchin on Milanos
We crazy, off the head, lazy
Blaze emcees, amaze with degrees
On a higher level, in-spire devil to leave
God cypher alone, bomb pipes on bones
Architect when I write these poems, write these poems, write these poems</pre>
