[CHORUS]
We're gonna rock on top tonight
We're gonna rock on top tonight
We're gonna rock on top tonight
We're gonna rock on top tonight [on top of the world] (x2)

I'll take a raider saber from both end of the equator
And walk without a compass to rock the whole circumference
To keep you out your seats and reach just like a tooth-
Brush, then watch the dudes rush the DJ booth
I hold mic control with the slightest Midas touch
And keep it goin til the mornin or the mic blows up
I've been fresh
Before my first single was pressed
Four italians, but no medallions, around my neck
I keep it off my chest like a cardiac
Arrest, no heart attack from stress
Let's, keep it intact like tour dates on the map
Let me see for myself and prove the fact
That, the world ain't flat break out the welcome mat
On top of Mount Fuji eatin sushi
We ride on 747's not DC-10's
We took a two-week vacation and we'll do it again

[CHORUS]

Gonna take a trip around the globe, we're leavin tomorrow
For Guadalajara then Mount Kilamanjaro
I gotta get my passport put it in my Jansport
Headed for the airport to get on the transport
I can't wait to hit the beach in Waikiki
And fall into the romantic enchantment of the Tiki
With the chick in Indonesia to a Russian ballerina
Or the girl from Ipanema baby step in the arena
Ladies in Latin America call me Andy
And tell me that the Ugly Duckling sound is muchos grande
We also have listeners from Tokyo to Seoul
And the whole SOuth Pole where they're keepin it cold
I heard that bootleg on record in the UK
That some can't be rock on top like a toupee
Snackin on a honey-roasted peanut from the flight
Tell you what we're gonna do tonite, come on!
[CHORUS]

Rock on top
Rock on top
Rock on top
Rock on top tonight</pre>
