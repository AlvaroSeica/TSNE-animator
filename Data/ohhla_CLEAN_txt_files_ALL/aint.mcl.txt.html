{*cut and scratched*}
Ain't no other, this is me and this is it
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

[MC Lyte]
When I begin to define my wiggidy wild style
It's somewhat difficult to explain to a child
You're not skilled with the quickness
Then we best just forget this
But I proceed, indeed for the ones that can hang
The ones who appreciate the way I do my thang
I go all out with the BLAOW, I flip and rip emcees up
The styles that I use, they confuse, cause I'm that tough
Because the track is sick I never slack cause I'm quick
I'm not whack, I'm slick, I've been known to flick emcees like a Bic
and continue - who's next on the menu?
Who's at the venue? Grab your steel and maybe then you
can hang out with the bros, not the hoes, at the real show
Come smell my moral{?} my moral is the smell of dough
Legal funds, I choose to live the righter way
I'm not jerkin but I'm workin 24 night and, day

{*cut and scratched 3X*}
Ain't no other, this is me and this is it
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

[MC Lyte]
So let me in - Rin Tin Tin
Or I'll huff and I'll puff and blow the motherfucker in
Games, can't be played, so fuck the charade
Recess is over and done, it's time to be paid
Ounce for ounce, I want 'nuff checks to bounce
Signature for sure, cash in large amounts
Fuck the smilin, and profilin
MONEY AIN'T ON TIME the Lyte start buckwhylin
You can ask my partner Dink I'm about my rhyme
It ain't fiction line for line
Check my diction!
Cause I be rippin it back YOOOO
I keep it rockin and I'm rollin over small things
Pockets are full, I got pull, and ain't down with no drug ring
Legal funds, I choose to live the righter way
I ain't jerkin, but I'm workin, 24, night and day

{*cut and scratched 4X*}
Ain't no other, this is me and this is it
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

{*MC Ricky D scratch - "Okay"}

[MC Lyte]
Quick to draw, no flaws, I got the raw shit
They pop bad, wish they never had and forfeit
I look out for mines, just the moves, I ain't braggin
I ain't for that Droop-a-long, Hop-a-long the bandwagon
I ain't down with no tipsters
High post like most but I ain't no dipster
In other words, I like 'em when I meet 'em
I just ain't the type to be lovin 'em and leavin 'em!
I give any and all and everything I got
You fuck up once, the shit is shot Hobbes~!
I'm too compatible to be taken for granted
You'll be left ALONE if you try to do me damage
Legal funds, I choose to live the righter way
I'm not jerkin, but I'm workin 24 night and day

{*cut and scratched 4X*}
Ain't no other, this is me and this is it
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

"Ain't, no other, this, is it"
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

{*cut and scratched 2X*}
Ain't no other, this is me and this is it
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

"Ain't no other, this is me"
Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip

{*"Got to get the crowbar to get you up off of my tip" as the song fades*}</pre>
