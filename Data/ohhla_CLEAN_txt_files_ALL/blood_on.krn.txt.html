(*talking*)
All around the world, ha
Na-na-na, that's what they said
Come on, bring it na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na

[K-Rino]
Time to introduce the world, to the pandemic releaser
Slide you decline you, cut you up like a Visa
In dramatic fashion, cadavers in the attic stashing
When I ring a rappers neck, it look like I be cabbage patching
Ha after the whooping, I left a crook in the oven cooking
I stole my own rhyme book, when I wasn't looking
I found out, and the consequences were costly
You shoulda saw what I did, to myself when I caught me
They say I got better after 40
Boy you bout to get your ass whooped, like a male stripper at a bachelor party
Obsessive compulsive disorder's, what it's seeming like
Repetitive torture, I start over till I think it's right
Think it's right (think it's right), think it's right ok now it's right
Went from South Park to Antarctica, in a hour flight
These boys dirty, they done broke too many laws
Next year, these rappers gon' be on stage in skinny draws

[Chorus - 2x]
Now everybody is saying, they got the top spit
Until I show up, and run em off of the block quick
Face down on the ground, slugs all around
Your favorite rapper was found, with blood on his crown

[K-Rino]
Go find somebody weaker to dump on
I'll write a verse in five minutes, greater than a song you worked a month on
I won't dump on you chump, unless you jump
My paragraphs are tighter, than a blood pressure pump
If you don't wanna mind, I'll force you
I won't drag you across the ground, I'll drag the ground across you
Describe every tribal move, I'll do
Dial you to tell the time and place that I'll arrive to strike, and still surprise you
You want a thesis from me, no problem increase the money
Promise I'm not crazy, don't believe me ask the easter bunny
They had me on wicked attraction, for attacking rappers
I doubled back, and massacred the reenactment actors
One of my favorite things, is bathing in laser beams
Waking from crazy dreams, with scorpion stingers and raven wings
So come and deal with me first
After you I'll jerk your kin folk, so it's no one left to print your R.I.P. shirts

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
You wrote but I wrote more, if you steal from my quote store
I'll bust through your door, swinging a boat ore
I offily, making every image a part of me
I ought to be rewarded, for verbal cinematography
I took the phrase you taught, and made it abort
Like a vegetablized brain, I never gave it a thought
My payment was short, so I went and raided the vault
I just wave, and it's considered aggravated assault
I got lyricists breaking, while you twitching and shaking
I develop photographs, before the pictures are taken
Hungry rappers stand in line, when I hand bars out
I got the whole game covered, like your grandma's couch
How your dome feel, when my word vacuum spit
Picture a bag on your head, with a raccoon in it
No force that you could build up, could make my thoughts budge
Taking dudes off the streets, like a child support judge

(*talking*)
Aaaaah, it feels so good
To know how much, it hurts you ha-ha</pre>
