[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Duke, don't cross the line (I'll hurt cha)
Duke, don't cross the line (I'll hurt cha)
Duke, don't cross the line (I'll hurt cha)
Duke, don't cross the line (I'll hurt cha)

[Solomon Childs]
Coast to coast, we the unexpected
Let it rain, rejoice to relocate
'07, millennium mate, Solomon heroin red
The great, sparks'll fly, licks escape
Let the hammer tuck first, fuck a debate
Niggas is cold puss, West Brighton
Autobiography, street odyssey
Clapped in vain, what happened in homeboy?
Thought you was supposed to rain
Muthafuckas carried away with the fame
Scared to enhance, scared to advance
Scared to stand in what you believe
Life is real, nobody said it'll be hard to achieve
And always remember, in a gunfight
Don't hit for his head, hit for his knees
So when he beg, you can hear him plead

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I'm playing for keeps, murda all ya niggas
Never let a cheat slide
Cut til you see his insides, Red Foxx grind
Nigga, I want all mines
Spit that millimeter showtime, boss crime
Crime boss, let the miggy-mack toss
Five in ya asshole, it's real ashtma
That real hard to breathe, son, I'm breathing sure
And I ain't afraid of the rain, or to be stared
We facing 15 in all kinds of court
I want my money to move by airports
Crafts in my ribs, when I spit
So I gotta get it, cuz nobody's promissed tomorrow
Young brothas minds is hollow
Peep the game, shorty, I'm here to be a role model
I sware man, I'm here to be a role model

[Chorus]</pre>
