Yeh, Yeh

Wot

When I bop through these ends
Follow me on a trot through the East End
Where we wear our hoodies in all seasons
Licking shots
Dodging police
Constables
Walking with punk under balls
Jeans to low
To ever consider
Running or Jumping walls
When I walk around here there's a couple of rules
Don't bling around here, tuck your jewels
Unless you wanna get done by the wolves
And don't fight back
The knife can be so uncomfortable
Before the changes
Before the Shell garage had the Sainsburys
I walk the streets daily
And one ten for big fat goes in the navy
Black hoodies
Nike tracksuits and hats
Who'll fit caps and chaps
Jewellery fact, all that
Attracts all these cats
Looking to lash on your goodies
You can run but that's hard to dance
Between the cracks and by karma
There's many murders you never heard about
Why do you think they call it the Murder Mall
Cause they talk about violence like they know it
And this is never what their life was
So righteous
When a few weeks ago
A bullet missed and struck a minor
Oh my High Road
Good old Upper Clapton High Road
Northolt
Wigan
Southall
Leeds
All my Upper Clapton People
This ain't your regular two step
Routine, take a few steps for me
Left foot, right foot, best foot, first
When I walk around here
Your best to walk firm
So follow trend if you wanna' stand the chance
Follow the steps and let's do the upper clapton dance

If your flash
With your cash
Then invest
Buy a mash
And a vest
To match
Protect your stash, look
Haters hate me but don't hate them
Just do your thing and ignore them
Lifes a bitch with problems
So fuck it
Come share them, Look
Rubber guys you gotta watch them
Move to you, you got to pop them
Do or die you got to take them
Let it slide
You're a victim
Ride with your pride
Ride with the 9
Get caught
Then your pissed then
Jus' ride the time
Do the Time
Mistakes, We can all fix them
Get six years
Serve three
Get a kitchen job, that's me
(Took) Top bunk, bunk bed
Fuck sidelines
It's rent free
This ain't me
But it could be
Cause road lifes sturdy
You beef it
If it's worth it
You go inside you respect it
Respect it, Ride it
Use the time to reflect in it
Get out, start changing it
Change shits do shutting it
But back in the Grime
Back to Action
Back to the hate
Back to Clapton
Haters hate but don't hate them
Stack your bits and show them
This ain't your regular two step
Routine, take a few steps for me
Left foot, right foot, best foot, first foot
When you walk around here
You best to walk firm
So follow trend if you wanna stand the chance
Follow the steps and let's do the upper clapton dance

Let me tell you what Grimes about
To the media people
That runs their mouth
Too negative about what guns about
So we got a hard time trying to find something positive to rhyme about
But if your minding that
Jump on the 253
It's up, try finding that
If you're lying, you'll be dying
Put a gun to your brain
From here to the roundabout
To get murdered
And go on like nobody know'em
But it's a murder saw'em and show'em
It's so dumb
Lead people believe and who believe
These bars ain't going
We get banned from putting our show on
We get banned from tv and so on
Never hear the way the man go on
And easy
Believe me
You don't come past, and fast
And your cars gone
Look, stare and your cuts won't last long
Gold rings and I'll take every last one
Upper Clapton dance with a mask on
Go on step in and won't pull a fast one
Seek to many men
Pass on, this one could be my last song
And the reason I see man rolling
And the hurts get worse from first to the last one</pre>
