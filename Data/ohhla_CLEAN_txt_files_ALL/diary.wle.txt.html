Song:   Diary
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I told you I wanted to talk to you
You think I'm try'na holla at you
And maybe I am but
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you? 
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like
Short days, long nights
By the phone, no call
Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind,got me goin' down that road
Heart made of stone
Far away from home
Black woman you cold
Every problem you ever had with another man I gotta face
Started off on thin ice
I'm still here but I can't skate
Slow sink, can't breath, no remorse, don't think
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat
Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them
Tried them, didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing I'm a do is gon' work
Diary of a black girl

[Chorus]
I wonder why I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
I'm down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow

Raised by a momma who, who
Hates her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with
Saying fuck a nigga Quick, quick
I'm just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me
Girlfriends man cheat, cheat
Why not me the same thing
She can't see in me, what I see in her
This pain she inherit can't be reversed
I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers who played you
The irony in that is that I aint even that, but you put in these pages
Wife, you deserve the label but, but, you been hurt before so you don't feel your able
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing that I ever do works
Diary of a black girl

[Chorus]

See all I wanna do is be relevant
Just tell me that I ever meant anything more
That you could ever see me and you in another light
But its like the dark women indoors in the darkest nights by the wrong man
see all of them have made you incapable of a first impression
what it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna
Just intentions to impress you if capable
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind
For such an ugly picture and
Money, nothing I buy can buy more time
for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say but believe me
with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways
and everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary
the day before is better than the present
so anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences
there's no key for release
no reason to be around
her minds in the clouds
she writes it all down
in her diary

[Chorus]</pre>
