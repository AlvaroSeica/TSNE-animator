[Mr. Serv-On]
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said

I told you little young niggas don't move, nigga don't make a murder case
I don't fuck around no mo'
If you got something of mine nigga
I'm coming to your muthafuckin' house and kick in your fucking door
I know it ain't where you from, it's where the fuck you at
But a nigga told me if I come to this muthafucking city 
I better be muthafuckin' strapped
But guess what nigga I'm a do mine, and throw out the muthafucking knife
So when you come down here to New Orleans nigga
You better put you hands up nigga it's fight time
Cause I can swing with the best of them nigga, blast with the best of them
Fuck with the best of them
Hold my tank of the middle of all the niggas and say 'fuck the rest of them'
You better excuse me nigga cause I love the muthafucking south
And guess what, I keep my little brother coward with me and knock you the fuck out

Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said

Just because a nigga made a little money, 
you think I ain't down with this gangsta shit
Come on let me catch you arising uptown, nigga I'm a fucking jack you bitch
V-90 pass me a motherfuckin rap and what
For all you niggas that know this Heinikan and Hensen, 
nigga the fucking killers will never stop
I made more money on my release date then some you niggas made or your whole tapes
To say about my money, talking bout' 
respect my muthafucking city and how the fuck I want
I roll with killers nigga, know a few cap pealas
I done fucked around with alot of out of town dealers, nigga I'm a fucking big wheeler
I ain't the type of nigga that sit around this bitch and talk about what I got
Best believe me nigga when I come around this bitch I'ma tell your whole fucking block
You don't know me, you don't wanna fuck with me, you can't touch me
You niggas can't rush me, nigga all you can do 
is kiss this muthafucking tank, you can't fuck with me

Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, bitch you heard what I said
Put 'em up, put 'em up, you think I'm playin' what the fuck I said

Craig B, where the foolish muthafuckers?
I ain't playing hoe.
KL, Big Moe (Big Moe)
