Bless 1:

Unorthodox pattern of talking, words walking
At a rapid pace chasing greatness now I face
Cheering crowds, replacing troubled men with scowls
In plain view ghetto youths tumbling dotted cubes
Observing the madness as I cruise
We choose to hide internal bruises so healing is impossible
Tackling the obstacles of embracing our brethren
Loving our women and leading our impressionable children
'Til then destruction swallows us whole
Bad odds at birth like born on parole
Unable to compete, CD of life stuck on repeat
Moving with the awkwardness of shackled feet
I build with men who grew up fatherless
On stoops we gathered and shared laughter like the shit had never bothered us 
We've gotten over it, the imperial vocalist
Sharing a few, giving my view, quote me on it

Infini:

My every moment on the microphone, I'm on a mission
I'm wishing to peep all palms in vertical positions
Inflicting incisions, your decision is competition
Death and destruction like the Spanish Inquisition
Bible was written, knowledge was missing, and truth was hidden
Greatest trick the devil ever pulled was religion
My method of division is fiction versus realism
Definition of modern superstition is tradition
I'm causing collisions to fools, robberies they choose
I'm trying to make life's move, so fuck fly jewels
Check the news, which facet of rap do you pay dues
Hip-Hop rugby shirt, denim jeans, and running shoes
Refuse to lose, wisdom from people under the stairs
Light like flares, shit is rocking like senior citizen chairs
Nobody cares yet they treat us like fetuses
Who the fuck wants to walk half a mile in my Adidas?

Bless 1:

I'm trying to find balance walking these streets orbited by violence
At night sirens slice through thick silence
They label us as tyrants, uncivil
Unworthy of decent housing, adequate hospitals
And schools where our seeds are properly educate
Guns fired by hungry adolescents trying to make it out of..(damn)
But too often end up property, institutionalized now the world becomes an oddity
We got to move through
The hearts of men are the blacker than the bottom of grand mama's house shoes
So it's time to counsel to our own needs
Unity's shattered in the community by jealousy and greed  
We got to gather, unite as one
The day will come when we'll find our place in the sun
The day will come when we'll find our place in the sun
The day will come when we'll find our place in the sun
The day will come

Chorus 2x:

As a people our fighting has only begun
The day will come when we'll find our place in the sun
Bound by none when the temple transcends the slums
The day will come when we'll find our place in the sun</pre>
