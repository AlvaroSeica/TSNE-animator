[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
Uh, yeah son, hahaha
I got something for you
Dungeon! What up

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
Hey you, what's that sound? Everybody look, what's going down?
You don't wanna fuck with us and get beat down
Now Duc-Lo, and step, Duc-Lo, then step

[Dungeon Masta]
It's ok, lyrics like gats, that spray
Bones decay, so I may, make it obvious, ashes to grow
And dust, it's not that obvious, we stay fucked up
It's alright, we gonna get right tonight
Someone tell me where the party at
I can't sleep, I don't no-no where they fire gats
Cuz niggas these days, they don't know how to fucking act
Getting drunk off the Henny, burning up the black
Damn, ma, I didn't know that ass was that fat
Come over, here, here, let's count stacks
Are you riding with Dungeon, is that a fact?

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Can I see where your head is truly at?
Do you mind if you do a juks with me, it's the gat
I've been peepin' this cat from the P's
He started off with O's, now the faggot's coppin' keys
Broke bread with him, hittin' up his enemies
Even caught a body with his bitch ass overseas
I'm mad careful, I lived the life that's oh so dareful
Amended and ended, it's stable, I find it hard to control
Eh, so have prepare for my arrival
I mean what I say, say what I mean, liable
Don't make me come after you with the rifle
Your mouth can maybe say, well take ya life, duke

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Let's take it back to the basics, what you know about
Ox' in the mouth, gettin' buck fifty faces
How spot turnt to coke cases, body found in unfamiliar places
Conceal the tears in my eyes
What you know about turning Lincoln's to Franklin's
By any, the total of niggas, I caught many
Always wanted Janet since Jenny, remember me
The nigga that used to go back to new milleni'
No more shall I take this, what you know about
Baking them cakes and splittin' pies with them guys
Shorties going crazy cuz they know that I don't care
And the way I puff blunts in the air

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
