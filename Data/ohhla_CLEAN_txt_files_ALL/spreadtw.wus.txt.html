(Intro: Myalansky ad-libs)

[Myalansky]
Yo Mafia keep it low, They got a spot on Savanna's
Like Bun's crib was in Belly, Somebody telling
Plus the hood we holding it, Now they jealous
Talking to cops, How they know about the blood from up top
Or the body cemented in a barrel left down by the dock
Shit is hot, Closing down on the block
Let the workers know to chill for a second
Until we find out the next move, Shit is real for a nigga
Be easy how you talk on the phones
We gotta get up out of town dog, Already got cases in other states
Shit, Got me walking on a thin line
Alias names, Lets find this snitch and put this kid in his grave
Aint nothing sweet nigga, Gotta set examples out of cats that be talking
No favoritism, Even bitches get tortured
Tryna infiltrate the drug operation, Giving coppers locations
They can't stop us son, They know that we're dangerous

[Chorus 2X: Myalansky]
Spread the word there's a snitch on the block, Nigga the cops calling
Grab the guns, Flushing shit down the toilet
Tryna relocate further up state and vanish in the city
The only way we going out duke is six feet

[Joe Mafia]
Ayo, The work's in the lab, Fuck I'm dirty as shit
With the heaters and cash somebody snitched
A blue and her just left, Make offer we need to link
At the master power cab, There you got me, It's hot now
Dumping off a the salons, Picking at cops now
D.A. oughtta jump off and blow the spot now
There go the bank, Hit low, See me the God hour
Get sour, Throw it all on it, Buy us some time
And get to see Allah, Red-eye from B-More
Pay your man in the Springs a visit
Cop a machine so the doughs pile up
Yall faggots can't stop our flow
Time's up, Tell the soldiers to post up
Shut the strip down, Spread the word this is twenty-cent
Lick if a nigga with it, Right now get out the mix
Ayo son, Get out the mix

[Chorus]
