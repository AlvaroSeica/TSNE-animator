Song:   The Avenue
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And I don't need you
To say you don't love me
If you don't cause
I love you anyway (oooh)

Yeah...down the avenue
Yeah...walk down the avenue

I see you walking down the avenue
I see you walking everyday
I even know when your jeans are new
Looks like theres nothing
Left to say
How did I become such a selfish man?
Chasing my memories down the block
Its cause Im
Hanging on the avenue
Thats why my girlfriend
Is hip hop

So I don't need you
To say you don't love me
If you don't cause
I love you anyway (oooh)

I see you walking down
The streets sometimes
I see walking now and then
I see you on the
T.V. show sometimes
Are you for real or just pretend?
And when the night shine fall
And the city lights shine
Im right by your side
It's cause Im hanging on the Avenue
Thats why I've got
Nothing to hide

Cause I don't need you
To say you don't love me
if you don't cause
I love you anyway (oooh)

I'm just a man with some
Diamonds in my pocket
I like you ma'am but
Im here to Planet Rocket
I'm just a man with some
Diamonds in my pocket
I like you ma'am but
Im here to Planet Rocket

Downtown, it could be you and me
Downtown, Downtown
We could ride the TTC (like we used too)
Downtown, it could be you and me
Downtown, Downtown
We could ride the TTC (like we used too)

No, I don't need you
To say you don't love me
If you don't cause
I love you anyway (oooh)

No I don't need you
I'm Unconditional... Sometimes

Another episode, Another Episode

Now, Im just chillin in the stands
In a million style
Ill catch you in a minute
I got to chase for awhile
I love the East Coast
Went to the West Coast
Touchdown seen the crew
butter on toast

I didnt used to know
The art of saying nothing
It's harder than saying something
Cause nothing is constantly rushing
Through the front door
Which I lost my key
Last week
I cant speak but
You know what Im saying

Im on the path alone
So dont give me the run around time
It's chasing us down
I got to keep it movin

Super fly trip
Watch that girl kick
Gave that rat a fat lip
Whack broad tip
We skip downtown
Rollin on skates
She can pay but
She cant trade what
She can't say now
See me, not eight now
Not until aint now
Giving us a run around
I went to Oldman River
He's kid and don't stop
You could be popular
Just dont try
To go pop pop

Im on the path alone
So dont give me the run around time
It's chasing us down
I got to keep it movin

You led me to a parking lot
And lost the car
That you came with
And drove me from the back seat
I like the wind in my face
Top down, music and
Riding in the back seat

You drove me to a parking lot
And lost the car
That you came with
And drove me from the back seat
I like the wind in my face
Top down, music and
Riding in the back seat, seat, seat

Yeah back seat of the taxi
Is where we swing
