[Chorus: Troy Cash]
you know your special take my pain away and ease my mind
one thing for sure I love you to the end of time
the way I feel inside
when you look into my eyes
you make feel like I'm the luckiest
man alive

[Lil cuete]
when I wake up
when I go to bed
youre always on my head like I said since
the first day I met ya
I know that I would never forget ya
and all the nights we spend
making sure that our love won't end
I'm frozen
in time when I'm yours and your mine
and this why

[Troy Cash]
(Because your beautiful
so intelligent
you are the finest girl
the finest girl I've ever met)
when I am not around you lady
I miss you so much baby
I cherrish every little minute that you ever gave me

[Chorus: Troy Cash]
you know your special take my pain away and ease my mind
one thing for sure I love you to the end of time
the way I feel inside

man alive

[Lil cuete]
I wanna let you know your the queen in my heart
and will always be together we can't be apart
