Song:   Ain't Got a Lot of Money
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I ain't got a lot of money
All I got is time and a reason to rhyme
Don't need a lot of money
All I need is you
[2X]
My baby girl was a virgin till I came inside
With the brown eye passionate and kisses right
When I got her arms wrapped around my side
Then you know it's a feeling that you talkin about
And if you don't need me then I don't need you on my mind
And if you don't want me then I don't want you on my dime

I said I'm leavin baby
Never look back never look back
I said I'm leavin honey
Never look back again
[2X]
I ain't got a lot of money
All I got is time and a reason to rhyme
Don't need a lot of money
All I need is you
[2X]

And if you don't need me then I don't need you on my mind
And if you don't want me then I don't want you on my dime

I said I'm leavin baby
Never look back never look back
I said I'm leavin honey
Never look back again
[2X]
I ain't got a lot of money
All I got is time and a reason to rhyme
Don't need a lot of money
All I need is you
[2X]</pre>
