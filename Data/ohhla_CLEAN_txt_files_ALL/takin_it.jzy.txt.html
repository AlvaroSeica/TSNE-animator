CLEAR
YEAH!
Aahah
Its official!
yeah..yeah
Ay Ziggy, I told them niggaz!
They wouldn't believe me though
I do this shit by the way

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
It's 3:45, she pulled up to my house
Grabbed my strap, got the door with a blunt in my mouth (haha)
Say I'm bout to put this mack down.. You know I'll put this mack down
And while I put this mack down, she park in the background
Look at me, I'm standing tall
She know how to keep it up
We just left the club, so you know we both drunk as fuck
30 min in, second wind, call it cardio
I go up and down, round and round, SUPER MARIO
Oh wee, oh wee, she bustin' like a uzi (uzi)
I'm ridin' the suzuki, she wet as a jacuzzi (uzi)
Call it in..code 10..get ready for the waterflowwwwwww
Number 16, "Tear It Up", yeah I told you so

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
What can I say (I ain't lying)
Aint no easy way to say this (yeah)
And I dont know If you can handle it (I dont know if you can handle It)
But I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it (taking it there)
'Cause thats the only way you ain't get it (and you...)
You lay around with them boyshorts on (layin' around)
And I've been thinking about it all day long (all day long shawty)
And I too dont think that I can handle it (but her)
But I think I might end up takin' it

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I'm thinkin' 'bout takin it, then by receiving
She can get it right back up, just give her a reason
Any given season...winter, spring, summer, fall
I came to see the show baby, gon' and make that waterfall( haha)
She know I'm the one to call, when she want that good shit
She know I'm the one to call, when she want that hood shit
Baby lookin' all good, my demeanors all hood
Left the chopper in the car, you know the handles all wood (haha)
I stepped up in the spot, smelling like a pound
Yeah you know I'm takin' that, you ain't gotta pull 'em down
You ain't gotta take 'em off for me...I'm over aggressive
Said its 'bout to be a accident, just call progressive

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I dont know If you can handle this, know if you can handle me
First I'm gonna start right here exactly where yo man should be
I dont know If you can handle this, know If you can handle Young
If you ain't never had a real nigga, betta get you one!
Come thru on some thug shit (thug shit)..gotta respect it
Yeah I come thru on some thug shit (thug shit)...gotta accept it
She know that I'm never shy, most of the time I'm probably high
Mr. Kidnap the kitty cat, yeah you gonna need a aliby (haha)

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Ain't that how you do it Jeezy?</pre>
