[Prodigy]
The original.. evil bastard, cutthroat war monger
Backstabber, betray your own mother
Your double-tongue, double talk cause you two-faceted
You triple six with a hiss like Satan
No good snake, you only speak lies
Slime bucket scum of the universe; your eyes
reveal that you have no soul
and expose your true colors - I see you
From three million miles away
Yeah youse a sneaky muh'fucker but you can't fool me
You not my bro, you not my sis
The devil doesn't have a skin color or complexion so
You not my brother, you not my sister
Yeah your skin might be brown but I know that you down
with about - two billion demons
Listen stay the fuck away from me or, get killed for treason
against the most high; you might got these other people
scared of you, but that shit don't fly
Over here, we laugh at you but it's not a joke
Cause people need to know, about the Black Devil

[Prodigy]
Yeah~! The real outcast, your time is up
It's not the end of the world, it's the Age of Aquarius
Youse a deceiver, you got the whole world confused
In a daze like some rats in a maze
Youse a shapeshifter, I don't care if you
the Pope, the President or Prime Minister
King or Queen, Prince or Princess
You just frontin for the public then you frontin for the press
But behind closed doors, what really goes on is
ritualistic, cannibalistic
sadistic, masochistic, some real sick shit
The most wicked there is that ever lived
under the sun, the Infamous Daywalker
The movie Blade's just metaphorical - yes!
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled is
convincin the world the devil don't exist
People have no clue
They lookin for a red man with a pitchfork, but that's just not true
Some say it's the white man but yo
I'm here to let you know, that you ain't know, about the Black Devil

Yeah, yo peace, peace God
Today's mathematics God, deal with science man

[Prodigy]
Knowledge equality of all people
Even though physically we not all equal
Erase the racism, the only thing I see
when I look at a person is good or evil
"But the black man is God!" Yeah that shit sound good
But that shit don't apply when you try and get a job
This is real world music, reality rap
We spent too many years on that fantasy crap
It's time we deal with the facts, and the fact is
you not better than somebody cause the color of your skin
I did three years in prison
And the white boys showed me more love than any of my so-called niggaz
So you can go and poof your doctrine
The only thing that matters is you negative or positive and
you can go to hell even
where I'm sure you'd be find with the rest of your kind
People are so blind, so deaf, so dumb
Which proves you wanna battle but the war not done
You might got these other people fooled
But you can't fool we cause we know, that you a Black Devil</pre>
