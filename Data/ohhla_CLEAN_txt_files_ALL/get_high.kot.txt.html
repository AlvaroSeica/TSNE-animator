Song:   Get Your High On
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Whats up everybody, is your boy Johnny Richter
The same mother fucker you used to see in pictures
With a bong, a joint, a pipe, or a big bag
The crickedy cronic that I always seem to have
Yes I always seem to have a little som'em som'em
And I always got the pot that keeps the people coming
And you, you know can't repeat the words ??
So I, just sit back, relax, an get high with the women
Blowin' tokes while getting blown, Lettin' it flow
Johnny Richter, plus a hoe, plus a bag of enduo, Oooooooooooooo...
And that's the shit that people wants to dream about
Makes you want to scream and shout
Wait til' mine gets out your mouth
Damn baby, you need to relax on that thing
Treat that thing like a nice glass piece

Who wants to get their high on
Listening on this song (get your high on)
Fire up the vaporizer
Go clean out that bong (get your high on)
Who wants to get their high on
higher than Babylon (get your high on)
Speak to your messiah
Come along hit the bong (get your high on)

Simon says....
Shut the fuck up if you ain't got no weed
You better back the fuck up if you got sticks and seed
D double dash L.O.C. - I got the bombest
Everybody claiming that the B.C. is cronic
Why, do you always smoke when you know your buds garbage
I smoke that purple cush, green crack, lemon super silver haze
So now, you know what the fuck I mean when I say GANJA (GANJA) GANJA
Not a day go by, red eyed, don't ask why
Tonights the night for me to let smoke fly
If your down for the crown everybody get high

Who wants to get their high on
Pull some weed on this song (get your high on)
Fire up the vaporizer
Go clean out that bong (get your high on)
Who wants to get their high on
higher than Babylon (get your high on)
Speak to your messiah
Come along hit the bong (get your high on)

(Stoned, lets get stoned) (Stoned, lets get stoned)

I wanna get stoned now, relieve my stress level
Decompress, elevate like a soul rebel
expand my mind, let my senses run free
loose track of time, let time grab a hold of me
I'm uplifted, my spirits risin'
I'm on couch-lock this ain't surprising
I got the munchies seein' new horizons
Eyes goin' south bond now were vaporizing
I smoke a Dutch, Dragon, Magic Bud, Skunk-one
Purple Haze, Donkey Dick, Hindu Kush, Chocolate Chunk
Cotton Candy, White Widow, Cali Mist, and Bubble Gum
Blue Berry, Mothers Finest, making peace with everyone
And just think, this nights just begun.. ha ha get your high on

Who wants to get their high on
? (get your high on)
Fire up the vaporizer
Go clean out that bong (get your high on)
Who wants to get their high on
higher than Babylon (get your high on)
Speak to your messiah
Come along hit the bong (get your high on)

Who wants to get their high on

Fire up the vaporizer

Who wants to get their high on

Who wants to get their high on
Come along hit the bong

I wanna get stoned now

GET YOUR HIGH ON</pre>
