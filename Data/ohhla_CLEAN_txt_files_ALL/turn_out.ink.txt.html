Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Go..
Yeah
Its kid ink

I know you see me with my back against the wall
Grippen on the cup standing on the booth
I could see the whole club
Everybody show me love haters show me mugs
But I ain't gonna let it kill my buzz
Watch me turn it out
I turn it out
Watch me turn it out
I turn it out
Watch me turn it out
Ladies tell me yes they never don't never turn me down
Watch me turn em out

Watch how I do its the one and only reason that the routin
Everything lucid but I'm heavy off that fluid
Blowin smoke threw your face
So everybody feel included
We should celebrate ever single day
We don't need a reason over here except we gettin paid
Put your lighters up higher then the Himalays
Roll with the alumni bitch I graduated yeah
Now I roll up look like a diploma
Its that fire feel it burnin
Got it fanin like dacota
See my name on the flyer
So the owner make its quote up
Its just me and my brothers like the jonas

And we sitten with our back against the wall
Grippen on the cup standing on the booth
I could see the whole club
Everybody show me love haters show me mugs
But I ain't gonna let it kill my buzz
Watch me turn it out
I turn it out
Watch me turn it out
I turn it out
Watch me turn it out
Ladies tell me yes they don't never don't never turn me down
Watch me turn em out

Eyes wide shut still see yuh lookin
Walkin on the cloud look up and see my footprints
It ain't nothing but a word lets get it started
Takin shots lets your head snap back like a starter
It's been a long time comin just start payin attention
Ya'll some cheap motherfuckers everybody in attendance
Looking for the ruckis send another round
Rollin with the punches we smokin in the club snuck it threw my bitches
Tip to the bouncers cuz security be snitchen
Its a rockin belvedere o.j by the pitcher
Got yuh mad niggah that was my intentions

See me sittin with my back against the wall
Grippen on the cup standing on the booth
I could see the whole club
Everybody show me love haters show me mugs
But I ain't gonna let it kill my buzz
Watch me turn it out
I turn it out
Watch me turn it out
I turn it out
Watch me turn it out
Ladies tell me yes they never don't never turn me down
Watch me turn em out</pre>
