[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Memories B! Yeah! Let's Ride! Yo!

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
It's Freddie Foxxx over hip hop, ears be on the tap out
Inside joke for my niggas who know the workout
Toured with a mu'fucker we had jokes
Had to crack a bus driver, who hate black folks
Lil' Fame in his ear, bangin MO-P
Billy on the phone with wifey and a white tee
Foxxx on the couch stretched out white tube socks
Noddin to the fire comin out Fame's boombox
Laze and Shug took it back to the hood
Playin C-Lo in the aisle, twneties and the pow
Guru instigatin and snappin with Big Shug
HeadQCourterz on the hustle, money was lookin good
We hood, and Biggest Gord in a bad mood
It's nothin personal, he's just a mad dude
Sometimes he's mad rude but still a good nigga
When he, like the way you flow 'cause he picky
Smoke alot of icky, while him and Stacks playin 21
I'm focused on this bus driver, me and him discussin guns
At truck stops, I watch, for some reason
I, didn't think he was a cop, with them keys
And it was makin him hot, and Lil' Fame blowin mad smoke
All in his face, he hatin breathin, for that reason

[Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Where was you when we lived on the Gang Starr bus?
(You-You wasn't down when we was ridin the bus-"Ed O.G.")
Yeah! Where was you when we fought on the Gang Starr bus?
(Y-You don't even know, the half about me-"Guru")
Come on!!! Where was you when we grindin on the Gang Starr bus?
(That proves it right there, you wasn't down-"Just Ice")

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
Where, I spit the venom B, you wasn't nowhere
HL, Black and Eon was all right there
We was eatin all the food, we was rude
Made Sarah cry many a day, but she loved us anyway
Me and Guru in debatin, about the greatest emcee
At the end I said it was him, he said it was me
Then Premier said, "Both of y'all niggas is trash"
And he broke into a freestyle, we started to laugh
Young Rome doin push-ups, admires himself
Foxxx says that, "He was crazy and he lied to himself"
We started laughin, meanwhile Laze is gunnin for the pot
Shug singin old slow jams, smokin on pot
I joined in to the background and made it sound hot
'Cause I was raised on crooners, gun bustin baby boomers
Who flowed like the Chi-Lites, verbs out the bloomers
Fat G keepin Guru out of rumors, new ones

[Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Where was you when we was livin, on the Gang Starr bus?
(You-You wasn't down when we was ridin the bus-"Ed O.G.")
Come on!!! Where was you when was fightin,  on the Gang Starr bus?
(Y-You don't even know, the half about me-"Guru")
Come on!!! Where was you when we grindin on the Gang Starr bus?
(That proves it right there, you wasn't down-"Just Ice")
Where? Where was you, when we was rhymin, on the Gang Starr bus?
(You-You wasn't down when we was ridin the bus-"Ed O.G.")

[Outro: DJ Premier Scratchin]
You-You-You wasn't-You-You-You-You wasn't down
You-You-You-You wasn't down when we was-when was ri-ri-ridin the bus-"Ed O.G."</pre>
