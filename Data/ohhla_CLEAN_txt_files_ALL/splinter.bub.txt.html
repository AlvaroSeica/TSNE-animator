[Intro: Crucifix]
Ohh my, na na na na-na
Ohh-mmmm
The world is cold as a winter
And people gon' get up under your skin like a splinter
Mmm-mm-mmm

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I got a whole lot of issues that are unresolved
I went two weeks without seein nobody, just my dog
His name is Blao, he's the closest thing to a child I
may ever have, I'm selfish as hell, why lie?
Too self-absorbed for relationships, still I try
from time to time to find me one, but my life
and my patterns are hard for a decent woman to
respect or accept, so whores I keep 'em comin through
In the bed with a babblin bitch that loves me
And she bad, it's just somethin about her is ugly
After we finish I hate when she try to touch me
It ain't her fault (ayy) that's just me
I slowly weigh down, but I ain't perfect though
"Relapse" is a record that I done heard befo'
And I'm no Marshall Mathers, I'm talkin Andy Mathis
I'm talkin candy habits, it's so sad and tragic

[Chorus: Crucifix]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gon' get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I'm a sinner
But all I can do is pray, God just take the pain away
Cause I'm cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I'm a winner
But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I tried my best to be so good to some folks
The same people showed me betrayal up close
The flipside of that coin is I've been negligent
With a lot of my real friends, I never meant
to let a day turn into a month and then a year
without speakin to you, I know that it appears
I just forgot about y'all, but really in truth
I forgot about me too, this igloo
I built around myself is so frigid
And it ain't meltin away, I don't dig it
I know when life is gone I'm gon' miss it
It's like it never was here if you don't live it
I think about the past and get so livid
What the fuck was you thinkin? I don't get it
You so capable, personality magnetic
Life could've been so good if you had let it

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I may not be the shit to you but where I come from
Them people love Bub', therefore I must just
stay faithful, the Lord's got his hands on me
And you don't hate me, you just don't understand homie
There from humble beginnings I saw limitless
possibility, fear was my only nemesis
Along the way I forfeited my innocence
But that's okay - thank you Lord

[Crucifix]
Okay; for all the pain, and the affliction
It's like a mirror in my face that I need to see
All my loss, and my addiction
It showed me somethin that I really need to know about me
It's like you're shapin me, you're moldin me
And killin this heart that's controllin me
Though I'm OUT of control, you still order me
Foldin me up inside your hands in a world so cold!

[Chorus] - minus last line

[Outro: Crucifix]
But all I can do is pray, just let me make it through the DAYYYY!
Yeahhhhhh, just let me make it through the day (let me make it through the day)
Just let me make it through the day (let me make it through the day)
