Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Man I kick shit daily
See the scene change flip backgrounds
Roll the rim of the island and put my tracks down
Tight linguistics quite descriptive
With the boom the bat the bam well damn I rip shit
Of the shoreline rappin the land
It's the radical man sailin on a catamaran (Yeah!)
By the seaside life on the beach road
Far north, south west, down south east coast

I dunno but it feels so easy, coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like
Boom bat bam - hot damn

I dunno but it feels so easy, coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like
Boom bat bam - hot damn

Yeah,
From Manly, Maroubra to Margaret river
If you ain't been down you only get half the picture
Populated skateparks where they pass the liquor
Bein brokes no joke so I'm laughin with ya
I'm like a father figure for kids without guidance
Life, respect women - bitches bring violence
The hot shot with the heart of a sailor
That's chopped pot with like half of Australia
Birthday bathroom cocaine boff's
I'm with the kids makin home made jumps
Kick-flippin the beat on a hot day watch mate
You can see off the rocks face crops blaze

A community of unity and handshakes
And truthfully there's beauty in our landscape
So if your rock in your hoody or watchin the footy, it doesn't matter,
We're all fans call me cousin Macka

I dunno but it feels so easy, coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like
Boom bat bam - hot damn

I dunno but it feels so easy, coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like
Boom bat bam - hot damn

Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like boom bat bam - hot damn

To all my beach bombers each summer holdin it down
Were the free runners feet hover over the town
Raft up at the marina - leisure and pleasure
Float and bash of boats, all tethered together
Good times, laid back, and out on the free range
Easy going folks bring about a sea change
Starlit sky - high above the land
Beach lights burn campfires in the sand
Hear the acoustics let the tune touch me
Under the moon kids cane dune buggies,
BMX Bandits that ride through the calm breeze
Skateboard wheels glide through the palm trees
What a paradise look around clockwise
From Bell's beach round to boogie down Bondi
Surfers ride right through life's two
A nice view when the sky uses bright blue

I dunno but it feels so easy, coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like
Boom bat bam - hot damn

I dunno but it feels so easy, coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge we just kick it it's like
Boom bat bam - hot damn

This has got guts like the rush in the surfer's head
When he's out there starin down a perfect set
The dreams extreme
You'll earn your rep to make an average motherfucker turn to nervous wreck

Let the sun set in the west and rise in the east
Life at work gettin high at my beach
I'm a lit cannon you bitch rappers I split atoms
And I came like I made the same shit happen

Huggin the coast line, sea shore risen</pre>
