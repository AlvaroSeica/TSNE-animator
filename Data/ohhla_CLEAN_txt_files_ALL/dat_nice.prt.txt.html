Some of dem Cave dwellers, 
bomb mailers, and gun sellers, 
the lie tellers  cinderellas, and Goodfellas. 
The gun packers crack backers and loot stackers 
? crackers new world order ?? actors.  
The globe holders, the population controllers, 
disease makers a.k.a. AIDS creators 
The cremators , doctors, nurses and nigga haters. 
That's out to get us, after making us bullshitters 
The sister hitters who knock um and don't stay wit em. 
The human litter that whiteys about to get rid of. 
The same niggas supplanted the very planet 
with mathematics pure knowledge and understanding.  
Global famine pursuit of the hidden manner star spangled banner 
Slave traders and kidnappers. 
We ain't just rappers

to motivate and navigate the revelation.

Well life is what you make it holler to the almighty 
frighty Whitey never will learn to like me.

on the brink of extinct. 
Mind vocalize though only prove to incline 
one time in time I turn the water to wine. 
Combine X and Y created physical Gods 
no lie because I heard that if I did I would die? 
????????????full of ????? politricks and 10%ers 
who know the truth but hold it back from the youth. 
There's proof that Jesus Christ was a so called spook. 
Revelations Chapter One 13 and 16 "wool hair" "bronze skin"
Jesus was blacker than me. 
I'll prove and I claim that the truth has been changed 
for the lies and the white supremacy to remain. 
That chain on your brain makes it hard to maintain.

See, I could extend your days in a spectrum of rays

Verse 3
{Wise Intelligent}
Perfection! 
forever living giving tongues to the dumb G is for God.  
Where the gangsta come from? 
Wisdom words in action making knowledge for real.  
Witness the days when brothers have to kill or be killed.  
Gods will will be done the kingdom will come  
the Gods seed keep perfecting the Sun. 
The Wise one aint done. 
Six sextillion tons Earth 
I levitate hold the universe and press weight. 
I hear debate come look God in the face. 
Place your empty thoughts with the limited waste.  
Erase your earthly ass at the speed 
1-1-2-0 per second but still you act slow. 
There go some negro 
confiscatin' my flow. Ditto.  
This information take it home and make a plus lesson.  
I shine the light that knowledge ignites 
excite Blacks and Whites through the things that I write. 
See, I could extend your days in a spectrum of rays 
in a westerly direction God is worthy of praise. 
Or I could capsize the planet deprive you of life, take flight, 
make ice of any emcees you like.... I'm dat nice.
