Yeah! South Central Cartel is back in dis mutha......
And we 'bout 2 do it like dis.... L.V.       ohhhhhhh uhhhhhhhh........

Baby hold on another slow song is comin' swift
The street life of a true g" you get me drift
Khaki suits, locs, chokes the grokest sacs
Got your drug cause you sprung on the gangsta mac
Lalalalalala your baby skip the chacha
Oh! Call me a hoe with a low flow
Hmm you couldn't deal with the real so you step quick
Bad Ass  the bytch causing treat with on the Havik's dick
Gangsta luv said yo and you said oh no the life of a g" was a nono
City 2 city u say u miss me 
but you got mad see 
Packin' your shit try to leave me  
but so long cause Imma go on
Yeah l.u.v. is not me cause I'm 2 strong 
to be a sit with choke on a bytch list yeah
And I know girl u couldn't deal wit dis

Chorus: U couldn't deal wit dis    x3
             Girl u better let it go 

Look girl you used to cry about the way I have to handle thangs 
but in the streets it's do or die among the central gangs
Me and my homies made a record and we make some noise
The gangsta luv is try to shell was broke me cut the voice
Grown in the city like we used to nothing had to change
but you were trippin' about all the other brutal games
Yeah I can pick cha and I can hold you I can start to shit 
and fill (feel) with serious so probably get the pistol quick
But all the day it's kinda we can gets the criminal 
and on the tel it's kinda we compare the sickle strolls
The gangsta luv is playin' out 
I tried to work it out but all you like to do was shout
but Prode'je's a business if you want it you'd invest
You could have made it over but you seem to make a mess
Yeah I used to grindin' with the chicks 
but now it's with the fist bytch
U couldn't deal with dis 

Chorus: U couldn't deal wit dis   x3
             Girl you better let it go 
             Love is not my thang
             You Know I'm a gangsta man
             You keep callin' me a hoe
             but girl you just don't know
             It was u who pushed me away
             and your bytchass just can't stave
             Cause a true ass g" don't joke
             So I'm walkin' out tha door 
             U couldn't deal wit dis   x4
             Girl u better let it go   x2 </pre>
