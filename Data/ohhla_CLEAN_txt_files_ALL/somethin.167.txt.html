[Levi 167]
Right about now (right about now)
We're gonna give you something a little.. (a little)
Dope dope, d-dope dope, dope
Dope dope, d-dope dope
But before we get into somethin dope
I wanna know all y'all homeboys out there ready to play the game (YEAH!)
Fly girls out there do you know how to play the game? (YEAH!)
Party people do we need any rules for this game? (NO!!)
So let's play
 
Well, I'm, Levi, one-six-seven 
Feel stupin and troopin because this party is hoopin
You see I do not bribe because I like to broil 
Mc competition that makes my blood boil
Just Levi! 
Lurkin' searchin to any type of virgin (?)
while I'm up on stage operating like a surgeon
Comin AT your face, for no apparent reason
Style and 'n chill what you get is outta season 
Let the fact remain, as an artist I reign
Don't try to get a rap over snatchin' someone's rope chain
I teach the lesson, because they see I'm fresh and...
Cause when this jam is verbally rocked I leave a good impression
Make no exceptions for the passengers in sections
They come up with the dope entertainer to rock this jam session
This is the game, and we're all a bunch of fame
Party people in the house what's my name?
Levi! One-six-seven
 
Certainly, you think it's hard work for me
Over blunts and tea, I write the dope lyrics easily
See I have arrived to rock you live
Throwin up with many discos and adult street joints qualified
Distant in the visual, in rap not a musical
Combining dope rhymes and beats to rock as usual
Slayin the hit list, only suckers get dissed
My job's to rock, so c'mon and let's do this
Spit knowledge off the head, my partner is a dread
Bronx New York is where we live, and I have come to give
A concept out of a lecture, more like a mild sedative
Calm, not loud in a rage
Still kickin' lyrics keep a / / / / / day
Something new I kick to you
And your posse to dance to
The title of the cut is something fresh to swing to
Even KRS and ICU will say respect .......to Levi 
One Six Seven
Rocking for the moment, taking out opponents
Writing down the dope rhyms while stacking on Dunking Donuts
With any conversation with the opposite sex
They always seem to think OF what can happen next
I seem to see myself as an mc proffesor
Never take lesson from a lady so I test her
Naturally violent, but I quicker undresss her
But proud of what it takes for LEE ... why sin (?) impress her
After she's impressed like a damsel in distress
I scheme to ask her whereabouts and address
If she tells me, then I'm on, if she doesn't then I'm gone
But what I have to say you see it has to go to spawn
Cause I'm Levi , a self-conscious person
Never fail in rhymes cause I write and rehearse them
Written and perfected, corrected and wrote
The moral of the story is I think fly girls are
Fly girls are, fly girls are... dope dope
 
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
 
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
 
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope {*fades*}</pre>
