Roc Star

[Intro]
Twinkle, twinkle little star  
and how I wonder what you are  
and up above the world so high  
and I'm like a diamond in the sky  
and you think you balling  
you think you on a role  
well we roc stars  
and we rollin, yea

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I feel like money, I feel like money 
I feel like money, I feel like money 
Catch me, catch me on the block, I'm posted on the block

or a roc star

Look I party like a roc star actions of a block boy  
catch me in a fly car she ain't bad as my broad 
I see ya click but they ain't bad as my squad 
250 on the wrist to watch my time spark 
and that's the message ima get it til my time stop 
no top on top wit the pine locked 
only thing I ain't got is a pine box 
1 beam 1 shot bet time stop
same block same clip in that still gloc 
niggas say they bout they business but they still watch 
so all my whips stay tinted wit the wheels stock 
unless I'm trickin for the chickens then the wheels rock

[Chorus]

[Outro]

Roc stars and we rollin yea
