Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: singing to "I Need a Doctor"]
I'm about to lose my mind
I've been doin this so long, while they stay talkin down
Like stay screwed and chopped up, stay screwed and chopped up
Mayne stay screwed and chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one mo' time

[Chamillionaire]
Picture a world with no haters mayne I can only imagine
All this success I'm grabbin, hate they don't have what I'm havin
I heard a clown say he mad and felt like I left Screw abandoned
And also said that the white boy that's on my left wasn't jammin
(WHAT?!) And where were you when Slim Thugga purchased his first set of Davins?
Where were you when the world was tellin us this couldn't happen?
Now all the wood that I'm grabbin, my Caddy look like a cabi
And yeah I did it with rappin, reason you didn't is yappin
They thought that Cleveland and Akron was super easy we packed in
a bunch of CD's with rappin it wasn't easy to track 'em
Look super easy we stackin, but wasn't easy what happened
is all the leechers attached and they started reachin and jackin
Ask me how many bootleggers we had to run up and handle
Ask me how many fluke tellers we had to come and dismantle
So when you see me out standin there like a boss in the flesh
You ain't got to get on your knees but just know that you have blessed
I feel like

[Chorus: singing to "I Need a Doctor"]
I'm about to lose my mind
I've been doin this so long, and boys stay talkin down
Like stay screwed and chopped up, I stay screwed and chopped up
Mayne stay screwed and chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one mo' time

[Chamillionaire]
Uhhh - what you mean?
I already did my thing, I forever be the King
Just like the name on that black women in swimsuit magazine
Stay hoppin out of my Porsche puttin these boys under my wing
I taught you how to be safer when the industry tried to break ya
Showed you to watch out for fakers and taught you how not to date her
I got it from Master P and J Prince, D-Wreck, Tony Draper
Then I used it just to get paper to sit courtside for the Lakers
What the hell is y'all sayin? I got a ring that say kiss me
Only a loser would diss me like he ain't been watchin history
I held it down for H when Banner first said Mississippi
And held it down for you losers when they was in Chucks and dickies
Rappin backwards on Rap City; yeah that was all in the past
But I don't see no one right now that's bad enough to take all this cash
that's right in my path; new artists yeah they might tell ya you gifted
But you better not get this game twisted
cause that will get you evicted, get out cause

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chamillionaire singing]
Ahhh-hah, one mo' time
Like stay screwed and chopped up, I stay screwed and chopped up
Mayne stay screwed and chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one mo' time</pre>
