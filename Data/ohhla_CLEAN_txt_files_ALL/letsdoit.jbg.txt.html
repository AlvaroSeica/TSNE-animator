[Intro]
Uhhh babyyy yeahhhhh
Yeahhhhhh yeahhh yeahh yeah yea ayyy
Na nanaaaanan ayy

[Chorus]
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you

[Verse 1]
It was like food for all my senses
Our time prices is so expensive
Like water to all dem dry trenches
She had a theme song for every entrance
We had a dinner and a movie, fire up di dubie,
raised vibes for this girl scoot closah to me
I call her babe, she call me boogie
Her beauty, intelligence really moves me

[Chorus]
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you

[Verse 2]
This isn't my first rendez-vous inna relationship
Well rounded graduated with love certificates ayy
She wanna a lover, a lover I'll be
Stimulate yuh body and mentally ayy
Nuh fuss mi straight up mi nah lie
Use up mi shoulder if you waan cry ah
My love is no nuh like no dem other guys
Feel sorry for who signed up cause mi a win first prize

[Chorus]
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you

[Verse 3]
She lookin pretty real nice
Lightly remote she got the perfect body type
Being with you is like being in paradise,
never seen a girl that can live up to da hype ay ay ay

She is Hawaian or Samoan or Fijian, Maori or Tahiti or Tonga
Big up to the caribbean girl dem keep mi propa
I'll be latinos and I love mi sexy mamas
Boog and Corleon givin you a holla

[Chorus]
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you
Nice to nice to know ya let's do it again
How we did it in on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend, to you</pre>
