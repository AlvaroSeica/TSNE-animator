(talking)
[Lil Badness] Who the fuck this is?
[Mobo Joe] What's up man
[LB] Oh what up man
[MJ] You go it?
[LB] Dude, I gots to get paid man
[MJ] Yeah what you got in mind like that?
[LB] Dude, I been scopin' this fuckin bank out for the longest jack.
I gots to hit this motherfucker. I got it planned out perfect.
[MJ] Yeah I'm wit 'cha
 
[Chorus - 2x]
Psycho, I gotta get paid
Big bitch, you move and I'll kill ya
 
[Lil Badness]
Armed and dangerous, wit the gat known as a lunatic
But now it's in my possession, suckers are fearing to this
Meet me at quick Bank Heights, the bookoo money no delay
In my sites first to national, now I gotta get paid, pulled out the guage
Everybody get face down, break for the do', and you'll be 6 feet under ground
Walked to the cashier, fill it up with money to the top
Press the buzzer, and straight up bitch, you gon' get popped
Took the manager in the backround to the safe, get the combination or I'mma unload this 
Get the combination or I'mma unload this 12 guage
I'm gettin paranoid, my finger is on the trigger
I'm breaking in a cold sweat, and I'm startin' to figure
Will I make it out, whats my shortest policy
I guess I'll bring that fine ass hoe over there wit me
Punched the bitch in the face and stole the guard's handcuffs
Clicked it around the wrist, and got a grip on the pump
No cops on the scene, broke out the bank with silence
Pushed the bitch out the car face first on the I-10
Rode to the airport just to make my getaway
Ditched the guage, and got an uzi, like Chuckie, I'm ready to play
And in this gankin' game, I guess I got game to this
That 'less you know, don't fuck, wit a nigga, when he's armed and dangerous
 
[Chorus - 2x]
 
[Lil Badness]
Roamin' the streets at night, hard ass villain on a rampage
No one in sight, dark as fuck and I got a 12 guage
But no money, no car, none of that good shit
The man stopped at the red light then I straight up just snuck the bitch
Said give it up, I want your money, car, and your gold
Wit no hesitation, ya better give it up fool, he broke and drove off
I put the guage in between his tooth, took a breather, and then threatened to shoot
I said stop this car right now ya white musty motherfucker
'cause if you don't, say goodbye 'cause I'm gonna smoke ya
You got 2 seconds to get this bitch to a total stop
'cause if you don't, ya eye out, is gon' get shot
So he stopped, stepped out the car, and he wanted to squall
But he can't squall wit me, because I was packin that iron see
Not down to fight, strictly down to gank niggas
So next time ya see me, you know I mean serious business
I guess I'm loaded, straight up fameless, guess what, yeah, I'm armed and dangerous
 
[Chorus - 2x]
 
[Lil Badness]
Rollin' on that late night, pumpin' off that Magic Mike
Not enough bass so someone gon' get served tonight
Pull over to the gas station, white boy cars I'm dumpin'
Fucked up off of that 40 so I'm gonna get in to somethin'
Walked in the store and put the 9 to the white boy's head
Produce ya car keys bitch or you gon' be dead
Look at the cashier, headed for the front door
Needed me another 40 so I had to rob the store
Jumped in the truck, popped in the Magic Mike tape
With 4 18's you know I was feeling the bass
Rode to the fellas in the parking lot, said give me $50 or a bill forward in rocks
Broke out the money, I got the cash and got ghost
Before I left, I stole his money and his starters coat
Jumped in the truck to make my getaway
The boy in the back had a streetsweeper so he let it spray (*gun shots*)
Peeled off fast and made the glock ???????
Rolled down the window and cocked the gat back in my palm
Popped off 3 shots, the boy dropped, put the gat to his throat, and unloaded
That was all she wrote, turned around, someone said freeze
They fucked up 'cause I gave them hoes a bad dream
