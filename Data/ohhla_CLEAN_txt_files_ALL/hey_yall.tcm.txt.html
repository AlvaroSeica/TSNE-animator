[Chorus]
Hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all hey y'all
What's the deal? What's the haps? Whatcha' say y'all?
Hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all
I know the truth, I know the life, I know the way

[Verse One]
I figured somebody thinks it took Kanye to get us
God spitters the kind of shine that proves that God's with us
Nah player, God's rare
It's typical God here
He makes sure His glory is clear in all spheres and sections
He shows up where you least expect him
This Lord's the blesser  yep - and He's the blessin'
He likes flexin' cause He's perfection
You see these perfections in each direction
After seein' them things look bleak I'm guessin'
Cause you see 'em and you see you need correction
Then you feel like the writer of Psalm 12
The godly's no more, it's so raw it seems like people just want hell

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
The hood can be a beautiful thing
But with no Christ in the city it ain't pretty what the future would bring
We need more than Malcom X and Martin Luther the King
We need "Davids" walkin' the pavement with truth in their sling
And no matter what hood we stroll
We're like the kid that everywhere he looked he only saw tootsie rolls
We see a chance to give people a reason for the hope of believers
Cause though they're breathin' these hopeless people are grievin'
In the streets some are numb but others are still bothered
At the unfit mothers and the unskilled fathers
That's why we plug Christ like an unskilled barber
Rap artists who harvest some plant and some will water
But God'll make it grow and it won't stop
If He's the center like the gum in a blow pop
Remember you're eternal but your dough's not
Your rims, your Timbs, your brims and your clothes rot

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I like to brag on my Righteous Dad
Who saves from the Einsteins to the psychopaths
To the dudes that conclude all of life's so bad
To the slums, to the ones that moved out to the nice ol' pad
And I spit it as a regular dude
Spit after chewin' Holy Writ and this is my regular food
Plus I get with a crew that gets with Him too
We'll get with you even if you never step in a pew
And it's been like this since I was seven
To the point where they now sense I'm a reverend
But I tell 'em til I'm in heaven
I'm reppin' the God who changes lives like 9/11

[Chorus]
