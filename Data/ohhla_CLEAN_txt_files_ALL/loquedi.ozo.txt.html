Ese habla como yo
Y habla muy lindo
Y no es cierto lo que dice
Ese habla como yo
Y habla muy lindo
Y no es cierto lo que dice

Check it out
The way you feelin on the outside
Reflects how you feelin' on the inside
Tell me now have you really ever stopped tryin
So many people killin
Kids still dyin or multiplyin'
I ain't lyin here's my testimony
The shit I kick is real never ever phony
You spittin cheesy lyrics like macaroni
Call me if you only wanna sit down and write a jam
That stands for Somethin'

Because my passion and rage are highly concentrated
This underground music movement is way too underrated
Pop music done came
Had its five seconds of fame
Now it's time to throw a wrench all up in they game

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

I know you feel the pain I conceal
Hip hop flip flopped to gain pop appeal
Upon the backs of MC's with integrity
Rap music made wack a celebrity
I ain't worried why be in a hurry
Giant steps are made in inches and snakes tend to scurry
When my steps are taken no room for move fakin'
Your titles exect your visions blurry so hurry hurry
Catch the force of all my fury
I'm growin leaps and bounds from the mound which you been buried
Feed off yo energy
Two times infinity
MCs are meant to be controllers of mics

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

Ese habla como yo
Y habla muy lindo
Y no es cierto lo que dice

Now the slick text in this here context
is just far too complex too far out to be fetched
So as I sketch check my patterns, my shades and tones
Freak in the microphone is yours truly saucer
The dope rhyme flosser
I got something for all you wankers and tossers..
With dollar budget pushing low grade quality
That's like ghost face sportin some no name walabees

Now I be damned if I sit on my ass
While these MCs tresspass cross my grass
Time to landscape
Reshape the garden for growth
Spread the message overseas, via remote

We got different types of flavas but they taste the same
All biters no writers in this hip-hop game
I blame myself plus you for things we do
It's not wonder why we stay under and don't bust through because..

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing
We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

Ese habla como yo
Y habla muy lindo
Y no es cierto lo que dice

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing
