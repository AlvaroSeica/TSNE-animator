[Chorus One: repeat 2X]
God damn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggaz gon' be feelin this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss

[ASAP Rocky]
Stone cold love, rose gold slugs
I could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rollin stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga
Don't remember me, as a wannabe, New Orleans nigga
slash lean sippin, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do dis!!
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she got a coke feel cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scale but I sold pills
No bill, put her on her feet, toe nails
Them vampires, them blood suckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller
No really real, we chilly chill, don't sport chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm Bounty Killer, I'm bout my scrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it, then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealin my swag
Niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss, slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch, boss, Cristal
We smoking then thinking then burningthat hash
Puff it and pass, makin it last
Walk in my shoes and no crossin my path
Game was for grabs, makin 'em crash
Took in a section and givin it back
(Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life)
(The insights of my trill life)

[Chorus Two]
God damn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feelin this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss

[repeat 4X]
God damn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feelin this</pre>
