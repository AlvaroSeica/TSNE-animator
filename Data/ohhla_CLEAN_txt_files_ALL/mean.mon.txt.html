Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know you're bad, uh
I know you're bad

Homie look at me, yea
Why you mad?
30 chains on, shining like bling
I see you mad
You want me down to my last dollar
On it, holla like I'm mean

There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
Shorty so clean
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
Shorty so clean

Diamonds clip
Million dollar meetings in the air
Fly talk medusa face on everything I'm with
Drop ahead, I'm laid back
I'm countin money, I weighed that
I pop ends, straight jacket
I'll buy a new, I don't trade back

Me and Harry in that 2 door
Got that hoodie when that suit off
Blowing smoke with that roof off, flying high
I'll be ridin round with that marvel on
Got a hundred rounds and a hundred pounds
30 grand, did 100 shows
Got high

They won't comply
They want me on the corner, watch my nigga die
Bad blocks is hell off
Cash in, I chill off
Big shows, I sell out
Real real real, I bail out

Homie look at me, yea
Why you mad?
30 chains on, shining like bling
I see you mad
You want me down to my last dollar
On it, holla like I'm mean

There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
Shorty so clean
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
Shorty so clean

I'm ridin niggs and stars, 8-50 V12
I'm futuristic, clean mic with the sea shells
These, these do my feet
Then place the heat to your cheeks
So I could shoot a beef in Greece
The linen hanging loose now, let the loop down
Doing endos in the coupe, ride with the roof down
And it's pouring rain
Flip around I'll put this knife right through your daughter's name
Smoking different colour, drank when the autumn came
Oh, see me sittin on the sofas leather
No, me and these never worked together
They just want me for these things, I have a quiet
Yo when I told you that I loved you I was lying

Smoke something
Uh
Woo

Homie look at me, yea
Why you mad?
30 chains on, shining like bling
I see you mad
You want me down to my last dollar
On it, holla like I'm mean

There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
Shorty so clean
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
There they go (There they go)
Shorty so clean

Shorty so clean</pre>
