[Werd]
I can't be no Romeo (nah) I'm no Romeo
I said I can't be no Romeo, cant be your Romeo
(I cant be) I'm no Romeo, I'm no Romeo
Cant be no Romeo (I cant be) no Romeo

Lets pretend that the set is Verona
When we fell in love when I held the microphone
I, sang out a song from the street right below you
As she looked out on the sight of a loner
I told her, I sang through a maze of my speech
With the words floating off in the night sky's breeze
Thou-out thy life (without out) I can't be
Cry a puddle from the struggle but the tussle carries me
I'd send you a rose but I'm pierced from the thorn
Start bleeding from my heart to be conveyed in a song
Through the night till the dawn I will fight on and on
And on, and on (and on, and on)
Long, as I know that there's a chance
I can't walk away from this classic romance
But different backgrounds from our fam means I'm pushing it
But I fell in love with this modern day Juliet

I can't be no Romeo (nah) I'm no Romeo
I said I can't be no Romeo, cant be your Romeo
(I cant be) I'm no Romeo, I'm no Romeo
Cant be no Romeo (I cant be) no Romeo

[Mog]
Somewhere between hello and goodbye I put my foot in it
It always starts so well then I manage to go and ruin it
Brushed aside for redefining love and rock n roll
But is it such a crime to this
My pride for something warm to hold?
Bladed wrist band, no fame can cure this man
Unfortunately I can't write my way out of this one
We seek addiction and we chuckle at authority
We cook up fiction and we sprinkle it with honesty
So these memories haunting me are they being fair?
Did I really act so thoughtless was I even there?
Goodbye's the nicest thing I ever said to you
Even if I said it premature and very hastily
Murder was the case for me
Loving wasn't made for me
A brutal truth that I discovered when I tasted you
If youre lonely though we can do the dosey doe
I can be your dance partner but I can't be your Romeo

[Werd]
I can't be no Romeo (nah) I'm no Romeo
I said I can't be no Romeo, cant be your Romeo
(I cant be) I'm no Romeo, I'm no Romeo
Cant be no Romeo (I cant be) no Romeo [x2]

A poet or a writer will never feel the impact
Only recollect to the time when he writ that
As an author expressed through rhyme
He can never go back and hear it the first time [x2]</pre>
