"You better be {f'n} strapped when I see ya" - 5X

[LongShot]
Uh-huh, yeah, okay
Yeah, talk about your big guns
Best bet is to grip one, cause when I cock and spit son
Umm, you, wonder what the clique done
That's the buck and lit dum, comin for the neck - RUN!
If you got niggaz prayin for a bullet scar
Thinkin they gon' be that star, blazin on the boulevard
Large funds be the main reason toast burn
And like the chorus said
You best be fully strapped it's yo' turn
Comin up quick, niggaz dump for dumb shit
So best believe you can get shot slick for that dumb chick
Whoopin loud, look here pal you better calm down
And get the fuck from around these killers
Cause they not clowns
Ain't no jokin, trigger chokin be your last time
Last time dudes play hard that was his last time
ever breathin better bring it if you got one
Cause South Chicago niggaz don't be playin with no pop gun
