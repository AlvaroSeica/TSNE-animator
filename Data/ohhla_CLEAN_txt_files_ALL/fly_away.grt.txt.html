Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The love we share with all
My heartbeat brings resolve
Let's drive a nation to this
Bring peace, spread love for all
I wish we could fly away,
I'm-a take you somewhere far away
Come get with it, oh so sick with it

[Mac Powell]
The love we share with all
My heartbeat brings resolve
Let's drive a nation to this
Spread love for all (Bring peace, spread love for all)
I wish we could fly away
I'm-a take you somewhere far away (right, right)
Come get with it, oh so sick with it

I asked my momma, "How was it back then?"
"What you mean back then?" You know, back when
You were all alone with a bun in the oven
But you grew up in a house, good dad, good lovin

Different parallel, different dynamics
You subjecate life, feel I understand, can't cram it
Can't cry over spoiled milk done damage
Momma ain't cryin', manned up, I managed

Rich Momma, sing your praises from the rooftop
Anybody lay a finger on you, I'm-a pull back the rooftop
Say rooftop, turned green with rage
Folks smashed til their hearts stopped

When a fool begets violence
I'm a fool for you til the fools on trial
And the reason I required a true spirit that true in bed
Fed my mind good bread, which lead to a great life

Now I ain't the sentimental cat
Who just pencils crap for profit
To cater to simple saps who want that mushy rap
Nahh, I just owe that

Respect and regards to how I was raised
Thanks and praise outweighs any amount I could ever repay
My heart and thoughts with you everyday
I put that on my momma' life

The love we share with all
My heartbeat brings resolve
Let's drive a nation to this
Bring peace, spread love for all
I wish we could fly away,
I'm-a take you somewhere far away
Come get with it, oh so sick with it

[Mac Powell]
The love we share with all
My heartbeat brings resolve
Let's drive a nation to this
Spread love for all (Bring peace, spread love for all)
Bring peace (I wish we could fly away),
Spread love for all (I'm-a take you somewhere far away)
Come get with it, oh so sick with it

Raised in the church, stayed in the dirt
Prayed for the grace that I stay on the earth
Got that still played til it hurt
Matter fact, did dirt in the church

Had my first seed, now I got needs
Now I got bills, 'nother mouth to feed
Baby momma drama, she's callin' me
So I holla back, "Try to get me"

Sat down with a dad of a friend
Voice sounded like God in my head
Said, "Son, you too young to lose
And you're livin' to fast on a short fuse"

"Man, God got his hand on your life
So he gave you the gift and a mic (this mic)
And he made you to speak to the soul
Of the young and the old in a world so cold" (so cold)

"So remember these words I told ya (told ya)
Look close at the fork in the road (road)
You only got one life to live
Don't gain it all and still lose your soul" (lose your soul)
Let's Go

I wish we could fly away,
I'm-a take you somewhere far away
Lemme know what's up, what's up, don't you wanna go?

The love we share with all
My heartbeat brings resolve
Let's drive a nation to this
Bring peace, spread love for all (Spread love for all)
I wish we could fly away,
I'm-a take you somewhere far away
Let me know what's up, what's up, don't you wanna go?

[Mac Powell]
