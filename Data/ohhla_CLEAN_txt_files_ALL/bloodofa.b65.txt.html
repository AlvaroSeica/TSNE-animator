Ten thousand horses, Sable island, endless summer
Oh my god, I'm hot to steal, beside myself in friendless number
I ain't got no culture, nothin', dirty words, but that don't count
Flight attendants, waitresses, superstition, good amount
There's work to do, hell to pay, memories and finger prints
Calling Papa ignorance, and I don't wanna go
Zoom, kick, persuasion, tech

Egg and spoon race, slow and steady, desert highway, a bientot
Still I"m stuck, I can't afford it, picture postcards, small memento
Echo shadow, echo shadow, sterling silver, burning furnace
Frozen, nowhere, just a kid I had a friend, named deadly earnest
Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my arm
Praise the heavens, call the cops, relax, there's no cause for alarm
Diamond rings and little babies, startlements and miracles
I remember pretty faces, so severe and lyrical
I'm talking Amelia Earhart, Neko Case or Frida Kahlo
All alone the way it should be, I don't even need a shadow
Seeds of wisdom found no purchase, we don't even have a chance
Birthday party Armageddon, long stem roses, avalanche
Broken fingers, goin' nowhere fast and screeching to a hault
All that work for nothing, uh oh, whipping boy, it's all my fault
Zoom, kick, persuasion, tech

I don't wanna go to pieces, easy going, afraid to fly and so I'm running
Catchin' fish and choppin' wood, the revolution slow time coming
I don't know what else to do, cross my fingers, teach the children
Read your fortune, storm the studios, come on all ye faithful pilgrims
No more same ole song and dance, some good ideas get over played
I eat my breakfast, ride my bike, a knife between my shoulder blades
See, I'm a man of many problems, up against some scary odds
We kill, we hide, we all fall down, idiots love to bury gods
It doesn't happen over night though, never, still I'm filled with wonder
Lonely like the tight rope walker, hitchhiker, long distance runner
Zoom, kick, persuasion tech, good night for you, bad night for me
But I still love you lying down, K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Not bad, not bad, not bad at all, I tried your shoes on
Cigarettes and crucifixes, Ingmar Bergman, Alphonse Mouzon
Really boring modern music, really boring modern girl
Get me out of here, I'm drowning, I don't like this modern world
Anti-intellect and marketing, pretty, pretty, who needs talent
Crying eyes, we're so out numbered, fight for the right to remain silent
But what do I know, who am I, my two left feet, my big dumb face
I'd do the same if I had the chance, cheat the system, rig the race
It's all one big misunderstanding, inside out I turn my coat
Don't look back, don't move a muscle, one false move,t hat's all she wrote
Zoom, kick, persuasion, tech</pre>
