Yo, yooo hey

Hey yo, tell me Beatnuts, yo whatchu gon' do?
Turn it out, turn it out
Uhh!  Turn it out, uhh turn it out
Hey yo, c'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out
Uhh, c'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out

[JuJu]
Yo where my niggaz at?  Buy up the bar - roll a trizzie
right out of the jar and let the bullets fly outta they car
Put the pressure on whatever they are
Live niggaz yo, you gotta hit the head or the heart
Oh it's money man?  Handle your biz -- we the ones
that'll strangle your kids, make the pitbulls mangle your Wiz
Make it hotter than Los Angeles is
Cause if we don't see a profit kid, nobody lives

[Psycho Les]
Aiyyo we run up in the club, and herb every bouncer
Run up on stage and snatch a mic from the announcer
Beatnuts, don't get it twisted, this ain't salsa
Les the one that signed your bitch's chest like a voucher
I'm about ta, turn it up a little louder
Beats smack a little harder, got you sayin how the..
.. HELL did you do that over there?
Twist up nigga, there's buddha in the air, and

[Greg Nice]
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out
Gettin cash money what we be about bout
Gettin cash money what we be about bout
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out
Gettin cash money what we be about bout

[JuJu]
Yo.. aiyyo somethin better happen tonight, I got money
and the bitches is right, plus I ain't thinkin bout
startin a fight - but if I do I'll be the last nigga standin
Sippin J.D. at the bar, holdin the cannon
My niggaz get wild like that, yo we don't even like to
smile like that, c'mon I'm takin it to trial like that
Catch me chillin at the VIP's
All the bitches like pointin at me, you know it's me, what?

[Psycho Les]
We're bout to turn it out (I repeat) turn it out
Put it out and let the DJ's burn it out
As soon as, the needle drop, it got your crew bouncin
Beatnuts, feelin this, through the 2000
Rapin loops innocently, cop anything
produced by me, and win instantly, yo!
This is THAT shit you gon' peep in your CD
Beatnuts, and my nigga Greg N-I-C-E

[Greg Nice]
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out

Gettin cash money what we be about bout
Gettin cash money what we be about bout
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out
C'mon c'mon c'mon just turn it out, out
Gettin cash money what we be about bout
Gettin cash money what we be about bout

Gettin cash money what we be about bout
Gettin cash money what we be about bout
Gettin cash money what we be about bout
