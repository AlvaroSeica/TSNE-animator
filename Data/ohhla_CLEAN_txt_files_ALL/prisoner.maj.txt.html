Typed by: Cno Evil

[Madam Majestic]
I roll from night to night to find thee
To wait to break the chain that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command that stand and wait now
From one whose master of my fate now
I can't escape, it's much too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love

*Ah-la-la-la'ing*

[Madam Majestic]
It's the good of mine to carry, and, someone to sharing
In those arms with me
Although we have loved, I can't have another
For I'm not free...
He's in my dreams, awake or sleeping
Upon my knees, to him, I'm creeping
Our very soul is in his keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love...
I'm just a prisoner of love...

*Ah-la-la-la'ing*</pre>
