ahhh ah ah ahhh
ahhhhh ah ahhh
whatchalookin@?
(x4)

don't know much
but I'm outta touch
ain't a thing for me to do
wanna waste my time
but I lose my mind
every time that I watch the news
I say no no no
not another show
but there's always some debut
wanna waste my time
gonna lose my mind
cuz it just gives me the blues

won't go searching on the internet
don't wanna read another text
won't get lost inside the box
think I really wanna turn it off
(x2)

click click
I can't find what I came for
click click
I can't find what I'm looking for
click click
I hate it but I want more
I'm so lost just turn it off say
(x2)

ahhh ah ah ahhh
ahhhhh ah ahhh
whatchalookin@?
(x4)

all day long
it's the same old song
not a thing for me to do
wanna feed my mind
but I never find
anything worth seeing thru
I say please no way
come another day
lemme sit here for a few
wanna clear my mind
wanna have my time
don't need anything from you</pre>
