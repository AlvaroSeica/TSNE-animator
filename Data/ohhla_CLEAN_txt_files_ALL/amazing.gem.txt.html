Chorus:
[Big Gemini] Now from your lips to your hips
             From your walk to your talk
[Ace 1]      Bitch, you was amazin'
             I can't explain it, little mama
[Big Gemini] You must be somethin' to me
             Stuck in my head
[Ace 1]      And the way that you movin'
             It's makin' wanna
             Oooh
             And oooh, yeah
             Bitch, you got me on fire
             There's no denyin' it
             Mama
             Oh, I don't need no wife or no kids
             I'm just try see what the business is
             Oooh, yeah

[Big Gemini]
(Verse 1)
From so far
Just tryin' to get to know you, girl
And bring ya ass into Gem's world (But hold on)
I do this shit like no other
Ice cold in the summer
Iceberg colored, how much you know, muh'fucker
Now back to ya
Look at that ass on ya
You said, "I made you with a little extra somethin' on ya"
Well, I can tell what you meanin' when you strollin' by
And I agree cause that ass, she got my Hypnotized
You so exotic, so erotic, if you got it girl, flaunt it
Say you got them goods, where them goodies, I want it
Just a little sample, but there's time for that
No need to rush and try to tackle down your quarterback
Let's take it
Slow and easy and coast in slow motion
Ride shotgun and you could sip that love potion
It's just somethin' 'bout ya ass
I can't lie
But I'm a put my fingers on it where
I'm a try

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm just tryin' to
Figure out where we go from here
My place or your place
And if she got a man (I understand)
I ain't try to make you mine, baby, press rewind
She told me herself, "You need excitement in your life"
So let's ride
Those lips, that face, it's just somethin' about it
And that look you just gave, oh, you ain't shy 'bout it
I know you ready, baby
You know I'm ready, too
You say you got them goods, well, we gon' see if it's true
Hop out the ride, time to sip some more
And we can get better aquainted on the bed or the floor
I ain't bangin' slow jams, I'm bangin' UGK
I'm sayin', "Take It Off, chick, bend over, let me see it"
Hey
Hey
That's what the business is
You a rider, baby girl, you know what time it is
It's just somethin' 'bout ya ass, though
I can't lie
But I'm a put my fingers on it where
I'm a try

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Ace 1
Girl, you so damn fine
You know that's what you are (Oooh, yeah)
You drivin' me crazy, little lady
Cause you know just what I want (Oooh, yeah)
I ain't tryin' verse you into nothin'
Little mama, that's just what it is (Oooh, yeah)
I ain't tryin' be your man
I'm just try see what the business is (Oooh, yeah)

Repeat Chorus

[Ace 1]
Baby
You was amazin'
Baby
You drivin' me crazy
Baby
You was amazin'
Baby
You drivin' me crazy
Crazy
Oooh, yes you are
Oooh, you are, you are
Yeah
Yeah</pre>
