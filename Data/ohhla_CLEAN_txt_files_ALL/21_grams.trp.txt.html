[Promoe]
Yeah, drop it, uh, come on..
21st century
My people workin 24/7 for 24 carats of gold
With 21 grams I've sold, I'm 28 years old
By the time you hear this rhyme I might have turned 29, 'cause
Time flies to 21 thousand feet
I'm in a hurry, spit 20 some rhymes per beat
'Cause pretty soon the human race will be obsolete
And all our so-called leaders do is just talk so sweet
The facts forbidden my tracks are hidden
It flows laxative, but lacks the rhythm
Talking 'bout economics, politics plus religion
It all equals what they want us to give'em
And now they standing there, getting theirs but getting 'nuttin
They probably can't spell love only more production
That suction, pointing out core corruption
But I'm obstructing their laws (So what's up then)
Hit me with 41 shots from a Glock 21 hand-gun
My grandma said she had that hell of a grandson
With 21 albums, if anyone asked
They took my life but couldn't find my

[Chorus]

[Promoe]
21 chika grams I've sold
(With each man must hold)
Stay in the zone
('Til he dead and gone)
It's hard to keep the faith
(So all my people say)
Only love can ease the pain, c'mon
With 21 grams I've sold
(With each man must hold)
Stay in the zone
('Til he dead and gone)
It's hard to keep the faith
(So all my people say)
Only love can ease the pain,(ease the pain)

[Supreme]
Some people carry the weight of the world on their shoulder
With so much grace, you pray for them not to fall over
Some fold under the pressure depressed by heavy drugs
Some get the load of their chest with lead slugs
Some let their best years pass, stressing for tons of cash
Then pass away with 'nuttin but 21 grams
And some believe Fox news, some in religous rules
Like entrance at the pearly gates was for us to choose
Someone to control, my body and soul
So they told us we could never make it on our own (They dead wrong)
Someone to be picture perfect amputies
Weight watchin anorectics blinded by TV
Some can't sleep 'cause their pounding heartbeat
With minded my milligrams to the vein will make the pain leave
Others walk lighthearted tell the day they drop
Were singin All you need is love but all we got is

[Chorus]

[Promoe]

21 chika grams I've sold
(With each man must hold)
Stay in the zone
('Til he dead and gone)
It's hard to keep the faith
(So all my people say)
Only love can ease the pain, c'mon
With 21 grams I've sold
(With each man must hold)
Stay in the zone
('Til he dead and gone)
It's hard to keep the faith
(So all my people say)
Only love can ease the pain,(ease the pain)

[Cos.m.i.c]
21st century, life style western way
Where the best gets paid and the rest gets slayed
If not yesterday, you gon' be dead this day
My people trying out (There's gotta be a better way)
'Cause you know, they do everything they can to feed you nonsense
But the beat is pumpin' so yo we need 'nuttin
More than love in the warmin' sun
When it's cold outside you and me form as one, and live on
This song is just so and so long
But we'll be here 25 to life and beyond
I see it coming clearer perfect 20/20 vision
Evil souls try to murder my ambition
But this shit is destined from the beginning
Yo, can't do nothing about it and in the end
The weight of your total knowledge is none
But the sum of all souls probably weighs a ton

[Chorus]

21 chika grams I've sold
(With each man must hold)
Stay in the zone
('Til he dead and gone)
It's hard to keep the faith
(So all my people say)
Only love can ease the pain, c'mon
With 21 grams I've sold
(With each man must hold)
Stay in the zone
('Til he dead and gone)
It's hard to keep the faith
(So all my people say)
Only love can ease the pain,(ease the pain)

(Outro)

[Promoe]

21 gun salute and when each man must shoot
To reap the fruit in a three peace suite
We must defeat the hate
All my people say
Only love can ease the pain
With 21 gun salute (When each man must shoot)
To reap the fruit (In a three-peace suite)
We must defeat the hate (So all my people say)
Love can ease the pain</pre>
