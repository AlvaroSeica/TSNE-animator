Does he do it {*6X*}
Like I do it {*6X*}

[Trey Songz]
When you first showed me the kitten, girl you knew I was a freak (damn right)
You knew ya swag was gon do somethin to me
You keep tellin me one day you his, then one day you want me
Won't you stop all the pretendin what the busines gon be
I've been promisin you something more than jus' a couple weeks
Been rollin round and jumpin in and out bed
A real decisions what I need and girl it's time for you to make it
And while ya takin it look at me girl and tell me one thing

[Chorus]
Does he do it {*6X*}
Like I do it {*6X*}
When you do it bet he don't do it like I do
Your here tonight and I got to know
You and me tonight and I got to know

[Trey Songz]
When you be home
Do you sometimes get so
Frustrated cause he wanna stay to long
I'm missin you callin on the batphone
Tryna see what tonight gon here for
When you with him do sometimes kinda wish that it was us
Posted up in the kitchen you teachin me how to cook
Then it pop off on the counter and we make alot of fuss
Then I take over the teachin and you know what i'll do first

[Chorus]
Does he do it {*7X*}
Like I do it {*7X*}
Does he do it {*7X*}
Like I do it {*7X*}
When you do it bet he don't do it like I do

[Bridge]
Tell me do like, do like the way I pull your hair
Tell me do like, do like the way I go down there
Tell me do like it how I make you yell and scream out, yeah
Tell me don't you like how I do it when you can't catch your breath

[Trey Songz]
Do he play wit' ya hair
Does he love you there
Do he spank you from the back
Do he do it like that

Does he do it {*6X*}
Like I do it {*6X*}
When you do it bet he don't do it like I do
Your here tonight and I got to know
You and me tonight and I got to know</pre>
