Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Niggas
If you thugged out nigga
Put your motherfuckin hoods in the air
Boosie bad ass, Foxx nigga

[Chorus x2]
How you livin, I'm thugged out
How you livin, I'm thugged out
How you livin, I'm thugged out
How you livin, I'm thugged out
All day, everyday
All day, everyday
All day, everyday
All day, I'm thugged out

[Foxx]
I wake up in the morning
In my gangster ass bed
Brush my gangster ass teeth
Brush my gangster ass head
Call my gangster ass bitch
Get some gangster ass head
Put my gangster ass dick
Between her gangster ass legs
I'm a G.A.N.G.-STA
You already know
Been thuggin since I left Hurricane Long in 84
I know niggas bout that murda, murda
Bustin that uzi, aint gone let me live, they been paid they gotta do it
On that fluid I'm ridiculous
Retarded
Illiturate
I'm throwed off
Aint got it all
My friends become my enemies
I used to be on medication but that aint no remedy
Two guns black on semedy
I talk you hear Jimeney
That mean crickets
The hood listen when I talk
And when I talk, the hood listen
Feel what I'm spittin?
My daddy daddy thugged hard
So what you think gone be the future for my little boys?
Glocks, Nn bodyguards

[Chorus x2]

[Boosie]
Mane, I'm thuggin all day everyday
All my hoes fade away
All my niggas toatin Ks
Smokin on that purple haze
Same click since [?]
Stompin in my Levi's
Grind hard, shine hard, look at me you see why
I'm so fly, my 45 knock buttons off your shirt
Grab money all day, I aint fuckin wit that work
I like big money
Small money
My money
Yo money
Short money
Tall money
From now on just call me MONEY!
I'm on the grind you should see this shit
They in a single file line tryin to eat my dick
We thug monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday
Weekends I'm gone every show I bump 30
So twirk, shake it for the camera
Pistol with the hammer same shape as Louisiana
I grab ya up in broad day nigga
Fuck what cha say nigga
Its kill or be killed round my way nigga

[Chorus x2]</pre>
