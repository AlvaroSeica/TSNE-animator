Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Kyle say that
He don't care
Don't give a fuck
Dont cut his hair
And
Had a party
Drinkin' brews
Cops bust in
All sick of booze and
He'll say surrender me
Catch him if you can mother fucker
Listen all you people get out his way
Set aside and close you eyes and listen what he's sayin'
I ain't got no alibis oh
I ain't got no indecision
Undecided unignited
Watch the sparks fly in the air
We say that
Jurisdiction
Overload
No one enter
Without a code and
Stainless steel
What keeps us in
He's busted out by by
One of his friends and
Now he's straight and out on the streets he say that
Catch him if you can motherfucker
Listen all you people get out while y'all still can
Step aside and close your eyes and listen to the band sayin'
I ain't got no alibis so
I ain't got no indecision
Undecided unignited
Watch the sparks fly in the air oh
Oh oh oh whoa
He'll say surrender me
Catch him if you can mother fucker
Listen all you people get out of his way
Step aside and close your eyes and listen to what he's sayin'
I ain't got no alibis oh
I ain't got no indecision
Undecided unignited
Watch the sparks fly in the air
We say that
I ain't got no (i ain't got no)
I ain't got no (i ain't got no)
I ain't got no (i ain't got no)
I ain't got no
No alibis
We ain't got no alibis for you
No we ain't got no alibis for you .... No alibis</pre>
