Microphone check 1-2, 1-2
Testin, testin
40 Water in this bitch, mayne
40 in this thang, brah
Look
Hey
That nigga got it crackin
This nigga got it goin on
He a fool
Biatch
Funky fresh for the two-thou-wow-eleven shot, bitch

Maaan... I shoulda been a p, got the wordplay of a pimp
Talk a monkey off a banana tree, but I guess that it was meant
To peddle d and push broccoli, lobster and shrimp
Go on a spendin spree, give a fuck how much I spend
Players don't keep score, players keep a hoe
When she bring me back my chow, I tell her next time bring mo'
8 tonight, a dinner with bosses
All concrete, all solide, no cross artists
Hear ye hear ye, come one come all
40 Water got some real talk for y'all
The big homie got a horn, he behind them walls
I'm 'bout to plug him in and put him on this conference call
He said (Real niggas unite, fuck the lame
We gon' weed these suckers out and pour 'em through a strain
Mash on these marks and flood the ave's
Lower our rates and make hella cash)
Okay

(Tho-tho-tho-tho) Mayne, this bassline is stubby
(Tho-tho-tho-tho) This the shit like Huggies
(Tho-tho-tho-tho) This thang dumb-ass slap
(Tho-tho-tho-tho) Man, 40 takin 'em back

It's that shit that I miss (40 takin 'em back)
This what I grew up with (40 takin 'em back)
It make me feel like I used to (He takin 'em back)
Way back in 1992 (Mayne, 40's takin 'em back)
I'ma drink to this, mayne (He takin 'em back)
I'ma smoke to this, mayne (He takin 'em back)
I'ma get high tonight (Mayne, 40 takin 'em back)
Get so drunk I wanna fight (40 takin 'em back)

West-West, California, killers and thugs
Where niggas get cooked in front of the clubs
Where fiends take drugs to get off drugs
Where the fuzz wear wires and plant bugs
Where the traumers drift and smoke pipe
Where they crawl on the rug lookin' for white
Where you can get your dick sucked in the broad daylight
And get your crown cracked just like a headlight
In Northern Cali we playin the game of life, truth or dare
Where a perfect day can easily become a perfect nightmare
Mr. Officer, I'm sober I ain't been drinkin, I ain't perkin
You can use the breathilizer, mayne, I'm cleaner than detergent
I'm old school like 'with the quickness'
Not a internet thug but I'm with the Siccness
Don't nobody wanna take the stairs, everybody wanna take the escalator
Don't nobody wanna work for theirs, everybody stay lookin for a favor
Dawn to dusk, Hustlers R Us, penitentiary chances, tasers and handcuffs
Grind, push, get your money, sidehop
Whether you're still on the block or got a regular job

It's that shit that I miss (40 takin 'em back)
This what I grew up with (40 takin 'em back)
It make me feel like I used to (He takin 'em back)
Way back in 1992 (Mayne, 40's takin 'em back)
I'ma drink to this, mayne (He takin 'em back)
I'ma smoke to this, mayne (He takin 'em back)
I'ma get high tonight (Mayne, 40 takin 'em back)
Get so drunk I wanna fight (40 takin 'em back)
