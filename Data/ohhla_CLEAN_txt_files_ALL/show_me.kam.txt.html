(Intro)
Yeah, Kamach Ill-Zaar, Regime
JuJu Mob, Cult Status, kno'm'sain
Mic Messiah, Cult Status
Pull out ya canvas
Let's go at it

[Chief Kamachi]
By the listeners request I'm here in the flesh
My voice will put an African spear in ya chest
So don't tempt me, black palms slap on the djembe
Perform across the globe with my ritual kente
Feel high like the hills where the Indian men pray
Mach the Messiah, listen what the King say
Pop's in heaven, props where the Jinns stay
Music still nutritious like brown rice and tempeh
So in hell when I serve the resin
It's soul surah, the urban legend
Number one will deserve a seven
Do you get it? I'm on a throne possessed with it
In the zone and a pen in my hand finesse vivid
Capture minds, now I got obsessed critics
It's raw he spit it, oh boy he did
It's the word magician so take the further listen
As I baptize minds like these words were Christian

(Hook) 2x
I'm Supreme! Supreme Deity
Do you wanna go to war, wanna play with me?
Vou tu be dalil
I doubt that you could spit properly fo'real
I shout...

[Chief Kamachi]
Kamachi the sage of the spoken word page
Here to fight for the freedom of these musical slaves
Captain Crook, I saw the pirate ways
Ghetto Gabri-el stay posted up in the skies for days
These the eyes of a psychic reader
Looks like I just lit the brightest reefer
These jewels that I drop gimme the right to teach her
Many shine but the question is whose light is weaker?
I strong arm with these African fighting features
From the jungles where the war scars mark ya face
I'm the bomb like the Middle Eastern market place
This the song of a warrior that march with grace
And they target me with preschool archery
I'm too electrical, when I'm shining
Let my aura fuck with ya retinal
The gatekeeper of the great African festival
So don't let Kamach cause spectacle

(Hook) 2x

[Chief Kamachi]
Put dirt on my kingly fabrics, I can't have it
Let my shell shake the cabinet
From the pistol speechless that's elaborate
Represent the children of addicts
Look to them lavish, here with the medical examiners baggage
Yellow tape my music it's madness
Like ghetto gun clashes, CD's sell wherever blood splashes
Crime scene camera flashes
For the rare paint to gush from ya gashes
And this is what they push to the masses
Turn bodies in a ritual ashes
20 a bush, Indian kush, I tint up my glasses
Saifullah! Kamach! Ill-Zaar! It's the Regime!
And y'all just can't pass us!

(Hook) 2x

(Outro)
It's the Messiah!! Chief Kamach!!
And we live from Philadelphia!!
C'mon...!!
You're in Good Hands right now

(Movie sample)
"When life itself seem lunatic, who knows where madness lies?
Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams- this may be madness
To seek treasure where there is only trash.  Too much sanity may be madness
And maddest of all, to see life as it is and not as it should be"</pre>
