Twenty some years is a long walk even if it's not in a straight line
You see a lot of things in the distance, y'know what they say about great minds
You and I think about the same things, dream the same dreams, play the same games
We started out in the same place, believe it or not we've got the same names
Everything happens for a good cause, whether it be victory or loss
And the road may turn into a runway, but you don't know what to do someday
Trust me, I've seen it all before, I've climbed to the tops of the tallest trees
To get away from the deep water, to find a touch of the smallest breeze
Go find a girl with a low voice, who holds the world in her bare hands
You'll fall in love, you've got no choice, once you are given a fair chance
For the first time you will sleep well, take a deep breath, see the sun shine
Hold onto her for dear life, and then watch the whole world unwind
Ask her to show you some magic and I guarantee that she'll say yes
Tell her that 'you've seen forever and we will be together not a day less'
Just know until that time comes and after you've crossed that first mile
That the hardest part is behind you and all of the pain only worthwhile

From storm clouds come angels, let pain give you pleasure
From dirt grows the flower, when faith can't be measured
From storm clouds come angels, let pain give you pleasure
From dirt grows the flower, when faith can't be measured</pre>
