[Verse 1]
I got my cup I got my drink poured
I got these pretty bitches actin' like skank whores
Grabbing they ankles and I'm so grateful
That I was born with a gift you couldn't have paid for
Hey Y'all
I can't get enough
Blake brought me the beat so I could bring the funk
I'm young Bootsy baby got on my star shades
And my game's so tight I should own me an arcade
Lil homie it's all day
I don't stop
I won't quit I'm killing it Ong Bak
Get ready the onslaught is around the bend
It's no mercy so a motherfucker's bound to win

[Chorus]
I said you might call us country but we's only Southern
I know you feeling this man tell me one who doesn't
I'm buzzin that drink all in my cup when
I see the law I'm screaming fuck them
What it do
I'm screaming what it do
I'm like what it do
I'm screaming what it do yeah

[Verse 2]
I got the stash box with the purp inside
I smoke that hippy shit like I be wearing Birkenstocks
And that's word to my partners with long hair
Man tell 'em we don't care come test us they don't dare
Cuz we're too much for them
I'm on Perelli's and these suckers on them busted rims
Riding round town lookin like a hurt cat
Talking shit and be acting like I ain't heard that
Get off my nutsack and get your own life
This ain't the country we ain't puffing on no corn pipes
I took my chances like some rolled dice
Ever since a young'n screaming motherfuck the po-lice
What it do

[Chorus]
I said you might call us country but we's only Southern
I know you feeling this man tell me one who doesn't
I'm buzzin that drink all in my cup when
I see the law I'm screaming fuck them
What it do
I'm screaming what it do
I'm like what it do
I'm screaming what it do yeah

[Verse 3]
This for the Ville this for the real folks
This for the Caddys and Prices riding on steel spokes
This for Sundays out at Cox's
This for hanging out windows acting obnoxious
This is for the West End this for Cassius Clay
This for everyone I grew up with that done passed away
This for my fam people I'd kill for
The fuck you think I've been trying to get this deal for
So we can live more and we can shine big
Them big faces'll let 'em know what the time is
You can come and find me I ain't where the cows are grazing
But you just might hear them 40 cals a-blazing

[Chorus]
I said you might call us country but we's only Southern
I know you feeling this man tell me one who doesn't
I'm buzzin that drink all in my cup when
I see the law I'm screaming fuck them
What it do
I'm screaming what it do
I'm like what it do
I'm screaming what it do yeah</pre>
