[Pep Love]
we ahead of the charts
man we better than smart
we going get up in this industry and tear it apart
we the hierpariants
and you rappers is fuckin' parrots
I get 'embarrassed
When I hear it
but still I grin and bear it
Hierogyphics is your worst nightmare
since inseption
and I know that hurt right there
but accept it
we inherit the Earth right here
in the present
ressurrecting the first idea
