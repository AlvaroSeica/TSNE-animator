[ CHORUS ]
(Hip-Hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park)
Yeah, that's a quote from MC Shan
Without it, I'd be an empty man
I say
(Hip-Hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park)
Yeah, that's a quote from MC Shan
Without it, I'd be an empty man
I say
(Hip-Hop) is the way we talk you know
(Hip-Hop) is the way we walk, it's all
(Hip-Hop) is the clothes, the style
Little brothers see the grill every time we smile
It's all
(Hip-Hop) is the love, the life, you know
(Hip-Hop) is the dubs, the ice, it's all
(Hip-Hop) on the m-i-c
Your favorite hardcore rapper in the place to be

[ VERSE 1: Pacewon ]
Yeah
Raise the banner
MC's, it's time for you to man up
Cock your hammers
But instead of bustin off slugs we use grammar
Rappers better dip like Juelz Santana
Cause rappers nowadays are weak, they want grandma
While real MC's got more gifts than Santa
Chillin like a bat inside the Wayne manor
It ain't fair we get to climb the same ladder
Risin to the top I take a look around
And there I see 'em actin like a hooker now
They think they gettin back
But what they don't know is the songs they sellin wack
If they hustle, I wish they'd get back to sellin crack
I wanna pack they CDs up and sell 'em back
I paid 12, just give me 7 back
I'll even take it back to the store and get it wrapped
Yo

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Pacewon ]
Your rhymes are weak, I don't mean to insult ya
But you're an embarrassment to the culture
So I don't want you representin me
You're not ready mentally, friends with the enemy
But I'm the remedy, quick as a centipede
My own posse like it's freakin ten of me
I don't know why these record labels signin
If bein wack was breakin the law you'd be a convict
Locked up behind bars
I throw on my hiking boots and climb charts
All from the skills I got, I stay true to it
You wanna take hip-hop and neuter it
I wanna take hip-hop and tutor it
Update all the rap heads new to it
If I'm lonely add my freakin crew to it
Write a jam and all my people move to it
