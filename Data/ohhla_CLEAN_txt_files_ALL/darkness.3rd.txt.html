Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"You are sleeping!  You do not want to believe.
 You are sleeping!"

* DJ Richie Rich cuts
 "Guide you out of triple stage darkness" -&gt; Rakim, +I Ain't No Joke+
 and Chuck D saying "Follow for now!" *

	"Prime Minister!"

[Pete Nice]
Black zone darkness, void as snakepit
So I'ma spit a lyric at the packed lip
Sit stunned I drum lyrics in your egg case
Space filled, darkness a blank face
Recognize unknown throne at deep depths
A Prime Minister incites a slow death
of a rational thought through the physical
Triple Stage Darkness, first stage lyrical
Sight to see, a piece of the Serch-light
Truth is loose, lips slips to Twilight Zones
Prone to blow revision
I'm 20/20 and your in-tune is in prison
Switchin from this track, move back in motion
Unaware of your own evolution
Regress through the tunnels and flee light
Illumination, the first stage, my birthright

* DJ Richie Rich cuts
 "Guide you out of triple stage darkness" -&gt; Rakim, +I Ain't No Joke+

[MC Serch]
Deaf, dumb and blind, the 3rd Bass find
you move further away from the swine
As I rhyme and effects your slide into tape decks
Light black in your face, what do you do next?
The question posed -- you're livin in delerium
Serch speakin in a spasm, can't you see him?
But you can't see the light's dim, it's growin darker
Cut off from the knowledge, un-smarter
Depart from the norm, completing a born to born
from opportunity, comes a thunderstorm
that sets in, tricked by the trickster
The only way out is DJ, Night, or Prime Minister
You follow, but attention span is minimal B
Now you're lost, never thought of intellectually
The 3rd's word, guide you as we spark this
Cause you're blind in the second stage of darkness

* DJ Richie Rich cuts

	"Prime Minister"

[Pete Nice]
As I move, I soothe like stimuli
Not professor of hype, ask why
some fable'll hold true to written word
Over lessons of life, the 3rd of Bass
Face up, step to a devil
Not takin, but remain invisible
Men judge by passin a mountain
called Caucus, and ignorants are mouthin

[MC Serch]
Fallacy, the great fall, fell in disgrace
How can hatred uplift a race?
Not a dribbler or watermelon picker
Givin you the Gas Face, as I'm dickin ya
DOWN DOWN DOWN, but up from Sa-tan
Knowledge is a child with a mind and a crayon
Brilliance in difference, tracin true sight
Third stage knowledge, brought forth a new light
