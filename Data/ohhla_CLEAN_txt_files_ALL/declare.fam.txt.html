[Timbo King]
I'm like salt, lyrics giving you high blood pressure
Taste the sodium cuz my supply's fresher
The mic tester catchin you off guard, back turn
Flammable, alcohol, you suffer from rap burns
Mediocre, more props then stock brokers
Your knowledge don't stress than far, so stop jokers
Wise wonder speaking a language that's broken
Picking jewels, one arrow poking on the barrel smoking
Without curses, my verses is causing threats
I'm taking rookie bets, beating rookies and you vets
We fight unfair, I declare war time
National Geographically, talk war rhymes

I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face getting hype now
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face, in your face, in your face
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face getting hype now
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face, in your face, in your face

You catch a swollen ten, all hail the Royal men
Sting like a scorpion, World War 3 begin
We bring noise like white boys at rock shows
I got flows that'll rip up the top pros
Here's the formula, I'm warning you, you're raggety
Feel the agony, I come down like false gravity
Three dimensional, I understand the true signifigance
Guaranteed solid, no man could put a dent in this
The communist, I'm running this like a marathon
I rap's beyond babylon, when the tatter's on
I take a rhyme then mould it like pottery
It's about time that we rule economincally

I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face getting hype now
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face, in your face, in your face
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face getting hype now
I declare war right now, right now
I declare war!

If I cross over, let me cross like Felipe
My flow got you hooked, best rewind, instant replay
Connect verses, I'm three-sixty like the Earth is
The verbal villain, I can't stand snakes and serpents
Royal men do Royal things, act fly, clip your wings
Giving your eyepieces black rings
Majestic, here's the mic, son, your test
You the type of that signed quick cuz you stressed
Checkmate, my vocal box is like hard rocks
Move, I rush through like a large ox
Explicit, even cops want to frisk it
I'm nice with the words on the mic, dungeonistic

I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face getting hype now
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face, in your face, in your face
I declare war right now, right now
Universal kings in your face getting hype now
I declare war right now, right now
I declare war!</pre>
