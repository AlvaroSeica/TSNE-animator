[Jamie Foxx speaking]
I know you see me lookin' at you
And I know he know you lookin' at me
Well, damn

[Chorus]
DJ won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freaky love song
She's lookin' at me kind of hard, I can tell that things ain't right on the
home front
What she really needs is a G like me to beat a beat, beat it, beat it

[Verse 1 - Jamie Foxx]
I can see how you want it baby
Wish your man wasn't here with ya baby
I can see (ha) curiosity (ha ha)
Gotcha wanna try me (ha ha)
Homeboy can't please ya (ha ha)
On this wall in the open baby
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin' baby
(Ha Ha) You want it
(Ha ha) I know it
(Ha ha) Gotta notion to pull yo ass up outta here

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx]
Baby, I got things that I wanna say
Won't you meet me in the bathroom
We can pull a freaky episode, I got my Beretta if the nigga come through
Baby, I know he ain't treatin' you right
Lady, look at yo bad ass
(Turn around) ooh (turn around) ooh (damn you fine) ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3 - Twista]
Tell me why he did you wrong
Need to get up with the Twista I been sippin' on Patr√≥n
Stroke it when I hold them legs up
He can take you out to dinner and look like a playa
I'ma give it to you good up in the elevator
He be actin' all soft when he get in them draws
I'm a break you off and fuck you up against the wall
Fixin' move up in that slot cause I'm somethin' he not
And he don't know what he got, I'm in the drop top
To get the twat I got a knot, no more runnin' from the cops
Now I'm rollin' with Foxx because the block's hot
But I'm always a G, cause I come from the streets
And I got heat for whoever thinkin' they want some
No more fuckin' with them lames, now you rollin' with a thug
So tell that nigga to (Beat it, beat it)

[Chorus 2X]

DJ play this girl a song
Turned her out, damn that clown, ain't been down
DJ play this girl a song</pre>
