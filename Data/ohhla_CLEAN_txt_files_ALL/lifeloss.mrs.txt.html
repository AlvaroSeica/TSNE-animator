You know what?
I never put my business in the street, nigga
But right now, I'm fuckin' pissed off about all these rumors
And all them motherfucking things that people saying
Ya heard me?
Y'all don't know shit about what happened between me and No Limit
Let me tell you something
P raised me as a youngster, ya heard?
All the way up to a man
And that's something that nobody can take from me
He put battle decisions in me and I made my decision, ya heard?
Now I'm out there trying to do what I gotta do
My stripes is mine
Can't nobody take them from me
I ain't no beef, ya heard?

I'd be lying if I say No Limit, I don't miss 'em
Can't you tell, I'm doing this song in tears, tryin' not to forget 'em
See ya at my final breathing, my final thoughts
I know my Tank days have crossed my mind and look here, smile in my heart
I smoke weed more now just to ease away the pain
I drink more at night wishing things were simply, just the same
It ain't been a night when I look at my tattoos and wonder if I'm more
If being a winner in this rap game will make you lose a friend, then I'm a take it off
For real homie, I miss all the good times
Could you imagine fifty thousand people scream for Mystikal and he a friend of mine
In time, I make y'all understand what it meant to be with TRU
But for right now I'm a close my eyes and wish I was still wit' 'chall and you

Can I, can I, can I take a wife and
Can I, can I, can I live my life and
Can I, can I, can I smile today
Will I ever find a place where all the thugs play

Too many we lost, too many we missed, ay' yo
Too many we lost, too many we missed, ay' yo
Too many we lost, too many we missed, ay' yo
Will I ever find where all the thugs hide and play

Picture me doing my thing and making a million dollars
Picture my cousin Randall ain't here no more, but shit, I'm a holla'
Cause I know you up above and lookin' down on me
I know you felt the pain when your cousin had to walk
And do what he had to do but you was still there for me
Cause I felt like a soul guided me through my conflicted images and all of my pains
In this life, I'm standing outside on the concrete in the storming rain
It's like it's falling down on my head and all I see is black
I still look at my Tank late at night and say, "damn, I just wanna go back"
But I guess I gotta ride the road that I done rode
And take the ride that I done took
And look back at my life and say "what I am is what you see, so get a good look"
Cause I won't be here too long, I'm a sing another song
And I'm a sit back and smoke one for all the homies that's gone, ya heard?

Can I, can I, can I take a wife and
Can I, can I, can I live my life and
Can I, can I, can I smile today
Will I ever find a place where all the thugs play

Too many we lost, too many we missed, ay' yo
Too many we lost, too many we missed, ay' yo
Too many we lost, too many we missed, ay' yo
Will I ever find where all the thugs hide and play

Well you know what, I made my battle decision
You put me out here, it's out here like that
And I said what I had to say
But what I want to say back, is like to Silkk
You my dogg, you my little brother
You know, it'll always be like that homie, ain't nothing gon' change
C-Murder, my partner in crime, when you swung I swung
You had my back, I had your back
Remember the House of Blues, out of town
It didn't matter, can't nothin' take that from us
And C and Boz nigga, you are loyalty
That's that word written on my arm
I just put you on my arm, how loyal you can be and will be to anybody
And to Jimmy, I barely knew you, homie
But it's all good, the time I knew was all good
And just keep watching out for that lady for me, that's all
And Mia, hold your ride, lady
I know your in pains right now for your losses
But you was my Momma, and you was always there for me
Fiend, Mac
Keep holding your ride, Mac, you gon' be home soon
And Magic, my dogg
Mystikal, you know you the best
You are the best, and your gonna always be the best at this here
And the world gon' to get to feel it like they should, in a minute
Ya heard me?
And I'm sittin' back and this it's how
Soulja Slim, everybody that I'm leaving behind
And Krazy, the new soldiers, it's all good
And to P, the Colonel, my dogg
Let me tell you something, homie
You fed me, put clothes on me, dogg
You gave me money to take care of mines, ya heard me?
You taught me a little bit bout being a man
And enough about me to know, I had to make this decision
Homie, like you said, real niggas take care of they own family
Don't depend on another man to do it
And that's what I'm doing, so respect it
I am what you taught me
You put me out here in this world, 
and I'm bout to make them feel me, ya heard me?
So it's all love
So y'all can just stop talking, ya heard me?
Ya heard me?</pre>
