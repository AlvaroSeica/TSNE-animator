[Intro: Raison the Zoo Keeper]
Ay! Brooklyn Zu
O.D.B. for life

[Chorus: LaFonda (Raison the Zoo Keeper)]
Everything gon' be alright (ay!)
Money ain't gon' be so tight
Lift up in the air tonight (ay!)
Put your peoples on for life (put your peoples on)

[Merdoc]
Aiyo, we always had appetite for crime
Not by choice or chance, due to fucked up circumstance
I guess we caught the hustlers luck, pass me a dutch
Niggas off the block, feeling good to be us
Ain't no I in us, my homey, we the people
I ain't no way tight, I can think on my feet though
Course when I pull 'em, it's the homey Magneto
Triple got the drink, but who got weed though
Dice fights a gamble, and I play c-lo
Get that gorgonzolla, yeah, that's my steezo
Am I my brothers keeper, like G-Money and Nino
Fly like the mob, fuck where I go, we go

[Chorus]

[12 O'Clock]
G's up, punk niggas down
Homey, get it, homey spread it around
I'm from the place where you go against the grain
You get kicked up your ass, and you feel the pain
So put your peoples on, if your money long
Cuz when that gone, your peoples still strong
And let that dough bounce back and forth like ping pong
Niggas Curious George and we like King Kong
I got about a dollar for a soda and Ding Dong
Fly muthafuckas, and we get our eat on
Dirt McGirt shirt, and plus them trees on
Carry big ones, we got our heat on

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
I gotta put my peoples on, ain't no time for games
Easy pass the bullshit by switching lanes
Zu is untamed, niggas, get in my way, critters
Then rip and drip from brain, family, after mark came the remains
The bounce locate, split pie five ways
Then each more eight, go safe and work that state
We daddy greats, always giving cops the shake
No breakdowns, or shakedowns, Zu guns hound
Can't let down, slug chambers round, clips is second now
You ain't down for takedown, R.I.P. floats on
Cash in the safe now, waiting for breakdown
Got a chick in the bones, going for the Zu, get low

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
