[Sample]
Alone in the street, A-Ah-Alone in the street

[Solomon Childs]
They camouflage your night life, Tryna shake the decoys
Summertime, Big rims on the Taurus
Girls with the Gator open toes
Heroin fat Miami, Rollin with the 'caine Gigolos
The dice roll hotter then Las Vegas casinos
Broads, Take'n they kids to school sayin that I hustle hard
Niggas callin me Mourning like I'm Alonzo
Nigga I'm all Madden, Channelin through the walls of your hood
Love aint love and aint nothin gonna good
And what's really hood is niggas is pussy and kill niggas over pussy
Side line steppin, Your General's a fiend
For those acquiring minds I never did the sniff coke thing
I never been a dust head, But no matter how low I get
I never stop smellin like bread, I never like smellin like bread
Cause it attract the wrong niggas, And they stupid plans
Where you find yourself in gun walls and niggas aint even really your mans
Tender on that Mooshu, SWAT raided my hood
Rest in peace to my pitbull she been Damoo
Smell the thick in the hood, Narcotic pipes burnin
Money get the world turnin, F.T.W. nigga, Fuck the world
This is a F.T.W. nigga I might fuck your girl, Yeah</pre>
