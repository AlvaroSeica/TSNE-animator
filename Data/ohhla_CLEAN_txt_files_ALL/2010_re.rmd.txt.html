2010 Wu Killa Beez, the Re-Emergence
Return of the Swarm, come on, it's the resurgence
Turn your back now, and you out, that's not an option
This is it, go with the shit, we get it popping
I was diagnosed, burnt out, comotose
Turned out, overdosed, it's the Remedy Ross
Alleged ties plus organized, wise with my eyes on the prize
I'm more than fortified, surprised, I leave 'em mortified
And that goes for anybody, I mean everybody
Don't give a fuck about nobody
This ain't no Cilvaringz, groupie, wannabe, suck-a-dick shit
You wasn't there, I am the grain you get clipped quick
Call RZA for permission, take him out of commission
"En garde" asalamalakum, shalom, that's wishful thinking
No chance, can't win, Killa Bee sting
Get on your knees, kiss the ring, it's a Shaolin thing

[King Just]
I keep a desert eagle, shoot it at point black range
Maintain in the game, as they respect my name
The Rolling Stone, heat flame, drop like acid rain
Ain't No Half Steppin', like I'm Big Daddy Kane
I'm the same and you lames try to ride my train
I will literally grap a dude like Lil' Fame
Leave his brain all over his range next to his dame
He a lollipop sucker who listen to Lil' Wayne
I got active in aim, and everything to gain
It's the runaway slave who broke free from the chains
Insane in the brain, watching Meth Bring the Pain
Flight 10304, and Fes flying the plane
You lions can be tamed, I flush 'em down the drain
They call me Denzel, cuz this is the Day you got Trained
Say hello to the bad guy, cuz he's to blame
It's the long length Chevy, bet he stay in your lane </pre>
