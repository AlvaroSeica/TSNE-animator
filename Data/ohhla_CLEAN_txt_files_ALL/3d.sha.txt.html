Y'all can't, hold me down at all
Cuz overall, I'm down to brawl like Stone Cold
It's Sahdeeq, not that I'm a b cat tho
Toe to toe, I crush hoes like vatos
You froze, when the heat rose how that sound
I melt you down, nobody feel you now
You off-course like Skipper and Gilligan
My crew deep like Mexicans, don't get us vexed again
If I catch your next of kin I'll drag him in
Ain't no wiz(?) if I can't win, let the games begin
Skip a turn, crash and burn, like Valujet
Put you on pause, like tape deck
This here, what, bang this year
Shook off your girl brassiere, rattled the chair
Set off, the alarms in the cars on the block
Beats thump a lot, like thugs on cell block
Get oxed, like you got locked for child porn
The war's on, you've been warned, word bond
Makin this bed hard, for y'all to sleep on
Wakin em up, keepin em up, past dawn

[CHORUS] (x2)
Even in 3D them fools can't see me
Keepin it raunchy while y'all cats is sweet
We could back the club, we can flood the streets
We can thug on streets, we can thug on beats

Deep concentration, cuz I'm no comedian
You can get Cube and em(?), here to bring the heat again
Open up your mouth and I'll make sure you never breathe again
If you paraplegic I'll make you get up and dance again
Hand it in, or get played like Mandolin
You can't hang with superior slang that wins
Where your party at?  Let my squad in
Beg your pardon? We gon start this
And if this shit weak, we gon take apart shit
Wrecking ball status, 10 minutes to evacuate
Move the crowd, I uplift the crowd
With they hands in the air, bring the fuckin roof down
It's the year now, Bronx hit the street now
Year 2G prepare for the shakedown
What what what...

[CHORUS] (x4)
