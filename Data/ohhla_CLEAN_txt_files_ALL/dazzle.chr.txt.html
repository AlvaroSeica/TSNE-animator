c'mon, fly with black stars
bitches in hot cars
moving in sequence
under thick white clouds
rebel with that cause
fuck with my guitars
I'm fly off the deep end
drown in these sweets, man
ooh, that's hotter
loaded and cocked up
chroming your block up
to the stage from the lock up
all hear my new pop
bottles and guns pop
one hundred on the drop
the sound at the end, it's hot

[CHORUS]
It's gangster
It's so fly
baby it's thugged out
and everybody looks so high

Roll like a rock kid
piles of blow did
a million dollar nest and
you hang at Hef's crib
looking so customize
shades over high eyes
striking up a deal
 won't shit
it's surprised man
kisses to Rolling Stone
MTV at my home
I'm all about my music
though my style is all my own
back at the hotel
they giving it, oh well
let's see how this blow smells
and wait for the dry spell

[CHORUS]

c'mon, fly with the black stars
bitches in hot cars
moving in sequence
under thick white clouds
rebel with that cause
fuck with my guitars
I'm fly off the deep end
drowning the streets, man
ooh, that's hotter
loaded and cocked up
chroming your block up
to the stage from the lock up
all hear my new pop
coochies (or Coogis?) and guns pop
one hundred on the drop
the sound at the end, it's hot

[ALTERNATE CHORUS]

it's fashion

it's high end

everbodys so fly
baby it's thugged out
and everybody looks so high</pre>
