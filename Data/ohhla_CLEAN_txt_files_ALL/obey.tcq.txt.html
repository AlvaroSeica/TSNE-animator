[Q-Tip]
This goes out to all the non-believers.. in thirst
When we had a thrist to dance, we did it ALL night
When we had a thrist to rhyme, we broke out the mics
When we had a thrist to dress, we went and got fresh
Image is nothin, but thirst... thirst is err'ything

[Phife Dawg]
...and obey your thirst
Remember to love yourself, but first things first
Grab a cold cold can and obey your thirst
Drink Sprite</pre>
