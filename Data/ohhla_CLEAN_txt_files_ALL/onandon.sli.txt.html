Song:   On and On
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know we've been so many places
That I know you've seen before
And we've gone through many changes
While we've opened up new doors
And to the windows in your mind
So that it sees reality
You know the world that we've been living
Is a world that once was free

[Chorus]
What was lost as seemed
To find another way
And if I listen
To those words you 'ave to say
We goin' on and on and on [x2]
I know it's hard for you to see
A better word for you and me
We goin' on and on and on

You know my woman
Don't mean to make you cry today
Although some others came before you
I know that you're the one to stay
You know I never meant to hurt you
I know I did so many ways
And now I'm trying just to hold on
To those words of yesterday

[Chorus]
What was lost as seemed
To find another way
And if I listen
To those words you 'ave to say
We goin' on and on and on [x2]
I know it's hard for you to see
A better word for you and me
We goin' on and on and on

(On and on) [x3]</pre>
