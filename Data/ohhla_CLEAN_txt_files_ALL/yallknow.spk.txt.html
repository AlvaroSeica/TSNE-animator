[Speak]
Okay let's try that again..
There he goes, there he goes runnin his mouth again
At the finish line talkin shit like "I got the win"
What'chu know about the wind or the way I spin?
Lights on, cameras up, zoom out, focus in
Ritalin for my bars when I spaz out
Nervous twitchin in my pocket, should I pull my cash out?
I mash out like M.O.P., no more, shows for free
I need a C.O.D., you know, cash on delivery
Little man chivalry, my magnum open symphony
is orchestrated differently
a cymbal crash for your simple ass
You see I'm never lookin past you, I'm lookin through you
A wreckin ball to your ego, shall I move you?
Rearrange your features by my hand, I Rubik's Cube you
Who's new to this music? Not I
Got skill, got bars, got pay, got fly

[Hook]
Y'all know, y'all know how I do
It's somethin bold, somethin brave
Somethin flossy, somethin new
Y'all know, y'all know how I live
Well that all depends on which girls you seein me with
Y'all know, y'all know how I do
It's somethin bold, somethin brave
Somethin flossy, somethin new
Y'all know, y'all know how I live
Well that all depends on which hoes you seein me with

[Speak]
The second verse is for you bummy hoes
You knobby-kneed, pigeon-toed, gold diggers with a runny nose
Cowboy boots and rips in your pantyhose
Never paid a bill, cause you spoiled by your daddy-o
So daddy owns stock in Apple, Mac
So you've never had to eaten stale Applejacks
Them generic off brand so them value sacks
Sacks fifth add bags, you adore all that
But you ain't never have a job, how you afford all that?
Hear the music that is playin? I record all that
Bitch don't be concerned, or ask me where my money goes
Follow all the buzz so you can find me like a honeycomb
Kin me or get jumped like checkers
The queen bees only want a taste of your nectar
At that apple bird mecca
I tell them hoes to get lost
Birds of a feather never swarm with you damn wasps

[Chorus]</pre>
