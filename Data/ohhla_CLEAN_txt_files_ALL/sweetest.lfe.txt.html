[Intro: Poppa Don]
Hmmm, hmmm, yeah, girl
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah

[Streetlife]
The way that I feel about you is strange
I can't, put it in your words, it's hard to explain
It was love at first sight, when I saw your frame
I was talkin' baby, didn't even know your name
You spoke with, calm words that massaged my brain
I'm a beast, my wild heart has now been tamed
Ever since then, I never been the same
I never felt this way, it's like the sweetest pain
I could still hear your soft voice, calling my name
When you touch me, feels warm like summer rain
Sweet love, body taste like, sugar cane
My ladybug from above, I wouldn't change a thing
Through the hard times, you helped the God maintain
You kept me sane, when I was gettin' lost in the game

[Chorus: Poppa Don]
The way that I feel about you is strange
Can't put it in words, it's so hard to explain
Have mercy on me, I know you feel the same
Real love hurts like the sweetest pain

[Streetlife]
The way that I feel about you is true
I must admit, you make a brother feel brand new
Ain't a mountain high enough to keep me away from you
And great smile, you can turn the gray skies blue
It's the little things you do that got me loving you
Like when you stay home and call in sick with the flu
And, when we alone, you know just what to do
And, you ain't scared to try a new trick or two
Teacher teacher, everybody plays a fool
Sometimes, there's no exceptions to the rules
Look how we grew, came a long way since high school
We got a long way to go, but I'll be there for you
Money ain't a thing, for real, if the love ain't true
Baby girl, where I would be, would I be, would I be

[Interlude: Poppa Don]
Where would I be without you, ooh yeah, ooh yea
Where, I'd be, without you, girl, huh
I see your love, your love, your love
Your love is like the sweetest pain
Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Your love is like the sweetest pain, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Streetlife]
As we lay, I never thought I'd feel this way
Gentle strokes on my arm, palms soft as clay
Sexy, lavender, two piece langerie
Black essense, the scent of peach body spray
Backgrounds, sounds of the late Marvin Gaye
I need that "Sexual Healing" throw that love in my way
Lookin' out the window, at the ships, dock at the bay
Karate kicks and punches, lovin' the games we play
Silent whispers, I'm hearing every word you say
Hugs and kisses, sweet as pictures, every day, all day
Tell you scripts, eggs and grits, a tall glass of o.j.
A side of toast, fruit roll at the top of the tray
I'm loving every minute, even when the skies were grey
You would rub me on my back and say, and say

[Outro: Poppa Don]
Oh, baby, it'll be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Oh yeah, yeah, I'll take care of you
Baby I'm there for you, I wanna be near you
Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Rock on, yea</pre>
