[Immortal Technique]
A new American revolution has begun
Not against the forces of a colonial kingdom
but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us
It is not a foreign invasion we have to fear
rather the threat of a force within our nation
that has usurped what was once a dream of having
the greatest democracy ever known to man
We now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially
and the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all
We in the inner city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos
may not realize it yet, but make no mistake~!
The people who control the technology
and run every enterprise that makes up our world
have seen this coming for a long time
The ideas of renewable energy, global warming
the idea of collectively working
were purposefully bought out, derailed, demonized, or corrupted
in favor of an economic structure, designed by a monetary caste system
In a desperate attempt to convince us
that we need to maintain that extravagant existence
they've pretended we might share in their dream
that we can justify any inhumanity in its name
Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery
Many of the founders of this nation were themselves Masons
That is not a left-wing or a right-wing conspiracy theory
it is a widely known and accepted fact
So then explain to me how a nation founded by men
who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe
but also that of Africa, could permeate such a lie
in convincing the American public
that one race of men was superior, and one inferior
when in fact we know that all the early men
the people who created civilization
every aspect of what we see today
the foundation of all modern human life, were from Africa
The greatest cowardice of course came
not with, slavery itself unfortunately
but with the excuses for slavery
For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire
and all other empires that have come after her
and claimed "No we were just stronger, and that's why we took you"
then when slavery was over, racism would have probably followed in suit
But instead it was the social lie, the religious lie
that was told, that stayed in the minds of people
that separated one human being from another
in order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom
they created issues around religion and race
to dominate the world for centuries to come
Some claim, that they respect the culture of life in this country
They cry out for the indignity of children
that are slaughtered before they are born
But God has not penetrated their souls
For they have no empathy; nothing in their cold hearts
for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken
in our wars overseas for that which they call "collateral damage"
which are the burnt and damaged children of world
They have no prayers for them
Only snide commentary on the internet, and laughter in their hearts
And yet you claim to be one with God? Heh
We talk about immigration in this country
Might doesn't make right ladies and gentlemen
it just makes right now
What we are saying to the rest of the world
is one day when America grows weak
One day when her legions falter
on a day when her economy crumbles
China, Russia, Europe, whatever power has arisen
All you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions
and then you too can set up shop here, and in 100 years
you can tell every red-blooded American
"No! You are an illegal human being!
 I am the true citizen! I have all the rights! You have no rights!"
Maybe you forgot how you got this country
Maybe you take for granted the blood, the sweat, the tears
that the people who live in practical serfdom, shed everyday
for we may not run America, but we make America run
We talk about the law; yet
how many indignities have been legal in the past?
How many treaties with Native American people have we broken?
How many international laws have we violated?
And, speaking of laws
how can a corporation be regulated by a government
that is funded and controlled by corporations?
How can there be accountability
for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans?
Above the lives of human beings in other countries?
We have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines
My words, of course, will be marginalized, demonised in typical fashion
Any time you dare to question the power structure they say "You hate America"
No~! I love this country
I see its beauty everyday in its people
and I love it a lot more than those that have abandoned the American worker
that have chose to exploit and try and take away every single benefit that she has
Those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed
in the name of supposed freedom
Those who demand accountability from everyone
but often none themselves
Who favor contracts over lives
Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas
The greatest flaw, that any intelligent person has
is to think that they're smarter than everyone else
And so, as the government has planted its spies amongst us
we have planted our spies among them
They have infiltrated every branch of the American government
They have retrieved names, data, hard numbers, the paper trail
that will expose those that truly control this country
Those that, control the political parties
those that control the oil industry, the energy
Those that stand behind the companies - faceless
whose names have never been revealed
until tod.. {*gunshot, people screaming in panic*}
{*a young man yells "DAD!!" repeatedly*}
{*a heart slowly stops beating*}</pre>
