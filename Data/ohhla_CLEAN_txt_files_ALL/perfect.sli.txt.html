Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Just 'cause she dances go-go
Don't make her a ho no no
Maxine put your red shows on
We goin' to the disco
We gonna elope on down to mexico
Called up my momma said i'm in love with a stripper yo

Ten grand
Lemme see you shake it like you got no bones in your body
And you were made to be a celebrity
Twenty grand
Know it's a sin
Revealin' skin
But i gotta do that shit just to fufill the fantasy
Thirty grand
To the highest bidder
But chris rock said
There's no sex in the champagne room
Forty grand
See the type of tears comin' down
Type of tears that i saw the type that money couldn't buy

Just 'cause she dances go-go
Don't make her a ho no no
Maxine put your red shows on
We goin' to the disco
We gonna elope on down to mexico
Called up my momma said i'm in love with a stripper yo</pre>
