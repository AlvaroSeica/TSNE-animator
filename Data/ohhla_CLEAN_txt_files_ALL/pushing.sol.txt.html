[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, See that's what's wrong with these stupid motherfuckers
Huh, You know they aint give you the good vest nigga
Shit, We got shit that can go through your fest
You know the boss kept the good fest, Haha
You thinking that that's some bullshit
You thinking that's just because the shit done hit you
That that's the impact from the bullets hittin the vest
But nah that aint that, That shit done went through
Nigga ya bleedin, Somebody come pick this nigga up man
Call the paramedics to come pick this nigga up man
Uh, Uh, Yeah

[Solomon Childs]
I've realized for the money, I'll pull rips out intestins
Who the fuck's playin, What the fuck's so funny
Warrants, We got warrants for you niggas and we come'n
To apprehend you nigga, Gone show up with sopeanas in your hood
The Guerrilla, Sasquatch hoods
Or have you esophagus bleed, With boat rope
Around your neck in military knots, 'Til we see the goods
Hip Hop's Frank Lucas, It's a cold world partner
Surrounded by a bunch of hate'n motherfuckers
That's gonna burn in a bed of karma, In cemetery fog
Time em to a stake, Have em burn like a road hog
They say the ghetto has got a thing for murder
As well as extortion so 'til I die I'm authentic like my Daddy's burner
Give me a reason

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs, (Coco)]
I'ma get my crook on, 'Til a nigga see that money
Them boys is hungry. (Pushing, Pushing, Straight up extortion)

[Solomon Childs]
That's right, I gotta big mouth
You feel violated, Then let the toasters blow
Assassin verbal, Versatile cosmo
Blood on my teeth like Coojo
Shoot a bitch nigga in the coolo
Them water head niggas is food in the mountains
Perpetrate'n the fraud on these streets, No clappin
Just a whole lotta shoutin, Spit swagger
So it can flow through the air like a Frisbee
I'm here for good so aint no need to miss me
I'm into Southern belles and they love to kiss me
Blomberg gone fuck around and give me keys to the city
Next door to Fifty in the Waldorf tipsy
I put the scope in the infey, In a hood near you
Scare who, I'ma do it like H.N.I.C. supposed to do

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Hey Momma they shootin, Cover the babies
Cover the babies Momma they shootin...</pre>
