[Chorus]
Been through so much pain
But I know I'ma make it
It's my time to play and if
I ain't more than average
I won't be like the ordinary
Oh I won't let my story kill me

[Verse 1]
As I run on the cruddy streets findin' piece in my glasshouse
Poppa came home too drunk so my momma put his ass out
She tried to take it but it went deep
She tried her best with every breath to make it, It's me
I really tried to escape prison, oh what a feelin'
And catchin' a hardon for drug dealin'
Usin' the talent that I was blessed with
To get my momma out the rat infested buildin's and try to maka a million
And in a position of decision makin'
And closed caskets for niggas who dreamed on and never waken
Initiated as an outcast
I smoked blunts with niggas who found peace when the shots blast
Maybe I'm lunatic it, a losin' my minds slow
Rollin' with hooligans they tell me who they die for
I gotta find a better way out the street life
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga, got a brother three strikes

[Chorus]
Been through so much pain
But I know I'ma make it
It's my time to play and if
I ain't more than average
I won't be like the ordinary
Oh I won't let my story kill me

[Verse 2]
More money more problems is what we all say
Had to put the strap down no gunplay
I'm still double parked on the runway
They got me feelin' like a boss on a sunday
Money the motivator, movin' like elevators
And knowin' that these cowards will never see me later
I seen my life in the bright lights
I'm still gettin' wavy in my white nikes
They losin' focus but I'm here now
No need to panic my niggas I'm goin' to be around
And tear it down in the worts way
I just spent another mill on my birthday
So I live in a fairy tale
Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I didn't sell
Would all the pain remain?
Or will I be that perfect spark that will change the game

[Chorus](x2)
Been through so much pain
But I know I'ma make it
It's my time to play and if
I ain't more than average
I won't be like the ordinary
Oh I won't let my story kill me

[Outro]
Won't i, kill me
That's right, came up with another classic
I'm not your average guy, just to believe
Juvi Juv, Courtney B
TJ, goin' all tha way baby
You already who doin this one
