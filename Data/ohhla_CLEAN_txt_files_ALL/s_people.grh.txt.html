[spoken]
people grow up
people go in different directions
some people just have different dreams n different desires
so you gotta just scratch ya own itch

[grouch]
some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (yeah)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves, man

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (y'know?)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves

you gotta
move on, move on, move on, move on
move on, move on, move on, move on
man
move on, move on, move on, move
well then
move on, move on, move on

i used to have love and now I can't stand this fool
this couldn't have happened even if I planned it to
friends for life on a spectrum so wide
nobody works perfect
believe me, I tried
but when two worlds collide
you gotta give somethin'
take a step back and learn to live humble
you know pride, it'll eat you up inside
and all that self-pity will turn your whole world shitty
i'm a no-girl's kitty [?] tryin' to hang on, dearly
live days sincerely and see both sides clearly
there's no room to build enemyships
especially out of old friends
when'll we quit?
went from penalty kicks to it don't mean shit
ridiculousness, actin' like bitches that diss (hey)
(bing) turn the page
(pow) quit actin' like a child
are you wild up and ready to be petty?
that's a heartbreaker
well i'll be the chargetaker and make sure it don't happen in the future
extend my hand while you cryin' like a rooster
damn, dig up the root and be a man
(yeah, show 'em how to be a man)

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (yeah)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves, man

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (y'know?)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves

you gotta
move on, move on, move on, move on
move on, move on, move on, move on
man
move on, move on, move on, move
well then
move on, move on, move on

with every stroke of the clock is more pressure
who could fully understand the growth of a child more or less
this innocence exposed
free form, no mode
to experience livin' in possibilities I hold
visions in my head I wanna spread
to these children before they get sidetracked
what sport are you reeled in?
and I'm not talkin' about shieldin'
what's in the glass are comin' half ass
me, I don't really want the last laugh (nope)
just to be laughin' at all my last days
because somebody else is passin' up the mark that I made
turnin' dark to light
or bark the bite
blindfolded, flyin', and all without a fight
i'm all about in the knight, tryin' to kick down the deamons
with all my big sounds screamin' like he-men (arrr)
fuck the power of grace
go 'til my skull is grey - every day, all day
i'mma never fall prey

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (yeah)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves, man

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (y'know?)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves

you gotta
move on, move on, move on, move on
move on, move on, move on, move on
man
move on, move on, move on, move
well then
move on, move on, move on

your body is a tool, mind is too
shape them well, feel them them the finest food
if knowledge is power then most of us are bustlers
it's easy to beat that, you gotta tussle with the bad
bring yourself back to the essence
make your presence felt when you're there and you're stressin' your points
put oil on your joints
kill the t.v
deal with people face-to-face if you don't believe me
join the race, flow some oxygen through the brain
remember that you learned and apply it so you gain
drop game on a lane
and later he'll be walkin'
chalk it up is just choppin' it closin' options
never frozen, 'cause we are the chosen
'bout to set an emotion  and keep coastin'
keep coastin'
keep coastin'
keep coastin'

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (yeah)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves, man

some people get better with time
and some people have a hard time (y'know?)
some people, they age like wine
and other people, they can't find themselves

you gotta
move on, move on, move on, move on
move on, move on, move on, move on
man
move on, move on, move on, move
well then
MOVE ON, MOVE ON, MOVE ON</pre>
