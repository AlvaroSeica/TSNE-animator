Wassup boo? Yeah
Hahahaha Yeah

[2Pac]
Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin, take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied, and today we stole them kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding it definitely, if they plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein here ain't livin
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you playa cardz right

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on who
Who be the one who be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will, be there till the morning
We won't leave until the night and we will
Be forever more

[Keyshia Cole]
No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside
And it's gonna be alright and it'll be ok
If we try and take our time, yes baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whoooo

[Chorus]

[Pac talking]   (Keyshia ad-libs)
You got to playa cardz right on one (Ooooh yeah)
Can't be rushing like it's a race 'nahmsayin?  (No, no, no)
If you be patient, and you take your time (Be patient baby)
And you finess it, 9 times out of 10 times (10)
Homeboy you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush (Heyy) and you just be manhandlin, haha, (It takes a real man)
Yo ass is goin home tonight Haha (Heyy)
Playa cardz right nigga,  take ya time. (Be the one) Be patient
(Be the one heeeyy) Go slow, it's better that way
You ain't heard? (Yeah) Haha
Playa cardz right
(Be the one, I wanna be the one)

[Chorus]

[Pac talking]    (Keyshia ad-libs)
Take ya time man (Take ya time)
Don't be in such a rush (In a rush) Haha (Be forever more)
You got to be patient man, be patient
It ain't goin nowhere one haha (Nowhere)
Get some champagne (Haha, be forever more)
Bring some roses or somethin, you know
Play some soft shit
Light a fire (Luther Vandross)
You got to be cool with it  (Teddy, Teddy)
You got to be slow with it  (Ooooh be so)
You got to be patient, you got to playa cardz right on one
Can't be rushing like it's a race 'nahmsayin
If you be patient, and you take you time and you finesse it...</pre>
