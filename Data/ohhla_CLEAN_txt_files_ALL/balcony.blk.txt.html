I See YOU, trynna Cling to whatever's poppin' 
I See YOU, switchin' Teams for the better option 
I See YOU, well WE don't need YOU with The Opera 
Three Ring Circus, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman 
YOU got too many Jerseys in ya locker 
I think the kids call it Thirsty here's some agua 
WE the Top Shottas with the Patois 
Verbals Stay on Murder Game. YOUR jargon is Hogwash 
Shades on like The Unibomber 
King Shit bitch, Tutankhamen 
Yea WE The Opera but WE move in silence 
UFOs havin' human sightings yea WE Out Here 

CHORUS:
Yea, I know YOU niggas got it out for me 
Trynna do me like King on the Balcony 
Nah, but YOU will never Malcolm me 
âCause everytime I look down.. 
What Do I See?
Yellow Back (Yellow Back)
Yellow Back Niggas 
Why they still Alive? I don't know. Go figure 
Bunch of Yellow Back (Yellow Back) 
Yellow Back Niggas 
Why they still Alive? I don't know. Go figure 

They watchin' (They watchn') 
They watchin' what WE doin' 
They plottin' taking notes âcause they know WE got it movin' 
They watchin' (They watchn') 
They watchin' what WE doin' 
They plottin' taking notes âcause they know Business is Boomin' 

Black Stevie Wonder's on. Ray Charles 
Either black or brown or red Malcolm style 
My (K)night Rider like to make her Kitt talk 
True Bloods used to make a nigga Crip Walk 
Now them Vampires lookin' like some Ken dolls 
And, YOU thug rappers lookin' like Reveng Of.. 
The Nerds on the curb with a skateboard 
Thats COOL, but don;t be actin' like YOU Rick Ross 
Rick Ross ain't even Rick Ross 
Rick Ross ain't even Rick Ross 
YOU ain't a boss if ya Boss got a Big BOSS 
YOU Black Pawns on the board for the KING's WAR 

CHORUS:
Yea, I know YOU niggas got it out for me 
Trynna do me like Lincoln on the Balcony 
Nah, but YOU will never Malcolm me 
âCause everytime I look down.. 
What Do I See?
Yellow Back (Yellow Back)
Yellow Back Niggas 
Why they still Alive? I don't know. Go figure 
Bunch of Yellow Back (Yellow Back) 
Yellow Back Niggas 
Why they still Alive? I don't know. Go figure 

They watchin' (They watchn') 
They watchin' what WE doin' 
They plottin' taking notes âcause they know WE got it movin' 
They watchin' (They watchn') 
They watchin' what WE doin' 
They plottin' taking notes âcause they know Business is Boomin' 

Black Hoody on no matter what the forecast 
Black Scully off the dome with a Scarf Mask 
YOU never seen a Killa this Clean.. 
Low Key, so discreet, so to brag there's really no need 
Cool story bro. OK. YOU do this just to be seen 
Get a couple Hoes. Keep the shoes on ya feet Clean 
(WOAH NOW)
WE was the same way when WE was preteen 
(SLOW DOWN)
YOU speeding on E like Eazy 
Depression got US sniffin' BLOW 
Black and White. Different Strokes 
Rappers coked up in the Studio like 54 
Legends that YOU never knew Dead from shit YOU quick to do 
Fuck the status quo. WE Black em out. The only trend is YOU 

CHORUS:
Yea, I know YOU niggas got it out for me 
Trynna do me like ______ on the Balcony 
Nah, but YOU will never Malcolm me 
âCause everytime I look down.. 
What Do I See?
Yellow Back (Yellow Back)
Yellow Back Niggas 
Why they still Alive? I don't know. Go figure 
Bunch of Yellow Back (Yellow Back) 
Yellow Back Niggas 
Why they still Alive? I don't know. Go figure 

They watchin' (They watchn') 
They watchin' what WE doin' 
They plottin' taking notes âcause they know WE got it movin' 
They watchin' (They watchn') 
They watchin' what WE doin' 
They plottin' taking notes âcause they know Business is Boomin'</pre>
