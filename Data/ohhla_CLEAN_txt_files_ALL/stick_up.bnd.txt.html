F: I'll handle everything
F: You ready?
N: Mothafuckin ready
F: Aight fool, you got me, real niggaz do what they got to do
N: Yea!

[Verse 1 - Freddrick + Ness]
F: Y'all muhfuckas freeze! Take a seat on the floor
I'm approachin' the bank teller the bitch lockin' the drawer
Give me the codes to the safe and put yo hands to the sky
She shakin' because she know somebody 'bout to die
N: Now keep yo goddamn hands off the panic button
Put the cash in the bag 'fore I damage somethin'
If the bitch try to act confused, get slapped, matter fact
Play it back on the action news
F: Oooh, I'ma act a fool, act irrational, the guard reached
For a gun I had to blast the dude
N: Fuck it if you blast then I'm blastin too
Blow his ass to smithereens
F: The glock'll tear his ass in two
N: Heh, real niggaz gon' do what they have to do
F: We got it all mapped out we just passin through
N: Heh, here come the boys in blue,
And we came to wipe the bank clean, not enjoy the view

Chorus - Freddrick + Ness

(2x) Nobody move, nobody get hurt
One false move put that ass in the dirt (Ooh)
Don't make me act a fool
Real niggaz gon do what they have to do '

Ooh dont make us act a fool
Real niggaz gon do what they have to do

*Police Officer talking*

You in there, this is the police, please come out with your hands up, and
Your weapons down, the building is surrounded there is +no way out+ please
Make this easy on yourself and let the people go!! (Gun shots)

[Verse 2 Ness + Freddrick]
N: Gather all the workers put 'em in a circle (Not me I got kids!!)
Hah shut up for I murk you!
F: Don't make me hurt you! You motherfuckers just form a line
Be patient, in time I'ma search you
N: Damn and the whole block flooded with pigs, ya dig
Reload the clips, you know what it is
F: I've only shot 4 out the clip it's 12 more in this bitch
And stay low if I'm shootin cause I'm aimin to hit! (Gun shots)
N: Fall out in broad day light, fuck police
Make that scene from "Heat" look like Sesame Street
Listen to me
F: Nah dawg listen to me, if bad get worse I'm goin on a killin' spree, listen
N: Man you wild dawg, listen to me, I got a trick up my sleeve
Make my mission complete, check it, take the steps to the top of the ceiling
Got a chopper waitin for us on the the of the building
F: My man, thats a plan let me grab the million
N: Let's hover above the city over top of civilians
F: Come on
