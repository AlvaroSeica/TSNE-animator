[Skyzoo - Talking]
Illmind said I should just walk it through, like, 
no sixteens, no twenty-fours, just, keep it goin'
So I'm keep it goin' like, huh, yeah

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
Pennin' words, bendin' words
Slinky with the vocab
Feelin' like I found Langston's pen and know that
ink has never been this important
you can quote that
Ink has never been this important
you can quote that

[Skyzoo]
Rose out the hole from a bud where the petals grew
True as one section to live up to it's pedestal
I measured through, nothing I could say that I ain't ever do
I kick it, I did it, every syllable I sketch is true
And I ain't have to stretch the truth
try and get a letter through
Told I'm paintin' pictures to show 'em just what a letter do
Literally speakin', I'm throwin' 'em another step or two
Literaturely speakin', I've spoken enough to set a new precedent
Call it a proceeding, go to better pens
Came up throwin' tags so I'm buffin' out your relevance
Jumpin' over negligence
Nothin' they can peddle in
Can be a better platter then the service that you settled in
Product of a corner where it's cheaper if you step on it
But went to A.P. English, I'm tunin' my intelligence
Crossovers hope to cross over into better things
'Till your handle gets you handled and they lettin' metal sing
Cause all I know is phone calls
(Please hold) What's kickin', Scott?
"Gone In 60 Seconds," hear the phone beep, minute chime
Holla if you need, I'm on the road but I can get to mine
hold your head in there, when you're home we can get your shine
Cause everyone around me kept the lights on, picture dimes
Loc took bitches to D.C., he was pitchin' dimes
I bodied my A.P. English but I was gettin' mine
Name was all over them scans but no finger lines
This is my reality, all of what resembles I
Bloggers gettin' cute and all, fuck if you don't get a line
All of 'em that do, I salute to you a million times
It ain't the easiest to understand but if you sit and try
this is like soul food
Took what they ain't wish to fry
turned it to a delicacy baby, all in minutes time
Now they Rachael Rayin' me and bringin' me the different size
Never been to Whole Foods, Met Foods did me fine
On it like we towering
Acknowledge my acknowledgement
First one to come off St. James since the Wallaces
And I was just rappin' what I know, every line of it
Was person, place or thing, turn nouns to astonishment
Shout to Fult on Street
Said and done, I hope you proud of it
Shout to London Boule, phone rings, I know you ridin' with
Shout to Fulton Street
Said and done, I hope you proud of it
Shout to London Boule, phone rings, I know you ridin' with

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
Pennin' words, bendin' words
Slinky with the vocab
Feelin' like I found Langston's pen and know that
Ink has never been this important
you can quote that
Ink has never been this important
you can quote that
Pennin' words, bendin' words
Slinky with the vocab
Feelin' like I found Langston's pen and know that
Ink has never been this important
you can quote that
Ink has never been this important
you can quote that

[Skyzoo]
Born alone, die alone
No crew to keep my crown of thorns
So, I don't take it off or step off from it till the sound is gone
(*Song starts to fade away*) Show 'em how to listen if they get it then they 'bout the raw
And if they couldn't get it, I attempted, I ain't down at all
Put a voice to everything that mattered when the door closed
Bobby, pin the lock if they thought they couldn't...</pre>
