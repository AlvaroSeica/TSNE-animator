[Intro]
Yeah, it's like the ultimate party favor baby ya know?
2 cups will get her hot and out of her clothes ya know?
Caribou Lou it's like

[Chorus]
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get dem all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop till the cops come

[Verse 1]
Half a bottle of 151 off in a jug
1 cup of Malibu rum baby that's whassup then you
fill the rest of the jug with pineapple juice and it's crackin'
the only defect is waking up like what happened
I like, red light parties and fed right bodies who like
bread like dolly and head right totties at night
Aribou Cay oulay
Terrible day you pay the liquor store teller
with no hair or tupe tushe
Get the party jumpin', keep the hotties humpin'
I like em thick and juicy so don't palatti nothin'
drinkin' too much Lou you
might be karate puchin' or at the back of the club
attending the naughty luncheon
Satin, coolaid gives you hella 151 November dog so run kitty run
we gon drink it until we dumb ditty dumb bum bitty bum
here Kansas City come so give me some

[Chorus]
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get dem all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
We gon party till the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get dem all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop till the cops come

[Verse 2]
I see double, I see triple, might be trouble might see pistols
we ain't tryin' ta hear you hataz suckin' on sickles
we livin' it up in two double o sizzle
Wonder you may bro, until ya day go
why I'm the one ta drink you under the table
and all the ladies I will do in time
once you become a member of my drinkin' club you will find Tech N9ne
Tryin' to tell her truly get nudey yes
I even do L-words in their fruity bizutti
like to drink it and yell slurs at the movies
if I'm heated I'm off to get Caribou Lou to cool me
Created by Tech N9zzle and T. Wizzle one high day
we mixed it up and then I say we treat caribizzle like our lady
originated in Kansas City, Missouri since 1995 baby

[Chorus] - 3X

[Verse 3]
Tar bender I need a drother nink
release Caribou Lou in a party it's utter kink
insane mani, keep em comin' then I'll remain zany
cause sadatay baby I'm tryin' ta make you my main damey
For the rest of the night girl ya sexy, ya tight
come to we casa and see the chakra flexin' you right.
Groupies at 12 o'clock man I'll crawl, I'll go
yeah I'll recruit em but I bet not crap that's all I know
Yep in my white t and Nike's you might sight me
slightly hyph and might see dry heaves
die we shall not need I.V.'s beside me siemeze
(Tech) huh (you're not makin' any sense!)
I might make her wanna swing her prada
but once I get up on the mic and do my thing I got her.
(Tech) Hey batter, batter, batter, batter swing batter
he can hit he can it he can hit swing batter

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
