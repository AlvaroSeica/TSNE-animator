Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: King Just]
Punch in your time cards, yeah
It's the God, KJ, what? All day
Many hours of work, baby, put it in, baby, they see us coming

[Hook: sample]
When they see you coming
Niggas take off running, from you, is true, oh yes, make dues

[Chorus 2X: King Just]
Us them niggas, who put in work
Cross that line and you bound to get hurt
Lay in the mud and you gonna eat dirt
Cuz we the type of niggas who don't do church

[King Just]
You looking back now with goal and fourth down
You Ringling Brothers is all looking like clowns
Turn around and you won't make it past six
All in the Kool-Aid and you don't know the mix
Hits, man, we got 'em, all we do is drop 'em
Park Hill to KJ, is Batman to Gotham
Cop it, as soon as the LP hit the stores
Spot 'em in your neighborhood or on tour
How about some hardcore, love it, man, dub it
Cuz if push come to shove, we gon' get the shovel and shove it
Dig it, pick it, biggest rap critic
Not Will Smith, but I 'get jiggy wit it'
Shitted, without the Exlax in me
And I still go uptown with cab drivers named Femmy
Henny or Remy, nigga, you choose the drink
And I don't puff scamma, but I steal everything

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
Rap with a bad deal, but I put in four in the pill
Cuz niggas that I fuck with, man, is still real
Still here, try'nna stack them bills, to pay them bills
To move out the Hill, for real
Choose to be chill, or Bill get gold and sealed
And them studios get snatched for them reel to reels
Up in this Jack, cousin, who gives a fuck how you feel
If this was the last supper, I want the full course meal
In the prison with high heels, with more Gates than Bill
I'm like Kid from House Party, asking if you wanna peel
Little dance is like "ill", you looking in the mirror
Cuz ain't nothing scarier than a fucking Yogi Berra
What the hell is that? A fat naked bitch with
Hair on her back, try'nna get her groove back
Holla back, when you see the kid going plat'
A product of my own kind, straight from the Stat'

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
Who go first, and I ain't even got to curse
But fuck it, none of this shit's here's the hurse
Burst on the scene like the uptown bounce
I don't steam, but I dream about burning an ounce
Pound for you, like Ali did to Frazier
Sold a mil independent, just imagine with a major
I gave ya, that harmonized rap, niggas ran with it
But now I want it back, ease back
On attack, combat, showed ya how to format
Niggas wanna steal my raps, I got LoJack
So it's coming back and the thief is getting caught
Got Johnny Cochran you better settle out of court

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 3X]

[Outro: King Just]
Put in work, baby, it's not a game
It's not a game... </pre>
