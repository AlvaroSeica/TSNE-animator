Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I can't trust these niggas, I can't trust these hoes, Oh no
I can tell I got these haters pissed, I know, I know
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
Oh no

I hear what they're talkin', I know what they're sayin'
But nigga I ain't worried about shit, shit
Ridin' 5 deep in that tahoe my nigga, we pushin' that dance for a cheque
Bitches keep talkin', they're runnin' they mouth
But we know that you ain't about action
Call up [?] while the prices is low
Cause soon my nigga we taxin'
She let me beat it, mike jackson
Nigga we eatin', you snackin'
...
All 'bout paper, we flexin
In the cut with your bitch, relaxin'
Mama Said Chase That Dough (Doe)
And Never Stress Bout No Ho (No)

I can't trust these niggas, I can't trust these hoes, Oh no
I can tell I got these haters pissed, I know, I know
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
Oh no

Niggas be talkin' 'bout all of their money
But all of their money, my nigga we got it
Don't need no wallet, I'm fly as a pilot
My niggas we outchea, My niggas we whylin'
More style than the stylist, I'm jumpin ya modest
I'm getting the paper and I dropped out of college
Boy I'm so bout it, they asked who the hottest
I looked in the mirror and almost forgot it
Sike, no I didn't, boy I'm so cold
I might need some mittens
Beam me up Scotty, I'm looking for pippen
You are not getting no money, you trippin'
KOD monday, this nigga is tippin'
Niggas so pussy, they acting' like kittens
Dunk on that bitch boy, I feel like blake griffin
Say what you say
But my nigga, we did it

I can't trust these niggas, I can't trust these hoes, Oh no
I can tell I got these haters pissed, I know, I know
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
I don't give a damn about none of these niggas
I don't give a damn about none of these bitches
Oh no</pre>
