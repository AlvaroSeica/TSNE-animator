Song:   Enough
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It was not enough that we were bought and brought to this home as the slave
locked in the bowels of a floating shithouse
watching those we love eaten away by plauge and insanity
flesh falling like strips of bark from a termite-infested tree
bones rotting turning first to brittle ivory then to resin
that was not enough
it was not enough that we were chained to leg irons
black on black with a piss stained wall forced to heed nature's call
through and inside of tattered rags that strained our privates
and evidently years of slavery did not appease your need to be superior
to something like a crazed lion hung up on being the king of his corner of the cage
backs bent under the wieght of being everything and having nothing
minds too like bomerrangs curving back into themselves
kicked and carved by the face-straining smiles that saved my life
that was not enough
somehow I can not believe that it would be enough for me to melt with you
and integrate without the thoughts of rape and murder
I cannot conceive of peace on earth until I have given you a piece of lead
or pipe to end your worthless motherfucking exitence
imagine your nightmares of my sneaking into a
weuked of satin bedroom and attacking your daughter
wife and mother at once ripping open their bowels sexually like a wishbone
imagine that magnified a million times when you realize that the blinders
have been stripped from my eyes and I realize that slavery was no smiling happy-fizzy party
your ancestors raped my foremothers and I will not forget
I will not forget that Yale or Harvard or Princeton or In-Hell because you are on my mind
I see you everytime my woman walks down the street with her ass on her shoulders
I see you everytime I look in the mirror and think about the times
that I would pat myself on the back for not being too black afterall
I think of you morning, noon and night and I wonder
"just exactly what in hell is enough?" everytime I see a rope or gun I remember
and to top it all of you ain't through yet. over fifty you have killed in mississippi since 1963
that doesn't even begin to begin all of those you have maimed
hit and run over
blinded
poisoned
starved
or castrated. I hope you do not think that a vote for John Kennedy
took you off my shit-list because in the street there will only be black and white
there will be no Democrats
Republicans
Liberals
Conservatives
Moderates
or any other of the rest of that shit you have used to make me forget to hate
there ain't no enough. there ain't no surrender
there is only plot and plan
move and groove, kill. there is no promise land
there is only the promise
the promise is not vowel until we have been nerve gassed
shot down and murdered
or done some of the same ourselves
look over your shoulder motherfucker
I am coming</pre>
