[Intro: Random]
Uhh... yeah
We gotta show you how to work this
It's the boy Mega Ran and Wordspit
Uhh, was it worth it?
About to merk it
Uhh, uhh, yeah, let's go~!

[Random]
Since I was half of the man that I am
I've dreamed of stackin the Grammys
Flash at 'em at bad rappers that never mastered the plan
In back of the van, my product wrapped in cellophane
Rap's letterman, breeze through your weather vanes
Like I was supposed to rot in a cell
Bitch I could prevail before Oprah was rockin Michelle
Then my college advisor said life ain't gotta try to surprise ya
No time to let astrology guide ya
So I'm in overdrive, underrated but overjoyed
Understatement of the year, I +Tell 'Em+, no +Soulja Boy+
Stay crisp like super new kicks
My mix on point like a Super Scope, 6
Used to move with the crooks 'til they gave me the stupidest looks
No imagenet music to gush
I guess a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Brothers don't read, so I put my jewels in the books
I'm hard, Linux or Belly
"Put It In Your Mouth" at the barbecue, shout out to Akinyele
And what? People in the place stand up
Hands up, make ya move like you under a handtruck
My peoples is diesel, my steez should be illegal
I come out +Scott+ free just like the Alien sequels
Get it? No Ridley, so sickly
Aphilliates worth 50 bucks, Bo Diddley
Put a penny in the pot if you're feelin this
Open source lyricist, I'm ultra cloistron
A buddha to pipe don, a icon, blowin like a pipe bomb
And your grind ain't nothin like mine
"Focused Daily," word to Defari
Can't believe they chose me, of all guys
(They always had a smart comment when I walked by)
Now they smile when I stunt like +The Fall Guy+
A beat and a verse for a salary
Reverse the polarity and curse the mentality
Huh, spit a verse to make the earth crack
Remember the feeling, you'll NEVER get the first back!

[Chorus: Random]
The last piece of the puzzle, knee deep in the struggle
We keep 'em befuddled - hit 'em 'til the speaker blow!
Bring it forward and back, stay scorchin the track
with that audible crack - they beggin for an easy mode!

[Wordspit]
Yeah I'm on that, cybernetic flow beyond rap
I Roll with the Rush plus each bar is stripped
and equipped with the Mega Man cannon my arm blast
My sickness, viral, steady for combat
Just spare me the arm tracks, my mic check
brutal slash SkyNet, mixed with +The DaVinci Code+ virus
Guess y'all can't hack it, whenever I write it
Broken web servers recite it over default
Each verse tend to karaokes like keyboards
Return from the beach, I'm just tryin to make you see-show/sea-sho'
with eons, beyond you peons
Saw right wit'cha buzz, I am E. Johns
Yeah, so we +Ghostbusters+ like Egon
With Slimer in the trap you can see me best
Now I'm white noise, +Poltergeist+, TV sets
Caroling to limericks, ouija text
As I step in a fresh pair of Nike Steps
Tours spitting teams, Levis be the jeans
It's obsecne it seems okie not on deck
So keep I/eye on deck, optometrist level grand
Couple MPC shots for Mega Ran
And me, I'm killin every track
It's illest MC squared, Mr. Choice, big man be 'Spit

[Chorus]
