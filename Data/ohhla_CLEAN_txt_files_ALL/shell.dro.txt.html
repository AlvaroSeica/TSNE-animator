[Verse 1: T.I.]
hey pimp squad pimp hard we gettin ours of top

pisol whip em then bust em in the leg wit the glock
leave em fuckin shell shocked

4 tryin 2 hustle a broad but nigga ours dont stop
wheather we hustle broads or gettin our of blocks
used 2 see us on the block
hangin in the spot chillin fire hot
but we out till diss yeall start sellin
time 2 re-up and I'm waitin on dude but not devin
kno the feds wonder who no clue I'm not tellin
we vintage hustlers
throwback gangstas from "87"
extremly rare I swear I'm like number 9 out of 11
now you see us flashin toolz on "22" hot wheelin
back 2 back 2 back in black and blue and white 7's
came along way from the trap wit dem hard white 7's
its a blessin that you peasants was graced wit our presents

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: young dro]

approxamatly 120 slugs come plenty
wont stop until my whole clip empty cause im

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: macboney]

pistol stay cocked cause niggaz thrivin up on my block

[Chorus]
