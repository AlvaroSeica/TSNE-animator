Song:   The Greatness
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Mibbs]
The underdogs 'bout to go for the win
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin
Man I will prevail when I got cousins in jail
The IRS send me mail, but how the fuck can I fail
When this is greatness
The label pushing for sales
Enough to drag a nigga through hell but you can tell this is greatness
If Stevie Wonder read braille
Michael Jackson made thrill and Malcolm excelled
Like getting 5 mics or double X-L
When you see them bright light from that bubble S-L
Think greatness, yea this is the theme song
More than a game, but I put my whole team on
My voice is the shoulder for my people to lean on
The beat is the pillow for my niggas to dream on
Fight like a soldier, boy, get your marine on
Lord grant me the strength to battle my demons
Who do we run to? Who do we scream on?
Keep bagging up that shit you know the customers fiend on
The greatness

[Bridge]
When I hear your voice
When I see your face

[Verse 2: Like]
I'm looking for, inspiration, something to write
Something to make me smile like the love of my life
It's out there somewhere, and she gon' come to light
'Til then, I got this jump-off coming tonight
This industry is like a war with no gun or a knife
Homie you chasing fame but it come with a price
Call my pops on his cell for some humble advice
Told my cousin locked in jail from a troublesome life
To keep your head up guy, and pray to the man up high
Providing strength to get us by
Dreams of buying mansions that sit up high
Lord knows that living broke shit ain't fly
The devil on my shoulders tryna break our stride
Circumstances come but the great survive
When shit get down and whips get impounded
Still you can't take away our drive, it's the greatness

[Chorus]
When I hear your voice
When I see your face
You know I can't help it
But I feel something great
No matter what they say
You're on to something great

[Verse 3: BeYoung]
Every first of the month, they try to break us down
Repo man even try to take your smile
Skies is the limit so they can't take the clouds
Whole nation black, guess we all Raiders now
And they try to play us out like we never [?]
Proud to be a nigga, heard James say it loud
That's greatness, for the faith that they can't shake
Great rhymes got me floating on great lakes
Great game got me lamping with a great date
Thick as sirloin, only play for great stakes
Uh, have mercy for that man's style
Clean nigga couldn't wipe me down with a shamwow
No other plans now, we gotta get it
Great on everything we touch, that's for the critics
Meet the whole team plush, moving out the digits
Rather count the paper, I can do without the business
Always seen the goal, now it's time to do the mission
Going down in history, who you think is with it

[Chorus]</pre>
