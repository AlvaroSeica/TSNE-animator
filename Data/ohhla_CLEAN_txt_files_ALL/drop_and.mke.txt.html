Now by the 3rd verse it's way hotter
We wide open she dropped it down low
With her hips and her thighs rolling I noticed
That can't nobody do it like I do it
I'm posted in V.I.P. with 2 chick on the side of me
We got money so tell the other niggas to stop pulling
Out they cash and let me see how you act for a stack
Drop it low and brang it up like you a fool
Now put a dip in yo back and let me see what you can do
She say if she bend it over it'll be a full moon
I told her bend it over let me see that full moon
Like the boom boom room whole club on tune
Shake it like you tryna break it ain't no sense in even faking
You know me I do it big by the bar and tell em jig
As soon as we walk in the do' we go straight to the dance floor get it poppi'n

[Hurricane Chris &amp; Mike Jones]
She busting it wide open, and shaking it on the floor
