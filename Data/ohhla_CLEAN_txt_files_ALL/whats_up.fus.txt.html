(Chorus)
can we rock
yeah, what's up doc
can we rock
yeah, what's up doc
can we rock
what's up doc
can we rock
what's up doc

cha cha cha, what's up pa yo who poop, your ma dooks
or pa dooks, there's two scoops a raisin in the sun
brothers try to rally up then dilly dally for some room
bird peckin, double deckin, rubber neckin in my tomb
check it out yo, I smile like groucho marx
I make a joke hokie poke an dslide by like egg yolk
play me like a punk like penguin and the joker
snoopin in my biz like tom and roxie roker
so bust a freaky freaky freaky ways
the brothers with the asianguise
making g's and now we're sellin records overseas
holy smokes, oops your whole plan goofed up
now you get licks now get kicks nuff licks now kuffed up
cuz you can catch a quick drop
for tryin to take the schnicks props
so tick tock around the clock
and shock while we lick shots
for goodness sake's the stakes are high
I'm out, abc ya' bye

(Chorus)

I tawt I saw a putty cat, I did I did
the humpty dumpty bashful grumpy quaker nabisco crisco kid
cuz my styles figaro figaro figaro figaro like pinocchio's
big digital underground underground humpty dumpty camel hump
nose so play dosey doe suffering succotash my mistletoe is gone
snow white is after my seven dwarves my style and after me lucky
charms, so leapin leprechauns be glad I'm pushin' my pedal
to the metal I'm rugged and rough for cocoa puffs yes and I love my fruity pebbles
so hody my partner I starts ta get meaner
so ask bob fo rhope not mr. bob dobalina
oh here has my mic gone, tell me have you see her
I stretch like a condom, and gets plump lika a weiner
or a sausage of course it's time for chip to wreck it

but before my intro I gots to mic check it
so who is the nicest in your neighborhood
lyrics are merry merry quite contrary
and captain crunch berry good so rah rah sis boom bah
chip fu is coming again give thanks and praises to jah
my lyrics are smooth like the head on terry savalas
my tongue starts to quicken like speedy gonzalez
take up yor pen your pad your lyrical and bag and run go whole a fresh
touch pussy cat put down that mic cuz you can't rap
cuz I'm dip dip divin, so so socializin
clean out your ears, yes and open up your eyes
and I kick like bruce lee and jean claude van damme
so dunna 6x bat man a hip hop hop hop don't don't stop stop
I'm harder than a flintstone and much bigger than a chub rock
or types of lyrical styles yes the schnickens can pick them
I burp stick em ha ha ha stick em

(Chorus)

rippin the program slow man hot damn
a grand slam swing things again and again
golly hachooey macho like raosoce
a randy sandwich manwich swing a dingle ling like damage
pauish not antoinish nor monetego
spanish like que? for the 9 2 lingo
next a new hex commentators stand aside
stringin mc's like a bikini or panty line
nut you might bust but ya can't even come right
spite the strokin or hopin or pullin a peace pipe
huff and puff so what is happening
on the miracle lyrical that is spiriual but everybody's rappin
flip a new hit catch wreck to the 9 ship
equipped never slip concept with tongue twister
all my styles that's buck wild no fake rap I push pounds
I flip mad scripts and hip I hit so bring the goya oh boya
as I say hasta manana soft and chewy hong kong fooey
reggae but not rasta tought stuff can I rock

(Chorus)

I'm the hooper hyper protected by viper
when I'm not hoopin you'd better decipher
in other words you'd better make a funky decision
cuz I'm a be a shaq knife and cut you with precision
forget tony danza I'm the boss
when it comes to money I'm like dick the frost
now who's the first draft pick word in bornin
not a christian laettner not alonzo mouring
that's ok not being bragga docious
supercalifragelistic shaq alidocious
peace I gotta go, I ain't no joke
now I slam it, jam it
and make sure it's broke

(repeat fade)
what's up doc</pre>
