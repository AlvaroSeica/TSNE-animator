Song:   We Live to Rock
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

We live

We live

We live

We live

We live 

I dug deep down in my soul
Brought it back for rock 'n roll
And those who live to rock

Went around the world to get it straight
About who's number one, who's second rate
For a few who live to rock

Jealous hoped we fall, but here we stand
We came back to take command
Cause we, we live to rock

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We live to
Rock
Rock
Rock
Rock

You get in your car, gas to the floor
You're the one who lets it roar
Cause you, you live to rock

You go to school, you carry a box
The teacher tells you you better stop
But you don't, cause you live to rock

You go to the club, you're under-aged
You sneak in back just to get onstage
Cause you, you live to rock

No matter what they say, don't change your ways
Just rock with us all night and day
Cause we, we live to rock

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We live to
Rock
Rock
Rock
Rock

We come off hard, cause that's the style
Record it, put that on file
Cause we, we live to rock

They put us down every day of the year
Nevertheless we made it clear
That we, we live to rock

So when they get on your back about everything
Just open your mouth, just open your mouth - and sing

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We live to
Rock
Rock
Rock
