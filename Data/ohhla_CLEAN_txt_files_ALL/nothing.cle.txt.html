Typed by: @Cale_Sampson

[Chorus]
Nothing to prove
( I got ) Nothing to lose
( if you ) Stepped in my shoes
( you would ) see what it's like
( I got ) Nothing to prove,
( And there's ) Nothing to lose
( So I'll ) Keep makin' moves
And singing on this mic

[Verse One]
It's time for you to think outside of the box
The music I make's not your typical hip hop
I can do the punch line thing, but it's easy for me
It's boring, I'd rather say something that's important
There's a difference between me and other rappers
All you have to do is listen to the subject matter
Ain't nobody else trying to enlighten your minds
Putting their life on the line, with what they're writing in rhymes
Who's speaking out, informing the average Joe
With the courage to go against the status quo
So don't compare or try to categorize me
With other people who don't deserve to be beside me
Cuz' what I'm doing is way bigger than rap
Your head's in the sand, if you can't figure out that
In fact, it's a whole new style I'm creating
I call it info-rap, people say it's ground breaking

[Chorus]
Nothing to prove
( I got ) Nothing to lose
( if you ) Stepped in my shoes
( you would ) see what it's like
( I got ) Nothing to prove
( And there's ) Nothing to lose
( So I'll ) Keep makin' moves
And singing on this mic

[Verse Two]
When it comes to business, I'm through giving breaks
Since I focused on myself man, I've been doing great
And I've done it on my own, without a record label
No distribution, but still made a ton of sales
Managing myself, I've been selling out shows
Performing with acts that are internationally known
Holding my own, with any artist on stage
Across the globe, and I've got a growing fan base
Cuz' I treat every concert as if it's my last
Like it's life or death, every time I'm spitting a rap
I'm kickin' ass, everyone's sick of the crap
That's on the radio, we don't wanna listen to that
And the industry never paid attention before
I won a best songwriter of the year award
So the taste of success, I'm loving it man
Cuz' anyone that's doubted me, now I'm rubbing it in
( I've got )

[Chorus]
Nothing to prove,
( I got ) Nothing to lose,
( if you ) Stepped in my shoes
( you would ) see what it's like
( I got ) Nothing to prove,
( And there's ) Nothing to lose,
( So I'll ) Keep makin' moves
And singing on this mic

[Verse Three]
If there's no content, than it's not impressive
To me, it's less about the flow and more about the message
My goal's to educate, and music's the most effective
Medium, to be someone that the youth can connect with
The beat's up tempo, catchy when you hear it
But I'm just really trying to make you listen to the lyrics
Cuz' the state of the world now is unsettling
It keeps me up at night, while y'all are settled in
Off in la-la-land, guess ignorance is bliss
How are you contributing, or are you just oblivious
Who cares about money, I've never sold out
To become more popular and not help anyone else
That's not what it's about, and don't forget
I've worked twice as hard as you, you better show respect
Plus I know when I'm old, just before my death
I'll look myself in the mirror, and I'll have no regrets
( Cuz' I have )

[Chorus]
Nothing to prove
( I got ) Nothing to lose
( if you ) Stepped in my shoes
( you would ) see what it's like
( I got ) Nothing to prove
( And there's ) Nothing to lose
( So I'll ) Keep makin' moves
And singing on this mic</pre>
