Typed by: suckafree_70@hotmail.com

One, two, three, four, five tre five
just phat playas make the party mo' live

[Chorus]
Indo smokin' money my thang (my thang)
I keep my mind on the green (crest sida)

[Dubee]
Now open up yo mind take a ride with me
and hit up on the spiff with yo brain on G
we hit the track thinking scratch, big bank, and scrill
money making schemes so the dreams be real
its the hog in the game thinking schemes to get paid
hound on the hook represent the Pimp Tray
never sport a fade known to let the perm bang
coming through sidin' with those Chevy's  on thangs
know to serve a trick with but nothing but the hits
playa hataz hate cuz ya boy be on hit
cuz im down to make it quick, the fetti and the cents
neva pay the rent cuz ya boy be on hemp
and the hemp to my brain checkin game to be shied
just out strictly running with the mobb
steady fetti related won't laved out the Leroy
smashing in the Fo-Do
that's how we be boy

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Now I ride like a g on perk and squeeze
with a pack of backwoods and some hurt ya D
on the turf bout my dirt so I hog fo da green
nothing but a soja fo doja I feen
spiff like hit night sags cuz I stack
won't slag on the track or play the green mack
playa playa extreme just a fetti fen
gotta stack g's shake muts and the fleas
(playa please what you in it fo)
im in it fo da loot
stack g's fo my ni's 30 rounds when I shoot
I hound halla (ROOF) coming like a big dog
tacked off the doja and the thick fog
and I hope to get y'all ki'ed as I take lead
on this dank green hogging' on these bay streets
I stay ki'ed steady keeping it in focus
so don't ask me act like you know trick

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Now game is what I sale yeah I'll tell you bout a mack
from the niggie North Pole cuz we club crest track
I mack won't slack up on a trick
100% crest side on the mic Sugawolf Pimp
fool that's what I holla all about my dollas
in the game of O.G's fleas and street stylas
fool I be soakin' keepin' it in focus
running with the mobb way sharp and the so just
drop they jaw while im gone in the wind
chasing feddie like a hound dog g's what I spend
I bend the cornas pottin' mobbing in a tac
sippin' on yak wit the perm on my back
spittin' game like a sailor pirate of the seas
with my lips on a taylor you know me
and most defiantly  I hog fo the team
stayin' focused on my green and the pimping scheme

[Chorus] - repeat 4X

[repeat 2x]
One, two, three, four, five tre five
