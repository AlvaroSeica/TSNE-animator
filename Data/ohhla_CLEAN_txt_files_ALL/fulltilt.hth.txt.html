[Chorus] {x2}
So what's your name
Suffa mc on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what
Say its alright
So what's your name
Pressure mc on the mic tonight
Say word, say what
Say its alright

[Verse 1: Pressure]
I got Aussie purity like pollies got immunities
I only litter in public cos I'm craving employment opportunity
See I'm ya average fella, mate I have to tell ya
Ignorance is bliss until you listen to my accapella
I read them pictures in magazines, I dug the covers of books
I take hip-hop on face value don't pay a cent for their looks
I see these scenes getting ugly, lucky we vision impaired
Cos that image is skin-deep like the make-up they wear
I keep my ear to the streets and my hand on my wallet
I keep my feet on solid ground and keep searching for profit
For what its worth I carried the weight till it practically kills
It's worse, only I can't afford my chiropractical bills 
I'm actually ill, relax and chill its time to build
There ain't no scars this world can put on me but time won't heal
See its your own complex that puts you under pressure
Tearing it up is easy fella but can you put it back together

[Chorus] {x2}
So what's your name
Pressure mc on the mic tonight
Say word, say what
Say its alright
So what's your name
Suffa mc on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what
Say its alright

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Reverse a rhyme, factory line I'ma tear this mic apart
And I'mma start by giving shouts to Nazi arts
What's up troops, I split loops like Atoms
A girl like Eve's like fruit to Adam
So take a bite off it, if its tight knock it
This my stage sucker get your mic off it (he said off it)
The force in my soul is sonic 
My brains a CPU, I'm simply 2-0 bionic (who ya on it)
My man just clap your hands for style
It's a free trip to Afghanistan, you don't want it
Like keep a preist in the bathroom this shit is blessed
You couldn't bring it on if it gave you one and gave you its address
I give my boys your address and get your house plundered
Better call Wedneday 4 cos your days are numbered
Cut the record like lumber, full tilt boogie
Odd to on Suffa in the battle, ask your bookie

[Chorus] {x2}
So what's your name
Suffa mc on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what
Say its alright
So what's your name
Pressure mc on the mic tonight
Say word, say what
Say it's alright

[Hook]
