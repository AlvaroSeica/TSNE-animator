[Long Axe]
He was a, big younging, heart wide open
Hoping life fit him, like them tight Nike Jordans
The boy had a shorty round the way, called him gorgeous
Daddy from VA, but her momma came from Georgia
He thoguht of college, but the streets came between him
Sorta like a shortcut to riding in a B.M.
Cuz momma told him every moment that she seen him
The only thing blinging would be night lights blinking
Ay, told his momma that she didn't have to worry
Hit him on the celly, he was home in a hurry
He lost his brother, so he listened to his mother
Didn't wanna see her cry, like she did when he died
It was like the streets opened up
Found him in the manhole, eyes had to close 'em shut
I didn't even get a chance to see him open up
That very next morning, when he wrote a note to us and said

[Chorus: Long Axe (sample)]
(Keep on drifting me up) Because (higher)
They ain't no reason to stop what we love
(Keep on drifting me up) Because (higher)
They ain't no reason to stop the street love
(Keep on drifting me up) Because (higher)
You only live once but you need to see love
(Keep on drifting me up) Because (higher)
They ain't no reason to stop what we love

[Long Axe]
Yo, all up in the 20's, man, damn, i'ts alot
School loans next to your plans to get a new home
And get your party on, maybe hit the club
Wrote another dub, then, walk up in the club
Get love from the bar, cuz he serving you that whooo
Body hit the tailspin, shorty look cute
Body close, cuz she really like the mood
And both of ya'll drinking, ain't thinking bout school
So relaxing, push up on the back end
Get a piece of paper and tell her where the action
What? Later on, bout 3 up in the morning
Driving from the club, head spinning from the buzz
She all snug, got a rubber in the glove
Got the other hand playing in her pants, nigga, what?
Then out of nowhere, here comes a truck
Caught up in the moment, too late to look up
Caught up in the moment, now you'll never see the butt, what
Caught up in the moment, see you wasn't waking up

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
Let's talk about the truth, the youth and the people in the streets
Ain't got alot to eat, but hey, they survived
Work unemployment, physical enjoyment
Smoke alot of cheeb', and reach for the sky
Love, family, hate for the enemy
Don't nobody want both worlds to collide
Walking thin lines, running past stop sign
This nigga really drunk and want me to ride?
No turn to yesses, intimate pleasures
You don't really care if he loves you or not
You just want the rent paid, every last cent made
And maybe if he left his boys on the block
We absorb music, even the stress in it
From the good, to the mess, we inherit the shit
But the fine print needs more refinement, baby
Got a greedy appetite for this American shit
They say let's keep it moving, cuz, can't nobody stop us
We ain't on no label, so can't nobody drop us
Everybody trippin', constantly falling
They be on that other line, I guess I missed my calling
Calling, calling, calling all cars
Do ya'll see them stars, that's out far
Seeing, seeing, seeing all the truth
Reaching out baby, try'nna touch the youth
I say, calling, calling, calling all cars
Can ya'll see those magnificent stars
Seeing, seeing, seeing, the truth
And if you reach out, baby, you can touch the youth, come on</pre>
