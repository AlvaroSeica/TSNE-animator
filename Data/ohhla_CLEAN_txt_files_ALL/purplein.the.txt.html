[ Hook: 2x ]
I got purple in my hands
Pocket full of grands
And all I wanna do is just smoke
Pass that rope
Smoke these bitches the fuck out
Smoke these bitches the fuck out

[Kaz Kyzah: 1st Verse]
All I need in this life of sin
Is my turf bitch and some privilege hen
Motel 6 or holidae Inn
Send a nigga Naked flix
When I'm locked in the pen
See, She said she don't give head much
But she givin me deep throat
To made her forehead touch
Handlin bundles she handlin business
And When I Smash she like Kaz
You want me to kiss you
Now, Turf bitch ain't really got shit
No Xxo Chanel or Austress
Eat month specials the days she roll wit
When she take dicks, She ain't wit no soft shit
Foods and cars, Slide it like a visa
Every other weekend she up at Rita
Ma, I don't need ya I'm good I'm gone
I got a few to perform like Three in the morn'
bitch

[ Hook: 2x ]
I got purple in my hands
Pocket full of grands
And all I wanna do is just smoke
Pass that rope
Smoke these bitches the fuck out
Smoke these bitches the fuck out

[Clyde Carson: 2nd Verse]
Turfed out with your Tongue Out
Bout to make a nigga run out
Licking your lips when I have my dick hung out
Shit thats how cum come out
So when it comes to Sex scenes
I'm jesus in he got game
Prince in Purple Rain, Eddie in Boomerang
Run the Denali hold the woodgrain
Neva eat it wit Vita gettin some good brain
Need a turf bitch, hoodrat, hoochie mama
She can't count but she can Swalla
Fix that bitch head She's a monsta
Turf ball finna turf, Team I holla
Reebok broads Melisa Madden Fashion
Three for the dubbz supporting her purple habits
From light smokers to attitude
Rest is doing their fabric
7-1 Berna girls, Step or call Castress

[ Hook: 2x ]
I got purple in my hands
Pocket full of grands
And all I wanna do is just smoke
Pass that rope
Smoke these bitches the fuck out
Smoke these bitches the fuck out

[Maine Mannish : 3rd Verse]
I'm lookin for a bitch like you
Turfed out on the block chick like you
Work every quarter on the corner like you
Call her Brain Section A just like you
I wanna run through
Excuse Miss, Whats Your Name?
Where you from?, What turf you Claim? [The Dubbz]
My name is Maine, Your name is Eisha?
Whoop Fukeisha? Or Laquisha
It really don't matta, I'm smokin leatha
It's not your my girl, your booty I'm afta
You have a numba? So I can hit ya
7-7-6 Metro Extension
Picture my vision, of me and you girl
Legs up high, Mannie now in your world
Bless me one time, your bliss real nice
Dig your whole swagger
Maa you doin ya job riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight

[ Hook: 2x ]
I got purple in my hands
Pocket full of grands
And all I wanna do is just smoke
Pass that rope
Smoke these bitches the fuck out
Smoke these bitches the fuck out</pre>
