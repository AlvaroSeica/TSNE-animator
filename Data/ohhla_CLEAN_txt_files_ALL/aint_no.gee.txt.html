[Webbie Repeat 4X]
I ain't no bitch(I ain't no)

[Verse 1 - Webbie]
Mayne I was raised around a bunch of niggaz who don't play around
some go getter ass niggaz fuck that waitin 'round
some ol'lawyer ass warriors if you hatin 'round
I lay you down with about eighty rounds
I'm the savage, young boss knock me, get knocked off
pussy nigga - bye, bye I'm finna buy another house
hate on me nigga why it don't matter I'm a count big stacks
ridin Lac's -  blowin killa by the ounce
hennesy, yes I'm deep fuckin run up in yo house
holdin it down for Pimp C ya'll need to let that nigga out
like keep it cool nigga shit but don't mess a nigga out
I'm a grown man with kids I'll stretch a nigga out
this for my soliders, who ain't gon'even roll it up if it ain't doja
if you ain't earned no fuckin stripes you ain't rollin
play with me I'll knock ya shit wide open

[Chorus - Webbie]
I ain't no bitch(I ain't no bitch)
I can't let no nigga punk me
I'm a gangsta, I'm a donkey I'm whatever you wanna call me
but I ain't no bitch - a made man, man made handle that when I feel played
from the cradle to the grave, I ain't no bitch
just say it death around the corner
run up on me you'se a goner and my problems you don't want it
'cause I ain't no bitch
if I ain't sayin shit I'm sayin, I ain't no bitch
fuck you and your click, I ain't no bitch

[Verse 2 - VL Mike]
Geezy done told you already we two for one nigga
alot of shit you boys talkin I already done it nigga
I got the call cause a nigga know how to dog it out
blocked out twenty four hours with killers from the south
they don't know bout the real, can't even spell it nigga
I hate ol'bitch ass type to run and go tell it nigga
with or without a pistol they know I stand alone
better stick to rappin nigga I check you off ya dome
I'm too hard for the public, too uncut for the T.V
you want that gangsta, guerilla shit it's already in me
studio makin I'm hard so I'm bringin'it harder
yeah I'm that first degree aggrivated man slaughter
me I'll get ignorant with it yeah they know how I rock
pray to God, me, T, and Kev' don't ever hit ya block
so nigga call ya people nigga go call ya click
I done told you I ain't, I ain't.....

[Chorus - Webbie]
I ain't no bitch(I ain't no bitch)
I can't let no nigga punk me
I'm a gangsta, I'm a donkey I'm whatever you wanna call me
but I ain't no bitch - a made man, man made handle that when I feel played
from the cradle to the grave, I ain't no bitch
just say it death around the corner
run up on me you'se a goner and my problems you don't want it
'cause I ain't no bitch
if I ain't sayin shit I'm sayin, I ain't no bitch
fuck you and your click, I ain't no bitch

[Verse 3 - B.G.]
Look every since I was young I been standin my ground
since eleven or twelve, Gizzle been holdin it down
I come up off V - L in the heart of uptown
I don't get spooked I'm use to that - blucker, blucker sound
any nigga wanna bring it to me - I'm a bring it back
they want be able to make no money where they slang that
'cause everyday I'm a be spendin where they hangin at
that AK 47 never stop when I'm bangin that
oh yeah it's real homey, I don't be stuntin partna
be on ya P's and Q's first time you slip I got ya
put it on everything I'm a break you off proper
that's how we roll in the N.O. this the city of choppers
it ain't nothin to me beef is all that I know
snatch niggaz holdin onto they folks out they door
I never been a square, a busta, or snitch
but most important I ain't no bitch...

[Chorus - Webbie]
I ain't no bitch(I ain't no bitch)
I can't let no nigga punk me
I'm a gangsta, I'm a donkey I'm whatever you wanna call me
but I ain't no bitch - a made man, man made handle that when I feel played
from the cradle to the grave, I ain't no bitch
just say it death around the corner
run up on me you'se a goner and my problems you don't want it
'cause I ain't no bitch
if I ain't sayin shit I'm sayin, I ain't no bitch
fuck you and your click, I ain't no bitch</pre>
