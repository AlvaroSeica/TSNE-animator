If shit's too hard y'all too soft

Act hard on the Internet
That's all?I'm grinnin' and finish them last thoughts
I won't lose and never break off
No we putbullin' in ya club
Always stay busy like bullets in the hood
Peace then it's peace, beef then it's beef
Halfhearted rappers, stop beefin' with me
Actin' like they wanna meet in the streets
I ain't buyin' like Bushido CD's
I know you love my style
Fuck you I hate your style

[Hook]

[Bridge]
That's how we fight back if you want beef {4x}

[Verse 3]

Say it loud Monstablokaz

I know you love ma style...
