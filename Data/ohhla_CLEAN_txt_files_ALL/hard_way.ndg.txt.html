[Unnamed woman yells at Nate]
So what'chu wanna marry me fo' now huh?
So I can support yo' ass?

[Nate Dogg]
How much money you got baby?
Count it out, count it out
Aw naw, ain't no marriage in this shit
You broke

One to the two to the three to the four
When you see the big Dogg give the doggy his bone
Couple fuckin lies and they mind is blown
I'm just makin sure the fuckin mic was on (1-2, 1-2)
Big Dick Willie standin next to you
After meetin me, ain't nothin you won't do
You like the crazy sexy lil' things I do (like uh)
Smokin weed while I'm sexin you
Niggaz want funk so I rip wreck roll
Niggaz won't bust cause they ain't bold
Take the hottest nigga's girl cause I'm just that cold
Niggaz talk shit so I s-s-stole
Now a nigga callin on my cellular phone
Mad at a nigga cause his coochie is gone
Mad doggin me like his bitch ain't grown
He had a bad bitch but her hair wasn't combed
I really didn't need it so I let her go
Even though I coulda stomped the nigga, word is bond
I keep sayin to myself I got a million hoes
Plus she really wasn't worth it so I just moved on
Who wanna get it? When I grab the mic, I give it
hundred percent, every fuckin time when I spit it
I drop a load and got y'all thinkin that I shitted
with no commode, if it's funky then I did it
My style is rough, full of bumps and divots
Y'all be talkin non-fic while I live it
I visit some cheap hotels most exquisite
Travel like a b-ball player, movin his pivot
Whether pirate or billy cat it was fitted
Nigga, forever to the streets I'm committed
My visions of bein number one, is real vivid
And y'all know the truth even though you won't admit it
You got a prob when I ride you better quit it
I'm Ludacris, I throw a +Bowe+ like I'm +Riddick+
And watch the blood run down yo' head from where I split it
And guarantee when I'm charged with it I'ma quit it

[Xzibit]
Xzibit, made from the best stuff in the universe
I bust first and make the crowd disperse
The worst thing you ever seen in your life
Like seein a pregnant bitch buy rocks and hit the pipe
It ain't like I ain't tried to tell ya, misery love company
Keepin the wrong company brings failure
I got a billion lies to tell ya
Cause y'all cain't handle the truth, here's the proof
Nobody sing better than Nate, it's a mistake
when you hate and disrespect the Golden State
I go straight for the jugular vein, who got game?
Like a castrated man you can not hang (ouch~!)
And havin no nuts is a fucked up thang
Get your head out of your ass and use your brain
It's a short ride to the top and a long way down
Roll it up, take a few puffs and pass it around

[Nate Dogg - singing]
I like that ass so back it up
Hit the floor, start actin up
You, know, what they want
And what they want they want they want
Three the hard way with a real nigga
Better broads, big dreams, we be livin it up
Freak-in what we want
We don't stop now, we never stop

Heyyyyyyyyy-yo! Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo hey yo hey yo {*2X*}</pre>
