[Nems]
Yeah, I ride forever, doin a buck five and better
Wish you was in the car, we could collide together
Go to the hospital, survive together
But get back wit'chu? I would never
Bitch we coulda died together
If you woulda just been real you'd be mine forever
But I'm back like fuck it though, bucket low
Cruisin on the motherfuckin street for another hoe
And when I get her we'll be so illegal
Just be faithful and stroke my ego
And we'll never have a bad day
Ran into your ex-man, nigga lookin mad gay
Heard my ex-girl was in bad shape
Well she shouldn'ta been a GUNTER, now don't nobody want her
And I know I played a part too
But right now I don't really give a fuck, bitch fuck you~!

[Chorus]
No more X and O's
Just doin whatever I feel, sexin hoes
Sayin whatever I like, sex and gold
What the fuck is the pain I feel? Empty soul

[Nems]
Okay coppers, I see you right there
in the shoulder lane wit'cha lights off
But I'ma tell you like this, you ain't catchin me tonight
Maybe tomorrow motherfucker

You fooled me once, you fooled me twice
I - put down the drugs and picked up life
I - might sound bugged but I know I'm right
And if you don't like what I say then fuck yo' life
I don't really give a shit yo, kill yourself
Hang yourself, bang yourself, OD on pills yourself
That's just what it is now
Cryin like a fuckin baby, who needs kids now?
We coulda been this, we coulda been that
Now we ain't gon' be shit, and it's like that
Words that you said, can't take it back
Now this relationship is over, fade to black

Damn this rain is comin down hard man
My wipers don't even go fast enough
This car don't go fast enough
Shit don't got a fuckin turbo button or somethin?
Let's go~!

Just accept it
All those years, all you did was make me better for the next chick
Hell no, I didn't expect it
And no we can't be friends, you gotta be neglected
Sorry but I gotta do it
And I'm sorry that you goin through it
Shit I could be sorry forever
But truth be told, sorry ain't makin me better
So here, take this song as a letter
of resignation, devestation, I'm tougher than leather
We woulda been nothin together
The time has come and gone, it sucks, but whatever
So please don't call me or text me
Go find a man and forget me
And if it makes you feel better, get at me
Move on and start a new life, be happy
