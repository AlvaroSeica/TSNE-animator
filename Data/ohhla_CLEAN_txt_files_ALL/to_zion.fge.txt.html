Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash (from liner notes)

One day, you'll understand... Zion

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
by what I had been chosen to perform

But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
for unto me a man-child would be born

Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
but everybody told me to be smart

"Look at your career," they said,
"Lauryn baby use your head."
But instead I chose to use my heart

Now the joy... of my world...
is in Zion!  (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy... of my world...
is in Zion!  (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

How beautiful if nothing more
than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before

Now let me pray to keep you from
the perils that will surely come
See life for you my Prince has just begun

And I thank you for choosing me
to come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace

See I know that a gift so great
is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

that the joy... (JOY) of my world... (WORLD)
is in Zion!  (IS IN ZION)  I said Zion!  (IS IN ZION)
Now the joy... (JOY) of my world... (WORLD)
is in Zion!  (IS IN ZION, IS IN ZION)
Now the joy... Zion! (JOY) of my world... (WORLD)
is in Zion!  (IS IN ZION, IS IN ZION)
Now the joy... Zion! (JOY) of my world... (WORLD)
is in Zion!  (IS IN ZION, IS IN ZION)
