[Intro: T.I.]
Ay J-O, you know the ol' sugar daddies
They be trickin, they tell them girls
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
Yeah (yeah)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Stacks on deck (deck) Patron on ice (ice)
And we can pop bottles all night
And baby you could have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah (yeah)
Late night sex, so wet it's so tight (tight)
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And baby you could go wherever you like (if you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (yeah)

[T.I.]
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone you
know it ain't nothin to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you could get it my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys I swear, yeah

[Interlude: T.I.]
I want yo' body (body) need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it I got it, go get it I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Shawty you the hottest, love the way you drop it
Brain so good (good) I swore you went to college
Hundred karat deposit, to vacations in the tropics
Cause e'rybody know it ain't trickin if you got it
Ya need never ever gotta go to yo' wallet
Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket
Five six rides with, rims and a body kit
Ya ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And go in any sto' for any bag she want
And no, she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything ya heart desires like that, yeah

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
I'm talkin big boy rides, and big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in yo' life
The thang get so wet, and hit so right
Let me put this big boy in yo' life
That's right

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Outro: T.I.]
