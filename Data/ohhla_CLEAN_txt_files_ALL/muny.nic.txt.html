[Hook]
Oh no we don't play wit silly girls
All I know is the material girls
Gimme the money, the cars and the caseloads
The mu-mu-muny, the yen and the pesos

The mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-muny
The mu-mu-muny, yen and the pesos
The mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-muny
The mu-mu-muny, yen and the pesos

The mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-muny
The mu-mu-muny, yen and the pesos
The mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-muny
The mu-mu-muny, yen and the pesos

The mu-mu-mu mu-muny, the mu-mu mu-mu-muny

[Verse 1]
Told y'all on Drake shit, told y'all to fixate
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape
I ain't fuckin wit you bum bitches no mo
Always in the club lookin like a bozo
Talkin bout money we can have a conversation
Top 5 tax bracket in the population
Hatin and I know they gotta reason why
I ain't gotta wonder if I wanna lease or buy
And I dictate how I'm gone piece da pie
I ain't talkin bout no muthafuckin pizza pie
Cause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin
Seen his little +weiner+ but we don't like Nathan's
Nah, homie you gone need a bigger cock-pit
Cause when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit

[Nicki Minaj spoken]
Aye yo Captain, aye yo Cap
I, I don't wanna hear that Navigation baby pa
huh I'm tryin, I'm tryin get some sleep, ya dig?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm in the UK, but just for one day
Who's to say I won't come back again
Materialistic, I'm narcissistic
My shoe game is mean, it's so sadistic
I took a lear jet to cop some lipstick
Yeah Imma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip my Rose, you sip ya Mystic
My flows a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace pythons, Louis aviators
Balenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson
I'm on the bike doin wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin
Gucci bag just to put the Coke cans in

[Nicki Minaj spoken]
Hey yo, Anna, huh huh Hey yo Anna Wintour
Huh huh Imma need that cover baby girl
It's Pink Friday, ya dig

[Hook]
Material, I'm always on that new shit
Material, this shit is exclusive
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)

Material, don't ever the the truth bent
Material, I could get you the blueprint
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)

Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material girls [repeat]</pre>
