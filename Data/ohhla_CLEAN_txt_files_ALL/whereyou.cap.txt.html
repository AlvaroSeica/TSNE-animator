Yaowa
Joell Ortiz

[Mr. Capone-E (Joell Ortiz)]
Aha, that's right
West coast
The new west coast (I'm from the east, baby)
One of the motherfuckin' streets
Gang banging shit, homey
We're on that gangsta shit (Me too)
I hear you all in the east
What's happenin'
But on the land of the palm trees
We get scandalous in Los Angeles County (New York, nigga)
Motherfucker (Yaow)

Chorus:
[Joell]    Where you come from, nigga
[Capone-E] I'm from the county of L.A.
           Where homeboys like us gunplay like everyday
           Where you come from, ese
[Joell]    I'm from Brooklyn, my nigga
           A wrong look'll get your face pushed in, my nigga
           Where you come from, nigga
[Capone-E] I'm from the county of L.A.
           Where homeboys like us gunplay like everyday
           Where you come from, ese
[Joell]    I'm from Brooklyn, my nigga
           A wrong look'll get your face pushed in, my nigga

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E]
I'm from the county Los Ans, where we get straight scandalous
Motherfuckers try to pad us gangbangers abandoned
Kamikaze paparazzi taking flicks of our life
Crooked cops plantin' a murder weapon, now you facing life
Palm trees, politicians where the rappers get popped
Home of "Straight Outta Compton," Snoop Dogg and 2Pac
Where we riot every time, fuck a peace, rattin' dawg
Where the cholos and low-low's
Land of the dirty smog
Young hogs
On a mission to earn stripes, where you gotta do wrong
If you wanna do right
On site, shoot you in ya knees
Gotta see you fucking bleed, Mr. Capone with a E
Fuck a wannabe

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I'm from BK, where each day, we pray to see the next
Diesel (???) out that tech bring that EMS
You either ride or die, but you can die, right
See, I supply, who supply, we supply them
So yeah, I'm hard to get through
My squad's official
Little dudes with the largest pistol
Big dudes with the smallest patience
We keep hospitals runnin'
We provide all of the patients
My dope like you, took a little walk in the matrix
So them fiends keep coming like Stallone did in Rocky I
I'm a P.I.M.P.
No sloppy buns
They make Papi cum, then bring me Papi ones

Repeat Chorus

[Joell Ortiz]
Where you come from (What up)

[Mr. Capone-E (Joell Ortiz)]
Yeah, what's happenin'
It's Mr. Capone-E, the one and only (Joell Ortiz)
Ay, where you come from, ese (Know what I mean)
West coast (Y'all know me)
That's right, east coast (I'm from the east, baby)
Connected, motherfuckers
Bubba doing ya shit
West coast til you ghost
That's right, all the way to east coast
Runnin' the shit (Yeah)
King of the streets
Mr. Capone-E
That's right
We doing this connection (New York, that's right)</pre>
