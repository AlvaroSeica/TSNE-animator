Where the furl nigga? Where the earl nigga? 
Gonna get ya fuckin' mind right. 
Tell me where the furl nigga. Where the furl nigga? 
Gonna get ya fuckin' mind right. 
Where the furl nigga? Where the furl nigga?

Chorus:
I got a pocket full of furl! (Hello!) 
So won't you go and get the earl!! 
(Hello!)
I got a pocket full of furl! (Hello!) 
And I'm gon' send you in that world.

I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't finna sell no fuckin' furl in that 1-2-3
You can be Tony Montana in this bitch with a boatload of furl nigga you still 
ain't sellin' shit
Start robbin' niggas back in 1993 and if you come on my set
Then nigga ya gots to face me
6 slugs strong comin' straight from that 3
I'm gettin' you full of that, boy
Nigga I know you know me.

Chorus

Bitch peep me out I'm on the set pushin' that boat
Listenin' to a nida cuz that bitch brings me joy
Nigga walked up said he was sick and needed a hit
And so I tooked the 14 fuck the 6 I can't sweat it
The seater push my shit cuz I'm tryin' to make a mill
No time to chill because I gotta pay my bills
And slippin' in the game, (mm mm)I ain't havin' it
That's why (when I'm on the set I'm always packin' my gat nigga)
In case a nigga try to nut up, get bucked up 
And run up and jump up
I have to leave ya fucked up
I know my furl be fuckin' with yo' mind
Cuz it's that torture and your makin' lines(3 whole lines)
I got that fire, so won't ya come and buy a 
Bag of that hello, downtown niggas door to door

Chorus

B.G.:
Gimme that boy, gimme that dope, I'm bout to go in that world
Get on the mic, buy big roofers, get a bag of that furl
It's my money so I bought it
My nose, so I snorted
I tried it the first time and you know I got retarted
I was spooked as the fuck 
Thought that I was in a maze
That nasty raw had a B.G. like me feelin' dazed
I went inside draggin' that monkey on me
My momma dis-owned me
That furl owned me
????????
I was on that fuckin' b and it had me real lazy
Now that B.G. graduated got me feelin' real crazy
I started scratchin' and scratchin'
Started itchin' and itchin' 
Pullin' my trigger till it's clickin' if a nigga start bitchin
I got a habit got me trippin'
Gat right beside me
Dope got me wanted for 3 armed robberies
Fuck, I'm trapped
I need a shoulder to lean
15 (what you is?)
A strung out dope fiend

Tec-9:
Motherfucker you touch my bag, then nigga you bought that bag
Niggas leanin' to catch the habit but I just can't have it
Although I fly all night and serve 'em proper
The money hungry crimp stopper
That fuckin' ???
Nigga hit me with that 580
If I'm busy I'ma send you to grab my old lady
Stationary nigga I ain't playin' on the real
That same torture that brought ya to that other level took a ride bout ya
And stopped them water ????
Same dope man look here
Who would ever thought that dope would take a nigga under
Sometimes I wonder why all these niggas around me
Could it be they want a bag of that capital T-E-C
Goddamn, what a nigga will do for a program
Who I am, the motherfuckin' dope man
For sure fall, don't make me go and get my four four bulldog
Because you know I'm gonna act a fuckin' peer hog
I got grams, half a gram, bundles and them whole thangs
I'm all about that 11 5 man

Chorus

Yella:
Just gots to pack it, I'm in the back of the cabby
Readin Dear Abby
Like a cool John Dillinger up in the 90's
Shots open I got just whats the fuck you need
All you snorters and you shooters come and see me
I'm on the block with the raw like you never saw
I got a pouch full of shells from my sawed off
Hit you in ya habit daddy
I'm goin' all the way out
You heard we gots the fire now you startin' to bad mouth
But we's a click that won't quit
Got ya bitches sick
Ya got a bag from the fella now ya full
The fuck I'm never puttin' over a half up on my product
Now you can look if you deal with me
Stay real with me
And I just might throw you a extra bag
Issue out some samples, they runnin' like Earl Campbell
If you fall short I gots to make you out of an example
You bitch you (you bitch you)
And we gots that furl
