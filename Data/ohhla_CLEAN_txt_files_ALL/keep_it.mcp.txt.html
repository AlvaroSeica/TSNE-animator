(I thought I oughta tell you, better yet warn you)

Keep it in your pants, tucked away

Yo, check this out

[ VERSE 1: MC Peaches ]
Yo, I'm the Peach and I came to say
Keep it in your pants, tucked away
And to the ladies in the house, watch your back
Cause if you thought it was a treat, well, it ain't jack
Step like a queen, take your respect
If they treat you like booty, load up the tec
Spray em like a roach or school em like a young boy
To bring joy, bring em like a fool's toy
In any case, let the nigger know
You're not the hottie to be played like a little hoe
It's time for us to take control
Put papers in our pockets and strength in our soul
I am woman, I get recognition
And premonitions from woman intuition
So if you wanna step like a 'Q', step
Cause I demand respect

Keep it in your pants, tucked away
(Word is bond)

Yo, check this out

[ VERSE 2: MC Peaches ]
Yeah, listen up as I start to progress
Keep your hands off the butt and the chest
Ladies in the house don't go for that
If he's rollin with a crew, yo, I got your back
Step as a Nubian, be real proud
If he treats you like butt, scream on him loud
Train him like a dog or beat him like a rug
Start to bug like you was on a drug
In any case, let the nigger see
You're a Nubian queen and you're proud to be
See, it's time for us to take control
Put papers in our pockets and strength in our soul
I am woman, the creator of man
And, the other hand cleans the other hand
But if you wanna go like a go cart, go
At least now you know

Keep it in your pants, tucked away
(Word is bond)

Yo, check this out

[ VERSE 3: MC Peaches ]
Hm, take 3 as the rhyme continues
I saw it happen in many a venue
Fellas in the house, one thinks he's all that
Steps up wrong and he gets smacked
Good for his ass, don't take shit
If he try to get loud, get proud and flip
Flip him like a flapjack or an applejack
Go get him back, hit him with a funky track
In any case, let the nigger feel
You're not a toy to be played, you're the real deal
(Ladies) so let's take control
Put more papers in our pockets and strength in our soul
I am woman and you are not
I could never ever got get or get got
So push on if you disagree with me
Just remember, you heard it from the P

Keep it in your pants, tucked away
(And my word is bond)
