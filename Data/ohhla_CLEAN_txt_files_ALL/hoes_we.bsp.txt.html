This is Dres
The Suga Dick Daddy Mistah Lawnge and myself make up
this crew called Black Sheep
Now uh, I knows a lot of hoes
And being that I knows a lot of hoes I get asked a lot of times
Dres, whats up with you and all those hoes?
Well check it

Let me put you down, up on a riddle
I'm the type of brother that is swinging with a fiddle
Out to get a lot because I never like a little
Which is why I ban a dip that claims she's in the middle
Met a honey riding on the trolly
Looking kinda Dolby said that I could call her Molly
Said she had a lover that went by the name of Polly
As she kicked it, I thought that I should dolly
She said Polly want a cracker but the dip is not desired
Cracker got a honey though she's about to be fired
He wants to get Anna better yet he wants to bone her
Anna's got a man though and I don't think he would loan her
I said honey honey I said it slow
Coming is my stop and I really have to go
Not to cut you short or to interrupt your flow but uh
Whats up with the mojo?
She gave a big grin, I knew that she was with it
We stepped off and we Niked (huh?) We just did it
Boots were kind of fly yeah I like the way they fitted
Honey was the woman and to her I did admit it
Lathered up the nuts and I changed my shoes
Took off the browns and put on the blues
Sweetie I'm the paper called the Daily News
And today's headline reads: here you can't snooze
After she was dressed we both broke out
Said she had to go and see a brother with clout
She said I'm hungry, hungry no doubt
Uh lemme get a hot dog with extra sauerkraut
She stepped to the left I stepped hard to the right
"Can you spare a quarter?" Yo black go fly a kite
Gave a little bark but he wouldn't dare bite
For that would be the end of his night
Walk the city streets wonder who I'll see
There goes Mistah Lawnge and my man Peewee
Look upon their faces coincides with glee
What's up Dres yo what's up P
What's up with the skins said I just got deep
Did it cost a lot, naw the boost were cheap
Costed me some time and a little bit of sleep
A fresh jimmy hat and some kosher meat
Guess I got their goose to their toes they rose
My man Peewee broke out but Lawnge stood in a pose
Lookin at some kids going by in afros
Then pulled out a book entitled "Hoes I Knows"

Dres: Listen, Mistah Lawnge
Lawnge: What's up
Ders: Being that a brother such as yourself knows so
many hoes
why don't you tell me
Whats your particular favorite ho?
Lawnge: Well I like sexual chocolate hoes
Milky hoes, goya hoes, pork fried rice hoes
Red light special hoes
And my favorite? Mmmm triple H

[Dres]
Love a black sheep ho cause she's down to swing
Goya hoes are fly but they wear anything
Triple H is silky but it seems to me
That a milky ho believes she's invented - (poonani)
Similak hoes bring an instant erection
And them red light special hoes hold the fly complexion
Sexual chocolate hoes are like a game of bridge
And pork fried hoes, don't even speak the language
All in all I love them when the time is right
Only ho I hate is ho a la strobelight
Then again I know when it's late at night
I never say never cause I know I just might
Certain kind of heads that my dip can't see
Baby Chris, Pause, Red Tip and Big Ali
Afrikaa, Lawnge and soon a kid named Chi
How do my hoes look? (Just call me choosy)
Honeys hear that word and they say van damn
Not to cause offense even though I know I am
Take it in stride, you survived the Son of Sam
It's a Black Sheep thing who gives a fuck if you don't understand
