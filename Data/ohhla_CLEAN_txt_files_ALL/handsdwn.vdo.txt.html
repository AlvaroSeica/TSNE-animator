Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Pop bottles if you work it, waste dollars purpose
Blow it fast Summer trucks can't follow our horses
Yeah they can't follow the horses let me know if you can follow the versus
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
I get ain't now let me hear the fan loud
Got the inside sand brown start it up room room get the land crowd
Weed is my damn pal
Keep the broads coming
We're in the club two minutes keep the cars runnin'
You want me to start frontin touch the handle unlock no car button

I got a man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
I got a man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I'm the man now, I'm the man now

I got the hands down, I'm the man now
I demand child looking at a man child
Just before got my famz proud
I'm here now paint me going cam style
Hundred Gram pound
I don't trap much, I'm in the back what foamposite black ups
Both pocket stacked up you a track smut so tell em back up
You're coming like mack you frontin get clapped up what's your name hoe
I'm back stage low holla like ayooo
Lot of thing, lot of fame let the chain gloo
Let it rain, let it aim let that thing go!

I got a man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
I got a man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I'm the man now, I'm the man now

What's the plan now turning your head pal
Don't get ran down with beef we plan pals
Ha shoot out cam child light skinning bull getting higher then Cham brown
My whole camp wild most hate it
I ain't the only one to know, we all made it
Lenox ave gang we're living the fast lane
We get it fast spending fast relaxing, most of you niggas procrastinating
Addition that trash cans so put them in trash cans what's popping what's happening
Trapping out for the gutter plus I'm a Mack man

I got a man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
I got a man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I got the man's down, I'm the man down
I'm the man now, I'm the man now</pre>
