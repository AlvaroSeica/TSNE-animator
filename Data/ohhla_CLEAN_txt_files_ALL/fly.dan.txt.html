[Verse 1: Danny!]
So I've been through these hard times, mentally scarred
Almost lost my sanity but got no sympathy cards
And there's been, a couple times when my knees buckled
I'd be in a heap of trouble if I didn't juggle these rhymes
You know these God-forsaken issues make you wish you could fly
Sometimes I wanna put my fist to the sky
And say goodbye to these worldly things
I wish that I could trade these pearls for wings
And give complacency a whirl, it seems
Every time I feel content, it's meant for me to lose
Control of situations, my patience is overused
Confused, my friends are saying I should be glad that I made it
So tell me why I feel so jaded
I'd trade it all for a couple minutes of some peace of mind
And leave behind this stress; if I cease confinement
Of my soul, my soles can finally leave the ground
I ain't never comin' down

[Chorus]
If we try, we can fly
To a place in the sun
All we need is belief
And a friend we can trust
If we try, we can fly
To a place in the sun
If we try, we can fly
Fly...fly...fly..

[Verse 2: Peace]
Let me reflect on MY situations, and what I'm dealin' with
I had to grab my pen; that's when I grabbed my healing, quick
And then I realized that I wanna fly
To the place I see every time I close my eyes
Because it's hard to deal with everyday tension
Ill intentions, fake cowards, I gotta mention
These devils comin' at me with hopes to interrupt
God's plan, I'm tired man, I've had enough
I'm tryin' to live it up, but they wanna see me down
They wanna see me frown, they will never take my crown
I take 'em round for round, and I won't fall
And while the weak drop, I just stand tall
Got haters throwin' stones, but they can't "rock" me
Just because I'm so confident, they say I'm cocky
This constant ignorance gets old I can't lie
That's why, I'm using my wings...I'm 'bout to fly

[Chorus]
If we try, we can fly
To a place in the sun
All we need is belief
And a friend we can trust
If we try, we can fly
To a place in the sun
If we try, we can fly
To a whole 'nother place

If we try, we can fly
To a place in the sun
All we need is belief
And a friend we can trust
If we try, we can fly
To a place in the sun
If we try, we can fly
Fly...fly...fly...</pre>
