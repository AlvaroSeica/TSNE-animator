Baby, you could be the healer
You could be the cure
For what I'm feeling right now
'Cause right now I need the repeat

Baby, you could be the doctor
I'm a let you go to work
'Cause I know you could fix me somehow
Look around, all the best for me

So I'm a trust with my body and my mind
And anytime I can, I'm sure, I'm sure you'll clever find
You just promise you just take your time
And take care of me

What you do with your hands
How you use them
Got me losing my brain when you move 'em
And I hope this ain't just an illusion
Abracadabra, magic

Baby, you could be the trainer
Go and do your thing
As long as you work it out
Don't go easy pace

Money giving a disclaimer
For my pleasure, you're the one to blame
I fell so deep in lust
You accommodate my needs

So I'm a trust with my body and my mind
And anytime I can, I'm sure, I'm sure you'll clever find
You just promise you just take your time
And take care of me

What you do with your hands
How you use them
Got me losing my brain when you move 'em
And I hope this ain't just an illusion
Abracadabra, magic</pre>
