[ Toddy Tee ]
Ah yeah, girls
You've been wondering where we've been?
It's like Alpha Beta, go tell a friend
We've been watchin L.L. Cool J rock the bells
Run-D.M.C. raised a little hell
DMV gave the Beastie Boys a License to Ill
Took Kool Moe Dee to the doctor for a pill
But it's 1988, girls
and we're gonna get it together for ya
like this

So we can get drunk

Oh, we'll get drunk
(Uh)

and get a 8 Ball, baby

We'll have some fun, baby
We'll have some fun
