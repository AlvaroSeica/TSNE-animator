"C'mon man!"

[Chorus: John Legend]
And I can see here with my eyes closed
... now {"C'mon man!"}
Feelin like my life froze
I'm about to hit, the ground {"C'mon man!"}

[Snoop Dogg]
Sippin 'gnac while I elevate my mindstate
Hand by the burner case a ni'a try to violate
Never goin down, stay risin like Andre
Cause my corner back everything the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
E'ry day, e'ry night 'til I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin, tryin in the city
Been yellin out swish way before that in the net
And I ain't knockin niggaz hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call yo' name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in-betweens
You either hit the Hall of Fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't gotta wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rag sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bomb'll blow your face back
L-M-F-A-O to the bank, boy, ASAP

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I do it cause I feel it, live it like I'm talkin
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and want it
I'm so high, yeah the weed I'm still sparkin it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparklin
Got the competition shakin like Parkinson's
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketin
Life's a bitch, but I don't Car-di-gan
That's what a word to the third letter
Shots shots shots to me, and my cheddar
+Run D'eez MC's+, I'm +Tougher Than Leather+
Vietnamese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg, I'm bitin whomever
Cause I done came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success just pray it's from a tall glass

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the devil, that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery, get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world, where did the lonely kids
go when the bell rings, it's feelin like hell rings
is bringin me back down, just checkin my background
It's ironic what's happenin, imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear that momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visitin 'round the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change so we won't agree again
'Til then I'll be pourin out my soul
Just a few things I see when my eyes closed

[Chorus]

[John Legend]
Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohh
See it with my eyes closed, ohhh
Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohh
See it with my eyes clooooosed
Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohh
See it with my eyes closed, ohhh
Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohh
See it with my eyes clooooosed

"C'mon man!" {*echoes*}</pre>
