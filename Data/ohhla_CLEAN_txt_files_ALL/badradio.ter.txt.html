Killarmy has dropped the third bomb (word up)
Kid, Terrorist shit, Terrorist shit, niggas

Aiyo, what's cracking with the album right now, son

It dropped the same day and the joint got hit

The World Trade got blown up, knawmean (that's real)
Knawman, peace to all the families, knawmean

And everybody involved with the whole thing
The whole New York is hurting right now
Youknowhatimean, one love to whole New York right now

Yeah, uh-huh (let these niggas know how you do, it's war time
Come on, come on) Yo, son, I tell you what
Yo, for all ya warcats, check it out, all ya warheads
Yo, yo, yo

[Dom Pachino]
Offical warhead, infect ya brain tissue with poison lead
Global patrol, first to make it go, buzzin' with morse code
Strike 'em out, three in a row, power like Castro
Bustin' stardust, blind-folded, machine gun gold coded
Banana clip, all iced out, my man sold it to a foreigner
P.L.O. man, hold down a store with it
Got robbed, fleed to his country and went to war with it
The bi-coastal, rhymes loco, darts'll toast you
Short trimp, Powerule man, Terrorist vocals
Complex murderous mind'll smoke you
When I black out, you wanna bet money? Kid, pull ya stack out
Terrorist, in the daylight, expose the Mac out
We dangerous, I be a strong link within the chain of this
Bobby be the lock, you get a shot when I'm aimin' this</pre>
