[Chorus: Chester French]
You think you're using me, like this game's new to me 
But you ain't confusing me, you just want jewelry and all them fuckin shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me and I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just your part, just your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

[Rick Ross]
I'm inclined with women who come on they time
She came over and she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over: had her shopping in Milan
20 racks really thats sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari yeah thats the Easter bunny
At the Ceaser in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend half the ticket, give or take
A couple dollars Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything, plane chartered
I spolied her maybe cause I adored her
More than fly girl, a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
She said to love a bitch is to roll the dice

[Chorus]

[Wale]
I try to love 'em in the physical, not literal
She said she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner sole
So the devil that drove in her got in control
Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up
Though my paper way thicker than model make up
But y'all wait up my mind racing my toe slippin
A lot of women is real, some bitches Robin Given
I never give âem no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin bitches thats dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fUckin' with bitches that know they whole position
Thats real nigga shit, real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I'm tryna follow money, they tryna fall in love
Wale

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Yo, I say, how can they compare to you, everything material
Trickin' shit for kids and you know I dont need no cereal
You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
So all that other shit you on dead -- burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honeymooning you
Lobster over salmon, I ain't never try to tuna you
But now I'm just assuming you living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio cause everything was air play
1st class Hermes, Panamera, purp pass
Greed written on her face when I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck, it was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga puff
Just play your role and you can live it up

[Chorus]
