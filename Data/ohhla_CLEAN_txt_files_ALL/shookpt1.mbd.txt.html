(Prodigy):

The most violent of the violent-lest crimes we give life to
If these QueensBridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies
Your first time would be your last earth memories
It's only your own fault 
I gave you fair warning..beware..
Of killa kids who don't care
Unaware fools who be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery 
Hop on the words and rhyme
In nineteeth hundred and ninety square
All shook niggaz is supposed to have fear
Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share
Prepare for the worst cuz I been there
Try tah, keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggaz is forced to do dirt
And God made ....
So this jerk wouldn't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt
On the streets for nineteenth years
And not leaving
My first priority is to reach twenty one breathing
Forever beef 
Nobody would ever be even
So I grab the heat before breathing
Lost in this foul mind state
I can't keep straight thinking
But I keep my eyes on the earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front
He get slugs in him
Because..

(Chorus / Prodigy):

He ain't a crook son..son, he just shook one..shook one...

We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds..earn funds...
Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns
Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones..shook ones...
He ain't a crook son, he just a shook one..shook one...


(Havoc):

For every rhyme I write 
Is 25 to life 
To all my peoples in the Bridge
Know what I'm talking 'bout, right
Ain't no time for hesitation
That only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Cuz Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for the he say, she say
I'm bigga than dat
Claiming that you packing gats 
But you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island
Change your ways and stop
Thirteen years in the projects, my hard times of living
Wake up in the morning 
Thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or I am going to hell for all the shit I did
No time to dwell on that 
Cuz my brain reacts 
Front if you want nigga 
Lay on ya back
I don't fake jax
Kid, you know I bring it to ya live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal mind thirsty for recognition mission
I'm strictly sipping E&amp;J like got my mind flipping
I'm buggin diggin ..... over hustling
Get that loot kid
You know my motherfucking function
Cause as long as I'm alive 
I'ma live illegal
And once I get it 
I'ma put it on my people
React quick to lyrics
Like macs I hit... 
Your dome up
When I roll up, don't get caught sleepin'
'Cause I'm creepin' ...

...You just a shook one

(Chorus / Prodigy):

We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns
Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones..shook ones...
He ain't a crook son, he just a shook one..shook one...

We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns
Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones..shook ones...
He ain't a crook son..crook son, he just a shook one..shook one...
