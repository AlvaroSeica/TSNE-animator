its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
all I'm looking at is time wasted, what you talking bout
its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
all I'm looking at is time wasted, what you all about

its your behavior, its in your nature
I caught the fever, eager to meet the stranger
behind the makeup, no complications,
I know your language, just keep it basic
ease up, no emotions, don't loose focus
lets pick up the pace
conversations keep changing , keep flirting
your making moves I can work with
don't confuse me, I'm choosey, I change signals
keep that bougee shit on the minimal
get with the program, I'm bringing the party to the slow jam
on some next shit, do some things to get me interested
its now or never, I don't want your number, you can keep it
no commitments, no digits, take it or leave it

it's the vibrations

its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
all I'm looking at is time wasted, what you talking bout
its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
all I'm looking at is time wasted, what you all about

im bout to figure out, I might just stick around
on the weekend
hit the club on some james dean shit, I play it cool
mellow on the move, hard to reach me
its me and the beat, taking it easy
I know you see me
when I first walked in the door, I couldn't ignore
yeah, you seemed so secure, you seemed so sure
you had me hooked on the first look, leaning for more
that aint even what I came here for
don't hesitate, that's the rule of thumb
I got the jive talk to fool the drum
its in my blood like jamaican rum, I got you sprung off the native tongue
I blew you with words, I'm in your head
while you pose like I'm working your nerve
I aint the one you want to stress, you want to diss that and the third
the homies yell, why you fucking with her,
see it's the chase, see how long it takes
see if she breaks, its all about the right women
right time, right place, right
what you all about

its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
all I'm looking at is time wasted, what you talking bout
its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
all I'm looking at is time wasted, what you all about

it's the vibrations, what you talking bout

its what you want huh, well I'm a give it to you
I feel your heart racing, it's the vibration
I'm on your mind, I can see behind faces
ALL I'M LOOKING AT IS TIME WASTED, WHAT YOU TALKING BOUT</pre>
