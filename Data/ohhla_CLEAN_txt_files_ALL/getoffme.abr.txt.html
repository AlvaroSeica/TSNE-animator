[Verse 1]
I invert the expert
I'm introverted and I censor the texture
I may have flirted with the surface, how's it feel?
The outsider's dangerous as a Rottweiler
Mass appeal is a sign that it's worthless
Whatever you're looking at on TV is nervous
I'm here to serve this song with words just unwind and chill
Just observe this here rhyming skill
As I preserve and define the shrill
Ability to feel in me a timeless thrill
Yo, the standard is glamour
Lyricism's turned to mindless banter
I fear a system where the answer's image
Sny chance for winning has been diminished, take a glance, we're finished
The rap scene today is such a broken blur
It's the real lyricists who never don't get heard
And spoken word is so misinterpreted
I don't encourage; it's so absurd
And don't talk to me about the underground
You think that Mos Def is underground, stupid
So you got shot, now you're a good MC?
People sweatin all these gangsters with hood envy
Take a look at me
I'm not playin those same five songs spinnin on the radio
And they spit the same old lines
OK, I understand, Bacardi and party rhymes

[Chorus]
Get off me
Get off me
You're not worth-while, get off me
Cuz you spit your style so softly
Get off me
Get off me

[Verse 2]
My timing is climbing
You could chime in with rhymes because I've been
Given an assignment
To find realignment
My mind's on fire
Sire, I'm nothin but a humble squire
Here to please the kingdom and sing them songs
But if you could do it better then come on
Today is the day I unleash my front teeth
And smile and anyone who wants beef
This is the millennium of fronting and stunting
It leaves me wondering
What the fuck happened to rappin?
Hip-hop is a dead language like Latin
It seems like the audience prefers fraudulence
Rappers are actors like Keifer Sutherland
24 hours of market and promotion
While rap used to be about starting a commotion
Now it's normally sellin, and it's warmly accepted
Not a form of rebellion, cuz it's been intercepted
And within the deception, is a fake luminescence
Rappers shining and blinding everyone from their essence
So my presence is a gift I sift through the issues
And lift you to heights where rap wants to get to
You got your own label?
Aren't you mature?
Suddenly every rapper's an entrepreneur
And who's getting signed?
All of their friends
Your corny ass shoulda stayed at the holiday inn

[Chorus]
Get off me
Get off me
You're not worth-while, get off me
Cuz you spit your style so softly
Get off me
Get off me

[Verse 3]
1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
I know you can count but I expect more
Your album is flying off the shelves in the store
Then why in the hell are your rhymes so poor?
Every rapper's focused
But have you noticed that those kids are cleaner than a soap dish
It's hopeless these locusts are taking over
Spitting rhymes that're older than Abe Vigoda
Rap used to break ground now we breaking water
It's like mixing cocaine with baking soda -
Modern day hip-hop's a version of crack
The kids're hooked on it like herb in a sack -
And everyone's a gangsta
But it's only dead people that we can give thanks to for that development
And now they're selling this hardcore image that lacks intelligence
You got some skill let us in and see
I'm so ill Magic Johnson gave his medicine to me
I extract the abstraction
Just a fraction of rappin is not about fashion
I'm taking some action, cuz faking a passion
Is asking for wrath and I got no compassion
Now I'm asking for a ration, how can I cash in?
Should I dye my hair blonde and swear at my mom
Sign on and become another rap icon
Try and picture that with a Nikon
The day that that happens, tell you what, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Get off me
Get off me
You're not worth-while, get off me
Cuz you spit your style so softly
Get off me
Get off me
