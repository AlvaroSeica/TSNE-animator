[Emanon]
Death to the fake who be faking about they stake
and mistaken that Emanon is not flexing the raw
Real recognize that whenever we enterprises
We enter to mesmorize all the suckers and y'all
Better be giving props in the proper manner but man I don't understand
How so many crews be comming out wack
But I guess it doesn't matter about the latter they manufacture
A weak production matter of fact
Let me get to begin in on this and get to spitting in on this
The name is Aloe Blacc and yes I come fromm the Oooo
Range down in between the LA and the SD where the people be testy
Because they plastic you know
Major problem is that they spoilling all of they kids with money
Instead of making them work hard for the dough
But anyway they probably won't never say what I say
Because they too scared to admit they might becoming PSEUDO!

[Chorus]
We are turning (pseudo)
Everybody's becoming (pseudo)
Nature's dead (pseudo)
So we are (pseudo)
Everybody wants to be (pseudo)

[Emanon]
Answer me this, what's the point of popping the cry
If they ain't paying you to pop it up inside your lyrics
Answer me this what's the point of popping the gats
All up in your raps when on the streets you ain't even strapped
Answer me this yo why you gotta spit about drugs
Slanging in your rhymes you know lying you ain't a thug
Answer me this you came up cause your homey was signed
So why trying to act like you could bust raps you can't rhyme
You a pseudo psycho I might go and broadcast a
Documentary about your fake ass you won't last
Because the people be seeing through all that plastic
Take off the packaging sucka come out with some fat shit
That's it, don't even speak a word on the mic
If it ain't true to how you live and verified to your life
'Cause you a pseudo, psycho
I might go and broadcast a
A documentary about your fake ass with no class

There are so many
Fake ass wannabes
Far as eye could see
Why can't they be real

[Chorus]</pre>
