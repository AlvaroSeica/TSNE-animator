Ay Yo Wise why they want to be pullin' out dey mics on me
Yo...I ain't be got no weapon, drop that booty butt-naked fo em' babyyy

Verse one
{Wise Intelligent}
I bring the lessons from Allah as speach to teach
As I speak to the brothers that be lackin'
Butt-Naked Booty Bless
Some simply say it be hittin'
While the teachers teachin'
All the other crews will be clappin'
Give me the time drop the rhyme
{Culture Freedom}
On two
{Wise Intelligent}
The Poor Righteous Teachers are gonna have ta' come teach
Either Culture Freedom on by
Standbye
Or either kick the scratch as the wise man speaks
Lesson number one so many brothers selling coke
But me know, I'm your brother who commence to drop
Educating tunes from a lesson of life
Built into a form hip style
Hip hop
No one could tell ya that Wise be the lacker
I study this style like I study my life
Takin da head of the snake that be snakin'
And building the brain cells of brothers my type
Gods get applause from the things we protest
Ya sexin' this style when this style is undressed
Culture one time for the mind 
Drop the drawers
This is the what?!
{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS

{Instrumental break}

Verse two
{Wise Intelligent}
I da divine
{Culture Freedom}
And Cult
{Wise Intelligent}
Teachin' as we greetin' every god with peace
Stoppin' every snake that the posse might approach
and stampin' on his head
{Culture Freedom}
This kid be'es weak
{Wise Intelligent}
Lessons are the key to the style I drop
Hip hop
Not weak miscellaneous rhymes
Stop me nigga please
Back, back calm down

{Culture Freedom}
Never sucker...No not this tiiime!!
{Wise Intelligent}
Praises are due to Allah 
Thats me
Wise Intelligent drop the God's technique
Who gives a damn if you stop my tribe
Steppin' thru the script and your crew don't speak
Give me the chance to ignite one thought
Just one it will teach every student in my presence
Wise Intelligent be the teacher I'm teachin'
Stop, look, and listen to the level of my lessons
Gods get applause from the things we protest
Ya sexin' this style when this style is undressed
Culture one time for the mind 
Drop the drawers
This is the what?!
{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS

Verse three
{Wise Intelligent}
There's so many styles that the Wise must teach
Check the speach
As I drop to the level of your brain
Teachin' you the knowledge of yourself
"Like you're God"
Now some may look at me and state that I'm insane
Get wise If God's your creator
Tell me this, Tell me this
If he's your father by the mental eye sight
And like father like son it begun
The vision make the blackman grab his birthright
Teaching is the duty of a civilized man
Teach truth to the youth
That be thirstin' for the knowledge
Take that head of the snake
That mistake
The Wise be the brother that could wax or either polish
Teachin' what was taught to the king that sings
Droppin' mathematics as the Wise comes through
Represented by the Sun, Seven, Moon and Star
And this is a taste of the PRT crew
Gods get applause from the things we protest
Ya sexin' this style when this style is undressed
Culture one time for the mind 
Drop the cause
This is the what?!
{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS

Verse four
{Wise Intelligent}
Stand back I attack
That weak new jack
That lacks must I mentally beat him
Poor Righteous Teachers teach to the weak
So I takes his weak, wack crew and teach them
Butt-naked booty style make it wild says the crowd
So drop Hip-Hop by the ounces
So loud as I teach this crowd, as I teach ya
and control that body as it bounces
Let me think should I stay meditate
Sink most deep into the crescent of your soul
Assume to accomplish techiques speak
this is from the Father who promise gold
Shakiyla my queen is my queen
This means this queen
submitting to the G-O-D
One G said "God not a mystery, God but Allah"
And Allah says "God be'es me"
Gods get applause from the things we protest
Ya sexin' this style when this style is undressed
Culture one time for the mind 
Drop the cause
This is the what?!
{Culture Freedom}
BUTT-NAKED-BOOTY BLESS
