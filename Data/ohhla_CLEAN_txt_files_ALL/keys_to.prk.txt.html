Song:   Keys to the Kingdom
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chester]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility!

[Mike]
It's our Final War
Tell me what's worth fighting for
When we know there's nothing more
Take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

[Chester Screams]

[Chester]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility!

[Mike]
Uh, I give you what you came for
This is not the same though
Got a different method
But I still can bring the pain so
Not all give the same flow
I got daddy's saying low
I ain't shock and get you
Never really in my range, though
Somehow they ain't grow
Half fried bango
All primetime
Imma let the bass bang low
All you fucking lames go
Aiming at my name though
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
(Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for)

[Chester]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Instrumental Break]

[Chester]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty! [2x]

[Kid]
I'm not allowed to say certain things, aahhhh!!

[Mike]
Try and do....try and do the other thing... real quick</pre>
