[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
Ok Ok Ok! Any problems he can go to Statik Selektah
Trouble with his spins? He can call Statik Selektah
But now the guy gotta come up with his money every week no matter what
Ain't sellin records? FUCK YOU PAY ME!
Oh you want him in your video FUCK YOU PAY ME!
No one's comin to your shows huh?! FUCK YOU PAY ME!
And then what do you do? When you can't borrow another dollar from your label
You can't sell another single in the streets? 
Statik Selektah lights a match, puts your shitty record on fire motherfucker!!!!
OK! I'M RELOADED!!!!
