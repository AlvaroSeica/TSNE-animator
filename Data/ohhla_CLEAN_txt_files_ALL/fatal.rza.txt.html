[Intro: Blade: Trinity sample (RZA)]
Blade... ready to die?
	I was born ready, muthafucka
(Yo, yo, yo)

[RZA]
It's the feast of the blood with sin, unleash the beast within
I walk around, with the strength, of a hundred men
You best to run before I count to ten
Blood drippin' from my canine, like a fountain pen
It seems I've been asleep for a thousand years
The way my world has change, it bring me a thousand tears
Prince of darkness, they walk through the rays of light
To this beat of empire, I'm the prototype
The shape shifting, mirror image, flash phototype
To everlast, an original red blood O type

 "He was born perfect, and just like the great white shark, this guy has never
had to evolve" - sample

[Hook 2X: sample]
Daywalker, daywalker
Daywalker, daywalker

[Chorus 2X: RZA]
Try to use my name, that's fatal
Tried to claim my fame, but that's fatal
About to bring the pain, that's fatal
Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal

[Hook 2X]

[Bridge 4.5X: RZA]
Come on, walk with me
Come on, walk with me

 "You're not evolving, I must of heard hundreds, and they all, made the same
saying
   Each one of them, in case of the needing of my sword" - sample

[RZA]
I strike back with a vengeance, the father, you're descendents
And I can't be deflected, by your silver cross pendants
Blood with holy water, you make the false images
One swing from the sickle, ahh, your life diminishes
Sting like the scorpion, strike with the force of kin
My blood is known to be vitalized with corpse of men
In the last days, they said the dead would walk again
The blind, deaf and the dumb will talk again

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus]
