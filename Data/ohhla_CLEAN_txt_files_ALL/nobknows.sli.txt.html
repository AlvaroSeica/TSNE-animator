Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Searchin' for the one who wants to make you
Something better than you could
Or maybe, one who wants to turn you
Into something that you should

And though it's easily assumed, you'll be taken
It's even easier to know you'll be waitin'
And like a waterfall, tears come from your eye
And well, you 'oughta know when your well runs, well runs dry

Ohh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
While you're waitin' and feelin' alone
Nobody knows why the love is all we need to hold on
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ohh, no, no, no, no, ohh

And said, you best not now keep movin'
Don't wanna be the one who's losin'
And if you think that I'm confusin'
What it is that we've been doin'?

I said, go on and give something better
To be going up for nothin'
Goin' up for nothin' would be better
If there's somethin'

Get a little lovin' from the woman
That me want it, tell me whatcha think
That I want get?

Wanna get up in the early mornin'
With the type of woman make a man feel right
Wontcha get her thinkin' that I'm down to be the one
Who's on your mind, until your well is runnin' dry

Ohh, no, no, no, no, no, no
While you're waitin' and feelin' alone
Nobody knows why the love is all we need to hold on
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ohh, no, no, no, no, ohh

No, no, no
While you're waitin' and feelin' alone
Nobody knows why the love is all we need to hold on
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ohh, no, no, no, no, ohh</pre>
