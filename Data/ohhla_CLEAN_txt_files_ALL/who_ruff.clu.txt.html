Grrrrrrr
From the dogz to the pups
Drag-On baby, Ruff Ryders, come on

[Drag-On]
Drag On baby, uh
Yo who them niggaz at the bar niggaz?
On them job niggaz
See y'all frontin mine niggaz
But drugz revolve niggaz
Y'all fake coke dealers slidin away wit soap niggaz
The size ain't right, y'all should be 300 hundered pounds on thin ice
Run in yo set, pullin yo gun from under yo desk
Snatch the weight from big niggaz doin a hundered a set
With the gun to y'all neck I'll have y'all niggaz runnin in sets
Under the bed, two to the chest and one to yo leg
Cocked it have one in the head and wanted by feds
Said they on the prowl for Drag and niggaz wanted him dead
That's what you get, gambling yo life wit a hundered to bet
Ace to the dues, now yo face has seen a hundered Gilletes
Niggaz think it's funny and shit, when chicks is suckin they dicks
Till they control you like Remotes, bustin buttons and shit
Y'all can't control me, all y'all can do is promote me women
And caught no shots, from my glock wit 16 in it, uh

[Chorus by: Drag-On and (DMX)] x2
Who them niggaz that's comin to take over? ( Ruff Ryders)
Whom them niggaz that's makin they moves? ( Ruff Ryders)
Who them niggaz that pay they dues? ( Ruff Ryders)
Who them nigaz that'll never lose? ( Ruff Ryders)

[Drag-On]
This lil nigga's too young to show the i.d.
But if y'all don't feel the hits now y'all gon feel it later like Ali
Y'all got respect? Not at all, but we do and got it all
Cause y'all know there's a lot of dogs that'll sell y'all for a lot of dough
Playboy, u sniff out, and pull out and leave em stiff out
Poke em wit somethin they couldnt get it out if they shitted out
Hercules thinkin he hurtin me, but they ain't hurtin shit
If only they could see behind curtains, they girl is jerking dick
And I might bust inside her then the next day say hello to you
Hopin that my nut ain't touch nuttin it wasnt supposed to
When you get up from the get go, nigga disapper like Presto
The cats is Pedro, since double R got the metro
They almost dead yo, niggaz wanted butted down
We throwin up the parties soon as they pat us down
? Woulda been more than music sounds
Coulda been round after round goin straight thru yo crown

[Chorus by: Drag-On and (DMX)] x2
Who them niggaz that's comin to take over? ( Ruff Ryders)
Whom them niggaz that's makin they moves? ( Ruff Ryders)
Who them niggaz that pay they dues? ( Ruff Ryders)
Who them nigaz that'll never lose? ( Ruff Ryders)

[Drag-On]
What's this I'm hearin niggaz sayin I ain't ready
What you tellin me? I been caught felony's y'all nigaz funny like Bill Bellamy
Fuck what you tellin me, I pull out gunz like niggaz pull out swords
In the old days, whan I spray I'm yellin, touche
Either you can stay and lay and this'll be yo last day
Or you can help me put my shit away and then you get away
And nigga clear the way, you blockin what I'm droppin
See the stocking? Dont let me pull the shit put that'll have you
Emptyin out yo pocket, stop it, Drag is you for real? Shit
And tell it like if y'all takin a lot of pills, now they pumpin yo stomach 
For the slugz from the semi, still fuckin wit me?
Y'all nigaz is little like a buck for a 20 and y'all niggaz is mad that 
Ruff Ryders Got me, cause all them bees you stick on me
Not one of em stung me
And by my dick y'all niggaz is gon wish, y'all hung me
Double 0 nigga and I'm hungry and I'm goin all out, cause y'all numb me
You feel this

[Chorus by: Drag-On and (DMX)] x2
Who them niggaz that's comin to take over? ( Ruff Ryders)
Whom them niggaz that's makin they moves? ( Ruff Ryders)
Who them niggaz that pay they dues? ( Ruff Ryders)
Who them niggaz that'll never lose? ( Ruff Ryders)</pre>
