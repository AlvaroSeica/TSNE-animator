[Intro]
Aw yeah! Hit the dancefloor! Get it in!

[Chorus]
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry 'cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause I'm good so what's goody 
On my boogie 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause really y'all feel me 
And I know that the game, don't, stop

[Verse One]
They ask me how my skin get so thick my tongue get so slick
And why I seem so nonchalant
They ask me if I wrote all my songs am I a phenom
And when the last time I hit a blunt
They ask if I'm in it for the loot, or am I the truth
And if so, who got the proof?
They ask me if my marriage is real do I have sex appeal
And if I drink Cognac or (?)
They ask me where did I come from all of a, sudden
Who don't know that I been here the whole time?
They ask me what I think about her and what I think about him
Who don't know I only think about mine
Steady askin me to comment on things that have no bearing
On my life and what keeps me inspired
Just another game they play folks are funny that way
More trickery to keep us dividied

[Chorus]
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry 'cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause I'm good so what's goody 
On my boogie 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause really y'all feel me 
And I know that the game, don't, stop

[Verse Two]
They ask if I'm friends with this one or friends with that one
and tell 'em all the places that I freak with
They ask if I stole from someone, if I own a gun
and if so, is my shot pretty decent?
They ask me if I ever sniff, coke, sip, Coke
or ever mix Coke, at all?
They ask if I'm a safe chick, a solve a case chick
or do I like to bury traps in the floor?
They askin if I low-ride or ever skydive
and how far would I go to the extreme
They ask if I chain smoke or ever came close
to coughin up, information on my team
Steady askin if I beat, charges or ever read, blogs
'cause in at what point would I plead the fifth?
Askin if I do dirt, if I'm a big flirt
What part of the game is this?

[Chorus]
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry 'cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause I'm good so what's goody 
On my boogie 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause really y'all feel me 
And I know that the game, don't, stop

[Verse Three]
Still askin if I cried when Mike died, took oath and then lied 
and where's the line between love and hate
They asked if I played cee-lo or if I hit below
the belt where my pride is at stake
They askin if I'm cold and edgy, right or lefty
and who really is my right-hand man?
Askin fio I hold grudges or follow hunches
and who security for all my Stans
They ask if I'm Giants or Jets, Yankees or Mets
Knicks or Nets, trash talk or place bets
If I'm commercial or jet, now or next
Raw dog or, safe sex
Steady askin if I play my cards or keep my guards WAY up
when the sharks start swimmin
But I don't tip my hand, I let it hit the fan
'Cause really it makes no difference

[Chorus]
It don't matter, I keep makin music makin money
Stayin hungry 'cause the game don't stop
And it don't matter you can hate me you can love me
Stayin hungry 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause I'm good so what's goody 
On my boogie 'cause I know that the game don't stop
See it don't matter 'cause really y'all feel me 
And I know that the game, don't, stop

[Outro]
It don't matter...Ha!!! Yeah!</pre>
