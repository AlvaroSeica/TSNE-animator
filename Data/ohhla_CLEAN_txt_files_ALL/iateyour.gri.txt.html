Song:   I Ate Your Soul
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You wanna talk about stress?
And the heart left hangin from a string like a necklace?
I'm the guy that you've been warned not to mess with
The farthest thing away from an emotional investment
Step back
Girl, you don't want this
Might look good in your head
But I'm a monster
Caused more tears than I can even account for
That drowns my soul face down when it showers
I wanna die like a rock star
All alone in my lost thoughts
Can't live how I wanna
And spoke no lies when I told you I'm a lost cause

[Bridge]
But still your gonna go and try
And show me a different life
And get eaten up alive
And say "I"

[Chorus]
I ate your soul..
"And I'll eat you up"
"Go hide for I eat to much"

I ate it whole..
"And this is what I do"
"Go hide girl I'm just like you"

I ate your soul..
"And I'll eat you up"
"Go hide for I eat to much"

I ate it whole..
"And this is what I do"
"Go hide girl I'm just like you"

You wanna talk about luck?
How no body loves you and your whole life's [?]
Girl, I was born to be crushed
And enjoy what it's like to be thrown in the mud
Go
And never come back
Stay where the sunshines and cover your tracks
I don't wait for the fun times and savor the laughs
I drop dead at good bye and lay straight in my casket
I wanna live where the blood dries
A lot quicker than some like
Without a smidgen of guilt
I'm a sit right here till the next woman comes bye

[Bridge]
But still your gonna go and try
And show me a different life
And get eaten up alive
And say "I"

[Chorus]
I ate your soul..
"And I'll eat you up"
"Go hide for I eat to much"

I ate it whole..
"And this is what I do"
"Go hide girl I'm just like you"

I ate your soul..
"And I'll eat you up"
"Go hide for I eat to much"

I ate it whole..
"And this is what I do"
"Go hide girl I'm just like you"</pre>
