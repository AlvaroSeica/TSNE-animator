Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Uh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
What's good, what's good?
It's all hood, it's all hood

[Juvenile]
I fuck with gangsters cause gangster be into real shit
I fuck with bitches but them hoes'll get you killed quick
Niggaz ain't surest 'bout they people but I love mine
Ain't feel that safe then get rid of your fuckin bloodline
And people say I got a swagger like a old man
That's only because I'ma live to be an old man
Yeah~! And I ain't mad if you hustlin
I'd rather see you with money than if you sufferin
I still remember shit we did when we was little kids
Said it was mob in the hood and nigga it still is
You my brother although you be on some other shit
Get it together won't let 'em know what the other is

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
They sleepin on me bet I'll make a nigga wake up
Test me, I bet a nigga get a A+
We countin money and you to' like Rambo
We poppin bottles like the Lakers and Orlando
I'm no extension cord, you tryin to find a plug?
You in the repo and you lookin for designer drugs
When you see me don't be scared to say where the cash at
I don't be lonely to homey so you can have that
I'll show you how to eat, if you don't wanna eat
We probably kick it but it's gon' be every other week
And I don't fuck with you, if you don't fuck with me
You talkin shit I don't wanna hear then take it up the street

[Chorus]

[Q Corvette]
Whassup cuz, I know I been out the scene wod'
But look I'm comin back with double stacks of green dough
It's all love, I'ma throw you down a couple grand
I'm not a man if I didn't give you a helping hand
This for my dogs that held me down through thick and thin
And for them 10 that {?} cakes, we are not friends
So when you see me don't holla nigga, you know whassup
Better catch a cut cause my conscience told me to beat you up
Northside rider mayne, don't associate with lames
Just cause I'm movin weight, niggaz thought that I had changed
Never change, remain the same, from my grandma to my chain
Real nigga in my veins, it's that gorilla gang

[Chorus]</pre>
