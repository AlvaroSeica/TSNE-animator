[Chris Brown]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Just a little too into you
That's for sure (ooh babe)
But your beauty, that is in me
Makes me forget about your faults
You do no wrong
Ooh woah ooh oh hoh oh

[Chorus One]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I got to, I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you, no lie
And girl I loose it every time

[Chorus Two]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby, stuck on you baby
And I might need help
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me

[Chris Brown]
It's confusing, how you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul, yeah baby
And I'll do anything for you
Ooh you know that much it's true
Girl I'm so in love, I'm stupid

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Chris Brown]
If you told me to go rock climbing
To prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying
Got everything to lose
I'm gon' try to play it cool
The stupid things I do, I do it for you

[Chorus Two]</pre>
