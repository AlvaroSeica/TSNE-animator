[Intro: Crystal, RC]
When you're welcome, just step on byyy
One day, one day, one day, one dayyy
I might be the one that makes cryyy

[Verse One: King Tee]
Ha ha, yeah, I'm sitting on throne
Dre and King Tee, they make their green hundred flown
Sipping the 'gnoc inside my hot Lo-Lo
Trying to get in the spot where players ball
Got a page from some booty, pressed, they sending me call
I've seen a.. tight lady Diva 
A cold milk complexion, mixed like the Margarita
With a crew of girls with Jungle Fever
Told Dre: I'ma meet them inside
So I jumped out my depth, slipped the essay attempt
Approach this chick to see what's happening
Her reaction was like..
She the biggest thing sins T. Jacksons "WHAT!!"
I froze, James Bond in sift mode
But y'all be knowing how it G rode
Cause it'll be on when the bar closed
?? those trying to hustle for a fame
Sipped some rim, then she tried to push off to her friends
That's why material girls, you can't treat them like queens
They be that Hollywood type, that like to make a scene

[Chorus: Crystal, RC]
It's the materical things that he's giving
That he's giving
How come you really say that you have to live it?
Ooohhh woohh, I'm the one that's giving 
Yeaahhh, boy I don't wanna hurt your feelings
Awwwww wooow yeaaahh, step on, step on, step on, step on by
See, what you need to do is step on by
Step on, step on, step on, step on by
Step on by!!

[Vese Two: Dr. Dre]
Camouflaged in the lounge of the club
I peeped the bar, honies got their little buzz
Trying to get plugged
Won't slip the way to adapt, to approach me asking
If a have a lady franking, she's from outta town pursuing acting
You knew the drama, her body have just uhh.. gave her.. 
the name Groupie so I played her like a movie Extra
Heard her pride like the Nutty Professor
She was cute but it's more than looks to get me seduced
Tried to get her with respect while she tried to get fly
Tripping getting loud, spilling drinks on Karl Kanis
Hold Up! I'm in a chilling, sipping wine and illing
Intellectual conversions; is talking plans of building 
Clean cut what, how does that sound?
A gentleman, plus his spiritual background; 
that's how I get down
Just think up of all these honies that be thinking corrupt
Before I can caught up and lust; I tell them all you best adjust

[Interlude: Crystal, RC]
Step on, step on, step on, step on byyy
You got to keep stepping, babyyy
Step on, step on, step on, step on byyy
Ought on byyy
Step on, step on, step on, step on byyy
You got to keep stepping on byyy
Step on, step on, step on, step on byyy
Yeaaaahhhhhhaaaahhhh!!!

[Verse Three: King Tee]
Pimp Daddy, Gangster stroll, drinks on me
Be so gold cause the game has been good to Tee
Ladies see the clout, now they wanna know what I'm about
Tailor suits, players won't even pull their petty cash out
The way players ball; we get the honies off the bar
And sort them to the dance floor
Like LB, I was sure the first one you tried to diss
You know the time, but never one slugged on the wrist
She clopped while the MoÃ«t popped, fake gritting all over her face
She had the lop of the top
But the player like Tee known she out loot
Had to take game and flip it, turn around with the digits
Thinking to myself when will they learn!
You swing your ass like a dog, every dog will take a turn
Looking at how she's trying to be fly
Cause the same thing that makes you laugh 
Will be the same thing that makes you cry

[Outro: Crystal, RC]
It's the materical things that he's giving
That he's giving
How come you really say that you have to live it?
Ooohhh woohh, I'm the one that's giving 
Yeaahhh, boy I don't wanna hurt your feelings
Awwwww wooow yeaaahh, step on, step on, step on, step on by
See, what you need to do is step on by
Step on, step on, step on, step on by
See, what you need to do is step on by
Step on, step on, step on, step on by
Can you feel this baby? ~ I believe it
I can truely see that I'ma have to live it, yeahh
?? had somebody somewhere, yeah, yeah, 
Somebody who truely needs me
Somebody who truely needs me
Don't be no foool, baby
The one you trust can make you cry
The one you trust can make you cry
So say bye bye, ohhh, bye
We gotta keep on moving and stepping on byyy!
Awwwowww, yeaaahhhh
We gotta keep on moving and stepping on byyy!</pre>
