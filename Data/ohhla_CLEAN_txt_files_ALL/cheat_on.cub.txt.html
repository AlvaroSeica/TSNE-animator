Yea, and anotha one 
Big Pun baby, Big Pun baby

[Chorus 1 - Tony Sunshine]
Cheat on her
If shes gonna cheat on you
A lil crushing, at a hot lil spot
At a rendevouz
Cheat on her
If shes gonna cheat on you
Cuz shes gettin nasty wit ya best friend Nate
Or ya brother too

[Verse 1 - Cuban Link]
Aiyo excuses excuses 
I'm sick of this bullshit its useless
You're ruthless, you accused of me cheatin
But wat you proved miss?
The truth is, you keep flippin too much of those loose lips
Is it because I got the chicks feelin my music
If the shoe fits, wear it
Yo you be thinkin I'm stupid
Actin like you dont do shit, I studied ya movements
And uve been too slick since they first introduced us
Ya used to be in every dance club in the U.S.
You should think before you speak
Tryin to blame it all on me
Eager to beat so you could leave and have a cheap excuse to cheat
See I kno the game baby, You been actin strange lately
A lil deranged you changed you aint the same lady
Playin me shady claimin that I'm runnin trains daily
Sayin you hate me maybe its the fame thats makin you crazy
Maybe its me and jus the way that I see it
Better believe it, if I never got caught I never cheated
Keep it real even the sweetest girls be cheatin at will
Then you see em chillin like you and dont be feelin no guilt
Willin to deal wit it givin you dat devious grill
Cuz she feels you did it so shes gettin even to heal 
I know da deal 

[Chorus 2]
Cheat on her 
If shes gonna cheat on you
She lookin kinda classy
But you find her at ya house, comment talez vouz
Cheat on her
If shes gonna cheat on you
She sumthin nasty
Wit the whole Terror Squad foundation boo

[Verse 2 - Big Pun]
Thought I was livin low key
Official pimp daddy ol' G
My whole steez was drinkin, hittin, and throwin trees
But don't sleep a freak aint always a mack
Then I found out my lil sweet was blowin out backs
She was lonely in track, started sippin Bacardi
Met sum pimp at a party, now she strippin at Ardy's
Pop the whip on a Harley
Mad kickin the body, finally slipped at a hottie
Gripped the politic at menagie
Party round more trains at a third world
Fuck its ver-hell, Mind you this used to be a church concert
Wit sum words filled, jus knowin I'm responsible
When I sleep all I see is Mandingo throwin and King-Kongin' you
Can't rest, its like I'm x-ed for life
How much respect should be spendin niggas know he sexin ya wife
Professional advice, ignore the whores and the hooters
Jus brains that are hard, very much more than a bruiser
More than a loser, cuz I lost love in the fast lane
Next time I'll think twice before I give away my last name
Its mad strain, mad strife mad stressful but its a man's game
Aiyo why you be mad?

[Tony Sunshine]
I'm sorry is all that I can say
I cheated, I pleaded
I'm sorry 

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Shes gonna find out one day
It's done for life
Ooooooo, oh ohhhhh</pre>
