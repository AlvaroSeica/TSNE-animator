Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real sh** (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby (M-J-B)

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)
Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up? (Wooh!)
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby yeahhhh

See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what) (yeaheh!)
Good or bad (thick and thin) (stat quo! mary J!)
Right or wrong (all day everyday) (old classic baby!)

When we met
I knew you was the one for me
Even though when we was young
People could see we was destined to be special
Then you agreed (yes)
Will you ride for me? (yes)
Never lie tah' me? (yes)
Stay by my side through thick and thin in any robbery? (yes)
How sick that you was so I doin' this thing right back
Anythin' and everythin' you need I will provide that
A-ccepting the facts (facts)
I will never slack (slack)
Or be with not you in my life (Look him right in his eyes and tell him we've been...)
I need you where I'm at now mary sing that (yeaheh!)

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
