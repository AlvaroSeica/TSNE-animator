[Interview]
"What were some of the things you learned, or focused on to get, to get through to get by?"

"Just this id-this insane belief in my own ability to manifest things
Insane belief, you know that I think that it's ultimately complete sanity
But I believe that we are creators and I believe that we create with every thought, and every word is..
Every moment is pregnant with the next move your life

[Eso]
New outlook new angle new view new channel
I surf the frontier with extra focus
My minds third eye reflects the opus
I see you, you see me
That's one love, let's be free
Then paint the town red as roses
Sky high until the heavens open
I bleed for it, I cry for it
I'm free falling, my minds orbit
Chase that dream but your never gonna get it so I live that dream 24/7
I'm out there trying to kiss that sun
Reminiscing how kids have fun
Timeless, better watch this shit
And find us were the clocks don't tick

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

[Bliss]
He sails and rides the tide
With a dream inside his mind
Blood orange moon illuminates the room
From a dark blue hue to a fiery sky
See the heights that he hovers
What a flight what a life full of wonder
Like when somehow those stars lined up
And he made the winning shot dropped right at the buzzer
He can do it because he knows the mission
He can paint the picture
He can hold the vision
He's in pole position with sonar thinking
He can hit those goals like a homing pigeon
So on a ship from the maritime
He makes it lift like a paraglide
And he soars to the heavens
Watching his whole world flip and shift for the paradigm

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

[Interview]
"I think people need to believe in stuff
And I think you need to believe you're involved in something here
Believe this whole things your imagination. You know?"

"Like you're in charge. I gotta live my life that way."

[Eso]
Yo, Remember those games we use to play?
Like you get one wish and you choose your fate?
Or a magic power you could have for hours
That's what I want to do today
Which made me begin to start
Thinking Heaven is within the heart
But we'll miss it, trying to grip the stars
To die rich and fast

[Bliss]
He's learnt lessons kept in his tail
Felt like they were etched into brail
He hammers anything yet to be nailed
Any mountain any wall that's yet to be scaled
There he goes set to his trail
He won't stop till the breath in him fails
In a boat that he built with the world and his hands
Space riding on destiny's sails

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

[Interview]
"So you just gotta keep going and look at this as a wonder, look at it as a trip
You Know. Just go on this trip and just look at all this stuff. It's fantastic
You're actually here and you got a dream. You got to look at the dream as the actual thing."

"That's the fun part"

"And look at this time as a time where you're really, really having fun."</pre>
