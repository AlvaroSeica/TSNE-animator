[Intro: KRS-One]
Y'know every now and then you
You gotta think about where you goin in life
and how you gon' get there
Sometimes the people around you just stagnatin
Waitin, procrastinatin, hatin
You gotta get away
I come to take you, c'mon!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta get away, and I'ma show you how
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta get away (get away) to a better day (better day)

[KRS-One]
It's time for you to leave
It's time for you to be what you believe
It's time for you to get up and achieve
It's time for you to ease, right into position
to receive, those higher degree philosophy
You don't wanna sell ki's, have your wrist on freeze
Bangin beats and fly rhymes, man sell me
So please, I'll give you some space so you can believe
that you can receive what you perceive, you gotta leave
You gotta leave old friends and enemies
and people tryin hard to deceive - me kyan't believe
People steady snitchin to the D's
Rattin each other out for fee
All you can say is CHEESE~!
No mercies, just Mercedes
And young ladies havin babies, this is crazy
So leave (leave) follow the Bahama breeze
You deserve a break fo'sheez - let's go

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
Anyway, many say hey, get that money man
But I don't know without peace, no it ain't sunny man
I seek peace, eat peace, even teach peace
Fight for peace, write for peace, smite the beast
for peace, love unity havin fun
Freedom, equality, hip-hop culture we are one, let's run
Off the plantation, off that man's station
Off they satellites and they corporations
Why you waitin? Hesitatin, procrastinatin, stagnatin
Let's change the situation
Tonight! Break the chains and follow me
It's time that you really be free, c'mon!!

[Chorus] - 1.5X</pre>
