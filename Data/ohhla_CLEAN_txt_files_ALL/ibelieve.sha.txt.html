[Intro]
I don't know what you came to do
I don't know what you came to do
I don't know what you came to do
I don't know what you came to do

[Verse 1]
'Cause you see me walking with a crew
I rock a couple jewels, might just hold the tool
spit a few bars, probably act the fool
run up in the bar please don't get confused
Don't think I don't got a clue
I dealt with hard times but God pulled me through
You don't know me, but you swear that you know me
'cause you hear when I'm flowing on the air and I'm blowing but
some of y'all live in fear, if you wanna get to Heaven well then let me take you there
be clear, if you only going to the service
just because you nervous when you die you'll end up burnin'
so you go to church and start praying hard on purpose
puttin' in the work, I can see you trying to earn you
a trip to the gates, kids can't relate, they don't understand it
the only ten commandments they know is Biggie's
but it ain't no biggie I'll see 'em through hallelujah if you with me
look I don't know what you came to do
I don't know what you came to do
I came to say his name in vein
stake my claim change this game
let me hear the congregation say

[Chorus 2X]
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in
I believe in, I believe in, Him, in Him, in Him, in Him

[Verse 2]
I know you think I don't but I do
I know you think I don't but I do.
I feel like I grew, every Sunday morning where are you?
People think prayer only works in church pews
Some folks up early in disguise, rocking shirts and ties
standing online waiting outside, just to testify
then they get inside giving offerings and tithes
My man said he's tired of hearing the pastor lie
so he stays home, he rolls it and pass the la
to his other homies they smoke it and they get high
and I would love to judge 'em but honestly who am I?
I ain't one to chastise
More than just a rap guy, never been baptized
But I write scriptures, my life has been hard every year
It's getting easy believing that God's everywhere

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I ain't gon' drink no more
I ain't gon' smoke no more
I'mma be strong
I ain't gon' bone no whores
I'mma work hard oh Lord, help me hold on
I will not rob, I will not steal
I'mma be kind, imma be real.
I will not covet anybody else's wife
I will not take another person's life
I ain't selling no drugs, I will not be a thug
that's what everybody says on the day after the club
I don't know about you, (I don't know about you)
I don't know what you do, (I don't know what you do)
I got church in my heart, I don't need no religion
I ain't dissin' ya decision
I'm just saying at the ending
When its over and its finish
There's no denomination that is winning only God can judge me
