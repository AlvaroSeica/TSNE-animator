{Chorus}
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You dont wont to fuck around nigga wit my regiment
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You fuck around wit us its going to be some turbulence 
I told you that TSO was cased in cement 
You dont wont to fuck around nigga wit my regiment
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You fuck around wit us its going to be some turbulence

{Hollowway}

It started with pistols and niggas
Now it be killaz on triggas
Aimed for platinum plated figgas 
Living lavish like drug dealers
TSO plug niggas
Im surrounded by blood spillas
Motherfuckers about scrilla 
Giving nothing but love nigga
In this land of troubled souls
All for one how we roll
We put our luchini over hoes 
Cause nigga thats how it goes
I go to war for you PARTNA ! 
Off that 40 and vodka 
Face the reaper with a choppa
Even die if I gotta

{Valario}

Bets to respect the flame 
TSO niggas wrapped up in the game
Fronted by camp but brought together by pain
A team of troubled souls 
Taking the yayo 
And weighing it 8000 grams going to my FAMILY ! 
Aint no limit to the moves that I make 
To the rules that I break
Slanging cake just to make it a shake 
Now playahate 
Its the Commission and Skull 
And we gon ball till we fall
We outlaws 
Shooting for the stars
Now feel me

{Chorus}
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You dont wont to fuck around nigga wit my regiment
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You fuck around wit us its going to be some turbulence 
I told you that TSO was cased in cement 
You dont wont to fuck around nigga wit my regiment
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You fuck around wit us its going to be some turbulence

{Spade}

Check the tattoo Bitch
That means pistols galore
The youngest nigga out the click empty his clip at yo door
Im down to ride on a hoe
Left the club with calicos 
Red dots and pistols pop and choppas chopping fa sho
Im off the HeeZays believe me
Spade aint no joke
They pray for me to take it easy but Im going for broke
Im hollerin SPRIRAL ! 
Leave them bitches high low 
At my side door 
where ever I go
Nigga that Vi-Low

{Skull Duggery}

Pick up the pace
Get me the money up out the safe
Killing off simply so I dont have to spray the place
TSO you remember me from about 1983
When I pulled off my first armed robbery 
It was Emory 
Resurrected to Skull Duggery
Til I got caught the judge sentenced me 
Now check this to 7 years 6 months 14 hours 19 minutes and 3 seconds
They couldnt stop me no matter how hard they would try
You feel me it was do or die 
I didnt know if the Lord or devil was on my side
Sometimes I had to look I (took a picture)
So I took a trip to Texas got me a hit of heroin 
Niggaz rollies travels got me beyond 
&gt;From the thought 
Do I have heart
I ask myself these questions I have to start 
So I stay to myself cause Im a forced to be reckoned with 
Living around all this bullshit in the darkness its so hopeless
But check do my life have a spritual meaning to Im dead and gone
&gt;From this life and this fucking shit beyond 
But check it the police trying to catch me
For some bullshit TSO trying to wet this nigga T up behind my head
Feel me ultimately I know my regiment respect me 
I respect my regiment cause they down wit me 
Forever G 
Check it TSO replaced in cement 
Niggaz know this
You fuck around you gone be having yo grave plotted 
You dig ?

{Chorus}
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You dont wont to fuck around nigga wit my regiment
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You fuck around wit us its going to be some turbulence 
I told you that TSO was cased in cement 
You dont wont to fuck around nigga wit my regiment
I told you that TSO was cased in cement
You fuck around wit us its going to be some TURBULENCE !</pre>
