[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Haha, Luda! (get-get-get)

'Cause I be at like subpoenas when the court serves
Give me, give me love like Serena when the court serves (woo!)
'Cause she don't know that she got me wanna get frisky

And so I order more bottles of that good stuff (yeah)
It's Ludacris, women call me Mr. Good Stuff (yeah)
So I'm a take her to the rooftop, rooftop
Girl's so cold I need a flu shot, flu shot
She said she want me to take her to the shoe shop, shoe shop
And I told her +Keep Her Head Up+, Tupac, Tupac

[Verse 2 - Usher]
Girl I'm gonna make this dilemma the best way that I know how ...
'Cause your killin me with it, your just a problem that I can't put down (down ...)
'Cause every time (every time), you get too far away (too, too, too)
She can tell I got something missing it be all up in my face, yeah

[Break - Usher]
Oh! (oh!)
Oh
Ohhhhh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause she don't know

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
