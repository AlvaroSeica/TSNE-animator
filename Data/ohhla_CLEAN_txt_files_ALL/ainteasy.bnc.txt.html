[FO' CLIPS]
Crippin' ain't easy - in the city
(Crippin' - in the city)
But it's fun, yeah
(It's fun - It's fun)
Crippin' ain't easy - in the city
(Crippin' - in the city)
But it's fun, yeah
(But it's fun)

Check it out

[DO OR DIE]
Do or Die is the name of the nigga who be dreamin'
Uh, of killin' Slobs and listen to 'em screamin'
Or see him dyin' on their front yard
I kept this Slob bendin' a corner
I'm shootin' up his fuckin' car
Or catchin' him slippin' at his own tip
I shoot the muthafucka up
To make sure his cap is peeled (right)
And shoot his friends at the funeral
It's do or die muthafucka
It's all about survival
A khakis down fo' life G
And I'm killin' him
Cause he's tryin' to kill me (ooh yeah)
So I creep to kill a Snoop (right)
Fill his ass full of lead and have you troll him like a hoola-hoop (damn!)
And leave him dying when I'm done
Cause crippin' ain't easy
But it's damn sure fun

[FO' CLIPS]
Crippin' ain't easy - in the city
(Crippin' ain't easy)
But it's fun, yeah
(But it's fun, ye-ye-yeah)

[BLUE RAG]
I'm loc'd to the fullest like a goddamn nutcase
With two fresh blue rags tied on my face
Fruitfully thinking with my gangsta mentality
To bringin' this Crip shit from the streets to reality
They call me the big
Bad-ass Blue Rag who sag
And carry a 4-4 mag
Cause it's a fee, a fi, a fo, a fum
I smell a Slob
So now it's time I kill me one
Or two or three
Them C from the scene G
On my way to hook up with B-K

[B-K]
B-K Slob killa straight mafia
And hollow point is in the gat that's what I got for ya
When I pull the trigger
And straight blast it
Shootin' your ass and gettin' you ready for the casket (ooh yeah)
I'm killin' Snoops in a worst way (ooh yeah)
I got my B.K.-47
And it's B.K. allday
So when I'm rollin' in the G-Ride
Committin' homicide (yeah)
1-8-7 ride-by
And if I'm off to another hood dippin' and crippin'
Set trippin'
Bound to catch a Slob slippin' (CaRIPS!!!)*
(*CAlifornia Revolutionary Independent Pistol Slinger* )
Gun him down like a hunter cause it's Slob season
Don't ask why
They crippin', see the reason

[FO' CLIPS]
Crippin' ain't easy - in the city
(Crippin' - it ain't easy)
But it's fun, yeah
(But it's fun, ye-ye-ye-yeah)
Crippin' ain't easy - in the city
(Crippin' it ain't easy in the city)
But it's fun, yeah
(But it's fun, but it's fun, yeah)

[SIN]
Sayin' ain't no muthafuckin' buddy friend
So if you come to the grave I push your muthafuckin' ass in there
You can't run from the hellrazor
And if you fuck with the blue team we damn sure got to fade ya
Just like we fade them muthafuckin' [censored]
It's time to put the pigs away and let 'em C-C's out to box
And let the Sin known cause fool this is Compton
East Side killa knows that's always mobbin' up fools
Deuce Five Deuce with a district
A G born in Compton if your monkey ass is listenin'
Somebody shoulda taught you from the old school
Like them mark-ass Niggas With Attitude
But we fuck 'em
Cause they don't mean shit anyway
And where I'm from
You'll make them muthafuckas look fake
Straight balling on them thangs in the gangsta lean
One down ass Crip straight bustin'
And won't hesitate to peel a cap
But I'd rather make snaps, bust raps than to bust caps (yeah that's right)
Cause it's all about survival (yeah)
And rather you slangin', hangin' or bangin'
Your life is just as short as vital side (oh yeah)
I'm mentally depressin'
Listen to the Crip and learn a quick brief, listen up
