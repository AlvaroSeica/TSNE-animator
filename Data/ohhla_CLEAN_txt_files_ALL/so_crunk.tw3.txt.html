Full ah this anger, best to beware ah this danger
I strangle your brain-a in the middle of a tanker
Smother you suckas you hater type bustas
Don't trust ya this crazy type killer constructure I touch ya,
You won't ever touch when I pop my glock 9 and these bullets start bustin'
And I must, throw you rap clowns in the dust
This is it that I spit out my mouth I disgust you
What's up wid you trick?
Ain't no love for this monster, stomp ya,
Chuck ya in the trunk or my dungeon
Body parts layin' everywhere by my spear
Just don't care cause I'ma family type killer
So what you never heard ah me
Bloody murder in the first degree
A rapid type ah killin' spree
I'm prostylin' wildin' on tracks
It's like, ?mixin' the song wid muscle dude?
Wid the message to make a killer get stash fast
If you act when you rappin' on stage ain't nobody buckwild
bust the crowd just don't fail your performance
You wack when you real escalate and you fake dealin'
Paid thirty diamonds on ya wrist ya little joke,
I smoke, lil sumthin' sumthin' wid ya hoe,
Hit the liquor store and then I mix up a soda
Hit the club spot where my niggas straight low-a
Tatted up thugs about to let the rage blow up
I'm burstin' you up you surrounded by thugs
In the back of the club we so buck ain't no remedy
Shoot out and loose out my click out on you
til the tumors inside ah my brain catch my enemy
Pain is the penalty, slain in my enemies
Hold up feel it swoll up, got it all up, got it sold up
DJ's gone on the phone that my niggas and bitches must let this buck buck

[Verse 3]
So pop wid this murder, straight to the devil a nigga must turn-a
Torture his corpse and it's what you must earn
These shells gonna burn through your scalp like a perm
So you niggas must learn not to fuck wid this killer
Eyes turn green as I'm fiendin' for skeltah
Decapitated body parts all that was left
Bloody toes on the floor wid his heart on my shelf
Don't decides to ride, you bustas can't hide
Wipe the fear from ya eyes feel lives real lives, and it shows how to die,
Shouldn'ta been a playa hatin' motherfucka at your mouth
Rip your tongue out your throat make your tonsils hop out
Blood all over the floor now gunshells in your hoe
Twenty niggas at the door, scopin' out for po-pos
Any nigga step close, blast his ass out them clothes
Pack his ass by skin to the end of the coast
See my mind is so sick it would kill and I'm losin'
Confusion, a fusion, nothin' but psychotic illusions
I'm usin', the Lucifer's satanic music
This killa so serious ain't a damn thing amusin' it's useless,
When I get the glock and start shootin'
Drag his ass in a body bag then we scoop him
Dump him in a river watch his body start soupin'
Sayin' to myself this punk nigga so stupid
Choke off his hoe in three pieces like Cupid
Blaze off her face burn her mucus and pupils
Killin' off all enemies is the way that I'm choosin'
Leave 'em concussions and rupturous bruisin'
Bloodstains all over my clothes and my shoes
Look at ya struggle by the ounce and ya oozin'
All rated pulses is what you be losin'
When you fuckin' wid a nigga wid a head wid no screws in it
