[Intro: Timbo King]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Lil' Malik)
(Yeah, yeah)
Brook-Brook-Brook-Brooklyn
Brook-Brook-Brook-Brooklyn
Brook-Brook-Brook-Brooklyn
(Yo Mailk, yeah yeah, do it)

[Timbo King]
Go 'head and flip it, get ya whole team evaporated
Bitches on my dick, hoes be infatuated
The Don King, I promote the violence
Yeah, from Fort Green, PJ's of Vanderveer
The whole Fam's in here, drinkin' on Belvedere
With ice on that's bright as a chandeleer
You I'm used to, hangin' with boosters
Them cluck chickenheads bitches who fuck with roosters
We bang bang, who cares what set you claim?
Brooklyn be the borough, I rep the name
So forget the fame, yeah I spit the flames
We want the money and the guns, the rest is lame
For the skrilla my killas will lay you down
We don't play around when we spray around
That Mac-1-1, get back son-son
I clap him and him, this is Timb and 'em
And I ain't talkin' 'bout motherfuckin' Timbaland
And I ain't talkin' 'bout motherfuckin' Timbaland

[Sharecka]
Aiyo I'm hotter than hot
Don't test mine, silent killa like carbon monoxide
Reppin' the block, holdin' the glock high
It's my time to shine, no Diddy reppin' the city
Got a thousand niggaz to roll with me
Pity the fool, get on my panic, got many tools
Rapper plus the janitor, got ki's too
You see through like glass, a nigga got no class
Jump over the bar, and beat the bartender's ass
I ain't playin'
If my record ain't playin' I ain't playin'
Somebody be laid up up in the grave, I ain't playin'
I'm sayin' you hot, nigga you chat too long
Talkin' 'bout ballin', you referrin' to basketball
Niggaz be hittin' skins, but you jackin' off
Thought we just rhyme, nigga? Take the jacket off!
That be all, the last time I be askin' y'all
Next time on your head, better back on far

[Timbo King]
My pop's spinnin' 45, I'm at the age of six
Back then when Larry Bird was playin' the Knicks
You don't want that big .45 to spit out six
Hit the number and the Bo lead to 4-5-6
Niggaz only gettin' a 4-5-6 split
Bagged the chick on 45th and 6th Ave
She was shoppin', had four, five, six bags
I'm in the Q45 with the sixth staff
Time was 4:56 on my wrist flat
Throw 4-5-6 and get cash
B.V.I., quarto-cinco-sietas
My nigga...

[Outro: Timbo King]
Yeah... B.V.I., 56
Yeah, Gutter, P-City
Self Rachet, Bo King
Young Brook, Icepick
Yeah... </pre>
