[Lee 'Scratch' Perry]
Yahhh! Make device signal more clear
Ya? Clear more clear
Jungle jungle!! Merlin.. Production Company
Black Ark International Branch.. present

Coughin goin around
Have you seen Mister Brown?
Coughin goin around goin around the town
Have you seen Mister Brown?

Whisperin voices! Whisperin voices!
Whisperin voices (have you seen Mister Brown?)
Dem who want full control, always lose control
Dem who want everything always lose everything

Coughin goin around
Have you seen Mister Brown in town?
(Have you seen Mister Brown?)

Dem who want total control, always lose control
Some always lose their soul, for silver and gold
Silver and gold are by none
But in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Rise up and walk, rise up and walk
Rise up and walk, rise up and walk

A reapin time.. weepin time and a reapin time
Weepin time and creepin time
Reap what you sowwwwww
Rockin comin from the weepin mind
And all that I reap is mine
So you can not reap what is mine
Sayyyyy {*echoes*}

But in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Black ganja cigarette
Kanji weed and ganja marijuana lung's breath
Rise up and walk
Rise up and clap
Rise up in hemp
Rise up and lift up your cap
Lift up your cap
And rise up in hemp
Do the thunder clap
Great ball of fire 'pon the sky

And reap your time
Weep your mind
Weepin time reapin time
Garvest harvest time
You reap what you sow I reap what I sow

Coughin going around
Gve you seen Mister Clown?
He used to call himself Mister Brown
(And king sat down)
Him no longer miss the town
He not know that I miss the crown and missed the ground
What's comin up from under ground
will weep in time

I and I, I fed up with chants
that takes over France
With voodoo dance.. and science arts
Science machine and science dream
This is a living dream, from the Beastly Brothers
And the Beastly Boys
With their Beastly toys
To give you some Beastly joys
So put on your Beastly drawers
And show me a Beastly pose
Hehehehehehe!

We intend to do another version</pre>
