[Insight]
The sun has risen, as it glistens
through the trees like a prism
I listen to the earth's rhythm
the wind speaks to my instinct
with the earth I'm in sync
sharpening the blade of a spear
with the heart of a lion
in combat, though I'm real slick
the salt in the water help my scars heal quick
cause see I mastered survival tactics
and lasted weeks without sleep
hunting for prey and while he rap its

(Mr. Lif)
(rather primitive) Who's that?
(I'm stats, DATs, money stacks, tax) Which language is that?
(identity with a little tyranny)
But I don't need chaos, I have peace and serenity
(you won't find hell in me
see psychoanalysts for therapy
come prosper and live plentily)
my existence is heavenly
(you were meant to be greater)
allow me to pray to my creator
(nigga you are the maker, life giver and taker
take control, you should feel safer)
but I don't even feel threatened
(you need weapons and apparently a classroom so you can learn lessons)

[scratching] "don't let them fool ya"
[scratching] "I'm here to school ya"
[scratching] "you need knowledge?"
[scratching] "open your eyes"

your terminal is senseless
(I'm rational and actual, here
let me send a fax to you)
but what is a fax?
(ahh, curiosity killed the cats's
swimming pool and mattress, bust a book of matches
credit cards and debit cards)
checks, cars, incredible odds, devil gods, laws
federal generals headed for Mars with medical cards
fixing Mother Nature's technical flaws
(hmm, you learn quickly, now you're with me
move foward and never look back in history
focus on your omnipotence, teach your infants this
kiss the barcode on your wrist)
"kiss" all six senses are on point
(telekinetics?) naw, I didn't forget it
utilizing earth, I can mold dirt into flesh, summoning
sandstorms, on the highest mountain I stand on
I make the sky cry fire rock then ice will drop
its wind spin, your spirit and soul ascends then
(now you can blend in, lets hit the city streets
so we can get your feet accustomed to concrete
build a strong fleet of soldiers
tell them what I told ya
we'll chill on the moon when we're older
and thank God that this Earth life is over
devour the sun and make the universe colder)
extol the master, spinning planets around my aura
like an orbit, set a mountain on shore twist my fingers
and force this into a tornado, raw fatal
I make grain flow, draining clouds into a rainbow
I master math, infused bionics with biology
police carry shotguns inside a robotic knee
the impact of my psychology can atomically wipe out
and devastate as soon as I meditate
(so why don't you demonstrate?) I think that I might
drop a bomb on Nagasaki just because it's in sight
(you've arrived) leave the world (brutalize) sacrifice
(human lives) take flight (to fight) attack tribes
(this will be the legacy of you and I)
who's you? it's just I
ALL OPPOSITION MUST DIE!!!</pre>
