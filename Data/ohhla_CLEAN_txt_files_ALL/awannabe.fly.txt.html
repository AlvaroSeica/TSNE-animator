Chorus (A group of people):

Fuck a wanna be BITCH
Playa Fly you remember to say hello to your great Granny
Fuck, fuck a wanna be BITCH
Playa Fly you remember to say hello to your great Granny
Fuck a wanna be BITCH

(Playa Fly)
It be lizamin' [lamer] than what'cha claimin' you lames ain't spookin' me
I'm choosin' to stand alone on my own, me and B.A.B.
And backed up by Billy C, H, and I to the double L
And brothers like Mark and Tally whose minds haven't slipped and fell
By placin' me on the scale, and weighin' me by the P
You will see that I'm full of P to the T ain't no G in me
A fella from S.P.V., Fly for fuckin' a wanna be
I.B.N. who you fuckin' with, so your shit in it I will be
I'm packin', attackin', meanwhile those bosses be mackin'
And Mister Crim lookin' grim, from the way you wanna bes actin'
Intelligence you be lackin', not a lizick [lick] of common sense
Super duper and neutral and to the future and past tense
Lil' Flizy ain't hookin', Fly ain't smokin' or none of that
Even though you be lookin' and placin' jackins upon my back
I keep my pimpin' intact and lay my facts upon the table
And fuck a wanna be who live in violatin' labels bitch

Chorus

(Playa Fly)
Now that Fly got your attention, mane sit and listen to what I say
I mention a situation we facin' in everyday
The shit that I start to see, it just don't agree with me
Imitatin' a person that play the shit well that's new to me
The bottom a Playa be, I'm found on a higher ground
The sound I be puttin' down, a playa make words around
I'm sportin' a sippin' crown clown, peep the five or six
Seven where I'm dwellin', so from heaven fillin' up to this
On my way past number nine, higher than a Funkytown
What you thinkin' I thought it and now you ballin' without a dime
Your mind is all in a bind, you're blizind [blind] leading the blind
Overdose of this Holy dope that I blow will leave you behind
So go catch up with your kind, cuz my kind don't wanna be
playa hated, associated by bustas who envy me
The B double O, N, E, man you peep?  They be under you
I, B, N, they be in the house, I know that you want it too

Chorus

(Playa Fly)
Many suckas be flockin', bigger bustas be mockin'
Ask me why when I'm high, your mega shit I be stompin'
Start you bustas to rockin', cuz I'm bumpin' what's in me
Ain't no flockin' or fakin' or devil tradin', just pimpin'
I be spittin' to bitches and other niggas who itchin'
For this here Playa Fly dissin', hoe on your ear you will listen
So now you will nizzow [know] about these lyrics I flizow [flow]
When all the P let me gizow [go], so Fly can fire up this hizzow [hoe]
B, A, B what you see?

(Bab)
Alot of nothin' but wanna bes
Claimin' titles and I know they disrespectin' authority

(Playa Fly)
Want a bitch they ignorin' you from the way they adorin' Fly
Many suckas who knowin' me claim they flowin' it makes me cry
You try me if you wanna try, but Lil' Fly will never lose
Have you cussin', and fussin', all in the dust and singin' the blues
Bill Chill only real with you, Allah who we rollin' with
And Bone, and Will Chill, Carlos P., FUCK A WANNA BE BITCH
