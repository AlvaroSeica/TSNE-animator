Verse One:
Looking back through time
from teh corners of my mind
I see you standing there
And baby how I miss you
and how much I need to kiss you
run my fingers through your hair

Chorus:	But then again it's just my imagination
		being close to you was such a sweet sensation
		Then  we had to have that terrible confrontation
		And now all I can do to help this situation
		Day dreamin' takes me where I want to be 
		Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me

Verse Two:
Girl if you know all that I'v been going through
you'd have a change of heart
But come rain or shine
you're foerver on my mind
in my life-you're a part


Chorus:	But then again it's just my imagination
		being close to you was such a sweet sensation
		Then  we had to have that terrible confrontation
		And now all I can do to help this situation
		Day dreamin' takes me where I want to be 
		Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me

Verse Three:
Love what's yo cum? 
We on gin and marijuana
Mega the author pushin' upon on ya
Keepin' ya fonder, this All City sage minus the drama
sex often sweaty in suana
It's how I do mines
you got a fetish for niggas with legal letters who smoothin' out the edges 
and keepin' ya box the wettest
You see it's Medina child
plus the Bed Stuy style with crazy know how
So love how you gonna stop us now?
Just consider this for your cliteruos
Mega serious, bound to get you open and delerious
I'm buyin shit
I'm not a playa, I'm a slaya
Looked her up and down (and said hhmmm...)  
I take her to the mack lo
where we can pack slow
I rub your back slow but that go quickly according to how act yo 
Intentionally you're enterin' 'Nique once the idol
All City all stuck up in your memory

You know I want you girl
You know I need you girl
Come back come back baby take a ride in my Mercedes Benz
You know I need you girl 
Cuz you're my only world 
come back come back honey
and I'll give you all my money


Chorus X 2:Day dreamin' takes me where I want to be
			Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me</pre>
