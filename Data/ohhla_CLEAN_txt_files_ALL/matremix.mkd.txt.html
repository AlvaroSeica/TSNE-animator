[Hook]

Get your motherfucking hands up uh-huh
Superstar (superstar)
Say hoodrat (hoodrat)
Superstar (superstar) where you at Po-Din'

[Big Pokey]
I need a bad bitch, bad hoe
Go hard with a nigga, in the middle the flo'
Ain't complaining, bout her needs so
Ain't gon leave, till her jeans to'
Five foot four, dark and thick
Call her bitch, cause she bark at dick
When I'm finished with her, then my boy can hit
If not, next time I'ma dodge the chick
I don't, play with hoes
I run through broads, like a change of clothes
Dress in a fo', top of the line
If you hear my head board, then I'm knocking her down
Might hit it from the back, I'ma pop up behind
Make her sound off, like a shot from the nine
A pick on the middle, get her hot as a iron
And she say I wouldn't know her, I stop her from lying

[Hook]
Say hoodrat (hoodrat)
Superstar (superstar) - 2x
Get your motherfucking hands up

[Mike D]
It's on, and you know that it's on
Corleone back home, bout to play in your thong
And I done knocked off me, a Bentley Anage
So I can hit you and your friend, in the back of my car
Give me a head shot, let me see you work some'ing
If your girlfriend with ya, then go on and get a double
I'm on E and bout to bubble, and y'all in trouble
I'm on hard on some'ing, ready to fuck some'ing
I'm a G, and I give it to you like that there
When I skeet swallow ma, yeah I like that there
Corle' a mess I swear, but you ain't seen nothing  yet
I'm trying to get slowed deck, while I ride in the Lex
Throw a hex on the dick, like she sick with it
She go to gobble and swallow it, and ain't even spitting with it
I'm the hottest thing out chea', running the game
Love a model chick, but dog I keep a hoodrat woman

[Hook]

It's on, and you know that it's on
Corleone back home, bout to play in your thong
And I done knocked off me, a Bentley Anage
So I can hit you and your friend, in the back of my car

[Mr. 3-2]
Big Boss, Pimpin' Chris
I'm a Southside playa, that'll pimp a bitch
Rocks on my wrist, that a hoe pay fo'
She broke the crack, till she break a toe
Make me do', without too much sleeping
Break a trick, don't pass that freaking
On the weekend, we taking trips
I's a pimp, so bring back my chips
Brand new whips, on tennis shoes
24 inches, I'ma pay a due
Breaking rules, and breaking laws
Bout to go hard, in m√©nage trois
Sipping bar, selling white
Mr. 3-2, go hard with dykes
They make me praying, and never complain
And it's the kinda brother, listen street game

[Hook]

And I done knocked off me, a Bentley Anage
So I can hit you and your friend, in the back of my car come on</pre>
