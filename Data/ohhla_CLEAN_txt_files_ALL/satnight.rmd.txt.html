[Trife Diesel]
Aiyo, my moms in the hospital, my pops is gone
So it's me against the world and my glocks is strong
Wishing death to my enemies, downing bottles of Hennessey
Reach for the phone and call up the homey Remedy
What's the deal? I heard it was going down
Heard you got a little problem on your side of the town
What's the situation? Is this a major altercation?
I be there in 20 minutes, just give me a location
I'm going out blazing, firing hard
With 20 goons suited up like the rioting squad
Caravan cartels, deliver the parcel
With their names on the bullets, let's see if they dodge hell
Shells popping, bodies dropping, hitting the floor
Could of been the crossfire, we shot our way out the door
Staten Island's most wanted, Trife Diesel and Reme'
Professional marksmen when we squeezing the semi

[Remedy]
All I heard was shots, next thing, everyone's running
Get off the block, yo, the cops are coming
More firing, next thing I heard was the sound of a siren
It was sick, something like a modern day flick
Take a pic, quick, me and Trife Dies' jump in the whip
Put the pedal to the metal, son, foot the floor
We in the midst of a neighborhood drug war
Cracks in the Maxima, thirty eight snub
With the cops right in back of us, showing no love
You got guns, better know how to use them
Two ways out, shoot 'em up, we'll lose 'em
You fucked up, you pay the ultimate price
That's your life, it's just another saturday night
It's an everyday street thing, hits that flex muscle and
This goes out to them cats that be hustling</pre>
