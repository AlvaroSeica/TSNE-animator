Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey
Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her a rose
She wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you 
Cause.......

(Chorus 1)
A rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you and sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh.oh.yeah When she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you

(Chorus 2)
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power

See.....
(Repeat Chorus 1)

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow
Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
'Cause without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

(Repeat Chorus 1)

See....
(Repeat Chorus 2)</pre>
