[Bridge]
I bet she be in the gym, working on her fitness
Her body is a crime, I'm a witness
You look like love when she get it
And She got us so tight, damn she could get the bidness

[Chorus]
Go head go head, go hard go hard
Go head, go head, go hard, go hard
Now work, and sweat and work, and sweat
And work, and sweat and work, and sweat
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go!
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go!
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go!
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go!
Go head go head, go hard go hard
Go head, go head, go hard, go hard
Now work, and sweat and work, and sweat
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go!

[Verse 1]
Bet she be in the gym, working on her body
Doing pole dances, knocking on Pilates
Working all day, but when she get home
Go so hot she could fit her old dress on!
Stupid high heels with a little dress on
Ab so right, but that ass did wrong
Shawty Listerine momma love to feel the burn
Tearin up the treadmill, sweatin out her perm

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now she be in the club, but I ain't talking dance
Lifetime chance of a lifetime, damn
Every man in his right mind, probably take a glance
Had to do some squash just to get up in her pants
Ah yah, ah man, she got me in a trance
Had a kid and her body snapback rubber- band
She always on the diet, homie, she don't really need it
Them other girl's jealous of it, she don't even see it!
I'm a say how I see it don't mean make you conceited
But girl, you're a star, are you related to Venus?
Baby girl you're princess, you're related to Xena?
Tryna lock your ass down, do I need a subpoena?

[Bridge]
