[Intro: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
The year is 2099, time to go to work

[Holocaust]
I may not initially enter a dwelling patient without a invitation
A wolf thirsty threw the window at me
Leaves an empty town, feels he's being watched patient
In a dark destined location
The fancy world of crime, like these villains in the film Dick Tracy on my mind
Straight, no chaser, the fakes that who love it
The Twilight Zone rhyme, like an eye reflect in the mirror
What's the glacier of them at night
Freeze, the snow cloud that get it like a frog
The ring of poetry in the fog
A night at the opera, crash, crash, crash
My warpath is the epilogue, turn you inside out, class dismissed
Before you reign immortal, you fall, all dirty like a mannequin
The disaster of war, you outside in the portal

[Ace Gauntlit]
Sky labs, 2099, yo, yo
Razor sharp rusty blades spin, you failed to the trust last heartman
Each possess the breasts of an underwater dark marksman
That vanished when fire, smoke collide, this only element five
Even though the dumbest in stride
I can never be simplified into anything less than clever
Six gems flashing in a five finger glove made of leather
All my snaps is armored axes
Fiending to have you download tracks for the old satisfaction
Naturally limbs respond with quick twitching
Modern day ammunition, built inside the arm
Personality switch, he killed you, then forgot
Ya'll like small pigs, raised on slop, I'd rather get you in feces
Worms in the brain got me screaming, she squirming
Easily purified by this premature fire burning
Righteous in eyes is fire, the foundation for learning elevation tactics
Verbal skills then stripped down, to without the right to gat this

[Atlantis Scrolls]
This is gun sword, behold my ultimatum
Guns of Navarone, chemical warfare in my warzone
Grab a gas mask, we ain't breathing the O-Zone, in 2099
Poisonous oxygen, third world apocalypse
We cilivize Metropolis, ominous exiles
From the future, escape from an island
There was no surviving, my commons kept on dying
For what? Your respect? I'll disrespect your intellect
We bring war in the flesh and it's mad to the next
I'll terrorize your air, calm your respatorial
I'm very terrorital, tossing ninja stars
From the corners of the corridors
Splitting split second with the half broken sword
Blow up your world with bricks of C4
Hitting you with fuse, if there's blood available
At your local music store

[Watt]
Make way, young buckaroos, I'm going in
Ku Klux Klan vs. Panthers, who wanna win?
Whatever, anytime, tough Tony rappers is phony
Regardless to who you are, get scarred, you and your cronies
From a place of the fouless creatures
Where body parts go on telephone lines instead of sneakers
My borough is the reason for TNT, me and P
First to set it off and the last to flee
Shadow Clan, it's hard to box something you can't see
Move only in stealth, hide in the air, jump out of trees
My gun sword shoot off legs, cut off heads
Family guy to pay for your burial, so keep your bread
Muslim swordsman with a nine and a grenade
You can't run, I'mma get you, sucka, like John Sway
Whether old or new school, you ain't exempt from the blade
Modus Operandi, the wack gotta fade

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
I'm a bayonet, historical props, just like a red coat
I pierce your throat, and then I exit through the back
I space time continue, blueprint, til I'm up in you
Then explode in 1988, take out the wack
Nobody believe it could be done like this
But my revenge came right on time like I'm Swizz
You people just don't know, you can't see
How a fat muthafucka like me, is so G
Heh, I'm so G, it's my first damn name
Melchizedek's the attribute, so please don't make me have to shoot
You kids mind your manners, like you mentally politer
I'mma teach you grown up lessons like you taking class at night
Cuz I'm a Soul Kid, getting dough, kid
No time to babysit you punk asses, I got my own kids
You be aight, just stay in the child's place
O.G.'s, we run this shit, your wacks is jus wet in space</pre>
