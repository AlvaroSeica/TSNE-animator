[Intro: DJ Kayslay (Ron Isley sample)]
Too Raw for Radio, Ruthless Bastardz (I know it's hard)

[Chorus: Apocalipps (Ron Isley sample)]
All my niggaz locked down in a cell, stressed out
Doin' twenty-five to life, nigga (I know it's hard)
And all my mami's that strip at night
To feed them kids and make them bills right (I know it's hard)
Yeah, and all my Bastardz across the nation
I'm here to give you inspiration, nigga (I know it's hard)

[Truck]
I never thought as a childs, moms'd leave me for self
All I wanted was a family while others wanted the wealth
Understand me, you feel my pain, my nigga?
I'm a Bastard for life, it's in my veins, my nigga
I'ma take you on the road, it's rough, that's my life
It was sold and still as fuck, I'm alright
Not so great, growin' up, raised by the state
Foster parents tried to starve me, snatched the food off they plates
Next thing you know, I'm robbin' people, runnin' from Jakes
Only fourteen, they had to ship my ass upstate
But wait, just when I thought things'd get better
I whopped my teacher's ass, they sent me out to Mt. Loretta
Don't ever ask me if I rep for these blocks
Motherfucker, I done slept on these blocks, bust a tech on these blocks
I sold my first piece of crack on this block
And my ambition never gon' stop
Moms, I miss ya, memories when I see ya picture
My life is like a real Antoine Fisher
The black Oliver Twist, male version of Annie
I'm tryin' to shoot a few movies, tryin' to win me a Grammy
Star-studded, most people, say I'm too rugged
Long as my niggaz in the hood, and my white boys love it
And I'm special, right off that little yellow bus
Nowadays I'm tryin' to cop the yellow Maybach truck

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
Yeah, we all lined up, a single man file
An adolescene as a child, Riker's Island got me refusin' to smile
These monkeys is wild, like 28 Days Later
My lawyer pulled some strings, I'm out twenty-eight days later
Back on the block it's the same old shit, I need a double up quick
I'm strugglin', I need to bubble up quick
And it's hard, cuz now my insides is hollow
Bang them hollows to put some Enfamil in them bottles
Cuz when the, baby is cryin', and wifey is flippin'
You gotta, force ya hand and that's an awkward position
And y'all motherfuckers gotta be kiddin'
If I can't eat here, nobody's eatin' here, I'm burnin' down the kitchen
I got a different steez, I think I'm "Fallin" like Alicia Keys
Fallin' in this crack game, I need some ki's
I should leave it be, but I think the Jake, want a piece of me
You must be bugged the fuck out thinkin' I'ma piece the D's
What is you crazy? I ain't goin' out like Larry Davis
And be the prime suspect, on every newspaper
Wars for the block, both sides got knocked
A few died, we realized the shit belonged to the cops
Meanwhile, back inside, the prison life will stress ya
More wars, more gangs, some niggaz fold under pressure
And there's nothin' to get an animal stretched up
Bit a nigga face, they threw me behind the glass like I was Hannibal Lectur
Shit is real, and I ain't here to water you down
You a seed that need to grow, I've got to water you now
I can't believe my whole life I was movin' backwards
Practice make perfect, I guess you gotta watch what you practice

[Chorus]</pre>
