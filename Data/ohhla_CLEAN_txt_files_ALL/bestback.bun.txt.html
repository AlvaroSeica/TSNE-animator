[Intro: Bun B]
Goddamn! (Goddamn!)
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin house (motherfuckin house)
The King of the Trill bitch, you guessed it
UGK for life hoe (for life hoe)
You already know how we gettin down this time around (time around)
We representin for the Port town (Port town)
Bitch, and the motherfuckin best is back
Hol' up, yeah!

[Bun B]
Ladies and gentlemen, you already know that it's him again
Lettin 'em hang, non-feminine
Crunk like I'm gone off Ritalin, chopped off top, there's no middle and
Throwed on that Henn' again (throwed on that Henn' again)
With no vodka, show shocker, mo' rocker
in the slab (slab) "Bend It Like Beckham", no soccer (no soccer)
And no doctor can diagnose the symptom when I approach
my victim, from the back and tie the rope (rope)
And throw him over the ledge
like Blanket, throw a thrower over your head, all over you're dead
Go 'head quote him, he said it was bound to happen (happen)
when you fuck around with them clowns and down for clappin (clappin)
Been strapped, ready to pop rounds up out the Magnum (Magnum)
When they hop out and jack 'em (jack 'em) call the coroner to come out and wrap 'em
Put 'em under the tree, so every one they can see
that ain't no fuckin with the Bun to the B, nigga

[Chorus 2X: scratched samples]
"Guess who's back? Me!"
"There's no competition, huh, 'tition"
"Aww sh-shit, hol' up"
"Guess who's back? Me!"
"Shut 'em down"
"Hurt-hurtin boys"
"It's over, it's over"
"Cause the best is back, bitch"

[Bun B]
It's Bun Beeda mayne, ridin with the heater mayne
Niggaz know that I'm the hardest out since the PETA mayne (mayne)
Hot doggin, yeah smoke dog comin out foggy
Lettin off at your toes, hop froggy (hop)
My third leg loggy and your bitch is a lumberjack
You'd have killed that hoe if you knew what I done done to that (to that)
She chopped my tree down often if I slumber jack
Beggin me to call but shit I don't know where her number at (at all)
And on the cool, I ain't lookin for it either though
Or the bitch before her, no I ain't lookin for neither hoe (naw)
It ain't like I really need her though
Once she drop to her knees and let me skeet it out, nigga she can go (go)
Lead her out like a blind man walkin
Like Sandman dancin, it's over, stop talkin
I'm sparkin mo' dodo (dodo) blazin mo' kush up (kush up)
Comin mo' harder than a no-hand push-up (push-up)

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
Let's pass the peas like we used to say
And put it down like we used to play, let's make the news today
And leave some cement in they shoes today
Say what we choose to say, and lay down who we choose to lay
And we leave 'em laid (laid) while we leavin paid (paid)
Fair and square nigga, sound like an even trade (trade)
Triple cross and we leave 'em sprayed (sprayed)
Spayed and neutered, no matter how much you pray to the shooter's face (face)
Cause there's no emotion ('motion) and there's no elation ('lation)
Then he realizes it's the reaper fo' sho' he facin (facin)
Secret words like a holy mason (mason)
Was all he heard before I took his head off (head off) and I blew his face in (face in)
Who ya chasin? Ain't no catchin up, keep ya weapon tucked
Be ready to buck and knuckle up whenever you steppin up
Takin it as your guns are just the fact that leavin that ass is crap
Never give less than that, it's just a fact that nigga the best is back
Bitch~! (Yeahhhhhhhh)
