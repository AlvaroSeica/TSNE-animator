Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo! well this is smokin'...
And the dynamic duo
The cutting committee
The lyrical mechanic hero
And you know (what's that?)
That we serve the people nice
And we're good live
Like versing evil twice
In a world where your cash
Couldn't buy an idea
So fuck the po-po
We're gettin' high up in here
See, my rhyme is official
Time's my initial
Sit back, click clack
Yo, my mind is a missile

Yeah, we ruined the manners
But we're cool with the grammar
So we got mothers feelin' this
To fuckin' dudes in the slammer
Brewin' the bangers and
Our show is a spectacle
My damn super bananas
The flow is impeccable

We just roll up
Through the hills in the middles
Would ya hold up,
This is bliss to the eso so
Grown ups, let me hear ya
Really bellow okay (okay!)

We don't flash cash on the neon lights
My name is mad max
Pitchin' "we want rights"
I've got the bull by it's horns
The beast by it's tail
A brain off it's leash
That's deeper than Yale
Shockwaves through your hood
When I properly drop this
Double barrel brains
Doomed to bang in your cockpit
So how you feelin' Bliss?
Man, I never been better
This veteran's clever, he's
Stringing every letter together
Bangin' like a set of...
Is not a getter of cheddar
Instead I roll up to the bash
In the fuckin' Nebuchadnezzar
Oh my God
Throw 'em up like Krylons
And we gon' get it crackin'
Like a party in Zion

We just roll up
Through the hills in the middles
Would ya hold up,
This is bliss to the eso so
Grown ups, let me hear ya
Really bellow okay (okay!)

(Check it out)
Hey yo, I blow Briggs back
That's what happens when
I talk smoked out, no doubt
Eight Staffys on a porch
And I'm not a joke
I blaze up the broccoli
I rock the boat
I break the monotony to pick up
Well, this'll make ya switch lanes quick
Like hittin' Charlie when you're drunk
Just like Rick James, bitch
My nickname's Bliss
But wait a second, buster
You don't know me, my brother
You may address me as Gunther
Well if you got it, motherfucker
Then you know my name
I make it rain lit matchsticks
And snow cocaine
And I'm down for the course
Like a dog for it's owner
And all the shit-talkers
Spill grug off my boner
Bitch, back the fuck up
And build your spaceship right
You dilly dally dummys

We just roll up
Through the hills in the middles
Would ya hold up,
This is bliss to the eso so
Grown ups, let me hear ya
Really bellow okay (okay!)

We just roll up
Through the hills in the middles
Would ya hold up,
This is bliss to the eso so
Grown ups, let me hear ya
Really bellow okay (okay!)

(Gon' get it crackin' like a party in Zion...)</pre>
