[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah... yo... yo...

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
The race is on, my face is gone
Niggas I face, see the face on my arms
The race is on, my face is gone
Niggas I face, see the face on my arms
The race is on, my face is gone
Niggas I face, see the face on my arms, then blaow
The race is on, my face is gone
Niggas I face, see the face on my arms, then blaow

[Dom Pachino]
Son a bitch? I'm the son of a bastard child
Lyrics I craft this wild, shit in my past is foul
I don't talk about it, though I could be about it
See how this place is crowded, bet you, I could empty it out
Oh so simple, but it's hard to figure me out
Move quick, fast, but could slow it down like ya Dirty South
Disrespect me, get slapped in your dirty mouth
I've been struggling too long to be playing these games
Been hustling for the fortune, all I need is the fame
Who the name, who the blame, that's a hook in my song
Had to backpack to Brooklyn, see what, how, went wrong
'97, now that's the birth of the Killarm'
Three LP's to my click, now I'm convinced that it's on
This is the year of the Power Rule, got lyrics that inspire you
Plus retire you, what you try'nna do, I can assist
When it's done, take a look at the wrist
Bitch, nigga, ya ice is gone

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, niggas always tell me, I move too fast
I guess I don't like the thought of coming in last
I come in silent like a weapon and go out with a blast
I move, like a man in whip, with jakes tailing my ass
You see, time is money, dun, money is cash
Cash for infesting, and cash to beat ass
Check the statistics, life spans is shorter
Plus I got a daughter, that need me to support her
My mans in the yae business, he copped him a quarter
A week later, chopped a key, now he thrown out the water
Now you know what I mean, when the race is on
Hop state when the police chasing is on
You work at a bank? I wonder why the safe is gone
Fix ya face, bitch nigga, before ya space is gone
I was raised on the same street this waste is on
Stuck niggas, fuck bitches til the break of dawn

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dom Pachino]
And the winner of the race is...
Dom Pachino...</pre>
