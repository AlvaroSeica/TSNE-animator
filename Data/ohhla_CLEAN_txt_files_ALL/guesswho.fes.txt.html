Song:   Guess Who's Back?
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: L.I.S.]
Guess who is back, from the Stat
On the block, it's the Four
With nine mills, tracks, crills and more

[L.I.S.]
I'mma Four, show hitter, and coming at your hoe
For sure, I'm gon' get her, if money got the dough
For sure, I'm gon' get her, I'm your neighbourhood riddler
I reps the Stat, and I'm coming back with the Four
With my foot through the door, they can't stop us no more
With drop top Beemers, in the Benz with a four
I keep freaks galore, sweet cheeks to damn whores
I'm all I stand for, a gigolo to the core
I got drunk in my yard like Fred Sanford
That's why everywhere I go, my feet get pampered
But don't test my temper, make me throw a tantrum
They be like 'damn, son was just chilling, what the hell happened'
Knots on his head, pistol whipped, it was the action
You gotta show these niggas, shit is real when they start acting
And if they run off off the lip, you might as well start clapping
I'm from the Killah Hill, BX to the Staten
I make shit happen, when I spit off, the crowd reacting
Now that's what the fuck I call a main attraction
If a nigga talk tough, don't think twice, just jack 'em

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
