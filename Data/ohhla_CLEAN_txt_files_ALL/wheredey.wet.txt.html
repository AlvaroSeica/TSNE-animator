Chorus:4x 
Where dem hoes at? 
Where dem hoes at? 
Where dem niggaz in the Benz with the Mo's at? 

Verse 1: 
We in the club, 
I'm buckin ya betta believe I'm fulla that bud 
It's (?) thug 
And I'm never showin no luv 
You can't fade it, down for life with that double beat 
With geezy cheezy Crystal and Don P 
Very important people in the section where we be 
You can't stop me 
Black upon the Grim Ree 
I need to get on the drank 
Mix with dank 
That's on fire 
Killin them hoes with the camolflauge entire 
Fo' real riders 
Down south all-night flighters 
My nigga UP 
Double track that over excite ya 
Non-stop, cuz it's that Big Body party 
Blowin hella sets, and we got this shit started 
I got plans for bank rolls to turn stacks 
I'm lookin for the mutha fuckin hoes, where dey at? 

Chorus:4x 

Verse 2: 
I was feelin fucked up off the herb'n in back 
Now I'm in my 500 Benz wonder'n where dem hoes is at 
So I just hit the parkin lot 
of a tight spot 
If it (?) parkin lot you know the shit it just don't stop 
These hoes is comin from all around and stay flexin 
Wit their tight leather outfits and lookin sexin 
They got extensions in their hair wit the gold mouth 
And everytime that bitch speak you can hear the south 
No disrespect to all others but we keepin game 
And if your bitch i think was smart enough you heard the same 
Instead of ballin no ya wanna do wit chea check 
But like Nicole Brown Simpson you lose your neck 
Enough wit that because a joker is about fun 
Our record company is taken over number 1 
Big Body got this bitch sore from the front to the back niggaz 
Ugh, now where dem hoes at? 

Chorus:4x 

Verse 3: 
(?) Mary Jane gotta play ya (?) 
So take a look and tell me what you see in my surroundence 
Thugs and made niggaz at the back tables bouncin 
Clogged-out and thugged-out smokin off a mountain 
All night cheafin like we some full-blooded Indians 
Trippin off these hoes jockin tryin to get their inches in 
Steppin toward the table like they know me and my team ballin 
They see a (?) in their hair, everynight is shock callin 
(?) and champaigne bubblin jacuzi style 
Big body Benz's with tv's and 20's (?) 

Chorus:4x 

Verse 4: 
You prancin 
You dancin 
My they go be glancin 
Why you shakin up all that ass on the flo' lets take a chancin 
I'm buckin, I'm sweatin, club got my motivated 
Vibe your head cuz it's got no time to be playa hatin 
Now let that ass BOUNCE and put it on the flo' 
We gon' keep the club buckin 'till they close the do' 
Won't be no (?) won't be no gay party 
Cuz we gon' set it off like when the (?) when we get it started 
Like watchin that body workin betta get that number right 
Betta get da mind blown wit da herb and gin and take her home tonight 
Stop and take a breath 
It's time to whipe that sweat 
This ain't the half of the crums you ain't ready yet
