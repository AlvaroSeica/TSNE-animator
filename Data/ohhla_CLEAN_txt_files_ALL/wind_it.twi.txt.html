let me get it behind it
I can't make you popular baby with no timing
you want the lime like a star shining
well let me show you what I mean when I say I'm grinding
follow my lead you're with twist here eff simon
playing touch football baby I be linesman
hut pitch that I promise I won't miss that
but when I throw it off you better get that
badda bing I gotta hit that
then I get back to the hard work before it paid off
maybe if I do a couple more worldwide tours
maybe I can get a couple of e's every days off
keep my j's off rest in the shade keeo my shades off
chilling with a diamond star bitch now stand up cause..
