[Everlast]
She was a hot blooded women, he never saw it comin
She hit him from the side that's blind
She never gave a warning, he woke up in the mornin
layin there next to his pride
He got a little crazy when she had a little baby
cause it filled him with a fatherly pride
But a couple years later when their love started fadin
he hurt so bad he nearly died

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, since I was faithful
It's been a long time, since I was grateful
It's been a long time, since I could look you in the eye
It's been a long time, since I was grateful

[Everlast]
She's a mother with a daughter, sittin by the water
cause it's better for her baby to breathe
She got a man that's in prison cause he didn't wanna listen
Now he's sittin waitin on a reprieve
And she loves her lil' baby but she get a lil' crazy
cause it's harder than she ever conceived
He left her on her own, but she's doin it alone
cause she loves him like he wouldn't believe

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
He's a friend and a lover, husband and a brother
He's always been a prodigal son
He gets a lot of drama when he go to see his momma
cause he curses like a son of a gun
He's beggin to his lady, let him see his baby
He swears that she's the only one
He's got a heart full of sorrow, he's livin for tomorrow
and he's sorry for the damage he's done

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
