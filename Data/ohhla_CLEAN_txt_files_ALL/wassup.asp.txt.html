[Intro]
Clams Casino, ASAP (Wassup? wassup?)
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup? (Wassup?)
Hey... (Wassup?)
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup? (Wassup?)
Hey...

[ASAP Rocky]
Back once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends, countin Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins, that Mercedes-Benz
Different things, made a change of plans, well that all depends
Shoutout my parolees, and I smoke that O.G.
Kush motherfuck the police, all my niggaz rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sippin on that codeine
We hustle hard, no sleep, yo' bitch loose, that's no leash
I ain't talkin 'bout no money, I ain't talkin 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a facade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

[Chorus One]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin
Tell them quit the bitchin, we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin
Tell them quit the bitchin, we gon' make it in a second

[Chorus Two]
See me in the hood the gangsters sayin wassup? (Wassup?)
See me in the hood the gangsters sayin wassup? (Wassup?)
See me in the hood the gangsters sayin wassup? (Wassup?)
See me in the hood the gangsters sayin wassup?

[ASAP Rocky]
Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Uhh, clothes get weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up
Uhh, the nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a fan, forty ounce full of brew

[Chorus One] - 2X
