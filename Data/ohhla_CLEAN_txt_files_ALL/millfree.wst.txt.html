OKAY, I RELOADED! (The League Crew!) 

Yeah 
It's (a million) 

[Hook] 
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million) 
How many niggas bit the soul, bout (a million) 
How many hoes did I bone, bout (a million) 
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh 
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one 
(A million) 

[Verse One] 
A lot of people ask about the money I made
Even Just Blaze 
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid? 
Rappers I met, or, dealt with direct 
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check? 
What's the position you hold? 
Could you really match the Neptunes, check my check
And "H to the Izzo" is the only single that went gold? 
If this Roc-a-fella shit fold
And you move back to the "Go" 
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low? 
For the million time asking me 
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me 
Like you don't care about my son's feelings? 
Can I get a minute you wack bitch?
I ain't gotta jack shit 
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit? 
Ugh
Fake tits
Shut up and make hits 
Can't we all just get along, +Spread Love+ like Take 6
What, you doing beats in LA for Eminem and Dr Dre? 
Them niggas sold ten mill I'm trying to get paid 
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment 
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber BLAOW! 

[Hook]
How many years did I wait, about (a million) 
How many niggas tryin' hate, about (a million) 
But when a nigga count his cake, it's bout (a million) 

[Verse Two] 
'04 the College Dropout
I make the game different 
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking
Hoes is my addiction 
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen 
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you 
Cause these beats change the game
And the hook's right too 
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do? 
Knowing I supposed to style
I'm the fly boy poster child 
Bout to beat on Oprah now 
It's ironic and whatnot 
How I put no ice on the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot 
Now you see me on stages
My hit resumes is 
Two pages 
For them niggas who played us 
Feet just raises 
Booming like Master Aces 
+Stand Up+, number one, and there's more to come 
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum 
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney, Rubble and them 
Chi-town in this bitch, what's fucking with them? 
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing
BLAOW!
