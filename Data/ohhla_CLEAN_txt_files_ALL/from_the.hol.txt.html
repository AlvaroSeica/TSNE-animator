[J-Dog]
I can't see because I'm staring at a blank wall (blank wall)
I can't breathe because my fucking thoughts are choking me now
I can't grieve for the souls that are so lost (so lost)
I can't leave because my fucking self is holding me down
Imagine cold hands up to your throat
The thought alone makes you swallow your hope
And now it's harder to cope
And I don't know where I'll go
These fallacies I don't believe, and fear that nobody knows
It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die!

[Chorus (Danny)]
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can be found inside my mind
Goodbye
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky
Goodbye

[J-Dog &amp; Da Kurlzz]
Look as we all fall apart
We all fall apart
We all fall apart

[J-Dog]
Would you forgive me if I told you that I lied like you? (fuck you)
So full of hate, with the love to lose
Would you deny it if I asked you just to tell the truth?
Cause in the end you gotta decide what side to choose
Imagine cold hands holding your heart
The thought alone can only tear you apart
I know you wish it would end, it's sad it's only the start
These memories they only mean my soul is empty and dark
It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die!

[Chorus (Danny)]
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can be found inside my mind
Goodbye

As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky
Goodbye

[Bridge (J-Dog)]
It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die!
It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right
And if I don't fight it's like being buried alive [x2]

[Danny]
Cause I, I wanna feel anything
And I know that we all think we can't be wrong
Soon we'll all be gone
And I, I don't know what this means
But if I knew anything, I'd know for sure
We'll all be gone

[Chorus (Danny)]
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can be found inside my mind
Goodbye
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky
Goodbye</pre>
