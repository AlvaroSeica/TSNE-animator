[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (RZA)]
Yo, check this out, my name is the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Youknowhatimsayin, when I rhyme, when I, when I get down for my crown
I come out crazy like a, like a tiger, or something, knowhatimsayin
No, no, nobody can even F' with me, straight up and down
You knowhatimsayin', so that's how we coming in, knowhatimsayin?
(From the heart of Medina, to the head, to the east
To the plaza houses, a/k/a the Mountain
To the rugged lands of Shaolin, yo
We rock all, all, all in together now
Got played, got fresh, up---)

[GZA]
The world was bugging off this Wu-Tang nigga on the rock
That was just another spot on the muthafuckin' block
You forgot Cash Rule nigga? --- toss seven figures
He pull a trigger to make that account, get bigger
Had babies to feed, kept a bitch with need
Thousands shows booked, promoters on speed
His hands was in everything, including some pussy
From the Brazilian wax, to the uncombed bushy
From down state, psychiatric
Who tried to put a code on his brain until he cracked it
Now the media wanna view him like they knew him
And his head nurse, wanna sue him cause she blew him
Ever since he walked on stage, he was just a loose cannon
Wild drunk staggin', a nigga who kept standing
Class clown, who erase chalk from the board
The only choir member, that sing off chord, we were

[Chorus 2X: GZA (w/ RZA)]
(All, all, all in together now)
Kept the balance, stay dressed for the weather now
Battle M.C.'s, anywhere, whatever town
And remain victorious, in any ground

[GZA]
The All In Together Now, started in Bed-Stuy
Human beatbox specialist, who dressed fly
A half ounce of blow and a forty ounce drinker
Magnificent flow, critical thinker
Unique is one grain of sand from the beach
And had bitches eating out of his hand
He was intelligent, his style was relevant
I can name ten niggaz that stole an element
From the high speed chase to the court arraignments
All of the above, was entertainment
He caused earthquakes, just from experiments
Some thoughts got lost, not knowing where it went
His songs had a rep for many inducements
Giving birth to new styles, after recruitments
There's no replacement or any supplement
He was a new testament, what he said, what he meant, we were

[Chorus 2X]

[GZA]
The judge took a look at he, and threw the book at thee
The sentencing, would of made the average crook happy
They put him in a box, wrapped like a gift
In them straight jacket, watched by two, worked the shift
Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight
Like, Billie the Kid, in his last gun fight
Then days became weeks, weeks became months
Carved the calendar on the wall, with his front
The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell
My hands covered with latex gloves
Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks
The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks
He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots
Moving with they own plot, but the Dirt, he think not
He had nothing but time on his hands
As if he got him signed from the Clan, we were

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: RZA (chess sample)]
All, all, all, in together now
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
All, all, all, in together now
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
	"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
(Now white doesn't really wanna use up
His two remaining pawn moves, so he plays, king to E2)</pre>
