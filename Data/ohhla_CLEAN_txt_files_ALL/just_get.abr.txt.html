[Chorus]
Started out as just another emcee
Odds stacked against me
Whole world against me
Never gave up even though I been tempted
But I'm too relentless
Now they can't touch me, man
I ain't never stopping
I ain't never stopping
Yeah I'm just getting goin
I'm just getting goin
See the way I feel?
I don't hear 'em talking
I'm Jesse Abraham
I ain't Jesse Owens
I'm not runnin'

[Verse 1]
So now it seems to denounce my dreams would be mature of me
Childish shouts and screams are drowned out by doubt
It's the surest thing
Searchin' for certainty in my community such an absurdity
Yearnin' for unity for you and me, that purity, immunity that beauty brings
The truest thing
I'm not new to this game
I knew that listening was due to be missing in numerous ways
So humor it stays
There's no gloom
No sooner it comes the sooner it leaves
It's time, so let's recline
Move forward don't press rewind
No stress in mind
We're all invited
Yes we're all welcome
So step inside

[Chorus]
Started out as just another emcee
Odds stacked against me
Whole world against me
Never gave up even though I been tempted
But I'm too relentless
Now they can't touch me, man
I ain't never stopping
I ain't never stopping
Yeah I'm just getting goin
I'm just getting goin
See the way I feel?
I don't hear 'em talking
I'm Jesse Abraham
I ain't Jesse Owens
I'm not runnin'

[Verse 2]
I learn a lesson **
But I will never lessen
I listen and grow through practice
If absence makes the heart grow fonder I must be pretty fond of wackness
Yeah.  So hear ye, hear ye
I spit at half speed so you can hear me clearly
Weirdly enough I was raised to believe that a promise is a promise
Now my brain has to be
Aware of the bluffs
Prepared for the roughs that don't contain diamonds
Just cuz I'm rhyming you think I'm bout to bust like a hymen
When you apply pressure?
Please.  I know when you're lyin'
All the time, man
Wanna hear a joke?
Listen carefully to every word you ever spoke
I'm the Howard Roark of rap
I'm sorry, find yourself another architect

[Chorus]
Started out as just another emcee
Odds stacked against me
Whole world against me
Never gave up even though I been tempted
But I'm too relentless
Now they can't touch me, man
I ain't never stopping
I ain't never stopping
Yeah I'm just getting goin
I'm just getting goin
See the way I feel?
I don't hear 'em talking
I'm Jesse Abraham
I ain't Jesse Owens
I'm not runnin'

[Verse 3]
So all of y'all disappear
Every time you talk I hear you diss a peer
Got me copywriting all the raps that I wrote
Cuz I'm scared that you just gonna jack it like a coat
I'm physically strong
I'm fiscally strong
Got bars like a penitentiary's where I'm from
I was a dope emcee before I started rhyming
I been an enigma wrapped up in a riddle
Jewish
On the roof isn't where I play my fiddle
Foolish
Your students are bored just starin' in classes
You can't reach your pupils like you was wearin glasses
People sayin what I wanna hear
My laugh's a sarcastic onomonopia
I live like I could die at any minute
But I learn as if I'm eternal, infinite

[Chorus]
Started out as just another emcee
Odds stacked against me
Whole world against me
Never gave up even though I been tempted
But I'm too relentless
Now they can't touch me, man
I ain't never stopping
I ain't never stopping
Yeah I'm just getting goin
I'm just getting goin
See the way I feel?
I don't hear 'em talking
I'm Jesse Abraham
I ain't Jesse Owens
I'm not runnin'</pre>
