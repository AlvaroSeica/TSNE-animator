(Ahh mate)

I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience
I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience

(So Steve, where did you grow up?
Upper Clapton, Hackney
How old were you when you first started rapping?
I was 18
Who are your major influences?
Are you serious? Your Mum)

I ain't answering anymore of your questions, you know what? I have a question
Who's idea was it to get in the charts, by rhyming over hungarian dance music
Why would I make dance music, when I can't dance to it?
I'm the anecdote to that shit, bringing back strap shit
soon as I'm done calling this bulimic a fat bitch
I'll be saving the day on renegade with the dog
playing fetch watching him chase a grenade
Maybe I should play the same game with Bruno
if I ever again get mistaken for a cluedo
character I'm gonna have to unleash my mitch a judo
I just took a shit and now I can't find any loo roll
Two flows, for everyone that you got too hot
I do squat diddily and do more than you do when you do lots, do lots
Do women do for me what they did not do
maybe it's got something to do with my new watch.

I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience
I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience

I have a question, why would I beat around the bush
or take the scenic route, when I'm a meanie, born to incigate fumes
I'm the morning, midday and evening news
and I started a trend Mike got his teeth fixed to
If you're wondering where i've been out
kicked back with a six-pack, of becks on a bench
sunbathing in a hijab, give me a tic-tac
I just had a pack of Nik Naks, thanks
now i'll turn you into a kebab with my pick-axe
Mish, mash, mosh-pit, whenever I drop shit
it's hot shit, I just won a race with an ostrich
Obnoxious, preposterous, looney a damn nutter
if I ever see Rooney anywhere near my Grandmother ah!
I live life without an ounce of logic
I like my wrist so much I spent a house deposit on it
Vomit and then I drink more wine
then I broke a bowl and hope the Hospital gives me morphine
How do you spend your time?

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I don't have a question, nope
When it come to competition, I'm burying them
Better to bury them then have them getting lairy again
They want it with me like they want it with malaria
like Wayne Bridge wants to be John Terry'd again
I developed an obsession with Caroline Flack
I wouldn't mind having a go on Caroline's
actually I promise to never be so vulgar
to never mention putting my cobra inside of Anna Kournikova, I swear

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I think I've got it out of my system now
You sure?
I am once again ready to answer questions
Good, 'cause there's so much I've been wanting to ask you
About 8 inches...
