Stacks on Deck Entertainment, Interscope
Collipark

[Verse One: Soulja Boy]
Check out my Bathing Apes; I'm fresh to death and you like me
Don't try to cop my style man, stick to them Nikes
Green, white black inside these, super clean Bathing Apes
My shoes like my chain, shine hard, they might hurt your face
I'm clean in this thang, B-A-P-E-S up on my feet
Fresh fade with the waves and 30/30 Boyz up on my tee
You want to get them (yup) but you can't get like me (nope)
Asking me, Soulja Boy, where you get your shoes (AYYY~!)

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Arab]
Bathing Apes on my feet and e'rybody heard me kicks
Purple yellow white, like my Kobe Bryant jersey
Ye ain't never seen these shoes, then let me tell you somethin son
You see how fresh these shoes is, these is not no Air Force Ones
Step up on the stage with my mouth on froze
Bathing Apes is on my feet, put the crowd on hold
Haters see 'em on my feet; I know they get mad
A little A-rab rockin mo' colors then a bag of Skittles

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Soulja Boy]
Bathing Apes on my feet so I gotta keep it movin
Step up on the scene, tell the girls start choosin
START CHOOSIN! START CHOOSIN!
START CHOOSIN! START CHOOSIN! (Right now~!)
Bathing Apes on my feet so I gotta keep it movin
Step up on the scene, tell the girls start choosin
START CHOOSIN! START CHOOSIN!
START CHOOSIN! START CHOOSIN! (YAHHH~!)

[Chorus]
