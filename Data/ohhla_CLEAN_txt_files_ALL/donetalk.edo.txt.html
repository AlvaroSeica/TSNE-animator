[ VERSE 1 ]
Bomb the levee, armed and deadly
Arm is steady, fingers, palms is sweaty
Shoot holes through your medley, life is so heady
I'm heavy, so ready, box your face out, beat a man Freddy
Chop confetti with a sharp machete
Got no flavor, no sauce, plain spaghetti
I spit legend like Yeti
Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence - SETI
Anything pertainin to Eddie
Went through Special K and then through Teddy
Child support, bank levy
House foreclosed, Freddie Mac and ( ? Fannie ? )
Now you're singing to my medley
Good Lord, the hood is hard
Pull your card, fought while you sparred
Banned and barred, my hand to God
Your odds are good, but goods are odd
I'm done talkin

(Bitch shut the fuck up)  --&gt; Eazy-E
(Quiet on the set)  --&gt; Dr. Dre
(Told you motherfuckers to stop gettin it twisted)
(Never been the type to run my mouth, I'm lock-jawed)

I'm done talkin

(I'm just bein real about it) --&gt; Xzibit
(Tired of niggas hollerin) --&gt; M.O.P.
(Shut up) --&gt; Run-D.M.C.
(Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin) --&gt; L.L. Cool J

[ VERSE 2 ]
It's beautiful and aggravatin, agitatin
Glad you're hatin, mouth salivatin
Your heart palpitation is a indication
You wanna suppress innovation
No limitation, flow been impatient
Smack DJ's, kick stations and corporations
You can all suck my dictation
Here's what you're now facin
Edo up close and personal, no more givin space 'n
Start bracin or start embracin
Old dogs become soap, greyhound racin
This ain't a playground chasin
Real life, you're fake like Freddy and Jason
Get this boom bap, start debasin
I'm half the price, they're twice as much
My fingerprints don't fade from the lives I touch
I'm done talkin
