[Jahdan]
What does your heart can see? Is it a blessin or a curse
They come to review, you teach the youth dems to hear, kill
Rob and steal, you gotta be strong, to resist
I love this temptations, and trample Babylon
Under your heed, is my chest to yem self
Humphi open a seed, then hemphi leave wit love
You can't hear your own fear
As it was written, so let it be done
What title when the peace, me come go for me gun
Chump petty sound blow, I know I figure I run
See I'm judged by society, me soldiers tote load and clear
For it by this a city, to speak the words that you hear
Come to me tense a bity, find by the garments you wear
I think not, me sing say

[Chorus]
Aiy ya ya ya yay, me hemphi cry
Aiy ya ya ya yay, say I just can't
Over stand, why he would go by get scott bye bye bye bye
To me it's so clear to see, I just can't figure out
To even us men, probably people meetin tis
Oh so wrong, and that's the reason why I
Sing these wo-wo-wo-words
Tell me what you gonna achieve, you shouldn't wanna believe
In the ginger in the wrong direction

[Jahdan]
Say what you wanna say, and do it two months
It's my chest to aid on I wear a bigger pun
Chumps, why fire we burn, try dem I find tunnel flows
Do anythin, figure the men sparks the yard
Turn the ball, when they reach them departs
Lightnin and fire so kill 'em on the boat sweat
So the task and I word it to undertake
His majesty, and he fit off to the hill-eh
Whole nitty bounce off, he's from Camp Texan
Don't we have to tell it to you, the red

[Chorus]
Aiy ya ya ya yay, me hemphi cry
Aiy ya ya ya yay, one more terror time
Aiy ya ya ya yay, say I just can't
Over stand, why he would go by get scott bye bye bye bye
To me it's so clear to see, I just can't figure out
To even us men, probably people meetin tis
Oh so wrong, and that's the reason why I
Sing these wo-wo-wo-words
Tell me what you gonna achieve, you shouldn't wanna believe
In the ginger in the wrong direction

[Jahdan]
It's not so hard, heh, we can do the right things
Show the people, once and for all, again, again
It's not so hard, we can do the right things
Show the people, well, well, once and for all, they are like
Beeferers, blunderers, the princes of the poor
Like pirates, dem sail from shore to shore
Diggin and fishin, fishin for your soul
But they just can't get no tension

[Chorus]
Say I just can't
Over stand, why he would go by get scott bye bye bye bye
To me it's so clear to see, I just can't figure out
To even us men, probably people meetin tis
Oh so wrong, and that's the reason why I
Sing these wo-wo-wo-words
What you gonna achieve, you shouldn't wanna believe
In the ginger in the wrong direction

(Aiy ya ya'in to the end)</pre>
