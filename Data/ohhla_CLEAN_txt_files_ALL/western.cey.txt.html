Typed by: Ras Ceylon at Gmail

C-A-L-I-FOR-N-I-A left coast westside its all the same
repping the hood banging a gang from the bay to L.A.
heron, x, herb and coke is the work that gets slanged
shipped from boats and planes CIA across the border
the most Spanish speakers are in the county of Orange
city of Santa Ana they won't show on T.V.
unless its cops that keep us locked in this real O.C.
got dreads and white tees essays low ride streets
asian immigrants racing cars illegally
high speed fleeing from sheriffs and deputies 
Pacific Coast Region this is true originality 
a pure Cali breed the best trees in the world
our chronic is known all over the globe
Rasta owns the rights and all of Jah amendments
representing heavens in the state of armageddon

CHORUS:

Aint nothing quiet on the Western Front
we only ride with the beats turned up
herb inside fronto leave blunt
heard the riot act I read it over drums
fighting cali wars from the beach to the slums 

Aint nothing quiet on the Western Front
I only ride with my beats turned up
herb inside fronto leave blunt
heard the riot act I read it over drums
fighting cali wars from the beach to the slums

I stay in Oakland no joke when the guns is smoking
northwest coast for fools who aren't knowing 
them blocks is hot like Weezy please believe me
theres hella dirty cops up in the O.P.D
Alameda county got a bounty on the flatlands
crackers in the hills wanna kill the brown and blackman
program of the panthers had 10 points
all of them O.G.'s are still in the joint
anoint the new legacy like a suicidal tendency
hit with felonies jails and penitentiaries
streets are cementaries roll down Seminary
I've seen more fiends than kids in elementary schools
trying learn the codes and rules of ghetto living
tell them handle your own business
and dont be no snitch what is it resistance
defend your existence 
east bay politix bare the witness

Aint nothing quiet on the Western Front
we only ride with the beats turned up
herb inside fronto leave blunt
heard the riot act I read it over drums
fighting cali wars from the beach to the slums 

Aint nothing quiet on the Western Front
I only ride with my beats turned up
herb inside fronto leave blunt
heard the riot act I read it over drums
fighting cali wars from the beach to the slums

I been all over the state and really what I've seen
is a California nightmare and not a lot of dreams
screams of the innocent bloody eyes of a fiend 
victimless crime killing time in between
rhyme schemes and lime green trees you find me
ducking the CHP bumping a June beat CD
prettty soon the governators trying to terminate we
people of CA enslaved systematically
engraved mathematics triple six is 18
legally an adult consult the jail industry
literally booming no more room in their schools and
the mark of the beast is a marketing scheme
fooling the youth to pursue suicide
repping the turf for what its worth
more than a few died
slangin poison to your own or posing on a microphone
was a thug like bone hear the shots now you're gone

Aint nothing quiet on the Western Front
we only ride with the beats turned up
herb inside fronto leave blunt
heard the riot act I read it over drums
fighting cali wars from the beach to the slums 

Aint nothing quiet on the Western Front
I only ride with my beats turned up
herb inside fronto leave blunt
heard the riot act I read it over drums
fighting cali wars from the beach to the slums</pre>
