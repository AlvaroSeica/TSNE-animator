Verse 1 *(Clee)*

An I say check me out
(say what?)
Check me out!
This for all them playa hatas that didnt wanna let me out
when ya see me, ya'll be prayin I stay lit like church candles
keep a fifth in my hand cuz business still gets handled
hit the studio in the day an the club at nite
you can tell I'm reppin right
fa sho, I'm lovin life
couldn't get no sweeter, if it was covered in chocolate
my knot is so big, I got stretch marks on my pockets
I got shit sewn up
got hooked up like a tow-truck
I got a platinum dick wit gold nuts
ant those cuts
that make you get up an groove to
my shits like an eviction notice
it's sure to move you
I prove true to all the non-believers
now chicks aint tryin to see us, unless it's time to g us
I be a playa forever baby in two days
cuz I got the knot that keeps me on top like toothpaste

Chorus *(Yukmouth)*

I Can't Wait, to pull out the stretch Hum-vee
I Can't Wait, to hit the lake on 'em jet skis
I Can't Wait, to pull the drop out the candy shack
I Can't Wait, to see 'em hate when I rock my Rolex watch
I Can't Wait, to hit the summer pool parties
I Can't Wait, to watch these cops get too naughty
I Can't Wait, to bounce on 100 spokes straight laced
I Can't Wait to make 'em hate!
Cuz we gon' bubble like
An we gon' pop like
An we gon' bubble like
An we gon' pop like
Cuz I'ma bubble like
An we gon' bubble like
An they gon' bubble like
An we gon' bubble like
An make 'em hate!

Verse 2 *(Numskull aka Drink-A-Lot)*

Whens the last time we kicked it
last time we all got twisted, lit the skys up wit military bitch shit
last time top notches flooded the blocks
when the last summer came an we all had drops
when the last lion war made bitch niggas quiet
when the last time Cali had a mutha fuckin riot
shut the blocks down
make an re-write our laws
we Cali niggas, born an raised to did for the cause
when the last time Cali niggas toasted the Remmy
never wanted for nothin cuz the thug shit brought plenty
when the last time a deala had a dream to be the next Mitchell
for the title that Cali held (Yeah!)
I be the first nigga ridin for this, buckin the Benz
Payroll Family, fuck friends I'm lovin the ends
got my space an my dick, love Cali
if wasn't for the places to see, then I would die in this bitch.

*(Chorus)*

I Can't Wait, to pull out the stretch Hum-vee
I Can't Wait, to hit the lake on 'em jet skis
I Can't Wait, to pull the drop out the candy shack
I Can't Wait, to see 'em hate when I rock my Rolex watch
I Can't Wait, to hit the summer pool parties
I Can't Wait, to watch these cops get too naughty
I Can't Wait, to bounce on 100 spokes straight laced
I Can't Wait to make 'em hate!
Cuz we gon' bubble like
An we gon' pop like
An we gon' bubble like
An we gon' pop like
Cuz I'ma bubble like
An we gon' bubble like
An they gon' bubble like
An we gon' bubble like
An make 'em hate!

Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*

Nigga I don't give a fuck if ya album go 5 times platinum
you niggas talkin shit about Yuk, I gotta slap 'em
cuz they bitch made
niggas get raped then I jack 'em
smack 'em
grab a bottle of agua before I wack 'em
specalist
that go like DeVito in Casinos but respect my shit
by niggas that pull equal off kilos an be wettin shit
wit desert eagles tell policio to invest my shit
but they could never fuck wit the MOBB
we represent them drive bys, homicides
niggas be sniffin sherm
an some niggas be smokin fry
westside til I die
gettin mine as you gettin yours
I'm down wit Houston like Scottie Pippen dumpin on niggas rippin boards
I hittin whores rippin tours
this year I'm gettin 4 in The Source what they hittin for?
Double Up like Mase nigga
I replace niggas
erase niggas
buy weight an migrate to ya state nigga!

*(Chorus)*

I Can't Wait, to pull out the stretch Hum-vee
I Can't Wait, to hit the lake on 'em jet skis
I Can't Wait, to pull the drop out the candy shack
I Can't Wait, to see 'em hate when I rock my Rolex watch
I Can't Wait, to hit the summer pool parties
I Can't Wait, to watch these cops get too naughty
I Can't Wait, to bounce on 100 spokes straight laced
I Can't Wait to make 'em hate!
Cuz we gon' bubble like
An we gon' pop like
An we gon' bubble like
An we gon' pop like
Cuz I'ma bubble like
An we gon' bubble like
An they gon' bubble like
An we gon' bubble like
An make 'em hate!
