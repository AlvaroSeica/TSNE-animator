[Intro: Tweety Bird sample]
Watch out for that first step, mack
It's a lou lou!

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, life is a bakery, smoke til I cough up a lung
Got a mean 'aftermath' like Andre Young
Milky way rock, socks with the face of Versace
Times Square posters of me and John Gotti
Snipe with the rif-les, double pump shotty
Coked up, slumped over with my nose all snotty
Twenties on the back of the whip, tens in the front
Ski goggles on the Benz, with the engine in the trunk
I'm a gangsta, the shoes on my whip got chips
And I lived down the block, because of some slipped disk
Rock on wrists, new key slang vocalist
'04, putting bailey's on the heads of these terrorists
Saddam's gon' get it, Ladin's gon' get it
Al Qaeda's gon' get it, ya'll all gon' get it

"Lou Lou!"

[Lounge Lo]
Do what I do, when it gots to be done, I do it
Smack up the cops and let my duns say "Son, you stupid"
I know I'm crazy and gone, that's why my gun'll do it
Cappadonna and Ghostface told me to run right through it
And I'm back on the block, grinding, the same time
Niggas acting like I won't stick you up for them same diamonds
And it's me O.B.B., ya'll niggas wanna see me?
Catch me on the cable TV, and B.B. keep it easy
Staten Island, the fullest, with ratchets and bullets
I blow his top, and send his face, to the back of his hooded
Steal his coke, take it back to the dope, I hope not
Niggas, don't tell no role, cuz Lounger Lo got it
I'm back in the business, I'm back with hard, it's nice
Back with the soft, and my dimes look like they twice
Why you fronting and stunting, and be about nothing
Rocking red, throwing up signs, just like you blood or something

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Homey, what up homey, huh?
This is Yessa Yessa My Lord
Ya'll know what it is
I'm dealing with Teddy, right now
Ya'll understand that, man
LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU-LOU
O.T.F., bastards "It's a Lou Lou!"</pre>
