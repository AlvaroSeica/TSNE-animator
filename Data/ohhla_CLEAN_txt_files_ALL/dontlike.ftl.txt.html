[Verse 1]
Man I can't stand Hussein, put that punk to sleep
That nigga fucked my little sister at the comfort suite
Got her pregnant and everything, and he ain't even claim it
I do it for any price right now just name it
10 years ago he rapped with Pac, he still think he famous
Though Ima roll em over with the stainless
Look at him stuntin, frontin over there at the bar, like a star
He ain't even got a car and they get in clubs they charge
But maybe thats why he's hood?
Fuck that nigga, I heard he treat his lil homies no good
But thats the nigga they kill fo, and Ima keep it real though
The Outlawz jerked him, so he ain't really getting real dough
Fuck that he got something, and I wann take it
I ain't hating, because he got put on, but I wanna make it
This nigga rollin thru the hood like he Akbar, prayin somethin
Everybody feelin him, so ain't nobody saying nothin
Fuck that shit, he gonna die like me
Around here I ain't trying to let him shine like me
So when I catch him
Ima stretch him
And put him where he suppose to be
I hate him, and I don't want that pussy nigga close to me

[Chorus]
I don't like that nigga, I should kill him right now
I don't like his style, and he always stuntin, that nigga foul
I should kill him right now man, I don't like that nigga, he stay in the hood
Big guns, heavy everyday in the hood
I don't like that nigga, that nigga foul
I should kill him right now

[Verse 2]
He so real, its a goddamn shame
Some fake thugs in the hood want a bullet in his God damn name
But when they see him in person, they repeating his verse's
Telling him how he hott, and if he don't eat then its worthless
So go ahead try to snapp on him
Im going to leave that warnin
Just seen him in Tabel lounge with the mack on him
With a couple of the homies from uptop
Pine street bloodz, across the street on the busstop
Just waitin for you suckers to inch wrong
I saw the haters standing there with the waist slim chin chon
Fuck that, somebody needs to stop him before I do
You know the rule all the time, but he ain't poppin from my crew
That nigga better stay out of the hood
And I ain't bullshitin, he better stay as faraway as he could
Any questions he got, Ima answer with the fourty
At Deco lounge wit shoes on, dancin with my shorty
I heard, I knew that
Maybe she pushed up on a nigga? na shorty wouldn't do that
But I'm talking about the way he be out
Starin at me, ridin by shooting rocks, like he playin me out
And his boyz don't even like him, I know some niggas from the 'Clair
Quite, humble niggas use to sit up on the tier
And talk about him wrecklessly
So I know he a snake, I don't want that nigga next to me

[Chorus]
I don't like that nigga, I should kill him right now
I don't like his style, and he always stuntin, that nigga foul
I should kill him right now man, I don't like that nigga, he stay in the hood
Big guns, heavy everyday in the hood
I don't like that nigga, that nigga foul
I should kill him right now

[Verse 3]
Man that nigga always talking about the shit that he touched
All the shit he did with his man, and all the bitches he fucked
I wish Kadafi wouldve never introduced him to Pac
I know that nigga,they called him Dirty Bruce on the block
But wasn't he getting money with some nigga named rich
Yea, but after that he was back to the same shit
All of them niggas changed, man all of them niggas strange
He came around this bitch, and took all of them niggas range
Ain't nobody say shit, but they talking it now
Finny Mitchell had some niggas in the park on the ground
And he ain't get on the floor, he played his part with a frown
Yea but my party going to stomp me down
He the best thats what it is, Ima call for his crown
And I ain't know him back then, so Ima start with him now
I bought a brand new fourty, when I see him its on
I ain't only blowin the horn, Ima leave him a storm
Ima do his ass dirty, in the evilest form
Next time you hear about him, I guarantee you he gone
This nigga rollin thru the hood like he Akbar, prayin somethin
Everybody feelin him, so ain't nobody saying nothin
I don't like that nigga</pre>
