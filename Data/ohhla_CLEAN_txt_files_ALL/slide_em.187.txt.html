(*talking*)
Uh uh, putting it down
Big T, million dollar hook man y'all
I'm on the rise baby, ya know
For real, ain't no stopping this year baby
Know I'm tal'n bout, turning some corners
Huh, check it out

[Hook: Big T]
First we fall up in the club, then we turn it out
Throwing bows from wall to wall, slide niggaz in the parking lot
Niggaz always talking down, then they pull they glocks
For them boys can get it hot, we knocking them niggaz out

[D-Capo]
Boys know how Capo, fall up in the club
Pint in my hand, on my hip is the slugs
Sipping on the mud, blowing Presidential bud
Presidential club, with the Presidential buzz
It's the residential thugs, skipping in your place
Buying up the bar, getting Henny by the case
Putting it in they face, I can see they funny gestures
I turn 'em black and purple, like the x-testa
Like Chester, they see the cheese
They wanna test a G, and see the B's
Not me not us, cause I ain't having it
I'll let the glock bust huh, and let 'em have it
They mad, cause they ain't having it
Turning out the club, taking over the establishment
Cool management, all haters at the do'
All hoes get naked, all marks gotta go

[Hook]

[Kevo]
I toss a dub at the do', and ease on in
What it do, y'all let a playa squeeze on in
I'm just trying to turn a toe or suntin, throw a bow or suntin
Snatch your hoe, and let go on suntin
I spit at 'em all, short slim thick or they tall
If niggaz involved, I'ma fill my 'fit with 'em all
See a star at the bar, sipping Henny and Hypnotic
7 in her face, but her ass and hips got it
Said she been bout it, and ready to show
Smoking like a freight train, going hard on dro
All I know, niggaz better give me some room
Before I squeeze on my baretta, and give 'em a wound
Exit style, get a dime exit out
Doing Kama-Sutra with her, and X her out
All these niggaz in my face, need to find 'em a broad
Cause as soon as I catch me one, I'm going find my car

[Hook]

[Lyrical 187]
Let's go to the hole in the wall, fuck that
Lets spark up in Max's, and get it got it attacking
Blow a ounce in the back of the club, with the law
They recognize real niggaz, plus we don't barre
Wasted so clean, starched down jeans
The scene switched over, once we came through the do'
Niggaz mean mugging, handcuffing they hoes
Boppers on the dance flo', putting on a show
Hey DJ, put on one of my songs
These boys hating, got these hoes showing they thong
Bout 25 deep, it's bout 3 in the morn'
X'd out the after hours, too crunk to be on
Niggaz in the parking lot, bumping they gums
That nigga get 'em carried out, and risked the alarm
I Presidential roll, on over to the Mo'
And they naked in the back, rolling up my dro
