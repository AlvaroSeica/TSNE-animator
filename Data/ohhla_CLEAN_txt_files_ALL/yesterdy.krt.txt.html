[Intro]
"Speak up for them
 Your friends, your relatives, your neighbors
 It's a good idea to speak up for them
 and it's always good to thank God"

[Chorus]
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
Yeah, I know it sound cliche, and they tell me just to pray
But I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
Yeah, I know it sound cliche, and they tell me just to pray
But I miss you like yesterday

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Early morning
Whipping up breakfast, so unexpected, I'm barely yawning
Iron my school clothes, food up on the stove
Biscuits was hella fluffy, Grandma I need two of those
You whisper, wait for my brother, Papa do what you say
'Fore a crumb could hit my tongue, tell me to pray
Scrape my plate, wash the dish
Be prepared for the world and be thankful of the time that I get
to be young on the run
Don't be eager to be grown, have some fun
You'll look back when you turn twenty-one
like, my time flies
Wishing you were here by my side

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Like an autumn breeze
knocking all the pecans out the trees
Baking your fruitcakes for Christmas Eve
The smell of sweet potato pie make it hard to leave
Sit and reminisce
Out the grab bag, everybody got a gift
Just be thankful for the thought, don't be giving lip
We laugh and cry
You knew you couldn't save the world, but you had to try
I've been doing the same
Just so you know, your lectures ain't going in vain
Accepted that you're gone, but I deal with the pain
Weather the rain
Just know I won't be the same, cause

[Chorus]</pre>
