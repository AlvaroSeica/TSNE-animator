Silkk &amp; (Mercedes) talkin:
you ain't da one talkin' all da mess right
(who me)
ya girl
(ain't said notin)
well you been saying something
(you wanna know).....

Mercedes verse 1 singing:
i, i like your style
and i can see the freak in you
we could hook up around 2
so i could put this thang on you
don't know, just what you got yourself into
with me, i'll fufill all of your fantasies

Silkk The Shocker/(Mercedes) rapping:
shorty you got what i need right
i'ma see if you one of a kind
heard ya all the time went from
one and dropped to nine like shit, fuck
(it ain't gonna never stop)
dazed and tossed, my leg is long  
i want you alone, after da date takin' ya home
take the phone off da hook, cause i'm off da hook 
(nigga what what what)

Mercedes-Hook:
i, i got what you need (iiiiiii) (got what you need)
get me over here (get over here) (come and see me)
so you can see 
just how i am between the sheets
if you got da time, i'll fufill your fantasies

Silkk The Shocker rapping:
what you wanna do i'll do cause i'm bout it bout it
that means that i'm wit it wit it
but you gonna find out right after i hit it, hit it
you get crunk and shit after i get it, get it
then you can tell every one 
that you and  silkk did it, did it
it don't take much to fuck, fuck
hook a nigga up, shit, don't screw a nigga up
have you ever fucked wit a thug, thug
back rubs, and bath tubs 
feel it going down when i
find da place to touch, touch
have you ever fucked with a solider
fantasies fufilled when i come over
we can do it on the hood of the range rover
if it's not anough, more more, to much, yes yes
if it's bad yell no no, good yell yes yes

hook

Mercedes/(silkk the shocker):
(everything you need lady)
anything you need baby
(got what you need baby)
make me drop to my kneez and make you scream baby
(what you wanna do baby?)

(fantasies fufilled)
really
(it could happen to you baby)
