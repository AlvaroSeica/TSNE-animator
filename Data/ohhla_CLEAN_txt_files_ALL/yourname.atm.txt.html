Hey, how you doing? Ain't seen you in a long time
Is everything all fine?
Doing your best? I'm glad to hear it
It's all progress, yeah that's the spirit
Look at you, you look great
It seems like you kept yourself in good shape
You stopped drinking? Huh, congratulations
You back in school too? That's fascinating
So what you doing nowadays?
You living here again or just visiting for the holidays?
Yeah, yeah, how's your family?
How's your mommy and daddy? They living happily?
So tell me all about L.A.
Huh? You don't live in L.A.? Hold up, wait, wait, wait
Chicago, how's Chicago? What? No?
Well where are you living then? Ohhhhh
My fault, please forgive me
Bad memory, so how's the big city?
You paying dues? You making moves?
Yeah I always knew someday you'd break through
You forever been a go-getter
and I won't forget that, bet that I'll remember
I never told you this
But I wish you the best success and all that other shit
But that's my cue, I've got stuff to do
It was a special surprise to bump into you
Stay safe, you have yourself a great day
Wait, what was that? What you say?
A phone number? Nah, I don't think so
I only gave it to a handful of close people
Let's not make this into an issue
But the truth is, I don't miss you

La la la la la, I will disappear
La la la la la, no far and no near
La la la la la, you are not my dear
I don't care where you go from here
La la la la la, I will disappear
La la la la la, no far and no near
La la la la la, you are not my dear
There's no tears next to your name here</pre>
