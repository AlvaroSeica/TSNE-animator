[Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh]
Said its my desire, yes it, yeah
yes it, yes it is, oh yeah, yeaaaah

Comprehend the guidelines
My chest out chinchilla all relaxed on the sidelines
I'm so famous
Understand, New York City respects my game like Joe Namath
And I protect my name like your anus
In prison, y'all don't hear me
Y'all don't listen
Y'all just wanna shine
Y'all just wanna glisten
Floss, knowing that the soul is still missing
(Who am I?) I am the poetical pastor
Slave to a label but I own my masters
Still get it poppin' without artist &amp; repertoire
Cause Monch is a monarch only minus the A&amp;R
When my brain excels, your train derails
Pop shit, make you feel the Clipse like Pharrell
You will feel me
You will admire
(My) Struggle
(My) Hustle
(My) Soul, Desire

Ooooooooooooh, Said its my desire, yes it, yeah
[Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh]
Said it's my desire, yeah

My book is a ovary
The pages I lust to turn
My pen's the penis
When I write the ink's the sperm
Desire, the fire that ignites the torch to burn
This is not rocket science
This easy to learn
My mic's the gavel
When I talk courts adjourned
Respect, even if you were ashes you couldn't earn (urn)
I embody antibiotics
You are infected with germs
Rap's fatally ill, please get concerned
Players, pick turns to play, get burned
I color commentate the game like chick perms
This is the moment of truth for my opponents &amp; liars
Talk is alone invoke the emotion of black choirs
Fire, you don't wanna get burned like Rich Pryor
Move back, who's that, there, the live wire
You will feel me
You will admire
(My) Struggle
(My) Hustle
(My) Soul, Desire

Said it's my desire, yes it, yeah
Yes my desire, people should keep fighting
My passion, my fire
Yes my desire, people should keep fighting
[Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh]
Yes my desire, people should keep fighting
[Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh]
Yes my desire, people should keep fighting
[Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh]</pre>
