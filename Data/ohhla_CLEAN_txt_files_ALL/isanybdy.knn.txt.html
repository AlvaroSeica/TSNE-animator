Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Nelly Furtado]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side

[K'Naan]
Something 'bout mary
Never won a pageant
Never felt pretty
Never looked like cameron
Diaz was her last name
Always been abandoned
Keep your head up

Baby girl this is your anthem
There goes hannah
Showin' off her banner
Rocking that crown
Make them boys go bananas
When you're insecure about yourself
It's a fact
You can point a finger
But there's three pointing back
I can see her crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?

She's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now she could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
She's crying for your love tonight
Lonely is hard to survive, she said

[Nelly Furtado]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side
Is anybody out there? yeah, yeah, yeah

Is anybody out there?
(somebody, anybody)

[K'Naan]
His name was adam
When his mom had him
Dad was a phantom never took a look at him
Grew up mad and antisocial
Hated outdoors, always in playing madden
Adam was lonely
Drugs were the only
Way out of his own life
Now he's slowly losing his fire
Close to retire
With one last hope he puts his arms up higher
I can see him crying out, yeah
Is anybody out there?

He's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now he could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
He's crying for your love tonight
Lonely is hard to survive, he said

[Nelly Furtado]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side
Is anybody out there?

[Bridge]
If you feel the way I feel
Like you've been talking to yourself
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible
Lonely in a crowded room
Searching for someone like you
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)
Is anybody out there?
(somebody, anybody)
Is anybody out there?
I'm right here for your
Is anybody out there?

[Outro]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side
Is anybody out there? yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna do it all alone
I need your love to take me home
No one said you should be all alone
I'm right here
Is anybody out there?</pre>
