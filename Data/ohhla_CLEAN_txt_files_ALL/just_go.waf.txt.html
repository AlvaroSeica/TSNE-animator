[Wafeek]
Yeah; don't ask questions just go
Just go {*3X*}
Don't ask questions just go
Do what ya told baby
That's right bitch, do what ya told
That's right bitch, do what ya told baby
That's right bitch don't ask questions just go

Music is a storefront church
Used to be the liquor sto', now it's where you chil'ren grow
Up thinkin miracles'll heal 'em when they hurt, no
Prayin for some mo' won't work
When you wanna be rich, why you livin and famous, when you're dead?
That's what Gabriel said, he's the angel of death row
You will know my name is the Lord
Cause I came in the door like don't ask questions just go

Hey, hey, just go
Just go {*2X*}
Don't ask questions just go
Do what ya told baby
That's right bitch, do what ya told
That's right bitch, do what ya told baby
That's right bitch don't ask questions just go

Let me get it and quit it all on the first date
Play like I really committed to get to first base
Shit and second and third base, are first rate
Drink straight Henny and party my way to home plate
Her main nigga stay, runnin game every day
Reppin St. Louis mayne, gettin paid anyway
If he hate, then he may, catch a stray, to his face
Police ain't investigatin don't ask questions
I'm a ventriloquist, keep my mouth closed mayne
Ghostwritin for dubbies 'til I'm a household name
Openin doors provide them hits
I'm like a blind man tryin to ghostride the whip
Got a Peter Pan complex, I'm fly as shit~!
Be a man, fuck the childishness, it's Feeky man
In a war with them super negroes
That turn small white to big green like Lou Ferrigno

Just go!
Hey, just go
Just...
Don't ask questions just go!
Do what ya told baby
That's right bitch, do what ya told
That's right bitch, do what ya told baby
That's right bitch don't ask questions just go</pre>
