"I'm makin moves kid"
"Get greedy"

[Verse 1: Muph]
One two now
Two-minute noodles and a pair of chopsticks
Tryna get a dollar off the floor of the moshpit
And fossick through all these dirty pants pockets
Lately, thinkin that maybe it doesn't pay to be honest
Go ahead, take me to the office
I'll be straight through the gate to the doctors
All good, got what I wanted
Sponsored by burn and I earnt my knowledge
To be honest, at points I'm still strugglin
Fridge with no food, booze isn't bubblin
I'm in trouble again so come on my friend
And lend me a hand out, don't just stand around
While a man is down on his luck, stuck
Couldn't get a bang out my buck
And I'm just lappin it up, actin as if I'm happy as fuck
Cause I am

{*Scratches*}

[Chorus: Paul Williamson]
Just getting by, but smilin like I'm filthy rich
In this life and time, dreamin of the finer things

[Verse 2: Muph]
You see, we live limited but livin it well
Breakin the perimeters? Guess time will tell
Deprived of our innocence, got vinyl to sell
No wife, no dinner set, better tighten the belt
Hell, might as well be tellin the truth
The way I see it, we ain't got a lot to lose
Aside from friends, fam, independent views
What we've got is a lot of units to move
That's what has got me just losin my screws
Late payin the rent, another useless excuse
Like Cujo, know that I'm ruthless with food
Watch TV through PC on YouTube
I could really do with a pair of new shoes
Some phone credit, I don't need your bluetooth
I'm too smooth, how I manage to cruise through
And get to the top of game with low loot, true

{*Scratches*}

[Chorus: Paul Williamson]
Just getting by, but smilin like I'm filthy rich
In this life and time, dreamin of the finer things
Just getting by, but smilin like I'm filthy rich
In this of mine, I'm dreamin of the finer things
