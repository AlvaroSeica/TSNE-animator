[Earl Sweatshirt]
Yo... it's Earl, Mr. Early Bird, gets them girls with curvy curves
Skate mental, trunk smack a faggot in his Shirley Temple
Your rhymes rentals, give 'em back to they owners
At the end of the bar I, spit with the permanents
Learn I'm a curb stompin person
Like third strike verdict droppin jaw droppin verses
This bigger lips in person nigga spits some burn so earn the shit
Furnish the flow until my pockets green, Kermit's dick
The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass
I control them like your eyes when I'm tinkin a glass
So if you thinkin about dissin, stop thinkin it fast
cause my Wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, hoe
The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass
I control them like your eyes when I'm tinkin a glass
So if you thinking about dissin, stop thinkin it fast
cause my Wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, bitch

[Chorus]
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Wait, where you goin? What you doin tonight?
Just want to know what you doin, come back
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Where you goin? What you doin tonight?
Stop runnin, where you goin, what you doin?

[Earl Sweatshirt]
It's Earl, Mr. Lateshift, rapist in trainin
Who edge about as straight as some clay closet gay dick
Ray say hey Earl's a real charmin racist
Your birthday day, have some KK-Kake bitch
Habit have it grab it fast and attack it faggot
I'm above average like I'm rappin in the attic, yeah
I'm crouched in the basement shoutin "Couch" is the greatest hit
Dirty as a anus is, fans stand in rain for this
They even stand in sleet season until they fuckin feet bleeding
Hail and fuckin snow, in hell with fuckin coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make them bow down until they muh'fuckin necks hurt
Fans probably stand in sleet season until they fucking feet bleedin
Hail and fuckin snow, in hell with fuckin coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make them bow down 'til they muh'fuckin necks hurt

[Chorus]

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Mr. Deerskin Mocassins is on the fuckin stalk again
Followin and stalkin all them Larchmont soccer chicks
Choppin limbs, gnawin legs through they fuckin' stockings
Him his Grandfather Sweatshirt, clockin' all them cardigans
Product of popped rubbers and pops that did not love us
So when I leave home keep my heart on the top cupboard
So I will not stutter when I'm shoutin "Fuck you, son"
Wolf Gang 'bout it, we ain't waitin 'til the moon come
Woo son, the moonshine it got feelin loose
as the puss of a whore who's used to abuse
My, screw's pretty loose mind fucked like the hair-doos
of doo-doo mamas, dude I will bear jew you
You unripe fruit dudes is crews to chew through
My niggas wash 'em down with a fat carton of Yoohoo
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, fuck 'em all
No lube, it's the crew to get used to
