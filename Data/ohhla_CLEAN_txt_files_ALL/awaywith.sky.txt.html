[Chorus]
Oh I will take you away with me
As far as I can
Every sky would be blue
Long as you lovin' me

[Verse One]
Listen
The world could explode
For all that I care
Cause I'm alone with you
Think they could clone you too?
It may be too much but I'm willing, I put my money on it
You think I'm crazy, right?
You make me lady like
Like, wanting to wear lace
Wanting to say, "yes" 
To giving into you, intimacy is painless
It's easier to keep runnin' than switchin' faces up
Okay, I'm stuck
Do you hate me or what?
I wanna date you, go steady and wear your letter pin
Or your letterman sweater like Ola Ray but I'm hesitant
Not you
It's me 
Now I'm a clich√©
Wanna bend, plead for you 
Flip positions as a ? do
Just gotta relay truth 
I love to be together, breathe together
Jean say, "Soon, 
We could be forever
see whatever we make bloom."
Just afraid I could be playin' out a replayed tune
Look at you

[Chorus]
Oh I will take you away with me
As far as I can
Every sky would be blue
Long as you lovin' me

[Verse Two]
Attention span was A.D.D.S.
Before we met, on occasion was frequent
I know how deep I get in emotional reconnect
I'm bring up baggage like conveyor belts and Learjets
Or bellboys at the telly
We chillin' in till noon
Revealing the city below us, incredible views
We're feeling the feeling below us I'm intending to
I've never felt this safe I gotta hand it to ya
As the phrases escape 
I'm breakin hand quiver
Must be candid 
Thus, there's no damaging
Plus, be no standards in love be lust, yes
What's best for me never seems to ever be what's next to me
Exception
You
So excuse me if I question too
Thorough
Or keep you waiting I might
Break down, shake defense off
Change mind, change clothes and take the weekend off

[Chorus]
Oh I will take you away with me
As far as I can
Every sky would be blue
Long as you lovin' me</pre>
