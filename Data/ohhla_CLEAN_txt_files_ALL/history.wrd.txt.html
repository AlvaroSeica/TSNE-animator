[Werd]
Well you can have allot of knowledge
You can have allot of knowledge from books
But do we know if thats the truth
Or is it just one point of view

[Jordan Butler]
Aesthetic practices relaxes me perceive a state to elevate
I graduate from hate and contemplate my thoughts romantically
I touch upon a side of me that people rarely see, or could believe
The theories I conceive I born and breath
When moments flee I often wonder through the forest
But Im blinded by the trees, self absorbed, touches bring me back
Im kissed from the breeze, 
Calm and at peace, at least a moments like these
When philosophies ease of off subject of me
Invert my mind to gaze at inner eye projects obverted
And then I battle through perplexities to see the truth and mysteries
Hidden from my vision but lingering right in front of me
In the dark, my only light, I hold the chain of a unicorn
Comfortably secure Im in the safest of company
Though the whisper he's the sinister a figure of heraldry
Represented from the Scots and just as ancient as man
Symbolic of our oppression always tethered and bound
At the summit of heaven on the crest of an English crown
Around his neck a sign of souverance, still pressing us down
At times Im deep I further contemplate on life
Plus the prospect of time, knowledge long lost, to the sands
But till it resonates, just to drop gems in the mind
And if you seek then you will find, solace and reflection
Through the eye you hold inside (through the eye you hold inside)

[Werd]
Lets talks Caledonian from times Babylonian
Existed yet restricted information we know within
Until English controlling them, our leaders condoning them
The Monarch of our nation played it basic with chosen sins
That sing to the masses and lock up the truth
Put a lion on your arms as you lie to the youth
Put Christians in masses and teach them whats good
And put chains on our symbol as its misunderstood
Should, you want to turn to a soldier
And fight for the Windsor, the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
Know that youre lower and just exist
Since the Romans and Germans started landing their ships
Im conscious Pontius Pilate was a Scot
But connection of Scotland and Judea was lost
When crucifixion brought a new law to our eyes
History in disguise
