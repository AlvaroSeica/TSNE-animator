Yo
You ever wish you never were born?
Thinkin you can't the weather the storm
That's exactly where I reside
And I don't wanna commit homicide
Everything I thought was the truth
was all just a lie, a product of my pride
And if I don't achieve what nobody believes
I can achieve then we all gon' die
Either outcome is horrible of course
But as we both know it's par for the course
I think about the slums I'm from
Folks are out there fightin over crumbs
And I can't do a thing to assist it
The gist is it's broke, I can't fix it
I struggle to find the truth
And the more I know I get more confused
Traveled the world and back and still I know
nobody that could ever walk in my shoes
Searchin for who I think is the enemy
Every day he reminds me more of me
So to anyone I ever did wrong
I wish you well, pray you live long
As for me, my choice was made
Way back in the day, that's why I say

Yo
Ever wish you didn't have to wake up?
Lay in bed, eyelids could stay shut
That's exactly how I'm feelin now
But I know I can't caise that's not my style
Everything I shoved in the closet
is now fallin out and makin a big pile
And if I don't believe that I can achieve
the impossible I need to sit down
Either outcome would be a let down
Got to dig deep find self respect now
I think about the past, what I did to me
Those who passed on who now live through me
who didn't take action
Livin like a coward, that just ain't crackin
The more I know I get more frustrated
Gotta press on caise we must make it
I'm searchin for who I think are my true friends
Tryin my best to tie up these loose ends
So to anyone I ever loved
Sometimes you gotta go through hell to reach heaven above
Now, all of the times I didn't listen
and all the friends I lost man I miss them
The only medicine for suffering
crime and the woes of mankind is wisdom
Heard a man say the mind is a prison
Possessed on a quest just tryin to find religion
Too much heartache
Lead 'em to the water but can't make 'em partake
808's, autotune, and mad heartbreak
Heart race fast like it's in a car chase
Feelin like Biggie on midnight, March 8th
Top of the world 'til you starin in God's face</pre>
