Yeah

(Yeah)
Say what
(Yeah)

Come on

Yeah

Say brother

It's all good

[ VERSE 1: Al Skratch ]
Uptown, summer in the city
85 degrees and the girls are lookin pretty
Yo, check it as I wreck it
I love the summertime, that's when fine girls get naked
I slide in my ride and let my drop-top down
Pump up my block, stopped by a cop clown
On my corner, now what he wanna do?
Hold me up for a few cause my car is brand-new
Ran through one light? Not did I ever
I'm just makin money, ain't nothin funny, it's sunny as the weather
Since I'm in the right not the wrong, check it
They go oop-oop, move along, be gone
So I do, as I search for my crew
We got a job to do at the barbecue
By the swimming pool makin women drool as I kick it
I'm drinkin and I'm thinkin I'm addicted
But to which one honey bun wanna get done
Layin in the sun sippin rum havin fun
Come one, come all, we can all have a ball
When it's summertime and we all feel fine

[ CHORUS ]
(It's all good)
Yeah
(In the summertime)
Say what?
(It's all good)
When
(In the summertime)
What we doin now?
(We gettin together)
Say what
(Having fun
Keeping that love)
How we keepin it?
(one on one
It's all good)

[ VERSE 2: Al Skratch ]
Bounce downstairs to my stoop to chill
I see my man Ill in his Coupe DeVille
He say, "Yo what's up Al, now what you wanna do?"
I said, "I got the money for the Buddha if you got the brew"
He said, "Yeah, come on jump in
Let's head down to the beach for a swim"
Now you know how I'm behavin, troop
When I see them fine hoochies in they bathing suits (right)
Walkin by, lookin all fly
I gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie, I
Like it a lot when it's hot
125th Street, that's the spot
In Manhattan, yeah, cause it's happenin
At Harlem Week you can find nuff action
Madballs, 156 corner crew
Where everyday life is shoot dice, drink brew
When the sun shine it's fine Uptown
It only get better as the sun goes down
I'm Al Skratch and I'm back with another rhyme
In my hood it's all good when it's summertime

[ CHORUS ]

Yeah
As we move along
on cruise control
with some soul, y'all 
for the summertime
It's all good
Yeah
Now all my homies say
(It's all good in the summertime
It's all good in the summertime
Getting together having fun
Keeping that love one on one
It's all good in the summertime
It's all good in the summertime
Getting together having fun
Keeping that love one on one
It's all good)</pre>
