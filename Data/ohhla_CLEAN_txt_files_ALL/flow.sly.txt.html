[Verse 1]
Dippin' in the 'lac with the limosine tint
It's the three piece polyester pinstripe pimp
Fresh out the mo mo', creepin up the hoe stroll
In slow mo', this motherfucker so cold
With his brim on tilt, he be leanin' to the side
With his eyes overwired for hoes that try to hide
At the crack of nightfall this nigga be whitewallin'
Issuin' sitations for wreckless eyeballin'
This nigga so cold he be leavin' these hoes frozen
Throwin' elbows with foes and bulldozin'
Tailormade clothes for Joes is highrollin'
Hoes wait to be chose, on the sidewalk posin'
Comatose from me dosha overdose
With hoes from coast to coast, I'd like to propose a toast
To the big boss playa, pullin' fast dough
Patrolin' the block, steady clockin' the cashflow

[Hook]
(He got flow) He lit a blunt without a flame, in the rain
You can tell by the way he be kickin' his game
(He got flow) Ghetto superstar with neighbourhood fame
(He got flow) With a forty, takin' Mary Jane to the brain
(He - got - flow) Cause he be jackin' his jaw with no flaws
Without a pause, sweaty balls and dirty drawers
(He got flow) Inconspicuously breakin' the law
(He got flow) Whether it summer, spring, winter or fall
He got soul, this nigga be cold
as the ice on top of the globe
When he roll the dice, so precise
???, Hold it on the d-low
He so fine, this nigga be fine
that's why he's a shinin' dime
Top of the line, one of a kind
Multiplied by a thousand times

[Verse 2]
He got the best to accomidate your fetish, that's no question
He got a variety of ?? in his posession
Exotic flesh with the excellence of perfection
He got the finest quality, top choice selection
A chocolate nubian treat that's so sweet
She could put a tweakin' street creepers beef straight to sleep
With a physique that's so sleak she can study your speech
Police be breakin they necks to take a peak with a screech
Got a japanese diva with an immaculate stack
That's got his back in the back of a cadillac, on her lap a dirty strap
A Butter Rican Pican with an ass that's so fat
And a big booty white bitch that act blacker then Bernie Mac
Camatose from me dosha overdose
With hoes from coast to coast, I'd like to propose a toast
To the big boss playa, pullin' fast dough
Patrolin' the block, steady clockin' the cashflow

[Hook]
(He got flow) With scrill circulatin' the streets
Ill with the skill to rock a crack baby to sleep
(He got flow) With his pimpin tippy toes when he creeps
(He got flow) He don't cease until his flow is complete
(He got flow) He put a whole houseparty in a zone
With a fifth of yac' and a nickelsack of bammer homegrown
(He got flow) To pretty to leave these bitches alone
(He got flow) Reekin' of weed, and expensive cologne
He got soul, this nigga be cold
as the ice on top of the globe
When he roll the dice, so precise
????  Hold it on the d-low
He so fine, this nigga be fine
that's why he's a shinin' dime
Top of the line, one of a kind
Multiplied by a thousand times

He got flow
