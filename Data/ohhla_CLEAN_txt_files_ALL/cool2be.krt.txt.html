[Big K.R.I.T.]
We make it cool to be southern *5X*

OK, I'm straight up off my grandmama porch
Hollywood never, I took the southernized approach
Collard green pockets, but I southern-fried the flow
Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw
Play some John Frank shit, keep the dank lit
We swang whips, old schools like my paw-paw, you can't get
Now which motherfuckers said that we can't pimp?
I hit bitches like switches 'fore the paint flip
I can't be faded, the heart of a King, born in the 1980s
For real, you never seen a nigga like me lately
Debonair, never scared, Fred Astaire when I carry a cadence
Refrain from being lame hoe
I got a surefire way to give the game what it came fo'
A third coast nigga still busting, stop fronting motherfucker

[Chorus]
We make it cool to be southern
I'm talking bout the dirty south
Folks with the grills in mouth
We make it cool to be southern
Everybody wanna ball nowadays
But don't nobody wanna get paid
We make it cool to be southern
Get down if you wanna
Crack a seal, blow on some marijuana
We make it cool to be southern
Return of 4Eva all day
Them country people feel what I say
We make it cool to be southern

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now let me take you down this country road, country flow
Country folk, country-fied, twenty-fo's
on the Caddy, type savvy
My player ways never fade, I got 'em from my granddaddy
Old school, so smooth, the type of fresh that you could comb through
or you could cut it with a butter knife
and spread it on the brain of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Off top, my drop, rims chop, no cops, drink pop
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
green lit, grain grip, bad bitch on my tip
And when she tell me, Lord knows she mean it, I
been this way since I was knee high
to a grasshopper, getting moneys in my Levi's
I mean my genes, Pine-Sol clean
Bird's eye view with my frame on lean

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Get down, get down, get down with it
Get down, get down, get down with it
Get down, get down, get down with it
Get down, get down, get down with it
I'm talking bout the dirty south
Folks with the grills in mouth
I make it cool to be southern
Return of 4Eva all day
Them country people feel what I say

[Chorus]</pre>
