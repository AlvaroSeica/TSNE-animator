Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Frank Ocean]
I believe Jehovah, Jah-rah
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
gives her the right to choose, but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you said that
you lost all faith, but you must believe in something
Something, something
You gotta believe in something
Something, something

[Chorus]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try, we all try
The girls try, the boys try, women try, men try
You and I, try, try, we all try

[Frank Ocean]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that
I lost my faith, you must believe in something
Something, something
You gotta believe in something
Something, something

[Chorus] w/ Ocean ad libs

[Outro]
Try to believe - try, just try
Try to believe - try, just try
Try to believe - try, just try
Oh I, I do believe I do believe {*fades*}</pre>
