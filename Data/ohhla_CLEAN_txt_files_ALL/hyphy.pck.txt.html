[Verse 1]
girl girl keep starin right here, yeah I think she like me
dance from the back put a couple words in her ear
can ya be my hyphy wifey?
how you doin lil pearl girl baby with da business
song just started I got a couple of minutes
you look too fly so I had to go get it
when I grab on her waist she instantly start to hit it
doin hella things she tryin to impress me
got me thinkin how I feel if ya let me
yeah I'm a sexual individual got a man well he been struck by a street criminal
girl (theives key?) for the rest of the night, we could go go go go
If it's right girl the rest of your life baby go go go go
now she keep on smilin while we havin conversations bout to make my moves
I notice that she been waitin, I been waitin too been gettin to damn impatient
but we gon' do the fool as long as the song playin

[Chorus]
take my hand and take your chance go go go
you ain't shy girl I know you wanna dance so baby go go go go
tonight you could be my hyphy wifey go go go go
baby girl fiesty like me she could go go go go

[Verse 2]
hi she he me feel-in like yee yee

I ain't gon' sweat it but I'm a get it tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
ambulance truck I go crticaly stewie, she catch on quick and she givin it to me
poppin twistin dippin yokin her booty, my partners tellin me handle it oooh wee
turn her around face to face and when night smell she can taste the grapes

[Chorus]
