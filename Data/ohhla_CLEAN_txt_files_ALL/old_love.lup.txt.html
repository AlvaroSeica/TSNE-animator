[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Give me that old school love right now (I-I love you baby!)
You know when I hold you you wont be alone

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

[Verse One: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that, late 80's early 90's old school
Feelin like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer lookin so cruel
Look shorty in the eye told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age, and if he's ever mine
Thinkin he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in presence of somebody young
Tellin him the same things, that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man, is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
What's up?!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

[Verse Two: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh! Analog black vinyl spinnin soundin so good
Top down can't be classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's and 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a double L
Had to walk 'cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12's
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want it (EEEEEEEEHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
You have to make it like that (Like that)
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
What's up?!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

[Verse Three: Lupe Fiasco]
Chiraq summer lookin so cruel
How can I reel to reel when there's pro tool
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That your going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If your life like Christ live your midlife like it's Christ like
But nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle, and everybody bike it
And France is enormous your Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to speak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through a manner so cool
Remember give a little nod to the old school
What's up?!

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Give me that old school love right now
I'm leavin it all up to you darlin, givin you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you you wont be alone

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me (I-I love you baby!)
Give me that old school love right now
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!</pre>
