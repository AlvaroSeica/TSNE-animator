[Tom plays weird guitar riff]

UGH!

UGH!
C'mon, check it

[Zack de la Rocha]
Through steel walls, your voice blastin' on
True rebel, my brother, Mumia, I reflect upon
You be the spark, that set the prairie fires on
Make the masses a mastodon path to trample the fascists on
At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine
With boots and mad guns, they tried to pacify you young
Cause and effect, smell the smoke and the breeze
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

[Hook]
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE VOICE...OF THE VOICELESS!!
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE VOICE OF THE VOICELESS!!

You see the powerful got nervous cause he refused to be their servant
'Cause he spit truth and burned like black churches
Prose and verse, a million poor in hearses
Watch the decision of Dred Scott as it reserves
So long as the rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can't ya smell the smoke in the breeze?
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free


[Hook]
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE VOICE...OF THE VOICELESS!!
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE VOICE...OF THE VOICELESS!!
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE VOICE...OF THE VOICELESS!!
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE VOICE OF THE VOICELESS!!

[*whispers*]
And Orwell's hell...a terror era coming through..
But this little brother's watching you too..
And Orwell's hell...a terror era coming through..
But this little brother's...watching you too...watching you too..
