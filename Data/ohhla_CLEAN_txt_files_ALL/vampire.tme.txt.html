I said vampire masks chasing foxes in the night
fantastic's on the phone, she's a Jim Belushi wanna be
freddy kruger shirt and a laugh like a rich girl
ice cream tastes like steak like steak, st. Joseph only costs 3 dollars
st. Thomas Aquinas and Augustus Compte are playing double Dutch
I'm wearing dickies staring at yoga girls
awareness is beating on his chest like king kong
every time we sing songs, money comes like ding dong
what's new Richard Bach's in an airplane
Rodney Mullen was Tony hawk's stunt double
my life used to be monsters, dinosaurs and king Arthur
pop-up books and role playing video games
I'ma dragon warrior, Faxanadu its the destiny of the emperor
I love my mom like Sofia Patrillo, I love my family like the golden girls
Blanche Devereaux is looking for a new man
Rose Nylund is confused as a hurricane
but Dorothy Zbornak, you are a women
ah the good days helping father with the plumbing

in this place I can swallow pills
I'm not afraid to choke
I'm not afraid to choke

overjoyed, happy, overjoyed, content
there's no need for hope and there's no need for hope

it's all peacock feathers and I'm letting you go x3
I love you but I got to let you go
it's all peacock feathers and I'm letting you go x3
I love you I just want to let you know</pre>
