Song:   Can't Get Rid of This Feeling
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm not leavin, I'm not leavin, I'm not leavin

Check it out, yeah, it's that moment when you're lost in the feeling
You ownin it, you're on top of the building
You front row with your favorite show
You love it loud and you wanna let your neighbors know
that right now, we run the town
It's our chance to dance like no one's around
Love like this come by with a buck better
did hard for your diamond in the rough
Like me, my girl, and a timeless classic
At peace with the world when the vibe is magic
Close your eyes, vision the scene and for a single moment, you'll be livin the dream
And even though it might take a while
when your song comes on, bet it makes you smile
Laughin like Martin run and tell that shit
Fact is, right now, nothing else matters, madness

I can't get rid of this feelin, I can't get rid of this feelin
So you know I ain't leavin, cause i'll be standin by you
I can't get rid of this feelin, in a world full of angels and demons
Oh, you know I ain't leavin

It's times like this that sets me off, it's when I get the feelin that lets me lost
The tune's got me so in the mood, it's like my feet just seem to know what to do
And I do set off that energy shift when I'm set adrift on memory bliss
And that ship takes me like I'm just a passenger, sendin me back like a flux capacitor
into a state where you'll dance if it's rainin, then jump with a perfect land on the pavement
For me, it's a grand in the basement, or the hairs on my next standing ovation
Feelin like a kid, back when I could win at this, back when I had the world at my fingertips
But I still got the world at my fingertips, every time I feel like this shit is limitless

I can't get rid of this feelin, I can't get rid of this feelin
So you know I ain't leavin, cause i'll be standin by you
I can't get rid of this feelin, in a world full of angels and demons
Oh, you know I ain't leavin. I'll be standin right here

This ain't no accident man, we, we stayin here
This ain't no accident man, we, we stayin here
This ain't no accident man, we, we stayin here

Oh, shit, I just fell in the vibe y'all
This thing here is a hell of a right call
It's the moment when the stars align
it's the times with your girl when your heart's combined
The harmony sings, and what it brings is a amazing
propelling me back to relive the equation
It's the wind at the last strike of the cough
when you caught the feeling you got right when it stopped
Yeah, we live life like minutes are hours and it feels
like there's somethin religious about it
But, this ain't church and I ain't preachin
This one hurt and I ain't leavin like kids at a party
crew round the barbie. That old couple that dance at the yarry
Touch the lasers, marry the beat and carry belief til you're happy to be free

I can't get rid of this feelin, I can't get rid of this feelin
So you know I ain't leavin, cause i'll be standin by you
I can't get rid of this feelin, in a world full of angels and demons
Oh, you know I ain't leavin. I'll be standin by you

We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop

This ain't no accident man, we stayin here</pre>
