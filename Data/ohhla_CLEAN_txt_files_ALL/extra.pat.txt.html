(Hook, Project Pat)
I dropped three zips, and got fifty extra
Fish scale yola, got a different texture
Stupid in the kitchen, say I'm doin extra
Plug like I'm cool, fool do me extra
Forty pounds ain't enough, I'ma need some extra
Saw a nigga flexin, she say I'm actin extra
But one bitch ain't enough, I'ma keep some extra
One strap ain't the business, I'ma need some extra

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
They say a nigga greedy cause I feel I need extra
Take it to the kitchen, whip them chickens, make 'em extra
What how I finesse and put the remix on and flex ya
Got a couple of extra bills, I'ma need some extra
Yams, grams, trap jumpin out the gym
Dope on the table, see them fish scale fins
Cell phone blowin up, fiends screamin "When!?"
Last night was boomin, re-up and did it again
These hoes say I'm flexin, talkin bout I'm actin extra
These snitches; They'll shorten they time, give you some extra
Call up my shooters; Knock 'em off, I'll pay ya extra
Run up on that pussy, give 'em a red light special

(Hook, Project Pat)
I dropped three zips, and got fifty extra
Fish scale yola, got a different texture
Stupid in the kitchen, say I'm doin extra
Plug like I'm cool, fool do me extra
Forty pounds ain't enough, I'ma need some extra
Saw a nigga flexin, she say I'm actin extra
But one bitch ain't enough, I'ma keep some extra
One strap ain't the business, I'ma need some extra

(Verse 2, Chriz Millz)
I'm pimpin all those extras; Baking soda mixture
Straight drop, one whip, two and got them extras
Girlfriend like to G-Geek, I brought some extra
Runnin through that pack, I told the plug I need some extra
Lookin real slick with the check from them extra
Love them freaky slices in the back, she do some extra
Head game and dick unless I gave her somethin extra
Shoppin sprees it proves that you've been livin at the extra
My sack was gettin low, that lic was sweet; I had to flex 'em
I'm never satisfied; I go so hard to get that extra
You sittin on your ass, expect to come up on some extra
Pussy ass niggas make it go, I'm bout some extras
Clips automatic, choppers spray, I give 'em extra
You can thank me later, extra hard on these haters
All these niggas snitchin, talkin extra on them papers
Fuckin all they slices, left they suckers with the vapors

(Hook, Project Pat)
I dropped three zips, and got fifty extra

Forty pounds ain't enough, I'ma need some extra
Saw a nigga flexin, she say I'm actin extra
But one bitch ain't enough, I'ma keep some extra
One strap ain't the business, I'ma need some extra</pre>
