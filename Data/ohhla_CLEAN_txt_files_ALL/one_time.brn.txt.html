[Lord Jamar]

And two times for my people who be givin support (Now Rule)

[Sadat X]
I'm enhancin, with the Branson slabs of hash
if the hellion pick on the black skelly
You ridin in cabs, from New Harlem and the quest fam
with two in the van, to the telly wop and you don't stop

[Grand Puba]
Uhh, you go for this like a gofer but my shit be protected
like the plastic on your grandmother's sofa
See more pennies than a loafer, push a S-500
No chauffeur, if I slide to the stouffer
Make sure I keep a prophy-

[Lord Jamar]
-lactic, mathematical tactics
We never movin backwards, attractive
To the active, mental state, and these black kids
can relate, to the shit we spit on the wax plate

[Sadat X]
The have-nots in this world is the type that lose they girl
with loose rain got stacked, but you ain't matched your mack
Them folks'll make it happen, somedays I say fuck rappin
in the Jimmy's Cafe suaree, I will play (that's right)

[Lord Jamar]

[Grand Puba]

Go and ask your niece, want a piece? Hot like fish grease

[Lord Jamar]

You fuckin with an all-star cast, Lord Jamar, Grand Puba

[Sadat X]
I'm stompin all these prices, known to blow out sales
Fly enough to be whale, with my eyes open keep the clutch
tone, everything, that I touch, I own
And I'll be here doin my thing, 'til my daughter is grown

[Grand Puba]
I be the minnnnd bogglin, iced tea garglin
Rhyme style thorough, collect paper like the Tri-Boro
Brand Nubian, son them cats be the blast
Time to do the math as we set it on that ass

[Lord Jamar]

And two times for my people who be givin support

[Lord Jamar]
It be the rich and the prominent that leave you lost
I be the dominant force, similar to gravitation
Follow my course of navigation, we'll earn respect
and admiration of the population pump it on yo' station

[Sadat X]
A masked man came with the quick-fast game
with the kick-ass aim, and the plan for holdin big heads
Tryin to jump two spaces and beat two different cases
I been to many places so you know this is the time

[Grand Puba]
Now I be in it to win it once I begin to begin it
Like +Tony+ I +Bennett+, faster than a New York minute
So Knowledge the Power as I devour
Snakes stand around look sour, movin slower than a country hour

[Lord Jamar]
From the days of James Brown up to Erykah Badu
Mass hysteria was nothin new, we put it down
in the midst of the abyss and likeness of God
Makin sure the course stays hard, yeah, what

[Lord Jamar]
Uhh, one time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme (yeah)
We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times (say what)
