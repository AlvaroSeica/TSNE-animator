Word 'em up, check it out, yo..
1975, born, feeling warm and the world cold
Elizabeth pigeonholed blue-collar mould
Got kicked out of school at fourteen
Rolled with a bad scene, smoked a bit of green
Regular shit, drifting around, rolling stone
Found a job in the abattoir, feeling alone
Jetted to the outback, trying to bounce back
Met a chick, had a couple of kids, rang dad, how's that?
Didn't quite go to plan, moved to Japan
Seeing original man dying for land
in Kosovo, Milosevic gotta go
Murdering kids, burning people in their homes proper bro
Came back less than a veteran
Thinking bout the reckoning, who is God? The benevolent
No more running, took twenty-three years
but I fucking found something that mean something, c'mon!

[Chorus: 8X]
You just move with such stamina

[Vents]
Check it out, yo..
Ay, 1999 born again, Pakistan back at school
Roll with a tool thinking about GodÕs rule
Bounced to Kabul, something to live for
Something to die for, white boy down by law
Word the fuck up, studied to kill
Physical stamina, leave your fatigue bloody for real
And I might have to cause right next door
they murdering little kids, land-mines in the floor
And I heard that they're brothers of mine
And they praise the same God, so why they try fucking with divine
law that been there before?
The same government that paid us paid them much more
And the day I got caught, said "Bro, man we one in the same"
and he put a magazine to my brain
And they sent me to the Guantanamo Bay
with a gun runner, but IÕll be out in one summer

[Chorus: 8X]

[Vents]
Yo, yo, yo.. checking out the infidel
Listen well, praying for a prison cell
Lights on, never dark, can't sleep, man this is hell
Isolated, no charge but I'm crime related
Very fucking cold and they like 'em naked
Blindfold, hoping that I fold
Make the pain a little better if you do what you're told
They torture you, who the fuck you been talking to?
Drown slow motherfucker, much more for you
Starving, they laughing, barking threats
Pointing weapons at my head, feeling half possessed
Handcuffed till my wrists numb
Five years in a black hole, no trial, nowhere to run
Dad and no mum, ain't phoning them
In a vacuum feeling like alone again
Never could sit still but when they let me out I'ma
hit the road and move with such stamina</pre>
