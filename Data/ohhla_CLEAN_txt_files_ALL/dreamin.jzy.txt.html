[Intro: Young Jeezy]
This one for the hood right here
This song dedicated to anybody out there who got some dreams
Don't give up on your dreams, real talk
Radakish
Let's go!

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn' (yeah)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn' (ay!)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn' (yeah)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Born September 28th, my life far from great
No food on the table, so we far from steak
But I'm so close to jail
Feels like I'm so close to hell
Mom smoking rocks, the same shit I'm selling
So who's wrong? Her or me?
She addicted to the high, I'm addicted to the cash
Almost put my hands on her when I caught her in my stash
How could I do her like that, Lord knows I'm wrong
Why would I do her like that, Lord knows she's strong
I know it's been hard, but we made it baby
10 years clean, so she is still my lady
I must be dreamin'...

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
(I must be)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
(I must be)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
One thing about it, I got love for you homie
Two things about it, I'll take a slug for you homie
Look at you now, your a business man
I'm proud of you dog, handle your business man
You like the brother I never ever had
You try your best, and I still get mad
We risked it all together, been through it all together
Caught cases, and we still together
Headed O.T., I see why you drive
Me and my dog, we chip in on pie
Remember back when we shared our clothes
Look as us now nigga, we sell out shows
I must be dreamin'...

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
(I must be)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
(I must be)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I was young and dumb with a pocket full of cash
Posted on the block with a pocket full of grass
Full speed, still running from my past
But it's starting to catch up, yeah it's gaining on my ass
It's two types of niggaz, preditor and prey
I'm a preditor, I pray three times a day
???? ???? Once said, one day you'll have kids
And how you going to explain all the shit you did
I'm a soul survivor, far from a crook
She always said I was a lot smarter than I look
So I, took my dreams and made it some thousands
Then I, took my life and I made it a album
I must be dreamin'...

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole] *repeat 4 times to fade out end*
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
(I must be)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
(I must be)
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'
Dreeeeaaaammiiiiiiiinn'</pre>
