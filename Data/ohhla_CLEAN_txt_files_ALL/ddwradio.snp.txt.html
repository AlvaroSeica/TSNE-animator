Pre-Verse: Snoop Dogg
It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearin' somebody tryin' to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause see my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the door

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know
Some of these fools are so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-wack, I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back (Why?)
Hit 'em up
Get 'em up
Spit 'em up (Now)
Tell me
What's goin' on
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in ozones
Known for break off, shake off, now, take off your
Clothes
And quit tryin' to spit at my {hoes}
Speaking of {hoes}
I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a {joint}
You'se a flea
And I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my {balls} with my paws
Alls
Y'alls, bustas, better recognize
And see where I'm comin' from, it's still eastside
Til I die, why, ask, why
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double G, Y
 
Chorus: The Dramatics &amp; Nancy Fletcher
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World (It's a Doggy Dogg World)

[The Dramatics] The Dogg's World
[Kurupt]        Hey

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well, if you show me ten freaks, I'll run up in all ten 
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy, sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip
I'm for the set trip, to get papers
Styles vary
Packin' flavor like Lifesavors
Ain't that somethin'
They keep talkin' and I'm dumpin' (BLAW!)
I had the fool whole block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China
You never find the bomb-a-rama then this Dogg behind ya
So peek-a-boo
Clear the way
I'm comin' through
One, two, three
You can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit, hard tactics
A menace
And I'm using 'em like tennis rackets
It's
On again
It's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A.
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton

[The Dramatics]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
It's your world
It's your world

Hook:
[Daz Dillinger]  Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party
[Tha Dogg Pound] All night long
[Daz Dillinger]  Til when
[Tha Dogg Pound] Til the early morn'
[Daz Dillinger]  It don't stop (And, uh)
                 It don't quit (For the)
                 Tha Dogg Pound clique
[Tha Dogg Pound] To drop the cavvy dough

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
Diggity Daz back up in ya out of the cut once more
So grab a seat, and grab your gin and juice, and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve those who ain't up on it
Til I die, I'm still screamin' out (I never loved that trick)
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about 
The city where I'm from
Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster hits
Tha D-O-Double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell, that's all you want
So I blaze up the {chronic}
So we can get high
I promise we smoke {chronic} til the day that we die
