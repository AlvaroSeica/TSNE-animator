Song:   Blur Bomber
Typed by: @MegaRan

[Chorus]
The blue bomber and the blur arrives
It's about time that the worlds collide
Out of all the capcom and SEGA fam
It had to be sonic and mega man
When if bad guys appear
No need to fear Blur Bombers here
When bad guys appear
No need to fear Blur Bombers here

[Random]
Somewhere in Monsteropolis
the ulitmate team up is manifested
and there ain't no stoppin this
they thought that we were opposites
rockin since the 80s and no one could alter or doctor this
consider it recompense for your loyalty
oh my Lord it seems the game gods rewarded me
me and Wilson and we back in the nick of time
soon as it was announced, they knew that I would kick a rhyme
too good to be true, too true to be denied
and this is a result when 2 different worlds collide
we both tried to make a move in the next gen
probably both would be gone if the fans
tried to stop me and pack me away
everytime they they got me, I'm back in a day
so I teamed up with Sonic, we both got a thing for blue
both got a thing to do
teachin em a thing or two, what!

[Chorus]
The blue bomber and the blur arrives
It's about time that the worlds collide
Out of all the capcom and SEGA fam
It had to be sonic and mega man
When if bad guys appear
No need to fear Blur Bombers here
When bad guys appear
No need to fear Blur Bombers here

**Shhhh**
Do you hear that sound
Thats The sound of fanboys jumping up and down
The haters in the game really hope that it's a dream but
It's for real that the boys about to team up
They love us cuz they know that we're some cold g's
And we rock man like mega mans name overseas
Glad both parties saw the vision
2 different worlds but we're on the same mission
To keep the world safe man
To stop the terror of Dr Wily and Eggman
They better bring a bigger crew in brah
They lucky that we can't do a fusion ha
That would've crazy, we would've been too
Fast aka light speeds ahead of you
You know what this song might do
Change your favorite color to dark, sky, or light blue

[Chorus - repeat]
The blue bomber and the blur arrives
It's about time that the worlds collide
Out of all the capcom and SEGA fam
It had to be sonic and mega man
When if bad guys appear
No need to fear Blur Bombers here
When bad guys appear
No need to fear Blur Bombers here</pre>
