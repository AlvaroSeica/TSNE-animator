[Verse 1]
Looks like it finally came around like the hands of a clock
Praise to Yahweh Nissi
Shout to the Banner혰Shabach
This LP is two sided혰for the man on the block
And for the flock who thinks keeping God's commandment is hot
On one side we wanna represent Christ to the Culture
Hip-Hop mostly knows Him for making tight little posters
Or a sculpture, but they can't view Him like they're supposed to
'Cause the gospel's never been preached to them like its' supposed to
And the life in Christ has never even looked like an answer
Except for locked up crooks and Big Mas with cancer
So, Ambassador is back to give you his thesis
The greatest need in Hip-Hop is the input of Jesus

[Hook]
It's the thesis we need this
The story in short
Hip-Hop properly submitted to the glorious Lord

It's problematic 'cause
It can be scary to like
But... Jesus makes everything right (2x)

[Verse 2]
My topic혰the redemption of Hip-Hop you got it
But I told you that this thesis is at least two sided
Can't just introduce Christ to the culture like an evangelist
The church needs to be schooled on hip-hop culture so plan for this
I'm a Christian admitin' were wastin' our wisdom
if we don't engage the streets, peep the nation of Islam
They promote a better culture and faith integration
But no resurrection or message of grace that can save men
So God's diggin' in the meeting place
Looking for those needing grace
To launch out from the over crowded breeding space
What will He find?
Just what He designed혰Hip-Hop's got missionaries
He brought up for these times
