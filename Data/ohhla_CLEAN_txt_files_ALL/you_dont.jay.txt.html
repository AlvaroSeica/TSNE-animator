Y'all niggaz, don't want it with a Hogg - 8x

[Hook - 2x]
You don't wanna fuck, with a Boss Hogg nigga
(naw you don't wanna fuck, with a Outlaw nigga)
Please understand, that you fucking with some G's
(I don't think they ready, for some niggaz like these)

[PJ]
Yo I'm deep in the game, doing my thang
Rule number one, always let your nuts hang
I burn like propane, leave tracks in flames
Perfect aim, put a bullet right between your brain
I'm dope like cocaine, broads calling my name
Fuck fame, all I really want is some change
I speak so unique, mouthpiece of the streets
From Texas to Tennessee, folks know about me
Tote choppers like B.G., that'll knock down a tree
Riding Lac ESV, sipping drank and kiwi
PJ is who I be, damn fools in school
I done broke all the rules, go and get you the news
I done paid all my dues, ain't no feeling my shoes
Microphones I abuse, got a head with no screws
No traces or clues, I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm a hustler I'm a soldier, I'm a motherfucking rebel
