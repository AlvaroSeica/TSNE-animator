[ VERSE 1: Sugar Kay ]
Girl, you look sweet, I wanna kiss your lip
Hold you in my arms and rotate your hip
I'm starin at your picture, wishin I was with ya
You know the deal, I could never forget ya
I always sit down and start to reminisce
About the first day we met, the first day we kissed
I always told you I wanna be an MC
And make a lotta records with the cash money
You said you was with it and everything was dear
But things started changing when my music career
Took off and went 'boom!' just like a sky rocket
The only difference is: I got money in my pocket
I'm gettin paid and the whole shabang
But without you, yo, the money ain't nothing
You doubted me as I went on tour
But you can't understand that my love is raw
If I was to lose ya, man, I'd go crazy
My man is Sugar Kay, come on, you know I love you, baby

[ VERSE 2: Mike Master ]
Girl, you know how I feel, so don't believe the hype
That rappers do shows, then skeeze all night
I'm not all about that, because I'm all about you
When I step off stage I sip a forty of brew
Sign a couple of autographs, then I'm back in my room
At the Hiatt, or should I say the Temple of Doom
Because without you happiness seems to fade
It's been a couple of days and it's a new decade
Now I feel like I spent 10 years away
Keep droppin all my problems on my homeboy Kay
Tell him what your friends tell you, then how you ignore me
You can't put every rapper in the same category
Cause a magazine prints gossip and nonsense
It's got you cold buggin, and now you're convinced
That I'm just like the others, not a true blue man
You'll understand, I'm not lookin for a one night stand
Listen close to what I'm sayin before you degrade me
Girl, you're too good for that, you know I love you, baby

[ VERSE 3: Sugar Kay ]
Girl, I'm feelin good, that's why I wrote this song
To make sure you understand that my love is strong
I said it and wrote it and you can tape it and quote it
To make sure you understand that my love is devoted
I'm in the videos and drive the fancy cars
But let me tell you now: you're my shining star
You shine all day, you shine all night
You shine brighter than a Broadway light
Girl, you don't know how much you mean to me
I'm with the Kings of Swing, but you're royalty
I appreciate every damn thing you done
You helped me get started since day one
Since I was a new jack tryin to shop out the demo tape
Me and Mike Master willin to get a break
The tables turned, now the Kings are swingin
People like the funky new music we're bringin
The money, the fortune and fame'll never phase me
I'm Sugar Kay, come on, you know I love you, baby

[ Mike Master ]
Hey yo Kay
Word 
That was smooth, you know what I'm sayin?
Our girls have to understand
It ain't all about skeezin and pleasin
And that's just one of the reasons
Why we had to write this song
He yo Terrence, take us home</pre>
