[Intro]
Yeah you know what I'm sayin, these lil flodgin ass niggaz
come down on lower level actin like they hard
Off the street ass punk! yaint bout shit nigga!
Bring that shit to the floor nigga, got 4 mo muthafuckin days nigga
go get yo ass delt with biatch!
Nigga gone get yo mufuckin ass put in a piledriver nigga
Bring it to the floor muthafucka
you cant fuck wit dis pimp nigga (woof woof grrrrrrr)
Don't get yo ass put into a motherfuckin piledriver like I said aaaaa

[Juicy J]
It started out in 201 lock down
me and paul in a holding cell
waitin to use the fuckin phone
waitin to get a fuckin bail
some people think 201 is just a place for cops and robbers
niggaz still smoke weed constantly, passing dollars
mase in your face when it's time to get buckwild
cause lawyer fees are high as hell
payin these can't even help my trial
So while I'm thinkin to myself
a nigga walked right up to me
lookin me up and down with a frown
smellin like a bottle of Crown
but I dont give a fuck
cuz this hoe gone make me make the news
for shankin niggaz in the neck
whippin guards and takin shoes
he threw up a gang sign
I turned my back didnt pay em no mind
and when I looked around again
he threw it up another time
I said yo whats up fool
is there somethin that your trying to prove
I aint wit that gang shit
he smiled and fired up a Kool
walked a little closer to me
I'ma pull them dreds up outta his head
he didnt show no violent act
but in a low tone this is what he said

[Chorus]
Killa, Killa, whatcha gonna do
get blessed in the red or get blessed in the blue
on the 34th floor they got them G's claimin true
So whatcha gonna do, young killa

[Lord Infamous]
Ya gotta have somebody watchin
Somebody else and them watchin somebody too
while you watchin everybody
cuz they ass is out to get you
no matter if you
in the dope game
or the rap game
or what situation
your in my friend
there is no such thing as a fuckin friend
maybe you out to get them secretly
they out to get you
cant no love be in yo heart
by the way fuck these hoes too
you know they just as devious as negros
that ho don't love yo ass
damn fool if you was broke she'd blow like smoke
And fuck these police ass niggaz, snitches pull the sword
Stab you in ya back for a muthafuckin reward
junky muthafuckers sittin down at the precinct
Lookin at pictures trying to indentify a nigga
On the realla man, this game is so filthy
And everybody guilty, niggaz start to tripping
so keep next to clip see
man trust is somethin that I never had much faith in
cuz fuckin wit niggaz you will end up in the state pen

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
yeah, aww shit they shine them blues up on my candy
they said somebody done dropped the dime but these
playa hatas can stand me
and now my burbons on the record at about eleven
in the back of the car, Im hope'n I see tha 9-7-11
.45 they done brought that dog
me and Crunchy eye to eye while chris be stuffin his draws
I heard a roomer that damn hound done found my stash pot
I had for juice a blow
and a infared on my .40 and a glock
aww fuck, we on our way to the duece 01 [201]
this shit was cool to rap about but now it ain't so fun
but little do they know ben's made friends
I had to spend plenty of em
but we ain't seein no payin at least this shit

[Gangsta Boo]
Nigga let me ask you are you really down wit yo game
or when you get locked up do that shit change
Now I'm comin real, tryna know the deal
bout you killas, are you just some shiesty niggaz
that hang around drug dealers
when yo ass be locked up
ho, do you be like doin chores?
for so cockin that you in
like BDs [Black Disciples] and Vice Lords
let this lady kick some knowledge
for niggaz thats full of flodgin
Its guaranteed to get fucked up
by them real mobsters killa killa killa
Whatcha gonna do, is yo color red or blue
You fucked up, you gonna get stuck up because you ain't true
For that simple reason, found you shakin, bleedin, in yo cell
now yo ass done bought a one way ticket to a burnin hell

yeah for you niggaz that's thinkin that 201 is a joke
(a muthafuckin game)

a nigga need to work that trunk ho
