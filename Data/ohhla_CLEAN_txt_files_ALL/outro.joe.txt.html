[The Nucleus]
What goes around comes around, Dark Sunz, got ya'll retreating
We do or die, ready for war, for four seasons
Winter, spring, summer or fall, we stay rocking
So even when it's cold outside, we stay plotting
We used to stay inside if it's hot, to save oxygen
Or find yourself stuck with a case to page Cochran
It's a war going on outside, the shell shocking
When Joe Maf' shit come out, your sales dropping
I spit 16, it's hot, son, regardless
Similar to flames you find behind a comet
Many try but can't succeed, what I accomplish
Atomic bomb it, cock back with fire arm shit
It's like that, I guess some things'll never change
Like, leaving ya'll niggas behind like Eddie Kane
Plus the weather forecast calls for heavy rain
So when you see my click, better tuck ya metal chains
It's like that... it's like that

[Black Bomber]
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless, cock back five now
Too mossbergs to ya chest, nappy nappy nappy nappy
Always knows best, when I grab the microphone
There's no bars left, when I hits the interstate I'm 58 West
Bound, I'm Diamond, even when I'm shining
Niggas don't really know, dough snatching Mr. Click
Trife told me nigga yo, flip that old nappy shit
Mafia, Myalan', Napoleon, we holding it
Livewire, DSC, Dark Sun, we owning this
Town, fuck your keys, we pick locks
We livewire, face the fury, forces get shock, hah

[Rashaad]
This draft fusion, off the nitrogen drop
While your megas hot, got ya'll trynna cop a loaders with no top
Smoking all, with they car locked
Figure what they call cops, will split your pea
She holding my d, hit the clutch, chick pop
Lady blew out the cops, I'm in the club grinding the dark
Watchin the thugs, drug dealers in the VA knocks
Know to see me, from these bright all sparks
I'm part of the art, number one on the charts
They saying I'm the best, but I was slung to the top
Yeah I'm taking this beyond slinging them rocks
Hoping this pop when I drop with this chicks that I rock, pry money, I saw
Too many MC's gradually ark, you know the rappers who flop
So I spill a legible plot, kick your hot
From a cold spot in my heart, lady shaking it
Keep 'em apart, feel through knot
The Source gotta give my props, my props

[Joe Mafia]
Mellow dram', from mellow dons, embezzle firearms
Megatron three fifty seven Megatron
Spread it out like Grey Poupon, three alarm blaze, you get slashed
With no reception, God, you half steppin', huh?
Concealed weapon felon war star, back against the wall
For my lifers and my deceased niggas, fuck peace
I'm meeting sweet niggas, touch and fuck 'em
Hustling reefers, since the tender age of 10, been off the deep end
Straight shots of crime, boiling the singles, in the ballpen every weekend
Front and shining, I ain't speaking, ice grill it down
We can go round for round, in my hometown
The gold town, it don't matter blocks or coliseums
Rock and glide slingers, I'm lethal
Ghetto syringe got 'em OD'ing, stuck on the run eating
Ya'll keep 'em high reaching, sagas of King Stephen
Maf' do 'em dirty like James Worthy, your crash boss
Merciless, trash and stop, drop your net worth in this
You get merked for this, in closed curtains bitten by the serpent...</pre>
