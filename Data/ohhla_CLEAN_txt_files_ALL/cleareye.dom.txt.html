[Domo Genesis]
Damn, I never pictured this
I'm so high this shit's ridiculous
... Where did I put my shit?
Wait, wait, okay, here it is
As I light this place up
Just me alone so the joints get faced up
Floatin through the stars, my whole night's all spaced up
And my thoughts tryin to build my place up
Phones buzzin so I reach and try and read it
But my vision's kinda blurry so I really can't see it
Somethin important, it might be it
or maybe a bitch that I don't need, shit
Close my eyes and the shit that I'm seein
is the reason that I be in the moods that I be in
... Damn I'm really baked
I can't tell if I'm asleep or I'm awake {*door knocking*}
I'll just sit and wait (Domo! Nigga)
Yeah, I'll just sit and wait {*more knocking*}

[Tyler, the Creator]
Nigga, open the fuckin door nigga!
Sheeit, we got shit to do
Come the fuck on, it's cold nigga

[Domo Genesis]
Let me try to sober up
Throw some water on my face, only if it's cold enough
Confidently wipe it on my shirt
Lookin in the mirror like - that ain't work, damn

[Tyler, the Creator]
Domo! Open the fucking door, what the fuck are you doing?
It's not funny no more, I'm cold as fuck nigga
I ain't got no inhaler nigga
Sheeit~! Open up

[Domo Genesis]
Okay I'm comin
Walkin to the door and I seem to notice somethin
The floor is just a cloud of smoke and I'm runnin
Reachin at the end of the cloud and I'm jumpin
Flowin through the air just about to hear somethin
Feel a lil' shake and my body start buzzin like

[Tyler, the Creator] + (Domo)
Nigga, you good? (Yeah I'm cool dog)
Talkin in your sleep and shit nigga
You trippin (Shit, my bad)</pre>
