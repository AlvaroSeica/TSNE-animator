[Verse One]
S-T what I represent, N-Y
Hold it down for my peeps in the 'ville in Do or Die
For the record let it be known - chrome for sale
and any one of these niggaz could blow your grill
Show your skill - you want war?  Hold your steel
You want more?  Unload techs, you all could feel
Raw deal, you all peel, run for the hills
Run for your shields, the battlefield's blastin at will

[Verse Two]
Smoke Dawg you know my name I'll,
be the same til the day that I'm laid down
Niggaz push me to the point's gotta spray rounds
Takin shit like for a game, actin like clowns - always playin
You ain't bustin off, just shootin the breeze
cause you scared of the repercussion after we squeeze
You ain't been through what I did just to get where I'm at
Streets where I rep and B-K where I be at

Chorus: Cocoa Brovas

Cause Brook-lyn where we live-at
Jugg-lin the good-crack (roo ROO)
Hand-lin a big-gat
My-army got my bi-zack

[Steele]
I'mma Brooklyn survivor, these streets is hotter than lava
Top of saliva, burn you like fire
I'm a B.K.D.C.S.T. smokin Nestle with a chick in a G.S. Tree
Why Missy so sexy but she's a bitch
Chill shorty, who can't play me
I'm a general baby, what you crazy
Bucktown where niggas be actin so shady

[Tek]
Welcome to Crooklyn, where we send shots to ya fitted
Rock two tone doo rags and whips and kid it
I love to shit it, fuck you if you ain't wit it
Out here I know the D.A. get cases aquited
So why would I up and leave, behind all my team
All that cream, go to where new and start out clean
My sixteen, these niggas cramp with hoes
Been all around the word, still Brooklyn's own

Chorus 2X

[Cocoa Brovas]
What we live is what you read about
  And any time of the day we bring the heaters out
My nigga stacked his dough, then he bought the Beemer out
  Now you wonderin what Cocoa B's about?
(Cocoa BEEEEEZ, Cocoa BEEEEEEEEZ)

[Verse Four]
Cocoa B-R-double-O
K-L-Y-N with a couple HOEES
Tired of coppin weed bags, had enough of those
Invest in a few pounds or a couple O's
My niggaz hustle most aggressive and keep the toast
on point for the B's and whenever beef approach
If you want me you can find me in the reefer smoke
Chrome close, anyone compete - meet your ghost

[Verse Five]
All my heights and capers, Smoky Lah be one of the greatest
Can't tell you all the things my niggaz do for the papers
Why our Roc's look like Raiders and got models for ladies
Come through in fresh wears, always drivin Mercedes
Summer days and mountain bikes, wet Timbs on my feet
Move with the heat, Cocoa B's influence your speech
Four in a week, catch me in the park gettin scent
Federales stay all over the bar, behind the neck, out in

Chorus: {repeat 2X}

Cause Brook-lyn where we live-at
Jugg-lin the good-crack (roo ROO)
Hand-lin a big-gat
My-army got my bi-zack

[Cocoa Brovas]
What we live is what you read about
  And any time of the day we bring the heaters out
My nigga stacked up his dough and brought the Beemer out
  And now you wonderin what Cocoa B's about?</pre>
