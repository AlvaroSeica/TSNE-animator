[Intro]
Now I swear
The next one of your primates
even, touches... GAHHH!
I got news for you pal, you ain't leavin
but two things right now, Jack and Shit
And Jack left town (uh-oh~!)

[Planetary]
Yeah, I ain't never worship the Devil
I'm always cursing in churches, my mother heard I'm a rebel
I ran like a rebel, in eighty-nine
No baby nine, only weapon I had was a crazy rhyme
But now it's the 2010 era
Where I ain't even gotta use a pen to bend letters
And you can listen to that, I recommend better
How about the Army of the Pharaohs rap trend setters?
You see my endeavors are bound to end eras
My syllable send terror, you killable men tear up
I heard there's faggots I could find you with
So don't forget I spit shit to leave him swine flu sick
Let me remind you quick, I'm 2-1-5th
Killadel' county count me in I run through clicks
I can take em back to battling, my javelin jagged
I manhandle 'em, call me rap's Marilyn Manson
I'm dancin with demons with decorated pants from the bleedin
Blasting your region with poetry and passionate teachin
The music is leakin, it's seepin through the pores on tour
Still raw, still swarmin with the "Storm of Swords," that's all

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Blood in, blood out
We run into this game until it run out
Blood in, blood out
Am I my brother's keeper? No doubt

[Crypt the Warchild]
My life on trial, y'all testify
My wife don't smile, then she can slide
I don't bite my tongue, don't need replies
I eat cyanide before I eat my pride
Tell G "you and me," tell Nick "you and I"
Against the world, the rest can fly
In Hell's Kitchen I baked that pie I provide
And through them, hope is kept alive
So who gonna ride, when I cock it and name it
Homicide, +Murder Was the Case+ that they gave him
Blood in my pen, dues I done paid them
Been through a lot, trials tribulations
The man in the mirror, am I talkin to Satan?
If I choose to sleep, who gonna wake 'em?
In this mental prison my views have escaped an'
I live reality, dreams I don't chase them
Loyalty is questioned when Judas is waitin
Suicidal thoughts, who can erase them?
The glass is hourless, time keeps on wastin
I'm a psycho killer in a hospital pacin

[Chorus]</pre>
