[Mr. Shadow]
Please believe it's on (Please believe it)
I'm a sick dog in The Backhouse (Please believe it)
The knot about to get loose (Get loose)
I'm a let it off of your buster ass biotches (S.D.)
Dumb dog dick (S.D., California)
All you suckers, eat a dick (Eat a dick, eat a dick)
Travis (Travis loco)
I'm a have it like this, biotch

(Verse 1)
You know me
S-H-A-D
O-W, Amichi Park crazy
You fakes be perpin' on the daily, making me laugh {*laughing*}
Mad cause you ain't getting payed off my ass (Biotch)
Ounce in the stash when I mash through your area (Right)
In a sling shot, blowing smoke, I ain't scared of ya {*inhale, exhale*}
Throwin' up the hood whether you like it or not (What's up)
Boy, I'm never fallin' off, bitch, I'm staying on top (That's right)
We chopping it up
Weighing it and wrappin' it up
Servin' every single tweaker on your block
NOW WHAT?
Gangbangin' don't stop (Nope)
Every damn day
There's a new fool, backin' it up
So are you
In it or not
Do you think you got the balls (Balls)
To wear a blue rag and hit your name up on the wall? (Wall)
Laws, were meant to be broken (Broken)
So when you come around here (WHAT)
Act straight or get smoken

Chorus: Mr. Shadow
It's Mr. Shadow
Coming from Diego
If you'se a gangsta
Then come and bang with me
Yaow
It's Mr. Shadow
Coming from Diego
In California
We do this everyday
Yaow

(Verse 2)
When I ride (Ride)
I ride like there ain't no tomorrow (Damn)
Brown pride, til the day I die, is the motto
I'll shank you with a broken bottle (Ugh!)
FUCK RESPECT
You get checked, when you mess with, San Diego's best
Law low in the west, young homies quit to test
And lay a punk motherfucker to rest
Please believe it
Leave it alone or get cracked in the dome
Jacked in the zone
I'm daring you bitches to bring it on (Come on)
Hit the bong and hold it in {*inhale*}
Fool, I play to win
And can't no petty minded ass bitch stop this Mexican (Nope)
Hell nah, I refuse
I have
I been and will always pay my dues (Ha ha)
I'm a 6-1-9 fool, can't no motherfucker change that (Nope)
I'm that fool that'll brake in where you stay at (COME HERE!)
Pay your ass a visit {*three knocks*}
Who is it?
A bald fool with a cocked strap and a blunt
Get with it

Repeat Chorus

[Mr. Shadow]
{*inhale*}
Damn, homie
Hey
Hey dawg
Top this bitch off
Top it off
Let's roll

(Verse 3)
You can catch me and E (E)
Smokin' a Dubb
Topped off in the Cadillac, flippin' you off (Fuck you, fools)
Hittin' three on you flees as we bend around the corner
This is G shit, straight outta Killafornia
I'm a down South soldier (Right)
A Whop town member (Right)
A sick dog from the sixth day of September (Uh)
Fool, you better back up (Back up)
If you can't take the heat
Then get the hell out of the hood, motherfucker
Tuck your chair (Tuck it)
You fucking with the big dogs
Pitboss, makin' all you jealous haters lick balls
You're first to fall, I'm the last man standing (POW!)
It's a war in the ghetto, gotta come through blastin' (POW! POW-POW!)
Smoke chronic no matter where I'm at {*inhale, coughing*}
You can call it what you want, but I stay high like that
I fly like that
Walk through the sky like that
All day and all night now, where my gangstas at?
What

Repeat Chorus</pre>
