[Shaunta]
We used to make love, now we hate each other guts
No more words between us you in the streets I'm in the cut
I figure, give me  space, give it some time
And we put me out on a highway I hitting on mine
Caught a taxi to my crib, roughft up my six
Full throatle to you crib, crying and shit
Should of listen, cause we was like, night and day
Should of seen it, you break my heart, anyway
But I lost my mind you hit my spot when you made love to me
Was you loving me or fucking me when you was inside me?
?????????
Insecure, get it from a girl that's yours when the streets beat you up and
you can't take no more
And that life style you living lead's you to back to my door
Tell me, I played the ?fuel? forever as long as you and I could stay
together forever

Momma said you only wanted my wealth
Still I ended up loving you more than I love myself
Five year's prom bitches taking down off the shelf
Ate your pussy imaging you was somebody else

(Uh) We split up and the judge let you keep the house

{*William Bell - sampled*}

The only rain you was getting was around the bathtub after you finish stripping
Apologiies? Save 'em all for your Priests
