Okay people, we're recording live
[Sean] Headphones up to {?}
Roger
[Sean] Microphone on
That's affirmative, we're recording live
[Sean] Turn my headphones up a bit will you?
Roger that Sean
[Sean] Awesome
Sounding good P
[Sean] Voice is clear, here comes the rhyme
[Sean] Record the track, say an omen
We've got an emergency, Sean's album is flopping
[Sean] I got a memory lapse, I can't remember my lines
[Sean] My album sales slipping, industry feedback is negative
[Sean] I'm ready to quit!
Get your pitch back in tune, stay focused
[Sean] I can't hold on much longer, I'm breaking up
[Sean] I'm losing connection, I'm losing money
[Sean] The royalty checks is shitty, AHHHH!

Sean Price, the brokest rapper, career barely alive
We can rebuild him, we have the production
We can make him stronger than Run, more skillful than before
Better, wittier, crazier wordplay than before
We can rebuild him

[Sean Price]
Yo... listen
Updated, upgraded
Don't get mad motherfucker just say "Fuck made it"
Say it, P! That's crowd participation
So now the situation wild so peep the shit you facin
How you want it pa, two in your hat
of your Barry Bonds, BALCO on with aluminum bats?
Through wit'chu cats, actin like you tougher than I
Motherfuckers gettin snuffed in the eye, no lie
I bullshit you not, pull quick and pop
Full clip and drop the New Kid on the Block
Body your frame, nigga P Body's the name
Got me a car, but the shit is not in my name
P!!!
