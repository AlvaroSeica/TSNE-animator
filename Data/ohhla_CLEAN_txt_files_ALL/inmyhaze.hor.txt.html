[Solo and Jane Tyrrell singing together]
I got the strangest
I got the strangest
I got the strangest feeling
Somewhere underneath
We found a place with no rules to break
In a Technicolor dream
Counting sheep but I'm wide awake
Looking round the room for proof
I plot the grain inside the wood
It's a lie that feels like truth
Cheap paint and lino never looked so good
Lost in this maze, stay here for days
Wonder if we'll ever touch down
I'm outa place, in foreign space
Wonder if we'll ever touch down

[Jane] My face stuck on smile
[Solo] Stay down here a while
[Jane] Please don't touch that dial
[Both] We can unwind and just be free
[Jane] Just sink into the couch
[Solo] No time for thinking bout
[Jane] So I'll do without
[Both] I don't mind, that's fine with me

But I'ma spark up a thought
off every surface in this room
and just sit back and watch it all ablaze
I know I've strayed off my course
and I'll have to leave here soon
But for now won't you leave me in my haze
Just leave me in my haze

[Solo - rap verse]
I think pigs might fly, either that or my
or my eyes telling me white lies
Thug life on the bathroom wall
The 1-up got me watching the wallpaper crawl
Now the storm clouds gather and we at it again
Feels so real to me that I don't have to pretend
And when my head finally did come back together
I was still the same but changed forever, it's like

[Jane and Solo singing]
If these walls could talk
They might explain the wear and tear
But it's the same now as before
There's nothing left of what happened here
Lost in this maze, stay here for days
Wonder if we'll ever touch down
I'm outa place, in foreign space
Wonder if we'll ever touch down
Lost in this maze, stay here for days
Wonder if we'll ever touch down
I'm outa place, in foreign space
Wonder if we'll ever touch down

[Jane] My face stuck on smile
[Solo] Stay down here a while
[Jane] Please don't touch that dial
[Both] We can unwind and just be free
[Jane] Just sink into the couch
[Solo] No time for thinking bout
[Jane] So I'll do without
[Both] I don't mind, that's fine with me

But I'ma spark up a thought
off every surface in this room
and just sit back and watch it all ablaze
I know I've strayed off my course
and I'll have to leave here soon
But for now won't you leave me in my haze
Just leave me in my haze

Some say too much of a good thing
But to me there's no such thing
I just, just have to let this thing be good to me
So I'll be gone for a while
Hide and seek behind my smile
But for now I'm not around so don't look for me
Don't look for me</pre>
