[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Yes, yes, check one two
Yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
Ay yo, I play to win until the end, you mice or men? I got no friends
I'm just a soloist who beholdin' this with ferociousness
My focus is to be the greatest vocalist and makin' people notice this
And get a fanbase wide as the ocean is
My greatest fear is something interferin' with me starin'
In the direction of bein' the greatest MC out here this year
I gotta be the most fantastic, takin' drastic
Measures, until I've mastered the art within my field of practice
It be the grandest, spreadin' faster than cancerous cells
Tracks hot as hell, I do my thing on the mic apparatus
Turnin' brothers pale as Marshall Mathers, makin' critics raise their standards
At this hip hop grammar, I got your grandma even likin' this
Honeys on the floor, shakin' like the twist
If u wit' me throw your fist, go out and purchase the disc
'Cause times are war when you rockin' raw and hardcore
When I step out on the floor, I wanna hear the crowd roar

[Chorus: The Reverend William Burk]
We never stoppin', we hip hoppin', we keep it rockin'
We make it hot and once we get it started, dun
We rockin' on, son, warrior style, keep it strong, every song
We hardcore, keep it movin' right
We never stoppin', we hip hoppin', we keep it rockin'
We make it hot and once we get it started, dun
We rockin' on, son, warrior style, keep it strong, every song
We hardcore, keep it movin' right

[The Reverend William Burk]
When I bust a rhyme it's like the reemergence of the sunshine
After a long line of rainy days, you know I'd have to come out sometime
My life line is like the mic line, long as a pipeline
My rap mind is dark as nighttime, but spiritually Divine
What I find when I look inside of myself is true freedom
God reigneth supreme to everything else
Which equals good health, knowledge needed to obtain wealth
You must impose your own will 'cause not many people'll help
I blaze hot as sun rays on the equator's belt
Make my presence felt, it ain't nuttin' just the hand I was dealt
I strike like thunder on the season of summer
I'm a figher and a lover, dime pieces get my number
Slicin' cats open with the dopest, most potent rhyme
Showin' that I'll get mine, they hopin' they could bite a line
But that's forbidden 'cause the sense is in the rhyme precision
I make you stop, look and listen, dun, I'm on a mission

[Chorus]

[The Reverend William Burk]
Bein' quite clever, best ever, could you test? Never!
On this rhymin' endeavor, if you better, come against the brother or you featherweight
I'm lookin' at you hesitate, it seems as if you 'bout to shake
I break your clavicle for tryin' to battle, make you levitate
With one uppercut, dun, I set it straight
And with your fate I educate thee, never sleep, and never meet defeat
I'll be the bloody idiot, blind, dumb, silly, toothless
For foolishness, the truth is the Western world has made me ruthless
I never feel regret for my actions and satisfaction
Is given all of my enemies lashes
Tactics or flashes of light returnin' me to the battles
I had in past lifes, (someone?) I had been forced to fight
That's the reason now I'm extra tight
When I bless the mic I do it right and fight with might until I reach my grave site
Ye nahmean? I come clean when I'm on the stage in a rage
Blaze with the strength and the fury to leave a crowd amazed

[Chorus]</pre>
