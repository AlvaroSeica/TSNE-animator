Song:   Don't Do Drugs
Typed by: putanomous@hotmail.com

"So y'all don't do no drugs?"
"No, no, no we don't want any drugs thanks"
"No drugs?"
"No, no, no, no thanks"
"C'mon man, you don't do no drugs?"

"I'm so, so, so, so high"
Come on, yeah
"I'm so, so, so, so high"
Come on, yeah, one time
"I'm so, so, so, so high"

[Jemini]
They call me mister hustler
See me around the way
Everyday the smoke juggler
The coke bubbler
You know
I get you high if you gimme your dough
I'm only trying to get you to put your nose three feet deep in the snow
Get a whiff of this, real good green weed without any seeds
Get a sniff of this Vitamin C-O-K-E
Take a puff of this opium that'll leave your mind blown
Grown from Colombian seeds, come on!

[Chorus]
So what about smoke?
I got it!
Coke?
I got it!
What about ex?
I got it!
What about dope?
I got it!
Whitney's chillin', Bobby's chillin'
Let's get high 'cos we love the feeling
"So if you take my advice you will try one"
We got red ones, green ones, blue ones, white ones
"So if you take my advice you will try one"
And if you take my advice and try 'em you might like 'em

[Jemini]
But don't you think that you should be cautioning
People not to buy this
There's no way that you should be endorsing
For people to try this
Especially me, I'm just a petty larcen
The godson of a mob son
Who moonlights doing arsons for the boss, son

Check it out
The first one is always free
Strong enough to make you come back (mmm)
Possibly strung out, enough to run back

[Chorus]
So what about smoke?
I got it!
Dope?
I got it!
Ex?
I got it!
Coke?
I got it!
Marion's chillin', Clint is chillin'
Let's get high 'cos we love the feeling
"So if you take my advice you will try one"
We got red ones, green ones, blue ones, white ones
"So if you take my advice you will try one"
And if you take my advice and try 'em you might like 'em

[Jemini]
Ain't you that person to be
At the university
Studying heavily and
Partying hardily
You need to ease your mind
Put your feet up and recline
Um, give me a nick, and I'ma sell you a dime
Puff, puff pass I got big bags of grass to sell
You can enhance the strength and smell if you can sprinkle it with hash

[Chorus]
So what about smoke?
I got it!
Coke?
I got it!
What about ex?
I got it!
What about dope?
I got it!
Darryl's chillin', Elsie's chillin'
Let's get high 'cos we love the feeling
"So if you take my advice you will try one"
We got red ones, green ones, blue ones, white ones
"So if you take my advice you will try one"
And if you take my advice and try 'em you might like 'em</pre>
