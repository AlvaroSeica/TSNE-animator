Song:   What's That Smell?
Typed by: JuwenLong@aol.com

I say stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's goin' down 
I'm everlastin', forever on a roll 
I'm rockin' to the boat, steamin' grey matter tone
I ain't sayin' I'm God, but you can graft this 
Chances are if I'm a star I'd be Johnny Mathis
On some smooth shit, I'd be gamin' all the honeys
Hittin' Hugh Hefner with his Playboy bunnies 
Check the Sunday funnies, I be readin' Doonesbury 
See me after dark, love, shit be gettin' scary 
I'll freak you like Carrie on the night of the prom
Let's keep it cool and calm, I'll start strokin' your palm 
Work my way up your arm, start kissin' your ear 
Maybe lickin' your lips, then pullin' your hair 
Yeah, I'll freak the back spasm, then give the orgasm 
And if my legs cramp, girl, I'll lick that stank 
I got it sewn love, so you ain't got no worries
Hold up, wait a second, my vision's gettin' blury

Chorus 2X:
Stop, hey, what's that smell 
Someone laced dust all up in my L 
Bitches start sweatin' once the pockets swell
Let's take it back fourteen billion cells</pre>
