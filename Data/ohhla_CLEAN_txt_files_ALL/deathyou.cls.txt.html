[Intro: CL Smooth]
"To bring you down"
Bust it off
"To bring you down"
Uh make shot one time for the Mecca don
"To bring you down"
and the Soul Brother #1
"To bring you down"
Y'all get done with the YG Menace II Society
"To bring you down"
Feel the real steel, the hot metal
"To bring you down"
"To bring you down"

[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
It's the Killa Bee, kill rugged, skill vest often
And land your fuckin asses in a coffin, what
You see cold steel, you niggaz wanna mill'
Like Shaquille, O' Neal
Bullets are real, cock it back and then I peal off
Fuck the kamikaze Mecca is on the shotty hottie
The cops are runnin white chalk around your dead body
Abandon ship, niggaz are ready to flip and bag a punk
They can't fight next night, twistalism by your gravesight

[Verse 2: Kenny]
Over, yes you over six feet under
You see, I'm not at ease you're diseased
A reason for the treason, hunt season
I'm from rabbit ordeal
Where niggaz kick the beer loungin' off block
Till the early morn', word is bond, another brother gone
Would've been bullshit, quick talkin with nines and banana clips
For million with bloodshed, the color red, two through the fuckin head
Man you're dead, Death Becomes You

[Hook][8X]
"So listen" - Slick Rick
"To bring you down"

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
Infrareds locked on ya heads here come the feds
Freeze now when I squeeze hot metal breeze
Right through your arteries to bring you to your knees
I think he's dyin' black
I got the track to send you silly ass niggaz back
Snatch ya hoe stab ya pimp and watch him limp away
I fiend luchi till I'm fucked up old and gray
Hey dog I send you to the morgue
I'm from the Vernon ville blood spills shells drop

[Verse 4: Kenny]
And when it go pop-pop my glock hit that niggaz nut
Cause I'm one of the hard ox's smokin' motherfuckers like crack rocks huh
So back up, be ghost when I keep my toast Murder She Wrote yo
Fully equipped with this death blow, flippin'
Because I'm on the level like the rebel crazy bodies and tumbstones
Straight to the devil nigga light in ya bed's right
Because ya tune from me let miss due
Strictly nigga Death Becomes You

[Hook][8X]
"So listen"
"To bring you down"

"So listen to what we say because this type a shit it happens everyday"

[Verse 5: Cl Smooth]
No resurrection with protection slay cut up in the blender
Just like Mohammed blowin' up the World Trade Center
The hellraiser burner blazer stressin' major caution
See the Mecca Don swirvin' a tongue like Jordan
Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now your bucks are big, and let out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
Buck-buck-buck-buck rat-tat-tat I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfucking trigger
I'm sick in the head I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God I come from the P now
I'm Menace like Dennis so don't try to play me close
I wave my gun in the air yo I don't fuckin' care
It's Pete Rock on the mic check one, two
I got the glock nigga, Death Becomes You

[Outro]
"So listen"
"To bring you down"
"So listen to what we say because this type a shit it happens everyday"
"To bring you down" "So listen" etc.</pre>
