[Intro]
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin
She the type don't never ever ask, for nuttin

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin
She the type don't never ever ask, for nuttin
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin
She pay her own bills cause she got her own money
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin
She pay her own bills cause she got her own money
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin
She the type don't never ever ask, for nuttin

[Waka Flocka Flame]
My girl independent, bitches all in her business
Pink on the back of her boy shorts, bought everything she own
Love it when she smile and moan, encore how she groan
Ask around the hood, she known; one of a kind she can't be cloned
"No hands" for her ringtone, "Hard in the Paint" her theme song
That's my gutter chick, man I love that bitch
How she look and moan, when she takin dick
And don't mind McDonald's, she ain't no bougie bitch
When I wake up, breakfast on the table
One rolled up, Sprite up on the table
Baby po' up, drinkin out the A cup
Pass the syrup, I'm fin' to fuck this food up

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Now she's stuntin, she goin in, these hoes can't tell her nothin
She came over in a trench coat, and under it was nothin
I'm so curious, it's serious, my car so fast and furious
But she'll drive a man delirious, I hope all y'all hearin this
She's got swag of a top model, curves like a Coke bottle
She know I go full throttle, I'm walkin with a slight wobble
Got choppers like I'm Big Poppa, I'm Big Gucci you a cock blocker
These True Religion not the knockoff, my camera chain is an eye popper
I'ma Stuntville on a half a pill, ice cream Gucci Mane, can I live?
Chick just know I got a record deal, you know what "Gone in 60 Seconds" is?
A movie, I'm bein me, just coolin, on my DVD
And my BVD's are so I-C-E, Y to the G-U-C-C-I

[Chorus] sans last line

[Slim Dunkin]
I bust her, I lick her, I hit her, it's juicy

Puttin on, cash and check, skinny chick, and the rent
Set the pit, and the tint, lookin fat, and it went
Pussy ass amount BAM worth a million now WHAM
We be showin out DAMN jelly don't shake like that JAM
V-neck on my cardigan, pulled up in her car again
Tank on E, blowin gas, know my shit gon' start again
Hoe like oh my God again, twisted clique they followin
Business bitch she swallowin, Brick Squad nigga we chart again

[Chorus]</pre>
