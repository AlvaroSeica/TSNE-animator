[Dan-e-o]
Sometimes the world looks perfeck
Nothing to rearrange
Sometimes you just get a feeling
Like you need some kinda change

[Promise] + (Dan-e-o)
Now, now let me tell you 'bout my family
More specifically about my cousin Balki, Dan-e
Called me to say he wasn't happy
And see, he out of state I told him "get on a plane and come gladly"
(Yo, for real Promise?) Sure, I promised your daddy
In America, you can be all that you can be
I ain't living like a prince here
But yo, as long as you can get here, I'm saying you can live here

[Dan-e-o] + (Promise)
Yeah, my cousin Larry welcomed me with open arms
This world is scary, it often greets your hope with harm
Knowing just to cope is hard, he Promises we'll work it out
(I know my place is small but you're welcome to my couch)
See, I'm a foreign man, I live a constant scam
Where dreams are crushed, so I'm hoping I've found the Promiseland
He says he's formed a plan fraught with prosperity
Thank you cousin for the support and taking care of me

[CHORUS - Naya Marie]
When you look out and your world's a mountain
You climb so dreams come true
You gotta do away with feelin' you can't keep buildin'
Your plans to see them through
There'll be no more frownin' and feelin' down when
You know what you're made to do
Gotta keep playing hard, keep your faith in God
And the path He's laid for you
It could be perfeck...

[Dan-e-o] + (Promise)
They call me Mr. Bartokomous, new to this metropolis
I'm well-learned but funny is how my talkin' is
Practically got a doctorate but in this place, I'm sorta dumb
My cousin assures me (we all got things to overcome
You gotta stick to this, trust my instinctiveness
You losing faith?) Of course not, don't be ridiculous!
We clown around but I know he ain't jokin'
I'm confident my cousin's a Promise that can't be broken

[Promise] + (Dan-e-o)
I'm hoping you get a job, if not I'll see the boss
Hoping that I get a nod to put you on
We livin' in a building, you can't just mow the lawn
In the city nobody really cares if you own a farm
Come on, what are you thinking? (I was just thinking
Maybe I could do something like this Abraham Lincoln)
Now I ain't doubtin' that you got skills
But did you know that that dude got killed? For real!

[CHORUS  Naya Marie]

[Promise] + (Dan-e-o)
Hi, I'm Larry, no leisure suit
I was on my own just doing what I need to do
When I get a call not knowing who I'm speaking to
Saying (cousin, I'm coming and staying for a week or two
And I don't know where I'm staying, can I sleep with you?)
He ain't mean "sleep with you" but you know how people do
Being over manly means there's a doubt in him
But family is family, you gotta look out for 'em

[Dan-e-o] + (Promise)
You pronounce it, um "Balki" from the south seas
My cousin claims he don't  know what he'd do without me
Humble's what he's about, see I know the opposite is true
(We keep each other focused on the things we gotta do)
Equally passionate, constructing classic hits
Knowin' the cash we get is only the half of it
Now we got this world loving these handsome boys
Got us so happy, we doing the "Dance Of Joy"

[CHORUS  Naya Marie]</pre>
