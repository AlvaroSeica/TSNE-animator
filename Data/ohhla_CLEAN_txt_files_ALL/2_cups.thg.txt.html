Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Panorama Porsche, pull up on a bitch like
Pass me the torch, let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but aye aye bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to 2 cups stuffed
Lighter ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get 2 cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

[Verse 1]
L-E-A-N-I-N-G
Lean, lean, lean, lean, lean lean lean
500 horses inside my machine
500 DNAs in my ding ding
Come here bitch, watch you chasin' cash
2 guns up, Ferrari smash
100 pound green, herb it, curb it, trash
Smoke a whole ounce, leave ya bitch the ash

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
AR 15 inside my trench
Plus I blend in with the fuckin' trenches
100 crushed diamond for my fuckin' misses
Take the bitch shoppin' cause I fuckin' missed it
Ralph Lauren boxers every day and night
Bitch, I ain't Barry, but I play with white
Bitch, I ain't scary, I could never fright
100 black choppers like a fuckin' night

[Chorus]</pre>
