[Verse 1]
Can I get some of that CD money
That platinum Master P money
That Puff Daddy, Jay-Z money
That Eightball, MJG money 
That Pimp C, Bun B money
That Jermaine Dupre money
That Suge Knight Death Row dough
That Ruthless Eazy E money
Can I get some of that major change
Go back home do major thangs
Played the game, paid my dues
Went outta town made major moves
Got somethin to prove, nuthin to lose
And now with no further adue
Come on with that Grammy dough
Who's around yo Mammy do

[Chorus]
Can I get some of that (4X)
Hey man blaze this blunt

[Verse 2]
Can I get some of that Northern Lights
Four hits and I'm feelin more than right
Gimme some of that tru puffin player 
Big ol buds and purple hairs
That light green, wit no seeds
Ain't nuttin like some good weed
Just puff puff till its all gone 
Papers, pipes, blunts, bongs
Roll the windows up make it hard to see
So much smoke you can hardly breathe
It dont even bother me
I'm a pothead man thank god for weed

[Chorus]
Can I get some of that
Can I get some of that
some of this, some of that 
some of this, some of that
some of this, some of that (2X) 

[Verse 3]
Can I get some of that
Can I plug it in
Right below ya nose, right above ya chin
Im a fuck till I nut, then puff this blunt
What, then we gone fuck again
Hey, Can I get some of that
From the front, from the back, I'm thinkin bout makin you scream
When you wake up in the mornin
Im a be gone and you will think it was a wet dream
Can I get some of that with whipped cream
Can I get some of that with lace
Can I get some of that with that I love that dick look on yo face
Can I get some of that hey girl Im talkin to you
Tell ya friend shes kinda cute, Im tryin to get some of that there too
CAN I GET SOME OF THAT</pre>
