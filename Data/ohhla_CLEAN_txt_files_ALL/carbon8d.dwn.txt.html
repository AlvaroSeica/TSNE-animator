[ Soda Pop ]
Ahh... S-Soda Pop i-i-is just a title
Me rhymin on a Boogie track, hah, is vital
Like clouds on rainy days my style is fallin your ways
So heads up cause I don't really give a...
As I deliver the fluid and flow ( ? )
I can rip up any show and do the ( ? )
So warning, never do the shake cause pressure builds and Soda spills
On this rap thing, no it ain't a wack thing
That's why you're sittin at home and I'm rappin
Understand, my man, cause you know who I am
The Fizz Man, yes the one who like to pack the grand stands

[Name] likes the carbonation

Sodalicious and delicious, not ficticious
If you are suspicious, I'm the one who's so ambitious
Wake up in the morn, wash the face and the 'nads
Praise the Lord cause I'm not a fraud
Heyh, hailing from the south and you claim I got no mouth
But there's clout that your squad don't talk about
So I set the stakes high, entered into Bed-Stuy
Three car loads to drop a big daddy load
So joy, joy, what's up with the chicken coops?
Hon' over here wants to fix a chicken soup
( ? ) and you know my style is fluid
80% is water, I swam right through it
Had a dilemma, reversed it to the ripple
You know I love my liquid, so I stayed by the nipple
Like that, on the funk tip
It's like that, on the Soda tip
It's like that, on the fluid tip
It's like that when I bust your lip

And I'm done</pre>
