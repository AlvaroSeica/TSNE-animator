* These lyrics are according to the maxi version (long)
  as appears on this album. The single version omits a few 
  repeats of chorus but no other major edits have been made.  

** "Das Böse ist immer und überall" is German for
   "The evil is always and everywhere". **
** "Banküberfall" is the German word for "Bankrobery". **

Old Mother Hubbard, my cupboard is bare
My last few cheques are bouncing everywhere

No scraps for the cat, no bone for the dog
And I'm losing all my friends, because my 'phone's cut off

The bailiff keeps knocking on my front door
He's taken everything, but he still wants more

I've had all I can take.  It's the world against me!
So how do I make, a bankrobbery?

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me

Black thick stockings and I can't see a sausage
To the bank with the water pistol in my pocket

And the water leaks out. I'm wet and soggy
Knees are knocking and it's hot in this stocking

I say: "Hands up please
Everybody just freeze!
All hit the deck
with the hands behind the neck!"

And then a granny turns around
and says "Sunny Jim,
You'd see there was a queue, if you'd remove that thing!"

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
A-Ba-A-Ba-A-Bankrobbery

A bankrobbery

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
A-Ba-A-Ba-A-Bankrobbery

After hours of waiting, I was standing at the desk
When a kid said: "Mommy, that black has wet himself!"

I said "Look up there, there's a camera watching me!
I'm a little bit a-nervous, it's my first time on TV

I said: "I'm nasty and I'm vicious, and my hands on the trigger
It's your money or your life!" but she didn't lift a finger

The cashier said: "Sonny, stop messing around!"
I said: "OK, sorry, I-I-I-I-I'd like to open an account."

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
A-Ba-A-Ba-A-Bankrobbery

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
A-oo-ee-ah, a-oo-oo-oo-oo

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
A-oo-ee-ah, a-oo-oo-oo-oo

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Das Böse ist immer und überall

Ba-Ba-Banküberfall
Ba-Ba-Banküberfall
Ba-Ba-Banküberfall
A-ee-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
Ba-Ba-Bankrobbery
No money for nothing for Woofy and me</pre>
