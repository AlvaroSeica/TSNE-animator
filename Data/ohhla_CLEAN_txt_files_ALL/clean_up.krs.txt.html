[Intro: KRS-One]
Duck Down, yeah
What up Dru Ha?
Damn man, look what you done did
{"Some, somebody call for... somebody call for a clean up crew?"}
BO!

[Rock]
Just when you thought it could-n't get any rougher
There's a +Bounty+ on your head, guess who's the quicker picker upper?
Me~! No mess on the scene, do it so fresh and so clean
+Zest+fully clean, baffle the fuck out of Feds and police
I'm Brillo pad rough, draw more than yo' dandruff
when I aim at yo' +Head &amp; Shoulders+
I'm the {?} on the street that melt the snow of that mess you don't
When I royally flush it down without the help of poker
Just a super soaker with soap suds, wash you up
(Kaboom!) Scrub free, that mighta went over your heads
But y'all should duck anyway, Rock is an Oxy
Clean you off of the face of the rap scene
Just watch me beam with the +Arm &amp; Hammer+ or bakin soda
Suckers don't come around here no more fakin, doin no more snakin
(Uh-huh uh-huh) I clean house like Geoffrey
Like Kraus, like Benson, with a semi, friendly

[Chorus: Rock]
Who called the clean up crew?
Get yourself cleaned up like a fiend that need help, who need drugs?
We'll clean up YOU (uh-huh uh-huh)
Clean house, make a clean break, start over with a clean slate
We the clean up crew
Get washed and dried, them things +Maytag+ you, it's laundry night
We 'bout to clean up YOU!
Every last soft nigga is simple as wax on wax off niggaz
Who called the clean up crew?

[KRS-One]
I'm the janitor, I come to clean up quick
The mic is the mop I clean the streets up with quick
I spit the dish and you'll get infected
I'll wipe out your whole crew and leave 'em lemon scented
The dragon has entered - the mic is there
I'm darin you jump so I can anti-bacteria{?} you
Airin your crew, I'm air freshenin you
Here's what KRS gon' do
I'ma let you clean up your act and t'ing
But you front, I'ma throw you in an +Irish Spring+
Dude, I'm the King like Martin Luther
You the loser like Bush

[Buckshot]
Push, that broom back and forth
Clean your ceiling, clean your walls; they don't feel you at all
Dawg, we're +Swifter+, yeah you beg to differ
We +Shine+, you glitter, we 9 on the Richter
Listen

[KRS-One]
I can't believe dude tryin to see me
I spit the gospel like Bebe and Cece
Huh, first time a hairdo wan' see me
I get greasy, startin grinnin like hee-hee-hee
Then commence the firin
Fire back big booms, you be like "What kind of iron is that?"
{*BOOM*} There's no time to react
You just the type of rapper I been dyin to smack
"I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that"
But I told y'all before you're just wick-wick-wack!

[Chorus]

[Buckshot]
We got a lot to +Gain+, so I'ma make you +Cheer+
Flows like water, bring the +Tide+ up to here
So crazy, my formula is +409+
It's +Fantastik+, you can go online
to get it A-L-L, that spells +All+
I +Shout+ P-U-S-S-Y, that spells y'all
Look, BBI{?}, I set the trend
And my voice caress your friend so I did it again
They call me, +Mr. Clean+ spreadin +Joy+ on the scene
It's a New +Era+ that's fitted for your boy on the team
Look, I'm a +Comet+, I bomb so toxic
You could praise +For-a-breeze+ but that's {?}

[Chorus]</pre>
