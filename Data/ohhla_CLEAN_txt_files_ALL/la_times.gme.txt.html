[Verse 1]
when them niggaz start shooting thats when the shots
get the pourin, you only got one shot to hit the floor and
just take this one shot as a warning
cause tomorrow could be a wake like good morning
back on the block like I never left, it's friday
hi ms. parker, I've been cooking, I'm a forever chef
and the recipe is legendary
I put niggaz careers to end early like february
then I come back marchin
hit you with april showers, them shots
kill niggaz like abortion
cause no body care about the nigga that ain't there
then miss you until they kiss you and you going in the ground
with maggots eating your tissue
similar to the way the shit do
these are los angeles times niggaz get your issue

[chorus]
sweet things you do?
and set my heart of love
now I want you to know
and remind me,yeah yeah oh ohh
of l.a time

[Verse 2]
fuck yall
poll up on em 20 inch wherever's and get my block
get to watching cause avery time I hit my block
they think I'm flossing
careven makes my block look like a auction
cause my block is my blocks misfortune
5 huned on the skills you gone waited
it ain't hard enough throw on stove
and soutee it
mixed in, started up, break it down, rock it up
looked this shit
it's architecture how I chop it up
alot of fiends on my block but it's not enough
champagne pourin when criiss style bottles bust
for a millionaires and billionairs money to the sell in here
patron got you gone trough pull in the air
I been trough a lot of shit when I'm still here
even fuck magic jonson bitch and I'm still here
shit I'm legend no wheel here
but if you kill my dog I put you in the wheel chair

[chorus]
see me what you do?
and set my heart of love
now I want you to know
and remind me,yeah yeah oh ohh
of l.a time
such your haters
always hatin on
you gone hatin on me
you know them haters
always hatin
why you hatin? on me

[Verse 3]
niggaz know I sell my rocks every morning
7 o'clock me and my rocks was out the door and
growin up in my projects was a project
but me and my project bitch got them pass flip
no patience so I had to ride sick
ride dirty on the t.i tip
three wheel motion always make the ride tip
it's all eyes on me and my bitch
even l.a cops was on my shit
thank god that my rocks was on my bitch
now it's time to flip the page on you niggaz
I blue up like a grenade on you niggaz
I went got paid on you niggaz
I'm bollin mj on you niggaz
I'm a star drop a shit every day on you niggaz
