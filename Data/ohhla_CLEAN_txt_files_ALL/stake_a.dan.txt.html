Song:   Stake a Claim
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In this democracy I as a citizen reserve the right to stand up for what I believe in
In this democracy I as a citizen IÄôm not accountable to the government
In this democracy the government is accountable to us, the people
In this democracy the government is elected by us, the people
To represent us, the people
In our best interests, on a national and international scale
And if theyÄôre not doing so, In this democracy, I as a citizen reserve the right
To rise up

I will not move, I will not change
I will not bend or play their games
I will stand tall with a full frame
I will take pride I will stake a claim

I swear, as a citizen of this country
To stand up for what I believe in
I swear, as a citizen of this country
To not just sit around, bitching and moaning
I swear, as a citizen of this country
To take action if action be needed
I swear, as a citizen of this country
To realize that the power is with us
And no one elseÄ¶

I will not move, I will not changeÄ¶
[X4]

I will stake a claim
I will stake a claim
I will stake a claim
I will stake a claim

I will not move, I will not changeÄ¶ </pre>
