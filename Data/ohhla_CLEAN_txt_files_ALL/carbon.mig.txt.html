DJ Cash I'm in the building AG victorious what up?
Real niggas round here
Migos! Rich The Kid!

Walk up in the club I ball on numbers
Migos get my family so fuck how niggas feel
We the real niggas who real kill
Walk up in the club I pose...
Walk up in the club I ball on numbers
Migos get my family so fuck how niggas feel
We the real niggas who real kill

Real deal, OG bag how fornest is that?
Playing with them keys nigga call me Teddy Prendergast
Been over sea nigga kicking it in Pakistan
Give me a flipper and a caravan
I pray the Lord, tell nigga I've been praying the Lord
Met with us all, my niggas ain't ready for war
Fuck nigga wanna get mad
Cut my swag out the park nigga
Yo wish nigga I plan and going
The backyard of my park gone

Walk up in the club I ball on numbers
Migos get my family so fuck how niggas feel
We the real niggas who real kill
Walk up in the club I pose...
Walk up in the club I ball on numbers
Migos get my family so fuck how niggas feel
We the real niggas who real kill

Fuck nigga Miami your walking is sill for real?
Pull up in black hit the cap at
I fucking lick your bill feel
OG got back in the effy
I got more trees that Timbaland (Timberland)
I'm in the tongue of my Everest
Wish nigga I see in the mirror
Like fornesting for nigga they thinking they buy
Paint you pipe so rich
Walk in the club with that pipe
Goodie for nigga be blocking

Walk up in the club I ball on numbers
Migos get my family so fuck how niggas feel
We the real niggas who real kill
Walk up in the club I pose...
Walk up in the club I ball on numbers
Migos get my family so fuck how niggas feel
We the real niggas who real kill</pre>
