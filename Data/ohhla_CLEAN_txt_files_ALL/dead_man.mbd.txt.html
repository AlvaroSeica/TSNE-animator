Bounty Killer: Chorus part I

Some boys sorry, but sad to say
Disrespect me and them dead today
Glang-di-glank on the S.L.K.
We spray all day (Yeah)
Some boys sorry, but sad to say (uhh)
Disrespect me and them dead today  (Huhh)
Glang-di-glang on the S.L.K.
We spray all day (Yeah)

Prodigy:  Chorus part II - 2x

Eat food, I'm full,
Doggy bag 'em, feed 'em to the wolfs
Toe tag 'em, he dead man shoes
Toe tag 'em, He's walking in dead man shoes

Prodigy: Verse I

(Yeah) A hundred bitches all laying in my hotel
send 'em in, one at a time like a dope sell
I'm flying high my life is so swell
Niggas angry cause my money's stacked like junkmail
Nun's need to make them live propel
Catapult hot rocks in your coattail
Why you fuckin' with me, I ain't did shit
 But lounge at the top like the eye on the pyramid
Don-Perion-P, I'm the capstone
Mobb Deep we the muthafuckin' backbone
On this hardcore shit we feeling right at home
Amongst the violence you look a little uncomfortable
Real recognize real if I feel ya
You not real, you're lookin' real unfamiliar
Fo-Fum I smell the blood
that the cowards heart pump and I ain't packed lunch

Some boys sorry, but sad to say

Prodigy:  Chorus part II - 2x

Eat food, I'm full,
Doggy bag 'em, feed 'em to the wolfs

Havoc: Verse II

(Yeah) Off top I tell you cowards what it do and don't
Fuckin' right that bitch up in my face you getting boned
Money getta, I put  batteries in nigga's backs
Wind 'em up and send 'em metro this is combat
Ain't that a bitch they allready waving white flags
On some black men it ain't even like that
Just a min ago you was talking killa-talk
But was It so fluid and then when you started to hawk
Where your heart at, Baby, where your heart at
So I can rip it out and throw it on the tarmac
From the legend, you ain't even near yet
Fuck it I just come to you tell me where's yo projects
Light the motherfucker up like Christmas
And have you leaking that eggnog liquid
One thing about H, me don't give a fuck
Mobb Deep's thrill niggas, ya niggas suck
