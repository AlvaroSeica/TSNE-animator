Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Guttz Grindz]
Sippin' on Patron, sippin' on Patron
What got me, got me, going, sippin' on Patron

[Guttz Grindz]
It's Gutta Grindz, tell everybody, need that work, you know he got it
Cold joints, out of half of stones, got Patron in my cup, coming down the
road
In that tank, chicks is staring, spanking Lincoln, on chrome
Sippin' on that 'tron, by the gallon, got me going
A little purple haze done got my eyes closed
But I sleep with one open, and one eye closed
Getting me off, back rows, moving 'dro by the elbows
She even made make me switch the coke, I'm like hell no
Your girls going flat, like a cola, nigga
I'm getting more dough, than most of these yellow niggas
Street sweeper, nigga, for the watch, I spent hit money
Didn't even blink, cuz the pride, straight take money
My paper long, so your bitch keep me blown
I'm that number, you just saved, that's her cousin, in her phone
It ain't my fault, you can blaim the Patron
For having like a squirrel, with your girl, ma, I'm gone

[Chorus 2X]

[Napoleon]
Club night in V.I.P., chicks dancing to B.I.G.
Tuesday got dough, spend a hundred just to B.Y.B.
Dons only see what I see, bosses know the G that I be
Everytime I step up in the club, I gotta P.Y.T.
With blood shotted, E.Y.E.'s, blue pills, we got these
I'm too real, we got cheese, a few mil, new ID's
I'm the king, you knew my steeze, whole V.A., done blew my trees
20 pounds or less, don't really got nothing to do with me
Now we sippin' on Patron, cameras flicking on the phone
Twisted mail money, they can tell I'm sitting on they thrones
Everytime I get 'em home, have 'em hitting, getting moans
Never striking out, I'm getting dome, if I didn't bone
Helping me, the Crys' alone, diamonds on and glisten home
Catch me in the pink cadillac, listening to Miss Jones
Stunting something, vicious holmes, clicked out in the sickest stones
Mind blown, from the hell juice, you better get your chrome

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
