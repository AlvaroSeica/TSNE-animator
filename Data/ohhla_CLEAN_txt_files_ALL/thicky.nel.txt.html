[Chorus]
See now you could be a lady or a bitch girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin like a lolli-pop waitin for the lick girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin at the switch girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick

(Murphy Lee)
So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When I use that, shoes untied before you know it, method:
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's gettin hectic, wreck it just like a hooptie with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles twistin &amp; pullin
I'm like shorty help me (come on) 
Help me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile...
so I take advantage
Kisses in gentle places tryin to get myself established
I'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe with no control
Concentrating on my every lick her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know
IT'S ON, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set

[Chorus]

(Ali)
Now I comes first like the front porch, in a Polo Sport shirt
Skirts, there they are, gots to flirt 'cause I'm far
from Average Lane with that "What's your name?" game
I'm stormin on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran
All up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan
Leavin me like a van in reverse, that's the worse
Playa curse put up on me now
We spreadin on my homies like a germ
Watch me turn into captain kill a hoe
Fill a hoe strong
Watch me last long like a penny broke many motels
i got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on futons
Comin out like Keyuan
I'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, got damnit
That's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb
Showin action like an ass like a metaphor
Now I'm headed for the highways 
Selling me by's sideways

[Chorus]

(Nelly)
I spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones
Just to get their ass back home
Come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin a nigga like offalana (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house, trick, who you think you fuckin with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go
(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, to hit any one of you niggas rattin
Spit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin 
Go make the announcment, spark more Dynamite than "Good Times"
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin, headboards you be grabbin
Got 'em bangin the walls so hard the neighbors callin

Asking you "What happened?  What's goin on over there even?
Sounds like you guys are goin crazzzzzzzyy.."
 
[Chorus] (begins over above)
