1991
The palindrome syndrome
The beginning and the end incur the loneliness of one
All rules are gone
We are the generation that breeds emancipation
And needs elucidation
We feed anticipation
We are the forgotten, core rotten
Apple store begotten
Greedy, needy and somewhat seedy
What are we seeking?
And what are you eking out of your parentâs mouths?
Who arenât they feeding?
And we are losing amidst the systems lies
Abusing and confusing the most ignorant of highs
They lost control
We pay the price
1991
And now loaded up with all our fun
I think we need another 9
And not by gun
I think we lost another 1, another 1
Lost generation</pre>
