Hey! {*4X*}

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Slumerican! Shitizen! {*4X*}
(Hey!)

[Yelawolf]
I'm on the sidewalk with this fuckin skateboard and these dirty ass jeans
I'm the boy that stole a pack of Twinkies, and a bottle that's green
I never gave a fuck about environmental shit, throw my empty bottle in the gutter
Rednecks fo'-wheelin screamin "Skate or die dude!"
Fuck you motherfucker (fuck you motherfucker!)
I'm a car wreck in a swamp, I drown victims slow with these words that I lay
Pigs on the pork got an eye for my kind cause we ignore laws every day
What do you mean I'm white trash? Grab my nuts and kick your poodle in the face
I'm sick to the soul with hate cause I'm the bitch that society raped
So what d'ya say?

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
My body is covered in tattoos that are totally offensive
If I did it I did it for life, no regrets, you know that I meant it
I ain't bothered by racists, my family's worldwide, hoe come get it
I'll take you to the gutter like a cigarette butt in the rain
Let Shawty Fatt spit it (YEAH~!)
You motherfuckers are lost, get your maps out and follow me into the creek water
I didn't forget where I came, just how to ignore my musical callin
That crack on the window on the Chevy's been there for over seven months
Along with Jon Newport's beer bottle caps and the roaches of WillPower's blunts
So what d'ya say?

[Chorus]

[Killer Mike]
People why shit is so wrong? 
Why they won't let all our soldiers come home?
Why them boys who get caught with such small amounts 
of dope on the ave do bids so long?
They bids so long, by the time they get to come home 
momma is gone and babies is grown
And baby mama that was tight in that thong
Fat as a fuck and her body all gone
Pay for with cash, her ass is gone
She never worked so the stash is gone
Government rations she gets on
Year after year she get check after check
A gangsta come home already in debt
The government say, you owe 50 K
for all the free lunches that yo' baby ate
Do you go legit, and never have shit?
Or G up and re-up and get you a brick?
(Yeah) Get you a brick

[Chorus] - repeat 3X

[Outro: Killer Mike - over 3rd repeat of Chorus]
See what you suckas don't understand is
This ain't even about race
This is about who got it, and who ain't got it
So if I'm on the bottom, and you on the bottom
We're the same color, dirt fuckin poor!</pre>
