Premo
Reks
Long time coming
Listen!

[Reks]

I think they want the new P.E now
Ice Cube, Nigga With An Attitude now
They want a dude who's immune to Rules
Short fuse, aiming at Q, Bishop on the roof now
They want me to say; Fuck who in the game
If your the best rapper alive, then Reks insane
I think Preme's insane, best producer alive
Me up on his track is like needles to the veins
Like burners to the brain, Suicide chest, playing suicide king
My aim when I came was to bring back the Gangstarr audio reign
No longer R-E-K-S, it's R-E-Cocaine
Y'all on the way out, Reks on the way in
Eastcoast boom bap, PM to the AM
Opinion on my rap, delivery propane
With magic, eternal king, supreme, remember the name - REKS

[Chorus]

Scrathes by DJ Premier

Big Pun "Say Goodnight"
Rakim   "Drop the mic you shouldn't be holding it
         This is how it should be done"
Xzibit  "Dropping bows on 'em, I like to catch them
         While they slippin'"
Big Pun "Say Goodnight"
Rakim   "Drop the mic, you shoudn't be holding it
         This is how it should be done"
50 Cent "I'm serious man, I'm so sincere"

[Reks]

Rockabye, pop rapper to sleep, heavenly conscious
Melodies monstrous, R's one hell of an artist
Sylibal darksmith, lyrical bars pimp caution
Beware of close parks and midicons conflicts
Even through all this garbage, nonesense, media sponsers
I'm gonna spit the raw shit, regardless
My thoughts in cockpit, steering past and just through the darkness
What nerds be writing blurbs in office
I am return of the legendary, duck through the cemetery
Soul of the ghost in my bones, so I never worry 
UHH, I think they want the new Makaveli
I can really feel the pains and the strains through my belly
Hunger gettin' deadly, ain't a killer, don't tempt me
Fill the booth cuz the youth mental frames on empty
Opinion on my rap, the flow's ether, the soulseeker
Born leader, R-E-K-S remember the name

[Chorus]

[Reks]

Yeah, I think i wanna kill Bill O'Riley
187 G-Dub, peel wheels on dunallis
Mommy I'm sorry, but when these dudes rap
I be thinkin that I should pull a ~Shyne~ in the party
Nickel nine in the audience of week rap shows
I never needed guns, but as my stress grows
Need that East-swag back, a new Westcoast
80 procent of the new South rap shit blows
Now the Midwest, shinin', respect their grindin'
But turn up my face, the bullshit rap-whinin'
UHH, say goodnight to the industry, DJ Premier sentenced me
To prepare, something lethal for they ears
So here it is for the people, compare me to no other artist
I swear no equals, I hear their public opinion
On my rap, say the future of the game
Top 10 D.O.A. - Reks, remember the name

[Chorus]
