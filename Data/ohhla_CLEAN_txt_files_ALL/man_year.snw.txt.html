[The Last Emperor]
I'm just a small man living in the land of big dreams
Looks like I finally made it to the big leagues
The show goes on at least according to Siegfried
International man of mystery and intrigue
Best believe this cat's from the best breed
Action packed, black power and prestige
Flow is needed, not a pain or a pet peeve
I'm a still remain and entertain until the guests leave
And even if we don't really have a lot
Tonight we going to make it pop like it's Camelot
Bring it off the block let it knock at you travel stop
My Hip-Hop makes the whole damn castle rock
It's the guy with his eyes on the prize
The super heavy duty extra large king size
Get hypnotized and remember the rhymes
Cuz anything less would be uncivilized

[Chorus]
Get it up, get, get it up, get it up
Got, got, got to get it up (for the man of the year)
Get it up, get it up, get, get it up
Got, got, got to get it up (raise your glasses and cheer)
Just get it up (in your town)
Just get it up (hear the sound)
Just get it up (get it down)
Just get it up (all around)

[The Last Emperor]
Enemies beware; my raps are fire-y 
Sort of like Shakespeare's dramatic irony
Pros go from skid row to high society
But I must say I display a wide variety
I'm really that fresh, fill the top entirety
All access, you should stop denying me
I warn any thug who even thinks of trying me
Say no to drugs, you should try sobriety
I maim the crippled guys with pain intensified
Ready to rock and roll with more Soul than Triple 5
I'm make a haunted castle come alive
And anything less would be uncivilized

[Chorus]

[The Last Emperor]
Send the DJ to the royal vault
So he can spin the record while the Emperor talks
If the people don't move is it really your fault?
Then we can hit the floor and do the Emperor's waltz

My rap radiates and makes the ladies shake
And you can bet what I rep is presented great
Some might debate the respect that I generate
They just want to hate, I'm a man of exquisite taste
Rap etiquette and fly tight tunes
Any manuscript I write rhymes like ruins
New world rapper making old world moves
Phantom of the Opera meets the Snowgoons
Local rap seen on TV screen
Try to intervene and get sent to the guillotine
I go to extremes not to be denied
And anything less would be uncivilized

[Chorus]</pre>
