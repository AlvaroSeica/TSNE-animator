[Geechi Suede]
I dream, a dream, a little dream
and my deepest fantasies they just take control of me
Do it for the seasons we leave these legacies
Mami, dada, grandma, grandpa big holla to Ali

[Geechi Suede]
Do they love em? Do they hate em?
Are they with em, or against them?
I didn't really know, bro
Ijust love em if they hittin
Mr. misunderstood, to my sister, Nagia
Know our love was so good, and the bliss on the heater
To my brother Tomcat, taught me wrong a lot of women
turn him into a strong venom
it's the sin in me
I can't stop
To my little fella Cherokee, I do know
It gets lonely, hello, but's it's only fo' sho

[Geechi Suede]
Valentino's! We knows it grows no deeper
1-9-7! 1-9-8 is even more cheeka
My cubasas! No, my love don't get no better
than  Vogretta Lee (? no idea)
that's my plan, that's just forever
Clear weather for the apple of my eye
White violin under velvet sky
No more mistakes, promise to try
Porky and Ginitho why y'all had to die?
Meet you in the afterworld
When the tides come in, we gon' have the world

[Geechi Suede]
If not for ya'll they'd be no me(Cheeba)
No Chee
no Lo
no glow
no strength
no high life
no wine nights
no dreams on how's it gon' get better
Love ya all

Mecca:
Love is something that no longer has no meaning left
No
Even though we in the streets we still feel love

I'm singing love

Love (repeat)</pre>
