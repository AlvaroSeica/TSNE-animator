we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew
we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew 

(Extra Kool)
Ayo, my favorite thing is fast food and pretty little girls
taking strolls through the park feeding M&amp;M's to squirrels
Smile hard and feel the breeze sipping chocolate milk shakes
Fix the hat, and keep the mobbing, selling salty handshakes
it's almost lunch I can't wait, to tie my shoes and saddle up
blowing love to the beauty watch her lips pucker up
I'm fool as hush you silly clucks and now I got a side ache
live my life through lucky charms, watch my dreams blow away
I'm out the cascade still i'm feeling hot and sassy
snuggle bunny needs to eat, forever walking fat and nasty
ayo my dog tags read emcees wigger please
holding hands in the sun it's only now that i'm free
with a tummy full of feed and a heart like broken guns
it's Extra Kool sick living yo my burrito weighs a ton
(yo I gotta gets me some friend break
put that Mongolian bar-b-q chef in my will, biscuit)

we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew
we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew

(Time)
Guess who's back its Time with his lunch sack
with nutty bars, gummy bears and jello pudding packs
I'm going back to cali for some in'n out burgers
as long as its good food give a darn about murder
I'm a ramen chef with over a 100 different recipes 
hot sauces and ranch is a necessity 
good jesus, I'm sipping on kool-aid and squeeze its
AwareNess cleared out the panda buffet and they can't believe it
too much green tea now my voice is raspy
I'm way past seconds man they'll never catch me
I'm eating fat nasty, junk food, fried bologna
eating rigatoni with the homies playing Sony
gimme breadsticks, eggplant, parmesan and lettuce
I got a fetish with sushi and anything breaded 
I'm the pharaoh of the food pyramid call me king tasty
cause I love it all from the veggies to the pastries
rappers chew my lyrics cuz they so dang delicious
this is my verse sop the rest up with a biscuit x2

we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew
we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew

(Input)
well it's a small man packing up an appetite for fat kids
the type of hunger pains you'll see in an anorexic actress
give me the menu and i'm bound to spend the time
acquiring an order that requests an assembly line
pancakes, peanut butter, bacon and a biscuit
put the gravy in a bowl I'll eat it up for breakfast
the only vegetables that I apply to my own diet
are potatoes that are divvied up and dipped into a fryer
sushi with a girlfriend a smoothie with a mistress
steak with some wine for the girl that's on my wish list
a pie from New York some deli style sandwiches
I like to overdue it cause I still don't know what average is
chips with guacamole, sour cream along with salsa
burritos come equipped with hot sauce and a revolver
from ice cream Sunday to Thai food Thursday
Input's now feeling fat nasty in the worst way

we all enjoy fantastic food
the world don't got it but fantastic do 
every day's buffet for the dirty lab crew
