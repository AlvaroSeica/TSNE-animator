Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Fire it up Fire it up Fire it up [x4]
Salu-Mother Fucking-Tations
Glad you came I see you got a reputation
Your in for a night full of blunts and beers
Drinks and pits come on in don't fear
Now it might get a little restless
But we're all family relax don't stress
You best get out your seats and move to the front
When you hear KMK say FIRE IT UP

Kottonmouth's here smoke that pit
Every single night we get high and don't trip
24-7,365 all around the world we smoke herb world wide
So who got the chronic up in the building
With the buds in my system yo I catch the feeling
Lets fire it up cause tonight's the night
D-Loc got a smoke who got a mother fucking Light

Kottonmouth Kings
Fire it up Fire it up Fire it up

People always wanna know just what they wanna know Fire it up
How much herb we really smoke and how do we rip this show Fire it up
How come high times magazine never put us on they front Fire it up
10 Years deep in this spot for weed now what more could they want Fire it up

Kottonmouth kings
Fire it up Fire it up Fire it up

The kids back with style chronicles
Coming in backwards to get D-Loc
With the with the weed smoke Kottonmouth No joke
Where the weed heads at where the weed at
We bout to kick back kick rhymes
12 pack of the kick down and just sit back so relax
Or get slapped where you at?

Now solve them I'm about to ball boy shit
I ain't no decoy I'm about to destroy
Mass a microphone and a mother fucking tall boy
Pad to the bone spation I'm like elboy see
What you have here is a certified pimp
Walk into the party with a old school limp
Float through the party like the good year blimp
Shrimp on the Bar-B marinated in hemp

Kottonmouth kings
Fire it up Fire it up Fire it up

People always wanna know just what they wanna know Fire it up
How much herb we really smoke and how do we rip this show Fire it up
How come high times magazine never put us on they front Fire it up
10 Years deep in this spot for weed now what more could they want Fire it up

Kottonmouth Kings
Fire it up Fire it up Fire it up [x4]

We the cannabis plant and it hit another nation
Jump with time and it showers legal nation
Jump with time so I plant the cultivation
Its Kottonmouth we get higher elevation

I got a fleet of Mary Jane light my lady on fire
But if I'm in a good mood I use my Vaporizer
If I'm pissed I use a zippo or a blow torch
Lighting bowls in the back yard or the front porch

Aye Yo, You cant take the heat
Get the hell out the kitchen
Call me a chef with the rhymes I be dishing
Like baking no snitch you know we breaking bread
D-Loc don't play got to get out my way.

Kottonmouth Kings
Fire it up Fire it up Fire it up

People always wanna know just what they wanna know Fire it up
How much herb we really smoke and how do we rip this show Fire it up
How come high times magazine never put us on they front Fire it up
10 Years deep in this spot for weed now what more could they want Fire it up</pre>
