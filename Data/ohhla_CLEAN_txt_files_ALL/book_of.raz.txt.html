Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus)
It was on written on papyrus paper
The Book of Heaven Razah
They say the author was an educator
I drop a jewel on a slave trader
He maybe catch on a year later
I'm on my way to up the elevator
It was on written on papyrus paper
The Book of Heaven Razah
They say the author was an educator
I drop a jewel on a slave trader
He maybe catch on a year later
Or who's our True Maker, Lord and Savior?

[Hell Razah]
From Annunaki to a Godbody
Was the Egyptians just an early copy?
Or the Messiah wit his hair knotty
If everyday is evolutionary 
Reborn or die as a spiritual revolutionary
Before the Hebrews it was Nibiru
The Nephelim's knowing good and evil
I was lighting the dark people
With mathematics written on clay tablets
We can interpret like I wrote it backwards
But why is natural disasters or genocide, the slave masters
It was manufactured and was hand crafted
Let's take it back when the angels landed
All Earth was the seventh planet
Before Moses saw the Ten Commandments
I'm in a stance like a praying mantis
When my brain enhances it take my mind state into Atlantis
From the steps out my projects, Reader's Digest
The sun sets over Planet X
Angelical sex, more complex then ancient Sumerian text
Hold my breath till it's only vegetarian's left

(Chorus)

[Hell Razah]
What I've written in the midst of Hip-Hop
God forbid like the Book of Enoch
See I'm a Red Hook astronaut
They get a shock once my album drop
Now who the one that got Malcolm shot?
??Alot consume inside our seeds lot??
Pillars of fire be our chrome wheels
What's a Phantom to Ezekiel's wing?
It's like the devil signed Jesus to a record deal
Or give a freedom to the seed of Israel
Soon as the thug sings
I see an electromagnetic rings
I teleport like Kemetic kings wit angelic wings
Sat in Ã‡umra wit the Theseus
Seen the Giants turn to Philistines, nah'mean?

(Chorus)

(Outro)
And on that day the Book of Heaven Razah was opened
Chapter 2, verse 1
