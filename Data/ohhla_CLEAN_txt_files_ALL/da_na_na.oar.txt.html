[Hook: Scatched over "DAAM!" {Tha Alkaholiks}]
"I'm from the crew that sets it off by sprayin beer in your face
Like a freak on the elevator I'mma fuck you up
I'm from the crew that sets it off by sprayin beer in your face
The liquidator with the hardcore demanor's"
Da na na...

[Chorus #1: Sesta]
Certified Wise in this bitch now "da na na"
Sesta about to put my shit down "da na na"
Who think they got the skill to try to top the bill when we rock for real
It's like

[Verse 1: Sesta]
I'm that kinda guy you find bumping n grinding blind
Tryn'a hit the finest bitch but I wont lie I'm no Bias
A ladies man I'm not, I got KD lang looking slags
Want to know tags up on their fun bags, but fuck that
I'm that hunch back, lumber jack looking scum bag
With pick up lines like "mummy this can I touch that" (ooo come here)
But I'm as charming as a heart attack and fact is
Less attractive than eight Guy Sebastians
On crack with they back kicked in
Still I'm the sickest ever spitting the art and that's an acronym
This crowds packing in, I'll pick up tonight
And nine times out of ten I'm right before that one bit
I'll drink then let the ignorance kick in
Skip the mix and then slip the dick in
If I have a kid I'll call it "Oops Lady"
Raise that baby and I'll pay for the school books

[Hook]

[Chorus #2: Hons]
Certified Wise in this bitch now "da na na"
Sketsy Hons about to put my shit down "da na na"
Who think they got the skill to try to top the bill when we rock for real
It's like

[Verse 2: Hons]
The name's Hons I'm the type of guy you dont
Take home to meet your folks and that ain't no joke
I've got a slight abuse problem from a sick porn addiction
Not to mention booze, gambling and a freak fetish for kissing
I'm a late bloomer, I dont wake till noon
I'm that dealer at the cashy you dropped ya pay check to
On some freak bitch shit I act with cuntish behaviour
I got randoms on repeat till I can beat Chris Money Maker
I'm that chauvinistic pig for you bitch rappers
The piss magget at the bar yelling "shit happens"
The fact is that I'mma gambling addict
At the Taj I'm twenty-fourty, taking stacks from Ben Affleck
Teenage heart throb, party to my heart stop
And I'm outdrinking crews right until the tab at the bar stop
Start with Hons that shit is hopeless bro
Cause you aint nothing but a tortoise try'na b-boy like Pinocchio

[Hook]

[Interlude: Trials]
Yeh we bout to break it down for a quick second
Let the organs play, let the drinks get topped up
and then get right back into it like
Alright, check it
da na na...

[Chorus #3: Trials]
Certified Wise in this bitch now "da na na"
A trigger trial 'bout to put my shit down "da na na"
Who think they got the skill to try to top the bill when we rock for real
It's like

[Verse 3: Trials]
Well I'm the type of guy you find blind drunk
Girl in the trunk tied up
About to pick the kids and wife up
Eyes stuck 'cause sleep is rare
Beef with Trials then that beef ain't fair
Steer clear! You in the cross hairs
Of a cat with nine lives with eight still spare
And a death wish, check the cast like Def Wish
We park for breakfast where the largest breast is
From B cups, C cups, double D cups
At a little hippy show telling emo kids to cheer up
I know being rich kiddies is hard
Like the world knows Tara Reid's titties is scarred
My finishing moves to change what you listening too
Hitting the brew till my brain cells missing a few
All I do, rap about bitches and booze
You dont like it take a seat next to the bitches and boo, mother fuck fuck

[Chorus #4: Trials/Hons/Sesta]
Certified Wise in this bitch now "da na na"
Reflux put ya shit down "da na na"
Who think they got the skill to try to top the bill when we rock for real
It's like

[Scratches by DJ Reflux {sample from "DAAM!" - Xzibit}]
"Yehhh, check it out
Yehhh, Like that
Check it, Check, Check it out
Like that..."</pre>
