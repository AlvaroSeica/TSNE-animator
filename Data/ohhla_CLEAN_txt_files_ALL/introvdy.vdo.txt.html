[Tony Montana]
Okay, here's the story
I come from the gutter. I know that
I got no education... but that's okay
I know the street, and I'm making all the right connections
With the right woman, there's no stopping me
I could go right to the top
Anyway... what I got to tell you is this: I like you
I liked you the first time I laid eyes on you
I say, she's a tiger. She belong to me
Anyway... I want you to marry me
I want you to be the mother of my children</pre>
