[Phonte]
My baby is lonely on this night
She lays in bed all alone
I stayed in the bar all by myself
Mister, won't you play me a song?
No words for the pain inside my heart
But I heard what he played
And I sang along...
I sang along..
'Cause if LOVE, can come to me
in a SONG, and set me free
Then maybe we can truly love again
And I will be yours
I'll be yours
To be yours
I'll be yours</pre>
