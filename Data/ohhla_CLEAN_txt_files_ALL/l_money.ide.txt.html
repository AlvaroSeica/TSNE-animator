[L. Money]
Ideal whattup babe? (L. Money whattup?)
You at it again man
Probably sayin damn these niggaz don't stop
We cain't man, all day, let's go
(This how we get down)

I already told you I don't play around, y'all like to play around
I made it my occupation to lay these haters down
You concentratin on me, y'all niggaz is straight clowns
Y'all niggaz don't understand, what lunch money is about
I be that young nigga, chasin figures, tryin to catch a mill'ah
Watch for them guerillas, them niggaz'll banana peel ya
All y'all old dudes in the game I don't see ya
Cause the screwdriver flow that I hold will straight drill ya
Me and Ideal stay real
Niggaz disappear like Copperfield, homey I remain trill
I'm that nigga y'all wanna be, obviously
Women overseas, roll with G's who handle ki's
I ain't stoppin for nuttin
Anybody in my way I'm crushin nigga, permanent concussion nigga
So y'all dudes better step back, huh
We on top, we're the best at it, homey where your peoples at?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Quit the talkin cause you ain't gon' do nuttin (do nuttin)
Quit the yappin quit the cryin quit the fussin (quit the fussin)
You in my face but you ain't gon' shake nuttin (shake nuttin)
You got a problem lil' homey we can solve it (let's go)</pre>
