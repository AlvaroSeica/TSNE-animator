[Verse 1: PC]
A simple bite of a fruit against the face of destruction
Led to milleniums of pestilence famine and destruction
Seduction of the flesh quickly robbed us of peace
A power trip let power slip to embrace the face of the deep
Now if you peep that brief view of history then you'll know
The story of the fall of man and I hope you've learn alot mo
Because the road thats lest traveled is a tedious one
Must sacrifice clever devices and the secular fun
Because to end the war in Heaven He's proved He's second to none
And even went so far as to deliver his Son
Into the hand of the enemy a plan for cleansing the
Entire earth even while we were s-i-n-n-i-n-g
But yet we blame society for insobriety
Am I the only one knowing the truth that Jesus only died for me?
Naw the ultimate propitiation
To die with humiliation himself to sanctify every nation
And thats real

[Chorus]
Saved by one [I am saved by one]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son, Yeah Jesus]
Saved by one [I'm saved by one only one, Jesus]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son]

[Verse 2: PC]
I thank Jesus just for walking again and talking again
The love he shows me be the reason that I call him my friend
Demons on all sides Satan just'a haulin em in
Father protect me and just catch me from falling in sin
You're my reconciliation when I'm gone in the wind
Your very doctrine never stops being the one I depend on when I'm in a jam or the evil presence of men
Righteously gifted me like Christ when baptized by his kin
Saved by one the Son to be enslaved by none
More than a conqueror over Hell death and the grave I've won
Crucified with him just look at what the Lord has done
Took the shackles off of a jackal so that I'd become his son
Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven
In all my days I could never do what You did in seven
Or even greater what You did in three
Hung bled and died for me my Lord You set me free
How could it be

[Chorus]
Saved by one [Ohhhh yes]
Thanks to your only son [Thank you for saving my soul]
Saved by one [Because of your blood, I'm set free]
Thanks to your only son [Yes i am, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah]

[Verse 3: Big Beem]
Over two thousand years ago a Savior was born
He was adorned with oils and spices but prophesied to mourn
He loved us with open arms but He was beatened and torn
He was crucified despised rejected and scorned
As a youth He grew in wisdom by confounding the wise
Bringing sight to religious leaders by opening eyes
He was one with the Father manifestation of Truth
The Word was made flesh and the kingdom was loosed

(Mo Stylez)
Oh Lord You coming again the soul lover of men
The Lord of Lords and King of Kings when we were loving our sin
You humbled Yo'self and came in the form of the Son
To sacrifice Yo life and do what the flesh couldn't be done
Dear Lord I thank you that You took our place we saved by grace on earth
1 sin had us under a curse
Yo faithfulness led us into this dispensation of grace
To see us seated with you up in a heavenly place
We give thanks

[Chorus]
Saved by one [I am saved by one]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son, Yeah, Jesus]
I am saved by one [I am saved by one, Only one, Jesus]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son]

[Spoken]
For God so loved the world
That he gave his only begotten Son
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish
But hath everlasting life

[Sung]
For God sent not his Son to condemn the world
But that through him, The world might be saved
Now being justified by his blood
We shall be saved [By the blood]
We shall be saved from wrath [By the blood]
Through the blood of Jesus [By the blood]
For if the father shed not his blood, There is no remission [By the blood]
[I'm saved] Cause i'm saved by the blood [By the blood]
I'm saved by the blood [I'm saved] [By the blood]
I'm saved by the blood [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Ohhhhhh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah [I'm Saved] [By the blood]
Oh, Jesus [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Oh, I'm saved [I'm saved] [By the blood]
I'm saved by the blood [I'm saved] [By the blood]
What can wash away my sins? [I'm saved] [By the blood]
What can make me whole again? [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Nothing but the blood [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Nothing but the blood [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh [I'm saved] [By the blood] [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Yeah, I'm saved [I'm saved] [By the blood]
I'm saaaved [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Jesus wins [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Jesus wins at Calvary [I'm saved] [By the blood]
To save a wretch like you and me [I'm saved] [By the blood]
Oh, By his blood, Yes he diiiiiiiid [I'm saved] [By the blood]
