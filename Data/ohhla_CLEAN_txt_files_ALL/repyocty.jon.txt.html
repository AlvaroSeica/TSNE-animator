Rep yo city!!! (what!), rep yo city!!! (what!)
Rep yo city!!! (what!, fuck that shit!, what!), rep yo city!!! (what!)
Rep yo city!!! (what!), rep yo city!!! (what!, fuck that shit!)

[Verse 1: Lil' Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz] - (repeat 2X)
Cut loose motherfucker, go back, go hard!!!
In the club motherfucker, go back, go hard!!!
In the truck motherfucker, go back, go hard!!!
Throw it up motherfucker, go back, go hard!!!

[Verse 2: E-40]
We thirty deep (thirty deep), we bleed the block (bleed the block)
We milk the Ave. for damn near everything the Ave. got (Ave. got)
We do the fools (do the fools!), we act a nut (act a nut)
Set it off up in this bitch and tear the club up!
What it do?, what it is? Pimp Juice (Pimp Juice)
Got a car with the cups in the trunk (in the trunk)
For the thugs and broads with the G-string drawers
Up in here, straight break it all off (break it all off)
Where the dig dogs at?, what city or set you claim?
Fame, X.O., several drinks of champagne (champagne)
Hustlers in the game trying to maintain, lost your chain
Out of control, we so cold (so cold)
I'm on another level (another level)
Went head up with the devil (with the devil)
I never been a sucker (been a sucker)
I always been a rebel (been a rebel)
What's your stomping ground? (stomping ground?)
What turf you from? (turf you from?)
What's your city playboy? (what's your city?) mine 94591
Vallejo! (Vallejo!) that's all I yell (that's all I yell)
Speaking of yell, I hope I don't have to go back to slanging llello (slanging llello)
We fucking around (fucking around), my niggaz out there in Oakland, D-Town
Put it down from my house all the way to your house
Back to the fucking South!

[Chorus: Lil' Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz] + (Petey Pablo in backround)

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Could it be the way that I be repping (why?!), for my niggaz
Could it be the way that Petey Petey (ride!), for my niggaz
Show a nigga love (love!, raise up motherfucker!!)
You need to be reaching down pulling your god damn shirt up, that's love!
Wherever you live, wherever you from, wherever you call your home
Wherever you lay your God damn Kangol down motherfucker!
Wherever you check your cheese, turn C.R.E.A.M., make that butter
Wherever your ass got lots of fat for all that God damn trunk
Y'all niggaz don't understand the seriousness of what Petey be saying
I took an unknown piece of land (and planted), a God damn flag
Say I didn't (did!), motherfucker I'd die for this
I've done my God damn thing, I brought my folks in this summer bitch
Hot Atlanta!, the Bay Area!, y'all niggaz don't want no noise (noise!)
With Lil' Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz (Boyz!)
Y'all niggaz don't want no shit (shit!)
With E-40 &amp; The Click (The Click!)
You can say what you want homeboy (homeboy!)
It'll always be what it is (hey!)

[Chorus: Lil' Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz] + (Petey Pablo in backround)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
From the land of the trill, where the vanity's real
And your man'll be peeled or at least branded, God damn it we ill
More horror than Amityville, no sorrow, hand me the steel
Your tomorrow I can't even feel - ought to be planning your will
UGK ain't dropped in a while, but still we stoping your smile
Keeping boppers in file, standing on top of the pile
And you'll get popped with a smile, this ain't about shopping in style
This about syrup and candy paint, you see us chopping for miles
Out the black and the 'Lac, swingers clap and if they take your flax
You'll get smacked for your packs, paper stacks and you'll crack-back your back
Hold up, they got game to sell you, from drugs to paraphenalia
Guns that'll never fail you, ask Rollie B, he'll tell you

[Verse 5: Eightball]
Memph', Tenn representer (uh), Orange Mile nigga (yeah)
Symbol of the South, legendary rhyme spitter (uh huh)
From Memphis to Mississippi, deep off in the woods (uh)
From ATL to MIA, deep off in the hood (yeah)
Twankies on coupes (yeah), money making sluts (what?)
You tripping if you ain't got 22's on your truck (uh)
Dogs in the yard (yeah), pistol on the seat (uh)
Sticky rolled up for them blunt monkey freaks
My nigga Earl hollered (what's up?) Big Ball got it popping (that's right)
Smoked me a couple, hit the studio and dropped it
For all my dawgs who keep it G and keep it crunk
Represent yo city, let them know where you from
