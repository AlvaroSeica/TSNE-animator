Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Triple O.G.]
Kryme Life in effect, Triple O.G. with him
We gon' set this off, you know the deal
It's happening, just when you thought it was safe
Now you got to lock your door

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
It's my time and I be, on my grind, or the sleep
I'm constantly on my feet, defeat mind
I'm hard as concrete, niggas is weak, with sweet lines
So ask yourself, what's the streets without Kryme
It's like an ill ass beat, without rhymes
Or a schoolboy counting to ten, but skipped nine
Boroughs need me, like the alcoholic need wine
So ask yourself, what's the streets without Kryme

[Kryme Life]
I'll save your mind, I'd rather fuck with the beef than with the swine
Grab the feet, people or choice, lead, deeping the voice
Bring forth a whole new breed, none of us moist
Niggas know they own role, I keep 'em in, good at the cross
Paid thirty for clean fills, pockets all swoll
Me and my boys, pump drills in the project
Bringing the noise, self employed, fuck a straight line
We crooked, wilding then bookings heading for state time
Aiyo from Staten to Brooklyn, my niggas take shine
Got my wolves hollering, looking, you can't escape mine
If you can smell what I'm cooking, when the beef is on
I move swooping the film, and you softer than cushion
Coming through the door, shoving and pushing, throwing my elbow
Like Luda, niggas'll do ya, up in this hell hole
I'm rapping, shooting for platinum, but I don't sell clothes
With the mic, I hold stripes, like a pair of shelltoes

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
Believing, a lot of people wouldn't be eating
It's all we know, they got us running through the street peacing
Clean corners, no policemen, if a nigga wasn't doing his thing
To make ends meet, he fucking up his sequence
A fool would say Kryme don't pay, but you telling me
Caught tickets that move from misdemeanors to the felonies
Heavy surcharges, our rage is bail
That's all money, the judges getting paid like hell
Lawyers and C.O.'s, plus the lawmakers is well
The system lose out, when these jails got empty cells
Don't even speak about the inmates, drop and load, til they all count
For the phony conversary, just to think straight
Living the legal life, I'mma get paid
Cuz when you live a legal life, there's a lot at stake
People die, leave they families to cry at wake
Daughters and sons growing up, without no one to guide them safe

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
