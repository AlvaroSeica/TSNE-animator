Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Wrapped in XLR cables
Up from my whiskers, down to my fuckin' kicks
Wreck-O was echoed in Gordon Geckos
You suckin' dick
Nobody be askin' me for secrets
I ain't chuckin' tips
I'd rather be bumpin' hips
On that ratchet with muffin tits
Tore up the limits
From Britan visions would rock their lives
Inside a prison where giddy bitches don't jock the rhyme
Born in precision
Rhythm spittin' could swat a fly
For them to just kick a single shillings from Spotify
Bye, Bye killers
On a high five business
Gonna ride by the sickest
In your high ride to the hitlist
If we ain't spoke in ages
Then miss me with broken favors
You Miley Cyrus to majors
You twerkin' on swollen razors (run now)
Dont make me come to dinnernail your tounge down
And have you plead your case to us
At Strangeland at sundown
Be careful of the biz
Cause everything has got a price attached
Wake up with a horse head in your bed
And next your life is snatched

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Tank full of petro
Bank full of paesos
Pull on my tour bus
Bonus on a payroll
Feel like I be killin' it
Famous on the internet
Really I'm just wingin' it
Cookin' shit on my Kitchenett
Life so good
Right now I need to celebrate
Bout to sell a stadium out
And turn it into rake
Look at how the industry norm
Has started lookin' Strange
All my brothers riding the storm
While they just ride the waves
Caviar wishes
Bitches for my bitches
Black shades and hoodies
And spots and white linens
Feel like Sam Kinison
Preachin' to these citizens
Screamin' at the saints
You ain't ever gonna get rid of us
Guessin' that I just cleaned my plate
So now I'm gettin' cake
Speedin' down the interstate
Yellin' get out the fuckin' way
We plant flags in the ground
Because we here to stay
And bring my whole hood out
And have my own parade

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
(Black Gold!)
I purposely wrote this verse
Just to murder this
Member defecate
Disassemble the limbs
Of a nigga who try and seperate
Artistry from nonfiction
Im sent with a conviction
To sentence you pons
Givin' the benz on my diction
There he goes
Speakin' bout how he murk a beat
Smellin' himself
Why else would he flaunt about it so verbally
Dance around me
Like I was a paraplegic
In a doo-cee-doo competition
Lookin pissed like I never heard of feet
Yadda Yadda
A whole lotta yappin'
About my rappin'
When I'm the captain
Of crunchin' you niggas milky dreams
Im the comparison of Pac's face
Staring in your face
Mock razor blades cut
Leave you crispy clean
Don't ask Tech
Ask me if it's questions
Guarantee that he tell you
That I'm the best
And Im destened
To find a snake and a bat
Helpin' Kansas City's progression
Hopin' I hurt the feelings
Of whoever second guessed it
Cause everybody talkin'
Imma make you niggas hear me
Mind control flow
Now listen to your ears bleed

[Verse 4: Ubiquitous]
Spit it sicker than these sicker fans
Keep your dick up in your pants
You were blunted on the block
Me, I had some different plans
I'm trying to get to France
Sniffing grams
Hit a branch
Independent Powerhouse
Vibin' out with the fam
Waking up in different cities
Every night hittin' grants
Stay prepared for this
I'm bearing witness to this sinner man
Stripper dance with cinnamon
Clubbin' with my gentelman
Drink away the nights events
Nothing worth remembering
Squad will run up in this bitch
Mobbin' like some immigrants
Jack you for your paper stack
Rob you of your innocence
Taping of the scene of crimes
Swabbing for my fingerprints
Thought about my life
You thought the same
And couldn't think of shit (Ha!)
This type of fire dont extinguish
Now write about some bigger shit
You're striking out
Swing and miss
Ring around the rosy homie
Pocket full of pain
I got a lock up on my lane
And triple optic in my brain, look</pre>
