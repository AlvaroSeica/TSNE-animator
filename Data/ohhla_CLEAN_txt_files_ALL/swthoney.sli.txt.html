Put up your hands girl but not so,so pushy
If you wanna be comn' and makn' sweet love to me
And if your the type of girl that do anything me please
Maybe then i realize you ain't got what i need
To keep my soul alright
It keeps me up high above
Yes me got the reason to come question your love
It keeps my soul alright
It keeps me up high above
Want me girlie to come give me some sweet lovn'
And in the morning time she makes me feel alright
Then me gotta be waitn' till the day turns to night
Cause in the evening time she makes me feel alright
Girl you got me wishin' this would happen every night
[miles and sister]
Said if you want to get with me
Girl this is what you'll find
But a man who's got the type of moves to make u loose your mind
You tell me that your love is true on each and every day
You tell me that you've got that type of lovn' here to stay
SWEET HONEY

[kyle]
You see me laughin'
Cause it's kinda funny to me
The way she say she never give her lovn' for free
She say she got a man why she lookn' at me
Yes she want a lover with the sensativity ya
[miles]
But wont you tell me that your loves from the heart
Yes the type of lovn' that can tear a man apart
Girl you got to realize before it ever starts
Yes i am the man who wont come breakn' your heart

[miles and sister]
Said if you want to get with me
Girl this is what you'll find
But a man who's got the type of moves to make u loose your mind
You tell me that your love is true on each and every day
You tell me that you've got that type of lovn' here to stay
SWEET HONEY
She gonna steal my money
