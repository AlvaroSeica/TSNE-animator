[Chorus: Danielle Ray &amp; DJ Mercilless]
This is going on each day around you
Just take a look and see
We can't always believe (no we can't)
What we see on T.V. (uh uh)

[Verse 1: Cale Sampson]
What's up with Paris Hilton being treated different?
Just because she's rich she gets to get out of prison
If she was really in jail, she wouldn't last an hour
Especially if she ever dropped soap in the shower
These party chicks like Lindsay Lohan
And Nicole Richie are out of control man
Their supposed to be role models to young girls
While they're drinking and driving and starving themselves
Sick of wannabe rappers like Kevin Federline
C'mon man, my grandma could write a better rhyme
Couldn't even sell and he's a celebrity
He should of just stuck to freeloading off Brittney
But she's no better when she gets bad news
She goes and shaves her head and gets a bunch of tattoos
Yelling at her kids and eating a Big Mac
While trying to drive her self back home from rehab

[Chorus 1: Cale Sampson]
Everywhere you go (go) anywhere you look
It's all a big show, so many people getting hooked
Yo with all the Distractions (Distractions)
We gotta be aware, man it's time to take action

[Chorus 2: Danielle Ray &amp; DJ Mercilless]
This is going on each day around you
Just take a look and see
We can't always believe (no we can't)
What we see on T.V. (uh uh)

[Verse 2: Cale Sampson]
These days you gotta be careful what you do
Or end up naked in a movie on Youtube
People shoot you when you don't even know it
With cell phone cameras then go around and show it
So if you got drunk off too many pitchers
You might wake up and be tagged in fifty pictures
For all your friends on Facebook to see
"Hey!" there's no such thing anymore as privacy
It's a crazy world, this day in age
You got girls lining up to marry Flavor Flav
"I Like!" getting sick of Donald Trump
When's someone gonna say "You're fired you little chump!"
Some dude from N'Sync announced "I'm Gay!"
No way Jose, we all thought you were straight
Geez' no one would have ever thought that would happen
Guess he probably saw that movie Brokeback Mountain

[Chorus 1: Cale Sampson]
Everywhere you go (go) anywhere you look
It's all a big show, so many people getting hooked
Yo with all the Distractions (Distractions)
We gotta be aware, man it's time to take action

[Chorus 2: Danielle Ray &amp; DJ Mercilless]
This is going on each day around you
Just take a look and see
We can't always believe (no we can't)
What we see on T.V. (uh uh)

[Verse 3: Cale Sampson]
Tell me where on earth is Osama Bin Laden
I think we need Dog the Bounty Hunter to catch him
Why is it so hard to see this guy
Are we just blind, somebody call C.S.I.
Cuz' Tom Cruise is acting strange on Oprah
Screaming "I'm in love!", jumping around on her sofa
Now Katie Holmes is part of his colony
That protects earth, "It's the church of Scientology!"
A crazy guy in North Korea wants control
Over the globe even if it means the end of the world
And Hurricane Katrina, have we already forgot her
There's still people in New Orleans waiting and treading water
The world's at war, that's reality
Who cares about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie
So if you agree, let's all make some more noise
Sing it with me once more, at the top of your voice

[Chorus 1: Cale Sampson]
Everywhere you go (go) anywhere you look
It's all a big show, so many people getting hooked
Yo with all the Distractions (Distractions)
We gotta be aware, man it's time to take action

[Chorus 2 - 2X: Danielle Ray &amp; DJ Mercilless]
This is going on each day around you
Just take a look and see
We can't always believe (no we can't)
What we see on T.V. (uh uh)</pre>
