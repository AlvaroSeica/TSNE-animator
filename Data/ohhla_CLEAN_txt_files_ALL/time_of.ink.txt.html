[Intro]
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta, leave
I think I gotta, hey!
Yeah, Kid Ink, uhh, yo

[Chorus]
I said
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta leave
My bad, I know this ain't usually your scene
But don't worry 'bout it girl just be yo'self
And I swear I ain't gon' I ain't gon' say a thing
Now go on just, have the time of your life
Time of your life, let it go
And have the time of your life
Time of your life, and let it show

[Kid Ink]
Yeah~! Let me show you how we doin
Know I came through deeper than the sewer
Yeah I got my whole crew and, you could be anywhere
All around the world, but if you ain't fuckin here
then I don't know what you doin
I see, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta drink
Cuz we by my table I got everything you need
Bottles, kush, blowin like a whistlin referee
Take a shot don't be afraid, girl just put on for yo' team
Go on 'head, show me what you got
Take a ride, back it up and baby park it in my lot
Said you dont even need a cup, take a bottle of Ciroc
And when you hear me yell cut that mean take it from the top now

[Chorus]

[Kid Ink]
Nah~! It ain't no reason to be insecure
You sick of the same thang, baby here's a cure
Just take a lane change, welcome to the fast life
Ass like that, bring it back like the past life
Yeah~ I said you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta be so shy
We'll be up all night, no we never out of time
Feel like ain't nobody see me outta sight
Outta mind gimme twenty-five to life for bein fly
It's a crime yeah; I'm lyin I don't wanna go
nowhere but the sky, feelin high as I wanna so
Come and take a ride, the alumni honor role
And I can put it down, take you down baby on the low

[Chorus]

Let it show {*4X*}
