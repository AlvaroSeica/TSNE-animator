[Chris Elliot - "Get a Life"]
I'm not modeling anymore for the two of you!
Well I guess I just had my first taste of the filthy side of this business

Modeling just sucks
Modeling just sucks

Modeling just sucks
Modeling just sucks

Modeling just sucks
Modeling just sucks

Modeling just sucks
Modeling just sucks

I am a male model, not a male prostitute!
Modeling just sucks -- they made me take off my top!
I am a male model, not a male prostitute!
Modeling just sucks -- they made me take off my top!

I am a male model, not a male prostitute!
Modeling just sucks -- they made me take off my top!
I am a male model, not a male prostitute!
Modeling just sucks -- they made me take off my top!

I'm not modeling anymore for the two of you!
