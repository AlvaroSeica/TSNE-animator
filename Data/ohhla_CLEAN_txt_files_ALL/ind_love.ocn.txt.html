[Frank Ocean]
Ohh
Every girl that I met on tour I knew none of them would last
Cause it wouldn't work, nah it wouldn't work
A hundred chicks contacts in my phone about half of them I smashed
I put in work, oh I put in work
But there's something missin I know
Feels like I've gotta lambo with no gas to go
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
That girl just let me know

[Chorus]
I need love
Girl, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Girl, I need you, oh, I neeeeed
I need love in the morning, in the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Frank Ocean]
Two weeks ago I woulda never admit I had it bad, oh
I wouldn't do it, nah no
Cause 15 days ago Iever knew you, so never knew how this felt
Had no clue, I was too cool
But now I can't go a day without ya
I wake up eating breakfast thinkin 'bout ya
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
No, don't ever leave me 'lone

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
I wanna wake up from this dream
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay
And I know it'll work girl
There's nowhere I'd rather be because I need

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Baby in the night
Ohhhhhhhh~!</pre>
