[Darien Brockington]
The more I get, the more you're wanted
Baby I'm tryin hard to make you happy
Maybe I don't say I love you like I used to
Please never doubt that I love you and I mean what I say

[Chorus: Darien Brockington]
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Just come around
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Our love will come around, babe

[Darien Brockington]
Don't trip when I come in home late
You must not know just how much you mean
Go if don't need, just be sure
Cause all your wants and needs won't be ignored
I don't care what your friends have to say
I don't really care what it is they think
I'm working hard, tryin to make these ends meet
I'm not going nowhere, baby please believe me

[Chorus: Darien Brockington] {X2}
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Just come around
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Our love will come around, babe

[Darien Brockington]
I won't let my time cost me to lose you
Cause I'ma love you everyday
Just want that feeling that we used to
Cause I'ma love you everyday

[Chorus: Darien Brockington]
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Just come around
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Our love will come around, babe

[Darien Brockington]
The more I get, the more you're wanted
Baby I'm tryin hard to make you happy
Maybe I don't say I love you like I used to
Please never doubt that I love you and I mean what I say

[Chorus: Darien Brockington]
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Just come around
Lady, have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around? Our love will come around, babe</pre>
