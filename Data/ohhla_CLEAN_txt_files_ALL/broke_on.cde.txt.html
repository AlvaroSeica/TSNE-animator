[Phase Fate]
		Used to be a gun-slinger
		What happened to that?
		Used to shoot from the hip
		At your bullshit lip
		Used to split heads
		Now I splice genes
		Used to jump into bed without means
		And give residual sweet dreams
		And how I hate to hesitate now
		My haste has slowed down
		No more wastin' rounds
		Now and then I get the feelin' at the Stop N Shop
		I'm a sneak up from behind
And steal a gun from that fake cop
Squeeze off at fat ass
And blast bottle caps
At the trash with Ziploc baggies for their stashes
You can drive your Hummers 'til they crash
It's Earth rape
The latest, it's a planetary smash
I hate when y'all are buyin' shit that you don't need
I hate the store for chargin' you for their greed
I hate the industry pollutin' the airwaves
Left hand's a lighter, right hand is the hairspray
But even when I say I don't get no fair play
I forgive all my brothers for being led astray
How easy I can judge through a tongue and a fist
See the real enemy, we strap our own fat wrists

[Off Topic]	I always said that I'd never buy I gun
Because I'd go broke on bullets, shooting everyone
Quick to pull it and squeeze off for fun
Yeah, I'm laughing
[Phase Fate] But it's never easy when it really happens

[Off Topic]
Kill the pain with Nyquil, fuck it
Drank the whole bottle, passed out
And kicked the bucket
Resurrect a rhyme and dub it
For warfare
Chemicals airborne and hard rain
Soak into your pours
Disrupt your fucking membranes
Anarchy
And I'm the king of the rebellion
Got a hundred million kids with their fists in the air yelling
All hungry
Ready to die for the money
So I feed 'em twenty's
Til they're buried in my country
We share same struggle
Trying to run the same hustle
Y'all just hate 'cause my weight holds more muscle
Than your Truffle Shuffle, man
Don't challenge the fam-
I got a crew of emcees who'll rip a hole in your dreams easily
Cruise the block until my army's complete
And then deploy the fleet
Night-vision M16's
Take your buildings down brick-by-brick
Been killing it ever since I wrote I Think I Exist
A 12-Bit Lifestyle, that's what I live
Instructed on that vibe by them EDK twins
I got a mind full of scars wrapped in bandages
And I don't give a fuck when I'm feeling dangerous

[Off Topic]	I always said that I'd never buy I gun
Because I'd go broke on bullets, shooting everyone
Quick to pull it and squeeze off for fun
Yeah, I'm laughing
[Phase Fate] But it's never easy when it really happens</pre>
