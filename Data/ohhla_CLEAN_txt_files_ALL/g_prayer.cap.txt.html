[Main Verse: Mr. Capone-E]
Heavenly Father, please hear me tonight...
I need so much guidance til I live my life right...
Sometimes, the pressure's too hard to bear...
All for one or if anyone cares...
How can I wake up, I face everyday...
Knowin' I must live my life's crazy way...
Heavenly Father, forgive all my sins...
Give me the strenght to resist the raw fire that I desire...
Help me escape the temptation and the fire...
Please help my family whose eye's slightly beat...
Not to do wrong and they pray for me...
God bless a mother who cry every night...
One will be killed by someone in the fight...
Heavenly Father, please answer my prayers...
Please let me know if you're still listening up there...
When will it add...
What it is all for...
To prove to my homies I'm down and hardcore...
Sometimes, I wonder...
How will I die...
By a bullet wound, or a knife on my side...
Heavenly Father, please hear me tonight...
Show me the way, Lord, show me the light...
Give me my heart pain so I won't have to fight...
Thank you for the forgiveness, and still being the most in my life...

[Mr. Capone-E]
Look at me
Look at me
I'm the fucking bad guy
All pigs lie the say
Fuck you
