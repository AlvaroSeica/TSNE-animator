[Killa Tay] 
Uh huh, Yeah 
We gone call this one big scrilla 
For all my niggas out there thug pimpin 
D-1A up in this muthafucka, ya' know 
For yall sucka ass niggas, uh 

Hollerin all the cheap shit, but you aint rappin right nigga 
Gimmie the mic, feel me like you appetite nigga 
Supposed to be hard, but y'all ain't actin like niggas 
Probably go both ways like a hermaphrodite nigga 
Bitch mades cant get no love 
I hit the highway like O.J, with blood on my gloves 
I roll like young buck, homies wanna hang with me 
But I'm a killa on the grind livin dangerously 
I'm thug pimpin, from ?? to Australia 
Never been a failure better believe it when I tell ya 
Sell you nothin but the A-1 yeh 
The innovator, pistol players manditory one shot 
To end the story the glory days is over 
If you dont work, you dont eat 
All that talkin is cheap mayne, this hustle game is deep 
Back from the ??, west cola till they burry me 
With a bullet in my casket 
To lift my soul and keep them scared of me 
Work, like chemotherapy, when i let loose with the ?? 
So relentless, we sneakin, and creepin and keepin it off the hinges 
Bullys wit Fullys pullin strings like Jimi Hendrix 
Fuck a trick biotchh, when it comes to my click, my love is illest, IIIII -stick em like syringes, hard, heavy and devy 
I do whatever it take in life to make continous fetti 
Ready and willing killin them all off like nazi's 
No time for the he say she say we stay sloppy of that broccolli, 
we mob deep 

[Chorus] 
Ride for my niggas 
Stay on the grind down to die for my niggas 
We real killas, big scrilla 
Blazin up doja zips 
Nigga, one false move and its over with, we blast 
And mash hard, livin large like a rock star lookin out for cop cars 
Mob life is, money over bitch, fuck a snitch, we the niggas hittin licks, 
flippin bricks gettin rich off tricks 

[Killa Tay] 
I put it down for my homies, Fresno to Toronto 
Imagine if im livin in dead, head hauncho 
All up on your shit, westside represent, 
money and dope fuck a bitch, im a balla and a pimp 
Nigga we real ridas, aint no studio killas 
Leavin them hurt, doin the dirt, puttin in work for the scrilla 
We mofioso, fuck the po-po, federali's and task 
Got fifth cap, when i ride around and the funk down we blast 
Skid off in they ass like gas, and get my strike on 
Hit the back route to my ?? cause im sleepin with my nikes on 
I'm seein facin hearin voices at my window 
Maybe these niggas is comin for me or maybe its the indo 
Sometimes I feel like I'm the that's doin ?? 
Cause I'm shady to my own lady, smokin up all my dank 
Down to blow, been funkin wrong lately 
I'm under pressure, with a tazer under my pillow 
and a glock on top of my dresser 
My bitch say I'm paranoid, and my momma think I'm special 
But fuck them, I cant trust nobody but Dan Wessern 
Its a, cold game, they only know me by my code name 
Agent 187, smobbin ?? sprayin cocaine 

[Chorus] 

[Killa Tay] 
Damging bodies is a hobby they try to stop me but i mash hard 
Livin on the run like a track star so why act hard 
You know we packin when its time for some action 
These niggas never see me like revy jackson 
We be taxin they ass like IRS, I bring death 
They call me the grim reaper, creepin and sneakin em with the left 
Till they tone death my tank on F, I smash out 
I ain't no punk smokin dope blunts till I pass out 
I'm a rida, I love my momma mayne I'm puttin in work 
And doin dirt, skeet skirt, off the block, fuck the cops 
I'm the bully on the block, with fully on the spot 
When you see us ain't no love, we some thugs on the spot 
Watch, these papers gone turn 
Before the burn my im like a crooked attorney 
My money dirty like a football jersey at halftime 
Cause a nigga on a savage ass rhyme poppin my 9 for my past time 
But now I make mine the honest way 
Cant let em fuck me like they did my folks ?? 
My momma say im in too deep, but i cant change 
And it seem like my baby boy gone grow up doin the same thang 
Gotta gang bang, gotta make change 
Caught up in this thug shit, busta catch a slug quick 
It ain't no love trick 
I got hoes, from the crest side to the east side O' 
We get a sack and hit the track and ride slow thug livin nigga 

[Chorus till end] 
I ride for my niggas </pre>
