Ohh Heh!x2

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Yo! I'm tryin not to wear three X's no more
It's OK now Carter stand 6'4
You can hear the insecurity in my voice right
I don't take my chain off on the mics
My security piece
It gives me security(security)
I'm waiting for the ghetto to secure me
I just put away thirty percent for my taxes
Twenty for the feds, the rest under my matress Huh
I gave my wallet a botox injection
A bunch 'a rude boyz in'a your section
Trynna give my tax bracket an erection
A seventies entity Girl look at my complexion
If you can smell my cologne, you're too close
You small time, My +net+ what you made +gross+
Seven days everyday when you from around my way
I'm married to the life girl,catchin the bouquet

[Chorus: Kardinal Ofishall &amp; Pusha-T]
Set It Off(Ohh Ohh Ehh!)
Fire Me Up x4
Hold It Down((Ohh Ohh Ehh!)
Yeah That's It x4

[Verse 2: Pusha-T Of Clipse]
Pusha, Yeah
Trim set 'em Thin better than I 
Comin through in the slim leathers that's followed by the fives
My and My Niggas call the coupe Jekyl and Hyde 
'Coz the roof's On and Off's Like They In and Out Of Their Minds
Eggshell pale ti-da-tota on the scale
The old nine's is out and I ain't waiting on a deal
The same time the mothafuckers bargaining and lawyering  
That coke money just keep pouring in and pouring in
Quarter mil bling-bling, That's the price of fame, lame
I should have a title and a D.E on the chain man
Re-up Gang pyrex over pie roll
Stir it till it's hard, Pop it out, let it dry slow
Recipe for Greatness Me and Carty now Nigga taste this
You fucking with the A-list. Face it.
Nigga this tha' swag Four-eighty-five hangin' off my ass 
We call it Frivolous cash ( What the fuck)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Malice of Clipse]
(Now listen)
Superstar Like Lupe
See me in the Coupe Hot damn It's a new day
I remove the roof as if it's a toupe
To shed light on the jewels, Glue on blu-ray
High definition
I get cash two-twenty on the dash and a self start ignition
Tola don't love me but she keep insisting
Brain so good it's hard to keep my distance
Red Carpet entrance play clothes fashion
Nose in the air I smell a chanel platinum
Re-Up is the Gang, I rep with a passion
Till the wheels fall off and It all Come crashing
Malice with Mr. Carter now
Behind dark tint like we on the prowl
Nothing like money make a bitch loose her blouse
Well done homie, we rich take a bow.

[Chorus]

Ohh Heh!x2
Ohh Ohh Ehh!x7</pre>
