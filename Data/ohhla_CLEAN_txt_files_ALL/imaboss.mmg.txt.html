WHOO~! WHOO~! {Jahlil Beats, holla at me~!}
Look I be riding through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip (yessir)
Same old attitude but I'm on that new shit (yup)
They say they gon' rob me, see me never do shit (never)
Cause they know that's the reason they gon' end up on a news clips
Audemar on my wrist, bustdown (bling)
We poppin bottles like I scored the winning touchdown (score)
Remember me dead broke? Look at me, up now
I run my city from South Philly back to Uptown
Thank God, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped
I done sold 100,000 before my album got dropped
And I'm only 23 I'm the shit now look at me
Look at me I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shorty ask'd me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
Cause I made it from the bottom it was never no way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm with the murder team (murder team), call the cops (call the cops)
We in the building (we in the building), y'all are not (y'all are not)
You short on the paper, you gon' ball or not

[Chorus: Meek Mill] + (Rick Ross)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I play the shots (HUH), I call the costs (HUH)
We in the bitch, it's goin' down
Yeaa I'm the king now where my mu'fuckin' crown? (HUH)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss), bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) {3X}
I play the shots (HUH), I call the costs (yeah)
HEY~!

[Rick Ross]
Got so many shades they thought I had a lazy eye (HUH)
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride (HUH)
No love cry when only babies die 
And when I go that casket better cost a hundred thou 
I pray to god I look my killer in his eyes 
Snatch his soul out that shirt let's take him for that ride
OG is one who standin on his own feet 
A boss is one who guarantee we gone eat (HUH)
Fuck a blog dawg cause one day we gon' meet
I'm a spazz on yo ass like I'm on E
Or a double stack better nigga double that
Jerry Jones money nigga you a running back
Herschel Walker (what), Bo Jack (ha)
Ricky Waters, better run that dope back
Boss, and I put that on my Maybach 
Fo' hundred thou' bitch you wish you saved that

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Couple cars I'ont never drive (nah), bikes I'ont never ride (nah)
Crib I ain't never been (what), pool I'ont never swim (never)
Fool you ain't better (nah), I move like the president (yeah)
Err thang black on black you know I be strappin that
Rattin ass niggas walkin round wearin wires (what)
Fuckin up the game, got the hood on fire (it's hot)
Bitch I'm a king (king), call me "sire"
If you say I don't run my city you a MUTHAFUCKIN LIAR~!
Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss), you a fraud (you a fraud)
You cross the line, I get you murdered for a cost (MURDER)
Out in Vegas (out in Vegas), I took a loss (took a loss)
At the fight we watchin' Floyd we on the floor (we on the floor)
Yeah, scared money don't make no money
I ever go broke I'mma take yo money
I ain't never dropped a dime, you ain't take nuttin' from me
In the hood err day bitch I'm good what I say

[Chorus]</pre>
