Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Sweet southern smell of summer in Savannah
Tailgate drop Tuscaloosa, Alabama, that's my hometown
Yeah that's my hometown

New York City, subway on the run
San Diego surfers, soaking in the sun
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

We got blue collar people
Little pink houses
White church steeples
Wishes in a fountain
If you know every name on your street
And you know them then you know me
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

Trash can fire, north Detroit
Seventh inning stretch Chicago, Illinois
That's my hometown
America's my hometown

Down in Nashville, out in Hot Springs
Seattle, San Antone, doin' our thing

We got blue collar people
Little pink houses
White church steeples
Wishes in a fountain
If you know every name on your street
And you know them then you know me
That's my hometown
America's my hometown
Yeah that's my hometown
America's my hometown

Stars shinin' down on Memphis at night
Reminds me of those Las Vegas lights
Big Sky Montana to New Orleans
And every one light city that sits in between
That's my hometown
America's my hometown
Yeah that's my hometown
America's my hometown

We got blue collar people
Little pink houses
White church steeples
Wishes in a fountain
If you know every name on your street
And you know them then you know me
That's my hometown
America's my hometown
Yeah that's my hometown
America's my hometown</pre>
