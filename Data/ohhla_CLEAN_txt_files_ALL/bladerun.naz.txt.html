[Chorus 2X: Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, it's the blade runner, face gunner, mace never
Cold case catcher, base stretcher, erase your face setter

[June Megalodon]
Yo, walk wit a blade, gray sunshine sun shade
Walk guys are small fries, I'm pharaoh
There it lies, focus the barrel, friend rule
Food for head and chest, lay you to rest
Even in O.T., I'm home team
Three dogs, three guns, five fought
Whoever want it, get smoked like blunted
Peacefully put, get pulled like ruts or roots
Always in case for the loot
Compound your bloody compute, wisely maintain
Mandible Max Payne, the gang, your whole gang's in flames
Entice my foes, spit your flows
After the laughter comes the ears
I compesated more beers than MC's careers
Hip hop cheers, blood, sweat, real niggas rep your set
Red hoes in my bow, keeps the cold
Bull run calm and ain't it
The FL we made it, brown speech
Ultimate proportions, was enormous
Wordplay, gorgeous george shit
Driver that got award shit
Bleed bloodclots more hits

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, we come through like sperm behind the diaphragm
Scratch the surface of the cervix, form iron hands
And accordion low, black they capo
Saxophone higher blade for saxon-anglo
My wife growing bangles, threats in the mail
They discovered DNA fragments to mark my trail
Elusively hunt, then dungeon punging
A roamer of believements, through digital sequence
See this gleem in his eye, soon they hold the truth
When the glare disppear, slash anything that move
Microphone dudes, coolers disfuse like osmosis
Slap mother nature, for fusing as the focus
Poisonous windrafts, gas you off the path
Head in concrete crash like rocks in river raft
I spell the math, engraved in sculpture
Pricked and accupuncture, from the claws of an vulture
Violent altar, wave sound pound the ground
Infuriated fists, crack the streets in your town
Violent backlash, contained on phonograph
So full of wrath, they mix equilibrium crash
Ninja mass welded from elephant horn
Fighting electric wolves with vocal extension cords
Apprehension, propeltial inmate to bars
Aloy still measure from the mind that lift cars
Release your album, you fucking with ours
And that's mine, niggas get they lives summarized
Like your favorite long summertime, shine of a gunning night
Boy run your mic</pre>
