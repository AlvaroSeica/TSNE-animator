[Intro: slaves conversing]
Hey junior, where's everybody going?
  (Man, we's free! We finna get our freedom)
Whaat? But Master THomas been good to us, why we leaving?
Why we leaving now?

{"Souljah, Souljah" is repeated in the background}

[Sister Souljah]
The time for scared, lip-trembling, word-changing, 
Self-denying, compromising, knee-shakin' black people is over!
If you have something to say, speak up with
authority and conviction
If not, sit down and shut up!
We have to have the POWER to tell the TRUTH!
To say WHATEVER is necessary
To do what NEEDS to be done
WHATEVER it is, no matter who it may hurt!

[Chorus] {"Souljah, Souljah" is repeated in the background}
TELL 'EM WHO I AM!! C'mon!
TELL 'EM WHO I AM!! C'mon!

[Sister Souljah]
Souljah was not born to make white people feel comfortable
I am AFRICAN first, I am BLACK first
I want what's good for me and MY people first
And if my survival means your total destruction, then so be it!
YOU built this wicked system
They say two wrongs don't make it right
But it DAMN sure makes it even!

{beat changes}

(Yeah, you can speak and all of that, but can you rhyme, Sister?)

[Sister Souljah]
Souljah's creating the statements I'm stating...
Meant to be real, never accomodating...
I give it to you straight, I don't water it down...
No need to debate, I don't change it around...
Well if the truth hurts, well then you'll be in pain
And if the truth drives you crazy, you'll die insane
Now you can tell Ted Koppel, and even Dan Rather
Cameras and light won't affect the matter...
Yeah, I know your nerves are wrecked to hear a woman that's a rebel
Well you heard the bass, but Souljah's the treble
The experts, the scientists, Phd's
Souljah pays no homage to a paper degree
My mind is mine, my thoughts are a friend to me
DAMN your color and white world supremacy
Got ya drippin and sweatin, you can't believe what I said
Wait for me to change my MIND, hold your breath, you'll be dead...
Dead, dead, dead, dead...</pre>
