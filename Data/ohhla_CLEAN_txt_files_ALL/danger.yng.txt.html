Lets Go 
I like the 
the way she dance 
she take the thug 
put them in the trance 
She shake the 
like an avalanche 
Look into her eyes 
And you taking the chance 
I see the fire in her eyes 
Fire in her eyes 
The way she moves 
She got the fire in her eyes 
Fire on her waist 
Fire in her thighs 
I love the scandal 
She so dangerous (dangerous) 
She's so dangerous (dangerous) 
She's so scandolous (scandolous) 
I love the scandal 
Hear me sing 
Wohoo Hear she comes 
Watch out boy she'll chew you up 
She's dangerous (dangerous) 
Dangerous (dangerous) 
I love the scandal 
She's fine She's fine 
She heals She mine 
Black barbie

She got hundred men and boosting? 
I ain't really trying to let you in 
But you can spend your Benjamins 
Make no mistake bout it she your friend 
Pisses all about differences 
Wait she like to play games 
And she don't care who she play wit' 
She do what she do 
And she gon' get what she gon' get 
She hit the strip club 
And she gon' make her money quick 
Shake it 
Down the pole 
And make beleive the normal beat (?) 
I like the way 
the way she dance 
She take the thug 
Put 'em in a trance 
She shake the 
Like an avalanche 
Lookin to her eyes 
And you takin' a chance 
I see the fire in her eyes 
Fire in here eyes 
The way she moves 
She got the fire in her eyes 
Fire on her waist 
Fire on her thighs 
I love the scandal 
She's so dangerous (dangerous) 
She's so dangerous (dangerous) 
She's so scandolous (scandolous) 
I love the scandal 
Hear me sing

Watch out boys

You call your momma 
Lemme see your move

Get crunkish (?)

So I spend the money to see it 
I love them girls that belly dance 
Drop it down low 
And shake that

Shorty look like her ma 
Remind me of a coke cola bottle 
She a bad problem 
With her mind on the riches 
So bad she pimp him 
All about that mighty dollah, yeah 
Trying to rip what she ain't gonna hollah 
Send for the fry (?)
