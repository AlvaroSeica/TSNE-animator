[Everlast]
I was too busy countin all my zeroes
Never really thought too much about heroes
Never really thought too much about, any one but me
Never really opened my eyes wide enough so that I could see

[Chorus]
But I'm just like you, you're just like me
And I'm just like you, you're just like me
We're only separated by a few degrees
And I'm just like you, you're just like me
Just like me... just like me

[Everlast]
Never really thought too much about tomorrow
Never really dealt very well with sorrow
Tired of livin my life like a feather floatin on the breeze
Trying to find me a good woman that can bring me down to my knee

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
I think I've always tried to do the right the right thing
I've been a little to scared to ride the lightening
Tired of livin my days, surrounded by all these fears
Still stuck in my ways, haven't changed after all these years

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Just like me... just like me</pre>
