[Verse 1]
You will always be an angel in my eyes
Blues and grays you been by my side
When my worlds crashing and pains intense
You calm my soul with perfect sense
Bring me back to earth, show me gems
Thank you for being my friend

(Chorus)
Forever and a day
You will be my everything
Forever and a day
You're my divine, the reason that I shine

[Verse 2]
You always believed in my dreams
Even when we were kids and our job was just to live
Anytime of day wiped my tears away
You protected me laughed my fears away
There's no one (no one) in this world
Who could ever take your place?

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
We've been through joy and pain
Taken different paths still the loves the same
Your light shines all over me
Help me keep prospective, I know it ain't easy
You should know (you should know) I'd die for you
Call my name and I'll find you

(Chorus)</pre>
