[Intro]
When I was a lad
We had indentured bond servants
Stout conishman and Scotsman
{Indeed sir endeed
And if one of them runs away you couldn't tell 'em from any other Englishman
But take our black slave sir
and no matter how far they run they always black}

[Chorus]
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you

[Verse 1]
Quiet as it's kept
Some of y'all slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror black
Turn you back on yourself
I wouldn't trust some a y'all
If you was my right hand, man
I'd cut it off at the wrist
Like you name was Benedict
Enough lead
To threaten 50 niggas dead, you said
Cause niggas is back to perms &amp; relaxers
All up in their head
TV niggas only make you laugh, embarrass
Can you catch it
Nigga fever new season
Of modern day Stephen Fetchits 1990's
Niggas be fraid of the noise I made
Bout their master crackers giving out
Disasters in the hood
Phony honeys be gone when they moneys be gone
Niggaresses artificial chests'
Posin fake hair &amp; high dresses

[Chorus] x2

Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you

[Verse 2]
Madd niggas hittin shit
But they health be quittin it
Clothes and car makin the men
Havin counterfeitin fit
Seizing niggas be praisin
Benzes Beemers when they got em
Shined and simonized foreclosed
Bit they grills be rotten
Simon sez niggas jump
And they jump for these Hilfiggers
Tommy hates niggas high priced styles
White as wild rice
Niggas be dwellin in hell and the
Negros pray for heaven
Fuck the preacher he don't reach
You my nigga roll a seven
Niggas forgettin trips about those
Slavery ships
Niggas wasn't there they claim
Fuck that nigga bring the pain
Niggas be dealin Narcotic
But don't get the money nigga
Women or the fame my nigga
Or the mother fuckin game

[Chorus] x2

Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you

[Outro]
Check it
Brother Isac drop it on the groove one time
Let the beats check-check out your mind
Brother Isac Hayes

[Isaac Hayes]
Yo-yo brothers I say to you
Become literate, study your history
Then you know where you need to go
Don't get socialy anestezied, thinkin you got the rock
When you got the pable
Learn who you are
Come together and survive
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to stand out and be near
Think about your history
And free it from your misery
Learn...to love again

(Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2)
It's time to learn to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true)
It's time to learn to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2)
It's time to learn to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics is true)
Learn ! To love again
