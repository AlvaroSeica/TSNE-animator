[Verse 1]
Now you been backin it up for a minute baby
And it ain't nothin wrong with that when you reverse and put a cap
And it's damn sure fact girl, I know it's what it went
Turn around let me see that front, now that's a rabbit in a hat
I'm gone, aw damn, girl you jumped out
Let me put the long part of the eye to the tiger
Got to be hot, because you workin what you got
Look at me parlaying all up in the same spot
You got MGD gone way in another zone
Now baby strip to it and leave your shoes and socks on
Girl you make my mind flip when you twitch your hips
Now work pop shake bounce ooh bring it high den there
And I can see you got it on
You poppin with no stoppin
And I'm back in the zone when you havin that rabbit hoppin
If you come on in I'ma stay straight even sober
Down to my hands and knees scratch that now flip it over

[Hook]
I know you like to back it up and flip it over baby
I wanna feel your toes rubbin on my temple girl
And if you don't wanna leave, surely I'll call
To put the back of yo knees on my forearm
Now get to it baby, now get to it baby
Now get to it baby, now get to it baby
Now get to it baby, now get to it baby
Now get to it baby, now get to it

[Verse 2]
Seeing shorty right there workin her thang fo sheeit
She say she move she won't give me the same thug shit
She say she down to come in my grill
Smoke somethin, drink somethin but she ain't don't cuttin no shit
I know ya down to cut that's why you showin me your thong
And I'm already frozen from lookin at ya shake your thong
The way you doin that there girl you goin off the grid
Oh you just gone cut me and now my boy got shit
You wasn't one of those thangs everybody gettin the brains
Girl work, base and do it with no shame
You got hogtied breakin down screamin your name
And you out the yard, unleashed and off the chain
Now after two rolls, you make a man release the pressure
They can't hang when you throw it gurl
They call in the stretcher
But let MGD get up on it, now you know I'm gone rip it
Don't bother put it in reverse, nah baby you got to flip it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now let me put that thang in motion, you captain?? the row boat
And the way you lick your lips, I know it the slow curl
You say these broads can't compete, now you makin them sick
Cause you fine, one of a kind, don't stop that shit
You got a playa with the tightest pockets losin his change
Got that x-rated blood flowin all in your veins
Now it's a damn shame you make it hard to maintain
I got to hear the click click before I can bang bang
You say it's on all night if I roll up the green
I am the B-O-K B-O-K  burnt one king
Now go on spark this one right here and set it on out
And pass it to your boys why because she say she down no doubt
She say she like the way I'm slow with it, the way I flow with it
And if I do it over nothin she gone go get it
Bring it back to me and rest your heels on my shoulders
It's already in the spot no need to flip it over
