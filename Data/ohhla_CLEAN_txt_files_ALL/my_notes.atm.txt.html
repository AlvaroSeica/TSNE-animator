As long as I can hit my notes
I saw the sunrise, then the green grew
Even through the concrete cracks that we cling to
As long as I can hit my notes
I'ma try to keep up with my folks
I smelled rain that brought the flash flood
with a river of permanent teardrops and rap hugs
Bad luck play with effortless
So I backed away from the quick benefits
Shed skin of those that spit venomous
Yeah that's him, he the one that tips generous
Still trying to define my description of life
with a little spare time for living
But even if I want to hold the position
I gotta go like daddy don't know any different
I saw the noon sky, look at the snow melt
I left most of my baggage up in a hotel
As long as I can hit my notes
I'ma travel down that gravel road
I heard a bird cry, it was pathetic
Man if you can fly, spread feathers like a message
As long as I can hit my notes
I'ma stand top of this box of soap
I felt the track slip but didn't pull breaks
I'm half-dead but already got a full plate
As long as I can hit my notes</pre>
