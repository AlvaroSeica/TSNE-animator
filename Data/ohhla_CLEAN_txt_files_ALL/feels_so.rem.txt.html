We up in this room (Yea)
And I'm puttin it down on you (mmm)
Now your pushin back at me
And I don't want to let you leave
But baby girl you feel so good
Little mama that thing is so good
Girl the way that you movin so good
I wanna do it again do it again (so good)

[Remy]
Stop actin crazy I'ma keep it real
See I just need some one that gives me something I could feel
Have a little small talk and a night on the town
It could all be yours if you go another round
Dont wanna loose you in it cuz the groove is in it
But it really don't matter long as you be in it
Boo wats gotten in to you
I told you I got a interview but you wanna get intimate
Why you tryna get in to it

[Ne-Yo]
Baby I know you got moves to make
But you ain't leavin till I get another taste
I ain't ashamed to say you got a nigga open babe
And I'ma need some more before you get away
(ooooh)
We up in this room (Yea)
And I'm puttin it down on you (mmm)
Now your pushin back at me
And I don't want to let you leave
But baby girl you feel so good
Little mama that thing is so good
Girl the way you movin so good
I wanna do it again do it again (so good)

[Remy]
Yea you pushen futher and I'm seeing that you lovin it
I'm pushin back and got you callin out my goverment, like remenisce
Im really feelin this
And I don't like to kiss
But I really like ya lips
See I'm tryna hold it but I can't control it
My mind is tellin me stop but my body it keeps goin
You want me to stay and I wish I could
Another day but tell me why I should

[Ne-Yo]
Baby I know you got moves to make
But you ain't leavin till I get another taste

And I'm puttin it down on you (mmm)
Now your pushin back at me
And I don't want to let you leave
Cuz baby girl you feel so good
Little mama that thing is so good
Girl the way that you movin so good
I wanna do it again do it again (so good)

[Remy]
So good you can't even keep your hands off
So good you feel you need to go and put ya mans on
You got ya blackberry off and your phone vibrating
And all you wanna know is why my legs keep shakin
See we both grown and I know when the feel is right
And wat you sayin is makin me wanna spend the night
And now I'm focused and I'm open cuz ya noticed me
And I was hoping you'd say can I take you home with me

[Ne-Yo]
Baby I know you got moves to make
But you ain't leavin till I get another taste

And I'ma need some more before you get away
