[Chorus: PK Oneday] (Bri)
I'm different (I'm out of this world)
I'm the king in that kid (the queen in that girl)
And you different (you can stand out)
If you wanna lead the orchestra - eyy!
Turn your back on the crowd - (cause you different)
Turn your back on the crowd - (cause you different)
Turn your back on the crowd - (cause you different)
(I'm different, be different)

[No Malice]
Now is the time, let this be the hour of
you bein a difference, you ain't gotta be no follower
25 to life, that's right, go 'head, count 'em up
Tony got 400 months, you do the algebra
Cause I've YET to get it figured
The grass won't green and everything that glittered
won't gold, funny how things unfold
The way I once start is so troubling my soul
Straight to the hole, I'll take it, the lane's open
I'm done, movin the keys, I'm Beethoven
So sold out for the Lord, I'm Al Jolson
Some friends were like baby shoes, I've outgrown 'em
Truth be told, I'm guilty as the next man
So my rhymes channel, Brother J from X-Clan
Maaan, how could I ever leave be?
I cain't leave rap alone, the game needs me

[Chorus]

[No Malice]
Yeah, I march to the beat of a different drum
You can probably tell my speech bear a different tongue
Well I just hope it reach, even if it's one
Louie this, Gucci that - shut up, you sound dumb!
I know where I'm from, I'm Chief Sinner
I know better, just got a different agenda
I remember winter, in the cold we were sellin it
Swore we would never snitch, now everybody tellin it
Guess loyalty before the judge is irrelevant
I'm waitin for the light bulb to cut on like Edison
It's evident we ALL gon' make mistakes
When the feds got daytime in place
I'm pleading my case so you ain't gotta proceed to the bench
Run, Toby, run! Another brother lynched
Another brother pinched, doin bits, pullin time
My message aimed at the kids without a 9 - be different!

[Chorus]

[Outro: No Malice] (Bri)
Baby girl, I'm here to tell you
You ain't gotta pop it, you ain't gotta drop it
Shake it, twerk it, bounce it
And you are STILL just as beautiful
You KNOW~! Be different...
Turn your back on the crowd!
Turn your back on the crowd!
Turn your back on the crowd!
Turn your back on the crowd!
(If you wanna lead the orchestra, just turn your back on the crowd)</pre>
