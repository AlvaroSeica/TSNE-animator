Song:   You Could Be
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: sample]
Baby you are on
But you could be with me
Forever, it's on, come on, it's on, come on, come on

[Fes Taylor]
I said, yo, baby, with you in my life
What else you probably do in my life
I was wishing you was my wife, I took advice from my old dad
Told me find a good one, son, better hold that
Plus we go back since, Port Richmond Ave.
When I sold crack, so girl, you know that
I'mma hold you down like support beams do
Stay fly in the dress, ma, neat pair of shoes
Rendesvous, probably take a cruise
The SL and G-5, you see the view
I'm fly like Peter Pan do, two seater to
But I still got room for you

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Fes Taylor]
I said, you was my sunshine when the rain gone
Like taking pictures with my chain on, hang long
I heard homey locked up like Akon
But ma, I'm a prince like Teyshaun, the Trae songs
Say I'm a king now, King Kong in the city
Bling now, plus I go strong in the kitty
So let them haters hate, ah, what a pity
But your life drip, kinda like jars of the sticky
Got me walking on cloud 9, your smile to your pretty feet
Down to how you ride for a nigga, in these city streets
Looking like you cherokee, crib out in Beverly
Now we do the Baldwin Hills, long with the evergreens

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Fes Taylor]
Ma, you see I've been a player, no pair of gators
And I was doing when it dirty like incinerators
Thinking it's in my nature, I understand
I ain't trynna let you down like a Patriots fan
Still my pride like a patriot, damn, so I never did
106 &amp; Park or Making the Band
I'm just saying, I'm a real nigga, a real nigga
Need a real bitch on his side like the logo on Hilfiger
I'm still with ya like a still picture
And can't explain how I feel witcha, how I feel witcha
I'm like ma, you was right from the start
When you said you would earn a place right in my heart, yea

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]</pre>
