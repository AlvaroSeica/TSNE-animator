Typed by: AZ Lyrics

These are the days of our lives
Like coke they call us the straight drop but we ride
We jus tryin to get by
They wanna see us broke but they won't
We on the grind they wanna see us fall but we ball
Outta control livin above law so fuck em all
I say they wanna see us fall but we ball
Outta control livin above the law so fuck em all

[Verse 1]
I was taught never stop til the money come
Now look the boy like sweeter then a honey bun
Look I mean sweet like sweeties
I amputate you nikkas I'm diabetes
And I get the girls wet like bikinis
Squirt like a oozzy like a hot on jaguzzi water
Waiter bring me another drink for me and my nikkas
We made it threw another week and that's big
We jus tryin to get by
Tryin to make it to the top but the mountain so high
Good thing I know how to rock climb swingning over you niggas like monkeys
I find vines my rhymes crush grapes fine wine
Yes boy I'm out my mind this be the billionare die tryin
And I stay higher then a high five can I get a high five?
U see the diamond I flont em I flont em
Got the boy up there like he got christmas ornament on em (ya dig)
And all my cars I ain't pawn it and won it
Da whips ferrari they wanna deport it (aha)
Shit I'm a die hard rock star
If you lookin for birds I know where the flocks are
Money long so I kno where the cops are
And I stay in a chicks buns I'm a hot dog

[Chorus]
These are the days of our lives
Like coke they call us the straight drop but we ride
We jus tryin to get by
They wanna see us broke but they won't
We on the grind they wanna see us fall but we ball
Outta control livin above law so fuck em all
I say they wanna see us fall but we ball
Outta control livin above the law so fuck em all

[Verse 2]
I mean that to the fullest
Nobody wearin diapers but the want us doin pullups
Winners doin pushups in a yard full of niggas
We jus out tryin to feed a squad full of niggas
Shout out to my squad full of niggas
This for the hood I'm nothin without ya'll niggas
Like the tide we rise high
They wanna see us broke like they levies
But they won't we level 5
And like pedal bikes I pedal bye
Right by ya niggas can't front in my tire
Thts why I stay high so high skys the limit
But you can touch the moon if you try
The other moon is mine
Basically what I'm sayin is you can be the son of my moonblocks jus shine
U can be the 1 but the 2 spot is mine
Do what you do I don't mind waitin in line
Knowin I'm not far behind
It's cool patience is a vertue
I do it big for my niggas tht cnt
Niggas that got caught in the rain and left dead (damn)
For my niggas treatin jail like camp
Dis song is a piece of mail santana sent
So hola at me if you got my letter I'm signin off
Hope you got my letter dipset skull game (aight)

[Chorus]
These are the days of our lives
Like coke they call us the straight drop but we ride
We jus tryin to get by
They wanna see us broke but they won't
We on the grind they wanna see us fall but we ball
Outta control livin above law so fuck em all
I say they wanna see us fall but we ball
Outta control livin above the law so fuck em all</pre>
