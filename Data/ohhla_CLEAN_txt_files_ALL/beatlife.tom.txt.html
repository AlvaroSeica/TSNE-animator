[Intro/Chorus: Sandra]
Here comes switch to my soul
I'm feeling, it's the beat of the life
here comes switch to my soul
I'm feeling, it's the beat of..

[Ice-T]
No Drag call this Pop or Alternative Rock
It's the beat from the streets and it's called Hip-Hop
It'll be dimensional move shakes, yo, fight in the club
it'll be dimensions: smoke and get drunk, the shit that you love
guns in the club, the dresscode for niggaz that know
Hip-Hop that's only black in music, it's 'bout gettin' the dough
come with the flows, and every night fuckin' new hoes

[Break]

[Duet Ice-T and Trigger the Gambler]
[Trigger] It's slaughter, fuck whoever thought we couldn't bring it
[Ice-T]   We bring the ruckus everytime to all your punk motherfuckers
[Trigger] Bring it on, word is bond and it only takes one to slip up
[Ice-T]   Never front nothin, but than niggaz gettin' ripped up
[Trigger] Known for stick up, it's S.M.G. comin'

[Chorus: Sandra]

I'm feeling, it's the beat of the life

I'm feeling, it's the beat of..

[Hook: Sandra]
Everybody put your hands up  "come on, come on"
for the beat of life         "yeah, it's on, come on"
I'm comin' from the hardrock "awww"
I wanna see you die          "whay for? yeah, yeah, come on"
Love, just Hip-Hop           "come on, come on"

just, lovely ass Hip-Hop     "come on, come on"
you stay alive

[Ice-T]
I give a fuck about you rappers, I'ma stonecold shooter
gangbanger, straight pimp, hoe recruiter
When lookin' at me, it's obvious, my hobby is to come up
movin' away illegally, takin' blocks strategically

[Trigger the Gambler]
I'ma shoot out beef wetter, racer cuttin' shreader
drama treater, setter, more rappin' deader
timble stomper, bomber, smoking live, drama
Gambler's strapped down to the trigger heavy armour
down and dirty, say your prayers
it's the trigga nigga, they come...

[Duet Ice-T and Trigger the Gambler]
[Ice-T]   glocks on cop
[Trigger] and on my block to sell rocks we're big as nation
[Ice-T]   so move aside
[Trigger] to load dumbbuck you dumbfuck
[Ice-T]   Can't get with this fly shit
[Trigger] Then get it, get your brains stuck, who reigns supreme?
[Ice-T]   Trigga
[Trigger] That's my name
[Ice-T]   And Who's the slickest?
[Trigger] Ice Berg, ain't a damn thing changed
[Ice-T]   And Who are We?
[Trigger] S.M.G. how we runnin' the streets
[Ice-T]   And DJ Tomekk
[Trigger] You heard about him bangin' that heat
[Ice-T]   S.M.G. Baby
[Trigger] Sex money and guns
[Ice-T]   S.M.G. Baby
[Trigger] Sex money and guns
[Ice-T]   S.M.G. Baby
[Trigger] Sex money and guns
niggaz talk shit with no guns they act for it
[Ice-T]   we ever get broke with no funds, we blast for it
[Trigger] Bitches out of pocket, goin' straight, get smacked for it
[Ice-T]   Ride up in the club while my niggaz give me gat for it
[Trigger] Mack with the Mack, Black gat when we clap for it
[Ice-T]   Beef when we creep your all crew, can't take a nap for it
[Trigger] Call me iced out, run out and tact for it
[Ice-T]   Lex chromed out, and stop like it jack for it

[Chorus: Sandra]
Here comes switch to my soul
I'm feeling, it's the beat of the life
here comes switch to my soul
I'm feeling, it's the beat of..

[Outro: Sandra]
Everybody put your hands up  "come on, come on"
for the beat of life         "yeah, it's on, come on"
I'm comin' from the hardrock "awww"
I wanna see you die          "whay for?"
Love, just Hip-Hop           "come on, come on"
you stay alive for           "yeah, yeah, come on"
just, lovely ass Hip-Hop     "come on, come on"

Everybody put your hands up  "come on, come on"
