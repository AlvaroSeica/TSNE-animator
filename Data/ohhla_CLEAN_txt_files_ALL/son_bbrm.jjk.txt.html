[Chant: Janet]
Ha ha, hoo hoo, thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers try to have your cake and eat it too

[Intro: P. Diddy]
This... is...
The... remix
(Now, that's that shit right here)
Bad Boy, baby
Janet, J.J.
(This goes out to all the clubs, ya feel me?)
The one and only
And you fine, Miss

[Verse 1: Janet]
Sharp shooter into breakin hearts
A baby gigolo, a sex pistol
Hollerin' at everythin that walks
No substance just small talk
Know why you feelin on that girl's behind
You gotta sleezy - one track mind
Working your work until you think you find
Who's goin home with you tonight

[Missy {P. Diddy}]
(I) changed all the credit cards
(and) switched the lock to all my doors (hehehe)
You thought my heart would be destroyed (mmmm)
Look around cuz I'm chillling boy (hehehe)
Whatcha go and get your lawyers for
I, makes my dough in just one show, you know
Your lawyer shoulda let you know, you know
When you sue me, ya gonna be broke you know
Ain't know you way you could bring me down (easy)
Any chick that you stick is real sleazy
Before I need you, I betcha gon' need me
You ain't want me anyway way, you wanted to be me
What made you think I'd keep you around
While I, work my ass off and you just lounge (huh?)
You slump, bump, son of a gun
And a, how much your worth?
I think negative Don {This is the remix}

[Hook: Janet (Missy)]
Oh (oh), who you give it to
Who you gonna steal it from
Who's your next victim (the right, like)
Oh (oh), who you gonna lie to
Who you gonna cheat on
Who you gonna leave alone (that's what I'm talking about)
Oh (oh), what ya gonna tell her
After she discovers
You don't really love her
Oh (oh), gonna be a showdown
Knock down drag out
Gunslinger shoot 'em up (shoot em' up)

[Chorus: Janet &amp; Carly {P. Diddy}]
I betcha think this song is about you {Who you talkin' 'bout?}
I betcha think this song is about you {Who you talkin' 'bout?}
I betcha think this song is about you (yeah, yeah) {Who you talkin' 'bout?}
I betcha think this song is about you
Don't you {Who you talkin' 'bout?}
Don't you
Don't you
Don't you

[P. Diddy (overlaps last 2 lines)]
They call me "Diddy"
(It wasn't me!) Whatchu talkin' 'bout lawyers for?
(It wasn't me!) Why you wanna change locks and doors?
(It wasn't me!) Well, maybe it was, sure
But you know tomorrow, you'll love me some more
I'm back, another Visa, another set of keys
We did this last week Ma, don't get ammnesia (Remember?)
All this back and forth gotta quit
And by the way, THIS IS THE REMIX!

[Verse 2: Janet (Missy)]
Sweatin me but I'm not your type
You think you irk me and you're so right
I'd rather keep the trash and throw you out
Stupid bitch in my beach house
Naw I ain't gone go and act a fool
And be lead story on the nigga news
Not me sucher
I'll never be your lover
I'm gonna make you suffer
You stupid mutherfucker (ok baby?)

[Missy]
You musta thought you had game like nigga what
Walk around like you down, you don't give a fuck
Cause you don't really want beef until you hit the streets
See, I ma lover, not a fighter but I'll crack ya teeth
Boy, plea plea nah...don't bother me
Cause when you had me, you ain't know how ta chill wit' me
But now you up on dem knees, still jockin me
But I ma say it real real, keep it real
What da deal, how ya feel, is it ill, is it sick (Misdemeanor!!!!!!!!!!)
Cause I da deal, still here with appeal and it's real
Don't front cause boy I da shit

[Missy singing]
I'm doing better with out you, playa
And I'm happy without you, playa

[Missy rapping]
And this song is about you, playa
Muthafuckin' son of a gun (Janet)

[Bridge: Janet (Missy)]
Gotta chip upon your shoulder
I just knocked it off (oh)
Show me what you gonna do (uh)
I ain't bout to run (uh)
You have just run out of ammunition (nigga right here)
Shootin blanks now (uh)
You son of a gun
