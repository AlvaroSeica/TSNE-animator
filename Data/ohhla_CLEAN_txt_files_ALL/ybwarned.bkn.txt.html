[Rugged Monk]
Yo, you've been warned
The Rugged Monk, the sharpest thorn
In rap combat, I stalk the rugged outback
I strike back, never turning a cheek
My rhymes chunky like a 6 Mill beat
Physique unique with a swift technique
I spit the gift of gab, you'd swear I've reached my peak
My name ring bells through every state, city, town and street
Block to block, pop, R&amp;B and hip-hop
I won't stop and can't stop cuz I love this shit
Blacc on Blacc, motherfuckers!</pre>
