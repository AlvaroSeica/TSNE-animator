[Chorus: Eric Turner]
I waited all my life to play
But I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain!
Ayyyyyyyeahhhhh
I might just break the chain!

[Lupe Fiasco]
{*repeated "Freedom" gradually fades in*} Freedom
We can use some of that especially where we from
Where we grew up like a green thumb
It's like a criminal the only thing you can become
Look at what I became
Somethin like a phenom, nothin but a G thang
Things I've seen when I'm lookin out of these frames
Pictures I've painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit, man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell us somethin?
We ain't have a father, how to try to grow up and be one
... See umm
Feel it in my bones and I'm sittin on the throne
Like a killer with the chrome when I'm spittin out the poem
Shed a whole lot of light on the little bit of home - blaow!

[Chorus]

[Sway]
Super Sway, the cape remains
Thought I was M.I.A., no +Paper Planes+
I'm fly, plus I don't write no more
It's all off of the top, I shave the braids
and stayed sharp, mother knew how to raise a blade (uh-huh)
I paid my dues, now I wait for change
And cause the flow's so rude, it goes without AHH
Ask Lupe, I'm {?}, your ankle break
Quick to cut off any baggage like
some samurai, I like to travel light
Gonna leave you at home, Delilah
This is Samsonite
No case for the pol-ace
Said I know +Killah+'s, I never seen 'em, +Ghostface+
Only time I'm watchin is my Panerai, I got an alibi
I was takin pictures of Chicago, call me Camera Chi

[Chorus]

[Lupe Fiasco]
Chain broke
Need a Nicorette for your chain smoke
No cigarettes on my plane yo
Snatch your herringbone from the game throat
Put it on mine, took a long time
B.A. Baracus how I'm lookin online
In a webisode, necklace glow, let 'em know
that I put up the footage that I've tooken your shine
Wanna see the real chains, look in your mind
Your brain look like any Wayans brother
Overgrow, overload, broken zone
Niggaz playin games in the hood, they got you sucka
Playa think it's cool bein pimps still
We gon' set it free like fish in a pin pill{?}
Take this home and rearrange it, change it
Danger, Sway-zer, Lupe, "Laser" - pow!
