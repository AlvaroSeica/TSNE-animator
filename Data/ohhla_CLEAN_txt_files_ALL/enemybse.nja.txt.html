[Lone Ninja]
Yeah the terror's here, I'm metal gear solid
In devil's lair, I sever, sheer carnage	    			
you fellows fear the horrid, I'm harsh with power		
I never spare a hostage, in darkest hour						
Darts will shower you fortress, charge the prowler 
Is lawless, marsh is piled up with corpses			
Fallen soldiers, reek of death
swarming vultures, eat their flesh					
Bleek distress, train with sharpest sword
Beat the best, reign in art of war				
Race to start the brawl, you cowards is done
Brazen marching tall, the battle is won				
The barrel of gun, diffuse the loud threats
Yall gathered and hung, with noose around neck				
The brute is now vex, the worst you all die
Shoot you down next you heard the war cry				
Thoughts sly, castrophe is crucial
Caught spies, the savagery is brutal 				
To battle me is futile, I blast the weapon
The master teaches pupil, the class in session				


[UG]							
Gigantic, shoe size of the titanic
Dine on a woolly mammoth, lift planets
Juggle, ocean's a mere puddle
Step in it, cause tsunami, Galactus
Knock earth off axis, breath wormholes
Provide UFOs, ready to go
In and out of time zones, UG's a monster
More countries to conquer, NASA launch the
Probe, blow cold to freeze a satellite
Sit on Saturn, ill rhyme patterns
Smash in skyscrapers, Godzilla
They tried to launch pods with arms trying to kill UG
Was spawn from giants, tyrant
Bend iron, kick trucks and send cars flying
Many people die when I'm in destruct mode
Killing militaries by the truckload

[Lone Ninja]
The green beret, mean with blades 
Siege and raid grieve on your knees and pray		
Creep then slay, stalking with heavy axe
Seeking prey, You caught in the deadly trap	
Melee, hell, with AA-12
No luck when foes struck, may they yell				
Sniper fell from tower, bursted slug
I could smell gunpowder, thirst for blood		
Hurt with grudge, your hope is squandered
The ghost of Sparta is gross and harsher		
Who dares cross lone, hack and slash
Full scale war zone's aftermath			</pre>
