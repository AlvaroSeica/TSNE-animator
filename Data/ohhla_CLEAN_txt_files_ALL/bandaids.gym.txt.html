[Verse One]
Thank you, you know exactly who you are
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Through all the papercuts and all the broken hearts
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Thank you, you know exactly who you are
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Through all the nightmares and anxiety scares
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart

Hi, it's so quiet
Where did the music go?
I was boppin my head and tappin my feet
and having a grand old time, more please!
I want more, give me more music
Give me it, now! I want it
Hey! Do you remember, that time when we were listening
to some fine music, by the Gym Class Heroes
and it was two minutes ago?
Do you remember that? That was cool
Hey! Do you remember, that time when we went fishing
with Fat Tommy and we wore clown shoes
and we caught some lake trout
but they had big teeth and antlers and Fat Tommy said
"Those are not lake trout
Those are space cowboys from West Lancanshire"
And I said, "I don't believe you"
And Fat Tommy said, "I don't believe me!"
Well, so be it, says I, do you remember that?
And now it never happened
HEY! Anyways I'm outta here
Peace</pre>
