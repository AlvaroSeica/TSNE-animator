She had exes on her eyes, she was only good for one thing
It was over before it started, sooner than some think
She had a nose for trouble and all things illegal
She came with heavy baggage and a stupid ass beagle
Man, I hated that dog, it would shit in the kitchen
And howl in the morning, always scratching and itching
Queen of the plastic bag, forked tongue and 80's retro
Everything from new wave, metal and electro
Creature of the night, of habit and of the tanning booth
Dedicated, crippled and heavily medicated
New pair of shoes to wear out and walk a mile
She got what she wanted and cried like a crocodile
She liked to mix it up but she couldn't cook to save her soul
Every year when Santa Clause came he only gave her coal
Blatantly obvious, I read her like a book of matches
Maybe she's crazy, but I'm the one who took the chances

And what does that say about me
In the wrong, the place with a long face
What does that say about me, I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow
But what does that say about me
Couple bandages and knuckle sandwiches
What does that say about me, I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow

The thorn in my side was also my addiction
She spelled it out backwards and blinded me with science fiction
Porcelain doll, she let herself go to pieces
Kept it in bottles for too long with no releases
The outcome was volcanic, disgusting and wonderful
Messy, confusing, exciting and depressing
The whole entire time I had my foot on the accelerator
I saw it all happen like watching numbers on the elevator

But what does that say about me
In the wrong, the place with a long face
What does that say about me, I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow
But what does that say about me
Couple bandages and knuckle sandwiches
What does that say about me, I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow</pre>
