[Chorus]
They used to say I shouldn't, I'm tellin' them I should
They told themselves I couldn't, I proved to them I could
They'll never understand, so let's make it understood
( This-Is-In-My-Blood )

[Verse 1]
Took some time off, went back to the place of my birth
For a minute disappeared from the face of the earth
Had to get back in touch, thought my rapping sucked
Compared to the first days, when my passion struck
Since Open Canvas, I was stroking canvasses
But everything looked, sort of hopeless and damaged
Couldn't understand it, I'm my toughest critic
I expect nothing but the best, there was nothing in it
No message, Preoccupied with flow
Whatever happened to that storytelling style that you know
or you Don 't,  "Whatever, now I don't give a What!"
Almost said the F-word, but I don't need to cuss
And I don't need the women, or the fans who don't listen
I was never about being the man when I was beginning
Made me feel better, just by writing things down
I thought I could help others if I spread around
And what a better way to spread it than through sound
"It works", I watched as it started to compound
And compound across cities to towns
Until it almost compounded me into the ground man
I tried but I think I let it get to my head
"Just a lil' bit", no where close to 50 Cent
Remember it only takes one stupid move
To erase everything else good that you do

[Chorus 2X]
They used to say I shouldn't, I'm tellin' them I should
They told themselves I couldn't, I proved to them I could
They'll never understand, so let's make it understood
( This-Is-In-My-Blood ), I never had a choice

[Verse 2]
Some of my family fell in hard times
No choice for me but to re-prioritize
Had to save up, gave away like almost ten g's
And that's a lot when you make four bills a week
Financially responsible for more than myself
Praying for a day I could reward myself
And put some energy back towards myself
Stressed out, I just kept on ignoring my health
And time for music had been reduced to zero
Lots of people realized that I ain't a superhero
Never gave up, although almost everyday sucked
I kept hope alive that I would find a way up
Could have made a million off "The Facts of War"
With major label support, promoting it to the world
Realized you need to get your business in order
Companies in Canada won't even invest a quarter
And there's a lot more to success than "Just Skills"
Costs more than you think, lets look at the bills
Equipment, studio time, mixing and mastering
Photography, website, promotion, packaging
How could I be rappin', when this other stuff was happening
I couldn't fall asleep, even after three aspirins
Like all the sudden, everybody doubts you
Fans stop believing in you and forget about you
But I'm not done, ain't time for me to pack it in
The fact that I've been through so much, is no accident
Just stay with me, that's all I ask of friends
I won't disappoint you no more, cuz' now I'm back again

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
