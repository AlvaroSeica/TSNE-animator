Thats the one, Oy
How did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe?
Way too close for me, oh well at least they allowed me throug
Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room
People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone
And I'm thinking..

(woman's voice) Lights are blinding my eyes

They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner
And I'm thinking..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

These look well speckly, bit of green and blue
Freeze is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to
Right I'm on the plan, I wish the bouncers would go away
Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK
And I'm thinking..

Lights are blinding my eyes

That's proper rank, that tastes like hairspray
And I'm thinking..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone
You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned?
Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone?
Send message, dans number, where've they gone?
And I'm thinking..

Lights are blinding my eyes

Why's the message pending? where the fuck are ya?
And I'm thinking..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Hmm, brandy or beer? Water's a good idea
Wish that bar lady'd appear and come serve over here
Where the fuck could they be? still not over in the corner
This nights a tragedy, I keep thinking I saw her
And I'm thinking..

Lights are blinding my eyes

No thats not them, thats not them either..
And I'm thinking..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud
It's been ages since I necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub
Belly's not even tingling, I just feel a bit pissed
No-one looks like mingling, I can't see her or him
And I'm thinking..

Lights are blinding my eyes

I'm gonna do another I think, Yeah, one more, these are shit
And I'm thinking..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door
Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin so much for?
Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here til dawn
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure
And I'm thinking..

Lights are blinding my eyes

Maybe I should'nt have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down
My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt
Who cares, there is a tune coming in, that one noise is like
I'm thinking..

Lights are blinding my eyes

My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
And I'm thinking..

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Yeah yeah they cheer
can they see my hand in the air?
Need to wave 'em over here
Swear Simone's kissing Dan
My head is twisted sever, body's rushing everywhere
They could have texted me when they were near, but I'm fucked and I don't
care

Lights are blinding my eyes

What was I thinking about? Ah who cares, I'm mashed

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Totally fucked, can't hardly fucking stand
This is fucking amazing</pre>
