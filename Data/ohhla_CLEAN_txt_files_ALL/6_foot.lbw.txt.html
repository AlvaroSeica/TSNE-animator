Typed by: AZ Lyrics

'Bout to go off
Time for me to show off
Movin' on from my ex, sorry bitch your loss
Cash money nigga, you straight ass nigga
So much cake, the bank can't stash nigga
And plus I go too hard, I'm mackin' on two broads
niggas ain't hard, bunch of undercover RuPaul's
B to the O, y'all muthafuckers already know my lyrics flow
Bitch I gotta get that bread you heard what I said
My mind is on my dough
Shout out to the O
Yeah lemme buck town
My niggas don't play round
Y'all niggas get no shine till I say it's okay now
I'ma big dog, K-9
Droptop, daytime
Bad bitch, shotgun
Hair down to her waistline
Snoop always told me, lil cuz do ya thang
Take a system with the flow, you'll be a legend in the game
Now it's YMCM, packin' all the freaks in
Take the Lamborghini out once on weekend
Youtube killer, pockets full of Skrilla
Old school Chevy, inside vanilla
Send my girl to London, my girl got to stunt hard
Since I'm in the family, just throw it in the Rush card

Smokin' on kush, don't smoke no ?
Bitches better recognize how dope I'm is
I'm a pro in this shit, I'm like ? in this shit
Haters better realize how much dough I get
I'ma body this track, let it be known
Prince of the raps, so better get off my throne
Hate nobody if you lend no hand
I got right here all on my own
Rap game all fucked up
They signed up niggas who locked up
Prefer me a hood chick, Hollywood hoe's too stuck up
Better step yo game up, niggas step yo change up
'Bout to be 24, shit still ain't changed much
Wait, more movies, more paper, which means, comes more haters
See y'all in June, Team Heat, whattup Lakers
Girls hit me on my Twitter now they wanna follow him
Only take lil mama to the condo if she swallowin'
You know I be balin' in, my Bugatti comin' in
If you really wanna know, hip hop yep, I'm running it
Where my competition at, swear they know I'm running this
Living in my Miami, but I do this for Columbus and
Please, niggas ain't fucking with me
I got a big appetite and I just ate this beat nigga</pre>
