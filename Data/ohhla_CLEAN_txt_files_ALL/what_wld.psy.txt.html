Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[English Translation]
My past love, my past person
Sometimes, I ask how you're doing to myself
Then I smile by myself
I pour out the faded memories of back then in this empty glass
The glass fills and overflows
I drink my memories
Those memories are bitter but delicious
We were stronger than most strong liquors back then
Even after seeing you and seeing you, I missed you
Even after loving you and loving you, we were hungry for each other
I was thirsty
We were so good, there was no reason for us to break up

Why did we do that? We didn't know love back then
We didn't know that love was love
I draw you out by myself
If only we didn't break up

What would it have been like (back then if I)
What would it have been like (I held onto you)
What would it have been like (would we have been happier than right now)
What would it have been like (On the last day)
What would it have been like (If I hugged you)
What would it have been like (Would we have been together till now?)

The morning after we stayed up all night
I jolted awake and closed the window
As if we were the birds out the window, children who don't want to go to sleep, like elementary students
Even though no one was there, we whispered to each other without anyone knowing, so no one can hear us
Back then, our temperature was hotter than the equator down below
We got angry, we burned up even though it wasn't a cold
If I place my ears on any part of your body, I heard your pulse
I still hear your sound of that day

Why did we do that? We didn't know love back then
We didn't know that love was love
I draw you out by myself
If only we didn't break up

What would it have been like (back then if I)
What would it have been like (I held onto you)
What would it have been like (would we have been happier than right now)
What would it have been like (On the last day)
What would it have been like (If I hugged you)
What would it have been like (Would we have been together till now?)

You don't live before my eyes but
You live when I close them
In another person's arms
Thinking the same memories
You're not by my side but
My body remembers you
In another person's arms
Thinking the same memories

Why did we do that? We didn't know love back then
We didn't know that love was love
I draw you out by myself
If only we didn't break up

What would it have been like (back then if I)
What would it have been like (I held onto you)
What would it have been like (would we have been happier than right now)
What would it have been like (On the last day)
What would it have been like (If I hugged you)
What would it have been like (Would we have been together till now?)
