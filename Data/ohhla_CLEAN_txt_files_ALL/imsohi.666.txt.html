[Hook: Crunchy Black - repeat 4X]
I'm so hi', all I smell like is smoke
Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that got damn dope
 
[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I fuss wit' the light green
I fuss wit' the drizzle hoe
I puts five to the tail
I smokes till it is no mo'
I fuss wit' this hotel
I gots towels to the do'
I fuss wit' this freaky hoe
That's down fo' the dicky flo'
I'm blazin' this sticky, but never mixing it wit my coke
This one right here for the nose
This one right here for the smoke
This one right here for the dollars
This one right here roll the blunt
I'm taking six from the vic's
I'm wildin' like niggas stunt
This the beef
 
[Verse 2: Juicy J]
1st you get the swishers
2nd buy the liquor
3rd buy some of that sticky, most smokers call it sticker
Can't forget the Newport, suckin' on my too short
Call my nigga Big Tres, bring that blow and snizort
I'm high ass fucking lizzy
I'm stressin' how I'm livin'
Oh please, oh please, oh please
just give me just one mo' hizzit
This hydro weed I got some
I might blow you a shotgun
But if you can't play hizzalf
I guess yo ass don't want none
 
Hook repeats 4x
 
[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
Give me weed, give me green
give me somethin wit no seed
Give me somethin I can break down with
no sticks or undastand me
It don't makes no d if its cum bud or wood res
Just give it give it to me 
and my hand will gently tuck
In yo hand you will see is a big face from me
Tell my nigga pass me that swisher
so I can roll up this weed
Gently fillin up wit weed
Put that joint to that sweet
Then my nigga looked at me
and we start to repeat
 
[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]
Yo, I be smokin' out daily
maybe get up on some hazey
Then remote and faded baby
cause you niggas drive me crazy
Still a lady when I'm escalated
Faded with my peeps
Bobby Brown smokin' niggas know not to even step to me
When I'm high I ain't gon' lie
I'm feeling freaky up inside
You wanna keep it on the low
I put my truck on the other side
Nigga nigga what'chu mean Gangsta Boo be on that green
Looking good up on the scene
Posted up naw mean?
 
Hook repeat 4x
 
[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Gone on the pills 'at I pop
Yes I break out of the lot
Smoke too much hydro chron
I'm takin' it up a notch
W-H-I-T-E
It does stranger things to me
I'm paralyzed from the P
I'm shootin' up cause of thee
Bacardi for cocoa plex
I sniffed up an avalanche
I'm going in to a trance
Da deadliest demon man
Scarecrow Kyser Soze
Yo pass me that saucer tray
Or pass me a blunt of hay
I wanna just drift away, drift away
 
[Verse 6: Koopsta]
I be smokin' on motherfuckin weed and chiefin' 
Yeah I hear these sad satanic prayers, suffered it
Fo I think this ganja got me crazy
This haze has got me duped
Gotta blaze a blunt into me
Fo just step into the chiefin' room
Fuck the city with the chicken
Chief the chicken, roll the chicken
Smoking got the chicken out there dirty
with a lot of sticky
Hear me thizzin and I think I blowed a pound
Now I seen me a little silhouette of mind
 
[Crunchy Black]
Yeah that mothafucking green {*repeat 3X*}
  Yeah that got damn dope</pre>
