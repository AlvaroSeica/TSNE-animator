[Verse One]
I was top ten before I ever made a solo records
Huh, yeah yeah, now check the method
As I proceed to steal your rims and Pelle Pelle
The whip looks complete when it's sittin' on 20s
Funk monkey
My fam is full of alkies and junkies
There's 8 Million Stories in the city it's a pity
Never hear me on a track if the drums sound shitty
Shout out to the Minor League and my dawg Plead (The 5th)
He disappeared to get his lifestyle in order
Went back to school and sacrificed for his daughter
I ain't mad at you 
Life grabbed you, fuck rap
And if you wanna talk dawg you know where I'm at
Same phone number
For the last three years
Same address, playboy, I'm right here
And if you choose to walk away and stay Unseen
Never stop writing, never forget your dreams

[Verse Two]
What up Ill?
I hope your family is strong
Down in the Natti the same shit is goin' on
Loud mouths rattle
Scribble Jam battles
Cats wanna collabo
Tryin' to catch up with you
Those cats that we served last year tried to appear
Like they hurtin' somethin' 
Word to mother, heard them frontin'
And they be bitin' on deliveries
Wantin' me to give them beats
I front like I'm with it
But they ain't gettin' shit from me
I heart you did a show with the Last Poets
I'm so proud of you dawg
I want you to know it
There's very few here that inspire me to rip it (who?)
Plead The 5th, SP, CJ The Cynic
Loved by fans and hated by critics
They can't take nothing from us bro, we did it
Send everybody in Columbus my love
You was my nigga when push came to shove</pre>
