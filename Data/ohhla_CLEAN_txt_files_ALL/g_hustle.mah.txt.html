VERSE 1 - BIG SHYS
I got mo' remedy than legs on a centipede, they can get ya stem n'seed I can get ya betta weed
Cause 1 hit of my Northwest bombay, and you'll be drivin' down a one way goin' the wrong way
My competition be talkin' long squawk, but can't fade this I'm a walkin' pawn shop
Don't trip still mad that I burnt ya twice, well this time I'll let ya sample the merchandise
Cause I must get paper, under surveillance so I stay on foot and park the scraper
They can't catch what they can't see believe, I just made numerous G's with ease
Got degree's in all street buidness, remember my face cause I'm the one that did this
I aint a Gangsta, I'm a hustla pro at turnin' nuttin into somthin' motherfucker

HOOK: 2X
Maharaji: Watch ya P's &amp; ya Q's, &amp; ya B's &amp; Ya C's

Maharaji: Heata-hands on blast lay um' fast in a tustle
BIG SHYS: Strong floss, hog status, Guerilla Hustle

VERSE 2 - MAHARAJi
Seattle 206 Evergreen State, evergreen ballers with evergreen hate
Top notches platinum plus, big screenin' baby Westcoast dulo keep it on the hush
Ooo what is this a cut from the black seahawk ... me n' my niggas v.i.p. catwalk
Out ta snatch a supa-bad thats tight, I'm glowed from the bomb leanin' hard to my right
Who's the click that kicks it like we do, respect the vets wearin' Mariners dark blue
From Paul Allen Emerald Down stallion, niggas wanna fuck wit the E-Room battalion
Street savage managin' my cabbage, do it cause I said-so I gotta live lavvage
Terrible, unbearable, solid and un-scarable test me pigs call pigs to arrest me

HOOK: 2X

VERSE 3 - BIG SHYS
I'm pickin' the place you pick the format, pedigree not stepped on like a doormat
real chop I can get ya that pill-pop, maybe a hearing bone fa ya Lady that she'll rock
Ill-knock fa Sho' beats fa ya lo, clarion fa ya deck 2 fity plus respect
Say now I cut my prices way down, takin' western union, spare change, and pay-pal
I'm flippin shit that I don't even see, sell it to you before they sell it to me I gotta eat
Keep my big game quiet my main hustle private, ya flyin' on psilocybin I'm the pilot
Women bring the money ta me cause theoretically, I'm genetically mac strong from heredity
I'm on guidess hustlin' from fetus, game don't stop ya hate us but still need us homie

HOOK: 2X
