[PHONTE]
No need to remove your coat
No need to take off your shoes
Usually you could stay
But not today not today no
This place is no longer yours and 
I left your things theyre right by the door
Please don't be that way
Not today not today no
Our love is such a rush
But inside its slowly killing me 
Nothing more for me to say 
But not today not today no
So we must say our goodbyes 
To all of the pain and the lies
But nothings been more true
Then these words to you

I've been changed and rearranged and its not like it was before
And when the sun shines i'll show her why
She can't kick me anymore
Me anymore

[BREAK]
