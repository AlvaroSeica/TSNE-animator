Song:   Who Dat?
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) Artistotle
Cat's hollering how you do dat?
Asking who dat?
It's the Kartel nigga

[Artistotle]
Ayo, here go the pack, move dat, crew dat
You could double it up, and hit me back once it stack
I'm that cool cat, fuck a smooth rat
I'm dressed in all black, smooth when I move with the rat[chet]
Nigga true dat, cat's busting off shots, I blew back
Here come the cops, the burner hot
Y'all know I threw dat, never who dat
It's Aristotle, Kartel pack a two black
I thought y'all knew dat, these cowards is rats
That talk a lot of crap, corner niggas still deal direct
Sling a lot of crack, Brownsville niggas, sling a lot of gats
Bitch a hoe, crew clap, rock his shine, gotta remove dat
Tell your man to move back before I bust off a cap
'Cause we are, do these like whoa, and do these cats know?
We do these at shows, and when we do shows the club getting closed
Niggas know, my whole crew strapped

(Chorus) Artistotle
Cat's hollering how you do dat?
Asking who dat?
It's the Kartel nigga
Picture the gat
Shorty hollering who dat?
I wanna screw dat
It's Aristotle baby
We could do dat
Where your crew at?
Where the booze at?
Cat's hollering why you do dat?
I thought you knew dat
It's the Kartel nigga

[Artistotle]
Play with the cutie cat
Me and Goldie Mack let the hooker bounce on her lap
Damn shorty, you could move dat, move dat
Banger kinda phat, I like to bang it from the back
Let me soothe dat, skinny wet did it undressed
Fuck the talk only here for the sex
Shorty hollering you'se a rude cat
After I nut I'm taking a nap
Cats in the hood hate when I tell 'em
"Stop flashing their gat before you lose dat"
You ain't busting your gun, I can use dat
Trash talk in the hood, where dem fools at?
In my neck of the woods your vest gon' work
We blowing threw dat, screw dat
You can die with your jewels 'cause you're a fool black
Fall back, y'all blowing the coupe
Y'all cowards knew dat, where the rules at?
If you choose dat, we making you fool

(Chorus) Artistotle
Cat's hollering how you do dat?
Asking who dat?
It's the Kartel nigga
Picture the gat
Shorty hollering who dat?
I wanna screw dat
It's Aristotle baby
We could do dat
Where your crew at?
Where the booze at?
Cat's hollering why you do dat?
Asking who dat?
It's the Kartel nigga
Picture the gat
Shorty hollering who dat?
I wanna screw dat
Where your crew at?
Where the booze at?
We could do dat
