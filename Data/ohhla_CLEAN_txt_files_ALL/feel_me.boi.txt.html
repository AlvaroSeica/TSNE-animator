[Sleepy Brown] + (Bosko)
When the lush hangs off the chron'
I know that you're gone - ya feel me (feel me)
Fifteen years off in this game
Still nuttin changed - feel me (feel me)
Ridin swiftly through the night (through the night)
And livin this life - feel me (feel me)
Whether, I'm right or wrong (I'm right or wrong, I know I know I know I know)
I know that you're gone - feel me (I know ya feel me)
Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, ohh (whoa whoa whoa)
(Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, wow)
Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, ohh (whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, wow)
