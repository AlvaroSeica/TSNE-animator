[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
Get down, to the good part (good part)
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
When we gonna get to it?

[Verse One]
You was at the good part, you just didn't know it
Say what? You don't believe me and you want me to show it
When the good times came, well then the good parts went
Think about those good parts that you spent
Cause the more you make, then the more you spend
A then you find yourself, back in debt again!
Cause a fool and his money is soon departed
You lost yo' good thing before you got started
So you wanna know when you gonna get to the good part
Well it depends on where you start
If you start from here, then you get there quick
And if you start from here, you right next to it
To make sure there's no hold ups, in between
when you say good part, what part do you mean?
Oh that's what you mean~! I bet you do
Well baby I saved it all for you

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Are we gonna get down to the part I like?
You know the part that happened in the movie last night
You know the part that happens in everybody's life
You know the part I'm talkin 'bout, you know the part I like
Are we gonna get down to the part I like?
You know the part that happened in the movie last night
When the guy and the girl went out for a date
then after that, came back to his place
Where the guy and the girl went up in the house
Closed the doors, then turned the lights out
Excuse me if I'm so rude to remind you
but all night long I done wined you and dined you
I done spent, every cent I had
Now listen here baby I'm about to get mad
All night long at the dinner at the movies
you was talkin 'bout what you was gonna do to me!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now we gonna rock and bust a move
We gonna show y'all people how we groove
Now's the time to get on up
We gonna make you dance, and shake your butts
Boogie down, to a brand new beat
And I want you all, to dance like freaks
Be ready to rock, and ready to roll
Gonna rock this beat with so much soul
So boogie down, boogie down
Boogie booga boogie boogie boogie down
And now we gonna get to the good part
Get, get get to the good part
Now we gonna get to the good part
We gonna groove, gonna groove to the good part
Now we gonna rock to the good part
Gotta rock gotta rock to the good part

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]
Now, you might think I'm playin but this is from my heart
I don't believe there IS a good part!
Cause I've been hustlin, bustlin and bustin my chops
And I STILL can't get to the good part!
I'm not lookin for a yacht or a diamond ring
I don't want a Rolls or take the limousine
Cause life is a center, of many treats
But the worst people seem to get the best seats!
But I keep goin fo' it, and I won't stop
Because I don't believe there IS a good part!
Cause I've been searchin and lurchin and lookin real good
Cause if there IS a good part, it ain't in my neighborhood!

[Chorus] - 2X to fade</pre>
