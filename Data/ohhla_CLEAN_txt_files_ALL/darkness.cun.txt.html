[Deacon]
Searchin for answers is like searchin for Atlantis 
I'm working poor and I'm just hurtin for some chances 
This school of a living's like prison on a campus 
Show me the Monet, and the pixels in that canvas 
Advance through my imagery, I view my evil deeds 
When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory 
When I called on Mary J., be my serenity 
So I don't see that all my enemies resembled me 
I'm feelin faceless headin for a bitter state 
I'm tryin to place but my heart ain't even in the race 
I've came far enough that turnin back is time wasted 
Imprisoned by fear, I don't need no iron bracelets 
What's my fate? How can I escape my heart? 
I'm running blind, an open mind could break the stark 
A major spark might just make a star in this ("Darkness...")

[Chorus]
"Dream on, dream on..."
"Dream on, dream on..."
"Dream on, dream on..."
"Dream on, dream on..."

Way under in slumber is my true self shown? 
A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown 
Pain/pane in the windows of a once happy home 
I'm a Cheshire Cat laughin at the caged birds' song 
A caterpillar shroomin usin fumes from my bong 
to cloud a land wonderin what fuels what is wrong 
Lust in my loins, vengeance in my heart 
Thrust from my groin that can populate an ark 
Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark 
I cain't let come to light so I might suffocate the spark 
That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart 
Opinions of my health, myself, and wealth go off the chart 
My struggle to keep balance ain't a challenge, it's an art 
Outside my sleep is silent cause inside the war is fought 
Every night, as I fade to the ("Darkness...")

Don't gimme that bullshit
Don't gimme that bullshit
Don't let it take over you
Don't let it take over you-ou
Don't gimme that bullshit
Don't gimme that bull-whoa-whoa-whoa-shit
Don't give me that, don't let it take over you
Don't gimme that bullshit
Don't gimme that bullshit
Don't let it take over you
Don't let it take over you-ou
Don't gimme that bullshit
Don't gimme that bull-whoa-whoa-whoa-shit!
Don't give me that, don't let it take over you-ou ("Darkness...")
