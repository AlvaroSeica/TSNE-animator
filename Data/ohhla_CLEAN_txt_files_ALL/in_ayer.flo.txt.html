[Intro/Chorus 2X: will.i.am]
Oh hot damn, this is my, jam..

[Flo Rida]
Heeeeeeey! This my jam
Y'all don't understand, I'ma make you understand

Party all night like YAYER YAYER
Shawty got her hands in the AYER AYER
Make me wanna take it THERE, there I go
Here I go, yeah, that's my song
DJ bring it back, come in my zone
I get paid for dat, count them bones
then let's WOP, until the early morn'
I need that funk whem I'm up in the club
Even my Chevy that pull up on dubs
Give me that drop down the waist like a drug
Lil' mama hot and she might show me love
Oh, hot - DAMN, celebrate 'til the A.M.
I love it so much, it's got me sayin..

[Chorus: will.i.am, then will.i.am and Fergie]
Oh hot damn, this is my, jam..
Keep me partyin, 'til the A.M.
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
in the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

[Flo Rida]
Heeeeeeey! I just might start the wave
like I'm at the ball game, do my thang
Hands up, I got, money in the bank
I'm so fly, 747 plane
Rock it, don't stop it, how I got my name
Baby, KEEP poppin you might get the fame
Walk the red carpet, won't see you the same
I get to stuntin, no (MINIMUM WAAAAGE)
Slide wit me, ride wit me
Come ride to represent, gotta vibe wit me
Make, me, throw it up, bartender in the club
Go 'head and po' it up, gotta wonder how I does
Get buck and showin up they (stare stare)
I'm hood, so it's really un- (fair fair)
Look good, shawty gon' get (bare bare)
We check, rum my city like the (mayor mayor)

[Chorus: will.i.am and Fergie]

A-stick-up, touch the ceilin, baby

Wave 'em, wave 'em round and round, side to side {SIDE TO SIDE}
