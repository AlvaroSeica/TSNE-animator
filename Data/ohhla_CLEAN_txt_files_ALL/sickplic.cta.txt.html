Vakill..

I'm a harbinger of death with a flow otherworldly
Cancer cluster that wasn't discovered early
Shittin on you 'til your body covered thoroughly
My quotes cockblock throats
'Til MC's unable to respond
Like I just told a homeless person a knock knock joke
Malicious; tattooed F.U.N. on my dick
For "Fuck You Niggaz" while I poke fun at yo' bitch
Leavin spitters missin vowels, shitters disemboweled
The last one you clearly wouldn't doubt
Niggaz won't consider dissin now
Fuck punchlines and metaphors; I settle wars
spittin darts 'til puncture wounds look like an extra set of pores
I'm morally sick and auspicious, all vicious
Quick to jaw bitches 'til they chin hit the ground like drawbridges
Potnah, yo' whole style Ichabod Crane
I'm leavin all you riders headless when I squeeze off these Sleepy Hollows
and pick apart brains, blow to smidgens
My shit on point like infrared scopes strapped on the ass of homing pigeons

[scratched]
"It ain't nothin.." "It's simple ain't it? But quite clever"
"I'm the sickest"</pre>
