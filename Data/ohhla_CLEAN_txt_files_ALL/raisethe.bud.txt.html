Song:   Raise the Roof
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Hook: Buddha Monk]
Raise the roof, raise the roof, from sun up to sun down, we
Raise the roof, raise the roof, from sun up to sun down, we
Raise the roof, raise the roof, from sun up to sun down, we

[Buddha Monk]
As I, raise the roof, ya'll labels regroup
Stashing, saying shit and rules that never happen
But Daddy Warbucks still rated five mics
Drunk off of Henny, grinding ass all night
She give good head, my love, daddy sling pipe
Asking, 'was that you I saw last night?'
Yea, that was me, BET bling, feeling on this thing-thing
Number one, on your video screen
You can catch it on Cita or Funkmaster Flex
The Bassment, 106, play it at eight, kid
Nothing but greatness, tune in ya faces
Ya'll like it so much, even playa haters played it
I make it, just to let you know who's the greatest
Brooklyn, my town, the one that keeps taking it
Don't need a hundred troops, just a gun and Timbs boots
Black shirt, black pants, and a black mask
Disrespect this and I'll touch you fast
Lay that ass up with a coma or relapse
Do you think that you need this trouble where you sleep at
I was taught don't shit where you eat at

[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
Raise the roof, raise the roof
Raise the roof, raise the roof
Raise the roof, raise the roof
Raise the roof, raise the roof

[Buddha Monk]
I was, born a hustler, so I'mma stay a hustler
Run wit the click whose slugs will cut ya
My getty up niggas, love to ante up niggas
Tear up six figures, send hollow points, deliver
I dare ya'll to make one move, from here, ya'll
It'll be, doctor send EMS here
Newsflash, Daddy Warbucks done killed that ass
Had no remorse, just let his gun talk
Grew up, and crimed up, where at? By New York
Avenue, St. Marx, where the guns bark
Whether day or dark, I ain't afraid to let it off
If it's beef, nigga, then we gonna get it on
So fuck with me wrong, then my thug'll start bugging, whoa, you dead
I ain't never been scared, the dome will tear the flesh
If it's murder she wrote, then BK be gun notes, nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
