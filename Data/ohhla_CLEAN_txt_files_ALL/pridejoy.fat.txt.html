[Intro: Busta Rhymes, DJ Khaled, Jadakiss, Miguel, Mos Def, Roscoe Dash]
And even if she all about the money I don't really care! Care!
I got alot of money it's enough of it that we could share! Share!
And even if she all about the money I don't really care! Care!
I got alot of money it's enough of it that we could share! Share!
 
[Verse One: Fat Joe] (Kanye West)
(Well then she's still my pride and joy!) Courtside at the Knick game who the don?!
Plus I worked on your kick game Louboutin
Bercon bags made of python
She a beautiful nightmare (Turn the lights on!)
So I can see that ass
Word to Martin Louis the King (She free at last)
(Word to my nigga Joe Crack you let her hold some stacks)
Yeah before we go to the club she wanted golden sacks
I let her get the gold card I'm a hold the black
(I let her get the black card I couldn't hold it back)
'Cause back in the backyard she used to hold the crack
So I cut them other hoes off like the coldesac
Uh! Now how cold is that

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
I ain't never fucked another like this, I need, some more
You 'gon have to show me more, before you steal my pride and joy
What's goin on with me and you, is real, for sure
But you' gon have to show me more, before you steal my pride and joy
Before you steal my pride and......joy!

[Verse Two: Fat Joe] (Kanye West)
I hate that I have to, share with another yo
But she love women and she keeps it undercover yo
And I love women so she brings 'em under covers yo
Fight then we fuck again I swear I really love her though
(Well it's still my pride and joy! joy! joy!)
+Don't Wanna Be A Player+ I could find another Joe
Just to prove I love her I use rubbers on my other hoes
And if she ever find out it be another blow
And that only mean that I'm a have to hit another sto' (My pride and joy!)
Spend another knot, hit another lot
That's how you know if you in love or not
Bought her moms a whip on mother's day
Now I gotta get her the same whip her mother got
Pass the Nuvo Mach!

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
I ain't never fucked another like this, I need, some more
You 'gon have to show me more, before you steal my pride and joy
What's goin on with me and you, is real, for sure
But you' gon have to show me more, before you steal my pride and joy
Before you steal my pride and......joy!
