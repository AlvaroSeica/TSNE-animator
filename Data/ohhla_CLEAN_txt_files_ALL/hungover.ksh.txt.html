[Ke$ha]
And now the sun is rising
And now the long walk back home... (back home)
There's just so many faces
But no one I need to know... (need to know)
In the dark I, can't fight it
I fake 'til, I'm numb
But in the bright light
I taste you on my tongue

[Chorus]
Now the party's over and everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I, wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken, like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter, or am I just hung-over you?

[Interlude]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Or am I just hungover?

[Ke$ha]
Even my dirty laundry
Everything just smells like you... (like you)
And now my head is throbbing
Every song is out of tune... (just like you)
In the dark I, can't fight it
'til it disappears
But in the daylight
I taste you in my tears

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
Now I've got myself, lookin like a mess
Standin alone, here at the end I try to pretend
But no, I put up my fight, but this is it this time
Cause I'm here at the end tryin to pretend
Here at the end, tryin to pretend

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
