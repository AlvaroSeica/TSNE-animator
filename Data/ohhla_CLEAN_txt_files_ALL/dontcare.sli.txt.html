Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Dont give 'em your love
But don't give 'em your heart
But don't give 'em your love
But they tear it apart
But dont give 'em your love
Friend, don't give 'em your heart
But they tearing it up
But then tear it apart
No, cause I don't care no more
No, I don't care no more
Cause I don't care no, uh
No, I don't care no more
No, I don't care no more
Cause I don't care no
Yeah, the way you move, the way you walk
But you don't talk that way to me
Lord, the way you move, the way you walk
My mother, turn away from me
No, cause I don't care no more
No, I don't care no more
No, cause I don't care no, uh
No, I don't care no more
No, I don't care no more
No, I don't care no
Yeah, the way you move, the way you walk
But you don't walk away from me
Yeah, the way you move, the way you talk
But you don't talk that way to me
Dont give'm your love
But just give 'em your heart
But don't give 'em your love
When they tear it apart
When I give you my love
When I give you my heart
But not giving it up
When you tear it apart
But don't give 'em your love
But don't give 'em your heart
For they tearing it up
But they tear it apart
But not giving it up
We call the thing-a that you gotta, gotta, proper, proper
Because me walking like it tough for me to, doctor, doctor
He nod, the night time will-a me-a juke and jock and stuck ya
Me want the better part of thing-a you offered
As she walk me feel the thing __ the jeopardy
Who mon? I'll talk, but she know she was sweat to me
Things that she got, parting a flap, why not?
He and I, the __ and me done now
Not giving my love
They not giving my heart
But not giving it up, up
When they tear it apart
Whe I give you my love
Oh ma, give 'em my heart
But don't tearing it up
No, why tear it apart?
When I give you my love
When I give you my heart
But don't tearing it up
But don't tear it apart, don't
Let love go, baby, gotta let the little lover stay
Im gonna be a boss DJ night and day, come on and play
Ba-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily
Because me give you, feel me heart, and me give you, feel me soul
No, little girl cause your hearts so cold
I said be gone, ba-diddily, I tell ya, said be gone
Now me say hug upon the pistol and me more control
This someone at me trouble, touch your soul
Me said be gone, a little girl, me said be gone
A cause I give, you feel me heart, and then you tear it apart
A little girl, me say your heart is so small
I said me give, you feel me soul, are you a rock and roll
A little girl, I say your heart is so cold
Let me tell ya, said be gone, ba-diddily-diddily, said be gone
Cause me say love a little brother, baby love blood to bones
For you will love him more than some-a, we'll lock him closed
The one that really don't know is-a want it the most, I said be gone
Because you just like a hard grown gypsy
And every time that you see me get tipsy
You just a-walk and shake like you're sexy
Because you look like a bottle of Pepsi
Let me tell ya, said be gone, ba-diddildy
Ah let me tell ya, said be gone
Cause me say, what Im gonna give you is the straight forward love
Me coming like a pyramid, said why bother love?
Just be gone, ba-diddily, well let me tell ya, said be gone
Cause me say, have come a some, I said the more speed I come
Said, many times woman, said you're jumping on me, have we get one
No, you are real that a lie
Ba-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily
Me say, all of my heart and soul
Lord, me say, all of my heart and soul</pre>
