[sample]
"Oh, now you are one lucky nigger"
"You better listen to your boss, white boy"
"Oh, I'mma go walking in the moonlight with you"
"You wanna hold my hand?"
"Hahaha"

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins, oh lord
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, oh lord, black coffins
I need a hundred...

[Rick Ross]
I seen a hundred niggas die
I put that on my life, lord, I wouldn't tell a lie
Unless it had to do with mine, in the middle of the night
Killas coming for your life, all he wanna do is shine
I broke off the chains, only the realest remain
See you praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain
Seen a brother get slain, for a job full of change
Yet I post on the block, look like I'm Big Daddy Kane
Is you a cat or a mouse, keep them rats out the house
Battle scars on my back, nigga, tattoos all around
Hundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins
Money on his head, bitch, I'm trynna make a fortune

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I seen a hundred women burn
As they stood firm, treat a nigga like a germ
What did she do to deserve, put me on the farm
Pig's feet in the jar, serve it to me warm
Any questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Django
Got me working in fields, too many years, it get fatal
All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother
On the days that it rain, her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch, cuz I'm coming
Got to die in my arms for what you did to my mother
Hundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins
Twelve gauge shotgun, chest full of copper, boom

[Chorus]</pre>
