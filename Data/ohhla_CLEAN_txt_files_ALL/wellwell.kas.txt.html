Chorus: Jadakiss (2X)

Just making out way in the world today
takes everything we got
Being involved with all this money
sure do help a lot

Verse One: Styles Paniro

L-O-X bars, deeper than the bitches in the cars
Styles hits the scene start twisting up the Lah
And only Allah, will I fear when I'm here
cuz even if I die I'ma be deeper where I stare
That's either the ground or in the air do you hear?
and if you don't dog let me make myself clear
My attitude towards you, I feel I oughtta to sword you
I'm in the whip, playing your shit, I fast forward you

Jadakiss:

It ain't no money now like it used to be back in them days
stark blue 840 Convert. with the MKs
Two-for-Five come free honeys try to pimp Jay
but I just kick 'em to the curb like a Sensei
Flow been here ever since the Rakim days
ask Maria how I blew it down mad Wednesdays
Now you feel me in your body like Ben Gay
fuck what your mens say, them niggaz can't offend Jay

Sheek Luchion:

How many niggaz that you know
can go solo
And sell three...million and recoup
each 9 for the group
L.O.X. melt tracks like choc-o-la-te
like M&amp;M's let that Phillippino bite my body
I can't sleep but not over no chick like Kelly
constantly the ATF taps my celly
Butterflies in my belly, got me 'bout to flee to Brazil
underwater, submarine style like Lauryn Hill we chill
'Ready or Not' couldn't find another style like mine-a
L.O.X. the Dream Team you'll get dunked on China
Reminder nigga, we the real McCoys
with a little twist of pumping crack, quick to bust your warriors
Plus we keep our b-b-b-bones
up in your main bitch when you don't be home

Kasino:

Scared money don't make money
I got courage I take money, God don't like ugly
But he got to love hungry, I do things to change
the small change for the Range when I see Him I'll explain
I know the price, I went from playing dice for dollars
to "Give it up dog" cuz I'd rather steal than borrow
Keep enough ice on the big and little hands of the Movado
the time stays froze, that's my motto
One in a million people wins the Lotto
But give any dick access to the bricks
he'll learn how to flip
I treat my ones like a trick
when she acts up somebody gots to get fucked to double what I spent
And I admit, I done a lot of bad things to get where I'm at
but I always came back
