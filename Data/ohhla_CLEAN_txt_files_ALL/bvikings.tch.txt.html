[Intro: dialogue from "Planet of the Apes"]
Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn
Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust, or greed
Yay, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land
Let him not breed in great numbers
for he will make a desert of his home, and yours
Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair
for he is the harbinger of death

[Poison Pen]
G'yeah~!! Immortal Technique
SP the Ghost, Poison Pen, Vinnie Paz, nagga
We gon' stomp 'em out, gun 'em out, run 'em out
Call your number out, send the Uncle Ruckus out
We gon' stomp 'em out, gun 'em out, run 'em out
Nigga ain't nuttin civilized 'bout no Uncle Ruckus nigga
Don't bring the Uncle Ruckus out nigga - the fuck outta here

[Immortal Technique]
All troops in formation?
Let the siege, commence!
Back like I was locked up, puttin in work
Burnin through books like Nazis in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fuckin your mother
I'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the God of War
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the djinn type
That'll make you hate the way Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu, niggaszthat be bleachin they skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and raped demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
or sacrifice them, in the same fire we burnin you
Barbarian funeral nigga, you oughta know
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow

[Chorus: Poison Pen]
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them
Uprise, rape them, raid them, cage them
Pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants commit the best murder
Pillage, kill them, erase history, make them a mystery

[Styles P]
Cut the nose off or the ears off a whole head
Immortal and Ghost coming - code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior warlord pussy~! Cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want - the sword or get shit sawed off?
{*chainsaw reves*} You don't need a axe in it
And I'm breakin your back cause your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me I'm comin to fumigate
Like Wolverine and Sabretooth the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising
except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines
How you wanna die? Make your own suggestion
Now talk to the Lord and make your own confession

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah! You pussies livin in a movie theatre
Put the motherfuckin spell on you like Brujeria
Chop his muh'fuckin head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
You need to be Godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eatin 'round me like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold the motherfuckin toaster for?
I ain't goin there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in dashiki and stab wounds
I'm a guerrilla, barbarians is my ancestors
That's a part of my neurological transmitters
We Islamic and brought the story of Sham with us
while we brought the motherfuckin blam blam with us

[Chorus]

[Outro - part 1]
Yeah nigga~! The walls have been breached
Advaaance!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood
You wanted us bound in slavery
Poisoned our water, changed our names
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
(Hold on, hold on, hold on...)

[interrupted by Chorus]

[Outro - part 2]
No one will know these people ever existed
And all that will be left
is what we build upon their ruins

[Chorus] - to end</pre>
