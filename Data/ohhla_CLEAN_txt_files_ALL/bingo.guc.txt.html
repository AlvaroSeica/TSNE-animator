[Intro]
It's Gucci, it's Gucci, brr! (Soulja Boy tell 'em)
It's Gucci...  Flocka!
Scott Storch, Gucci Mane, we back at it (brr)
So Icey, yeahhhhh

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
We smokin, that fire indo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo', that straight bingo
Izzo, that straight bingo
Phantom, that straight bingo
Concept, that straight bingo
Pull-up, ki's straight bingo
Yo mo-mma straight bingo
Bingo {*8X*}

[Interlude]
Ahh, it's Gucci, it's Gucci
Ahh, vroom, vrooom
It's Gucci, Scotty
Catch it, whoa, brrr

[Gucci Mane]
Hello, my watch yellow
Earrings on my bezel
Can't fit, in my schedule
Less booty like jello
She know I slang kilos
Shout out to my 'migo
I call, he said ten-fo'
Tight like, Lamont Rollo
My goal for El Gato
My house like a brothel
Fat hoes in Chicago
First class, tomorrow Morroco
Bingo, call my motto
Phantom with two models
Pull up tonight, strapped
Jump out, car scream pronto

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ahh, it's Gucci! (Soulja)
It's Gucci! (Soulja Boy tell 'em)
Vroom, vroom (e'rybody wear)
(E'rybody wear pants out here)

[Soulja Boy verse]
Pass by in my Lambo', kids screamin bingo
Haters wanna hate, they'll get shot like a free throw
Candy paint wet (woosh) drippin off my headlights
Catch me in the trap like some motherfuckin dead mice
Every time I cut a corner kids screamin bingo! (bingo!)
Tools on deck, I ain't talkin Home Depot! (Depot!)
Soulja Boy tell 'em (tell 'em) I'm icy as a icicle
So much money, bitch I valet park my bycicle

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ahh, it's Gucci, it's Gucci
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flocka

[Waka Flocka Flame]
All the hood hoes point like "Bingo"
Waka Flocka "Oh Let's Do It" is the single
Let's mingle, got hoes like Wingo
My bitch a dime, yo' look like a single
Like a free throw (what) man I'm ballin out (swish!)
Blew a kiss to the girls, now they fallin out
I pull up in the T top Cutlass like bingo
My girlfriend Regal same color as a flamingo

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ahh, it's Gucci, it's Gucci
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
Shawty, catch up, brr, brr
Bingo~!</pre>
