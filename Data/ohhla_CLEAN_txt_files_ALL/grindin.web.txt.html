Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
I love girls
What's the matter with that?
And they like me back
As a matter of fact
See I'm at the bar
Grabbing a drink
Give 'em a wink
If she smiles
I'll be over there quick as an eye blinks

And I think you lookin' real sexy, yo
If you wanna hit the dance floor
Let me know
I'm already thinkin' about hittin' it
Or licking it like licorice
Wishin' the perfect image
It change up the sun into me

Your style
Girl I'm diggin' it
She stay fly
And if she got the fresh kicks on
I gotta say hi
I be
Highly
Skilled with the rhythm
Don't try me

Step up in the club
No I.D
Like I don't give a fuck
That I'm 19
Find me at the bar doin' work
Lookin' for the girl here with the shortest skirt

Now go back forth
Right left
Pull it
Push till you're running out of breathe
With me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Back forth
Left right
Grab it
Tongue goin' at it all night
With me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor

Screamin' Ay Bay Bay
In the club
So make way
Just had a pay day
Ya need vajayjay
Okay?
Now y'all ain't ready for this
Girl so just stop
Take a break real quick

Not smoother
Slick
But my game's still sick
I'll make Tila Tequila stick to the dick
Listen to this;
Hip-hop song soon as I enter
For stop on the list
To the closest bartender
Checkin' on the list
As to find me a chick
After I sing right out my peoples
And drank a bit

Taking shot after shot after shot after shot
If I got money
Then why not?
I got lyrics
And rhyme hot
I got the hottest bitches on campus on my-
What?
'Cause it's all about the sex man
Just jump on the dance floor
And grind like an X-Game

Now go back forth
Right left
Pull it
Push till you're running out of breathe
With me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Back forth
Left right
Grab it
Tongue goin' at it all night
With me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor

One time
And two steppin'
I'm two steppin'
I rhyme with perfection
I grind with aggression
I'm from behind
On the side in resection
Got it on her mind
But the grind's my profession
If she get blogded
Cup a wine for refreshment

On the dance floor
Tryin' to find a contestant
So try to find a contestant
What a shame
Even if you're fine
You're a freshman
Three of four options
Never nothing less than
Dimes do it
Never find my dimension
No

Eights and nines
And two or three sevens
And if you line 'em up
It's booty meet heaven
A couple shots here and there
Feeling invincible
Mami over there
And her friend's irrisistible
I scored 3
And called it the hattrick
The transition from the dance floor
To my mattress

Just grind with me
Yeah, grind with me
Yeah
Drop it to the floor
Girl, grind with me
Just grind with me
C'mon and grind with me
If you hustle on my rocket
And you grind with me
Now, grind with me
C'mon and grind with me
My sexy women and the bar
Just grind with me
Now grind with me
Get on your grind with me
Who can grind with me?
Now baby grind with me
Yeah
I'm feelin' good
Stay on that grind, baby
But you got a bag full of dubs in your pocket
And a fat ass baggin' all up on your shit
Stay grindin'
