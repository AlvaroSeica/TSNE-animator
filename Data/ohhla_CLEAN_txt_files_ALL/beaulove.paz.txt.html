[Intro]
Yeah motherfuckers! Guess who's back?!
Y'all muh'fuckers ain't think I was goin nowhere
Yo Shuko whattup?
Official Pistol Gat
Yo Paz kill these motherfuckers!

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm out for whatever you wanna call it, cash or paper
My only purpose to kill, perfect assassinator
I'm on the path of Islam, you on the path of Vader
My nickname Buck 50 cousin pass the razor
The 750i turn you from a fan to hater
Feeling myself like I'm a chronic masturbator
I ain't the type of motherfucker you should ask a favor
I'm the type of motherfucker that'll blast my neighbour
I look at anybody as weak that has a savior
The Israeli Galil will turn your ass to vapor
I got an Ingram MAC-11 and it has a laser
I got a thing for MAC-11's not a passive nature
Everything I write is war on the pad and paper
I don't listen to rap no more, my passion's Slayer
My heart is cold as the temperature of a massive glacier
I put a giant hole inside you like a massive crater

[Interlude]
YEAH MAN~! I'm just out here shinin baby
Tryin to make this money
Beautiful love or beautiful hate
It's all the same to me
O.P.G., Pazienza
Y'all know how we fuckin get down out here
Philly in the building baby!!

[Vinnie Paz]
Everywhere I go to ball, Paz is strapped
I'll be loadin it up, I'll be cockin it back
I ain't in my right mind, I ain't stoppin at that
I will hit his lifeline in the back of his cap
See I'm faster than the muh'fucker grabbin his gat
Beating me is just illogical, imaginin that
I'm a G born and you are just a pacifist rat
I make bodies disappear like a magical act
Yeah, I'm just givin the fans another anthem
This is just another example of my expansion
I make your top drop like the new Phantom
I like to pop shots with my new cannon
The left hook wild vicious, I'm a champion
You ain't wildin out cousin, that's a tantrum
Wild assault rifles, 30 fuckin handguns
I'm holding all of you motherfuckers for ransom

[Outro]
{*laughing*} Pazienza baby!
Y'all know how I get down
17 years in the game
Ain't too many of y'all fuckin with the God
Official Pistol Gat, ay O.P.G., you did it
Philly baby!</pre>
