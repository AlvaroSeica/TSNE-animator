[Lawrence Michaels]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on

[Monteloco]
Yeah
It's Monteloco
I want everybody
To do me a favor
And throw your drinks in the air

Chorus:
[Lawrence Michaels] All the ladies in the house tonight
                    All the fellas in the house tonight
                    Throw your drinks up
[Monteloco]         Drinks in the air, freaks everywhere

(Verse 1)
It's Loco, baby
Back at it
Got 'em hooked like
Crack addicts
Chop the herb with the
Craft-matic
The party's packed like
Bad traffic
We on the Ave.
V.I.P. clubs
P.J. thugs and three day runs
Throw your drinks up, don't spill it on the rug
Mama find out, we all kick the fuck out (Out...)
Bedford life like steriods and A.K.'s
Back in the day, used to buy shit on layaway
Loco came up in the rap game, what?
Buying trucks
Changing last names up
From Mr. Broke Ass to Mr. Mo' Cash
Don't laugh
Hoes used to roll past
Now they wanna team up, split my cream up
Put the beat up and throw your drink up
Pilots, go pilot
I'm wildin' out
Drinks in the air, freaks everywhere
From
Cali to Dally
Memphis to Texas
Boston to Slauston
Bossin' and flossin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Throw your drinks up if you drunk or you faded
Tonight, we celebrate
Loco made it
From the swap meets, to the Mom and Pops
To rockin' hot beats
On top the yatz
Pop the fonzi, lyrical shit kicker
I mix liquor
Then I spit sicker
Guaranteed to hit with ya
Get with ya
You the small screen
I'm the big picture
Like IMAX
I write the fly raps
Save the wise cracks
I'm a ride that
Got this party crackin', like war in Iraq-n
Honies get macked when I'm, strapped for action
TG3 flashin'
New CD smashin'
Hundred thousand copies, sold, from when we go gold
Pimp Latino
Throw up your piston
Me so crazy like Vin Diesel, baby
You'se a chump, you don't wanna crush a hoe
We in the club huntin' (???) bubba low
Headed to the high end on the Sunset Strip
Residential suite
Come get ripped

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook: Lawrence Michaels
All the ladies in the house tonight
Throw your drinks up if you feelin' alright
All the fellas in the house tonight
Throw your drinks up if you feelin' alright

Repeat Hook
