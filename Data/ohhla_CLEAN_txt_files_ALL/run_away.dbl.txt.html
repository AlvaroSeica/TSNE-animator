[Double]
Double
And Lupe
Uppercut
Talk to 'em

[Rap Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I be
In the cut
Chillin'
Feelin' good
Philippe
In my cup
Dyptique
Send it up
Parisian somethin' plush
And she's
In a crush (Yeah)
Cause he's got it on smash
With no fuss
No fugazi, no fakery, just flux
And frush
And she's frustrated with the fluff
So rush
And come to marinate it with some much more
On it, most wanted's
FNF, up
All the time, man

[Double]
(Verse 1)
Sexy
Anata wo hajimete
Mita no wa in the dark
But you were shining
Nazeka wakaranai kedo
Sexy
Tadayou intelligence
Kanjiru
Kawashita little chat
Sore dake de mou
Take me away

Chorus: Double
Yasashiku daite
Tsurete itte
To another place
Doko e demo, doko made mo
Anata to nara (Run away)
Yukeru kara (Run away, run away)
Te wo hanasanaide
Tsurete itte
To another world
Dare no te mo, dare no me mo
Todokanu basho (Show me how)
Run away, run away

(Verse 2)
Sexy
Anata wa mukuchi de, demo chiteki de ku-ru
Koboshita namida
Nazeka wakaranai kedo
Sexy
Tagai no tomodachi
Yonderu kedo
Forget about 'em baby
Futari no sekai
Nani mo iranai
Sexy
Anata wa sexy
If you feel the same way too
What about you, baby
Sexy
Kono mama futarikiri de
Let's just hide away
Nanimokamo sutete
Kamawanai

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Double
Matataku ma
Koi ni ochiru shunkan
Mou anata ni muchuu
Mabataki wa
Mottainai kara
So I'm gonna keep my eyes open
Wide

[Rap Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Sweet in
180 reasons
To send you back to your homegirls believin'
Make 'em wanna be in the same position that we's in
If the air ain't foreign, then it ain't weren't breathin'
If we can understand it, then it ain't worth readin'
If it's too cold, I fly ya to another season
December's everywhere, but it's winter over there
And the summer's over here, come and kick it with a playa (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus</pre>
