Now another FBI monitor with no feedback
See me on the street, ask me where the weed at
Or the coke "I don't sell!", they yell " I don't believe that!"
Set me up for running, breathin' like a sleestak
Run into a car and almost bent my knee back
It's better than the sale where my lawyers fee stack
Run into a liquor store they ask what you do
Wearin' boo boo I'm with my man M'duku
The fact don't come through
I said "Merci beaucoup."
If they ask you was I runnin', tell them bastards I flew
Made it to the hood, palace to catch a few flicks
Police did a raid, terrorizin' crew shit
Bustin' dope eatin' mommas while they makin' cool whip
Face down, gettin' dirt on my back to school fit
My neighbor next to me got black and blue lips
When the fuse lit, you goin' see the view flip
Kick our boot up they ass, ask 'em if the shoe fit
'til then they wanna see us pushing up tu-lips
Press my nuts so much, shit, I think I'm sterile
Got up, brush the gravel off my apparel
This girl, Sheryl, got parole violation
Said she was high cause of pupil dilation
If you never been to jail, now, since infinity
You'll get searched livin' in this vicinity
Or harassed, beat the shit, I mean the living daylights
Wouldn't be no dope slangin' if McDonald's paid right
The ruling class ships dope to you and me
And don't get arrested; is this lunacy?
Or is it pimplomatic immunity?
Is it a war on drugs, or just my community?

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
Now, who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
This type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I starts to swerve
Who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
This type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I starts to swerve

[Boots Riley]
I got a communist plot to get the federalies out
So many cops'd run in flock it's been away, 2Pac
You got a flake and two rocks, and two Gs in the shoebox
Cause was it after two knocks, you hurdled fences in your socks
This is for la gente, keep it caliente
Let's send the presidente on a one-way trip to Kaiser, permanente
Not a teacher, but a sensei
These rhymes are for battle, plus, you gotta get the rent paid
I bust a donut up in front of Winchell's, make this police state officials
Cause they talk differential
Now it's essential, these rhymes ain't provincial
Coroners call our bodies "White chalk stencils"
Broke as fuck, eatin' lentils with no utensil
That type a shit motivated my pencil
It ain't mental, it's material
Police are the fists of the imperial
I'm spittin' through your stereo
Babies need cereal, folks need currency
My job got a crowd wavin' applications fervently
Some'd get accepted, most'd get rejected
Guess they goin' have to hustle 'til the new prison get erected
And now they sully unemployment street
They be makin' microchips for two dollars a week
And they'll be packin' us in there in droves and fleets
and channel two goin' call it cleanin' up the street

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
Now, who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
This type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I starts to swerve
Who gets paper and who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and who gets served?
This type of shit get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I starts to swerve

[Boots Riley]
Now who gets paper and... who gets perved?
Who gets slapped and... who gets served?
This type of shit... get on my last nerve
I think about it in the car and I... starts to swerve</pre>
