Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Boy you are a natural healing
Each time I see you smile
No words on earth describe this feeling
That you conjure up inside
All I know is that I'm drowning, in love
And I don't wanna be saved
T don't know when I ever did without ya baby
But now I'm counting my blessings each day

[Chorus]
Never felt a love like ours
He vanishes my scars
And and just fills me to the brim with joy
Washes away my pain
He's my sunshine and my rain
My absolute everything, my baby boy
I'm so in love, so deep in love
So in loveeeee...
So complete in love

Now they say that your a reflection of me
I find it hard to believe
Cause you define perfection
Your an infectious breath of beauty
Oh yeeah

[Repeat Chorus]

See life
with you, my king
Is life without fear
Don't worry baby boy
Every time you turn around
Mama gonna be here
I'll be your strength in your time of need
May I be more, may I
Help you find, all that your searching for...

Baby I'm so in love, baby I'm so in love
Baby I'm so in love, you got me so deep in love
Baby I'm so in love, baby I'm so in love
Baby I'm so in love, you got me so deep in love

Baby I'm so in love, baby I'm so in love
Baby I'm so in love, you got me so deep in love
Baby I'm so in love, baby I'm so in love
Baby I'm so in love, you got me so deep in love

I'm so in love
So deep in love
Falling in love with you
Soooo weak in love
So complete in love
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you</pre>
