[Intro]
Throw it up, throw it up - watch it fall out
Pour it up, pour it up - that's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up - watch it fall out
Pour it up, pour it up - that's how we ball out

[Rihanna]
Strip clubs and dolla' bills - still got mo' money
Patron shots can I get a refill - still got mo' money
Strippers going up and down that pole - still got mo' money
4'o clock and we ain't going home - still got mo' money
Money make the world go round - still got mo' money
Bands make you girl go down - still got mo' money
Lot more where that came from - still got mo' money
The look in your eyes, I know you want some - still got mo' money

[Chorus]
Oh-ohh-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dolla' signs
Oh-ohh-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Money on my mind, money-money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up, watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up - watch it fall out
Pour it up, pour it up - that's how we ball out
Throw it up throw it up - watch it fall out
Pour it up, pour it up - that's how we ball out
That's how we ball out {*3X*}

[Rihanna]
Valet cost a hundred bill - still got mo' money
Gold all up in my grill - still got mo' money
Who cares how you haters feel - still got mo' money
Call Jay up and close a deal - still got mo' money
My fragrance on and they love my smell - still got mo' money
So who care about what I spend - still got mo' money
My pockets deep and they never end - still got mo' money
I'm going dumb with all my friends - still got mo' money

[Chorus]</pre>
