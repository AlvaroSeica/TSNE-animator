[Chorus 2X: Treasurer]
City, yeah, it's what they call me
C-I-T-Y, C I Told Ya'll, see?

[Joe Mafia]
Straight off the gate, dig it, I'm lying to the bone grisstle
Miss me with the bullshit, nigga it's official
Rock blocks, hold big shit on the humbug
Get a slug up in your mug, it's our slum
I do this for the love, real recognize real
In the clutch, get fucked up, my click max mill
Yeah, I got that throat throat, it's all about the dough
Fuck so so, niggas ain't stopping my flow, it's real
Ready to die, let a nigga fly on my own two
Wu-Syndica' affiliate, and I done gon' through
Hades, to make these, bitch ass niggas flip
Like they on the trapez', straight g's
Pimps to russle hustle, accustomed, strictly biz
You a customer, I'm done fucking with them
Came through and do a Thug War in '99
For me, it's rhyme or crime, I'mma stay on my grind, jack

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
Model come swallowing chicks, my motto is this
I'm guaranteed to eat, why rift, handle beef discreate
Roll dirty in whips, with us, some extra clip shit
High powered equipment, dig it?
58 West, Diamond Street, see I told ya'll
Lame cats, I'm taking it back, crushing ya'll corn balls
Niggas putting shit in the game, listen closely
Keep your mouth shut, or get fucked up, approaching me
We can handle it on the mic, or cock hammer shit
Rock this on the block, when you mopping our gorilla whips
You ain't a killa, popping all that, really
I'm too city, matter of fact, I keep a wolf pack with me
Blood thirsty, VA to CA
New Yitty to Jersey, ATL bubbling
South Cack, you heard me, I'm all over this shit
Global thug politics, what's popping my nigga?

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
For the p's, dope, coke and big guns
Ghetto, blow smoke in my lungs, don't get it fucked up
I rep S-U-Double F-O, VA's finest
One thug, TKO, mind poling minor
Doing it once again, we back ya'll
Black Lotus, got that mack to ya'll, pleasing my nigga P.R.
Rest in peace to Chilly Moe, city ass, fly cats
Dirty dancing with masses in mansion
That's it, yo, a hundred and ten, and wont bend
Cash Rules, keep a butter smooth blend, we rude
G5 wagons and Bentley's, six hundred tinted Benzy's
Navigators, Impalas and Volvo's

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
