[Illicit]
Yeah..yo
I tried to paint a perfect picture of a perfect picture
Hazard result of this shit, no hits like a perfect pitcher
You heard +Life's a Bitch+, well I flirted with her
Keep strikin out, now I'm takin swings at her curvy sister
I don't think you get it, not knowin where you headed
Everyday is more dreaded than the last, yeah I said it
Cause I wake up with the feeling that I'm lacking all the credit
I deserve, payin dues every track, every second
Cause I do this shit for you and you, I never do for me
Every track is like I'm writin out a eulogy
that I'm dedicatin to the hip-hop community
Tryin to bring back for the acts that influence me
My perfect world is a room full of true emcees
and a few pretty face ladies movin to the beat
But it's hard makin movements in this industry
24/7 grind, even movin in my sleep

[Chorus: Akrobatik]
I can't front, it's easy makin joints from the heart
When every single fuckin thing around you is falling apart
I can't front, it's easy makin joints from the heart
When every single fuckin thing around you is falling apart
I can't front, it's easy makin joints from the heart
When every single fuckin thing around you is falling apart
Falling apart, falling apart
When every single fuckin thing around you is falling apart, c'mon

[Pat G]
It's so loooooud inside my head, so I spaz
Gotta write it down before my sanity crash
No food, no job, baby moms on my ass (damn!)
Time's tickin, but it's tickin too fast
Of course, I wanna be first, but gotta make it last
Brain full of pain, pad's still blank
So my freedom got limits like fish in a tank
Spliff full of stank, hopin I can mellow out
Before I say "FUCK THAT!" and start yellin out
So hard to write a song when your mind's spaced
I wish that you could spend a day in my space!
Trippin over the position life's sitting in (uh-huh)
Wanna quit, but your heart says, "Get it in!"
Evil wanna take over, don't let it win
Word to hip-hop, I'ma rock like setamine, yeah~!

[Chorus]

[Effect]
Yo, they say the ones with the feeling are the easiest songs to write
Pours out of you, when you feel wrong, it's right
Many tired days, sleepless nights
Many struggles with the pen, I gotta fight it to write
'Bout anything other than fightin the fight
Got it worded in a way to make you say, "Tight!"
Cause the songs that I love on all those records you like
are buried at the end, you never heard of 'em, right?
It's alright, had a bad year, made that clear
When I drink away a summer and I chase it with tears
Then pen to release for the whole world to hear
to be asked questions ?Zeta? didn't answer like "Yeah"
Music don't hold the door for me, skip the chivalry
My heir appreciates a coat that's less sugary
And I'll be, the record that you choose the skip through
Cause it's really effortless when I say this to you

[Chorus: now rapped by Effect]</pre>
