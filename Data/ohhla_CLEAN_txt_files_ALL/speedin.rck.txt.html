[Rick Ross]
Legendary, Runners, you know me, o ooooh, o ooooh
Trilla, o ooooh, o ooooh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account
My account can't count up all my money in an hour
Cause it's comin too fast and I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face told her this was her last dance
GOD DAMN speed got my heart racin
See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation
Ceasar salad, Caesars Palace
You not a boss little nigga cause your cheese is average
In the Benz ak ridin shotgun
It's a Benz cause your broke 'til you got one
It ain't nothing do 100 in the maybach
Throwin money out the roof motherfuckin brake pads

[Chorus]
Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, speedin
I'm speedin, I can't stop it's all I know
From a youngin I was taught get doe
I'm speedin, speedin, I'm speedin

[Verse 2]
See people came lookin for me I got ghosts see the west coast 
close and up in the lamontrose
Big money boss major
American idol, I got fans like fantasia
Read between the lines or yo ass like fantasia
Get hit between the eyes he died they can't save him
I'm a mosh I'm weevin no no but I'm speedin
Staring at the skyline I got a million on my mind I'm the best
and these pussy niggas running out of time Ricky Ross
I'm the chill quarter mill for the time piece
Ya I a bought a wheels like deals for the dime piece

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sittin in the living room watching the Grammys
Wishing that was me that was on the Grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me money rain on me
I was a D turmin I'll thirty shows a mill
Homey help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Nap time cause my gift grew wings
And now I'm flying down like the cool crew winds
Kells and ross on the hollywood scene
Red carpet and it's smellin like green
Now foss cause I got paid off collabo'
Was the hit hip-hop and R&amp;B boss

[Chorus]

We fly I think somebody followin we hear the helipad with ya bitch 
You worth fifteen million baby don't try to blow it all in one week
Overseas boss (I'm speedin I'm speedin)
I'm a fly away on you haters
And I came up so fast movies, endorsements, films...
We own things... boss boss boss</pre>
