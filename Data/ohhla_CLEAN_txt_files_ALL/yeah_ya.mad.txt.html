[Intro - Skillz - talking] - w/ ad libs
(I'm just gonna switch up the hit)
(a 1, 2, 3, 4) (just like this)
Y-y-y-yeah (yeah)
Y-y-y-yeah (yeah)
Y-y-y-yeah (yeah)
Y-y-y-yeah (yeah)
New Skillz! (New Skillz! ...)
Ya know (ya know ...)
Ya already know (ya already know)
Okay-player! (player!)

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
You checkin out, one of the baddest that ever did it
I've been told that, so I ain't kiddin
And I trippin, I got what it takes to do it
So I'm a keep makin the music
Ain't too many tracks that I ain't put in flames
Nigga I put a kick and a snare to shame (shame)
You know my name, I know you see
How I make this, look so easy (come on)
Ha, it's in my blood (uh huh), it's in my veins
And I'm a keep it hoppin man, I ain't goin to change (I ain't goin to change)
It's what I do, it's how I live (it's how I live)
And yeah it's a struggle, but it is what it is (it is what it is)
What mine's is mine, what's his is his (his is his)
And yeah I love the music, but I hate the biz (hate the biz)
Cause that's the shit that'll come and ruin it (come and ruin it)
But it's all love when y'all say 'keep doin it'
I ain't goin to stop man

[Chorus - Skillz] - w/ ad libs
Yeah, ya know it, uh huh, yeah ya know it
Uh huh, yeah ya know it
I ain't goin to stop
I'm a keep it hot, ya know it
Uh huh, yeah ya know it
Yeah ya know it
Uh huh, yeah ya know it
Uh huh, yeah ya know it
I ain't goin to stop
I'm a keep it hot, ya know it
Uh huh, yeah ya know it

(Truck North!)

[Verse 2 - Truck North]
Man, it ain't hard for me to spit that raw
Niggaz been gettin served for a decade or more
Non fiction dog, all you got to do is check the stats
All you got to do is check the raps
Yeah, it may look sweet, the grass is green
The flows is hot, the sneakers is clean
It's funny how much folks don't want to see
The gray areas, the in betweens
This shit is a job, just like yours
A means to an end, we don't work for applause
I done been on tour and slept on floors
Carry niggaz' bags, just to leave the war
But I don't bitch, I don't complain
Got to keep playin for the love of the game
And every real baller got to play through pain
The spoils for the winners, so winning's the aim (come on, come on)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Skillz]
I want you to listen and take your time (uh huh)
I want what I say to stick in your mind (preach)
See it's a big world man and that's a fact
There's a billion rappers and a zillion tracks (and a zillion tracks, church)
While we in here, I'm a make it clear (uh huh)
I got love for y'all, appreciate your ear (come on)
I can't keep it locked man, I got to share
So this goes to my fans and all my peers
So keep in mind (uh huh), that in these rhymes (come on)
Are delicate words with intricate designs
It ain't my fault, it's how I was trained
Blame Rakim, blame Big Daddy Kane
See when I go, I go to the limit
I got to leave somethin here when I'm finished
It's all I know, it's where I'm from
And when this done, we startin on another one, huh

[Chorus]</pre>
