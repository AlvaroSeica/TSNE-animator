[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Let's get it pimp (let's get it shawty)
This for all my real players (yeah!)
Sounds so soulful, don't you agree? (ay, what the beat this here?)
I'll tell you what I want you to do (I just touched, t-t-touched, touched down)
If you on your way and you bout to do it big (I just touched, t-t-touched, touched down)
this what you tell 'em shawty!

[Chorus]
I just touched down, aye what it is shawty (yeah!)
I'm going places shawty
I just touched down, aye what it is shawty (yeah!)
I'm going places shawty
I just touched down, aye what it is shawty (yeah!)
I'm going places shawty
I just touched down (just touched, t-t-touched, touched down)
(I just touched, t-t-touched, touched)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I just touched down in my city on chrome
Working wood wheel, from a yellow getting dome
Gators on my toes, love how I'm living
Ay, tell me what I'm doing if I ain't fucking pimping
Getting money, working overtime, supernova shine
Only see a player down and out, ain't no clone in mine, I'm one of a kind
Colder though, make 'em hit the flo', she do what I like
Been doing this since 2005, this ain't overnight
Show you're right, Super-duper Tight, showing bumper grill
Popping trunk, roll it, smoke it up, cracking hella seals
How I feel? Never ever fucking with my level
They be trying, but no one can do it better

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I just got paid, working on a slab
While y'all was watching cartoons, I was beating shaft, acting bad
Swanging lane to lane, dripping candy paint
Ain't no hoe this side of the Mississippi resists my candy thang, fly without a plane
Debonair, throwed without a care, police stop and stare
Toot it up, triple boot it up, pop and lock it there
Drop it there, rock it there, I'm a motivator
Haters best keep walking if it ain't about paper
I'm trill, down like four flat
tires on the cutthroat SS or a Cadillac
See they might have slithered off the syrup, I'm out here sitting King
Out my momma's womb breathing life into this pimping

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
You dealing with a country fly, certified country flow
M-I-crooked letter, the Return of 4Eva hoe
Super-duper clean on the scene, pop my collar back
Product hella fine when rhyme, not selling powder packs
K.R.I.T., P.I.M.P. on you, where my dollars at?
If you ain't bout this vision that I'm kicking then don't holler back
Pimping is my child, stretching out for miles
Street and block approved, I'm a home professional

[Chorus]</pre>
