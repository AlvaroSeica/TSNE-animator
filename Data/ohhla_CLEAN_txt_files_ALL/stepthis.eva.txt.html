Yo, I'm saying though
I can't be holding my tougue like that though dog
You know what I'm saying
A yo, you know what I'm saying
We detonated and all that you know what I'm saying
But yo, this nigga Fakts One got me open
I got to spit some shit
I'm just going to let it loose like yo:

[Verse 1]
Success, I strike gold like Eureka
My rhymes scare niggas they shake like I'm glad to meet ya
Niggas is fake like big screen creatures
I'm dropping this, so return to you lock-ed-ness
Sharpen this shit like flint rock
Stop niggas from reaching the top like "UV-10 Block"
I battle and win lot stuff-em
Niggas get bagged like duffel
I double my dot-com
Shift my whole network reverse through the birth of a pop song
I got stronghold, beyond your means pass the pressure
Too slick to grip to dip to deep measure
Freak for physic pleasure
Spit gems reap treasure
"Breez Evahflow" sleep never
He better speak hot shit
If not when I drop shit evacuate like gasses toxic

[Chorus]
Do you really want it?
Do you really mean it?
{Step this way}
Are you sure?
Have you ever seen it?
{Step this way}
Could it ever happen?
Will you ever be it?
{Step this way}
Do you really want it?
Do you really mean it?

[Verse Two]
I maintain, the same aim, steady precision
Hip-hop collision, sheding light on any hidden proposition
But I'm conditioned for change
Lethal flames and rearrange the molecules in my frame
I'm the insane thinker, calculating the plan
I seen you fall away before you took your fate in your hands
Wouldn't work to leave an airform arm hurt
I bomb earth with song verse that get me dap till my palms hurt
Niggas don't get it, I set it off like seismic sensors
While I drop heavy and hit the Earth's center
Drawbrige lowered for "Stronghold" to enter
Meant to make a "mil", take a little time
Listen to this nigga when he rhymes
Designed by the signs of time
My mind remain refined, all kind of ideas
Couldn't see where we was going now the facts made it clear like

[Chorus]
Do you really want it?
Do you really mean it?
{Step this way}
Are you sure?
Have you ever seen it?
{Step this way}
Could it ever happen?
Will you ever be it?
{Step this way}
Do you really want it?
Do you really mean it?

Stronghold live and direct up in your set  {I told you before}
Stronghold live and direct up in your set  {Brick Fish}
Stronghold live and direct up in your set  {Stronghold}
Stronghold live and direct up in your set  {Wild}

[Verse 3]
Yo I write a regal rhyme, in the length of a legal time
Thoughts sharp like the thorn darts on a lethal vine
Either I'm, out of my mind sound my sick words
"Detenator" shit work, pumping my script
Till you jump on my shit and make my dick hurt
Flirt, pervert, maintian keeping dap on the skirts
Capital birth, real essence entity in the zone
Enterprise, verbal audio home-flown
Leaf takes me up to the Ozone, whoa is the nigga
Who couldn't catch my name in the rhyme I just configured
I'm a trick his breath away from a potent display
Wrote this for days with women wine and poster diplays
But I see rays like "Walz" and saw it like hey
My "Stronghold vocal like a trophy display
Who the fuck goin' approach me today
Mic phone's supposed to decay
Roasting it way more than what's posted and blazed like

[Chorus]
Do you really want it?
Do you really mean it?
{Step this way}
Are you sure?
Have you ever seen it?
{Step this way}
Could it ever happen?
Will you ever be it?
{Step this way}
Do you really want it?
Do you really mean it?

Yeah, Breez Evahflowin'
Detenator Y'all

Fakts One on the incredible</pre>
