Mr. Wall, Evil D
5 FT
No doubt, we gonna hold it down for Brook lon
One time, where you at?
WHAT?
Jerz, Uptown, the Bronx, Queens
Aight?
Hustlers, hardcore, thug shit
No doubt, my peoples locked down, they listenin 5 FT
You got to blaze for them
No doubt, one two, drop
Huh?

[5 FT]
Just be a little something (Uh-Huh)
For those who do not know me
Like I'm a 23 Chicago Bull
You can not hold me
It's as if, tryin to grab a nigga that's smothered on fire
Hot every night, elevation be my sole desire
See my, will and determination is out of this atmosphere
For 25 years, I've sheaded the sweat, blood, plus the tears
Makin me get to a man that walk the surf with no fear
Here come the 5, bringin the bomb introduction
With my team of construction, yes we allways bring destruction
To the enemy (enemy) enemy (enemy) ENEMY
Whether of not you're ready, I'm aimin at you steady
Takin you ignorant niggas strictly out of existence
For instance, you didn't listen, when I said I was not missin
I have to much to achieve, better believe
I got more than a dutch hiddin up my sleeve
Why oh why, niggas always want to try
When they know deep in they heart they not ready to die
Allah, blessed me to have a daughter
Before I walked the path of war that's redder than water

[Heather B]
Five, who you gonna hold it down for?
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz
For all, all, all, all, all ya'll niggaz
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (For all y'all, uh, uh!)
For all y'all niggaz, for all ya'll niggaz
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (For all ya'll)
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz (Holdin it down, no doubt)
Uh huh!

[5 FT]
I dominate any opponent
Enemies don't want it
Especially when I flaunt it
Grab the mic like a ?? and then I bone it
Then I break into a sweat, some kids wreck it
Hit direct, watch and listen as I resurrect
&gt;From your past, surviving life's roughest task
They said I wouldn't last, don't make me laugh
I'm bout to give y'all niggaz, yes a hot flash
Like being branded by hot brass
Like alcohol and fire, hot clash
Now that's a hot ass, that's movin pretty fast
That's about to be deleted from your supportin cast
See, I stand alone in my ???
For dolo
Verbally throwin blows, there's more product then bolo
The Bo knows, how the show gos
When the Five ??? flow gos
In my arena I'm the master of the dojo
You didn't now? Huh! Well I'm tellin ya
And there will be no rebelin against the records I'm sellin ya
That you will live and manifestin it before your eyes
So open the screen hide, high, and recognize
For I shift your lungs to the left and your heart to the other side
3DB, the revolution televised

[Heather B]
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz (Huh?)
For all, all, all, all, all ya'll niggaz (Hustlers)
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (Hardcore)
For all y'all niggaz, for all ya'll niggaz (No doubt)
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (For all ya'll niggaz)
For all y'all niggaz (Huh? What)

[5 FT]
I rep strong for Brook-lon, BROOK-LON
And I moar to any victim of the Oklahoma bomb
Code red danger! Sound the alarm
I'm breakin niggaz down with deep breaths and ??? (Blaze it, blaze it, blaze 
???)
Dislocate any move that's bein made
It's 1998, meanin I gots to get paid
So consider this bum-rush a raid
Situation you just can't evade
Bring it to ya, teach ya every stage
BOOM, 5FT eye to eye Mr. Doom
And between me and you there ain't gone ever be no room
In this galaxy, or universe
Believe it or not you get it first, plus you get it the worse
Without a discount on the hurst
Burst in all up in your mouth, up in your thirst
Time to see you over cursed
With the presence of my comin, like a messiah
Prayin for one to take ya higher, no love is liver
No the whole globe can bare witness and testify
If they want to testify it requirin my full inquire


[Heather B]
Uh! For all y'all, courted on the 1, 2's
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (Got that camera on the board, I 
see it)
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz (No doubt, ha, ha!)
For all, all, all, all, all ya'll niggaz (Locked down)
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz (For the non-knowin, that's how 
we gonna hold it down)
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (Brooklyn)
For all y'all niggaz, for all ya'll niggaz (Jerz, the Bricks)
For all, all, all, all, all y'all niggaz (Peoples out there runnin thick)
For all y'all niggaz, for all y'all niggaz (Mad bent huh?)
