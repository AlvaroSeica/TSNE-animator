Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've got
New sunglasses
And i've got
Backstage passes
For y'all
Girls with fine asses
Yeah oh yeah
Sunshine, girlies and money
What it takes to get me on a roll
Some call me mr. soul

I went to this party
The other night
Said I want to feel
What my brain had felt like
I grabbed my bottle
And I start drinkin' wine
I thought pretty soon
That I would be
Feelin' fine
But no I couldn't get high
Oh no
And then I couldn't get high
Oh no
And then i
Dont know why

Threw down the bottle
And then I whipped out my pipe
Stuffed it full of goodies
And then I gave that shit a light
I huffed and I puffed
Good lord i
Smoked and I choked
I smoking for so long
Until my heart was nearly broke
Because I couldn't get high
Oh no
And then i
Couldn't get high
Oh no
And then i
Try I tried

I threw down the pipe
Just as pissed as I could be
Gobbled down a mound of some
Lsd
I waited and I waited
For my body to zing
I waited I waited
But not a fucking thing
Because I couldn't get high
Oh no
And then i
Couldn't get high
Oh no
Lord i
Dont know why</pre>
