[Braintax]
You won't catch me on commuter trains at half past 8
I freeline at half 9 and I'm still not late
You'll never see me after work pouring money down my throat
Talking shit, gaining weight, for the sake of a joke
Or with the other suits in the gents hittin' the coke
I like a smoke but I always keep an eye on my notes
Yeah you can call me self-righteous but I'll never lose hope
You'll never see me 9 to 5 getting over to cope
Not a typical life, I dream wilderness ways
I resisted being villanious back in the days
I was the one, seen my friends twocking for fun
Ripping car radios out then...run!
I'm up the ginnel quicker than the rest because I didn't smoke
Full belt round the corner, shit! this is no joke
Heard the helicopter buzzing overhead it's
Time for me to be out, time to get selfish
I can't be getting nicked for what someone else did
Blended with the bushes till shadows melted
And when the sun came up it was less hot
Stepped off down the cobblestones at a trot
I'm off to write rhymes, and I made the right choice
And I know a lot of people take issue with my voice
Even though we're al equal i'll be makin' my cream
Fuck a British state mind and the American dram... .

It's peer pressure
You make your own mistakes
But don't drag me in, I'm tryin' to elevate

Course I ain't happy 'bout what's happenin' now
Stuff ain't goin too well for you so now you're dragging me down
And that is just foul so play fair, stop acting like you don't know
My struggle in this jungle is just standing on my own toes
And most won't accept the fact that times are hard
I say they..kinda are but still life is large
And I'm planning to make it big to you know - rhyme with stars
And have major companies bidding for me buying me cars
Be in my own show pedalling across the Earth
People I don't know begging me to drop a verse
'But what's this worth?' you ask, I say not everything mate
But it's where I'm tryin' to be at so don't get in my way
Just stay in your place
don't grab on me when problems are invading your space
Cos as for me blood if I make a mistake
I've only myself to blame plus I've dealt with pain
And the sunny side's always better when you've felt the pain
So deal with it - your umbrella is your metal state
I can't be the only one that's keeping my friends awake
And I know you ain't told me everything you meant to say
But we can set things straight cos that was yesterday
And day out and day in you might notice all these strange things
But realize I'm going through the same thing
The art from the start is maintaining and training your brain
And of course like they say with no pain there's no gaining..

It's peer pressure
You make your own mistakes
But don't drag me, I'm tryin' to elevate</pre>
