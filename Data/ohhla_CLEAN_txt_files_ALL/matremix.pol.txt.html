[Young Mav]		
I don't do it all, but I do the most
My fans speak for me but I love to boast
Cause the Mavs keep making it, DJ's stay playing it
Y'all imitate it, then try to retail it
Urrrrrhhhhhh, stop right thurr
All these rhyme biters will I find a curr
Cause dudes steady hollering they in the building
But since we own the building that makes you the tenants

[K-Riz]		
Give me the beat man, and watch what I do with it
Never pre-planned, please stand stick like glue wit it
You better get used to us spitting on this thug music
Too sick for y'all, my clique too thick to fall
Mister Rodrigo we blister and scar people
Hit you the God's evil and twist you in small pieces
Look it's our time niggaz move over to the side
Cause if niggaz collide then somebody gotta die

[Chorus  2X]
One, for the Mavericks Team
One Love, for my man's may he rest in peace
One, for my dog out hustling
One Blood
One Clique
One Fam
One Dream

[Dirt Gritie]		
Godzilla, strong arm a fella
The fire spiting heathen breathing death into your villa
The Prime Minister, the eight bars are murder rhyme killer
The ox lifter, the hot shoot trigga nigga 
The middleman, enigma but they call me riddle man
The ill flower, trophy holder,
Artist and an owner, composer
Decompose your style, when fucking with the MFM staff

[Sly Slivers]		
It seems these wack rappers wanna come at the Mavs
Till I body their careers and drive off in a cab
I'm like Tom Cruise, y'all bound to lose
Assassinate you lyrically then clown your crew
Slivers, I'm the one man who is you
You cowards all scared cause the sound is new
Western Union, we coming out
Best to cherish your time cause it's running out

[Chorus  2X]
One, for the Mavericks Team
One Love, for my man's may he rest in peace
One, for my dog out hustling
One Blood
One Clique
One Fam
One Dream

[Billy Blitz]	
Yo it's child's play the way I slay heads like Chucky

[Bigga Nolte]
Get sliced seven times, that's how you stay lucky
You best duck me, the gun ready to buck, so

[Billy Blitz]
Duck from shrapnel and hollow points
Lock &amp; Load, cock and explode from hollow points

[Bigga Nolte]
You get hollow points, cause I'm more than deadly
The glock heavy and you still ain't ready

[Billy Blitz]
I'm a snap, crackle, pop yo neck
Put your bitch back in check, I pop her neck

[Bigga Nolte]
Then I pop of next cause I'm getting' mad vexed
Now I'm holding on my chest and I'm screaming out west side

[Billy Blitz]
West ender defender
Beat you till your face feels tender

[Bigga Nolte]
Cause these felons bust melons
Treat your CDs like Krilin, destruct your disc
Run up on you fake MCs and bust your lip

[Chorus  2X]
One, for the Mavericks Team
One Love, for my man's may he rest in peace
One, for my dog out hustling
One Blood
One Clique
One Fam
One Dream

[Oozeela]	
I will remain Canada's #1 contend'ah
Di Dancehall King, everybody fi rememba
I will remain a Dominican raised gangsta
Di question dem a send Oozeela born fi answer
I will remain the most wile out entertain'ah
Top of di toppa toppa send di girls dem insane
Forget all of the chattin' and yappin' if nothing haffi happen
Music For Mavericks send them packing Oozeela, Bin Laden</pre>
