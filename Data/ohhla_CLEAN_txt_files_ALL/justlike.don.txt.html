[Don Cisco]
(Verse 1)
You wanna know why I
Ride or die for this west coast turf
From Sacra
San Diego, homeboys put in work
California soldiers
We was born to ball
It's like L.A.
And the Bay
Is the heart of it all
Pump the blood of an Aztec
Mean mug, not a plastic
What's up homie
Fire up, let's get blasted
Flash on the pass, homie, you ain't know
California
Used to be
Mexico
Now check the Spanish surnames or the cities to claim
Los Angeles and San Fransisco
All the same
It's the
Golden State of California
Baby, baby
Fore you hate on us
We gotta warn ya
Mexican's Cali's biggest
Minority
In the millenium, eventually
Will the majority
Take a look around you, the world is a barrio
And everybody's lowridin' like they on a way to a
Car show

Break 1:
[Don Cisco] California
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] In Phoenix, Arizona (That's right)
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] Denver, Colorado
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] In Houston, Texas, boy
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico

(Verse 2)
I took a trip to the city of bright lights, Las Vegas
I'm sittin' at the crap table
Full of players
High rollers
Latin ballers and money makers
Super models with full (???), that's how I break it
The title taker
From the streets to the skyscraper
From 'Frisco to Phoenix, AZ
We chase paper
Every city I go
I see some homies dippin' low-low's
T-shirts, khakis
Bald-headed locos
I went to Utah
Salt Lake City
Did a show for Cinco De Mayo and see so many heinas
Lookin' pretty
I heard they got Chicanos
In Chicago
Doin' they thug thang, go 'head, hermano
Everybody ballin' clavo
From Houston, Texas
To Denver, Colorado
We lowridin' in a Lexus on a way to a
Car show
The Southwest
Is just like Mexico

Break 2:
[Don Cisco] Utah
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] In Nevada, boy
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] You know Texas
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] In Colorado
       Oh yeah
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico

[Don Cisco]
Yeah, I ain't been around the world
But now, everywhere I look
I see homies
So what's up

(Verse 3)
Now we up in Dallas
With some stallions
Hanging on me at the bar like medallions
Every barrio I go out
Fits right in
Cause everywhere that I look, I see, Mexicans
Cara mia
Down for raza like Pancho Villa
Mi casa's tu casa, drink shots of tequila
Puerto Ricans got New York
And the Cubans got Florida
But it's just like Mexico
When you live in California

Break 3:
[Don Cisco] San Antonia
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] In Albequerque, New Mexico, boy
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] And San Diego
       Oh yeah
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico
[Don Cisco] Los Angeles
[Crew]      Is just like Mexico

[Don Cisco]

The Bay Area
Hun
Just like Mexico...</pre>
