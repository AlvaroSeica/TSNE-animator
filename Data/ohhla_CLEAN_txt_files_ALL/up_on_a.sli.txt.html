Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now baby, give me loving, give it to me in the morning light
Now, some more loving then we gon sleep tonight
She said, together we will be all right, and that we one in a billion

I'm gonna love you, but you really need to understand
If I'm your lover I'm your one-woman man
Don't need no loving and I'm run from here to Japan
And then, and all I want is my girlfriend

Up on a plane and I'm going to a foreign land
I know, Jamaica then we go to Japan
She's singing, when-a, when-a will you be back agian?
No, and that she can't take the pressure, love

I gonna love her, give it to her in the morning light
Now, some more loving then we gon sleep tonight
She said, together we will be all right, and that we one in a million

I'm gonna love you, but you really need to understand
That I'm your lover and your one-woman man

Don't need no loving and I'm run from here to Japan, girl
And all I want is my girlfriend

Up on a plane and I'm going to a foreign land
I know, Jamaica then we going to Japan
She's singing, when-a will you be back again?
No, and that she can't take the pressure, love

And then we one in a million

I'm gonna love you, but you really need to understand
That I'm your lover and your one-woman man
Don't need no loving and I'm run from here to Japan, girl
And all I want is my girlfriend

Up on a plane and I'm going to a foreign land
I know, Jamaica then we going to Japan
She's singing, when-a will you be back again?
No, and that she can't take the pressure, love
Can't take the pressure, love
Can't take the pressure, love</pre>
