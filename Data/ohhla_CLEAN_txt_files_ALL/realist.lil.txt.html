[Intro]
Man this the real shit
This the only real motherfucker you want to hear on this man
Like I said when I get on these beats they be done RIP

[Verse]
I don't stay schemin
I stay with the demons
Stay bringing hell
There's gone be problems this season
If you niggas don't pass it
I don't want to play even
Even though I got honor
Honor don't stop drama
So I'm strapped up
Even put in my pajamas
Take 'em up top and feed em to the piranhas
You niggas all fake that's word to Obama
... It's Lil B... (yes)
But I give you niggas 20 shots
They fuck with the basedgod
They love me like 2Pac
I'm from the hood so the roof drop
I'm starving like Africans
The gun that I tote you won't come back again
Niggas love clothes that's why they stay on t-shirts
I almost murdered last year the stress got my knees hurting
I damn near got an ulcer from the closeup
Back 'em like coke up
Direct 'em like a chauffeur
Put this on your tongue
We gone hit the boss station
Already took a case
Alameda not playing
If you choke your thug route
Do your time and do whatever
Like rehabilitation jail made me better
Facing 36 made me feel like whatever
When I bounce back from that ain't know one better
It was a murderers, it was a rapist sitting beside me
Had to step my life up cause jail wouldn't defy me
Your a grown ass man why you on ankle monitor boy
Man you think that shit cool, that's just too much drama
And I keep the gun close like tools to a farmer
Got my bulletproof vest bitch I stay with the armor
And I don't give a fuck about karma
You gone get dealt with
Leave you dead in yo house
And nobody even smell shit
I fuck with them st killas
That will leave you on yo back
No jetskis nigga Lil B back
And I'll hit you with the mack
Leave yo ass flat
Basedworld: Protect Lil B Protect Basedgod
