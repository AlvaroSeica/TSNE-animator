[ DH ]
Man, a motherfucker's sick fuckin with a tramp bitch
Hoe ( ? ) for the next motherfucker's dick?
I ain't the one, two, three or the fo'
So bitch, break your knuckles when your at DH's do'
Oh, you in the house to fuck?
Open up your mouth and suck
If you're tryina get paid, bitch, good luck
Man Mike what's wrong?
Man, the bitch is gone
I mean the cock is weak, but the head is real strong
Tramp bitch
This ain't no love triangle
But I'ma let my nuts dangle
So don't violate or I'ma prosecute
I'm treatin you tramp bitches like prostitutes
Tramp bitch, and that's the truth
Tramp bitch, it's Potna Deuce

[ VERSE 1: Beesh ]
Now I'm tryina get paid in the large way
I want the real butter bitch, not the Parkay
Somebody holdin on to my pocket, that's for sho'
But catch a motherfuckin bo' as I keep my playa stroll
Intact, in fact I gotta get back ta
My people so that Beesh can act a
Fool ( ? ) with my folks on tilt
Where the money is my honey and the cock is killed
So tramp bitch, it's stage left when I'm wild and loose
I'm doin damage to the bush like child abuse
And I got a message for the playa-hatin crew
Grab a dick, start smokin up the root
I got your bitch and your bitch's friend ridin my draws
Sugar walls for my donkey balls
But don't trip cause I'm hittin 'em swell
On top of that I'm full of dank, now I think it's time to bail
Out playa life is all about
Get the money, get the women, have all the clout
So make way for them swingin motherfuckers from the town of the V
You fuckin around with me
You fuck around with the c-r-e-w
Bringin trouble to my foes
I'm checkin sucker fuckin punk hoes
Like that cooley cool and I'm cool
So tramp bitches in the house, man, fuck you

[ VERSE 2: Rube ]
I talks bad, way bad about a silly tramp bitch
And you know I can't switch
Comin like this cause I gives a bitch naythin
Dogs like me hoes never had faith in
Ass, hip, rim, cool, I'm at her
I told you befo' man, titties don't matter
And if a bitch keep on snoopin Rube
I be diggin all up in them fallopian tubes
It's so true, I gots no affection after the sexin
It's a fact, I can't be goin bare back
Nowadays hoes pack nothin but luggage
And still be tryina talk a lotta rubbish
So fuck a dumb tramp and that shitty bitch
I'ma try to get her 450 licks
Stick my dick in between her big lips
Bust a fat nut and then split
Cause it's on to the fullest extent
I only fuck tramps when I'm bent just to block the scent
Keep her on gurpin till she hurtin, say later bitch
Kick back, get tacked and eat potato chips
You gets no respect from me, troop
Fuck you, it's from my whole damn group
Done fucked half them niggaz I grew up with
So I won't hesitate to call you a bitch

[ VERSE 3: Chezski ]
I should be grippin yak from the dark hook
And beat up on the dug-out till it's all shook
And one day if the wild thing's hit and used
Gripped a little rough when they swingin with Potna Deuce
Tell me what the little house is hittin foe' ( ? )
Tramp bitches duckin from the Gut Runna Killa
Still a got ajar with a slim jammy
Far from a ( ? ) you was flammy
Tramp bitch knows about the late night jingle
I'm perved and I wanna feel the pipe shake and tingle
Took her to the spot and all the fabric gets peeled
The bitch got me stunned, sinkin straight for the tilt
First I gotta hold and show the tramp all the skills
Clench to the couch, wantin only cheap thrills
Doggy dirty dick 'em from the back, dude
Arms in the air, talkin dirty gettin way rude
And grip daddy's found up at the frontline
Hoggin on a pocket little somethin for the second time
It keeps poppin fast till they straight get her
Batter up, bitch, with your designated hitter
He gives it right back like a player should
And all the time she's thinkin to herself that it's all good
Hmmmm and I never want 'em
I'm Chezski the champ puttin thangs on 'em

[ DH ]
Haha
Now y'all know
A tramp bitch is just another tramp, stank-ass hoe
Tramp bitch
(That's how you feel about a bitch?)
That's the only way I can feel about a tramp bitch right about now
Never loved 'em
