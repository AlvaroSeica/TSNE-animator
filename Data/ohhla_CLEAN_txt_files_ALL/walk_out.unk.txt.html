Ayyyyyyyyyyyy!
Now walk it out (now walk it out) now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out) now walk it out
Westside walk it out (Westside walk it out)
Southside walk it out (Southside walk it out)
Eastside walk it out (Eastside walk it out)
Northside walk it out (Northside walk it out)
Now here we go

[Chorus]
Now walk it out (now walk it out) now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out) now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now Westside walk it out (now Westside walk it out)
Now Southside walk it out (now Southside walk it out)
Eastside walk it out (Eastside walk it out)
Northside walk it out (Northside walk it out)

[Unk]
Now hit the danceflo', and then ya back low
She do it with no hands, now stop pop and roll
I'm smokin bubble hoe, yeah dey in trouble hoe
I like the way she move, an undercover hoe
Now everybody leanin, I made the crowd rock
Now 'gwan and walk it out, I see they on my jock
She want that bubblegum, is they the Doublemint Twins?
Two hoes choosin me, so I know that I'ma win
It's on once again, Patron once again
I threw my hair back, then I froze like the wind
Westside walk it out (Westside walk it out)
Southside walk it out (Southside walk it out)
Eastside walk it out (Eastside walk it out)
Northside walk it out (Northside walk it out)

[Chorus] - 2X

[Unk]
They walk it on the East, they walk it on the West
The Southside just got it, Northside stuck in it
In the club, on the deuce, big stacks no flex
These suckers wanna try me tell 'em tool on deck
He walkin in his one steady smokin on fruits
She walk in with a friend, all in her snow boots
So SHIT~! Dere dey go (hey) they walk it on the flo'
Grey Goose, double shots, it'll let your body go
My niggaz on my side, haters hate, think it's funny
I walked it on these niggaz now I'm gettin to my money
Froze on them hoes, I'm not talkin 'bout dancin
Hoe count 'pon the charm, diamonds steady stead' enhancin

[Chorus]

[Unk]
Okay now do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Okay, do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Ayyyyyyyyyyyy~!</pre>
