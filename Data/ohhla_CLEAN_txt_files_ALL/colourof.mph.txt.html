"Take a bit of sophistication, add a dash of suppressed anger,
and mix it all with just the right amount fu-fu-funk. Smell good? You bet"

You can all burn in hell
Burn baby, burn in hell
Huh

[Verse 1]
I see these species leak these needy habits
With their weak knees, seedy, greasy ladders
Can't quite climb, freezing the seize in the status
No reason when they're reading the passage
What matters gets no practice
Stop the chatterbox, let go with a panic
They're so dramatic with their outcry
Their downtime crossing way over the foul line
Our time is right now, despite that rise in your eyebrow
Lights out, pitch black, to sit back, chit chat - no Time Out
Kit Kat, we live that, bring back the wide mouth
Torture for the truth, the author cornered in the booth
Could have sworn you forced a few - rawkus views
On the bystanders but its seeming even they're bored of you
You're talking to the boiling blood, you're just a sub par mud-bath flow
Run hard till your lungs part one star quotes
Speech bubble pops to the mirage of fast cars
Choke on the breathing while dreaming this evening
Your muddling mind provides a glide to these Chinese whispers
And windy rivers, teach on a cold chill
Just biting the business, of the finest scriptures
I'm inviting a distance to put you in the final position
Your vinyl is skipping like a little girl with braids
We ain't even close to the same page
Your brainwave bumps to the sound and gossips
I suppose you've found the bottom
Where the rocks and sticks lay
I spent lunchtime sitting in the sickbay
Switchblade craving the skin, embracing the sin
Feel my patience decaying so thin
And we all reach a point where the mind caves in
When the mind caves in

[Hook - X2]
And I'm sick of this, I'm tired mate
I've had enough of you and your ugly face
You want to see me break, I want to watch you leave
Trust, such a waste, give me space to breathe

[Scratches]
