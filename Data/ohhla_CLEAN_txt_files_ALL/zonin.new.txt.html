Like damn I don't really like to argue
Think it's pointless, but you like to start to
Like I heard this, she said that
And then my friends told me they must be facts
Here we go with this stuff again
How you just met these girls and trustin them?
And she put it on me, screamin so loud
That I'm left with no choice but to tune her out
(You stupid motherf...) I love you too
You workin out girl? I love them shoes!
Yell all you want to, if that's what you do
Plus I like when you're mad, I think its so cute
I shut her up by the compliments
That's literally the only way I can top the fits
So every time she start yellin In here
I close my eyes and put my hands on my ears like...

[Chorus]
Na na na, say what? Na na na I can't hear you!
Na na na what's that? Na na na I can't hear you!
I swear it's like, like you talkin' to a wall
Cause I ain't listen to you at all
But you keep tryna talk talk talk, but wah wah wah
But talk all the shit you want, I be zonin' you out

[Hook]
Same ol' brand new station, I ain't listenin', I be zonin' you out
You talking like it's the end of the world
When you ain't got shit to say, I be zonin'
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out
Out my ear, I be zonin', out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out

[Ben J]
Damn get out my ear though
Got these old folks lookin at us like weirdos
Can we just sit and talk about it?
Instead of you tryna tell ya pops about it
You don't need to go that far, it's just me and you
Your daddy too old what that nigga gon' do?
Oops my bad, you know I ain't mean it
What I'm tryna say is we need to quit beefin
She smiled at me and said "You're right
But who was that girl you was with last night?"
She started going off like burnt lights
At this rate we gon' never work right
That's when I planned somethin different
The only way to deal with her is to not listen
So I put my hands on my ears till she stopped trippin like

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Legacy]
Seem like all you want is for me to hear your voice
Even if all the things you say is true, there's still no point
For you to be trippin' like you are, it ain't that bad
I even left my ex-girl for you, and she ain't that mad
Here we go again, here we go again with same damn arguin
I don't know the chick, I don't know the chick
Will you please get off my ear
Think about all the times you found out a lie just to bring you down
You're way too loud, if you gon' try and shout, then I'll be zonin' you out like

[Chorus]
