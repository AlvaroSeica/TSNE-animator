[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Bang back on them homie, better get your cash on
Real city to my block homie, better get your mash on
Every second's a dollar shorty my time costs
Now you know you in the presence of a real boss
Makavelli trained yeah, military minded
My hustle is immaculate, my music is timeless
Passport player been around the world a couple times
Show you how to make a couple million of a couple rhymes
Up in vip, one deep with a couple dimes
Outside my young niggas posted with a couple nines
Don't be blinded by the smoke and all the mirrors
Just stay focused on the realness we give hope to ghetto children
Look, bang back, they can dish it out then they can take that
Black cloud over your head, it's hard to shake that
Everytime I spit it's similar to grade A crack
Outlawz and Cobra, the haters sure to hate that!

[Chorus: Spittin Cobra &amp; Outlawz](x2)
Bang Back, they ask for it, bang back, we mash for it
I'm just hoping it's worth it and you got your cash for it
Bang back, they ask for it, bang back, we mash on them
We mash on them, ain't no reversing, we going fast forward

[Verse 2: Spittin Cobra]
Yeah I sharpened my blade in the darkest day
I'm ready for war (ready for war)
My rage in a cage, I'm bout to unleash it
Can't take it no more (can't take it no more)
You fakers and haters are what I deplore
Community unity, something I swore
The pain of my people is deep in my core
Let's settle the score!
Coming to kick in the door
The government give to the rich and they killing the poor
So fuck justice! That blind bitch is just a morbid whore
But Imma keep getting this money
You can't take it from me, sonny, caus we pimpin the system
Keep it on the low low, say no to popo
The way I be living but Imma never be a victim
Mind of an Outlaw, let the gat draw
Left hook southpaw, get a cracked jaw
Real city raised, hell yeah I'm that raw
Up and comin but I cut'em like a hacksaw
Spittin Cobra, someone you can never diss
Meticulous lyricist, better never get me pissed
Venomous nemesis and I never miss
With a flow so sick that I need a therapist
Sour mash Tennessee, Hennessy and gin
Let them be the remedy for my life of sin
Caus money and hoes make foes out of friends so tell me who's real?
Who's down till the end?
I don't really know but soon we goin see
So we keep on fightin till we all free
O.U.T.L.A.W.Z. , United Minorities, we RBG!

[Chorus: Spittin Cobra &amp; Outlawz](x2)
Bang Back, they ask for it, bang back, we mash for it
I'm just hoping it's worth it and you got your cash for it.
Bang back, they ask for it, bang back, we mash on them
We mash on them, ain't no reversing, we going fast forward

[Verse 3. EDI]
It's like a jungle out here sometimes I wonder
Do these smiling faces really got love or do they want me under?
The jail is some dirt, they scared of the work
Fuck what you heard, I've seen worse
They holla church when they see me coming through
Outlaw initiated, pussy niggas can't fade it
Mobbin up in your hood, even though I ain't from there
My track record and face card help me get more love there
Kickin it with the thugs there, I tell them they can do it to
He inspired so we tried, now they getting money too
It's just how we do, they feds don't love it though (they don't know)
It's legal money fool, eat a dick slow!
Better get low when we hit the corner
Made nigga mafia, death before dishonour
Better get low when we hit the corner
Ain't no stopping us, put that on my momma, pussy nigga!

[Chorus: Spittin Cobra &amp; Outlawz](x2)
Bang Back, they ask for it, bang back, we mash for it
I'm just hoping it's worth it and you got your cash for it
Bang back, they ask for it, bang back, we mash on them
We mash on them, ain't no reversing, we going fast forward

[Outro: Spittin Cobra]
Yeah Spittin Cobra, Outlawz
One world, one nation
Bang Back at the system, chyea</pre>
