uh where we headed?
everything is everything.  and I am

given a push, I issue forth my blood ritual
livin here on earth as an individual
first it gets better than it gets worse
and then you develop an incredible thirst
its up to you, the way in which you choose to quench it
and eventually it'll be an extension of yourself
so, it is an imperative that you love yourself
and let everyone else know
hang out your hang ups to dry
for these are merely barriers between you and i
first when we immersed in the curse we self inflict
and dwell in a pit of an intangible element
called fear, this really doesnt exist
it eludes insues the need to know the reason that
we're all here, the gist of your relationship
to creation gets ya trippin in amazement
YOU, builder of galaxies, are the architect of
the fallacies your thoughts project
and now it seems, like your stuck to the ground
and bound by your body but
listen to the sound of life

CHORUS
the most creative force in the universe is us
so just stay on course
listen to the song of the stars
harmonious brilliance we are
the filiments of this
(scratching)

ahhh, and the walls come tumbling down
the feeling is awesome revealing what's going around
inside your guts
yeah emotional outbursts don't
keep it a secret no more scream and shout curse
holler and throw fits whatever floats your boat
we livin in a tumultuous culture don't
overdose on reality cuz the way it seems
ain't always how it be
obey your dream and get open than a motherfucker
we ain't trippin, I hop skip and I jump
to deliver the shipments and pump
true facts no time to pass judgements
i leave it to the hypercritical to do that
liberation, starts in the hearts of individuals
and it sparks the inner darkness given a signal
to embark upon, thoughts that spawn a new beginning
and ?begin to form?
all for one common cause
place in space and moment in time
only inclined to face the divine
reflection of perfection stretched around the most profound
connection would like to sound

CHORUS 2x
the most creative force in the universe is us
so just stay on course
listen to the song of the stars
harmonious brilliance we are
the filiments of this
(scratching)

i'm up til all hours of night
grifting up my thoughts to illustrate eternity
with the real estate of space
the embrace of grace gets me wisked away
in an nifty uplifting way
drifting away and if things actually ring true
then I think the ???? readily
practicing for the act of scene two
fifth dimensional shift and didnt you know
who the fuck I was with?  heiroglyphics
mythics of thought methods, measured and compressed
to rip shit apart, effortless a gobbley goop
a slop of mess change is comin
oh my god stop the press
rearrangments of a mixed proportion
put love in the mix and you won't need governments
illuminature, human nature
or each one of your days will be like euthinasia
see death is imminent
when you forget that life is unlimited
remember its your burning cinder
thats stretched around
the most profound connection would like to sound

CHORUS fades til end
the most creative force in the universe is us
so just stay on course
listen to the song of the stars
harmonious brilliance we are
the filiments of this
