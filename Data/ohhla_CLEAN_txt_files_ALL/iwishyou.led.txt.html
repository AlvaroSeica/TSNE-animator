DJ KHALED!!!! Ya boy
I'm so serious!!

[Kanye West] + (DJ Khaled)
One, two them boys comin for you
Three, four better lock your door
Five, six - hide yo' bitch
(Aiyyo Yeezy, pop your shit)

[Kanye West]
They said thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggaz sellin packs, niggaz flippin pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggaz high for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggaz really is out here, these niggaz really is out here
The block is at war, post-traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggaz gettin bust over In Gods We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozin, we forget that we the chosen
I've been poppin shit for too long
But still reppin where I came from
I guess it's how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga {*2X*}
I guess it's how I came up; I wish you would try to play us

[Rick Ross]
{Maybach Music!} My money on a another level
In the streets I hear 'em hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5 make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly them niggaz lame, where your fuckin cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fuckin letters
Fuck niggaz fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I'm at the fight, ringside right next to promoters
All my niggaz still hustle, consider 'em roguish
I remember catchin buses, just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggaz you quotin
Hun, my corner will scorch ya somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
+God Forgives+ and +I Don't+; pussy niggaz on notice

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
You see you got a couple cases still look good nigga
You see these niggaz they try to play ya, know your field nigga
And yup - that'd be the day you wanna kill a nigga
But you gon' chill nigga, just for yo' kids nigga
Cause now there's kids doin grown man biz nigga
You just got home nigga, you tryin to live nigga
Me I don't wanna do another five years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass, the feds'll question yo ass
They be drug testin yo ass, and then they pray you don't pass
And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the Tech and the Mac
Cause they've been poppin shit for too long
Still reppin where I came from
I guess it's how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
RO-ZAY!!</pre>
