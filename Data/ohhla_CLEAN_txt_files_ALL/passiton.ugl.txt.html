Pass it on!

[Dizzy Dustin]
Many years ago, I was ten years old
We used to play a game that you all should know
It's really very simple, in the form of a song
Just say a couple lines then pass it on

[Andy Cooper]
Here we go
Eenie-meanie-weenie, pa-pa-ooh-mou-mou
I can't wait for later, got to get down now
A pow wow with my Injuns, I got thin shins
And feet so big they look like swim fins

[Dizzy Dustin]
I'm going down in history
With a bad attitude like Mr. T
So I "Pity the fool" that would get with me
And when my money's gone, I'll pawn my jewelry

[Andy Cooper]
On I'm fire like a bonfire, making you melt
Yell help and I'll grab my utility belt
I'm delicious and nutritious like a toasted oat
And if you forget, I left you a Post-it note

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
Yeah, I'll put the flame on the batter till it's chicken fried
Well, I'm never watered down like a Slip 'n Slide
You didn't know, (Go ask you mom)
{What did you say?} pass it on

[Chorus]
(Pass it on)
Pass it on, pass it on
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on
(What did you say?) pass it on

[Andy Cooper]
I got my girl a glass of milk and an Oreo
Told her that I really wanna be her Romeo
Wrote her a letter from Albuquerque, New Mexico
With an X and O, and an X and O

[Dizzy Dustin]
If you're a fat girl who does step aerobics
Or a rave chick who holds up the glowsticks
I wanna move from my bachelor pad
And settle down like a sitcom actor dad

[Andy Cooper]
Man, I made plans to build the next Graceland
Get fat and expand my waistband
Save the weight loss, great for Kate Moss
More potatoes and please pass the steak sauce

[Dizzy Dustin]
I move fast so I'm hard to hit
Like a seven ten split as I laugh and sit
On a limb with a grin like Cheshire Cat
You caught the slingshot, I laugh and fire back

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
I gotta get away and leave all my pet peeves
(Finish up and we're out like "Check please!")
Before we go, (If you wanna sing along)
Everybody c'mon and say pass it on

[Chorus]
(Pass it on!)
Pass it on, pass it on
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on
(What did you say?) Pass it on

*Young Einstein scratches and cuts*
Pass it on, pass it on
(Listen close) Pass it on, pass it on
Pass it on, pass it on</pre>
