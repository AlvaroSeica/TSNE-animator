[Verse One: Ice-T]
Midnight, chilling in A.M.P.M.
Cooling drinking apple juice, in Evil's BM
The sound is up loud to attract the tension
Armored raw tires on a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with Alpine deck was glowing
Bumping Big Daddy, that nigga was definitely flowing
I was riding shotgun, Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint, recognized the jack
Two brothers strolled up, talking about get out
Donald D blazed, shot the fool through his fucking mouth
Why would they step, when they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A. without a gat in my lap
The other fool was shot, caught the E in the shoulder plate
I've busted through the car door, that's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out, dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleeding bad, the car seats were turning red
Looked to my left, there were two more carloads
Niggaz in hats and hoods, in an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas, it was one past midnight!

Listen to my Nine millimeter goes BANG!! ---------&gt; KRS-One
Ready or not we have to.. South Central ----------&gt; Ice-T

[Ice-T]
Yo E, drive drive man, just drive man
FUCK IT! just get the FUCK out of here, man

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
We boned down Vernon and made a right on Normandy
Left on Florence, checking through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont, made a left on Golden, right on Hoover
E where we going? - he didn't even answer that
Checked the rearview, they were still out back
Where were these brothers from? - what made these brothers come?
Bang! our back window was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot, Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill, they didn't come to play
Bust a right turn parking, then we got left
Hid in the bushes, shot a gas tank to fake death
But would this really keep them psyched?
Three of us bleeding, it was ten past midnight!

Mid night, time for the homicide, South Central ----------&gt; Ice-T

[Ice-T]
Come on man, y'all bleeding bad man
You got to keep up man, we can't stop here

Listen to my Nine millimeter goes BANG!! ---------&gt; KRS-One

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I really didn't like how this shit was going down
Wrong night, wrong time, wrong fucking part of town
You see, we was deep in the Hoover's hood
Three niggaz bleeding, that shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go, some places red's all they know
But not our luck, tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley, and we instantly had to duck
Fuck the Police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with One Time, so we had to creep
Broke through a back yard, ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up, to be some niggaz shot
Shit was getting crazy so I had to get busy
Hen was bleeding worse, and Evil was getting dizzy
Looked in the parking lot, I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire, so I moved on an old car
It was a Bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up and scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later we saw fucking blue lights
The pigs were behind us, it was half past midnight!

[Ice-T]
Y'all just lay down on the floor of this car man
FUCK! the Police man, I'ma handle this man

Listen to my Nine millimeter goes BANG!! ---------&gt; KRS-One

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
When they pulled us over shit got worse
I've waited til they got out, and then I hit reverse
Fucked them up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm Audi y'all
Don't know how, but somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops dumped the G.T.A.
Made it back to the hood, fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinking about my all-night death bout
Then something woke me up from my dark sleep
The sound of fucking police, when they're trying to creep
Broke through my door with no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch, it was six in the morning!</pre>
