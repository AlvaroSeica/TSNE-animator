[BIG WY]
Dear mama
I've never spoke out holdin' on the pride
But I feel it's time to realese this pain inside
It was never a moment I didn't feel you love me
I just didn't want crack to take my mamma from me
I know it was rough, me and you at home
A young single mother with a son at home
With all the constant pressure
I've seen the scenery
But I just try my best to show what you mean to me
It helped me through it all, when my heart was torn
Cause I was in the jail the night to see my daughter born
I've learned a lot mama, turned my life around
I'm on with Dogg got some bomb we like brothers now
Thanks for prayin' for me, blessin' from me and my girl
And a character just like me I wanna give you the world
I just wanna thank you mama, for times you talked to me
I gave my hands to God and now he walkin' with me

Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder
Thinkin' about doin' right
Steady doin' wrong, who's right? Who's wrong?
Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder
Thinkin' about doin' right
Steady doin' wrong, who's right? Who's wrong?

[SIXX NINE OF 6 FEET DEEP]
Me and you was only 22
I remember like yesterday all the stupid things we used to get into
I mean mama had the hard times controllin' us
But that couldn't stop the state from parolin' us, we on the streets
Me and you - they saw me they saw you (together)
My younger brother we was closer then 1 &amp; 2 (that's for real)
That's why I can believe she had ?? to do it
Mama caught us and you died at the trauma unit
It's a cold world and it's gettin' colder
Lookin' over my shoulder
I keep thinkin' you gon' walk thru the door everyday now
And it was a bad dream when I saw you puttin' in the ground
But I shake it off
Got to keep it poppin'
I'm makin' beats now got the whole world jockin'
But I trade all the money in the world
Just for you to spend one day playin' with your baby girl

Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder
Thinkin' about doin' right
Steady doin' wrong, who's right? Who's wrong?
Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder
Thinkin' about doin' right
Steady doin' wrong, who's right? Who's wrong?

[SUGA BUGA]
We used to go half on tapes
And kept card
Drive down the 'Shaw
Get at broads
Steady goin' my nigga
I miss you
To the point
I got to write a song my nigga
We cool homie (yeah)
Big Wy fresh out
?? just time for
He in school homie
And ?Luis? got a daughter
She looks like just blood
??? they all good
That's for moms and pops
They're doin' fine
Cause I believe that you check on them from time to time
Cause I can still feel the pain when you left that night
It's like a sign from God to help me change my life
This music? It's all we got, see me a blast (yeah)
Sheer me
Cause these streets just tryin' to kill me
The only child
So I'm goin' only down
Look out for moms and sisters while they still around, yeah

Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder
Thinkin' about doin' right
Steady doin' wrong, who's right? Who's wrong?
Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder
Thinkin' about doin' right
Steady doin' wrong, who's right? Who's wrong?
Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder..
Oh yeah
Because grown men cryin' sometimes
Stuck in jail without bail, makin' grown men cryin' sometimes
Oh yeah...</pre>
