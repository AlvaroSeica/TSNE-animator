Artist: MC Lars
Album:  The Laptop EP
Song:   Hurricane Fresh
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

Oh snap, you know this track is fly, so get crunked up and don't ask why
Post-rap, post-punk, post-Kurt Cobain, post Kool Moe Dee post-House of Pain
Chuck D told me I had to be me so I bought the Public Enemy CD
I ripped one track in .mp3, "Till Lars Ulrich came after me
I said, "It's me your lost nephew," he said, "No way, that can't be true."
I kicked him with my Converse shoe all the way to Timbuktu
Of Wolf and Ulrich, Sad But True, he lived there for a year or two
He mastered Puppetry alone, justice for Sean Fanning clones

[Chorus]
Now that's fresh. Now that's fresh, that's fresh (get fresh)
Now that's fresh, that's fresh (I get fresh)
Now that's fresh, that's fresh (get fresh). Now that's fresh

My Dad's named Bob, he toured with me, when a UK label put out my CD
I got mad props from the BBC, but hip-hop heads still don't get me
So I take a chance, I rhyme white but so what? I like James Brown and Beyonce's butt
Whatever your race I'll Friendster you and rent two Spike Lee NetFlix too
And I still rock shows and try to dance, still rock Simpsons underpants
And I still like Rush and Dr. Dre. I still keep bumping N.W.A
I get fresh on the mike like a milkman on duty
So burn this disco to the ground and baby shake that booty
I attack the track like a Steve Segal movie. 3D fresh, not 2D fruity

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
05 so live, I've been doing this for years
making money 'cause I'm funny with this music of the spheres
And I dance! Hey, watch me dance
Goofy MC's can't be me even if they had the chance
Pondora have you seen Persephone?
Hades rabies got me going like KRS-ONE
Why is that? (I don't know) MC's act like they don't know
I poison this track with a Scorpion flow

Because I rock the mike like a hurricane
Because I rock the mike like a hurricane
Because I rock the mike like a hurricane
Because I rock the mike, hurricane fresh!
