[Chorus: Papoose] (Remy Ma)
She says she love my nature
She don't love me she love my gangsta
She don't love me she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was it was)
She 'll still love me 'cause love is love, uh!

[Remy Ma] (Papoose)
He said he love my body
He don't love me he love my punaany
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me (If it was it was)
He'll still love me 'cause love is love

[Verse One: Remy Ma] (Papoose)
(Now what's my name?) Daddy! (What's my name?) Daddy!
And I still love him even when I'm Maggy
He has me wrapped around his finger
And in my cell phone he got his own ringer
Now sometimes he get heated and I know he don't mean it
But as much as he accused me I should've cheated
And even if he cheated, he wouldn't believe it
'Cause right after I read it, message will get deleted
And I, know we even but, I don't never see it
When I step on the scene, the groupies gotta beat it
He caught, it's cool but we break up
New bag new shoes and we make up
He buy me diamonds that's my darlin
Guess I really believe that he's sorry
As far as I can see it car for me
How could I not accept his apology? Yeah!

[Chorus: Papoose] (Remy Ma)
She says she love my nature
She don't love me she love my gangsta
She don't love me she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was it was)
She 'll still love me 'cause love is love, uh!

[Remy Ma] (Papoose)
He said he love my body
He don't love me he love my punaany
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me (If it was it was)
He'll still love me 'cause love is love

[Verse Two: Papoose] (Remy Ma)
(Now what's my name?) Baby! (Now what's my name?) Baby!
And once I get it I'm gone I'm Swayze
I do the damn thing and I run
I knew she was a freak 'cause she had an earring in her tongue
Cop a whip I cop rims I'm not those dudes
How you go and buy a suit and don't cop no shoes?
Put the sugar foot inside her stomach
Man I'll have her climbin up the walls like Spider Woman
She could ride through the hood on back of the motorcycle
Sexy she got more things than the bible
Can't tell a woman you love her, are you stupid?!
Words don't express your love you gotta prove it
A man give you his trust you can't abuse it
Analyze your choice before you choose it
Ask Snoop Dogg, I let it bang
I got the hardest chick in the game, screamin my name

[Chorus: Papoose] (Remy Ma)
She says she love my nature
She don't love me she love my gangsta
She don't love me she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was it was)
She 'll still love me 'cause love is love, uh!

[Remy Ma] (Papoose)
He said he love my body
He don't love me he love my punaany
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me (If it was it was)
He'll still love me 'cause love is love
