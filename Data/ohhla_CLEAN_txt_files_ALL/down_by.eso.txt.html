Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bliss]
I'm in the back of a ute and I'm freshly servin'
BnE brew I got a esky burstin'
From doin' loops and a rexy burnin'
To the babble of this beat started jet ski surfin'

I, keep keep it I keep I keep on it
Dig beats deep as a creek and speak sonic
The waves I'm making capsize canoes
You can bathe in the wake to baptize your crew
When I'm down by the river, bangin' from Sydney
Hand on my outboard fangin' my dinghy
Streams run free, all over the globe
Still water runs deep, so go with this flow
As long as the Amazon, as deep as the Congo
The heart of the party, the beats on the bongo
A bongfire is the inner camp visual
Werewolves howl at the river bank ritual

[Chorus]
Down by the river I, learnt how to swim
Where the records play and wash away all the stress that's been

It fueled my fire higher
It took me higher higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go

[Eso]
Yeah, funhouse is open
And now the sundowns approachin'
The boatshed is where I live it up all day
And magic mushrooms litter the walkway
To a gumtree swing for the hot sun
Where we fish off the dock with a shotgun
And a BMX track out the back not givin' a shit with a pig on the spit
And you can bet your bottom dollar there's a bong or two
We got the backyard lookin' like Taronga zoo
With a fluro skyline, bats in the distance
Fact is you won't catch Max doin' dishes
We got an AK, shooting clay pigeons
And Izm on the decks bangin' Gravediggaz
And if the cops come and stop the beat
That's when I let a pack of Ridgebacks off the leash

[Chorus]
Down by the river I, learnt how to swim
Where the records play and wash away all the stress that's been

It fueled my fire higher
It took me higher higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go

It fueled my fire higher
It took me higher higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go

[Bliss]
It's the time on the clock when the train goes
So I glide off the pot on a rainbow
See my sight at the top of the range rose
And I'm right on the dot when I aim bro
I just ride down the block wearing plain clothes
With the eye of a croc-killing cane toad
When I'm live in the spot of the main grove
I love to here the whole crowd say "AYO"
And not a second of silence
BnE worldwide reppin' the island
It's so much when their boppin' and their vibin'
So go nuts like a rocket in a silo

[Eso]
Drunk in a dinghy, actin like pirates
The boat that rocked once Macca got violent
Bad to the bone on a Hanzo classic
While kids backflip on a jumbo mattress
So bounce, and let your hair down
Ump the body count and let off spare rounds
And don't hurt no one, and don; t touch my perso punk
So, take it from me I stay on the top when they're shakin' the tree
Yeah, and in a matter of minutes no matter the limit
I rap and I rip it so you know Big Macca done did it

[Chorus]
Down by the river I learnt how to swim
Where the records play and wash away all the stress that's been

It fueled my fire higher
It took me higher higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go</pre>
