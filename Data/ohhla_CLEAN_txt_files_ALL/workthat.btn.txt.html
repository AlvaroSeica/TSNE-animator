[Tony Touch]
Aiyo I step in the club on some dilate nuevo
me and these nuts straight out the gettho
I like how you strut and uncrisp the lettos
tryin' to cover up, you still see the fellows
It's T. Touch mister bahapanti
with a rap for a mummy lookin' like ashanti
all in my ear talkin' 'bout she want me
cause she buzzin' off that off these full monty
ay bendito ay bendito
kick that unique flow start the freak show
hey barrito tranquillito
V.I.P. mode with my people
curtains is closed flirtin' with hoes
on the bona cause she heard o' the flows
freaky ton arse start workin' the pole
with her hands in my pocket searchin' for doe

[Chorus]

[Psycho Les]
Too hot petite be too cold for pity yo
V.I.P. surrounded by big titty hoes
I make a toast to a chick
and tell her bottoms up
take her back to my room
and pull her bottom down
carta we brown mummy like tweat
takin' off her shirt then her skirt
went down to her feet
'echo's dj'ing'
I go brrr stick 'em
and puff lot love wit 'em
I get 'em in the mood
and I knew then I'd hit 'em
I lick 'em
if I love 'em I like 'em
when they thuggin'
once I plug the plug in
I have them ruggin' for the druggin'
I'm a animal under the sheets
when I'm bangin' you
like one of my beats
in my system
switchin' lanes on the streets
keep you close on
when you have clean one steam one
not she wanna suck a mean one

[Chorus]

Where you at ma?

[JuJu]
Come in the place saw the chicks alive
(female)you got a problem I  can fix tonight?
honey I'ma lapdance till my dick's the light
(male)so you better get it right!
you look nice and I got a good feeling
and my wants are stacked up to the ceiling
a little smile makes you so appealing
right here that's where you need to be kneeling
come on girl sex you with sexy
poppin' that thing all over the plexi
take my money abuse and molest me
I wanna take it as far as you'd let me
a little condo may be a dream
maybe a little nightcap what do you think?
maybe you can make a man fall in love with a blink
right?ain't that right
(echo)

(male)Ohh
