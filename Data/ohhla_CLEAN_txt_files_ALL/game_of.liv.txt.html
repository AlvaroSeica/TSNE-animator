[Intro]
That nigga crazy

Uh flava, get that motherfuckin money, you know what im sayin
I'm surviving, fuck that, aint tryin to be broke, know what im sayin

[Chorus: Grand Puba samples]
Raised in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto, singing songs called survival

[Verse 1: Stretch]
Straight up and down, this story's all about street life
Where most live by the gun and others live by the knife
This aint no sell outs, damn about fake shit
Cuz when we come you know we come legit
Now you dumb motherfuckers won't understand this
And the powers gunna clinch they fist
But we don't give a fuck cuz we tell it how it is
Now let me get down to biz
When we was growning up, we was living in poverty
Hand me down clothes was given to me
Poor memories, boy I got em
Only broke ???? coming out the bottom
And the apartment was roach infested
One double bed was where four of us rested
We didn't have shit, P-double O R
Now im a mothafuckin star
But back then, my parents never had enough dough
I had to rob a nigga for a pair of steel toes
They had the rent to pay, plus they had bills
So a nigga had to get ill
And go for mine the only way I knew how
Whatever, Whatever, Im tryna tell ya now, kid
It was robbin or stealin, or sellin drugs on the street
Shit, Cuz a niggaa gotta eat
Yeah, but then I got older and bolder,
Turn into to a motherfuckin soldier
Now im the Mac Top General
Moving keys with ease, like they was motherfuckin minerals
And the streets we're controlling
And the stinky ass cops is on the payroll and
My brother young Majesty been wit me (right here)
He been down since day o-n-e
We're playing the crazy ill game of survival
The thought of us starving is dead on arrival
We're untouchable, god-damn immortals
After the hook, Maj kick the moral

[Chorus: Grand Puba samples]
Raised in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto
Raised in the ghetto, singing songs called survival

[Verse 2: Majesty]
Fuck being positive, I lived in the ghetto
Not in a condo, so to the block I had to go
Hustlin', scramblin', stickin, whatever
Never got caught cuz I was too fucking clever
To the powers I'm dumb, but on the streets I'm Einstein
On Springfield is where you'll constantly find
Niggas like me with a pocket full
Always on some shit, so my gun I pull
Cuz im at war, motherfucker, tell em give it up
A niggas gotta survive so I don't give a fuck
That's why you'd do what I did, because ya had to eat
But yo, now I'm here schooling on this funky beat
And to my man Ed Lover I give a special thanks
Cuz if it wasn't for him I'd been done robbed a bank
Americas most wanted for murdering police
But while they on the ally illin like a beast
This is for the North, the South, the West and the East
They're tryna tell us how to live, are they crazy man?
We gotta survive, the best way we can
Be positive? What are you, dumb?
Poverty is where we comin from
But when we sell a gem, you say we outta order
But how the fuck did we get across the border?
And how the fuck did we get across the water?
You don't know, you don't have a hunch
They're the leaders of the motherfucking bunch
When theyre in our neighborhoods they point they fingers
But believe me that they are the head ringers
Coke killin us, locking us up, saying we wildin
But fuck that shit, you know we just survivin</pre>
