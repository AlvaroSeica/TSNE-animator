(*Intro*) 
Need something to lower my stress 
(let's see, we got bubba kush, lavender kush 
Tally Sevalis kush, OG Scarlett Johansson kush m-m) 
  
[Hook] 
Kush roll glass full, I prefer better thangs 
Niggaz with no money, act like money isn't everything - 4x 
Just another young nigga, having thangs mayn 
Just another young nigga, having thangs mayn 
  
[E.S.G.] 
I'm bout to take flight, Cali smoke Vegas lights 
Cause ain't a damn thing sweet, when your cake ain't right 
Leather gust leather Chucks, make sure my taper right 
My money bags, money counter shit'll take all night 
So get your cash up, you solo get your swag up 
These young hogs stunting, nigga put your tags up 
Clean a pirate's glass up, 'fore them laws task up 
Chopper goon stopper, don't make me have to mask up 
All contenders should surrender, wave them white flags up 
Catch em on a bad day, they make ya give that Jag up 
Trying to fill that stash up, anytime we clash up 
Tom Brady in the clutch, crash dummies I pass em up 
  
[Hook] 
Kush roll glass full, I prefer better thangs 
Niggaz with no money, act like money isn't everything - 2x 
Just another young nigga, having thangs mayn 
Just another young nigga, having thangs mayn 
  
[E.S.G.] 
Corporate gorillas, but we don't rock a suit and tie 
You know the truth is I, they say the coupe is fly 
When my homeboy Pimp C died, felt just like when Biggie died 
You still on 36, I just whipped me 65 
By the age of 25, he get like twenty pies 
Alabama Indiana, let em fly retire 
Real trill niggaz go and get it, and they don't care who's hating 
Sometimes it might be green, purple white Sarah Palin 
Cause I'm a Southside ali', and I was bred to go hard 
Survived the swag era, backpacks and skateboards 
Social network, lil' homie trying to get work 
And I ain't talking my old boss, I'm talking bout the whole South 
  
[Hook] 
  
[E.S.G.] 
Yeah the wrist and flow still cold, I guess I'm so anemic 
While you bullshitting I'm still spitting, I guess I'm half bulimic 
Some took the harder route, some punk niggaz took the scenic 
The house full of Arizona, I ain't talking Phoenix 
Some did it independent, and never sell they soul 
Been in the streets trying to get it, since like he was twelve years old 
Some people hustle hard, trying to achieve they dreams 
Camaro crib paper'd up, nigga only 17 
Two hundred times 17, them numbers you ain't never seen 
These youngsters getting it in, they selling like everything 
From the land of the trill kings, where our dream's to win 
Got a fettish fo' the money, let Drake tell y'all again 
  
[Hook] 
  
[Outro] 
Oh hell no, look-look-look 
They taking the champagne, and the citrus buds 
And the fresh magore, and the early misty 
And the god bud, and the ice marijuana 
And the island lady, and the kush</pre>
