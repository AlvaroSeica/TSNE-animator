[Intro: Cold 187Um]
Aoowwwww, aoowwwwww, ha ha, aooww, aoww
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G from Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G from Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore

[PEE GEE]
Zoe and hoe, these guys, yo they can't chill
This is how they groove, as hell yeah 
You can't be titanium
OOOOhh God, are you glad?

[Cold 187Um]
The definition of my status; I'm a G
Cause some of you wanna see me, and some of you wanna be me
You couldn't even break my sweat
Hollerin' 187 but they ain't killed shit yet
Yo, but I'm a player to the T
Aww yes, and I can take you back just like the cold jack memory
I got strikes, so guess I got many stripes
From checkin' a gang of niggaz, and landin' a gang of pipes
Whores know I do it good, those know I do it good
See, they don't try to test and I wish they would
Cause I ain't standin' out like those from the past
Cause if I'm goin' off the gangbang, I'm still quick to blast
So fuck the drive-by, I stepped out, and stepped up
And if we got beef, BOO, you're fucked
I got skills to pay my grandchildren's bills

[KM.G]
How you're livin' player?

[Cold 187Um]
Yo player, by bein' real
Cause I'm in time and time and time again
I've found myself in a green 2B
Gouge his eyes out, goin' for a long long ride
Aoowww, and it's like bobba dabbab bam bam battattam 
Bam bam, bam bam, she said: ooooh wait a minute
But I was full of that Gin and Juice
So I'm all in ridin' that ass like a horse
Cause boom boom boom me a bad boy
Ugh, I wake them up, and I make them smilled the coffee
And when I'm finished up, umm, they want another cup
Cause it's good, good to the last drop
So baby get on your knees and do me like you did last summer
Ugh, I think I lost my memory
That was it you? - or was it Shierce?
Or was it because I'm Dell? - or was it because I'm Vivi?
Don't be surpriced cause I played you like that
Awww, Cause I'm a straight up man

[Chorus: Cold 187Um, Kokane &amp; KM.G w/ minor variations]
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G from Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G and Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore

[KM.G]
G, I'm kind of weak when it comes to the tits, your nipples
Let me hit and pull your Chili dim pussy
I'm kind of owned the Smith &amp; Wesson side of the industry
Is you fearin' me? 
Claimin' straight Pimp Gang, blast when I'm on ahh.. 
Hit you on the backside, bounce on my 'tonas 
Straight through your hood, I be on my way
With some Endo and a fifth of Alaz√®
[Cold 187Um] Cause ain't no Sunshine..
Yeah, it's kind of cloudy
Ask me why I pumped my nine, cause your hood is kind of rowdy
I'm out here sexin' on drunk
Plus, I got two and ounce chickens in my truck
Hold up, the nigga has pagered on
[Cold 187Um] Nigga, where are my shit at?
But I'm out here flexin' and it just don't quit
See, I'm kind of large and when it comes to my Johnson
I'm flossin, I'm sexin, I'm stabbin, perfection
Make a fleece, make a bomb ass fleece
Hittin' them Doggystyle, waddin' a gallon of V.S.O.P.
Saggin' as I be in their crib
Called the niggaz in the Clinic tell them just what I did

[Chorus: Cold 187Um, Kokane &amp; KM.G w/ minor variations X2]
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G and Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore

[PEE GEE]
Yeah, (Spanish word)
These guys, yo they can't chill
This is how they groove, as hell yeah 
You can't be titanium
OOOOhh God, are you glad?

[Kokane]
I get at that whore..

[Cold 187Um]
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G and Gigolo..</pre>
