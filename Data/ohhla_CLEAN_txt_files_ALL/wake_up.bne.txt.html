[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Stand up, stand up
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up... so get up, get up)
Young niggaz it's time to stand up, stand up
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up... so get up, get up, get up)
Stand up, stand up! (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Stand up! Hey, hey, hey (Wake up, wake up)
Young niggaz it's time to stand up, stand up, stand up
(Wake up, wake up, wake-wa-wa-wake up) Stand up, stand up

[Layzie Bone]
Aw shit, look what the wind blew in
Y'all better move cause I'm finna get started
L-Burna from the "Land of Tha Heartless"
Strapped with a nine, don't make me spark it
Y'all probably done heard the news, if not then you need to check it
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony done broke away from Useless Records
We independent now, this shit ain't funny now
This +Real Talk+ nigga, and I'm lovin the way it's goin down
Roll or get rolled over partner, Number One, nigga that's my name
Winnin, scorin, stayin on point - better give me the ball, that's my game
No disrespect, but I run with the best of the best
From the North to the South, from the North to the South to the East to the West
Oh yes I'm blessed, this nigga don't need no vest, no stress
I want it all, and nothin less, no nothin less nigga

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone] 
While I'm runnin in a circle, the demons say I am murkable
No weapons are formed in the storm; it's gettin warm
I'm purple-hearted, watchin the world
While dippin up out of the science with alliance, one all, there are many worlds
Heavenly Father, while we dippin in this wilderness
Watchin where we castin our pearls, that's to the wickedness
Old school bible vocab, spit up the bible
Slice in math, spit it in a paragraph style
But me don't want no bad man, give me some medification
Baby that ain't a word, you know my edumacation
Split up the verb dawg, I don't think that that's a verb
Feelin like the troubles have become so absurd
Forever, pay for the sins that we know that we've committed
Been admittedly, born in the sins, is we sinners?
Let me take you out to dinner, so you can study my life
Will you love me or condemn me? That's the price (price)

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Only roll with G's, and the difference 
between you and us nigga it's evident
Y'all niggaz be sittin back broke as hell 
and I'd rather be chasin dead presidents
It's benefits, to these ways of livin 
You see me dawg and you know I'm shinin
Sold a mil', went way past diamond 
I could sit back but I'd rather keep grindin
Mindin mine, stayin out of yours 
Stayin out of there's, just so focused
Look and learn and take notice
I be reppin my set the coldest
Nothin but soldiers, when I'm posted up 
Y'all bustas can't come close to us
Fake-ass G's be chokin up
while my thug brothers be loc'in up
