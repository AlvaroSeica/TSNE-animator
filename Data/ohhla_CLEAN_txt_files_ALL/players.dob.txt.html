I said a hip-hop-ta-pop the hibby to the hip-hip-hop 
a you dont stop a rockin' to the greenside bump
Up jump the boogie to the rythim of the L.S.O.B
Now what you hear is not a test, well I be busin' to this beat 
See its me and my dog and the homie Kid Frost, 
gonna try to take your freak, haha
See I am ODM and I'd like to save you folk
To the black and the white the red and the brown 
and the hynas that are good to go 
But first, I gotta bang-bang-da-boogie to the boogie 
say up jump the boogie to the gangbang boogie lets rock and you dont stop 
Rock the rythim that will make your cherry pop 
Well so far you've herd my voice but I braught two friends along (zup dogs)
And next up to bust is my homie Kid Frost, Go ahead Frost lace this song

[Frost]
Check it out I'm the K-I-D F-R-O-S-T baby doll its time to ride 
See I role with the crew called the G-Spot G's 
and these the reasons I'll tell you why 
See I'm number one and I'm tons of fun, I'm down to a teeth 
And I got more jewels Then all them fools and I dress up preciously 
I got body guards, I got five big cars, lift Them front and back 
I got a 9 SS Impala, a ? gold Cadillac 
Everything is cool I take a dip in the pool 
Like deck cause its time to ball 
A big screen t.v. so I can see the Lakers play baskeball 
Here me talk about checkbook credit card more money 
then a sucker, could ever spin 
But I wouldnt give a sucker not dime quarter 
cause its all about jakin them 
A everybody go hotel-motel a watcha gonna do today (say what?) 
I'm gonna get my freak and hit them chicks
and drive off in my brand new Range 
Everybody go hotel-motel Holiday Inn 
I say if your girl start acting up then you bust here friend 
Up on beat (uh hu) my Mellow (that's right)
That's on you, so what you gonna do?

[DTTX]
Well its on and its on and on-on-on-on 
Say the beat dont stop until the break of dawn 
Now I'm a P-L-A a Y-E-R a G with a double E 
See a we go by the unforgetable clique of Lighter Shade of Brown 
you see nooooowwww 
My name is known all over the world
 by all the true down players and the fly ass girls 
And we going down in history 
as the baddest playas you ever did see 
As you chillin yo highs and you Banging your lows 
The feet starts moving down to your toes
You start snappin' your fingers and moving your feet 
Your body starts rocking to the shoreshine beat 
I said jam you start movin' your feet 
I said jam Right out of your seat 
Now just throw your hands high in the air 
and wave them all around like you dont care 
Keep rocking to the beat withought no care 
And make sure you come sharp baby for the affair 
Now I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang 
But I bang to the beat just the same 
I got a playas face, and a pair brown eyes 
all I'm here to do baby is just hypnotise 
Singing on and on-on and on-on
Say the beat dont stop until the break of dawn 
I said a 1-2-3-4 a come on y'all a get on the floor
Well come alive y'all  a gimme what you 
Got cause I'm guranteed to make you roc.

[Mellow Man Ace]
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon 
reporter stopped me for an interview 
She said she's heard stories she heard fables 
that I'm all drugged out still and turn tables 
This fly reporter I did adore
I got smooth on that ass and popped the car door 
She said damn Mellow Man I'm in love with you
all the stories I've heard they couldn't of been true 
By the way sugar whats your name
She said I go by the name ExoticElaine 
And you can be my boo kid you surely 
can just let me dump my boyfriend the local bud man 
I said he's a Busta I do suppose 
puttin that meth all in your nose 
He may be very paid or even cute
but his raps dead Wack you should give him the boot 
I said you need Mellow Man I got finesse
I got my name in old english tatted on my chest 
He may be able to slang all through the night
but he can't rock a party throught the early light 
He may satisfy you with his little worm, 
but I'm gonna turn that ass out when I get my turn 
Im goin'do it, I'm goin' do it, I'm goin' do it do it do it 
Cause I'm here and I'm there 
cause I'm Mellow Man Ace and I'm everywhere 
So just shock y'all a ticky-tak y'all 
you dont stooopp, you keep on.
(yes yes yall)
(yes yes yall)</pre>
