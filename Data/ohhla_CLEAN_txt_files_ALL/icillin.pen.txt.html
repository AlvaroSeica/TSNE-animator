[ VERSE 1: Penhead ]
Niggas lost the fundamentals, I come with original shit
This ain't traditional lyrics, my spit's heaven-sent
The spirit of a... lies within me
The cries of my enemies are entertaining
You niggas playin games like hide 'n seek
Still the police find your body layin deceased
My hip-hop's a form of ministry, rhymes are menacing
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I'm glad you're here to witness this punishment
The crowd wants something different than that same shit you comin with
May I address the public for a moment and vent my pain
I know the feds wanna convict my brain
For the conspiracy to commit mass murders
Collapse the girders of massive structures
Corrupted by the streets, still I don't preach
Poison, my words have been annointed
I hear the voice of greatness
Tellin me to beware of haters and fake players
Givin congratulations, like they truly give a fuck
Probably tryin to do me, plottin on stickin me up
Haters never get enough till they get a slug in the face
When all you show is love it hurts when niggas hate
I pray my parents get to see this legacy
Before they see the cemetary and the remains to bury
Lord help em carry on, God forbid I go before them
Who knows the fortune through life's courses
My mic's notorious, I write ( ? ) shit
For shorty thick with sense, pretty bitch elegant
To touch her flesh naked is a pleasure
The game's filled with competitors and contenders
I choke from hittin reefer, smoke leaves that's deeper
I speed ( ? ) and time-leap ya

[ CHORUS ]
These rap niggas is bacteria
I spit that penicillin that'll kill em and get rid of em

[ VERSE 2: Penhead ]
My page is a nervous wreck, my flow is murderous
I network in drug circuits for security purposes
In case of emergencies I'll have ways to make currency
Till my team's on officially it's whatever, man
My terminology is of a street veteran
The liquor gives me a speech impediment
Slurrin like my daddy
Pissy drunk staggerin through alleys
A flashback may have me spazz out
Not thinkin 'bout a crackhouse, I need blocks mapped out
The evolution of criminology
The revolution was a prophecy
Don't cross your boundaries
The king will crown me shortly
Run with cats that drown forties with Dolphin County stories
Peace to the niggas rootin for me, I'm forever greatful
Try to get this cash legally from under the table
Man, the crime economy competes with Wall Street
I'll take a small piece, what can the game offer me
But snakes and haters, money and lies?
Now sold as advertised, your customers aren't satisfied
Try to capitalize on a magnified gimmick
I spit that pennicillin that baptise niggas
Let's make it definite, I'm committed to excellence
No vaxines for this rap fiend
Emceeing's a medicine
My victim bones are stepping stones
I'ma be cautious now when talking on the telephone
Conversations are high powered
Street connections sky-rocket
I'm a underworld by-product
And I give it to you white collar criminals
Fuckin with my business is not in your best interest
You know once your office is engulfed in flames
Never thought you could be charged to the game

[ CHORUS ]</pre>
