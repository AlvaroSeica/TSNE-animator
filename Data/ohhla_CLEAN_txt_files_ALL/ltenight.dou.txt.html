She wanna know my name, wanna know my game girl
But let me know, what's up wit you
Just hit me, on the lat night
And we can do, what grown-up's do
She say she like my style, say she feel my vibe
I'm trying to see, what's up with you
Just hit me, on the late night
And we can do, what grown-up's do

[Dougie D]
Well you say you wanna know my name
you really impressed how I pimp my game
My pimping is so thoed you think it's strange
but nevertheless when I called you came
Now ain't that strange ironic
once you fucking around with a G that's balling
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and you call me
I'ma be up in it from the night to the morning
Stretching and yawning in your bed
wake up in the morning to some real good head
You know you what I like and I ain't even gotta say it
girl you a superstar already
Y'all cut the lights off lights heavy
does it look good when you do it like that
Bend it over see my style and my vibe on tap
P-I-M-P and I is I just can't help that's all this is
What it do girl what you really wanna be
I'm trying to see what the deal with the late night creep
Grown folks shit when you fucking with a G
and that's what it do when you fucking with the Dougie D
So when you feeling you ready to get away and freak
if I don't answer the phone leave a message at the beep
If I don't answer the phone leave a message at the beep
if I don't answer the phone leave a message at the beep

[Hook]

[Russell Lee]
Say baby girl tonight, could really be your lucky night
Just let me know what's up, I wanna know what's up with you and I
I think I seen you somewhere, from around the way
And I'm just trying to take you home, trying to make you moan
And I'm trying to get to show you, what I'm all about yeah
So baby let me take you for a ride, and take you to the other side
So you can show me, just how you get down
You know that I really wanna hear you, make that freaky sound

[Hook]

[Dougie D]
Oh now I'm a special freak
cause you like the way I put it all in
Got a few corners to bend the wheels spin
you know what it is baby this is pimping
Dougie the daddy baby that's all I is
can't be nothing mo' or nothing less
Give it to me good girl with no stress
I'm ready for bucked naked hot sex
You could begin with a lil' service
when I blow up on dro with red hair cess
Sipping up on purple and rest my hand
you gotta know what I want and can't be scared
Yes indeed girl I'm on my pimping
in the streets block and wood grain gripping
Sitting up on grey and chrome I'm tipping
best believe I'm about my bidness
Dougie D like jelly I'm the one
gonna show you making a freak you some
Ecstasy between you and me
means a whole lot of sweating in between the sheets
A whole lot of going hard up in the pink
and a back beating from the serving beef
That fa sho girl when you want that call me
up in the late night and I'm out here crawling
