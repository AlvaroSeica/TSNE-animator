[Sample]
When dem tune yah play people tend fi run and dance and bawl 
But let mi tell yuh one ting!

[Sample from Capleton]
MORE FIRE!!!!

[Verse One: Rick Ross]
My corner so polluted, young niggas lootin
I studied Kenneth Williams, I'm one hell of a student
Remarkable hustle, my niggas comin home
I kept the candle lit, my nigga never rowed
Niggas caught him slippin, gave him a shit bag
Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack
It's Death Row, conspiracy theories
Concealed indictment handed to the grand jury
Get some money now, you hated your own kind
The home invasion done by niggas in yo' bloodline
GABOS, game ain't based on sympathy
So he put a hit on his cousin in 18th
A sweet potatoe pie oh me oh my
Showin no remorse watchin the others cry
Heroin scales, detectives will sell
Alot of yellow tape, where that Obamacare?
This the mob bitch, silk underwear
Yeezy concerts, Kim Instagrams
Niggas hatin though, they studied my moves
I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews 
Two attempts on my life they threatened venues
Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue
I bought more jewels, I ordered the wraith
I got a new style of shoes match the watch in the face
Bill Belichick coachin and callin the shots
Throw a yellow flag pussy niggas body drops
Then we celebrate, black bottles pop
Time to elevate, we reopen shop
Wale a genius, Meek Mill a superstar
My new crib in Phoenix, ten car garage
Patek Philippe, platinum Audemars
Ain't no tags needed nigga, I own them cars
I know them bitches, we met them broads
Never loved one, fucked them all
I'm a fuckin dog, Ricky fuckin Ross
Nigga, Birkin bags just for my runner ups
But my main bitch, she get the main dish
Not the old range, that was my lame bitch
Brazilian weave, she say I came quick
I let her see a hundred K's, a gift from St. Nick
Movin bricks like it's Black Friday
She gotta fuck me or call me a fat cry baby
Lookin over my shoulder, I can't trust a soul
Bought a spot in Anguilla just for me and my hoe
Glock .40, even when I shower
Chrome .22 in my swimming towel
Mob ties and I pray the music set me free
May the powers that be, better let me be

[Chorus: Mavado]
Ya better not around, when the sun goes down
And the real real killers them out for ya
(ANYWAYYYYY!!!! Ayyyyy!!!!!)
It's gonna be a bloodshed! One buss one dead, it's gonna be a bloodshed!
Gu-Gunshot inna head!

[Verse Two: Mavado]
Payback is a motherfucker! Yes I feel it when I squeeze the trigger
I feel the air when my enemies die! I feel the strengh of ten killers!
What is to be will be! Only God alone can kill me!
'Cause these fuckin streets filthy! Plus! And I ain't fuckin guilty!

[Bridge: Sizzla]
Gangsta nuh tek nuh chat from nuh guy, know why?
Violate a gangsta and bullets fly, bwoy die
Guns go off a so mi seh, murderation anywhere
Gangsta nuh tek nuh chat from nuh guy, know why?
Violate a gangsta and bullets fly, bwoy die
Guns go off a so we seh, murderation anywhere

[Chorus: Mavado]
Ya better not around, when the sun goes down
And the real real killers them out for ya
(ANYWAYYYYY!!!! Ayyyyy!!!!!)
It's gonna be a bloodshed! One buss one dead, it's gonna be a bloodshed!
Gu-Gunshot inna head!

[Outro: Sizzla]
