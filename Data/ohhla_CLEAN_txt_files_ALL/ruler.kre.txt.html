Uhm, can I have my gold please?
May I have my gold please?
Thank you

Gold watch
Gold chain
Keep 'em starin' uh
You can recognize me from my gold earings
Fuck your paper, that's some old shit
Call it golden girls
Now that's an old bitch
Gold dipped in my open face shinin' out
I get so much gold, it's drippin' out my mouth
Fuck your bank account
I'm in a gold house
And I'm snortin' gold, and
Smoking brussel sprouts

I got a mouth full of gold
I'm bout to throw up
And my pinky ring frosen just to show off
Fuck your bottle, we're sippin'
Fourtays!
So much gold around my neck
They callin' me slick rick the ruler!
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
The ruler, the ruler
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
The ruler, the ruler

Now she digs gold, she layin miner
She wears lace panties with the gold linin'
Her hair blondie, and she shakin' ass
Her chain real gold, it get takin' real fast
Gold beach, gold wave
We hanging ten, I live the golden life
With my golden friends
Yeah, gold dust gold goose
That's the golden shower
Aye you go girls! that's the golden hour!

I got a mouth full of gold
I'm bout to throw up
And my pinky ring frosen just to show off
Fuck your bottle, we're sippin'
Fourtays!
So much gold around my neck
They callin' me slick rick the ruler!
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
The ruler, the ruler
Slick rick the ruler, yeah

The ruler, the ruler

I thought I died, but I came back to life
I was in a gold case that preserved my life
Now I'm back again
On the streets with a gold chain from the 70's
Super planetary, mega stellar
Hydrostatic gold plated 22's with the platinum automatics
Gotta have it
Got to get it, by any means
We don't come in secons
We are the golden team!

I got a mouth full of gold
I'm bout to throw up
And my pinky ring frosen just to show off
Fuck your bottle, we're sippin'
Fourtays!
So much gold around my neck
They callin' me slick rick the ruler!
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
The rrruler, the rrruler
So much gold around my neck
They callin' me slick rick the ruler!
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
The ruler, the ruler

Slick rick the ruler, yeah
Slick rick the ruler, yeah
The ruler, the ruler</pre>
