[Intro/Chorus: Ice Cube]
Anybody seen the popo's?!
Anybody seen the popo's?!
Let them know, when I'm rolling in a Lo-Lo
Cause you can't fuck with the smoke bowl
Anybody seen the popo's?!
Anybody seen the popo's?!
Let them know, when I'm rolling in a Lo-Lo
I'll serve it to them slowmo'

[Verse One: Ice Cube]
Coming from the Westside, motherfucking alright
Do this shit all night, leave your ass hog-tied
Nigga, this is raw hide, mixed with the dark side
Never will I walk-by, punk, I'm a folk-guy
Nigga, you're a small fry, looking at the hawk, I..
Make you buck, I don't give a fuck, I..
Make you have to duck my.. motherfucking buckshots
Bloody-ass BB's pulled out your buttocks
Aiigh.. these niggaz want to tuck my name
They want to tuck my game, I got plenty of aim, BAW!!
They said, don't fuck with me
Cause if he pull them thangs, there goes your brains, now
His girlfriend's Lois Lane and if you fuck with her
You must smoke Cocaine, brother
Why would you fuck with his?
Blow up your kids and smoke your own mother

[Hook: Ice Cube]
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Where they go?
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
When I'm rolling in the Lo-Lo
I'll serve it to them slowmo'

[Verse Two: Ice Cube]
I'ma keep it real, man, fuck how they feel, man
If you're feeling ill, man, go take a pill
I'ma keep this steel, man, straight at your grill, man
You can tell Opra, nigga, or you can tell Bill
But Mr. Cosby, this ain't a hobby
Nigga, this the ghetto, just like so-wet-o
Where niggaz want to hurt you, there's no rehearsal
Burr.. there's no commercial, when you're turning purple
These niggaz want to tuck my name
They want to tuck my game, I got plenty of aim, BAW!!
They said, don't fuck with me
Cause if he pull them thangs, there goes your brains, now
His girlfriend's Lois Lane and if you fuck with her
You must smoke Cocaine, brother
Why would you fuck with his?
Blow up your kids and smoke your own mother

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Verse Three: Ice Cube]
Here they come.. (*Sample of L.A.P.D sirens*)
That's the sound of the police.. police
That's the sound of the police.. police
Ain't nothing more important to me than payback
I'm holding court in the streets, since wayback
Ain't nothing more important to me than payback
I'm holding court in the streets
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Where they go?
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
When I'm rolling in the Lo-Lo
I'll serve it to them slowmo'
These niggaz want to tuck my name
They want to tuck my game, I got plenty of aim, BAW!!
They said, don't fuck with me
Cause if he pull them thangs, there goes your brains, now
His girlfriend's Lois Lane and if you fuck with her
You must smoke Cocaine, brother
Why would you fuck with his?
Blow up your kids and smoke your own mother

[Outro: Ice Cube X4]
I got to keep it gangster, gangster
Keep it gangster, gangster
Keep it gangster, gangster
Yeah!! (*Sample of L.A.P.D sirens*)
Westside!! 
YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!!(*Explosion*)</pre>
