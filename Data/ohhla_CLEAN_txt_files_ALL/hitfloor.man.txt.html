And I'm a tell you again I'm bout ta Kick Some Butt
So don't sleep I'm constantly droppin' a bomb
Like on ya CD-rom it's MachoMan.Com
New school wreslters take it from me
This game's like school ya gotta earn a degree
It's a compliment when y'all imitate me
But it's war if you try to intimidate me

So you gotta be hard if you expect to pass
Or hit floor real fast if ya fail my class
