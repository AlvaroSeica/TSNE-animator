We in the hood again(Hip Hop, Hip Hop)(2X)

{Chorus}
It goes good times, good friends we in the hood again
Up rock, pop lock, ghetto mardi gras
Hip Hop, don't stop, whatchu do to me
Gold rush, cold crush in the community
DJ's, MC's, graffiti artists
Break dancers, black gangstas we be the hardest
Towns make the hotties hot, we keep the shotty cocked
Fool felt that what he knocked, we make the body rock

[Verse 1]
Now its the dark-skinned nigga with the slim build, and brim tilt
Used to break dance, backspin and windmill
Smoke la till I choke la under my hip hop roots, a culture
Used to ran ourselves from here to the Bronx
It's all your fault Ja
B-boys, B-girls, up in the free world
Givin props to the man who let the planet rock like Afika Bam
Hip hop its a tactical plan, police try to shackle my hand
Cuz they fear this, we raisin' [?] to bring back to the fam
Dubs out the back of the van, so we dont get jammed in traffic
We traffic the jam!

{Chorus}

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, dub made hip hop, before we knew what hip hop was
Word up!.....I'm hip hop cuz
It's the way I walk, the way I talk
It's the way I flex, the way I dress
The way I lean to the side when I'm pimpin my ride
Or your hat to the back as you bop to the vibe
This is cool hurt, Grand Master Flash
This a phenomenon they neva thought could last
But look at us now
Everybody and they mama wanna hook wit us now
They all act like they ain't [?] now
They gimme good money so I took it and smiled

{Chorus}

Hip Hop, we in the hood again
Hip Hop, we in the hood again
Hip Hop, we in the hood again
Hip Hop, we in the hood again

[Verse 3]
Im for the battling booths and fat gold chains
For the troop suits and crack cocaine
Hip hop's the lifestyle that bore the rap game
We like to act wild and talk with that slang
It's that thang, its truly our own
They come down hard cuz we dont rule it [?]
But the life dumb hard, so it bleed thru the flo'
Im only speakin my heart, like what you want me to do

{Chorus}

Hip Hop, we in the hood again(8X)</pre>
