I wanna talk to y'all and make y'all feel my pain
I wanna see the world, I wanna entertain
I wanna make you laugh, I wanna make you smile
I wanna help my fam, I wanna raise a child
I wanna walk the aisle, I want the finest wife
I wanna die for a cause then rewind my life
twist the hands of time, Do things I shoulda done
I knew I shoulda shot, I wish I didn't run
I had a couple deals, now I wanna touch a mil
do a sex scene with Lauren London and fuck for real
I wanna be in love. But I'm still stuck in hate
I want one woman, not 28
I wonder why they call you late, when you leave
I hope God calls me late, don't grieve
I wanna show up at my wake, better yet I wanna be awake
let me finish this is sorta like my bucket list, when karma hits
I'mma feel like a contradictor sometimes I'm a conscious spitter
we not brothers, but I don't wanna call you niggers
don't wanna be your favorite, rather be your father figure
I want to be a legend, I wanna write a book
I wanna keep flowin', I don't wanna kick the hook
I wanna touch your souls, forget goin' gold
I don't even want a plaque, nah don't believe that
I really wanna speak to the Creator, well I handled that
on that song now I just want Her to answer back
I used to want my slope back, the retro kids stole that
I wanted to go on 106, I wanted to smash porno chicks
I used to want a corny hit record, now I wanna save lives
and have Kobe Bryant in my fave five
I wanted a sitcom, now I want a TV station
I wanted to own land, now I want my own nation
wanted to play ball, now I wanna buy a team
I wanna make it just to tell another child to dream
I want to put the fear of hell fire inside a fiend
I wanna put the fear of gun fire inside a teen
Sometimes I wanna scream and learn to sing
I really want to hit the movie screen and jump in the ring
I want to box, I wanna study jujitsu I wanna sky dive
I, really don't want to die I want 9 lives
wanna join the mile high club, run for office one day
just for nothin' I wanna gun-butt an officer
I wanna offer bread to the needy, jobs to the felons
go to restaurants and pay people's tabs and not tell 'em
I want my pockets embellished
I wanna quiet my fetish for hoochies and getting head
everyday I wanna get better look!
I wanna meet Barack, I wanna leave my block
I said I didn't, but I want this CD to pop
I wanna see my pops, you wanna see me stop
I want my moms to see me, see myself up on the top
I don't wanna stop, I don't wanna stop, 
I don't wanna start shit but I don't wanna stop

I'm stopping there</pre>
