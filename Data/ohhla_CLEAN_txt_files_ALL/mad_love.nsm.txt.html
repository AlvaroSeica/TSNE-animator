Song:   Mad Love
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Greg Nice]
You get mad love when your shit is hot
You gets no love when yo' shit is not
You get mad love when your shit is hot
You get no love when your shit is not
You get mad love when your shit is hot
You gettin no love when yo' shit is not
You get mad love when your shit is hot
You get no love when your shit is not

[talking over Chorus]
From everybody
Girls
Friends around your block
People you meet on the street
I mean from your relatives
From the landlord
All sorts of people man

[Greg Nice]
Up early in mornin, jumped in the shower
Jumped back out, jumped in my Eddie Bauer
Love is love, but money is power
Got to the bank in 'bout a half an hour
I got moves to make - every so often
I bump into a fake, yo I got the cravin
Chicken not steak, all I wanna do
is see the booty shake
Classic jams, call me Swan Lake
Before it get worse, it got to get better
Mission, go out, get that cheddar, get that cheddar
Get that cheddar, get that cheddar

[Chorus] w/ minor variations and new ad libs over Chorus

[Smooth B]
Smooth B, I turn sand into holy water
When a King interacts with Queen they bring a holy daughter
I saught the Lord, he heard me, delivered me
from all fears, we've been doin this for years
I rip a mic like a maniac
Vocabulary is scary, Smooth B is a brainiac
So gravitational, I pull with the sun
To make two MC's sound like one
I be the go-getter, true high stepper
Whipper Whip and down to rock used to be Salt'n'Pepa
I bring "Heat" like DeNiro and Pacino
Gimme the money, like that kid in "Casino"
Behold the star, when I was born it was seen
Peep the scheme, Nice &amp; Smooth, dream team

[Chorus] - repeat w/ minor variations and new ad libs to scratched fade</pre>
