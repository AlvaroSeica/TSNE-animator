Ah yea (echo)
Whole world
Mcs
Whose slick
 
We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh ass hair
Style baggy out clouts slick
creamy and fresh east coast to west
 
Brooklyn
uptown
to the universal fair
old school mcs
 
(being scratched in the background)
make your money
 
I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave A-train got the pic in my hair
and what 16 joints later still lounge
fresh, from flatbush in my baggy booster gets
style is tight ees bust the cami' fatigues
50,000 leagues of black, so what's up
can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
to the east and wild Crooklyn, New York
creamy kid yo smith and wesson win a blessing
the angular slang blow spots..bang..eleven
hangin' like bats.cos..the 12 inch wax.
say scorpio
and my hair say 'fro
and my blood say bro
my clics say "eh, yo!"
make sparks from the barrel me tal pistol

to the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
the cool blast mega we black we wild flowers
"Scott La Rock had emm all," I gots the ball
and roll a little panthers through these project halls
the 3-color flag can't hold my baggys sag
7 1 8 to omega
black motion is ocean style
slick in my ways since days of the classic
now glamour boys want to be triple phatted
but I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year, yea
 
east born
beast candles on?
lovely all over the city
and your tape deck blasting 
7ods and the phat fly sneakers
and the camouflage
 
(Make Your money scratched in the background)
 
to the hip hop nation
to the mixtape crew
to the west coast
to the boogie down bronx
 
I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
and 5 elements posture take a B-boy stance
with the gold front shinin' the baggy pants saggin'
this Brooklyn stylin' got the fly girls smilin'
but I'm climbin' findin' new ways of rhymin'
not livin' like a star is strickly about survivin'
divin', deep into the groove of the ghetto
this downtown flavor shines from many angles
yes the notorious, with rhymes so glorious
the Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
rappers be boring us with rhymes of conventional
dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
lyrical skills of the insect emotion
coasting down fulton with a bag of magic potion
now I'm rolling with the seven and the crescent
puffin' some expression
manifestin' today's lesson
stressin the fact that I'm solar guarenteed to go far
cause the mind is intestellar
still pieced  like that so have no fear
but I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year
 
to the queens everywhere
to the whole S.I.
to the lumpen mass
don't forget about your peeps when ya...
 
now you see that I am 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
play me in the winter
play me in the summer
play me in the autumn
any order
You want 'em I got 'em drippin' like water
catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
we bouncing... moving within the truth circles
we played you made you change...strictly ought to
we stratify our wealth from my looty in the bank
there's love amongst the ranks
now I'm a bout to meet my homegirl
cause we be alike
a alike, b alike, let's g alike
jazzy joyce [on the wheels]
jazzy joyce [no one's smoother]
jazzy joyce [phatter than a '94 land cruiser]
where you from?
[the bronx representin' like whatever, fly]
cool are you slicker this year?
[yea, watch]

hit it...
