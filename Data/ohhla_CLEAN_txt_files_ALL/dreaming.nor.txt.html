[Intro: N.O.R.E.]
Yeah! Reminisce nigga! Be blessed!

[Chorus: Mayday]
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life

[Verse One: N.O.R.E.]
See I would wake up on them cold nights
Half a pack left, po' life, try to grab us, while we roll dice
Scatter, back to the block in an hour
Just 'bout time to change clothes and a shower
Set up shop by the dope head
Heroin stashed in the broke head, gun by the moped
Fingerprints in the last weapon I threw away
So while you away, 9 to 5 to a day
I will usually, lay by the basement store
Sling raw by the barbershop
Jerry's gettin cut, stash my work there
As long as I gave Jerry a cut, I could work there

[Chorus: iMayday!]
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life

[Verse Two: Wrekonize]
Ok, feel asleep and half awake
Tryin to direct but now I feel I'm at a matinee
Look mom, I'm on the screen don't mean to beat the pack away
So I can share the meanin of get up and get the lap relayed
Relayed, relayed, get me to give me the cash I made
Dippin you into a relaxin place, let me just get out my pack and pray
To the Gods of my private little dream scape
I see you sleepin on so long even the sheep skate
Each break, each melody causes
All the jealous folks to relish those who readily rock shit
Knock knock get ready to drop kick
The hands of time then rewind it right when the clock ticks

[Chorus: iMayday!]
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life

[Verse Three: Tech N9ne]
How come nobody listnenin?
'Cause a baller let a baller and his bottom he brought him
But a brawler was smaller bombin better up his body blitzin
I'll abolish him it's botherin it's about Benjamin's product
Get bottom pimpin just borrowin just ballin ambition
I annihilated molly no longer dilated
I fly away it seems high away this is how I made it
I get violent when mine is spent on the IRS
To silence somethin cryin I get too sick to try and make it
Man I'm dreamin I can't believe it
Makin it hella hella but everybody need it
I feed it to so many sources 'til I'm depleted
Feelin I'm really beat up with greed I can't conceive it

[Chorus: iMayday!]
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life
Dreamin, but I don't think I'm a sleep tonight
I'm livin the dream and, this just can't be life

[Verse Four: Bernz]
Can't be pursuit of happiness had me writin in classrooms
Fallin asleep, only to block assholes
Grew up a crash test dummy, no fastener
Father was gone so long she called me bastard
Faster pussycat! Ain't no slowin down
Dreamt myself in a corner in order to make it out
Shout iMAYDAY! Now! Get faded now!
Ink on my fingers dead ringer for the singer but I'm Bernz
While they sleep straight 'til they urns
Brown liquor in my stomach makin my chest burn
They heard, I count sheep for four mo'
Fucker! Got a message for Noreaga
Said wake 'em up brother {*Alarm Clock*}</pre>
