Uh ..uh turn me up
Wanna hear the music
Yeah
Wanna feel that vibe
Turn it up
Are we on the air?
Uh huh
Ya didn't hear?
We all over the world, babe
Gotta make that money, man
Do this child
Make your money, dawg
Do it child
Just to whatcha got to do

[Esthero]
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave

[Michie Mee]
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system (Esthero: don't wanna be your-)

[Esthero]
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave

[Michie Mee]
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system
(Esthero: don't wanna be your-)

In life the thing to do
Nothin gained, nothing tried
Very few even try
Most just wanna get high
From the cradle to the grave

Don't wanna be your slave
And I'm not gonna
Take it how you wanna
Love me or hate me
Support me or (?) me
Either way i show love
Let it make me or break me
I'm the queen of self-esteem
No sweat (??)
Set the seam
(??)
Like how you need
Straight up (??)
Ain't no puppet on a string
Like them hoes suckin on your thing
Overworked and underpayed for days
Behave
I'm not gonna be your slave

[Esthero]
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave

[Michie Mee]
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system
(Esthero : don't wanna be your-)

[Esthero]
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave

[Michie Mee]
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system
(Esthero: don't wanna be your-)

Hold on tight, don't let go
Don't want much, just want more
Speakin from my people
Scream it hardcore
Livin in the ghetto
Sleepin on the floor
Watch'you thought, i wasn't gonna ride?
Do it myself, get a piece of the pie?
You be holding your breath (??)
Ya best slit your life koz you're just waitin' to die
People still takin life for a joke
Can't see the fight but you blow a lotta smoke
If you didn't get it, you got what you deserve
Just like that, bless my word
Every day i wake up
(??)
Gots to stay one-up
How you gon' sit back and wait on the wealth?
Ya gotta go get it motivate yourself
If not, you're only perpetratin yourself
And at the end of the day, you only hate yourself
If you know me, you knoe my motto
Takin charge
I got what it takes to make it, make it large

Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system (don't wanna be your-)
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system (don't wanna be your-)

Everybody got a problem
But of course, the world gotta problem
And it's yours
That's why i wrote this rhyme
You can quote this line
Coz i focus line
Livin in some hopeless times, or so it seems
Never let go of your dreams
N'a mean?
N'a mean? (jus do whatcha got to do)

[Esthero]
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave

[Michie Mee]
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system (esthero: don't wanna be your-)

[Esthero]
Do it and do it and do it and do it and do it
Don't wanna be your slave

[Michie Mee]
And I'm not gon' cry, big dawg
And I'm not gon' blame the system (esthero: don't wanna be your-)
