[Intro]
many motherfuckers criticize pros and how they play
and many motherfuckers criticize rappers and what they say
even though they criticize secretly they fantasize
but they know theyll never paid be to play
yea ima kill one of you young punks
with a old school flow
flow flow


though I walk through the shadow of death
I gotta make sure that my shoes ad my outfit fresh
yall bitches get jealous when you see me coming
yall would too if you see my woman
yall know what we bout to do
this shit here bout as sick as the flu
drunk motherfuckers wanna vomit on my shoe
niggas cant have shit prolly cause of you
rappers go to jail like oprah go to yale
steffan policy dont ask dont tell
wheres my waterbees as I go get the mail
half black is the new black cant you tell?
it was blue black like wesley snipes in new jack
now you got to have a white mama just to do that
Tiger Woods used to be a safe nigga
go ahead let your daughter have a date with him
he'll make with her prolly in a wifebeater
tiger bout to change his name to cheater
I don't like it when you call me big poppa
from South Central and I hate helicopters
if we at school I'll break in your locker
see me with a waterbottle mixed with some vodka
drink responsibly or drink constantly
be who you wanna be in this economy
drunk as sean connery at the finery
cant throw me out I'm the honery
trust me I'll never be the nominee
I dont kiss enough ass I'm too honery
ice cube be where the piranahs be 
swim upstream eat north economy
westcoast treat it like hyenas
take what you want from these lieing ass cheaters
eat the fuck out these beavers
thats how we act when you dont wanna feed us
crazy motherfucker since I was a fetus
you might aswell join us you aint gonna beat us
please believe us you can ask Jesus
I'maa be bout as long as Regis
understand I never pledge of alligiance
its like balla confusion might cause a conclusion
see you're crusing for a bruising
fucking with a pricipal that dont like students
dont you know that attention is a lynching
and if I forget to mention then I'm spinning out my pension
no no no no 


the reason I home in
cause this right here is no country for young men
sunny you done fucked up the churches money
im red fox and you that big dummy
this junkyard was a empire
yall let it get ran by vampires
most mcs are god damn liars
like them supervisors working up mcgisors???
bitch I'm not a dodger I'm a laker punk
yous a fucking clipper you can call me jack the ripper
cut you up by your guiser then down by your liver
rooter by the tooter gut you like flipper
dipper yall better treat me like the skipper
head trigga the air nigga
air honkey and air critter
I come in and kill every litter
like that like that like that...


no country for young men
no no no no
its like balla confusion
no country for young men
no no no no
your world is just an illusion 
no country for young men
no no no no
its like balla confusion
no country for young men
no no no no
your world is just an illusion</pre>
