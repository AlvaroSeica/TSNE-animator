[30 second skit to open]

[Moochy C]
Fuck that nigga!
I don't know who gassin you up, they about to get you fucked up, you talkin real gutter
like I won't slice you up somethin nice youse a stupid mu'fucker
I got too much to lose, paid my dues
I ain't got time for petty niggaz like you, I bury niggaz like you
Cut your tongue out, cause the street don't need to hear from you
Youse a bitch, I call it how I see it
We in too deep, too late to apologize
I won't rest until I rid the block of you and yo' guys
You steady tellin bitches lies, how you gon' pop me when you see me
Knowin you ain't got the nuts to, put your hands on me let alone point a gun at me
You a fiction killer, only time you killed somethin
is on a video game nigga, you can miss me with that bullshit
Cause soon as I see you, empty the clip
And watch you choke on your own blood bitch

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We can go to war, I ain't scared of you
You talkin big shit but ain't nobody runnin from you
I'm posted with guns loaded, waitin on you
Show me you a killer, I don't believe you, so what it do

[Moochy C]
Nigga you know who you is, I ain't sayin no names
Cause cats like you will snitch, you and yo' niggaz lame
You better move out of state, cause if you stay in Minnesota
We gon' up the murder rate, kill or be killed
Enough said, you lettin a bitch get in yo' head
That's the quickest way to end up dead
You ain't learned nothin from the last time I beat yo' ass pussy stop frontin
I don't play no games
I'ma knock your teeth out when I smack you with this pistol mayne
You got a problem with GE or Self-Explanatory
You gon' have to see me, that's one situation that you don't wanna be in
Cause that 357 will bring tears to a grown man, your best move is to lay low
Cause on sight, I'ma let that thang go
You don't scare me, and I go where the fuck I wanna go
I'ma make sure you can't speak my name no mo'

[Chorus]</pre>
