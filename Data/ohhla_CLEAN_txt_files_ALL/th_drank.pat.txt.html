(Chorus 4x)
That drank
That drank
That drank will make ya think, sizzerp

Sippin on some purple
I'ma call it urple
Leaning to the sizzide
Cool like a bercule
Weed got me ?
Eyes tight like girdle
Cruising through the hood slow, something like a turtle
Strapped with them triggas
Hanging hanging with my niggas
Everybody flossed out cause we stacking figgas
Hoes getting nothing but some of this nutting
Soft baby esaphagaus bitch you give me something
On this hydro coating
Or promythzzing
Sipping on the sizzerp
Sipping on this lizzing
Macking  in my mizzah
I'm staying hizzigh
True to the shit I do and that's till I dizzie
Suckas wanna stizzep
I'ma keep it reazzal
Do watcha gotta do man to get a meazzal
Never was a hataa
I'ma stay ?
Sipping on this good drank dog everydaya

(Chorus 4x)

Per-per-percoscent, zynax I got the best deals
I love to get powered up off them x-pills
Something to get my swerve on cold dome dranker
Straight out the North Memphis, Tenn on them chrome twenkas
Niggas that hate always end up with hot lead
I'm with them killas hanging out and we ain't scared
Just like my nigga down in Dallas man we already
Swinging in work drink that purple with that erky-jerk
My grill is gold and I smile but ain't shit funny
Like U.G.K. we be hustling for that dirty money
We got them hoes that are pros shaking big booties
Down with they man getting that dough doing thier damn duty
I'm on this drank and this drank got me straight mellow
Most niggas love purple cert I prefer yellow
We been on this, on the town since the 70's
Some trill players out the south is who we be's

(Chorus 4x)</pre>
