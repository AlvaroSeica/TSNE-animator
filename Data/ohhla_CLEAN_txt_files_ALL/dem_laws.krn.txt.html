"The longest grind-a-lot but smoke wit' a whole century"

[K-Rino]
How come y'all like to bother people on the black folk side of town
We can't even throw a block party without y'all tricks coming around
Everyday all they wanna do is hit you hard
What you looking for? I don't sip no bar
Ripping up seats in my brand new car
Damn, man, y'all taking this shit too far
Preposterous, just cuz of who I am I get harassed
I just ask ya for ya badge number and damn you wanna blast
Tryna shatter me and break me like a hammer to some glass
Then slam you on the grass, even with that camera on the dash
Mr. Gram of potent hash, my homegirl Pamela had stashed
Flunked an exam from ghetto class on first day an amateur could pass
He was mad because we had bang and was jamming it on blast
I should have ran cuz I don't think his fat ass stamina could last
They might follow for your dough to Mexico
Hope your gun accidentally goes off and shoots you thru your own ass like Plaxico
In 59 pieces of your vest will blow
These police giving took-out everyday
Keep harassing, you'll be the next to go

(Hook) Ganksta N-I-P

[K-Rino]
These pigs use to wanna peel you
Watcha' mean use? They still do
Make no mistake cuz you live in the ghetto
These polices is out to kill you
The whole department is racist
Pull you over in the darkest places
When they walk upon you pull your piece and let it spark in their faces
Go to the courthouse, everyday the same replay
Satan in the form of the cops, the judge and the DA
The truth is most black people are lacking info
They never knew about the Willie Lynch Letter or Jim Crow
They want you dead or locked up so they can come in hard
Bloodshed, they never barge, they'll shoot you in your mama's yard
We having a party, we done sewed up the whole block
What's the occasion? A racist cop just got his ass popped!
YAY!!! Some of y'all might think this just a song
But this gon' keep on happening till y'all learn to leave us alone
The next stunt will make the whole hood go crazy
What kind of coward will use a taser on an old lady?

(Hook) Ganksta N-I-P

[Point Blank]
Fuck dem laws (Fuck 'em)
Tryna lock a nigga for a whole century
Put a nigga in jail and don't give a damn what he plead
They'll take your cash, strip your ass, finger print and take your belt
Make you bent over and cough, goddamn I ain't got nuttin' else
First of all I'm in this bitch and I really don't even suppose to be
I was at the club chillin' and two mutherfuckaz lied on me
Now I'm fighting the case, pin a lawyer, and I still got bills on my back
I got caught up in some bullshit, real talk, nigga I do this
I suppose I should write my judge a long letter
And tell her I ain't coming back and she owe me 50 stacks
And my daddy always told me "Never-never get scared, nigga"
Look 'em in their eyes, stand strong, you a man, nigga
So fuck it, two tails in the bucket
All the DA's, prosecutors and judge can suck it
Can't water cask for fucking killa
Ready to murk, every five-o nigga, fo'reala...
