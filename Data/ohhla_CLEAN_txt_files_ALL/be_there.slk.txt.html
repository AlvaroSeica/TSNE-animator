(*talking*)
'Sup ma, I know I ain't really been there for you
And shit, like I'm supposed to be
But, I'm ready to make that change
You know I was like running the streets with my niggaz and shit
Not making no time for you, and you the only one that
Really had a nigga back, but ah-ha yeah I know you do
 
I know you care for me, I know you really do care for me
Cause through thick and thin, you always was there for me - 2x
 
[Silkk The Shocker] 
I know sometimes, you get sick of me saying sorry
But this time I really mean it, maybe I took it too far 
I know, some things I did was cold 
When you call my boys call, I'd just put you on hold
And my fault, I thought I'd just tell you that 
I know I'm wrong, I put you through hell and back
But look I'm back from hell, I'm trying to take you to heaven
I know I fucked up in the past, I'm trying to make shit better
And, you never stressed when I went out
You just stood through the hard times, and just blessed me when I went out 
You leaving me, wasn't part of my plan
I don't want you leaving if you decided to, I understand
Cause you was there through the rain, and the sunny days 
Stood by me, when most chicks would run away 
That's why you get respect, when you around my crew 
One day I'ma change, just hope that you around when I do 
 
[Chorus] 
Baby I love you, baby I want you 
Baby I need you, to be there for me 
Baby I love you, baby I want you
Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you 
 
[Silkk The Shocker]
I need a chick if I'm locked up, she'd come visit
If I ain't got a ride, then she come get me
I need a chick who hold me down, if I gotta do a year flat
Her girls telling her to move on, but she ain't trying to hear that 
And she with me, just for me
Not that I can have her seeing jewels, like she worked at Tiffany's 
Not that I can give her things, she wish she had
Spend nights on the yacht, spend days on 5th Ave. 
Or, that I can turn her winters into summers
Show her account, that look like telephone numbers 
Cause if you the one, they gon' know you the one 
It's really nothing, you ain't gon' be able to do for fun 
Beverly Hillbilly, country like the Clampetts
Put you in a neighborhood, the South version of the Hamptons
Some'ing about this, no doubt is strange
And what's your last name is not mine, that's bout to change I got you
 
[Chorus - 2x] 
Baby I love you, baby I want you 
Baby I need you, to be there for me 
 
[Silkk The Shocker] 
Sometime she like to fight, and she like to fuss
Cause she like what happens, after we make up
Shit, she wake up to a kiss
And if I get her real mad, she wake up to a gift 
And she don't do much, sometimes she might pout
At the most, she'll slam a couple doors in the house
But then it's back to whatever 
That's the way to get attention, not to mention make the love much better
And she secure, so when I look
And the only time we go out to eat, is after I cook
And sometimes she be bugging, hard for her to trust me
Cause she heard about, all the days I was thugging
But now she know, that ain't nothing but gossip
You know they jealous, you could tell how they watch us
And ma, all they trying to do is stop us
But you ain't gotta trip no more, if you need me I got ya
 
[Chorus]
Baby I love you, baby I want you 
Baby I need you, to be there for me 
Baby I love you, baby I want you
Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you 
 
Baby, I can't wait to spend my life with you</pre>
