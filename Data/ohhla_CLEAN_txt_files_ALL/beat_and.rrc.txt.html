[Intro]
Harlem raised, I'm illy... I'm illy
Harlem raised, I'm illy

[Chorus]
All I need is a beat and a microphone-phone
All I need is a beat and a microphone
All I need is a beat and a microphone-phone
All I need is a beat and a microph..
All I need, all I need, all I, all I need, all I need, all I
All I need is a beat and a microphone-phone
All I need, all I need, all I, all I need, all I need, all I
All I need is a beat and a microphone-phone

[Mook]
Uhh, many years ago, I picked up a pen
That's the time when the story of Mook began
I would sit in my room, zone out to the box
Watch Wu-Tang "C.R.E.A.M." while I'm choppin rocks
Seen Dr. Dre, N.W.A.
See Eazy go, shouldn't have went that way
Ice Cube came east so he could catch his break
Had Snoop "Doggystyle" bumpin on replay
Lil' cousin T-Rex lived across the way
I would go to his crib, watch Jordan play
Bumpin Mobb style, bumpin Geto Boys
{?} Comstock makin all that noise
Used to sit on the stoop, then we started a group
Me, Rex and O, used to go to the stoop
With the uptown kids had the young new sound
Harv, Sharpe and Pesh{?}, and the boy Ron Browz, now

[Chorus]

[Mook]
I can't explain it any plainer, I'm the entertainer
My favorites is a cross between Eminem and Jada
Jay-Z, oh and AZ, Flava
That was the time when havin lyrics was major
"Ready to Die" was in everybody player
2Pac mighta had the song of the year-ah
Used to go to school with my SkyTel pager
Brand new kicks and was only a 5th grader
Doin it, doin it, and doin it, well
Ladies Love Cool John, I thought I was LL
But I didn't have a Kangol, just had a fitted on
Me and Norm in the crib sayin every Biggie song
X came out, we were screamin "Let's get it on"
Stormy shut the whole house up when Lil' Kim was on
This ain't just a song, this is real life
So I guess this is what payin homage feel like

[Chorus]

[Mook]
Simple and plain, give me the lane
And I'll slam it on your head like LeBron James
Motherfuckers can't stop my dough
"Hold on Murda, give 'em a new flow"
Okay - six minutes, six minutes
Six minutes Mr. Mook, you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Uh uh uh-uh uh-uh uh uh
I'm sorry Doug E., I wanted to do it since I first heard that
Since I had the black furs down with the fur attached
E'rybody know the flow, they beggin me to kick that
Think I gotta switch that, so I'm 'bout to switch that
Rappers wanna test, they wanna get some
They wanna go, but yo, you know the outcome
I'm a hardcore hip-hop head
So don't talk to me about hip-hop dead

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
