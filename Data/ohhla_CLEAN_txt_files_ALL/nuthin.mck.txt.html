[Intro]
Chyeah, you know
It's kinda a gift and a curse and it's kinda hard to always be out on this road
You know why?

[Chorus]
Cause girl when I'm on the road
I ain't gonna lie baby nuthin can compare to you
I won't be fuckin with them chicks like that
Baby girl look I swear to you
Girl me and you see we don't fuck
We just have some good therapy
And it's funny how I always better you
And baby you know you just better me

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about my chick yeah, my main chick
You know, the one I really call Maine's bitch
Yeah that's my main bitch
But I really call her my lady
The type I put it in and now they prolly cop a brand new Mercedes
You know the one that, uh
I don't put no plastic on with
Hoping that she might have my seed one day
You know the one that I might just roll up with
Every night and then puff some trees someday
And I don't even much smoke
You know the one I hold hands with
The one I let cook for me
The one that ain't gotta look for me
She could text me right now while I'm doing this song
And I tell er engineer to stop and then leave this beat alone
The street girl that I just really wanna be with
The one I see in my dreams
The one I sit back and proud up we don't like for the schemes
The one I'd prolly grow old and have a few cute kids with
The one I'd ride or die with
I'd prolly do it big with
She the one that I just wish that I could always live with
She the reason why I be wanting to straight quit this
Rap shit, yeah she a bad bitch
But girl you be trippin
And I just be tryina tell you, that baby girl

[Chorus]
Girl when I'm on the road
I ain't gonna lie baby nuthin can compare to you (I say now baby girl)
I won't be fuckin with them chicks like that
Baby girl look I swear to you ('Cause you's my baby girl)
Girl me and you see we don't fuck
We just have some good therapy
And it's funny how I always better you
And baby you know you just better me

[Verse 2]
I drive from Miami just to be with you
Girl I'd fly from Miami just to be with you
Flew your ass down to the Bahamas just to be with you
All my other chicks trippin, cause they see me with you
But you still be trippin, you talkin about you ain't grateful
If I do cheat, I'm just gonn fuck, and put my rubber on
I don't never fuck you baby, we make love
Uh baby we make love
Uh baby we make love
In slow strokes speed up, I make sure that you nut before I nut a few times
I make sure that you come before I come a few times
I love it when get your ass on top, and your ride
Girl you's just a hell of a woman
Yea I'm tellin you woman,
That they ain't got no one to compare you to woman
Except my mama and sister and that's about all
And I can't do no redempts,
When we have sex we both gonn win
And I'm telling you

[Chorus]
Girl when I'm on the road
I ain't gonna lie baby nuthin can compare to you
I won't be fuckin with them chicks like that
Baby girl look I swear to you
Girl me and you see we don't fuck
We just have some good therapy
And it's funny how I always better you
And baby you know you just better me

[Verse 3]
See baby I ain't perfect but I'm worth it
You should stick around
I ain't the type that's gonna be passing his dick around
I know I do some wild thangs baby I'm a rockstar
I fuck your ass in the back of the cop car
Cause missus officer, missus officer
I holler we, we, we,
Like I'm Bobby V and Weezy Wee
You got me feeling so good, uh girl
See I like the way you kinda hurt
But made me see, opposites attract
So I handle that hood shit
You just make sure that you can take this good dick
I like it when you wear them lil dresses, see that impresses
All of my homies, I know that they be upon me
Like uh, your girl fine
They be wishing that they was yours
And they wishing that you was theirs
And I'm happy that you are mine, uh
And you like the way I control that spine
When I hit that ass from behind

[Outro]
You know you're my baby girl
Stop fucking and trippin, for real</pre>
