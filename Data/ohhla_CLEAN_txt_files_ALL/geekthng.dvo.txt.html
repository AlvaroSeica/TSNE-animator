[Devo Spice]
Zero, one one oh, one one
Devo Spice and Worm Quarter have got a LARP to run
Ready to take a stand for the nerdcore scene
(and to mention whatever's in between)
Gimme the gun so I can bust through this first person shooter
Paid five hundred bucks for my car and five grand for my computer
Ain't nuttin but a geek thang bay-bay
Like two Duke boys droolin over Daisy
Seein {?} doesn't faze me
Cause I mock 'em like on MST3K (hell yeah)
And uh thanks for the invitation, man
But Friday night, Doctor Who is on, I hope you understand
From a young geek's perspective
that memorizin each episode is my prime directive
And late at night my server has quite a load
It's downloadin shows, and all the while I'm dreamin in code
I tell my friends of all I've seen and they get bitter
But we never talk in person, we communicate on Twitter (yeah)
And then we argue over big technology
And pick apart the Star Wars chronology
Cause if it's good enough to cost a hundred million bucks
Maybe then can find a script that won't really suck

[Chorus]
A like this, a like that, a like this and uh
That one sucked, that's okay, that was lame and uh
I like that, but the sequel was dumb and uh
Chewbox, wield the mic like a Jedi

[Worm Quartet]
Well I'm hackin and I'm crackin and I'm frakkin
But I run out of chips, so there'll be no more snackin
Now it's time for me to go restore my health
So I grab emergency funnies from my utility belt
Never seen this particular bonus stuff
It's a super deluxe bonus extended director's cut
It's the same film that I've watched since I was 8
with 12 extra discs so I watched it for 3 days straight
It completes my collection, my protection
may be a bit much, you can look but don't touch
If you do, then this whole room
will set off more booby traps than the Temple of Doom

[Chorus]
A like this, that and this and uh
Season one was pretty good but now it's dumb and uh
And what's this? (Now who gives a crap about Lars?)
But bow down, before the new show from Jars

[Devo Spice]
Just developed a class that will return the new frontal of prime
Installed Linux on my GPS so I can play Frogger real time
But the boson array was out of phase and tainted the yield
So I reconfigured the cortical booster without a graviton field
Seniority girls and I'm under the spell
Kissin the ones with blue skin like my name was Gargamel
Yeah, and it goes on
I think I'm the mood for another Stargate marathon
So Shoebox (whattup Devo?)
These n00bies think they can pwn us (n0 w4y G!)
We gotta teach 'em a lesson (h3ll y34h)
And it's gonna be messy - TRIPLE SHOT BONUS~!

[Worm Quartet]
What I got for now those Galagas I'll rape in dust
Runnin emulation that I ported to my abacus
When I'm at the House I even mumble at the waitress
But when I'm online I can't control it like the Matrix
Pressin my big scoop and try a DOS attack
A proxy in my application, gateway's got my back
If I sniff your packet then you know I'm gonna ping ya
then your protocol stack's going down like Jenga
And then I can teach ya to make a boatload writin source code
But assembly's too simple, so now I write in morse code
Yeah, plow heads like you
But now I'm just switchin real life had a search and undo
Social butterfly makin friends like it's nothin
All you gotta do is click on the accept request button
And if you get a friend me
I should warn you like DOS I am not user friendly

[Chorus]
Like this, that and this and uh
I like that but that's enough I'm overloaded a
It's too much, I think that my head my explode
So just TiVo, the next episode</pre>
