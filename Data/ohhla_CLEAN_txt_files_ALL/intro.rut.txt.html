[Intro: Iron Mic]
Yeah, ya'll with me out there?
Listen up, I'd like to introduce ya'll too, the Ruthless Bastardz
New York's Most Wanted
It's been very long overdue, it's been a long time coming
All of my Bastardz nationwide, that's stuck it through
Is finally here, what you been waiting for
Staten Island's finest, Staten Island's best kept secret
Were here, nigga, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Iron Mic]
Straight up and down, ya'll niggas know how we do this
Live from Staten, New York, it's Ruthless
Iron Mic, is the representive
Speaking for the house, put the heaters to yor mouth
Laying that long, nigga, front, we gon' let them have it
Reach out and touch a nigga like Inspector Gadget
My lecture very graphic, dedicating to every Bastard
With no moms and pops
We ain't the flossing cats, we the starving niggas
Two favorite hobbies are, rap and robbing niggas
We throw doubts, to the softy and hardest nigga
You can't stop us, we gon' eat regardless, nigga
