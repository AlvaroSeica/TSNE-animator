[Intro - T.I. Talking]
I know it can get kinda tough sometimes you know
I know you can kinda get carried away with yourself
But err, why dont you be real with me and be real with you at the same time
You can't get what you get here no where else ma
keep it real now

[Hook]
You know, You know (you know you love this)
bitch You know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know, you love
bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know

[Verse 1]
Cavalli dress and high heels
And drop tops on hot wheels
We live how we wanna live cause we got mills
Them other niggas barely buy a hot meal
In VIP dem bottle poppin' do it B.I.G.
Come get with T.I.P be ballin' til you d-i-e
Invisible set bracelet, see clearly
Take away your stress mean that sincerely
Problem solve em, nevermind that
Girlfriend see your bag, be like where you find that?
Plus, what the fucks a pre-nup you aint got to sign that
You up take half, I'mma make it right back
I'ma mutha fuckin hustla to the heart
Whats the sense in leaving me and be back fuckin with them busters
Bentley for your birthday, Goyard Purse day
Deal with them stacks know you gotta love that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man of Respect on a big jet
With a big dick and a big check
I pop big shit, how good does it get
Ya leave me, where else you think you could get this?
Yeah, you could get another guy to beat that pussy for ya
Them niggas cowards though, and I'll take a bullet for you
Mansions, jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding
Have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations I take in consideration
I'm rough around the edges, dont bat with me and be patient
And you're sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing
My heart is RSVP I've extended an invitation
and dont go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your positions divine, don't believe look around
I got a strong mind and a kind heart
With a soft kiss but I love hard

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Don't you love this life like I love you
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Berkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, hollywood hills
Vacation in Monaco, Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
Our lifestyles so rare, you know you aint going no where
