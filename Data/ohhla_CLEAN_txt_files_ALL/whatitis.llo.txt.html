Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Lounge Lo &amp; JoJo Pellegrino]
Yo, what it is, what it is, you know a nigga
Just'll linger and popped off, his speed again
Then I head straight, to the bridge
To the bridge, through I'm carrying guns and
Running from cops, but I still gotta rep for my block
The Killa Hills, Killa Hills, where niggas be bugging
And them so-called out-of-town niggas be running
Whoa... you see me...

[Lounge Lo]
So what the deal, my peoples, clap ya hands if you with me
I bubble cracks on the warrant, until the mans come get me
I post up, right in the lobby with a baggy with a sticky
Along some real Killa Hills, man, that grind in the grizzly
Selling 58 and 12-12's, in back of the building, I'm stacking a million
You bet believe I'm packing a glizzy, you feel me?
Park Hill, Lo in the dark hill, ask the fiends
Around the way, they gonna say that my heart's real
But test my waters, I take it back where I invest in my quarters
Like you malesting my daughters
And blam up the whole damn place and kill you instantly
Then turn a gun and shoot ya man in his face, you dig?
Now kid listen; I never had a potty to piss in
And if I said that, I'm lying, cuz mommy's listening
I gather my thoughts, cook coke in the kitchen
I told Rae &amp; Ghost I push dope where I'm living
I'mma stay focused, you dig? Got to keep notice
Hocus pocus, we gamble the dice, run with the jokers
I'm a hot head, a pothead, be rolling up smokers
Crackers, dopers, bloods, Latin Kings and loc'ers

[Chorus]</pre>
