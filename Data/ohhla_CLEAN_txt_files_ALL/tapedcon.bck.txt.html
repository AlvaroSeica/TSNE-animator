Taped Conversation
The streets wanna know 
What young buck gon do
How how Young Buck gonna respond

If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

Bitch niggaz do bitch thangs
Look at 50 what he does just to get fame
Record my phone call, when I spoke from the heart
That was a year ago, this was a joke from the start
You a hoe, and I know
The only people record conversations is 5-0, so die slow
See here ya go, while you gotta chance
Let a real nigga put a band, on ya hand
Understand I don't bite the hand that feed me
But I will let the hand say it don't need me
Look at y'all on TV, Banks looks uneasy
If he told you how he feel, this is where he be
And they know yayo is stuck in your a-hole
Half of your staff only there for your pay roll
Hey TIP, lay low, you ain't gotta respond
He had the +Magic Stick+, I got the magic wand
I'm the Don

If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

Real niggaz do real thangs
Real niggaz never die and never give names
If a real niggaz cry then its real pain
So on the real my nigga I don't feel ashamed
Aint no pussy in my vein I'ma G
Witout me, y'all jus the U-N-I-T
Without B, y'all should just give it out free
Cuz in the south WE consider you WEAK
Nigga when I speak, the streets get relief
They really find the truth out about this beef
A victim of defeat when your album was released
When Jay-Z made Kanye look like a beast
BET told Jim Jones it was peace
Just trynna get some new york love at least
But they loving me 
I'm laughing at you while you worried bout me
When your punk ass response, I'ma give you verse 3 haha youll see

If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

*whistling*
Come here boy, sit booboo sit

ahh man I guess you must have forgot
every man got an emotional side to him

something bout a year ago riiiite

so yea they heard the emotion side of me
but they see the bitch nigga in you 50

cuz see like, nigga looked at you as a big brother my nigga
7 years, I mean we done made millions together nigga
i followed your lead I should say, you know
so I dealt with you from the heart nigga
i thought you dealt with me from the heart too
but now I kno.....yea....I see......the devil in disguise
we see now....the whole world see now 
and I know you thinking this shit making you look big
but you really look bad my nigga
look at what you had my nigga
