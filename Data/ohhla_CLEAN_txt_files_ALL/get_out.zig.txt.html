Song:   Get Out of Town
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around

I'm gonna catch the train I'll never play your game
My life isn't based on how much money I make
I wanna live in peace but it's hard today
There's always something trying to take it away
I rather change my situation than change who I am
Don't wanna hurt no one just to prove I'm a man
I wanna plant a little grass on a piece of land
And help this planet as best as I can

I've got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around

I don't care bout the silver I don't care bout the gold
I don't care bout the sex with a heart that so cold
Misused by abuse and refused, refused by misuse and abuse
Hey where will I go nobody know
Maybe to Maui or maybe to Fiji or maybe to Ghana where my mama lives
Or way up to the Nine-mile hills

I got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around

In this political rut oh who can you trust, Cause no ideology can ever control me
Who them you fool once, who them you fool twice
The silent majority everything's a conspiracy
Till you wake up one morning and the truth has dawned
Too late for most people they got stuck in the storm
Like a cub leaves the den a boy leaves his home
In search of a truth that must be found</pre>
