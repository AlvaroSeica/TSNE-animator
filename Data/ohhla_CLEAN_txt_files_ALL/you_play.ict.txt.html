[Intro: Trigger Tha Gambler]
AWWWWWWWWWW!! YEAH!! UHH!!
YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!!
YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!!
YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!!
YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!! YO, PUMP IT UP!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
This is it (UHH!!) dope from the fly kid
Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers you've lost, cause players you're not
Gangsters you ain't, you're fainting punk, if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo, the pusher, the player, the pimp gangster, the hustler
High Roller, Dead Pres' folder
Is cold lamping like a black king on a throne (EVIL E!!)
Montreux - turn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rolling tape
Another album to make - (GREAT!!)
Islam turn the bass, kick up a bit
Hype the snare, now, I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his 'llac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science? - You're dumb (YOU'RE DUMB!!)
Stupid ignorant, don't even talk to me
In school you dropped Math, Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well, let me tell you one thing, you got a heart (YOU GOT A HEART!!)
To perpetrate your bait and just wait
Til the Press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy? (THE BIG DADDY!!)
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now, why not?
You start to sweat and fret and get hot
Yo, how they get into this spot?

[Trigger Tha Gambler]
YOU PLAYED YOURSELF!!
COME ON!! EVERYBODY SAY YEAH!!
YOU PLAYED YOURSELF!!
OH! YEAH!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L
When it comes to dealing with the females (FEMALES!!)
What you got they want, cash is what they need
Slip sucker, and they'll break you with speed
But you meet a freak, you try to turn her out
Spending money is what I'm talking about
But you fooled out, your pockets got blew out
And after The Show, no boots, you got threw out
Mad and shook, cause your dockets got took (UHH!!)
You call her up, phone is off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip?
You can't buy no relationship
You played yourself

[Trigger Tha Gambler]
YOU PLAYED YOURSELF!!
COME ON!! EVERYBODY!!
YOU PLAYED YOURSELF!!

[Ice-T]
Ain't nobody else's fault
YOU PLAYED YOURSELF!!</pre>
