[Trey Songz]
So this whole thing is like hypothetical right?
Hehe - you want to be a boy, and all that
I got you...

First things first I'm a man in this shhh
Smoke that purp you can handle this shhh
Wanna play games I'm end this one quick
It ain't just one side in this love flick
You can sag your pants like me (like me)
Fo'-fo's, two hands like me (like me)
But what I never get is continous (bullshit)
Is you gon' leave, or is you gon' kick it?
Oh it's on me now, we gon' switch it
You know I got a thang for them big butt (bitches)
And I ain't tryin to say I'm right cause I'm wrong
to tag you along, but it's only so long
you can ring the alarm, sing me a song
It ain't the sex you love, bring me the bong
Jack in the box, question is
Is he a dog? Yes he is
I ain't even givin you no extra shhh
You know the rest of this, so what the question is?

[Chorus: Ciara]
What if I had a thing on the side?
Made you cry, would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I, played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy
(I ain't gettin mad, I can handle that)
(I ain't gettin mad, I can handle that)

[Ciara]
Girl go ahead and be just like him
Go run the streets just like him
Go home missin sleep like 'em, creep like 'em
Front with your friends, act hard when you with 'em like him
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an airtight alibi
Keep it hid in the dark
What he don't know won't break his heart
Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be bad
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?
Cause I'm out, fo' in the morning
On the corner rollin, doin my own thing

[Chorus]

[Ciara]
If I was always gone
With the sun gettin home (would you like that?)
I told you I was with my crew
when I knew it wasn't true (would you like that?)
If I act like you
Walked a mile off in your shoes (would you like that?)
Messing with yo' head again
Dose of your own medicine

[Chorus]

[Ciara]
R-A go
Here's the clutch...
If I played you - would you like that?)
Had friends - would you like that?)
Never called back - would you like that?)
Nah nah, ou wouldn't like that, No!
What if I, made you cry
Would they still apply
If I, played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy...

Can't handle that</pre>
