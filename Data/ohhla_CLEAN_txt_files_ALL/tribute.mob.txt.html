Nigga we don't chase money, we make money

Keep ya eyes on ya enemies, and watch ya friends

(Hook, Krazy)
Louie V shoes, camouflage pants
I'm too thugged out, so a nigga don't dance
Tank dog this, and tank dog that
Shawty say she love it face down from the back
Louie V shoes, camouflage pants
I'm too thugged out, so a nigga don't dance
Tank dog this, and tank dog that
Shawty say she love it face down from the back
(Master P)
Uhh
I ain't no killa, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest thang next to gettin pussy
No Limit gon' ride or diiieee, ride or diiieee
Laaa-laaa-laaa-laaa-laaa-laaa
Uhh
I ain't no killa, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest thang next to gettin pussy
No Limit gon' ride or diiieee, ride or diiieee
Laaa-laaa-laaa-laaa-laaa-laaa

(Verse 1, Master P)
Put you under for Pac
Tell these niggas we hot
I had chilled for a minute, but I'm back to the block!
I had murdered the game, I get better with time
You niggas think I'ma lose!?
Then you bitches are blind!!
I come from nothin to somethin! I just play wit'chu niggas...
Whole 'nother tax bracket, I don't stay wit'chu niggas
Menace 2 Society, crazy like Kane!
Revenge my nigga!
Got the money, didn't change
Cause I'm a beast when I meet 'em, you fall in love when you greet 'em
I tell them bitches I love 'em and then I fuck 'em and leave 'em!
That new Roley, I got it
Took the ki and I hide it
No papers on my pistol, I might catch me a body

(Hook, Krazy)

(Verse 2, Krazy)
I got a warrant out, so I'm layin low
Kick in the trap and put them fuckin haters on the floor
Eastwood, got 'em poppin, that's in California
My No Limit clique is stronger than A-fuckin-monia
Ruby, Hosin and C flex in Angola
My homie, couldn't be limp and lace, dog gettin swoller
Face down, ass up; I'll blow her back out
Rum; Full of kush, that's why I blacked out
I keep that automatic on me, I don't never slip
I'ma hold it down, nigga for the blunts and grips
Or a GD gangsta, or a Vice Lord
I'm a Arenzville soldier and I die hard

(Hook, Krazy)

(Verse 3, Fat Trel)
Louie-Louie-Louie
Louie shirt, Guccie block
I think I'ma need some help
Got Versaci on my frame
Bitches know my middle name
Slutty boy, gang bang
Ain't no limit to my clip
Thirty shots on my hip
You gon' need a bigger clip
Bitches say I'm crazy, I say that I'm insane
I pay my lawyer thirty, if I'm guilty he gon' hang
That mean he the same, bang him out his brains
Switch it with my pivot, my bullets sick in ya vain
Think it's bout to rain so you know I dropped the body
Braggin on the phone, I got money bitch, I'm Gotti
Ask me how I got it, I was robbin everybody
I was fuckin with that Ecstacy and fuckin with that Molly
