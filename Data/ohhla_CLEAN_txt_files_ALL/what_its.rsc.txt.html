[Intro - Rasco]
What it's all about..
Yeah yeah..
What it's all about..
What it's all about..
Yeah yeah..
What it's all about..
That's how it is, Rasco..
Bout to rep the bz's nigga please..

[Verse 1 - Rasco]
Set the post, it be Rasco from up close
Emcees that's rotten can get the full dose
The hoes, that came to butter your work toast
This emcees be tried just ask themselves: why?
Reply and no kil' and no I don't get high
It's just not my thing just tryin' to get by
I stutter step like rats no cool gats
Frenchise my brother this man can pull stacks
Perhaps, your plan to go plat' just went splat
Your one million plus was fools you couldn't trust
I bust, like bubbles and trouble from penpoints
You drank down some liquor then smoked like ten joints
Please, get out of my face I spits mase
Where hip hop is comin' to rush your whole place
Face, the lyrics that shut your whole case
First out of the box and still lost the whole race
Disgrace, niggaz with vigour that pull triggers
Some catch your body then big turns to bigger
Forget it, and bring your best to get with it
I pulled down my pants on emcees and shitted
For real, I blast off lyrics the real deal
It's strictly hip hop ain't got that rap feel
We peel caps on cats that set traps
And I respect women that write they own raps
Retreat, we gunnin' you down from ten feet
You wrote down some lyrics then jacked like ten beats
Discrete never whatever got it together
And rain down on niggaz in any types of weather
We bring it and come in the door bounce to rigid
I do my own thing and don't need hoes to sing it
But check we cuttin' your verse to small specks
Set to get down ain't that's a Ampax, what's next

[Hook: Rasco]
"What it's all about"
Soul brother Ras' came to diss you fools
"What it's all about"
Plus you clowns that think you too cool
"What it's all about"
Get your pens and pads it's time for school
"What it's all about"
Take another rap

[Verse 2: Rasco]
Over the hill, plus I'm wanted like fifth wheels
There goes your deal you've had your last thrill
But still must inspect your mic check
And those with no skills I must disrespect
Regret, nothin' in life don't live trife
Ain't killed nobody ain't stole no man's wife
But twice, brothers tried to roll the dice
Niggaz crabbed out and had to pay the price
Precise and nice on mics that on take hights
Break out your boots it's time to stack loot
But shoot, brothers ain't tryin' to feel this
Somebody come bogus I come with realness
Excist believin' they got this mad piss
Ain't nobody above the club of gettin' dissed
We twist and plus my style be topless
And broke up your wrist for tryin' to test this
We miss nothing in sight and stay as tight
Rethought my game, works hard and break nights
We blast plus the Ras' be first class
Dropped my first single and made my first cash
Your ass is gettin' dug out for rugs out
So fuck the gun chatter I'll knock you thugs out
About to end this verse ain't nothing worse
Then seein' emcees drove off inside the hearse

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rasco]
Triple the threat plus you placed your last bet
Thought you seen it all this ain't been done yet
Confetti slice that ass and get ready
And tag along Freddie's I came to rock steady
But Frank knows how I gas my own tank
Make a show live, put cash up in the bank
So crank whenever I spit some nice shit
I bought my killer team my team can slice shit
In facted ofcourse the Ras' be baldheaded
You wrote all them lies but didn't get the credit
I said it and only like legs once they spread it
When fools run they jibbs I came down and dead it
We get it, like givin' a fuck self destruct
I heard ya first 12; Oh well that shit sucked
Believe it, the jam that keeps the spot heated
I ran down some rhymes your crew got mistreated
Complete it the Ras on pace without a trace
And turn up the bass so fools canget a taste
It's finished and now the rhyme's been replinished
My team undefeated on point without a blimish
We champs you better deploy your whole camp
We fresh of them guts like women with mad cramps
So lamp to beats that sounded quite sweet
And what it's all about you fools can't compete
Bring the heat
