Song:   Song For Britney
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Britney, I can feel your sadness
The world is filled with madness
And everybody takes it out on you
And there's nothing you can do

But girl I want you to know
that I'm not one of those
Because I don't care what they all say
I'd still have sex with you any day

Any day

Britney, nobody really knows you
Yet, they all think they can judge you
Although I'm not a fan of your music
The way they treat you girl, it makes me sick

Just know that I can hear your cries
And I still love to get between those thighs
Because I don't care what they all say
I'd still have sex with you any day

Any day

And if you want to marry me
As long as I don't have to sign a pre-nup
I agree

'cause I don't care what they all say
No, I don't care what they all say
I'd still tap that ass any day</pre>
