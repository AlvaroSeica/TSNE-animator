"Global controls will have to be imposed
 and a world governing body, will be created to enforce them.
 Crises, precipitate change.."

[Del]
Secretly.. plotting your demise

I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I want to make a super virus
Strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis
Cause they dont wanna unify us
So fuck it total anarchy and can't nobody stop us

You see late in the evening
Fucked up on my computer and my mind starts roaming
I create like a heathen
The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem
Infiltration hits your station
No Microsoft or enhanced DOS will impede
Society thinks thier safe when
Bingo!  Hard drive crashes from the rending
A lot of hackers tried viruses before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where a file replication is a chore
Lights out shut down entire White House
I don't want just a bug that could be corrected
I'm erecting immaculate design
Break the nation down section by section
Even to the greatest minds it's impossible to find

[Repeat 2X]
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus

[Kid Koala scratching:]
"We have already planned.."
"The plan is programmed into every one of my thousand rrrobots.."
"We will not hesitate; we will destroy the" -- "Homosapien!"
"Please, stay where you are.."

(Psst ay, I'm makin some shit in my basement
 Bout to do it to 'em, don't tell 'em though
 Alright I love you, peace)

I want to develop a super virus
Better by far than that old Y2K
This is 3030 the time of global unification
Break right through they.. terminals
Burn 'em all, slaves to silicon
Curupt politicians with leaders and their keywords
F.B.I and spys stealin bombs
Decipitate their plans in thier face and catch the fever
Everybody loot the stores get your canned goods
Even space stations are having a hard time
Peacekeeepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global apartheid
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploding and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the database or break through 'em
Human rights come in a hundreth place
Mass production has always been number one
New Earth has become a repungnant place
So it's time to spread the fear to thunder some

[Kid Koala scratching:]
"Too long have we tried
 to extend our glorious empire out to the stars.."
"Only to be drive back.."

[Repeat 2X]
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus</pre>
