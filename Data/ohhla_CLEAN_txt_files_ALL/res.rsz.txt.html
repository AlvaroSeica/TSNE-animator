Verse:
Ive been drowned out by the rain
Still im wishing i could stay
But im sorry my old friend
Ive got to leave you once again
And despite what i might say
I measure pleasure by the pain
Measure pleasure by the twisting
Of the metal in the vein
And it might be very hard
Cant be more than what we are
Cant be more till its over

Chorus:
Here comes the resurrection
Everybodys got to die from something
Nothing ever left to leave you when you go
I saw you strip my babies
Animal the way you cut them might be
Animal the way i cut you from below
  
Verse:
So you goad me into spite
Its the cruelty that youd like
Its the waiting for the one thing
That you never could define
Fill the longing just because
Emasculate the ones you love
Have to wait till its over
We are the less than mighty
Never was a way i thought it could be
Never quite enough to leave you when you go
I saw you strip my babies
Animal the way you cut them might be
Animal the way i cut you from below
Ive been drowned out by the rain
Still im wishing i could stay
But im sorry my old friend
Ill have to leave you once again
And despite what i might say
I measure pleasure by the pain
Measure pleasure by the twisting
Of the metal in the vein
And it might be very hard
Cant be more than what we are
Cant be more when its over
  
Chorus:
Here comes the resurrection
Everybody wants to die for something
Never thought id live to leave you when you go
I saw you strip my babies
Animal the way we cut them might be
Animal the way we cut them from below
And if anger is the ending
for the thing that weve become
For the mother and the father
And the sister and the son
Through the shallow without wanting
Realization to mistake
Through the ugliness
The open all the things we cant replace
I will control
I will control
I will control          </pre>
