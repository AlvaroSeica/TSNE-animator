(Intro, Juicy J &amp; [DJ Scream])
Hey, hey [Juicy J!] 
Hey, hey, hey [Project Pat!]
Yes, I'm smokin weed; ALWAYS! 
[Alley boy] Pussy! [Hood rich ho!]

(Hook x2, Juicy J)
I'm ridin with that package, so I gotta stay strapped (Yes sir!)
I ain't tryin to catch that baggage, so I gotta strapped (No, sir!)
Wit' two 9's to your chest; We gon' call you Warren Sapp
For you rats; that's tryin'a take cheese from the trap (Pow!)

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
I got dope in the whip and a groupie ho on my dick (Bitch!)
These ho's ain't in love wit' me; They in love wit' my chips (Bitch!)
No seatbelt is strapped; But I got a strap in my lap (You know it!)
Got rats comin for my cheese; They gon' run cross my trap [Gunshots]
Money on your head; But you ain't gon' need a cap (Yes sir!)
Put your ass to sleep; Take a permanent nap (Ho!)
I got plenty of tools (Ho!)
But I don't play wit' 'em (Ho!)
I go to sleep wit' all my bitches; Yeah, I lay wit' 'em (Ho!)
Homie, I'm always strapped (You know it!)
Like a Green Beret (Mmhmmm)
In my cup, I got that lean; That's "That Drank"
Some of my niggas trappers (Yup!)
Some of 'em crooks (Yup!)
If you think we ain't bout to bust; You dumb as you look [Gunshot]

(Hook x2, Juicy J)
I'm ridin with that package, so I gotta stay strapped (Yes sir!)
I ain't tryin to catch that baggage, so I gotta strapped (No, sir!)
Wit' two 9's to your chest; We gon' call you Warren Sapp
For you rats; that's tryin'a take cheese from the trap (Pow!)

(Verse 2, Alley Boy)
I got nine shots; Not Warren Sapp
All the heroin on my block got junkies runnin left
We ride around with that strap; Nigga checkin traps
All these bright ass niggas eatin; So we finna snap
You gettin money, so we takin money
But ain't lookin for it; Go'on snitchin onions
Start runnin; Hear that thang humming
Hear that thang humming; Nigga, start runnin
Ain't gon' chase ya, but I'm gon get'cha
Your homeboys; they goin wit'cha
This a re-action; Malt liquor
Young niggas; Got triggers
Cold blood laid his ass out
All the little niggas on the one-fifty
They the ones that had the clout
We the ones that had to go hard, and lay niggas heads in laps before the raps
And tryin'a take cheese from the trap

(Hook x2, Juicy J)
I'm ridin with that package, so I gotta stay strapped (Yes sir!)
I ain't tryin to catch that baggage, so I gotta strapped (No, sir!)
Wit' two 9's to your chest; We gon' call you Warren Sapp
For you rats; that's tryin'a take cheese from the trap (Pow!)

(Verse 3, Project Pat)
I'm after the cheese; After the green
Call it "Trap Kermit"
Straight hoppin; Pistol poppin
We ain't got no permits
Been up in here for four or five days
Call me "Hood Hermit"
Came short on bread like Henry on "Good Times"
Had to burn him
Now, that's gonna learn him
You pancake niggas mouths flips
Banana chopper; turn you niggas cherries and banana splits
Gettin head like a "Fitted Cap" from your baby moms
Make him mad; Now he wanna do a pimp bodily harm
Project born; hood raised
Double-barrel in ya face
I'm on some rubber-band business; Juicy J
Automatic guns; Paper sacks full of presidents
Every shell wiped off; I ain't leavin evidence

(Hook x1, Juicy J)
I'm ridin with that package, so I gotta stay strapped (Yes sir!)
I ain't tryin to catch that baggage, so I gotta strapped (No, sir!)
Wit' two 9's to your chest; We gon' call you Warren Sapp
For you rats; that's tryin'a take cheese from the trap (Pow!)</pre>
