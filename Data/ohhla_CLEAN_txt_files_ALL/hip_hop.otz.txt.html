[Joell Ortiz]
Yo do me a favor, accidently step on your white sun glasses
We don't wear those over here this is hip hop(that's right)
This is Carhart jackets, Timberland boots, unlaced
This is Champion hoodies, chicken wings and french fries
RIP pieces on the handball court, this is us still fightin' police brutality
This is hip hop

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryin' to bring New York back
I'm just a breath of fresh air, that good old New York rap
Slick talk to the track, come on who brought that to the game
Grafitti all on the train, get up your name I don't feel how I used to feel
I'm in my 20's so a new Nas joint used to give me the chills
In the barber shop tryin' to cop a new hot tape
Them Rob lowes is crazy the doo wop's greatest hip hop(hip hop)
And yes I'm a fan first if you from the south, finger snap till your hands hurt
If you from the west W's in the air, if you from the east coast act like you from here
The good old two step, the classic head nod
The thirsty iced grill, who wants to get robbed?
That was the energy in the club, on the real
That was the energy that I love, aww man

[Chorus]
This is hip hop, hands up if you forever a fan of hip hop
I wake up hip hop, go to sleep hip hop
Dream about hip hop, 'cause I am hip hop, aww man
This is hip hop, hands up if you forever a fan of hip hop
I wake up hip hop, go to sleep hip hop
Dream about hip hop, 'cause I am hip hop

[Verse 2]
I ain't tryin' make you dance I just rip beats but the
Soul in my voice, give you quick feet
I don't know what it's like to not dig deep
When I'm holding this mic I don't just speak, pipsqueak
The tides come in and the earth shakes
200 hundred mile an hour winds I'm your worst fate, birthdate
July 6th 1980 how can your age even matter when you rhyme this crazy, aww man
I gotta thank the lord 'cause with this pen in my hand
I don't think that hard it just happens
Wrist action classic in the makin'
I kick back and just laugh I'm  happy I'm amazing
Look at me gaze into my eyes, see the poverty?
Now understand why me and this music just gotta be?
It's something that's inside of me and I can't shake it
So I embrace it, and let y'all taste it, aww man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Somethin' happen to may body when that track smokin'
Y'all swim more wilder than me, I be backstrokin'
I'm the best and my fans'll second that notion
I'll be the last man standing with my back broken
Crack open a couple of fortys Celebrate Mijo
My competition, man they squared in the H3
I run cricles around them like a skate key
And turn your little buzz into "Yo, whatever happened..?
So don't play B I ain't talking shit
I just got a awful gift, that'll make your office doors just stiff
They won't open so no braggin' and no boastin' while I'm hungry
Matter fact, don't do that when I got a lot of money
Yup, I'm feelin' myself, that sound right
You gotta step in that ring like, listen I'll pound Mike
You gotta step on that court like, I could hold down Mike
The way I step on that stage and have the whole crowd like, aww man

[Chorus]</pre>
