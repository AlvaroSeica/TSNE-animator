[ CHORUS ]
We're all in the human race
Everybody gotta have a little space
We're all in the human race
It's not the color of the skin on your face	(2X)

We're all in the human race
Everybody gotta have a little space

[ Precise ]
All people are blessed with the human face
It's not a game, we're the same in this human race
Everyone is equal, we all got a mind
But the ways of today you'd think we're all blind
Anti-segregation, and I beg a nation
Listen to my song, be strong cause my creation
You were made like me
And that is what we've all got to see
Cause it's not gettin better, it's just gettin worse
All I ask is that you listen to my verse

[ CHORUS ]

[ Exact ]
Ideas of the Eighties I'm doubtin
It may be useless, but I'm shoutin
A man in a band cold takin a stand
I got a plan for my land and it's here in my hand
You see, it's real simple, I lay it on the line
Every person is equal, everyone in mankind
So why all the racial tension?
And not only that, I think I'll mention
Apartheid, and the trouble overseas
Point blank, racism is a killer disease
That's spreadin, I'm frettin where we goin
But to the end we should all die knowin
That every man was created the same
With a different mind and a different name
A different personality, a different face
Yet all variations of the human race

[ CHORUS ]

[ Precise ]
Now sittin alone I roam through my mind
To a time when I could unwind
With my girl, the world would be a better place
If we didn't have to think about the color of our face
See ah, you know you want it and I do too
So come on, people, what you gonna do?
Just come together and say it loud
Let the whole world know we're strong and proud

We're all in the human race
Everybody gotta have a little space

We're all in the human race
Everybody gotta have a little space
We're all in the human race
It's not the color of the skin on your face

We're all in the human race

We're all in the human race</pre>
