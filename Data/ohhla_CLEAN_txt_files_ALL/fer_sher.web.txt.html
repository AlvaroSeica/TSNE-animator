Song:   Fer Sher
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Say that's fer sher
And that's fer sher
That's fer sher
That's fer sher

I'm a beast
(That's fer sher)
Kill a beat
(That's fer sher)
Spittin' heat
'Cause you know I play for keeps
(That's fer sher)
Rap nice
(That's fer sher)
Plus I'm white
(That's fer sher)
Just give me the mic
I'm a kill it
Damn right
(That's fer sher)

I'm a punch line protege
Dope?
Yo, I gotta be
Spit it and flip it
And get 'em jumpin' like a wallaby
But I ain't no Rocko's Modern Life
Still these kids are watching me
Sicker than pathology
I'll vomit on you
Probably

Keep rhythm like Tommy Lee
Now tell me
Who's stopping me?
So everybody stand up
Get them hands up like a robbery
I'm a hot commodity
Bangin' bitches condom free
Chuggin' bottles till I'm more fucked up
Than the economy

Mic check
One two
One two
Three four five six seven eight nine
I generate rhymes
I don't live in state lines
Spit so sharp
I can penetrate spines

I rap fer sher
With a bag of the herb
Yes sir
Observing
Actual words
And I rap from the curb
To my pad in the burbs
I'm a bull moving up from the back of the herd

I'm a beast
(That's fer sher)
Kill a beat
(That's fer sher)
Spittin' heat
'Cause you know I play for keeps
(That's fer sher)
Rap nice
(That's fer sher)
Plus I'm white
(That's fer sher)
Just give me the mic
I'm a kill it
Damn right
(That's fer sher)

Said that's fer sher
When I come and show up right at your door
Smack your jaw
Got you drinkin' dinner through a plastic straw
Rap it raw
Speaking hard
Caption, just put me in charge
I'm a treat 'em like astronomers
They'll be seeing stars

A rap flower
Take your chick and bend her back over
'Cause I hit more pussy
Than abusive cat owners
Never catch my ass sober
I'm always passed out
And yeah your girl's a dime
Well mine's a half ounce

I hit a track
Bounce
Rip it when I speak slow
I'm just a wild boy
You could call me Steve-O
With a mean flow
Rockin' my jeans low
Reppin' the burbs
To the fullest
That's where I be, bro

'Cause I'm a dog
I shop at Petco
See?
I'm just a greasy ass white boy
S-O-B
Hot comerda
Rock n' roll
To a techno beat
With a weed sack
Stickier than a gecko's feet

Gee
Girlies can't help themselves
Lookin' at the kid
'Cause I'm so damn hot
They gotta put my in the fridge
You heard
That's my word
Chris Webby be the illest mother fucker in the burbs
And yes
That is fer sher

I'm a beast
(That's fer sher)
Kill a beat
(That's fer sher)
Spittin' heat
'Cause you know I play for keeps
(That's fer sher)
Rap nice
(That's fer sher)
Plus I'm white
(That's fer sher)
Just give me the mic
I'm a kill it
Damn right
(That's fer sher)

Yeah
It's Chris Webby
And that's fer sher...</pre>
