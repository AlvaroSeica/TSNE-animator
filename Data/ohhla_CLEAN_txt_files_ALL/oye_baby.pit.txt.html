[Intro: Pitbull]
Nicola Fasano - I hope I said that right
Mr. Three-oh-Five - or better said Mr. Worldwide
Oh-nine was ours, and we gon' do it again
But like we said one mo' gen

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Oye baby (oye baby) get closer (get closer)
I wanna love ya (I wanna love ya) like I'm supposed to (like I'm supposed to)
Oye baby (oye baby) get closer (get closer)
I wanna love ya (I wanna love ya) like I'm supposed to - la, la, la
{*4X*} Oye baby (oye baby) I wanna love ya (I wanna love ya) {*4X*}
La, la, la

[Pitbull]
Pit this, Pit that
Yeah Pit switched, yeah Pit's whack
Now they like "Pit can you jump on this track?"
Yeah, kiss my Pit ass~! Ha ha
I showed them haters that oh-nine was mine
and took over the world
But forget about me, baby what's up?
Yeah, come over here girl

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
I'm out for the dead presidents
Yeah, I used to move pounds
Now I get paid in pounds and euros
Cuban judo; oh ju dunno, ju dunno?
Pit's worldwide now, three-oh-five
around the globe yeah, fo'sho mami
I can see it in your eyes
It's been a while since you had a good time, right?

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Hey sexy let me feel you, let me touch you, let me kiss you baby

[Outro: repeat 2X]
This for the DJ's that show me love - bet that up
This for the mami's that shake in the club - what's up?</pre>
