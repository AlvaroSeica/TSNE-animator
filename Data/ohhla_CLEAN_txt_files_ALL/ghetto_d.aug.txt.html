Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I love the way you keep them heels on
Hair ain't yours but it's paid for and it's real long
Show them tattoos when you switch it up
With your J's on
And you got ass so fat that I can't help but Feel On
And you keep it real when it comes to having sex
Girl you don't ever flex
Long as I fuck you good
You ain't worried bout what's next
That's why I keep you here
You ain't like them other hoes
Cause you the fucking best
Just in case you didn't know

[Bridge]
Cause you ain't got
A half a million dollar condo
And you ain't got
A hundred thousand dollar car
But you got a billion dollar body
Trust me I know
You keep it hood no matter where you are

[Chorus]
Cause you come from the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
You're the type I like
That's why I keep you right you off the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
Ain't afraid to let it show
Baby, go on let them know
You out the ghetto
Better let 'em know,
You from the ghetto
Better let 'em know
Girl you are the ghetto
Better let 'em know
Better let 'em know
You are that G-H-E-TT-O

You hold it down
And you never let them haters
Come around, girl that's why I keep you on speed dial
Just in case some shit get bad
Keep that ratchet in your bag and a little cash
Just in case I need you
If they locked me down I know I'd see you
That's without a doubt
I know you understand how it go
But you're still down for the ride and
That's why I still keep you by my side

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Rich Homie Quan]
She G-H-E-TT-O
My little buddy, my little hoe
Been fucking with her since I was in high school
She had my heart and secrets too
She born and raised in the projects
Never listen what other guys said
She been going through some shit
I can tell ( how you know?) because her eyes red
Her heart hurt, it's been beat up
I wanna start over, don't mislead ya
I cross my heart like I pledge allegiance
I give my all if you don't leave me
She G-H-E-TT-O
I love that shit
Cause you never see her with money
Don't mean she broke
(She got own stack nigga)
Yeah!
Shawty down with my pimping
Shawty know how it goes
Shawty know her position and shawty play her role
Got August in here with me
And I can rap it acapella
I'd fuck with you lil' baby
Even though you from the ghetto

[Chorus]</pre>
