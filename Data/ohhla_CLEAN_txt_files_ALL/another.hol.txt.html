[Charlie Scene &amp; Danny]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, I wish there was another way out

[Charlie Scene]
Voices won't go away
They stay for days and days
They say some awful things, ways to make you fade away
I don't think no one's home
And we're just here alone
I better find you first, before you find the phone

[Charlie Scene &amp; Danny]
You better run, better run, better run, yeah I'm coming after you
When you're sleeping at night, yeah there's nothing you can do
There's no place you can hide cause I'm coming after you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you

[Chorus (Danny)]
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out

[Funny Man]
You go up check and see
No one cares less than me
Dead wrong I guess you'll be
These voices won't let you leave
Got you down on bending knee
What should my next weapon be?
It's over you can't breathe
Just sit down, rest with me

[Charlie Scene &amp; Danny]
You better run, better run, better run, yeah I'm coming after you
When you're sleeping at night, yeah there's nothing you can do
There's no place you can hide cause I'm coming after you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you

[Chorus (Danny)]
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out

[Danny]
Break you down, now put it back together again
I'll break you down, now put it back together again
Break you down, now put it back together again
I'll break you down, now put it back together again

[Chorus (Danny)]
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out </pre>
