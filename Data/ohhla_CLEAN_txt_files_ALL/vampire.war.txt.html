[Intro: Warcloud]
Warcloud, alias Alcatraz
Fuck your bitch in the graveyard late night like Pretty Wolf
They catch your madness power, watching Elviro, will it vanish early
Crack your head with a Wu-Tang bat
My ancestors spoke the Iroquoian language
That is Cherokee, some spoke in Muskogee
That is chalk to all your weak niggas chichoco
Stupid Tenderfoot, I gut your brain with a hook
Stupid Tenderfoot, I gut your brain with a hook

[Chorus 2X: Warcloud]
Came to kill the champ there ain't even nobody with you
Heavy blade kiss you, the SuperPatriot century
Son you move noisily, box office the 'Gun Play'
Old Legend of Dead Horse, dirty Wu 'Vampire Kung-Fu'

[Warcloud]
I live in a hollowed out asteroid it's Warcloud
Better living through circuitry, Palaeolithic surgery
Half man, half planet Mercury, I hurt MC's
One day it rained and then people began to melt
Assassination, I sent an agent in a nation of Masons
To slay a third of Earth's population from vindication
A dirty helicopter, my blades are my swords
When it descends upon you the sound of a zillion chariots
'Nightmare Room', old truth 'cause this is scariest
And every island fled away and the mountains were not found
Shadowless zombie swordsmen, chills
Swoop up on you and launch your head in the hills
Sword mechanic tragic, mastermind Jurassic
Laughing out lumber, leave you bloody construction yards
Shattered spirit shields with lyric fields
Of one armed Ghost Samurai from the past that murdered ungodly
The thunder struck oddly, I blast a dusty shotty
Freak gazed hideous, slump your carcass the prettiest
Angry wood cutters, soda fish, motion switch
Blizzard kicks brain, sound waves and astounds slaves
Dirty mull and meat market massacre, mirage
Crash like the 'Hammer of the Gods' and leave you lodged
Under heavy doors explore these warlords
Mystic paradise, my axe closet with shovels in it
Nine million ninjas fall on you with lightsabers
Cannibalistic neighbours, 'Ghost Pirates' and heartless raiders
'Old Gator Man' who is seldom seen
He lives in a cave made of moths with dusty wings

[Chorus 2X]

[Warcloud]
'Odds Against Tomorrow', we sat at separate tables
With rats the size of rhinoceros in the stables
The silly old man went and hung himself with a cable
They found him with his shoes on the wrong foot, a fable
The skinny little pimp had cut her face with a straight razor
Girl from the gutter, I murdered another
We went in 'The Ocean' and we began to argue
I left bloody and blood flooded the water
Mean man Alcatraz Grey overachieving
Leaves in the sunshine, dirty shovels for evening
Starsky and Hutch met Cagney &amp; Lacey
The bloody old man meat market wasn't hasty
The rhyme was kind of pasty, great like Yogi Berra
While Arab Nomads pitched their tents in the Sahara
He had lit cigarettes for eyes
Golden unicycles, seals playing harmonicas
I laugh as I smoke on the hillside
Gun in the grass, get at me and we can still ride
I might sip a beer at Muldoon's Saloon
The man who left cigar smoke throughout the room
Straighten niggas up like the Clan, we witty black skinheads
Pissing in mugs, bury whore in your nigga graveyard
Your happiness is a love jewel, Hell jewel and right jewel
Bite through, twice cruel, bite, snipe you on a mic duel
Seduced by madness and gathering madness in the mouth of madness
Outstanding madness, candlelit madness, lucrative fugitive
A hungry nation now, now nation or end cycle
'Smugglin' Booze in the Graveyard' with a rifle
Might full, delightful, tossed vital collateral force, lost soldier
Glitchy explosion, pitfall, Alcatraz 'Jigsaw Puzzle'
I'll snuff you

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Warcloud]
Warcloud
My raps is like zoo books in the dark with misfits
Twist tank barrels in the bowl, send them for Christmas</pre>
