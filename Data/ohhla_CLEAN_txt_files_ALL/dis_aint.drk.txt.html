Song:   Dis Ain't What U Want
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Tell me what's it gon' be, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so this ain't what you want
I'm on the road doing shows somewhere, this ain't what you want
Cause the road you can go I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up we get a dark car, this ain't what you want

[Verse 1]
Niggas claim that they're after me, but this ain't what they want
Cause I hopped into this industry, this ain't what they want
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, this ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, this ain't what they want
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck Breaking News and ABC
I can't do no shows cause I terrify my city, they say I terrify my city
Niggas get shot, you're the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, you're the first one to get changed
They say you snitch, tryna put dirt on my name
They rat on me ask is Lil Durk my name

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Daddy doin' life, snitches doin' months
I'm screamin' free the real cause this ain't what you want
A nigga claim 300, add a K you done
I'm really in the field cause this is what I want
I'mma turn the streets up, this is anthem
Niggas hate on my squad, I tell 'em step they shit up
Same since day one and I can't take change up
After all of the gossip, I still chase em'
Fuck niggas ain't want nothin', they ain't want it
Same niggas since day one, nigga I'm 300

[Chorus]</pre>
