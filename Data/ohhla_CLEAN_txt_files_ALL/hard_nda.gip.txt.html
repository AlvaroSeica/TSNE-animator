[Boy]
This a Nitti beat!

[Chorus: Ali &amp; Gipp (Nelly)]
When I pull up in the club
I'm goin hard in the paint
(I'm goin) hard in the paint
(I'm goin) hard in the paint
and when I step up in the 'morn
I'm goin hard in the paint
(I'm goin) hard in the paint
(I'm goin) hard in the paint
and when I creep up out the club
they say that's not right
(ya see they say) that's not right
(ya see they say) that's not right
and when I leave up out the 'morn
they say that's not right
(ya see they say) that's not right
(ya see they say) that's not right

[Hook: Nelly (girl)]
I betcha bikes ain't louda than mine
(tell 'em daddy)
I betcha rims ain't higher than mine
(tell 'em daddy)
I betcha pockets ain't fatter than mine
(tell 'em daddy)
I betcha chick ain't as bad as mine
(kill 'em daddy)

(Verse 1: Gipp)
Shorty Scripe Young Scripe
Even Gipp got 4
krispy kreme in the paint
chrome on the toes
Stoufers out the AC, 4-5 Doors and I
never leave the club less it's 4-5...(That's right)
Money hungry hustlers
real-estate investers
Get the fuckin friend
like he'll never be a customer
Dougy fresh clean
on the scene chokin' Irene
We don't do relationships
we'd rather have a Plain
my jeans and my shoes worth
more than your green
40-thousand in the car
keep 'em closer at hand
Watch the stone in my ear
make the hoes go "Dang!"
and the women love me
cuz they know who I am

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nelly (Jermaine Dupri)]
I'm gettin high in my
damned DeVille
Creepin' slow on up that hill
Get to the top to stun 'em J
We ride 'em down to Smash Hill
look at ma now this the deal
while I go deep like Navy Seals
Then I like to Dissapurre
Like I'm David Copperfield
Man, Please, I'm 1 of the realist in rap!
Thats right if I could I'd go broke
When I'm 1 of 5 stats
If you didn't well now you know
just Cock it back and let it Go
My muscle cars is so strong
The liscense say "BOWCO"
Ya get it? my liscense plate
reads, "BOWCO"
(Damn! His liscense plate Read BOWCO)
Home-town rider
St. louis Resider
Dig in my Backyard you might just find a geyser
Garage look like priza
Motors I aint Jokin'
Check my Chick she smokin'
she sick with it from
St. Louis to Oakland

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ali]
It's not a game
but I'ma still play in the streets
Ball hard 'till I fall
seven days of the week
On monday I'ma get up
and turn down the mall
Chick with some dantley
Puffy booty look small
On Tuesday I'ma Fall throught Paul's Shop
Drop 100 putin' shoes on Armor drop
Wednesday I'ma go to the Jewelry sstore
Thursday it's back to the Jewelry store once more
Friday I'ma G-4 to the westcoast
Hook up with an essay
Come back with the best Smokes
Saturday I like to down
Sunday I coupe to the City
with my 4-15 for
B-B-B- beatin' at Nitti

[Chorus]
