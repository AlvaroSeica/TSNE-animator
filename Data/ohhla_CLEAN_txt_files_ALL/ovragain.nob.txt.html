[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Aye yo is heaven got a ghetto then I'm chillin' with Yak
And if heaven got a ghetto then I'm visiting Pac
Cause the world down here
So cold thru my eyes
And my first piece of work got sold when I was 9
And I didn't realize what I was doing was wrong
Mom Duke was smoked out
And my pop was gone
I got a big brother Shawn
I don't see him a lot
Even though we fight yo
I still love him a lot
My uncle Carl just died
And I couldn't even cry
I couldn't even sleep
Couldn't even get high
My girl catch me 8 in the morning
Sometimes writing rhymes
Pain trapped inside
Like I got something to hide
It's enough to make a grown man cry
When you gotta sit back
And watch a grown man die
The pot of gold ain't promised at the end
But I'll do it all over if I had to again

[Chorus: EDI &amp; Young Noble]
(cause I gave me all)
And ain't nobody give me a damn thing
I had to go out and get it mayne
(get that dough)
It ain't all about the money
But ain't a damn thing funny when ya hungry
(hard times come)
But I ain't the one to run
I stay in the trenches until the job is done
(I will not fail)
Aye yo I'm playing to win
And if I had to I'll do it again

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Me and my mom at the same time doin' a little bid
I was dumb keepin' coke in the crib
I had to learn not to stash where you live
But I was up makin' money from her friends
I wanna live
Cause back then we wasn't doing too good
But I did what I could to get my mom out the hood
I grew up in the ghetto
But she raised me right
Even though I was young
Stayin' out all night
Make some money on my own
So I thought I was grown
Hennessy kept me warm
Imma sleep on the floor
Believe in the Lord
Better yet ?? believe in yoself
It might be nobody there when you need some help
Hard times back then
Made me stronger within
And I'll do it all over if I had to again

[Chorus: EDI &amp; Young Noble]

[Outro: Young Noble]
I ask myself sometimes do I deserve all this
I ask myself sometimes is it worth all this
I ask myself sometimes do they feel my pain
I ask myself sometimes is it really a game
I ask myself sometimes is there a future in rap
Some cats get jealous
Wanna shoot me in my back
I ask myself sometimes do I really got homies
Will anybody care if I wasn't gettin' money
I ask myself sometimes can I last in this
I ask myself sometimes can I mash to this
I ask myself sometimes can I do it again
But that ain't even a question
Imma souljah til the end
(to the end)</pre>
