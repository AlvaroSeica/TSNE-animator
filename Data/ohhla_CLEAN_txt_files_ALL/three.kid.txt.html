Ahhhhhhh... 
I'm here and it's clear I'm gonna flow so yo black
Just get on up or yo get the bozak 
Cuz it ain't Kojak or Dr. Suess
It's the kid mother fucker and I'm gonna get loose 
Cuz I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison 
Ruff like brandy and no one knows
That I got more riffs than Randy Rhodes
Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don't know the half 
I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick
I'm nothin but a funky country hick 
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump 
Never been questioned by the F.B.I
Although I've tried every method just to get high 
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin on 
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin on
But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin on 
Down to the muther fuckin A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem 
No brain no pain...Now c'mon yall and tell me what's my name

Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come On, Come On

Kid Rock Rock

Now break it down like this

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin 
Taggin hoes gettin lots of trim
Gettin jocks and props for all the spots I rock 
I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you 
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio wanna get rich ho 
So count my props you can't get with me
And fuck all u cops u ain't shit to me 
But hoes with guns playin hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one 
For anyone tryin to bust me up
U better chill with that tryin to fuck me up 
And if you're talkin shit I'm gonna shut ya up
And all ya wack D.J.'s I'm gonna cut ya up 
Cuz I don't give a fuck about no one
And when I wax I tax and that's just how it goes son 
Yo ain't no sucker
Cuz I'm the Kid.. Rock motherfucker
Straight from Mo-town and I won't slow down
I cease the cheese M.C.'s I moe down 
And I show no shame cuz I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name 

Kid Rock Rock
