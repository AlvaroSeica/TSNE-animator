[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
One-two, yeah, yeah ya'll niggas don't know about Fat Back
With the different color records they had back in the days
Youknowhatimean, the belt driven, turntables, the Techniq joints
Put nickels on they needles so the muthafucking record won't jump, the
needle won't skip and shit
Getting juice from the fucking light pole, shout out to the Bronx, nigga!

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, the shit go way back like the unique marker
Kid bombing the D train and hit the Bronx, up
Crowd all planned to attack, Planet Rock Bambataa
Peace to Pelon, discovering rap
And the DJ that made the first scratch, paved the way
For Flex, Mister Cee, Enuff and Big Kap
See this rap shit? Came at a time that was accurate
Twenty something years later, I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power, I was a little nigga
Couldn't stay out late, I was shallow
So I sat by the window, hear the DJ cut
And peace to Prez, Apache had just begun
Otis Redding, scram, the music stopped
Guess the system blew out one of his amps
It'll take a little while, then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all
Now every body's back in the groove, echo chamber
Check one-two, one-two, that's my favorite
Strobe lights is live, pink champel
Little pen joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two-fives, under they neck
Clear the circle in the park and shoot five
Girls wore they D's from Jelly's, Jordash and Lee's
Cheers, lord, fit the feli's
Scents is burning, Kangol buckets, BVD's
Go with the Sergio's, like fuck it
Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie, niggas coming back from the fun house
Dusted, throwing bubbles on the wall, sweating

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
We must remind you, where this rap come
Yes, my brother, my sister, it's our duty, we must remind you
Hip hop, was set out in the park
Hip hop, was set out in the park
Hip hop, was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark

[Black Thought]
Yo, it all started at the After Midnight Philly, but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Wally hit the skating rink, USA
Banging Schooli, gangsta boogie and PSK
I remember shells, gazelles, top tens and lotto's
Mega designs, reefer smoke, hokey nine bottle
And time on valor's, quarter boys with the lucci war
Eighty-four from Atlantic City Gucci store
Linoleum break dancing, rush stole in your camp
I put the writing on the wall, signed, truly yours
Philly smash '87 music, seminar
Out in the battlefield, like, Pat Benetar
Hit the bar with crowd rulers out of Camden
People Patty Duking in the party all cramped in
Around the time, Flav started Cold Lamping
Rebel Without a Pause was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette, tape collections
Bright spotlight on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the fresh rest come, leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they gun to get one
MC Breed, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff, Cash Money and Miz, and Lady B
Everybody banging Sucker MC's in '83
I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D
The wild north side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, bumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin he was a buck two
Ya'll don't like how I'm living well fuck you
I've been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up in somebody dollar party getting into shit
At late night should of been in bed
Instead I was running round with them downtown lemon head
And little man, hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen seeing real strong images
And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship
That's where I started at and that's where I'mma finish it, what?!?
