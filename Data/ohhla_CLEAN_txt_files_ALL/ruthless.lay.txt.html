[Young Lay]
Baby fuck back now you could bet a girp that I won't slip
Even though I love to perk some hennessey with lemon squeee
With lemon squeeze all the jerk it just might work through the night
But yet we ain't sangers cuz I keep my game tight
I be kickin the stuff holding the mic
With a slight grip as I like a smith and stop a stressin
A ruthless adolessence you might become a lesson
Put on My suit and clown naw playa that's what hoes do
All the rhyme sales so I'm storming through
But since birth but I been doing this type of shit 80 13
I'm really not that clean when I'm on the scene gangsta lean
Roll info deep but our gats in the seat I would really like to creep
With all the playa crew cuz your hoe I'd be gattin through
He told me all about cha your spots and your where abouts
And how to catch you slippin trippin on that main route
You say this by the kitchen I told the hoe to get a kid if he's a playa
She's coming with me I got fried fo it genius for a weed bag
in 92 see Pac in the jail naw nigga he's a foo' but I wasn't in the
But I'm gonna teach this as a Lesson 1994
Yo ruthless adolesnece

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hittin the clean you rather see me sober
Peace to the niggas that hearing this

[Young Lay]
Pay back lay back got a sac of boones
Sittin in wracks with the cutties in they back room
Diggity Dam dungeon cunt I split the weed smoke
That my peodic come they just get keyyed and making a mail paper juice in
They cookin thangs they hate this mail I will I guess I gots to make the grip
I got a gap so thick it's going down it's
Gonna make me shit but I ain't trippin they got me living dangerously
And carrying an extra clippin cuz even these hoes are aiming me
Instead of wanting to be blaming me
But hoochie hoes is crazy hoe lifestyle changed
When she had the baby now she want's to
Name me but liggidy low is sex do love them to be your baby
But lookin like the next dough
And shit got crossed up cuz his bitch knew my buissnes can I get a witness
They driving fools delirious peace to the niggas
That be hearing this ruthless adolessence

[Chorus]</pre>
