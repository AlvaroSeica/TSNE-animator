[Sean Price]
P! Eratik Statik, what it do?
Earth-shatterin first reverse battering
Wrong colors on you're turf trafficking
Whattup? Sean the name y'all niggaz {?}
War, beef in the streets and plus these metaphors
Sean's the bomb, Lebanon, Decepticon
Most high, most lie, bow tie like Farrakhan
All praises due to Allah
You have no idea what I'd do to you ha? Listen
Your face look like steak with the A1 Sauce
when the God let the AR off, let's eat
I ain't a rapper that'll foul or smack
I'm the rapper put the gat on your hat {*click-clak*}
Hehe, yo, rap prime minister, some say sinister
Fo'-and-fo' with hot punch, bitch that's how I finish ya
My raps is slick, my guns shoot chicks
Eratik Statik, nigga that's magic in the mix
Don't make the God pop out lead
Send you to God on knockout lead, motherfucker

(Knock 'em out the box G) (*3X*)
(Knock 'em out the box)

[Eratik Statik]
If these gats were tig ol' bitties they'd be doublin D's
With Sean P on the team, trouble travel in 3's
Get rough motherfucker we can settle this beef
All you tough motherfuckers we can battle and beef
I'll hit you split your lips up hard enough to rattle your teeth
Fuckin you up, numbin your yaps, spit beef
Fumblin stumblin, have you, dumbin your raps
I'm not the type to, talk when you ain't in the place
I'm the type that just might, show up at your place
Come in and kick it wit'chu, put two in your face
Tie you up beat you down and then, head for the safe
I do walk with Jesus but keep a 9 on the waist
that'll smack the Bejeezus out, along with the taste
See I'll, run in your house and put a gun to your mouth
For nothin less than the fact that you was runnin your mouth
I'm like the Crack Globetrotter, the black Muhammad Ali
Got the bomb diggy ziggy plus the palm in jihadist
Finger on the trigger and dare you to move the product

(Knock 'em out the box G) (*3X*)
(Knock 'em out the box)

[Eratik Statik]
Yo my heat settlin, silence you lambs like Ritalin
Prime time or Late Night, like Dave Letterman
Razor sharp rhymes, sever the head of every man
Crush upcomin acts, retire great veterans
I know it's hard, but all praise due to the God
Steady you learn what I can do to you pa, listen
I'm laced with napalm to blaze your face off
Leave no traces where your features belong, that's heat~!
No, I'm not the cat, don't give a shit what you said
Yes the tool's cocked back to pop, lead in your head
Right on that fitted cap, right in front of the crib
Dismember your ass and bury the gat, under the shed
We the nicest out, fuck what you heard, fuck what they said
Eratik and Sean P, we the illest that live
It's like a needle in your vein makin your temperature boil
I'm a master with my craft plus a nigga street loyal
We drop hits that rock charts consecutively
My nigga it's gats {?} Eratik and Sean P
