(Bridge - Ali)
It's the S, the T, the L, the O
And the U, the I, the S, St. Louis

(Chorus x2 - Ray Ray and Ali)
Ray: Roll to the North side, chill on the Westside
Ray: Take the bridge to the East, the Southside
Ali: Dodge the beast, (Whoop), we see 'em comin'
Ali: Fuck them we ain't runnin' we all seventy

(Verse 1 - Ray Ray)
When you least expect it, I watching every move
That you down packed, I'm city slick without the Lou
Hell yeah, I got some shit to prove
First of all I never left St. Louis, I took a piece of it wit me
In '93, set up camp in ATL, I was 69in'
Before y'all cats started diamond mining'
Cause the Freak Nick turned me out, I always new that
Years they depieced trees applied the woo wat
Here comes another nigga from the MO, think I'm scared of the mic
For this I waited a long time, haters wanna block my shine
Cause the way of my words are put together plus I'm still in my prime
Ray-mon, raised above the Lou, straight out the Westside
In the Guinness Book World's endless is where it's classified
Ali made it happen, gave me some shine
Trife drop a track so I, made up a rhyme
Jump in the lab, chemistry a perfect blend
Created this vaccine like the medicine men
I'm bout to use you for the guinea pig
Oh in a matter of fact, the side effects are real killin' the whack

(Chorus x2 - Ray Ray and Ali)
Ray: Roll to the North side, chill on the Westside
Ray: Take the bridge to the East, the Southside
Ali: Dodge the beast, (Whoop), we see 'em comin'
Ali: Fuck them we ain't runnin' we all seventy

(Verse 2 - Ali)
Oh ain't it bad I destroy the nerve, battle boy, natural high cap
Fuck, Donna in the CD, half in the tray me and Ray the boy
Triston, lis-non for flaws, analyzing all of y'all
Been in corners in the grenada we took it back troops
Suits, hittin wells to loot, niggas can hoop
Jumpin' like the G Money, gimme my money
Poised off when he went to see, two honeys
I like that, change the CD it's has mat
Signin' autographs, as we got gas
Tim Woodrow wit dubs, on the low, showing love
Wit one light, two young niggas in the club
Animal House natural fitteds, one leg girl don' did it
Drop run to raw, the second, flo' wit it
Paid still castle point, high lawn hazel wood
Err where it's all good, as we

(Chorus x4 - Ray Ray and Ali)
Ray: Roll to the North side, chill on the Westside
Ray: Take the bridge to the East, the Southside
Ali: Dodge the beast, (Whoop), we see 'em comin'
Ali: Fuck them we ain't runnin' we all seventy

(Bridge - Ali)
It's the S, the T, the L, the O
And the U, the I, the S, St. Louis</pre>
