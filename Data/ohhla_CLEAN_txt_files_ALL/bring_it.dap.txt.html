Song:   Bring It Home
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We are, we are, we are, we are
The only ones that can bring it, bring it home
We are, we are, we are, we are the only ones

This is an invasion, the unwanted kind
I'm all about domination, that's my state-of-mind
I'm gonna build an empire, so what's yours is mine
We're gonna take it home tonight
Oh oh oh oh

Let's make this one to remember
We're blowing up the sky like the fifth of November
We don't stop cause we're impatient
The anticipation is pumping, pumping, pumping

Carry the light, from the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die, we're crossing the line
There's nowhere left to hide

Tell me what you waiting for
What you living for
We're bringing it home
No ones left behind
You're not alone

Cause we are, we are, we are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
Cause we are, we are, we are, we are the only ones,

When I'm gone will you miss me
We'll find out in time
I'm gonna go down in history
As the one who changed your mind
They said that I'm dangerous, so what's yours is mine
We're gonna take this home tonight

Let's make this one to remember
We're blowing up the sky like the fifth of November
We don't stop cause we're impatient
The anticipation is pumping, pumping, pumping

Carry the light (carry the light), from the fire (from the fire)
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die (do or die), we're crossing the line
There's nowhere left to hide

Tell me what you waiting for
What you living for
We're bringing it home
No ones left behind
You're not alone

Cause we are, we are, we are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
Cause we are, we are, we are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home

Right here where you meant to be
I'm gonna get my hands on you eventually
I swear life's a bitch
And mine's called victory
That's why I always come first, literally
They're running over like, you're kind
All on eyes on the prize, but you're mine
Never, give off a sign you can't go a day without thinking about just

Just carry the light, from the fire (from the fire)
I can see it burning it your eyes (I can see it burning)
Do or die, we're crossing the line
There's nowhere left to hide

Tell me what you waiting for (tell me what you waiting for)
What you living for
We're bringing it home
No ones left behind
You're not alone

Cause we are, we are, we are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
Cause we are, we are, we are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home</pre>
