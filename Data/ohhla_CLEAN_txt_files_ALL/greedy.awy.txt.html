Yeah, HUT TWO!
AhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHAOOOW!!!!!

[Chorus 2X]
I don't want a hit of it, I want the whole spliff
I don't want a sip of it, I want the whole Fifth
I don't want a little bit, I want the whole shit
Now give it up (give it up), give it up (quick)

[Sean Boog]
I don't want a piece, just give me the cake
You can have the crumbs but I'm takin the plate
Look you right in the face, smile and give you the tooth
Been a long time comin, time for me to let loose
I can be a bit too greedy, I admit it, uh!
The way I'm lookin at it, it's no way to get enough
Send me the rulers and these dudes cain't measure up
Never stay on one floor, always gotta step it up
I don't just do it man, I do it to death
Anything that I'm doin, I'ma do in excess
That's just me to a T, I see the big pick
I don't see my part, I read the whole script (chea!)
I don't take a shot or two, I drink the whole shiiiit
I ain't gotta say it though you already know this
I take focus to a whole 'nother hype
I'm thinkin bout tomorrow, while you thinkin of the other night

[Chorus]

[Sean Boog]
I ain't here to spit raps, I'm here to make anthems
Take whatever's yours, hold the shit for ransom
Always want more, more and more
This is the beginning, got more in store, uh!
Presto change flow sorceror
I wanna see the cover of Forbes, of course
MORE than a boss, I'm a force to be reckon wit
If it ain't a bigger move, then it's just irrelvant
I can hit the lottery, STILL be out grindin
I could make a hit record, STILL be outrhymin
I could be blind and, still see the light ahead
I can get high, but I always wanna light ahead
GO for the gusto, WHY half-ass it?
Fatherless child, I'm that bastard
Four-mic album, I'll be lookin for the classic
This is that, this is that, this is that shit!

[Chorus]

[Sean Boog - Outro]
CHU'KNOW..
We greedy in this motherfucker, man
We can never get enough..
We gon' keep on climbin
KEV, WHADDUP? *echoes*
Away Team, LET'S...
[*echoes*]
