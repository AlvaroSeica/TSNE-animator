Song:   Loyalty and Betrayal
Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Life (life), evil and the good
Good versus evil, which way you going baby

[Chorus - 2x]
Loyalty and betrayal, freedom or jail
Will I excel or will I fail, or end up in jail
If I prevail, am I going to heaven or hell
I don't know, only time will tell

[H.A.W.K.]
If a nigga's not loyal, that makes my blood boil
A mama's boy who's spoiled, send him back to the soil
Your plot has been foiled, on the for realer
You make a good man, turn into a killer
I love my niggaz, but do they feel the same
Money changes thangs, ones start acting strange
Won't say no names, unless he comes at me
Then he'll see, there ain't no hope with me
We the jury, find him not guilty
My hands filthy, a nigga mighta killed me
The streets what built me, and only time will tell
And only the lord knows, what life unveils

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
I keep it true, with who been real to me
Seen a whole lotta people, turn they back on me
Did time in a place, where I shouldn't of been
Niggaz ain't take they case, call theyself my friend
Dogs hate a young nigga, when they coming up
Riding big harley trucks, and won't take no stuff
From nobody, loyalty and betrayal
Will I win will I fail, fuck time in jail
I make mail, grinding and politic'ing with folks
Moving several pounds, of this diggy-diggy dope
Never been a cut throat, it's either heaven or hell
Waiting for it to go down, only time'll tell

[Chorus - 2x]

[Chris Ward]
This game is a deadly trap, for those trying to get they fetty scraps
You gotta be cautious, to avoid getting lead in your cap
You either make it, or break it
And when it comes to a case shit, you either take it or shake it
See when you out here getting this money, you can't grind too long mayn
Or the feds'll be on your phone, then all in your home mayn
It's not them it's them fools, that's trying to get ya
So keep your eyes peeled, sometimes it's the niggaz riding with ya
And keep your enemies close, and loved ones at a distance
So when shit pop off, they don't know your immediate family's existence
Some boys come to the finish, and hustle relentless
But what they forget is to ask God, to grant them forgiveness

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
