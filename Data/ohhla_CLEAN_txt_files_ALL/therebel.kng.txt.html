[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Heaven Razah, wings up
All my T.H.U.G. Angelz riding
You know how the halo go
Bob Marley like this one, yo

[Hell Razah]
I stay surrounded with a Godly council, amount to
A hundred and forty four thousand children to count to
We turn our projects to pentagons, it's war around you
We come from, black jewels to dirty scoundrels of the state
I know the most high supply, every natural cause
To the actual, physical, the spiritual loss
When he knock us up, for you the one to open the doors
I seen my people steady falling, like it ain't no floors
Bottomless pits, for hell convicts
A conscience, black awareness of the kings and prophets of the lord
Clean your soul from the wickedness before you, boy
Eternal life is my only reward

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...

[Junior Reid]
Stallion, boy
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire

[Timbo King]
My bloodline, trace it back to the great prophets
Strapped up, with the mac and the full cartridge
The media got the young brains hostage
Handcuff to the projects with no logic
Electrolytes, I don't need no sockets
My flow wattage, spit out sky rockets
I live opposite, center of apocalypse
Connect the stars, astrologist
I out your powerless, walking down mountain slow
Lost souls wandering in the valleys below
Craftsmen built the temple, we develop to grow
There's no oath, we kin from the root to the oak

[Junior Reid]
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire</pre>
