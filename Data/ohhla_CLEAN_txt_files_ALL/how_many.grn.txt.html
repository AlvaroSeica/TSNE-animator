Song:   How Many Moons
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings

Have I got left til I've no breath left to breathe
How longs left for me
For whatever the time, for the rest of mine
I'm gonna spend time
Putting an end to my
Enemies who wanna put an end to my shine
Why bother try offending me?
Its off with the heads of these swines
When I sign out you're gonna remember me

Remember me [?] don't nobody wanna send for me
The only time they mention me or speak or me disrespecfully is when they sleep
Ive been between alot of legs of a body of a centipede
Please enemies be more courteous, save me or forget to breath
Life could be easier I could ease it up
Instead I look like someone tryna squeeze a dump
And I haven't eatin in months so I need these MC's on the edge
Ill be the reason they jump off
Remember the jump off
When I come forth
You don't wanna be the MC I run towards
I like Miley I like straight I ain't no Dumbledore
Untowartooce looks like I love and adore
But its custom I come before
And its cool if I cant it up coz I've got a cucumber for you
Fuck the world Ima stick it in mud
Stingy wanna drink you can piss ina cup
I leave women as livid as stunts
So run your lips I've been itching to give a chick abit of a cunt punt

[Chorus]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings

Have I got left til I've no breath left to breathe
How longs left for me
For whatever the time, for the rest of mine
I'm gonna spend time
Putting an end to my
Enemies who wanna put an end to my shine
Why bother try offending me?
Its off with the heads of these swines
When I sign out you're gonna remember me

Sanity I squandered it
I think I've gone too far in darkness I'm wonderin
Guess he ain't on the list
Well I'm pissed off that I ain't on top of it
Deep in thought, conspiring
Get the violin
Call my thought
A firing frime
And twiddling thumbs
I'm playing the worlds smallest violin
Inconsiderate like I give a fuck how they feel
Kidnapping rappers and having them as microwave meals
I know my meals ready when the microwave stops
Ima look more jack nickolsen than I am michael j fox
The creep that crept up on daisy low
In the baby grow
I sat on her knee and told her to touch me inapropriotely until my daisy grows
I'm not a man of her man kind
Mechanical mad man
I make hannibal look more like annabelle I'm an animal right now

[Chorus]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings (have I got left)

How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings (have I got left)</pre>
