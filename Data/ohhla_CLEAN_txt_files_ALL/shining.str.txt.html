[Sunshine-Chorus] 
I see your true color, shinin through 
I see your true color, an' that's why I love you 
I see your true color, shinin through 
I see your true color, an' that's why I love you 

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr] 
Yo, father forgive, we all tryin to survive where we live 
I'd rather feed the homeless eight times than talk to da kids 
Show 'em life ain't no walk on the bridge 
Damn as hard as it is, when I be dreamin I be talkin to B.I.G 
In my hood it ain't no yellow brick road, we hear the shots echo 
Sneakers hangin from a telephone pole 
In my ghetto aint no rainbow wit pots a gold 
but tha was love from tha family when tymes are cold 
I seen n analyzed tha world  from my project roof 
An' seen the hope in tha eyes of a troubled youth 
A good kid, I kept this burna in dis motha goose 
A motherless child,lost in these streets loose 
in the waterworlds away these are rainy days 
My man got poped at an early age 
These cowards run n say he flipped into his early grave 
They say the good die young, we're headed for dem early gates 

Chorus 

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr] 
Yo,they say this love wasnt meant to be 
2 people from 2 different worlds, we wasnt meant to be 
it musta been fate you were sent to me 
we'll make it through these hard tymes, eventually 
tha standard fight,walk by faith n not by sight 
we're all tha same color when you turn off tha lights 
i take tha sunshine with tha pain 
wear my Saraguards sad,dats when it rains 
no fridge, kept tha food on tha window payne 
we all breathe tha same air so we all tha same 
im trapped in this ghetto maze tryna make it out 
if you dont know me dont judge me, wuthcu talkin bout 
im far dividable of ard of tha broken dreams 
single mothas yall my heroes, yall my queens 
to get my moms out tha hood, thats my hope n dreams 
to raise my son to be a soldier by any means
