What (13x), huh
What, What, What (huh)
It's time to separate all the trio
From the bustas
You heard me
DRAMA
AHHHHHHHHH
  
Chorus:
Let's go to war
Let's go to war 
Let's go to war with these bust ass niggas
Let's go to war
Let go to war
Let go to war
Let go to war with these bust ass niggas
  
Verse 1:
Jump when I say jump
Go when I say go
Tura gots the loot with the K's on my check
I scrap with grenade
'Cause in the south niggas don't play
And every nigga that I know keep a chopper on K
What's gon happen is gon happen
So fuck now stop jacking
Nigga all clikk clacking
I told you once 
I told you twice
That y'all miggas ain't ready for me
I hear you talking shit 
But pussy nigga I ain't worried
But now they like my dick
I take the help and keep it whipping
'Cause deep down south fifth ward niggas ain't scrap
Who need the name of Drama putting it louder on the map
Slap it like a pig
So you hater best sit
'Cause if you don't sit it down 
Now bust on Busta Rhymes
For nigga it's either or 
But nigga I'm screaming war
Choppers and K's 
Fully loaded autimatic
(3 second pause)
So fuck all the static
  
Chorus
  
???? nagging me to my enimes
Leaving nigga booted live abused and stared
I'm bitching like Al Capone
My AK at crack of dawn
???????????????????
He ??? my mooma pussy and came out screaming war
My daddy he couldn't be found so I was neglected low
They say Drama you ain't right
They say that I'm dead wrong
But if ??? niggas cross me I'm cracking they fucking dome
Go off like a time bomb
But Drama I beat it 
Now Peter Peter the pussy eater
I'm packing a millimeter
They's call me the fucking heater
'Cause I'm leaving niggas wrong 
Put a tag on that nigga toe
'Cause he'll never breathe again ( OK )
Drop to my knee 
Asking Peter if he'll forgive my sins
The sins that I committed
I plotted before I did it
I'm looking at seventy plus 
'Cause it was premeditated
The witness he never made it
'Cause I'm leaving nigga faded
Be straightened by playa haters
Them bustas they wanna do
But I bar none 'cause I'm the 2000 John Wayne
Talk the talk
Nigga lets walk the walk
And better worry pussy nigga 
Let's go to war 
  
Chorus
  
Well if it's on it's on 
Well if it's on it's on  
Well if it's on it's on fuck nigga bring it on
  
Well if it's on it's on 
Well if it's on it's on 
Well if it's on it's on fuck nigga bring it on
  
If you want some 
Get some 
Bad enough take some
  
Want some 
Get some
Bad enough take some
  
Want some
Get some
Bad enough take some
  
Want some 
Get some 
Bad enough take some
