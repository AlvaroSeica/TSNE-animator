Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Park Hill
Staten Island, New York City
Check for a nigga, check for a nigga
If you in Maryland, check for a nigga
If you in Virginia, check for a nigga
If you in Toronto, check for nigga
Check for a nigga, check for a nigga

You see me Uptown, yo you see me Uptown last night
with my new Nike's, satellite gold as hell
I stroll well, I protect with the most
respected mic check, cassette full of life
High technology, Gortek intellect
Good for a million, one dart project
Kid I nurse this rap shit, textbook monitor
merge just like traffic, dick deserve an encore
One of a kind, Pro-Line hydro head
Hold a verse like a Wisdom, smack tracks on her ass
Quick competition, got you in a smash
Diamond thoughts, bite down on your ear
I fear none, Dolemite strike three time
award mic fuck crazy vagina
Born first to rock fifty, S.I. New York City
Slang Nitty, check for me badly
Manditory for me to keep fuckin y'all head up
The one man news team fast like a photographer

check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga
If you in D.C., check for a nigga
If you in Virginia, check for a nigga
If you in Ohio, check for a nigga
If you in Toronto, check for a nigga, check for a nigga

Straight from the heritage, public announcers
Ounces of darts, he fucked you over
I stole ya heart, so just in case
you forgot about the face, flash that camera
at the all-time great, slight paranoid
Fuck toys consistent, fluent slang pediment
It's the magnificent, first album
Hot tracks on the sipper, low flame deliver
Defense like a Giant, it's the Son of Pslam giver
Masterpiece in the making, Asian
African Egyptian Jamaican
Swordplay from the deep isolation, whattup cousin?
Have a drink on the house, I blow mics out
This man is on fire, fully developed
dance with the organizer, chance me
Tap into my Wu pedigree, numba three chamber
Second in the cut, it's the Black Lone Ranger
Cat in the Hat, fresh clothes on the hanger
The Last Man Standing with the vest and the banger
Desperate to delegate, peep me on the Magnavox
channel Fox, telecommunicate
Match money like socks, summertime style
Thunderstorm, vocabulary anonymous
kid extra Caligula, poetry in particular

check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga
If you in Virginia, check for a nigga
If you in Manhattan, check for a nigga
If you in D.C., check for a nigga
If you in Georgia, check for a nigga
check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga

Outfits forever
New Cappadonna, blue is my quaintness
I'm a maintenance in this rap shit, politics
Spit the graphic mix it up nice spent
Twist me in the city, elegance walk
My style Don Hard Juan, Passenger 57
in Jackson 10, A Soldier and a Gentleman
Calm and hyper, deadly spokesperson
Smooth like a tiger, inquiring minds
design arts and crafts, used to play the field
on the rap, drafted the devil
Bass and treble, worldwide baritone
Judge wise on the throne, wild like sober lyrics
splash out my dome, uncontrollable
Staten Island untold feel it across the globe
I expand, Cappa the man, head low
Eyes red like a Wu suit, do it right Sixty
My stee' mary alley, follow my lead
not my language it's dangerous, pitbull fightin
a war, hardcore C-4 with the words kid
Better branches, turn your head twice
One life, still gettin it right, then yo

check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga
If you in Brooklyn check for a nigga
If you in Manhattan check for a nigga
If you in Queens, check for a nigga
If you in the Bronx then check for a nigga
check for a nigga, check for a nigga

check for a nigga
If you in the Woods, check for a nigga
check for a nigga
If you in the Garbage, check for a nigga
check for a nigga
