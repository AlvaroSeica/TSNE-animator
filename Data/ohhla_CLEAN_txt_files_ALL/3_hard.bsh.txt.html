[Bushwick Bill]
(Yessuh!) Ha! Black and Backdoor and Low Key
(Motherfuckin Black Gold) Hard Headz (Low Key)
Dollaz N Sense (Hard Heaz) comin hard
(Takin over this motherfucker) That's right
Be lookin out for these hard hitters
Three hard heads, kick that shit

[Verse One]
What do you get when you put three Hard Headz together?
Nobody know but I noticed a certain change in the weather
Tougher than leather, down to get dirty when it come to my family
Wannabeez be lookin at me funny cause them hoes don't understand me
Pledge allegiance to a flag for WHAT when it want me dead
Imagine these crackers and jackers tryin to fill yo' head with lead
That shit won't happen, once I be rappin
Keep myself on top of my game while I'm chincheckin and slappin
Full of that indo, tuckin my deuce out of the window
When it come to pretenders, slap you guys like I was offended
My words you get injured, get in yo' grill like I was dentures
Step into my center, won't nobody know where I sent ya
Give you a picture, shit I kickin you gon' be sick
Nigga don't want no concrete, but why yo' bitch all on my dick?
Gotta pay that no attention and keep kickin the killer flow
What you get when you put three Hard Headz together nobody KNOWS~!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
What do you get when you put three Hard Headz together?
Nobody know but I noticed a certain change in the weather
Thinkin we fear you, cause you got a gat in your drawers
We won't slip when you pause, somebody better call the laws

[Verse Two]
What do you get when you put three Hard Headz together?
Nigga you gon' need a bunch of drank and a ladder to even see my level
Dig deeper than shovel, I'm in yo' veins when your blood be flowin
Later for cappers wannabe rappers they stoppin and goin
E'rybody wanna see me when they see me they gon' see me blitzed
Standin over the world when I piss, makin sure I don't miss
Hard Head 'til I'm dead I'm gon' stay real if you like it or not
Done ate these dogs and got too hot you test not for my rocks
When the laws show up I'll be a witness and watch me bail pimp 'em
If I find yo' daughter home alone, may go and help her
Runnin through the weeds, scratchin up my knees
You just gon' have to bust a hole in back do' cause I'll be damned if I freeze
For A-B dead C, I'm all about my G's
Cousin Texas you ain't shit if you ain't got you no cheese
Bitches complain, try knock me off of my game
Even though when pussy strainin my brain, the question still remain

[Chorus]

[Bushwick Bill]
That's right
We got the Hard Headz in the house.. {*fades*}</pre>
