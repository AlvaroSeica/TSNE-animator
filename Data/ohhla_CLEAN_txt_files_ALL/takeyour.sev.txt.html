[Verse 1: Seven]
Come on, baby
Just drop the pannies and let's get to it
You said you want to suck a freak, I wanna hit and split it
And commit it, but I don't wanna be caught up
So let me bust one in your mouth and shit the spot, cause your time's up
Your friends are calling from the next room
S-V-En, slip in Don dusk, what they consume
Triple X positions
Your body's causing friction
Hard to tame, these pornographics is a heartache condition
I'll even run rap, (???) like an ambulance
Fine bitch, on dick, wanna drop a pants
Yeah
We're making money
We stackin' G's
Professionals who drop hoes on ease
In a drop-top base
I'm gonna hit
Switches on bitches when I tip through L.A.
In the carpool lane
Gettin' skully on the freeway
Hurry up and take your clothes off, baby

Chorus: James Debarge
If you want it
Come get it
Please believe it
I hit it
I'm gon' always
Come with it
Hurry up and take your clothes off

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Lil' Demon]
I rip your clothes off
Damn, your body feels soft
Kinky with a fetish, I'm your pimp and boss
Turn around, baby girl, wanna hit it like that
Glancin' in the leer, and I'm stroking your back
Yeah, you blushed out
Smell like a rose
Ring around your toes, sexy like J-Lo
Are you a bad girl
I'm putting up a front
Teasin' little homies, not givin' up none
Are you a freak
Love the late night creep
Down with S&amp;M and a little whipped cream
Tell me how you want it, but you gotta be real
No promises to love, just a night for a thrill
I know you married with you, and I ain't tryin' to play bad
Tryin' to get you in trouble, or even break up your pad
Just call me your Sancho, Lil' Demon the great
If you want it, come and get it, and I'm always ready to play

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Slow Pain]
I'm calling out names
Mona from Pomona
Tina, Lisa, Pheonix, Arizona
Monique from Dallas
Good ol' Dallas
Little nasty freak I met at Caesar's Palace
Nasty girl, you nasty
Taking off your clothes like Cathy
Five foot nine
Slide down the pole
T.V.'s in Alberquerque, V.I.P., front row
Miss Bernidete
Lil' Mariah
Girl, you get me Higher like Earth, Wind And Fire
Diamonds and pearls, I love all these girls
Gangsta, gangsta in a gangster world
I got bad ones
From K.C. to L.A.
I got loved ones
Always down to parle
I keep it pimpin'
Cause that's all that I know
I grab your girl by the hand at the end of the show

Repeat Chorus Four Times</pre>
