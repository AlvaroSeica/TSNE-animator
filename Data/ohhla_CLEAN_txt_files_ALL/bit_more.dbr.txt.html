Typed by: OHHLA.COM

to the beat beat and ya dont quit shit 

Before the sun shines the rain falls 
Applause the encore 
Havent you heard of a bitch who can open like pores 
Pop a nigga like a pimple keep it simple enough 
Make em wonder what the fuck happened leavin em stuffed 
Get that ass kicked fast quick in a hurry 
You felt the fist of fury when you envisioned that i was comin' 
Used to laugh when i had a demo 
But since the big stretch lex limo 
You aint got no moe jokes 
Ya wanna come on and go wit me 
To my place hate to hurt ya feelings sexual healin aint the case 
Laced the tracks like angle dust 
Thus fuckin wit us is deadly 
Behead the whole crew of the last nigga who wasnt ready 
Stay bregheted up, platinum plus 
Nubians E three four chrome's 18's three piece B B S treat seat's 
And y'all shall find riches it's mad bitches gettin dough 
I'll die for I go broke just a lil moe 

CHORUS 
Just a lil bit more 
Do me just a uhh 
Just a lil bit more will ease my mind 
Repeat 2x 

Now put one hand in the air if ya keep the chinky out effect 
I live to party all night 
And love to have sex 
Got a main squeeze in the piece on the low 
Make a good piece of cheese but could use some more 
Who got a lighter bout to blaze up its tucked in tight 
I let the ventilation slide sensation between the windpipe 
Ignite it up try to bite my style too tought 
Its too much , too lil, too late for you to come up 
Be decieved of ya wanna be foolish this bad mandate bitch is 
true to the shit,envoke the spirits like the craft's 
Serve the niggas half the stash in case the cash get low 
The bastard know 
Fuck over the dough and die 
Pick yo casket if you feel that you gone try some shit 
no nigga ever lasted past the first attempt 
I leave em baffled and gaffle em for all of they keys 
Then dispence to my niggas like Sony distributing LP'S 

CHORUS 
Repeat 1x 

to the tic toc and ya dont stop 
to the beat beat and ya dont quit 
Repeat 3x 

a lil moe bitch 
a lil moe nigga 
a lil moe baby 

That'll ease your mutha-phuckin' mind... 
so so def wit that mind blowin shit </pre>
