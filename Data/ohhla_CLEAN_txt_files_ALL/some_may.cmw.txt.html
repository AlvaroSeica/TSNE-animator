[ MC Eiht ]
Geah
Geah

Some niggas may know and some may not

How the muthafuck we do it

Some niggas may know and some may not

Compton all day, come on

Some niggas may know and some may not

Original Compton's Most
Geah

[ VERSE 1: MC Eiht ]
Y'all know this killer muthafucka from ah - way back
Gun react, hit your chest in 8 seconds flat
My mindstate is me against your spot and I'm heated
Be the winner of the 10 pace, you screamin I cheated
Sir Blast-a-Lot, hit your chestplate and it's burnin
Pushin weight through your spot, all your money I'm earnin
Hit the flo', the hot shells spit too fast
Dr. No couldn't tell which way was the blast
Money, cash (ching-ching) money, cash, hoes
I be the cold nigga leavin your whole block froze
You catch the hot ones, I got shells to lend
The iced-out Rolex means I got money to spend
Hate the thug muthafuckas, hate the gang
Compton hood niggas for life, we hoo-bang
Get caught up, the lights went out, that's the good part
Shoulda known, done fucked up from the start

[ CHORUS 2X: Tha Chill ]
Now some niggas may know, and some may not
Been puttin it down for 12 straight
Been through plenty headaches
So give us a inch, we take the mile and keep runnin
I'm sick of the homies askin when that real shit comin

[ VERSE 2: Tha Chill ]
Wanna take a little trip, like war with us
Kicked a little dust up, tryin to score with us
What I can't understand while I just can't trust
Like X Clan this shit is 'vanglorious'
Make a nigga wanna reach out and touch these fools
Rough these fools, like Manson 'bout to cuff these fools
Say you're thuggin, crippin, bloodin, but your ass is pretendin
Hollywoodin and I'm scopin all them corners you bendin
You see them niggas you chill with is the ones that's gon' get ya
And them hoes you creepin with is them ones that gon' stick ya
In his side like a leak, then your ass is leakin
Homie, how I found out? Boy, you know I ain't speakin
Just consider yourself gone by the end of the night
??Cause fools don't really own yo ass like a diamond bag pipe??
Make a story out your ass like Walter Cronkite
Million muthafuckas swingin off the shit that I write

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Boom Bam ]
It's like 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
The original CMW niggas is back up in the do'
And I'm here to let you know that we're playin for keeps
Don't be prayin up to God when we sprayin your peeps
It's deep, yeah, Boom Bam had to wake up
And realize the whole fuckin crew was about to break up
But fuck that, why should we settle for less?
Other niggas smokin chronic and you settle for stress?
Now I don't know (know) if you heard (if you heard)
About all the muthafuckin niggas we done served
Words never slurred when I speak (when I speak)
And bring the heat to clear you fools off your own street
Now peep, I creep like a scorpion (like a scorpion)
Boom Bam, but you can call me Kevorkian
And I'm assisting you in death if you need me
My appetite to kill, niggas feed me

[ CHORUS ]

[ Tha Chill ]
CMW one time, come on
CMW two times, come on
Yeah
For the real-ass niggas and niggettes
Uknowmsayin
