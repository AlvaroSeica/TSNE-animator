[Solomon Childs]
Never let A.C.S. get ahold of your babies
Cuz life's more important than a bag at Macy's
And who's dissing 50, or whose gaming to groom pretty Vicky
Killa Mob colossal committee, the break down
The love I got for the queens in my city
Listen, you know you work hard, you can get the 745 yourself
Build your credit and develop your own wealth
This dedicated to the women that are C.O.'s
As well as the one's that are P.O.'s
Cuz at the end of the day, that's somebody's mother too
And the same way you demand respect for yours
You gotta respect the next one's too
Whether the profession they in to
Whether the race, it reflects back to you

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Ladies of the world...
Stay far away from trouble, baby girl...
Ladies of the world...
Represent for you, cuz no one loves, look up

[Solomon Childs]
All the real women put ya hands up in the sky
God bless the queens, let them reach the sky
Avoid all the he-say/she-say
And help 'em reach they release dates
Learn to be a positive backbone for the king who holds his own
Rock a steady nine to five, disinfect your home
Help preach to the young, leave the drugs alone
Sister-girl, the club don't pop off, every night, now
T.I. and Papoose they poppin' bottles at the club, every night, now
Not for nothing, everybody take atleast one night off
And I know there's a lot who collect welfare and S.S.I.
But that don't mean run to the training camp to get fly
Meanwhile, your baby at home, eating cold grits fitting to cry

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
The moral of the message is this
Just cuz you came from the rib
Don't mean you can't rule with an iron fist
First come, first serve, and it's power behind positive words
And you live by your mistakes, and you stand as you remain with high stakes
So don't forget that there's different strokes for different folks
In other words, there's all kinds of weather, so get yourself all
kinds of coats, word

[Interlude: Solomon Childs]
I'm telling you girl, you know
Cuz it's like, ain't nobody really gonna hold you down
Help you in your times of battle...
Like you gon' do it for yourself
That's all, it's like stay positive, boo
I see you, I see you

[Chorus]</pre>
