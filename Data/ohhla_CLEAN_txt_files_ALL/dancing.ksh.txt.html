[Ke$ha]
Here we go, welcome to my funeral
Without you, I don't even have a pulse
All alone it's dark and cold
With every move I die
Here I go, this is my confessional
A lost cause, nobody can save my soul
I am so delusional
With every move I die
I have destroyed, our love, it's gone
Payback is sick, it's all, my fault

[Chorus]
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move I die
I'm faded, I'm broken inside
I've wasted, the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move I die

[Ke$ha]
When did I, become such a hypocrite?
Double life, lies that you caught me in
Trust me I'm paying for it
With every move I die
On the floor, I'm just a zombie
Who I am, is not who I wanna be
I'm such a tragedy
With every move I die
I have destroyed, our love, it's gone
Payback is sick, it's all, my fault

[Chorus]

[Ke$sha]
This is it and now you're really gone this time
Never once thought I'd be in pieces left behind {*-ind repeats*}
