[Intro]
And it's, not, smart, to be dumb
It's, not, smart, to be dumb, dumb, de dumb dumb dumb
Back where I come from
It's not, considered smart, to be dumb

[Immortal Technique] + little kid
Okay little empanada, time for bed
  Uncle Felipe
What, what is it now?
  I heard that you and my dad used to be in a gang
{*sighs with exasperation*}
  Is that true?
Who told you that man, your mother?
Really it wasn't a gang aight; we were just a group of friends
  Did you do bad things?
No, no, no - look, we just used to draw on stuff
and play karate, borrow things, throw stuff, y'know?
run around at night, like Goonies
  What's a Goonie?
You never heard of Goonies before?
  Goonies?
WHAT!?

[Immortal Technique]
I coulda chose another life with the feds tryin to get me
Little kids puttin work in like The Gap and Disney
In the whip, high as shit like Bobby and Whitney
Grab your hand and push the motherfuckin pedal to sixty
Harlem cops frisk me to get me to make their quotas
But I told ya, "Siempre hay que separar las drogas"
Bar brawl in the club, poppin and rockin gjaws
Shot it out, leavin bullet holes the size of motzah balls
I love big chicks, never fucked with a slim broad
Played soccer and hammered nails into the shin guards
Gambled at cee-lo with Dominicans, locked in the tombs
We was there for robbin niggaz for them Spanish doubloons
Remember Goonie era graffiti of all sorts?
Now they wanna foreclose on the hood to build a golf course
(WHAT?!) I'll put your hand in a blender to make an entrÃ©e
then cut your dick off, and glue it back on the wrong way

[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
All my Revolutionary soldiers better ride
My word is mathematics bitch, numbers never lie
So even if they tell you I'm dead, nigga I'm still alive
Because, motherfucker, Goonies never die
Witness protection program, rappers better hide
I serve revenge out the freezer, niggaz never slide
So if they tell you I'm gone and you safe, niggaz lied
Because, motherfucker, Goonies never die

[Swave Sevah]
I'm a certified Goonie, the type to burglarize your crib
and leave it smellin like sour and Afghan gooey (true dat)
Life is a movie but yours was filmed on a greener screen
I give you pure uncut raw, no deleted scenes (word)
War with a broadsword, dumpin a tech nine
Slit your throat, give you a Columbian neck tie (arrrgh)
The best buy to get, we let die
Let fly at the next guy that try some shit
Listen~! A few words just to describe my clique (uh-huh)
We like a gang of Spartans walkin on the Gaza Strip
Watch your lip; never say die, it's time to fight and we never run
My Goonies rob niggaz for jewelry, we call 'em treasure hunts
(Get him!) Let him front like he a tough guy with me
I'll hit him, slug turned him to One Eye Willy
Watery grave, hide your chips
I'll hijack your boatload and cruise away on my pirate ship
Nigga!

[Chorus]

[Diabolic]
Yo, check it
Before Duncan Pinderhughes was runnin with Doug E. Doug
My team got away with murder, we ain't fit the bloody glove!
Those jungle breeds and we've come to feed our hungry cubs
with hoes pullin at our pipes like Goonies under country clubs
Let these funny thugs know whoever steps in Bolic's spot
is gettin crushed with solid rock like a Chester Copperpot
I suggest the drama stops, I'll flood blocks with mustard gas
You're up shit's creek, in a rubber raft, cut in half
Cross my fuckin path, I dare you, I'll mangle who lit the fuse
Quick to lose my marbles like Mikey replacin his with jewels
Watchin y'all enslave the game, I'm forced to say the truth
Break the chains quick as Sloth reachin for a Baby Ruth
We got eighty proof and whores in Daisy Dukes, extra low
while fat bitches do the Truffle Shuffle just to get in shows
Fuck what your record sold, respect the code and recognize
The rebel tribe that my people kept alive will never die~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tech] + little kid again
  Why did you wear ski goggles?
Look man, it is way past your bedtime, okay?
  How did you afford all that Polo?
  I know you didn't pay for it
WHOAHH~! Aight man, who's been talkin to you yo?
Never mind, go to sleep
  I don't wanna go to bed
Well it's late
  I want another story
You can't have another story
  Tell me another story
{*speaking rapidly in Spanish*}
  No!
Go to sleep!
  What did you do with all the money?
What money man?
  Can I have some of the money?
I spent it, okay?
  Fucker
WHAT?!
That's what I thought
Now take your ass to bed</pre>
