[Verse 1]
Mommy got high
Daddy was a cop
My brother got fly
Me I was a flop
Was supposed to play ball, college and go pro
Instead I wanna rap, bust gats and smoke 'dro
And if you don't know, 'bout a nigga like P
This is The Diary, without MTV
I grew up in the Bronx, New York City
Home of Hip-Hop, and it ain't nothin' pretty
Everything's dirty 'til it breaks my heart
So I play my part 'til I make the charts
And I keep it gully, I'mma say my part
All the girls they love me, I'm like the ace of hearts
But you don't know what I'm into, or what I've been through
Might sound sentimental on instrumental
I went through so much and remembered so little
From the lights to the ice my life is no riddle

[Verse 2]
Hells yeah mamma dukes was on welfare
$68.50 every two weeks nigga
We tryin' to figure out how we goin' eat nigga
A free-lunch nigga straight to street nigga
Shortys and thugs sippin's 40's and bud
I had the four and the snub on the corner with drugs
That's when I got shot and my daughter was born
Squeaky did her thing when that water was on
I started going hard once the quarter was gone
Twenty-five grams of pain down the drain
I know it sounds insane and a little bit of work
Put a nigga on top from a little bit of dirt
Was a little bit of hurt moms never knew why
Said fuck high school I went to school (high)
Even in junior high school I went to school (high)

[Verse 3]
I was a molested child, stressed and wowed
Well-rested now, success is now
So much drama it's hard to talk about it
So much pride it's hard to walk without it
2004 see me investing
Rest in Peace to Lee-Lee and Preston
Where the fuck is Vee-Vee and D-Rock
Cousin wildin' out up in Queensbridge
You know I'm over there with the heat cocked
Life goes on no matter when the fucking beat stops
I peeped cops, beat pops 'til he dropped
And it ain't over, me and my niggas ain't sober
Can't sell drugs no more, the game over
But the Feds say I'm pushin' weight like 500 pushups straight
Shorty says she cooked a steak so you know I took a plate
Hooker weight, you aint hear about I was a cook upstate
Stood up late thinkin' how the beat say, the hood is bait</pre>
