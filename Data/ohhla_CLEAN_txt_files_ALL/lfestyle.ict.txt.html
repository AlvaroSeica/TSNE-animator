[Opening Skit:]
[Sean E Mac] Yo Yo Ice, what's popping G?

[Ice-T]
Yo, I'm just cooling out Sean E Mac
I was listening to your demo tapes man, you sound kind of hype man
You're gonna blow up this year, boy

[Sean E Mac]
Yeah, you know I don't wanna come out
I wanna go on tour with you, man

[Ice-T]
Yo Homes man, touring ain't what it's all cranked up to be man
This is.. little different than you think man

[Sean E Mac] Yo, what is it really like, baby?

[Verse One: Ice-T]
It's eight A.M. - I roll out my silk sheets
Get fly, crash the limo back seats
Looking in some faces of some ladies that I never met
On the interview tip, no sweat
They ask me questions, I throw the words back
They say they write facts, I know that's bull crap
They're kicking drama, but then drama's my middle name
That's the price your pay for big fame
The cellular phone rings, don't want to pick it up
But it's my J-O-B, I gotta kick it up
Another damn reporter on the line with a word quiz
I got a show cause I'm living in a showbiz
Out the limo to the plane in the pouring rain
I hate flying but there's no time for slow trains
Another show to do, I gotta catch my crew
They left last night, in the bus around two
The plane's a small one, no fun at all!
Bouncing around the air like a tennis ball
When it touches down, I wanna kiss the ground
But it's time to wreck a new town
Get to the arena, meet up with the crew
They tell me all the speakers blew
The cordless don't work, sound man's a jerk
Somebody's gonna get hurt
I'm crazy mad but my fans want autographs
I turn my angry frowns, into fake laughs
I can't be rude cause they won't understand
I ain't no human no more, I'm a superman!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
You can try but you'll never understand this
You can try but you'll never understand this
Try and try but you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich and infamous

[Skit #2: Afrika Islam]
Alright, you got five installs to do
Then after that you got a photo session
Right on dolo, Grandmaster spin, I don't know
There's a fucking bunch of people out there want to see you

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Four hours to show time, oh well!
I might as well check in the hotel
Get a little rest before it's time to play
Ten brothers standing in the hallway
All with demo tapes, they need the hook up
They heard that I was, the one to look up
I can't ditch them cause they already saw me
I'll put my head down, maybe they'll ignore me
No chance - Ice what's going on?
I listened to twenty five songs
And after that, the brothers still wouldn't leave
They started looking at my T.V.
I was gonna break down if they didn't jet soon
Stunk across the hall and crashed in E's room
But then this freak came in, thought I was E
Straddled her legs across me
Ripped off her blouse, pushed her breast against my face
Started gyrating her waist
Sounds fly, like a hype sex thriller?
But see she looked like Godzilla
Pushed her off me, home girl hit the floor
This is what it's like on tour
I hit the hallway, it was crawling thick
Could we take this picture real quick?
Jumped into a pose that I used a million times before
Took pictures with the whole damn floor
I couldn't say No! Not! to my fans
You see they wouldn't understand

[Chorus: Ice-T]
You can try but you'll never understand this
You can try but you'll never understand this
You can try but you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich and infamous

[Skit #3: Afrika Islam]
Alright, would somebody get these fucking whores off the bus?
Get the goddamn girls off the bus, no more backstage bathes
Whose guest is this? ~ let's get everybody out of the room
The whores the hotel is gonna throw us out, where's Ice-T?
He is got to start some more pictures up here
Evil E lost a fucking record, what's going on?

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Now it's show time, time to flow time
Evil lost the records but we still gotta go time
The house is packed, everybody is on their feet
So I say: Throw on Rakim's beat
E hits the Fader and the crowd is lit
I start busting off some new shit
The stage is so smokey that I almost fall off
I start inhaling it, I'm trying not to cough
I'm catching problems from every angle
The mic cords are tangled
I try to flow smooth but my words are mangled
Damn near slipped and broke my ankle
If that ain't enough the police are hawking
Listening real close to the words I'm talking
They wanna put a brother like me in the back seat
Just because I curse the beat
They wanna tap my phone, wanna keep my crib bugged
Call all my homies felonious street thugs
You might say I think this lifestyle sucks?
I wouldn't trade it for a million bucks
Although it's all not glamor and gleam
It's still my dream
You can try but you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich and infamous

[Outro: Ice-T]
Yo, this is dedicated to all my fans
That support Ice-T and the Rhyme Syndicate, Peace!!
I love you, The lifestyles of the rich and infamous</pre>
