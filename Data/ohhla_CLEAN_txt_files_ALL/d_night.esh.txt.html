Esham's back in the house for Devil's Night 
And I'ma get me some gasoline and burn down the whole scene 
Wicked rhymes I be wrestling 
You better cover your ass cuz I'ma put ya in Vaseline 
Stick 'em, stuck 'em, I fuck 'em up and fuck 'em up good 
Freak the funk so I fuck it up like a G should 
Burn your house to the ground and watch you all cry 
Pour gas all around and hope you all die 
The type of arsonist niggas never ever seen 
If you saw me on the scene see me smelling like kerosene 
I got a magic trick, burn you like a drippy dick 
Somebody pass me a Bic on Devil's Night 

Watch a nigga get ill like Fire Marshall Bill 
Gasoline will spill from here to Louiseville 
I got a flame-thrower, arsonist, suicidalist 
Burn your mother fucking ass up to a crisp 
Strike 'em, struck 'em, burn 'em up, fuck 'em 
Fire man come, buck, buck, buck 'em 
Cuz I'm a fireman but I got a gas can 
Shoot a gas can, and blast your ass man 
Shit God damn, I smell smoke 
Slit a nigga throat 
And fuck the okey doke 
Cuz I gotta burn 'em, teach 'em, and learn 'em 
Until I get a turn, burn Hollywood burn 
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire 
We don't need no water let the mother fucker burn 
Burn mother fucker, burn till ya ashes 
I burn niggas up when I get hot flashes 
I slash his throat 
And choke off the gun smoke 
Then blaze that ass like a J on Devil's Night 

Devil's Night, I need a light so I can blaze up 
Police station, wicket Hell raiser 
Playing no games, shit's going up in flames 
No evidence, no nothing, no names 
Return of the dragon, but I'm fire kicking 
Your ass'll be crispy like Kentucky Fried Chicken 
Cracker, burner, nigga, blacker 
I'm a ram shackle 
Snap pop crackle 
Didn't do a thing, with my gasoline 
Until I flame broiled your ass like Burger King 
Now you in trouble, watch your skin bubble 
Settin' me a fire, get away on the double 
Arsonist, watch me just set a fucking blaze 
Watch it burn down, cold staring in a daze 
Wanna set a fire? I'll be ya tutor 
Burn up ya city like the L.A. looters 
When ya set a blaze, ya gotta do it right 
Watch, somebody gimme a light 
On Devil's Night   </pre>
