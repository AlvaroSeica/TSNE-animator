[R. Kelly]
Hey Love may I have a word with you
I'd like to tell you yeah just what I've been going through

[Mr. Lee]
I was kicked back with a brewskie 
with my jaguar playing bootise
scoping out the girls with the biking shorts
chillin' out in the shade by the b-ball court
but then one she excites me
with a shape like yours walking by me
huh just a few seconds you name and your time
and I will guarantee that you will be mine.

[R. Kelly]
hey love you're my one true soul desire
hey love can't you feel this burning fire
hey love there's one thing that I find so true 
when you are near me yeah I go through a change of tune

[Mr. Lee]
I was waiting anticipating for a girl like you so amazing
your personality makes you one of a kind
and when you walk down the street people look from behind
checking out the way that you carry your self
you look real fine because you're in good health.
just a few seconds your name and your time
and I will guarantee that you will be mine

[R. Kelly]
say love when with a cold heart you are dealin'
say love yeah it's an awful hurting feelin'
hey love yeah

[Mr. Lee]
can you feel this burning fire
cause you're my one true soul desire
you're like an around the way girl cool kind of mellow
you can hang with the ladies or chill fellas
you're the type of girl that I always dreamed of
someone I can love share my thoughts and care for
just a few seconds your name and your time
and I knew that you would be mine

[R. Kelly]
Hey love yeah
hey love
hey love
hey love love
hey love love love</pre>
