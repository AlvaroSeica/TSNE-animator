[Verse 1]
Yeah
See, breaking up it's hard to move along it's even harder
It's over she got colder now can't locate where her heart is
And I'm just being honest, since we not even talking
My mind won't let you go
Should ever consider stalking
You know I be teasing though
You know that my ego won't
Thought this was forever love
Guess that was just seasonal
She got back with her old boy
She's probably had a reason though
Although thought that we would grow
Guess that wasn't feasable
But we ain't gotta be beefin tho
I miss you at my recent show
Speak to cj often tho
Sometimes I just wanna speak you up
Yeah, hit you up, or call you up, or send a text
Your new man got my respect
So if I do call it's just a check
Heard that you ight though
My nigga for life though
It's funny how this life go
We love for a while then a light goes
Took me a while just to write those
Pride I had to fight so I'm a stop right here
And I know you don't care
But I hope you got that bite boo

[Verse 2]
Yea tell me bout the love of ours
Contemplate I wrote about it we no longer close or nuttin
that's why she ignore my flowers and my call
and my text spendin her time with him I guess
I regret some sh-t I did but darling is ya'll intimate
who was better I know I was don't you lie
don't blow my buzz you ask me who I'm strokin now
I said that the pool was closed
Can we stay broken up and all these pages close em up
I hope we both do learn from this so my next don't don't gotta be so rough
Gotta get better with time relationships should never rewind
Better leave it all behind guess that means you'll never be mine
well ummm there's a but without your love it's cold as fuck
life is a movie we both say cut
but most the time man the sequel sucks</pre>
