Song:   UK Visa Versa
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

Hey England let's kick it

Cops without guns and the NME
Should I watch the BBC or should I watch the BBC?
Look at these crazy coins, is this Lord of the Rings?
Pounds and pence and Princes and Queens?
Flipside experience, well not really
More familiar than Russia or Chile
Up for cricket or squash, or the London zoo?
Look, you hate George Bush and we do too
Fab music scene, though, UK bands are ace
And you guys are the most polite of the human race
Fish and chips, crumpets, bangers and mash
Shakespeare, Donne, Sid Vicious and the Clash
You love our movies, we kind of like yours
We love the way you talk, "please help help us in these wars"
You stopped staying "fab," we stopped saying "groovy"
Our Scotland is Canada; you saw the South Park movie

[Chorus]
I love England and visa versa
American perspective in these Visa verses
Tea time? Jolly good! Caffeine rush
Look, a red a phone booth and a double-decker bus

I love you England, so let's both ignore
The Boston Tea Party, and that silly East Coast war
Oxford, London, and Guildford too
Rockin' your P.A.'s when I come to visit you

The Florida incident? Democracy at work
But we've still got love for your boy Edmund Burke
If it weren't for us, you'd be speaking German
But then we gave you Hanson and Pee Wee Herman
You gave us the Beatles, and you gave us the Who
We gave you Kris Kross and Vanilla Ice too
You gave us "Chicken Run" and the Teletubies
We gave you McDonald's and got you chubby
You think we're all Trailer Trash obnoxious and noisy
But that's just Springer, Ricki Lake, and Boise
We're friendly and fake and proud of our nation
Overweight, wasting gas, hedonic civilization
We're sue-happy mad overworked compulsive winners
Strong facade but insecure, just think Seymour Skinner
We're obsessed with image, old age and fat
Technology, death, and our dogs and cats
The superbowl, shopping, S.U.V.s and money
Santa Claus, hygiene and the Easter Bunny
But bigger is better and we love our T.V
From L.A. to Boston, to Nashville, Tennessee
And yes 1/4 of Americans own guns
In case you come back to punish your sons
But Mother Britain listen, there's still a tie that binds us
The U.S. isn't perfect, you don't have to remind us

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
