[Intro: unknown speaker]
Cincinnati punk, sucks dick
Can I say that, can I say that?
It's not aggressive, there's no energy in the fuckin music
they're a bunch of fuckin chump rockers
bitin' off the real deal
And everybody here can lick my fuckin filthy crab infested bag

[mc chris]
With my high tech specs I inspect a love less
Sittin in a sun dress, readin Cosmo sex tests
Time for me to conquest I step to impress
It's the best of the rest she says her names Beth
Don't mean to be a pest but can I join (yeeeees)
Says she needs a rest from her daily stress
That's when busty Beth breaks out the sticky sess
And yo we both connect like Akbar and Jeff
I got the snack bar check, Kodak's in my pockets
Sayin word it's occurred if it's a curve then I'm a cock it
Say my name is mc, I've been known to rock it
With Nintendo, a dildo, I'm on it, like Bilbo, the hobbit
The high totin honky, kicks it in Kentucky
Grade ten'll suck me, great trouble fuckin
And all the college co-eds consider themselves lucky
like they was Lopez and my shit was Puffy
Now Beth the busty, wants to get a slushie
Go back to her joint so we can gets lovey-dovey
I flip for that and freeze for the cab I do pay
But when I make the first move the ho say no way

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
Oh you say he's just a friend (oh baby you)
Oh you, you got what I need (got what I need)
But you say he's just a friend (he's just a friend)
But you say he's just a friend (he's just a friend)

[mc chris]
Word, well this is a story about a girl named Corey
that liked to play Atari liked to read Archie
She's browsin Beetle Bailey, I'm browsin the body
that make a Masarati go potty {*pbbt*}
So I step to impress with the jeans so torn
I say my name is mc she say "Word is born"
Never seen a girl like you in a comic book store
She buys four issues of Hulk, I buy four issues of Thor
We walked - out the door practically holdin hands
I say you want a lift? She say "I got a man~!"
Oh you do for real? Well then where he be?
Obviously not in the vicinity
So listen to me, cause my name is mc
When I get up on the mic I make the whole front row pee
My cars a Mitsubishi, the CD the Bee Gees
The song "How Deep is Your Love," cause your so deep into me
  Now how can it be me seen with a geek
  that frequent the joint like a freak every week
  I'm buyin these books for my invalid brother
  You wanna hook up, motherfucker hook another

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Word 'em up oh you (you) you got what I need (got what I need)
But you just say he's just a friend (he's just a friend)
but say he's just a friend (word up)
You (you) you got what I need (got what I need)
But you say he's just a friend (he's just a friend)
You say he's just a friend (word up)
You (you) you got a friend
I look at you, it seems like everywhere I go
You want get it on, that's what friends are for

[Outro]
MC's be bitin off his style like 24/7 right
You know what I'm sayin dig yo dig
It's time to get up off his nuts
yo it's time to get up off his nuts cause you on his shit
I'm down word up word up word up word up
That motherfuckers like funky fly fresh right?
You know what I'm sayin? He has the 98th flavor
you know what I'm sayin?
Little dude's badder than a motherfucker</pre>
