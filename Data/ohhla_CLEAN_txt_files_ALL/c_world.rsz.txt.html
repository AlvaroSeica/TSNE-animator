[Intro: Notch]
One time for your mind
This is not a test, this is an emergency
Listen, this is what I need you to do...
Is get on the dance floor

[Sazon Diamonte]
Before you cross the border
Betta have your shit in order
Cuz now your spots is really playin so stayyyyy

[Red 1]
Aiyyo, we got 'em in a tight grip, but keep it tight lip
For we killa types get live with the mic check
Hit 'em with the right left, make sure it's priceless
Rascalz, Sazon, Van' in these nice sets
So let our word shine like we iced it
For ma familia, gotta keep it righteous
And for me Rassa cuz they don't like us
They try to hold me down but you know we gon rise up
Open your eyes, betta.. hope with them guys up
Who's got the flow to overthrow before your times up?
Enemy or friend, better make your mind up
.9 millimeter, pan ready got 'em lined up
Even though time's tough, we stay mind tough
Yeah, you know where to look if you want to find us
Just follow the crowd and get into the line up
Cuz you could get it - all you gotta do is sign up

[Chorus 1: Sazon Diamonte]
Before you cross the border
Betta have your shit in order
Cuz now your spots is really playin so stayyyyy
It's a crazy world we live in
Gotta get it baby, feel it
Cuz you might find it's so fine yourself this way, so stayyyyy

[Red 1]
I yo meil, burrico reil
Et on a so coma in a de sequa a feit
Es a  de calo, por savor
Bring the heat...

Aiyyo, your fucking with the wrong cat
Who got the bomb rap lookin like a long gat
Sippin on Congac and Banjo - we on that
Feelin no contact, lockin it down like record company contracts
Cuz they broad cats, bug it, blood clot that
All on my nuts, they need to get off that

[Misfit]
We ain't across the battle, whether to choose God to the devil
I live it up revolutionary as a rebel
With a cause to enlighten my people, that's primary
And everything after that is classified secondary
Could we go on?  If we ain't strong, I doubt it
For now, I put the problems away, I'm really crowded with stress
So I go and drink away the pain
Pass me the mic, ain't a club, so watch the rain and be free

[Chorus 2: Sazon Diamonte]
Before you cross the border
Betta have your shit in order
Cuz now your spots is really playin so stayyyyy
It's a crazy world, crazy world, crazy world
It's a crazy world we live in
Gotta get it baby, feel it
Cuz you might find it's so fine, yourself this way, so stayyyyy

[Misfit]
Where you at?  To my people on the concrete rolling that
To them people on your block like strolling when?
You get 'em live start smoking man
This shit be like damn, you can't hold it man
So I drop it like it's hot when I blow an en
Cancel "Friends", this sound when I load an en
Cuz the trigger pulls every clip before a hand
So ease wit it when you load my clip before you stand
Blast your speaker, head leaking when it hit the meter
Scorpio sting lethal bars at your tweeter
And ya heard this new shit set to freak ya
And get ya off, like you smoking reefer
Yo, yo, giving you some more of that
I'm up in the cut, just moving like a running bat
So when I holla shifts, you better send it back
I touched on it in the zone with a paper stack

[Chorus 1]

* Sazon harmonizes until end</pre>
