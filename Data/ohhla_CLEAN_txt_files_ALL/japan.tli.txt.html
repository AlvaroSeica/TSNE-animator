Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Whoa!
I can't believe we're in Japan!
Look at all the lights!
The food!
The people!
Wow!

We're three cool white friends in Japan (Japan!)
We've never been to Japan
So we wrote a song about the three of us in Japan
And our label has to pay for it

Here we are at our five star hotel
The one from LOST IN TRANSLATION (In Japan!)
The views are amazing
And their champagne waiting
Because that's how we wrote it (Yummy!)

And now the label has to pay for the video (yay!)
And pay for everything that we say (no matter what!)
For example I'll be getting a massage right now
And I'll be drinking some sake (So expensive!) (Who cares?)

Here we are at the most expensive sushi restaurant in Japan (mmm!)
And now we're at Tokyo Disneyland
And now we're in Hawaii for one random shot that our label has to pay for!

Cause we're three cool white friends in Japan (In Asia!)
The fact that we're white isn't why we're friends
But we are white, and we're friends (In Japan)

At this point in the video we'll be super drunk (WEEEE!)
Standing near some kind of Dragon
And then we'll buy some stinky used girls panties
Out of one of those pervert vending machines
Now we've seen sumo wrestling live
Unless we get dropped by our label

Cause we're three white douchebags in Japan (That's us!)
It's all part of our master plan
To get some much needed R&amp;R
At the expense of Universal Records

Wow Look at all this Japanese money
It's called Yen
I heard it's worth more than American money
Let's dump it in the river!
{*phone ringing*}
Moshi Moshi
Guys it's the label
This video's really expensive and-
BYE!!

Pokemon!
Dump it in the River!
Our rental car!
Dump it in the River!
This old guy!
Dump him in the river!
And now we're flying home first class!</pre>
