Verse 1 (Chris Styles):

Listen
They Judge me, they got me fucked up
One finger on each, two "I don't give a fuck"s up
My luck's up, is what they keep sayin'
My words are weapons and I'ma keep sprayin'
I'll never lie when I tell 'em I
Do this 'cause it's me, and easy life was never mine
Growing up they're telling me I'm fin to lose my mom
When you find out it's true, that's when you lose your mind
Love is blind, now I'm walking in the shoes of crime
It feels like I'm aging fast and I'm losing time
If I don't do this I ain't being true to me
I'ma make it, that's the difference between you and me
I've made it too far, death was too close
It's an old issue, what you acting brand new for?
In a world full of murder, this shit is shameful
Scoping at the top, a new target to aim to
Thinking 'bout how you'd act if your father raised you
and nowadays most police just want to spray you
I've seen it all, I ain't lying to you
Grandma I miss you, this beat is flying to you
Bars like bullets, when I spit they flying through you
If you hate, you must not know who I am, do you?
I ain't cocky, I'm just taking what's mine
Taking what's mine, that's my life in one line

Chorus (Mike Posner):

Got one foot out the door
and everybody seems so sure
I'm gonna lose my way
As if they were the ones to put the keys in the lock
But I can't smile no more, I can't feel my face
I'ma keep walking forward
'Till the day I turn around and mark back the same as I did
when I came before

Verse 2 (Chris Styles):

They love me, they love me not
They hug me, they sluggin' shots
All I see is the top
Can't take my eyes off the prize, believe it or not
But I ain't falling for what you're trying to be when you're not
There's a bigger picture, whether you see it or not
It's the perfect mixture, why fight it?
Roll another swisher, I'll light it
and let me take you to my world just to see
What it's like to walk in my shoes if you were me
Had to put that behind me
I took a step forward, can't no one rewind me
Better days will come, they forgot to remind me
Almost lost my mind, but I'ma keep shining
Who's the real you, let's be honest
You stuck in the same mind state, I'm beyond it
I'ma keep joggin', 'till the day I run this
Life too short, no time for the dumb shit
On my grind, can you blame me?
Being famous is halfway to being crazy
Being broke is half past being angry
The world could change, but I'll be the same me
Taking a stand, they don't need to save me
I'm what surviving through the struggle made me

Chorus (Mike Posner):

Got one foot out the door
and everybody seems so sure
I'm gonna lose my way
As if they were the ones to put the keys in the lock
But I can't smile no more, I can't feel my face
I'ma keep walking forward
'Till the day I turn around and mark back the same as I did
when I came before</pre>
