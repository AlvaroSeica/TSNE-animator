It was eighty-five
Queensbridge was crazy live
Smitty was an icon
His son had and MB5
Shan was the man on the rap tip
Marley on the beats, Big Wag on the crack tip
Shit was sweet, Trent was a fly nigga
John Boi a live nigga
Treach hung with Ugi, you my heart til I die nigga
Herb was a trouble maker
RK a money maker
Cant forget Wee-Wop he was the illest ball player
86 was when the Bridge stuck together
The era of crack vails and dapadamn leathers
Karena was a funny nigga
Fat Boy a hungry nigga
Wells from the 40 busters was a get money nigga
When Tyrone died we cried with Thomas
Smash had the accident that shocked the projects
Then The Bridge dropped, KRS got on the bandwagon
And did Shan but it was good for hip hop
And 87 hot day mixtapes was bangin
Anita Baker sang while we were slangin
Doing our thing hangin on corners
With Roach that was enourmous
Big Butter was reppin, Dime had the tournaments
Rodney was a flashy nigga
Prince Wally had heat, Mark Allen used to physically smash niggas
Cant forget Yammy with the skill and hand speed
That also it the year we first seen blue vandeeds
Fun and World was gettin it big time
And nigga World was the first nigga I seen wit a five
88 was ill, John Hov got killed
In the summer time niggas parked their rides on the hill
Droughs was a fighter, Spunk was a cash getter
Up was mad skinny but not afraid to blast niggas
Dont even ask about a Queensbridge jam kid
The music was loud and secluded the blastin
Im from 40-15 like Horse and Douler
Alley Joe Mar and Troy the future
Jungle to Wattson fishin the Austins
Puertorican one on the fifth floor snortin
Cant forget Kool Chip Hays and Bo
Spud Black Jay E Flam Mayo
Wallace Snake Hi-C Starby
Gram Wiz Crazy Barry and his brother Robby
A year later we was duckin from Bobby
On the Ave it was Crazy Smalls Black and Party
Kenyon Lisa Inga Richie Opps and Howie
Suiter and Bar Kim the Foul One the hand and hand king</pre>
