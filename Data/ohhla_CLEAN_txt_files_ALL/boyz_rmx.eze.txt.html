[Dr. Dre]
Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word)
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
and bust this crazy shit

[Eazy-E]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin, about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house, and grabbed my clip
with the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside, and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back, and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by N.W.A
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit, it went somethin like this:
Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin that GTA

[Chorus]
Cause the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin nothin in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't sayin shit

[Eazy-E]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man J.B. is on freebase
The boy J.B. was a friend of mine
'til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, L.A. Times first page

[Chorus]

[Eazy-E]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
so I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin that dollar
I pulled up in my six-four Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says somethin, that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldn't believe
so I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
so I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out!

[Chorus]

[Eazy-E]
I'm rollin hard, now I'm under control
Done wrapped the six-fo' around a telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said "Oh brother;
I'll throw it in the gutter, and go buy another"
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head, for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught, for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

[Chorus]

[Eazy-E]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas started a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court, said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "FIRE" - then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah I kicked a little ass
cause that was a blast from the past motherfucker!</pre>
