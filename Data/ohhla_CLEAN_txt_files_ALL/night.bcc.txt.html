Night riders, ni-night riders
Night riders, ni-night riders

[Steele]
Let the games begin
A few good men called in on assignment time to rhyme with
War General connection, black Smif-N-Wessun
Watch your section, the night moves in three directions
calculatin, watch those steps you takin
You never know who lies in the shadows waitin

[Tek]
For you to make a slipup cause they clocked your moves
Peep where you stashed the night and how you rock the ice jewels
You was at the bar mackin, blowin up the Jack when
they caught you off point and stripped you of your royal fashions
You thought it couldn't happen -- cause youse the talk of the block
But you just been rocked in your man's gamblin spot

[Buckshot]
Ride on, you see B.D.B. when you come on down
You see Smoky Ride when you come on down
You see S-T when you come on down
You see B.C.C.

I float, I fly, I walk with the devil
by my side, always and forever days I
battle the demon, schemin on my riches
Cause my family switched from un to organized thoughts
and we organize now, how you like that?
We strike right, B.D. got you on the eye
so I got you trapped, but it seems like the blueprint
ain't made for that, those devilish and wickedness ways
But look at how the wicked get splayed
The image that the wicked is goin in time, but
time is the illusion, Buck keep the conclusion
You better believe when you walk dem streets
Walk witcha eyes up when you rise up
I see, cause every mornin that I wake up there's always
a five in the air ready to fuck with me
So what cha'll here to represent -- Boot Camp
What we here to represent -- Boot Camp
What cha'll people represent -- Boot Camp
What we here to represent -- B.C.C.
When you come on down, you see B.D.B.
When you come on down, you see S.T.
When you come on down, you see Smoky Ride
When you come on down, you see B.C.C.
What cha'll here to represent -- the Boot Camp

[Buckshot]
Hah, connection connect to resurrect those who think
mind detect if you keep my people in check, one thought
elevate, manifest light
We keep my people equal in my eyesight

[Steele]
Duck Down Entaprizin, tryin to get right
I fight cause I believe there's more to life
There's a mark on my head, but ain't the mark of the beast
but I got beef cause the beast keep runnin up in my piece

[Tek]
I'm hearin rumors fly about me that I moved from the hood
Bought a crib out in 'Lanta like it's really all good
And there I push a Ac' with my wifey and seeds
Got hits that play the yards and I'm sittin on G's
Cause Da Shinin went gold but you've been falsely told
Don't believe in everything your ears and eyes behold

[Buckshot]
And just when you thought it was safe -- surprise
Open your eyes -- B.C.C.'s on the rise
Heh, don't get mad, you see, change is good
If what you learn don't change, yourself
then why are you learnin what you learnin?
Listen, change is good
and we doin this elevatin in the neighborhood
So all my people if you wit me, throw your hands in the air
and let me know you're with B.C.C.

*singing to end*
