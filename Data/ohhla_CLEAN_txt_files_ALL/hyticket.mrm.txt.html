[Mr. Mike]
Increase the crime rate, I enter your mind state like blind dates
(Unexpected) Who's that murderous one from Texas?
You're injected with this, a cannabilist, eat niggaz alive like onyx
(Skip America) Nigga please, way overseas I'm most wanted
(Boo-ya) Chronic orbitin' me like the comet
You're puttin' yourself in a zone of terror, a phone'll never reach me, I'm too blunted
(So high) Niggaz get haunted by the black ghost
My rap quotes is like nines, disconnect spines, (defy) to leave your back broke
No lactose in my blood veins, a thug's game is creation
Plus motivation, communication and patience
They hate me when I bust, check my vocals I ain't even cussed
Thus, I'll split yo' shizit if it is just a must
Trust no bitches, they be wicked like witches
My riches is filthy, I plead guilty now these niggaz be wantin' to kill me
(Why Mr.?) Because they can't feel me
I'm seein' death before my eyes 'cause the despise be out to get me...</pre>
