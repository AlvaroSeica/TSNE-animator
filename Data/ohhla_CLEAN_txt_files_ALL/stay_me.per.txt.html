[Promise]
Yeah, I went from being just a regular Joe
To everyone being in my cellular phone
Now I feel like film, my skill's not getting exposed
This moment should be etched in a stone
A lotta hi's, lotta byes when I exit the shows
I get a lotta hugs and kisses, lotta X's and O's
Semi-colons, hyphens, brackets, smiley face
From a lotta friends who weren't friends back in '98
But it's all good, just sometimes I wish y'all would
Not get starstruck
I'm still the same guy from this small hood
Who tried to show you it's all love
I can be compared, but I can't, I won't
I rap and I sing, 'cause I'm a fan of both
What I figured out, once the buzz fizzle out
Like an open can of Coke, they gon' hope for anecdote

[CHORUS  Zeyon]
I've been more than ordinary
Where were you when I just lived down the street?
Ain't it funny how things done changed?
Making moves and now you know my name
This is just the same old story
You won't know what's around until its gone
No point in holding on
I ain't gon' change but i'mma stay me!
 
[Dan-e-o]
I was a kid with a dream, a head full of steam
Destined for cream of the crop status, the best on the team
That is, I thought I was enormous, automatically born for this
Confidence at it's ultimate, awesome skills, found no fault with it
Rappers forfeited when I walked in, ready to do battle
Convinced they never heard of an MC until they knew Daniel
But true, annual income was slowly becoming victim
To ambitions that see friction if you ain't part of the system
But it's alright, I stand my ground in this tall fight
Come out on top amidst y'all spite
Keep writing rhymes you'll find that chicks call tight
Knowing I'll rock them hits all night...right
No I ain't smoke weed, but yes I got dreads
I know you don't believe me, same thing the cop said
But I'll continue knowing my role, it saves my health
In this movie, I'm for real, you just played yourself

[CHORUS]

[Promise &amp; Dan-e-o]
Hey yo, it's perfeckly strange for words to arrange
In a verbal exchange, patterned so it serves in His name
You got me feelin' like really? My purpose is vain?
Dear I am, here I am thinking I'm purposely made
Word, see I'm saying this game has got shady types playing like
We can take a hike if on the charts we don't make a spike
But I ain't trying to live a player's life, okay I might
Love what I'm doing making the music that haters like
Everything we spray is hype, every single rhyme is true
That's a guarantee, I fully Dan-e-o and Promise you
You hear what I'm saying, right? listen to what I'mma do
Take the pattern that Dan-e-o did and just follow through...
But stay me...

[CHORUS] (x2)</pre>
