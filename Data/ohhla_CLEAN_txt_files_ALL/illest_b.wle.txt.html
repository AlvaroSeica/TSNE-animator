[Intro]
Turn that be, the music up..
I got to fight this, I want to fight the music, on this one
I was gonna write you a poem today
But I was like, fuck it, I was feelin' myself, you know?
{Tha Bizness}

[Chorus]
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, that my sista and I'm so proud how she hold it down
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
Pray you rich in confidence, now I'm paying you mind
Look, the illest bitch alive, reallest bitch alive...
Yeah, one time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive...

[Wale]
Hold up..
Working out 9 to 5 keeping them babies fly
Know the time, know what it's like one notice your plight
No one notice your struggle, no one know what it's like
How you hold in emotion 9 months while holding in life
Man, straight and no fuckin', women's pain got her stressin
I can't touch her, so for pleasure I get special attention
Yeah this the illest bitch alive, I love her freaky side
And the deeper that mean she get the sweeter rise for that

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Yeah, look..
Baby father bullshittin', you two don't even speak
Ain't seen his seed in 14 days, that nigga too weak
Couple shy of a month, I ain't running you up
When it be too loose or you be too late we ain't tying no knot
And I know it's double standards when you're fucking with us
But I pray these everlasting groupies don't fuck up this love
New Louboutins when she dressin', Louboutin; please correct me
Stretch marks make her self conscious, I kiss em' when we sexing
Yes, it's the illest bitch around, flawless and brown
Smoking loud, blowing down when the law ain't around
When it comes to underwater I get nautical shawtie
Yeah, you leavin' alone but came here with multiple shawty
Yes it's that..

[Chorus]

(Fuck it though, I got a little bit for her, haha)

[Outro: read as poetry]
And I promised myself I wouldn't tell you this shit today
But, tomorrow's uncertainty promotes the urgency in this shit I'mma say
Perfection doesn't exist if it doesn't consume her and the truth hurts
And this world's mine, but the womb is her's
Ms. Mother Nature I pray that our daughters carry and favor your genes
And when you take off your jeans you get all the me that you need, haha
That you allow me to work it 'til you know what your actual worth means
And for what it's worth, I hope a couple words could help you see..
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive...
Uh, illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive...</pre>
