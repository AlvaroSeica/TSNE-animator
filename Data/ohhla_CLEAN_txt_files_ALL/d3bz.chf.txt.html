[Popa Chief]
I keep my hand on a swivel
Cuz niggas nowadays ain't having it, not even a little bit
I stay using my parapheals, I peep the bullshit, way before the jump off
I make pimps bleed, more lead than a pencil
A monster over any instrumental, loco enla cabeza
A forty ounce herbal omelet chaser
Rub you out, don't make me erase you
The sling slang master, five mics I'm after
Something extra, fucking heavy in the hoster
Not a thug, I just protect mine, like I'm suppose to
So if you see the flash, I might not be there, cuz you duck
Shirt untucked, I deal, you cut
Hit the deck, pop the trunk, Mary Watson ain't raise no punks
What I prefer, not to act a fool, play it cool
Respectable, to laying a puddle of piss, shitting too
Let the window down slow, hit the cruise
The last one to squeeze, be the first one to snooze
You show respect you get respect, my niggas will tell ya
Kiss they ass and show you the tech

[VVS]
Ya'll two for five, we three for nine
Ya'll three for nine, we four for twelve
Lower the price, we taking you out, we gangsta as hell
I'm a bad muthafucka like Samuel L.
Got cocaine prices like a manual
Move a unit like birds, they scoping my words, how I'm doing now
Pull up to the club wit a trunk that got these groupies looking like --
They know who I'm is, how I roll, who I'm wit
And if you acting up, we sliding ya'll, we don't give a shi
I'm in this muthafucka, bezzle neck, shiny wrist
And that killa with me, his mouth, toss like a six
Multiply that times five, that's in the clip
Peep me, mug and an extra chick gon' catch in yo whip
I got a couple fully auto, for the rest of your click
Don't taunt it, if you don't spark it, you ain't biting, don't bark it
I said, don't talk it, if your ass don't walk it
Don't taunt it, if you don't spark it, you ain't biting, don't bark it
I said, don't talk it, if your ass don't walk it</pre>
