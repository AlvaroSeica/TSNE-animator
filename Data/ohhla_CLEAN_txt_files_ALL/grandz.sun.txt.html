Chorus: Sunz of Man  2X

Yo Sunz of Man

60 Second Assassin:

Yo check how we charge card manag` a `trois 
All on his repertoire fifty-two block 
Avoidin hisself from gettin shot
Skill a kill any deliver
Matinee track prostitution whole money go get her
Collaborate real rap 
From overseas track
Jury cars, heaterz, dime plane tickets
Passports, charge cards, and visas
Shareholders and stock brokers
Sex pleasers, play ya older
Stop short, oh no you aint know Sunz sees ya
Under and over, walk soft we tap ass 
Dont talk Sunz be about this made cash 
Flip ass certified endorsement
Bobblin for the playahaters
Loan sharkers and money faders
Non-believers from New York to Massapequa
Hondura to Peurto Rock to Puerto Rica
To gray Caesars , come greet ya
Risked on this blood clot leaker
The hasta la vista 

This be the Sunz of Man (Sunz of Man)  What

Chorus: 2X

Prodigal Sunn:

Check the world premiere
Im loud and clear in ya atmosphere
From Philly to Cali, Crooklyn we show no fear
This be that deep knocker shit
DJs keep rockin it
Aint no stoppin it
Yo my topic is logic 
You may say toxic
But I rain rain from the grain grain 
Sustain maintain my name name
In this rap game, Im out to stack cream like Russel Simmons
I love my black women from Erykah Badu to Robyn Givens
How you livin?
This crack Im feelin
Its blood spillin
Wildin in ya crib and four wheelin a thug villain
Fuck the world dealin
Fuck the drug dealin 
Fuck the drug dealin

Hell Razah:

So we can teach our people whats right from whats wrong
If you miss that bring it back Brooklyns my home
Sunz of Man jam now kings of the throne
When you see me salute me 
Im where the loot be 
Dollar bills be my groupies
Some kill for jewelry 
Black businessmen move interestin
Too quick to see us sentenced in
This criminal court
My money talk keep my lawyer listenin
Gold cheddar lyin glitterin 
Brooklyn citizen
Women smelling like cinnamon
The street theme song
Lose your life if you scheme wrong
They wait for you to get your drink on
And put your link on
If clubs was the jungles we the hyenas
Mindreaders 1999 leaders 
Who watch what they feed us
Cash in my corporation, infiltration
From genesis to revelations
Same nation no lyin my team slam like Kobe Bryant 
Young lions strappin through New York holdin irons
Smoke weed, a twenty sack through tracks
See our money back this years apocalypse
Aint no time for your funny raps
Medina to L.A. 
To Marina del Rae
Never do what Simon say
Stay original
Israel break the spell 
Records sellin clientel
Next world Mexico Roswell
Free the jail cells

Chorus: 6X 

This be the Sunz of Man jam</pre>
