Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby

[Verse 1]
I felt the beat in my heart
Other niggaz pump they brains
Give me the dank and strains, I'll hop into my paper plain
Niggaz run they mou-ou, shit I do the same
The only difference is I'm getting it bitches
Cause money addiction, the addict is unrestricted to the life that I'm living
Man the life that I was given was purposely handed to me
I swear it was granted to me
I'm rose gold frozen, my nigga you granite to me uh
That was what I call a fun time punch line
With'cha bitch in the summer time and guess what, she undermines
Under minded, you have to underline it
A literate, triple six
What he fuck the time is (Golf Wang)

[Chorus]
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby

[Verse 2]
I flow so hard, you can't tell if my dick or gun'll bust
I'm sick I need that robituss' and that lobster stroganuff
I'm faded, chauffeured up, smokin' up
Rollin' up another dutch
Amsterdam where the women are dutch
Freaks that don't talk much
Red-heads gimme that bed-head
I told Becky to give me that red-neck
And I'm rocking my Nigga hat
Like a nigga back and my nigga strapped
Gun shot with it, guns shot with it, (click) gun shot with it
I'm a be a fucking legend like 2Pac &amp; Biggie
And smoke the signals to tell the lord to come and get me
Or a higher power to arrive in an hour
I got to blow this ounce and put my shades on so let's bounce (yep)

[Chorus]
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby</pre>
