[Intro: Netta Brielle]
Jesus loves me! This I knowwwww
For the Bible, tells me sooooo
Ooooh

[T.I.]
Sometimes I wake up feel like I'm in Forrest City, Arkansas
Although I'm free I'm still a prisoner of all I saw
Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 AM and ride down Simpson
Just prayin homie, and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I'm still in prison
I reach out for Tameka hand, I'm trippin cause she missin
It's pitch black dark, like I'm in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me
It seems like Satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former friends talk about me like I'm dead and buried
Bastards want me in the casket 'fore my head cold
Trouble in my soul, the devil got a hold
Did everything to me but kill me like he did to Job
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold
He took my business interest, he took my wife and kids
But he can't take nothin God can't give me back again

[Netta Brielle]
Hallelujah! Hallelujah
Hallelujah! Halleluuuuuujah
Hallelujah! Hallelujah
Hallelujah! Halleluuuuuujah

[T.I.]
I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again
It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that whale again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again
Like Lazarus I've risen from a bed of death again
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men
I read the psalms of David, prayed to be like Solomon
God's wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
I'm a king, I dare to lead when they just followin
I see a better way, I'm keepin my eyes on the sparrow
I'm exitin my Egypt, tell 'em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me 'fore she left this earth that I was special
And because I'm special, they gon' make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas, but he arose on the third day
To save ya, here to give favor, let the church say

[Outro: Netta Brielle]
Hallelujah! Hallelujah
Hallelujah! Halleluuuuuujah
Jesus loves me! This I knowwwww
For the Bible, tells me sooooo
Yes He loves me! This I knowwwwwww yeah
For the Bible, tells me sooooooo
Ohhhhhhh</pre>
