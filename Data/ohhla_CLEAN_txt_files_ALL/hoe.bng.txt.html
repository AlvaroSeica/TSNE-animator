When I think about you, I think hoe
When I dream about you, I think hoe
It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe
When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe
When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe
Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe
Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe
Hoe

These hoes only fucking with a nigga, with them figures
You ain't got it, them bitches ain't fucking with you
Stop saving these hoes, fuck these bitches
Stop bringing them around a real nigga
'Cause a hoe gonna be a hoe and a bitch gonna be a bitch
Don't put your dick up in a hoe that make you money
And these hoes fucking different niggas every night
But she still be up in church every Sunday
So bitch, tell the DJ play my shit
And tell your home girls to get with it
Don't be ashamed to be a hoe, if you a hoe, then let them know
You getting money and they need to fuck with it

When I think about you, I think hoe
When I dream about you, I think hoe
It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe
When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe
When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe
Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe
Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe
Hoe

When I wake up in the morning, I think dough
Bad bitch, fall for all the rap niggas, she a hoe
Got a 100 thousand likes and a million something followers
I'm a street nigga, I'm just tryna get my dollars up
Kirko Bangz and my nigga YG
Yo Gotti, trill nigga, ask your hoe about me
Real nigga shit, don't do that, get your feelings hurt
Want a red bitch in a mini skirt
Chanel boots, Celine purse
Shorty not a stripper but can make it twerk
When you think about me you think bread
When I think about you, I think head

When I think about you, I think hoe
When I dream about you, I think hoe
It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe
When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe
When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe
Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe
Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe
Hoe

These hoes gonna be hoes
You cuffing and loving her, but she fucking on the low
And I'm like damn, bitch, what you saying?
Hoe, you know you got a man
But she gonna fuck all the niggas that all the bitches is fucking
And she gonna post all them pictures that she don't look like in public
She gonna be in the club, bottles popping, she boppin'
When the sparkles start coming, bitches start table hopping
And I'm like every city we go, every other video, there she go
I see the same dusty ass hoe, I see the same hoes

When I think about you, I think hoe
When I dream about you, I think hoe
It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe
When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe
When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe
Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe
Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe
