(Max Minelli: verse 1)
I'm turnin soft into hard got me a foot in the door
Got um' chopped out since last time looking for more
I got it you want it you need to holla at the boss
The spicy the fire ???? pepper sauce thats all me
I'm a whole new nigga ya heard
One thug the upgrade that's my nigga my nerd
Sick with this here nigga your tender hearted
I'm Max Pain bitch spit been retarded
You still trying to do shit ya know I started
But that's all gravy cause I'm so gangsta mane
Straight up I come here to frustrate
Running up in niggaz shit stretching out the ducktape
You know me I'm Max you know half the loc
You no fond of us you know ?? flow
I'm one thousand and eight grams kilo dope
No fraud whodie I go hard

[Chorus]You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin'
You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin' (I dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga

(Max Minelli)

But if it gone be somethin' nigga you gone see somethin'
We gone show you how we do this kinna shit where we from
Comin' with them thizzangs I know I ride with me one

(C-Loc: verse 2)
Oh my, o o oh my Lord
This nigga bout to make me catch a motherfucking charge
Look maybe its because I skip the lines at the door
Or maybe this clown boy just finding out I'm fucking his hoe
Look nigga back up boy it aint safe you gettin' to close
My nerves bad I take it wrong and go to work on your nose
Look talkin trash get you blast when you walk out that door
Look put bout four off in his ass just for showin mane ??
Look I write rhymes but I bust nines fuck what you heard
In the write place at the wrong time ninety fool for the bird
Look it's Max Minizzle and that Baton Rouge physco
That Iron made it wiggle on the second he hit the floor

[Chorus]You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin'
You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin' (I dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga
dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga play with me wrong)
Do somthin' do somethin do somethin do somethin'
You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin'
You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin' (I dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga
dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga play with me wrong)
Do somthin' do somethin do somethin do somethin'

(Max Minelli: verse 3)
We at the ??? I never say what I would do if I was you
Here go another one for niggaz to start drama to
Hard up make my hustle bitch its what my father do
Pay attention nigga dont you let the streets swallow you
I hardest regaurdless bright days dark nights
Jump in that water gets sliced like a shark bite
Nigga thought I was a dawg and you thought right
3 day flight my fresh T lookin off white

I know the Lord know God never state no braud
And you dont want no parts I go hard if you dont like it

[Chorus]Do somethin' do somethin'
You don't like it nigga
Do somethin' do somethin' (I dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga

Do somethin' do somethin' (I dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga
dare a nigga play with me wrong, I dare a nigga play with me wrong)
Do somthin' do somethin do somethin do somethin'

(Max Minelli)
