[Intro: Rick Ross]
Huh.. 
{M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
In the world of so many
Baby girl, you are that one
I deserve that, I deserve you
Huh...

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
(I'll do anything that you say
 Anything 'cause you the boss) 
You the boss, you-you-you the boss mayne
You the boss, you-you-you the boss mayne
You the boss, you-you-you the boss mayne
You the boss, you-you-you the boss 
You-you-you-you-you the boss, you-you-you the boss mayne
You the boss, you-you-you-you-you the boss mayne
You the boss, you-you-you the boss mayne

[Rick Ross]
Rozay a born stunna, I could blow money 
Fifty when I'm shoppin, that ain't no money
I got my jeans saggin, money stuffed in 'em
I got 40 whips, way too much in 'em
I need me a queen, I need me a dime
Livin this fast life, just show me a sign
I'm a G, I-I-I-I-I'm a G 
Took her from the lame, put her on that condo on that beach (WHOO!)
All she needs, ah-ah-ah-ah-all she needs
is a boss on my level who provides every need
All I fiend is a queen in my presence
I can hold until I die, couple Gs' in her Bezel
I'm a boss

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Still runnin the streets 'cause +every day I'm hustlin+
Double MG went in and the streets is lovin it {M-M-Maybach Music}
All this paper comin and my baby touchin it (WHOO!)
I pin her to the wall, you know this boy be BUS'IN it
Fur coats in the winter, look like a polar bear
Stunnin in the snow, these haters they can go somewhere
Indoor pool (WHOO!) - Outdoor pool (WHOO!) 
Indoor court, talkin Ray J. moves
Seven Rolls Royces, pink slips like a boss
Champagne on her body, time to lick it off
Me and baby girl a winning combination
Ownership is my conversation, I'm a boss

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj] (Rick Ross)
Oh... (Talk to me) I watch...
You play... (What'chu sayin, baby?)
And I'll dooooo, whatever you say
(Boss) Oh I, Ohhhhh I-iiiiii watch you play
And I'll dooooo, whatever you say

[Chorus]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj] (Ross)
You could take it anyway you want to
Baby I promise that I'll never disappoint you
Just watch how I make it my motherfuckin point to
Get a raise.... (Huh!) Get a raise~! (Huh!)
Oooooooooh-ooooooooooh-aaaaaah
(You only live once baby, let's do it big..c'mon)
You the b-ah-ah-ah-OSS (BOSS), the b-ah-ah-ah-OSS (BOSS)
You the b-ah-ah-ah-OSS (Huh!), the b-ah-ah-ah-OSS-man (HUH!)
...You the b-ah-ah-ah-OSS, the b-ah-ah-ah-OSS-man

Hey daddy won'tchu come and be my boss? (Yea)
