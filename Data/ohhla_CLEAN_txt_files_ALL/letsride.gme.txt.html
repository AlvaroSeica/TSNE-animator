[Hook]
You gon' ride or die? (echo)

[Verse 1]
All my niggaz gon' bust their guns
Real motherfuckers never trust niggaz, but we trust our guns
Get money is the code of the streets
Live by it and they say the hotter the bullets the colder the streets
Like, the older the hammer the older the beef
You holding the cannon, you bust it or you die with your heat
Me and my niggaz are going to survive in these streets
For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggaz, just dying to sleep
I'm in the hood and I don't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO with a pump in the seat, and a desert eagle in the head rest
Live and I took five, get respect 'cause I will die
So it's a bet that I'm gon' ride

[Chrous]
I'm ridin' dawg, you ridin' with me? Ride with me
If I'm firin' dawg, you firin' with me? Fire with me
If I'm dyin' dawg, you dyin' with me? Die with me
Just know that when the beef comes, we're all busting our guns (What?)

I'm ridin' dawg, you ridin' with me? Ride with me
If I'm firin' dawg, you firin' with me? Fire with me
If I'm dyin' dawg, you dyin' with me? Die with me
Just know that when the beef comes, we're all busting our guns (What?)

[Verse 2]
We can beef, I don't give a fuck
Any street, stoop or block
Compton, New York City, or what?
You ain't never been out the hood don't go too far
12 gauge shotty with a pump like Joe du Mask (sp?)
Shells the size of Spree Wheel lugs go through cars
Rip apart a new Bently nigga like Dre sent me
The haze in me, make me want to kick back
Your man work out at Bally's but the .38 to a six-pack
And beef keep the ER full, 'till the shit packs
No more rooms? Let him die in the streets
I'm from th C-P-T where niggaz dying to eat
Them niggaz with scars under their left eye and their cheek
Park a 745 in your street
Like motherfucker if you don't ride with me
You can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedys nigga
A empty desert clip's out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got niggaz that will beef for the game run up on your man
Splatter his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood money, you better pay up
'Cause I roll with killers that will put you in a hole like a lay-up
They don't sleep on the block, they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales?
Be in the XXL, and it's only six street rappers if you want to be real
That'd go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggaz
Say my name in the verse if you ready to die
I'll call up my Harlem niggaz on that I-95
Ten minutes later you're dead on the I-95
Aftermath motherfucker, we ain't playing this year
50, Buck, Dre, Joe, Cube, The Game and Em
It's our house, so we in the front yard
So fuck with the Doctor and get picked apart like junk yards

[Chorus]</pre>
