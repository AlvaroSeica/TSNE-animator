Today I wasn't even gonna take a shower
And then I got a call sayin that my cousin died in a fire
So I washed myself for what seemed like three hours
With tears and rusty water
I need some of that Calgon take me away action immediately
Before I start scrubbing my hands hard repeatedly
I'm stuck somewhere lethargic between reality
and a fuckin Tool video - WAKE ME UP!
I've said goodbye too many times in these 22 long ones
And here I am wavin again; so long friend
I should have told her how this town doesn't like it when people leave
So it finds ways to keep them
It sows seeds and reaps them
And now she's part of that harvest, but different from all the others
Ask her mother how her smile touched souls and warmed cold hearts
Monique I miss you
I wish I could've kissed you farewell
and given you that tattoo you always asked for
But when I'm done tattin Thug Life on God's stomach
You got next; I'm done, y'all take what you want from it
I'm goin to wash my hands
I miss you girl</pre>
