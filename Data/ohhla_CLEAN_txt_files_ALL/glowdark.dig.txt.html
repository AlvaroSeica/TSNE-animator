Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Can you see me glow in the dark
I'm one with the stars, and never too far
Yeah

Anything worth living is worth dying
Anything worth getting is worth trying
I put myself in the shoes of a giant
With double tube socks, two knots and I tied it
I was frightened, I was tired
But I knew that one day I would triumph
Heard a million "no"s
All it took was one "yes"
Now I'm blowing like the wind
Underneath the sun dress
Ah yes, I can smell the victory
They used to pick at me
Now they picking me
To be the one to hold the torch of liberty
I'll tell you every deed till I see that vividly
I tried to warn y'all since airborne
I'm cold like I left the air on
I'm dope, I'm dope hair on
The world's gonna know from now on

Can you see me glow in the dark
I'm one with the stars, and never too far
Yeah
I can see you closing your eyes
So don't be surprised
All it takes is a spark
Till I glow in the dark

I illuminate, I shine
Nothing happens
Before its time
And its time, its time, its time I glow in the dark

I illuminate, I shine
Nothing happens
Before its time
And its time, its time, its time I glow in the dark

I never let them tell me what I can't do
God won't give me anything I can't handle
One candle can light all the rest
I'll live forever like I got a bite on my neck
Through my music, through my songs
This is your amusement, this is my songs
My God, forgive them for adultery
Diggy underscore simmons do you follow me
Do you dig me, through your history
This didn't happen over night, quite the contrary
I've been working all my life
You hear what you hear
I work hard to get it right
They can measure light, but they can't measure darkness
I ain't earn my stripes, that's preposterous
First I couldn't grab 'em now look at how I have them
Who would've thought that your thought it couldn't happen

Can you see me glow in the dark
I'm one with the stars, and never too far
Yeah
I can see you closing your eyes
So don't be surprised
All it takes is a spark
Till I glow in the dark

I illuminate, I shine
Nothing happens
Before its time
And its time, its time, its time I glow in the dark

I illuminate, I shine
Nothing happens
Before its time
And its time, its time, its time I glow in the dark

Who is more foolish: the child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light?
Glow in the dark
Don't be afraid for everything around you is within you
Illuminate
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark</pre>
