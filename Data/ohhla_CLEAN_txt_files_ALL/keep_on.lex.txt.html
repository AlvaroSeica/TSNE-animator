keep on movin'

[Verse 1: Big Oak]
from the depths of the underground I twist and turn
bring my pen to the surface level so kids can learn
I don't have mansions so I talk about my skills
I'm in to expansion of all my mental builds
see it's picturesque, don't you enjoy the scenery?
underground MCs equivalent to honey bees
forced to work for little pay through to something called drive
a magnetic attraction to the wish to keep it live
once you walk in the door it's very hard to exit
addicted to the outcome like a junkie searching for his next fix
I move swift and make decisions on the go
this game moves so fast and I don't wanna miss the boat
or miss my next chance to shine with my designs
so I pay attention to what happens and change the time
I've had my ups and downs that turn me sideways
but I keep at it similar to a bad habit
with a strong fist I grab it, now it's in my possession
I stay honest in this valley of deception
?? massive egos and dodging sly agendas
learning who is good people and who is a pretenda
I'm recognizing when it's my turn to run
and I'm also realizing that this path has just begun, see
the key is to stay humble in the face of praise
and also stay afloat when they disgrace the ?
so keep movin' with the poise
keep movin' with the quickness
keep movin' on the track that prepares you for attack
I keep movin', no one misses mine, not a rhyme piece
my name is Big Oak and I just spoke my piece

[Chorus - 2X]
Yo, this is dedicated to everybody who (keep on movin')
is not doing exactly what they wanna do (keep on movin')
and this is dedicated to (keep on movin') everybody that's spending money
life and time addicted to rap (keep on movin')

[Verse 2: Nick Fury]
? is from the root of NIKE that means victory
so it's given in my name that there's no trick to me
try to picture me without this, lifeless and (?cloutless?)
livin' low key like one story houses
most men are like mouses, they searchin for the cheese
but the crumbs, don't really seem to add up
so I walk with my hat up
lookin for the best route to point be
and not let the curves disappoint me
nobody said it would be easy doin' all of this at once
go to work, go to school, make music, smoke blunts
aim for the fence, ring away, when I'm showin' bunt
still satisfy myself and give 'em what they want
see I'm a full-time MC, a night job rapper
a positive thinker, but an over-reactor
a slacker, but of my craft I'm a master
an eye on success and an eye on disaster
the combo of it all could make a weak man fall
so I stand like a giant, though I'm not that tall
I just labour and labour until I savour the flavour
and everyday, my hair it gets a little bit grayer
but I love it, that's why everybody does it
the rock star life, on the fast full budget
see ten years ago, I wrote my first verse
ten years later, universally dispersed
so I'm showin' and provin, 'till the don't hate me
keep on movin' like a family in the navy
I ain't got a job on some pin me or pay me
I've been around the block and even taken it lately

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
