[Remedy]
I seen it all from the great channel wall
While we brawl, babies crawl to the leaky-leak down fall
Many of men die for the get high
And why blatant bloody murders with twenty for alibi
Natural disasters, the real hidden masters
Open road, lives got grazed in green pastures
High priced to low portfolios with no clothes
In bungalo's dealing with some cons and pros
Open flows, the show, go and blows a-stray
Licking shots at the beaken like in JFK
Crazy thousands of faces, a few car chases
In places, power moves mad with no traces
Welcome home embraces in families of racist
I hate this, still yet I hide from the faceless
Some tape thier flow guns thinking that they're shoguns
Say, "Yea, we'll produce ya, but ain't fucking no ones"
Hybrid, subtiva, big bud grabs his skunk
Number one flying high on my way to the sun

[Chorus: Remedy]
I seen it, freeped it, lived it, peeped it
Fucked up gangsters, jokesters and prankers
I seen it, freeped it, lived it, peeped it
The backstabbers, the click, smash and grabbers
I seen it, freeped it, lived it, peeped it
Blowing out of speakers, hundred dollar sneakers
I seen it, freeped it, lived it, peeped it
Keep your ears and eyes open

[Remedy]
Master lock-picks, cess, candy-apple corvettes
Crazy gambling, debts, bets on the internet
Trances, day-to-day chances, catching glances
Hard rocks in stance, three hundred g advances
Disease through injection to spread the infection
Protection, stay aware, we're the masters of deception
Moving like the French Connect', change like seasons
Tales of high treason for unknown reasons
Made men turning over, playing dead like rover
Seen the fiend in the boulder, yo, look over your shoulder
Look into the life of the white Isrealite
Fish scale, crysatlite, thief in the night
I seen the light behind the white picket fences
The battle commences, defenses are useless
Your stripped of your senses
Chemical imbalance, high off lithium
Seen g's overseas and money stashed in Switzerland
Countless divorces, grown men on pail horses
US armed forces been took to the sources
I seen it all through my crystal
Quick, grab my pistol

[Chorus]

[Outro: Remedy]
Freeped it, lived it, peeped it
