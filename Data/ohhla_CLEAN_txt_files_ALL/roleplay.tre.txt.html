[Trey Songz]
Ay
I just got a idea
You know
thinking of some things we could do
Spice things up {*laughing*}
Fa sho'

If I snuck up in yo bedroom
touch you while you sleep
would you act suprised as if you didn't know it's me?
I came to steal your heart, girl, don't call the police
I only want a part, girl, really just a piece
If you show me the money, then
I'm gon' show you the beast
If you give me your honey, girl
I promise I'll be sweet
Then, I'm gon sneak out the back
so nobody will notice me
Then we can run it back girl
it's your turn to go on me
We can...

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We can try some role play
you can do what I say
I can do what you say
You can have it your way
We can try some role play
I can do what you say
you can do what I say
I can have it my way

[Trey Songz]
The room is spinnin ridiculous
my body freezing cold
I can't even remember what I did the night before
I don't know where I am, girl
but I gotta go
I can't feel my legs
somebody help
If you come in and rescue me
I don't know what to do
I say I need a remedy
you say the cure is you
Then you tell me relax
and get ready for surgery
Baby fix me fast
you know it's an emergency

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz: repeat 2X]
You got your picture
in your mind
Let me see
now that we're together, girl
Don't be shy, now
it's alright
You'll start to see (show me how)
show me your direction, girl

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Role play, babe... {*2X*}</pre>
