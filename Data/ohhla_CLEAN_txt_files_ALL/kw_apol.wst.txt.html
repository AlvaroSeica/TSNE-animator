[CJ] Whaddya know, it works!
[KW] Hey Jr.; man I'm sorry I laid into you so hard
It was just kinda tough seein you with my baby momma
[CJ] Baby momma?
[Chanel] Yes - Kenny and I have a child together
Meet Candice
[Rallo] Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-WOWWWW!
[CJ] You two are a mommy and daddy?
Kenny, don't tell me my new friend slash hype man is a deadbeat dad
[KW] Nah I ain't no deadbeat dad!
I'm takin Candice to school, I'm puttin her to bed at night
I'm runnin around town tryin to sell bone density machines
Do you know how hard it is to sell a bone density machine in this economy?
[CJ] HOW, HARD, IS IT?!
[KW] It's hard!
[CJ] Oh; I thought you were tryin to set up a joke
The point is, this child needs a family
And this is a good man - and who knows?
Someday he might even make it as the self-described voice of his generation
[KW] Thanks man! Hey, I want you to have something
{*hands Cleveland his shades - he has a lazy eye underneath*}
[CJ] Nahh ha ha; they look good on you {*Rallo goes to Candice*}
[Rallo] What if I told you
that you could draw a turkey, with nothin' but yo' hand?</pre>
