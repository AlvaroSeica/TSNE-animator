[Diddy - singing]
You told me... that you'd always be, my love
You showed me... my love just wasn't, enough
Now I'm on this train
The track's falling off of my brain
It won't be long
Sayyyy that you love me againnnnn
You knowwwww I'm always your friennnnd
So what you want babe, I promise I'll change
I promise I'll change, girl I promise I'll change

You said... you would always be in my arms
Girl that's what you said...
You said that you would always be mine
And now I'm on this train, that's falling off the edge
And I'm afraid, a toll is at the end
And I promise I'll change, swear that I'll change
I know I told that I, would change
That fact that you don't love me, love me
Because I'm still
The same {*4X*}
I'm still the same, the same
When you left me on that train

The fact is girl, I was way over my head
You gave me so much more, I gave you so much less
And now I'm wishing you the best
Cause I swore that I would change, change...
I swore that I would change
When you left me on that train
You told me, that you'd always be, my love
You showed me, my love just wasn't, enough
Sayyyy that you love me againnnnn
You knowwwww I'm always your friennnnd
So what you want babe, I promise I'll change
I promise I'll change, I promise I'll change
Even though I promised you everything I ain't changed

You would always be in my arms
I promised you the same
That you'd always be mine
But now I'm on that train
That's falling off the edge
And I'm afraid
But this time is still the end
And I promised I'll change
I swear that I will change
Oh I promise I'll change
But the fact is that you don't love me, love me
Because I'm still
The same {*4X*}
I'm still the same, the same
When you left me on that train</pre>
