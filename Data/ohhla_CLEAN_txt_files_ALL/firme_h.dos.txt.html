I'm looking for a firme hyna
A hyna that's finer than the average hyna
Not a hyna that's loose
And definently not a hyna that smokes that juice
I don't want no hyna that's been around
And I don't want a hyna that's all tagged down
I need a firme hyna, nice and cute
With a tight mini-skirt and the suede black boots
That's the kind of hyna I'm talking about
The kind you around three see when school gets out
Light brown hair and light brown eyes
A firme hyna, with the creamy thighs
So let me know if you find her
Cuz Frank V's looking for a firme hyna

*scratching*
..moving now, baby all, got me, a fella all..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..moving now, baby all, got me, a fella all..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..

I need a firme hyna to hold my hand
Cuz I'm sick of the scam and jam with the Proper Dos fam
Cuz then I'm off to the next land
Then I'm alone again, damn
She said she's seen me, alrato
But I bet she says that to all the vatos
I'm probably just another one in line
Maybe that hyna's trying to play with my mind
And that ain't cool, no hyna plays me Frank V for a fool
Because I always keep trucha
I know some hynas just wanna use ya for your carrucha
Just to get inside, a tell her homegirls she's alone in Frank V's ride
Spending my feria tambien
But who was that vato (He's just a friend)
Yeah yeah, puro pedo
I got feria now and you're wrapped around my dedo
But I can read you like a libro
So no puedo sacagar lo que es mio
Besides, all you think about is Freetos
Oh yea, stop calling me mijo
Sabes que, forget about calling me y todo
I'd rather just sit here solo
But watch you'll see, I'll find her and you'll be crying
When I find that firme hyna

*scratching*
..moving now, baby all, got me, a fella all..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..I said..
..moving now, baby all, got me, a fella all..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..

Some hynas today ain't about nada
Cuz all it takes is a couple pi√±a coladas
Then they're on the cama doing the la bamba
And some of them don't even care if they're on the cara
So before I get on them I make sure she has a sego myster
Messing up on me when I'm doing mojare
(Have you seen her) chale
But I keep looking and when I find her I'll be blessed
Tattoo her same on my chest, orale pues
But I'm looking on the Eastside, North, South and West
And all I found was toss-ups
Hynas that mess up and like to gossip
But firme hyna if you're hearing this
When you see Frank V, come up and give me a little kiss
And let me know that you're the one
To be the mother of my son
And when you see little Frankies running around
You'll know that my firme hyna was finally found
Simon, but right now I'm still looking for a firme hyna

*scratching*
..moving now, baby all, got me, a fella all..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..moving now, baby all, got me, a fella all..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..ooooooh love, mercy..
..ooooooh love, mercy..
..I'm looking for a love that's solid as a rock..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
..ooooooh love, mercy..
I'm looking for a firme hyna
Light brown hair and light brown eyes
A firme hyna with the creamy thighs
I'm looking for a firme hyna</pre>
