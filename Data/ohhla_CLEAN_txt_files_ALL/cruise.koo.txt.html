[Verse 1]

[Valure]
I met this young man
Just the other day
Set my world on fire
In a special way
He had the prettiest smile
That I ever seen
Had my feeling like a day dream
[Eddie B.]
Hey are you goin my way
Baby can I take you there
[Valure]
It was the first night of spring
And love was everywhere
I didnt think twice
As I jumped into his ride
Street Lights Flashin By
As I whispered in his ear

[Chorus]
[Gabrielle]
We can ride on cruise control
In the drop top
singing to that old school soul'
Baby Close your eyes
And Kiss Me
[Eddie B. &amp; Josh]
Then she made me lose control
She was so hot couldn't keep my eyes on the rode
Then she touched me

[Verse 2]
[Gabrielle]
Smooth ride
Down the rode side
Underneathe the starlite sky
Im beside you
[Eddie B.]
Relax sit back enjoy the ride
Ill put it in auto drive
[Valure]
Are you down to be my boo
[Gabrielle]
Baby. We can take this where you wanna go
[Eddie B.]
Oh Girl
Tell me what you really like
There's no wrong or right
And thats just what we'll do
[Valure]
Let me eeze your body baby
From head to toe
Gently moving closer
Take it nice and slow
I couldnt resist
Such a sweet and tender kiss
Time stood still
It was feeling like paradise

[Chorus]
[Gabrielle]
We can ride on cruise control
In the drop top
singing to that old school soul'
Baby Close your eyes
And Kiss Me
[Eddie B. &amp; Josh]
Then she made me lose control
She was soo hot couldnt keep my eyes on the rode
Then she touched me</pre>
