[Chorus: T.I.]
Ey, What's Haapnin' (What it is yall)
All you haters, Can get at me (Center Hill, {?} What it do)
'Cause I hear ya, and am watchin'(Church Creek, South Grand stand up)
But am serious (It's the king bitch, yeaaa)
Haters, so all I got to say is WHAT UP!? (Here we go)
What's haapnin', (What's haapnin' baby)
All you haters (HEY! I know you had a good time didn't ya)
'Cause I hear ya, and am watchin' 
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up, what's haapnin'
All you haters, Can get at me
'Cause I hear ya, and am watchin'
But am serious
Haters, so all I got to say is WHAT UP!?
 
[Verse 1: T.I.]
What it is bruh, What it do maaan,
Still the man from Japan to the blue flame (that right)
Still hit the door and make it rain with the loose change
I bet that what he get a show, now that's a damn shame (hahahaha)
I get that what he hatin' fo', boy u so damn lame
Ya click the same, a just a buncha walkin' shit stains (click finish)
Disgrace the '80, gave the city such a bad name
You way back in ma rare view mirror, I'm in the fast lane
But still I hear ya loud 'n' clear on ya lil' song
Go on getcha dissin' on while the king gone
Ya self-esteem gone, 'cause I'm back now
let's see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now
Ya kissin' at them, ya jumpin' bad now
I check ya ass den, I shut ya ass down
And I deliver front 'n' center never back down
Who get the last laugh now sucka nigga
 
[Verse2: T.I.]
I got a front street swag and a side street hustle
Center Hill, {?} that's where I be sucka
South Grand church street, first with the work
We can get into commercial if you need some achurtment
Hey, what I care 'bout who you askin' sayin they ain't heard of me 
I'm certified certainly your videos ain't hurtin' me (uh-uh)
I still ride with the windows rolled down
All around the A-town 
Like its fina' go down
If there was ever any questions niggaz fina' kno now
Won't retire ma thorne, nor surrender no crown
I neva bow down
And neva say "bye"
Ms. "to whom it may concer" and whosoever may try
Im forever west-side and the feather-weight guy
Tell 'em take they best {?}
Go'on get ya self high
'Cause I yelled "Bankhead" and you felt left out
I ain mentioned yo' name, is that what all this 'bout?
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3: T.I.]
From summer hill to the hill up him Hollywood (okay)
A house full, gettin' to it, you know how we do it
Yea we smoke great (great) and we drink good (good)
Then we ball hard, just like G'z should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like me but they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want
"I really hate his ass","I don't like him either"
"We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him"
Somehow he must be stopped, somethin' must be done
"If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns"
"And if he really done, 'n' we really won"
"Anymore ideas, (I got somethin') suggestions anyone"
"How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites"
"Vicious lies 'n' nasty rumors we could all write"
But that's alright, let the nerds hate
'Cause in ma face though, the words get ate
Hating's hard work, but I just bounce back
'cause God work tell all the haters am back!
