[Pusha T]
A dope dealer's dream hunit keys each of 'em for thirteen
tax slow rollers sell it to my nigga dirtche
fight fair cases leave the courts in laughter
then flee to miami and live happily ever after
(Dope Man Dope Man)
cook up let it drip dry
I'm sellin that one my hood poppin like a fish fry
you sellin that whip why not gettin a bitch high
twenties goin for nicks whoa I'm killin the strip right?
(Dopeman)
My whole team eatin mean
we the re up gang ever solitare's clean
the trucks come late we hand in handin wit the fiends
fresh out the zip lock yellow and blue make green
(Dopeman)
fo sho' nigga got it for the low nigga
keys like a lock smith open up ya door nigga
no english that my connect speaks
so you know damn well that Pusha "Got it 4 Cheap" illugh

[Chorus - Dout Gotcha]
Dopeman Dopeman
{Yea that's me}

[Malice]
I'm Martha with the whip nigga whisking away
and cook it in that pot liking it ?
bon appetit see they eatin like souffl'e
and put that lighter to it now it's flambay
hey look I'm french wit it pitch it to pinch hitters
they gon make summer time look like ghetto winter
stash box in my who ride we ain't riding spinners
had it like soup lines handin out free dinners
that was as beginners now the game clip
like gold medalist thats how we pedal this shit
and ain't no drout time when you're the reign maker
hit me for that re up nigga come and get ya cake up
push it to that limit til it got off the handle
I touch more keys than Billie Joel's piano
lawyers had connects wit ? Channels
to keep us scottfree it was neva book 'em ?

[Chorus]

[Dout Gotcha]
Gotcha
I keep 'em leanin like a kick stand
I'm in the kitchen wit a whip pan the hood callin me the
(Dopeman)
knots look like tumors when its wrap wit the rubberbands
45 block shoe box got a hunit grand
I'm not gon stop even if the cops come
wop after wop how you think I got the drop huh
money long as Virginia Beach Blvd
all came from moving hard when we move it in 'em cars
gotta smuther it wit a whole tub of lard
shit ? on tugboats wit a ton of raw
where y'all gettin money at we ain't heard of y'all
get a case beat a case pop a case ain't nothing wrong

[Chorus] 2X</pre>
