Song:   Rest My Head Up in the Clouds
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: The Fifth Dimension "Up, Up And Away" sample]
We'll find a cloud to hide us, keep the moon beside us
We'll find a cloud to hide us, keep the moon beside us
We'll find a cloud to hide us, keep the moon beside us
We'll find a cloud to hide us, keep the moon beside us

[Chorus: Makeba Mooncycle (sample)]
I wanna rest my head up in the clouds (up, up and away, up, up and away)
I wanna say your name out very loud (up, up and away, up, up and away)
Please lift me up and take me now (up, up and away, up, up and away)
I wanna rest my head up in the clouds (up, up and away, up, up and away)

[Hook: Makeba Mooncycle (sample)]
Lift me up (up and away)
Life me up (up and away)
Just lift me up (up and away, up, up and away)

[Makeba Mooncycle]
For the love of my kingdom, I often take risks
I exist with the flow of time, equal cyphers of rhymes
Feel the wetness, my eyes have the redness
Always at war with myself, decisions bad for my health
You little birds pon my doorsteps, dropping jewels like bandits
My emotions got them open, third eye start to scoping
The pressure to my heart, steady piercing like a dart
My cup runeth over, wisdom makes me solar
Reality's a blessing, it keeps the weak mind guessing
Here's the answer to your question, relinquish negative sections
Poisonous like venom, my heart's set to get 'em
Knowledging your fears, after all these years
Understanding the lessons of receiving, new blessings
And if I'm not quite clear...

[Chorus]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I'm still falling by the waistline, the bassline, I case mine
You chase mine, in no time, I'm out of mine, tempted by white lines
We only want American dream
Though we were part of a team, and you put us to sleep
With no, knowledge to reach, build this rich nation on starvation
Trying to control our population, jobs won like plantations
They want to end our relation, whose the real and whose faking
They say it's there for the taking, another life forsaken
With uncivilized mating, peace to the father
Who rest, in the heavens, God be the name, thy kingdom come
Thy will be done, on Earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread, so we can get ahead
Why do they blame us for these games, shave their heads in shame
Rap stars are now martyrs, children still without fathers
Sometimes you feel inferior, or because they trynna kill ya
I know the whole will hears I flood the world with tears
I need some rest

[Chorus]
