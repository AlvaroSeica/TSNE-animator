[PMD]
Word 'em up
Check it out
Aiight, niggaz wanna check me
Bring it on

So turn up the sounds and let the amps crank
Who gives a motherfuck what the next men think
Don't blink or watch a mad crew sink
Or your bitch vink
Yeah so stop 'em like the Gobot
Just don't let you know hops
Or tryna traffic through my mind kid
My shit is top notch
Hop the rollers cop the Swatch watch
Get back to the Boondox
For a quick sec the camuflage
Sound crazy, foul and bizzare
I said to say shit, puffin blunts in my Lamborghini
?? ? to let you know
The damage will ruin your career to
Be fuckin around with slow pros

[Chorus] x4
--..so back up or get smacked up--
--act up, ya punk niggaz.....--

[PMD]
It's like back to the ol ill b-boy shit
Plug the microphone in a house party black, and drop ill shit
Cause your style is the free style
Kinda buckwild style, you dropin the buck in the p-nile
I couldn't come slopy poppy
Brotha tryna mop P
To get prop, you get droped G
So back up or get smacked up

[Chorus] x3
--act up, ya punk niggaz.....--
--back up or get smacked up--

--act up, ya punk niggaz.....--

[PMD]
Niggaz that call me still can't see me
Had the flicker the groud to shut 'em down on the rap sceene
Got Swazye gone
Couldn't get this channel at the dick
Close call it the head trick, now I'm packin nine clip
To ease the conflict
S??? slip, thats nonsense
Bust the drum kick squab in 94 another rap hit
So look around nigga its sicker then quick sand
No time to get gun jammed, damn you simply don't slam
Sleapin on the sandman
Walk up in a yolk joke, getting grilled for the funk smoke
Now you ask pro fuckin with slow flow
So back up or get smacked up

[Chorus] x3
--act up, ya punk niggaz.....--
--back up or get smacked up--

--act up, ya punk niggaz.....--    *fade*</pre>
