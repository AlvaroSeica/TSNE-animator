Song:   Blame It On You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She was a friend of me
soon become the enemy
my heart said it was meant to be
cold sweats and nightmares of killin her for breakin me
bound to be 1 from corruption of adultery
prayin at night this day i'll never see through
who knew this gal was out to get me for years
seein dreams of her scams professed before i had fans
delilahs kisses of deception was my justified stance
ignorance self contained in disobedient hands
infatuation claimed was true is definition of this
female relation contradictin my standards for this
witnessed the hand of god began divisions progress
as vintage for all my pain grew deep in my flesh
decisions to suffer bonds that of the startin distress
no less than foolness tribulated to bless
peace once released from the grip of distress
the culprit responsible found to be the likeness of me
the very images i blamed this on self
but not protectin my affections for conductions of hell
her spell had me bound like bank tellers and hostages
smell had me fooled like designer female imposters
why does it happen to the best of gods men?
we fall from desires of fruit thats been forbiddin
since the beginnin of time we been blamin the women
its not their fault that their fine
we need to wait til its given

[Chorus]
blame it on you take the blame from me
if u was in my shoes you'd do the same to me
repercussion of hell from the hand it was dealt
i let you use up all my aces what im facin is needin help
[repeat]

feelin remorse from divorce
lettin nature take its ugly course
catapulting two people in love to insulting
i wish i never met you baby doll from dires join the concubine
jack it like a porcupine alliance in reliance
with self searchin for my key or else in trees
on the wrong side of the woods
and thats no good dancing earnestly with forward respect
swerving up and down super jet aint know the lightning bolts and storms bout to get
when i made them vows heard the screams and saw the cows
paid no mind, ignoring all the warning signs
from top to bottom of my finger monkeying around the dream believer
believin in happiness forever mine was crabbiness unclever unclear
temporarily brain dead my teeth in a poison cornbread of a rehab
we were woven that some day open the water rose above our heads
thats when the flesh came to life and the spirit metamorphed the dead
she killed me softer than a refugee and not sure what was left of me
bamboozled by a shuler when your united as one
the process labeled marriage took less than half a man seein a dad pushed in a baby carriage
pure and out of struggle responsibilities we juggle find it funny
aint no matter to scoff about or chuckle
beneath my stature a superman with no terry hatcher
i stand alone this time givin my lord this heart to capture

[Chorus]</pre>
