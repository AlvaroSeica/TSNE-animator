[Tyler, the Creator]
Ha ha...
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side of Sacramento
But this fag ain't just visiting, he's settling in
He can't wait to start meddling and doing the evil shit we do
(Does he skate?) Yeah he skate too
(Man, this nigga ugly) And he raps, ooh
This the newest Wolf Gang member
And he (what's his name?) Earl

[Outro: Taco] + (Tyler)
Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fuckin' big
This nigga, look at this fuckin' nigga lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae
Yo this nigga's line is bended (that's fucked up)
Yo this nigga, this nigga look like an African poet
(Earl, say somethin)
Yo this nigga's forehead looks like a fuckin big-ass moose
(Nigga, don't be nervous nigga)
(Say somethin; trust me guys, he-he he can rap)
He a bitch (just say somethin)
(Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, nigga say somethin)
Nigga, rap, you fuckin suck probably
(Trust me guys, he can rap)
(Just-just say somethin')</pre>
