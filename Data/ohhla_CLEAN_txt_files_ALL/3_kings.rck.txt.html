[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah! Classic hip hop shit!
Dr. D-R-E!!! Rozay and Jay! Let's get 'em!

[Verse One: Dr. Dre]
We started out moppin floors, and now we front row at the awards
Another one for the last twenty years
If you real motherfucker scream cheers!!!
Motherfucker scream cheers!!! Yeah, and it is what it is
He wanted to shine at the swap meet
'Til them white boys got him on that hot seat
Only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones
Money long number one twenty years strong
Fuck a gym I am him Andre Young
G5's to six fo's, Dre got em!
If the bitch bad I got her in red bottoms
Great weed, nice homes, bread proper
Tech nine, one chamber, top shotta
Bentley Coupe, new yacht, my helicopter
Born broke, real nigga +Straight Outta Compton+
The fuck you magazine niggas want from me?!!
I rewrote the game nigga now talk money!
All black on my Al Capone shit
I built the house nigga get your own shit
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
See y'all niggas, hit the switches on that shit one time
HUH! Let the top down

[Verse Two: Rick Ross]
I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stacks seats at the Heat game (WOO!)
And I'm still strapped with the heat mayne (HUH!)
Can't be steppin on a nigga feet mayne (HA!)
Ev'ry pair of sneakers came from the d game
Cousin was a crip, said it was a c thang
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
Fuck 'em all weigh a mill we gotta double back
The homey whippin chickens in his mama kitchen
On a mission said he did it for his son's tuition (HUH!)
Real niggas dreams come into fruition
Stumblin but I never fall leanin on my pistol (WOO!)
I only love her when that ass fat
We should listen to this track in my maybach (*M-M-M-Maybach Music!)
I'm just tryin to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire
HUH!

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
UH! It's just different, I know it feel different

[Verse Three: Jay-Z]
Uh! I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown
King H-O y'all should know by now
If you don't know UH!
Millions on the wall in all my rooms
Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
Bank see bitches Basciat
I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation funded me
They workin on another deal they talkin TWO HUNDRED FIFTY!!!
I'm holdin out for three
Two seventy five and I just might agree
Ex d boy used to park my beamer
Now look at me I could park in my own arena
I only love her if her weave knew 
I'm still a hood nigga what you want me to do
Been hoppin out the B.M. with your BM
Takin her places you can't go with your per diem
Screamin carpe diem until I'm a dead poet
Robin Williams shit, I deserve a Golden Globe bitch!
I take a Ace in the meanwhile
You ain't gotta keep this Khaled it's just a freestyle
Fuck rap money I made more off crates
Fuck show money I spent that on drapes
Close the curtains fuck boy out my face!
I whip the coke let the lawyer beat the case
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermes store somebody save me
Stuntin to the Max, like, wavy.....OH SHIT!!!!
Oh! Stuntin to the Max I'm so wavy
Used to shop in TJ Maxx back in '83 

[Outro: Jay-Z]
I don't even know if it was open then, I ain't know Oprah then
Had the XL80 bike, loud motor they be like
Damn when I'm comin through rammmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!
Had a grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
You got all that right? UH! 
I love this shit like my own daughter
And spray these niggas baby just like daddy taught ya
Young! It's just different!</pre>
