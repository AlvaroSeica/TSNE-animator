Niggas been talkin bout me for havin my back and never trust em
Then the bitch ass niggas wanna turn me in
Out of retaliation I ride on em, you turned, it's been a
Nation of killers is born, hoe ass niggas be gone

[TNT]
Word came round there's a price on my head
Said these niggas on the city streets want me dead
But that's ok, player hation is a part of the game
I expect this type of shit from some mark ass lame
But for the situation at hand, I handle with ease
Rollin on these hoe ass niggas break em down to they knees
Let these niggas know my status and I ain't no punk
Hit yo ass with some slugs, and knock off some chunks
And leave yo body in a puddle of blood, lights flashin
Gun blastin
I'm unmaskin my face to let you niggas know who did this shit to you
And I don't give a fuck about you, or your crew
Now bring it on motherfuckers 'cause we strong as steel
And you motherfuckin niggas know the fuckin deal
Bitch it's Reel Life product and Gothom too
Bitch it's comin at yo ass son, what you gone do?

[Esham]
Youse a hoe ass nigga, everybody know you
They hate your ways, and the things you do
Youse a hoe ass nigga, that perpatrated

The bitches tryin to put me and my niggas in jail
FUCK them hoe ass niggas!
And you ain't stoppin us, bitch, for real
Gothom baby

[Mastamind]
This goes out to every one of y'all
None of y'all
Niggas can see me
Don't ask me bout no peace treaties, posters, eat your Wheaties
I'll lock on all of y'all
Body count em till they fall
They arms too short to box wit me so thay can't brawl
Couldn't save your life
If you had to roll the dice
Can't survive the hit out on the head so pay the price
Nights are gettin colder
As the days are gettin shorter
Walkin round ready for war 'cause I'm a soldier
Bitch am I supposed to
Get rolled over?
I don't owe the world shit but the last words I told ya
FUCK THE WORLD let my nigga TNT tell it
If that's the way the shit is, then blaze the funkadelic
Legends, sedate me 'fore my mind goes crazy
Lately these niggas been actin shady tryin to play me
For a bitch!
Die me talk a neighborhood sucka
When you die they gone say you was a good motherfucka...
Gotta put these niggas in they place!
Same damn thing... I just WISH... wish... wish...
I'd have all the money... I'd spend it quickly
Man I just wish!
Now I say fuck it! Fuck wishes!
I needs real things, REAL things

(Gothom, Gothom, Gothom, I wish, Gothom, Gothom, Gothom, Gothom)

[Moebadis]
BOOM! You dead motherfucker! You dead!

[Esham]
I got 'em
I got 'em, got 'em, got 'em
I got 'em
I got 'em, got 'em, got 'em
I got 'em, got 'em, got 'em
Fuck a bitch on my dick!
Im all about real estate, and how much cash a nigga can get
Nobody knows I'm insane
I be the U-N-H-O-L-Y, nigga blow out your brains
See I'm Gothom for life
The black devil suicidal mind snatcher
One day I'm gonna catch you
I sold my soul for real
That's why I'm rollin in the dough, nigga never had a record deal
Bruce Wayne Esham, unholy nigga
Three souls trapped inside the homicide
In the lyric I wrote, I never lied I could lie
To the dead souls of all those who died, I tried
I don't want to die with my eyes closed
And when the .45 slug connect, I resurrect
Nigga Jesus
I never trust so bust
And ain't no love in this world only hate and lust and uh...
When I'm rollin wit the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... bitch
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... no fuck that
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... yeah
I got those killas on my team, plus a triple beam
A bloody ass pistol and a half 'scalene
I done seen
More then your eyes can dream
I'm the future
Won't hesitate to shoot ya
Pollute ya mind kidnapped, and rewind
Niggas been bitin my style since the beginning of time
I'm out of my mind, suicidal is my recital
Niggas listen to me when they want to be homicidal
Esham, the black devil, bitch I'm the man
All my niggas in Highland park smoke the gan
I'm a street politician on a mission to kill
Gasoline around your house this ain't no fire drill
Bitch I'll burn yo shit up like a cocktail to a crack house
It ain't nowhere to run from the gun that's
Held in the hand by the man called Satan
And when you want to die nigga I'll be waitin with the...
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... That's right, just, pop
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off
Nigga don't ask me
Two keys in my chassis
Just hit the ditch in the damn Don Massey
I'm up in the back seat so I'm still lookin fo' ya
I told ya motherfuckin mama it was nice to know ya
Mental telepathy tellin me I need therapy
Got voices in my head don't need to take me out my misery
I'm 2 1/2, but I wish it was a key
I wanna be the kingpin epitome
Niggas don't consider me number 1 contender
So I must whip out my glock and make em surrender
Poison your mind with the sickness in my rhyme
Designer of the flatline, walk through time and uh...
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... yo
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... I'm lookin for you
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off... uh
When I'm rollin with the sawed off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off
Imma blow your head off</pre>
