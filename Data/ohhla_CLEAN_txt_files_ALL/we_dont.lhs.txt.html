[Intro]
Yeah, ah-hah, ah-hah
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah, The Returners on the beat

[Lord Lhus]
Now you know for the, ones who wanna get it
Take their wig and split it, man I don't give a fuck
And I ain't callin names, I'm just bustin brains
And when you see that flame know that I don't give a fuck
Dickriders kissin ass, I'm laughin puffin grass
I hit the dutch and pass, fuck it I'ma live it up
Savage Brothers, Snowgoons, Lord Lhus
Cause mad ruckus, fuck it we don't give a fuck
So tell your goons and peeps, watch how you speak
You can get hit in the street, broken and bruised it up
Fo-fozzy guerrillas man, who wanna move with us
Everyone with a ratchet hold it throwin they toolies up
We're with the unruly bastards and grimy hooligans
One shot pop and you numb, like some Peruvian
I ain't nothing to play with like grenades I'm soon to bust
Pull the pin out, dropped this shit, and blew it up

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck
I got no dough, got no new clothes, album not gold
What the fuck?
I got control, I got my soul
It's Lord Lhus and Savage Brothers
Fuck your label, it's unstable
That's why you fuckin went bankrupt
There's no love shown
We Southeast goons
So we don't, really give a fuck

[Lord Lhus]
And that's the truth for ya son, yeah my word is bond
No excuses when we swarm the booth quick, you know it's on
I reach back with the right, swing with the force of trucks
You should've known 'bout us, yeah we don't give a fuck
Never did and no plan to,
It's best you seek protection from the God that you ran to
I ran through, to piss you off with the right luck
Your whole team can suck on my right nut - we really think you suck
That opinion don't change, the brother's hard-headed
You been wack since day one homey, now tell 'em God said it
My camp guerrillas and illest ever since sippy-cups
You roll with chumps - your team is full of punks
That's why you get no respect, we keep it savage
Rep the SC with a redneck and burn the cabbage
No love for the wrong side, yeah word 'em up
I burn the dust cause Lord Lhus don't give a fuck

[Chorus]

[White Collar]
The fire burns and it burns deep
You actin like you wrote the words
The verbs that you heard speakin from the box
That say fuck cops and the police
White Collar sniff the coke leaf with his homies - ha ha ha~!
Sign a deal yeah I might man
Long as money's not shit's fillin their right hands
I gotta shift the track, it's agreed with the white hand
You wrote my image, fucked around and gave em a Sprite can, c'mon man
Nice try to the bad guy
But who's the goon to keep firin like under the spoon?
Musical blue balloons under moons
Beefin like vampires and werewolves
But where was you when I was youngster? We had to share shoes
I got a feelin you don't know
You can try and push me out the game but you won't though
I'm in the end zone, both feet and both toes
Yeah SC we rush the field and tear down the goalposts
We no joke

[Chorus]</pre>
