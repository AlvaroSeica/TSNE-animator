Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Iron Mic]
To all my niggas stuck in the game
Keep yo head up, it's not a thing
We gon' come up, and get this change
We need a change, or we know it's pain
To all my niggas stuck in the game
Keep yo head up, it's not a thing
We gon' come up, and get this change
Don't be afraid, let's bang

[Iron Mic]
Let me tell you what's going on in our community
First I'd like to thank God for the opportunity
To speak, and what I'm trying to do is reach
The little shorty on the corner that walk around with the heat
In sleep, it's more, it's deep, his mind is weak
So I shake him to wake him up, put him on his feet
Listen, there's so many ways to eat, have more than one hustle
Especially if you raising a seed
Whether you got a legal gig, or illegal shit
Make sure it add up, make sure it don't equal no bid
The homies doing major time for minor shit
So many friends dead, so many reminders, kid
I'm trying to tell you what time it is
But don't look at ya watch, look in the skies
It's much more than the block
Man, I'm tired of stashing coke in my sock, nigga
It's money out there, tell me if you want it or not, let's go

[Chorus]

[Iron Mic]
Yo, I was raided in the same hood, most of my life
A basketball in one hand, the other hand was a knife
I had to choose from the jump, do wrong or do right
The streets, made me lose sight, now we shoot for the ice
Pops died when I was a little boy, my momma raised me
She held four of us down, suprised she ain't crazy
She did it all by herself, without really no help
The day she told me daddy died, man, you don't know how that felt
He taught me how to fix my shoes, put on my belt
He told me spread love, but never stop loving yourself
Nigga, I had it rough, I seen niggas stabbed and shot up
Bagged and boxed up, when I was a youngster
Growing up fast, I had to change with the time
Was running blind, til I ran into this life of crime
I never thought I'd be busting hollows, slice and die
Cuz I ain't promissed tomorrow, in this life of mine

[Chorus]

[Iron Mic]
Yo, nowadays who'd thought we be living like this
Maniacs raping, killing little kids and shit
Police killing black kids, ain't no accident for slinging
Packages, look, we ain't ask for this
That's why I keep the toast close by, and pray to the most high
No lie, it's either dough or die
Nigga, you coming or you not, I chose to ride
For all my niggas doing life and all the soldiers that died
We all gotta die, but in case I might throw scene a God
Watch over Jada and Michael Jr.
Tell my family and friends, look for me in the sky
And if you ain't sitting with millions, just know that I tried

[Chorus]

[Outro: Apocalipps]
Yeah, trynna be here for a while, man
Let's get this change man, let's get this paper, man
Stop arguing over stupid shit, man
Stop banging over stupid shit, trynna come up
Iron, you'se a fucking genius, man
I love you baby, 12 Rounds
You know how we do, Ruthless</pre>
