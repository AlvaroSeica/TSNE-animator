[Intro: Layzie]
35 million records sold, times that by five niggaz
365 days of the year nigga
I'ma tell all you bitches y'all need to put some MOTHERFUCKIN
(Can you buy that?) Thug in your life

[Chorus: Layzie] + (Bizzy)
Rock steady baby, we rock steady baby
We gon' do this one for Jesus, we rock steady baby
(Bryon you right right, Krayzie you tight tight)
(Layzie I love you with my life, and Wish and Flesh in flight)
Thug style baby, we rock steady baby
We gon' do this one for Jesus, we rock steady
(Bryon you right right, Krayzie you tight tight)
(Layzie I love you with my life, and Wish and Flesh in flight)

[Bizzy Bone]
Give me the crossbow, hatchet, I catch it, your twenty I match it
Hit 'em like Sac-Town, King's style (brr) Bronski tragic
Magic, I tell 'em my gun spit swords, I split the Ouiji board
What about that oracle, chloroform, puckers I'm sure
Straw hat, bald head, Delilah, I can't call it
Crawlin, walkin in this flesh and yes I'm ballin
Talkin, Ramen Noodle, we in nigga, y'all in?
How many angels? Let's call Jesus, many men fall in
Maulin gangsta gangsta, yes my life's in danger
Never a stranger, Christ, sermon in this motherfuckin manger
Chuck Norris, Texas Ranger, weapon tucked, in my Wranglers
Coochie cuttin in stranger, existence praise you Creator
One time, make us major with Christ, make us some {?} shook
Like Venus razors, better re-operate it, playa playa
Layzie, yeah you know we gon' get arrested all day
We gon' do this one for Jesus, rock steady baby

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
I'm the real soldier boy; I don't dance, I just boogie
I'm thugged out like a motherfucker in the cut where the crooks be
Nigga take a look see, how me and B.B. move the crowd
They say them Bone Brothers is over with, I think they thought they'd take the style
Have a nigga +Wild 'n Out+, but I ain't Nick Cannon
I pull the cannon up outta my sleeve, you gon' die, goddamn it
Access granted; granted to the coldest show in town
Nigga don't panic, on this planet, we the coldest niggaz around
You heard the sound, been puttin it down, nigga you really wanna test this rep?
One step, you gon' need help, this shit get bad for yo' health
I'm like a step bomb baby, armored up in teflon baby
Fuckin with your boy Lil' Layzie, you gon' respect mine baby
It ain't no question just hate me, these streets and music done raised me
I'm livin large, shit is gravy, it's "Fuck you, just pay me"
That's how it was in the '80s, how we got through the '90s
Now I'm a new millenium Thugsta, all about perfect timin (c'mon) nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
