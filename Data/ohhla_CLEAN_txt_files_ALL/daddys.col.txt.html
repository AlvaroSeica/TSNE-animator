[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you're dancin with the Devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple-double
Can see it in your eyes, ya look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl, don't mean them niggaz love ya
She said "don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table? Well if so, then pour it up
Bet you I can drink it straight, without even throwin up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl, you're growin up, growin up" (hey)

[Break - J. Cole]
We take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet ya I can drink it straight, without even throwin up"
She said "daddy what you think?" "Little girl, you're growin up, growin up" (hey)
Listen baby girl, they playin your song ('ong, 'ong', 'ong)

[Chorus - J. Cole]
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the wwwworld
Just look at daddy's little girl

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the wwwworld
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little giiiirl
She daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl 
(girl, girl)

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Can I get a witness? This is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Aye jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
Ya lost and lookin for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape but I can't wait to give ya cardio
Work ya out, ya call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said "don't analyze me nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face, without even throwin up"
She said "daddy what you think?" "Little girl, you're growin up, growin up" (hey)

[Break - J. Cole]
Then blow a couple stacks and she gone
Said "I can take it to the face, without even throwin up"
She said "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl, you're growin up, growin up" (hey)
Listen baby girl, they playin your song ('ong, 'ong', 'ong)
