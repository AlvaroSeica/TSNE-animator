What is this? (Maybach music) 
I like this Maybach music 
 
[Both Girls]  
Sweeeeeeeeeeet! 
Ha-ha-ha! 
 
[Sample] 
Come and take a ride 
Come and take a ride 
 
[Rick Ross] 
Billionaire 
Yayo 
JUSTICE LEAGUE 
 
[Rick Ross] 
57 years, yes! 
Blood for a D-Boy 
Hand my mack 11 to the engineer to record 
Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on 
Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowing weed up 
Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal 
Columbia to Mexico, I figure there was a better rule 
Look at me, a model now 
Models and bottles 'round 
A Blood holla', ballin' 
But the boys in blue, shot 'em down 
Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted 
'Cause the niggas I employed, name synonymous with Mi-Yayo 
Instrumental that are mental, Maybach kind of mental 
400 off the lot, the block is monumental 
Some things money can't buy 
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride 
In the rear, so many instruments I hear 
Tucked behind curtain, no signs to fear (ROSS!) 
I'm higher than a leer / Aaliyah 
This Maybach music, designer shit I wear 
May cause you to lose it 
Close your eyes and inhale the smoke 
It's Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga! 
5 ounces, take a toke 
Of this Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote 
BOSS! 
 
[Jay-Z] 
YOUNG! 
Fuck it then! 
 
[Jay-Z] 
Black Maybach, white seas, black piping 
Remind me of Paul McCartney and Mike fighting 
You know, +The Girl Is Mine+ 
+Life's A Bitch+, so +The Whole World Is Mine+ 
The six-deuce long, the curtains are drawn 
Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rocco's 
I'm a major player, 40-40's in Vegas at the Palazzo 
They said it was not so 
Certain things that money can't buy 
Like being this fly 
'Til then, I'm just gonna' ride! 
I'm like G-Rap with better transportation 
On the road to the riches, reach my +Final Destination+ 
And the lair, closer to a leer / Aaliyah 
Say a +Prayer+, hope I get ta' see her 
When I disappear from here - baby, yeah! 
But I don't see the ending through these millionaire lenses 
Just the Two M's on the emblem 
The partition roof, translucent and Humador 
Where refrigerators, where Ace of Spades Â– two I store! 
True story, my closet is like two stories 
Cut to the happy ending, 'cause I don't do stories 
Shawn Corey, real rap 
The Maybach is bananas, peel back! 
You feel that? 
YOUNG! C'mon! 
 
[Jay-Z] 
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back 
Since way back, since way back 
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back! 
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back 
Since way back, since way back 
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back! 
 
[Rick Ross] 
BOSS! 
Can't be stopped now 
We got too much cake 
 
[Rick Ross] 
They pinching pennies, while I'm muscling for meals 
And the muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill 
Stuffed shells - thanks to crack, I crack 
Crab and lobsters, not all mobsters 
Imposters - got cha! 
Boy, I got an eagle view, slanted on my balcony 
Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me 
I bulletproofed the Maybach 
Got a killer's intuition 
Holding on that mack 11, Makaveli premonition 
Waiting on my Suge Knight 
One nation under God, since I chose a thug's life 
Guess I gotta' play my part 
Never will I die, my name symbolize 
The hustle for young killers coming from the other side 
Some things your money can't buy 
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride 
I'm large, my black car 
Menagin' black broads, massage for frauds 
I'm livin' large, sellin' fat rocks 
In the +Killin' Field+ of hip-hop 
Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped! 
I'm The Boss! </pre>
