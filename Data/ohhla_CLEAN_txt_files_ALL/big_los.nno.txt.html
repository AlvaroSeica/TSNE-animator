[Nino Brown (E-Dubb in background)]
Uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Young Two, what's up ("Mexican with attitude...")
Come on
That's right

[Verse 1: Nino Brown]
It's the incredible, unfadable, you can't see me
Like Ghost
Nino Brown, put it down (Eastside, west coast)
Leavin' comatose confusion, magical like
Illusion, hallucination
Modification gets
Paid to flow
Paper, dough
Caked up some more game to spit (And that)
Gangsta shit
Theoretically uncontested, none can get
With the lyrical maestro, ace in the hole (Ha)
Same suit, same color Stacy boot
Aim to shoot
Slick, sly, ambitious, motherfucker (Hun)
I spit diction
Way out your jurisdiction
On a mission, intuition
Like the ouigi
Superstitious, never cross ladder, grey matter splatter
Hey batter, batter
Thirteen strikes (WOW)
Original gangsta Brown, stripes, straps
Glocks cock back
Hit a lick when we jack
In gats we trust, gats we bust
Hoodrats we cut
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
And get on
I'm all about my feria, get ready, hun
Nino 'bout to kill it
The so-called crown
Bout to steal it
Subliminal, clean cut criminal
Think I'm talkin' 'bout ya
Then dissect the lyrical miracle
Invisible angel city ghost, make a toast to the great
Brown hope
Muh'fucker, what you thank, hun

Chorus:
[Nino]   Big Los, big Los, the city of schemes
         And every thang in big Los ain't always what it seems
         You might get food if you come from out of town
         Nino Brown
[E-Dubb] "Mexican with attitude"
[Nino]   Big Los, big Los, the city of schemes
         And every thang in big Los ain't always what it seems
         You might get food if you come from out of town
         Nino Brown
[E-Dubb] "Mexican with attitude"

[Verse 2: Nino Brown {E-Dubb}]
See me in my brown trench coat
Turtle neck to my throat
With my locs on {"Mexican with attitude"}
I got the whole town nervous
Stick 'em up, poltergeist
Ain't nothin' nice, Nino Brown stay gangsta with it
Cutthroat
Quote it
Translucent
He loosen with it
Get it, don't blink
You miss it
Close your eyes, it's hard to tell
What's up, Nas
Nino camoflague spit lyrical collages
V.I., yep
Relaxin'
Sippin' 'yac
Even got them N.Y. bitches, in them L.A. caps (Uh hun)
Feelin' on my blue Khak's
Matter fact
Sick, even got they mamas on my dick (Ha)
Only fuck 'em thick
Cut quick
And gangsta bitches
Only suck a good dick (REALLY)
Nino Brown, hella cold
Hella bold
Confidant
Angel city go gold twice
You done, dawg, over with
Fini
Secrete heat
Hot flash
Me entiendes
Rewind that
What he say
Go figure
Did I sss...
Studder
Stupid motherfucker
I grip the mic
Rip the mic
Wrap it with the snake and eagle tag
How they like me now
Brown ride til the day that I die
That's the way that I fly
For all my people, motherfucker (What)

Repeat Chorus Twice
