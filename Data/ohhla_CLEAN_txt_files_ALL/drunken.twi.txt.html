Is it a vampire that you see before your eyes?
Before you focus, I dematerialize
And vanish into thin air
So all you scary bitches better beware
For six petals of the Lotus Pod, prepare
For the coming of the creatures in dark with blind faith
The battle is before us, the target is Hell's gate
I'm the first general of the Cobra-God Shadowcasters
The black demon, Madrox, drunken ninja master
The night air makes me awake from my daytime dream
It always seems like there's a killer loose, livin' in me
I try runnin' from the shadows into the moonlight streets
In search of hoping to find a place like me
Offerin' forgotten souls, drippin' blood, give the hatchet respect
The Lotus all up in this bitch, givin' free chin checks
Suffocating from the cellar 'cause we grow with the stars
Even the drunken ninja's knowin' who we are, muthafucka!!

Blood bath, arms open with my wings spread
I'm in this burned down house and I'm surrounded by the dead
Now visualize
I can reach a cloud sky high
And I can make it all turn red before your very eyes
Shadowless in the mirror like oxygen
Fuck us bein' off the hook, bitch-boy, we off the hit
I keep hitt-atin' like monsters when the trees blow by
And I'm demented with this killer inside
Who wanna die?!?!Look at me, I scale walls
And throw Poof balls
I seek and destory the skulls of devils without a cause
Chinese stars, I throw these
For the Dark Lot-eese
I represent the dead
Louise Spicolli's
And Bruiser Brodie's
Look at my face, Jesus, don't ask my religion
Or I'll draw this Hex ninja sword and make my incision
I'm like Shaggy with this beat
I'm weak
I'm sweet
A drunken ninja master, I'll fuck you like, ah, Joe Bruce

(Backwards talking)
Drinkin', smokin', thuggin', maxin'
Lifestyle of a ninja straight out the fuckin' casket
Fuckin' with a dead man, you'll get your head took
Sacrifice for the Lotus Pod, for Blaze a crook
And if any punks wanna step up and test yo' luck
You find yourself layin' in the back of the truck
Muthafucka, I'm a drunken ninja master thug
Fuck 40's of Bud
We drinkin' 40's of blood
(yeah!!)
Grab the bottle, pop the cap
Throw it back
Expired bitch's blood flowin' down my neck
Constantly puttin' shit in my body direct from Hell's bowels
Causin' my hands to do things out my brain's control
Like, let's see, umm....grabbin' and squeezin'
Wakin' up next to lifeless bodies that ain't breathin'
Blame it on the blood, voodoo, or alcohol
And you'll just make this call faster
From a drunken ninja master
You fuckin' bastard!!
