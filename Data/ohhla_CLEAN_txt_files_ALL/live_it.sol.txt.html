[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Motion Picture shit, that real Scorcese shit

[Solomon Childs]
I'm from a place where stars are born, big lights and Times Square
The Champion gear, blowing on a dog bone
Forever spit spone, a classic
Like a Cali special revolver chrome
This dancing with death in the terrordome
Blood dripplin' down ya ass bone
Rough shit, raw flesh, with bullet shells
Desert's let off lightning bells, it's like a world war's a coming
With the beat, heads roam, winter time'll pop you in your asshole
It's cold, but it's colder in them TNT vans
So I advise you black John Wayne's
Bustin' at them beam cans, better hit 'em, pillage
Cuz it's time the stomach of the industry bleed
You don't believe me, you can find me at the drug dealers coming home party
Twisted off the cranberry Cognac knotty
S. Childs, twenty O big ducatti
Head big like a voti, he's the eyes of a criminal papi

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Welcome to the barracks, we in the seasons
With dobermans, bulldogs and bulletproof jackets
Secret indictments, snitches and cowards
Whether you hustle or murder, live it with power

[Solomon Childs]
On the block hard like stray dogs, hustle dirty
But still a casual hard, niggas got nothing on my team
And scrape the edges of the beam, and still bag more than your regime
Spit flames, split frames, gat change
Certified slinger, set up the celebrity maze
No glory, no pain, spectators yellin' "Allah's pain"
New York's newest critically acclaimed, untamed cowboy
Bang bang, come and test me
I'll shoot off your hood, cowboy, ain't nothin' gon stop me, homeyboy
I'm a rebel duke, a menace to society, dude
My style hydro plane, like a CL coupe
On water, Cyanide City, Staten Island, capital, to this manslaughter
I'm in it to burn like West Indian peppers, send them out on stretchers
Striple the sheppard and the sheep will scatter
And you can see it all live on HD plasma

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Time for me to do this, man, take this shit over, man
Tired of hearing these muthafuckas on the radio, with that bullshit
Niggas playing that bullshit
Niggas scared to come to the street and find that real shit
So I'mma force that shit down your throat, bitch
Nigga talk about "Oh, keep it hood, keep it hood
But what the fuck is the hood doing for me?" Nothing
Can't do nothing, I get locked up today or tomorrow
The hood still gon' be there</pre>
