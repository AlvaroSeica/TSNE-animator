Fire Fire Fire Fire Fire Fire (x4)

Verse 1:
Set it off on the left now
Set it off on the right
I ignite
Live on the mic
The one who owns the night
What a sight
I part the crowd like Moses did the sea
In the c-l-u-b
The one you came to see
Rare appearance, one night
Raise your lighters, one light
In the air
In your ear
Is the truth, crystal clear
In the booth, hits appear
Rappers poof, disappear
Pretty soon you'll discover
There's no other
Run for cover if you're scared

(Hook)
Move, light a fuse or you can give me a light
All my rebels in the house tonight
Let's set this world on
Fire (x4)
Raise hell to heaven
All we need is a cause
All my soldiers with the toys make noise
Ready aim and
Fire (x4)

Verse 2:
I'll take your town
Then I'll your crown
Fire starter man down
Firefighters hang Â‘round
Pound for pound the champion sound
Gather round the pied piper
In a hop skip and a jump
Pumps come around
Infectious persona, spreads like a wildfire
Gone viral worldwide
Flyin high in hi-fi
Livewire messiah
Bring your side to my side
Then it's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
I'm the truth

(Hook)
Move, light a fuse or you can give me a light
All my rebels in the house tonight
Let's set this world on
Fire (x4)
Raise hell to heaven
All we need is a cause
All my soldiers with the toys make noise
Ready aim and
Fire (x4)

Verse 3:
So watch my aim
I fire long range
Hope you got my change
When I pay the price of fame
The acclaim I gain when they announce my name
The crowd'll roar
More, is what I got in store
Giving Caesar to Caesar and God to God
I'm the god with a caesar
Give your Visa to charge
Turn a critic to believer in arenas that's large
You can read in the cards
You can see in the stars
I'm the truth

(Hook) x2
Move, light a fuse or you can give me a light
All my rebels in the house tonight
Let's set this world on
Fire (x4)
Raise hell to heaven
All we need is a cause
All my soldiers with the toys make noise
Ready aim and
Fire (x4)
