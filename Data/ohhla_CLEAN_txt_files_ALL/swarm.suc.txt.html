Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Yo yo, it's that gutter shit gutter
Boss Hogg Corleone, it's like that hard
Bu-butter shit, know I'm saying come on

[Chorus - 2x]
Swarm me a nigga, harm me a nigga
Screwed Up Click niggaz, come to bomb on you niggaz
You don't really want that, drama my nigga
Have them white folks, calling your mama my nigga

[Big Pokey]
We reach out touch niggaz, and finish the job
When niggaz trip I unload clips, send em to God
Niggaz get robbed, jump fly flash too much
Thinking that they're untouchable, that's why that ass get touched
Fifth and the clutch, win and I'm whipping it up
K-9 sniffing my truck, looking for work
Niggaz get murked, 4-5 triggers get jerked
Three inches above your waist, to stain your shirt nigga

[Lil' O]
I'm a gorilla, but nigga I don't swing on trees
I swing on three's, swing on boys southpaw make these punks fall to they knees
Rush your house yeah, all of my G's
Have you picking up the phone nigga, calling the D's
And saying, Lil' O's outside my house
Talking bout if I come out, he'll put a gun in my mouth
Shove a bullet down my throat, and watch my tongue come out
Then throw my barkers in the trunk, that's how it's done in the South
This is S-U-Sizzle, get yo pistol
Bullets hit your chest, to wet yo gristle
Don't worry bout them, they won't miss ya
Mafia style, before I hit you I kiss ya nigga

[Chorus - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I swarm and bring harm, so ring the alarm
I'm the new wave Saddam, with a glock in my palm
I wrote the 23rd song, to keep cool and calm
Asa-lama-lakum, salaka-salam
You bumping your gums, paramedics pumping your lungs
The slums is where I'm from nigga, come get some
When H.A.W.K. is spreading, I rain like armageddon
Your t-shirt red and, my trigger finger's pumping the lead in
Nigga try to take, my kindness for weak
I'm from these streets, and legally packing heat
Ain't shit sweet, thrill and agony of defeat
As I handle motherfuckers, like I handle these beats

[Mike D]
I'm a beast my glock, like tic-tac-toe
Jump frog and get fly, watch you hit that flo'
Lot of nerves, you playing with there boy
Somebody better get him, 'fore I hurt that boy
It's Boss Corleone, and I'm the same ol' G
A throwback nigga, that go far back as '83
'84, '85
It's 2004, and I'm still alive
That O.G. code of thinking, I'ma jam on the clutch
I'm ninety days out the pen, tearing they ass up
Screaming S.U.C, nigga fighting go with it
Slam a hole in your fitted, nigga Mike D did it nigga what

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
