[Intro: Elzhi]
Yeah, let's keep it real yo, and count this money
Put the Grants up in the safe cause we spending them Jacksons
Washington's go to wife, that's what it's all about right?

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Everything I write is like a fatality
I'm a pattern-punishing painter with a pen
Got a style kinda like sodomy cause I'm anal with the way I get it in
I maneuver with the mic like Drano moving through a pipe
I'm insane-o, you can lose your life
I'm biblical with this lyrical ability, respect it
I'm here to get rid of these records, get checks and fill up facilities
I ain't sounding like no man
I ain't holding no dynamite, I just got dynamite in both hands
Nigga this is Elmatic, I'm with a chick with her tail tatted
She a Chanel-bagging pill addict
Ill, I'm still at it, for real status
And you gon' be a vegetable 'less you got you a steel cabbage
I woke up early in the morning dressed in black
Yawned and said two of the best is back
Early in the morning dressed in black
Yawned and said two of the best is back

[Chorus 1: Elzhi]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye

[Elzhi]
Yo, I got rhymes three-sixty-five days annual, plus some
Get a rush from how they bust, swear they was leaking puss some
I don't deal with hoes, nor trust scum
and treat money like pussy, if I fuck it off then it must come/cum
I stay fixed on lines that make your minds play tricks
When they mix, even my basics sound like the Matrix
I'm more vivid than Michael Bay flicks, what I say tricks
then it lay clicks to rest like God after day six
They left falling from missing they opportunity
At the door ignoring when death's calling, now they breath's stalling
And who could touch me? Fuck who you read about
And haters, I'm weeding out the same way I do my dutchie
I'm a maniac on track, the way a train react
with smart-bombs for dummies and dumbs-dumbs for braniacs
They only has a few minutes with fame
They caught flame and my pen is to blame
I get it in when you pretend it's a game
The way racquetball and tennis became the game's finish, nine out of ten is exchanged
And I'm tremendous, that goes without saying
What my pen insert, it's sort of introvert, it's not about playing

[Chorus 2: Elzhi]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye, cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

[Stokley Williams]
The time has come for us to stop messing around
cause once you know that I like having you around, in my life
Oh baby
So many times I want to hold you oh so near
I want to say I love you softly in your ear
Oh baby, don't keep running
My heart is yearning for your love (keep running)
You can't keep running in and out of my life (keep running)
You can't keep running in and out of my life (keep running)
You can't keep running in and out of my life (keep running)
You can't keep running in and out of my life (keep on running)
You can't keep running in and out of my life (keep running)
You can't keep running in and out of my life</pre>
