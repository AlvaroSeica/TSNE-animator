[Nas]
Yeah,
Lace that Macy's don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction?
Or my time for collection? Gangstas two-steppin'
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all living trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good, get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the
hood
Dre &amp; Cool, we ridin' heavy
N.Y. to Miami, 'cause... (We make the world go round)

[Nas] (Chris Brown)
Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)

[The Game]
I see the haters on the floor jockin my swag
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags and pouring champagne inside a polo glass
Model bitches rollin grass, Escobar unfolding cash
Toasting with my entourage, went from robbin' armored cars
To all my stars, red carpet to the Larmitage
We throwin' red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We the Best!) Big pimpin', top down chrome spinnin
Top Gun, Tom Cruise, tucked inside my Gucci linen
No [censored], just Romo
You tryin' to shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson that's so-so
Nick want his (baby back!) but thats lo so
Tell the white 5-0 to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my polo
CB let em know though

[Nas] (Chris Brown)
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)

[Chris Brown]
We make the world go round
From my town to your town
We on top, no stoppin' us now
We got patron, the ballers two steppin'
Ladies on the float, and all 'em two steppin'
From L.A. to Harlem, two steppin'
So iced out cause we need to put them haters out

[Nas]
We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a 100 cash shopping
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer pea snaps, Perrier-Jouet, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light
flashing
And I'm laughin', my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum, but .99 cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what!

[Nas] (Chris Brown)
Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell them gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)</pre>
