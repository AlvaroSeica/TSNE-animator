Song:   Magic
Typed by: ST

[Chorus]
Magic (magic)
I'm straight magic (magic)
I'm sicker than I've ever been
Tokes (tokes, tokes)
I command whole armies on the mic

Magic (magic)
I'm straight magic (magic)
I'm sicker than I've ever been
You won't find a sicker rapper than me
I'm sicker than a rapper with a lack of vitamin C

[Verse 1]
I'm the teacher
that's one step ahead of the class
The dealer
that's one step ahead of the grass
God's done so much shit to me
so I'm bunning religiously
skip the pleasantries and give me
them pleasant trees
I send my runners out
serving the herb
so I'm never running out
of what sir would prefer
Even in the fucking rain selling cain
I maintain the pain like a slave
dragging on a chain
That night
I was chilling with zoots laughing
Holding more green
than you can see in Kew gardens
fuck hitting that crack shoot
It's too far and
it ain't something that I really wanna take part in
Hoes be distracting
foes wanna chat shit
ho's wanna snatch him, catch him
all he wanna do is
get back to this rap shit
cos when he gets back to the mic
it's like magic

[Chorus]
Magic (magic)
I'm straight magic (magic)
I'm sicker than I've ever been
Tokes (tokes, tokes)
I command whole armies on the microphone
Magic (magic)
I'm straight magic (magic)
I'm sicker than I've ever been
You won't find a sicker rapper than me
I'm sicker than a rapper with a lack of vitamin C
it's like magic</pre>
