[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah! Word up! It's a honor to be here today, amongst legends, word up!
Real dudes! Let's get it in! Let's GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

[Verse One: KRS-One]
KRS keeps raisin sons and daughters, still blazin one in the corner
Unafraid with amazin lungs I slaughter
Y'all talkin that shit, BOOM BAP BOOM!!!! You a goner
Your DJ's aight but JS-1 is much stronger
Your MCin aight but I can go much longer
When you was here I was here when you not here I'll be here
Masta Ace GET IN HERE!!!!! 

[Verse Two: Masta Ace]
YEAH! Let me explain what you rap faggots is in for
Heavy metal and Ed O, gimme the chin for
I'm not sure but what you holdin the pen for?
Battlin ain't new, since the beginnin it's been war
Y'all rappers know what it is, when it comes to the spittin biz
Since y'all was sittin +Pickin your Boogers+ I was gettin +Biz+
Now it's all these different kids, itchin to bust
Listen to us, listen to them, tell me what the difference is

[Verse Three: Edo G]
Yo! A beast that shows a beast that's tourin
First man in space, like Yuri Gagarin
Surely determined, dirnk my beans without hurlin
Like a German from Berlin pissin on rappers with my drunk urine
Head knock, size spurlin
Dudes start trippin, we take 'em on a whirlwind
Put in work, never show you that we lazy
Don't tell me you pregnant, trick show me the baby, Let's Go!!!!

[Chorus: DJ JS-1 scratching]
"Pass the mic"
