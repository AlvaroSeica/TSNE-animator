[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
I love you......
You know they say, we got to go through love and hell
for shit to turn out right you know?

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Listen! You be forever in my thoughts and no I won't forget it
Forget your love and how reckless I was I so regret it
Walkin around actin like everything is copastetic
Just to find the fouler shit 'til it's so pathetic
Should have respected it more, when I was 'posed to rep it
My ego got in the way, when I wasn't 'posed to let it
I said it, I know I acted stupid!!!
Never admitted guilt my pride wouldn't let me do it
And now the love is killed I lied until I made you prove it
And after all we built I slide like I ain't scared to lose it
I dreamed about your type and prayed for it
You ever felt the love you never felt before and got afraid for it?!
My love was genuine for you I never tried to hurt you!
But the type of dude that I was, I knew I ain't deserved you
I leave a final kiss, don't forget about me
I wanna see you happy, you better off without me

[Chorus: Estelle] (*French Montana)
These tears I cried (Tears I cried) Shall not be the last
It will not be the last, nooooo, ohhhhhhhh
This pain inside (Pain inside) Never seems to pass
It never seems to pass, me by
So I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!) Said I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!)
Yes I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!) (*Judgment shallbe condemned baby!)
For makin me a woman! (Yeahhhhh!!!) (*MONTANA!!!)

[Verse Two: French Montana]
Yo! They got us lookin like Ike and Tina (UH HUH!)
Thinkin 'bout the time knew I could have made it sweeter (UH HUH!)
Before the money came before I went psycho on ya (Yeah!)
Then the money came then I went in Tiger on ya (I did!)
For Rozay bottles champagne glass sippin 
Shorty came and seen me held me through the glass visit
Money changin (Change) Things changin (Change)
My main girl became a stranger...DAMN!!! (DAMN!!!!)
Got me feelin like Marc when J-Lo left
Got me feelin liike Russell when Kimora left
Got me ridin in the Bent black hooded down 
Called Jerry Wonder told him let me put it down

[Bridge: Estelle]
One thing I loved in life, it is.......
Gotta be ready to sacrifice, to survive
I hope she's happy, 'cause your the chapter that I'll be closin
Hope your happy, 'cause once my door closed it won't be open

[Chorus: Estelle]
These tears I cried (Tears I cried) Shall not be the last
It will not be the last, nooooo, ohhhhhhhh
This pain inside (Pain inside) Never seems to pass
It never seems to pass, me by
So I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!) Said I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!)
Yes I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!) 
For makin me a woman! (Yeahhhhh!!!) 
So I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!) Said I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!)
Yes I thank you! (Yeahhhhh!!!) 
For makin me a woman! (Yeahhhhh!!!) </pre>
