[Intro/Chorus]
Stand up; we shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
Stand up; we shall not be moved
Except by a woman dyin from a loss of food
If you've got more to give then you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

[Verse One]
We still don't understand thunder and lightning
Flash back to when we didn't fund the dam
Didn't fund the dam levee? No wonder man
Now our whole damn city's torn asunder man
Under water but we still don't understand
We see hurricane spills overrun the land
Through gaps you couldn't fill with a hundred tons of sand
No we still don't understand
We've seen planes in the windows of buildings, crumbled in
We've seen flames send the chills through London
And we've sent planes to kill them
and some of them were children, but still we crumblin the building
Underfunded but we still don't understand
Under God but we kill like the Son of Sam
But if you feel like I feel like about the son of man
We will overcome, so

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
I said put your hands up and I'll copy you
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

[Verse Two]
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
Except by a woman dyin from a loss of food
Except by a freedom fighter bleedin on a cross for you
We shall not be moved
Except by a system that's rotten through
Neglectin the victims and orderin the cops to shoot
High treason, now we need to prosecute
So stand up; we shall not be moved
And we won't fight a war for fossil fuel
It's times like this that you want to plot a coup
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
So stand up; we shall not be moved
Unless we're takinga route we have not pursued
So if you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

[Breakdown] - last "and I'll copy you"

[Verse Three]
Now shake, shake, a Polaroid dream
Nightmare negatives develop on the screen
We sit back and wait for the government team
Criticize they, but who the {fuck} are we?
The people want peace but the leaders want, war
Our neighbors don't speak peek through the front, door
House representatives preach "stay the course"
Time for a leap of faith, once more
Put your hands up high if you haven't abandoned
Hope that the pen stroke's stronger than the cannon
Balls to the wall, nose to the grindstone
My interrogation techniques leave your mind blown
Place your bets, let's speak to the enemy
Don't let 'em pretend that we seek blood
And who's we anyways kemosabe?
Mighty warlord wanna-be street thug
A threat for a threat leaves the whole world terrified
Blow for blow never settles the score
Word for word it's time we clarify
We the people did not want war

[Chorus] + [Breakdown] - last "and I'll copy you"</pre>
