Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I be like
That like
Fly like
Bat like
Bee like
High like
Sky like
Puff puff pass like
"what's up gaas?" like
Satellite trash like
Bright like
Like flash
I spread like
Fast like
Mad like
Dash like
Tag like
Hash like
Must hide stash like
Bag like
Dad
I rack like
Balls like
Nads
I cue like
Pool like
Splash!

And we pick it up
And we break it down
I can dig it you can dig it
Breakin ground

I can dig it you can dig it like a rock mine

Independent
Empty handed

I rock like
Mine like
Dig like
Like like
Share like
Stock like
Hot like
Err like
Wrong like gunfight
Like unlike
Gotta idea like club night like
I see ya like floodlight
Cheer like
From I key ya like
Cars like
Scratch like
Starrit like
Read write forward like
Lead
Part like
See like
Read like
Bull like
Mark it past like
Tents like
Wall street traitors
Crash like
Them like faulty data
Sleep like
Camp like
Work right there like
Occupy circle in the square
