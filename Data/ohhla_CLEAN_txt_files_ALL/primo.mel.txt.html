[Hodgy Beats]
Uhh
It's a Monday night, I'm comin home like it's Friday
Live everyday high, burnin kush on the highway
On my way to Rico to make it final in the morning
Forgettin to study up, for my final in the morning
Fuck it; it's only a final and plus it's boring
However, Tyler's back hittin spinals when the chords end
Skeleton elephant golden elements bezelin
We spit because we're sick and irrelevant to your relevance
I'm comin down but, not from my high
I should live in a plane, shit I feel that fly
It's a bird in the clouds and the sky's the plain
Nah hoe, squash quote, it's that gal Mary Jane
She wants to retreat from this packed Swisher Sweet
The taste of it is regular, she make the Swisher sweet
From time to time I gotta dish her kief
Cause when she in agreement wanna leave, I let her leaf - burn

[Chorus: repeat 2X getting slower]
I see the world, it's in my hands
I see these girls, two of 'em in my plans
Take a dose of my primo emo kilograms
Take a dose of my primo emo kilograms

[Outro]
Yeah, it's Left Brain
