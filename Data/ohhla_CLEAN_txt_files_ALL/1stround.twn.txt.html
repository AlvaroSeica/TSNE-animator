cause ain't tellin' when it's on. 
Going, Going, Gone you better raise up 
cause ain't no telling when it's on. 
(straight soldier don't make me have to show ya.) 

Straight Soldier don't make me have to show ya. 

Chorus (2X) 

Verse One: 

Now I'm set, ready to peel a cap 
for a bas-relief still got P-funk knockin' 
out bustin' out teeth, with the show that's 
boss now who lost? Told you over and over 
that it would cost. Bringin' a crisis to those who 
wanna act tough, enough is enough got 
your ass on Q when I caught'cha bluff 
ain't no passes or freebee you don't 
wanna see me cause it's worser than 
hell straight from Long Beach. That 
Wayniac an Eastside nigga wit' an attitude 
quicker than quick to bust a cap in a punk fool. 
God damn it's only right from the hitman you 
wouldn't understand the way I think of my game 
plan. Therefore, a nigga like you better slow 
your roll, act like you know before I show. 
The real deal still kickin' the shit with the passion 
dangerous psycho-manic nigga when I'm blastin' 
think not. Come try me and it's on for life. 
Cause I'm causin' shattered dreams as I 
kill your kids and your wife nigga, so back 
off this soldier quick cause I'm still goin' muthafucka' 
the first round draft pick. 

Chorus 

Verse Two: 

God damn! Another murder on the Eastside 
six police cars plus an undercover G ride 
Yellow tape stretched out like the fuckin freeway 
talkin on the phone to this bitch on a three-way 
She done got the scoop on the shit as it went down 
it's a homicide youngsta' wounded plus a dead 
cop. Niggas gon be niggas comin' up it's a must 
G fuckin' wit' that bone and get that ass put to 
sleep see. Because of hard times got us all 
on the jack move be careful who you jack cuz 
this nigga straight servin' fools. Ain't nothin 
poppin' but some coochie and some popcorn 
who will be the next nigga that the Loc is gonna 
have to warn? It's a sad case then life is fucked 
up, set killin' set that's how the shit is summed up 
be careful where you goin' certain places that 
you ride cuz right about now it's gettin' crucial 
on the Eastside 

Chorus 

Verse Three: 

Waitin' for the roll call to begin ya' thought it would 
end but it's not still tearin'em limb from limb, gangsta 
stroll when I T-roll gotta put a hole unless I'm ready 
to unload and take a soul. Flashbacks on my 
younger days still got me fazed but like they say 
nothin' seems to amaze. Cuz you have to be a 
street wise nigga to peep the game, watch the aim 
cuz the bullet don't carry a name. And it might be 
the cops who take pop at a young black nigga 
gettin' his props, no doubt it. Cuz it's been done 
before so here's a quiz if you don't die you go to 
court your word against his. Fucked up but that's 
the justice and the peace the matter's in my hands 
I know how to make it cease. Grab my reasons 
and keep'em quiet, cuz I know damn well that they 
don't wanna see another riot. Uncontrollable when I 
get it goin' you push the button of a nigga that keeps 
it flowin, daily. Can't stop, won't stop, and I won't 
quit, signing off muthafuckas from the first round draft 
pick.
