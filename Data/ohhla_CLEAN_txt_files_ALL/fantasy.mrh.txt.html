[Mariah]     {Ol' Dirty Bastard}
Oh...yeah...yeah...yeah...
{Keepin' it real, son, that's right}
Ho...ooh...yeah...oh...oh...
{The shining star, you're my shining star, girl}

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo New York in the house
Is Brooklyn in the house
Uptown in the house
Shaolin are you in the house
Boogie Down are you in the house
Sacramento in the house
Atlanta Georgia are you in the house
West Coast are you in the house
Japan are you in the house
Everybody are you in the house
Baby baby come on
Baby come on baby come on

[Mariah]
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talkin' sweet and lookin' fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darlin', if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind


1-      But it's such a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
        When I close my eyes you come and take me on and on and on
        It's so deep in my daydreams
        But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy) 

2-      I'm in heaven
        With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
        There's no beginning and there is no end
        Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

Ooh, fantasy (You're so sweet, you're my fantasy)
Sweet fantasy (Sweet, sweet fantasy)

[Mariah]
Images of rapture creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

Sweet fantasy (Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Sweet fantasy (Yeah...yeah...oh, oh, it's just a sweet)

Repeat 2

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Introducing the Old, Dirty, Doggy
Here we go now
Me and Mariah
Go back like babies and pacifiers
Old Dirt Dog's no liar
Keep your fantasy hot like fire
Jump, jump, let me see you do the stump
Girls, let me see you shake your rump
Brothers hit from the back and front
And let's do it do it do it uh-huh
I'm a little bit of Country I'm a little bit of Rock &amp; Roll
And I'm soul to soul
Big letters all big and bold
Old Dirty Bastard bask and blow

Repeat 2

[Mariah]       {Puff Daddy}
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
{I'm gonna do a remix}
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
{I'm gon' do a remix}
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
{I'm gon' have some fun}
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
{I'm gon' have some fun} (You're my fantasy)

Repeat 2 (X2)</pre>
