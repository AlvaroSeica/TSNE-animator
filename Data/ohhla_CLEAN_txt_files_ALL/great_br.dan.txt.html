Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm from a little place called Great Britain
But I dunno if I love or hate Britain
These words upon my page written
Are the things that make and break Britain

See, I'm from a little place called Great Britain
But I dunno if I love or hate Britain
These words upon my page written
Are the things that make and break Britain

One inch, to the left, to the left
Could of been the difference between life and death
Knife wound to the heart to the side of the chest
Could of been one statistic less

See sometimes great Britain ain't that great
Kids getting stabbed at an alarming rate
Press with a passion to exaggerate
Increasingly clueless heads of state

You see, knife crime, knife crime ain't about knifes
It's about young Britain and their ways of lives
You don't solve knife crime by taking knifes to hand
You solve it by instilling new hopes and plans

It's got positives though, I swear its true
North, South, East, West to the midlands too
God damn 'versity, that shines right through
Who's makes the best music in the world? We do

I'm from a little place called Great Britain
But I dunno if I love or hate Britain
These words upon my page written
Are the things that make and break Britain

See, I'm from a little place called Great Britain
But I dunno if I love or hate Britain
These words upon my page written
Are the things that make and break Britain

In a 2008/2009 government report
Violent crime was not listed to increase
Or decrease, it was instead listed as stable

Now what I ask you is, is stable really acceptable?
You see between 2003 and 2008, the number of children admitted into NHS hospitals
With knife wounds saw a rise of one hundred and twenty percent

So in my eyes, 2008/2009's stability, just marks our cards as desensitised
But statistics can be twisted, and our contexts aren't realistic
And while this might seem over simplistic, we need to fight this and resist it

I'm from a little place called Great Britain
But I dunno if I love or hate Britain
These words upon my page written
Are the things that make and break Britain

See, I'm from a little place called Great Britain
But I dunno if I love or hate Britain
These words upon my page written
Are the things that make and break Britain

See, I'm from a little place called (Great Britain)

These words upon my (page written)

See, I'm from a little place called (Great Britain)
