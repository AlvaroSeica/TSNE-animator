[Master P]
Yo, Fiend, you and Snoop Dogg, I'm comin at 'cha, what're ya smokin on?

[Chorus:]
[All] (Fiend)
[Who got that fire?]
[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]
(I wanna know)
[Who got that fire?]
[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]
(I wanna know)
[Who got that fire?]
[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]
(No Limit wanna know)
[I said smoke it]
[Who got that fire?]
[Why don't ya pass me the green so I get higher?]

[Fiend]
Nah, I know, who's that solider, rollin longs nigga
Thicker than Monifah, it's I, capital F-I
The keeper of the reaper
Smokin cheba with my colonel P, Snoop and Mystikal
Pull over, I'm takin pullas
Fucked up, can't ya tell?
Take a smell, let me whiff that
Since God goes, you gone
Tatoos, that can only been choked, seven zones
I'm grown, and well known to be surviving in hell
Hangin round long enough to get through the clouds
It's something by (?)
Got a story to tell
Which is, the life of the baddest
Born from ashes, the smoke of dead, of an addict
Got to have it, cause baby boy, it's a habit
Puff it and fuck some pussy, and see which one I grab quick
I'm that sick, I need weed to proceed
Like a band-aid for a cut, hopin to stop the bleedin
No, not the seeds, I done paid for the pickin
Only the green stickin, for the record

[Chorus:]
[All] (Fiend)
[I'm a smoker]
[Who got that fire?]
[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]
(Fiend wanna know)
[Who got that fire?]
[Why don't ya pass me the green so I get higher?]
(Snoop wanna know)
[Who got that fire?]
[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]
(Fiend wanna know)
[I said, who got that fire?]
[Why don't ya pass me the green so I get higher?]

[Snoop Dogg]
Ever since my first puff, it seems I couldn't get enough
But I just couldn't quit I had to have another hit
I'm smokin green with a fiend by the age of eighteen
I chop a pound to the ground, went cavi on the triple beam
Once upon a time, before I used to bust rhymes
I had to scratch to get a nickel, in order to get a dime
But times done change, now I'm havin mines
And I'm protected by the tank, No Limit, and plenty nines
I grinds to the fullest, so when I'm finished I gots to pull it
I'm lookin for that green shit, boy you bite the bullet
For tryin to sell me bullshit
You know I'm lookin for the bombest weed in your town
Now, I'm a smoker

Now you know what that mean?
Check this out Fiend, everytime a nigga go outta town
Somebody always approach me talkin bout "I got the chronic,
We got the chronic." Muthafucka, chronic ain't brown with
Seeds and stems in the bag nigga. Who got it?

[Chorus:]
[All] (Fiend)
[Who got that fire?]
[Why don't ya pass me the green so I get higher?]
(We wanna know)
[Who got that fire?]
[Why don't ya pass me the green so I get higher?]
(Fiend wanna know)
[I said, who got that fire?]
[Won't you pass me the green so I get higher?]
(Snoop wanna know)
[I said, who got that fire?]
[Why don't pass me the green so I get higher?]

[Master P/Magic]
I'm a smoker (Say what?) I gives a fuck if you know
The front seat of my ride, is like a ashtray, hoe
I blows some good corn playa, this ain't no phase
My mood is purple haze, with Franky, Devi and Maze (
