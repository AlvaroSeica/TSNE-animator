Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ha
Yo it don't start until I get there
Show them how to gangsta shap
Cause where I'm from
That's where all the gangstas at
And when we come
Yo We Get To Act In The air
So we go
Dumb!
If we get to moving to fast
See We Go Stuie-Ewwy
rep From the bay all the way
To Missouri-yury
Back it up on me mama
Look what you do to me-ouwwy
We Do It Wrong Gone
Off Carabou louii-ooey
More then super dooy-ouwwy
Cyea!
One or two beers and your shap is like leaning rock with it
Only you don't lean and snap
You like left side right side hands about chest high
Then you wink at shorty in the corner with the left eye
How you doing
I'm on a little some leaning
Big got nerves got a little trouble breathing (breathing)
Me and my Heathen's about to turn this mother out
Dippin, whip, burn rubber
How gangsta shap?!

Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gang gang
Gangsta shap
Gang gang

Wait a minunite hold up!
Theres to many chiefs not enough soldiers
For the world wars
Standin On The Front Line Tighten My Toga
I'm a Greek god!

Duece Click Street Mob
And I Put This Solely on My Dicky Brown Dickies
Hail To The B Side
Cap Laptivate These Killer City Killins
Nigga You Cant Calculate
Big Clips is Long
Inner City Menaces These Kids Get It On
We Don't Fight No More All We Do Is This
All We Do Is This (bang)
Hitcha Up Right Through Ya Bitch
And That's The Cause For Living In
The Center Where Killers Silly
And Really Wanna Chop At Any Men
Who Feelin They Really Raw
Til Ya Pull The Dark Anennamens
Nobody For You To Call
When Its Through And Solved
Just A Harsh Remembrance
You might've Got Through It All
But Its Too Involved
And Its Very Scary
Its Kinda Pathetic Nobody Is Sympathetic
When Ya Dead And Buried
We Rugged original no puns intended know when to gangsta clap
We Gangstas Mayn We Brang The Trap
Killers Don't Dance We Man G-G-Gang-G-G-G
Gangsta Shap

(chorus)

I remember my school days when
I was a dancer
back when LL and Cool J
was walking with the panther
actually dancing was not
but rap was the answer
but the shally was cool
for the gangsta ta dance to
still here we stand with this dance
that spread like a cancer
cool for the men even the woman
with the baby in pampers
dance is deep and dirty like
the crevice of yo hamper
raisin yo hands up high in this bitch
Cause you amped up
GO
Nike Air Jordan at the bottom, but in the middle was Nautica Pair
lot of erotica there up top I gotta gangsta black
doing the gangsta shap nigga thanks for that
and perrion nigga
you don't wanna see me go speedy
bro need to see me flow
never get the shappin up outta me
he better see the dough
we be so cold with it
boy we need some wool mittens
ladies just roll with it
everything is cool kittens
tilt yo head like you got some screws missing
but have that look on ya face like when you say you bullshittin
gangsta shap</pre>
