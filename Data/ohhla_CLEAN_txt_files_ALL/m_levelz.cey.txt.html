[Askari X]
Just imagine the population of earth being caught up in a battle more worse
than the first world war and the second worldwar combined
picture living in a time when your religion is a crime 
american soldiers they keep sending them to die
the airforce is fighting a battle in the sky
civilians trying to escape buildings burned from being bombed by
war planes military war games
them politicians know the scoop but they mission is to keep the people blinded to the truth
never has there ever being justice on stolen soil
it all comes down to the fact of who refuse to be loyal
to the president and they regime of extreme right wing 
left wing hippocrates politickin for oil in the war

[CHORUS - Askari X &amp; Ras Ceylon]
when the war come we gon fight it on many levels
with green unit guerrillas and black imperial rebels
souljahs with gold medals making red devils tremble
warriors unite and utilize the mental

[RAS CEYLON]
I burn politicians no need to say names
you got faith in the white house is you insane
they trained slaves to behave pushing free trade
more than half the worlds hungry but they dont get no aid
since the days of colonies we aint seen democracy
no justice no peace or equality
ask the people of Haiti 200 years free of slavery
instead of celebrating they get invaded by the U.S. navy
its hella shady you better act like you know
corruptions in control so uh I dont vote
if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal
tell you vote for revolution or power to the people
thats how they will decieve you pacify and mislead you
brainwash teach youth american virtues
got to many wars to choose gay marriages and curfews
I'm stepping out of babylon and leaving my shoes

[Chorus]
when the war come we gon fight it on many levels
with green unit guerrillas and black imperial rebels
souljahs with gold medals making red devils tremble
warriors unite and utilize the mental

[TAJAI]
We broadcasting from a place where you won't visit
they pop at you in the face with the four-fizifth
cats catching dumb cases thinking coke is it
but see I bounce rock skate cuz I know some shit
Aint no man made cage that can hold us in
got impressive ancestry noble descent
and the flavor that I savor for the bowl to sip
more precious than your papers or your gold can get
now you can notice this or keep playing blind
money on your mind suspended in time
or we can end this in time and open up our eyes
focus all our fire on this evil empire
its the locust of my ire its more than simple pride
ain't no joking or facade so emotional inside
when speaking on these things a meeting of three kings
somebodies gonna wanna plant a tree from these seedlings

[Chorus]
when the war come we gon fight it on many levels
with green unit guerrillas and black imperial rebels
souljahs with gold medals making red devils tremble
warriors unite and utilize the mental</pre>
