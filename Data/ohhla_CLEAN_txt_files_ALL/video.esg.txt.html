[Hook: Latenite]
Don't need Serena, Eva, Beyonce or Trina
Rihanna, Halle, Alicia or even Keysha
Without the make up
I swear you still beautiful, when you wake up
Gotta put you in my video, (g'eah time I let the world see
I'm talking HD, or maybe 3D)
In my video, (uh I'm talking 1-0-6
MTV Jams, you need to see this)

[Latenite]
I felt your struggle your pain, because I been broke
This for my mama my daddy, and all my kin folk
My homies know I'm one hundred, until the end bro
So grab your glass, and let's toast
To my video, (this for my fans and my young hogs
All my play cousins, and my in-laws)
In my video, (DJ's and promoters
Rappers and trappers, if I know ya let me put ya in) my video

[E.S.G.]
See we was dead broke, we on now
So call Hype Williams, Dr. Teeth or Boomtown
Calling Tyler Perry, how bout the Stephen King
Now come and feel my queen, Skype me or ustream
Cause she been down with me, since she was 19
Her brother use to give me them thangs, for like sixteen
We had some big dreams, I'm talking aspirations
She stayed by my side, through my incarceration
Cause we was super po', I'm talking Florida Evans
Now my baby ride, a Bentley quarter to seven
That's 6-45, because she stayed the course
Southside Bonnie and Clyde, come on girl let's race the Porsche

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Check my resume, I been a boss
This for my homies, still trying to jump they careers off
Still pushing hard or soft, play action hand off
I stayed up on my grizzly, Zach Randolph
Never cut my man's off, still got the same number
Same team chasing dreams, for thirteen summers
Some on lock some on street, some six feet deep under
Boys out here be Hollywood, niggaz out the hood want something from ya
But I'm real like everyday, nothing but trill blood in my DNA
Corleone chromosomes, protege of UGK
Pimp C, Pat hey Pimp C, Pat
This for my wife and my homies, that done always had my back g'eah

My video, my video
Grab your glass, and let's toast
To my video, yeah-e-yeah
In my video

[E.S.G.]
Ay ay, it's going down mayn
It's going down mayn, it's going down mayn
We po'd up and blowing smoke, over here
Everybody all good, we ain't broke this year
