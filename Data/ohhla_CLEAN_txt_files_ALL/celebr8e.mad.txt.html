[Skillz]
Yup! Yup! Uhh
Now when the cork get popped, ain't no tellin
if we ballin or not, that's what they yellin
I'ma keep 'em guessin cause they nothin but watchers
Show 'em how to move in a room full of impostors
Pass up pimp, if she blink then I got'cha
Pass on the shrimp~! Cause I'ma take the lobster
Proper, I won't tell you what it's worth
But it's not Sunday and I'm lookin like church (WOO)
It's a celebration bitch
We on our celebration shit
Scorsese, crazy
I'ma show you how a celebration can GET
Uhh, so just do it from afar
Ye ain't gotta look up if you wanna see a star
I love y'all cause y'all don't change
All you need's a memory to see how far we came

[Chorus]
Yo, put your glasses up
Don't worry about what's in it
We still in the lead
Cause we never took our minds off winnin
Big nights, big lights
You invited to see the sights with me
So tonight get right
I need y'all to celebrate life with me
Uh-huh, celebrate life with me
C'mon, celebrate life with me
Uh-huh, celebrate life with me
C'mon, celebrate life

[Skillz]
Uhh, well wishers don't blink you might miss it
Tonight's undoubtedly exquisite
Slack's got a bad crease, I'm with a bad piece
On my side, Jewish lawyer with the hairpiece
WOO~! Gotta get my team right
All I see is some green lights
The judge tryin to jail me quick
But look at me now you cain't tell me SHIT!
Uhh, stand up and sit down
My mind make money so I'm livin for the right now
A lot of cats fell to the game
and we all coulda been like dark-skinned Jermaine
So now I smile at my haters
And deep down I know that they appreciate it
It's what you call slow success
I'm takin all bets, no regrets

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uh-huh, celebrate life with me
C'mon, celebrate life with me
Uh-huh, celebrate life with me
C'mon, celebrate life</pre>
