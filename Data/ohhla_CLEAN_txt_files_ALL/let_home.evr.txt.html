[Everlast]
Sitting restless under the moonlight
I know I'm gettin ready to kill
They say we're goin in with the daylight
Now I don't want to, but I will...
Cause I won't know the man that kills me
And I don't know these men I kill
I pray to God for my salvation
And wash away the blood I spill
I try not to think about my family
Cause it's a little too much to take
Now here I got me and I got my buddy
We can't afford even one mistake
I'm sorry about writin on dirty cardboard
It's the only paper that I could find
Tell everyone I got their letters
Tell everyone I'm doin fine
Late at night when I can dream, I
I think about life back in the world
I miss you and Dad, I miss sister Sarah
I miss my wife and baby girl
Pray for me, pray for my soul ma
Pray for me and all my sins
They say I got a job to do now
And I'll be back when it finally ends
Do you think I should be fighting?
Mom are you proud, are you ashamed?
I really am trying to do the right thing
I hope my government can say the same
Cause I won't know the man that kills me
And I don't know these men I kill
And we all wind up on the same side
Cause ain't none of us doin God's will</pre>
