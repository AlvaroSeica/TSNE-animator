[Syd the Kid]
{*sigh*} Hi, welcome to Fuckey Foods
Umm, this lane is open if... if you need...
if you need to check out
Uhh, you're buying a... donuts and a pack of Diet Pepsi?
Sweet, okay, that makes sense

[Tyler, the Creator]
In this fuckin line at Ralph's buyin granola bars
Left my member's card and now this shit gon' have an extra charge
This old bitch in front of me buyin a color printer
TV dinners, tampons, soy milk, paint thinner

[Domo Genesis]
So here I am, at the store for some chips
that I'ma pay for with dimes, nickels and quarters and shit
And I'm still high, so I'm tryin to dip
But I'ma cut through the line to get outta this bitch

[Tyler, the Creator]
What the fuck?! Who this, fuck this gay nigga in fake Gucci
Jordan numbers, whatever, wood chain with a Je-sus
Hey you, what the fuck you think you doin?

[Domo Genesis]
Nigga fuck you!
I'm just eatin Ruffles, gotta lotta stuff fool
So, why don't you fuckin wipe that stupid look on your face?

[Tyler, the Creator]
Don't make me shoot up this place, with light sabers and guns
And shoot caps at knee caps to make it harder to run
And put your ankles in some boards and pissy water for fun

[Domo Genesis]
Nigga, I'm a samurai, cut your skinny ass in half
Look up at the aftermath, blow some fuckin hash and laugh

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm a fuckin ninja and a jedi and I'm from Compton
Better pick a better option 'fore these Nikes get to stompin
Chompin at your oxygen chords, you fat fake Kenan Thompson
Like a virgin, cherry faggot, we could get it poppin

[Domo Genesis]
I bet you lock and drop it faggot bitch, you ain't from Compton
Dumbo ears, you Mary Poppin with the piece that Kel was rockin
I will fuckin beat yo ass, box logos through the glass
I'll hit you hooky like you skippin class, Lee would get the math

[Tyler, the Creator]
Oh really? You're silly givin "Tip Drills" to Nelly
Get them Ruffles, no Lays cause Kiara might kill me
Aw, fuck this~!
I'm grabbin two kitchen knives and stabbin this
Ice Cube look-a-like to show you a Nigga With Attitude

[Domo Genesis]
Wait I heard about you from that other nigga Earl
How you traveled to Milan and now it only likes girls
I'll roundhouse you into a fuckin basket
Push you into an old lady baggin plastic
Hope you get the message, I'll stomp you into potholes
and fill you up with shells but you're used to eatin Taco's

[Tyler, the Creator]
Oh a Taco joke! Domo smoke, I heard
tour album sound like some shit a fake Wiz Khalifa poppa wrote
I'm insulted shit, damn somebody grab the Charmin
Nevermind these messages, Monica her nigga armin

[Domo Genesis]
Swift-made switch blades made a big incision in him
Red dot his forehead, cause Riley's into Hinduism
and hipsters who happen to be your listeners
Doobies roll your booty ho Alexis know the truthy, bro

[Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, a Lexus? I drive that all around
the western hemisphere like all of Kiara's ex's
And bet this, I'm a motherfuckin monster
Fuck talkin, I'll stab you with this fuckin rocket launcher

[Domo Genesis]
When I cock the beam back, I'm aimin for Supreme hats
Go to hell, I mean that, burn you like green backs

[Tyler, the Creator]
You don't mean that, you faggot
I'll get your back and I'll snap it
and strangle you with that fuckin leather jacket
Fall bitch, give me everything, I'm takin all this
And fleein the scene on Rufus, my evil walrus, bitch
Fuck you, I'm out

[Domo Genesis]
I'm high as fuck and I didn't call for all this
I'ma get on my zombie shit, wait, here's my carcass

[Syd the Kid]
Sir, sir, sir - in the green hat sir
You, you, you have to pay for that
You have to... the Arizonas...
You have to pay for those
{*sighs*} Fuck!
