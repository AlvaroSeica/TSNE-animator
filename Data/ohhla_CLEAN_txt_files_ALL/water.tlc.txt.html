A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping
At all 'cause he can't seem to keep
His self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter, listen to me

1-Don't go chasing waterfalls
  Please stick to the rivers
  And the lakes that you're used to
  I know that you're gonna have it your way
  Or nothing at all
  But I think you're moving too fast

Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is baby it's good to me
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
3 letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me?

[Left Eye]
I see a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone 
leavin' a trace of not good-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries endurin' pain that 
it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame it's a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane and name his day in time
For fallin' prey to crime, I say the system
Got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes
Of comin' true, believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
