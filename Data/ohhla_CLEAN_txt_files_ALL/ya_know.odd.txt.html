{*indistinct background convo for 16 seconds*}

[The Internet]
She's all alone, with a bottle of Patron
I see youuuu, and ask you where you're from
But she tells me just to stop right there
cause I'm not gon' get no ass, so I'm on my way
But a few more drinks and she returns
Don't know what she's sayin, her speech is slurred
So I grabbed her waist - and I look you in your eyes

[Chorus]
You know that I'm horny baby {*2X*}
Dance with you {*2X*}
You know that I'm horny baby {*2X*}
Dance with you; just you, only you

[The Internet]
You're safe with me, so don't be scared (just come this way)
The bedroom, let's go upstairs (just come this way)
United we can form as one
I just wanna feel that touch then I'm on my way
But I think I'm starting to like this girl
or maybe I'm just twisted
So I'll ask her to stay
And I look you in your eyes

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
Do you wanna have some fun? {*4X*}</pre>
