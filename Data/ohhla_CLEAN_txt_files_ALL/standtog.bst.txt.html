[Verse One]
I don't see things, quite the same as I used to
As I live my life, I've got just me to be true to
And when I find that I don't know about just what to do
I turn and look within, to see what I should do
Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip
A lot of people makin music that to me ain't shit
So I ask Creation for rhymes for this jam
Gimme likkle solo and I'll take the mic stand

Love vibe {*8X*}

[Verse Two]
Yeah, as the earth spins into a brand new day
I see the light on my horizon not fadin away
Gonna shine from within, like a bright white sun
No need to hide and no place to run
Got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind
So you can move and groove and feel the beat of the time
Sense the power in the air as it starts to move
You get a real good feelin that you just can't lose

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Contemplation time, intuition time
Evolution time, resolution time

[Verse Three]
Free your mind, it's time for good times
And let yourself move it's a time to shine
Spread your wings in the sky, feelin good inside
You break it down, with no need to hide
I got the music cuttin through me take control of my soul
I can't hold back, I've got to let go

[Outro: repeat 3X w/ ad libs]
Stand together, people come together now
It's about time, we got to get together y'all</pre>
