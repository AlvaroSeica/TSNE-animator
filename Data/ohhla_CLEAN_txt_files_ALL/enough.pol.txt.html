[Young Mav]		
Memba days of a teenage love, when we'd bug
In our own zones, had me a wife of my own
Watchin' movies, going out to eat and sip
You made Love &amp; Basketball my favorite flick
They say, when your hearts sincere you get hurt
Trust my words, cause for all it's worth
I won't promise you some jewels that glistening
But if you got a couple views, dude'll listen
Of course I see love as sacred
Ma don't confuse it, dude ain't jaded
For quick cash would you turn against me? 

[KreeSha Turner]
No

[Young Mav]
Tell lies so my seeds resent me? 

[KreeSha Turner]
No

[Young Mav]
Seems weird but I have to ask
If I'm naïve whose fault is that?
Cause I don't need a chick that's behind me
I need a Queen who'll stand beside me

[Chorus  KreeSha Turner  2X]
Nothing last forever
I think I've had enough
Enough

[Bigga Nolte]		
When I first saw you I knew I'd make you my queen
We two individuals, we had the same dream
Mami did it right, University type
Girl I settle down with and start my life
I had it all planned out she get dressed in white
She was a sparkle in the dark, a shining light
When I said those three words I watched her flame ignite
And then things changed so quick it seemed like only one night
Cause my queen turned to the Queen B
She tried to control everything around me 
I didn't know love would turn this girl so crazy
Should I pretend that it's all good and it doesn't phase me
I had to say something, baby girl stop fronting
Now you do me up like buttons
Bit the hand that feeds you get left with nothing
Now I'm back on these streets girl hunting, hunting 

[Chorus  KreeSha Turner  2X]
Nothing last forever
I think I've had enough
Enough

[Bridge  KreeSha Turner  2X]
You don't love me no more
Why now?  Why now?  Why now?
It wasn't like this before
Why now?  Why now?  Why now?

[Dirt Gritie]		
We're living dangerously and we don't even know it
Between you and I girl we had good and bad moments
Omens were there we never paid attention
To the fact we talking less and increased the distance
Arguing and cussin', though it's bad for our health
Remedy by the fact you made me laugh at myself
You hit me up, whenever class was out
So I'd pick you up and take you back to your house
A real thorough chick who knew my friends
I laughed when you asked me am I your Cutta Friend?
But then I stutter then and then you caught on
Now I'm standing at the door saying so long
How'd a good thing go so wrong?
I'm trying to get a grip but I can't hold on
No more laughter, those days are gone
Now you looking at my world through a telescope Ma

[Chorus  KreeSha Turner  2X]
Nothing last forever
I think I've had enough
Enough</pre>
