Song:   Raise Your Hands
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Politic]
Im raise my hand for the people to see
I'mma always love the hood, cuz the hood loves me
Block to block, building to building, city to street
I'mma always love the hood, cuz the hood loves me
I, raise my hand for the people to see
I'mma always love the hood, cuz the hood loves me
I, take it to trial, let 'em set you free
Under oath, I pledge my allegiance to the street

[Politic]
I power, follow the rules and laws of the block
And never talk to the cops, even avoiding the box
And I vow, to hold the spot down, even through long trials
I skip the green mile, wearing a smile
And I promise, to always acknowledge, all those involved with
My quest to be the best in this class of audio phonics
And I guarantee, it'll be me, passenger seat of the V
When you cruising the streets, chasing for green
And I confess, I'll always have a shoulder to rest
Your head on, when things seem wrong in the mess
And I can see, if you ever test my ability
To kill a beat, then you gon' learn a lesson indeed
Cuz ya'll can't stop 'em, he's chart topping
Politic, waves in a season, like when the top spit
Flow with a twist, got a stroll with a limp
Got hoes and I don't pimp, if you ain't know, I'm the shit

[Chorus]

[Politic]
I'm Captain Hood nigga, specialize in giving bitches good figures
Play the cut, rolling up skunk, catching the hood picture
Highly sought after, as a mack and a rapper
The one most cats don't wanna lay they flow after
Not your average, charasmatic rapper on a power trip
Hollerin' how I light up the block with icey cables
It's a hood thing, not big wheels and wood grain
Fresh Timbs, jeans, fitted hats and on a hood lean
Hood treat, braids with a hood sheet
Fresh line, doo-rag, get a hood breeze
I'm a hood prototype, get dough and flow right
I bag hoes, fresh to the toe, that's what I like

[Chorus]

[Politic]
Yo, I done been around the hood, since the hood been around
I vow never to talk, even during a trial
I pledge, I always hold niggas walking the ledge
I swore, I never beef niggas over no whore
And I give my part, yo, I ain't try'nna bag
I'm trynna show love, that most thugs, that smoke and rap
See, I done seen niggas wind up in the coffin for leaking
Corporate secrets, all acts of treason
Losing they grip, loose lips, sink ships, that's why
Walk with a limp, play the cut, and flip
I don't even act like the mack type, I just rap right
Spit flow, get dough, pimp hoes, and that's life
Cuz honey's, they be hawking, but I don't trip
I just, brush 'em off, and hop back in the whip
This for the wave caps, fresh Timbs and Gray's hats
White tee's, rolling up trees, hop in the hay sack

[Chorus]</pre>
