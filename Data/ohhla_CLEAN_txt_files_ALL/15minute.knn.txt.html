Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, I am sending this one out to everyone who has had to wait on a money transfer
Yeah, it's kinda whack when they charge you like ten percent on the dollar
but you know how go it feels when they say...

[Repeat 4X]
You can pick it up today
It's 15 minutes away

The worst thing is the waiting, man
It's spiritually draining
I guess I could repaint
But don't think I'm complaining

I'm in my small apartment
This month has been the hardest
I couldn't afford some omelettes
I'm broken like an empty promise

Sometimes when I'm in a meeting
and everyone else is eating
I feel so awkward asking
So I pretend like I am fasting

My girl had paid my payments
She wants to save my anus
She says my love's contagious
But my pride is so outrageous

She sent me Western Union
So I can make it through'n
It felt so bad when she said write down this 11 digits

I go out to receive it
I'm desperate and I need it
Feels like an angel speaking
I can hardly believe it

[Repeat 4X]
You can pick it up today
It's 15 minutes away

You finally got a caller
You met him in Sao Paula
A tourist with a dollar
He's some kind of a balla
Two babies in a scroller
And still he wants to holla
He likes your Pepsi cola
But you ain't running low-la

Brazilians make it easy
For bellas or fo sheezy
The sun would make him dizzy
Working for something mezlee
These girls will make you trust em
Because sweetness in the custom
But everyday they hustlin'
Every day they hustlin'

John calls her with the number
Home with her local lover
Who was it that picked up the phone?
Oh, that was just my brother

She goes out to receive it
She's desperate and she needs it
It's like an angel speaking
She can hardly believe it

[Repeat 4X]
You can pick it up today
It's 15 minutes away

I got my conformation
The Western Union agent said grandma's destination
Had violent inclination
But now I'm proudly pacing
And walking to the station
Heavy perspiration
But you can't tell me nothing

I got my biz in order
I made it cross the border
Such dazzle, such a horror
His life is like an opera

Grandma I never forget you
Worry, I'll never let you
Soon as I leave the venue
This money I will send you

I still haven't gone astray
Don't drink or smoke and sway
Though sometimes I don't pray
It feels so good to say

Go out and receive it
Cause I just know you need it
Your boy has grow up decent
Grandma, can you believe it?

[Repeat 4X]
You can pick it up today
It's 15 minutes away</pre>
