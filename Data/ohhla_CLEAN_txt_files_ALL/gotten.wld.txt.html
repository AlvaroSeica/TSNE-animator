Shit, right back at y'all again
It's da one they call woodie
still at it ain't nothin changed, like i said ?????
Let's go get'em records
Wild boyz downtown as well
T-Bone on the track y'all know what time it is

Chorus: repeat 2X

You got rope round your neck, duct tape on ya wrist
Pistol whips til ya scared, now here comes my diss

[Da Wild Boyz]
You tried to win a warfare, now try to pill a whellchair
Fuck around and sit there, you'll get drilled and killed there
I gives a fuck bout you bitches ya'll just hot cause I'm cold
Look I've been talking to you bitches, 
but ain't on no street song
Juvenile I know ya, B.G. don't make me come show ya
You like to bling-a-ling, I like to stay with rein
Bitch y'all thank I cain't prove it, set the date and let's do it
Set ya stage on fire, watch a wetboy run through it
See Reggie be bustin head, a gangsta bout bustin head
K.C. be bustin head, Juve be suckin head
B.Geezy B.Geezy, you a real junky fo sheezy
Boy ya lips stay swoll, black, sleezy, and greasy
All that motherfuckin rappin, on gangsta murder weapons
We pimp ya whole fuckin label, but uhh that why I just keep it
I've got nothin but love fo ya Baby
the way you pimpin your artist ?????
Man you sold dope all ya life, 
got popped flipped the script started rappin that right

*Chorus*

How can gangstas make a million, in peace
But y'all rappin in motherfuckin business in da streets
I don't hate ya Baby it ain't that critical
I just flip ya arist cause pitiful
junky is what they are, drivin nothin but jive cars
Real solja behind bar, won't say ya name but they are
You like to rap all day, well bring your beef my way
You like to ?? when you was real, more or less my cable bill
Up and nigga let's bet, I won't even break a sweat
I'ma take your Rolex the first round
Hot Boys want somethin and get wet
Won't say I'm thuggin when I wasn't, 
sayin I got it when I doesn't
Look to me that's not healthy
Claiming your rich when your not wealthy
Get ya mind right Lil' Wayne, B.G. leave that shit alone
Pull ya pants up on your ass, and carry ya young ass home
I'ma say it one more time, bitch you gets no love
"Junkies gets what junkies does"
Boy I catch you slippin I'ma beat ya like a hoe
Have ya friends weepin ??????? metro
Girl that Juvenile ain't know that he was on fire
Exploded in ???? water, knock black magic off his tires
????? come ride through my hood
So I can clean ya dirty world and super soak you good
B.Geezy what'ch say, you cain't wait to see little Aunt Tizzy
It's a must I keep it real, you got that look that's easy
It's a dirty world and you bitches losin
You cain't do nothing about it cause I'ma keep you blusin
You cain't make good songs cause I'ma do you wrong
I'll take ya hit, flip yo shit and make my pockets strong
It's a dirty world and you bitches losin
You cain't do nothing about it cause I'ma keep you blusin
You can't make good songs cause I'ma do you wrong
I'll take your hit flip yo shit and make you move on
Yeah I see ya ass ridin dirty up my block
but if you stop you'll get drop with da glock all tops
I see you rolling in your compressor
I snatch that ass Hot Boyz one lesser
I see you rolling in your compressor
I snatch that ass Hot Boyz one lesser
Yes bra

*Chorus*</pre>
