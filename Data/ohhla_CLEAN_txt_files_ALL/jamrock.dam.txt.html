Out in the streets, they call it murder

[Verse 1]
Welcome to jamrock
Camp where di thugs dem camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van back
It inna yuh hand bag
Yuh knapsack it inna yuh backpack
The smell a give yuh girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh notice
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach wit' a few club sodas
Bedtime stories
And pose like they name Chuck Norris
And don't know da real hardcore cause sandals a now back to
Di thugs dem weh do what they got do
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make them spot you
Unless you carry guns a lot too
A pure tuff tings come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Den dem reel and pop off and dem start clap it
When di pin file dung and it a beat drop it
Police come in a jeep and dem can't stop it
Some see dem a playboy or Playboy rabbit
Funnyman a get drop like a bad habit
So nah bodda pose off if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone

[Chorus]
Welcome to jamrock
Welcome to jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder

[Verse 2]
Welcome to jamtown
Poor people are dead at random
Political violence scare them
Pure ghost and phantom
The youth can get blind by stardom
Now the King of Kings a call
Ol' man to pickney
So wave unnu hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me
To win election dem trick we
And dem don't do nutting at all
Come on let's face it
A ghetto education's basic
And most of the youth dem waste it
And when dem waste it
Dat's when dem take de guns replace it
And dem don't stand a chance at all
And dat's why a nuff likkle youth have up some fat 'matic
With di extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And a flee to night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock glocks seh dem a lock rocket
Den will full you up a current like a short circuit
Dem a run a court block which part the cops block it
And from noon 'til a mornin' no stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds a brought back ratchet

[Chorus: {#2}]
Welcome to jamrock (Southside Northside)
Welcome to jamrock (Eastcoast Westcoast)
Welcome to jamrock (Cornwall, Middlesex n surrey yo)
Welcome to jamrock
Out in the streets they call it murder

Jamaica Jamaica
Jamaica Jamaica, now
Jamaica Jamaica, yo
Jamaica Jamaica
