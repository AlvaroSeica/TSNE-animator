[Itchy Fingas Sha]
Ya'll ready to rock wit big Sha?
Come on, my bitches ya'll got to stay fly
With ya Prada, ya Gucci, ya Dolce Gabana
Wit your hair and your nails done, ma, you the bomb
And my niggas stay laced in Timbs and Polo
And we flip them birds, wit bowls of hydro
And we get that dough, you know like I know
Put something in your clothes, resemble a peephole
And ma, you ain't sucking unless you deep throat
And homey, you ain't busting unless you heat something
Ya'll holding them guns and fronting with Calico's
I see you at the show, y'all never let it go
But it gotta be the click, M.O., M.M.O.
That got ya'll niggas shook from New York to T.O.
And when we get booked just know we need dough
Atleast seven figures to feed the animals

[Chorus 4X: Itchy Fingas Sha]
I hope ya'll ready to rock wit M.M.o.
I hope ya'll ready to rock wit M.O.

[Bam Bam]
Is ya'll ready to hang wit hangman?
Ya'll clowns better stop and drop, it's Bam Bam
Slide through and mop the spot, got them things
Hot off the pot, ya'll know the game plan
You know that I'm ready to rock for T.O.
We get dough on the grind wit yae yo
When them things blow, best duck and lay low
These hoes only coming to truck if they blow
Better drop them clothes before we blaze dro
Buy out the bar, drink Crys' and pop Mo'
Hop out the car, my wrist and watch glow
M.O., M.M.O., nobody move unless we say so
It's me, who they say, when they come for they owe's
Been making cream since I was a day old
The kid spit platinum, how could he stay gold

[Chorus 4X: Bam Bam]

[Trigg-nomm]
Bitches, is ya'll ready to rock wit big Trigg
Is ya'll ready to drop and drink kids
Is my niggas ready to pop off and push wigs
Is ya'll built for federal state bids
Is ya'll ready for cats from BK
To be in T.O. doing album release dates
Is ya'll ready for more, M.M.O.
M.O. Money Makin' Outlaws
Bitches is ya'll ready to pop bottles and swallow back
Wake up tomorrow in the telly wit Toronto cats
Protect Ya Neck, nigga, ya'll don't know how to act
Holla back, where we at is where the party at
Afterparty, pool party, that's where party at
At a party, wit oochie wally, squalie rats
Hourglass, fat ass and a body bag
If you ain't eating, I'm skeeting, you take a doggy bag

[Chorus 4X: Trigg-nomm]</pre>
