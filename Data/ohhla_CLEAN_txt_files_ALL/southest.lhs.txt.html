[Supastition]
I'm a soldier any ground I put my feet upon's a battle place
Have anyone that matters eradicate from your database
I know it's effin low when you pass me, better look that-a-way
The only X and O's that I know, is on a Madden play
I might boast and brag away but I happily back it up
A classic way above average Southern rappin activist
North Carolinian, pennin jams for any and
everyone whose listenin, this is my dominion
Idiots yes I'm brilliant like a God or apostle
Hip hop I'm livin it, breathin it through my nostrils
Many will say I'm militant, feelin myself and hostile
This is the music you bitter critics can suck cock to
The block rocker, the beef starter, the street martyr
The Southeast artist who murder it re-gardless
of any name used I murder these lame dudes
Makin these garbage radio cats sound re-tarded

[Chorus: scratched samples]
"Ah yes, comin from the Southeast..."
"You know how we do"
"Representin" - "Southeast..."
"Six-eight-one, holdin it down"
"Ah yes, comin from the Southeast..."
"You know how we do"
"Representin" - "Southeast..."

[Verse Two]
We in the South where the packs at, where we clap rats
Back and forth trash puttin black trash bag
Fuck the police, and whoever's askin
about the squad, we some Southeastern madmen
Savage Brothers, Lord Lhus, cock the Magnum
Sipping quarter waters, mixed with the madness
The dirty dirty man, some Southern bastards
'til I'm in a casket the flow's massive
Fried chicken, catfish stew
Yo we roll dice, sip Jack, guzzle the brew
Eight-oh-three motherfucker, Metro Zoo
Beef ain't nothin, Kim sued your crew
Mind your business, we lift you out of your shoes
From what the, hammer do you better scramble and move
I'm so Southern, like Cadillac Coupes
Backwards, cornbread, gin and juice

"Ah yes, coming from the Southeast..."
"Southeast..."

[Lord Lhus]
It's the Southern Carolinian out the capital city
With a brand new beginnin still killin it with my city kin
You feelin it it's relevant record it then we selling it
Make big moves like an elephant what I'm reppin I'm yellin it
Yeah Carolina, North and South is where I be
Even Georgia down to Florida on back up to Tennessee
The rugged Southeast, don't other region speak we
I'ma represent my culture by sippin a sweet tea
From Columbia to Charlotte up to Raleigh down to Myrtle Beach
Aiken then Atlanta and these cities where they heard of me
We hold it down fork over now the soldiers found a golden sound
We own this town, my soul is proud, undercomin overground
The South say it with me, the South, the South
And you'd better wipe your feet before comin up in my house
Comin up without a doubt like an uppercut to your mouthpiece
Don't ask me where I'm from, you should know, the Southeast

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]
I'm an ill type cat in the capital place to be
I can deal with the roaches but the rats I hate to see
Fuck Richland County with a passion I hate the D's
The only thing wacker is a faggot a fake emcee
I've been claimin this spot for a minute now
Come and get bruised and on YouTube it'll get around
Mind of a gene-ral, spirit of Sun Tzu
Hit you with +The Iron Fist+ it's lyrical kung-fu
I drop gems out on a limb, you scramblin
If I'm fumblin, I'm lookin for a spot to fit the cannon in
You want beef, I have you hoes leakin fluid
This ain't no weak crunk beat vogue tippin music
And your downfall, you should've known there'd be a bitch in it
Only thing that killed Al Capone was the syphillis
Sold out the pimp for six stones in my pistol grip
Southeast chrome, the shit I'm on is ridiculous

[Chorus]</pre>
