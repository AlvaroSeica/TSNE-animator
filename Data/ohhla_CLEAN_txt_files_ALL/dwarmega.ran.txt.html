[Intro]
Sir Mega Ran of Philadelphia
Give it to 'em like this!

[Random]
Uhh, thanks in part to my nerd-ery
Soon I can say you heard of me and it won't be hyperbole
I'm Darth Maul playin hardball
Over Jar Jar, here for the long haul
Get up in your grill like Paul Wall or the George Foreman
Can't wait 'til I'm world tourin
But the music they make is pure borin
I'd rather watch paint dry than you standin dormant
Performin? What a misnomer
Pardon a bad move, but I'm dietin now and I miss soda
My documents silence ANYONE who's not convinced
I keep a dresser for the backhanded compliments
They preface it "I don't listen to rap, BUT"
And I understand, cause most rap sucks
Got me seein red like beefeaters
You don't like rap songs? Me neither~!
Mom told me I got a gift
Then I heard time waits for no one, I left Taylor Swift
Call me a nerdy biggie from Woodstock
But no free love, rock music, jugs or dirty hippies
Thinkin about pullin an Oprah next time I rock
Hide bills under every chair in the spot (heh)
Dragon Warrior, reapin through the corridors
MegaRan dot com if you want more of the
GOODNESS</pre>
