[ VERSE 1: The Alchemist ]
Dump truck's dumpin, heartbeat accelerated
Blood pumpin, don't assume make an assumption
Get your pumpkin butternut muffin slit open for nothin
Bisquits burn, radio, my disc gets burned
Spead the germ, then return, check the rebirth
My appetite for destruction rap, stomach got a ring worm
Cause I keep eatin, keep shittin, keep spittin
Street pigeon, now I drop
Porched on a lamppost top
Pickin up bundles of botox
Still nothin move but the money
While you move with a style funny
I fathered you, you just a child to me
Dinner plate chow to me, raw steak a piece of cow to me
Make 'em kneel to the god and bow to me
I'll ruin you, don't let the humble atttitude fool you
Crack open your fruit, spill out the prune juice
And drink to success while we calculate your debts
Put old dogs to sleep like a vet
So what the fuck
My dump truck keep dumpin on a punk
No interruption, turn the music up
Burn bushes of kushes and fill the cup
Yeah

[ CHORUS ]
You in the back of the dump truck
Ba-ba-back of the dump track

[ VERSE 2: Prodigy ]
The rapper of all time, they call me King Rhymes
They call me big time because of how my
16's don't never stop, no ma
Shine is forever like them stars in the sky
Yeah the Grand Wizard of Oz, there is none higher
720 degrees, I burn like fire
That's 360 physical, 360 spiritual
For you to kill me is gon' take a miracle
You niggas try and play with me like chess
Oh niggas wan' prey on me? God bless
I'm hearin all this talk from these so-called gangsters
And real gangsters bring it on, I spank ya
With claps to the ass, my gun explode, nigga
Now video-rebuttal that, bitch-ass hoe nigga
Microscopic rappers want publicity
They small like atoms, nobody's listenin
To you

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Oh No ]
I'm a constructed con, a fuckin machine
I up the echelon whenever I etch a song
The kind of shit I'm on - a big dump truck
And you'se a dumb fuck, y'all get dumb stuck
Dude shit out of luck, don't let the pump erupt
See we ridin dirty, fuck tryina buckle up
This is smashin the wall, hop out the car to brawl
Line 'em up like dominos, they fall
Y'all's bustas better recognize this
One man's trash is now some shit that turned priceless
All these gems, it take forever to find this
So we keep fillin 'em landfills with the virus
I haul a trailer full of rock to sell
Get popped if you tell, tell 'em they can rot in hell
I put fire to your trash-ass artists
Then smack 'em retarded, dump 'em back in the garbage
Regardless
