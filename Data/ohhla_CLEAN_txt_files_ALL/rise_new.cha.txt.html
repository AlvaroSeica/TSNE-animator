[Damajah]
Yeahh, he don't know
The man called Damajah (Damajah!)
Longside Chasm, Thundamentals
This how we doin this ya'know
HUH

[Chorus: Damajah {Vocals} (+Thundamentals)]
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT'S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU'RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT'S COS WE'RE LIVER THAN YOU)

[Verse 1: Jewson]
One I met a guy who followed me round, kept calling me Psycho
I said 'you crazy, why the fuck you stalking a cyclone'
Thundamental mind-dome, I vibrate your soundscapes
Micro to macro, while I migrate the ground shakes
Yo I'll break it down mate, how about that
Straight from the outback, shout to K-town cats
Matters(?) maps where I found rap
Now I sport a raw flow, fat like chicken at Oporto's
Get the house packed when I talk bones
Got you singing 'Bravooo!'
Build a bigger picture like I'm spitting out Picaso
Bring in the wack, I'll implement an embargo
If you children relax, we'll sing pissed into the arvooooo

[Verse 2: Tuka]
I'm just that slick partoloco representing for me buddyo
From the Mountains to the city with that coolbocabilardio
Check me aradio, I bust from sun up to sun down
Untilhente my words will never be dumbed down
Run sound, and no body tighter than we
We chuumed out, in the studio lighting the trees
I cypher for free, but pay me when I'm gonna retouch
On any track Chaz gives us man we running amuck
Keep writing that stuff that's out to get you high as my life
Live on the mic, my freestyle's as fly as a kite
We're writing at night to beats that's designed to excite
And get you hyped like a gym junkie riding a bike

[Chorus]
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT'S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU'RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT'S COS WE'RE LIVER THAN YOU)
Open up them eyes up 

[Verse 3: Jewson]
Yo I'm side-stepping these geezers
Hi-tek, mind set - style fresh as a fetus
Mic checking your speakers like venomous creatures
Wild predators with dentures like leopards and cheetah's
Either beleieve us or GET SHRED INTO PIECES
Not to mention any skeptics get lectured on what the weapon of speech is
(nahhhh man)
Yo my methods a secret, never release it til I see fit
We speak deep shit like Killah Preist did
Raw truth - like I'm witness in a courtroom
Chasm on the beats kickin rythm I can talk to 
I live within the cypher, fuck the vile on your tele
Like a Mexican cook - my rhyme is fire through your belly

[Verse 4: Tuka]
Reppin a hood where it's known will get your necklace took
Have you running down the road like a headless chook
Everywhere I go - I'm met with a restless look
But crooks still compliment me on my excellent hooks
Inspect the books for gems, sort of like a gold miner
We rolling on bold tires on rims of lowriders
No sins from ghostwriters, just sims from dope rhymers
Got love from the beginning so here's to old timers (Cheeeers!)
But right now it's the rise of the new school
Voodoo curse if ya think that you're too cool
Got my pool cues cocked, now I'm ready to break
And smash balls in the face of a treacherous snake (suuuuckers!)

[Chorus] 
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT'S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU'RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT'S COS WE'RE LIVER THAN YOU)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT'S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU'RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT'S COS WE'RE LIVER THAN YOU)
Open up them eyes up - And wise up.

[Damajah] {Vocals}
... They say who will come teach em, they say who will come school them
Watch they don't cross-over on them, you tame them
That way I'ma rise up and take them

yeahhh man...</pre>
