[One Republic]
I'm holdin on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin what you say, but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around, and sayyyy

[Chorus: One Republic]
That it's too late to 'pologize, it's too laaaaaate
I said it's too late to 'pologize, it's too laaaaaate

[One Republic]
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat, but that's nothin new
Yeahhhhhh~! Yeah
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turnin blue, and you say
Sorry like an angel Heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid

[Chorus]

[One Republic]
Whoaaaaaa whoa

[Chorus]

[One Republic]
I said it's too late to apologize, a-yeahhhhhhhhh
I said it's too late to apologize, a-yeahhhhhhhhh

I'm holdin on your rope, got me ten feet off... the ground
