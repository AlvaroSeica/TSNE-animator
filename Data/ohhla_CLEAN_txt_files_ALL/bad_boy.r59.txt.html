[Chorus]

[Verse One]
We serve teardrops
Prolific flow from Jamaica
Wake up
We getting that bread like a baker
Take ya
Life like it's nothing
Boys swing
I will blood clot everything from your block to your offspring
You not hardcore
Wouldn't crack an egg
Why the fuck you actin' hard boiled?
Boom bye bye is the tune I abide by
I'm aligned with goons, it's wireless like wi-fi
Why try?
I'm on the cusp of greatness
You bum-ba-cluts fly, I'm on a fuckin' spaceship
Enough in the bracelet to make the blind squint
I'm Eazy, Cube, Yella, Dre, Ren times ten
I'ma

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Put you in a slumber
Come on bruh
You a bum, you under my um-
-Brella, I put you in the dumpster
Whatever, I ain't the Fella who you want Roc with
I will botty boy kill ya
Fuck all that dumb shit
Put you up under concrete
I'm cut like a gauntlet 
Beat ya like a blum blum drum stick
Mumble something I come through dumpin'
AK 47 pumpin', blow like a trumpet
The foolishness of niggas bullshit
Who you trying to push bitch?
Booyakah
Full clip, don dada
You no test me Shabba Rank impostor
You no want drama I'm prepared for 'Nam
I'ma

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
You're in a headlock
Tie your family up like a dread lock
Gong niggas like Junior Marley when the lead drop
Eat 'em like a meal while the fed watch
You married the street I just fucked it out of wedlock
Before I rip on ya
Rasta should warn ya
They don't all love ya
Push needles into the eyeballs of a little doll of ya
Blind ya
Align ya
Red rum with murder for hire
Serve your supplier
Pill poppin' and coke snortin'
We kill for fun 'til we come for your fortune
Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do?
When them killas come for you
I'ma
