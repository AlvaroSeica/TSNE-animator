[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
Now willin and able, cash on the table
Hooked up with the women like ah Clark Gable
Slice at the scratchin, Nate in the back'n
It's dope on the wax, cause that's what's happenin
It wasn't possible with all these obstacles
Couldn't have made it if I didn't meet BAP
Commence to break on, soon to take on
All newcomers who persist to bake on
Those who oppose us really don't know this
Prayin to God that Jay might blow this
Suckers wept'n, commentators kept'n
I'm servin you well, so keep on steppin

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
Rollin the streets'n pumpin the beat'n
In a ( ? ) a dope AM GM
Kool Rock's at service, but don't get nervous
Now it's about that time, so don't disturb this
Check out the checkin, kisses from the necks'n
Not about the plexin, all about the sexin
Stop your guessin, class is in session
It's homework time without your lesson
Chapter 6 and paragraph 8
Lovin the real and hatin the fake
From stage to stage and tape to tape
I'm worldwide known as Kool Rock the great
And to do my duty to tax the booty
Of a cute young cutie whose name is Judy
Or maybe it's Lisa, Laura or Jane
I'm all servin 'em well, so it's all the same

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
Servin 'em well, raisin hell
Livin XL or otherwise swell
Comin at ya but not to attack ya
So listen to the jam I'm droppin on wax'a
It's cold as crush, you oughta hush
Cause first of all, sucker, you talk too much
Plain and simple, I'm dope and def
I keep on rappin until I run out of breath
Motivatin the crowd, turn the bass up loud
Rock a new style cause I'm versatile
I'm here to make it clear that you understand
I seen you rap, but I ain't your fan
Suckers to the side, so break 'fore you broke on
I'm notorious, boy, so I'm hardly spoke on
Hip-Hop's my home, if you couldn't tell
I'm Kool Rock Jay - and I'm servin 'em well

[ VERSE 4: Mac-C ]
I bust rhymes in alphabetical order like A to Z
For the fact no other rapper's great as me
You said you couldn't be caught, you know that I will catch ya
Sittin in your ear, throwin funky rhymes at ya
Left ear, right ear, pumpin 'em strong
You get the feelin, suddenly you're singin along
MC's perpetratin gettin ( ? )
They steal my rhymes, they try to say they're better than me
But that's impossible, cause I'm the one responsible for makin 'em hit
So go on with the bullshit
I keep keepin on, the beat'll be beatin on
For the ones who sleep, slept and sleepin on
The rhymes is def, so catch your breath
You better try to keep up cause if not you get left
Mac-C is the name, I'm ringin bells
Just kick back, relax and tax and keep servin 'em well</pre>
