Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Dog my life is like movie
All in cars and places we are
All my girls look like dem girls off in the movies, movies
Jammed pack with action
I swear my niggaz be packin them chopperz that you be seein in the movies, movies
We do not pretend to be in the streets
It's a documentary
My life like a movie, movie
Dog my life is like a movie, movie...

Volcano vaporizer we higher
Dumb fresh, plus we kickz it like hi-yah
Call some ladies that's finer than Mya
With some ass, don't bein inviting them fuckin flat tire
assholes who wanna role cause ain't nobody flyer
Tv screen, computer screen word of mouth with the flyer
Fire another language, sound just like English
If you niggaz is hot then call me MC extinguish
And my fit be the meanest and my whip be the cleanest
Told these hoes that a rubber is the only between this penis
Yeah I got plenty of it, no you like it, no you love it
She catch amnesia in public
She be like, naw we just friendz
I be gone in the wind
Sour diesel got a nigga dozeing off again
My real life is like paid in full
I'm jus a modern day ace for ya'll

Dog my life is like movie
All in cars and places we are
All my girls look like dem girls off in the movies, movies
Jammed pack with action
I swear my niggaz be packin them chopperz that you be seein in the movies, movies
We do not pretend to be in the streets
It's a documentary
My life like a movie, movie
Dog my life is like a movie, movie...

Check, St Claire state of mind when I'm on this grind
Real recognize real I seen myself a couple times
Baby why me, I'm prolly gon be a asshole
She don't care, she just wanna pose when the flash goes
Jag, Royal Royce, Lambo's, Assin Loadest, focus
And just try to be the dopest
Blue magic pouring out of my pours
Tounge full of fungis spores
The front row subject to my illness and more
Chillin on tours just to get the music further
I'm treadin water
Tryna stay afloat but I don't have a boat
And don't need one
I'm thee one
I'm what you niggaz sleeping on
Cudi was one of the only to hold me down so we dreaming on
Pretty good unfold the poster
I'm doin the can't stop hand to my mouth talkn bout blowing doughja
To the the world
All 7 continents got the shit
Realest niggaz here and we shining all over your counter (pidz)

Dog my life is like movie
All in cars and places we are
All my girls look like dem girls off in the movies, movies
Jammed pack with action
I swear my niggaz be packin them chopperz that you be seein in the movies, movies
We do not pretend to be in the streets
It's a documentary
My life like a movie, movie
Dog my life is like a movie, movie...</pre>
