(*talking*)
Yeah, you know what it is
A Lunie-Tunez production, oh boy
It's your boy Yung Chill, Billy Cook
You know we rolling

[Hook - 2x]
You know we rolling, big face folding
Purple stuff po'ing, when you see us chopping up the block
You know we banging, 84's swanging
Gripping on the grain and, chunking up the deuce and giving niggaz dap

[Billy Cook]
You know I'm gripping grain, you know I'm switching lanes
Candy, leaving stains
Billy looking good, diamonds against the wood
Chopping, through your hood
Cause I be on them back blocks, hand on my stash spot
In case, you wanna act fly hey
Cause playa haters, wanna know who you are
When you coming down, like a superstar

[Hook - 2x]

[Billy Cook]
My cars my flow, my ice so cold
My click so thoed, 24's sitting low
Yung Chill with the track, how you boys love that
BMG 1965, we bust back
Keep it hood and gritty, tatted up I stay city
H-Town be the sound, for the new underground
Ice king of R&amp;B, I hold the title and the crown
It's Billy Cook what it do, all you haters going down

[Hook - 2x]

[Yung Chill]
You know we rolling rolling, you know we folding folding
You know we po'ing po'ing, chopping up the block boy
You know we banging banging, you know we swanging swanging
Gripping on that grain'n grain'n, now bring it back

[Hook - 2x]

[Yung Chill]
You know I'm rolling baby, 84's poking baby
Bentley grill, they done jumping out my hood posing baby
Yellow diamonds iced up, purple drank white cup
Candy blue park, every draped up and dripping slabby
Ha-ha, now what you know about them Texas boys
Coming down in candy toys, smoking weed and talking noise
You can call me, Yung Chill the Great
A Kanye of the Lone Star State, get it straight shake
