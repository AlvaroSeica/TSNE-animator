[Rasaq]
Lay it down, lay it down
You foos lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
The top I lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
The drop I lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Ya brauds I lay 'em down

And I'm back like I got a second win
I got a metal grin, that you can see your reflection in
Except for when, I'm in the light might lose ya sight
If ya standin' next to him
While niggaz in the pen doin' ten
Behind bars, I'm ridin' the rhythm and nigga I'm spittin' them
I go off like that freaky little kim
Cuz I don't just speak when I'm on the beat I show my naked skin
And speakin' of naked skin, black mexicans and even lesbians
Wanna have sex wit him, they be pestorin'
Cuz my chain, make ya neck look dim
They stomach lose air, like I bent the rim
Girl you wanna be down, tell me where and when
I'll tell room service, to send up some hen
But then again, send a friend
Then I send you out, wit a empty purse and no benjamins
Haha, gyea</pre>
