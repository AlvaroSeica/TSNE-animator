{Ready Rock does the intro to Donkey Kong}
 
[Fresh Prince]
Ever since I was younger, I was into video games
Tron or whatever, it didn't matter the name
Thousands of my dollars, have been poured
into all types of games, tryin to get the high score
But now I think I have a favorite
It's me against an ape, he's got my girl, I've got to save her!
Oh no, I feel an attach comin on
Yo Ready Rock C I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong!

{Ready Rock does the entire intro and starts beatboxing after}

[Fresh Prince]
It used to be a problem this addiction I have
I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark raving mad!
Break into the arcade, screamin and hollerin
Anticipatin puttin twenty-five dollars in
any machine, I was out of control!
I didn't need quarters I brought, $10 bank rolls
Bags of quarters, I was insane
People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change
But I would get defensive and yell, "LEAVE ME ALONE!
These are my quarters stupid, GO GET YOUR OWN!"
Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like,
"Yo man.. I wonder what's wrong with that guy?"
I was addicted, a video burn-out
and I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out
the lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say,
"Have a heart pal, one more game please?"
Some nights I might sleep on the subway
or outside of the arcade til it opened up the next day
And when it opened at a quarter to ten
it was the same old thing all over again
I was doin bad, my future was bleek
I'd rather play games than eat or sleep
until one day, this guy came along
He didn't have a radio but he was playin a song
I got curious, so I said, "YO!
What's that noise?"  {What noise?  I don't know!}
"No fool, that noise you was makin there!"
{What this?!  *starts beatboxing*}  "Yeahhhh!
That was def man, where'd you learn to do that?"
{Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that
I had this talent deep down inside
You wanna hear some more man?}  "Yeah!" {Come on let's take a ride}
He made sounds like I never HEARD before
and he still had more!
Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song
and I +LOST MY MIND+ when Ready C played Donkey Kong

{Ready Rock does the intro, Kong shaking the beams,
 the "How High Can You Go?" music, and the actual game sounds}

Yo Ready, get funky with it!

{Ready gets busy on the beatbox}

Yo Jeff man what you doin?  Give Ready a hand

{Jazzy Jeff throws on another beat}

Now my life is wonderful and I feel great
I haven't been in an arcade since seventy-eight
Thanks to Ready C I'm on an upward trail
Because he's always by my side, he never fails me
Whenever I have a video attack
he's right there by my back, keepin me on track
So if I bug out, and act like a lunatic
he does Donkey Kong, and as soon as it
gets to my eardrums, from his vocal chords
I get hyped up!
No matter how bored I am, he always comes through
Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who
Ready Rock C, here's a brief description
of the things that he can do in his musical position
Ready Rock C makes sounds with his mouth
Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talkin about

{Ready Rock beatboxes and then does Pac Man's death sound}

	{GAME OVER!}
	{Yo, Scrammy, why you still standin there?}
	{The game is over.. HAHAHAHAHA, sucker!}</pre>
