[Verse 1]
My music is for everybody
With the it-shit
Talking or just telling stories
But I'm about to unfold
To shit untold
How do you walk away from a person
When their emotions molds?
Like damn
Man the ball is in your court
If you miss the shot
Walk away and be a good sport
And thats my motto
I'm not good at drama
So is with the ????
Shit it's time to wake up
Regardless that life is tough
Or surrounded by cats
You can trust, or peeps
I just don't give a fuck
If you feel me
Throw it up, drink it up
Or my personal favorite
Light it up
Yeah, never settle for less
It's in the progress
It's all the process
Even though it seems like a mess
Just keep it up and
Feel the essence
When I place this
Smooth rhymes
That makes you wanna caress yourself
Its Gavlyn bitch, who else?
Why'd you put your girl next to me
If she can't flip the scale?
Not trying to be a buzz kill
Shit, I'm just being real
I'm not cocky I'm convinced
Check the difference
Feel the wind blowing
As I'm rapping the circumference
Keep the joe burning
And keep the flow gowing
And watch your mind open
Concept
No Teachy-k-teach
No preachy-k-preach
The only way to hear it
Is to hear it from me
G.A.V
Pissing on M.C's
Chicks hate me cuz their men
Be throwing their chonies (?) at me
Yo, mad cast say I have potential
Others say I need to get better on the mental
Still gonna build my style
That's for sure
Still gonna keep these rhymes up top and pure
Cuz when I hit it right my soul blooms
And hold on to the feeling
'Til it fills the room
Ah, and hold on to the feeling
'Til it fills the room
I hold on to the feeling
