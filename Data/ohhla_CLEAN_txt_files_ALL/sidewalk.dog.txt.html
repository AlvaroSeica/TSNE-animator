Show me success is a ten foot wall
Then you give me a five foot ladder
Now how the hell do you expect me
to get up there and get mines, right?
So if I, either I, got to be
become imaginative and innovative
and try to get around you
Or either I gotta, or take a revolutionary stance
and try to tear the whole wall down
the whole system down
Or either I could just uhh
get high and just go to sleep
and say "Okay, it's alright"
So the guys we're talkin about
are guys that just said "Man ay man yeah"
they're not acceptin, uhh this, y'know
Uhh d-denial, of access, to opportunity
So they come up with innovative ways of doin it!
And in the process they become
what I call, Sidewalk Executives</pre>
