{DJ scratches up "Ooh, it's time"}

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah - Well the bell has rung because the time is here
Oh, yeah - We gotta switch it around and put the thang in gear
Oh, yeah - Not much is for sure, but this here is true
Oh, yeah - I gotta do it for me, but then I'll do it for you

Major attraction, trouble distraction
Scramble up my name and it still come action
Music's our number, dial to sue slumber
Open up your ears to the low tint of thunder
Creative Queens native, mixes are the Native
Want some fresh shit? Then we're correlative
Busta is ferocious, unflawed and precocious
Airin fools out 'cause my willy bodacious
Peoples don't blame me, shorties can't game me
Country Cherokee but the city here made me
Rock like coral, distinctive 'bout my orals
Got lil' grime and got lotta laurels
The rhythm stay bangin, my one-two thangin
is exemplified by the comp left hangin
Percussion's our weapons, drums are Smith &amp; Wesson's
Lyrics poppin off leaving deep impressions

{DJ scratches up "Ooh, it's time"}

[Chorus]

Yo, I feel what the beat does, people fuck wit me 'cause
when the song end, I become what the beat was
Same thing as other, no need for cookie cutter
The bar gets raised, not your average old gutter
For that I hit a chin up, B, ya time been up
Would've came sooner but I overslept my get-up
Now let's get in the middle, girl I'll solve your riddle
'Cause we can be strong and protect against the brittle
If groupies need to see me, go and get the CD
I aerosol you all top to bottom like graffiti
Biz {?} lot and, dudes say I'm pardon
When you hear the music, thus begins the Mardi Gras and
Rhymes ain't the issue, that's how I'm gon' get you
Don't need a Billboard hit for me to +hit+ you
The clairvoyant micist, who ALWAYS come the tightest
Queens everywhere demostratin who the flyest

[Chorus 2]
Oh, yeah - Well the bell has rung because the time is here
Mmm, mmm - We gotta change it around and put our thang in gear
Oh, yeah - Not much is for sure, but this thang is true
Mmm, mmm - Gotta do it for me and then I'll do it for you

Oh - Ohhh, gotta do it for me and then I'll do it for you
Oh - Yeah, gotta do it for me and then I'll do it for you
Oh...</pre>
