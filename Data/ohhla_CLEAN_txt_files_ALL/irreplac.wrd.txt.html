What I fool I am
Everything free our minds
I can't believe I've been replaced

[Werd]
Nah syke, aint replacing us
We done ripped that repped that Edinburgh
See this is what happens when the best occurs
And new cunts come up trying to test the buzz
See new emcees, what are you doing with it?
Honestly, I think youre away with it
Dont understand what you claim when youre saying it
Your tunes aint a game, Im aint playing it (Nah)
Who the fuck, going to test their luck 
Against crews this tough?
Get put on the deck like a cruise or the DJ cuts
Shut up, you aint built like us
You aint built up a scene through years of gigs
Years of this, without no peers I give
An insight into life of a fearless kid
Who believes well achieve when they hearing this
(Ha) I dont think they know
(No) They watched us grow
(Grow) They thought we were done
(Ha) We just begun

[Riddlah]
Listen (listen)
Im Irreplaceable when your the Riddlah anything is takeable
Im breaking you in two and proving everything that we've been doing
Pushing music, you just stand there looking stupid
Too busy thinking who's the coolest, nah
You cant use excuses, nah
Because you cant replace us, were in the foundations with aspirations
Go ask your parents, no one supports you, no one's caring
So face reality, there doesnt have to be a casualty
Im not leaving and nobodies going to tax my place
So Im back in the place, Im a rapper with magical taste
Feel quiet good when Im rapping away
And I dont really care what you happen to say

[Madhat McGore]
Cunt, Madhat McGore (know what I mean Madhat)
S.O.S. (S.O.S) Stonez the Riddlah (Stonez the Riddlah)

So Im what you want to be, dont talk to me
When you get on a mic its a mockery
You want honestly, I walk away
Get on a stage and I rock it mate (haha)
Irreplaceable, making my money, dont wait on no lottery
Writing it quality, giving you quantity, 
Do what I do and Im keeping the oddity
Probably talking allot of monotony
Walk and I wobble and possibly haunting you
On top, rocking it, wanting it quality
Pop in a thought, I jot to the lot of you
Big up Werd, repping it constantly (Auld Reekie)
Were doing it properly, repping it hard and were doing it consciously
Ignoring the shite and the comedy, blazing the broccoli
Get into botany, sit with the prodigy telling a prophesy
Slaver it sloppily, talk of an odyssey, keeping it Wu-tang,
Rocking the Wallabies (cunt)
