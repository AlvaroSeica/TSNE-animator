[Intro: sample of "All Good Things (Come to an End)" by Nelly Furtado]
"Flames to dust, lovers to friends"
"Why do all good things come to an end?"
"Flames to dust, lovers to friends"
"Why do all good things come to an end?"

So there are no misconceptions let's clear it up
I'ma spit it from my heart, I'm tired of tearin up
Why won't you just admit, I was ready to commit
You was on your material shit like my ring wasn't good enough (yeah)
I put myself at a disadvantage, emotional manners
Could barely manage to wake in the morning, was so sad
Drownin myself in alcohol, and blamin it all on myself
And my financial status wasn't even that low (nah)
You promised you would love me even if I went broke
You promised to love my previous children, what a joke (yeah right)
We knew the end result when you're mom called me a nigger, I never considered 
the woman that I'd take a bullet for would be the same one behind the trigger
With like a great conversation stopped in mid-sentence
She said she'd changed her mind, her new one hasn't made a difference
To light your cigarettes I would've set myself on fire
Lovin you more than I did myself but felt I was on trial
You did what was best for my child no problem so I moved in
You'll always be found guilty in the court of a one side chick (for real)
Was wanted in relationships where nobody smiles
But it was cheaper to keep her like a lease when you over the miles
Someday you'll wake up knowin that you lost a precious diamond
while you were out collectin regular stones, so triflin
Go 'head and live in Gomorrah, you ain't takin my daughter
Wanna walk out of my life? I'll hold the door open for ya (yeah)
Sleep in scarlet

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado sample] + (Chino XL)
"Flames to dust, lovers to friends"
"Why do all good things come to an end?" (I hope you sleep in scarlet)
"Flames to dust, lovers to friends"
"Why do all good things come to an end?"

Now as I look up at the night sky
I'm gettin really tired of playin Mr. Nice Guy
When you refused to love me back, bitch you must be high
But you're so fine and that's just makin my anger intensify
And plus you thankin God, I raise my hand and testify
Then put it on my father's grave that I really tried
I went against my own life advise, you're my demise, both of us can not survive 
unless you get out of my life, I swear I've had my last cry
My name is Derek and I loved you the best way I can
My braids and famous name pierced right through your skin
Blood's my liquid love letter
And your desire to be desired pushed you in the arms of who you thought was better (wrong!)
She said, "I swear I didn't sleep with him"
Of course you didn't, cause you was wide awake while you was cheatin with him (yeah!)
Fuck marriage, your excuses, and fuck your answers
And fuck wedding rings, they're the world's smallest handcuffs (never!)
Threats of castration for every missed call
when me bustin a nut on your face was better than a Hallmark card (remember!)
Don't fear eight men with guns
Fear one woman with a grudge, when you no longer want the buns
My heart was a broken tansmission while my world shifted
Feelin like killin a whore ass like Robert Willie Pickton
Blessed art thou amongst women though
But stop claiming you're my soulmate when you ain't even got a soul
Sleep in scarlet

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
I keep attractin the wrong ones like a sickness
Only time that I say "I do" is in front of "not trust bitches"
In secret I wonder if we could've weathered the storm
'Til death do us part like Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun (perfect)
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have regrets
Let's get our marriage license, have 'em write it on an Etch A Sketch
I think if I went to her doorstep and she seen me hurt and 
I could turn it all around and she would take me back for certain
Maybe it's my past relationships that's dangerous
Or, maybe I was usin you to fill all my emptiness
And if Picasso was alive he would've painted you
But you're insane and loose, forsaken love for a tight-paid Maloof{?} (biatch!)
The world is tainted and fucked
We're livin in a world where love's no longer appreciated, it is hated and mocked
I'm like an animal that's been kicked out of a zoo
But it's true, you are what you love and not what loves you
But now I'm riding right, cause our relationship life
was like a bit of lemon keeping me up out of the limelight
Put it to memory how women change to vipers
And phone numbers and condoms are a lot easier to change than diapers
It's kind of bizarre and, your momma should've named you Carmen
Cause the only thing that you talk about are cars and men (crazy!)
You'll probably get caught up and abducted with chloroform
You can call me whatever you want, but call me gone~! (yeah!)
Sleep in scarlet

[Chorus]

[Chino XL] Your throat'll drip rubies!

{*whispered until fade*}
I won't let anyone come between us anymore
