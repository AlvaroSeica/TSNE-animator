All rise Jesus the Christ still rules
King of kings, Mr. Runnin' things still cool
Calm, collective, objective truth slinger, the sword bringer
In fact I'm wrapped like a ring on His finger
While cops bust glocks and call cars from afar
God called the A-M-B-A, double-S, A-D-O-R
To grab mics and drop a bomb on ya
Well, Selah's the way I can drop some calm on ya buss it
Pause think about the infinite, omnipotent, magnificent
Mad significant God with an Immutable, immovable, unchangeable
Nature non-rearrangable, unattainable
Yet slain-able when He tabernacled
Among the sinful, unrepentful humans that were shackled
I'm baffledwhat made the infinite become like finite
What made Him leave His throne home for a zone of twilight
And why might the rich switch becoming poor in history
Leaving the angelic holy x 3 antiphony
Becoming a kamikaze, check the way my God shocked the
Planet earth with the birth of His agape
Don't stop me now, I'm gettin' down, check His beatings
Didn't get mad but the Savior kept grieving
He created earth for His own reason
Yet we make theocracy a mockery when we leave Him
Double Selah all the bleedin'
Torn, whipped, thorn tips, flesh rips for the heathen
A purple rope, they slapped on Him
Psalm 22, the Father turn a holy back on Him

[Chorus]
Selah, pause, think about that
Selah, pause calmly think about that
Selah, pause calmly think about that
Selah, pause calmly think about that

Long live the Heart and Mind Dissector, the Ressurector
Ruling with an iron scepter forever
And forever stops never so it's clever
To be down with the One who wears the crown
Perfecter of the faith, wait, is He great? Let me demonstrate, I'm able
To use my hands to hold the food He put on my table
On my way with a check to deposit
Outta here with the fly gear from the closet
And I get my needs met I know Jehovah Jireh
I'm fed daily bread like the ravens fed Elijah
Now mind ya, no need to rob I got a job to earn from
Street wise, girls, guys, men and woman to learn from
God's high power like a third rail, never fail
But prevails kickin' up the manna and the quail
Drug free, Spirit filled, broken willed and all that
I call that God's grace, uh, ain't it all that
All for the sins of men from begin to end
The cup of wrath was filled up to the rim with grim
Love from above all true whatcha gonna do
When you stand before the God-man who died for you

[Chorus]

Selah, I love the way the Savior runs the ranch
He's the True Vine and I'm the William Branch
Still in the mood for soul food still chewin'
God's hand is on the Cross Movement we're doin'
The work of evangelical / fundamentalist
People, we get into this Jesus Christ the magnificent
And the incident at Golgothaat Calvary
Christ paid the wages and sin got its salary
Yeshua blessed you the called, chosen, predestined
The foreknown, all up in the war zone with weapons
Of prayer, faith, biblical shots, praise, love and hope
Because it's dope swinging with Messiah like a rope
No joke the holy smoke's blazing
Check it y'all I'm breathing so tis the season to be praising
The Godheadinfinite flavor
Let everything that hath breath become a praiser of the Savior
He that hath an ear let him hear what I speak
But talk is cheap so peep what I repaint over beats
And you'll meet the Doer that does
The I Am that is, that said, "Let there be..." and there was

[Chorus]

Selah, pause, think about that
Think about the man with a cross on His back
Check my rap at the cross that's where it's at
Selah, pause, calmy think about that
Think about the infinite, omnipotent, magnificent
Mad significant God with an Immutable, immovable, unchangeable
Nature, Jesus Christ the only Saviour check the flavor</pre>
