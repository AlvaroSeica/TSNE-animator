Song:   Alone Again
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Madam Majestic]
Miles and miles I've seen the world and gone far...
It's not that same... time again...
To have, to hold -- to keep, to free
To love, to live, to sleep, to lay, to play...
Day to day...

[Chorus 2X: Madam Majestic]
Alone again...
I'm like a flower, cuz I've grown again
Although it came to an end

[Madam Majestic]
I can feel you...
You can feel me...
But time is of the past... you talk about
Will you listen?...
Can you hear me?...
I'm ready to go... get back again

[Chorus 2X]

[Madam Majestic]
The clouds... the clouds are complicated
The situations I create...
Had put me around... round...
Try to run things beyond...
My control...
Though I sit back and play the truth
I'm frozen...
Miles and miles I've seen the world and gone far...
It's not that same... time again...
To have, to hold -- to keep, to free
To play, to slay, to lay, and play
Day to day...

[Chorus to fade] </pre>
