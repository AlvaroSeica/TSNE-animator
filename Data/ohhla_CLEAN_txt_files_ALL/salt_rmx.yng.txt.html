[Ying Yang]
Shorty crunk on the floor wide open
Speak so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a eighteen wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine but this ho killer
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator

[Murphy Lee]
So fresh, so motherfuckin' clean
If the booty's a drug then I'm a fiend
She's slangin' like a damn drug dealer
Nice sized booty but I wish it was bigger
She pretty like a nine to ten
She wit it and so is her friend (come on)
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
Maybe we can talk later (maybe we can talk later)

[Fat Joe]
When the sun goes down and my dick grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Crack, and I ain't mad at that
But all these wack bitches, where the bad ones at
Where the chicks make a nigga wanna marry that
Make a nigga go and trick, buy a cadillac
A cadillac, I'm just gassin' black
Tell her what she wanna hear cause her ass is fat

[Ying Yang Twins]
Shorty crunk on the floor wide open
Speak so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a eighteen wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine but this ho killer
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator

[Fatman Scoop]
Let the ho's in free, let the ho's in free
Let the ho's in free, let 'em in, let 'em in
Let the ho's in free, let the ho's in free
Let the ho's in free, let 'em in, let 'em in
Now throw that thang like it's off the chain, oh
Throw that thang like it's off the chain, oh, oh
Throw that thang like it's off the chain, oh
Throw that thang like it's off the chain

[Jacki-O]
Welches, strawberry, it ain't jam
A hundred per cent beef, shit it ain't spam
I'm so freaky, they stay treatin' me
Neck bricked up, chick stay gettin' licked up
I been hurtin' em, been Prada shoe, Chanel skirtin' 'em
Been murkin' 'em, oh been workin' 'em
Queen of the south, they wanna do me
They wanna chew me, they just love the ghetto booty

[Ying Yang Twins]
Shorty crunk on the floor wide open
Speak so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a eighteen wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine but this ho killer
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator

[Juvenile]
She rollin', just look at how she movin'
Niggaz breakin' their necks to see what she doin'
She got a big fat, uh, in between there
I hope it's clean in there before I get in there
Have you ever had a date with a millionaire
With canary yellow diamonds shining everywhere
Slow motion, like Soulja told ya
Cut that bullshit and shake it like a ho supposed to

[B.G.]
Hot girl, where ya at, get loose
Stand right there, show me what you could do
Break it off, let me see ya tear it down
Do it like my girl Mo from Uptown
Shake with it, ya shaped like a Coke bottle
Walk with it for me like a Hollywood model
Damn, you're doing that there
Your man say he gon' put his shoe in that there

[Ying Yang Twins]
Shorty crunk on the floor wide open

Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator

[D-Roc]
I got your bitch pussy poppin' in her pants
The beat got her ass in a trance, holdin' up her God damn hands
Liek I dunno why I wanna dance
But she shook it, shook it, shake it every time she get a chance
In the booty club is the place to be
Where the bitch so crunk she'll shake for free
Got her up, get her pumped, that what you gon' see
Bald head, pink leather, that punani

[Kaine]
My name Kaine, I'm damn sure glad I came
Butt naked bitches gettin' off the chain
Bouncin' that ass like she ridin' a dick
Here's a ten and twenty, keep dancin' bitch
Cause I like the way you shake that shit
Me and my brother in this bitch, show a nigga what you workin' with
I see ho's, ho's and more ho's
And none of these bitches got on some clothes

[Ying Yang Twins]
Oooooh
Shorty crunk on the floor wide open
Speak so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a eighteen wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine but this ho killer
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker, tremble like a vibrator</pre>
