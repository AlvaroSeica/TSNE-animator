Song:   Familiar Faces

[Chorus] [Sample of Gary Jules's song 'Mad World']
"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow"

[Verse One]
They say don't put off tomorrow what you could finish today
(I say) The rest of your life's only seconds away
(I rate) Success of a life by decisions we make
(I hate) The fact that they judge every step we take
(I can't) Wait for the Lord, Revelation's my fate
(I paint) Pictures with words, fascia, teals and grays
(I shine) Hot as the sun you can feel my rays
No wait you can feel my rage!
I'm burning inside, nobody can speak my language
We all wanna be different, but we doin' the same shit
Wear the same clothes, same chains, same cars
Got the same goals, wanna be the same stars
Same heart break, we carry the same scars
I carry the same scars!
And when you finally made it, there's no real friends just smiling faces

[Chorus]
"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow"

[Verse Two]
It doesn't start on our birthday
Half of us wasn't planned in the first place
The other half of us was given everything they got
There you have it, the have and the have-nots
I was born on a black spot
My life's a plane this song is the black box
Put it on, heed it
Hear the final five minute's of a genius the world will never see it
Never believe it
It's in our palms but we can't seize it
Within our reach but we don't reach it
Don't tell me that I can't be it
I haven't won till it ain't even
I ain't leavin' till I ain't breathin'
No apologies, no tears
No emotions, no fears
Look at my face you can't even see the years
But carved in the tree are the words "I was here"

[Chorus] 
"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow"

[Verse Three]
NO!
No one can tell you what you oughta be
(My) My silent thoughts are heard audibly
(It's) It's like people don't have to talk to me
Their body language speaks louder just when they crossing me
Brushing me, bumping me, touching me, I can feel their energy
Hating me, loving me, cocaine and Hennesy
Mix it with ego's, music, models and industry
It's hard to separate reality from fantasy
So does it matter if I'm here or not?
If no one's around, could you hear the shot?
Would my father miss me, you think a tear would drop?
Would the world stop spinnin' and the clock stop?
I think not

[Chorus] 
"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow"</pre>
