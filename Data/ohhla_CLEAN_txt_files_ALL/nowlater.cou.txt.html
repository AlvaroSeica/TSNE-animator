1-   Oh baby.....oh baby
     Oh baby.....oh baby
     Hey , hey

[Boots]
Well if you thrust, eventually you gonna gush
And I'm implyin' I ain't had no business cryin'
Cause we used the rubber twice
And we knew that shit was dyin' to bust
Well we was only seventeen
But you was older in between
And in my fresh Adidas fits
I used to come more clean than Jeru jerkin' off in a can of chlorine
Sophisticated with the game I was spittin' in
A nymphomaniac was with it, that's just a clip, more experience
Be on my chest when I was put to the test
You said "Got damn nigga, that ain't how ya get it in"
Dashboards for the leverage, tall cans for beverage
The weed can make you courageous, make a Honda Civic seem so spacious Make 
five minutes seem like ages, anyway

[Chorus]
You smelled like Care-Free Curl and nowalaters baby
Said you liked high-top fades
And Jesse Johnsons "Crazy"
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much today Im still campaignin'

[Repeat 1]

[Boots]
The lake don't smell so bad now, do it
Don't trip off ya hair baby just re-glue it
The windows is fogged up, can't nobody view it
Put down the O-E and turn up the Howard Huett
And some more, we had things to discuss
Like how we do it, we got ambiotic fluid
And a baby floatin' though it
Hey, imagine if it look like us, it was me up in the vaginary
And I'ma love my kids whether real or imaginary
Quit school, work well depends at the mall next to Fashion Berry
Operation cash and carry
Manual labor from six to noon
Makin' six kabooms, got a baby that's fixin' to bloom
And he befits the groom plus grips the spoon
So let me twist the ploom
And inhale and emit the fumes

[Chorus]

[Repeat 1]

[Boots]
I was composed, I didn't even crack a frown
I was supposed to let my parents fall down
And show my ass when I found
That the baby was four months early and around ten pounds
I heard a lot of bad things about teenage mothers
From those who don't really give a fuck about life
She said "It ain't so much that they startin' out younger"
"It's just they supposed to be more like a wife"
Meanin' you ain't shit without a man to guide you
If ya mama tried to feed you that she lied too
Make ya grab any motherfucker that ride through
If jobs are applied to knots can get tied too
Plus I know that you must have been scared
It made it easy when the feelings were shared
Flashback to 20/20
I know you waitin' for the dollars cause you knew I had funny money
Yellin' all loud like I'ma tear the whole hood up
Don't tempt me cause the real daddy stood up
He said I was a mark for believin' in you
Now it's more that I'm seein' is true
There's a few things I'd like to say in this letter
Like I wish I would've seen him grow
And ask my wife I learned to fuck much better
And thank you for lettin' me go
Yeah, thank you for lettin' me go
For real, thank you for lettin' me go

[Chorus]
