Upper level, ghetto twins

Thug players, real players

Verse One:

We droppin bombs on you bitches yeah just like that
We don't show no fuckin love when we stars of the tech
This ain't no act nigga this a fact you gonna bleed
As we proceed to give you what you need
Bustin rounds at our enemies watchin em drop
Bust they back wide open got their body locked
Niggaz wanna test me, check me, wanna come and get me
Get that machete, leave their body wetty
Confetti is how your body goin to get left 
Bitch we deadly, if you don't believe dat their
Come come raise the dum dum to the skull
And to niggaz who disbelieve fuck all y'all

Chorus:

It's gonna be a murder murder fuckin wit them bitches
(repeat 3X)
I say murder murder murder murder, I say murder murder murder murder

Verse Two:

It's gonna be a murder murder fuckin wit them bitches
We got I ain't grunted niggaz wishes, we vicious
We pullin plugs on them niggaz who is dying slow
Pumpin slugs in them niggaz who just might know
Where the weed at where the keys at
If you don't want no feedback just release that
I think them scared of the violence
Fuck the sirens, put that tech to his side and leave him hollerin
Dodgin bullets like an athlete bitch
You don't feel this, can't nobody check me bitch
We gonna kill this, niggaz exit ??? so it's on on
Hit the dome with the chrome now you gone gone, gone gone

Chorus

Verse Three:

We got a ??? for them bitches we gonna ride tonight
Put some ammo in my clip and if we die tonight
There ain't now love in this motherfuckin game ya see
Pumpin slugs in the motherfuckers playin wit me
We be thuggin on the south side
You won't try and get by thats a lie cause i
Pumpin holes in the motherfuckers wannabe G's
Nigga please you don't feel me
All that playa hate I can't tolerate
Neva procrastenate don't make violent
Niggaz would love to see us incarcerate
Pumpin slugs ain't got time to conversate, so get it straight

Chorus</pre>
