Typed by: AZ Lyrics

{Hallelujah... Tell these hoes they gotta glo up one day, Bitch you gotta}

[Chorus]
Bitch, you gotta glo up one day [x6]
Bitch, you gotta...
Bitch, you gotta glo up one day [x8]

[Verse]
Pull off in the rari, shit I gotta glo up one day
I don't fit nobody bitch, yeah I blow up for days
Don't make me get this fucking bitch
I gotta glo up one day
Baby you should let me fuck, shit you gotta glo up one day
I'm the man, I'm the man baby
I'm a glo man, bitch you can't shake me
I'm gloed up, gotta get more money on my baby
Saying you don't wanna fuck me, bitch you must be crazy

[Bridge]
Bitch, you gotta glo up one day
Even pour you one
I take somebody whole life savings, just spend it on one
Blow and turn yo whole Block into a runway
I'm bout to go and everybody gotta glo up one day

[Chorus]</pre>
