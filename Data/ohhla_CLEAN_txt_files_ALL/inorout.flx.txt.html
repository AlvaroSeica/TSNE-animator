Hangin out, with young thugs, that all carry nines (Yeah! D-Block!)

[Verse One: Jadakiss] (Styles P)
For years we had one of the best recipe on the market
He runnin 'round like he a soldier (But he a target)
Alot of your careers was over (Before they started)
It take a special nigga to know this (Where your heart at?!)
I'm pullin up in the club I'm in a spaceship
(A whole nation of thugs that embraced this)
These niggas tuckin their tummies and gettin facelifts
(They still tryin to ball) I'm James Naismith
Yeah! Twelve cylinder pushes
And this bubble gum rap (Is just killin the woofers)
And you know I'm blowin the haze (Dealin the kushes)
(Tek on the dresser) AK still in the bushes
Settle it in the street (We ain't tryin to do court)
Scratch offs (Bootleg liquor) loose Newports
(City is mine) The home teams who I root for)
(All time) Two three eighty nines in the Coupe door
(The dark comes) The sun goes
(I try to be dumb low) 'Cause these crack babies is gung ho
Flossy touch your funeral (In the front row)
Give 'em the new Jordans (Then lettin the pump go)
If they can sell it (They can sell it)
Put the pressure on more than likely (They'll tell it)
Smokin on that loud (Can't see it you could smell it)
By the rides with (Same niggas that you fell with) 
Money in the mattress (Guns in the couches)
You thought it was wrong ('Til you ended up) Out here
WHAT!

[Chorus: Sample from "One Love" by Nas] (Jadakiss)
Sellin-Sellin-Sellin drugs on the dime 
Hangin out, with young thugs, that all carry nines 
Sellin-Sellin-Sellin drugs on the dime
Hangin out, with young thugs, that all carry nines 
Sellin-Sellin-Sellin drugs on the dime (IT'S 'BOUT TO GET UGLY!) 
Hangin out, with young thugs, that all carry nines (HA HA HA!)
Sellin-Sellin-Sellin drugs on the dime (DON'T GET SCARED NOW!
Hangin out, with young thugs, that all carry nines (EH HEH!)

[Verse Two: Jadakiss (Styles P)
Yo! Told you I'm the top five the other four don't count
(Catch me on the dope count) Nigga ship the dope out
(Niggas got guns) So go 'head and pull the scope out
(Tryin to get high) So go 'head and pull the smoke out
(If niggas got bread) Then tell 'em to pull a loaf out
(Y'all ain't murkin nothin!) Y'all the niggas gettin moped out
(You don't want a problem!) You don't wanna solve 'em
(You don't want a pissy ass team with a revolver)
Runnin in your mom crib (Fuck around and rob her)
Nigga shoot the shot (Like they playin for Gonzaga
You don't know the steelo (Money off of c-lo)
Took the Diddy advance and went and bought kilos
(That was in the nine six) Now we in the one three
(You ain't Kim K bitch!) And I ain't Kris Humphries
(I ain't gay neither!) I move yay though
We just havin fun with the money (Play-doh!!!)
Whattup though?! (Let ut buss though!)
M-16 ('Cause you a MC Gusto)
L.A. weed (Bay weed)
All this paper around everything stays green
(Big guns) Poppin out the van like the A-Team
(Spit artwork) Our shit hard work
Before they deal their hand (Take a look at the cards first)
A hundred guns (Two hundred bricks) That's mob work
 
[Chorus: Sample from "One Love" by Nas] (Jadakiss)
Sellin-Sellin-Sellin drugs on the dime (WHAT!)
Hangin out, with young thugs, that all carry nines
