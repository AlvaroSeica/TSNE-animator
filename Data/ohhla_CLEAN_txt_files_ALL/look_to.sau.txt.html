[Saul Williams - speaking]
The labels that I claimed as me were no more than a skin
I wrapped around my conciousness as if it had an end
The calendar that gave the date was no more than a sign
I walked behind to find myself in present state of mind
The thirteen moons divide themselves cycles of twenty eight
The farmers write their almanacs the moon is never late
But how we count the days and hours place walls confine the mind
We live in doubt and debt for there is never enough time
The minute, or the moment, how you think is your oponent
If you're listening right now, close your eyes and count to one

[Saul Williams - singing]
And on the morning I was born I faced the sun and shouted
My mama held me in her arms, she sang while my heart pounded
I look to the sun, I look to the sun
I look to the sun - but I follow, the moon
I follow, the moon
It was a rainy rainy day I stuck up my own daddy
I saw the rain fall from his eyes as though the thugs had grabbed me
I look to the sun, I look to the sun
I look to the sun - but I follow, the moon
I follow, the moon
Follow me into the, wavy wavy water {*4X*}

[Saul Williams - singing]
The miles they passed over her face like moods of fear and doubt and
the sheer vibration of her world gave waves and waves and mountains
I look to the sun, I look to the sun
I look to the sun - but I follow, the moon
I follow, the moon - HEY~!
Follow me into the, wavy wavy water {*4X*}

[Saul Williams - singing]
And when the waves crest to the mountains
Dogs and people fled the town
I could hear that lady shouting
over every screaming sound
And the one who ran beside me
grabbed my hand and started back
And the people turned and followed
and the dogs just stopped and sat
She said
Follow me into the, wavy wavy water {*8X*}</pre>
