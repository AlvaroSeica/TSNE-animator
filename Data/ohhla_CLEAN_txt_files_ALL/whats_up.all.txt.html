[Intro: Allah Real]
You... you...
You... you...

[Chorus 2X: Allah Real]
What's up? Girl, talk to me
Your not the person that you used to be, see

[Allah Real]
Now we've been friends for a very long time
I know there's something that be on your mind
What is right, what is wrong
What's happening baby, what is going on?

[Chorus 2X]

[Allah Real]
Time will always tell the truth about you
No matter what, you have to go through
To keep it real, is a very big deal
Tell me what you see, to me...

[Chorus]

[Hook: Allah Real]
You know me
I know you
I wanna let you now, one thing babe

[Chorus 2X]

[Allah Real]
Just like kids, but I don't want you
Now I wanna wanna, I'm not full
This is something, that stay in mind
Talk to me sometime...

[Hook]
