[Slow Pain *slowed down*]
Leanin', pimp
Leanin', pimp
Leanin' like a G do

Chorus:
[Cousin Mario] We'll be rollin' 405, P.
               Passin' 'round that Hennessey
               Rollin' up that endo weed
[Slow Pain]    Glidin' in my Cadillac
[Cousin Mario] You can hear the speakers, P.
               Even from another street
               That's how people notice me
[Slow Pain]    Glidin' in my Cadillac
[Cousin Mario] When
               The two-fours
               Start to tip toe
               Shine and zip, (???)
[Slow Pain]    Glidin' in my Cadillac
[Cousin Mario] We gets dough
               Yeah, we gets dough
               Fa sho
               Aww, shit!
[Slow Pain]    Glidin' in my Cadillac

[Slow Pain]
(Verse 1)
Glidin' in my Cadillac (Llac)
Here, front and back to back
Flippin' through them oldie tracks
Marvin Gaye, I'm lovin' that
I'm feelin' that
White tee with a Pirate hat
Twistin' up my money stacks
Ten G's
I'm rollin' that, I'm rollin' that
Vogues on my Cadillac
A.K. ate his slow train
Swervin' in the slow lane
Baby girl, I'm Slow Pain
Crawlin' on them Daytons
Tequila in my mouth
605 boy
Rollin' 605 south
What

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Glide in my Cadillac
Spendin' chrome 24"s
Suicide doors
And a chrome .44
Player, lay it on the floor
Like a rag, six-four
Hoppin' up and down, baby
Choppin' up the town, baby
Limo tint
Blacked out
Tip and toe and passed out
Baby wanna ride
But we packed, so she assed out
Rollers on the plaque
With a diamond in the back
Rest in peace, Casanova
Man, I love you like that
Pimpin' so heavy
Man, I'm pimpin' all night
Leanin' to the ride
With my future Rican wife
Blowin' on that Ono
See the coppers, oh no
My Cadillac, my low-low
Rollin' in that slow mo

Repeat Chorus

Hook 1: Slow Pain
605, slidin' on right
Glidin' on chrome
Puffin' on lye
Green, Hennessey
Up in my cup
Lean like a G
That's what up

Repeat Hook 1

Bridge:
[Cousin Mario] Girl, I know you
               Want to roll with me
[Slow Pain]    What, you wanna roll with me
               Tokin' on that endo weed
[Cousin Mario] Girl, I know you
               Want to roll with me
[Slow Pain]    Well, you wanna roll with me
               Sippin' on that Hennessey
