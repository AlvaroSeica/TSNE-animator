{"Hey kids, rock and roll"}
{"Rock on, soothes my soul"} Rock on
Yeah {"Hey kids, boogey to, the DJ"}
Dizzy~! {"Hey, shout, summertime blues"}
{"Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes"}
Dilla~! {"Hey kids, rock and roll, rock on"}
Yeah

And I shall, name Diz I'm at the top of the pile
And like a new sensation I'm the talk of the town
Just admirin the ladies out walkin around
And first I, line 'em up and then I'm knockin 'em down
Now I can stand out and hand out remarkable style
Or I can just, blend in like I'm part of the crowd
Got my family and friends all watchin me proud
Colorful, personality but far from a clown
I might hit the spot and bop a bit, meet a broad, pop some shit
But game's to be sold I was told, so I auction it
No bargainin, this session is stone
that rolls out of the way and my direction is known
I throw it out, they go and catch it like they fetchin a bone
Swear this shit is so easy that no effort is shown
On a road less travelled so I step it alone
Out to collect, what I'm owed then go rest in my throne
Gibran motherfuckers, yeah I'm starvin like a muh'fucker
Keep gettin larger 'til I'm chargin like a muh'fucker
Ain't another brother closer to winnin it
When I see somethin I want then I go get it
Lookin for that...

{"Blue jean, baby queen"}
{"Prettiest girl I ever seen"}
{"See her shake on the movie screen"}

{"Hey kids, rock and roll"}
{"Rock on, soothes my soul"} Rock on
{"Hey kids, boogey to, the DJ"}

Hey! {"Hey, shout, summertime blues"}
{"Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes"}
{"Hey kids, rock and roll, rock on"} Rock on, uhh

And I will, name's Dizzy, also known as Khalil
Sure to bubble like a soda 'til I'm over the hill
Steady holdin my composure my persona is chill
Drink some Coronas, think I'm gonna throw some coal on the grill
Just enjoyin good times like bologna and milk
Keep flowin them good rhymes, someone throw him a deal
Rehearsal is universal, got a global appeal
And with so much, fake shit you gotta notice the real
It's disco, heir apparent, think it isn't when it is though
Get the party rockin keep it poppin 'til the shit's closed
I get those, respectable ladies, also the nymphos
Probably wanna ride, where you from? Call out a zip code
I expose and pull out, they put out and get low
Dinner, maybe a bit mo', that's about it though~!
No pillow talk, no commitment, no info
No data, no "Family Matters" or Carl Winslow
Just a little timid or frigid until we get close
But back at the crib all that shit goes out the window
Might call or not at all, all depends though
But be cool, we can stay friends though
I'm lookin for that

{"Blue jean, baby queen"}
{"Prettiest girl I ever seen"}
{"See her shake on the movie screen"}

"Whattup though? I was just callin to see
 if there was gon' be a party tonight
 Just in case, you didn't get my MESS-age
 I was tryin to go deep throat"

Crazy, chopped up, unadulterated
Hehehehe, y'knahmsayin?
There's so many words to describe Dilla man
that we can't even put 'em in the dictionary
Because they're just, new words that you create
Y'knahmsayin? Like
Astronomical-nomical-nomical
Astronomical's in the dictiory but not that
astronomical-nomical-nomical
That's J Dilla man, y'knahmsayin?
Put a lot of extra...
Let's get into it right, about... {*abruptly ends*}</pre>
