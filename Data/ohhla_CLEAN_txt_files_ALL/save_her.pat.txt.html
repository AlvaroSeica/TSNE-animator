Welcome to the Hypnotize zone 
Today you'll hear the story of Russell Resthaven 
And the day he tried to save his girlfriend 
Here's the story 

(Project Pat) 

Man you won't believe what done happened to me now man 

(  ) 
What? 

(Project Pat) 

I let this nigga come out my house and he fucked my bitch 
But I'm gone kill him when he get off work tonight though 

(     ) 

Man fuck dat hoe man you can't be tryin to save that bitch 
My nigga and them housed the hoe on brown and frayser 

(Project Pat) 

Man I spent cheese on her and everything and I bought rangs and some mo 
shit 

I'mma kill that nigga dat I'm goin marry 

(        ) 

You can't turn a hoe into a house wife man 

(Project Pat) 

I love her man 
I love her man 
Quit lying man 
I love her man 
I gotta marry her man 
I'mma marry her 

(Chorus) 2x 

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved 
(Ain't nothin going on but the money and power) 
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved 
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward) 
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved 

(Verse 1: Project Pat) 

I'mma introduce me Project Pat I keep it real 
I'mma introduce you you's a sucka faking deals 
If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life 
I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife 
I don't even get why you be eating out her draws 
You done bought the bitch a phone 
Now you screening in all the calls 
It's about 4 A.M. she ain't nowhere to be found 
Some-where wit her friend dick in face and turned to ground 
But you best save it last and you know that she'll go 
Suckin dick, chewin cat, and I hear she on that blow 
Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew 
Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew 
I know just what to do 
You can ask the hoe to leave 
Once the bitch pack her shit 
Hurry up and run them streets 
Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before 
It's a U.F.O or a hoe that wouldn't go 

(Chorus) 2x 

(Verse 2: Juicy J) 

Jackie's simple 
Jackie's quicker 
Jackie likes to suck a dick-a 
All she wanna do smoke a blunt get a drink of liquor 
Lip-ah to the balls booty even enough to smell dodie 
You be tryna save a sweater but you need the fuckin letter 
Be the bitch she really is-a 
Suck my dick you goin kiss her 
Hating hoes try to dis her every nigga wanna hit her 
Get her in the bed lay her down boots wanna fell 
Call her up there nig man there's a way-a 
She the star of the foota pussy wet real gooda 
Camcorder caught on tape did I stutter man I should of 
Fucked her in her mouth fast she be taking all cash 
Keep my tank from Florida she pay for my gas 
Ass for my nigga drop-a somewhere tryna watch her 
Pregnant by another man but you wanna be the papa 
Nut, come, but she crave-a backseat misbehava 
You'll never get the bitch cause she wit that West Haven 

(Chorus) 2x 

(Verse 3: Crunchy Black) 

Ain't nothin goin on but the money and power 
Got one in the chamber fo you weak ass cowards 
And I'm tired of you niggas goin saving dese bitches 
Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get em' 
I ain't trying to be a trick i'n just sayin my dog 
Let a nigga get deep down in them draws 
Take her over to my dogs so we can do em' y'all 
Everybody can do it let's just have a ball 
Ain't nothin goin on but the money and power 
Too many niggas out here cowards 
They be saving dem hoes they be paying them hoes 
But a nigga like me can not go 
I'm be kickin in doos I be fuckin dese hoes 
I be slamin em down like Dominoes 
Bitch you didn't know it's CB bro 
In and out dese hoes does like whoa 

Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power 
Don't save her 
Till it fades out </pre>
