[Chorus]
Lower Case gods bow down to the capital
G to the O to the D who be rulin'
Lowercase gods bow down to the capital
King Jesus is Lord, yo who you be foolin'?

[The Ambassador]
My God anoints so I be on point just like a cactus
Fact is, my tactics are blessed with the phatness
(oh yeah) Here I come, coming from the Kingdom
I bring them good news that say they can redeem them
Who's He? Ooo wee, I thought you'd never ask me
Jesus the Christ with life everlasting
King, Lord of all, Planet Designer
Diviner, clothed in a robe of shekinah
I'ma find a phrase that conveys with exactness
Who He is, check it y'all - Mr. All-thatness
Why attack this with that anti-Christ wackness
Slow your roll, let Him be the Lord of your blackness
and your whiteness
Any ethnic type-it's all pretty dim
next to Him and His brightness
I'm on a roll, I aim for the soul
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
Hold all the chatter cause the data I speak
Is unique, it convicts with every tick of your heartbeat
I know the code of the street (what?)
Curse, rob and kill, smoke weed and wear Tim's on your feet
Eat, but you don't feel complete
You feel cheap, you can't sleep, your heart's bare like a pantry
And ya rather not think so you drink
On the brink of blaaow!
But now I've got the missing link
Wake up, sleeper, and rise from the dead
And Christ will shine on your head full of dreads
Pure blood shed on the ground
He wants to be down
with you, so why ya frontin' now?
Lost earth is my stomping ground
And at the cross the lost can now be found
You'll never find another love like this
Christ is the hypest true sacrifices
You might just get radical, fanatical
He'll make ya flip and have ya gettin' acrobatical
The only bridge over sin made capital
Lower case gods bow down to the capital

[Chorus]

[The Ambassador]
Strange, out of this world, they call me loco
But I clocked it, my optic was bifocal
Uh oh, I saw myself for what I am-dust
Plus, saw my demise if my eyes stayed shut
What was I to do with this death in my face?
The crew, blunts, the brew, or get saved by His grace?
I fantasized and I analyzed, understand me?
(Ambassador...) You shoulda heard the lines that He ran me
My Man, the I AM, the Slain Lamb
He died for my sins, every nook, every cranny
He'll seek us and reach us, this Jesus
and He, man He, can He... forget it, I'm speechless
Now my flava's major, it be boomin'
Consumed in Christ, now I'm a new type of human
I'll be a light to the hip-hop type
lovin' to kick it with the wicked it's day meets the night
I glow in the dark knowing the heart's evil
People hate good because bad be lookin' diesel
Nobody wants to be right, they love error
They're a prime target for the sin and the terror
The never will end 'til the trumpet is heard
A white horse comes in, the Rider's name is the Word
But until then, I'ma fill in while I'm buildin' up the Kingdom
And I'll bring in the villain
Kill a man's will when this love comes at ya
You say you got hand skills, but His gloves are faster
Master, sovereign and factual
Lower case man can't stand, bow down to the capital
Lower case man bow down to the capital
G to the O to the D who be rulin'
Lowercase man bow down to the capital
King Jesus is Lord, yo who you be foolin'?

[Chorus]

[The Ambassador(Talkin)

LORD, all caps, all caps, Mr. All-That
'Nuff shouts out to The Cross Movement (oooh)
Raise the banner, raise the banner, raise the banner, ha peace</pre>
