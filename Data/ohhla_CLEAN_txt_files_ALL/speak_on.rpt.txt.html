[Kurupt: Intro Talking]
There's only one death row everybody else is imitates
Can't stop more gang riding
First of all let me break this shit down for ya nigga
We gonna do it like this lil' home girl in the house
Let me tell you bitch niggaz something check it
First of all ain't no new motherfucking Tupac's nigga
DMX ain't the new Tupac, Ja Rule ain't the new Tupac
And I'll be damned if 50 Cent is the new Tupac
Ain't no new Tupac's motherfucker
Shit get off Tupac dick nigga
Ain't no new motherfucking biggie smalls punk
Nas ain't biggie ain't no new motherfucking new biggie smalls nigga
Get off biggie's dick motherfucker (Shit Shit)
Nigga let the legends be (Punk)
Yeah everybody wanna go to war
First thing they do when they go to war
Is wait a little bit, make some money
And then go holla at arcane
Man fuck that get off arcane's dick nigga (Shit)
Cowards there's a lot of issues going on
Another thing ain't never been no east coast, west coast war motherfucker
Nigga war was real they were between individuals not coast
You motherfucking hyped up ass media motherfuckers
Get off our dicks (Nigga)
Trying to make things bigger than they are
And all you funny ass labels that roll with it
Like there is an east coast, west coast war shut the fuck up
Nigga, you coward, you punks the reals is back

[Chorus] 4X
Speak on it, speak on it, speak on it, speak on it now

[Kurupt: Verse 1]
Stop talkin' about shit you don't know what you talkin' bout
Never was there what you talkin' bout
Everything you don't know about
Don't think cause your cool with Snoop
That you can do anything that you wanna do
First it's war next its donation false mediation about situations
Take over conversations nigga stop acting like a bitch
Stand up just like a man get your game together
Before a nigga gotta teach you some table manners
Like Kokane said 'To all you suckers get your motherfucking
Knuckles off the table motherfuckers?
I smoke me a cigarette nigga knew ports
Just came up with some other knew thoughts
Like people get paid when we smashing on our own
Doing what we want I smash them on my own
Get the black and the brownie few
Put K's and 9's in the hood
Put crack and crash in the same area
So we can make it look no good
Blame it on hip-hop and gangsta rap
All why these streets keep polluting
All off the murders and all the shootings
All off the hood niggaz trapped and stuck
Fucked nigga blame it on Kurupt
Or how Tha Dogg Pound is broken up
Cause I just don't give a fuck
C. Delores Tucker use to burn our records
Rivernal shockers use to burn our records
Now niggaz making money off other rappers
So beat a dick and eat it or eat a dick and beat it
Back in the days you were professional clappers
Clappers turn rapper, rappers turn actors
Doing it big and everybody wanna show niggaz where they live
Nigga I'ma tell you niggaz like this
Get the fuck off a real niggaz dick
And break bread nigga

[Chorus] 4X
Speak on it, speak on it, speak on it, speak on it now

[Kurupt: Outro Talking]
You know what I'm so burnt with these busters
For real ey tom these niggaz don?t understand
Ey sparks these niggaz are marks (Too much)
Fuck em?, Fuck em?, Fuck em?, Fuck em?</pre>
