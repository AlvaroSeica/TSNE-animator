John Doe/ (Vex):

ohhhhh
yeah
(John Doe, this sound like the Sho Shot)
yeah
?, that flow like the breeze
(Word Up)
(Hightower on the boards, knah what Im sayin, my man Mo)
(Yo, but, there is a lot of negativity flowing through hip-hop these days,
know what Im saying)
Got to kill the noise
(Brothas dont understand, they need to)
Check the whistles in the wind (repeated)
[Whistling]

John Doe:

Release yo mind and slip with me between the crease of time
Cause peace of mind is the condition people cease to find
I be sublime, my composition is equally refined
I redefine a definition, read between the lines
The seeds of time produce the everlasting fruits of life
Confusing strife has got me moving on into the light
A youth in flight showing and proving how we do with mics
We rips at night sho nough improving grooving to precise
We knew the price to rule the mics and know we paying dues
They saying who those D-Low brothers who be slanging crews
Parlay with booze, and choose to snooze, its just a wicked tool
Defusing trinkets cause we link it with infinite jewels
You know the rules and keep it real if you posses the gift
Stop the slander propaganda like a sedative
Some mental states perpetuating all thats negative
I manifest and bless the gift, thats all I set it with

Vex:

Walking down blank corridors
Weapons stored in the arsenal of the memory bank
My tongue is sharper than your shank
I rank high on intelligence and low intolerance
For your trife life and ignorant irrelevance
I swell against the system
Rebel against the walls of the lies, like wind-wind
Angels are at war in the skies, open the eyes of demons
And leave them hypnotized
More crises on the rise inside me
Live walk the path for to lightly and wildly, so stomp on past while I be
Stars guide me, aquestrial  (Say What?)
Celestial plains and back again
And blowing to and fro like whistles in the wind

Mondo:

Now
If you would ever been wondering why
You see what you see on the dynamic screens of TV
Isnt the same as when you was a shorty believe me Im no expert
I was raised on Pac-Mac and Q-Bert but know I see Phycics Network
Sodom gains its power hourly
Transferring air perceptions of right living into your mental imagery
And soon the whole world follow so being so surprise
You find yourself on your knees one Sunday morning worshipping the sunrise

John Doe:

Lets get scholastic and evaluate the aptitude
Commercial tactics making rappers cause you actin rude
Your altitude has got you nothing to stand firm upon
I was among the magnitudes when night first turned to dawn
Jah blessed the light, address the sight, ignite my third eye
Insight my wisdom penetrating to your fur top ?
You  know my essence, my presence bring forth new faith
I stand alone a battle on against the two faced
Babble on, I hold my own cause its rugged though
I be that diamond in the rough, see a nugget gold
I got no time to encourage your procrastination
They want my mind, assassinating my imagination
And thats a crime premeditated so through meditation
I write my rhymes incarcerated in my situation
My soul I find as I recline in the precipitation
I be sublime within, forever living like the whistles in the wind

Vex:

Ha, ha
Transmit frequencies through my soul
To make vinyl and plastic turn platinum and gold
Not materialistic, but man these material
Check social security, and how they changing serial number to health care
Thats sold by Clinton to your moms
The Armageddon
With rebel forces dropping bombs like first Psalms
A napalm on Vietnam
I dissipate electricity through my palm
The only man considered with a mic heavily armed
Peace to all my heads and the city of  ?
Representing with John Doe and the Riders of The Storm

Mondo:

Youre keeping things warm
Little black male its on
Man Im feeling this song
Lets rock it on, and keep it on, and move it on
Now bust it right when I was on vacation
Like I put these thought in proper perspective
Now I got this main objective
And thats to be selective with all the words I choose
Cause garbage be on the airwaves, and videos too
Lost for words every time Im roaming the streets
I see to some buy Brahman record cause he has fat beats
but HE AIN"T SAYING NOTHING
And this  dilemma sweeps the nation
See the joint entitled "And Then What," for further information

And it dont stop
To my man John Doe
Rock, rock on
To the Vex to Vortex
Rock, rock on
To my man John Doe
Rock, rock on
To the Vex to Vortex
Rock, rock on
These be whistles in the wind yall
