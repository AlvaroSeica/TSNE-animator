I ain't happy,
I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy,
I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Music is from the street
Designed to make you
Move your feet and
Feel my emotion
