This is my story G, day one on Southside 
Southside till I diiii-iiie... 

[Trae] 
It gotta be Southside all up in your face 
Well I'm creeping and crawling, up out the states 
I made nineteen years and a candidate 
No time to plex, I gotta stack my change 
And working wood on the grain, in the turning lane 
With a 18 thousand dolla, throwed piece and chain 
In the big body Benz, with the raw beam 
Six inch t.v.'s, when I drop the screens 
Drop the top, some fin to hit the fate 
When I'm baller lining, I'm be a bate 
Looking through my shit, watching yellow bones 
And its whether or not, they be creeping my car 
Roll hard on weights, I gotta peep the game 
I'm in a private plane, in a private lane 
With 13 karats, in my pinky ring 
On a pen and pad, I lace up the game 
All on the radio, and on the t.v. 
To the world premier, we on MTV 
Plus so many niggas, really can't see me 
Body rock the states, and pop up on three's 
When I'm swanging 4's, I'm slamming candy do's 
I'm on my P's and Q's, and I love this game 
That's why, everybody wanna knock my hustle 
We done just got rich, and went platinum man 

[Dougie D] 
Thank the Lord for all my success 
Been struggling striving, trying to do my best 
No more canned sardine, just eight cuisines 
Its been a long run, running from the law 
Got a new pair of shoes on feet 
And I owe it to the Southside, cause it's been lovely 
Everybody wanna run with me, and popping trunks all bubbly 
And everybody in the club with me 
Hold up, baby you know the South is so real 
Whit cups and my drank, and blowing on kill 
In the STS, dressed to impress 
With a bow legged round the side, to roll with 
Y'all need to just understand, its so live 
Many dollas into powder stacks, that's right 
When I'm up in the Benz, drop tops in the wind 
Chopping to the corner, then I bend 
Why a motherfucker wanna hate on me man 
Cause they can't get off they ass, and stack change 
Down on Southside, we don't play no games 
We pop trunks on the corners, and the turning lane 
Just realize, and stop fighting the pencil 
Cause I pimp a pen, or a pencil 
Its about time, that your ass gon recognize 
Guerilla Maab is some cold individuals 

[Hook] 
This is my story G, day one on Southside 
Southside till I diiii-iiie 
On the road, to reach in the T.V. and BET 
And I owe it to the Southside 
Southside till I diiii-iiie 

[Willean] 
Niggas can't hold me back, I hold the gat 
Thought of many ways, then told you that 
Talking about, golden plack 
Diamonds in your face, done showed you that 
I roll the Lac, I stroll the Benz 
Get the weed, I'll po' the end 
I'ma ball till I fall, fuck waiting till I score again 
We big shots with big glocks, on top I play it cool 
On my block, while I lay my rules 
On your block, while I spray with tools 
Slay them fools, with my steel 
Let them know, this shit's for real 
Botany Boyz, Guerilla Maab 
A killa squad, making mills 

[H.A.W.K.] 
Fuck what you feel, time to pop a seal 
Only when we grad, it's a major deal 
On the Texas wheel, trying to make a mill 
Serious, bout that dolla bill 
House on the hill, yacht on the lake 
Can't get close to my estate 
Like Ice Cube, push rhymes like weight 
Haters, we anialate 
Don't violate, or try to hate 
Licks been heard, in the Texas state 
I just can't wait, to set thangs straight 
Texas is the rap state 
Let's conjugate, hop in the Benz 
Guerilla Maab and Dead End 
On that chase for benjamins 
In this shit, we play to win 

[Hook] 

[Z-Ro] 
Pulling out my yard, as I drop the top 
Ready for the jackers, I'm gon cock the glock 
Pulling up at the club, everybody show love 
Might slow my pace, but never stop for bops 
Cause when a nigga didn't have weed to smoke 
Seemed like them hoes, had a need to choke 
So I bled the block, and I bled the block 
Exactly what I need, for the seeds to grow 
Now I'm living myself, Z-Ro today 
Even though I had road blocks in my way 
I made it over the hill, I guess that was the will 
Of that man, for me to get outta the game 
I sold weed and crack, on down to heroine 
Sporting clothes, on motherfuckers payroll 
Many golds and the movies, Guccis 
Fassaci's, Guess and diamonds Karen 
I smoke and I lean, but still I maintain 
Ain't a damn thang changed, I'm still the same 
Breaking motherfuckers off, with a sock by mouth 
Represent the South, about fancy thangs 
My pen is throwed, and my pen is raw 
24/7, I'm gon break the law 
At the end of a show, I'ma take a bow 
My knees wanna be me, speed rolling be how 
I flip my tongue fast like that 
Rubbing up on tracks, and wrecking 8 Dats 
And the Real-To-Real's, and it takes Sedan Deville 
With a separate bitch, on the grill 
I bleed the block, now with the rocks 
I bleed with the candy paint 
Sipping promethazyne, codeine 
With a Jolly Rancher, with a Dandy on drank 
And I got my mind focused on benjamins 
Dividends in the back, of a big Benz 
22 years old, with fat back roll 
From a tight ass verse, and I'm in the wind 

Check it out, Southside Story baby 
Z-Ro, Dougie D, Trae, Willean, Big H.A.W.K.
