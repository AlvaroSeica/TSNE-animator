[Hook - 3x]
Coming from the Westside

Cuz, you know how we do...

[Trae]
On the low cause hate, niggaz got me tipping a corner
My black drop sitting high, like I was on marijuana
Bitch it ain't nothing but the West, from the bed to the block
I been repping it twelve plus, and I be damned if I stop
I'm a Ass and by the way it ain't just so I'm stuck in my ways
With a fuck you attitude, old school floating a maze
But if it's drama don't get fly, cause I'll be floating them K's
To make your lifeline stop, and have you floating for days
(Southwest) is the home of the Bloods and Cuz, folks and thugs
Where niggaz swang the block for the bops, and spinning them dubs
And ask them hating niggaz who did, they know what it was
The West is well respected, respect it or get drug

[Hook - 4x]

[Boss]
I'm in a Screw cool Cutlass, with the casket seats
On the Westside of the H, where the Assholes meet
Better watch how you speak, cause Assholes keep big heat
Running blocks like a track meet, with heat seekers and skeet
See me out doing my thang, all navy blue strings
H double O-V gang, doing my C thang
In a coupe cocked up on the corner, I got quarters
I been doing my thang, I got speed weed and water
Fuck around with Lil' Boss, you get shot beat and slaughtered
These niggaz don't even paper right, pockets so I ain't bother
Make me go get the chopper, and cut niggaz up like barbers
Busting at robbers, on 20 inch bravas for trying to rob us

[Hook - 4x]

[Jay'Ton]
I'm riding through the Southwest, sitting sideways
Jamming on a Fat Pat, steady getting paid
Run up on the slab, get greedy with the gauge
A lot of niggaz mad, that 18 is my age
Plus I got the Lac, with front back to the sides
Diamonds on the roof, with six twelves when I ride
I glide through the streets, like a fo' do' jet
Plus I'm never ever seen, like a fo' do' Vette
On the block of Westays, 7-8 double O
I'll spin when I crawl, ten roll on the fo's
Pop trunks get exposed, saying fuck you hoes
Thirty karats in my grill, I spent a ten on those
