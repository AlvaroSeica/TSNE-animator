[Royce Da 5'9"]
We them backpack niggaz
Rap rap niggaz y'all be talkin shit about all day
Internet, underground niggaz
Our intellect just won't allow us to make records y'all way

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Get over yourselves, fucker
Get over yourselves, sucker
I guess that we them backpack niggaz
Rap rap niggaz who will never sell a record no way (guess what sucker)
We made it, we made it, we made it
But we did it our way, our way, our way
Though it took some time but we finally made it
Now can you truly say that you made it, your way?

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Dear Mr. End All Be All of an Opinion
Fuck what you sayin, you've got fans but we've got minions
Plus Eminem got Stans, like an arena, I went and seen it
From abroad to back home, y'all ain't got to clap, we gon' make this track
Clap, clap, clap for him, let me take y'all back
We turned one song to a group, to a concert, to a record deal
And yes it feels - more like carpentry than artistry
God's work, uh, let's get real
All you hear is them niggaz like 50 too, while we in the '62
But it ain't no industry business I ain't privy to
Yeah, and for y'all niggaz that's tired of it
Just lay down, and picture your soul over your body

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Check my rhyme timeline I took, time with every line
Now I don't rhyme unless a, check gets signed
My bank account, it don't look bad, I got House Gang hood swag
I'm a +Crook+ that'll +Jump Off+ with +5 9's+ or a good jab
Hell yeah I could brag, dude ain't never switch
Whether the booth or on the strip I kept a Mac, in my bookbag
You mad lil' nigga, cause I'm holdin the belt?
Do some ad-libs nigga, get over yourself!
I'm here for the duration, you here to reputation
Slide them Dre's over your shit, prepare your ears for devastation
Cause if, Yaowa on that muh'fucker, Yaowa goin in
Y'all wan' be mad, go right ahead but once again

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
As a posterchild for Photoshop my whole image was wrong
Straight out a movie, took a pill and all my +Limits+ were gone
Now you mention the best and you gotta argue son, clothes I used to borrow some
Now it's name-brand drawers just so my dick could see how far I've come
Changin the topic to women they know me to keep mine in labels
That's how they drape, but judgin on shapes I should keep 'em in stables
They left him for dead, took 'em to watch me resurrect, the shit's pathetic
Shouldered the blame, it's a shame it took hindsight to give me credit
I got kitchens in the masters, that fish tank is a wall
I got couches in the closets, my estate is confused
When you say that blatantly for the fools that missed with a blessing that steal
There's no other outcome when you question my will

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
They said I'd never make it, huh (never make it)
My rhyme scheme is a crime scene, dawg I yellow tape it
for lyrical murder, I'm on the verge of my next merger
Had to crawl before I walk, so after I ex-Gerber
I took it a step further, I took over the web servers
I took over the West, word to these fresh words and rode the wave of web surfers
A circus, that's what this industry makes me think about
Cause sellin out's a shortcut, integrity's the scenic route
But you have never seen a crew or better team
While you forever sleep we doin everything you fuckers dream about
Sucker, "Slaughterhouse" is what they scream and shout
Not the crowd, I mean your bitch now

[Chorus]</pre>
