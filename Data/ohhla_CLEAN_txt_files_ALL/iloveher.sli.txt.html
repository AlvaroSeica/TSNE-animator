Song:   I Used to Love Her
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I knew i'd miss her
So i had to put her
She's buried right
In my backyard
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
She bitched so much
She drove me nuts
I guess we're happier this way
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I had to put her
Six feet under
And i can still hear her complain
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
I used to love her
Ooh yeah
But i had to kill her
She bitched so much
She drove me nuts
I guess were happier this way</pre>
