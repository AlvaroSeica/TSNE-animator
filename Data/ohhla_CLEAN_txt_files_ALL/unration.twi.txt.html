Song:   Unrational
Typed by: RappazDelight69@aol.com

Dependin' on the weather, or whether or not I bust you with these lyrics
The rhythm is imbedded in the bass drum, can you feel it?
Nod your head so I know you're down with me
When I'm spittin' and preachin' on my philosophy
Can I begin with a fuck you
To all of you
Mothafuckers talkin' shit about and and my fuckin' crew
My mind's in space like an astronaut
I'm weighin' in a little bigger than a mothafuckin' juggarnaut
I'm on the edge, down to fold ya
Like a soldier
I'm crazier than Ray Liotta
I thought I told ya
Now I'm here
To paint my lyrics on your ear drums
Your brain is the canvas
Cannibus
I smoke some
Get dome
Ill is my mindstate
I demonstrate
Performance and skills derived from my lyrical traits
I pack the formula to styles like a chemist
Balancing the chemicals and imbreed pecimisst
My appearal, black hat, black shirt
Gettin' mo' pussy than Captain Kirk
My fame comes and goes like the threat of war
Ready the troops, feel the wrath of my sword
My tongue cuts your mind with the depth of a razor
Pickin' off the target with the infra-red laser
Breakdown, because I'm tickin' like a time bomb
Paranoid, schizophrenic, nervous, never calm
I feel the tension of life, no other way to relieve
Unless I stop for a second and I breathe....See how it sounds a little 
unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
A lot of MC's like to use the word dramatical
Another demension
I never hesitate to mention
About the Retro Horror Music plus the brain dead; it causes tension
Inside of my mind because I'm blind to the facts
Of the truth
Troubled times equal pain in a nigga's youth
Shoot
On my boot
For a needle thru my vein
Feel the shockwaves travel straight to my brain
And I might be trippin' up off the flashbacks
Pessimistic rhyme
Plus the mind
Causes heart attacks
Artifacts
Covered with dirt
In the ground is the bones
Fossils of the past
Follow the path to my haunted home
Again it's on
Cuz I come back from the grave
Diobolical mind in '96, I'm on the rave
Can you contain the metamorphosis of evolution
Eardrums poundin' from my loud noise pollution
Confusion
I got more power than Ultraman
in Shazzam
Dramatical
Yes, I'm unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds...Motivated by the rhythm
To bring life to the instrumental
Taking my abstract sound to another level
And bringin' forth the lyrics that you can't fuck with
And if you smell somethin' stankin', that's me, cuz I'm the shit
Check the hit
A lyricist is my profile
Leavin' suckas stankin' while I'm steppin' in the meanwhile
No smile
Because I'm known to be able
This wicked
Pass me the microphone and watch me kick it
As I dazzle the crowd and compile the rage
With the speed and agility of a hurricane
I'm the man, you know that I'm dramatical
Peep this shit, yo, the tune is unrational
A lot of MC's like to use the word dramatical
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
A lot of MC's like to use the word dramatical
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
A lot of MC's like to use the word dramatical</pre>
