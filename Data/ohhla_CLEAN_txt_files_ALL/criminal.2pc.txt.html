[Intro/Chorus: Triple Platinum]
Born in the days.. of a Criminal
Criminal, criminal, criminal
Born in the days of a Criminal
Born in the days of a Criminal

[Verse One: Tupac]
Born in the the days of a criminal
Running from the cops and can't let them see me
So I'm hoping out the Benz
It's time to let the vallet step, gotta make my ends
So business on the under temple, coppers wanna drop
So tell them not to fuck with me and Oaktown gets too hot
I'm heading for Marin City, though hunted like a fugitive
Those punks will never capture me, technine on my side
Uzi stay in back of me, I'm black from head to toe
I move in daze of silence
The smoothest criminal, a lunatic for violence
So I be taken no shorts, when the shit gets scandalous
Broken off this ST, so nigga we can handle this
Run up and get smacked up, packed up and smacked down
I'm a player, there's more in the J-town
Bitches wanna jock, and run their hands all in my hair
Whore give up the cock, or you can get up outta here
I'm living like a mac, the narcist will be minimal
Niggaz getting jacked when their cap peeled back
In the days of a criminal

[Chorus: Triple Platinum]

[Verse Two: Tupac]
I'm kicking kilos but I started with a quarter ounce
Serving with faith cause every little dollar counts
Making my grits and trying to get my mail on
So fuck a cop he get dropped if he steps wrong
I'm the bad guy, everybody points at me
But fuck them, all, as long as the trigger is happy
Making my cash flow, how long will it last though
Pimping ain't easy but I'm still leaving your ass broke
Pass the vapors as the papers will be coming in
I give the cuts and give a fuck about being a friend
Bitch I'm a player got no time to be bothered with
Having no babies and no long term relationships
Because a bitch will be a bitch no matter what you say
That's why I fuck them, bust a nut, then I'm on my way
Soon as I finish, I regret I even fucked the whore
Cause she'll be blowing up my beeper before I shut the door
But fuck a bitch, I keep my mind on my drink cause yo
That's how I'm living in the days... of a criminal

[Chorus: Triple Platinum]

[Interlude: Tupac overlapping the above Chorus]
It's the menace of Marin
It's the menace of Marin
It's the menace of Marin

[Verse Three: Tupac]
It's the menace of Marin, I killed, I'll kill again
Ain't nothing funny about the game I'm rolling in
You got a problem with it, Mister handle yours
I ain't no joke, I'll have you broke down to your drawers
I'm trigger happy and I give less than a fuck
Love me or hate me I'ma sure 'nuff rip shit up
It's Mr. nothing, nice on a mic stand
Mic in the left and the zest in my right hand
I took a puff, had enough now, hold up
If that was Indo, niggaz getting rolled up
You think not, get dropped, we can handle this
Cause Tupac brain locked on the cannabis
Days are dangerous, shoot them but you can't miss
I never tripped of your bitch cause she's scandalous
Now come and get a good look at the crook
Who.. lives his life in the streets of the jungle
Some call me animal, tell me how you figure though
Put them in the nip.. in the days of a criminal

[Chorus: Triple Platinum until fade]</pre>
