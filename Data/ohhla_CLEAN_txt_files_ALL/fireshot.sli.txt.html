So me go

For these people they running 'round
Out of control
They running round them wicked out of control
Jah jah be with you
But until we meet again
Jah jah be with you
Until we meet meet meet again
Fire no fire now
Fire down below
Below below below
For these people they running 'round
Said them out of control
They running round them wicked out of control
What's this what's that
Budda boom boom shout out fire
What's this what's that
Budda boom boom shout out fire
Fire fire now
Fire down below
All these people running round with them out of control
But they run around they wicked out of control
It's just the s-t double o p-id
We comin' straight for ya
When im on ya microphone bet we rock shit like a warrior
An' dem' girls
You gonna be doin' what those guys do

Said these girls
You gonna be doin' what them guys do

If all the girls yes them live 'cross the sea
If all the girls yes them live 'cross the sea
But what a great swimmer I and I would be
But what a great swimmer I and I would be
But I want my
Ink is pale girl
My pen is dry but
My love for you said it will not ever die
Because me love you 'til the well run dry
But I love the music make you feel so high high high
When I seen 'em in the alley way alley way
Well they remember that
Lord have mercy
When I return my bass it was gone
In a matter of fact
I looked around lord have mercy then I didnt know what to do
Im callin' im the one
An' me be callin' I want two
I return to the pad that'll tell ya that i'm through
I'm singin' a little song for you sing a little
Fire fire now
Fire down below

All these people they running 'round
Said them out of control
They run around come again them out of control
But jah will be with you
But until we meet again
Jah jah stay with you
Until we meet meet meet again
No part of me old
No part of me old
