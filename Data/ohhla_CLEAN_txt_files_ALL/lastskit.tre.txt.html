What's up? What's up?
Still in the building like I said earlier
Ay music fan I'm out here doing some convention stuff
I done had about five plays this week
They are consuming the album very well
They got it like a month, almost a month after it dropped in America
They just now gettin into uhh
It's crazy to do shows for those who don't speak English
And they still be going crazy like hmhmhmhmhm
You know what I mean uh
So we tryin to decide between a second single
It might be "Missin You" or it might be "Last Time"
Either way it's gon' be cool
because I think both of them are great lovers
I just know that balance takes longer to build that radio, so uh
I mean I need y'all support on whichever decision I do make
and right now gon' go into "Last Time"
