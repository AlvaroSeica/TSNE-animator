[Intro]
One time for the Coke Wave
Can I get a "HANNN"

[Chorus]
I pull up on the corner stuntin' like "hey, my guy"
It's mac with da cheese - "hey, my guy"
I got it for the low-low - "hey, my guy"
You talking to the po-po - "hey, my guy"
Breaking down the brick, choppin' down the rock
Break it down, bag it up, shuttin down the block
I pull up on the corner stuntin' like "hey, my guy"
It's mac with da cheese - "hey, my guy"
I got it for the low-low - "hey, my guy"
You talking to the po-po - "hey, my guy"
Breaking down the brick, choppin' down the rock
Break it down, bag it up, shuttin down the block

[Verse 1: Max B]
See, I'm bout to start trial for this murder shit
Satan want my soul but I'm riding, nigga, suck a dick
Layin' just to pluck a chick, playin' I'm gon' fuck his bitch
She don't know my guy...
See some niggas in the trenches that was schemin' on my ride
Bitches creamin' on my ride, fiendin' for my high
Got the po-po, got that one hand up, they leaning on my guy
Fuckin' bitches make me sick
But I just give them the finger and keep rollin' with my guy
Keep strollin' with my guy
Got mommy in the Caddy and she blowin' on my guy
This shit ain't for no wager, this bitch owe me a favor
This nig owe me some paper, they raided all my pot
Damn that paddy wagon, they takin' all my guys
They be raidin' on my tribe, knowing how much we... felon
Pop a shot up at ya melon, bitch, chop that powder, sellin' it
Copped it for the Hell of it, made her play my guy
Said she fuck with Justin Timberlake, bitch, go get my dinner plate

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I pull up on the corner stuntin like "hey, my guy"
Bumpin' Don Biggavel, damn I miss my guy
Shorty curve, said she ain't tryna fuck tonight
So I made a U-turn on the first right
Man, I gotta be cold, fast money and hoes
United we stand, divided we fall
Miley Cyrus... nigga, don't blow my high
I think I see a nasty bitch tryna fuck up my life
I'm with the shooters and the slurpers with my homie
Run trains, never save them, pictures on my phone, and
Macaroni with the cheese - "hey, my guy"
I'm on two, dick on freeze - "hey, my guy"

[Chorus]</pre>
