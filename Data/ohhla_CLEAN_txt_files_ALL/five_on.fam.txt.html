Song:   Five on a Track
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Lighter Shade]
Step into your cipher, break down your vocal
Nile is the focal, start pouting total
The visible, under crushing, MC's over coastal
Laying in the cut, like constant the noble
In the beast naval, we all living fatal
Hold down CLO's, angle and chief from my cradle
They probably peep us through the cable, break bread like Jay-Z
I live a hysterious label, rock that street fable
No man, fuck around with Conan, every program
For my whole fam, back to the homelands
Knights of Round, travel through these types of sounds
What up C-Wigs, what up Lounge, snatch rounds on the underground
Kingdoms are calm, unite palms, drawning bomb bombs
Driving on your And 1, helded in my right palm
Q lock the chromes like a pipe gun
Dream of the icon, oh my God, that's why I write on

[Shawn Wigs]
Switch the five at the top of the block with cordless mics
We tore up the desert like Israelites
From the Barracks, shine embarrass, we rock karots
And jewels like Egyptian kings and hold things
And rock it til the last MC does the Nile
Exporting a song, we walk, Staten Isle
Heads held high, some guns is awake
You wanna swallow that son, but you can't stand the taste
Blackball rap, but you got time to waste
These Ferryboat niggas is bout to bout face
Attack, survival of the darts on the track

[Lounge Lo]
Dart specialist, my tailgate flow, the rap arsonist
Pardon this, 33rd street, and Square Garden
This is gridlocked, these kids on your block are big shots
And like Alfred Hitchcock, I bust five to make the bitch stop
Right to your dome piece, and fold real quick
And while you drapped out in black, your girl's riding my dick
These muthafuckas walk alot and talk alot, the same shit
'98, 19, I gel wit the same click
Hass, Clock and Wigalo, Crunch Lo and Q
O.T.F., S.T., number two
Before you want war from who, me and my crew
It's that kid engineer loop, betting ya'll who, it's like

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Lo]
Niggas say who them cats, five on a track
Bet you ain't us, out the anus, your famous, yo fuck that
We bust back, I run wit a fam that love gats
Yo, we thug around the map, it's like that
Aiyo, we thug around the map, it's like that

[Crunch Lo]
Aiyo who blaze it, flame the mic and front stage it
Scrape shit, step above the means if it's basic
Real dog, step through fog like the phantom
Crowd from the gat, like the body beat anthem
Dancing off the set in a breeze, grow weeds
Lungs squeeze to his knees, in the set, blades freeze
Bitch factor, if you shining, get it yakked up
Fighting back strapless, that's how you get clapped it
Beneen, Allah Kareem, wreckless abandoned
I'm handling, speed, like I'm scrambling, last man standing
Ferocious, when I wrote this
Leave 'em quoteless and hopeless, stuck in the focus
Of my technical, bless your whole crew
Tackle unfaithful, O to the two F's
A mess on devices, the plan to snatch a thousand grams on some hype shit
The nicest, we spiced it up, if you front, then the ox get you diced it up

[Molly-Q]
I stalk New York, rappers get stuck like a statue
Stay attached to, smack wives, crack attitudes
Q damager, ghetto minds stay danger, stranger
Re-arrange, hold migraines, the golden anchor
Hold down commitee, big boy moving shifty
Shiesty, blazing our left, all my righties
Whitey Black, back on the map, yo turn it back back
Slug attach your craft, biograph' rap, maniacs in fact
Your palms sweaty, heartbeat, dumping plenty
Chumps catch slumps, from eternal wide slugs
Bare luck, blackout battle down south loud mouth out
Italian never drought, battle axes weeded out
Shruggle the hustle, with muscle you wanna tussle?
Tunnel vision rap, twist caps and make you mumble
Jarweed telepathy, no apoligies
Supreme in pedigrees, my mic change degrees, it's like

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
