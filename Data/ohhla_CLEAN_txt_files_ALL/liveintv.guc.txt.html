[Gucci Mane &amp; DJ Drama]
One for the money, two for my jewelry game
Three for my luggage game (Dram' cruise!)
Crazy luggage game Gucci
Four for shoes, five for my closet same size as yo apartment
(Mr. Thanksgiving!) Well damn Gucci!
(Pay attention!)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
*so icey* the promises coca leaves like sosa
I shoot you just like tony
well homey now yo sister 
now I scarface Gucci
my life's a motion picture
Gucci Tarantino casino Gucci Pacino
I'm Gucci Mane soprano more keys than a grand piano
watchin +Blow+ thinking George should look out for Diego
I'm smoking on that +Color Purple+ working like I'm Harpo
Feeling just like smokey felt when Craig beat shit out Deebo
Call me Gucci watch me, freeze me, save me, watch me Tivo
Ya album came out I rated it, (?) I hated it
Boyz in tha hood, got juice in ma jewelry
Cars +Fast &amp; Furious+, shout out to my boy Ludacris
Superfly, high school higher than an eagle eye
I think they should legalize my flow stronger than turpentine
trafficking like bailey brick is standing cross the border line
bust a brick, you tell her sniff, she say that it's party time!
frieghtening and scary so they say I gotta horror mind
Gucci Mane not Stephen King but my car crazy like +Christine+
Rosemary baby born young &amp; broke in 1980
Black and broke I'm thugging crazy, made it hard for mom to raise me
said it out the president, jump out the trash campaigning faces
eddie murphy trading places temple son
Gucci Mane but you can call me shady grady
haha gansta grillz you bastard
Gucci Mane will be ya daddy

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
TV, I live in a TV, I live in a TV
it's Gucci man laflare, I live my life in a TV
tell me do you hear me lady
I kno that you see me baby, I live in a TV, I live in a TV
tell me do you feel me ladies, I live in a TV
Gucci Mane laflare, I live my life in a TV
I kno that you hear me baby, I kno that you see me baby

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
picture me posing is ya plasma
don't chu think I'm handsome? there's no need to answer
my watch is so handsome... better yet attractive
hoes think its cute
but my money got my pants saggin,and I'm international
and I'm icey like yo baby daddy
naw, I'm 10 times icey then ya daddy
tell ya boy the truth, that his daddy is a faggot
only reason that you had him was for yo fucking taxes</pre>
