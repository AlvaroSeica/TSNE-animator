[Hook: Beace]
Yeah, Yo
Roll the dice how much is your life worth
Somebody cursed in church, The knife, The mic I murk
Roll the dice how much is your life worth
Somebody cursed in church, The knife, The mic I murk
Roll the dice how much is your life worth
Somebody cursed in church, The knife, The mic I murk

[Beace]
And it don't stop, My Maza Yukon Denali down-shifted on the road blocks
Around the clock, Got over writers block now the glocks cock
And my mic got hair lined trigger, Things change
Do you remember the last time you heard shift like this
I wasn't always a starter at first I came off the bench
In a pinch I play all five positions
No question I study my lessons and stay on a mission
What's your plan young man, A new day has arisen
Play yourself in a rider position
Catacalysts, My captains dismissed as superstition
We're wishing, Complete your square and be firm in your conviction
Me flowing is poetry in motion, Cop that forgotten chosen and get open
Yo money aint right cause you spent too much time loaf'n
This was destiny since conception in my Mom's fallopian

[Sample 4X]
