[Fingazz]
Get ready
Get ready
For the gangster, gangster
Get ready

(Verse 1)
[Down]    Here we go
          Put your gloves on
          Load up the glock
[Fingazz] Somebody gonna get shot
[Down]    Let's get ready to rock
          Eastside got the biggest fuckin' balls
          With some vicious motherfuckin' dogs
          With the evil S runnin' through my fuckin' blood
          And we ain't gonna stop
          We tearin' it up
          We bringing it rough
          And we don't give a fuck
          This is straight up
[Both]    Gangsta love
[Down]    For all my eses that are
          All bald
          Taking your wifeys and taking a car
          Or sitting in the kitchen
          Cooking cookies in the yard
          This is strictly for the doggies
          In San Quintin, sittin' behind bars
          With thirteen bullets, (?) just seen it all
          Walking the yard with shags, ready to brawl
          This is for all y'all
          From the bottom of my heart
          Gangsta shit
          And that's ours

Chorus: Fingazz
That gangsta shit
As you ride up and down the eastside (Yeah)
For the one time homie
It's the C-O, L-O, N-I-A
Motherfucker, we don't play games
This is that gangsta shit
As you ride up and down the eastside (Bitch)
For the one time homie
It's the C-O, L-O, N-I-A

[Down]
Down
Down
I'm Down

(Verse 2)
[Down]    I'm the type of dawg that loves to look good
[Fingazz] And not like those bitches that do what they should
[Down]    Bring you 501's .48's
          With the chrome gun, representing the hood
          Sitting on a brand new ride, so it's all good
[Fingazz] You know it's all good in Cali
[Down]    I was hanging out this one afternoon
          Getting all brewed
          Eating some dog food
          I was rollin' through the hood
          Bumping some old school
          Puffing on a bamboo, feeling like a player should
          This is for the tailors that bumpin' the Kenwood
          And for my gang
          That's dressed in all blues
          Sitting on chrome shoes, ready to stick a move
          Looking sharper than a zoo suit
          Going on a limo cruise, chugging on the deuce-deuce
          Gone with some evil loc's, lookin' for the prostitutes

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Fingazz
No, you can't stop the gang from bangin' on ya
Cause you're too hard up in Oxnard, California
And motherfucker, yes, I tried to warn ya
You can't stop that gangsta shit
No

(Verse 3)
[Down]    I broke the handcuffs and loaded my gun
[Fingazz] And if you step inside the wretched, you're gonna get thugged
[Down]    I put the blunt to my lips and fired it up
[Fingazz] Smoke the whole damn thing, then we roll another one
[Down]    I got hoes lined up
          Ready to fuck
          So I called up my dawgs, so I hit the rugs
          It's on, doggie
          Take your leash off
          Tell your hoe you'll be back, and drop that bitch off
          Turn all communications up
          And let's get it on
[Fingazz] Baby, let's get it on, til the break of dawn
[Down]    It was 9'o clock
          Wrapped up a session in the studio
          And shooked the spot
          Locked the low-low in the air, about four knobs
          Thinking like I'm drinking, throwin' signs at the top
          Leaving the block
          Thinking about pussy
[Fingazz] L-O, V-In'
[Down]    And getting a blowjob

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
