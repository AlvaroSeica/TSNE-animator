[Big Sean]
Ay, BIG
They say they want something real
That's what I'm a give em
And if I keep it real how could they not feel it

Hey yeah
Can you say GOOD music
Can you say GOOD music

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Let me tell you about a bad ass chick everybody wanna grab her
Tryna climb on that looking for a ladder
Niggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it
Everybody want it
Ain't too many had it
Beauty and brains, went to all the classes
Graduated too even went and got a masters
Bad ass chick probably could have been an actress
So what she do?
She want to be an actress
Moved to Manhattan, shit got real
Took acting classes with Denzel
Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills
Commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill
Yeah, plus she had a baby boy
And the nigga she was with she couldn't love more
Still want more, shit she on a roll
Move to hollywood she could probably get a role
And she did, but realized the nigga wasn't shit
Addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant
With another boy
Honestly thought abort but still had the boy
Let's name him Sean
Honestly probably after Connery
One of her favourite actors but acting ain't promising
Ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you
And that's why I'm giving you

[Chorus: Kanye West In Brackets]
(Whatever you want)
It's whatever you want
(Before)
Just tell me
(Whatever you want)
You deserve whatever you want
(Before)
I won't stop till you get whatever you want
(All the lights)
All the lights
(The love, dreams, you threw away for your baby boy
Hold on, now I'm on my way
Whatever you wanted)

This this goes out to you, to you, to you my lady
