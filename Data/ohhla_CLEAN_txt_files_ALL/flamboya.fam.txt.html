[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Flamboyant rap phenom', that's word bond
But these slang therapists, meditating with gun charm
To the rude boys that's packing the arms
And the niggas with the g's, trynna be like dons
Flamboyant rap phenom', that's word bond
But these slang therapists, meditating with gun charm
Flamboyant rap phenom', that's word bond
Shaolin, Shaolin, getting it on

[Molly-Q]
'69, bring us out, feeling cries, do or die
Wiseguys, white eyes, wet highs and cutting pies
Papali family, sit down, born a huddle
Audible or rebuttle, your whole steeze'll fumble
The thirty eight sweep, in the trenches, off your feet
The jiggy shaking, did the sweeps, steel kind and can't compete
Throw a dutch in the camel clutch, then smoke til I bust
Rub ribs on dust, build missiles in my cut
Cuz you fucked up, family code of silence quarterly
Now I creep unique, watch ya ass and mystique

[Lounge Lo]
Flamboyant rap cats, now bring it back, cat

[Shawn Wigs]
Flaming ass nigga get pushed back and braided
Tender head clowns get they tongues amputated
Stay frustrated, beating cats in they head
If they try to beat me, Mr. Sweet Pea
I stay in the Park, what up God, dunn we lounging
Saturated with slang, we bang in the thousands
New key tank, blew this shit, now sound check
Mic check, from Dubois straight to Killah Projects
Time to get paid, from door handles to slam 'em
With they back to the wall, one touch, I double clutch
Multiplied, disco dance, staying alive
Through my 21 years, 1975
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive, staying alive

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
I be the don, who don't give a fuck like Sean
So bring it on, who that cat talking bout he gonna move on
Simon says, I get big like lead
Campaign, champagne, on the train like Dez Arnest
Fuck a president, he get the finger too
I inhaled number one, exhaled be number two
Angelou, live from the Ooh, 1030
4 my niggas gotta peep this, for my people
The speech oh, watch on ya block how I creep slow
And represent the Hill, like that gears there to reload
Niggas talking, Lounge Lo is kinda softing
Well if it's like that, why don't you bring it to me often
You seen me, right on St. Paul's and victory
But in this rotten city, jealous cats they wanna hit me
Come and get me, I stand still in the Hill
That's word to the screw on my grill, groove be chilled
You never smoked a bone in yo life, I'm boning your wife
Three strikes you out, lights out, it's kinda nice
Muthafucka, muthafucka, muthafucka, muthafucka

[Chorus]

[Hook 4X: Lounge Lo]
Getting it on, just getting it on </pre>
