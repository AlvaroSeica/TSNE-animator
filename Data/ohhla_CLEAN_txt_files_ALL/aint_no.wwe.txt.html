Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Ain't no stoppin me, NOWWWWWWW!

[Chorus]
You can't rock with me - ain't no stoppin
You can't rock with me - ain't no stoppin
You can't rock the man - you're droppin
Ain't no stoppin me, NOWWWWWWW!

[Chorus]

[Lou$tar]
Goin for it all, just tryin to be the best
Feel me breakin out, nuttin more nuttin less
Wanna be known, want the respect
Throw me anything, I'll pass that test
Believin in yourself man changes everything
Yeah I want it all, I'm takin the brass ring
Call me underdog, you can call me anything
I got a lot of blessings, that's what faith brings!

[Chorus]

[Lou$tar]
You wanna start somethin, then go 'head and start somethin
Any time, any place, dawg it's nothin
I'm comin from the bottom on my way to the top
And if things get hard, I still won't stop
See the ambition is what keeps me goin
Faith and the blessings what keeps me knowin
That I'll get it one day, man you'll see
I'ma just be all the best I can be

[Chorus] - 2X

[Interlude]
No!  You can't rock with me
Uhh

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lou$tar] - over Chorus second time
Nah, can't rock with me
Geah, woo!  No!

[Lou$tar]
Ha, can't rock with me
Ha?  Ha?
O-kay!

[Chorus]

[Lou$tar]
Goin for it all, just tryin to be the best
Feel me breakin out, nuttin more nuttin less
Wanna be known, want the respect
Throw me anything, I'll pass that test
Believin in yourself man changes everything
Yeah I want it all, I'm takin the brass ring
Call me underdog, you can call me anything
I got a lot of blessings, that's what faith brings!

[Chorus]

[Lou$tar]
You wanna start somethin, then go 'head and start somethin
Any time, any place, dawg it's nothin
I'm comin from the bottom on my way to the top
And if things get hard, I still won't stop
See the ambition is what keeps me goin
Faith and the blessings what keeps me knowin
That I'll get it one day, man you'll see
I'ma just be all the best I can be

[Chorus] - 2X to fade</pre>
