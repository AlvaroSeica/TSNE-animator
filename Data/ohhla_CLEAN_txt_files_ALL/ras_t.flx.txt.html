	Whoooooh!
"Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill" -&gt; Method

[Ras T]
Finally, could it be?
The long awaited MC, bustin shots from my drop-Z
Extra clips, cases more weights to flip
Some say..

[Funkmaster Flex]
Big shout to the overseer Salaam

"Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill" -&gt; Method

Finally, could it be?
The long awaited MC, bustin shots from my drop-Z
Extra clips, cases more weights to flip
Some say that I'ma trip cause Moet I sip
But I'm, gettin money so I live like that
I can't fuck with charity, I don't give like that
But I'm known to take yours if mines ain't enough
Armed robbery is how, I got free stuff
The black assassin smash a niggaz grill
I beat yo' ass down til your girl say chill
or I could be real mean and rip out your spleen
and push your wig way back to bell bottom jeans
Niggaz fiend, for the rhymes that I kick
You say I'm not the best, you wanna bet me a brick?
And I'll bet you leave here mad and broke
Now explain to your man how you lost his coke
Pockets is mad broke, you bein big at rabbit ears
He'll have you runnin through the desert
with less than underwear
That Queens villain, illin again
Ras T's on the mic with the braids and Timbs
