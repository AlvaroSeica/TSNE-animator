[Charles Bukowski]
Born like this, into this
As the chalk face smiles, as mrs. death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals that are too expensive that it is cheaper to die
Into lawyer who charged so much that it is cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses close
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this, dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinheritated, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs
Land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of thatThe sun hidden there awaiting the next chapter

[DOOM]
DOOM from the realm of l-kalum smelly gel fume
Separting cell womb to melly melly boom
Revelations in brail respirations inhale
View nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze praise the lord
Saving grace lace your broads she say she bored
A crazy straw ink and stale dry parafinCandy coat crap rappers pale by comparison
A batch of marriaging averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps perhaps road kill if that
Gift to gad and he flowed ill crome stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines
Chief and beefing being of deep ends deep this even
Dimes quiet as mines by design mighty fine
Slight rewind tightly bind blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is thenListening to sizzling official tens whispering him again
Medal face finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath gave a f pay your debt they forget
Make her sweat bullets crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wild to social child degenerates
[Voice]
6,000 years ago moses saidEvery human being is responsible for his actions
Or about being is still not human

[DOOM]
You ought to let your uncle flows my motorcyle trunk fulls
From 2 1 2 1 loses crumbs to shrunkured? bundles
Hands down better then what your mans use to get
Standing around from where the transluscent looses spit
Missing wheel you don't listen you're a feel head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing twitching kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catching time in county state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in sea shell
If a tree fell you couldn't tell from 3 cell
Be real carefully they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids acting out is terrible
Word is bond fix your clothes put a shirt on
Pants saggin back when you use to admit you had a skirt on
Skurts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El get closer then ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers
