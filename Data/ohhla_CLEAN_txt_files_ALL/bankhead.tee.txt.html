[Intro]
Westside nigga..
Hey!

[Chorus] x2
I got my 44, and my dro
And my Chevy on 24s, and my ho
Now where am I s'posed to go

[T.I.]
See me ridin in a Chevy, 44 on the seat
With a quarter or a blow get low than we see
No tag, no liscense, trunk loaded with D
Ridin Fulton in D where we know it to be
They pull us over, you think I'm stoppin, you must be fuckin wit me
If they dont want to die tonight, they best stop fuckin wit me
I'm gonna pull over in born home my cousin and B
And they gon hide me in they home while they looking for me

[Big Kuntry]
Hey we the neighborhood superstars
Couple Chevys pullin hard
1000 dollars worth of dimes in the trap with rockstars
We puttin fear in cowards hearts, when they see us on the block
Swervin in the deuce in quarters bustin shots just because
The hell I care about gettin caught, I'm makin bail by 12 o'clock
Back in the spot with the same bomb serving drops
I pull a hoe in Bangkok, dropped her off at TIP's spot
I'm burning rubber, fuck the cops, another dead on my block

[Chorus]

[Mac Boney]
I'm Cadallac daddy, pull up on some hoes from old Natty
I said I'm Pimp Squad ho whats happenin
Westside get them panties, snap
She asked me can I do the Laffy Taffy
I said I do it to make the pussy happy
Let's get a room over on Virginia
Step inside sweeter than ?
Ya airing for a little fender bender
Baby just remember, make it quick
These niggas kind of know me, I'm the shit

[C-Rod]
I'm in a bubble kush Chevy, well at least thats what it smells like
Hit the gas, blue fire blowing out the tail pipe
Tail pipe, thats all these hos wanna lick for the night
I treat em like Tina, beat that pussy and you call me Ike
Thats right, monster ride sittin on the 28s
It sound like a stadium, you would of thought the Braves played
The engine running like Vick, with the Falcons on the hood
Mr., Mr. Westside, yeah you know they in my hood

[Chorus]

[AK]
Ain't no tellin where I'm goin, less I'm steppin out
Sittin on the high life, windows up, in the clouds
Open up the console, thats where I got my gun
Right next to that, get that bag and roll another one
I got the vitamins, make a freak fuck all night
Hos know, killers on the Westside earn stripes
Make that money turn bright, just look at my peice and my grill
Swervin off Church St. the pimp God gave me skills

[Young Dro]
I was born up in Bankhead, yall remember me
Way back in 83', T.I. stayed up the street from me
Just cuz I'm from Bankhead, niggas having beef wit me
Half never seen a G in a cap in my Beamer V
Ten screens falling, my Chevy watch it lean on me
Ridin down Simpson, bout to waste my purple lean on me
Purple linen clean on me, the whole zone 3 on me
Waffle House Charger, yellow-black I got a bee on me

[Chorus]</pre>
