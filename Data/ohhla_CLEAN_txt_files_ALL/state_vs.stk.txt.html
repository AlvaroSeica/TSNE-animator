[Rah Digga]
Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement
 
[Canibus]
Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'wanna 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]
[Rah Digga]
Order in the court!
[Canibus]
I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 
 
[Superb]
Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I wanna testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 
 
[Canibus]
Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?
[Superb]
Yes that's him right there 
[Canibus]
Are you sure?
[Superb]
Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I aint hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 
[Canibus]
You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?
[Redman]
Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!
[Rah Digga]
Objection sustained, prosecution next question 
 
[Canibus]
I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
 
[Scarred 4 Life]
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 
[Canibus]
Is that the moment when he shot him?
[Scarred 4 Life]
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 
 
[Canibus]
Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 
 
[Rah Digga]
Court is now in session, now gettin back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 
 
[Redman]
Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin for the case 
 
[Guess Who]
Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see alot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 
 
[Redman]
Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin in the stand to get him fryin in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin your chick [what you talkin 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 
 
[Guess Who]
Man you crazy man I was right there... [Redman- Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk... 
[Sticky Fingaz]
No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
[He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!] No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin man! He's lyin 
 
[Rah Digga]
Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...
 
[Sticky Fingaz]
Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin man?! She gon' fuckin hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!
 
[Rah Digga]
In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
GUILTY all counts from theft to murder one 
[Sticky Fingaz- Huh? Wha-wha-what?! GUILTY?!] 
By the time you gettin out you gon' have a grandson 
 
[Sticky Fingaz]
Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
[Rah Digga- What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!]
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
[Rah Digga- Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...]
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!
[Rah Digga]
You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that.... </pre>
