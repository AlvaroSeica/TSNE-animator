(Mr. Serv-On)
Platinum when I growl cuz I'm really bout war now

Check you domes got my mind on tight now
Smokin green got me in the clubs bout to fight now
War wounds and tattoos got them hoes screamin
Lookin at a thug whodi, say whatcha really mean
Take me to the battle field, 3rd ward I'm representin
If I die tonight keep marchin, left right
Keep steppin in my name, make them bustas love the game
Cant change if I want to, tell me what you ridin to
Bleed if you aint scared to scream where you from now
Throw yo guns up, throw yo signs I'm bout war now
See me do or die witchu whodi I aint playin now
Pistol to my dome, if I die I aint trippin now
Gangbangas, dope dealers, murder once we ridin out
Lifetime capital game tell the world we comin now

Chorus: (Mr. Serv-On)
Let me see your war face I'm ready for war now
Let me hear your battle cry I'm ready for war now

Court Dawg, the drill sargent bout to set off the war
If you didn't come to fight then whatchu come here for?
If you the king of the hill then your mountain gon' crumble
Cuz I'm the hardest after all, (lets get ready to rumble)
Braids in my hair and my pants is saggin
Got that thang in my hand while the freaks is naggin
Don't let the baby face get you stuck up fool
Cuz I do you somethin bad take that ass to school (Ya heard)
That's how we do it capital game style
Spill you noodles out your head
Get em off, spotty dotty with the infrared
Serv-On hold em up, fold that trick like a pretzel, finish em off
Leave em in the street, gonna need a shovel
Ballin like I'm sposed to, crackers say put down rocks
Dodge the cops, cuz I'm strikin all the tweaky twats
Don't you never play with mine or break me off no disrespect
Ill stop you in your tracks, so you bet I'm ruthless
