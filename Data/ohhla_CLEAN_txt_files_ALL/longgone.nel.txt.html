One wrong move and I'ma fuck her
You a lollipop nigga you a sucker
You broke, and she like hustlers
I'm rich, and I like ho-ers
Hey buster, last chance
If that's yo' bitch you better hold her hand
Cause you don't go to the beach and bring sand
I want yo' bitch, you know my plan

And they'll fit as 'bout as lame as yo' man, hah!
