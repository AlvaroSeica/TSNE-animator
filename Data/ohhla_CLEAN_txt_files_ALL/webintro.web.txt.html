Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Welcome, welcome
I'd like to welcome you all to Webster's Laboratory
I'll be your host for the evening
Chris Webby if you didn't already know
Step right in, let me show you around real quick
Ha, let's cook some shit up
(Ehhhuh ehhhuh)

Yeah, yeah
It's that verbal visionary, criminally, literary
Spit it clever bitch it's Webster you can check me on the dictionary
Under author credits, I'm the author get it?
Mind sharper then a cutlass that I'll saw your head with
So authentic Donald Trump's is my apprentice
Shave his fucking comb over off his head and made my exit
They can't see me cause me see dyslexic
Cooking acid tabs in my omlette during breakfast
Three moves in Tetris, nah, but I got a triple stack
I'm talking E pills till I can't remember jack
Shit, rolling with aliens like men in black
Reppin' for Connecticut, run and tell Kemba that
I'm a dirty dog down to fuck your lady raw
Roll a j and sour d get twisted like a crazy straw
I'm a motherfuckin beast off the leash
Until the obituaries say that Webby is deceased
Killing beats call a priest, they can't censor me, cause if they try
The whole fucking song will be a bleep
I'm a chief like Squanto, skin tone blanco
Rolling on these bitches or better stash to Rondo
Rolling up cilantro, rolling in a Bronco
Running people over like it's Grand Theft Auto
CT to Cabo, I'm killing them with hot flow
Getting paid and spending more money than the lotto, easy

So you see, here in Webby's Lab
I'm gonna be hitting you with a lot of samples, some industry beats
All cooked together with a nice topping of dope lyrics
Oh yeah and it's free, courtesy of Datpiff, and myself of course
The album's coming soon so buy that, but until then, enjoy this

Yeah, it's that wacky highly underrated rapping Caucasian
I'm not in it for the fame and the money but shit I'll take em
I've been waiting here patiently while others got big
Now I'm like, "Pick me coach, I'll slaughter these kids"
I'm so hungry you can hear my fucking stomach through my ribs
Call it dibs on the title let me show em what it is
I'm wrecking tracks doing shows and getting cash, huh
I'm Triple X way too big for any freshman class
It's in my repertoire, every single bar is hard
Spittin' fire like I'm the human version of Charizard
Or super smash brother, make that money stack brother
Stick my dick in instrumentals kill em on my last rubber
Motherfucker what, long as I can bust a nut all over a track
And then I'm bouncin' with a couple sluts
Not to be derogatory but you need to drop it shorty
Take em panties off I'm in that ass like a suppository
Pop a 40 and chug until I'm puking all over the rug
Never sober rollin' a bud, master of the multi-syllable raps
No one's iller in fact with a precision Reggie Miller would bet, huh
I'm just a Looney Tune way more rude than you
And if you don't like what I'm doing, sue me dude
I have an ever and I'll never give an F word
Cooking shit up in the lab like Dexter

So boys and girls, 6 mixtapes deep
And I still haven't lost my touch as you can see, you know
I just really wanna say thank you to everyone that supported me this far
I feel like it's really time to take this shit over, ninja swag bitches
So again, welcome to Webster's Laboratory, and have a lovely fucking day, yeah</pre>
