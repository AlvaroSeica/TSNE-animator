[Intro - Royce Da 5'9" - talking]
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
It ain't nothin like (like, like)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Preme

[Chorus - Royce Da 5'9"]
It ain't nothin like love from the hood (hood)
Ain't no feelin like rollin through knowin you good (good)
'Cause you been keepin it real
When niggaz see you, they salute you (salute you)

Love from the hood
Ain't no feelin like rollin through knowin you good
'Cause you been keepin it true (true)
When niggaz see you, they salute you (salute you)

[Verse 1 - Royce Da 5'9"]
Royce Da 5'9" give ya ill verses
Ryan Montgomery is the real person
No makeup, that's why you couldn't touch me up
I remember bein locked up (locked up)
This nigga walked up, tryin to battle (okay)
I went ahead and let 'em finish then I told 'em "do that again I'm a 
fuck you up" (true story)
Now take a journey through a nigga's psyche
The only snitch in my life is the chick tryin to split up me and wifey
You think you like me, I'm aight with that
I don't even call my nigga Budden "Mouse", it sound too much like a rat
So may your steps be just like your stacks (stacks)
High, afraid of death, havin a life attack
It's I, got the soldiers for the coca price
Your poker face on, I'm a turn your channel to the "Poltergeist" (woo)
My out of town niggaz know the business
When you land, I'll come get you, we gon' get it

[Chorus - Bun B]
It ain't nothin like love from the hood
Ain't no feelin like rollin through and knowin you good
'Cause you been keepin it real
When niggaz see you, they salute you (salute you)

It ain't nothin like love from the hood
Ain't no feelin like rollin through and knowin you good
'Cause you been keepin it trill
When niggaz see you, they salute you (salute you)

[Verse 2 - Bun B]
It ain't nothin like walkin your block
One deep on your city streets nigga, no hawk or no glock
No blades in your mouth or box cutters in socks
'Cause real niggaz show love and bad bitches on your jock
Every corner got a homie you know well
Even if somebody see a deal, then they won't tell (shh)
Your man say he got the goods, so you tryin him out
The ice cream truck roll through, you buyin 'em out
The youngsters helpin out the old folks (hold up), with something hard to do
The kids is playin, nobody beefin and it's a barbeque
And every backyard with the old school jams on
Sweet potato pie courtesy of your grandma (already)
Everybody's home, nobody on the yard
We drinkin and smokin the night away with no regard
Nobody arguin and everything's good
Man it ain't nothin like love from the hood, that's understood

[Chorus - Joell Ortiz]
It ain't nothin like love from the hood
Ain't no feelin like comin through knowin you good
'Cause you be keepin it real
When they see you, they salute you (salute you, come on)

It ain't nothin like love from the hood
Ain't no feelin like comin through knowin you good
'Cause you be keepin it G
When they see you, they salute you (salute you, word)

[Verse 3 - Joell Ortiz]
It ain't nothin like, what I do every other night
Pick up the liquor, send the fiends to go get the cups and ice
Sit on that project bench and have some of the funnest nice (come on)
We spend that wrong doin makin money the summer right (yeah)
The smell of somebody barbeque got my stomach hype (mmm)
'Tata salad, rice and some chicken, a little something light (uh huh)
A beast with the cards, they always ask me to shuffle twice
Swear that I be cheatin, I'm just fuckin nice (haha)
Cut that, rug rat, niggaz that robbed, never tried your boy (never)
Only just me, no security that I employ (nope)
I never need to wear iron toy (why?)
I ain't naive, I just hang with some killers and I'm their pride and joy (yeah)
But nah, ain't about that right now (nah)
It's about the jokes, weed smoke and the cat fights, meow (what else?)
It's about them New Year's on the roof, with your gat like bloaw
Outside the booth I'm the truth, give me dap like "yowwa" (haha)</pre>
