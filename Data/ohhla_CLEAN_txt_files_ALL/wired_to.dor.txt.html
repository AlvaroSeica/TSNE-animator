"T! T! Wired to the T!"

[Dorrough - Verse 1]
Oh my! (Oh my!) Guess who&gt; (Guess who?) 
Mr. D-O-double R-O-U 
to the G-H, do I know you? (Whaaa??)
Yea get it girl, show 'em how a pro do 
Wired to the T, I got the whole club 
Wired to the T, man hol' up (yeah!)
Wired to the T - if I like it I'm gon' throw dubs 
So gon; drop it down, make ya ass in the flo' world, girl 
I'm, gettin money like ya ain't never seen 
So, shake it for me when ya see me on the scene, gon'
Get it in like a double shift worker, girl 
Stack yo' cheese like a double cheesburger, ayy!

[Chorus]
Is the party gon' end? NO!
Might be three, might be fo' 
If I cain't drink, then I cain't go 
This song got e'rybody on the flo'
T! T! Wired to the T!
T! T! Wired to the T!
T! T! Wired to the T!
T! T! Wired to the T!

[Verse 2wo]
Mo'! Mo'! we want mo'! 
If we cain't drink, den we cain't go
If they gon' hate, then let dem know 
I slide me a hater like a patio door
Off in my zone, already gone
One, two, three, fo' shots to the dome 
Now I'm drunk, got lil' mama crunk, tell 'er 
(Shake it, shake it, shake it!)
Miss Junk-in-the-Trunk so crunk 
'Cause I'm outta dere befo' I even walk through the do' 
And you know a nigga gone when he walk up to a hoe 
like, "Excuse me miss, I ain't tryna be funny 
Let me beat dat pussy like it owed me money, ayyy!"

[Chorus]

[Break]
I got liquor in my body, liquor-liquor in my body
Liquor-liquor in my body, I-I got-I got
Liquor in my body, liquor-liquor in my body
Liquor-liquor in my body, I-I be-I be
Runnin through these hoes like I'm Tony Dorsett
Runnin-runnin through these hoes like I'm Tony Dorsett
Yeah, my whole clique fly like the New York Jets
We be runnin through these hoes like I'm Tony Dorsett

(T beat drop!) 
Yo, say, this the part where you walk to lil' mama like 
"Girl you fine! (Eyy!) Girl you fine! (Eyy!) 
and after this song, I'ma make you mine, heyy!"

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
