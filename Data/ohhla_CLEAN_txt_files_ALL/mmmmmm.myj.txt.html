Mmmmmmmmmm

[Sunspot Jonz]
Ah .. ah .. ah .. ah
As the morning sun shines, and the smoke starts to climb
From dirty rat-filled gutters I'm hittin' snooze for the fifth time
My shutters cover the aluminum-foil windows
My room's cluttered with pennies and nickels
Too little to call it dough
I always wait twenty-five minutes after it's time to go
Before I actually get ready to go
In a crowd I smoke too slow
But when I smoke alone I smoke too fast
Broke 'cause I spent too much cash
On weed; you know we all go on our own crusade
Hey, take the lead, and we're all still in the same
Too many ways to peel a potato
Vodka mixed with Clamato
To the head primate-o
Like Being John Malkovich, possessed
And you got no
Control of your actions so
You're just a loaded gun, waiting to blow
Waiting to blow, waiting to show
That you got a soul
But don't nobody know

Mmmmmmmmmm [This is cowboy shit. Yee-ha!] [Check. Yes.]

[PSC]
Look
Big-ass T.V. in my livin' room
No beatdies in my livin' room
Live in a hotel room, the room I consume
By the rap-like tattoos, alcohol and 'shrooms
Doomed relationships down on rossi (???) with some booms
Out of tune
My old-school friends don't keep in touch
The custody of a child, broken cycle, have nothin'
Or pretend when I wake up I'm spreadin' my wings
Keep the house clean and do anything that I wish
My only wish is this [What?]
Make music with my friends and have healthy families and shit
Did I say shit? [That's right]
[Shit .. uh, yeah]

[Grouch]
What happens when you can't stop yourself, restart it
Mark it on your calendar to reform, 'cause you know you've been
actin' retarded
You need to be reborn, and you're aware of that
Fightin' with yourself over how you're unprepared to act
And how you are
Change is hard
It takes a lot of effort
And you've got to let down your guard [Let it down]
But you're scarred from letdowns in life
Barely believin' in you
Tryin' to reason, but it's like even when you freak it
You go back on old ways
You trip for whole days at a time, times ten
And you gotta begin again
It's like a lottery for you to win [Yeah]
Easier to sin
So you fall in a rut
Stallin'
But your gut feeling tells you it'll be cool [It'll be alright]
Somehow, someway
You're gonna pull through [You will]
You're gonna pull through [Right]

Mmmmmmmmmm

[Scarub]
The older I get, the more set in my ways
My momma says it's more than just a phase
It's a way of life
A way of living
A way of giving what you  have
While you travel on your path on this planet
I'ma either blow up or just bust
Whichever way, I'ma explode
Be heard
From the inner-city curbs to the suburbs
I got a lot to say
Priceless persuasions, gorgeous generalizations
???? invitations and marvelous manipulation
I way to ???? me blazin'
I was made for raisin' what's new
I'm only one, but when I come it's for true
The older I get, the more set in my ways
I'm set in my ways, set in this world ablaze
Steadily risin' [Steadily risin']
I'm steadily risin' [Steadily rise]
I'm set in my ways [Set in my ways]

Mmmmmmmmmm [Set in my ways] [Steadily risin']

So ends a chapter
In the Legendary book called Life
Now if you didn't understand that, meet me on page forty-six
Just kidding
Hooo-oooo
