Yeah, yo
Even though my dream of touchin the sky, amongst the stars has died
I'm still alive, cigarette in the jaws is lit
The fire burnin inside, personal hell
was stoked in Rocket Town, place I work and I dwell
Was hopin for support, hoping for the President's word
For Shinra to give me more funds to manage my bird
The Tiny Bronco; but, while hagglin the head honcho
this emo kid and his friends jacked my ride, oh no
I chased 'em down pronto, hop on the plane
with a feelin that my girl will never do it again
I was right, it was shot down, I'm lookin at this Cloud clown
Thinkin that he gonzoe berzerk, this jerk is just desert
and I'm about to chow down but, after the story I hear
about the end of the world approachin near
we converge paths, the world's dead on arrival
of the Meteor, we gotta stick together for survival
I need some materia for weapon material
Hijacked the Highwind then scratched off the serial
Lose Cloud now I'm in charge, no half steppin
Find Cloud, in the fallout of loosed weapons
Find out that Shinra is loadin up a rocket
to attack the meteor with materia gotta stop it
Reach space lookin around, my jaws gape
I escape in an oxygen pod to save the race</pre>
