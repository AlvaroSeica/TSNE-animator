Song:   Killing Time
Typed by: @Oddisee

PG raised Me, DC made, NY paid me all around the globe
my crew crazy, do it on a daily
what's that, hustle, y'all already know
I be on the grind like I'm running out if time
but I'm doing what I love so the clock move slow
murder isn't a crime when you're just killing time, go
Grew up on that rap-a-lot
grew up on that native tongues
beats be like I trap allot, rhymes like all I say son
that's DC though, we made them one, that's 95 north &amp; south
in the middle of the drive where I reside is what I'm talking about
let's take a ride, walk about let's take a ride
where I learned to rhyme these learned niggas to aim
we target minds we target brains
&amp; we grip the chrome, be a microphone
or that other thing it be all the same
allot of rappers came allot of
rappers left &amp; the possessions stayed see when into theft
no referees &amp; that call was made
all that balling's played &amp; we intercept
&amp; hand the drink tickets to my niggas in club
cause I don't sip nothing unless it's coming in mug
no I ain't without a vice, always doing what you like got a
price to quite like any other drug
no I didn't go to Howard &amp; I never wished I had
no I wasn't on the ave &amp; I wasn't in a class
but I was in a lab turning music into math
in the dorm rooms too &amp; I
ain't never have a pass
where 16th &amp; Euclid meet, high fructose she super sweet in Tenley
town Maggiano's then Georgetown for the movie seat
This new school &amp; that old too eating
organic with a gold tooth
getting ignorant like no school
thought the world I'm, exposed too
PG raised Me, DC made, NY paid me all around the globe
my crew crazy, do it on a daily
what's that, hustle, y'all already know
I be on the grind like I'm running out if time
but I'm doing what I love so the clock move slow
murder isn't a crime when you're just killing time, go
Woke up out in Moscow, fell asleep in reckjevic
wrote that verse while on the plane
tell your man to send the check
drive me to my hotel, make a beat along the way
been put that in your Dropbox, why you take so long to pay
wrote a song at sound check, interviews before the stage
that's two countries, beats &amp; rhymes, one show, a normal day
what you call a hustle I call rest time
your deadline pushed &amp; I need lest time
I'm a man of the stars, relativity is law
me &amp; Einstein learned how to stretch time
science only answers how, religion only answers why the
two combined is the true design respect to God cause he drew the lines
I'm tracing paper, I'm chasing paper
the world is c.re.a.m &amp; I'm going green
ultra violets hit my eyelids, lime light
tanning on the scene
my skin is bronze like Jesus feet
my hair is wool my fleece is sheep
the skully's off &amp; the album's
&amp; I'm ahead releasing heat
like all the time, in the world I've got
no clock to watch, no need to speed
I don't ask for it, I take my time
&amp; I want more than I could ever need</pre>
