[Boots Riley]
Sassy!!

Coked out is the new tipsy
Tracy Morgan's the new Nipsey
Skinny jeans are the new fashion
But none of that shit fits me
Weed smoke is the new incense
Two bucks is the new 10 cents
Three strikes is the new lynchin
Buyin is the new rentin
These lines are new Molotovs
Right now there's a new holocaust
More troops is the new call it off
I'm tryin to pry this collar off
Hip-Hop is the new rock now
Curfews are the new lockdown
Gunshots are the new cricket chirps
Let's flip this shit top down

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Fuckin is the new "Hey how do ya do?"
And revolution is the new "Fuck you!" (The new "Fuck you!")

[Boots Riley]
Sassy!!

Flag waving's the new zeig heil
Do nothing's the new denial
Torture is the new torture
We'll all walk that +Green Mile+
The dope spot's the new factory
+Nip/Tuck+ is the new quackery
Handguns are the new switchblades
And freedom's the new fantasy
"Get a room" is the new "get a home"
Low income's the new hella po'
Phone sex is now group sex
There's feds on yo' telephone
"Take care" is the new health care
Big business gets welfare
The Middle East is the new goldrush
We've made a new hell there~!!

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
The new fuck you! {*4X*}

{*Tom Morello solo*}

[Boots Riley]
These lines are new Molotovs
Right now there's a new holocaust
More troops is the new call it off
I'm tryin to pry this collar off
Hip-Hop is the new rock now
Curfews are the new lockdown
Gunshots are the new cricket chirps
Let's flip this shit top down

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
