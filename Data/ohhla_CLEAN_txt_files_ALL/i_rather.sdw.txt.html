* Beyoncé ad-libs "oh, baby" during all verses and the intro

[Intro: Specman]
I know I fucked up, I always fuck up
This time I fucked up for real though
Can you just listen? Just listen...
Yo, just try to calm down, you hear me?

[Specman]
Aiyo, it's chilly up north, it's snowing outside
I'm clearing my eyes, and lowering my vibes
This is make or break, gotta survive
Every move I make, I gotta stay alive
Handcuffed to guys, I never seen befo' in my life
Prison guards is screaming "Strip and squat", they're stealing my pride
My spirit inside, an all time low, I need you tonight, I need you to fight
And three hundred and sixty-five days after that until I take flight

[Chorus: Beyoncé (Specman)]
I'd rather be with you
Cuz I love the way, you scream my name
(Even after all I put you through?)
There's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
(I can understand but I put you through a lot)
I'd rather be with you
Cuz you hustle hard, to take care of me
(That's why I'm out there on the grind, that's why I'm out on the block)
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you, you know, I'd rather be with you
(And I'd rather be with you, you know that)
Boy, I'd rather be with you... ha, ha, ha, ha... yeaaaaaaah

[Specman]
Through the struggles, now we back on top, I'm back on the block
I'm North Yard repping on some Fantom tracks, check my stock
Shadow Government's (Shadow!) the hottest and we can't be stopped
Guess what that means for you, boo? You worry not
I know it's cool, you'd rather be with me, I'd rather be with you
But it's the things that I do, I do it all for you
Hopping in Coupes, shopping and drop loot
Atlantic City, fifty on it, yo, you always come through
Get 'em, girl!

[Chorus: Beyoncé (Specman)]
I'd rather be with you
Cuz I love the way, you scream my name
(Even after all I put you through?)
There's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
(I can understand but I put you through a lot)
I'd rather be with you
Cuz you hustle hard, to take care of me
(Yo, we moving up in the world, girl)
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you, you know, I'd rather be with you
(And I'd rather be with you, you know that)
Boy, I'd rather be with you... ha, ha, ha, ha... yeaaaaaaah...

[Break: Beyoncé (Specman)]
I'd rather be with you... well... yeah...
(Yeah, I'd rather be with you, too, girl)
Boy, I'd rather be with you...
(All those cold up north visits)
I'd rather be with you... well... yeah...
(All that standing on the package line, bringing me thirty-five pounds)
Boy, I'd rather be with you, I'd rather be with, rather be with you
(I never forgot none of that, girl)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'd rather be with you
Cuz I love the way, you scream my name (scream it louder, baby)
There's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you
Cuz you hustle hard, to take care of me...</pre>
