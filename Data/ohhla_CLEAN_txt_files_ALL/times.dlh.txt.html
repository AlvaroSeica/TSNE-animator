[Verse 1]
I've often wondered how long it's gonna take me
In this world until the good Lord shake me
And to the man I put up with mad sorrow
But I learned soon the sun still shines tomorrow
Sometimes bad thoughts they brought me down
Growin up hard livin' poor side of town
Cause where I was I wondered who will ever need me?
But now I know that much love flew freely
My momma my poppa both took care
No matter what I did I knew they would be there
Ball in the school yard puppy love crushes
Mischief in the nightime with intimate touches
Playin' with the females Christmas was cool
Didn't have much but had enough fool
So here's three cheers beers up and take a chug
Cause this one's for all the past times I dug

[Chorus]
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
Even though most of all my life was bad
I reminisce on all the good times I had
So if you think all of your life was bad
Reminisce on all the good times you had

[Verse 2]
Well it was once upon a time in the seventies a baby boy bounces
Placed on this earth wayin' seven and some ounces
But that wasn't all of the bouncin'
It was hard for mom to try to keep the proper housin'
Straight from Gardena before my sista Linda
Migrated to the East Side projects Maravilla
There I had my stroll on Rigin' Elementary
Moms a quarter century pop left us on empty
But that was nothin' new though packin up our shit so
We could make the move Cudahay was the zip code
Moms working fingers to the bone just to make ends meat
I was a latch key delinquent daily runnin' the street
And every time I look back I think of just anotha challenge
Holidays and birthdays grim still I managed
To key a smile making life fun
And how can I forget about the seasons in the sun?
So here's three cheers beer up and take a chug
Cause this one's for all the past times I dug

[Chorus]</pre>
