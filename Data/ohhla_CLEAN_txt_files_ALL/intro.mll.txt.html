Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, it's alot of bad bitches in the building, Amen
Came in the game killing niggaz, J-Len
When it come to winning I'm on some shit I'm prolly 8 in
And I got that four door Aston Martin on the way in
Ya'll niggaz come out, all the hoes stay in
Every time I come out, movie in the making
Realest nigga in it all you gotta do is say it
If a nigga rap dissing, when I see him Imma spray em like
Bang, nigga ain't no game, Philly niggaz ain't the same
Step in your lane, before that choppa hit your brain
Stay out the frame, cause when I land that Bada-Boom
That's bada-bang, pussy nigga
Ahhh, right back like I never left
Rollie on my wrist cost a Camaro yeah the double S
Ever since I made a milli I ain't been in trouble yet
Still walk in the building and go bonkers with a hundred racks
Hundred Stacks, Hell Yeah, Hell Yeah Fucking Right
Boy I got your favorite singer really tryna fuck tonight
Ya'll niggaz was sleeping on me, I was really up at night
Tryna chase my dream, now I'm balling up on my team
And I lean off in this phantom, Imma boss my anthem
The MMG my click, that's why your bitch all on my dick
I got 30 racks in my pocket, I keep 30 shots in my click
I get 30 racks for my verses, ya'll ain't getting paper like this (NO!)
I'm getting money, must be Illuminati
They think I signed up, cause I just bought a new Ferrari
And when I make a 100 I'mma buy a new Bugatti
I be with some Philly niggaz they just tryna shoot somebody
Tell em, I swear I try to tell em'
Right here in this Pen-house, I started from the cellar
And if she want that hammer all up in her I'mma nail her
Word to my nigga Ricky, we gon kill the game this Summer (AH)</pre>
