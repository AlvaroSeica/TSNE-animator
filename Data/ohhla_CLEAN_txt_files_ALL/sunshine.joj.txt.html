[Chorus: Sample] + (JoJo Pellegrino)
You are the sun and the shine
Clouds like in the wind (this heat don't ever go away)
You are the sun and the shine
Clouds like in the wind (on the come up day to day)
You are the sun and the shine
Clouds like in the wind (you look up to him and you say)
You are the sun and the shine
Clouds like in the wind

[JoJo Pellegrino]
It's like everything revolves around me
Burning bright, morning to night regardless
Straight fire, shed em with heat and leave them in darkness
Sunshine, thats how it stays even when skies' grey
Stuck in my feet, thats over your head like 'have a nice day'
This summer I'm torching the burbs, scorching the ghetto
Fresh out the winter wall like 'fuck you lookin at, thought I was yellow'
In the same place I'm starting, even though I'm constantly moving
Thats the ultimate mind boggling illusion, causing confusion
Lit the game up, early, heads was sleepin, now they wake up
Only to watch me raise up, get the temperature baked up
Incidently yo, infinatly glow, rappers insullently flow
Disrespectfully so, intellectually slow
Indirectly trow words together and speak them, couldn't freak em
Spitting, never grow, comin up short like kids in ????
Tell em though, son Pelle blow, it's destined though
Guess its in my head to hold it down, couldn't let it go
The sun shines

[Chorus]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
No doubt the sun shines
I walk the path less traveled, CMO, one of a kind
Squinting's instant to peeps, sun when it shines
My daily grind is amongst the grime and crime
Peace to heads thats doing time
Who's world is this? This world is mine, fine
Sun keep it hot, they can't spit it, this line for line
Ain't no dim in this light of mine
Look up to it, stare and you go blind
See my existence is a question of itself, so I explore the game
Build with great minds, search for answers you can't find
Plus my thoughts is hidden treasures and forbidden deserts
When the stars alive, project the underground glow of a gold mine
Trigger wicked ways, ultraviolent written rays
Burn u from a distant range, fry when I send em with dope rhymes
See the Earth needs me, provide me with warmth for life of motion
Look, wet up a sauna or strick a ocean, flows prime
Prepare for the moment of blackness, envision sun eclipse
The hits, I have em in prison, like yo, it's Jo's time
Sunshine
