Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily shine
Ikon the fucking Hologram
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Ikon the Hologram]
Another sacrificial lamb
That died at the hands of Hologram
Sent him into the dungeon and bludgeoned his fuckin' clan
Holy land
Who spit the live shit
The do or die, Illadelph Jedi Mind shit
The hot shit
Live raps crack your jaw
Like who's the avenger and who's at the center of war
I left a scar
So your crabs would understand
Mental will dent you and send you to a holy land
Lord know a man
Sharp blades slash your vitals
Recitals will fight you and entice you to burn Bibles
Homicidal
Hologram burn churches
Murders by stickin' a crucifix through your cervix
Divine purpose, for the Remi that's in my thermos
Wait and see we'll stick you with needles that's hypodermic
You heard the verdict
I'm with Allah 'cause he chose me
Broke into the Vatican, strangled the Pope with his rosary
What, what, what

[Chorus repeat 4x]
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily shine in '99
What, what

[Just Allah]
MC's face terror wherever my sound's audible
Banned from third world portals, battle mortals, and slaughter you
Seen inside the places of beyond
The dwellings of the Omn
Existing in Islamic pantheon
Flows got the breeze on my clothes got the scent of trees
I lay back and blow sax like Kenny G
Power blast wacking my path devour fast
I leave you with the grain of sand in life's hourglass
Devise your spell
Make demons rise out of hell
Grab you by your lapels and rob you of your outer shell
You feel the ill dire who sire in hellfire
I launch writers
Put your drawn on gong's wire
Jedi swordsman give rappers a foul fortune
Science to contortion your body into a coffin
Insane damage is done, you fuckin' with the army
We beat skulls in the shape of a wet bag of laundry
What, yeah, yeah

[Chorus repeat 4x]

[Ikon] Yo, the gods around, the dramatarzan
[Jus Allah] Your feel poetic, law of the titans
[Ikon] We like a fuckin' bolt of lightning
[Jus Allah]The three wise men
[Ikon] We at levels that defies men
[Jus Allah] Watch out for fake heads deviled disguised men
[Ikon] Arriving from the dawn and spawned with ill forms
[Jus Allah] Battle leave you dead in the balm like stillborns
[Ikon] The master herein
[Jus Allah] The ominous, the master spirit
[Ikon] Can't understand the language of rappers with bad lyrics
[Jus Allah] Ikon the python
[Ikon] Rappers are left strangled
[Jus Allah] I overlook the Earth 'cause I see it from sun's angle
[Ikon] Above the clouds
[Jus Allah] We sit high and we daze, write a page, on how you enslave the worldly way
[Ikon] Islamic marksmen
[Jus Allah] Seeing the squad then...
[Ikon] ... could be your fatal mistake
[Jus Allah] Like the first sins of Adam in the garden
[Ikon] You feel sorrow, our projected is gone Apollo
[Jus Allah] Explore realms, you left too confused to follow
[Ikon] Invite your town to absorb the sniper rounds
[Jus Allah] Illadelph, Shamballah, nigga stayin' underground
What! Mothafuckers!

[Chorus repeat 4x]
