"I got the funk flow to make you... make you kidney SHIFT	|

[Verse 1: Trials]
Give me a stage
A mic, three pints of dope nector
The name's Trials baby, professional home wrecker
I got this licence to step inside ciphers
And come tighter than vaginas with four fingers inside 'em
So step to a battle, but take the cowards route
I'ma power house destroying rhymes until the power's out
What the fuck made you think that these toys were dope?
I was flippin' twice as nice before my VOIce had broke
You better gift-wrap my nuts, suck the shaft to the bottom
When I'm rocking mics random lives just start dropping
We're top of this shit like garnishes, every time I test ya
You're like fat chicks on a jetty - UNDER PEER PRESSURE
Try your heart out, become a dope rapper
I'ma still die hard like overdosing on Viagra
Now that's what happens when the Funkoars rip ya
We stomp the break, and shake your place is richter

[Chorus #1: Trials (+Oars)]
If your name's Mila Kunis
(You're getting kidney shifted)
After ten rounds of schooners
(You're getting kidney shifted)
Blonde girls with fake hooters
(You're getting kidney shifted)
(You're getting kidney shifted) (*You're getting kidney shifted*)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sesta]
Check it, when I'm live on the mic
Replies are about as tight as a hooker on a loooooong night
Your verses post-mortem
Battle Funkoars then you might as well release Martin Bryant and live the battle!
Semi-autos - cos we at it again
The crowd we packing 'em in while you panicking friend
So take your man and make like a manakin
SHUT THE FUCK UP, sit down, don't talk (don't move)
Shake it like your mothers arm after she's waving me
late in the morning, after I double dated her with your sister
Say Sesta eventually - got sick of faggots having to mention me
Man I could sit and babble about back stabbers and faggots
Spitting them ones, tag-alongs think they're rappers
If I'ma rapper who claims he's ahead of his time
Well fuck it - I'm going back to the future and racking his rhyme

[Chorus #2: Sesta (+Oars)]
If your name's J. Lopez
(You're getting kidney shifted)
If you don't deep throat then
(You're getting kidney shifted)
Even over phone sex you're
(You're getting kidney shifted)
(You're getting kidney shifted)
(You're getting kidney shifted) (*You're getting kidney shifted*)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hons]
Fuck the weesle in my books, it's pop goes the virgin
Get trashed and crash strip clubs instead of rehearsin'
My flow worsening the more schooners I have
I'd rather be boozing than rap and kick losers off tracks
So pump your fists if you feel this
Hons will show Christina how to get dirty in a film clip
I bomb tracks like Pearl Harbour
Sometimes people take it the wrong way like smacking up marijuana
Hard on that and throw your best raps and mack kid
There's no turning back like knocking up a catholic
I need to keep my raps tight like gaps that's slight
Or Joe Cusumano on a honeymoon night
I like to roll play with fantasies, get kinky with our bed
Long legs, thick breasts, I'm as shallow as Hals head
Think you're better than me? Fucking get your facts checked
I ain't hostile, I just sit there when I got no cash left

[Chorus #3: Hons (+Oars)]
If your name's Kylie Minogue
(You're getting kidney shifted)
If you bite when you blow
(You're getting kidney shifted)
Babies sitting home alone
(You're getting kidney shifted)
(You're getting kidney shifted)
(You're getting kidney shifted) (*You're getting kidney shifted*)
