[Intro]
Yeah... RAPPER! Okay... 
I guess it's time for me to talk my shit, huh?
That's what they wanna hear, dunny?
Heh, okay..Yo...

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Mr. So Ravishing, borderline arrogant
Mix and match flows, you can call it an experiment
Out of shape, gettin bent, cynics, I don't pay a cent
You checkin lines nigga, mine's been 'travagant
My mic's sacrament, rbeak you down to increments
Have you seein double like them twins to experiment
The plan I implement, contingent on my temperament
Stay on my grind like a knee missing ligaments
Doper than, all of you niggas, that's what I really meant
We can save us both time in your embarrassment
Out your element, boy, the daily regiment
Got me really doin what the rest of y'all embellishing
I heard you sick of rap, Rapper got the medicine
That's the light comin on, Con Edison
For Members Only is the label that I represent
and do remember that I'm comin for them presidents

[Chorus: DJ cuts and scratches] 
"Ra-Rapper got the medicine" 
"a-a-and do remember that I'm comin for them presidents"
"Rapper got the me- em eht - got the medicine"
"a-a-and, and do remember that I'm comin for them presidents
"Rapper got, Ra-Ra-Rapper got..."
"Got me really doin what the rest of y'all embellishing"
"Rapper got the me- Rapper got the medicine"
"and do remember that I'm comin for them presidents"

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Mr. Irresistible, critically acclaimed
Collide with the bars, it'll leave your brain critical
Amazing individual, don't compare me to the miniscule, dude
I shut it down on straight principle
Crazy what the kid can do, can't nobody picture you
Test me with the lyrical, the word play is biblical
Magna cum laude, you still playin middle school
Frontin like you want it, dude, decision gettin ridicule
Watch me take it to another altitude, fool!
My shit is so dope, I turn bitches into muse
Sittin by the pool, Rapper Pooh is interviewed
Drop a couple jewels, I'm the element of cool
Don't let the blog bother me, they over-analytical
Hip-hop'll never be the same with gettin cynical
Tell it like it is, ain't no need to be political
Word to de Chirico, the art is metaphysical, UHH~!</pre>
