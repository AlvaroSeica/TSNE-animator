[Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, uhh
I'm not a 2-2, I'm a turbo
Hater pray to God that I turn slow
Like I'm sippin on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Tryin to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was somethin I had to work fo'
But, that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect but lose all my worth, no
You can dead that, here the hearse go
Don't need 48, you'll find a killer in the first flo'
It was me boy, the commercial
is feelin out of place like PETA at a fur sto'
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn though
Said that I blew/blue her like turquoise
Just mad, hear it all in your word choice
Know it hurts but I really don't care though
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that hoooooe

[Chorus: MDMA]
I can see the morning creepin upon us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy
Crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now!
(I, don't wanna care, don't wanna care, right now)
I don't wanna care right now - I don't wanna care right now!
(I, don't wanna care, don't wanna care, right now)
No I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't
No I really don't care now

[Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh-uhh, Go-Go-God over everythang-thang
You fly but stars over everythang-thang
And I'm one of them, yeah I'm one of the-the-them
Oh I'm not o-o-one? Well I'm a hundred the-the-then
I'm a hundred mother-lovin stars
You're no lights, you're an undercover car
I'm an ambulance, and a fire truck
And some strobe lights, tied up
Shinin all in your eyes
All out of yours and all into mines
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feelin like Malcolm lookin all at the blinds
Any means, any means
And you can't do anything, anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans, skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Phillipines, Phillipines
Hahhhhh!

[Chorus]

[Lupe - over Chorus]
No I really don't
No I really don't, no I really don't
No I really don't, no I really don't

[Lupe Fiasco]
You don't know only a little, I'm the Lupe
Yes sir - who they?
They yester', and I'm today
And tomorrow, hoo-ray!
Can I get a hip-hip for the new K-I-N-G
Nigga I am HE
Got the game in a clutch like I and she
You ball little boy but I NBA
With a handful of world
You a boy band with a dance and a twirl
I'm a rock star with a band so thorough
Big ass tour bus that's jammed full of girls
T-t-tell 'em what it do
H-h-holla from the bottom, y-y-yellin from the roof
T-t-t-tell 'em what it do
I don't care about your curfew, I'll tell you when I'm through BWOI!

[Chorus]

[Lupe - over Chorus]
No I really don't, no I really don't
No I really don't care now
No I really don't, no I really don't
No I really don't care now

[Lupe Fiasco]
Tell 'em what it do, yellin from the bottom, yellin from the roof BWOI!
Tell 'em what it do, holla from the bottom, yellin from the roof BWOI! {*3X*}

[Outro: MDMA]
I don't wanna... I-I don't wanna...
I-I-I-I don't wanna, c-c-care-care right
Care-care-care right now!
I don't wanna... I-I don't wanna...
I-I-I-I don't wanna, c-c-care-care right
Care-care-care right now!</pre>
