[Trey Songz]
Trey Songz - ay, I'ma make you a star girl
Ay (this is a DJ Finesse exclusive) I'ma make you a star girl
Ay, ay, ay, I'ma make you a star girl
I'ma make you a star girl

You've got that thang in yo' eyes, it's somethin 'bout you
The perfect height, perfect size, I'd like to sign you
The TV screen, magazines, are waitin on you
Girl you can be in King, XXL, Elle, Vogue
(Dee-jay, Fineese) You can be the centerfold

[Interlude]
Red carpet, flashin Lights
Shoppin with chauffered rides
Just come with me tonight
This gon' be your life

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you a star (bet, bet)
Bet I can take you far (and, they)
They gonna know who you are (uh, uh)
Startin tonight, girl you gon' shine

[Trey Songz]
I can see you now on the billboard
Showin your body-ody-ody chicks would kill for
Tell me what I gotta do to make this deal ma
Writing for you, here's what I'll do girl
I'll, give you a place to live
You can, you can stay at my crib
You can, you can sleep in my bed
Make love like you've never did (DJ Finesse)

[Interlude] + [Chorus] {*to fade*}
