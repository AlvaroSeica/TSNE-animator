{I love champagne}  Feels good to my brain, baby ... (Yeah, come on, yeah)
{I love champagne}  Drink it in the rain, yeah ... (In the rain!)
{I love champagne}  Say it once again, yeah ... (Once again!)
{I love champagne}  Hoooo ... (Sing!)

Singer:
Nigga, I'm broke, and feelin' kinda thirsty (Drink somethin')
Just smoked a blunt, and I feel the worst-y (Take some medicine)
My baby's father brought me a case of St. Ide's (Too bad)
I said, "I don't drink that shit, nigga, you better recognize!" (I recognize)
Now I'm a broke hoe with expensive tastes (We can tell that)
I got six ankle chains around my waist (Delta phony gold!)
Gotta get my sip on {sip on} cause that's my missi-on {Missi-on}
Gotta get my champagne on, or I'm gonna get my bitch on {Yeah}

(Shake the glass, shake the glass.  
 Shake the glass, shake the glass.)
{I love champagne}  Feels good to my brain, baby ... 
(Shake the glass, shake the glass.  
 Shake the glass, shake the glass.)
{I love champagne}  Drink it in the rain, yeah ... 
(Shake the glass, shake the glass.  
 Shake the glass, shake the glass.)
{I love champagne}  Say it once again, yeah ... 
{I love champagne}  Hoooo ... (Black Boy!)

Singer:
Donna Karan, Versace (I know), 
Doce cellular phone (Yeah, I love you too, baby)
I'd trade my welfare and food stamps for a bottle of Dom (Yeahh!)
See I like Moet, Chen-Don, whatever that means 
(It means ... I don't know)
I can drink it without snails but prefer it with greens 
(What about chitlin's?)
Now coke costs too much (No it don't), 
and crack gives me gas (Oo, that's nasty)
But if you give me champagne, I'll give you this black aaaass ... 
(Already had it!)

[Spoken] You wanna give me what I NEED, baby!  (No I don't!)  
         I want the lucci, the Lex, AND the bigets!  (You can't have it!)
         And don't forget to Bring the Pain!  (I got it!)  The CHAMpagne!

{I love champagne}  Feels good to my brain, baby
 ... (I know you do, you alcoholic!)
{I love champagne}  Drink it in the rain, yeah
 ... (You need to go to rehab!)
{I love champagne}  Say it once again, yeah
 ... (Drink it dry y'all, drink it dry!)
{I love champagne}  Once again
 ... (Ladies and gentlemen, Kool Rock Ski!)
