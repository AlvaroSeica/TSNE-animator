[Chorus]
Too much for money
Too much for cars
Too much for hoes
Too much for clothes
Too much for bar
Too much for clubs
Too much for thugs
Too much for drugs
Too much for much
Too much for love
Too much for haters
Too much for players
Too much for gators
Too much for paper
Too much for favors
Too much for saws
Too much for laws
Too much for raws
Too much for brawls
Too much for y'all

[Verse 1: Kwajo]
Breakdown niggas, run through niggas
Stay comin' through with my 7 Bills niggas
Make mad figures, my thugs pull triggers
Leave 'em with the cash and the stash, quick niggas
All day everyday
We do or die, serious
Pass up in the cut, these haters keep get in touch
Zig-Zag to Dutch, livin' it up
G.C., 7 Bills what?
Sharpen the cut

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Dolo]
My nigga pump all night
Do the goonin' all night
Bag a trick that blow dick
And twist that bitch all night
Got my ring, chain-swings
We got the drop word-life
Hamela, Hannibal cop
Put that in your pipe
The tough diaras mazara rap don't concern me
We cut your Beef Jerkey, Cold Turkey
Presedential, Oyster Iceberg jersey
Whatchu got ain't worthy
Four 50's, need a shift
Swallow your derby nigga
We...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kwajo]
Yo the 7 Too Much were just too dangerous
We Off-The-Hook, we balterbus, all murderous
Outta the blue, get swept like Typhoon
Top 'coons, killin' these fools with brand new tunes
Ladies shake the middle (What?)
Fellas throw your guns up
Strictly thumbs up, when we come you get duffed up
Cuffed up, roughed up, 7 Bills, nigga what?
9-9, tucci, we erupt, just too much

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Dolo]
To all my Porto Rocks and Ice Cubans who lick shots
My Dominicans, makin' them ends and don't stop
To my stone-cold niggas who controllin' the blocks
And all my stone-cold bitches never blowin' up spots
I put it down for y'all
Let off a rhyme for y'all
Knowin', too much for much, but I'ma pound for y'all
Never see me at the Bar, got that Crown Royal
How that sound?
Mow y'all, everybody get ball, c'mon

[Chorus]</pre>
