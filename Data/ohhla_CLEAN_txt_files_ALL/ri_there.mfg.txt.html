[Verse 1]
Going around, running mouth, what he gonna do to me
Like murder's something new to me
Don't know who he's fucking with, here come a homicide
Test me with drama, why that nigga try?
I don't never hide, I accommodate
Good day to die, any place and date
I was calm when I asked him why he wronged me
The nigga wild out, got Nino Brown on me
Kindness for weakness, when on the phone
Nigga think I'm soft or something, hearing his tone
I keep two things, a gun and a plan
I'm not stable and he don't understand
Yap yap yap yap, let him talk shit
Take him to war, time to load the clips
Think that he's safe, creeping on his block
Pop pop pop pop, watch the nigga drop right there

[Chorus]
It's time to clear the block out
It's time to clear the block
It's time to clear the block out
It's time to clear the block
It's time to clear the block out
It's time to clear the block
It's time to clear the block out
It's time to clear the block

[Verse 2]
I know I'm Hell bound, cause of choices
New beginning man, I'm hearing voices
Back to Son of Sam, when it come to bread
Gotta brick of girl, killing cokeheads
Smack the ave with it, leave the streets red
Yellow taped off, here come feds
Brother from the way, today he lucked up
Asked to help him out, cause he's fucked up
So I gave him work, want my income
Motherfucker told me, take it back in blood
That fucked me up, thought we were cool
Disrespect trust, broke all the rules
Yap yap yap yap, let him talk shit
Take him to war, time to load the clips
Think that he's safe, creep through his block
Pop pop pop pop, watch the nigga drop right there

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In rap game thought shit'll be safe
You'd be surprised how many get chased
Wheelchair shit, yep put you in the line
Think shit's sweet kicking verse about spine
Because you have fans that like to sweat you
Like I won't come and get you (Nigga)
Put on the internet, that I threatened you
But Google can't save you
I don't give a fuck, go tell police
That won't stop me, you better call the priest
Snatch your life, I'm a thief, move quick
Scream you a tough guy, for you I have a trick
Yap yap yap yap, let him talk shit
Take him to war, time to load the clips
Think that he's safe, creep through his block
Pop pop pop pop, watch the nigga drop right there

[Chorus]</pre>
