Na-na-naaa-naaaa-na-na
Na-na-naaa-naaaa-na-na
Na-na-naaa-naaaa-na-naaaa-naaaa-na-naaa-na-na-na

Chorus:
If I was a Rich Girl na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy giiiiiiirl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy giiiiiiiiirl

[Gwen Stefani]
Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

All the riches baby, won't mean anything
All the riches baby, don't bring what your love can bring
All the riches baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby
Your lovin' is better than gold and I know

[Chorus]
If I was a Rich Girl na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy giiiiiiiiiiiiiirl

I'd get me four Harajuku girls to
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names
Love. Angel. Music. Baby
Hurry up and come and save me

All the riches baby, won't mean anything
All the riches baby, don't bring what your love can bring
All the riches baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby
Your lovin' is better than gold and I know

[Eve]
Come together all over the world
From the hoods to Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up!
What?
(Gwen: Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter) What?

Come together all over the world
From the hoods to Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up
What?
(Gwen: Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter)

What happened to my life? Turned upside down
Chicks that "Blew Ya Mind", DING, it's the second round
(Original track and ting, ohhhh) 
You know you can't buy these things
(NOOOOOOO!!) 
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B, 
I rock the Fetish, people you know who I am!

[Eve and Gwen]
Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't getting nothing but love

[Chorus]
If I was a Rich Girl na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy giiiiiiiiiiiiiirl
