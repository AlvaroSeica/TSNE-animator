[Intro/Chorus]
I know that I neeeeed her
And don't know how to treeeeat her
But you deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
You deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
Though I wanna keeeeep her
Be jealous if she leeeeave, ha
But you deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
You deserve better baby, better baby, better baby
And I can't hold you back baby

[Gucci Mane]
Damn I think I love her but, I don't really know her good
Know I wanna fuck her but, really thinkin if I should
How can I believe her? I don't even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her; I can't even trust myself
But I cain't live alone, at the end of the day can't fuck myself
I told her I'm confused, and she told me to go fuck myself
Now I'm alone in this world, nothin left but me
But I was born all alone, so I guess that's how it's meant to be
But she was sent to me, and I didn't recognize
And I blame it on my pride, on the fact I'm sittin in silence
Eyes redder than a rose, heart bluer than a violet
My heart broke and I'm heartless, and ain't no need to hide it
Gucci

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
A heart breakin is heart broke; I'ma tell the truth cause we grown folks
Why you lookin through my phone fo'? That's why we end up none mo'
You don't know me like John Doe, done left me up in my condo
Looking for you like Waldo, my nose open like Gonzo
I think I love what I don't know, I like her a lot but she loco
She crazy, swagged up, I try to hug her she want mo'
I'm in and out of town all the time, she in and out my mind all the time
I can't lie baby girl stupid fine but I'm out her tush got a stupid grind
She loves me now or she loves me not, treat me cold or she treat me hot
Caramel but not apricot, got one chance won't miss the shot
I know she special - yeah a lot, I know someone might take my spot
Can't lie it may hurt a lot, but does she need the man or not?
