[Intro: Pitbull]
You have to excuse me baby
Go, go, yeah you baby
Back, ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby
Go, go, you groovy baby
Back, let's make a movie baby, time

[Pitbull]
It's Mr. Worldwide, Agent A, reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride
Back, back, in, in, time

[Chorus]
(Baby... ohhh baby)
(Ohhh baby)
(My sweet baby)
(You're the one)

[Pitbull]
Miami equals - black mask, black clothes
with a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts
Black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K
And I wish the whole world would - okay
I'm tryin make a billion out of fifteen cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker, won't cha
give credit where credit is due, don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts, not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
.. Let's save the world
Men in Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement
Ha ha - hey can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si
They can try if they want to
What Pit saws is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts, not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time

[Chorus]
