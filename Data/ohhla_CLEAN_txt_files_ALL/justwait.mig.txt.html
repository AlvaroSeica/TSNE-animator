Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Quavo/Takeoff]
What's up Migos, when a tape gon' drop?
Just wait on it!
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!
Wanna know Migos is you ever gon' go solo?
Just wait on it!
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that I don't know
Just wait on it! [x3]
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that I don't know
Just wait on it! [x3]
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!

[Verse 1: Offset]
These labels keep having debates
We put 'em on hold, tell 'em wait (Hold on!)
Asking me questions like "How did I feel when I had to sit down for a 8?"
They bitin' the swag but we killing these rappers
You wanna rob Migo first place (Number 1!)
Put 'em in a grave, disintegrate (Glaw!)
Blue Benjamins all on my dinner plate
Is Offset ever gonna get on a chorus? (Is he? Huh?)
Just wait on it! (Wait on it!)
I'm your favorite rapper' favorite
Every rapper bite in, they want a taste of it
There is no secret who really created it
I'm on D block, I feel like I'm Jadakiss
Migos blew up like a terrorist
We murdering tracks and it's evident

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
They want me to sign to your label
Told them to wait and they looked at me crazy
Three M&amp;M's ain't shit
No way that we signed, we ripped out the paper
We know that you stealing the fucking flow
It's okay because I got the antidote
We pulling the string like a jump rope
We got the rap game in submission, ho
Came up from a pound of midget now I'm riding around in the 750
Pull up to that bando, just me and extensions
Them pans them pot like business is business
Feeling like summer, Infinity
BOW! GLAW! No witnesses
My niggas been playas like Birdman and Trinidad
None of you rappers can fuck with me, bet on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
So you wanna be in this rap game? (You wanabe?)
First you gotta make a name (TakeOff!)
QC the label they hate on it
The rich niggas too, they gonna wait on it
It's a new generation, OGs like Temptations
Solid Foundation my Margiela looks Mason
My money Caucasian, my dope is Caucasian
My plug is a Haitian so how am I racist?
Like Nike I'm 'bout to start checking you niggas
You Kermit the Frog, I'm dissecting you niggas
You sickle cell nigga, I'm sick of you niggas
You taking my swag, I invented you niggas
Call me Einstein, I got the potion
So I know how to get rid of you niggas
DeNada sneakers, Giuseppe sweater
Stop and say I can do this acapella

[Chorus]</pre>
