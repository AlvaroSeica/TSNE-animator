[ VERSE 1: Ea$y Money ]
Ea$y Money, the track matador
But I don't wave capes at bulls
To murder you lyrically I am cap-a-ble
'sup hater, I see how your face is screwed
How convenient - always been one to play with tools
See, I got the hammer, my squad is nuts
So you better bolt 'fore we wash a nigga up
My dogs I'm in the lab with, makin' wild classics
To pile mad chips, paper like a foul carrot
And to get it we bang-bang with the toaster
Bring ya man with you, aim flame, hit you both up
Main aim is to gain fame and get mo' bucks
Easy, Chilla, my man Slaine from the Coka
Rap dudes ain't fuckin' with that
Make sure we spit that shit till the chips stack quicker
Mama you fly but I can't kick back with ya
But you can hold Dick like you kidnapped Richard

[ CHORUS ]
Ea$y Money Helltown, and you don't stop
Slaine reppin Roslindale, and you don't quit
Chilla Jones Dorchester, and you don't stop
Coke Money Jones, and we're on our own shit

[ VERSE 2: Slaine ]
My habits are bad, my intentions are worse
They criticize my sentences, try to censor my verse
Cause I'm insensitive, they thought I was pensive at first
Like I was Asian, but I'm just more expensive to jerk
I'm feelin caged in like a lion trapped in a zoo
I'm not relyin on what other rappers happen to do
I stick both of my fists in glass, fuckin wrap 'em in glue
If I have to, leave you bleedin while we're laughin at you
But if there ain't a lotta violence then I don't feel at home
Makin Money look Ea$y with enough Dope to Chilla Jones
The eyes of a hawk, heart of a lion, a killer's dome
So many demons in my past, I ain't never feel alone
I got my mind made up, it's fightin in the level
That I took it since I put it on 'The White Man Is the Devil'
What you're lookin at, you're starin at a legend, poppy
It's pretty obvious I got the city locked and you could never stop me

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Chilla Jones ]
You are wild, Slaine, nowadays I'm a vowed name
I brainstorm, let the cloud rain
Ha, we set the standard for lyrical
Cause every 16 is plain nuts like ( ? ) original
Splittin hard, not the one to be pissin off
Listen, I got bars on lock like a prison guard
Are we feudin with beef, yo?
Knock at your door, pop in the four, put two in your peep hole
You wanna battle? Stupid, I beast those
Now you in front of foul lines like you shootin a free throw
East Coast reppin, Beantown violator
I'm on point off top like a skyscraper
Annihilator, you can try, hater
Just push me, the Tec wet pussies like a vibrator
Slaine said body it, hit 'em with cocky shit
Now watch me spit more punches than a Rocky flick
