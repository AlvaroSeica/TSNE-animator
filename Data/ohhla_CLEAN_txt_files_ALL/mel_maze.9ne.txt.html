Yo
What up, sit up, get up wit' us killas
Enough niggaz to crush ya luck and bust ya' guts and liver
Hit with the Ruger and now ya' livin' off in the river
Watchin' this arsonist while a spark a bit
of my heart
and bark Imma start the shit
welcome to the bottomless pit
animalistic
I know its hella dark in it
My world, is not like a regular life
We tote big guns instead of a knife
Hella grim night, the devil is in flight
He said a Beretta will get us whatever is in sight
You gotta job, I ain't got one
You got wad, I gotta shotgun
You gotta guard, I got squad
You here to work I'm here to rob!</pre>
