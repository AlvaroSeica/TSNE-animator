[Hook]
I need you and you need me
We need each other
So let's agree- I'm not complete
The truth is I need you

[Verse One]
Two is better than one- you know that three is a cord
Let's get together and rally around the things of the Lord
Monday, Tuesday- after leaving the doors
Of the church house- when church is out we got a reason to form
A gathering- rather than shooting a breeze at the shore
Our pattern should be gathering to put our knees to the floor
Wednesday, Thursday- this is our season to forfeit
Some of our leisure time just to see Him perform
The wonderful works of our God got to be seated before
Him- I'm talking about community life where we can be strong
That's where we build each other up- because we in a war
And we're scooping the younger saints- just to see them mature
The discipline of discipleship should not be seen as a chore
Even though we (are) seeing them yawn, they seem to be bored
We've been interdependent beings, since seeds to be born
And isolation is not something that we can afford- we need each other

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Before we're found in a hearse- you know we can't be bound to the earth
Now, I know this is kind of home- so I'm sounding berserk
But what I mean is if we're balanced- just as round as the earth
That we can have some casual talk but expound on His worth
Friday- Yahweh gives the power to shirk
The temptation of being idle after hours of work
In the library, my prayer is that we browse through and search
For our spiritual brothers and sisters- blouses and shirts
New friends, new family- gather around the church
Break bread, drink juice or wine and dine as a certain
Way to symbolize our bond as a body- our first
Priority is to love God and out of it's birthed
An affection for one another- we're to challenge and spur
Each other on to love and good deeds- admonishments, hurts
Now cut the superficial talk- let's get down to the dirt
And really help each other change- like what's down in your purse

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Let's greet with a kiss- symbolizing that the breach has been bridged
Multicultural fellowships are distinctive and since
The Roman soldiers drove nails into His feet and His wrists
You know the walls that separated us have ceased to exist
Yes, yes- now there's peace in the midst
And family life is the only way that believers consist
'Cause we can sharpen one another read Ephesians the fifth
Chapter let's sit after service just to sing and uplift
we need each other

[Bridge]
Other, other- brother, brother
Sister, sister- family
Together, together- as one, as one
Let love, let love- knit our hearts</pre>
