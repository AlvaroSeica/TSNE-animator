[Louis Logic - Talking]
Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!
Check it out, check it out!
It's your man, J. Brown
and Louis Logic is in the house!
Yo, come on, bounce! Come on! Bounce! Baby!
Shake your little frame right up outta your blouse!
Bounce, come on, bounce, ladies!
Y'all light up the night when you're out on the town

I thought I had romance, no chance 'till I met you
Right next to my whipper in a fly sweatsuit
Like this was "Boyz N' the Hood" and I'm Tre
You didn't have dishes to do and there was no one home at Grandma's place
I blew kisses to you when I'm on stage
at least I was picturin' you when I blew 'em at that chick with blonde waves
You know, I might have banged her too
but since you wouldn't want AIDS, you should be thankin' Lou
I had a condom on (Hey!)
Girl, I'd rob a bank for you
Catch a shank or two
but I won't treat you like my last girl, I'll never strangle you
You're my angel food and I want my cake and taste it too
So, get straight into your naked suit and your favorite shoes
Not to cheapen our sex life, but I got them tapes of you
and if you leave me the next night, they might turn up on Pay-per-view
Psych! You know I like to play with you
I wouldn't do you wrong 
but if you ever break a date with Lou, I'll screw you in a song

[Chorus: Louis Logic] (*Sung*)
Darlin', when it's for real this how it feel
All my other girlfriends were just practice
Stay on my mind all of the time
Fact is my last chick was nothin' but an actress
Baby, you stole my heart right from the start
I'm tellin' you, your foot would probably fit in Cinderella's shoe
Damn! You went and stole the whole show, now hear the horns go
 Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo

[Louis Logic]
You're the best thing that's happened, girl, the light of my life
Like ya despite the fact we fight every night
While we're wrestling I might get a knife
But just for threatenin'
I wouldn't chance your implants to spring a leak 
I like 'em that size
Girl, you got a little dyke in your eyes
Which is cool, you might be surprised
I like bitches too, not just you
and if you down to knock the boots
Then I found a prostitute who'd love to rock with you tonight if it's cool
Cause I'm in the mood for love or fuckin' some, anyway
And friendship this authentic doesn't come everyday
It's one of the many ways with which I tell you, "I love you"
but sometimes I think it's swell to just fuck you
(Ooooooohhhhh!) Oh, shit! 
Oh, my fault, ladies, this supposed to be a love song, ain't it?
Damn! All right, well, hold up, hold up, I got you, though, for real, check this out
Watch this, yo, yo!

[Chorus: Louis Logic] (*Sung*)
Darlin', when it's for real this how it feel
All my other girlfriends were just practice
Stay on my mind all of the time
Fact is my last chick was nothin' but an actress
Baby, you stole my heart right from the start
I'm tellin' you, your foot would probably fit in Cinderella's shoe
Damn! You went and stole the whole show, now hear the horns go
 Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo

[Louis Logic]
I wanna pledge my love and loyalty to the one who spoils me
rubs and oils me from head to toe, you'd never know I wasn't royalty
(Step one) To let you know how important your heart is
I carved this one from the chest of a farm pig with a sharp BIC razor
(Step two) I'll lay it next to your head
while you're undressed in your bed dreamin' of sex that we've had
(Step three) I'll tether your legs together and tie your hands down
and prance round the room while I pull my bloomers and pants down
Step four, I'll paint a red cross above the headboard
and set forth to bumpin' uglies till your butt gets bed sores
But five is my favorite
My video of the guys that you've laid with gettin' beatin' 'till they lie on the pavement
Now that's romance for ya
when you need to finance lawyers to get Diane Sawyer's lyin' ass off ya
I ain't no wife beater, bitch, I'm in love!
Gimme some room so I can get this blood rinsed from my gloves

[Chorus: Louis Logic] (*Sung*)
Darlin', when it's for real this how it feel
All my other girlfriends were just practice
Stay on my mind all of the time
Fact is my last chick was nothin' but an actress
Baby, you stole my heart right from the start
I'm tellin' you, your foot would probably fit in Cinderella's shoe
Damn! You went and stole the whole show, now hear the horns go
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo, doo

[Louis Logic] + (Charlie Brown)
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you...
("but the rest are doo-doo!")
I'll hold the door and pull out ya chair for you...
("but the rest are doo-doo!")
If you had a fan club I'd be in there too...
("but the rest are doo-doo!") 
Cause you'd love me fat and old or with thin hair, too
I'll squeeze you tighter than a swimwear suit
Yo! Gone!</pre>
