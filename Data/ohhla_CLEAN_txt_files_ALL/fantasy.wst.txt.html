[Nicki Minaj - Intro]
You might think you've peeped the scene, you haven't
The real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiciton
Well gather 'round children - ZIP IT LISTEN!

{"Could we get much higher?"
