(Verse 1)
I just can't do it, not anymore
Everytime I fake a smile
I feel just like a whore
I just can't do it, It's beyond my means
And all i know bout love 
Read in fashion magazines
I just can't do it, it can't be done
That's just what I say 
cuz I know I'm not the one

(Chorus)
I've been moving for so long
My life's a million miles away
And I'm the one that made you strong girl
But I could not make you stay

(Verse 2)
I just can't do it, It's much too hard
I drive around a lonely night 
Up and down the boulevard
I just can't do it, I feel so old
It looks like the sun is shining
But the wind is blowing cold
I just can't do it, It's gone too far
I sit at home alone tonight 
Just wondering where you are

(Chorus)
I've been standing still so long
Mind's a million miles away
And I'm that one that made you strong girl
But I could not make you stay

(Verse 3)
I just can't do it, no matter how hard I try
And you don't come around anymore
But I know the reason why
I just can't do it, it's way too late
I hang on with all my might
I can't accept this fate
I just can't do it, I feel so bad
I sit around and think about
All the chances that I had

(Chorus)
And I've been hurting for so long
You're a million miles away
And I'm the one that made you strong girl
But I could not make you stay

But I could not make you stay
No I could not make you stay</pre>
