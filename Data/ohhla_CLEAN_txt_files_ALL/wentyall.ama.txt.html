[Hook 1: Dr. Ama]
D-R-A-M-A, Cock back aim to spray
Snitch niggas renegade, We pop off
V-R-A-M-A, Got the loaded A.K
Snitch niggas stay away, we not y'all

[Dr. Ama]
D.R. dot A.M.A., The red dot spot your knot Pa
Glock'll spray, A.K. shots remain
Doc Ama, A.K.A. Poppa Flame, (Doctor Lame)
Fresh decay, (Rotten frame) Front police, Pa reframe
Diamonds sprinkle like stained glass panes, (Proper bling)
7 O.D. the gang, S.I. know these bang
Weak rap hoes to blame, Weak rappers stop the shame
Hip Hoppers cop the flame, Coppers know we pop them thangs
Born with the gift of G, Scorn with hostility
So you know what it'll be if you be the shifter V
Niggas know my history, If you don't ask your friend
When my cannons start to spin two inch missiles pierce your skin

[Chorus: Block McCloud]
They wonder why we getting special treatment
We wonder why you getting love at all
Aint no wonder why we treated different
It's real simple cause we not yall
They wonder why we getting special treatment
We wonder why you getting love at all
Aint no wonder why we treated different
If ya listening see that we not yall

[Haxaw]
I'm magnificent with lyrics, Spit if you listening
You hearing it well you ignorant or you militant
I hit targets even at the cost of the innocent
Cross get tossed, I don't give a fuck what you represent
Me I'm dope not counting the nine that I'm flip'n with
Plus the sixteen that I load in the clip and shit
As for other minds I don't need none to trip and get caught
Another problem, Gotta hunt down get rid of it
Aint much else to talk about if it aint a benefit
Most money I make came from business and legitimate
Dog I'm live'n it, While you spit'n it aint serious
I've done seen niggas die over lesser offenses period
You just an idiot, Front'n like you really get pop'n
When the shit pop off you delirious
To even think you cross on my level you delirious
My style should be bagged in burnt cloths like the ________ is

[Chorus]

[R.B.I.]
One to the to the two to the three
R to the to the B-I, Me, I'm a beast for the rap game
A lot of lame cats bringing ya shame
Battle'n to maintain, It's me I believe in
Ten times out of ten it's me that's gone keep me succeeding
Before I leave I done did my seeding
Leave'n em mug knock em out like Marv Breelin
Don't thank me, Thank my Momma
Gotta do everything I want, Life is on the timer
Bounce to this, Never was a wack rhymer
Underground drill'n for ice, A coal miner
Say things to your face, Face your one-liner
Gonna take a miracle, The miracle designer
Think it spayed yall cats, Was just a ________
Fold you over then place you neatly in a bonda
We not we not, He not yall
Find you wherever you lurk and receive my call
The seven is special I'll burn it to your chest
If we coming we coming right, You better wear your vest

[Chorus]

[Hook 2: Dr. Ama]
Knick knack patty wack, Give a dog a bone
You a rider be a rider, Leave my shit alone
Knick knack patty wack, Give a dog a bone
You a rider be a rider, Leave my shit alone
