[King Lil G]
Alright I'ma tell you one time
Which one of you muthafuckers
Like talking to the cops
You don't tell me I'ma shoot your homeboy
No? [gun shot]

[Verse 1]
Fist off fuck your hood
And the click you claim
South side double 9
Coming quick with game
This is real life shit
I don't need to tell 'em stories
Fuck all you muthafuckas
Snitching on my boy morres
The worst thing in life
Is a man being a snitch
Ochoa need to get smacked for being a bitch
If you don't like it
Come on let's get it crackin'
End up on fox 11
Stabbed up &amp; blasted
Never mind
Cause you probably gonna go &amp; tell
When this song drops
I'm probably gonna go to jail
A real gangsta
I don't give a mad fuck
Cleaning out the 4-5
Putting on my black gloves
Organized like cartels
Up in mexico
Give my homies money
Go &amp; get ernesto
Tie his ass up
And bring his ass in
Get the alcohol
Throw it on his eye lids

[Chorus]
This is real life
This is what it is
I don't think you wanna know
Who you fucking with
Its maniaco in the house
Its double 9 in the house
This is real life
This is what it is
I don't think you wanna know
Who you fucking with
Its maniaco in the house
Its double 9 in the house

[Verse 2]
Murder, murder
Murder I'm a murdera
The tiny devils control in my area
Keep rollin'
Rollin' in the low lows
Shout out to all the real maniacos
Coolio, pinkie &amp; the homie johnny
La-di-da-di
The life of a gangsta party
Bucanas 18 is all I'm fucking with
At rodeo bumpin' pedro y manuel
My homies stay drinking
Sniffing lines of coke
Smoking california kush
Trying not to choke
To the compadre pete
And my homie peewee
All you snitch muthafuckas
Ain't trying to see me
Real soldiers
Ride with the real soldiers
I have homies in the f.b.i.'s most wanted
Making money dog
That's my only destiny
Love to the homies in the streets &amp; penitentiaries

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm a muthafucking boss
You need to ask about me
You need to be connected
If you wanna come around me
I know some killas in the hood
That owe me a favor
They'll be knocking at your door
For being a traitor
When the money came
You was cool as fuck
But when the cops came
That's when you spoke up
And you broke down
Like a little bitch
Fidel got a lot of nerve
You lil fucking snitch
Dedicated to the enemies only
Its a shame for you to say
That you was ever my homie
You the type to go to jail
And get shanked up
Let's separate all the fags from the gangstas
What up to downer
What up to preacher
What up to buzzard
And all the streeters
They can't join us
And they can't beat us
Always on the look
9 millimeters

[Chorus]

[King Lil G]
We make muthafuckers get paranoid
Make muthafuckers look both ways
When they cross the street
I ain't fuckin' with 'em
[laughs] yeah
Lil g muthafucken maniaco
You better know the muthafucken name of the game
Yeah..
What up to muthafucken rooster
My homeboy gabriel in the muthafucken house
Roolez ha-ha junior you know the muthafucken deal
Brother less yeah..
Rest in peace chapparo
True soldiers never die
I'm a little muthafucker with a big ass mouth
With a big ass gun too
Maniaco they don't want it with us
Sucios in the muthafucken house
[laughs] and we still fucking hoes too
Your baby's mamas
Your baby's mama's sister's mamas
[laughs] I'm a bad mutherfucker fuck you</pre>
