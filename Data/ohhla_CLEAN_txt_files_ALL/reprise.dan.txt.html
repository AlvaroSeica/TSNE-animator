This is my reprise
This is my reprise

Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) about your scene
Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) about your scene
Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) (gasp)

If I cannot find a scene then I'll just make one
For every bridge that I repair I'll probably break one
But I decided long ago to let things out and not implode
So if you want to take a swing at me than take one

This last little track is less for you and more for me
A little exercise in expression and muscial therapy
See even if the glass is empty there's still residue inside
And that can taste as sweat as the residue that did once reside

The two people I miss most in my life begin with J
There's one that will probably think it's her but in all honesty it ain't
One will know it's him wherever he is today
And one will probably never know and I'll probably never say

You see sometimes emotion can feel just like a straight jacket
But if you still got legs running up the race track it's ok
Because every new emotion teachs something
And make sure every muscle in your heart keeps pumping

I mean take love, the most marketable emotion we possess
Finding love is at the ned of every quest for happiness
But I suggest that maybe if we loo through all that mess
We'll see the strength of the emotions that don't get such good press

For example anger, the thing that makes us fight
But that's just the case if the anger isn't being harnessed right
See anger just like love can cause a storm of motivation
If channeled right and not just seeping through in aggrevation

So many works for art, and literature through out the ages
Have stemmed from the dark hearts of those enbracing their rages
So then regret, I hate to say but it's a pointless one
If there's one thing you can't change, it's the things you've done
And the same goes for grief, in this life most things will come and go
You've just got to keep on learning, and enjoy the show

So, as I finally walk away I say goodbye and good health
As I finally walk away I wish you all you wish yourself

As I finally walk away I say goodbye and good health
As I finally walk away I wish you all you wish yourself

Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) about your scene
Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) about your scene
Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) about your scene
Round here James Dean reigns supreme and we don't give a (gasp) about your scene

Round here, Round here, Round here, here, here, here, Round here, here here here...</pre>
