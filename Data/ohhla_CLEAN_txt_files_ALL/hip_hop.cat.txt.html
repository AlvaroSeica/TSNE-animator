Hip hop, a way of life
Chosen by the ghetto youth out of necessity
It involves graffiti, deejaying, breakdancing and emceeing
Which all rely on raw, artistic skill
You know, they used to tell me that this music would never last
Now look at it now, it influences all music here today
So either you respect it we gon' take it back

Hip hop, the voice of the street, the voice of the youth
The voice that you hear, the voice that only we produce
The way that we salute that makes the wildest niggas start to shoot
The voice that recoupes only 12% of the loot
The voice of the groups, like OutKast, LOX and The Roots
The voice of the truth, that no society can ever mute
The voice of the men and women who gave their lives defendin
The God-given rights, they had no choice but to fight
The voice of the black, latino and the white
The voice of the club that makes the freaks come out at night
The voice of the thugs who pop champagne and rock ice
The voice of the shorties who wear tight shirts and talk sheist
The voice of the shook who look one time but not twice
The voice of the crooks at gambling spot with hot dice
The voice of the church, mosque, synagogue and temple
The voice of your soul, your body and your mental
The voice that says "rap!" when I hear a instrumental
The voice that don't stop and it's just that simple
The voice that don't stop and it's just that simple
The voice that don't, d-d-don't, d-don't...

Yo, we live that life that you call hip hop
From the bottom straight to the tip top
Hey Rawls, we got em while them others did not
So if you with the LC, nigga, lick shot
If you live that life they call hip hop
Worldwide everyday tic-toc
This life is like nothin to play with, ock
That's why when I say "shit" you say "shit hot"
That's why when I say "shit" you say "shit hot"
That's why when I say "shit" you say "shit hot"
That's why when I say "shit" you say "shit hot"
That's why when I say "shit" -

[ Double Trouble ]
Cause here's a little story that must be told
About two cool brothers that were put on hold
Tried to hold us back from fortune and fame
They destroyed the crew and they killed our name
They tried to step on the ego and walk on the pride
But true blue brothers stand side by side
Through thick and thin, from beginning to end
This battle we lost, but the war we'll win
