Live my life in a free world [x4]

[Richter]
It's amazing how this whole world is changing
It went from saying "how you doin'" to settin ya claimin
Rearranging the landscape, all this fighting is draining
Putting walls up for safety but we're really containing
Our mind body and spirit and our acceptance of others
A world religion racin' wealth I thought we're supposed to be brothers
And our mother is the earth and our father the sun
Let's put our differences aside and try to love everyone
C'mon

We need to stop all this fighting
And start realizing
That there is no future
For the youth of today unless we change

[Chorus]
I wanna fly away all across the skies
Look at life through the view of an eagle's eyes
I wanna sail away go under the sea
Find the truth about the mysteries of the deep
I wanna roam the earth as a free man
On a planet with no borders explorin' our lands
I wanna..
Live my life in a free world
Live my life in a free world

Live my life in a free world [x4]

[Brother J]
I'm a globe-trekkin' messenger, freedom express
I'm a citizen of peace combatin' agents of stress
I wanna cleanse the oceans put the oil in my tank
Free these soldiers from war, stack reparations in the bank
Free the world, it's time for peace
Free the hood from poverty
?? raise prodigies
Turn up the mind and please, how the kids gonna read with their ADD?
Afraid I'd never be able to give my free
?? you better hate on beats
Born in the streets yet I'm raised in the East
?? when it comes to the free
Fine melodies I flow like the East
Wisdom, justice, equality
?? mental ??
Freedom fighter in the war for change
Resident evil, eviction notice
New world covenant's a new world focus
Purpose, purpose, end of the circus
Peace!

[Chorus]

[D-Loc]
Live my life with my family &amp; friends
On a mountain road blue sky is heaven
All I really need is some peace of mind
One day we could get away from this fast paced life
Won't you come with me so I can show you the trees
We could float away down the rivers and streams
I wanna live free, and this time I need
To live my dreams when it's time to leave
Me and you we could disappear
One day we could run away and get outta here
We could start a life livin' like we want
Yeah you and I livin' in a free world

[Chorus]

Live my life in a free world [x4]

[Daddy X]
I wanna live in a free world where we can be as free as can be
Free to live out our dreams and free to plant our own trees
I've climbed up the highest mountain, spent some nights out at sea
Went to the end of tomorrow, as far as eyes can see
The great spirit is thunder, clouds grace the sky
All things are related, you see we're all intertwined
I'm sippin' wine by the fire where the love runs deep
Honor, truth, and respect will be the tracks that we leave
Our stepping stones for the children should be like stars in the sky
Living with open hearts and having love in their eyes
Never wearing a disguise, know that nature holds the key
To unlock the deeper secrets that the Spirit will keep

[Chorus x2]

Live my life in a free world [x4]</pre>
