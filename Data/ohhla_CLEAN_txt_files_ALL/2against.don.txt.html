[Verse 1]
They figured trouble was my middle name
cause I'm addicted to money and burning hoes in the game
And niggaz want me gone cause I'm down with the other side
dont give a fuck about your life you can all die
They would of got me but I fled off
next time I see em I'm gonna knock his fucking head off
And leave em bleeding for his family to see
I know them asshole burn at a certain degree, just on plotting on me
But will I drop from a shot with the cops on the side block
rocks in my socks, making gwap with my glock cocked
Lost in a world full of danger
never will I die always one in the chamber
Occupy your body with shotty shells
it never fails, punk mothefuckas need to burn in hell
Catch you slipping on a late night creep
its 2 against the world nigga so mothefuck peace

[Chorus]
Its 2 against the world
(2 against the, 2 against the world) x3
Its 2 against the world, world

[Verse 2]
Dear papa ima rolling stone
I had to make it on my own
You were never home
I kept the chrome on my waist line
because I'm drunk tryna take mine
left his ass fucked on the bassline
Witness the devil at a highest speed
you never could see me the last of a dying breed
They getting ready to get me so show me how to roll on
cause everytime I took a chance I gripped the fo fo and they dont go
The ways of a millitary mind is strapped
breaking mothefuckas down with the bat
Aint nothing change its the same shit
you couldnt fuck with a nigga both fucking with the same bitch
But ima rida till the day I die
Forgive me for my evil ways gotta stay alive,I know I drive
But it hard as hell
I gotta find another way before they put me in jail
only time could tell

[Chorus]
Its 2 against the world
(2 against the, 2 against the world) x3
Its 2 against the world, world

[Verse 3]
Im rolling blunts with my niggas in the pen for life
so if I'm really doing wrong god I wanna be right
You called shots like a boss but hes lost in time
fuck around sniff the white yay and lost his mind
But the dope is the only hope
because hes focused on that
Still be like to see the pope
because he feels attacked
Dude vomit then his heart scattered worked it out
I cant belive he left his house without backing the mac
He couldnt see so they took revenge
they left him bleeding all alone with his body damage
I aint lying so meet my lovely lady 45
she helped me drop some shit nigga dont look suprise
I really never gave a fuck about a role model
And nigga one by one making mothefuckas soul bottle
Top gun I really gotta find my destiny
I be damn to let these fools try to swallow the rest of me

[Chorus]
Its 2 against the world
(2 against the, 2 against the world) x3
Its 2 against the world, world</pre>
