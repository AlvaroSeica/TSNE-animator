[Kevin McCall]
I wanna wake up baby
And see you sharing my bed
You roll over start smiling
Girl I'm a cook you breakfast
Yeah I gotta say you got my heart
And your my answer when I'm reaching for the stars (oh)
I don't need nobody else but you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a let you play babe
Music in the car
Shawty your my favorite song
Your my baby
Kissing on your neck and don't even need permission cause your body saying yes
And you know that I want it (girl!)
So just let me get it girl
When it all said and done

I'm a make you number one one, one yea [x3]
I'm a make it...

When it's all said and done
I'm a make you number one

[Chris Brown]
Lady
Come here girl
I don't wanna share this with nobody

And ain't nobody got your sexy body
And something that things you do
That make me wanna stay with you
Ain't no other way to say it
Girl I just love you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a let play babe
Music in the car
Shawty your my favorite song
Your my baby
Kissing on your neck and don't even need permission cause your body sayin yes
And you know that I want it (girl!)
So just let me get it girl
When it all said and done
