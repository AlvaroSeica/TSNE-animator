[Kurupt]
When it stops... 9 times out of 10
It's gon' start again where it started at, ended up
and restart again, get your mind in the right position
before it start again, cause when it drops
9 times out of 10
It's gon' drop again stop watch how the low watch
Flocks flockin in, flocks stop just to see the pops
Watch I'll be there WHEN IT STOPS~!
9 times out of 10
It's gon' start again where it started at, ended up
and restart again, get your mind in the right position
before it start again, cause when it drops
9 times out of 10
It's gon' drop again stop watch how the low watch
Flocks flockin in, flocks stop just to see the pops
Watch I'll be in rare motion
Cause I be in rare motion
Get your calculator to calculate this
Different forms of calculus and it's just us, me and Quik
So sick so fast so quick, music worth bricks
Treat it like we on the strip
Treat it like we on the strip it ain't shit it ain't a hit
'less the ladies wanna strip, count your grip, come equipped
or you ain't sayin shit and make it storm
Or make it rain, make it hurricane, typhoons
Tycoons I assume delusions of losin
It's like mushrooms, get it now or pretty soon
Irradiated mushrooms

[DJ Quik]
Irradiate entire rooms
Go bananas, baboons just (STOP!)

14 350's
Around the clock pop 'round the block
Around the whole circumfrence in abundance
Fear like Ted Bundy
Jed and Ed Bundy, you'll take all I have from me
Toil turmoil I'll bounce like bungees
You'll get thrown away like scrunchies
Don't talk to me no more about my motherfuckin money!
"Cannonball Run" 'em up
Run 'em up, runnin up summin up the whole confrontation
Waitin my patience is achin
I sum it up! Comin up is such a wait/weight
The impatient's dumb enough to fuck it up
Look I sum it up, just STOP!

Cause 9 times out of 10
You have to dump again when you gunnin up
to get what you want have to dump again
Just to keep it all to get some more
to store the pump again, just pop!
9 times out of 10
It's gon' start again where it started at, ended up
and restart again, get your mind in the right position
before it start again, cause when it drops
9 times out of 10
It's gon' drop again stop watch how the low watch
Flocks flockin in, flocks stop just to see the pops
Watch I'll be in rare motion</pre>
