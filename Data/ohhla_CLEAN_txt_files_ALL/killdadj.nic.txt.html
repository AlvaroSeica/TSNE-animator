Hey hey hey, ya know
It just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj
Ha ha

[Verse 1]
I ain't know the president live in DC
And I ain't know they call me Nicki Lewinsky
I never knew that dude with Jay was Pimp C
And I ain't know I be with Paris and Lindsay
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
I fly girl pop up and I fly girl dip
I fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip
And I don't never guzzle it I fly girl sip
Now get dat Rose' get dat, get dat Rose'
A little Hennesey and Louie the Thirteenth
Now everybody look my way my way
Excuse all my haters 'cause they lookin' sideways
Let's get it now

[Bridge]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when this yo song
You can act like you don't like it but ya do
Ya do, ya do, do, do, do, do

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna kill tha mutha fuckin' DJ
If he don't p-p-pull up, let that record replay
R-r-record replay, r-r-record replay.
I think I'm gonna kill the mutha fuckin' DJ

[Verse 2]
I ain't know the police was the babylon
And I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties was bigger than Pamela
So paparazzi flickin' be flickin' they camera.
I just know dat I be on my fly girl shit
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips
Now get dat OJ, get dat, get dat OJ
A little cranberry and some Gran-y Marnier
Now every body look my way my way
Excuse all the haters 'cause they lookin' sideways
Let's get it now

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Fuck 'em like sexin' while they be flexin'
When they know that this they song
So interestin' frontin' like they textin'
Damn them bitches got me wrong
Got me Wrong, wrong, wrong
Got me wrah-wrah-wrah-wrah-wrah wrong
Got me wrah-wrah-wrah-wrah-wrah
Wrah-wrah-wrah-wrah-wrah wrong
You bitches got me wrong

[Chorus] </pre>
