Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You can't see me
Peek a boo (peek a boo)
I see you

I walk into the darkness, if you see me say what's up
Lil' Rob can you rock the mic? All fucking night
What kind of question's that? Homeboy who the fuck you think I am?
Lil' Rob, Chicano, M-E-X-I-C-A-N
I be the baddest, and I put that on everything I love
The hairs on my chinny-chin-chin, my girlfriend, and my bombay chin, and my yesca
Tu familia, primera, la colo√±a es mi guerra
Homegirl just like luggage
Fuck it, stuck with a steelo that you feel though
Once it's gotta be true, but it's for real though just like me though
See no, hear no, speak no evil
You can add it, divide it, subtract and multiply it, there is no equal
People open you eyes, quit looking at the world through a peep-hole
I'm here, the one you need, the one you hear
What's the matter matter? Can't you see?
Oh I forgot ese you can't see me
Ponle

[Chorus x2]
Mira me, mira me
I'm over here
Mira me, mira me
I'm over here
Mira me, mira me
I disappear
Peek a boo (peek a boo)
I see you

You can't see me but I see you
I see you in the ICU
Be nice to me and I'll be nice to you
But if you got a problem, fuck it
It's not the first time or the last time that I've pulled a fast crime
I pass time, mastermind disaster times all the time
After time you will find it's my way or the highway
There's no way it's your way, spit a piece of wood and I'll be there
If it's stone then you'll find me, it's over like 1999 be
Meet me at the crossroads, I'll be chilling by the tree
Drinking lemonade up in the shade with your family
Look at your boy, ain't he just the cutest little kid?
Oops, kicked over the fucking crib and got blood up on his bib
I can do what I want, got you mind wrapped up in confusion
You cry like the llorona, shut up it was just an illusion
Seeing how bad you are, you're not as bad as you claim to be
You can't see me, peek a boo (peek a boo), I see you

[Chorus x2]

I love to sin, if I didn't sin I'd have no fun, what fun is that
Went to church and had no fun so I claim I'm done with that
Not like that, I don't mean to disrespect no one
But if you feel disrespected, fuck you, my life goes on
Way beyond what your eyes can see
Beyond what you're imagining
Where all the little birds sing
And you love what's happening
I just chill, I don't spill the wine or drop a dime
I'll take care of all my enemies, homey it's all in time
I'm invisible, invinsible, trick you with my visual
Leave you all miserable, mystical rituals
Beautiful paybacks, if you were smart you'd stay back
Way back, on the other side of the train-tracks
My imagination gives hallucinations through more situations 
Turn a flicker to a flame, it's insane
If you mean that homeboy that you still can't see
Open your fucking eyes vato, you can't see me

[Chorus x2]

I'm over here
I'm over here
I disappear
I'm over here
I'm over here
I disappear</pre>
