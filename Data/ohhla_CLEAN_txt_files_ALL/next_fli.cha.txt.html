[Intro/Chorus]
If we ever come back down, we gon' catch the next flight up {*3X*}
If we ever come back down, but we'll never come down

[Chamillionaire]
Alright I'm headed back to Brazil, let's show 'em how to stay paid
Money never funny so no need to add a H-A
Never call me H-A-Keem you know you can't say
that you knew my brother or other before the 8th grade
Y'all be with +Drama+ like you hangin out with +Kay Slay+
or The Aphilliates down in the A that make the tapes play
Internet thugs countin the computers they spray
We in the Atlantis going swimmin for the eighth day
Not the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantis hotel
Ask reception about me, they'll say they know me well
Living like a king baby, you gon' have to show yourself
Take off the veil, a fetish for tuggin pony tails
Let's chase money, call me you know I know the trail
Try to get it without me and you gon' probably fail
Why fly if it ain't no wi-fi and no e-mails
and the lobster bucket where you can throw the shells
Yeah, we both exchanged shots on Twitter
Difference between me and you is you are not in villas
Told me I'm to die for, but I'm not gon' kill her
But if she look like a Rihanna how I'm not gon' hit her
Ha ha~! Nah, I'm just playin nah I'm just jokin 'round
How I'm soundin right now is how I'm supposed to sound
You would think I was playing poker how money doesn't fold
At stackin it I'm the poster child
How does it feel talking tough right at your own face?
Starin in the mirror realizing that your gold fake
Tryin to get waves, brush your hair and seein snowflakes
Only date you ever had is one you had to post date
Go lick a stamp then tell your tramp I'm feelin that
I'ma get her damp, then use the stamp to send her back
Can't say nothin I ever said was never fact
Y'all stink I listen and smell the scent of whack
You tryna figure out which chick I'ma take out
We eatin pretty good, we don't ever get takeout
While you all on the dick lookin at media takeout
I'm on a stakeout in a Brazilian steak house
You know it's not a game when you see what I be left with
Put it in my left fist and stack it like it's Tetris
My freshness, abroad and domestic
Guess it's why I'm never X'd off a guest list
Let's wish that y'all knew how to get chips
Then let's wish that y'all were this impressive
Let's switch cause y'all hop on the next dick
Be on so many dicks I bet you could probly sweat piss
They got 'em and you're a hater and a urinater
Sick of me ballin I'm sorry there's not a cure for paper
I'm sorry, I'm headed to Jamaica
to get 'em wet when that's somethin you take 'em to the lake for

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chamillionaire] {*sound of chopper flying overhead*}
Mmmmm, never come down
Never come, down
Never come dowwwwwwn
Never come, down
{*backwards talking*}
