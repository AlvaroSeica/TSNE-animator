Song:   You've Never Seen a Place Like This Kid
Typed by: timespitkicker@aol.com

you've never seen a place like this kid
black and white sailboats and kind women
with scarlet lips and pomegranate temples
all in a backdrop with magenta clouds
napoleon's kicking a violin
electric happiness, laughing during seizures
as rare as a hen's tooth

don't lie, don't lie, don't lie, like threat

(oh girl, you're so fine, I just wanna tell you
I find you real attractive and sexy
I'm just gonna tell you right now
you're beautiful baby, I wanna make love
you're all I want baby, you and me
magenta clouds)

back when the only thing was wasn't segregated was the piano keys
you were cursing at the clouds you made
but look at you now, Clark Gable and Mona Lisa are swapping spit
at last the people look like flowers
you've never seen a place like this kid</pre>
