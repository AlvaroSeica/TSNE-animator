[T.I. - Intro]
Yeah~! Aye Ye?
Why don't you let me welcome these niggaz to the world they ain't welcome
to, ya understand?
It bring me great pleasure to welcome the real and banish the fake
No big mouth that hold cake, fag bait ass niggaz allowed
But to everybody else

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kid Cudi] + (T.I.)
I would like to welcome you to the world of (world of)
Fast money, fast cars, big diamond rings, chief chains and the girls of
(girls of)
Fake smiles, broken hearts and if you looking for your real love
You won't find it here
If you looking for your real love
Well goodnight my dear
  Oooh, if you looking for real love
  Don't come around here
  Oooh, if you looking for real love
  It ain't here my dear
  Mmmmm mmmmm
  Move ooooooon

[T.I.]
It's my pleasure to welcome you to the world of
Fast money, flashy cars, big guns, undone, threw away for the love of
The game, I don't need a chain or the fame
Still shine, spend time with the girls of
Fake smiles, broken hearts trying hard in the club looking for her real love
You won't find it here
All I got is hard dick and conversation for you
I was just high, even lying when I say I love you
My mind saying it were both, I just wanna fuck you, her too
Blowing Lyle, smelling like a Bubba Kush perfume
She coming home with me, she finna meet her doom
She ain't sayin I'm the greatest? Finna change her tune
The coldest and the hottest call me December June
Deliver euphoria straight to your room
I hit that ass, and I wait, I zoom
Make it rain non-stop call me young typhoon
Top spot already filled up no room
Thought I would put some paper in your purse so soon
Well wrong she is and mistaken she was
Tip broke? Never heard no such thing of
I'll fuck you up, don't touch me cuz
Just trust me bruh, it must be
Li-li-li-living my dreams, don't wake me up
Yo-yo-you fake it till you make it, must suck
All th-th-the haters hate us for the flav of the paper
Th-th-that's why I can't love my neighbors
Da-da-dangerous, don't kick, cut you
If you ain't welcome in my world, bitch fuck you!
Da-da-dangerous, don't kick, cut you
You ain't welcome in my world, bitch fuck you!

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kid Cudi] + (T.I.)
I would like to welcome you to the world of (world of)
Fast money, fast cars, big diamond rings, chief chains and the girls of
(girls of)
Fake smiles, broken hearts and if you looking for your real love
You won't find it here
If you looking for your real love
Well goodnight my dear
  Oooh, if you looking for real love
  Don't come around here
  Oooh, if you looking for real love
  It ain't here my dear
  Mmmmm mmmmm
  Move ooooooon

[Kanye West]
I would like to welcome you to the world of
Fake bitches, no love, what the fuck you take me for?
Show love - I hate haters in the club
You must not really know where I come from
Exactly where my heart or you would never, never, NEVER
UGH, where do I start? People ask me shit about Illuminati
First off - FUCK that mean?
"He loved Jesus when he he he was worse off"
Oh I see, when they, think a nigga is, stupid rich
People just start coming up with stupid shit!
Man shit - I could never predict
Hold up, let me hit you with this
Rolling in a Bugatti with four chains is some foolishness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be the shit
They'd rather see a nigga locked up, why? For stupid shit
Look how they did my nigga Tip
Soon as Wayne get out, Tip go in
Wonder why the nigga wanna make the clip go in
Wonder why it so hard when it get going
Hold ya head my niggaz the system is
Made to make niggaz fall, made to make niggaz fail
Especially if you ball, they don't take niggaz well
Na-nah, you can't come through flying in a, in a Bentley shining
I'm in the back, backseat driving
Screaming on a nigga like I'm actually driving

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kid Cudi] + (T.I.)
Welcome you to the world of (world of)
Fast money, fast cars, big diamond rings, chief chains and the girls of
(girls of)
Fake smiles, broken hearts and if you looking for your real love
You won't find it here
If you looking for your real love
Well goodnight my dear
  Oooh, if you looking for real love
  Don't come around here
  Oooh, if you looking for real love
  It ain't here my dear
  Mmmmm mmmmm
  Move ooooooon</pre>
