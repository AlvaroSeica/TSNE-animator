[Chorus: screwed vocals]
Ride, ride, ride clean, if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean, if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean, if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I remember way back in the day
All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
from the sub, work the juice, bitch, I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers out chere tryna take
That's my prized possession, in recession kept me straight
Clear my mind, then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday

Just me and my old school {*4X*}

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ain't nothing changed, still the same country bumpkin
M-I crooked, super southern, don't be tripping on my rims
I'd rather sit higher than bald eagles on shoulders of giant people
If I'm gon' ride, hell, I don't know about them
Popping my collar, rocking gators, fuck some Prada
Be a scholar of this pimping to the very, very end
Forever official like words out the scripture
Off the Richter, saw the future through my rearview lens

Just me and my old school {*4X*}

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Big K.R.I.T.]
See it ain't just a car, it ain't just a whip
It's a time machine, it's a spaceship, it's precious
You gotta take your time
You can't be rubbing on them curbs and hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
Me and my old school

[Chorus]</pre>
