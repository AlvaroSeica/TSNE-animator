[Intro: Ice-T]
Yeah I know, all the fellows out there
Got a girl that's real special to them
Yeah I do too, but sometimes, it's not as easy as it seems
You know I love you, but you're driving me crazy!!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
You're hungry, you're sleepy, you're angry, you're happy
You're cold, then you're hot, then you're fine, then you're not
Then you're sick, you're healthy, you wanna go party
You're jealous, you're drunk, you're crying, I'm lying 
You're mad, now I'm tripping
You're sleepy, you're angry, you're bugging
I'm done, and I'm loosing my mind!
Now you're sober, you're sorry, you love me, I love you
I hate this, you love it, you say that it's healthy!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me mad!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me mad!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You're happy, you're sad, you ask me if I'm Okay
Tired, I'm working, I'm just trying to concentrate
You're cool, you're bugging; off some TV show you saw
Tripping, accusing, then say that you're sorry
I'm stressing, you're playing, I'm working, you rub me
I'm cool, now I'm calm, now you wanna go snuggle
I'm talking, you're talking, I'm yelling, you're crying
I hug you, you sniffle, I'm happy
The phone rings it's drama, I listen, your girlfriend's man is cheating!
You're mad and you're angry, and you act like it was me!
I'm drained, I'm sleepy, you crawl in the bed
And you hug me, and kiss me, and tell me you need me

[Chorus: Ice-T]
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me mad!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me mad!

[Skit #1: Ice-T Conversating with his Bitch]
[Bitch] Um baby, I don't know if I like this song; I mean, do you love me, or do you hate me?
[Ice-T] Come on girl, you know I love you
[Bitch] Oh really? - Well what about last night?!
[Ice-T] Come on, you was on that bullshit last night, bitch!
[Bitch] Oh what ever, you call that love?

[Chorus: Ice-T]
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me mad!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving, you're driving me mad!
I Love You!

[Skit #2: Monologue performed by the same bitch]
Oh you know, I love you too baby, but what is all this shit about 
Going to the studio four days to make a Goddamn four minute record huh?
And what's all this Goddamn spending time with your friends when they ain't doing shit!
And I understand, you're the star!
But what about my life? - What about my hair?
What about my nails? - What about my parties?
I wanna spend time with my friends, Goddamn it!

[Outro: Ice-T]
I Love You! - You're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving me mad!
I Love You! - You're driving me crazy!
I Love You! - You're driving me mad!</pre>
