[Timbo King]
Ya'll keep actin' like them thing don't spark
How many chicks I done flipped apart
So many, the Remy know, ice cut the chase
You fuck around, and buck your face, box cutter shit, nigga
Gutter, them fiends want more butter
Lethal, ask Glover, baby bubba
My baby mother want the latest Hummer
That H2 this summer, yo, Bo so thorough, though
Keep those things, and a hood nigga eat your wings
It's that easy homey, yeah, the chicks love Bo
Cuz they know I don't give 'em no dough, just hard dick, mami
Yeah, you can find me with them limeys on me
Ya'll kids go play in the park, Dorney
Keep acting like you Al Po', catch me
O-Chi on the down low, with a down hoe

[Interlude: Timbo King]
Yup, Bo King, Fort Knox, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, turn my headphones up, aiyo I want my mic right
Make sure my voice is clear
Brooklyn, full court pressure, you heard?
Bo King, let's go

[Timbo King]
Up in the club with them O's of trees
Them hoes right there be hoes in seas
We them g's that don't get along with d's
Yo man fruck them niggas, fuck the 5-0
From the PJ's, we smoke Porter P's
Them niggas right there be wannabes
Though from the borough that's known to squeeze
Hot shit, that be 90 degrees, you feel flames, pa
Spot for real and kill things
Ain't nothing change, haters, we still kings
Bo King, big trucks, you know the names
Who about to run New York, it's Bo King
With the voice that girls, hang their k-ling
Ball on ya'll, make one phone call, start a war on ya'll
Cuz it's, gangsta gangsta, pull that trigga
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Now how bitches wanna fuck, nigga?</pre>
