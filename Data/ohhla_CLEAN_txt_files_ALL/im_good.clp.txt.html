[Malice]
You can find me in the streets 
even in the drought 
my mattress is full 
why shouldn't I be out? 
hey buddy 
I'm good 
(what they tell you?) I'm good 
(what they tell you?) I'm good 
(what she tell you?) I'm good 
(what you see?) 

Two hundred dolla jeans 
with my favorite patch 
pullin up my ride 
hell yea the rims match! 
What they tell you? 
I'm good 
(what they tell you?) I'm good 
(what they tell you?) I'm good 
(what she tell you?) I'm good 
(what you see?) 

[Malice]
Man I'm killin it ridin in that brand new 
swimmin through the streets lookin like I'm shamu (yeah) 
in that big body (yeah) 
with the wet paint (yeah) 
I got some pocket change 
from selling wet weight 
Today is a good day 
ice cubes on my chest 
lookin at my blackberry 
freak hit me on the text 
Come and beat it up 
I just need a minute 
you can k ya ass 
you ain't gotta lay in it 
Niggaz don't like it when you lookin good 
hate it when you shinin through the neighborhood 
brand new ride 
ninjas know the time 
ho's cut they eyes 
we call them samurai's (Wah Wah!) 
fly as I could ever be! 
a level of success that you could never see! (yeah) 
You jealous mane (yeah) 
we in propellers mane (yeah) 
think about it 
ain't shit you can tell us mane! 

[Chorus: Malice, Pharrell and Pusha T]

[Pusha T]
Cruisin on them twenty-twos got me sittin pretty 
you should hear that engine pur 
here kitty kitty 
Ride through the city 
e'erbody know me 
and the sun is out 
it's like it's shinin on me 
Shoutin out the homies 
as I breeze by 
I'm on cloud 9 
and I ain't even high 
Told my shorty I'll be back and I ain't even lie 
Them VVS's be the best that money can buy 
I see you flirtin baby 
them jeans is painted on her 
mama lookin right 
and I don't even want her 
No need to take it personal but that's just how it be 
No disrespect to you 
I'm just enjoyin me 
Finally I'm free 
all my dues paid 
Them yellow diamonds got the charm like its minute maid 
and I'm lookin good 
and I'm feelin good 
try and stop my shine 
I wish a nigga would 

[Chorus]
