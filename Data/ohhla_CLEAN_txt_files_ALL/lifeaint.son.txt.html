Typed by: IcyBlayze@hotmail.com

As I gaze out the window, I look at life
Thinking of all the things I did some wrong some right
But my mama did raise no fool, I thank god, I graduated High School
I trip on all the things i've been through
and if I make my dreams done came true
but there is always something trying to hold me back
cause just the other day my brother got jacked
and my daddy's always singing the sad song
Girl where ya be when your not home?
some might think im selling drugs G
but I dont trip cause aint nobody gonna help me
and if a woman is trying to make it is that a shame
see life, aint nothing but a game

Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game

Ya only live once and I know that
but its a trip when your told to hold back
a lot of people go through agonies
and I just wonder why the devil wanna mess with me
I guess there comes some times in one's life
when you just think sometimes you gotta think twice
cause I aint the one to be treated wrong
miss independent, I can make it on my own
and I aint going to be neglected
I'd rather be by myself til im respected
a woman gotta do for her own see
its the 90's all a man can do is love me
cause im gon buy my own car, my own house
I can do things for myself you couldn't think about
now Im caught up in the real world
knowing im a woman sometimes I wish I was a girl
and if I give up thats a damn shame
cause life aint nothing but a game

Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game
Life aint nothing but a game</pre>
