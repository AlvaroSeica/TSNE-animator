Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook]
Even though I know I struggle, I hustle till the end
I'ma stand on my own feet, can't be a boy amongst these men
All I need is a rang, and a lil' bit of Henn
And black tint up on my window, so you can't see me within
Here I come here I come, I know you see me coming
I know you see me coming, I know you see me coming
Here I come here I come, I know you see me coming
I know you see me coming, I know you see me coming

[Rasaq]
If you see me in the booth ski mask on, I'ma blast off
Pitching niggaz in your ass dog, blast your ass off
Hit the mic with a do' boy, cause I'm so raw
Is I'm with y'all, naw nigga I don't know y'all
Hoping for my downfall, but I'm standing so tall
Do' all in my pockets, trying to make it snowball
Fell off hell naw, nigga I done came back
Different track, but the same nigga with the same tats
You fake niggaz rapping, trying to spit the same facts
And that's why they never feel it, when y'all niggaz say that
So stay back, let a lil' nigga in the front now
Before I show you how to do it, let me put this blunt down boy

[Hook]

[Rasaq]
I stand on my own two, come and knock me down
Haters frown in my face, but they don't ever fuck around
Everyday I roll G'd up, puffing on a pound
Daydreaming bout the money, to the ceiling from the ground
Throwedest in my town, got my own buzz and my sound
Fuck a punchline and noun, I'm a real nigga bound
Hope you fake niggaz drown, in your own damn flow
Cuz I'm so damn real, and you niggaz so-so
This is for my real niggaz, holding up the fo' fo'
This is for my real niggaz, still repping solo
This is for my real niggaz, Big Roy and Waynehead
Keep that lead in your pocket, cause we finna make bread
