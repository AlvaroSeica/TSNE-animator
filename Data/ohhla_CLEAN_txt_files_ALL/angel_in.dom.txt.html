Aiyo, danger on this track, name ringing on the Stat'
The game changes, the kid got famous with the rap
Larry Davis when he rap, came in, sprayed on the track
True player, from the Himolaya, he a mack
Dom P one of them niggas you know, plus you know he lethal
If I came off in the first season, you know the'd be a sequel
I dance on 'em, you don't even got a chance on 'em
Him is me, and he is I
And he still fly, nigga, it's do or die
And if you try, it's homicide
War poetry, Terrorist shit, nigga, you know it's me
The impeccable, street respectable
Fat blacks hoodies macks, and a tech or two
Check your crew, before I have 'em laid out
Hit the deck in two, or you can get stripped and laid out

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
There's an angel in the sky, but we don't believe in him
It's dangerous when he rhyme, so we had to hit the streets for him
There's an angel in the sky, but we don't believe in him
It's dangerous when he rhyme, so we had to hit the streets for him
There's an angel in the sky, but we don't believe in him
It's dangerous when he rhyme, so we had to hit the streets for him
Let's twist one back for the kid, and blow a tree for him
Let's twist one back for the kid, and blow a tree for him

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, feel the fusion, Terrorist is not an illusion
I'm here in the flesh, right now at my best
With this rap shit about who's popping
Tell me is it still down south, or can I give 'em some options
I swear my Dirty Doctrine, still is toxic
If they ain't talking logic, it's not ironic
My beats get laid down, they super sonic
The world's gone numb now, I'm a beast with this heart
And these streets we on it, we rip 'em apart
Terrorist is him, Terrorist high jack
If you not in the plane, I toss 'em out the Cadillac
I'm on my G mack, and my G grind
You don't start none, son, and it'll be fine
So what they gonna say about this one? Is it lackluster?
I like to put hands on niggas, and gat touch 'em
I'm the shit, and that's a fact, and you a rat
To be exact, you a fake hustler
That wish you had my swag, I'm quality like weed and jars
And nigga you were stealing bags
Not even B could upgrade ya
So listen to this Terrorist shit and do yourself a favor

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
