[Intro: B.G.]
Whats happenin' look (whhaaaa)
It's Lil B. Gizzle ya heard me
One of New Orleans finest
and if you walk with me for a minute in New Orleans
I'ma show you how we do it

[B.G.]
Look, me and my clique all ex-drug addicts
And we got big money spending habits
All got trucks and cars made by caddy
And all got a bad girl that call us daddy
You should see us, the weekend would buy you classic
We on Canel Street holdin' up traffic
Hollerin' at girls white, black, and hispanic
From southern and grambblin'
Tryin to make it happen
We coming through big trucks sound knockin'
Girls in the middle of the street p-poppin'
That's how we do it, where we do it
We don't play with it
You got a K, you play
We got a K we spray with it
That's how we roll deep down in the boot
We quick to shoot, but strictly bout getting loop
Rest in peace to Souja Slim cause he was a fool
Walk with me through New Orleans
And ima show you how we do


[Chorus: Gar]
Put chrome on everythang we own
Uptown to downtown getting our grind on
Now won't you walk with me, walk the walk with me, walk the walk with me
walk the walk with me
Come on
Second line, super sundays and DJ's
And even Petey Pablo and before Beyonce now won't you bounce for me, bounce
the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me
Come on

[B.G.]
All day on Monday it must be on the grind
Cause that night is going down round the bottom line
Tuesday night pop a pill and go catch a screaser
Shoot cross the river
Go holla at Juve at Club Caesar
Wednesday I gotta see the girl shake
You bring it off, they take it off at the Show Case
Thursday night they 50 deep with they crew
Uptown and downtown in the House of Blues
Friday you don't know what to expect
Why Wayne had me bump in that Key West
Saturday don't forget your strap or your vest
Cause anything liable to happen at the Duplex
Sunday morning, on the lake parking lot pimpin'
Sunday night it's going down at three sixty
Rest in peace to Souja Slim cause he was a fool
Walk with me through New Orleans
I'ma show you how we do

[Chorus: Gar]
Put chrome on everythang we own
Uptown to downtown getting our grind on
Now won't you walk with me, walk the walk with me, walk the walk with me
walk the walk with me
Come on
Second line, super sundays and DJ's
And even Petey Pablo and before Beyonce now won't you bounce for me, bounce
the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me
Come on

[B.G.]
It ain't no secret New Orleans is full of guerillas
It ain't no secret New Orleans is full of some killas
It ain't no secret Chopper City in the door
It ain't no secret I'm backed up by Cutt Throat
It ain't no secret I ain't a rookie, I'm a pro
It ain't no secret it ain't bout Cash Money no more
If you real than you know from that git go
It's alwayz been Chopper City in the Ghetto
Now VL where you at throw your hands up
Magnolia where you at throw your hands up
Melphamine and Josephine throw your hands up
For C Murder Calio throw your hands up
Downtown where you at throw your hands up
Stop the violence everybody put your gats up
Rest in peace to Souja Slim cause he was a fool
Walk with me through New Orleans
I'ma show you how we do

[Chorus: Gar]
Put chrome on everythang we own
Uptown to downtown getting our grind on
Now why don't you walk with me, walk the walk with me, walk the walk with me
walk the walk with me
Come on
Second line, super sundays and DJ's
And even Petey Pablo and before Beyonce now don't you bounce for me, bounce
the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me
Come on</pre>
