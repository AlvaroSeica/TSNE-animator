[Styles P]
Pain.. pain.. pain...
Pain.. pain.. pain...
 
All I know is pain, all I seen is death
Couple homies and brother gone, when I'm gon' step
I ain't suicidal, damn my brain need rest
Think about my childhood, pain in my chest
Past is the past, future ain't great
All right in the hood when any day could be my last
Pop somethin back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hawk some back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hard bein a gangsta rapper, you don't know the half
You ain't got to condone it but you was never homeless
And you ain't never fast, so you don't know the wrath
To takin a long walk, down the wrong path
All I know is pain - everything I did wrong
I did it in vain, that's why I'm tryin to change
Live for my seeds but the game ain't change
Only the strong survive, I will maintain
 
[Chorus: Styles P] + (Alchemist)
All I know is - pain; all I get is - pain
All I give is  pain; all I live is - pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's no love, ice cold blood runnin all through my veins)
All I know is - pain; all I get is - pain
All I give is  pain; all I live is - pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's more than rhymes, more shine than the diamonds on your chain)
 
[Styles P]
What you know about pain?
Blood, sweat and tears where I'm standin in the rain
If I don't blow Mary Jane I'm goin insane
Before I had a car I was in the fast lane
Drug dealer stick up kids for the neck game, a lot that I regret
But I made it as a rapper, and it's not what I expect
For a fact, this business is more crooked
The boys'll sell they souls to the devil, the Lord lookin
See in you hell just in case that we all cookin
I got sins too, lot of foul shit that I been through
The world is God house, I'm just a window - pane
Tryin to maintain up to the end yo
 
[Chorus]
 
[Styles P]
All I know is pain, I feel so drained
Rap niggaz is insane, they on Procaine
What they call hot, I would call so lame
They don't care about the art, and they show no shame
If you ain't gettin spins, then you ain't gon' win
But if you came from the bottom you should stay goin in
The Ghost don't make it then the Phantom gon' win
I'ma make the kids richer, make grandma grin
 
[Chorus]</pre>
