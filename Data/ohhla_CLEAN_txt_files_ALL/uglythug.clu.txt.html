1-2-3 in the place to be
Time for that new Jada
Hold up this is a warm up
Double R, D-Block

[Chorus]
Put ya hoodie on just thug it on out
ACG boots thug it on out
let ya pants sag just thug it on out
New York City thug it on out
Put ya hoodie on just thug it on out
ACG boots thug it on out
let ya pants sag just thug it on out
New york City thug it on out
It can get ugly {*8X*}

The Professional 3 ahhhhhhh!

Fuck is everybody so mad at the south for (why)
Learn how to switch ya style up go southpaw( you can't)
If you didn't mean to say it what you open ya mouth for
better reason for me just to open ya scalp more (uh-huh)
All these methaphors and similes are memories
I'm about to expose these young dudes identity
I'm still slick with the tongue
quick wit a gun
give back to whoever I'm as real as they come
Muah is amongst the apprentices
and these little dudes is just playing with sentences
the diffrences is
they do it for less
I do it for best
how many live niggas you know that can do it to death yes
Life is a bitch and I came in it
similar to melo when comes to the game winners
Whatever duke
we can lock up or slug it out
you would be amazed how we just thug it out what!!!!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Put ya hoodie on just thug it on out
ACG boots thug it on out
let ya pants sag just thug it on out
New York City thug it on out

It can get ugly

[Verse 2]
Can hit my target with a slug I'm hawk it
the way the bullets come out the thompson is acquired
I understand spanish much better than I talk it (vato)
I'm always down bottom but I stay on some New York Shit
Right now the budget is real tight
Ijust might
I feel like like I can drop whenever I feel like
Screw what the odds is
The boy got the artful dogers sitting on top of the nik boots marvlous
Compare me to nothing around  in town
unless it's the 2 up in there air or under the  ground
25 357's all chrome heads
baseball gloves the champoin hoodies the conehead
me I get the loot and route before I have to shoot it out
my flows like a needle right before you get a rootcanal
we the one's locking up slug it out show you what a thug about
It's a damn shame how we thug it out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Took care of my business with diddy
now I'm waiting for the ryders and jimmy to slide me a couple of pennies
something mean from the phillipines on my chest and
catching NCAA in high-def'n
I don't have a problem with squeezin a quarter
or getting a liter of water just to finish the order
screw 5 months with no d's we can flood it out
I know what exactly want me to do is thug it out

[Chorus]
Put ya hoodie on just thug it on out
ACG boots thug it on out
let ya pants sag just thug it on out
New York City thug it on out

It can get ugly it can get ugly it can get ugly it can get ugly
