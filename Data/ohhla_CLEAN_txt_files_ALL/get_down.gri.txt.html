Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I wish I could remember the day I lost it
Flip through the pages I've written when I'm unconcious
I black out and I don't really understand it
But everythings relative everythings relative right now
I feel my life is a physical writing block
Repeating over the past but fighting against the clock
And it hurts me
Deep down inside though it urks me
And [?] you could settle for poetical sounded purpose [?] is gone
And I don't really say goodbyes much
Wasn't worth the wait but this plague is mine
Yup, so if my writing is encrypited across the airways
Boogie down break neck style emotion airraites the passion
Single emission to see the facit
Mingle with dead and inflict it with this disaster like welcome
I don't know what it means but it helps me
Another dyin dream in the land of living wealthy, to pray on
Conflicted to the grey spots
Life is painted full palette pictures with the gifting, is my pain caused
Believe it though, even in it's meaningless
I tread the water dreamfully exceeding what's eating me
I get down
I get down, it's like this, down like how
Man I black out the pressure
I fade out the sound
I get down, it's like this, down like how
How down cut your wrists down pump your fists down
I get down, it's like this, down like how
Man I black out the pressure
I fade out the sound
I get down and it's like this
Mourn into it
Another grey day reject
Another tombstone in the graveyard of respect
The [?] of my life and fuse with religion
Got all my [?] shout outs to yeah like clay pigeons
And it isn't what you envision
Would you admit if a single (intimate?) smidgeon if ever given a damn
So what's my life huh another breath taken
Water under the bridge a fool for the makin, it must be
I mean love don't trust me
Fight for it's feelin while I die in it's company
I get down and it's impossible to get up
A heart full of bricks with a mouth full of hiccups
With more dust to kick up then ambition itself
Handcuffed to the furnace of my own vision of hell
I seem dossile yeah born into the wrong child
Fight against the smiles and frowns people
I get down
I get down, it's like this, down like how
Man I black out the pressure
I fade out the sound
I get down, it's like this, down like how
How down cut your wrists down pump your fists down
I get down, it's like this, down like how
Man I black out the pressure
I fade out the sound
I get down and it's like this

Let the weight I been to black
It would never be forgot
I can't stop it I won't let this blow away</pre>
