[Frank Ocean]
My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie; my honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he's gone
Cause when we're together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

[Chorus 1]
Oh, oh you're callin me crazy sayin I'm always complainin
I tell you, just leave me alone - there you go~!
You're packing your things and, lacing your sneakers
I'm screamin get out

[Chorus 2]
But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Frank Ocean]
Sugar bunches of oats, my buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love and then it's like
Whenever it's just me and you, you know I don't wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons and when to press them, baby, dammit

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Interlude]
I told you to go, so why did you leave?
I beg you to stay, I want you to go, so why did you leave?
I told you to go, so why did you stay?
I begged you to stay, so why are you here? You gotta leave

[Frank Ocean]
Boy you know I bet that someone sins
Before we go at it again
It's just gon' happen, I don't understand it
My heart's sane but my mind's goin crazy

[Chorus 2] + [Interlude]

[Outro]
Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay</pre>
