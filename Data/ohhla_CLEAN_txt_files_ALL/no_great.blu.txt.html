Typed by: JasonTFlaco@gmail.com

-there is no greater love
yea, na, cause on the real ya'll there is no greater love
people try all the time trying to break us up
we keep it high up in the sky ya gotta take it up
-then what I feel for you
take it up take it up take it up

fucking up my mental when I think about you
in my room plotting how to start reaching out to you
cause at first the situation had me deep in doubt
but the beauty evened out the beast and I can't be without -your love
its by far the most dangerous subject to touch yet we actin like its lust yea right
will lust have you up at 5 writing a text trying to get a thought up off of your chest
and her all on your chest gotta work so you calling to rest
for a second then you call her for sex
and she there in a second and her parents are stressing
cause she missed a whole semester fucking round with this peasant
named Blu and Juilet is you the two connected as one
?fun is endless? getting drunk and fucking bitches is through
sun back with the moon to balance out how we shines on the planet
and you try to understand it but you can't cause

-there is no greater love
cause on the real ya'll there is no greater love
people try all the time trying to break us up
we keep it high up in the sky ya gotta take it up
-then what I feel for you
take it up take it up take it up

fucking up my mental when I think about you
cause the truth is I know I couldnt leave without you on my side
at the time I was feinding at her beautys
been thinking bout the beast and she can't be without -your love
plus all the drama thats included with it
ya heard the song and still rush like the foolish in it
stuck like a clueless in love with every movement she makes
even that ugly shit she do with her face
when she fussing with ya but you love it so you fuckin with her
and she knows it she just wants to make you fucking kiss and make up
you throwing out her blush stick and make up
and she dont need it anyway silk skin pretty face
horny as a devil with her little bitchy ways
but she all natural cause I dont like my titis fake
and her attitude bitchy but hey what can I say
i love it when I tell a chick to chill and give me space and she cant cause

-there is no greater love
cause on the real ya'll there is no greater love
people try all the time trying to break us up
we keep it high up in the sky ya gotta take it up
-then what I feel for you
take it up take it up take it up

fucking up my mental when I think about you
and all the little shit we used to speak about
like having kids getting married trying to lease a house
so we can buy one up so we can find one
with a little room for josulito when the time comes
plus a studio for all my people trying to find some
into inspiration like the way my girl is tied
but ill still have a mil waiting for me when my rhymes done
what a feeling when you're lifes done building
and you chilling in your house with a wife a few children
feeling like you struck a million looking at your kids like shit
this is my son this nigga came from my nuts
same feeling when you first heard times up
same feeling when I first heard comm bust
i used to love her but I found other kinds of
so I left her like I really really tried but I cant cause

there is no greater love
on the real ya'll there is no greater love
people try all the time trying to break us up
we keep it high up in the sky ya gotta take it up
then what I feel for you

no love

dracula frankenstein the wolfman the invisible man and hercules dont scare
