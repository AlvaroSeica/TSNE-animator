[Intro: Tyga]
I mean, I've been doing some thinkin, you know
And we only teenagers, but I do love you
But - I think we gotta move on - don't cry though
Listen, it's just a teenage love baby

[Tyga]
When I'm alone, all I'm thinkin 'bout is us girl
You smile, your pretty face, and them light brown curls
At first I was playin it safe, cause love is a horrible thing to waste
Straight to it, didn't hesitate
What that is? I'm Tyga, my friends they call my flyer
than your ex-man, head is flyin, I'm just bein honest
I am more, than what you can find in cereal boxes
Be my Goddess, higher than this world, I can take your body
Probably~! Bein the man is not a option, it's my hobby
So you, holdin my hand is what other girls is watchin
Pics of your prints in your locker
Put this lip gloss on and get the haters poppin lil' momma

[Chorus 2X: Evan Taubenfeld]
Teenage love (it's a teenage love)
Teenage love (it's a teenage love)
Teenage love (it's a teenage love)
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Tyga]
You called up the studio, I said about another hour
But you, refused to hear it sayin "Baby do you miss me?"
But my intentions, was play this song when I visit
You screenin our conversation everybody's tryin to listen
But we only young, infatuated sprung, more in lust
I think I'm all the above, two teenagers in love
I gave up them girls, you gave up the club
I gave you everything you wanted just because
I was waitin for Cupid to come shootin arrows through my heart
Now you wanna be apart
What'chu mean you finished? We only at the start
In the league winnin girl we come oh so far

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
That's not timid, it's too risky, I don't get it
I'm feelin dizzy, the room's spinnin, you gotta be kiddin
My teenage Mrs., you leave now, my life is ended
Damn~! My life is ended
Teenage love, it's a teenage love, it's a teenage love
Teenage love - it's a teenage love
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
Teenage love, it's a teenage love, it's a teenage love
Teenage love - it's a teenage love
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Chorus]

[Outro: Evan Taubenfeld]
Don't hurt me again {*3X*}
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again {*4X*}
