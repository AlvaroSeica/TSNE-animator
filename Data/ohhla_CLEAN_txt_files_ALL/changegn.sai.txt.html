[Intro]
Damn yo.. Yeah
Pssh! Err'body go through it, we went through it
A lil' nigga went through it (Talk about it!)

[Saigon]
Crackheads, dope fiends, young nigga with coke dreams
Vision blurred, he lookin at life through a smoke screen
Hopin, wishin, but never prayin for a better living
He never prayed cause they fucked his head up with they religion
I find it hard to believe that he's still breathin
Niggaz wanted him dead for not even regular reasons
He was ready to go like whenever, however
for whatever, the ghetto'll turn him into a rebel
He shot his first victim at 13 (WHOA!)
Did he stop there? Nigga is dirt clean? (NO!)
It was gettin worse by the minute, the hood screamed
"Somebody stop him! Please stop him before somebody pop him!"
He was wild like a Lucas, a father divine
He compares swallowin mucus to swallowin swine
He used to bustle the gun, aim right at the crowd
It was foul, see this lil' nigga run so wild

[Chorus: Saigon]
His heart was warm but then became so numb
I hope a change gon' come
Someone will send him to Kingdom Come
unless a change gon' come
That gangsta lifestyle, it ain't no fun
I hope a change gon' come
I-I-I, I hope a change gon' come
I-I-I, I hope a change gon' come

[Saigon]
By the age of 16, he huggin the strip mean
Big chains, big rings, plus he kept the kicks clean
Have the same get-rich scheme as Rich, 'Preme, Nicky and Fritz
Shit he did, it was strictly for chips
The only difference was this kid was much more violent
He used to like to rap, what a waste of some raw talent
Runnin 'round in the street like he wasn't gon' get murdered ever
When all he had to do was put a couple words together (yup)
March 24th, 1994 , his life took a turn for the worst, a brush-in with the law
The charge was attempt murder with a burner that had more
other bodies on it, there was a chance he wouldn't get off
But they dropped it to assault, sent a nigga up North
Where he started writin rhymes 'bout all the shit that he saw
From the drugs to the guns to the whores and the bums and the slums
He said a change gon' come

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
After more than six years in the beast, he get released (he out!)
Lot of his friends locked up, lot of 'em is deceased (yep)
People wonderin why he be greetin 'em sayin, "Peace"
They 'member him from before when he was considered a beast
They also said they proud of what he did with this rappin thing
They be seein his face all up in the magazine
Hearin him on the radio, but they already know
Even when he was whylin, he had a pretty heavy flow
Nowadays his lifestyle changed for the better
He the underground #1 reigning contender
From a 6 X 8 cell, to hangin with Dave Chappelle (Hahaha~!)
Gettin his giggle on, you haters go straight to hell! (Word!)
His moms tellin him to listen,
"Son, you can't afford another felony conviction
 They got you labeled as a menace to this jurisdiction
 They gon' try to come get you and stick you back in prison
 Nigga, it's your decision"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now
This kid that I'm talkin 'bout is me - Saigon!
Bustin my hammer in the streets, flippin packs
...to flippin tracks, haha! Yeah.. 
S to the A, Cordero, good look on your flick, baby!
S to the A, Yardfather shit, I kick that Yard shit all day, man
The change gon' come, baby! In hip-hop, in the world, everywhere
It's about me, The Yardfather, Saigon
Swervin, swervin</pre>
