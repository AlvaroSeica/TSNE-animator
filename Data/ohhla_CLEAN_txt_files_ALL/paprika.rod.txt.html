[Intro: Li-Mouse]
Yeah, you know, it just happens
I don't really mean to hurt nobody
Just sometimes it just comes out, youknowhatimsaying?
This be Mouse, Li-Mouse to be exact
One half of The Rodentz, check it out, yeah

[Li-Mouse]
Yo, Mouse runs with a massive weapon
Blasting them off stupid while I'm still two stepping
White boys talk shit, got something to say
Start smacking, now it's oh shit, he don't play
Now this bitch fronting, acting like she don't want nothing
You say she stunting? I say she straight cutting
Custom painted whip, fuck racing for pink slips
My life is like a poker game, the brain just thinks chips
Frito-Lays and Ruffles, you don't wanna get in a scuffle
Shut up, you get muffled while we eating fresh truffles
Nutmeg, mix it in with the eggnog
Fucking up my flow, like Vick, you'll be dead, dog
I'm setting up, scheming my plans, so don't foil
Leave you train wrecked like the face of Susan Boyle
BD and crew, talking shit, the shoe fits
He can lose it, but me, I just move shit
Out of my vision, I ain't seeing none of that crap
Clickity clacks, I spit knowledge, strictly facts
No I don't got swag, all I do is carry myself
Third eye open, so I don't lose my health
Snakes trynna bite me, always from the back
Little did they know the skills is what they lack
Did I mention? The Cno Evil is up in this, bitches
Get the Sudras, cuz now cats leaving in stitches

[Interlude: Li-Mouse]
Uh-huh, told you, that it just happened that way
Didn't really mean it, but you know, that's just what happens
Whatever, son, once again, it's Li-Mouse, I hope ya'll enjoy
But anyway, check out this, I'm about to deploy

[Li-Mouse]
Picture me, losing to a bunch of pussies, spitting shit
Leaving your brain extra, mushy and gushy
I can see your balls, dog, your pants too tight
They getting all mad, screaming, now they wanna fight
Settle down, homeboy, you might end up looking stupid
Who the hell wants to be beat up by the new kid
On the block, you know that Li-Mouse stay hot
I'm chilling with not just the kettle but the damn pot
Sitting here, and we calling each other black
Then I grabbed some crackers, just for a little snack
This is a dirty job, Mike Rowe denied
Li-Mouse stepped in and now he's the one who divide
All nature and all kinds and sorts of prediction
So you deaf muthafuckas, just shut up and listen
I'm Mighty and Dangerous, in just a Minute
So bitch don't front on me, when I try to get the digits

[Interlude: Li-Mouse]
Yeah, you know what I mean? You muthafucking cry babies
Pay attention you fucking idiots
I'm only saying this one time, you damn moron
Yeah, why don't you just check how we do shit?
Just sit back and fucking watch, son
Fucking watch, just sit back and check it out, yo

[Cno Evil]
Let's get it straight, kid, I've known you for a long while
Back when you had the spaghetti bowl hairstyle
You give Mouse the ill grill, then say 'what up' to me?
That's disrespect to the highest degree, you fucked with C
Hot breath, let me introduce you to Listerine
Big head looking like Bonk from TurboGrafx-16
I know this ain't fair, cuz you can't hip or hop
But I still smash a guitar on your face, shit ain't rock
Hiring kids from projects to battle me? Stop it
I've been through these old ass games like Tiger Electronics
You a has been like Hasbro, Twist It, Pull It, Bop It
You Little Pony, Easy-Bake Oven, is Betty Crock' it
We can destroy your life like a Jenga tower
Stack it up like Pogs, then smash it with the Slammer power
You soft like Play-Doh, dissemble you Mr. Potato Head
No brain in your skull, I saw those Lite-Brites instead
I read your Ouija board, it said you're a snitch
Looking like a Cabbage Patch Kid, I sunk your Battleship
You fuck with a Rodent, you get caught in a Mouse Trap
You ain't got a Clue, Risk your Life and try to rap
Sweet muthafucka, raised up in Candy Land
You go straight to jail with Rich "Uncle" Pennybags
You done fucked up, think about it, you know?
I'm out this bitch, I'll see you in a bit, Uno

[Chorus: Cno Evil (w/ Li-Mouse)]
