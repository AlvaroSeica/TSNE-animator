[Stretch]
Now let me start this, from out the darkness, and rip apart this
subject, nuttin but a tale 'bout the Heartless
And you'll figure that he's thinkin, "Who cares?"
But this nigga never knew the meaning of tears
Now this Little Piggy went to school and shit
And Momma Miss Piggy went to bed ("Good night!")
Now Poppa Piggy always got drunk as hell and left 
the door unlocked, and now they dead, now check it (Damn!)
Runnin home from school, frontin from his good grades
Scorin mad high for kid his age
But when he got around the way he saw a lot of commotion
And usually the neighborhood, smooth as lotion
"Oh no way!  They're in front of my crib
 I wonder what my pops done went and did"
He felt confused - yeah is this an illusion, or is it real?
Now find out from his heart the whole crap he feel
He was losin, had to hold him up on his feet
Then he saw two stretchers with blood on the sheets
Damn, it had to take him just like this
to spark this, now he feels no emotions
The kid is HEARTLESS

"In other words I'm heartless dude" --&gt; Scarface
	"In other words I'm heartless"
(repeat 4X with cutting and scratching)

[Majesty]
Fear is dead, messed up the child's head
Hate created a monster, a ruthless monster
It's a shame, who's to blame, look what they done, UHH
Now look at this kid, that's son to no one
How will he turn out, you wanna know?
Heartless, ruthless, a murder pro, UHH
[Stretch] Mind shifted, lifted another one
	  Damn another young gun, smoked when a nigga's done
[Majesty]
Moved across town, livin with his Aunt
A little shitty shack on the top of a resteraunt
Actin a fool, made his own rules
[Stretch] Down the block there's a spot where his cousin pump rocks

[Majesty]
He put him on, things went wrong, you know the song
He got strong, word is bond, UHH
Get the rugged money love it started buggin
Fresh at the hotel, with his trigger huggin
People scared to death of him the nigga brewin in ya
[Stretch] Started gettin rich doin hits in Virginia

[Majesty]
In every precinct, there's a wanter poster
Now he's known as a damn BODY ROASTER
The nigga's heartless

"In other words I'm heartless dude" --&gt; Scarface
	"In other words I'm heartless"
(repeat 4X with cutting and scratching)

[Stretch] Heartless, meanin of the wicked, with a one way ticket
	  If you stick it then your mouth be gonna lick it

[Majesty]
For no reason at all he'll put to you rest, UH
So you better wear your vest for the ones they call HEARTLESS
Or better yet stay home, cause they ain't
aimin at your chest boy, they aimin at your DOME
Trouble's on they mind, so they don't think
Drop a body flee the scene, quicker than a blink
I guess it's strain on they brain they feelin no remorse
You see what happens to your life when you're born in New York?
[Stretch] You're misused and bruised, within illusion

[Majesty]
Don't wanna blame yourself but you choosed it
Pressure on the mind overloads then you snap black
Then you start buggin (UH) trippin (UH)
Flippin like a flapjack
When the ? raises, wanna trade places
Read the papers, turn the pages
HEARTLESS
