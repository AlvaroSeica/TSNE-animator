[Intro]
Feedback back for your bad ass, yeah
As you witness I'm surrounded by 2 more emcees
Outta my war council
My rottweiler or rhymes
B-wyze a/k/a Blast
Introducing my Doberman
Of destruction
Lyrical destroyer
Dow Jonz a/k/a John Connor Of Moruturi
My war council comin smashin
Thru battle zones of microphones
Whatever goes *repeated*

[Verse 1: Dow Jonz]
Yo, my man, the rhymes I write, they be the illest
And I be fucking up careers like those of Arnold, Kimberly and Willis
You'll take the penicillin, run DMC &amp; Jay
Say I "be illin"
My crew ain't juicy, I am not cold chillin.'
I'm a super villain.
I'd even room with Dr. Doom
And we'd be killin! I'd rip a bitch in London just for one shilling.
I'm on your cable, channel X I'm causing strife
But it make me wanna holler, son, the way they do my life.
Check it !
Executives in suites eat dinner and discuss
How I can make more for us, whenever I bust
I step forth from the jungle in fatigues.
The everglades, canteen full of liquor.
I'm sitting on grenades
Little women squirming from the 12th down to 11th grades
When they see me in the magazine
Upon they wall they stick the page
But you're too young I'll take you mom
And shacked from shells and bombs
Uncle Sam make brothers Uncle Toms in Vietnam

[Chorus]
Battle two (So what you gona do ?)
Skilla-skills demandin' endonesia
Battle two (So what you gona do ?)
Skilla-skills demandin' endonesia

Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)
Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)

[Verse 2: B-Wyze]
Yo, it's +A Low Down Dirty Shame+
How I'm +Surviving The Game+
To get the +Glory+
Son this ain't no +West Side Story+
+Who's The Man+ that started with the
+Boyz In Da Hood+
And the 5 +Heartbeats+ he would
+Shuffle Hollywood+
Could it be the +King Of New York+
Up in the lights form them days in
+Crooklyn+
To them +Harlem Nights+
In this +New Jack City+
I'm the man with the +Juice+
Meet me +Uptown Saturday Night+
+Bustin Loose+
+The Mack+
The +Black Caesar+
And if +She's Gotta Have It+
I'm a +Do The Right Thing+ and please
Her
Her man got a death wish
Cause he wanna fight
But I hold a +Lethal Weapon+
On +Judgement Night+
You bring it on
MC's ain't ready for the battle
My +Posse+ will leave you
+Sleepless In Seattle+
+48 Hours+ of nuttin but +Tales From The Hood+
Gimmie +Dead Presidents Fella+ cause I'm
+GOOD+

[Chorus]
Battle zones on and on
Skilla-skillz (endonesia)
Battle zones on and on
Skilla-skillz (endonesia)

Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)
Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)

[Bridge]
One more time
YO this aaa KSUF...
And I am your only trackman
That like to think ???? been in my life, oh shit
Motherfuckers is so bitch, he brake it on
And aaah... I wanna hear Dow Jones
Ey yo Chuck, Chuck
How you doin man ?
You got your back off, and B-wyze
So he straight shit doin man
C'mon c'mon

[Verse 3: Dow Jonz]
God damn, like the 85'ers eat the ham
I'll eat up weak MC's and that means shorty and his man
My name is Dow from the clique about to die
Others call me John Conner and perhaps
I'll tell the reason why
While Hiroshima blackens up the sky
I will lounge inside my shelter as you fry
As you're incinerated
I'll come around again forget me not
I had to shine with darkness for a minute
That was hot

[Verse 4: Chuck D]
Semen in a women
From the men without hats
Get your life split up like some Kit Kats
I seem to be triple teamed
By gang green
Who don't listen
Bluntz them must be hittin
(can?t read) emission
I stress the position
At the top of the slop
Crackas be droppin a lot
Like saltines out the box
I despise singin songs in the low rider duckin cynics
Fuck 'em and those Johnny come critics

[Chorus]

Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)
Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)

Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)
Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)

Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)
Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)

Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)
Rock 'em rock rock on (endonesia)
Rock 'em rock rock on (Skilla-skillz)

[Outro]
Hot 97.5 on your dial
Word up Flip Squad, your boy Kibidy-Coo
KK Holliday
(Blowin your mind one time
Bootleg the lyrical I....murderer)
Autobiography of Mistachuck, where is that new joint ?
Where is that new joint ?  (Boo-yaa)</pre>
