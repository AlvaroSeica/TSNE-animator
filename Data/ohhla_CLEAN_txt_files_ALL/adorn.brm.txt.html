[Intro: Reek Da Villain]
Whoo!
Can't wait to taste your skin
Villain, listen - Miguel
(The Conglomerate)

[Verse 1: Reek Da Villain]
Daughter of a queen, fit for a prince
Took me from a frog to a man with a kiss
Now I'm prince charming, you my miss, darling
Life on a dice game, she my Miss All-In
Fell to the ground and it made my head crack
Know I ball like a nigga with a leg tat
Everyday without you's a major set back
And the way I adorn you, I can't accept that
Naw... I need you, this is far from optional
Get chills from the thought of some other nigga poppin' you
Hold your hand while they roll you through the hospital
I'd give you a child every day if it was possible

[Chorus: Miguel]
Ooh babe, my love
Just let my love adorn you
Please, baby... yeah
You gotta know
You gotta know
You know that I adorn you
Yeah baby...
Baby

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Mommy got a beauty, make me weak until I can't cope
Smelling like a watermelon, Neutrogena bath soap
Now remember that nervous excitement that you used to get
Blood rushin' harder, get to racin' just a little bit
More so from your first woman that you appreciated fully
If she was your first love, 'specially your first pussy
You so in tune with each other, let me inform you
Over protective with the shit we have cause I adorn you
Regulate your ex, I can't help it if he scorn, boo
Only familiar with securing wins, that's what I'm born to do
Call her that "Ain't Nothin' Better"
And focusing on what we got so we can grow together
Let's do it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: J-Doe]
You know it's hard for me to tell you the...
Way you got me feelin' baby
You know cause, 'cause I ain't really with the sucker shit
You know, but I'm trying
Girl I wanna be the only one (the only one)
Aye, but I ain't motherfuckin' stupid
Know niggaz gonna be choosing
Tyin' your ass right down, so I make sure your ass is used to
Gettin' fly shit, you know that's my bitch
When you see us, she look more rare than a diamond
Unh - you know I'm playin' on another level
I just wait and spend your rent on another Bezel
Damn...

[Chorus]</pre>
