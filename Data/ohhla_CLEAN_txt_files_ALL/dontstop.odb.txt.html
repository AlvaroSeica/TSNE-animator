[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastrd]
Eastside, westside
Yo, Dr. Dre, yo, Snoop
Yo, E-40, yo, Too $hort
Yo, Scarface, when the pimp is back on the set
Is the pimp back on the set, man?

[Chorus 2X: singer]
It's Dirty in the morning, Dirty at night
It's Dirty on the east, it's Dirty on the westside
It's Dirty down south, it's Dirty up top
And that Ol' Dirty party, you know the party don't stop

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, where my ladies at, in the club with the Baby Phat
I'm in the Mercedes black, with crazy gats
I keep the club pumped, everybody shake your ass
Like Mystikal baby, shake it fast
This is for my models and thugs, with the bottle of bub
My little man with the hollows of snub
You can catch me by the speaker, got the flavor for the fever
Five minutes later, flavor for little sweeter
Cause we in the best dressed, the fly shit
Ready to die shit, Brooklyn Bedstuy shit
With all my live tricks, with nice guys, petite waist with nice eyes
Call me Dirty: mister nice guy
Never catch me alone, without the chrome
It's like catching ya dog, without the bone
The only thing that take me out my zone
If the party ain't pumping, off or I ain't home

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now that I'm here to correct things, don't expect lanes
Stretch cane, sit on the block, until the rest came
We all know stress pain, or I need exchange for jet planes
Rockin' vests, over my chest chain
I defeat champ, drama keep me peeps amp
My team on every corner, like the street lamp
Always be the first to set it, my thirst is pathetic
You farting like you the cup, shits, forget it
I'm for the first in every verse, then edit
Only way you need me, this called was her's or medic
Keep my shit rocking, peep my click knocking
Every day in the streets, we keep popping
Sensation in your toes, make you move your feet
My crew's in jeeps, move with the baddest freaks
My news is deep, you can't get close to me
Everybody in the east and west, you with me?

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 8X:: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Eastside, back it up
Westside, back it up

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Bitches you down with me, niggas is down with me
Ya'll down with me, you down with me
Come on, you down, with me, come on, come on, come on
Come on, baby come on, baby come on, baby come on
Come on, come on, baby come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby come on, baby come on
Baby come on...</pre>
