[Hell Razah]
I keep it ghetto where its grimy grimy
You know how Bed-Stuy be throwing them block parties
Building with God Bodies
Before lardy dardy, before John Gotti
Before Biggie Smalls, BK been lively
My project army Red Hook been behind me
I spit jewels shiny, bright as Illuminati
The black owls see the white inside Colin Powell
Hitler and George Bush, thats why you acting Nazi
I be a Child of Israel, this young Haile Selassie
Ghetto Government, Ark of the Covenant</pre>
