I'm punchin' a clock, carryin' my lunch in a box
So don't ever assume that my life is something it's not
Shit, I got a 9 to 5, dispite the fact that I'm as live
As any jerk-off cat that's signed to Jive
My boss is trying to drop me out my tree house
For at least three hours a day, he's chewin' me out
For two to three thou. a month, they don't pay me enough
To spend my work day, taking this stuff this jerk say
I ain't workin' over time
I'm tryin' to hear my name on MTV news up, in Kurt Loader's lines
So I work over rhymes, and I'm behind in my paper work
I'm late for work, cause I spend my nights chasin' skirts
My measly checque don't make it worth the stress
That hurts my chest, not to mention I'm emmersed in debt
To the top of a turtle neck, pissin' an moanin'
But why should anyone listen to me, when I don't listen to no one
Consider this as an omen, I could go beserk
At any moment, like a mail man fed up with postal work
I went from happy to nasty like a Bi-Polar jerk
To shoot em down the lounge with the fine foldgers perks

Punch in, Punch out, Lunch in, Lunch out
I've been lookin for a building with nice window to jump out
Feelin' self destructive? Sick of the daily grime?
Lately I feel disruptive, and I think its mailman time
*beat changes*
Day in, day out, It seems like theres no way out
I pulled the twelve gauge out and shot off twenty-eight rounds
And watch the pellets spread out, killin my associates
My boss is gonna get it now, and find out what Postal is

"Good morning Mr. Schwartz" "Good morning Louis
You've been late three times this month already, I believe this is the fourth"
"I don't want you misinformed, it's probably more
You're not counting the times I didn't sign the time sheet on the lobby floor"
"Right, well if you feel your jobs secure, keep it up then"
"Apparntly someone hasn't had his coffee and he needs a muffin"
"Perhaps you need a breif discussion, a policy refresher
And wheres your progress note?" "Oh, I forgot that on my dresser"
"Well if this case is too much pressure, we can ease the tension
Starting today, you forfeit your pay and take a weeks suspension
You really should prioritize, you can't stay up all night
Like some college guy, bathing in beer like it's a party life"
"Look, I'm sorry I've been screwin up
I know I got the perfect job, but I've been working hard on this music stuff"
"Well Louis, you need a good job, and I know this one can be tough
But rapping isn't real work, and it can be just as hard"
"Man, what you trying to stop be from being a star?"
"You don't even play an instrument" "Yo I don't need a guitar to season these bars"
"Alright well settle down now, theres no need for alarm, try an remain calm"
"Or, I'll light this fuckin' office up with guns, fire, and napalm"

You're just another asshole, who wants to see me dressed up in my dads clothes
Working underpaid until I'm that old
As far as that goes, you'll never live to see it take place
I've brought a little present for you in my aftershave case

Punch in, Punch out, Lunch in, Lunch out
I've been lookin for a building with nice window to jump out
Feelin' self destructive? Sick of the daily grime?
Lately I feel disruptive, and I think its mailman time
Day in, day out, It seems like theres no way out
I pulled the twelve gauge out and shot off twenty-eight rounds
And watch the pellets spread out, killin my associates
My boss is gonna get it now, and find out what Postal is</pre>
