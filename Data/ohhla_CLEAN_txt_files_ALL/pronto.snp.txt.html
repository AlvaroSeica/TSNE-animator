And we need you to move like pronto
Like expeditiously
Matter of fact Soulja Boy, holler at 'em nephew
Ya dig

[Chorus - Soulja Boy]
Pronto
You know that's how we ball
She dancing on my draws with my back against the wall
S.O.D. boys got our money sitting tall
While your money sitting small
And we make a phonecizzall cizzall
I'm calling all my boys
They're going to bring the noise when we hit the dancefloor
My team hardcore all the girls do adore
'Bout to do the game right til my feet get sizzore sizzore

[Soulja Boy]
Dip on the scene make the haters say damn it
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em hottest rapper on the planet
Your girl love me and I know you can't stand it
Got them [?!] got your boy bad mannered
Your girl go hard like [?!]
Soldier number one but I ain't talking 'bout the combo
S.O.D. boss yeah I'm the head honcho
Walk inside the club I need VIP pronto

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Get it in, get it out
Turn it up, turn it out
Big Snoop Dogg and Soulja Boy
Told ya boy, in ya mouth
Make it bang, make it bounce
Break it up, take it out
Nigga what you talking 'bout?
Snoop Dogg walk it out
Go to work, do the jerk
Do it 'til your head hurt
We the west, just the turf
Known throughout the universe
Superman and kryptonite
All on the same mic
Send us some bad bitches like

[Chorus]

[Soulja Boy]
Mic check 0, 1, 2, 3
I don't freestyle cause my style ain't free
Lyrical criminal most about internationally 
Soulja no limit but I ain't talking 'bout Master P
I'm in my tour bus a lot of groupies in back of me
Every photoshoot interview videoshoot or magazine
My flow is so sick that number one up on i-tunes
My flow be killing you quicker than the fucking swine flu

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
All black hooded up
Nigga we can get it up
Yeah you can set it up cause we will never let it up
And I'll do it 'til you get enough
And I'll leave you dead and red and stuff
What it do, what it is
I see you haven't read enough
This is the life I chose for me and this is the way I chose to be
A lot of fools is cold to me but that's just the way it's supposed to be
Never went against the grain
Always bang 20 gauge
Stand for something dawg or you gon' fall for anything but
Later for that
Yeah I got my swag back
I'm with the Soulja Boy
A nigga bad back
But in GCs and TCs we in the VIP
Blowing on some [?!] purple trees
Jerking these
Working these cute bad bitches
I think they Vietnamese
We gon' get them for thier cheese
Break it down, spread it round
My pound
Put it in the air right now like pronto

[Chorus]</pre>
