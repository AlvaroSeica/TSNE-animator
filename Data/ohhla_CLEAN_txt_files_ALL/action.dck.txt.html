"look baby I'm sorry"

[Inspectah Deck]
Fear Allaine, code name is Sting
Word on the streets no brother can hang
Unless you got figures six digit in range
She pull out the nine and shoot down ya game
She walk, she Glide like Peggy Fleming
Deadly Venom, she was able to possess men
Dressed in the latest fashion
Complexion black like the word itself
Well connected with major players, ballers and high rollers
The boldest cat alive couldn't hold her
Amazin how she work those hips
Merciless, got money for a new whip off the first kiss
World trips, wine and shell fish
Wanted all, claimin' her love was worth it
She work a nurse gig, night time she strip
As she hollow, what you workin' with

[Chorus: sampled singer]
I want Action, I'm a lady on the move
I need Action, I've got no time to lose
I like Action, and if you try it my way
I'll love you more than any words could say

[Inspectah Deck]
Show N Prove, baby girl stays on the move
Pull up with the powder blue six with the twos
Fresh off the boat cruise, opentel shoes
I go fool for a moment with you
I see you shinin', is it the chrome or the jewels
Schoolin' all chickens who don't know the rules
Give it up for free, can't handle the bule
You bad, you can have any man you choose
We know who's who, I'm rollin' just like you
But payin' for ya love is what I just can't do
Fellas come strong, lame attempts are worthless
She like a fire thats lit and she burn quick
World trips, wine and shell fish
Wanted all, claimin' her love was worth it
She work a nurse gig, night time she strip
As she hollow, what you workin' with

Chorus

[Inspectah Deck]
Atlantic City, Torino spend G notes on Rulette
Trippled the bet, broke casino
This the dude she came with on the low
Walked off with the breifcase full of dough
Plus he got hit with the drinks for free
Complementary with the presidential sweet
She tempts men to eventually to come inside
But they gotta spend the entrance fee
Next morn', wakin' up at the yawn
You find ya clothes, ya money and ya car is gone
Cry alone, read the note by the phone
Sayin', "call Tyrome if ya need a ride home", that bitch

[sampled woman]
Save ya breath
Don't say a word
You can't tell me nothin'
I ain't already love
I've got eyes and I'd like to see what it is your gonna do for me

Chorus

[Outro: man (Kim)]
Yo hello (nigga what you want?)
I wanna talk to you (I've got no time for this)
Why not? (You've been callin' me all day)
Oh you must be with that nigga Kim (what!?)
he used to whoop your ass (well I was put off dog)
(he bought me Fendi) yeah (Gucci) so (Chanel) and (Coach)
(And nigga you ain't bought me nothin')
