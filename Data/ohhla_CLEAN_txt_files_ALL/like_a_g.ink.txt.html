[Chorus: Travis Porter]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough till there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough till ya bank done fold

I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me

Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)

[Kid Ink]
Uh, feelin so good
All the way out the hood
Now I gotta view that can see the whole city
Swear momma raised her a real go-getter
(yeah)
Itll be okay
Tell em that im so LA
West up
Shoe box money in the dresser
Yeah, thats what a G showed me
I know you can smell the OG on me
And shawty trynna get another drink on me
Anything in the world for free baby

[Chorus]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough till there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough till ya bank done fold

I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me

Yeah (yeah)

[Kid Ink]
Just trynna have a fun time
Middle finger up to the one time
Fist to my niggas on the front line
Shades out, we gon' shine
Yeah, see us
Just ball in my sneakas
They ain't gettin money like a pre-nun
See it goin around, tea cups
G thing, Travie got her in her G-string
And I could make her sing like T-Pain
Let me give you the game now

[Chorus]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough till there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough till ya bank done fold

I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me

Yeah (yeah)

[Kid Ink]
Live by the G code
On another level get a cheat code
Keep it 100, c note
Party everywhere that we go
Oh uh alright
Bat gang, up all night
Nigh night night
See, everything ain't what it seem, but

[Chorus]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough till there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough till ya bank done fold

I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me

Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
