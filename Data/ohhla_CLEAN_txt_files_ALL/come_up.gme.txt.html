[The Game]
My nigga Funeral Fad told me back in oh-three
rap ain't nuttin but cash money bitches, foreign cars and trees
Cristal by the cases, bad bitches by the flocks
and I know I promised my niggaz I'd never leave the block; but
Shit changes - I done been through six Ranges
Hand on the Eagle, yeah I got them Mike Vick fingers
Throwin bullets on par with the accuracy
Hit your whole faculty, like ain't nobody jackin me
Before you do, you be layin in a box
while Ja(da) +Kiss That Ass Goodbye+ {*MUAH} L.O.X. 
First shot leave them niggaz in shock
That second shot, that's when that body drop (you heard me?)
And niggaz still askin 'bout +Detox+
I'll tell you if you tell me who killed 'Pac; aight then~!
I'm at this Pacquiao fight then, with Tyson
The way he's stickin and movin the knife, Floyd might win

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Lifestyle]
Yeah, uhh
Testarossas, keep an extra toaster
It's Hub City finest, they respect the mostest
My nigga Game do that, my nigga Tyga do that
Heard about the new cat, I whipped the Range through that
I'm in Toronto, DeMar got a condo
Sittin courtsides with Drake, Hector and Rondo
Bitches know my name, it's Lifestyle, she fuck with that
Dick too big like my lifestyle, you fuck with that?
Poppin champagne, we do the damn thing
Standin on the couch, it's money Game, that's the campaign
Big in my pocket, Obama on my wrist
At the Ronald Reagan Airport, yeah, I'm on my shit
Louis Vuitton luggage peanut butter with the red wheels
Started when the +RED+ album dropped, I'm gettin head still
In the club, lookin past you niggaz
These bitches gas them niggaz, Drizzy ask them niggaz

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
