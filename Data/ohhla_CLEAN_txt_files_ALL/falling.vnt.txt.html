[Vents]
We embracing the nonsense, possible life without consequence
You on your own, there's no god here watching us
Without an obvious purpose or meaning
It's worthless to live or else we're like, cursed with the freedom
to think for myself, so I drink by myself
And cop blame for the pain that I bring to myself
It's the insanity of man's reality
We're living in a shopping mall with plans to expand to the galaxy
Becoming awesome and deforming the turf
Extorting the earth and taking her for all that it's worth
We divorced from the means of life
Nature is tormented and treated awful like Jesus Christ
It's not a call for forgiveness
I'm just the author and witness of all this shit in like, all of its sickness
It's the symphony of living in the last days
Life is hard, but embrace that bitch before you part ways

[Chorus]
Let's get it on man, we could go toe for toe
Blow for blow, then we could find out who's falling - down
Round for round and pound for pound
Let's get it on man, then we could find out who's falling - first
Let's see who really wants this worse
Let's step up and then we could find out who's falling - through
Get your whole crew, eyes on you
The truth is motherfucker, I could see you falling

[Vents]
Before we falling apart, everybody want to feel completeness
So we coming together before we leaving in pieces
Staying close in the most freezing weather
We could have a moment of silence and just breathe together
in the emptiness, the nothingness and the uncertain
The insignificance of me as just one person
I'm one version of human being
Billions of them on a big rock made up of blue and green
We've all got the same stupid dream
I'm all alone in the city, best friend's a computer screen
We gave birth to a cancerous growth
But if it bleeds, we could kill it coat hanger approach
Abandon all hope, the world keeps hands on my throat
Me and reality about to make plans to elope
Sold my soul for a very small portion of gold
and spent Sunday on the floor with the porcelain bowl

[Chorus]

[Vents]
Vandalism's like a plague, eyesore, everywhere that I roll
corporate marketing want to stare at your soul
Intimate details of what's buried beneath
Promising to fill my lack, temporary relief
I'm John Joseph, listen, show gratitude, focus
Demanding respect, but your attitude hopeless
Cancer, cirrhosis, holocaust, homicide opus
Crops get demolished like locusts
Policeman come, no respect for the pork
They all rotten right down to their molecular core
When I was young, used to respect the power of violence
to entertain, repulse, terrify, excite us
It's horrorcore, footsteps thunder up the corridor
Dad had a bad day, later on he's sorry for
the beating you get, the belt on your rump
Your feet on the edge, where everything will tell you to jump
