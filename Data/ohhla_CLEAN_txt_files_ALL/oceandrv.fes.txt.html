[Chorus: Lot-a-Nerv]
We keep it rolling, the toasters
Stay by the scrotum
Bounce in the lo-lo wit ya hoe, getting low, I'm the shit
Hey yo, let's go, 2 Fly, T fly, we fly
That's why we ride, no why, cuz I told 'em I'm the shit

[Fes Taylor]
Mats over you face, that's how we hide the shooters
Driving by, M-I-A, riding scooters
It's Wag Willie Moe shit, I got 'em really open
I'm like Billy Ocean, I crack the Phillie open
Milli smoking, Mickey beats get me a freak
So I can titty stroke it, you know a Georgie peach
Meet the rotten apple, baby baby, I put it down
Like I got to tackle, you see my chain swing?
Hang like my main ring, bells through New York
Might as well be named king, hell, haters do talk
See me in the grey Benz, eliminated fake friends
Tints like the jack sent, you can see me anyway
Sting ray, put them cig' away, we getting bigger pay
Niggas say, wish me like Specman, sent away
I stay at the lows, a condom when the code red
Get gwap, bags I stuff 'em like they was bronzehead

[Chorus 2X]

[Fes Taylor]
Hahaha, I laugh at you haters, we major
We was front paging, Staten Island Advance
Koch Records advance, put it in our hands
Try to cop, ten thousand grams, take care of my fam
Damn, what's in a jam, no traffic, flow mastered
Out of this world, I flow past it
Like, I'm so futuristic, they ain't used to this shit
Worth a couple dollars, add up my wrist wit
Chain like frozen river, call it a dip stick
You know I serve you orders, I need a quick flip
Montana prices, Miami vices
Can cause a family crisis, Mickey Mice snitch
Snitch, yo glow, I'm in a speed boat
Flow motion in the ocean, like when I stroke yo
Bikinis and thongs, see me like the TV is on
Make a wish, like a genie and palm, nigga

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
