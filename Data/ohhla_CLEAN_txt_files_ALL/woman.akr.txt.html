[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
One day when I was seventeen, I seen this hunny 'round my way
The way the hips and the ass looked, brightened my day
I said "God damn!", you know I had to step to it
Cold, lickin my lips on some pretty boy shit
I said "excuse me baby doll, but I like your style
What you say that we connect and straight get buck wild?
I got that bomb shit that make you want to stay in the house
won't you (what?) slip me your math so I can turn that ass out"
She said "yo, I won't flaunt my ass like Adina Howard
Get fucked in the shower and end up pregnant by some coward
I don't get down like that, I'm on some grown woman shit
Staying mentally and physically fit, livin legit"
For my immature ears that shit was too profound
I said "whatever hun, I catch you on the next go 'round"
She said "that mentality you carry 'round is sick
Only a dumb bitch will stay in the crib 'cause of a dick" (what?)

[Chorus]
"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X
"Hold up your hands if you do understand"
"Woman" - 13X

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Yo, check it
A month or two later seen the girl in the train
She didn't recognize my ass, she had some shit on her brain
But yet and still (yo), you know I had to step to it
Cold, lickin my lips on some pretty boy shit
"What's that playin on your walkman love?? Come on rewind it
Some R&amp;B bullshit - what 'Criminal Minded'?
Honey dip you gots to be the girl on my dreams
Come on what's the deal hun, is you down with my team?"
I was hopin she was with it 'cause the hunny was hot
She said "what you got to offer, I ain't already got?"
I remembered that the sexual approach didn't work
So I had to turn soft not to look like a jerk
Said "baby, let me take you from this trife ass ghetto
Be your man, hold your hand, frolickin through the meadow
I could satisfy your wants, fantasies and wishes
Buy you cars, buy you jewels, even handle your dishes"
She said "hold it right there, 'cause that ain't my plan
Every nigga want to take you to a fantasy land
So keep walkin, that shit you talkin, nigga end it
A brother that's with me gots to live codependent"

[Chorus]
"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X
"Hold up your hands if you do understand"

"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X
"Hold up your hands if you do understand"

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
By the age of 21 yo, I had my shit together
Seen hunny in the winter in the park rockin leather
Yo fuck this, you know I got to step to her
No more lickin my lips, I'm more down to Earth
I said "excuse me lady, can I get a bit of your time?
I got some shit to tell you that I know will ease your mind
And the shit that's on my mind is not materialistic
My outlook on life is much more realistic
She said "I'm impressed with the change, yo I am
Should of had your shit together early on in the jam
She landed a peck on my grill and said she had a man that's chill
And life was more than lookin good in Tommy Hil
One real woman that I could not pull
Drivin off in a Beemer pumpin "Paid In Full"
If you fittin this description and you ain't no ho
Then you's a real woman love and you runnin the show, come on

[Chorus]
"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X
"Hold up your hands if you do understand"

"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X
"Hold up your hands if you do understand"

"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X
"Hold up your hands if you do understand"
"Woman" - 10X

"Hold up your hands if you do understand"
"Hold up your hands if you don't worry or you're fine, go" - 3X</pre>
