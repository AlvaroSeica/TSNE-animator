This gorilla music, some'ing to ride to
They done let me loose, I suggest you call the zoo
We getting gorilla money, my monkeys making cake
Southside orangatang, and I swang and bang with my bathen apes
This gorilla music, some'ing to ride to
They done let me loose, I suggest you call the zoo
We getting gorilla money, baboons on the run
Southside orangatang, and I swang and bang in my Air Force 1's

[E.S.G.]
Chop you up like the Eddy films, y'all lil' boys ain't ready for him
I'm Pro Tools y'all analog, safe to say that I'm above them
Navy Seal from the neighborhood, test me dog I wish you would
On your grind means on your grits, I guess you could say we from the woods
Call the zoo keeper this beast loose, two or three karats on each tooth
Don't make me go rake a roof, and dump ya ass in the trunk of my coupe
Riding low and I'm ducking scanners, Texas through that Louisiana
Hell yeah I'll admit it, that I'm a gorilla but I don't like bananas
I like banana clips, (why) cause they so extended
I came to take the game over, but it wasn't intended
Contraband, in the back of my van
I know the Interstate, like the back of my hand
Yeah I-10 I-12, what about that I-20
Cats down here we independent, got the bread if we wanna ride Bentley
On chrome it's on, stucko built home
Southside gorilla, backstreet King Kong yeah

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
On the grind still mashing, game's been missing some real action
Offense was still lacking, back to run it like I'm Phil Jackson
Bring out the ring I'ma take it home, I ain't Caesar this ain't Rome
I don't give a damn I'ma take the throne, this sell about three million ringtones
Y'all ain't real y'all so fake, so in the hood it's no respect
E.S.G. I'm like a referee, don't act up or get hit with a tech
We smoking that heavy kush, trigger finger cooler than Reggie Bush
One big bird bout to have a lil' bird, come on girl and get ready push
That means I make two out of one, don't understand then you are dumb
Southside that's where me from, never leave the crib without me gun
Me uzi weighs a ton, your groupies ate my cum
I'm in my cell with no weapon, I'ma make me one
Go 'head and send two blunts, big dog like Desin Young
Better yet I'm like T.O., cause the whole team against me huh
Started off at the bottom of the pack, lost it all then I got it right back
Boys out here wanna pop it like that, once you hit the button it drop the top on the Lac

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Southside flame spitter, better keep your dame with ya
Matter fact my mans'll get her, next my whole clan'll to hit her
Yes I'm a wig splitter, we ride on our enemies
See I'll admit, I probably took me a couple ki's
But I'da been robbed too, so I guess that's even game
That's why I been at the range, making sure I got even aim
Bleed ya mayn blood ya mayn, bomber got me thugging mayn
Boys in this rap game are clones, they be dubbing mayn
From New Jersey to Albuquerque, I'ma be the next that y'all gon see
From the S.U.C. to the T-O-P, out the B-O-G what you know bout me
What you know bout E know bout we, Southern hip-H-O-P
This my year let's get that clear, I'm a straight gorilla stop hating on me
