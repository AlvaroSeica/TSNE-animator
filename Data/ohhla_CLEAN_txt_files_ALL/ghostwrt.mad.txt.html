     "Mad Skillz" "On the real"
  "I'll probably make more money off your album than you" (Repeat 3x)

	"I'm want to tell you once, and only once"

First of all, I ain't even want to make this shit
There's a lot of rap cats out here faking the shit
I'm a ghostwriter, I'm the cat that you don't see
I write hits for rappers you like and charge 'em a fee
Yo don't get me wrong dog, it's the cheddar that counts
But fuck that nigga ______ cause his fucking check bounced
You thought ______ your single was hot?
I wrote that shit five minutes in a parking lot
I'm the one that your man ______ had to go and get
Cause he smoked too much lye, couldn't write his own shit
Now ______ A&amp;R, he on my answering machine sick
Hollaring in my phone, "Skillz, can you write to this?"
Sure, for stacks, nigga, I make your act bigger
But fuck ______ and his whole label cause I ain't never get my plaque, nigga
Jadakiss told y'all cats and that's that
Y'all have a ASCAP or get your ass capped

   "Mad Skillz" "Ghost writer, and for the right price
                 I can even make yo shit tigher" --&gt; Jay Z (Repeat 3x)
	"When my pen hits the paper, awwww shit!" --&gt; Kane

Now that fool ______ can't flow, but his crew is sick
Cause he got long dough, so wait til you hear his new shit
I did two songs for ______ til they dough got straight
And even ______ from the West Coast owe me some pape
Remember the little kids, the one that was in ______ group?
I'm the reason you though they lil raps was so cute
I had a hundred songs on the Billboard list
Ask again dog, how I got your deal on my wrist
I did done NBA cats and NFL
But I stopped in '97 cause they shit don't sell
Now ______ paid up cause she was owing me stacks
Who in the hell you think had that chicken flowing like that?
I hate writing for ______ cause he take too long
Crying about the price, I hit him with two fucking songs!
Ran up in ______'s office and wrecked his staff
Cause it's been two years and dog ain't paid the second half

   "Mad Skillz" "Ghost writer, and for the right price
                 I can even make yo shit tigher" --&gt; Jay Z (Repeat 3x)
	"When my pen hits the paper, awwww shit!" --&gt; Kane

So if you just signed, trust me dog, you can't touch it
Don't ask your label for Skillz, cause that ain't in your budget
Y'all cats parlay for chips, I mingle for mills
I turn your whole album into a single deal
I stopped writing for ______ cause that fool don't get it
Looking long sessions and he punching every five minutes
Where my ones, nigga? What the fuck I look like?
And his man ______ got mad cause he couldn't get the hook right
I spit ______ and we don't see eye to eye
So I feel like Lee took his Rollie up in BMI
I'm the one that gave ______ his brand new sound
I did his last two albums without even writing 'em down
And for ______ from the South, dog you shook
Stop bouncing on stage nigga like you wrote that hook
You favorite rappers' songs? I put the flames in it
Y'all keep fucking around, I'm a put this back out with your names in it

   "Mad Skillz" "Ghost writer, and for the right price
                 I can even make yo shit tigher" --&gt; Jay Z (Repeat 3x)
	"When my pen hits the paper, awwww shit!" --&gt; Kane
