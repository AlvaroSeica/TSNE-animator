Song:   Dissatisfied Bring
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Jim Kelly]
I choose to write about the image of life, not just to live it
And think the words will tell and our kids were money driven
Been in debt for decades, still the streets claiming our children
Fourteen with chrome gats, and they kill, was his attention
Big man, what you say to that, plus he off the dipper
Though I question where your parents at, you right, yea, I get with ya
Streets vicious, but the hook don't get no something like the fiends
Only one of them white, the only other's money green
only one feels hard, the other goes a little further
For one, a fiend steals, the other's body found murdered
I'm in the age with getting money, desperados
Where grown men school the youngings and mean El Dorados, follow

[Chorus 3X: Jim Kelly]
As the hail gets heavier, people grow blinder
Tears keep falling, smiles grow wider
Life's for the living, my God, I'mma live it
Dissatisfied bring about the change and I'm wit it

[Jim Kelly]
I'mma write about me lunching, hail in abundance
Niggas they be swelling, but, really they don't want it
I wish that I was closer to my moms, as a man
I can rock the planet Earth with my number one fan
Introduce her to my girlfriend, travel, we can plan
But my girl is untangible, and don't know who I am
Some laugh at your anger, try to place your chamber
Say they got love, switch and treat you like a stranger
Drugs won't change her, drinks won't ease him
Mix won't sustain her, hugs won't seize him
Direction will increase and expand it with a breath
Instead of killing every brain cell, stressing to the death
I'm a hard time specialist, street cred avengelist
As hell gets harder, I say that I can handle it

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
