Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You never thought that you'd ever get caught
With your hand up in the cookie jar
Playing spades with the devil
Now, boy, why'd you have to go and do that for?

See, you better stop your bluffing now
You know they make up the rules
You think you playing the game
Now, brother, you played the fool
They gon' play you for a fool

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
Must be a mistake, Lord take me back

Know it ain't right sometimes
But we running all through my mind
I know it ain't right
Don't believe it when they say justice is blind

Oh, there's something awful in the way
You've been working all on my nerves
And I've been thinking every day
I'm gonna give them what they deserve
They gon' get what they deserve

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
Said, if I die before I wake
Well if I die before I wake
It's got to, got to, got to be a mistake, Lord take me back

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I know it got to be a mistake, Lord take me back

Ooh, take me back
Whoa, Lord take me back
Ooh, you got to take me back

I don't need this, I don't deserve it
It ain't my fault, ain't nobody perfect
This ain't justice, and I didn't do it
They just talking, but they can't prove it

Gimme a chance, start over again
All I want is a different end
Start it over, over again
Do it over again, do it over again, start it over again</pre>
