Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro - Pusha T]
Oh boy
She want a dope boy
She want to throw bands on her pole dance
No text drive on that 2 door
She want to stunt with me I'm an old man
Oh God my IG is like IV to this lifestyle
I buy this shit, take a pic
And you OD on my life files

[Verse 1 - The-Dream]
Shawty get it (get it)
Do it big, Do it good
Work it like a girl should
Work it good (work it good)
Bring it back (bring it back)
Tell the DJ bring it back
Let me touch it, fuck it baby
Tell your man he ain't getting it back
Shawty is so ratchet, baby I'm so ratchet
You so bomb with that, I got to have it
I got to have it, like a 9 I got to blast it
So fine I got to grab it, she on mine

[Chorus]
I got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
[X4]
(I love)
Now keep that booty rolling that
Keep that pussy poppin like that
Imma keep these bandz poppin like that

[Verse 2 - The-Dream]
Up in that six hundred
You ain't even seen it
Touchin on it, rubbin on it
Girl you got me feenin
All about her money
And I'm all about my money
Million dollar babies plus alimony
First a nigga save you
(Then a nigga grave you)
And ain't nobody got time for that
So it's best just to pay ya
Thirteen cars I don't need nothing else
Just this booty on my lap
And this gold on my neck

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Big Sean]
The way you do got me very very very happy
She stare at me while I'm starin' at it
I'm a young sexy ass charismatic-ass
Gorgeous face-ass havin ass nigga
That she love in her panty hose
She need this dick like its antidote
That pussy is a work of art painted by Michael Angelo
I wake up the pussy in cantelope
Then she made me fuck my appetite
Fuckin so hard Ima remember this in the afterlife
I tell her slob on my knob
Like its corn on the cob
She keep goin oh my god
And my broad is so bad I came here from the back
All my favorite girls got my initials as tats
Finally Famous she throw this set up
Like Sororities and Frats niggaz can't tell me shit but congrats

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Pull up to that traffic light
Stars bright wanna touch her
Gotta get her to the spot
Oh shit I might love her
Straight up out of med school
Could be my baby momma</pre>
