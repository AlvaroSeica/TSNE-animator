Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Tech N9ne]
Just another piece that I wrote, ya know what I'm sayin'
'cause this beat just wanted me to write it

Livin like I'm dying tomorrow, ain't no time for no sorrow
throw on my platinum mavoda, rob a gram on my collar
Spray Lucciano Suprana, holla at a mamma who's nanas lover
hot like carne asada scholar with a bra like my tacara balla
I got a few dollas, I'm do wella my fatha taught us to follow Qu'ran and not Osama Bin Lada
My momma was not a bud of Islam, but God is her water
so why does the sickness got her like llama just shot her
Goose faba wusa, I gotta get out of this ra ra and fly to hana
lu-lu inside a grata, bulu in five lamatas
no yada yada, they ride on this ride and bob ya then swallow
sun goddess the color of Shaba
Then I popped a bottle of Mascota, run away on my Yamaha
vamanos I promisa I'm never no one to be monita-d
by the blue colla coppa, we call em Erik Astrata
cha cha, got a wad in my Levis and a nigga neva got ta borrow

[Krizz Kaliko - Chorus]
I'm livin' like I'm dyin' tomorrow, so I gotta do a lot of livin' today
I think I'm gonna drown in a bottle, and party like I'm thinkin' bout goin today
I'm seein lots of pretty women, so you know I'm goin in
They gon' blow this whole world up, so Imma party until then

[Kutt Calhoun]
Man I party harder than Nitty and Gucci, Louie with Henny
like I'm dying when I'm on one taking none of them with me
as sure as my name is Bloody Kutty Cal
you can picture me partyin like its going outta style
I, I feel like I'm the best who done did it, most under rated and hated
but if I die than so be it, then in my head I'm the greatest
It ain't a bitch I ain't christened
see the estate I've inventioned and if I die my eulogy would be held at the Kemper man
I've done smoke, I done drank and popped my pills to extremities, still do
Every now and then I pop more than Yosemite
keep my foes and my enemies and the ones who pretend to be
close to me, cause honestly there the ones who will hinder me
So hence forth remember me, this voice is fittin to be his choice of energy, by him I mean all men
Party like its 1999, smoke my wood tip wine, givin all my thanks to god then saying Amen

[Krizz Kaliko - Chorus]
I'm livin' like I'm dyin tomorrow, so I gotta do a lot of livin' today
I think I'm gonna drown in a bottle, and party like I'm thinkin' bout goin' today
I'm seein lots of pretty women, so you know I'm goin' in
They gon' blow this whole world up, so Imma party until then

[Ubiquitos of Ces Cru]
Till summers end and the winter comes
Till grey days turn to yellow ones
I stay grindin' for mine I tried to tell them once -
to travel to the moon you got to face the elements
and battle any goon you gotta cage the elephants
It's elementary I speak with a certain elequence
I smoke hella blunts a habit I've been develop since;
I was a young boy, playin' the silver ball
See 'em stand, feel 'em fall
Metallica, kill 'em all
Huh, livin' like this is my last moment;
but a moment could last forever, snap a picture and na-cole it
Huh do what ever ya gone, sip on your glass
hold it up, hit the side on mine get to tippin it back, go in
Huh, so many days we were sittin low
better get busy livin' till the day you givin in and you get to go where sinners go
Pull in the cash, and then spend it slow
better make it fast but them should know
matter no money yo, it's all expendable

[Krizz Kaliko - Chorus]
I'm livin' like I'm dyin tomorrow, so I gotta do a lot of livin' today
I think I'm gonna drown in a bottle, and party like I'm thinkin' bout goin today
I'm seein lots of pretty women, so you know I'm goin' in
They gon' blow this whole world up, so Imma party until then

[Godemis of Ces Cru]
Hold your breath count to three Ima kill it
killa commitee, city chairmen, strapped with a gramma
glock and the trigger, bitch, a hair pin
Three round burst, I aim it at your brain
spit it when cock it I kiss so they call it, Sara Jane
Livin' like I'm going down tomorrow
sit down and drown in a bottle, go out and get anotha bottle;
I don't lead I don't follow, if I don't eat I get hollow
I don't even play lotto, see Chief I need every dollar
Ya'll don't see me with a model or rockin a lotta product
I don't smoke like I wanna, I'm stretching this marijuana
Fuck it I call it karma, if I wake up in nirvana
blood is thicker than water, the mud is even more shallow
I live in the moment and part of every opponent who pass
but I put the petal to the metal I got both feet on the gas
This could be the last verse that I'm writing like it or not
everybody's taking to rob and they puttin' you right in a box</pre>
