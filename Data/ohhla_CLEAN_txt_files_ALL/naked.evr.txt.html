[Everlast]
Blue sky, devil eye, cyanide, suicide
Double down, let it ride, lose your money, bruise your pride
Easy came, easy went, ghetto slums, tenements
Things look real Old Testament, blame it all on the President

[Chorus: Everlast]
The emperor's got brand new clothes
And everybody but him knows he's naked
But you don't say a word
The emperor's got brand new jewels
Wake up soon you silly fools he's naked
But you don't say a word
The rich they get richer, the poor they get poorer
While Liberty stands naked screamin in horror
The emperor raped her but we just ignore her
The rich they get richer, the poor they get poorer

[Everlast]
Euthanize, youth will rise, scrutinize, truth from lies
Time to revolutionize, organize, weaponize
Easy come, easy go, think I'm movin just a little bit too slow
Got front row tickets to the big freak show
Wait for the whole freakin thing to blow

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
Homicide, genocide, victimized or paralyzed
Empathize and analyze, compromise and vandalize
Easy come, hard to take, wide awake the original fake
Find the heart, drive the stake
Wait for the whole freakin thing to break

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The rich they get richer, the poor they get poorer
While Liberty stands naked screamin in horror
The emperor raped her but we just ignore her
The rich they get richer, the poor they get poorer</pre>
