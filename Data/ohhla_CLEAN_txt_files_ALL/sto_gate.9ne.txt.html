Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Pledge: Women]
Together we are
A powerful force
As one, mind, body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love, combined with our strength
We ward off pain and stress
Technician I am, whole heartidely, in life and in death

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Okay I get it I'm an nympho and freak of nature
But the pen is gonna heat the paper
With a problem in a incubator
Mom and dad was a creature maker I
Never need the shaker the beef from table
The teacher later
Now your the beast of waitner
I don't think the streets are safer!
My misery seepin' through my delivery
Bitter we givers and they keep my figures don't try to Nigga me
The grave digger is neither he is no kidder see
Consider the dark energy, sinner her be inner me!

Black diamonds all around clawin all, they're down
Definites who saw the clown
And now steppin' with that tall amount of big tech and shit
Aah-ooh! 3 times
My people they know what that defines, (Aah-ooh, Aah-Ooh, Aah Ooh!)
When the people are lovin' and that's T-9
He run and really make a pee line

They bout to hate
Make out the great
They bout to break
If they don't pay off the cake
Stay out my face
You don't want me to lay out the fate
Flip the sick or plain out relate
Damned and incredible straight out the gate!

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We are the darkness but we're leaving
We are the gods that are deceiving
We are the painters of blind face
Coming straight out the gate
We are the children of your rifles
Holding guns while reading bibles
We are the painters of blind face
Coming straight out the gate

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You see the face of Ebah on Tech Nina
Evil Brain Angel Heart I remain in the dark and anointed
With holy they console me when they know we saying
Got a hold of me, why they let go of me? I'm double jointed
I'm wicked and I represent the sickness
All you fraudulents feeling I'm falling offending the father
I place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
Nobody but you without any food and no agua
I blacken the sun on you bitches
Sack in the dungeons and ditches
Yappin is one of your glitches
Halt it
The Kraken has come with the quickness
Baggin I'm plundering chicks
And laughing you dummies trip when I'm Exalted
Tech N9ne
Fuck the industry independence
We enemies to them and he
That's blind
The champ is here
The vamp is near
Huntin' you heathens, hella hungry and I'm amped this year

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I am the public enemy #1
Fuck your fame I became the name of the gun
Now they parents to Aaron
Because they sons and daughters wanna be martyrs
Believe in the art ain't it young
All I got is my balls and rap
I'm appalled that y'all want me to fall callin craps
Suckers hate it now they crawlin' back
Cause I'm tall as Shaq
And I'm always up for brawlin' bats
Strange music saved my life
I was fuckin' it then the music became my wife
Nobody on the planet contained my mic
Call me crazy, don't matter fucking insane I like!

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
When the sun's beam melts
Everyone screams help
Then only one king's felt when telling all survivors
Welcome to Something Else!

And I say Kansas City
Will always stay Kansas City
Ya!
This is Something Else baby!
Let's Go!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
I ain't knockin no more I'm breakin' in!</pre>
