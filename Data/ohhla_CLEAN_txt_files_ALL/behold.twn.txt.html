[Verse One: June Marx]
The two sons here, the new frontier
I came with the proof cause the truth unclear
If you come near you might feel the aura
Now you numb with fear write to reveal the horror
Like to conceal the armor my scars on the track
Your guards will collapse, the marxman on attack
To mark us on the map, the sound of destruction
Pounds of artillery rounds surround your junction
You cowards are nothing my bars full of punishment
Art that I'm running with the ark of the covenent
Target your goverment, the scrolls of grim rebels
The coldest is exposed behold the twin perils
Soldiers with pinned medals, its modern warfare
The trigger is the microphone, the mind the crosshair
The kind that's raw and rare, the rage and wrath is horrid
The path of the departed, the massacre has started, the marxman

[Verse Two: Lone Ninja]
Peers got to tread slow we got it locked
We're watching heads roll from chopping block       
The coldest grim rebels the havoc is near
Behold the twin perils you panic and scared       
The damage sever I'm the feared colonel
The savage appears in the scared circle       
Beware the hurtful, your crew surrounded
I'm Cruel and frowning I've slewed and ousted       
Savage gross and lethal I have to choke and beat you
Yall maggots croak, yo adios amigo           
When wrath's provoked I'm evil a hell on wheels
The average foe is feeble found dead on hill       
I'm headstrong still, though the path is rough
Clash with us you're blasted to ash and dust           
I'll warn a horde of thugs you will perish
Waterfalls of blood pool is reddish, yo
