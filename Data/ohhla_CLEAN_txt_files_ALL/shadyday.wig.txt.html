[Intro: Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo, B.I., it's Wigs, baby, what the deal?
What's going on?

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
they eyes, like "True Lies," kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Shawn Wigs)]
Let's get this money baby (they shady) we get shady
(Dress up like ladies) and burn 'em with dirty 380's
(Then they come to kill our babies) that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out (clear the mall out) fuck the fallout

[Shawn Wigs]
That's word to Dirt, BIG, they pussy son, we moving like murderers
Staten Island and Brooklyn's Finest, you know they heard of us
Trafficking, moving coke in kids mail boxes, we got
Custom teflon line, inside our foxes
And if that money ain't on the table like the World Series of Poker
We gon' have to catch bodies and move with the coka
Shuffle back to Brooklyn and meet, Jeezy and Jigga man
Trife and Ghost told me they got, thoughts of some bigger plans
Bigger scams, it's Theodore, we run New York
It's like, life after death, and I can hear you talk
BIG, I'm listening, keeping them drugs in good position and
Guns fully loaded with heat, ready for whistling

[Chorus]</pre>
