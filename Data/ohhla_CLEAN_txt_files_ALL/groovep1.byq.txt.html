[Intro]
AH-AH-HEM~! Yeah
A lil' somethin somethin for the somethin somethin
Sheeeeit! Smoke somethin, yeah
(Strolling in the park)
Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me
You need a gangster baby, ayy!
Just tryin to give it to ya
(Walkin lonely in the dark)
A groovy nigga that's way too G
(Tryin to tell you baby!)

[Schoolboy Q]
Ay - he might say cuz but he ain't fuckin with cuz
Yea I'm Q; but you can call me Quincy
if you want or whatever baby it's all love
Fuck all that rappin, let me talk to you
Book you a ticket so we can kick it
Make an escape somewhere we'll be safe
Close your purse, I got my Visa on me
Pick out whatever it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey
Take off my saboteur, wipe your nose for ya
Climb a mountain in the snow for ya
You see these dummies always cut you loose
but so much that a G can do
Hit the weed, have a drink or two
I pay attention, I can listen too; you say he fuckin who?
Fresh out the shower, let me smell your hair
Garnier Fructis got my knees weak
Let's cuddle in these sheets (unhh~! Yeah)
Let me hold you for a moment, it feels right don't it?
From a lost child to a woman
Eye contact and soft kisses
Strong grip, she want a gangster onnnn Crip

[Chorus: Schoolboy Q]
(Strolling in the park)
Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me
Just tryin to give it to ya
(Walkin lonely in the dark)
A groovy nigga that's way too G
(Tryin to tell you baby!)

[Dom Kennedy]
(Ooooooo-hooooooo) A 5'3" stallion
Daddy was from Harlem, so momma was Italian
I don't see the challenge
of havin two girls, you just gotta keep the balance
I told her light that candle
I heard you do yoga, I'm tryin to see examples
Uhh, yo' ass is like a handle
See us on the front page, that'll be a scandal
Take off this red shirt, then my flannel
I need some head first, then I'ma fuck you in them sandals!!
I, hit the coochie like a dime sack
Ain't those Gucci - didn't I buy that?
Yeah; close yo' eyes, go on try that
You only live once and I know I got you soakin wet!!
Thirsty; is the liquor store opened yet?
I need some Moet to pour it on yo' ass like a paint
Back shots leave the pussy shaking
This my open invitation
And in the morning make my toast
with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch!

[Chorus]

(Real player shit, real player shit)

[Curren$y]
(Ooooooo-hooooooo) Underground royal
Flow over they heads, air duct
Upper crust, toast bread
Talk of the town, thinkin you know everything 'bout
a nigga cause them bitches talk loud in the beauty shop
Gossip before your mans can get'cha
YouTube clips can't show it all
Come and get down if you really wan' get up baby doll
Ain't nobody 'round to judge, go on
Get if off yo' chest, vent, come up out that dress bitch
She ain't take offense; proceeded to take hits
of the pre-game twist, smoke out, smash
Grub a little bit, pass out, post-game events
Too high to find the remote
Fell asleep to a infomercial, woke up in her mouth
Reruns of Full House, followed by some Urkel
O.G. my strain, rarely do I blaze purple
Some of them growers be in a rush
Fuckin the game up; you gon' learn about all that stuff
long as you hang around us - go on roll up

[Chorus]</pre>
