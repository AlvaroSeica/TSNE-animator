[Chorus]
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Yeah, that my sista and I'm so proud the way she hold it down
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
Pray you richer in confidence
When I'm paying you mind
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive!
Yeah is the illest bitch alive as long as it round
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!

Fuck you now not a five keeping your babies fly
Know the time, know is like, no one know it should tight
No one know is the struggle, no one know what it's like
How you're holding me emotion and twelve... like
Man you're straight and you're fucking when you...
I can't touch just some pleasure I just...
Yeah it's the illest bitch alive and love her freaky...
And deeper that need you get the needer just... for the

[Chorus]
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Yeah, that my sista and I' m so proud the way she hold it down
Call her the illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind
Ohh illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Two times, two times for the illest bitch alive

Baby father bullshittin', you two don't even speak
Ain't seen his seed in 14 days, that nigga too week
Couple shy of a month, I ain't runnin' you up
When it be too loose or you be too late
We ain't tyin' no knot
And I know it's double standards when you're fuckin' with us
But I pray these everlasting groupies don't fuck up this love
New louboutins when she dressin', louboutin
Please correct me, stretch marks
Make her self conscience, I kiss her when we're sexin'
Yes, it's the illest bitch around, flawless and brown
Smokin' loud, blowin' down when the law ain't around
When it comes to underwater I get nautical shawtie
Yeah, you leavin' alone but came here with multiple shawtie

[Chorus]
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Yeah, that my sista and I' m so proud the way she hold it down
Call her the illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind
Ohh illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!
Two times, two times for the illest bitch alive

[Outro]
And I promised myself I wouldn't tell you this shit today
But, tomorrow's uncertainty promotes the urgency in this shit I'm a say
Perfection doesn't exist if it doesn't consume her
And the truth hurts that this world's mine, but the womb is hers
Ms. mother nature I pray that our daughters carry and favor your genes
And when you take off your jeans you get all the me that you need
That you allow me to work it 'til you know what your actual worth means
And for what it's worth, I hope a couple words could help you see...
