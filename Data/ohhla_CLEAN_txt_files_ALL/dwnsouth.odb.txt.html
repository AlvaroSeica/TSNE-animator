[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you (We about to hurt somethin' up in here)

[Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Them down south niggaz been loved Dirt
Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse
Show respect to your niggaz, who been doin' it first
And be comin' with that shit, I'm just doin' the work

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit one verse
And leave in a New Benz burst
Take a trip down south and put some hoes to work, you hear me

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirt McGirt, you niggaz gon' respect it
I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump, and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out, and laugh about it in Texas, yo

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the houses at
Where the shootin' and the fightings and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys and the Cadi's at, shit

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
