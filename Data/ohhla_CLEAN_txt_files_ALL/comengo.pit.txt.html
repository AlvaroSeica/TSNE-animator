[Intro: Enrique Iglesias]
I make them girls go {*2X*}

[Pitbull]
I've been around the world and back
Seen a little bit of everything
Heard a lot, learned the lot
on how to hit the spot ding, ding, ding
And if the price is right, I mean the night is right
I mean the time is right she'll do her thing
And I know the price, night, and time is right
So dimelo mami, don't play no games
Dale mama, talk to me straight
Please, please with no chaser
Now this isn't the debate
And I ain't gonna chase ya
Mami you the internet
And I'm lookin for a download
And if you don't know, now you know
Yeah.. I make them come and go

  I make them girls go {*3X*}

[Chorus 2X: Enrique Iglesias]
I make 'em come, make 'em come, make 'em go-o-o
I make 'em come, make 'em come - I make the girls go

[Pitbull]
Now you heard about me... and I ain't gotta say much
I ain't talkin 'bout cars, it's automatic I'll pop your clutch
You gon' do things baby, you've never done before
And you will say things baby, you've never said before
You gon' think thoughts baby, you never thought you think
This is ass wide shot, turn those pants, so baby don't blink
Mami you the internet
And I'm lookin for a download
And if you don't know, now you know
Yeah.. I make them come and go

  I make them girls go {*3X*}

[Pitbull]
Su tia ta buena, su madre ta buena
Toda tan buena

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
OHHH~!
That's right {*whispered 7X*}
Say it with me now
La la la la, la la la, la la la la la {*4X*}

  I make them girls go

[Chorus] - 2X
