[Intro: Troy Ave]
They checkin me 'cause I got a check
But I ain't wearin Nike likely I'm wearin a tek
Bullets that make you while you tell 'em to go in ya neck
Double XL so icy Gucci Phillepes in my steps

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
I'm about to show you, why I am the shit
And then after I show you, you'll be on my dick
'Cause I'm that nigga, but you don't know it yet
I'm just that nigga, but you don't know it yet (Powder!)
I'm about to show you, why I am the shit
And then after I show you, you'll be on my dick
'Cause I'm that nigga, but you don't know it yet
I'm just that nigga, but you don't know it yet

[Verse One: Troy Ave]
I be that, Brooklyn nigga with the golden smile
They ain't know me '09 I bet they know me now
George shorts with a white T, fork in the white B
Made more with the Pyrex then Givenchy
Shope never close now hudnred for O's
If you buyin thirty six hoes sell for the low
I'm major without a deal I'm not these rap niggas
My art imitates life and that's a fact nigga
No respect for suckers who run they lips
Then pick who they will and won't get tough with it
Anybody who play me, I fold 'em or shot 'em
And I ain't got to get 'em 'cause I already got 'em
Sixteen with a mac 11
Now you hearin my sixteens on Hot 97
Young Harry Powder bloomin like cocoa flower
Hamper full of towels all the bitches took a shower
Clean kills, Stan Smiths by the poolside
Fireplace lit everyday is Utah
My presence a gift to my sexiest bitch
Dark dress light skin with devilish lips
Stop blushin show 'em I ain't frontin
Take a Instagram with that nigga for no hustlin
Casino flow mi amor payin roulette
My life is a gamble what's a thousand dollar bet?!
Poker chip pound no fro willies around
Double shots of Crown, Royal losin me down
We young niggas with grown money they all watch
No hand I could throw cost more than my watch
Watch me make moves don't wait for no niggas
Started from the bottom I levitated on most niggas
Hard work pays literally coke whipper
Big body benz too I'm a fuckin dope dealer nigga

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
I'm about to show you, why I am the shit
And then after I show you, you'll be on my dick
'Cause I'm that nigga, but you don't know it yet
I'm just that nigga, but you don't know it yet (Powder!)
I'm about to show you, why I am the shit
And then after I show you, you'll be on my dick
'Cause I'm that nigga, but you don't know it yet
I'm just that nigga, but you don't know it yet

[Verse Two: Young Lito]
Young Lito, fresher than a new bar
That six top just fold like a fruton
Flyer than Clark Kent when he got the suit game
Use to be Too Short now my money too long
And bad bitches date me, broke niggas hate me
Tell 'em get a little more paper they could trace me
Aimin for the stars and my gun is off safety
Swag on mars and my group is on spacey
We hit the club hoes screamin take me
Fuck 'em then I tell 'em leave now they screamin make me!
Niggas can't shake me, I be out in A.C.
Shootin drug money block jumpin like Blake G
Winner since H3 or when I rock the A.V.
Moms had Christ in a bottle as a baby
Now I pour Cris on a model like I'm crazy
Young live nigga but these hoes say I'm wavy

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
I'm about to show you, why I am the shit
And then after I show you, you'll be on my dick
'Cause I'm that nigga, but you don't know it yet
I'm just that nigga, but you don't know it yet (Powder!)
I'm about to show you, why I am the shit
And then after I show you, you'll be on my dick
'Cause I'm that nigga, but you don't know it yet
I'm just that nigga, but you don't know it yet

[Verse Three: Troy Ave]
Every re-up I'm buildin another level up
Won't live life as a pilgrim I'm not a settler
Shipment full of birds to my hood I'm Columbus
We Cristal, Chris Wallas and Chris Dudas
Gangsta rap saran the pack you pay me I dap
You pay me I clap just statin the facts
I wanna be a millionaire, so freakin bad
Half waited off crack really did it the most
Never did it the boast sittin amongst the gross, picture and gettin toast 
Countin and makin jokes 'bout hatin niggas that's broke
I would kill 'em but me makin a killin is killin them slow (Die!)
New car like a shot to the head (BLAOW)
New bitch like I pushed her off the ledge (Ahhhh!!!!)
New songs Flex bombs niggas fed
When I do this million dollar deal niggas 'gon be dead
I'mlivin takin pictures with the Kool-Aid smile
Flashy dope dealer yeah you know my style
Had no hope nigga I came up real wild
Most of my friends are killers some of them blew trial
See you in fifteen with good behavior
If I don't make it doin rap I'm a be ya neighbor
For now I'll be that nigga New York's savior
Save ya breath the debaters and bet ya wages
Powder! Motherfuckers!</pre>
