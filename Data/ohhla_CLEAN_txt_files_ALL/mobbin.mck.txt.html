[Intro]
Yeah, mobbin', ya hear me?

So stay in pocket 'fore I get into your pockets

You motherfuckers keep violating the shit mane
I'm at the center of hit squad man back at you, Fat Dave

Yeah we got Mack mizzle in this bitch, yeah
Mobbin for real, ya heard me?

[Verse 1]
All life nigga, all right nigga
You know we mobbin for real
Young niggas come through with the steel
Ain't nothing for you ass to get killed
Your banana get pealed
You're fucking with the right one
So you're looking the wrong way, with the right gun
Psyche nigga, you keep doin what you do thinking that you a gangsta
50 Cent said the best you niggas just a wankster
Don't' make me just kill, like this part my job
Cash money, young money, bitch I'm part of the mob
Nigga beat it, bout to move out to Kentucky
We take over everything
From Louisville to Lexington, them bitches tryna fuck me
I already know when I drop there I'm good
How they grow nigga, that's my motherfucking hood
Shouts out the tune
We shittin' on this niggas like we woke up eating prunes
Who the fuck wanna test us, we coming soon
We at yo front door before you wake up
Jack on your cake and yo make up
Excuse me and Jake up, then take your bitch out the crib
And ski skirt on our make-up, that's how we feel nigga
This shit is real nigga, this shit is real nigga
That's how we feel nigga, beat it holla at me yea

[Interlude]
The Akron, you heard me?
I crawled around these niggas, tearing up shit
Believe that, yeah, west I was fine
Yeah, I will snap your motherfuckin cap
Imagine that, out here in this motherfucking Miami
Doing it big lie, you heard me?
Me and my nigga Mack, Haly Grove

[Verse 2]
You understand nigga, I don't play football
But like Pacman I'll be riding in that ghost
If you approach, I can make you a ghost
Get your ass up with that toast snd take your bread
When I fill you with that led
You heard what I said, nigga
Don't try to play dummin' like you're stupid retarded
My niggas loopin be come through
And make it funky like fat man when he farted found your body
Like when Ricky did, them boys in the hood
You see my boys is still hood nigga
We puff good nigga, you know we should nigga
Leave you niggas on deck, roll feeling like shook nigga
Ridin up the block like I'm popped bustin shots
Who the fuck would wanna test, y'all niggas just not
What we is, what we ain't uh, fuck it man
I put about a mill on the Saints I don't care
Bonnie boys, we run up on county boys, with them toys like brr
Stick up! Aha, stick up B...

[Interlude]
Bitch ass nigga

Yeah, I'm motherfucking on do it like this

But it ain't no real hold alive, you hear me?

[Verse 3]
Put a bitch on a track, fuck a rap
Niggas know that them bitches get slapped but they ain't got my stacks
That's the reason why they call me Mack big pimpin
Off the Gulf Coast big shrimpin'
Mobsters still eating lobster, pulling up in a Boxter
Polo mother fucking horses that what's on my boxers
Bitch I don't want box ya, I pop ya
Leave you in the motherfucking grave, not they box ya
Six feet deep is where you be I'll even see in the shit
If a nigga playin with me he eternally sleep
Uh, I put on my wall face, pull up on bumping that Scarface
And leave with a scarred face
Who the fuck would wanna test me and my nigga?
We quick to pull triggers, yeah we still getting figures
Yeah some young money niggas yeah
Cash money niggas yeah
West coast niggas yeah
South coast niggas yeah
Blast if you protege nigga

[Outro]

Yea, my nigga throwin layups at the motherfuckin basket right now, you heard me?
Yea, them jump shots from the drop
