Song:   Sicker Than Yo Average
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
(Huh, sicker than ya average)
Sicker than yo average
(sicker than ya average)
Sicker than yo average
(sicker than ya average)

[Fabolous]
Ha ha, sicker than yo average
Oh you think you hot
I'll come through quicker than a maverick
Shut ya heat down, you'll quickly be embarrassed
Come through where you live, flick it up like Dallas
Stick to living savage, I'll stick to living lavish
Picking up a bad bitch, the chick look like my ad-libs (niiice)
She calling me Fab Pitt, you can be my Jolie
Swing big sticks, shorty you can be my goalie
You ask too many questions, yo, you can be the police
You know what time it is girl, you can see my Rolie
My car like a hospital, with the windows tinted cause
You can't see me but you know a sick nigga in it right

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
(Ha, sicker than ya average)
Sicker than yo average
(sicker than ya average)
Sicker than yo average
(sicker than ya average)
Sicker than yo average
(Ha, ha, sicker than ya average)
Sicker than yo average
Nigga working hard just to have it
Tell you like I told my last bitch
Sicker than yo, sicker than yo, sicker than yo
Sicker than yo average

[Red Cafe]
Sicker than yo average
Euro gang crazy, I'm in the sickest fabrics
High every day like I'm living in the attic
Psycho, psycho, my living room padded
I'm sicker than magic, oh
Stuntin' in the sickest air max, oh
Now I'm finna pose for the flashes, hoe
Still I put it down in the mattress
So make that girl the opposite of Go-Go
Go, go, dippin' from behind
doing the sickest Blue Jays and I ain't talking Toronto
Sicker than yo average, there he go, the finisher
Sick hot, 200 degrees, check the temperature

[Chorus]</pre>
