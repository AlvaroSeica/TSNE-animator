[Ke$ha]
Listen to yourself you're a hot mess
St-t-stutter through your words breakin a sweat
What's it gonna take to con-fess
what we both know?
Yeah, I was out of town last weekend
You were feelin like a pimp 'round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go

[Interlude]
Whoa-oah-uh-oh, you got a secret
Whoa-oah-uh-oh, you couldn't keep it
Whoa-oah-uh-oh, somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

[Chorus]
I never thought that you would be the one
Actin like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh
Kiss and tell
You really shoulda kept it in your pants
I'm hearin dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh
Kiss and tell (oh-oh-oh)

[Ke$ha]
You're lookin like a tool, not a baller
You're actin like a chick, why bother?
I can find someone way hot-ter
with a bigger, wow, well
Cause I'm talkin' 'bout all the ways that you've messed up
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut
I'm so sick of it, I've had enough
I hope you cry

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

Kiss and tell {*8X*}

[Ke$ha]
Oh, I hope you know, you gotta go
Yo, get up and go, I don't wanna know
How or why you're gross, you gotta go
Yo, get up and go, cause I don't wanna know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Maybe you shouldn't, oh-oh-oh
Kiss and tell, oh-oh-oh</pre>
