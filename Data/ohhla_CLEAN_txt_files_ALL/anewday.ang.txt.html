[Intro: A. Martinez]
Yo, uh
The animals are here
It's a new day...yo yo uh

It's about being close to the ground
like dope fiends and not even fallin'
Some people frontin' now they keep callin'
But that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart
I could sleep mornings, that's the business
I just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom

In my position get hard, I deal wit people from far
Very few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars
You gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars
And all of a sudden.. they forgot who they are

But look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan B
It's a new day you could sit down or stand me
I just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out
When everybody doubting underhand me
Its ample time, If you could not see the big picture
Cause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista
Always on the grind through whatever you say
And just incase you ain't clear its okay
It's a new day!

[Chours1: 2x]
If you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yea)
It happen for me, It's a new day (a new day)

[Chours2: 2x]
Keep hoping, Keep focus
Approaching, up, A new day

Reaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected
Me on a record, We must yea agree it was hectic
Getting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair
How I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real
I was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given
People dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance
Listen and understand, they ain't know how to react
Off my 16 bars on that track, "She out or she back Damn"
Then came a record ("If I could go")
I'm not saying my shits perfected
But if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected
You already know, yes is an automatic question
Automatically answered cause I'm flowing like you never heard
Why second one it can't be said in words
Except it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top
You mad at me huh, believe it won't stop
The love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]

See they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up
As soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up
Or never picking you out, they always out when you pick
But when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit
Then every other word is, "No Doubt,
 When can we go out, When can we grab lunch," I only get mad once
Cause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch
And then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt
Roll it and spark it cause you media targets
Pictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying
This ain't ancient this is today shit
but it's a new day shit no games get played shit
No time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations ("yep")
And I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it
So when I say it's a new day I mean it
Cause when it's the truth you must agree shit!

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]
ya hear me singing

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]
we on our way
animal house
