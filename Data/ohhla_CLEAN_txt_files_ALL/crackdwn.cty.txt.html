[Tree City]
Compound loops to build measures
Walls of sound pound your troop like Phil Spector
Guild accept the top of stones but in the letter envelopes
where you can drop a note from hand to pocket if the stock is broke
Unconscious goals when I'm at rest a {?}
Not to boast but those who said they were the best got exposed
by the flows, a Godly strong man, the Euchiariac flows
scatter high and low, I'm climbin ladders to define 'em hoe
Not the guy to try and scold unless you plan to cry in bold
Whine and throw a temper tantrum after I explode
And take your assets, potentially expand stacks
Exponentially, your man's back with intensity
Can't censor me, it ain't happenin
My grass has been more orange than forests of mandarin tangerines
I mean, tangerines, hazardous as gasoline
Splattering flammable canopies in match factories

These cats ain't passin me, thinkin that I'm slippin
if I ain't stackin cheese, as far as haters go
I block 'em like Maccabee, thinkin I'm slackin please
I'm a pretty nice guy 'til I start packin these
Wait actually, that really ain't my legacy
Focused on the prophetdom, the gossip I just let it be
This is endin up as hard as people said it'd be
Lock it down or set it free, you'll never see the end of me
Settle down let 'em peep, I don't need to sit it
Steady on the boom through the knowledge and the lift
I was only tryin to think a bit, but then a month passed
And I ain't write shit, so I must have
the inability to contact what's willin me
Have me second guessin if I was eager to real MC
The pressure's on I can feel the heat
Turn it up, kill the beat, loud enough, kill the weak
