You can find me over there at the bar
You ain't even gotta ask, I don't know where they are
I'm a bad bad daddy
I'm a bad bad daddy, and I'm nasty
And I still ain't calling it quits
But Sean, what the fuck's wrong with all of your kids?
I'm a bad bad daddy
I'm a bad bad daddy

Sitting at the bar just minding my biz
I came down with all nine of my kids
And they've all got an attitude
Mad cause I said we can't go to the zoo
It's not a lie, but daddy's too high
If I drive I would probably catch a D.U.I.
Here, play with this pitcher of beer
Sit in these chairs and don't disappear
Everybody on your best behavior
Tip the waitress, respect your neighbors
I'll be watching, you know what not to do
Don't make me walk over here just to talk to you
I gave them all some money
So they could play pinball and put grub in they tummies
Now I'ma go get bombed
and you better not tell your mom
And like clockwork, soon as I stepped away
You know they got worse, they didn't hesitate
Of course they start with horseplay
and then it escalates, then you get a court case
Little Sluggos, thugs and cutthroats
Big trouble, cigarettes puff those
Smash bottles on the floor
and writing graffiti, fighting with the door man
Playing with switchblades and matches
Pick-pocketing the cash and the plastic
Getting high out back by the trash cans
Trying to get the waitress to give a lapdance
I can't control 'em
So I'ma pretend I don't know 'em
Now let me celebrate and get drunk
cause my wife missed her period again this month

You can find me over there at the bar
You ain't even gotta ask, I don't know where they are
I'm a bad bad daddy
I'm a bad bad daddy, and I'm nasty
And I still ain't calling it quits
But Sean, what the fuck's wrong with all of your kids?
I'm a bad bad daddy
I'm a bad bad daddy, somebody slap me

You are listening to the amazing</pre>
