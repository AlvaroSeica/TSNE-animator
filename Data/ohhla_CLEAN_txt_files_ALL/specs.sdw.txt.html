Live and direct from Nassau County, it's the Specman!

[Specman]
What's up? What's up? It's Specman, y'all
Holding shit down, you know how it go
North Yard, they spill, we live it
That's how it goes

[Izzy Workin]
Everything's good, man
Everything's good, heard you got some heat rock for us

[Specman]
You know, you know it, it don't stop
It never stops

[G-Roc]
That's what it is, making that money while incarcerated
North Yard Entertainment, G-Roc and the Generals, Specs on the phone

[Specman]
Yeah, y'all, M.T.M., North Yard
Make That Money, y'all

[G-Roc]
Let the peoples know
Let the peoples know who you being railroaded Specs
Let 'em know, let 'em know what it is

[Specman]
Aiyo, check it out, right, because, straight up
Birksy represented Capone-N-Noreaga
They he represented Tony Yayo
Now he's got the Specman
Got it gleaming, moving with stars
No sweat, we got it, we ain't even stressing it
All those bitches out there
I'ma smack the shit out y'all faces right now
When I come home, straight up and down
I wanna shout out my man big Skeelo
Joey's finest, G-Roc, Izzy Workin, Shadow Government
Fantom of the Beat, Digits, Riot Starters
Two 4 War Entertainment, Wild Wolves, Wild West Wolves
Wild Out Wolves, Big Rich, Boston
My daughters, Mercedes and Angelina
Wild Rocks the Jeweler and of course my baby holding it down MWAH
When I get home we gon' make some more babies
You know, you know...

[Izzy Workin]
What's the deals my neezzy?
Spit that heat now...

[Specman]
What up? What up? Could you hear me good?
You wanna hear a dart?

[Izzy Workin + G-Roc]
We need that, we need that

[G-Roc]
We need a hot sixteen for the peoples
It ain't a Free Specs mixtape without a Specs sixteen on it
What's good?

[Specman]
Aiyo, once again, it's on...
It's Specs back in the bing, I'm strapped with the thing
Smacking a wack cat when I black, it's a wrap in the ring
Snap and I sting, bird, you a rat, set a trap when you sting
Get you with gats cocked back, brains'll splatter the swings
Always wrap hundreds, always in the things, Grey Ghosts, clip wings
Anything for the kings, Kill Perm, send a kite to confirm he a worm
My cancerous germ, no sweat, make him regret it if he returns
See I'ma set it for Prezident, and get it, ya squirm
In the infirmary, lessons, you learned
It's Specs, the legend is dead, who put you in check
From here to Quebec, the streets'll reflect
The sweeps in the 'jects, the beach and the sex
Did the street, Margeritas, mamacita's a wreck
Go on the set, for snitching you get
Protecting Ya Neck, without regret, got connects to death
Got Gov and I'm straight biz to represent

[Izzy Workin]
That's right

[G-Roc]
That's what's up, it's a wrap!

[Specman]
Y'all feel that?

[G-Roc]
The Specman, straight from the County
Holding it down, the bing monster
Nothing less...

[Specman]
Positive y'all...</pre>
