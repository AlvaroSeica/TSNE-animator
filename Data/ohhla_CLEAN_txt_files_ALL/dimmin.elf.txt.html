Song:   Dimmin' the Life
Typed by: sime@mrblunt.com

Yo
Wakin up to nothing everyday
With my mind permanently runnin astray
Runnin away
I'm tryin to catch up
But I'm backed up 
With all forms of individual frustrations
Makin my skull crack up
There's a thin line between drugs and Jakes
No one's perfect
And they can't afford makin a mistake
Money wells dried up a long...time ago
It's not easy at it was befo'
It's like
Tryin to put food on a table.
With no arms.
It's difficult reapin what you sow
With no yarn
Workin to eat...eatin to work
The same rituals
Beatin up on your physical
We need a Robin Hood to come about these towns
To-
Steal from the rich
And invest it in to a poor man's playground
Instead of you so laid down
Face down
Like corrupt cops
They lie tellin us the hatred is no longer around

CHORUS:

What are we supposed to do
Or-
Say, in order to
Do away with the ha-
-tred of today
X2

VERSE 2:

(yo-yo)
I'm fightin a war of what's wrong and what's right
Every single day in my life
Haven't found a job payin me right
Not lookin forward to see day light
I see break at night
Wastin my life
Thinkin to myself:
The year of the Heisman diploma is over
It's all about the connections you got and who you've known longer
I thought I'd grown stonger
Than the average
But this hatred seperation in this nation
Put me in a situation I simply can't manage
I don't seem to understand it
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place in this American granite
They even got society eyin' me
Invadin my privacy
They even got camera's on traffic lights watchin me
Claimin thatthey stoppin me
&gt;From commitin crimes
While ya slowly shortenin the size of Public Assistance lines
So how you even gunna build the nerve to tell me that hatred no longer exists 
in America

Man talking:
"I'm sayin tho, come on, what is you talkin about
Tryin to take it back to  sock or something
You know
"Word"
"He's buggin out and stuff"
"Word"

VERSE 3:
But yo
It's time to become the Olympic torch holders
Releasin ourselves from these modern day tortures
Soldiers
Relievin each other
&gt;From the clutches of snakes
Like fakes on headed shoulders
Holdin it down like gravity does boulders
That's how we got to do it
You know how the sayin goes:
"Move it or lose it"
Either chose to defuse it or go out ruthless
We can never be stopped if we unite, (hell no)
As long as we're properly guarded through the darkness with the use of light
Sleepin through nights
Might be hard for some days
But the endin results'll soon pay
We'll uncover the fondness inside y'all like a toupe'
I'm about to uplift my sword into the air and yell out TOUCHE'
I'm one of the many people you grazed
With the constitutional bullet of hatred
And now ya highly hated
And I'll be damned if i don't say it
I'll be damned if don't say it

CHORUS X 2

"Yo, gotta get rid of this
Do away with the hatred of today
Do away with it
Do away with the hatred of today
I'm sick of it son
It's like I had to talk about it a lil summin summin
But yo, it's all good
L-Fudge
Uh, uh
L-i, L-i
Q-u...i-b
F-u
F-u
Yo f-u-d-g-e
Yeah yeah, Bridge Boogey"
