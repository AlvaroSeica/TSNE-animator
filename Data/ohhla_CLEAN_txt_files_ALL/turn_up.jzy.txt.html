Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Just got off the phone thinking ain't no way ahead
Thirty minute conversation with my partner he in jail
He said "Young, don't you let these niggaz trick you out your spot"
Homie on the inside nigga love you like you're Pac

[Chorus]
Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggaz need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me I'm 'bout to turn up or die

Niggaz turn up or die
Niggaz turn up or die
Niggaz flicking, niggaz hating
Niggaz turn up or die
Bitch turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggaz hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die

[Verse 1]
I'll see you back on the soul floor
Tell you niggaz something that you didn't know
Grown ass man they on that little boy shit
Talk, talk, talking rack with no chest that's little boy shit
Can't pick your bitch self unless I put it down
When they was 24 a piece I serve the whole town
What the deal on streets want some new shit
Talking so hard this shit go where the news click
Told your own recession nigga I was playing to win
Pass these niggaz 10 times they hit my rear view
I'm on this gangster Gibbs nigga I can hear you

[Chorus]
Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggaz need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me I'm 'bout to turn up or die

Niggaz turn up or die
Niggaz turn up or die
Niggaz flicking, niggaz hating
Niggaz turn up or die
Bitch turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggaz hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die

[Verse 2]
Ok I got an announcement
Niggaz talking money ain't got an accountant
You can ball for the money yea I got 3
You niggaz wanna play the game yea I got teeth
You can play with them other niggaz homie not me
How dare you open up your mouth speaking on the cheat
Oh no Young is feeling like a spirit now
Guess it's time to play, shark in an aquarium
May you lil niggaz talking on that lil shit
Pillar talking with them bitches ye that pillar shit
Ye you know I'm blowing killer, ye I'm killing shit
Streets say nigga get back on your dealership

[Chorus]
Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggaz need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me I'm 'bout to turn up or die

Niggaz turn up or die
Niggaz turn up or die
Niggaz flicking, niggaz hating
Niggaz turn up or die
Bitch turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggaz hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die</pre>
