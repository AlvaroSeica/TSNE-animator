[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey, oh yeah, Cole World
Uh, oh yeah, yeah

[J. Cole]
This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggaz that hated
Old hoes we dated, look momma we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes
Smokin weed on the beaches, my mind workin like Platos
Analyzin the world, fantasizin 'bout girls
I'm handin diamonds and pearls and vandalizin her curls
Sweatin her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I've stepped, over piranhas, death over dishonor
They killin niggaz for J's, that's death over designer
And Cole heatin up like that leftover lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dawana?
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
Hey tell me why we gotta argue 'bout the same thing, same thing?
Well

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uhh, nobody's perfect, ayy
Ayy, uhh, ay but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uhh, nobody's perfect, ayy
.. Ay but you're perfect for me
We rollin, we ridin, he like to go, inside and
I love to go, all night and, we rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call, yo' name, name, name
Hey baby I love to call yo' name, name, name ay

[J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl, take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin all in yo' dorm room
But, that thing tight like Fort Knox, so I call you when the tour stops
But baby where your roommates? Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together, smoke a lil' weed but her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose, only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah I heard the stories 'bout different dudes, her man on campus but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like fo' or five niggaz, so you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus]</pre>
