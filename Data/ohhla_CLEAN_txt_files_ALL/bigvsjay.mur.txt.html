[Intro]
BROOKLYN!!! Oh this is epic right here man!
Ha Ha!!!!

[Chorus]
HUH! Biggie and Jay two of the greatest (OH!)
What we tryin to figure out is who was the greatest?! (WHO MAN?!)
Who was Mike Tyson in his prime? 
Who mas Michael Jackon, Michael Jordan with the rhymes? (YEAH!!!!!)
I'm talkin 'bout the best of the best, who the greastest of all time? (I WANNA KNOW MAN!)
I'm talkin 'bout the best of the best, who the greatest of all time? (HUH!)

[Verse One]
First it was Nas (YEAH!) Then it was Biggie (YEAH!)
Then Big got killed and Jay started runnin the city (HOV WHATTUP?!)
HUH! If Big was here, how big would Jay be?
You know how many people talk about that daily? (EVERYDAY!!!)
Man! They be like you know Jigga? 
He a hustler if Big was here he be bigger (A BILLIONAIRE!!!)
Man! Other niggas be like nah kid
He wouldn't be that big 'cause he was second to Big (BIG WAS NUMBER ONE!!!)
HUH! He might still be doin his thing
But not that big 'cause Big stilll would have been king (OH!!!!)
But he ain't came at Big like he came at Nas (NAH!!!!!!!)
What was the big difference between Biggie and Nas?! (HA HA!)
See rappers competitive this shit is a sport (YEP!!!)
If Jay knew there could only be one king of New York (ONLY ONE!!!)
HUH! Imagine that Biggie Vs. Jay
I meen Brooklyn would have won either way HEY! (BROOKLYN!!!)

[Chorus]
Biggie and Jay two of the greatest (LEGENDS!!)
What we tryin to figure out is who was the greatest?! (WHO MAN?!)
Who was Mike Tyson in his prime? 
Who mas Michael Jackon, Michael Jordan with the rhymes? (OH!!!!!)
I'm talkin 'bout the best of the best, who the greastest of all time? (I WANNA KNOW MAN!)
I'm talkin 'bout the best of the best, who the greatest of all time? (TELL ME!)

[Verse Two]
HUH! If Big was here, how Big would Jay be? (I WONDER!)
You know how many people talk about that daily? (EVERYDAY!!!)
I'm cool with Jay, but I never met Big (I DIDN'T!)
You think he would have had that run like Jay did? (I DON'T KNOW!)
Or would Jay have had that run if they ain't kill Big? (I DON'T KNOW!)
The answers to them questions we never know kid (NO!!) 
HUH! I thought they slept on +Reasonable Doubt+ (THEY DID!)
Reason bein at the time they was Biggie'd out ('CAUSE OF BIG!)
Big and Diddy was runnin the town (THEY WAS!)
Jay was doin his thing but he was underground (HE WAS COMIN UP!)
But Big knew Jay was that nigga (HE KNEW!)
Just like Jay knew Big was that nigga (HE KNEW!)
Would Big have got better if he was still alive? (YEAH!!!)
Or would he had fell off like the nigga Nas? (NAH!!!)
And I'm not tryin to shit on Nas
Trust me I know I ain't got shit on Nas (I KNOW!!!)
But first Big took the crown from him (HE DID!!!)
And then Jay took the crown from him (HE DID!!!)
'Cause of Big died the crown went back to Nas
Jay was like fuck that that shit 'posed to be mine
Dropped the +Takeover+ then took over (BROOKLYN!!!)
That's when the Garden started to book Hova (BROOKLYN!!!)
And I'm not tryin to shit on Nas
Trust me I know I ain't got shit on Nas (I KNOW!!!)

[Chorus]
HUH! Biggie and Jay two of the greatest (LEGENDS!!)
What we tryin to figure out is who was the greatest?! (WHO MAN?!)
Who was Mike Tyson in his prime? 
Who mas Michael Jackon, Michael Jordan with the rhymes? (OH!!!!!)
I'm talkin 'bout the best of the best, who the greastest of all time? (I WANNA KNOW MAN!)
I'm talkin 'bout the best of the best, who the greatest of all time? (TELL ME!)
