(Pony Boy) (2x)
So what'chu want Homie? what'chu need?

(Psychodrama)
So what'chu want nigga? What'chu need?

(Claudia)
So what'chu want nigua? What'chu need?

(Together)
STEPUP IF YA READY TO BLEED!

(Claudia)
So if you want to get buck get buck
If you want to light it up light it up
talk is cheap, what the fuck.... You gon' do?
Now you fucking wit; Pony,???, fucking wit us
You fuckin wit a whole city (crew)
Dirty and gridy no remorse or pity
war wicked the committee got you looking too shitty (wha?)
Wanna say some mo' shit?
Knowing if you keep running yo mouth
You may end up with your tongue cut out
Knock'n niggaz straight off the richtor scale
be so nasty you can't help but to bail
What the hell drop a high 16
keep talking shit about psy
fuck around and get pop in yo spleen
You got the game fucka the jaw jappin
gon get you drunk up so you can know what's really happening
My word, my bound... I put it on my son
You gon respect me and were I'm from... (huh)

(Chorus)

(Pony Boy)
Like Desperado...(ah-ha), crazy Mojado!
Fired up, cause I was born a Marijuano!
Big Mexican, Big Texican you wanna fuck around?
You know I'm flexican
I brought putos, with my boy Juntos
Muy cochinos mal agradecidos
Criminales, pulling off Jales
con los cochoas asi con los corales
Mexican Mafia so what's stopping ya?
Never thought twice about dropping ya
Grandes Pistolas hang wit the Cholas
Grand Chingon wit the big bolas
Just hang'in real gang bang'n weed slang'n
showing off tag'n, el muy chingo valiente boracho
Pony Boy representando muy gacho

(Chorus)

(Psychodrama)
(Money to) Money to bang wit us
slang to stay wit us
Hands in the sky
everybody die when thang hit'cha
the same mista that'll pump on y'all
and break up like Shaq when we dunk up on y'all
 Plus big shit, wondering why my gun so tall
when you pussy niggaz had it
it would come through walls
make a mother fucka fell me
like 2pac... got stopped copped and chopped
when you pop two blocks
So it's all out war wit'cha
Making the lord lift y'all, high as the clouds breaking the nigga
make ya come get'cha
And before making you the sweetest of Swisher
closed casket faggot we gon miss ya

(Chorus)</pre>
