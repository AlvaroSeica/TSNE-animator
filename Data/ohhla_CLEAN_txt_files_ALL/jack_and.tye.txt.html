[Intro]
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me

[Tyler, the Creator]
Odd Future, I'm your muh'fuckin sergeant
Nigga I'm in charge, I
fuck with Freshjive cause I get it, no charge
And BBC for the low price, no bargin
Nigga that's a bargain
Cow print t-shirt like a muh'fuckin dog
on the muh'fuckin farm with cockadoddle doodles
I'm makin straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
and my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the free time, I'm tossin bitches' salads
And I'm eatin up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flyin to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, Baby Milo so dope
The cocaine flow, niggaz spit heat, propane
Niggaz get the picture I see, why?
(They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me)

[Chorus]
My nigga, no hook {*4X*}
No hook... fuck a hook, fuck a hook

[Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, beside me, nobody likes me
Mainly because I am not a fuckin HypeBeast
I think Supreme suck, we gnarly all our Nikes
I can wear some Wranglers, with a fuckin white tee
Doo-rag to match, and I do sag, in fact
My, hat is in tact with the FUBU pull over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm drivin a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fuckin rapper without a chain
with a four finger ring like I can't spell my fuckin name
And I go to Obama rallies screamin out "McCain"
Them ignorant thrashin motherfuckers is my gang
and the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from
Nigga you don't claim none, fun I am the teacher
White and black bitch like she's a motherfuckin zebra
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggaz on Easter

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(It's gold) The gold is in the back
(It's gold) The bitch is in the front
(It's gold) The beat's a fuckin bully
(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man
(Gold) The pink is in the sky
(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind
(It's gold) The mind is in my gold
The beat is turning old, so go

[Tyler, the Creator - voice pitched up]
Synthesizer, I'm the motherfuckin master
Nigga I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys
cause the sound lasts loner, bass drummer song
and then a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic
Nigga you can bite this unless you want to bite back
I didn't take my fuckin Ritalin, this is a hype track
HypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit
I had you motherfuckers eatin salad like a fat bitch

[Outro]
Ummm, uhhh, drop it!
Ace the Creator
O.F.M, bangin on your FM
Ace the Creator
Drop the drums, nigga
Thank you to HypeBeast</pre>
