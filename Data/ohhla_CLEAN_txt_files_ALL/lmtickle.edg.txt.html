"Come here, are you ticklish?"	--&gt; Humpty Hump

[Verse 1: Ed O.G.]
When I first got introduced with her
I wanted a future with her
And it was very easy for me to get used to her
We went to the movies, everything was groovy
We started spendin time and it was like she already knew me
We spent more time, then everything was fine
I kicked it to her how since she kicked it to mine
I called her up at work and even met her downtown
Keen to knowin one another, yo, I thought that I'd found
The perfect match for me, this just has to be
Asked her what's up with you and me?
She said she wanted to be friends with me
So I took it like a man
I couldn't understand why she wouldn't take my hand
And let me take her on a trip
She's a cute honey dip
It make her feel real good when I start to kiss her lips
Gimme a chance, oh yes, I be true to you
Hey yo, cause I wanna make love to you

[CHORUS: Pure Blend]
Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me, let me
Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me

"Come here, are you ticklish?"

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Lampin on the block, coolin out and maxin
This girl walked by, she caught my eye, I said, "What's happenin?"
WE started talkin, she was showin her interest
Got her number and address that very instance
Later on that night I decided to call her up
She was on the other line, she say hold on and hung up
With the person she was talkin to so she could talk to me
That was a sign that she was with it, it was time to drop some g
So I laid down with my eyes closed and kicked the Willie Bobo
And talked to her all night because I took a couple of No Doze
The next day came, I heard a knock-knock-kknock
I had on shorts and no shirts, so I unlocked the lock
She came in and sat down and we got right to it
I didn't waste no time cause I was ready to do it
She said she wasn't ready and this I couldn't understand
See, I really, really wanted to tickle her fancy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ed O.G.]
The attraction from me to you was very physical
And if you had it and you lost it you would miss it, girl
I make you scream, scratch, squirm and sweat
When we get up to take a shower my bed'll be soaken wet
And after the shower we'll go and get some breakfast
Eatin to makin love is really the next best
Thing than actually makin love
Cause after love I'm hungry for some grub
I know your father always told you watch out for guys like me
Don't even say hi to me, just walk right by me
You see, I disagree, cause he was just like me
You wanna obey him with all of your might
But look at your father now, he turned out alright
Come on, take your chance, yeah, I'm a dog who's sneaky
But gimme one night so I can show you I get freaky

[Chorus]</pre>
