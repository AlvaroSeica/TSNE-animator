One last trip...

[Verse 1]
This capsules seen better days, the ride is sluggish
need not complain it trundles
Some say pinned down to axles warped from endless early summers
Buff the dust away, cut the skin - a small price to pay for some serenity
Found sparingly burred amongst the now, soon to be out for the new and unseen
That smell of blood on ever green lingers thick around rusted metal copeings
Silck to the touch in a time where travel was cheaper and not as dangerous to hope
As the iris widens and swallows up the light source, thoughts inferior
As quick as they come delete the picture, flickers out from hazel exterior
Earth bound now, we the impressionists vision with a pulse
Kept sombre underneath the trench coat hiding skin and bones
Greying flesh and sunken eyes exposed when the flash bulb blows in the over heads
A grim reminder of how it is, but creatures seem to adapt to the circumstances
Not by choice, of course, since stripped of those basic rights and necessities
After freedom wars were fought and lost, 
population crippled monuments for their victory
Forced to swallow it whole, snap back to the present think not of it now
For the vessel comes to a slow and these thoughts of injustice are getting
a little too loud

[Hook] 

[Verse 2]
Stop with a jolt from the gas breaks intercom, states the destination
Await instructions from that inaudible voice to behave in an orderly fashion
The most efficient way to move the masses conjested - still fear interaction
And this fly by wire systems coldly automatic
Step through the doors, move forward, accend to street level and face it
Hit with a heavy setted orange air that skulks about the naizel
Ignite a time passer and inhale double dose of poison intense
The extremes one takes to feel alive can leave you walking a triggers edge
So follow my designated colour strip due to the segregation laws
Walk with isolation as the people up there talk
The city melts like suspiria, this hyper active realities bold
Break a sweat underneath the red disc, irritates the skin
Salvation is costly, half life inflations a problem
Sold on the one alternative, your time has come to save our economy
Fresh out of options, signed up, roll with the hunted this is my ticket out
At the clinic soon to taste the wonders promised beyond now

[Hook]

[Bridge] {X2}
One last trip neon plains are sick and infected
A happy panic sets in but still dreading the injection
Life clocks been flashing black for a couple of days and I'm spent
So book me into the carousel and put this present to rest</pre>
