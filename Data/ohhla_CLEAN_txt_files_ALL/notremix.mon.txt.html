Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[French Montana]
It's nothing to think about
Montana man

[Chorus]
[French Montana]
I be working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
I'm working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
I'ma get to the money (money)
I'ma get to the money (money)

[Verse 1]
[French Montana]
After hours, four hoes, flying spur, four-door
Stay strapped, 4-4, I can never go broke
Hatin' on a nigga, dickridin' when they see him
In the club tryna keep up with ya re-up, fuck nigga what it ain't
You the boss, let 'em hate
Bad bitches bring 'em in, boyfriend number two
Never cuddling, come again, baby don't be feelin' that (feelin' that)
Coke Wave Gargamel a hit 'em back
GTC with the ceilin' back (ceilin' back)
Homie, wrist white, bricks white, we be dealin' that
Know you niggaz feelin' that (feelin' that)
Homie, Macaroni, he be peelin' that, dog 'em then send 'em back
Nigga I'm the hottest nigga out, fuck a punchline, played out
Go two-player when it's crunchtime, lunch time
Checks lookin' healthy (healthy) bitches on a nigga (nigga)
You know Coke Wave be the niggaz, Montana bitch

[Chorus]
[French Montana]
I be working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
I'm working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
I'ma get to the money (money)
I'ma get to the money (money)

[Verse 2]
[Al Pac]
I'll leak you dude, what it do, fuck these chickens, stack my loot
Niggaz wanna ride the wave, I'm switchin' to a different loop
Every week a different Coupe, everyday a different smut
Bigga told me "Peezly, fuck these haters, get them bigger bucks"
Now I gotta get it in, niggaz can't fuck with him
Al Pac, Montana, niggaz can't fuck with them
Got the streets in a frenzy, all the real niggaz love us
Coke Wave, and we still riding on you muthafuckas
Front, I'ma lay you down, get outta line, spray a pound
All about my money, I ain't come here to play around
Always on the grind, I got money on my mind
Fow worth brick money, all these other niggaz dimes
Got your wifey on my dick, all these bitches screamin', "Oww"
Never sound the same, every song is a different style
Watch my fetti come and pile, trappin' like it's '88
Al Pac, Gain Greene, niggaz gettin' major cake (Ay)

[Chorus]
[French Montana]
I be working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
I'm working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
I'ma get to the money (money)
I'ma get to the money (money)

[Verse 3]
[Mac Mustard]
My niggaz point me in the right path and calculate the right math
A white pad can turn into some light cash
But if you go renegade, leave everything in sight smashed
Baby talkin' 'bout your money even in the white mask
I keep it in pure form, harder than Lennox right jab
You workin' your life away, still ain't kissin' the right ass
This shit is ridiculous, your wifey promiscuous
And them niggaz in your hood ain't feelin' the shit you spit
Let alone the world, this shit'll make your bones curl
Thought you was a player, why you chokin' that girl
You're losing your cool, we still makin' our moves
Jumpin' from stu-to-stu to make it do what it do
Whether it's Coke Wave, Menace From Lenox, tip of the iceberg
We always got the right hooks, always say the right words
Never catch us in tight furs, probably catch us on Rikers
But we set trends, got new ways to cipher

[Chorus]
[French Montana]
I be working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
I'm working in the kitchen, grinding on a mission
I be pitchin' till everything gone, it's nothing to think about
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
Yeah (it's nothing to think about)
I'ma get to the money (money)
I'ma get to the money (money)</pre>
