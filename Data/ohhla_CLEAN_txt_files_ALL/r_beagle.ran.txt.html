[Intro]
What it ISSS!
You are hearing the Random mixtape
My kicks make sticks break
I haven't tried the bricks mate
I nailed this in six takes
I catch tails, cast spells and rap WELL
MySpace dot com slash
Fatty Goodness LOL - go there
("YAYYYYYYYY~!")

[Random]
Yeah, yeah
You're now rollin with the ultimate, hip-hop culturist
Takin over the airwaves with pure explosiveness
Guaranteed to get you open off the sound
Get down, to the hottest radio show in the town
Now - you can jog with us, put us up in your whip and ride with us
Sit tight for about 45 minutes
to the livest, the classic jams
Big Ran (DN3) and that's my man
Or bang this while you sittin in a traffic jam
On your way to your J.O., fresh and not a day old
Shine like Day Glo, AM to the PM
Figured I can't join 'em so we might as well beat 'em

[DN3]
We the cats the mainstream refused, so ain't it typical
They got you strung out on the garbage they made you listen to
The Rhyme Radio contaminate the airwaves
'Bout time for some dope music gettin airplay
The RandomBeagle, don't mess with them sad cowards
Head gon' nod for at least a half an hour
I hear you sayin that these boys are sick
All you gotta do is listen then you down with the clique
DN3 got the mixes that'll sound absurd
and Random got beats and he ill with the words
So on behalf of the rest of the Rhyme
You made the best choice on how you cats invested your time</pre>
