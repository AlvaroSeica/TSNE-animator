Too rude for that shit
Dog boy, come inside

In the aftermay of the bed to won
We celebrate, with the rising sun
The summers dry, God got me on the run
And we won't stop, until the war is won

Becasue we strong, like a green breate
Special forces for peace and unity

Becasue we strong, like a green breate
Special forces for peace and unity

Day to day, song by the song the battle rages on
????soul mighty power up my zong
When I think bout home
when I'm wonderin' why
How'd I end upon this road
It's the effect of my life, why

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runin' liek were runnin the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you

On the road doin' shows
My lifes been crazy 
For the past five years it's been me and my lady
Only good things come to those who truly believe
All the time I spent alone, 
never thought I would leave
Now the life I live and learn 
I ain't takin' nothin' back
With the things that has happened
That be makin' me sad
Another day goes by
Gotta show respect
With the love that I get and I dont regret

Another town pound another show we must erect
Another day closer to being home again
With the tears, blood and sweat
The sacrafices made, there were fans in PA
That we wanted to play
But before gettin' paid
Way back when we were dreamin'
When we worked the nine to five
Cover up the triple beamer
When I never thought I'd leavin'
Have you alwasy by myside
How'd I end upon this road
It's the effect of my life, why

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runnin' like were runnin' the gun
You knwo we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you

Can't stop our ?bowls? penetratin our zone
The freedom fight song
multiplyin' like clones
Everydays a new day
Gettin high feelin' lovely
Light the ?fire? so it rise above me

Treated us right
The mood is wrong
It's the people who fight
Sing this song
So everybody unite
Freedom fighters keep pushin' on

In the aftermay of the bed to won
We celebrate, with the risin' sun
The summers dry, God got me on the run
And we wont stop, until the war is won

Because run for miles, miles never tire
With love of the people you know were inspired, inspired

We sing this song
So the people unite
Freedom fighters fight on

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runnin' like were runnin' the gun
You knwo we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you
you know I'd rather be with you
you know I'd rather be with you</pre>
