[Nasty]
I like this one
Uh hun
Yeah
Nasty
"To the beat..."
I like that
I like that
"To the beat, y'all..." --&gt; Flava Flav
Gemini
"To the beat, y'all..."

[Big Gemini {Nasty}]
(Verse 1)
Steppin' out, so fresh, I'm ready {So fresh}
Valet, take keys to the Chevy {Uh hun}
I'm V.I., but I ain't trippin' on phantom
When he settle with some bitches where the party at {Go ahead}
Yeah
A little drink, a little bombay tab (But watch out)
They say the devil come out with that (But fuck it)
Yeah, the goal is to nob me a dime
But I leave with a seven {Seven}
Eight or nine
Hold up
I like a fine skin tone like cocoa butter
You my tight, come closer, let me touch ya {Touch ya}
Bend over, mama
Shake what you gotta
Side to side, make it wobble {"To the beat, y'all"}
One hand on your hip
Other hand on the trip
Just ridin' up your curves like	"Oooh
Shit"
What you wanna do
I ain't through with you, let's have a rendez-vous {"To the beat, y'all"}
Come on {Let's go}

Chorus: Big Gemini
Hey
You wanna back all in it
Nasty, time to get with it
It's Gemini, yeah, I'm back in the club
And can't nobody do it better than us

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Yeah
Time to fall back in it {Uh}
Nasty
Time to go get 'em
Where the freaks in the house, let me hear ya scream and shout
Better yet, just pourin' 'em out (Cause I'm gonna get ya)
Bounce, bounce, move ya body 'round
Body rock, til the beat knock
If you fine, and you know it, and you smellin' like some roses
If you ain't scared to show it, then move it {"To the beat..."}
Oh
That's how I like it, girl
Might give you a ticket into Gem's world {That's right}
First class, where you shakin' that ass
And when you slow it on down, it makes it easy to grab
You know
Yeah, you know where you goin'
Do what you doin', we gon' keep this shit movin'
Just shake it, shake it
Shiggy-shake it, shake it
I wanna see you just shake it, butt naked

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook:
[Big Gemini] Can't nobody do it better than us
             Can't nobody do it better than us
[Nasty]      "To the beat..."
[Big Gemini] Can't nobody do it better than us
             Can't nobody do it better than us
[Nasty]      "To the beat..."
[Big Gemini] Can't nobody
             Out here just do it better
             Can't nobody
             Out here just do it better

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Big Gemini]
Bounce, bounce
Back all in it
Bounce, bounce
Time to get with it
Bounce, bounce
Back in the club
Better than us
Just shake it, shake it
Back all in it
Just shake it, shake it
Time to get with it
Just shake it, shake it
Shiggy-shake it, shake it
I wanna see you just shake it, butt naked
Rhah!

[Nasty]
Let's go
"To the beat y'all..."</pre>
