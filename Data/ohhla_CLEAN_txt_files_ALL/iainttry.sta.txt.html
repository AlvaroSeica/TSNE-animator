now it's mandatory that I touch bases on this subject
and I don't really care who gets offended or upset
about these females and their attitude towards us
some act stuck up, others try to ignore us
but me, I ain't with that funny style shit
when it comes to these hoes I let 'em know from the git
I ain't trying what you want or you say that you deserve a
bitch slow your roll before you go any further
the name's Mster, baby and I'm smooth as silk sheets
game comes out the mouth everytime that I speak
so back up, cause all I got is one thing in mind
if you ain't on top, then I'ma hit it from behind
Cause I been macking hoes since day one, get the picture
I holla at your homegirl if I see she's thicker
that's the problem oh hell I'm just tryin to kick me a fact
save that attitude for someone else

[Mnmsta - chorus]
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that
you need what?
I ain't tryin' to hear that
check this out
I ain't tryin' to hear that
say what say what say what
I ain't tryin' to hear that
whatever
bitch, I ain't tryin' to hear that
yeah, I did what?
I ain't tryin' to hear that
you seen me with who?
I ain't tryin' to hear that
anyways
bitch, I ain't tryin' to hear that

there was one female in particular that really pissed me off
so sit back and listen as I start this one off
her name was Erica, 5'4, brown skin and thick
she had the kind of body that I'll never forget
it was on when we hooked up
she told me come over
sled to her pad and drama's all I told her
shoulda known better, she was one in ammount
that's why anytime I hit, when I was done I was out
a few months passed by and I had to pick and choose
words grand to my other hoes so I coulda lose
but trying to fuck mines off
but you better think again
Cause I'm quick to bust ya bubble and start macking on your friends
I'm on point with my game so what's oughta twist me
the way I put it down, trick you always gonna miss me
so keep that in mind before you think of getting near that
then save that drame for somebody else

[Mnmsta - chorus]
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that
I don't know her
I ain't tryin' to hear that
don't ask me
I ain't tryin' to hear that
what phone number?
I ain't tryin' to hear that
uhm
bitch, I ain't tryin' to hear that
who seen me?
I ain't tryin' to hear that
wasn't me
I ain't tryin' to hear that
anyways
bitch, I ain't tryin' to hear that

[Mnmsta]
yo, the moral to the story is, trust no hoes
I treat 'em like ants cause they comes and they go
so with that in mind day nothing they can tell me
it'll take more than just trying to overwhelm me
Cause I see right through 'em like my vision's X-ray
game's on deck, all I do is push play
so peep this, as I run game like a sport
and hit more holes than Tiger Woods on the golf course
from the thickests to the air ones
light skin to dark
gotta hit it in the bed, in the ride and in the park
Cause some of these racks tend to think they all that
tryin' to talk shit I'm talkin' mines right back
so you can shake if you want cause I ain't the one to chase ya
get an attitude then I'm quick to replace ya
all they want is something from you
there it is dary
the money for their nails, to go shopping or their hair
but fuck that, hook me up with something for a change
or my other hoes will do it for me and they won't complain
so I'ma sit back with the beer and the sack
and don't be fucking up my high with your drama
Cause I ain't trying to hear that</pre>
