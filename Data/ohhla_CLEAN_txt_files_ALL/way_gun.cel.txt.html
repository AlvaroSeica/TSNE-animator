[Verse One] [Esoteric]
Abandon ship, Esoteric's at the landing strip
Plan to rip your clan to bits
You standing stiff like you inanimate
The jam I spit
Analysts, in such a panic with
They try to cancel it and sample it
Till this there's a better way of understanding it
I know you cannot handle it
I'm on some fancy shit
While your crib is candle lit
But still the candidate 
Quick to dismantle your manuscript
You think you scare me with banana clips?
Well there's no chance of it
My no control vocals, roll over your patrol
I'm pokin holes in heads like I'm makin' totem poles
We're the chosen souls 
(Demigodz rep to the death)
So sucker step to the left, I'm eatin all my older goals
Reading holy scrolls, like I'm reading yesterdays news
On the funny strip, come and rip
Test Shay and lose
Yo I'm rippin' cats total son, ayo you best stay in 2's
Cause my split personality is slayin' y'all crews

[Celph Titled]
Celph Titled's on some real insane sick shit
Cut the presidents face off
And rob a mother fucking bank with it
I sleep with a machete motherfucker I got guns too
That'll put holes in your torso big enough to jump through
We don't recite rap verses, instead we spit grenades
You can't write a rhyme without some fucked up shit to say
When I question you, I won't speak proper I'll ask/axe you
Fuck a meat cleaver, we got heaters and mac millies
Act silly?
And witness the flame of the cannon blast
Recycle your calcium and use your scar tissue to wipe my ass
Send in recruits and I'm turning special forces
Into nothing but skeletons rocking berets and burnt musket blades
In Hells Kitchen we keep the shells spittin'
Don't thing its strange 
We use our block as a shootin' range
Highway to heaven or the devil's cross
And I got explosives that'll make your body land in like ??? coffin

[Chorus] [Scratches]
"And this is the way" 

[Verse Two] [Lord Digga]
Call me Dick Scott Heron
Or heroine
The dope crews veteran
Y'all think that your better than..
Y'all niggas better lay low
I flip MC's, like bricks of yayo
Y'all from Montreal you get your brain exposed
Brook-nam time bomb, watch me explode
Extra magazines, watch me reload
I gotta spit bar code, but niggas cant scare me
Rap with no legs, so niggas can't stand me
I got more jewels then Stanley
Your peppermint patty flows
Nothing but candy
Y'all sweet and weak
And your fuckin up my teeth, cause your all I eat
Reverend Run with guns, but I don't preach
Bust techs get wet like, sex on a beach
Call me a robbin' leech/Robin Leach
I wanna blood money
I smoke MC's like the gummys, y'all ain't gully
My nigga Apathy runnin' up in your baby mothers
I'm fuckin your sisters
Duck tapin' your brothers
Cause them fools didn't believe..
We wasn't brothers we other
Got styles for life, y'all Lifestyle rubbers

[Apathy]
I got metal magnum like I'm Megatron
Metamorph to a weapon, whippin' bitches if they steppin
I'm rippin' tissue to the bloody mess
I'm missin' some vital pieces inside of my cerebellum
Building adrenaline til I'm tremblin'
And tripling my physical mass
To clash with crews
I blast fast and smash fags I'm bad news
I'll bruise brains and rapidly rip apart your anatomy
Cause Apathy is fatter then a Phat Farm faculty
Ap's known for spittin', plus shots I'm lickin'
Got more biscuits then Kentucky Fried chicken
Been chillin' with thugs, that'll fill you with slugs
Since you was pushin hot wheels across your living room rug
I'ma Demigod, God damn it
God please forgive me
God bless, but God forbid kids try to spit for me
I fuck you up spiritually, mentally and physically
Father please forgive wack MC's tryna rap with me</pre>
