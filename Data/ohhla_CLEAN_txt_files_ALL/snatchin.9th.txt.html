[Intro: 9th Prince]
Snotty nose, nigga

[9th Prince]
Yo, I'm a lyrical swordsman, verbal gunman
Straight from the streets and dungeons
A "nigga with an attitude" doing "one hundred miles and running"
With the globe in my posession, automatic weapons
Got niggas falling back, like recession
School is in session, here's a lesson
Never cross the Granddaddy Flow, or you might end up on death row
Bitches swing low
You off target, like a broken arrow
The 9th Prince, I rule like a pharaoh
Through the dark paths that's narrow, drinking wine by the barrel
Sing along like Christmas carols
I'm a leader of a whole new generation
I'm too ill, to have a confrontation
Coming soon, yeah the Killarm' compilation
Gave birth to a whole nation
Revenge of the Iron Fingers invasions
Shootouts in the parking lot of the Day's Inn, blaow

[Chorus: 9th Prince]
Here's a hook for all the crooks
Snatching pocketbooks, niggas is 'space balls' just like Mel Brooks
Ain't no shook hands in Shaolin, guns we be carrying
Here's a hook for all the crooks
Snatching pocketbooks, niggas is 'space balls' just like Mel Brooks
Ain't no shook hands in Shaolin, 9th be Madman

[9th Prince]
Yo, rappers freeze as I roll up in sleeves
So much ice on my wrist, nigga caught a cold breeze
At a 32 below zero degrees, I agree, nigga please
I cause damage like heart disease, I spit like a machine gun
Being handled by a crazy nun
This year the 9th Prince year, I'm hotter than the sun
Niggas on the run, shooting at the cops for fun
Last night at a Brooklyn party
I almost caught a body, my man passed me the shotty
Lodi dodi, bitches shaking they body
I kick rhymes like karate, Tiger and Monkey Style
Understand, sometimes I act wild
After blowing trial, life became foul
Like a juvenile child, one love to Hostyle
Soft pop six nigga, I'm cutting wrists, what?

[Chorus] </pre>
