[Snacho]
gun shots pop...when you out for your block
if you in the hood you bangin' whether you like it or not
it's kind of like gunnin' and I know you see mine
instead I'm counting the days of my life
cause when they wanna these straight bullets gonna take my life
I can't help it I can't be walking around and taking this shit
sneaking around from all of the homies
and get treated like a bitch  (Fuck That!)
I'm doing the best with what I was given
my mom and dad provided the clothes on my back
lord forgive me for my sining
but my homes have sined there's no way for me to win
livin my life day by day looking forward to the end
take me now one by one Senor quitame el dolor
ahorita no quiero jugar hermanita no estoy en el humor
tengo problemas todos los dias cuando voy ala escuela
desago aqui hermanita no preocupes mi jefa
deberianos estar jugando
enbes de pandillas en la calle

gunshooooooooooooooooooot
better hear'em at the night
growing up in the hood holding my pillows tight
gunshooooooooooooooooooot
straight gunnin' stay fly
lord please don't let me catch one tonight

[Lil' Badit]
gunshots waking me up in the middle of the night
I'm holding my pillow tight
and hopin' a straight bullet won't take my life
hey Lord can you please protect me and my family from these bullets
and give predident to those who carry them guns too and they pull it
every day in my hood is the same old thing
gotta watch my back in my own house
I even get jumpy when the telephone rings
Damn!...it's not the life for me to live
growin' up as a little kid worring about my life to live
should be paying outside with my friends havin' fun in my hood
but instead I'm stuck in my house every night
cause these clowns..keep bustin shots...call the cops
it really doesn't matter I just want this noise to stop
Gunshots.......every night in my hood wish they would stop
Gunshots.......doesn't really matter if you call the cops cause they won't stop

gunshooooooooooooooooooot
better hear'em at the night
growing up in the hood holding my pillows tight
gunshooooooooooooooooooot
straight gunnin' stay fly
lord please don't let me catch one tonight

[Silencer]
la pistola sigue tocando la pistola sigue tocando
ando yo pensando que porque se andan matando
cada noche es igual
tirando balalsos en las calles victimas se caen al hospital
every night is all the same I'm wondering when's it gonna change
I'm praying in the night I wish that someone would explain
tell me why.....y dime la verdad
cuando hoigo la pistola pienso que me van a matar
Damn!...it's like this every day and every night
I'm surrounded by violence in the place where people die
what a kid to do when you live on these blocks
when every day all you hear is gunshots
waking up...I hear the noise of a gunshot
no able to sleep tonight I wanna know when's it gonna stop
Damn!...there's a time when you really gotta go
I'm all alone I don't wanna be the next to go

gunshooooooooooooooooooot
better hear'em at the night
growing up in the hood holding my pillows tight
gunshooooooooooooooooooot
straight gunnin' stay fly
lord please don't let me catch one tonight</pre>
