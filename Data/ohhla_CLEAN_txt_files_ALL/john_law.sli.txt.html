Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I never thought too much about politics
I never cared for the law
There's only one thing on my mind
God damn i need my alcohol
And if you ask me no more questions
I'm sure to tell you no lies
When 1 and 1 is adding up to 3
Someone is shooting up a line
I'm gonna go break the law
I'm getting' sick of it all
And as i'm waiting at the bus stop
I hear a mean old yell
And here he comes mister johnny fuckin' law
He's got me scared as
He's got me scared as hell
And if you think he's got me cornered
As soon as i get my nine
Somebody out there dial 911
It doesnt cost you a dime
I'm gonna go break the law
I'm gettin' sick of it all
I'm gonna go break the law
I'm getting' sick of it all
Fuck it
Fuck you too</pre>
