[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Yea, feel the cool breeze... yea...

[Chorus 2X: Fes Taylor w/ ad-libs]
We got the block popping, clubs they booty popping
Our life like a movie, you're just watching
We right there, listen, we right there
Yea, we right there, uh-huh, we right there, right there

[Fes Taylor]
I tour a lot of states, I saw a lot of cake
Hood to hood, only thing change is the plates
I pitch right over the plate, steel plate, third, wait
For a chance, I could slide over home base
Mobile phone vibrate, I'm eating live bake
While I try to LandShark, that was back in '98
Try and cop the '08, grind 'til we so straight
Real estate options, thing I'm 'bout to buy a rose gate

[Lon Dini]
Every word I jot is crystal clear
If I got love for ya state, or been there
Look, I'm right here, I don't care if you get drunk off beers
Or throw a chair, many nights fight with them kids, still I'm right here
This is nothing like the Chingy song, mami sing along
You looking mighty think in that thong, why don't you take it off?
I ain't in Miami for nothing, came to see Ricky Ross
Dude said he got it for cheap, I need a brick of soft

[Chorus 2X]

[L.I.S.]
This is for my Warriors in Omaha, Nebraska
My sag nasty blasters, my Kansas City flashers
My wolves on the grind, they do it cuz they have to
State true to their lines and move crowds like a pastor
I'm proof it's our time, I've walked the fine line
I've been labelled a good seed and labelled a slime crime
I've cracked divine minds and I ain't even in my prime
I rep for all states by New York is mine

[Pa Bazil]
It's like, such preportions of thoughts that he conjures
Nobody's touching the crew, they're too enormous
Yup, you should've warned up before they come upon them
Now he gotta prepare for full blown war shit
Full throttle with more models than Patron bottles
Some swallow, some gargle, but you know they all follow
I'll probably call Lot-a, tell 'em that they got a winner
Matter of fact, keep ya dollar, I'm running with go-getters

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
