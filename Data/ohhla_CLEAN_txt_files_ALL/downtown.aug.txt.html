[August Alsina]
Word got around that a nigga got shot
Heard a nigga drew down and he bucked so his ass got popped
We was on my block tryin' to move these rocks
Tryin' to stack this cash on the low, gotta duck these cops
We was right off 3rd and Pollock, chillin' in the back of the track, niggas got packs tryin' to get them racks
X5 I was ridin' in the back with the brothers 'round kickin' with the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams, drinkin' 4 LOKO, Sprite and codeine
First class I was on lean, said fuck high school so I left Reed
No one told me life would be this way (I swear nobody told me)
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same

[Chorus: August Alsina]
People dyin' every day, that ain't nothing new 
when you from doooowntown, doooowntown
Out'chea tryin' to make a way, I won't let these niggas 

take me dooown dooown, doooown
(So I riiiiiiiiide) Ridin' on these niggas, I be ridin', I be ridin' on 'em
Ridin' on these niggas, I be ridin', I be ridin' on 'em
(So I riiiiiiiiide) Ridin' on these niggas, I be ridin', I be ridin' on 'em
Ridin' on these niggas, I be ridin', I be ridin' on 'em

[August Alsina]
Phone just rang, heard a nigga got got
He was over on the East last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't gettin' no love from the cops, nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was, my heart near damn stop - somebody done killed my brother
Now I gotta get back, let 'em know cause a nigga gotta feel that
Sittin' shotgun with the shotgun; when you hear the shots come, nigga don't run
Already bad, it can only get worse, hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse, never saw 25, had to put 'em in the dirt
No one told me life would be this way (I swear nobody told me)
Guess this is the game we chose to play 
Crazy how it's always been the same

[Chorus]

[Kidd Kidd]
Hah.. once upon a time downtown in the 9 (9th Ward) where they don't mind dyin'
Sworn to a life of crime, was a youngin' only stood 5'5, big money on his mind
Clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on the iron, shot six times run in front of my mom (dear Lord)
Alive at 32, man I'm lucky to survive; on that Pac juice, real niggas don't die
Bitch, I'm from A-town (huh) slang crack on the same side, blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked (blaow)
Home Gs like A' wacks; they've be doin' this shit way back since A track (free PJ)
And we get around, you can't get, you can get fame there from the way you're goin' to bang that (huh)
Truth from the head watch how you aim that (aim that) price on your head and we gonna take that (take that)
It's about to go down, you ain't about this then you better go now
Sun goin' down, keep it goin' down, everybody lay down, ski mask down (huh)
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown, last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way, this ain't nothing new when you grew up downtown - HUH!
