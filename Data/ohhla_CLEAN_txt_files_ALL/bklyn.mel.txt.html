(Why do you like soul?)		[ *scratched* ]

Once again, this is another slammin jam from Boogie Down Productions
As you may already know KRS-One is from the Bronx
But I'm Ms. Melodie and I'm from Brooklyn
And this is dedicated to you
Special Request
To Rebel Souls
Sly &amp; Robbie
Heavy D
Lady V
Mikey Dread
Steel Pulse
And of course
The BDP Posse
And I wanna break it down like this

B..B..B..Brooklyn
B..b..b..bo-skank - hey
B..B..B..Brooklyn
B..b..b..bo-skank
You know you don't want Brooklyn to come run ya down
You know you don't want Brooklyn to come run ya down
My name is Melodie, I've got the A1 sound
And when I go on tour I go from town to town
Come back to New York City and I'm Brooklyn-bound
Some people wish to stop me but I'm trackin em down
I fuck off them head and watch them fall to the ground
Cause 'we are livin up in a very bad world
[ *singing the lines from Madonna's 'Material Girl'* ]
And I am a very bad girl'
See, 'we are livin up in a very bad world
And I am a very bad girl'
Break
I've got a posse over there and over here
Ms. Melodie walks through the city with no fear
I get along with my brothers and my sisters
Everyone knows, even the misses and the misters
Happy-go-luck, intelligent, not a dummy
I know who I am, therefore the suckers can't run me
Only look and wonder who I really am
And how I rock the party from the AM to the PM
'Who is her designer, where does she get her style?'
But I just hold my head up and flash a smile
Cause most mean well, the rest mean bad and wanna boo you
I say to myself, 'I got a posse that can do you'
So when do you take the time to just come out
Come out your shell and let it all hang out?
I am the type of person that figures
If it gets too damn wild I'm pullin triggers
And if there's a posse out there that feels the same
Turn on your brain and try to restrain
My name is M-e-l-o-d-i-e
Guaranteed to rock most of the illest posses
Pause.. only because
Lyrics like these can start wars
So when do you take the time to just come out
Come out your shell and let it all hang out
B-r-o-o-k-l-y-n again
Here is a message that starts but has no end
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
Your rhymes were not made to hurt me
Ha, just bounce right off and alert me
Cause 'we are livin up in a very bad world
And I am a very bad girl'
See, 'we are livin up in a very bad world
And I am a very bad girl'
Break

(Why do you like soul?)

You know I have not come to down the other women
I make my own money, I got my own opinion
I write my own lyrics, make my own calculations
View the situation
I am musically inclined I find my lyrics jump
The bass atop the high, it's like a thump
Them wanna keep in mind the fact that I'm a loner
Born in Brooklyn, first name Ramona
Don't play no games and no games are played
I rather invade, create, and get paid
You call yourself a star? I am the solar system
For those that have a problem with that, I just diss them
Cause super dope vocals seem to be the remedy
For sucker MC's out here my name is Me-Me-Melodie

B..B..B..Brooklyn
B..b..b..bo-skank - hey
B..B..B..Brooklyn
B..b..b..bo-skank
You know you don't want Brooklyn to come run ya down
You know you don't want Brooklyn to come run ya down
My name is Melodie, I've got the A1 sound

(Why do you like soul?)

(Because it makes me - happy)</pre>
