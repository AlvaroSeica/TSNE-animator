[Verse 1]
I make ruthless records consecutive, disconnect your wig
Wet you in your living room, Disrespect your kids
Spit fire at you, pop pop, cause your body to ooze
Bill, anything I spit uncle howie improved
There ain't no justice and there ain't no peace
These mean streets are like the evil dead eager to feast
Soul chasers will leave you diseased, what you get dealin with creeps
People sleep until we cause the desert eagles to speak
There's no love and no loyalty left
Learn ya lesson, the hood shot rich porter to death
Only the hood die young, rest in peace to Jam Masta Jay, Biggie and Pac
And all the rest who passed away
I'm like an animal, tryin to survive
Striving for a better tomorrow, the world's full of terror and sorrow
Tears drop from a little baby boy or girl
While the push of a button could destroy the world

[Chorus X2]
It's a overkill, no escapin this we raping this homie
It's a overkill, expose to nuclear radiation
It's a overkill, push the chromosone chromosplode
It's a overkill, peep the overfiend overload

[Verse 2]
Hit you with the nine shell in your head like Kleinfeld
My mind's swelled I laugh at it like Seinfeld
Or Larry David, the blast off like Larry Davis
We carry bangers and air you out like airplane hangers
I rock 5 star general status, projects to Paris
At the Hilton stickin foreign objects in Paris
I'm very paranoid tell me what they asked you, splash you
Nuke you like fast food, splatter you when I clap tools
I keep it simple like grass roots, attack troops
Ghetto gorillas in track suits, wet up your whole shit like a bathroom
I catch fools slippin and hit 'em with capsules of blow cause cash rules
the truth newport carton junkies and street trash, wheat grass
Customers cop hundreds of weed bags, yeah I was chosen to kill those who are smoking the krills
Sold it to you out the old seville, yo you know the drill

[Chorus X2]
It's a overkill, no escapin this we raping this homie
It's a overkill, expose to nuclear radiation
It's a overkill, push the chromosone chromosplode
It's a overkill, peep the overfiend overload

[Verse 3]
Go overboard, this is Ill Bill the overlord, go to war
I approach you with a trojan horse, entire armies are slaughtered
Explosions of gore, soldiers fall, hot enough to cause your bones to disolve
Go through walls, Let the don use it, mix it with orange juice and abuse it
Throw your guns in the air and lose it, gangstas and goons wit uzis
We underhanded money, rubberbanded the son of sam, son of man
People too stupid to understand, Im the host with the most
Travel coast to coast, rollin like nostra coke, when I post the toast
Leace you wetter than PCP dispose of folks, loced out leave you with holes
Your clothes are soaked, you fuckin shithead your thought process is idiotic
It gets worse blow a hole in your head, leave you retarded, look at you know
Stupid fuck see what you started, I won't stop till all of are dearly departed

[Chorus X2]
It's a overkill, no escapin this we raping this homie
It's a overkill, expose to nuclear radiation
It's a overkill, push the chromosone chromosplode
It's a overkill, peep the overfiend overload</pre>
