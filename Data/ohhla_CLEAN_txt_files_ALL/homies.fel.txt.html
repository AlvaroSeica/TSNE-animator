[Nino Brown]
Yeah
Wanna come fuck with this G-Spot shit
This ain't no glock, motherfucker {*rapid gunshots*}
Feel it

[A.L.T. (Nino Brown in background)]
(Verse 1)
3:37 on the dot
Silence got broke by a shot
My homey's in a knot
Can you untie me, can you get out this tangle
Let's peep the situation now at every angle
(One) You could ditch the gun and live on the run (Hun)
(Two) You could get caught and get draped in blue
(Three) Leave it up to me and live care free
(Ha ha...) He picked number three
Now pass me the gun so I could wipe off the prints
And leave town for about a month, here's some mints
He gave me his shirt and his blood stained pants
I soaked 'em with alcohol, then I lit up a match
Ashes
I put the gun in the bag
And buried that nickel plated .44 mag
Now he's out of trouble, he's gonna go free
It's all good, cause he would have been there for me

Chorus: A.L.T.
I gotta be there for my homeys
Cause my homeboys are always there for me
I said I gotta be there for my homeys
Even if it's murder in the first degree
I gotta be there for my homeys
Cause my homeboys are always there for me
I said I gotta be there for my homeys
Even if it's murder in the first degree

(Verse 2)
Rollin' up the block in a G ride, and it's a hoopty
Gettin' revenge on some fools that tried to shoot me
But they missed 'em, hit my homey with the glock
Now he's in the wheel chair, and he probably won't walk
Tonight's The Night like Betty Wright
I got the infra red to they head, they in sight
Now should I spill his blood (Hell yeah, why is that) {*gun cocked*}
Because that shit wasn't right
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, now I owe you one fool
If he wouldn't have tried, then he wouldn't have died
And his momma wouldn't be by his side (Full of tears)
I got popped for the crimes
And my sentence was consecutive life times
And that means I'll never go free
It's all good, cause he would have been there for me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Nino Brown]
9:10 in the mornin' and my homey's gone
Ask forgiveness from the Father cause he know it's on, yeah
Situation number, do or die
I can hear my mother sayin' on that rosary, and I
Know it's wrong in the first degree
But I know he do that same old dirt for me
So I, snapped a nina cause it's goin' down
And there ain't no turnin' back cause it's that color brown, yeah
My blood brother done lost a fight
So I gots to gets that buster 'fore the early light (Hun)
I see him clownin' on the avenue (Hun)
My shit is buckin' and it's burnin' through (Hun)
I got that ass on the telescope {*gunshot*}
Stuck that fool for my homey Loc (Hun)
I must admit that shit be feelin' good
Just another day on the east side of the hood

Repeat Chorus</pre>
