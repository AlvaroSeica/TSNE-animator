Ay Swizz, you shoulda put me on this
Let's go - SONGZ!

Chillin in the Rova, listenin to Hova
Dirt up off of my shoulder, she dig it like a golfer
Fitted on lean while I'm sippin on lean
Feelin on me, while she drink it like a soda
Freeeze, freeze
Tell the fellas it's over, tell 'em he hella colder
They ain't better than me, hell'll be frozen over
I am never to be thought of nothin but soilder
Yup~! Third degree track, put in the toaster
Burnt!! {*echoes*} You could, you could, you could
You could light a match on that
I could put stacks on that, fact is that
I am like a candle, burn like wax on tracks
This man to break a nigga back on tracks
Uhh - relax for what?
I'ma ball 'til I fall then I'm right back up
White slacked up, Louis V sneakers
Singin to the bitches and spittin like ether

[Chorus]
Freeze! You know who it is
It's Songz nigga

[Trey Songz]
Virginia on my back like a spine
Spend ten stacks like a dime, put the prince back in his time
To bring sense back in the rhymes
A lot of dudes spit, but it's few that's intense
like they missin they mind, and they slip while I climb
Hey, get a grip, catch a line
I'm pullin on piff all the time, come and get a whiff
All the dummies in this bitch get live
Whatever I'm lackin, I'ma get mine
There's room for growth, and I'm fin' to get wide
There's room to boast, and I'm fin' to get fly
I speak the truth, while a lot of dudes lie
Tell me what you would do if you had to survive
I could eat the booth, a lot of dudes would die
Not I, ha ha... who wan' test me?</pre>
