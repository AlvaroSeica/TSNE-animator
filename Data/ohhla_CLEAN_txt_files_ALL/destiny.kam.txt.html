Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) 2x
I wonder what people expect to see?
Real Hip-Hop do it till is the death of me
It's not my time on the Clock of Destiny
Long as I'm real then I did it successfully

[Chief Kamachi]
Ayo, the mic is done, early 90's when my hype begun
Bullseye, AK-47 the rifle lung
Ten years later, still stepping the cipher, son
I'm here; underground legend is what the cycle brung
Classic, murder material on the four track
Old school, wheels of steel keeping the four pack
Late night, gang war niggas getting their jaw cracked
Hundred dollar talent show, spitting the raw rap
Give me a mic and a red Philly ball cap
First demo tape in the trash, not a call back
I kept it moving cuz I knew I would break free
Back in the studio, get ready for take three
Gorilla on a mic, little Mach was a straight G
First deal at fifteen, never Christine
Write a rhyme for a Benz, make the wrist gleam
Niggas in the street is stars, I hit the strip CREAM

(Chorus) 2x

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, I see a big future in music
Hope I got the right mirror
Came up in the Nike era
Tryna be a mic terror
'Follow the Leader' dropped album was a light-bearer
Studied the game, got the slang and my sight clearer
Poster of MC Lyte, I use to write Mira
Ponder my musical genre, its quiet rarer
So I fall back, look at the mall rap
Album ain't sell, people know that I'm all that
Was once told my career would suffer a curse by an Old Ghost
While he was smoking a dust in a hearse
Been around the globe couple times crushing a verse
Fairly unknown, people still in love with the worst
Back to trance, small ass rap advance
They wanna see little Sambo tap and dance
I'm like Tucson teaming up with blacks in France
Kamachi! Still in that classic stance


(Chorus) 2x </pre>
