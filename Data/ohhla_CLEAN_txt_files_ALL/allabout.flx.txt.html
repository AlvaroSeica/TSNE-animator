[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah Yeah! Raekwon teflon in this mu'fucker
Yo Estelle whattup what's good?
Wonder what's the whistle? Show niggas the power right now

[Chorus: Estelle]
This is the wrong time (Time) But I wish you were all mine (Mine)
I ain't tryin to wait, listen to faith but what's a man to do (What's a man to do)
Said I'm all confused (All confused) When you ain't tryin to chose (Tryin to chose)
Whether I win or lose, baby, yeah it's all about you, all about you, it's all about you
(All about you) Said it's all about you (All about you) Said it's all about you
(All about you) Yeah it's all about you, all about you, all about you

[Verse One: Raekwon]
Aiyyo! It been about me I'm a king from the rip
My old millionaire style my swag on dip
Stay fresh, in the freshest places, flip papers
Fly 'round bugattis and yachts, holdin knots
Claimed relations, it's like hittin the lotto winnin
More money more problems you gotta be kiddin
I rather sit up in The Bronx and polly some shit up
I'm usually breakin out aces slayin some sit ups
Boo! It's tight times let me hustle
'Cause anything you want I'm there, with all muscle
'Cause when I'm in the streets we eatin, more ruffles
Then we can play the suites in Vegas, all the duffles
'Cause you the queen I'm the king be a rider
A man with a gameplan stressin, ain't a rider
So let me paint pictures stay crisp we providers
We real, realer than real, word to mamas

[Chorus: Estelle]
This is the wrong time (Time) But I wish you were all mine (Mine)
I ain't tryin to wait, listen to faith but what's a man to do (What's a man to do)
Said I'm all confused (All confused) When you ain't tryin to chose (Tryin to chose)
Whether I win or lose, baby, yeah it's all about you, all about you, it's all about you
(All about you) Said it's all about you (All about you) Said it's all about you
(All about you) Yeah it's all about you, all about you, all about you

[Verse Two: Raekwon]
Kingpin Chef in the town, keep a hundred
Ice on his neck and his arms with more money
Jump into the two fifty joint gettin blunted
Pockets carry more than a stack we all frontin
Rich black african dons gettin cheddar
Shorty know better let's blow bring the beretta
Showin off the vault you walk nigga your welcome
Or you can stay here and be rich with me and help 'em
I'm just crazy with it fly slick intelligence
He play high in the strips and flip pelicans
My whole clique is in this bitch ten elephants
Who stay fresher than us?! That's irrelevant
True! Yeah +Nuttin But A G Thang+
Whoa! Yeah they be comin through peep game
Boo! I know it's over baby keep playin
Oops! I'm out of energy, Street King

[Chorus: Estelle]
This is the wrong time (Time) But I wish you were all mine (Mine)
I ain't tryin to wait, listen to faith but what's a man to do (What's a man to do)
Said I'm all confused (All confused) When you ain't tryin to chose (Tryin to chose)
Whether I win or lose, baby, yeah it's all about you, all about you, it's all about you
(All about you) Said it's all about you (All about you) Said it's all about you
(All about you) Yeah it's all about you, all about you, all about you

[Outro: Raekwon]
It's about me right? It's about that rich fly live nigga man!
That hold the fort every time man, anytime you see me I'm rollin
I'm rollin right believe that!</pre>
