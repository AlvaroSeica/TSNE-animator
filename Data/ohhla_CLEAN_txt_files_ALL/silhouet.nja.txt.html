[Verse 1]
Bash with the brass knuckles, fast, I dash through the black 
Tunnel smash, pummel, bastards gasp at the flashed muzzle				
Vast trouble, I laugh when you act puzzled, 
Attack, scuffle you're slashed when we clash, rumble		
Stab at your calf muscle, shedding blood
Passed when wrath touched you, rest in mud					
Hedious assault ships, pitiless and lawless
Grimly, ninja stalks swift, howl, bite ya
Foul fighter, rounds fired
Style's liver than al quada, wild tiger 			
Guile sniper, conceals position
Vile, slice ya, fullfill the mission				
My thrill's affliction, off kilter, I've killed
Civilians I feel surge, I wield Dominion				
Yes the brute is, vicious and cruel
Executed, finishing move					

[Verse 2]
March in dark shadows, come with darts and the sharp    
Arrows, tomahawk, squads distraught as I start battle  	
Barrage with ammo, you dodge and scramble
Crews scarred, they're fubar, I'm too hard to handle			
Shoot off your ankles, you collapse to the floor
Massacre, gore attack with the axe or the sword	
After the war you all grieve, damage in brawls with warp speed
Challengers fall they lost lead, slam with missiles
That bore through fence, jam signals 
And crawl through vents, you're fraudulent
I'm the truth revealed, salute or kneel, refuse
And I'll shoot to kill, cold heartedly
Don't spar with me, lone's marring so far
Foes start to bleed, 
When killer's vex, sever slash, it's mayhem
The silhouette, better man your station</pre>
