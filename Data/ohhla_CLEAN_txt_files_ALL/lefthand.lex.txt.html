Album:  It's the L!!
Song:   Left Hand Man
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

See my right hand man is a left-handed man
My man Big Oak is on the left mic stand

And my right hand man is a right-handed man
My man Nick Fury's on the right mic stand

And we are (L-E) X-I (C-O) N
RUN AND, TELL A, FRIEND

[repeat 2X]
Said we are (L-E) X-I (C-O) N
RUN AND, TELL A, FRIEND

[Verse One]
Yo, I'm out the gate like a caged dog that never ate
but had a taste of blood so now he wants the steak
I'll take the cake, cause Oak'll slay fakes
from L.A. to the Great Lakes from sundown to daybreak
(Okay) I'll spare y'all the details
because today it seems like everybody has A.D.D.
When all you really need to understand is that we will be
the most dynamic MC duo no if buts or maybes
I'll send this warning, cause I've been doin this
since Fab 5 Freddy held down Saturday mornings
Try to wipe the sleep out your eyes and stop the snoring
Cause when it, rains and what, well now it's pouring

[Verse Two]
See, I live just polite (polite)
Meant to drive around with my windows at night
Love to live, live to explore
I'm out for twenty-five points with at least ten boards (ten boards)
Got a profession, I call it emceein
Unfortunately that's not what my degree's in
I make it hot when it's ten below freezin
And make it cold when it's hard to keep breathin
Life (man) that's what I believe in
Not stupid shit where I'll wind up bleedin
Prefer shit that'll keep the crowd rockin
and inspire heads noddin inside the Walkman

[Hook: repeat 2X]
My right hand man is a left-handed man
My man Big Oak is on the left mic stand
  And my right hand man is a right-handed man
  My man Nick Fury's on the right mic stand

And we are (L-E) X-I (C-O) N
RUN AND, TELL A, FRIEND

[repeat 3X]
Said we are (L-E) X-I (C-O) N
RUN AND, TELL A, FRIEND

[Verse Three]
Straight out the Greenfield Academy, went up to Rum Nasty
I'm a long time tenant while you just moved in last week
See we're the L-E, X-I, C-O
Man you know the rest, I deliver like the P.O.

See I can see what makes you run like C-3PO
Got the East side of town sayin, "Dios mios!"
Senor Fury got the homies, balls and gall
All in all I keep swingin, 'til all will fall
Mashin all boulevard, represent represent, said
  Lexicon, represent represent
When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was "Steve Biko"

Don't be so, stingy with the mic, cut the leash let him out
My brain is gettin bigger and my head is fillin out
And if my head is fillin out then the words are spillin out
Catch 'em if you can or else keep sleepin on the couch

So we just leave 'em there to sleep (that's right)
Cause when you're sleepin and your eyes can't see (no sight)
But me?  I'm wide-eyed like Japanimation
All these amped up rappers need to take a vacation
(and relax a bit) that's just the half of it
The other half is the fact that they're wack
But I ignore that, sit on the balcony and inhale fog
and exhale the bullshit into the smog

[Hook]

And we are (L-E) X-I (C-O) N
RUN AND, TELL A, FRIEND

[repeat 3X]
Said we are (L-E) X-I (C-O) N
RUN AND, TELL A, FRIEND</pre>
