[Intro: Akon]
I can see it
It's funny man cause it's like it's not goin nowhere
And you gon' see it wherever there's struggle, knahmean?
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
I see my pain in yo' eyes man, so I know you feelin me
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
It's that twinkle man, that sign of struggle
I've seen it, in me
 
[Akon]
Cause everyday I can't help but see it
That people ain't satisfied
And you're hatin your 9 to 5
And e'rybody wanna live another life
But ain't no length you go or mountain you climb
Not to better your days
But all that would do is leave room for people to say
I guess you're livin better now
Share a little of that cheddar now
Cause I remember days back when
a brother was hustlin and robbin too
I done tossed the Baretta now
On a whole 'nother level now
Still I can't enjoy my fame
Unless my people doin the same and gettin money too
 
[Chorus: Akon]
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
Ohh once in a while {"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
And I can see that you don't ever wanna struggle no more
Struggle no more
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
Ooh yeah {"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more
 
[Akon]
Cause every time you ask me, I'm grindin
It shouldn't have to be that way
You shouldn't have to pay my way
I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day
Got a little little problem on the way
Bounty hunters checkin state to state
Child support lady on your case
Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid
"Oh what must I do?" is what you'll be askin
God please hold it down for me
Don't let Satan get ahold of me
I'm tryin to tell you it can happen to me too
But it happened a lot worse to my brother
Muhammad, I thank God he recovered, yeah
 
[Chorus] w/ variations + ad libs
 
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
 
[Akon]
Cause I see your pain now (ooh yeah)
Cause I see your pain now (ooh yeah)
And I can feel you strain now (I can feel you straining)
And I can see you cryin
And inside you're dyin (inside you're dyin)
You're no longer the same now (cause you got to)
But you gotta maintain now (cause you got to maintain)
 
[Chorus] - 2X w/ variations + ad libs
 
[Akon]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah</pre>
