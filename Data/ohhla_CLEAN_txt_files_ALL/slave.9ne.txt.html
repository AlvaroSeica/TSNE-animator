Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Fight the pain, inside the rain
A rebel know, to let the devil go
So now to get paid, about to be working like a slave

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm kinda good, kinda bad, kinda get money can't be mad
I'm kinda broke but I'm kinda rich
Wishing I had a corner I could put a bitch in
They ain't gonna do nothing
Ain't like I'm suffering
Food for my baby's mouth
Then I bought a house for my baby mother and
What's wrong? I try, don't matter, still die
I'm strong, but I'm not
When I'm alone, I cry
Out for you, it's hard to do
I can't see you so doubt for you
When out my mouth I sprout the noose
Too much vodka and mountain dew
Explainin' what I be meanin'
If you listen fast you think I was a Heathen
But the last Sunday receivin' the preacher from the pastor
Ain't even believin' the bastard
But no Hades, god's baby
God made me, a little crazy
And I'm off, I'm gone
My life is my songs
What I mean when I sing, still on a wing and a prayer
But if I listen to what is written in the scriptures maybe it will get me there
Share with the people I swear it is an evil scam that might be in vain
But if I say I I'm the genius then like jesus everybody gonna know my name
(KALI)

[Chorus]
I've been working like a slave oh, lord
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong
I know, I know that there's no peace in my shelter
There's going to be no peace in my shelter

[Verse 2: Kutt Callhoun]
[OHH LORD LORD LORD]
I need reparations due to devastation from the state of present situations
And it's not easy to walk a narrow path in my jeans
It's hard when your family wondering when your going to make another
Stop leaving, stop breathing for a minute cuz it's all artificial when the laws trying to get you
When them haters right behind em and you wanna shove a double barrel sawed off in your dental
What can I do to stop a big catastrophe
When niggas after me and bitches after me
Wanna have my baby, listen niggas lady
Trials and tribulations tackle me
My mama think I made it, she feeling elated
Proud of her only son born
My kids think I'm the greatest
I cannot display this
Smile feelin like a funyon
(Salty and all) you'll be (locked in a stall) trying (lost in the cause) truly, no denying
Ain't nobody gonna do it for me
For the moment let it drive me insane
Solicitation of a prostitute
Cuz you a ho when you're playing this game
But it's okay, I am gonna to ride till I triumph
Cause everybody once upon a time was a slave
This is Callhoun

[Chorus]
I've been working like a slave oh, lord
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong, I know
I know there's no peace in my shelter

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I work, I play, and I drink booze every day
tryin to muffle the blues
Imma say used in a way
Fools run astray
Allah, God, Jesus, Jah somebody please help me
Mama got a problem with diabetes it don't seem healthy
Everything depends on ninna fame hittin dantez sr
Got a nigga thinkin some of the fans I'm makin would they wanna do me like Selina
Devil laughin like a hijena
Losin all the good in my demeanor
I don't wanna go psycho
But choke the flow you know I got ta go and charlie sheen yaa
Tryina stay good with the old lady
My mind made it go crazy no time for my poor babies
So don't let a motherfucker play me
When I say FU pay me
Even though I'm gettin' money you could still see I'm hungry like I'm in Haiti
What am I to do? What am I to you?
Bought alot of coo, but im not immune
Can't you see? I'm stressed not free
From yall. I'm sick. My body's hot
If in this (pressure) don't let up this will probably stop for
Technina..

[Chorus]
I've been working like a slave for long
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong
(I been wrong)
I know, I know that there's no peace in my shelter
There's no peace</pre>
