[Trey Songz]
Girl I want you face down first thing when I wake up
Already got you covered girl ain't no need for make-up
I just need a camera and someone to tape us
Internet ain't ready for the way that we gon' make love
Got me fiendin right now, girl I need you right now
Tryin to hold back but you can get it
Don't tease me right now, baby please me right now
Girl scream yes if you with it

[Chorus One: Trey Songz]
Got, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you
When I'm goin through withdrawls tell me what I'm 'sposed to do
Cause I need your love, I want your love
Girl it ain't the same if I ain't got your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I want is you baby, all I want is you baby
All I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug
All I want is you babe, only one is you baby

[Dirty Money]

I know you wanna hit it, want me to be your little slut
If you do it good, boy I'll return the favor
Baby I'm tired of the bed I wanna try it on the table

Come a-come a, come a little closer you can get it
Don't tease me right now, better please me right now
Let your tongue walk on this pussy!!

[Chorus Two: Dirty Money]
Got, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you

Boy it ain't the same if I ain't got your love

You takin too long to make up your mind baby

Real estate in the states, spillin in Philly yo

Cocky nigga still half cockin my Yankee fitted
My wrists Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, Jacob did it
Early birds, furry furs
His and hers, baby girl silver spurs
You know I stay on my grind and she be right there
The shit I'm doin won't be seen or done for light years
Talkin me and you, the world is ours
All we need is our love, money, and the power
Talk to 'em

Your sex (your sex) is my drug (is my drug)
Boy I need your body here tonight
