Turn that shit up loud, please

Let's get to the point
(Funky)
(How can we do it?)
Kool Rock's in the joint
(Funky)

[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
Oh yes'n back in the mess'n
Say it sort of fresh'n, stop your guessin
Kool Rock the roller is back again'a
Clap your hands and dance, my friend'a
Let's get to the point'n
While Kool Rock's in the joint'n
The bass is in the place'n
I'm the one you're facin
You need to relax it, I'm gonna tax it
My homie DJ Slice in the back is gonna scratch it
So tell me somethin or better yet nothin
The beat has got you goin, so here I come'n
You need the rapper, the scratcher and the poet
The Rock is on the block, sucker, yeah you know this
I got you movin, also got you groovin
For you and your crew'n, that's what I'm doin
I'm makin money and cash and gettin paid
And after that to the 'tel - to get laid

(1, 2, 3)
It's easy as 1, a 2, a 3
All the sap suckers out here

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
I met this girl named Dinah somewhere in Carolina
A body so divine'a, some say it couldn't be finer
Just got off the plane when she started spittin game
She said, "Ah pardon me sir but ah what's your name?"
My name is Jay, baby, but I got to go
I ain't tryina front, I'm just lettin ya know
She kept on tryin, I mean like really hard'a
And then she got dissed by my big bodyguard'a
I jumped into the limo, lookin real fresh'a
With fat gold chains on my motherfuckin neck'a
I'm all about the money and I'm not about the playin
So all the perpetrators better hear what I'm sayin
Day by day and week by week'n
Hoes are so nosey, take a peek'n
You wanna know my business? What is this?
I'm cold crusher, can I get a witness?
I love the sound'n as I throw down then
I got the kinda bass that's movin the ground and
I'm on the scene and rock, shock and rollin
Kool Rock Jay's rockin the house cold controllin

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
To the crews of 2's, 4, 5 and 6's
My DJ's on the scratch and he just might mix it
Now some say it's beatin and others say it's slammin
Mix 'em up both and say it's blammin
You want the sound'n, breakin up the ground'n
I like the beat that's sweet and poundin
Straight money maker, MC vindicator
Take it to the hoop like the LA Lakers
Runnin, stunnin, son of a gun'n
Grab your partner, do the dancin, and have some fun'n
Just relax and then you wanna max
As my homie DJ Slice cold cuts the wax
But then you remember what I said
And keep the dope rhymes in your goddamn head
And I'll be gone for the rest of the day
Kool Rock Jay's gonna say that the brother don't play

[ VERSE 4: Kool Rock Jay ]
Tearin up the house'n, why you act a fool'n?
I teach you a lesson, so let's go to school'n
Old school, new school, wherever you're standin
My rhymes are the seeds, in your brain they're planted
So let's make a deal, see if you can guess
And if you learn half-way then I'll explain the rest
Chillin at the pad watchin cable TV'n
Can't really show ya, let me explain what I'm seein
A man with a ski mask and a big kitchen knife
Chased a girl at a camp, 'bout to take her life
You just can't relate to the cable TV
So I hit the play buttton and pump the beat</pre>
