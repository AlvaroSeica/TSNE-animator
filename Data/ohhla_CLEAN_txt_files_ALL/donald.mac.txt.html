[Mac Miller]
Aiyyo the flyest muh'fucker in the room yeah you know it's me
Bitches hatin on him cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house, on the couch, watchin cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin when you stop and just say fuck it
Cause you walkin out in public and you hear 'em talkin rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch, somewhere get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in, got these hoes that used to play me in they bras
We gonna take over the world while these haters gettin mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad
It's a wrap

[Mac Miller]
And motherfuckers think they know me but they never met the +Kids+
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch, that she better bring her friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah the party never ends, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe before me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky but these girls be actin tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]</pre>
