Uh, uh
Uh, uh

Hey boy do you wanna use me
Got something much better than sushi
My, my, my coochie
Creamy like butter, better ask my groupies
Why you over there by yourself
What you got there below your belt
Even though I got an ass like a shelf
Listen baby doll I'm gonna need some help
You know we don't care, you just a true player
Move on over my underwear, when you're down don't come up for air
Wet, wet, get the steam
On your knees boy, better bow to the queen
You can take one for your team
Eat some cookies, lick the cream, uh

Uh, uh, my coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo

Touch it, touch it, cause I'm nice
Coochie, coochie goes all night
Got it goin' on, better step to me right
Coo-coo always knows what you like
Touch it, touch it, make it hot
Better promise me that you ain't never gonna stop
Ride on elevators, ride to the tops
We like chickens, we like cocks

My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo

I said, I said, my coochie, my coochie
My coochie, my coochie, my coochie, my coochie
My coochie, my coochie, uh, uh

My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo
My coochie, coochie, coochie, coo

I said, I said, my coochie, my coochie
My coochie, my coochie, my coochie, my coochie
I said, I said, my coochie, my coochie
My coochie, my coochie, my coochie, my coochie
That's what I said</pre>
