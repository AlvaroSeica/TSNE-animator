(Well this is it Mega Ran, good luck)
What is this? (and Godspeed... take him down)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come bring it, what, yeah

[Random]
I charge up my cannon cause I know it's 'bout to go down
Top floor, last level, it's the final showdown
And I ain't leavin 'til I find Doc Wily
Step in the chamber the door closes right behind me
And Wily says "I knew you would come~!
But now you're trapped there's nowhere to run"
I knew it was my last stand, the last chance
My prime directive was to stop Wily's plans
He sat inside a bubble, holdin a controller
The controller controller a robot he called Sophie
I got a message on my transmitter
It's Dr. Light: 'Don't bother with the cannon' Why? 'You can't hit her'
The weak points? 'Right above where the eyes are'
I took a hit, lost half my lifebar
I can't afford to take another one
Switched to the heatray since I'ma need another gun
I closed one eye, then I aimed steady
Got one shot left 'Are you ready?' Yeah I'm ready
I squeezed one (PYOOM) missed by a millimeter
No ammo left, how am I supposed to beat her?
Now Wily is lickin his chops, he says
"Game over Mega Ran, this is where it all stops!"
I'm trapped in the corner, he fires from his beam
Nowhere to go, nothin to do but AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH~!

(Dude Ran wake up!!)
Yo how long was I out man?
(Dude you were only out for like two minutes but you were snoring loud as hell)
Really? Heh, psch stop lying, I don't snore
Yo it was this crazy dream man
I was jumpin over spiked pits and stuff man
Had to shoot all these robots and stuff
Yo I had this big gun on my arm yo, it was crazy
It was like that, that game I used to play man
I forget what it's called though man
(Bro, I seriously have no idea what you're talking about)
The blue dude! You know the little blue...
Eh, nevermind man, I'm leaving

You know, although it was a dream
I learned a valuable lesson man
I just... don't remember what it was
But anyway, got some credits to read off to y'all 'fore I go
