[Verse One] [Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Chorus]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse Two] [Von Pea]
It's been a couple weeks
Out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge
It's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some
I have desired some
But that time is done
And that's why I'm good
Give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one, at least she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I made literal
Her girl made it figurative, but baby that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical
Maybe if we spend a few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road isn't typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures
This broad, took a good game with her
Fella couldn't Roc, I wanted Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin'
I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch
Holla at me

[Chorus]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse Three] [Phonte]
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from "Don't you have a man?" "Well..."
It all blowed over like Manuel
Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill
Man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, "That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot
So ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for

[Chorus]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse Four] [Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like I ain't getting service in your area
You be like Nigga get your bars up
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)

[Chorus]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around</pre>
