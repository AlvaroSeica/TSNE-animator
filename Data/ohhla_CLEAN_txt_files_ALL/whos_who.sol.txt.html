[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yo, uh, you already know
That's right, you know already, you hear me? (go 'head Childs)
You hear me? Is my mic loud enough (that's right)
I'm talking to you muthafucka, you hear me?
Get 'em, fucker...

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
You ain't that swoll, muthafucka
And anyway, the nine shells'll deflate you
Besides, you know who to front on
You know who the fuck's who

[Solomon Childs]
When I was young they used to call me Toucan
I smell war, nigga, these cowards gon' have me force the hand
This is real hip hop, shoot up your MTV Making the Band
My steelo a hundred grand, dealing with pot niggas
Call me the baker's man, bomb in the crack of my ass
Lick rounds like the Taliban, move on the marked vans
Thought you reigned forever, I spoiled your plans
You ain't hard muthafucka, I leave you where you stand, Gatling Island
Slaughterhouses, been bout it, been getting CREAM, you bitches
I had the slugs hit you off your crutches
The J.O.'s exclusive white and mustard
The flow'll leave you flustered, gargling your lungs
And staple a ransom note, to your little boy's tongue
Broadway and Henderson, landmark, Childs
Already a landmark, I let him fly in broad daylight
As well as the dark...

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Don't step too close to me, cuz I ain't playing
Don't act like you can't catch one in your ribs, cuz I ain't playing
Don't act like I won't pop you and your baby mother, at the movies, I
ain't playing
Don't act like the shit is a game, nigga, I ain't playing, playing, fucker...
Nigga, I got this nigga, turn my fucking back, muthafucka
B-Town, nigga, Slaughterhouses, Killa Mob
