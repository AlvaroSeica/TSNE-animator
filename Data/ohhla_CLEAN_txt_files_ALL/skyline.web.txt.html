Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Yeah
Webby
Shit, I've been at the bottom for a while, you know?
I know that, but uh
Shit, we in the skyline now baby, heh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been stuck on the ground but now it's my time
Time to take flight, right in to the skyline
Off to beautiful women sippin' on fine wine
Up at the stadium where the lights lime, and I'm
Movin' way past sound check
Still lookin' for a life that I ain't found yet
Round trip on a magical school bus
Before we touch down, shit they already knew us
Made it from the bottom to professionally rappin'
While they were tellin' me that it was never gonna happen
Now it's funny to see the haters' reactions
'Cause they ain't saying a word: Charlie Chaplin
I'm back in this bitch relaxin'
Put in the groundwork now it's time to cash in
Heh, and everybody knows I earned that
Headed to the skyline, feet up, first class
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
If it ain't given to me then I'm a take it
So let me just
Fly fly, fly fly
Cause they tellin' me it's my time
Fly fly, fly fly
And disappear into the skyline

[Verse 2]
Spit the toughest shit, who touchin' this?
Always chillin' with a bird: Snuffaluffagus
And I'm lovin' it
No Mickey D's
Just Colt 45 and some piffy trees, jeez
Got my boarding pass ready
I'm heading to the top, they ain't getting past Webby
Yeah, been on the grind since 8th grade
Went from getting no girls to banging Playmates
Heh, what up Ms. November?
My flight's taking off, got my shit together
Ready for whatever, do it better than before
I'm the reason my competitors are headin' for the door
'Cause I'm deadly and I'm raw
With the mic tonight
Got the cameras all flashin' like a lightning strike
Heh, I'm on another altitude
And they ain't ready for the shit that I'm about to do

[Chorus]
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
If it ain't given to me then I'm a take it
So let me just
Fly fly, fly fly
Cause they tellin' me it's my time
Fly fly, fly fly
And disappear into the skyline

[Verse 3]
If you got a dream you should follow it
'Cause not everybody's capable of keeping straight A's for a scholarship
As a kid no one could figure me out
So I would like to thank Hofstra for kicking me out
And look at me now, I'm doing pretty well for my age
Considering two years ago I was making minimum wage
Heh, and now we doing OK
Skyline-flow, up, up and away
Heh, and I ain't looking for a handout
Shit I got the fans now, motherfuckers stand down
Live my life to a whole new beat
Finally standing on my own two feet
'Cause it got that tough
Been kicked while I was down
But I never gave in, and I got back up
Yup, getting close, well I better be
But all I see is the skyline ahead of me

[Chorus]
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
If it ain't given to me then I'm a take it
So let me just
Fly fly, fly fly
Cause they tellin' me it's my time
Fly fly, fly fly
And disappear into the skyline</pre>
