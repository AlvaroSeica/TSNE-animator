Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
The hand is a powerful power tool
Use it for good or use it to act a fool
I know so many things you're thinkin of
I don't mean to bring it up, put yo middle fingers up like

[Chorus]
If your finger's down put it high
Put yo middle fingers in the sky
This one is a doozy, yo hoe a cheater
If they don't recognize, give em the finger
Give em the finger!
Anybody say fuck me? Everybody say fuck you!

[Verse 1]
Slippery slick, swim around ya, swim around ya
We begin a long day, I've been around ya
Finally grippin me, it was involve the enemy in the street enemy
That show reciprocally just a part
Pretend to be into my symphony
K, let's get it off
If the shoe fits, slip it off
Cry me a river, a water crush lullaby
Play the right, a finger's be wonderin what I be trippin on
I think for the night with a knife
I'm cutting you when will I get to know, okay?

[Interlude]
Hey hey hey Johnny what do you think you're doin?
You listened to my demo yet?
John John John, I'm listening to it right now
You're listening to it right now huh?
My name's not Johnny!

[Bridge]
Yea, Kali baby, look I try to live
Round the world with Tech and me, man we rock the chair
So tend to yo go nowhere's
Oh oh there's a middle finger, put it in the air nigga

[Chorus]
If your finger's down put it high
Put yo middle fingers in the sky
This one is a doozy, yo hoe a cheater
If they don't recognize, give em the finger
Give em the finger!
Anybody say fuck me? Everybody say fuck you!

[Verse 2]
5 minutes late to the slave ship
Your 20, my 20, different boy same shit
You came hearin through yo earlobes
Replayin the dreams and cock it back and reload
No excuses for the bullshit, you done lost it
Hair falling off and he caused it
You go with that devil down in fever
Frown when he come around
Click click pop is the sound
Listen!

[Interlude]
Okay, yo boss ride my ass, he gon die today
Damn it Dali get back to work
Now tell me
I'm in my element, I'm in my element
You know what? I'm a get, man
You know? You know what? Have a nice day man

[Verse 3]
Take a stand, got yo hand on yo tool
No more talkin random and you gon do the fool
Walkin into yo boss's office, your offense is to off him
But you don't want those problems nigga
Give him the finger

[Chorus]
If your finger's down put it high
Put yo middle fingers in the sky
This one is a doozy, yo hoe a cheater
If they don't recognize, give em the finger
Give em the finger!
Anybody say fuck me? Everybody say fuck you!</pre>
