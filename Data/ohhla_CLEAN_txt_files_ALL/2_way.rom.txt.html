[unknown speaker]
Right about now, you are about to witness this
The sounds of Lil' Romeo, the New No Limit, and Presidential campaign

[Lil' Romeo] 2 Way me

"Hit it!"

[Chorus]
(Romeo, Romeo!) "It takes two to make a thing go right"
(Romeo, oh Romeo!) "It takes two to make it out of sight"
(Romeo, Romeo!) "It takes two to make a thing go right"
(Romeo, oh Romeo!) "It takes two to make it out of sight"

[Lil' Romeo]
I wanna rock right now
I'm Lil' Rome and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
but I'm known to rock the microphone
Call me a pretty boy, crown me the greatest
The New No Limit, y'all cant fade us
You know I'm a winner, sho' not a loser
P. Miller clothes is what I choose yea
Ladies love me, girls adore me; I mean
Even the ones that never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, whodi I don't know; okay, yea

[Chorus]

[Lil' Romeo]
Game time hair done up, hang time
The tank shine, 2 Way on the waist line
Young hero, dress and neck below zero
I'm the best that came in the game, ask Cleo
Holla back young'n (Ooh ooh!) pop ya colla
Call me Richie Rich, I got a dog named Dollar
Custom paint, 20's on my ride
But I keep it locked down cause I'm too young to drive
I got bank rolls or pesos
So my love dont cost a thing like J-Lo
I'm a baller ma I dont play wit play-doh
You seen Cribs - so that's how we roll

[Chorus]

[Master P]
You got a mill'?  Give it to the haters
Y'all get fame, we get paper
Rome be Kobe, I'll be Shaq
Come back and went double platinum back to back
Grown folks watchin, girls be jockin
Oooohweee! The Tank ain't stoppin

[Silkk the Shocker]
Come off the bench and win it, that's just in me
Drop the top, nothin less than a Bentley
Y'all twistin the game, we be burstin back
P, Rome, and Silkk - now how ya luv that?

[Chorus]

[Lil' Romeo]
Okay - six flags, I got the dolo
We rock platinum Tanks, that be the logo
Y'know ya club'll bounce to this
I'm 12 years old with 21 karats around the wrist
So, whassup doc?  The party don't stop
These No Limit boys gon' to drop it like it's hot

[Chorus] - [Bridge] overlaps

[Bridge]
Where dem girls at?  Where dem boys at?
Throw 'em up, put 'em up, get 'em up!
Where dem girls at?  Where dem boys at?
Throw 'em up, put 'em up, get 'em up!

[Chorus] - repeat to fade w/ variations and [Bridge] mixed in</pre>
