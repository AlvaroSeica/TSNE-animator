G'eah, I know where them niggaz out
Ain't tripping on no beef nigga, this what we do nigga
Hurt em yeah, g'eah g'eah

[Hook - 2x]
When you see us, you gon know that we the truth
Don't be hanging out the window, with them choppers on the roof
We ain't playing hoe (uh-uh), we ain't playing hoe (uh-uh)
Lights out tip-toeing, straight spraying hoe

[Big Tuck]
We ain't playing with you hoes, not at all
Got the AR, ripping through the brick wall
I'ma let it rip, till the whole house fall
Got the red beam, on your whole team dog
Them the same niggaz, tried to run up in my trap
First nigga through the do', I put the beam on his cap
His niggaz flipped out, they done tipped A.S.A.P.
Say bitch I'm a rider, and you know I stay strapped
I been looking for these boys, for a week
Sun up sun down, no sleep
When I seem em, I'ma let em have the heat
Hope them hoes hungry, cause they just found beef
I'm fin's to find, where these mo'fuckers chill
Then I'ma let em, know what the deal is
In the car six deep, loading up steel
Bout to let them boys know, that we for real

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
We be dipping round the corner, with them chops
I'm bandana'd up, bout to take on the block
I don't give a damn, bout no motherfucking cops
They strapped we strapped, fuck nigga let's rock
Now they see that the click, off the chain
Cause we hanging out the window, with them thangs in they aim
Let it rain, god damn it let it rain
When I leave this bitch, I'ma leave the strip flame
Niggaz get to capping, like they vets
We done walked up on they set, they ain't showed us shit yet
When we bust, ery'body scit-scat
Matter fact, where all the gorillas at
Yes sir, it's the Hurricane Tuck
Nigga got some'ing, that'll disappear a bus
Y'all run (y'all run), we rush (we rush)
Y'all talk (y'all talk), we bust (we bust)

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
There they go, there they go
Stop the car, I'm bout to walk up to the do'
There they go, there they go
Stop the car, I'm bout to walk up to the do'
Bring your A-game, bring your A-game
Got them killers outside, with them thangs
Bring your A-game, bring your A-game
Got them killers outside, with them thangs

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
I'ma just let you, know the truth nigga - 2x
And that's what that is</pre>
