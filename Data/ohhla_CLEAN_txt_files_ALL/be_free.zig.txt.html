Song:   Be Free
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The system's got too much control, and they don't wanna let it go
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, I'm breaking out of captivity

Be free, be free
To be free

Little by little, I'm losing control
As little by little my rights erode
I stop the deputy, now you know
Mama don't try, you see I got to go

[Chorus]

The government's got too much control
Now is there some place that we can roll
the politics of fear and oppression is everywhere now
the law is closing in, just take what you can bring

[Chorus]

The system's got too much control
now is there some place that we can roll
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, the law is closing in
just take what we can bring</pre>
