[Intro: Masta Killa]
*Sniffin' Weed*
Uh, Ya'll niggaz should have some of this shit right here boy
It's that good shit
Uh, it's justÂ…One-Two, One-Two, Replace the beat

**Heavily Coughs**

Aiyo, **Coughs Again**

Aiyo, checka, checka, **Coughs Again** check it out
Uh, Motha'fuckin'

[Verse 1]
I was feelin' lovely, pocket full of Dough
I lil drunk, Reaction madd slow
Thinkin' - Should I step to the Motherland ?
And rep who ? The Wu-Tang Fam
Another thang - Beyond the fam I wanted to get repped
Put my lips on the Blunt tip
It's been Two Weeks since our last Squad stepped in the Grand Resort
$25 Dollar fee, plus I.D.
But a brotha like me Executive V.I.P.
Word!, she took a bar seat, had a tall glass of Hennessey and Peach
Turned to my left she stood wit chick she was slammin'
What you do Kid ? I examined her
Pushed up, tried to bag her for her name
What Happened ? I didn't have *?*
Overwhelmed by the Scent in the Air
Could it be ? Yes, Yea, Ha Ha
It was start tell The God Jamel, he had a bone
A Blunt and that end shit
I said "Pass the Bone, Pass the Bone"
-&gt; "Pass the Bone Kid, Pass the Bone"
He passed it, took one pour, I was blasted
Felt kinda Stimulated - FANTASTIC!
We approached the weak Cipher
Did you surprised her ? Tranquilized her
Bagged her, for her name and Address
Slit to the rest, Achieved Madd Success
Ha ha, yea

[Hook:]
We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through Town like Stars
Buy your Broads, Hottest Gods

We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through Town like Stars
Hottest Bars, Fuck you far

[Verse 2]
I shot a Night Club, shorty lookin' wit the Mean Mug
Ain't showin' no love, It's all good
I'm ready to float inside and rip the Mic from
Hmmm, All I needed was a Hydro bone
Guess who came down the Block Stumblin' Drunk ?
I forget the Brotha name but he had some stung
Check out the Blunt, put the Weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was Applied
Inhale *(Inhales)* without potent corpse
Exhale *(Exhales)* you know like 2 pools and off
Stimulated kinda Toxic, but don't sleep
You know we got the drop, one shot wit the Heat
Some Brothas be smokin' that Weed of The Week
But neva me, just stick wit the Ganja
Since remain ya, in ya area

[Hook:]
We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through Town like Stars
Buy you Broads, Hottest Gods

We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through Town like Stars
Hottest Bars, Fuck you far</pre>
