Song:   Calm Before the Storm (Remix)
Typed by: Quest Rah

Gotta find my mind in honor so it don't go missing
cross the border new world order fallen souls rinsing
Born wit the storm torn but I'm feelin' bliss in
Wilderness where minds peace ain't miss to reminisce
March forward blow a kiss I raise a fist like Tommy Smith
Use the gift you cant take my riches like you an evangelist
A board of panelist cant judge I flee and duck
Construct a beautiful conduct mics get touched
Harsh like the gobi desert
Pleasant when I clutch
Hold jewels, precious stones, gold, rubies and such
Big city being fleein like the sight of fleets of Europeans
Descendant seethin'
Revenge breathin'
impossibly concealin
We reel it on tape
21st century now cant escape
Wikileak upon a rap beat
evidence
wisdom of the most high
Use for tools their own inventions
Upload the vid to youtube
HD recording
Storming ya airwaves with lyrical warring
Calm before the stormin</pre>
