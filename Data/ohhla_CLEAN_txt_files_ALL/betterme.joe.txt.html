[Intro: Joe Budden]
Uhh - I hear what niggaz sayin
Niggaz gon' talk to me like
Like when I come on the plane and shit, Louie's on
When I sit out in the front of the muh'fuckin plane with the Daily News
With my legs crossed and shit
Wanna act like I ain't earn my seat
When I'm watchin muh'fuckers walk to the back and shit, when it's coach
You Pat Riley in that shit nigga

[Joe Budden]
Look here, look, look; I get a ghetto gospel
Only right considerin the ghetto was my hostel
Memory is gone but I'm recallin all through high school
Even at my lowest, I was sittin on my high stool
That's what bein high do
If I couldn't do shit, was always able to toke
They told me that a nigga'd die 'fore I was able to vote
Probably cause me and my constituents, and all the shit we did
The MRI couldn't tell you what the issue is
With my treason, came a cause that I believed in
Is it really wrong if a nigga got a reason?
At times I had to take dough, nigga did whatever for a peso
Bein from the hood'll be my scapegoat
Or can it be, cause I wasn't born into a canopy
Maybe I was prone to fallin in love with vanity
Tell me shit you reap is the shit you sow
Tell God I'm better than the shit I show, I gotta grow, c'mon

[sample and instrumental break]

[Joe Budden]
Whoa...
I hope niggaz see that, l-look

Now niggaz say I floss too much  so, has he changed?
Cause I don't think that thousand-dollar tee cost too much
All they should say is that he's strong
Came out the fire unscathed, yeah I carried on
Lou' Vuitton carry-on
Had they Mattie on, with my blessings at a delay
Now to lace my chick in {?} is sorta cliché
Plane ain't gon' ever land, 'less it's in the Netherlands
Twenty on that gold face, Breitling with the leather band
Ask for a better hand
I tried collidin with my problems, yeah I never ran
That'll make me less a man
I ain't go from not, havin it to bein arrogant
I dreamt, went grabbin it, just bein passionate
Some niggaz get complaints and why
Dudes is newborn birds, just afraid to fly
But if your foot's on the breaks, can't ride (me)
Me, I spread my wings, inhale and embrace that high

[sample and instrumental break]

[Joe Budden]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now {*3X*}
L-look, l-look, look

Part of me was gruesome, I ain't changed, I grew some
And if I did change, I welcomed that shit to come
Dudes that smoked trees with me, dudes that used to be with me
They say I switched up on 'em and did a three-sixty
Cause I don't burn it down
But to me it's common sense, you wan' see the other side gotta turn around
Show 'em your game face
I tell 'em we was on the same track but wasn't runnin that same race (nigga)
Weighin in the same space (but) but I ain't gon' change pace
Somethin won't let me slow down, I can't explain fate
So don't say I went from broke to bougie
I'm far from high-end, I just know what suits me, muh'fucker
