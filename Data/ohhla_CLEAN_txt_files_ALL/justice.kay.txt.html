[Intro: Sheek Louch]
YEAH!!! KAY SLAY!!!!

[Chorus: Raheem Devaughn]
'Round here we live for it and die for it
It's the code of the streets it's the law
You can get it with one phone call
Disrespect me and my niggas goin off for the
(JUSTICE!!!) Got goons!!! And got soldiers!!!!
Every city, every slum, and every borough!!!!
So don't get fly, don't get fresh, don't get dumb
Make me serve you some, some JUSTICE!!!

[Verse One: Sheek Louch]
Flyin down the highway, no tints, look at the G
Seat back, CD player, Teena Marie
It's Donnie, rolex with no diamonds on the face
Louie sneakers, True Religion's hammers on the waist
Shades on the face, drippin like I just got out the tub
Five or six bottles in the club
Weed in the jar, it's evident you lookin at a star
Tonight I'm tryin to fuck a muma (VADO!!!)
Razor in the mouth (WHATTUP) It's alot of hot music in the street
Never thought we get it back from the south (THANK YOU!!!)
I popped the Rozay, chicks think she's Nicki Minaj
I ain't Drake but I'm down to roleplay (IT'S OK!!!)
If  I ain't gettin money then I'm grumpy
I'm sittin in the front, I ain't noticed since the flight was too bumpy
I'm poppin these niggas on site, I'll leave you in the car
Engine still runnin in the light....YEAH!!!!

[Chorus: Raheem Devaughn]
'Round here we live for it and die for it
It's the code of the streets it's the law
You can get it with one phone call
Disrespect me and my niggas goin off for the (JUSTICE!!!) 

[Verse Two: Tony Yayo]
In the Benz watch the lighter flicker
I'm a burn somethin else for my real niggas
Re-up on the work let the fiends test the grams
'Cause Uptown niggas'll hit you with flim flam
Have that lawyer money, before the shit splatter
Or Jewelry, a body of purses, diverted matters
Phantom ghost, I'll show your lady love
Burnin O.G. kush 'til the lady buzzed
Wake up put my feet on Persian rugs
Redhead from the red lights she rode a bud
Uh! This money comin like a silk purse
Sour eatin small plants in the early season
Call the shooters up, they grab the calibers
The four hit, they trip off the salvia
I got money in these streets fuck gettin pitched
Plus BM's just came out with the new six

[Chorus: Raheem Devaughn]
'Round here we live for it and die for it
It's the code of the streets it's the law
You can get it with one phone call
Disrespect me and my niggas goin off for the (JUSTICE!!!) 

[Verse Three: Styles P]
Sicker than Son of Satan but God like
Told you 'til the day I die nigga this is mob life (D-BLOCK!!!)
I talk with my hands over my mouth, casino style
Middle of broad day homey, pull the nina out (BROAD DAY!!)
And if I blow the hollow, you see no tomorrow
Twistin your cap off nigga top of the soda bottle (TOP OF THE SODA BOTTLE!!!)
All these rappers is hilarious
Pop 'em in they car I ride up with God's chariot (RIDE!!!)
Plenty of money and guns fuck it I carry it!!! (I CARRY IT!!!)
Hang all of these niggas and use my lariat (USE MINE!!!)
Never the type to sweat another nigga's swag (NEVER!!!)
But I pull the beretta and take another nigga bag
Dope boy, jack boy, I ain't just rappin
It's another fuckin fact boy! And you fiction!
You remind me of a book I wrote
Play tough I got the hawk and beat a crook I poked, whattup!!!

[Chorus: Raheem Devaughn]
'Round here we live for it and die for it
It's the code of the streets it's the law
You can get it with one phone call
Disrespect me and my niggas goin off for the (JUSTICE!!!) 

[Verse Four: Lloyd Banks]
Mind sprints to the money dog my brain racin
Chain chasin, millions out of the same basement
The pain is pressure, got to learn to remain patient
And break you out of just settlin for the same faces
I'm calm and crazy with my strange caters
Crack your bank try to follow me the same payments
Whoever switchin up, my weed change fragrance
Like the press consequences that the fame gave us
I want it all just like the next man
Stunner, bitches lookin at me like a stretched Lamb
The world gettin palmed in my brigette hand
Everything you hear is the bomb show me respect fam
The rest ran, remember me as an artist
Mentally I'm a mutant, gettin to it regardless
Everything fucked up put issues to the garbage
Alot of shit, politics, movin the targets

[Chorus: Raheem Devaughn]
'Round here we live for it and die for it
It's the code of the streets it's the law
You can get it with one phone call
Disrespect me and my niggas goin off for the (JUSTICE!!!) 
Got goons!!! And got soldiers!!!!
Every city, every slum, and every borough!!!!
So don't get fly, don't get fresh, don't get dumb
Make me serve you some, some JUSTICE!!!

[Outro: Raheem Devaughn]
SOME JUSTICE!!! SOME JUSTICE!!!</pre>
