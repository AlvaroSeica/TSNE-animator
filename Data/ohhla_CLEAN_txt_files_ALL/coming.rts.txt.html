[Mercedez Martinez]
I hear somebody screaming
again, bracing for the fall
Close my eyes, but I never wonder
..I have seen it all

They won't remember
Was it coming? Was it going?
Were they running from the sun?
Racing through the morning

I'm coming
Ain't no chance my footsteps were on the road
No one sees and no one knows
I'm coming, I'm cominnnnnng... (I'm coming, I'm coming)

I hear somebody screaming
again, bracing for the fall
I close my eyes, but I never wonder
..I have seen it all</pre>
