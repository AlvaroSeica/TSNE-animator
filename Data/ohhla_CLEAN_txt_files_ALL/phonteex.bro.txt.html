[Intro]
What have we got, what have we got, okay alright
Phonte. Little Brother
North Carolina. It's Comeback. It's official.

[Phonte talking]
Yeah yeah yeah, it's your boy Tiggalonious
Phonte, Little Brother. Holdin' it down for the Justus League
NC style. On some freestyle
Y'all know how we do. Throwbacks the mixtape. Some exclusive shit
Y'all bump it one time, check it out

Some niggas get in the game to bang bitches
I get in the game to make bitches bang my name
Like "Dang, that nigga came with it."
With no half ass rhymes or strange business aside
It's Phonte
The prosecution main witness
In a trail of Hip Hop Vs. Something Else
Cause a lot of y'all niggas is doin' somethin' else
Showin' off in your videos and frontin' wealth
Album never ever should have came off the fuckin' shelf
Phonte rhyme so hard
Spit crowbars
A get perfect 10's on all his scorecards
Mixtape classics when my joints on it
Wanna wild out but my license to ill got to many points on it
I'll tell you right now, you motherfuckers don't want it
I'm spittin' this for the smorgasboard of whores galore
Pumpin' Little Brother at the corner stores
In Baby Phat and Sean John valor

[Chorus]
We keep hittin' y'all with new shit
It's Phonte, DJ exclusive
Bring it back and that's how we do this
Just a little somethin' y'all can act a fool with
We keep hittin' y'all with new shit
It's Phonte, DJ exclusive
Bring it back and that's how we do this
It's J. League nigga and we showin' and provin'
C'mon

[Outro]
The Justus League give ya watch ya need
Put the Jay-Z's on 'em when I hustle with speed
Yeah two, yeah nigga don't breathe
I'm fuckin' around ha. Yo, the mixtape throwbacks
DJ Exclusive, Bring It Back Entertainment. What up Bobby? 
What up nigga?</pre>
