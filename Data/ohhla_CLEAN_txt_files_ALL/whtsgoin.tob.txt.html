Welcome to the world of a kid named Mikey
Who had only one reason to be hated by whitey
Raised on a farm outside of South Bend
Where they hated on him cause he was African American
But three years later, Mikey was the town pride
Basketball Mikey went and got himself a full ride
Earned his acceptance on the hardwood floor
And that's something white America would never ignore

Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down

What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down
I wanna know just what's goin' down
What's goin' down I'll tell ya what's goin' down
You wanna know just what's goin' down
Take a look around
Everything is comin' down
Do you hear the subtle sounds
Of our morality slippin'
People on the go
We'll be reapin' what we sow
Yeah we say we want to know
But I got my suspicions

Welcome to the world of a girl named Susie
Susie's only crime was that she was born a cutie
Physically abused by her uncle and his friends
Alcohol let 'em all leave the house with grins
But Susie couldn't shake off the memories
Forced to find her own kind of remedy
A man-eater for the rest of her days
Three kids, three men, no daddies by eleventh grade

What be goin' diggy down
When you find what you lost
But you lose what you found</pre>
