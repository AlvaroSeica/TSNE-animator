[Verse 1]
Everybody know a crab, they're the type to climb on other crabs 
when they find there's something that they gotta have
Any means justify any ends
A storm in any port whether enemy or a friend?
A hen in a wolves cloak, legend with a remote
The manifestation of a lemming is often a bloke
A lot of big notes might swing a lot of votes
With the same principle as the war of the worlds hokes
They're as common as canetoads in Queensland 
You know that I play fair
Keep these hand where you can see man
I'm gettin' sick of the He-man, the thuggery
You need to be cut right back down like shrubbery
Don't call it conscience, call it a recovery
The spoilt kids that produced it I'm taking custody
Lost and found and found and lost
That you wear around your neck like an albatross

[Chorus]
Because what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
And what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
They'll be a riot in the streets of Sydney tonight

[Verse 2]
How can you allow it, not wanna know facts or
anything about it, keep your head cowered
By the week, month and year the days counted
Relying on a betrayal of how we were founded
Now there's no other way around it
They're coming to roost, I wonder if you'll reach a moment of truth?
The things going on under Guantanamo's roof
Even conservative christian groups ask for proof
I know you never said we're not autonomous yet
But yet the blatant neglect mean it don't need to be said 
check your fuckin' concept of self respect
Don't get it twisted, history beckoned and you missed it
The menace is distant but no less real
On our streets like the opium of Afghan fields
The only honourable ones are the ones that squeal
How's that for an inditement but that's the deal!

[Chorus]
Because what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
And what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
They'll be a riot in the streets of Sydney tonight

[Verse 3]
I call bullshit on think tanks
Bandy to whatever conservative think tanks
Laugh long and hard like big banks
Son it's just business, don't you force that upon the listeners
'Cause the risk is that you devide your market
Some of your consumers might feel that they're your target
What you got is small and this might halve it
C'est la vie cos that's the way it's gonna be
I call bullshit on think tanks
Bandy to whatever conservative think tanks
Laugh long and hard like big banks
Son it's just business, don't you force that upon the listeners
Cos the risk is that you divide your market
Some of your consumers might feel that they're your target
Don't you understand what your doing, this will halve it 
C'est la vie cos that's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus]
Because what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
And what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
They'll be a riot in the streets of Sydney tonight
Because what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
And what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
They'll be a riot in the streets of Baghdad tonight

Dedicated to David Hicks and his dad Terry
Illegally incarcerating and torturing one of our own citizens
without charge nor trial is not brave
Mearly flying a flag... and saying "Mission Accomplished"
is not brave
Abandoning our own is not brave
It's not brave</pre>
