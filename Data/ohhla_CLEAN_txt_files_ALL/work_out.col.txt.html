[Intro - Sample from "The New Workout Plan" by Kanye West]
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

[Break - J. Cole] - w/ sample and ad libs in the background throughout
Hey we got a good thing, don't know if I'm a see you again
But is that a good thing? 'Cause girl, I can't be your man (no ma'am)
I know what's on your brain, you probably hope it never would end
Like is it the real thing or is it just a one night stand? (well then)

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Let me see ya get, high, now go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far will ya go?
I wanna see ya (work out for me, work out for me)

High, now go low
Now girl won't ya drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far will ya go?
I wanna see ya (work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
She like them boys with the big old chains
Ride around town in a big old Range
I knew her when I rocked big old chains
Now the little nigga doin big old things
Would you look at that, I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like ya asked for
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
It rebounds, so I caught her off the backboard
I told her "baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair
But, so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can't buy ya love 'cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink (uh), just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night"

[Break]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Carolina blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block, damn, girl ya mean
They be startin shit but it's your world
On my Martin shit - "you go, girl"
She bad and she know it
Some niggaz save hoes, I'm not that heroic
Could you be my Escort? 'Cause just like them two-door Fords
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more
Huh, Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool, me, I'm on fire
Know what's on my mind, tryin to see what's on yours
Tonight (uh), tonight (uh), tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late, so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass
Get right (uh), get right

[Break]

[Outro - J. Cole - to the tune of Paula Abdul's "Straight Up"] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (oh, oh, oh)
Or is it just a hit and run?

Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut, when we together (oh, oh, oh)
Come here girl, let's get it on

(Work out for me, work out for me)</pre>
