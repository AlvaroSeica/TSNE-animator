You make a song dissing me becuase I'm Pastor Troy
Do You Think I should Get'EM, well uh-huh

Ok, ok ok ok
You make a song dissing me because I Pastor Troy
Wanna act like you don't even know your boy
All that screamin' and hollain'tryin to crank up the club
Reppin' Zone 3 nigga they ain't showing no love
The best thang Oomp could do was drop you
What make it so funny Universal is too
While you with yo booze snottin' up an ounce
I'm droppin 6 figures the owner of da Bounce
This nigga actin' like he's boss, this nigga actin' like he's sold
Sam, time to hang it up Hitman you're getting old
And I ain't talking about your lyrics I'm talking bout your age
15 years in da game and still ain't got paid
And then you want to throw your Big Oomp chain like a ass
Because Baby D da Oomp getting to da cash
You lame boy, its P. Troy
From ATL to AUG, Ya niggas ain't seeing me
I'm telling ya

(chorus)

Reppin' Zone 3 nigga, I throw it up (I throw it up)
Catch you off of Pittsburgh, and blow you up (blow you up)
But what I really hate (hate) is how you losing weight (losing wight)
Time to hang it up Sam, give it a break
I got da homeboy say he'll rock wit ya
How you expect me to split a block with ya
Sam, stepdaddy can't save you from this
Next time you be careful who you diss
Who is This?  Basing for holding up Zone 3
Long gold tee ah looking just like me
If I...was old, if I...was broke, if I...got pleasure in smoking dope
That's why Kilo kick yo ass at da Nine
Fuckin' wit me goin' get it kick one more time
Talkin' bout where my throwback boys
Mann them niggas goin' roll wit P.Troy

(chorus)

Talking to end</pre>
