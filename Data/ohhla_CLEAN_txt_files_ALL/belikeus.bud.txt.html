[Intro: Buddha Monk]
So stink on it
Welcome to the world of the real Zu hip hop
And where all that other bullshit gets put the side, nigga
We want you to sit back, enjoy the show
And then walk on this, next up to give you just what you need

[Chorus 2X: Buddha Monk]
Ya'll niggas wanna be like us
Ya'll niggas wanna be like us
Then don't stop, get it, get it
It's impossible to be like us
Cuz if you was us, you might turn around
Catch two of those, to the gut

[Buddha Monk]
I can't understand why you trying to cop grams
When in the first place you getting beat by your mans
And you're not even gun ho, not even drug known
Open up the door, nigga, and you will get blown
You're fronting and you trying to impress your friends, your life now ends
How they knew, you copped that Benz?
Pop the Crystal, Moet, Thug when you Passion
Drunk when you drunk, dead when they blasting
But if you was us, you wouldn't be dead on the floor
You'd be up on some corner looking for 'exit' on the wall
And I don't run out backdoors, I clap out backdoors
Chill up with your whore, laying with no more
It's a must that I bust, any nigga that want it with me
I was raised by my Crown Heights family
So those who still up, buckle up, knuckle up
Then there might be a chance that you can be like us

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
You probably wondering, how I became this ruthless bastard
It started when pops left, when the doctor whooped my ass, kid
It's a hard knock life, pop left, pop right
You know what this is, lay down, clinch ice
It's not a game, I came to take, fuck fame
I leave it for them cats that need to make a name
It's the best kept secret, it's kept when you delete it
Leave no witnesses, you get no six years
Stop dumbing, my dumb dumbs love to hot something
Blaow, blaow, blaow, clack, clack, clack, you don't want none of that
You want to be like us, then your gun splatter bust
Ashes to ashes and fuck a nigga's trust

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Buddha Monk]
There you have it, muthafuckas
Another day of sadistic bullshit
Going down under the hood
This is Row Daddy Row, I'm a realer station
That ya'll muthafuckas ain't tuned into then
But until then, Daddy Warbucks keep banging
Ya'll listen, shit is real
And we out, hahaha</pre>
