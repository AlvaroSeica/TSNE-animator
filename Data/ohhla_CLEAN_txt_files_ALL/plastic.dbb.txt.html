This goes out (no money no love) 
to the whole world. (no money no la-la-love) 
See ya got to maintain (no money no love) 
and hold it down one time. (no money no la-la-love). 
I said this goes out (no money no love) 
to the whole world. (no money no la-la-love) 
Man you got to maintain (no money no love) 
and hold it down one time. (no money no la-la-love). 
(Yo bout to throw this out, how it go?) 

My verbal orgasms 
my rhymes masturbate the mind. 
For what it's worth let me sarinade this earth one time. 
It's like now-a-days it comes to no surprise 
why the finer things in life get glamourized. 
Chicken heads look at the world through expensive shades. 
Shit is great but at they gates they be sittin' on crates. 
Got a man named sam who love pop moet. 
Livin' in the projects he can't afford to pay his rent now. 
Plastic men I see through em like a zima. 
Roll around the club forty times in ya beamer. 
Lease by ya moms watch the don flow like water. 
Next week you scrape to buy pampers for your daughter. 
Flex the rolex. (yeah) 
Everybodys starin. 
Donna Karan ain't carin' 
watcha babies wearin'.(I swear) 
How much silver can one woman wear? 
If she really wanna shine get a grip on a career. (yeah) 
Why frontin' niggas always step on the scenes, (scenes) 
runnin to the clubs wit' your last twenty beans. (uh) 
Everones a playa I'd rather be the coach. 
It's new yorks overdose,(right, right) (yo,yo)maintain 
hold ya wallets close. 

Yo 
This goes out (no money no love) 
to the whole world. (no money no la-la-love) 
See you got to maintain (no money no love) 
now hold it down one time. (no money no la-la-love). 
I said this goes out (no money no love) 
to the whole world. (no money no la-la-love) 
Now see you got to maintain (no money no love) 
and hold it down one time. (no money no la-la-love). 
(Yo, so check it) 

Well I say 
so many things ain't right. 
And I'm mournin for me family 
as they leave this very li-i-ife 
I wanna take it from the light to 
save all the music we love so me got it in me life. 
now watch your friends say them wanna go on and fight. 
And man dey babble on since dem be thinkin they right. 
Begins once they murder murder and wan take your life 
for Versace and Mossimo and DKNY. 
But a dere money now can buy somethings(something)

Bullshit tings done gone in vein.

Hey yo I've come to the conclusion that the reason for cofusion, 
is the fact that too many folks believe in illusions 
that are projected on the screens. (screens) 
chasin pipe dreams. (yeah) 
Killin' over colors but mainly the color green. 
So I sit around and watch these fools act less than equal to 
themslves.(selfs) 
Tryin to be like everybody else. 
Duplicatin' images on TV (TV) 
tryin to be the very people that they see. 
Living their whole entire lives in 3D. 
You are who you are 
so be what you've got to be. (that's right) 
Stop the pretending like money is never ending. 
It's mind bending 
the way these kids keep spending. 
Yet have no cash to flash, no ends to spend. 
And when you do have loot 
it's probably barrowed from your friends. (tell 'em) 
You know the type because you've seen them in the past. 
Livin' life fast but it's really just gas. 

Yo 
This goes out (no money no love) 
to the whole world. (no money no la-la-love) 
See ya got to maintain (no money no love) 
and hold it down one time. (no money no la-la-love).

to the whole world. (no money no la-la-love) 
Ya see yall got to maintain (no money no love) 
and hold it down one time. (no money no la-la-love). 

It's like this goes out to all them heads that front. 
Always sayin' what they got but it's really what you want. 
Hold it down to give the things that pay that rent. 
Many people chase dollars, but we really need sense. 
It's like this goes out to all them heads that front.
