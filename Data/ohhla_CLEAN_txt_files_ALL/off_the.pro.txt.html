[Verse 1 - Promoe]
Whether outdoors or indoors, the crowd will in-doors
My show, and end yours, that's natural laws
I get crazy applause, they Buju like Banton
I chant down Babylon it's the countdown.
We're livin' in the last couple of days
That's why I never kick wack rhymes
'cause there ain't no time to waste
No time to fake, no time to chase the papes
Time to get it straight in nineteen ninety hate
That's the number and the mindstate
The only way you fuckin' with my style is if it's rape
But I got the mase and the pepper spray in my purse
After the battle one of us leavin' the hurse
I don't care if it's me but it's probably gonna be you though
But I'm chillin' like Blue Note's played on (?)
I won't get mad if you say you took out Promoe
I just relax and sit back and watch ya nose grow

"Suckas step up.."
"You wanna battle..""..don't even try it"

[Hook - Promoe]
Yo, my style is off the record
But don't turn off the record
Cause then it's off the record
How I'll off you in a second
My style is off the record
But don't turn off the record
Cause than it's off the record
Suckas!

[Verse 2 - Promoe]
If I cross you, I will diss you in a rhyme
Take it as a compliment I think you worth the ink, and the time
Who me, Promoe, with the master peal
Don't mess with me though cause I bust rhymes and piss
And fuck with dead emcees like necrophiliacs
But I can't dig 'em they actin' like maniacs
Thinkin' that the Promoe could ever get beaten
That's like a Danish guy gettin' drunk in Sweden
Not very likely cause when I step on stage
I get props from smoke spots to internet homepages
See my show as a sermon on the mouth
Givin' emcees god's word I'm what it's all about
It's about this I'm in crisp on the mic
To me all y'all other clicks sound alike
So fuck you, plus your weak producer
Don't face you, you better face Medusa
I'll turn your weak flesh into solid stone
Spprdekrizzah rock! on the microphone
And it don't stop it goes on and on
Like havin' sex with Erykah Badu till the early morn'
Check it out it don't stop
I keep on till the neighbours call the cops

[Hook - Promoe]
Cause my style's off the record
But don't turn off the record
Cause then it's off the record
How I'll off you in a second
My style's off the record
But don't turn off the record
Cause than it's off the record
Check it

"You wanna battle.."
"Suckas step up.." "..don't even try it"

[Verse 3 - Promoe]
Emcees talk a lot of shit I make 'em eat every word of it
I'm from the Looptroop crew I bet you heard of it
And still you wanna face me
Not even the man in the mirror can
Who you? A Swedish kid tryin' to be American
Couldn't take me out if I was the track
You wanna battle then you better bring some caps
Cause I'm takin' all your stash even though I'm drinkin' back
In the soundclash on yo' ass like a rash
Really rational lyrics
Spit like ammo from the lips of P-R-O-M-O
The mindstate, scientists ain't figured yet
Your stock compared to mine, is niggarettes and cigarettes
You illiterate I'm educated
The university of hip-hop you never graduated
I heard some decent emcees right from the top of they heads
But I rhyme from the bottom of my heart, 'nuff said

"Suckas step up.."
"You wanna battle..""..don't even try it"

[Hook - Promoe] (repeated til fade)
My style is off the record
But don't turn off the record
Cause then it's off the record
How I'll off you in a second</pre>
