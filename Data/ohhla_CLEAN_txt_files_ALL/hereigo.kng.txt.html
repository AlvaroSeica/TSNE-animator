Here I go here I go (let them niggaz know)
Here I go here I go (let them niggaz know)
Here I go here I go (let them niggaz know)
(the Kingz on the flo', bout to put on a show)

[Coop]
Now here I go here I go, nigga it's the Sir Coop
Swing the mic my way, cause I'm already loose
If you looking for the king, I'm in the center of the flo'
Three g's for a show, bout to let these boys know
That I ain't playing no mo', boy it's real in the field
Stay crunk in Huntsville, where I showcase my skill
When I enter your city, don't be looking at me shitty
Leave the jealousy at home, cause I shine like P. Diddy
I'm a money making man, already done made the band
And we here away from thangs, that's some shit they can't stand
Let me see you throw your hands, better yet chunk a table
Tear the roof off the building, if you willing and you able
Drop a bow throw a fist, bust a nigga like this
Keep going don't quit, till the club is over with
Then make way and watch your toes (where you aaaat) here I go
Buck wilding solo, in the middle of the flo'

[Hook]

[Chalie]
I'm small in height, but I'm swoll in weight
Leap frogging over buildings, dropping hoes that hate
I suggest you don't open the gate, if you welcome me in
Fuck destiny, I'm stealing your fate
On top I ride, and I roll nonstop
Close your eyes and feel the breeze, I hit the breaks but still chop
Boys know all aboooout
To hell with your head, I go fed with these body shots
Here I go, I picked up this Lac
If it's too slow, I picked up the track
I picked up the gat, to make haters back back and hurl up
On all it, like the Mr. Fat Pat
I'm the fat rat, with the cheeeeese
The black mack, is black dressed in Fendiiii
These haters, been waiting for me
To fall off, but just keep waiting to see, keep waiting to see

[Hook]

[Tite]
Here I go undisputed, done paid my dues
Out of line on the tracks, so I'ma break the rules
It's Chalie and Tite, Sir Coop keeping my shank
We fly as a kite, venom must be aware of the bite
I'm true with mine, spit flow pursue your mind
Trying to come up on a plack, so I pursued the grind
Icing the cake, snitches get a slice in they face
It's the code on the streets, and that's a price you pay
Tite's the realest, I come through replace your killas
Best advice to your crew, don't face this nigga
I'm off the chain a animal, a beast untamed
Unless you ready for the pain, don't speak my name
Dirty Third niggaz ain't no click, we a culture
Fuck talking out of distance my nigga, we'll approach you
Here we go, knocking cats up out they boots
Don't believe what I say, then I can show you proof

(*talking*)
Yeah uh-huh, these mo'fuckers want war huh
They don't even wanna see me, we gon bring it
To these niggaz though, bastards
Ride on these faggots, punk ass niggaz</pre>
