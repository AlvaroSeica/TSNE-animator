[Verse One]
I'm ballin'
L.A.X., J.F.K. to Heathrow
You ballin' 
Up at the park shootin' a free throw
Put bullets through your peephole for fuckin' around with my people
Send the Grim Reaper to reap, snatch your soul, call it a repo
I know 
Niggas can't fuck with me
Now you know
Niggas you can't fuck with me
I'm thorough like that Brooklyn borough
Detroit, down to Chicago, P.J.'s and down at Magnolia don't fuck around
Illa, military minded, hood militia, touch a Christian and Islamic scripture
Gangsta, gangsta with a Black Panther mixture
I'm bout to come back
This rap is pro black
The time is now, I am now, fuck holdin' back
Aftermath
Bitch don't you love it?
Brought the crown back around, motherfucker I run it
 
[Chorus]
My album's out
Rappers cryin' like little bitches
Listen to 'em they like
Oooohhh
My niggas sellin' millions makin' millions
almost diamond but you still ain't gold yet
(I know it hurts)
Hear me on the radio and see me
in every video and on all the magazines
(I bet it hurts)
Spot me in that new Bentley
the Bensey or the Rover while you still leasin' that old shit
(Oow, I know it hurts)
 I fuck 'em when I meet 'em then delete 'em
 heard you treat 'em and you still ain't fucked yet
(Oow)

[Verse Two]
I'm ambidextrous, train for the extras
Pistol in either hand, I put a hole through your headrest
The price of success
My guns in excess
For excessive force toward fuckers that's thoughtless
A shot and you're thoughtless
Bitch I won't miss
I'm too B.I.G. now, you not gon' me just like Chris
No posthumous releases
I blow frames to pieces
Your heart rate decreases
Your sleep becomes the deepest
What the fuck? Who the fuck you thought it was?
I never slip, slip in a clip and let you feel slugs
I'm just a backpacker
I'd rather break dance
But I'll break your neck, fuckin' disrespect, take a chance
I'm Russian Roulette with a bullet in every chamber
Bishop Lamont the new definition of danger
 
[Chorus]
My album's out
Rappers cryin' like little bitches
Listen to 'em they like
Oooohhh
My niggas sellin' millions makin' millions
almost diamond but you still ain't gold yet
(I know it hurts)
Hear me on the radio and see me in every video and on all the magazines
(I bet it hurts)
Spot me in that new Bentley
the Bensey or the Rover while you still leasin' that old shit
(Oow, I know it hurts)
 I fuck 'em when I meet 'em then delete 'em
 heard you treat 'em and you still ain't fucked yet
(Oow)</pre>
