I remember back in the days we used to live so right
not word about a thang just ridin my bike
clicked up with the homies at the school house ballin
after dark I hear my teacher at the front door callin
I aint leavin til I hit this J sittin in my mouth
walkin home hella high passed out on the couch
those were the dayz dead now things did change
takin dibs and yellin out young thugs names
tappin phones tappin homes best watch yo back
get gd up in your life stop worshipin scratch
leave the dope game alone and find your way back home
give love to the thugs that are passed and gone

(chorus)
been so long I miss my homies
been so long I really miss my homies
we keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
been so long I really miss my homies

(killa tay)
there are so many homies to this game
but will it change got me goinin the same livin the range ????? the brain 
feelin the pain
wonderin if ill ever see my G's again
dependin on god to GLD when I need a friend 
resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse
we livin revalation so I'm headed back to church
ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons
officially made no more stressin we infested in funds
im still thuggin money cant change me
still free until I'm six feet deep I rest in piece

(chorus)

(marvaless)
rememberin some times
about the old school days
when we was rippin verses 
strictly for the love of the game
talent shows were the thang
and all the sessions were packed
you had to raise out the stop if you were weak on the rap
put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
servin them all with the dream 
no matter how bad it seemed
kept our eyes on the prize
always strivin for more
raise up in the ghetto
fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
half way we be choosin
missin all my homies restin six feet 
always keep your name in the streets
make sure they know how we did it
until  we meet on the other side 
ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
til we meet again stya up and tru
