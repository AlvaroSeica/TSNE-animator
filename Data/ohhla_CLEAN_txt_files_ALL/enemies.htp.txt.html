[Hollow Tip]
I spend too many days... on the street
Too many nights wit heat
I got my mind right, heart strong
Quick on my feet, I never retreat
I write my lifestyle to the beat
I try to slow down
But I'm in this lifestyle too deep
I can't sleep unless the Hennessy's poppin'
My enemy's plottin' to leave a nigga dead
Wit my memory forgotten
The streets is watchin'
Niggas is rottin', bodies is droppin'
Heats is cockin'
Leavin' the "ride or die" option
Don't I spend
Through the spot fulla eight block men
Rockin', big jewels, we got it locked in
It ain't no stoppin'
The way I do business wit a few killas
Got to shake a few niggas to get my true skrilla
But yo I'm back again
Throw away gats and Henn
Fly outta Sac and then
Come back wit scratch and film
I never scratch my Tims
When shit get rough and rugby
I guess the streets just love me
Or only God can judge me
These niggas try to mug me
They think I'm sippin' bubbly
But I'm just sippin' Henny
Ready to leave you bloody
The situation' ugly
These niggas wanna slug me
I'll even fuck wit the pistol
And make you niggas love me

[Chorus]
Yo this is 4 my enemies
You prayin' for me to fall
I'm a ball, for nothin' but y'all, stand tall
4 my enemies [4 my enemies]
Niggas payin' they bread to see me dead
Put two in my head for what I said
4 my enemies [4 my enemies]
You can suck my dick
I'd rather die wit the four-fifth
And die like a bitch
4 my enemies [4 my enemies]
You'll never take me alive
I'm hard to survive
Ride-da-da-da-da-da [echoes out]

[Hollow Tip]
This is 4 my enemies
I see you plottin' and grinnin'
Tryna cock block the women
Bust shots in my linen
Stop pretendin', you hated me from the beginnin'
And you still playa hatin' in the ninth innin'
So I'm a break it down
I never took it and don't take it now
Slip in the clip
Dip, hit niggas wit fatal rounds
See I'm from California
We hustle on the corner
If I ain't ridin' wit cha
My niggas ridin' on ya
And that's just how it is
Fuck all that coward shit
These niggas gotta know it
I'm on a power trip
Who wanna make a move?
Who got some shit to prove?
Then bust your heater nigga
We ain't got shit to lose
I wanna get it started
Come at you cold hearted
I'll look you in yo eyes
Empty the whole cartridge
You gon' get it really
I think these niggas silly
Stab me in my back
So they can get the skrilly
My nigga light the philly
And we gon' ride to city
I'm comin' for that bitch nigga that ripped me
Try to hit me
But real niggas land on they feet
Northside, North High, for life, H Street

[Chorus] x 2</pre>
