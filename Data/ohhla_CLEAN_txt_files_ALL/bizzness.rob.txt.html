[Lil Sicko]
As I pull out the strap and get ready to kill
Seeing you on the floor, is my big fucking thrill
Trying to kill me again, HA, don't make me laugh
What made your ass think that our business would last?
Trying to fuck with my money, when I treated you cool
But you didn't know your fuckin' with this crazy ass fool
18 years old, and a baller for life
Never forget that night, that I fucked your wife
Trust a g with my kilo, I gave you stack's of c-notes
Pimped road in the lex, then we lounged on speed road
When you needed some men, you knew I was always there
And you needed days off, but I really didn't care
We came really tight, and I had you around
To the fuckin' day, I was missin' a pound
Fucking bitch thought I was a clown
Then turn around, pop goes the strap, and your body was found

Chorus:
See I lost one, and you found one
Now they knowing your a bitch
Because you caught one
Now I'm knowing that you won't forget this (why)
That's what you get, for fuckin' with my bizzness

[Lil Blacky]
When we were youngster's, we would fight over the same girl
She had some juicy lips in a sparkle of a plural
I like her lot, but she wanted from me
Is a year older, you always have more chances then me
But I was in a raza, and I had a lotta ridges
Always taken back with three, four, or five bitches
But I got stuck, with an old ass hag
That was gettin' very ugly, and always on her rag
And you a guy, you was so tough
Kick it back with your lady, but you ain't even crazy
Now your jealous, and I'm winnin' this game
I'm a playa for life, and Imma push you in shame
Who da blame but your self, through sickness and in wealth
This I will tell, now tell me what the hell

Now what?...Fuckin' bitch
Lil Sicko, Lil Blacky, Hectic one doing this shit

Chorus 2x

[Hectic]
You fucked up, when you turned on me
Became a rata, now your d-i-e
We pulled mission's and always got away
Makin' stack's of bill's, that will make our day
We split it, and we made a profit
No one ever stopped it, why you fuckin' jockin'?
It's me? the one and only Hectic
Sit back, respect it, as I fuckin' wreck it
Muthafucker

Chorus 4x</pre>
