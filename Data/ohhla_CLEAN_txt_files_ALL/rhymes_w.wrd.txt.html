S.O.S. Edinburgh
Hip-hop, Yeah, In Edinburgh

(Auld Reekie)
Its Auld Reekie Edinburgh
The place were I live, its where I suffer
Its where I surfaced, then found purpose
Purchased a mic now I live in the circus
Hurts its just this small rap circuit
Birthed it with a new style they judged it
Loved it, chucked it, shunt it, bump it
Buy it, try it or get to (uh) with
Your biased, slyest, sick agendas
I try to stay chilled but you raise my temper
We live in a city where we all remember 
Its not all the splendor of city centre
The castle, tourists, dont you loose it
I see the poorest and kids with bruises
Smacked up mums and the youth out boozing
A fucked up place if you keep on looking

[Sample]

[Werd]
Here listen (real talk)
I dont act like that man that I is
Nor do I act like the clan that Im with
I dont act, in fact I is
So on these tracks you see how I live
Shit, its a day in the life
We drink all day, we drink all night
(Its not a good thing) see I feel shite
Thats the reason that I drink, the reason that I write
See demons creeping got to get steaming
Got to seep out this stuff calling feelings
Got to ease up on the weed Im breathing
In day out of my box like D.M.T.
Reeking, vampire life
Because you know Im out of my box all night
Put coffin down in the break of the light
Pure coughing up shit I never seen in my life

(Never ever what it seems, in Edinburgh)

Look, theres different sides to the city
Theres different sides to us
Welcome to Scotland
