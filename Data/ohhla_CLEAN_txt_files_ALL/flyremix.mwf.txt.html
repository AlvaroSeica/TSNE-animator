[LaMaRe]
Black men keep droppin
Black men keep on droppin like flies
Vultures (vultures) plottin on my demise
(Stool pigeons still lies while the caged bird cries)
As long as the mighty eagle rules the skies
(Black men keep on droppin like flies)  Droppin like flies

[Danja Mowf]
Yo, it's only right that I take flight
(Where?) To the sky, floatin like a black butterfly
I try to make my migration pleasant
But livin in the present gets you shot down like a pheasant
The reason, seems every day is huntin season
At least on the block where the black birds flock
Some of these birds choose not to soar the sky
They just stay in some shit, makin them more like flies
Day in and day out another one dies
(I got it, another fly nigga got swatted)
The time he was alotted, it seems just ran out
Or could it be the fact he never let his wings span out?
Acting like a chicken scared to leave the coup
Cause the chicken doesn't fly, he just stays with the group
Chillin with a bunch of turkeys waiting for Thanksgivin
If he had of flown South he might have kept on livin cause

[LaMaRe]
Vultures, plottin on my demise
(Stool pigeons still lies while the caged bird cries)
As long as the mighty eagle rules the skies
(Black men keep on droppin like flies)  Droppin like flies

[Danja Mowf]
Fo'-fo's and po-po's don't scare these pros
In the night time, duckin from constant shot buckin
They stuck in fly paper (well makin paper is fly)
Cause the eagle's on the paper, now you understand why?
When the eagle rules the sky, many black men die
Chasin eagles then get scavanged by the vultures nearby
Thereby, reducin us like calories
Shot down like ducks in shooting galleries
Please, freeze, these, mentalities
that's holding you back from gettin busy like bees
In trees you rest, buldin your nest with sess
Soothin your bird chest from chest, you just buddha blessed
Yes, every block or two them hoes will find a cock or two
With no penis cap and get you caught up in her venus trap
Indeed, don't be droppin your bird seed
Pollinatin wild flowers, it's all in your power cause

[LaMaRe]
Vultures, plottin on my demise
(I watch like the sparrow, in some Godly eyes)
As long as the mighty eagle rules the skies
(Black men keep on droppin like flies)  Droppin like flies

[Danja Mowf]
The caged bird sings but his songs get muffled
Feathers get ruffled, it's a struggle in the everyday scuffle
I tried to warn him bout these snakes and cats
But they hardheaded like woodpeckers and they blind as bats
That's the reason I keep preachin but you
in denial like a owl always talking about "Who?"
I should call you a parrot cause you act that way
First around a bunch of niggaz, repeatin what they say
Thinkin that you're fly pimpin round like a peacock
But your turf, your whole earth, consists of only three blocks
Take them keylocks off of your mind
Take a journey out of the ghetto just to see what you find
And like the raven said to Poe and only told him "Nevermore"
If from your dome you never go then any more you'll never know
See how some other guys live they lives, not like flies
Realize your limit ain't the skies
