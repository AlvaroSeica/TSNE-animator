Typed by: @MegaRan

This is the result of Saturday morning cereal
and 8-tracks stacked on the stereo
They say that I'm lyrical
The fact that I'm breathing is still a miracle
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it here it go
They go I loved that video man it's real dope
50,000 views later I'm still broke
I miss ridin the bus chillin wit Real folks
I miss my moms too, although we still close
Kinda different cuz I'm across the map
And I know she in the jungle amongst them wild cats
I'm spitting wild raps like I did a while back
When I was I child I acted like a child act
So now I come wit a diff style track
We old heads tryna bring a little style back

Well it's the sock hop-
Hip hop meets bebop
Non stop, all day that's how we rock
Well it's the sock hop
We keep the party indoors
Shoes off we don't wanna mess up the gym floor
Sock hop, sock hop, it's the sock hop grab a partner lets go
It's the sock hop sock hop and you better get your body on the floor

Release dates never change keep me
Pacing nervous
Praying nerds and backpackers will make a purchase
Bitin my nail Waiting for the first reviews to surface
Moms happy She dont have to Remove the Curses
They ask dont you Dream of Stacking a grand
I love leaving crowds Clapping ya hands
Man, I'm tryna do, me, and avoid the drama too
Just to make the old heads to tell me I'm Proud of you
don't wanna let you down
try not to mess around
Trying to perfect my sound
I don't wannna stress you now
Hope my early raps don't surface
If they do I tell em I was wack on purpose
Fly so high call it acro circus
Mega ran mega jams at yo service?

Well it's the sock hop-
Hip hop meets bebop
Non stop, all day that's how we rock
Well it's the sock hop
We keep the party indoors
Shoes off we don't wanna mess up the gym floor
Sock hop, sock hop, it's the sock hop grab a partner lets go
It's the sock hop sock hop you better get your body on the floor

Shh quiet down don't tell the faculty
Its where We dance all night till we got the dragon feet
Hah, I'm supposed to be in detention
For beatin down blade and his zombie henchmen
I can extinguish your burnin heart --girl.. Behind the bleachers at Sherman park
Thorough...Before you my world was dark
*Played my role from the beginning so I earned my part
But you know Stay with the Slick moves
Got my mojo back, so I'm in cruise
Move...Till its time to zoom like the commodores
Bring the hammer to the track like the mighty Thor
I'm a flying car, and you're a dinosaur
and for that, I'll walk alone like Dinah Shore
(P) bibbidi boppity boo
You ain't stopping the crew, Shine like the monopoly shoe

So until we go bankrupt we gon keep
dancing with the stereo cranked up
Mad inappropriate
Movin around till you Get motion sick (barf!)
Open it, now you see how live its sposed to get...
They say i got Splendid verses
8 bit rap king cool but I didn't birth it
Ran spit it pixel perfect
I haven't even skimmed the surface, merked it

Well it's the sock hop-
Hip hop meets bebop
Non stop, all day that's how we rock
Well it's the sock hop
We keep the party indoors
Shoes off we don't wanna mess up the gym floor
Sock hop, sock hop, it's the sock hop grab a partner lets go
It's the sock hop sock hop you better get your body on the floor</pre>
