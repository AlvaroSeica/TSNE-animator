[Mastamind]
Get cho' ass on the mic

[Esham]
This is for all the bitch ass niggaz who thought it stop when it don't stop
The wicked shit will neva die

[Mastamind]
Neva die

[Esham]
Here's a little inscription from the witch docta....voodoo
Ey....you betta off committin suicide then tryna play this shit right here
Cuz it'll drive you crazy, you're outta control out ya mind....

[Mastamind]
Out ya mind...

[Esham]
Now as I speak the wicked poetry that got you all scared of me
Blasphemy I'm sacrilegious nigga don't you ever forget this
When I hit the scene I'm the #1 murder suspect suicide
I'm yellin' out "Die die die die!" bland out while yo' mama cry
Did it ever occur to you, I sold my soul out whateva' fo'
Niggaz ain't nuthin' but a buncha ho's, thinkin' that don't nobody know
Hey nigga, I want you dead, bloody murda never restin'
I know killas since adolescence, death I murder to be destined
If you ain't prepared to die nigga don't play the game of death that I'm  playin'
Cuz the niggaz that I know is sprayin' with Ak's in their hands
Say "I want that nigga dead" 3 times in the dark while I'm rappin'
&amp; before this song is over watch my demons go cappin', sayin'

[Chorus]
I want that nigga dead
[There's a price on ya head]

You say you want that nigga dead because you hate his fuckin guts
He always talkin' that ho ass shit about you thinkin' you ain't got no nuts
Is you ever gonna show that nigga that you ain't scared of his ass?
Is you down to blast in the broad daylight without yo' ski mask?
You went down so fuckin fast you dropped the gun out your hand
You shot a man he was screaming he was bloody so you ran
So now you paranoid so people you avoid
Suicidal smoking on them dead flowerz destroyed
Nigga, you better run for your life that's all you can do
Cuz I know what they're gon say when they catch up with you, they'll say

[Chorus]

See they want me dead so much these voices in my head won't let me rest
Razor blade inside my mouth I'm carving "NATAS" in yo' chest
Tell yo preacher I'ma kill'em, cuz there ain't no way to stop me
You can't hurt me if you squirt me, I won't die even if you pop me
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, &amp; I sing that murda lullaby
So well enough to die don't blame the devil blame that other guy
We all live on this planet babies born in sin
Some niggaz commit suicide as soon as I begin
Unholy, unholy, you don't know me, but you owe me
Yo' soul nigga roll go outta control
Cuz if they catch you, they gon' stretch you
&amp; I bet you they will let you write a check with yo mouth through yo asshole

[Esham]
I got 25,000....on yo bitch ass head...
&amp; I know i can get it....nigga....if I chop yo head off....what?</pre>
