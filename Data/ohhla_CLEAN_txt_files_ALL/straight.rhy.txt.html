[Verse 1: Possessed]
I'm coming out swinging underdog, bare knuckle-box 
This time round the gloves are off
Killer in the London fog 
Heads hung in shame, from the wall of my hunters lodge
(Pure evil) swallowed me up 
Double cross Christ coz once wasn't enough
Want death sooner than later
My mother got a rotten apple as the fruits of her labour
Carlos the Jackal, lock stock and barrel 
Disguised in stolen S.W.A.T apparel 
Who wanna battle?
I switch to auto-pilot, coz I'm known to fly off the handle
G.O.D, Elohim
Laying a blessing over this chemo beat
(Rise) to the T.O.P
Yo Skirmz, anyone iller than us? ["Negro Please"]

[Chorus]
Straight spiting, straight up and down 
Straight out the gate, came unannounced
Stay underground, straight madness
Stay strapped in my straight jacket (Ha, ha)
Straight spiting, straight up and down 
Straight out the gate, came unannounced
Stay underground, straight madness
Stay strapped in my straight jacket

[Verse 2: Psiklone]
I'm good minus an 'O'
In fact minus an '0' from two different digits of binary code [Number one] 
Satanic orphans, catching corpses
Forcing pro-lifers to have abortions
Read your mind with my evil eye
Spit sound waves exceeding twice the speed of light 
Divine genotype
Physically Jesus Christ's body evolved and redesigned
Emaciated carcass
Plunge in chasms snap the safety harness and embrace the darkness
We're holy saviours
Head butting speeding bullets back in their revolver chambers
Educated in the killing fields
Learnt to stick knitting needles into both my Achilles heels
Self-taught ninja masters
I'll shadow kick the sun n plunge the planet into darkness

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3: Skirmish]
It's the man with the attitude problem in rap 
Who's flipping his lid at the drop of a hat
Take it how you want if you wanna react
Get knocked unconscious flat onto your back
Barking mad if you're not feeling this
Strangled to death with dog collars attached
Action speaks louder than words 
So it don't mean shit when you shouting ya verse
Seventh son, of a seventh son
[Lights out] so your death resembles the setting sun
Living heartless
The opposite of positive, with thorns on my rose tinted glasses
So learn from the best 
Eleven letters already murdered the rest
See you in hell - you can burn in the depths
You spent life paying to gain it, we earned the respect

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
