[Verse 1]
Aye
We gon bury ya, cause Lil Jay gon bust a bitch
Comin wit a monster click, Allenwood off in this shit
Step and get yo ass kicked, bust a bitch wit the Beretta
Suckaz wanna playa hate, but my niggaz know me betta
I'ma shoot at ya sweater neva underestimate
And my crew got Berettas so don't neva hesitate
If you knew that we was betta then you would neva try to hate
We can take it there wheneva let me fuckin demonstate
Any day, any night, we won't leave without a fight
M.O.B. we play no games and swang on niggaz we don't like
So you know we bout that action and don't neva think you bad
We be deep off in these street and we gon beat yo stupid ass

[Verse 2]
Yeah
If you gon try me, you'll get yo ass kicked
Step to MIG or Princess I blast bitch
Nigga dis shit goin down we gonna get clicked up
If you fuck up my knuckin my thug mane I'll fist up
You gon get yo shit stuck
I'ma laugh in yo face cause I really don't give a fuck
You testin my thong boy
if you try me deny me I'm throwin my chrome toy
You talkin that shit I'm slappin you quick
you a bitch, you neva my homeboy
I'm tellin you nicely, you front wit it
still gonna pay up the price chick
A person you might been, I'm still gonna knock yo ass out if you try me

[Chorus 2X]
If you gon try me, you'll get yo ass kicked
If you gon try me, you'll get yo ass kicked
If you gon try me, you'll get yo ass kicked
You'll get yo ass kicked, you'll get yo ass kicked

[Verse 3]
You think you bout it you can't be, fist into yo nose and teeth
Everybody in dis muthafucka gon lend a hand to me
Hit 'em just like its suppose to be, it was all about the dollars
MIG be in dis pimpin, and this time I pop my collar
I don't care my niggaz follow, in my eyes I see yo doom
The expresion on yo face, when we clear this fuckin room
Like a boom and thats a fact, I be diesel call me Shaq
Like studios I'm gon act up and put my dick on the track
Bitch get the fuck back wanna act lke yo tough
Caught me buckin wit the click and got ya shit fucked up
Niggaz thinkin that they tough, in the club like they bout it
Allenwood muthafucka let me show you somethin bout it nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 4]
I'm back to get buck, it's a must that I erupt
I see these niggaz think I lost it but I neva gave a fuck
I'm still the same ain't too much changed but the time that I lost
I had some brushes wit the law, so I had to pay the cost
But it's ok I'll shake it off, it's M.O.B. off in my blood
Talkin shit you get fucked up, you'll get drug through the mud
M.O.B. is too damn buck, so it's a must that you think wisely
Bustin heads off in the club, if a pussy nigga try me.

[Chorus 2X]

Aye (&amp;repeat until the end*)</pre>
