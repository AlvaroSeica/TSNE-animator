[Truck]
Better off broke if you ask me
I'd rather get my own shit, before you gas me
It's kinda funny how one little situation had to trap me
All that time for one, listen, pa, I can't see
Second year in high school, he should of stayed in the books
But just like his dad, the boy wanted to be a crook
Let some kid around the way, fill his head with the juks
Moms smoke and you know the house look like trash
Little sister only 12, giving up ass
All types of sick thoughts when you live in the hood
Trying to raise a family on your own, that's up to no good
Back to B, standing near the school, posting the block
Doorag and hoodie over his head, holding the glock
Leave one victim with the chain raid, didn't see the cop
He pulled out, his whole duke duke running
In one swift motion, through the gun to his stomach
As soon as B turned around, he started to flee
Only got to the corner and was surrounded by d's
Yeah, was young, but charged as adult
All this kid ever needed was some tough love in the belt

[Chorus 2X: Truck, Bless]
This whole world is filled with nothing but, situations, situations

[Truck]
Now being jealous, little sister still running the streets
Fell in love with a pimp, now she's running the beat
He said listen here, I'mma name you Baby Doll
In just a few weeks, I'mma make you a star
Live it up with fur coats, pushing the hottest cars
Every night, me and you ma, dining out
The whole game is mad real, you gotta grind it out
And Baby Doll don't know, she'll be finding out
The choice you make, is the choice you hold
Standing on the tracks, barely not knowing, and freezing cold
I feel sorry for the girl, god save her soul
You wanna know what really hurt me the most?
Seeing this young girl laying on her back, eyes open like a ghost
This here's real life, not to brag and boast
Can't go back home cuz moms switch to the diesel
Overdose the dime, strung out by the needle
The next day I opened the papers, it's making me sick
To find out Baby Doll got killed by Trick

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
It's like chess, think before you move
Always use your first instinct, you always lose
The second time don't do bump, just a time, man, know the rules
Step a step, man, you will try to take 'em to school
This whole world is based it, nothing but the type
Fuck ups is the way, shit, now tell me what you facing
Not all day, some is good, like live it all up your night
We getting out of the hood

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Bless]
Uh, uh, uh, chea, chea, chea
Cue Trax, Truck, situations...</pre>
