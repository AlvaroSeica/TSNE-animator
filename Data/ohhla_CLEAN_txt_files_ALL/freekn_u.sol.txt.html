[Solomon Childs]
First of all you the baddest thing in the club, tonight
Do you work? Do you cook?
Are you in school, a queen is what I'm in to
Who respect kingpin rules
My rag 'em up, from busting ginsu's
Cut up pies, spit in the face of fake tough guys
Who question, Cherokee, plus posess massage therapy
With them country recipes, she push the CLS500 sesame
System bumping Keisha Coles, prolly bury bowls
Of life, like Vivica Fox on Set it Off
Beef with them dudes on the block, she'll let the semi cough
Tattoo's and electric belts, with Solomon Childs throwing the cross
I'm stomaching acid, purple haze in the dooney and burnt bags
Finally your court offended the homey down like I never had

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
We'll meet again, I hope you tell me when
I know how you must feel, cuz all love ain't for real
Try to understand, that I'm not an average man
