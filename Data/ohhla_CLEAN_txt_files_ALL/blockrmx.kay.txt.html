[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
DJ Kay Slay The Drama King!!!! 
In the hood where I come from, we didn't give a damn about no rockstars!!!
It's about being a blockstar!!!

[Chorus: Ray J] (Plies)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!! (Yeah!!! Yeah!!!)
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!! (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yo!)

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Yo this the remix Slay? Let me handle my biz
And give them the proper meanin of what a blockstar is (HUH!)
A blockstar up in the hood see what they fame does (HA!!!)
Is gettin love bigger than rap is when they name buzz (HUH!!!)
And live the life that most of you talk but be afraid of (YEAH!)
Most of them dudes you can't even disclose the names of 
You probably see one while admirin the shine on 'em
End up carryin a brick across the state line for 'em
LISTEN!!! And while most of you niggas sold (HA)
A dream but most of you reckless 'cause niggas live by the code (NOW!!!!)
I hope you lil' niggas learn sum'n
'cause the cloth of blockstar that I was cut from (GET 'EM!!!)

[Chorus: Ray J] 
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Where do I start? I know where, straight from the heart
I used to freestyle with Cam, Ma$e and 'Gruff at the Mart (Waddup?)
Crack rocks and a tennis ball, go when the D's come
Sheek, Jada and P, D-Block you know where we from (L-O-X)
Hoodie on nickel plate taped up handles
Pop till it's rosemary candles and prayer service
The Aston Martin make my mama nervous (I got it ma)
Do I deserve this Gucci? Too many pretty women throwin me coochie
Outside in the yard with a lucie, who's he?
Gwen Stefani in my top five, Grey Goose and Sour Diesel
You would think River Phoenix alive
Allah U Akbar, yeah I'm a blockstar WHATTUP!!!!

[Chorus: Ray J] (Rick Ross) 
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
(Kay Slay, waddup nigga?)
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!

[Verse Three: Rick Ross]
Day 90 when I set it off, pushin that ready rock
Whip it like I'm Freddie Foxxx, lookin at a petty car
(YEAH) I made it rain, you only watch the 'fetti fall
I got so many flaws, as in too many cars
I call 'em Kate and Jon's, therefore the panties small
Suck it like spaghetti straws, only in Miami, dawg
Too cool to talk, my shoes +New+ as +York+
Still skinnin them chickens, that's food for thought
I'm a blockstar - BOSS, Frank Lucas in the flesh
Fila's sweatsuits, three Cuban's on my neck  (YEAH)
Trips to Beijing, shit you ain't seen (NIGGA)
Clips underground, my chips is mainstream
BOSS

[Chorus: Ray J] (Papoose) 
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!! (Papoose, Pa-poose)

[Verse Four: Papoose]
The lucky guy, who always win at the dice game
The neighborhood wino, we all give him change
The dude who covers up his sneaker with a sock
Damn! He could pop a wheelie the whole block
The girl with the big earrings they was hallow
But she was solid, she grew up to be a model
The basketball player who be reppin
He never made it to the NBA, but he a hood legend
The rapper in the cypher with a lot of skills
Growin old in the cypher, he never got a deal
The fallen soldiers, Allah
Gone but not forgotten, blockstars

[Chorus: Ray J]
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!

[Verse Five: Vado]
Uh, aiyyo the dude think he smarter
Before he hopped in I hit my man with the revolver
and clip him like a barber
I show you how to do it from the kitchen like a Martha (yes)
Sicker than Stuart Scott when spittin I'm a monster
(HUH!!!!) No heroin when I squeeze off
Watch the nine throw bullets like Drew Brees arm
I ain't Joe Clark, +Me+, you can't +Lean On+
Mink warm, throw up the set, the three rings on

[Verse Six: Cam'Ron]
Uh, blockstars (stars), rockstars (stars)
Drop cars (cars), followed by cop cars (cars)
Pepper spray, handcuffs, never SAFE! (SAFE!)
One word, word, don't remember yesterday (nope!)
Check my résumé, quick to catch amnesia (I don't know)
Extra K, two ki's, mad reefer (reef-a)
Bad diva (diva), my black beaver (beater)
Coke dealer, Streetsweeper, max skeeter
(SLAY!!)

[Chorus: Ray J]
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
