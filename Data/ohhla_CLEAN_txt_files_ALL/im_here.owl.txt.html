[Knightowl]
As the world keeps turnin my soul keeps burnin
I'm caught up in the mix with shit that is bottled up inside my chest
My only motivation be retaliation
I swear some day I'ma take over this whole fuckin nation
I'm sick and tired of all those fools that disrespect
The reason you be talking holmes is cause you haven't meet me yet
So learn mothafucka or burn mothafucka
You die when you mess around cuz fool this wop town
I do not give a fuck about those that suppose
The dead will never rise they sleep after they shut their eyes
They won't ever see the light of day again
They'll never breathe again
They'll never be able to disrespect this hooligan
Cause I'ma make sure that if you get on my bad side
You'll be next to rest eternaly no love maternaly
Nobody to consolidate you problems
Ain't nobody there to help you solve them
Your homies will die too if you envolve them

[Chorus]
Cause I don't give a fuck about your crew
So whatcha you want to do
I'm here to trouble you I represent the W
And if you want to start some static homie we can rendeavous
(2)

[Knightowl]
I got the whole world lookin at me, enemies want to gat me
Talkin about the day they catch me there're gonna snatch me
And take me...
To a little place that be secluded
They said when they find me that I'm a get exacuted
There're gonna sit me... tie me up... and rough me up...
Stick me in the neck... put me on a boat and throw me off the deck
But I don't think so holmes, I wanna keep on livin
So you will be the next to go to the land of the unforgiven
You fuck around fool, so now you got to pay the price
You should've known holmes that messin with Knightowl ain't nothing nice
I be the type of fool that'll laugh, I'm evil like witch craft
I'm sick up in the mind, I represent the 619
Now who's the one that'll run, who's the one that'll die
Victims all collapse, perhaps they're only takin naps
If you were to open up your eyes
Would you repint, or wouldn't act like a soldier and represent your hood

Chorus

[Knightowl]
Another day up in the land of the no good
In this world full of hate disrespect and I don't conversate
I'm quick to blast and leave you mothafuckas frozen
Do you wanna be the next inside a casket posen
Get bullets all inside you then worms all inside you
What happen to your homies that were right beside you
The day I shot you in the face, then ran like bitches
They wasn't down to die with you
They wasn't down to ride with you
They talked alot of shit and said that they was gonna get me
But as a matter of fact, I shot em, I'm the one that got em
The Knightowl be the sickest fool up in the city
Got the bitches
Got the money
It's my world of milk and honey
Now who be bad enough, come step and catch a hot one
I got one for all of you, and all those that follow you
Cause I'll never be without a weapon
I'm down to fight so fuck all you haters and all you imitaters

Chorus

That's right mothafuckas
Once again The Knightowl
Bringing to you some of that real gangsta shit
Some of that kind of shit all you other rapers don't like to spit
Cause you be bitches
The Knightowl don't give a fuck
I'll tkae all you mothafuckas on
Whether it's lyrically or physically
Yall can't get with me
I'm to fuckin sick, I don't give a fuck
Much love goin out to a couple of homies of mine
By the name of CG, my home boy Pistol Pete
My other homie Shadow, 619 representer
That's right, Woptown's up in this mothafucka
I'm bangin on wax, on tracks and on the streets
Cause I don't give a fuck, fuck all you mothafuckas</pre>
