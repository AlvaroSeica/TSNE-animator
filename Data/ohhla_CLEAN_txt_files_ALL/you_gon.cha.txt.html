[Intro: sample]
"Cause each, and every day that you stay away
 Breaks my aching heart in two and it's causing me to pray
 Oh baby, baby, baby"

[Chamillionaire]
Uhh, let me talk to my congregation
They tell me that money talks so let's get some communication
It, took forever but you've been patient
The negative liars tryin to hint at the reputation
Just, know your troubles won't be forsaken
They tell me that money talks so just pay me with conversation
Everything has a price, if you don't know what you'd pay for your life
You don't know what you pay for your life? You gon' learn tonight

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
This is where you learn how to win
The congregation is here, let the conversation begin (A-men)
Turn your scriptures to page ten
Cause loyalty's everything and flip-floppin should be a sin (A-men)
Pass the offerin plate again
If you supportin the movement then prove it by what you spend
Everything has a price, if you ain't learned anything in your life
... you gon' learn tonight

[Chamillionaire]
Just do whatever you like

Tell 'em you sippin purple while smokin and gettin faded
Lyin ain't really lyin, the rappers is entertainment
When you get imitated that's when you know that you made it
Rappers go after women that every rapper done dated
Open the candy gates and she told me she Athiest
This vehicle heavenly, I just hope that you make the list
There isn't a man alive that can say he created this
Keep goin until your pockets and droppin cremated chips
Give me your dead prezzies, I'ma roll with the Dezzie
Eagle, that's just so people who evil'll know I'm ready
Pretty women who schemin to Kobe me at the telly
That's easy as tryin to take off a condom with a machete
My congregation is heavy, conversations is skill
Put money inside the plate that I'm offerin 'til it spill
Blasphemy if you actually got gangsta after a deal
The book of Bernard Freeman say thou is not +Trill+, chill

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
Uhh, uh
I've been knowin for attackin the preacher who doesn't practice what he preach
Slappin the rapper to keep inaccuracies in his speech
Say he packin when he reach
It ain't for nothin but for the jack that call his peeps
that only back him cause he's sweet
Yappin about a rap sheet when he ain't even got one
This nigga was an athlete, never touched a shotgun
Hurt cause he's too fake, worse than the two fate
Tough when he be on TV but in person's a fruitcake
"Our Father who art in heaven, hollow be Thy name"
That's what he gon' scream if some hollows hit his frame
But he ain't to blame, he gon' be in a lot of pain
Difference between rappers and gangstas, it's not the same
Yet I bow, my style is holier than thou
We good God gangbangers, we hold each other down
You? You a bitch, you could probably do a full split
So come up off the pulpit with that bullshit!

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Where do you go when you see the road and the fork split?
Hope it's some soldiers you're walkin into that door with
Lucky to beat but I always thought I would forfeit
Have me as twisted as the screw that I open corks with
Of course it's the switchin, of course it's in my vision
Thought I was shootin blanks but I pop a clip and they'll listen
Devils just keep on comin, they masters at repetition
Try to kill off my spirit, no time for a exorcism
All of this +Ammunition+, time for a revelation
Always was trigger-happy, I never had hesitation
They ain't up on my level, me and them ain't adjacent
I'm the original and they just some interpolations
Livin inside a world that we know is unfair
Rewind to the times when my mother told me that notice was there
Then she told me don't just be ready, be over-prepared
And always keep God first, well you 'bout to owe him a prayer
You almost there

[Chorus]
