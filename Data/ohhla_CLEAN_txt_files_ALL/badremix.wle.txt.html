[Intro: Wale]
Hm-mmm... I heard about you
You heard about me? Haha, yeah, get it
Wal, haha (Cause I haaaad, some issues)
Wal, haha, back at ya.. BAD GIRL~!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Is it baaaad that, I never made love
No I never did it, but I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your, baaaad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it, but at least I can admit 
that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you

[Interlude: Rihanna]
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

[Wale] + (Rihanna)
I want you to...
They say the certain type of girl relate to this
Folarin the Genius, WHOO~!
Work, haha, I-I-I think you gifted to baby
Hm-mmm, yeah, hold up..

Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
Look (And the bad girls want a real nigga), yeah, cause real niggas just want (haaaaa)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing, got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king), seems like the ones who rung never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, nooo to you) hm-mmm, in the literal sense, I mean the physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second, I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that
I heard you (bad girl), and I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous but we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass
We at that bed, floor, couch, hold up, (loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what? What's up? (Wassup?) Forget it, cause all the bad girls always +Unapologetic+, hehe

[Chorus]

[Wale] + (Rihanna)
Uh.. yeah, hold up, look..
She hurt feelings, she ain't wrong, she work hard, she play harder
Got a smart mouth, like a speed fly, she don't catch feelings she too busy catching G5
She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent, gon' blaze up, take the wheel Jah (haaaaa)
And Rihanna got these women in they River's Island, I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya 
Never did terrible bullshit ya, enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because you try to follow your gut feeling you get lost
(Cause I've haaaad, some issues) Some issues, yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin, you froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Pshh, get over here today, smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them, ain't no IG, but she follow K
And we at that bed, floor, couch, hold up (loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what? What's up? (Wassup?) Forget it, all these bad bitches always
UNAPOLOGETIC~!
