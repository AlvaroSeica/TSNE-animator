[Intro: King Just]
Yeah I always thought I wanted a
Vivica Fox, Beyonce type of chick, you know?
But I love my girls in the ghetto, man
I can't turn from them, man

[Chorus: King Just]
You will always be my...
Right by my side...
Til the day I die...
Wrong or right, she's mine, mine, mine, mine...

[King Just]
Man listen, I wouldn't have it no other way
I need a ghetto girl to satisfy KJ
Some come with babies, some go both ways
But some of them, don't even come home for days
They be standing on the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Asking me when the next album gon' drop
She had Timbs with stilleto's, bubble goose echo
Skin tight jeans with an ass like "whoa"
But you don't hear me though, I mean really though
My GG know how to roll, plus she love a bro
Complexion like an eskimo, soft as sensual
Rough when it's sexual, glad that I met you though
It's a festival, and your girls is invited
No need to get excited, they all gon' like it, when I pipe it
Feels like you on top of the world, I love me some ghetto girls

[Chorus: King Just &amp; Starr (Starr)]
You will always be my... (ghetto girl)
Right by my side... (ghetto girl)
Til the day I die... (ghetto girl)
Wrong or right, she's mine, mine, mine, mine... (ghetto girl)

[King Just]
My ghetto girl make Kool-Aid too sweet
And love to see me with only Timbs on my feet
And the streets, she's descrete, and so unique
If I was caught in a jam, man, she'll bust the heat
At the club, once a week, you know she a freak
In the back of the restaurant, she season my meat
She like it spicy, nicey-nicey, a little bit feisty
Flavor like an Italian icey
Use the stove to heat the house up, books hold the couch up
Section 8, straight she put in, for a voucher
Lounger told me, if she ghetto, she got a Metro
And hold cracks for you, when you see po-po, I'm flying solo
Until I meet this down ass chick
That hock a lungie when she spit, straight from the bricks
And no one I'm with, is gon' help me rule the world
I love me some ghetto girls, girls, girls

[Chorus]

[King Just]
She got door knocker earrings, belly button piercings
Tattoos that she don't like, but still wears 'em
Name brand shoes, atleast twenty pair of them
One to three kids, and always takes care of them
Miss Ghetto America, you wear the hood crown
And I love when you, go down
You got an attitude, slightly rude
And when it comes to sex, you always in the mood, on my interlude
We toast together, to make our life better
How could I love this ghetto girl, when I just met her
Thug at first sight, I knew she wasn't Miss Right
But she was Miss Right-For-Now
Yo she dug my style, and I dug hers
And she wasn't impressed by my diamonds and furs
She wants the simple things in life... my wife and my seed
And me, to fuck her all night

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
