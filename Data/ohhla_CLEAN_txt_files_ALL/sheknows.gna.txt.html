[Cee-Lo]
Up, up and away she goes
Now I know that I know she knows
Could want live a lie
Bit neither will I
If she still try to try
But remarkably my son, all my work is done
Wouldn't surprise me to see her ghost
She would like me to know she knows
And I'm almost sure
I was absolutely nothin before
Now I'm so, so much more
The one word that describes it best
I'm pretty much possessed
We are the reason, I suppose
And we've spoken so I know she knows
There was want to sacrifice
When you've lived more than twice
Or when I bet it's nice
Gonna be just like you, I'm givin my life too
No other woman would wear your clothes
And it goes without sayin she knows
She knows</pre>
