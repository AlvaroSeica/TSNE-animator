The Humdinger, a noun
A remarkable or outstanding personal thing of it's kind
An amazing thing~!
A jim dandy or a deally
A beaut'! Maybe a lollapalooza or a rip snorter
A peach, a doozy, a loo-loo
A whopper, the blunt.. {*record rips off needle*}

(YEAHHH YEAHHH YEAHHH, Da Humdinger!)
Look Yuk man I'm tryin to explain somethin
Aww go 'head man

(The felon been gone with a good stay-urr)
(And and now they back, and they gettin ready)
(to tearrr up Jack and scrimp Jenny)

(They got a big story to tell you)
(And and I would say it to ya, but they do it better)
(Nappy Roots)
