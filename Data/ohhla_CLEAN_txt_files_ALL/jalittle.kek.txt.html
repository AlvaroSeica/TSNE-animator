[Chorus] 
I'm just riding through the city 
Enjoying the lights, and enjoying my life 
I say I'm riding through the city 
And I done been on my grind, I done been on my grind 
I got the windows down, wind hitting the fade 
Been a good day, and I can't complain 
Riding through the city 
I'm just riding through the city 

[Verse 1] 
Maneuvering my equipment through the city 
Entourage behind me, one of my partnas with me 
Hand on my wheel, and my pinky ring hit me 
Wrist stay shining on the inside I'm smiling, yes sir I been grinding 
Windows down, enjoying the breeze 
Part of the busting down, exotic trees 
Take an exit, headed to the night life 
Had a good day, now it's time to make the night right 
Enjoying the night, and enjoying the lights 
I'm enjoying my life, not a worry in the world 
Got no pled round here, don't get it twisted it's real when I step round here 
Silent call me marvelous 
I'm just keeping things honest brah 
It's like the lights keep me powered up, and my grind keep my power up 
I'm just chilling, enjoying the feeling 
We gon' do it till the sun come up, let's ride 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' Keke] 
6-10 59, lights on the tower 
Street game money and power, every hour 
Windows up top down, let a G rock now 
Still here enjoying this life, and still around 
Right pass the stress and strain, like no thang 
I'm blessed just to be in this game, I can't complain 
Riding through the city, mine it's my time 
It's a whole 'nother level of grind, for this shine 
Don Ke 7-13, the lights beaming 
Most niggaz stuck in the bed, and still dreaming 
Broads on the line my nigga, they stay waiting 
Floating on that 2-88, I kept skating 

Ooooh, I told you I'ma ride for you - 4x 

[Chorus]</pre>
