[Intro: Shella]
I'ma do what I got to for you boo to make sure you want me
I'ma do what I got to for you boo to make sure you want me
Uhh, I'm on my Smitty
Yeah, uhh

[Shella]
Been a long time from the first day we met
I was on my low-key lookin laid back
Now you the reason I keep myself up
Outfits by the season, a little make-up
Uh, kicks turn to heels, hoops in my ear
Let my hair down, it's blowin in the air
Swear the way I look gotta make him want sex
Even when he don't see me send pics when we text
Uh, yeah, he keep the whip clean; big rims, big screens
Glad I ain't a chick tryin to get seen
But I look good, his friends wanna try me
When I'm gettin ready he be starin from behind me
Yeah, I gotta keep him on deck
Perfume behind my ear when he kiss me on my neck
Uh, the little things keep him thinkin 'bout me
And I promise I'll stay on it even if we had a shorty, uh

[Chorus: Shella]
I'ma do what I got to for you boo to make sure you want me
I'm gonna make you want me baby
I'ma do what I got to for youuuuu to make sure you want me
I'm gonna make you want me baby

[Shella]
Uh, yeah
French manicure, pedicured toes
Initial in the heart, gotta add stones
New panties and bras, every other week
Gotta look so sexy, even when I'm sleep uh
Excessive weaves that, bring it all in focus
Get another piercing uh, just so he can notice uh
Trim myself up, bikini wax shapes
from the heart to the strip to the lips on his face
No matter what it takes on my A game
Offense get him up, never fade away game
Uh, somethin like Richard Gere way that he was cummin
I get anything I want just cause I'm a +Pretty Woman+
Uhh, yeah, and I ain't worried 'bout cheese
Just keep myself right and be everything he need
Uh, and I know that I'm the main squeeze
Girl please, everywhere he go he wanna take me

[Chorus]

[Shella]
I'm gonna make you want me baby</pre>
