[Intro: Shawn Wigs]
Gotta, do the actual look and how I'm feeling inside
Take a look at me now, Wiganomics, that's right
Look in my eyeballs, baby, see me? Uh-huh

[Shawn Wigs]
I look nice in the S-Type, duel pipe
Smoked out with the deep dish satellite, chrome
But still rock a pay phone and piss in the doorway
Smoke dirt in the projects, in the hallway
Still rock rhymes for niggas without a deal
The ones who know real, and stay in the battlefield
Doorags, slang or hang ten, leave you like the headless horseman
My wild tricks, I've divorcing them
These Steve Austin niggas get money like Gates
With the big diamond rings and the iced out plates
Drink a case of the Amaretto mixed with the Scotch
Sit and let the watch sweep, stay sweet
Smoke a bag of the leak, speak my street lingo
Play all four courners like your grandmas in bingo
But still, loves to mingle, cop a pint of the Henny
Drink all night til I spent my last penny
Bent up, spent up, and I can't do shit
But still call my wiz to come push the whip
How real do it get, we dress like thugs
And pull all strings to get guns in the club
But still, rock a rag, fresh cut underneath
Smile with a whole mouth full of gold teeth
Hahaha, you wanna find that funny?
Don't worry bout Wigga doola, I get money
How real do it get?</pre>
