Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Tilt your head back and close your eyes

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You so anti, don't I matter (AH-WHHHAT?!!!?!) You so you so
You so anti, don't I matter (You punk bitch!)
You so anti, don't I matter (AH-WHHHAT?!!!?!) You so you so
You so anti, don't I matter (You punk bitch!)

[Verse One]
'Kay, what's this on your iPod? Tell me what you listenin to
Why you jumpin 'bout his money, I ain't hear him mention you
I know this aggravates you, and it upsets ya
But I change you, I know how you hear me is this better?
Yeah girl you like this, yeah dis yo' language
Life is short in black and white just like little penguins
Why you in social studies screamin and argue?
Why you Dr. Killjoy, shootin up the party?
Where you get that money from? Wait, where you runnin to?
Why I'm hearin sirens? Where them blue lights comin to?
Dog you a genius, you can blueprint and plan this
Instead of playin videogames why don't you take advantage?

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
What's that on your iPod? Tell me what you listenin to
Why you jumpin 'bout these bitches? I ain't hear 'em mention you
I know this aggravates ya, and it upsets ya
I'ma change ya I know how you hear me is this better?
I don't understand you, you the school's biggest cut up
Ridin in your momma car, boomin like a motherfucker
Why you always spittin for~? What you get her digits for?
Don't you know with no money that girl is not gon' give you none?
Life doesn't dish out, why you got yo' fist out?
Oh you just gon' run in there and five finger discount?
Talkin 'bout where the weed at; wait, what you coughin for?
I thought you was an expert now listen to the officer

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I know you're alive
And there's a lantern lit inside
It's not just burnin bright
It won't blow up in your face if you try
I know you try hard, but you gotta try harder
Now you got your light, to find your way
You're a multitasker, you're doin things faster
Are you gon' let this God-given gift decay?
Wait!

[Chorus]

[Outro - with Chorus again in background]
Motherfucker are you ADHD? ADHD? ADHD?
You jump around like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD
You catch the steel like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD
You fuck around like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD</pre>
