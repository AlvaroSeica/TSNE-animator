Activate, activate

Let me be ya teacher, I'm gonna school ya

Don't be afraid to take some direction
How can I show you, you should posses them
(Come closer, closer, closer)

Oh baby I'm bout to set it off at your adventures site (site, site)
Don't worry won't take you anywhere you don't like (like, like)
Just sit back relax let me be your guide (guide, guide)
There's so much we haven't tried

Cause I'm about to activate
Your fantasy baby won't you let me create
Cause I'm about to take it to a whole other level
Cause I'm about to activate
Your fantasy so I send you to outer space
(To activate that other side tonight)

So baby just sit back I know how to dictate
The place that I touch you, I'll do it the right way (Yes I'm gonna, gonna, gonna)
So keep your eyes right there just let them fix it
Where I will take you nobody will locate
(Take you higher, higher, higher)

C'mon c'mon c'mon
You can spend a day in a life
Should I spend your whole life in one day
It's the D.I.D.D.Y
Ain't you average Joe I'm no J.I.
When the bad boy is in the building
You can't fuck with one million
How you gonna put mirrors on the ceiling
So you can watch me do me
I'm in the zone like a to three
Girl I'm as rich as it get
I'm supposed to be styling
You ever fucked the stun star island nah
You ever made love to a stunner nah
You know you remind me of my medallion nah
Got no flaws dress no draws seven nights lips
Even got strong jaws
Call me Diddy the boss of the city
House so big you get lost in my city

Cause I'm about to activate
Your fantasy baby won't you let me create
Cause I'm about to take it to a whole other level
Cause I'm about to activate
Your fantasy so I send you to outer space
(To activate that other side tonight)
