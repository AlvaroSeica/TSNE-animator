[Wale]
Folarin, Double M
Slip N' Slide collabo; let's get it!

What you talkin' 'bout?
Know I've been a rumor well let me call you out
Where you put your crown? You got a little style
Let me put it down until you walkin' on the cloud
Look, the time's now, I'm intrigued
Whenever I browse I'll be sure you get things
Yeah, see what I did there
Slip inside of her body until she get there

[Chorus: Sebastian Mikael]
I can't lie, when I.. watch my ba-by
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spa
Hair done too, but girl, that was four shots ago
Now you can't, be-lieve, that you did it, with, me (ohh)
Cause you wasn't sayin' that last night

[Sebastian Mikael]
Girl, I swear to God, people pay for a smile likes yours (like yours)
And I'm loving it, chea (and I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it)
Girl, I swear to God, they'll pay for ass like yours (like yours) 
If it wasn't there, yeah, yeah (and I'm rubbin' it, I'm rubbin' it)
Ohh, ohh

[Interlude: Sebastian Mikael]
You wanna know if we can make this confidential
Between me and you (we already did it)
Between me and you (we already did it)
Remember when I said I'm tryna find something to get into
I was talkin' 'bout you (we already did it)
I was talking about you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Yeah, haha
This ain't real baby, what they talkin' 'bout?
Ain't no rapper that's alive call Folarin out
Now can you deal with it? I'll probably run you out
Cause I never tell a woman where my body call
Lemme tell 'bout last night (ohh yeah)
I don't remember much of last night (last night)
How I can say it keeping it polite
Umm, you left once, but she came twice so get it right - WHOO!

[Chorus]

[Sebastian Mikael]
I swear to God, and I promise I won't tell nobody
Your privacy is safe with me (and I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it)
Girl I swear to God I wanna get plenty time to touch you, yeah, yeah, yeah
(And I'm rubbin' it, I'm rubbin' it) Ohh, ohh
