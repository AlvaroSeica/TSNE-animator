Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Do you remember the time
when the purpose and the rhyme
was to see the souls affected
But now its to man
every purpose and every plan
to whom the praise is directed
We live out dream
make the crowd scream
but turn to yell at the sound man
Since where and when did we stop checking the word
and begin to start checking the sound scan
Remember when shows were for souls and rhymes were for flows
Now we spend one minute to pray
if even that for each day
but spend 2 hours checkin our clothes
what happened to the passion we was having that was sparked in the begining
but we're quick to cry
point the speck in your eye
but even quicker to justify our sinning
we're quick to diss and raise the fist to justify the things that we do
but for every finger we point at them
just remember freind there's 4 more pointin back at you
how and when did it all begin as ministry turned to industry
cause did jesus need a manager
record label
ditributor
or even a boooking agency
when troubles came
did he call upon the name
or turn to a lawyer to handle it
why do we ask God last
ignore the past
but be the first to ask our management
cause next to him
our glory's dim and truely pales in comparison
why does every move we choose seem to revolve around
we can get our groove on
but yet worry about comin on to strong
yet we water it down so much there aint even nothing left to chew on
souls become sales
and sales become a salary
give the crowd something to feel
whine about keepin it real
but dont try to keep it to reality
yet when its all over and the mic is hung and its all said and done
it wont matter how many battles I won
but only the souls that I have won
on the other side
will my silly pride cause me to hold my head up proud 
If I wont have beef with you then
tell me freind
why should I have a beef wth you now
At the end of my life when I held that mic did I really truelly deserve it
Forget if I was phat
Forget if I was whack
I want to hear well done my good and faithful servant</pre>
