[Heavy D]
Stories may be told, some right some wrong
About the way I put together, the Hev D song
Because the rhymes I recite, are powered like a rocket
When I say "bass" Eddie F will drop it
Decided in my mind to draw a picture that is perfect
Listened to it over and over but it was worth it
The Overweight Lover's got the WHOLE party jumpin
But that ain't nothin cause I just started cuttin
and flowin to the sound, created and designed
by me Heavy D, the Overweighter with a rhyme
Built like a bomb to destroy the place
Yo Eddie F, rock the BASS

[Heavy D]
Now when it comes to lovin, it can get no better
I keep a girlie warm in the winter like a sweater
Poetically spoken, the rest will get broken
While other flip lips if you talk start chokin
Take my gun and then aim it, your title I will claim it
Grab a camera, take a picture, blow it up and then frame it~!
The Overweight Lover's gonna dog the place
So Eddie F, rock the BASS

[Heavy D]
Ask {?} I slam, but fly's the tone
to the beat that I speak upon the microphone
Some describe my voice as a baritone
But all I know is on the throne, I hold my own
When you're entered the joint, you knew that I would rip
And there was hope that you could quote another Hev D hit
So I won't let you down, cause I'ma dog the place
Yo Eddie F, rock the BASS</pre>
