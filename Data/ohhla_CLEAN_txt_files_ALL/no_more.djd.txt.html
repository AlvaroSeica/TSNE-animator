Intro [Willie The Kid]
Yeah, Willie The Kid
Bright lights, street lights

Verse One [Willie The Kid]
Summertime in apartment 409
Had to clean up the kitchen with 409
It Was cookin up work, while my granny at work
My big cause he aint understand me at first
He said, the court room or the casket
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men, and you bound to be the fifth
Let's go

Chorus [Lloyd]
I lost my daddy at a early age
Told my mama don't cry for me
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be
But that's in my dreams, back to reality
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life

No more, No More [x2] No

Verse Two [Lloyd]
Just gotta learn to deal with problems
If you're young and from slum with no father
Got killed when you was little, still got mama
She try to tell him go to school, but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets
Will they ever make it big

Chorus [Lloyd]
Cause I lost my daddy at a early age
Told my mama don't cry for me
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be
But that's in my dreams, back to reality
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life

No more, No More [x2] No

Bridge [Lloyd]
I ain't ashamed to say that I shed a tear
Thinkin bout my dad I wish I had him back
I'd give up everything just to have him here
After this storm and rain I have no fear
Gotta keep holdin on, hold my head up strong
I know it won't be long until we'll be together again, foreal

Verse Three [T.I.]
I'm livin' for the moment
If I could turn back the days
Sure, you could turn this back
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker
Daddy wasn't in the crib, dat made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, Dat made me stuff up
Powder in a sack, which made me dumber
Now I'm standin on the corner, bag full of Marijuana, Crack
Pistol my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers, kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Haaaa, bet dat I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon respect that

Chorus [Lloyd]
Oh yeah
I lost my daddy at a early age
Told my mama don't cry for me
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be
But that's in my dreams, back to reality
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life

No more, No More [x2] No

Outro [Lloyd]
Guess, this is my life
And I wanna live it right
I don't wanna run the streets no more, no [x2]</pre>
