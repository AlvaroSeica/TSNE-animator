[Verse 1]
Pleae save a kid that needs some help 
And 
I can't begin to think of anything that could help 
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need 
How I feel upon a time so recent in time make me sad 
When I recollect how it use to be like David and Goliath 
Kinda like me and the devil tryna rip out my soul 
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no no 
You can try again and I'll be ready 
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy 
Krueger 
Nooo I'm not no loser 
Won't see you in hell

[Chorus]
At the end of the day, day
My momma told me dont let no one break me 
Let no one break me 
At the end of the day, day, nobody, nobody
Ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying 
If you were trying 
At the end of the day, day 
I'm walkin with a heart of a lion, yeah

[Verse 2]
Please save a kid that needs some help 
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth 
Hide and seek 
Within a dream I seem to glide above my horror though 
I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow 
To proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable 
And they talk and judge a man 
They have no clue of what im capable 
Til i show a side of me no one had thought could be within 
I told you no I'm not a loser 
I'll see you in hell

[Chorus]

Bridge: [x3]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, Yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm just a kid who needs no help 
I've achieved a bigger thing 
No cash or check could be more blessed 
And if you would've seen the things ive seen up in my slumber 
You'd be shook stay awake no need to run your fate will follow 
You should know 
Not for the faint at heart this world understands no coward 
It's a goal a simple code I stay on the grind to the 25th hour 
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within 
I told you no I'll never let you drag me down to hell

[Chorus]
