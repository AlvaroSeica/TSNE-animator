Song:   Watch Your Back
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't know who to trust no more
Let it go
It'll take me to war
That's those voices in my head
It's got me over seeing red
See I don't wanna cross the line
But that's the fucking last time
You ever try to play me out
Now this shit is going down

[chorus]

Watch your back homie
Watch your back [X5]

Watch your back nowdays
All these busters always lookin at me sideways
Sizing me up trying to figure out how I play
But I ain't playing with these motherfuckers no way
Not today or anyday
I learned the hard way
Been double crossed and backstabed
Been burnt for major money funny friends just went bad
It's high stakes even family members scheme on you
So know your enemy and only trust a chosen few

[Chorus]

Watch your back you'll get slapped
Sick of suckers talking smack
Run yo mouth were you at
Look at me like I'm wack
Is he fake can he rap
Don't get hit by his batch
Your the click he's the clack
I'm a dog, you're a cat
I'm taking it making it sound so great
So listen to the master demonstrate
When I smoke this blunt and elevate
Like damn our boys a heavyweight
We gonna bake to see if tonight's the night
Like damn our boys'll make it hot
Like damn our boys'll boys we just don't stop
Like damn our boys calling the shots
I know some cats that always talk a lot but did nothing
You never win you ending losing if you always bluffing
So you moving cakes
But you really only baking muffins
Raking up P's
Get rid of shit in bakers dozen
Big mounds yeah
They'll bound to catch it too
We knew who ran the lick
And there day is coming soon
You gotta watch your back
I know I'm watching mine
Just ask my soldiers who be holding down the front line

[Chorus]

You ever had a friend a bitch that claimed that they was down for you
I mean the loyal type you trusted thought they was true
You let deep inside
Kept them fed you kept them high
Come to find out every word they said was just a fucking lie
You feel like mystical
Take it to that gutter level
Get down and dirty with 'em make 'em wrestly with the devil
But they ain't even worth the time sweat or energy
Just learn a listen
On the friend you trust and keep
After yourself to many people got it all wrong
Burning bridges when they should be mended more
He's only at the top 'cause everybody's after you
You gotta watch your back yeah that's what you gotta do
Business and personal shit
Learn how to split well
Too many motherfuckers acting fake
Go to hell
I ain't energy or time to waste on wasted talent
I keep movies straight and forward never ever lose my balance
I keep it poppin
I ain't from Compton (Westside)
I am a heavyweight in the gamesid by having the buds that with no single no we got the whole country stomping
Watch your back
Watch your back
Watch your back motherfucker
'cause I'm coming through the front
And smelling like a shunk
Just ask doctor green
I about the killer kali kush blunts
Realize who your true friends and your enemies are
'cause when the end comes
You get fucked over
You better watch your back dawg

[Chorus]

Times like these
It's getting hard to see
Hope you see your friends now
And whose your enemy
Want to see the end
I guess it all depends
What you call an enemy and
Who you call a friend</pre>
