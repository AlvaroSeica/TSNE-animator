[Opening Skit: Ice-T impersonating Charlie Jam]
Yo, all you niggaz just because you make records and shit
You think you got it going on and shit, you know what I'm saying?  
[SLJ:] Yo, Shut Up, BITCH!!
[Ice-T] Yo, you don't call me no bitch; who the fuck you think you's calling me a bitch? Who the fuck?... 
[SLJ:] Shut the fuck Up, BITCH!!
[Ice-T] Yo, Yo.. 
[SLJ:] Fucking bitch, you..

[Ice-T]
Ha ha ha, yo yo yo baby, yo yo yo don't get mad
Don't get mad, you know what I'm saying?
Let me tell you what real and what a bitch really is..

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I once knew this brother who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
We used to low ride together, shot dice in the bathroom
You want trouble! well, trouble you found
Cause we diss ya, then issue, the critical beat down
He needed money, I would always come through
Needed a car, he could use mine too
But bust this! ~ out on the street people say he was riffing
Calling me a sucker, talking about how foul I'm living
Someone heard him popping that shit last week
Fronting for some pussy from some big butt freak
Saying I'm his worker, I was on his dick!
Talking that crazy old weak ass shit
And after; all of that she still walked away
How you gonna diss your boy to get some play?
And when I stepped to him about it, he said: Who snitched?

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Yo, how did he go out? (He went out like a bitch!)
So ladies we ain't just talking about you
Cause some of you niggaz is bitches too!

[Hook: DJ Aladdin scratching quotes below X4]
You ain't nothing but a BITCH.. Nigga ------&gt; Ice Cube
Some of you niggaz are bitches too ---------&gt; Bushwick Bill

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I knew this brother named Mitch, stone player
He meet a girl, in five minutes he lay her
Trucked crazy jewels, hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse made of thugs and crooks and hoods 
And vet hustlers that were up to no good
But they all stood behind him and watched his back
That's the only way to roll on the track
But yo, Mitch got rushed by feds last week
They snatchbared the trunk of his white Corniche
Took a look inside and what did they see?
Two keys and a gallon of PCP!
Aww shit! they thought crash; Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes that called Habitual criminal
So instead of going under, he snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib and sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew that rat named Mitch

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Yo, how did he go out? (He went out like a bitch!)
So ladies we ain't just talking about you
Cause some of you niggaz is bitches too!

[Hook: DJ Aladdin scratching quotes below X2]
You ain't nothing but a BITCH.. Nigga ------&gt; Ice Cube
Some of you niggaz are bitches too ---------&gt; Bushwick Bill

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I knew this guy that was never that fly
Couldn't act cool even when he tried
When we played rough he always cried
When he told stories he always lied
A Black brother who was missing the cool part
He had the color but was missing the true heart
When we was fight, he would always go down quick
So he took Karate and he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married and he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems that he had in the past
Doesn't like Blacks, claims he is upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets and he's out to jack
Dogging young brothers cause they usually don't fight back
Got a White partner and he asked for that
And every night another head they crack
So now he's big man but he really ain't shit!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Yo, how did he go out? (He went out like a bitch!)
So ladies we ain't just talking about you
Cause a lot of these pigs are bitches too!

[Hook: DJ Aladdin scratching quotes below X2]
You ain't nothing but a BITCH.. Nigga ------&gt; Ice Cube
Some of you niggaz are bitches too ---------&gt; Bushwick Bill

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Out one night with my crew and some new kid
I didn't know homeboy, but Evil-E did
So I thought he was cool, we rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons, lifted side to side
We hit the party deep, niggaz was hawking me
You could feel the vibe of thick artillery
Parliament was on some O.G. shit
I put my back to the wall and felt my pistol grip
All of a sudden, niggaz started tripping
Flipping, the record started skipping
Wilding, fools started locing up
Gats cracked; the room started smoking up
Me and E hit the floor and then the back door
My boys let off an automatic Encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Yo, how did he go out? (He went out like a bitch!)
So ladies we ain't just talking about you
Cause your scary ass niggaz is bitches too!
