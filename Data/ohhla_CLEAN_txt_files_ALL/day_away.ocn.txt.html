[Frank Ocean]
It's 12:07, and I'm thinkin 'bout him (thinkin 'bout him)
Eight minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missin one day
I'm wishin I could forget it
Cause it's still so hard to live with it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hummin to the song playin in my head when I first met you
And I'm lookin through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer, and start breakin the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist; I keep prayin it won't exist no more

[Chorus]
Click-clickin my heels wishin away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday - just not today
Could have been Wednesday - just not today, day
I'm clickin my heels wishin away the day
Wishin the day go away
Day go away, to-day go away

[Frank Ocean]
It's 6:47, still thinkin 'bout him (thinkin 'bout him)
Walkin on 42nd trynna clear my brain no, oh
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sittin here starin at his baggage in my space

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him; even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringin it up
or bringin memory round
Cause ain't no gettin back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more
No water will fall; the storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day~!!
