Typed by: AZ Lyrics

No matter what they say you do
You know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big, they gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you

Now I slide on my back like J.Lo
Heaven on Earth, all I'm missing is a halo
Won't stop 'till I am the greatest on my label
And I'm on G.O.O.D music, that's the greatest of the labels
It's hard trying to build a palace out of labels
19, Got it in early like eggos
Never did anything illegal for a payroll
So without cane I was always able, get it?
You dumb with it if you not able
And life is better with break like mayo
So I was young like "How we gon' get paid, bro?"
Now I'm on Rodeo, fresher than the day, oh you know
And I know the whole world is gonna see me
Mama, do I look better on tv?
I know them haters irritated as an STD
Man, tell them niggas be easy, man be easy

No matter what they say you do
You know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big, they gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you

Man, I be better than whoever
For forever and a year, I put it on mama dear
I love the limelight, shine bright, high beam
19, living out a nigga pipe dream
I'm so legitimate, it would be ignorant
What? If you were not to consider this
From a true lyricist
Unless they hating on a nigga like Jenna 6</pre>
