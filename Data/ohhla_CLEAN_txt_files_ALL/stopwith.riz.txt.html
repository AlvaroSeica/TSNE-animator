[CHORUS]
Stop with the chit chit
Stop with the chatter
RK come through to deal with the matter
People say we're CRAP
People say we're SICK
But I really hope that
We are the latter
Feeling this shit
Then punch the air
We got a bag of ideas never unprepared
To just stop with the chit chit
Stop with the chit chit
Stop with the chit chit chatter

YO! Check me out on the old school drums but the sound ain't frizzled
Old school flow don't be doubting on Rizzle
Smart like Malcolm out of Malcolm in the middle
And my bars are really really smart like a riddle (you diggle)
YEAHH
Living to do this this (yeah)
I'm on a roll
There's no limited movement
WHAT
This is better than a dinner for two
After you've finished a zoot bitch
Think about who's this
(IT'S RIZZ)
Always been that lyrical sort
Kicking in doors
Standards of living are poor
Don't let me meet you're girlfriend
That'll just lead to babies like umbilical chords
I gotta
Nice set of skills rhyme yes I will
Mic general
Speak few lies and I will
Have to go on a mad one
Act dumb
Get a slap son
Won't be pretty when I backhand some, yeah

[CHORUS]

YO!
People are only just getting it
RK coming with the clever shit
Don't give a fuck bruv (celibate)
Your girl gets to your yard like (nine)
Had dinner ready for (eight)
Got to mine like (sevenish)
Fly stuff (Emirates)
Rhyme for the (hell of it)
Man, I'm never gonna find out what (heaven is)
Cause I'm devilish
Try give me Ritalin
Never did a thing now I'm not on medicine
I'm just on some ninja shit
Single kick
Make you leave England BITCH
Until you're lying on a fishing ship
And thinking RIzz is such a prick
Cause I be coming with the
Nice set of skills rhyme yes I will
Mic general
Speak few lies and I will
Have to go on a mad one
Act dumb
Get a slap son
Won't be pretty when I backhand some yeah

[CHORUS]

Yes let me start this off (I)
Won't stop until I've danced a lot (and yes)
Let me start this off (I)
Won't stop until I've danced a lot (yeaah)
I don't lie when I say
We are the ones who'll stay
And will not lose this game
To anyone

I wanna lose stress for a (bit bit)
So I wanna hear less of the (chit chit)
Hear the snare drum step with the (kick kick)
Step with the (kick kick)
Step with the (kick kick)
