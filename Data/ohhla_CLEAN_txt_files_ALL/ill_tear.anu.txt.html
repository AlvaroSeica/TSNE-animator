Song:   I'll Tear You a Heart
Typed by: motionofmomentum@live.com

Fluxing through the vocal channels, hyper density deluxe
Inner space state of mind but mentally i'm stuck
Reciting my visions, incisions so precise
My words paint pictures pigmented to your sight
Fibre-optic, popped and locked it, pick pocket
Punctured mic rocking rotated to eye sockets
I see you but you can't see me 
Cause fresh fires burning, celestial energy
Is harnessed, strapped back like mad max
Ultimate uncanny tore trains to rip tracks
Kick ass to cyber syntax, quick like the flash
Moving steadily through black holes but staying intact
Mad mix, spitting frantic fantastic
Calling autobot ratchet to repair my damage
It's omega, the end all to be all
The smoke laid curtain for the seeds when i blazed an eon

I got nothing to gain and alot less to lose
Till death due us hip hop wears my tennis shoes
Man I'll tear you a heart
I'll tear you a heart
Man I'll tear you a heart

Unique philosophies dug from greek mythology
Ancient hieroglyphic anomolies imbed into the heart of me
Five fractured, five on design, five shines
Like a superimposed sun when a full eclipse aligns 
Times dies, watch the clock, i make it break
Full spectral organism wearing the hide of your face
Cornia corruption crash landed on my earth
Astral-projected my outline all over your turf
Tongued live power outlets just to get a jolt
Drank colts with Campbell while he tightened up my bolts
Stay sharp like the shank that i carved my mic into
Slit dudes when the mood rules makes way to intrude
Killing distinct cats but i wash my hands clean
Blood blisters spill ill, infect sick like hiv
Breaking down the heavens from the incest and deaf
Keep the skies clean while i keep my styles fresh

I got nothing to gain and alot less to lose
Till death due us hip hop wears my tennis shoes
Man I'll tear you a heart
I'll tear you a heart
Man I'll tear you a heart

Anubis, vocal vandalist, wanted anarchist
Stole the planets life force and abandoned it
Divided stars steady, ready heavy machetti
Until the galaxy was decorated with deadly confetti
Designer made chest plate keeping in the passion
Spray can to eight-track, cracking back and maxing
Action uprise, predator deluxe
Uptempo monumental decible level rhythm flux
Incision cuts, aztec temple lacerations
Melted montezuma, ripped his heart out and ate it
Digestive tract gets neglected on the playlist
Galvatron Omega stabbing third eyes into masons
Facing amazing life threatening situations
Eye to eye with Satan, battling mic piece adjacent
Juggernaut on the beat unleashing soundwaves
Devestator rip rhymes, forged vinyl slaving plays
Hyper speed initiate, deep space stone cold
Watching the death star unfold in slow mode
Master in command adds steady current to music
Guardian jiving justice if you hurt or abuse it

I got nothing to gain and alot less to lose
Till death due us hip hop wears my tennis shoes
Man I'll tear you a heart
I'll tear you a heart
Man I'll tear you a heart</pre>
