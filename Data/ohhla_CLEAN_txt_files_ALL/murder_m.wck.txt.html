[Bad Boy]
Yeah
Click One in the motherfuckin' house
Wicked Minds
Lil' Rob
It's murder music

(Verse 1)
[Brown]
Homie, I'm strapped up with the clapper rappin'
That's what happenin'
Get hog tied in the booth for actin'
Exposure for your rhyme book
Funny how you sounded like me
Surrounded with G's, with shaved heads
Locs in them tee's
We smokin' the trees
Click One block
Open in knees
I'm Wicked as Wreck, take two to your neck, fuckin' with these
I walk on water
Literally, niggas ain't feelin' me
Until they see artillery, an infantry die industry

[Lil' Rob]
I remember when we used to play shoot 'em up, BANG BANG
Gangbangin', motherfucker
Our ways to hang you, motherfucker
We the ones chasin' ya
But was never losin' ya
Speeding in the rhamfla
Bumpin' murder musica
Got a brand new nine, double end with hollow tippings
Releasin' heat rocks
Everytime that I pop the clip in
Start duckin'
When I start buckin'
Cause I ain't givin' a fuck when
They're pushin' the wrong buttons, gettin' yourself into somethin'

Chorus: Lil' Rob
It's murder musica
Something you pop your clip into
Murder musica, homeboy, what you gonna do
When us vatos
Come after you
And start shootin' ya
Bumpin' murder musica, fuck you
It's murder musica
Something you pop your clip into
Murder musica, homeboy, what you gonna do
When us vatos
Come after you
And start shootin' ya
Bumpin' murder musica

(Verse 2)
[Wreck]
Puerto Rican with a bad attitude
6'2", 240, so don't make me act a fool
I'll be
Droppin' fools if they disrespect
And if you cross my path, then I
You get a Wreck
Got a wicked ass mind down to do the crime
And if you owe this nigga money, then you runnin' out of time
Te represento
A diez y ocho de sur
De Los Angeles
Romero, tell 'em the rest

[Romero]
Don't make me have to pull my
Motherfuckin' mack out (Mack out)
I'm blowin' motherfucker's
Backs out (Backs out)
You best to duck when you hear that sound (BUCK, BUCK)
I'm comin'
I'm runnin'
Make murder musica
Shoot up your car, gives a fuck who you are
Don't fuck with the R to the O, you should already know
And if wanna go to war, my whole army would go
We brown with rage, roll around with .80 rounds in the kay
To tear you to pieces
Fuck it, I'll just bury you, breezy

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Chino Grande]
I got murder on my mind, plus two holes in my clip
I pull a W-H-I-Double T-I-E-R buis'
We making daily contemplating over (???) your throats
You motherfuckers tryin' to look me up the way when I'm dumpin'
Fuck with something
Ese, better know what we do
Just play your grinds in firme, and it'll go all smooth
I slang dope to survive, tried to open your eyes
Hop back and spit
Cock back and die

[Bad Boy]
Homie, I pop pills and guns on the daily basis
Approachin' motherfuckers with those paly faces
The case is
I been on the flame impatient
Fuck a DJ
Don't let me get to name the stations
So play my shit, fag
I'll hold you for ransom
I rock shit like coke and grip mics like angus
So speak and get stole on, fag
My flight flew
It's proven to leave
Rappers in graves, it's murder music

[Lil' Rob]
It's murder musica
Something you pop your clip into
Murder musica, homeboy, what you gonna do
When us vatos
Come after you
And start shootin' ya
Bumpin' murder musica</pre>
