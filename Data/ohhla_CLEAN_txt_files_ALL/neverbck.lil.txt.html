Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a say for this pink flame
You know I'm keepin this shit got it for real
I'm keepin this shit straight from the line
I ain't lying about shit you feel me, yes, yeah
You know I love the hood for life
Man you know I'm thugging for life
Man real niggas fucking with me
You already know what it is man
Shit outspoken man, real niggas come through
They salute, you feel me, it's your boy lil b, yeah

I'm a keep it real, I'm spitting straight facts
I really love the hood, but I'm never coming back
I'm a keep it real, I'm spitting straight facts
I really love the hood, but I'm never coming back

Niggas real fly, used to be a catterpillar
Till he turned cat pillar, close the casket quicker
He was holding on the mac, niggas holding gaps
With you, tryina get cash quicker than like the last nigga
Got you killed like the last nigga
Dumped the last for sure, only crack air
I ain't that many niggas, what it do my brother
You know I'm fuckin with you
But I gotta get my shit together
Niggas see me in the screen
But don't see me in life
Had to fuck upon keys, I had to buy us some life
When niggas see me on the block, I post up with ice
So a nigga just tryina keep his fucking lights
Real talk, low key, take advice,
So the game straight niggas like a python
Lil kid died, for keepin on his shoes
Sellin bad deals, I'm fuckin overdue
This lil b, feel me
This from the heart man, you feel me?
It's all for my real niggas
This from the heart man, fuck with me

I'm a keep it real, I'm spitting straight facts
I really love the hood, but I'm never coming back

Dudes sake, now it's over dude
Whole hood got drugs like hoe food
I've been dealing with life like most dudes
Circling in to the patterns of the court room
Gotta open up my guest room
Gotta open up my eyes just to get room
Niggas don't understand, they just let loose
Gotta think about the whole game, they building it bad
One come out, the next one in
It's a cycle you can't stop, you just got to live
The ones that don't understand, I just pray for them
Sometimes I feel like the game wasn't made for them
The hood might have judged, I ain't hatin on em
Niggas left me on the hood and rollerskated on me
Niggas mad when I take a vacation homie
Please don't be mad when I say shit brain homie
It's lil boss, I don't give a fuck, you feel me
I'm never going back
You know the hood marry me, you feel me
That's why niggas lookin at me crazy
I really love the hood, I'm spittin straight facts
Feel me, but I'm never coming back
Lost too many of them
I lost too many in numbers, I think I had enough</pre>
