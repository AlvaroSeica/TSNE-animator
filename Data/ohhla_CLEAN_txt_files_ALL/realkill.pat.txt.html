(Intro)
...How the fuck you gon sit around here, we both doin the same god damn thang
You get caught up, and then I'm free, and then you wanna burn me
Send me to hell, ya know what I'm sayin?

(Chorus)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Let them burners talk; Blow your ass off
When it's beef, I'm pullin down on a nigga
In these streets, I'm pullin down on a nigga
If I find you, I'm pullin down on ya nigga
Pull them burners out and empty rounds on a nigga

(Verse 1)
Homicide for the cash
40 Glock in the stash
SK; No mask
Trash bags full of cash
Kickin doors, murda hoes
Bullet holes in ya clothes
Body left on the floor
Get the dope and serve them hoes
From the grams to the pounds
Hustler gon' put it down
Shootin off plenty rounds
Locate to another town
With the sack, with the gun
In the street, it ain't no fun
Convicted felon
With my hand on the gun
Fingers on the hair trigger
Swag of a drug dealer
Student pigeons bumpin gums
Whole cookin to the crumbs
Served out of Motel 6
A hustla know that that's the lic
Cocaine hard, you get caught
That's a charge that'll stiiick (That'll stiiick)

(Chorus)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Let them burners talk; Blow your ass off
When it's beef, I'm pullin down on a nigga
In these streets, I'm pullin down on a nigga
If I find you, I'm pullin down on ya nigga
Pull them burners out and empty rounds on a nigga

(Verse 2)
If you ain't with this street shit, stay your ass on the porch (Ho!)
Cause when it comes to beef shit, niggas do get torched (That chopper!)
I'll smoke a nigga, like a kush blunt (Mmm!)
Blow your brains; Back of your head, straight to the front (Some knowledge!)
A nigga know just what it is with me
Don't need no niggas with me, that burner gon' stay with me (Uh huh!)
So if you want to let your niggas send you out
Watch this throw-away-nine leave you stretched out (All day)
I pull down on my ennn-emies, bare-faced
I'm the last face he see before he get erased (A murda!)
I say, that chopper; It always got a beef taste (B-l-l-l-l-ap)
No body-shots my dog; I'm aiming at your face (Yo dome!)

(Chorus)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Real killas don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk)
Let them burners talk; Blow your ass off
When it's beef, I'm pullin down on a nigga
In these streets, I'm pullin down on a nigga
If I find you, I'm pullin down on ya nigga
Pull them burners out and empty rounds on a nigga</pre>
