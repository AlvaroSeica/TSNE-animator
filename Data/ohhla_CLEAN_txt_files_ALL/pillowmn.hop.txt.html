Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hopsin]
I've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft
Tryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash
But all my nerves have just crashed, cause all the verses I've trashed
Were meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has
I rarely ever put somethin out to insert in your dash
Cuz as soon as I became a brand my own purpose was smashed
I'm feelin nervous in fact, I got no urges to rap
I don't think my fuckin life can get more worthless than that
I see these niggaz blowin up, who never do got the proper game
Niggaz who fuckin suck, Gucci and Wacka Flocka Flame
Niggaz who makin bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane
Cuz I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga and rob his chain
Dang! I thought I had it figured out
See I panic and I pout, yo I've had it man, I'm out
God damn it, this shit's a clout
I'm the baddest thin no doubt
But my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout

[Chorus]
How come the world is always quit to turn a back on me
Won't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream

[Hopsin]
Lawless or I'm evil but actually I'm so nice
I've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life
Unhappy here with no wife, don't ask me I don't know why
I'm livin life without no type of strategy to go by
I knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts
A bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park
A bitch who was makin out with up in the graveyard
The same bitch who wouldn't whoop my ass with a slayed heart
She cut it like an avocado, secretly hittin clubs and poppin bottles
Hangin with thugs or suckin a lots of cock yo
The biggest slut from Loveland Colorado
Fuck a ho that's Hopsin's motto my heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow
She met another guy who left the baby stuck inside
Her vagina then he just split and messed up her fuckin life
Now she hits me up a lot
She says to go suck a nut, goodbye
All you sluts can die for wastin all my sacred love supply

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
To live a decent life what all is it take
I tried and try to be the best but nothin falls in the place
And I'm a man but my struggle is gonna cause me to break
And just involve me to hate I'm in a nauseous state
And shit it probably is fake but who's in control of it me or god
Is he the cause of why am I here the reason's odd
I'm broke and need a job, for spendin cheese on broads
But y'all don't see the flaws I code it up to keep it raw
And mc's who's got the most talent in this whole planet
Don't never get recognized when they dope at it
So they go back to the block hustlin and dope addicts
Some niggaz got the effect and some niggaz don't have it
Yo I'm at my last tears cause everytime I think I'm not the matrix
I get some bite back end
But man I'm hopin things are change and the soul in me remains
Cuz the talent that I've got is way too cold to be contained

[Bridge]
No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose
No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose

[Chorus]</pre>
