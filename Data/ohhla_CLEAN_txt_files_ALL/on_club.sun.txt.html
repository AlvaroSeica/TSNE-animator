[ VERSE 1 ]
Live from the mind, just in time
House is house, kick it out, here's the club rhyme
I create like this for you to rate
At parties state to state, you couldn't wait
To hear the up-to-date King Sun the great
Gifted to lift the club like weight
For this you insist to move but just listen
Here's a opening to see who I'm dissin
Why should I would I could I play myself?
Not in a lifetime - if I was somebody else
Even then I couldn't be played
Nor slayed, decayed, half-made or underpaid
I'm not braggin, the dragon breathes fire
You only came cause I was on the flyer
Hollywood made it fully equipped
For King Sun to have a little bit of fun on the club tip

Everybody
(Work yo body)  --&gt; Hot Streak
Todo mundo
(Work yo body)

[ VERSE 2 ]
From the poet of love to narrator of club
What they be kickin is old, check out the brand new dub
Tracks assist the attack and the King is back
And just when you thought it wouldn't happen - whack
Makin a song to carry along, the lyrics are strong
Please correct me if I'm wrong
But I'm the righteous deliver of lessons
Blessin ears when I nice up the session
I make cream for this while you fiend for this
And yet Profile Records didn't mean for this
To be a hit, I make 'em legit
And when I'm finished with this competition won't exist
To endure you must be allured on the floor
And if it's that good, baby, beg for more
The more the better, the hype will make you hip
Girls'll flip and thirst for a sip on the club tip

[ BREAK ]
You can stay in the house if you want but I'm goin out to the club
Puedes quedar en la casa se quiero pero yo voy a bailar
You can stay in the house if you want but I'm goin out to the club
Vous pouvez rester à la maison ( ? ), moi je vais à club
Three different languages to convince you
English, Spanish, even French too
All agreed upon a dope club mix
Drop out all the rest and let the bassline kick

[ VERSE 3 ]
Continue in step, the club slept
I disappeared for years and returned for those who wept
Tears of missin me, thoughts of kissin me
And if you ever even think about dissin me
You better know how to roll and maintain control
And when it's time to fold you owe me your soul
Not another MC but I roll with RUSH
I'm gettin paid with Lyor, plus
My brother M the a-r-x in effect
Playin the ( ? )
Gettin back to the Hollywood track
In fact it's too hype for some of you to know that
In conclusion, the club/rap fusion
Rocks the house cause house is an illusion
Gimme the club and watch it flip
Right before your eyes, then you realize that you're on the club tip</pre>
