And I wanna smoke...
Red rum animosity
and I wanna chief...
I wanna smoke...
and we gonna do it like this

[Gangsta Pat]
I gotta hunger for that chronic flow through my chest
I need it daily and I'm jumpy without no sess
I like that lime green wrapped up tightly in a blunt
And whenever there's  a drought I'm steady on a hunt
I hit my hood feelin good I done found a sack
I get a pint of yak and party till' I'm layed back
Call up my click and have a smoke out it's on again
I chased that bud with that yak and let it do me in
If it's a sin then I hope the lord will understand
I gotta chief until I choke cause that's my daily plain
Cause I'm that all-mighty chiefer ain't nothin sweeter
than the smell of skunk infested reefer, I'ma believer
I gots to be the first to light it up and take a pull
Steadily inhalin all I can makin my lungs full
I got to pass it when I choke that luv ain't no joke
It's hard to cope without that aink
cause I just gots to smoke!...

(chorus:girl rp2x)
and I wanna smoke (I wanna smoke)
and I wanna smoke (I wanna smoke)
I wanna chief
and I wanna smoke (I wanna smoke)
and I wanna smoke

[Gangsta Pat]
That can of Mrs. Chiefer gives me that vibe
of the tribe, I'm the head chiefer
I love that reefer in my system, it relieves my pain
And I'm aware that it's doin damage to my brain
But I don't care, I like chillin wit my eyes redd
Wit chronic leaves steadily dancin all around my head
I got the munchies &amp; I'm tripin off of everything I see
High as I kite steadily rollin up a swisher sweet
Sack after sack, I'm chiefin back to back
Remove them seeds, I constantly be havin aink attack
Cause it's a need, I can't help it I'm a fiend in love
Hooked on that aink and I be floatin to the skies above
Smokin blink it helps me think, it helps me feel at ease
It keeps me calm I be spendin almost all my cheese
I need that bomb in my chest I love that cess
It ain't no joke I can't cope unless I got that dope
I wanna smoke!...

(chorus:girl rp2x)

[Gangsta Pat]
I like to smoke my endo and get so high
I blow weed like I'm going crazy don't ask me why
I can't explain it, I'm so addicted
I'm deep in love wit that chronic it keeps me wicked
I'm hooked on bud, I be fiendin every time I'm sober
About to die I be lovin when my g's come over
And get me high as a mink coat
Just let the aink float through the sky
When I be smokin I can feel my throat gettin dry
I can't deny I got plenty problems
But only swishers and a fat sack can help me solve 'em
I ain't the one to be without that all-might gaunja
It ain't no solitary doubt that I must feed my hunger
Like Stevie Wonder I can't see into another day
Espicially if I gotta face that day without no hay
It ain't no way I gots to have it that's on the real
That ain't no joke so fry it up 
And pass it through the field I wanna smoke
