[ Sugar Kay ]
Aah yeah, Kings of Swing in the house
Sugar Kay and Mike Master just taxin
We got Cocoa Chanelle on the 1 and 2
So Cocoa, what you wanna do?
[ DJ Cocoa Chanelle ]
Yo, I'm goin solo
(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Show em) (show em whatcha got)

[ VERSE 1: DJ Cocoa Chanelle ]
I'm always ready to go
To a tempo that's fast or slow
Cause when I flow, I take the show solo
So if you didn't know, my name is Cocoa
I'm a deejay, but I can emcee up also
A cut creator, MC originator
The crowd persuader when I'm rhymin like the crossfader
They say I'm greater, cause my style is unique
I take the mic for a while, then I proceed to the Technics
I write my own rhymes, usin no other lines
And each and every time you find that I get mine
The style I portray as deejay is here to stay
You hear my cuts in the records you play
And then you say, "(Damn) this girl must be a star"
Don't try to battle (why baby?) cause I smoke you like a cigar
You're huffin and puffin like a cigarette smoker
Cause I'm a queen, and you're just a joker
I don't joke, I'm not a game like Genesis
Don't try to play me, cause you don't want none of this
Never known to be a sucker rapper
So when you see me comin, you better step like a capper
Out of the way, because I'm in command
It's not a scam, it's the masterplan
If you don't believe the hype, it ain't hype, so
You want a demonstration? Come to the show

(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Kings of Swing in full effect)
(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Show em) (show em whatcha got)

[ VERSE 2: DJ Cocoa Chanelle ]
I'm quick on the mix, my cuts are short and divine
I backspin behind my back, cross my arms, and the whole nine
Amuse you like a playground
Spin like a merry-go-round
I use the fader like a see-saw, up and down
I'm here now with the Audio 2
Just one of those things that make you say (oooh..)
A combination that's dope, as slick as smooth like soap
Now is there hope for a sucker to cope? I have to say (nope)
You wanna know why? I tell you in a minute
In fact, give me a second, I'm about to get in it
Cause I got the time, if you got the patience
I rocked rhymes for hours on several occasions
By lookin at me you think I'm just another average female
Because I'm very quiet and sweet, you could never tell
That I'm like a bomb on the mic, ready to ignite
Then get the crowd hype, cause I'm that type
In a battle, at a party or a show (yo) I get mellow
And rock to a beat or acapella
But never takin lyrics from another MC
Because I feel as a artist you should show originality
And I'm original as you can't get
I bet your hoe paid check that I can make you sweat
And yet you will regret, cause it's a debt I collect
I'm in effect, I go with the flow, you know, so

(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Kings of Swing in full effect)
(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Show em) (show em whatcha got)
(Show em) (show em whatcha got)
(Show em) (show em whatcha got)
(Show em) (show em whatcha got)

[ VERSE 3: DJ Cocoa Chanelle ]
I never slack or lack, cause in fact I'm a veteran
Each and every day of the year I get better in
Any style I choose to pursue, if I put my mind to
I could do and leave you without a clue
As to how to make a rhyme sound nice and get a cut precise
You wanna dis? Think twice is my advice
Cause I'm not a average female, I rate myself higher
Suckers might dis but underneath they admire
Cause I'm versatile, never usin one style
Yo, I'm a deejay, a MC, you name it, it's in my file
I hold the microphone with a grip
As my rhymes start to rip
You get busy on the Cocao tip
But don't forget, I'm the deejay
Cut the funky scratch for everything that the Kings say
Mike Master and Sugar Kay
And I can't forget my brother Dre
He's DJ Show &amp; Tell, we watch each other's backs
We both paid our dues, now we're spinnin on wax
He's down with MC Peaches and I swing with the Kings
We're gettin busy, cause it's a First Priority thing

(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Kings of Swing in full effect)
(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beat)
And goin solo
(Kings of Swing in full effect)</pre>
