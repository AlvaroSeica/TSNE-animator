[Intro - Raheem DeVaughn] (Skillz)
Call me (S-K-I)
Call me (double L, Z)
Crazy (yeah)
Woo, call me crazy baby

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
Uh, I'm diggin the whole steeze yo
Cool as a summer breeze flow
She said she had a man, I should be slow
I said you also got feet, so you could leave yo
She just laughed like I can see that
It's called humor, you might need that
Your man? I don't know where he at
But if you ain't happy than maybe you should be that
I've been (I've been), thinkin that maybe, we can (we can)
Go somewhere and just sit (sit), then (then)
Talk about bein friends
Talk about how you've been
Talk about how you a ten
And talk about how we gonna win
Since this is all startin to sink in
Maybe I should tell you what I've been thinkin

[Chorus - Skillz] (Raheem DeVaughn) - w/ ad libs
Uh, I was thinkin just maybe (maybe)
I could call you my baby (baby)
Or call you my lady (lady)
I know I'm trippin, you could call me crazy
(Call me), you could call me crazy
(Call me), you could call me (crazy)
No ifs, ands or maybes
I know I'm trippin, you could call me crazy

[Verse 2 - Skillz]
I'm just tryin to take it slow (take it slow)
And let you in on things that you should know (you should know)
Like your beauty grows
You look better than you did ten minutes ago, whoa
If that's the first time ya heard that (heard that)
It's the truth, I second and third that
I'm tryin to have your heart where the birds at
It's called a smile, baby you deserve that
I just wanna be in your world
Here's some advice - you go girl
Now you can let that sink in
While I tell you what I've been thinkin

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Skillz]
Uh, just don't get scared (get scared)
They say a closed mouth don't get fed (get fed)
So it's up to us to change it
If you can picture that, I can damn sho' frame it (uh)
They say love can be dangerous
But I don't think so if you're speakin the same language
Mmm, you're nothin less than fine
You never have to guess what's on my mind
Girl, I've been (I've been), thinkin that maybe, we can (we can)
Go somewhere and just sit (sit), then (then)
Talk about bein friends
Talk about where you've been
Talk about how you a ten
Talk about how we gonna win
It's all startin to sink in
Maybe I should tell you what I've been thinkin, uh

[Chorus] - 2X - w/ ad libs until the end</pre>
