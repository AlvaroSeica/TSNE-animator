(chorus)
I sold me a half nigga 
Now, I'm gon to get a bundle a bundle a bundle

Just give me some heroin 
I need it in my life 
Nigga I'm reachin bad 
For that undertaker let me get before I get mad
That straight up powder got me fucked up
Duckin now I'm fucked up
I need some dope that fire brown stuff
Open the bag and let me get mine
Some of that Mexican Mudd, before I buzz
Pass my straw so I can get high
Me I feel like I can flizy 
I don't know the reason why 
I feel like I can never ever die
That cocaine powder be havin me bailin
Cause ain't no white dope, no white coke 
Gon be better than that inhailin
I'm sellin quarters just to get some
Some of that gangsta dope 
Go down my throat
And have buckin like I'm gon nuts
I'm goin by my old lady shes bitchin
I'm diggin in my pants itchin 
Bout to come down with that gangsta sickness
Fuck dis I'm bout to get my swerve on 
Swerve on bout a G and get that dope so I can calm my nerves
He was chillin on the phizone 
Talkin to my boy Ron
Buckin like a buck off that heroin
