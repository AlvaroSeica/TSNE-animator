HIV, AIDS, some may say
It started from the blacks, and get it from the gays
Ebola virus, smells kinda funky
Somebody said you get it from a monkey
Big Brother, got me smothered
Puttin up one, they puttin up anotherrrrrr
Camera in my neighborhood
Camera in my neighborhood
Heroin, Cocaine, even that beef can eat up your brain
Steroids, asteroids..

Ab-flex, buns of steel, silicone titties, ain't nothin real
A girl ain't just a Barbie doll
A girl ain't just a Barbie doll
Hennessey, Cognac, get so drunk break my sacroiliac
Membrane, migraine, moves in my bloodstream, spend up your brain
Damn it's hard to maintain..
Damn it's hard to maintain..
Damn it's hard to maintain..
Damn it's hard to maintain..
Damn it's hard to maintain..

[Chorus]
In America today
*In America today*
I have to regret to say
*I have to regret to say*
Somethin Somethin is not right
*Somethin Somethin is not right*
Got no vision to your sight
*Got no vision to your sight*
Tell me people, can't you see
On the screens and on TV
Dealing propaganda, uh huh
Telling lies to you, uh huh
Do you like it? Uh huh
Do you want it? Uh huh
Really want it? Uh huh
Think you need it, uh huh

HIV, AIDS, some may say
Made in a lab in the USA
Ebola virus, smells kinda funky
Somebody said you get it from a monkey
Big Brother, got me smothered
Puttin up one, they puttin up anotherrrrrr
Camera in my neighborhood

[Chorus]</pre>
