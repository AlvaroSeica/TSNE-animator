[Intro: Celph Titled]
I can't do it right now cause my grandma's asleep in the other room

Scoop Deville
You're now rockin with a drunken battle, we pack pumps
Like sluts when they travelin - Scoop Deville
You're now rockin with a drunken battle, we pack pumps
Like sluts (Fort Minor) Scoop Deville

You're now rockin with a drunken battle, we pack pumps
Like sluts when they travelin with shoes in the trunk
I'm losin it punk, missin a few screws and a nut
I'm stupid as fuck, I'm from the old school but I flunked
Black on black, rips with some grain to grip
Bitch-slappin these trick rappers 'til they pay this pimp
Quit actin the click-clackin like you famous, shit
You faggots are broke with names out of gangsta flicks (biatch)
What a joke, you ain't never cut up coke on a scale
or snuck dope through the border in a coconut shell
Fuck no! You wanna tell your little veteran tales
So when I put the smoke in your mouth you better inhale
Suck it!

[Tak]
You ready? Let's get it, the game's now finished
It's all weapons to aim with a thousand rounds in it
Machine Shop class mixtape lynchmen
Clappin at you track rabbits back to the benches
Yeah, people fiend this, call me the evil genius (uhh)
Got 'em bumpin Styles in the Buick Regal speedin
People fiend this, call me the evil genius (uhh)
.. fiend this, call me the evil genius (uhh)
Got 'em bumpin Styles in the Buick Regal speedin
Brim with a tilt, cigar on my clutch
Your cryin over spilled milk, Demigodz what's up?
Got a flask filled of that ol' lucky number 7 brand
Get rid of your first string, I ain't playin second-hand
You messin with butane, get scorched in a torch fire
Look out for the new slang, you rockin with Fort Minor

[Interlude: Celph Titled]
All right hold on a second
Yeah, yeah yeah, you know what the fuck it is
S.O.B. muh'fuckers, Demigodz muh'fuckers
Mike Shinoda muh'fuckers, and this is Celph Titled muh'fuckers
We put a pipe bomb in your tailpipe, no homo muh'fuckers
My gun don't fit through the doorway muh'fuckers let's go

[Mike Shinoda]
This is the last warnin shot 'fore we're lettin this go
We don't have to say lay low, y'all already know
that when the lights goes dim and the beat drops in
Even Texas can't +Hold 'Em+, ante up and I'm in
I'm like Black Jack Johnson and M.O.P.
Drinkin handfuls of Jack Daniels, you'll see
Cause when we hop in the Jeep to try out the CD
You'll want a lowrider buckin bronco to Scoop's beat
Now, my name's Mike (Mike) remember it well
More rock than raising hell, rougher then Rock the Bells
Ryu and Tak'll tell you what's really the deal
If you want it come get us at the end of this 12, ha!

[Outro: Celph Titled]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, you know the fuckin drill
Keepin it Godzilla up in the motherfuckin Home Depot
This is Celph Titled, the lame mile killer
This is S.O.B., this is Demigodz
This is M. Shinoda the cobra holder
And this is your brain on crack muh'fucker

{"Perfect... the guy is a genius"}</pre>
