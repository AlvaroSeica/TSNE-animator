Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain, wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming...

[Diddy]
I'm back where I belong
Yeah, I never felt so strong and (I'm back baby)
I'm feelin like there's nothin that I can't try-yyy
And if you with me put your hands high-yyy (put your hands high)
If you ever lost a life before (hey) this one's for you
(And if you hear me put your hands high-yyy)
Your dreams are fulfilled, you rockin with the best (yeah, hey)
I'll be on tour

I hear "The Tears of a Clown," uhh - I hate that song!
I feel like they talkin to me, when it comes on
Another day, another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry they mom?
(Why? Damn!) How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit~! But I ain't finished growin
Another night, the inevitible prolongs
Another day, another Dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

[Chorus: Dirty Money + Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain, wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming... home

[Diddy]
Aiyyo, check this out
"A House Is Not a Home," I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone?
And niggaz got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it, or conceal it
But you deal with it, and you keep ballin
Pour out some liquor play ball yeah we keep ballin
Baby we've been livin in sin
cause we've been really in love but we've been livin as friends
(Yeahhh!) So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up the phone, c'mon!!

[Chorus]

[Diddy]
Thank you! I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I almost home
Check this out
"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now," I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'til we back cruisin through Harlem, Viso blocks
is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me, forgave me
for all of my shortcomings - welcome to my homecoming
Yeah! It's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles, lot of cars
Lot of ups, lot of downs, made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big)
But here I stand, a better man! (Don't stop)
Thank you Lord

[Chorus]

[Diddy - over Chorus]
I'm coming home
Feels so good, feels so free!
Ain't no place like home baby
Ain't no place like home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world, I'm coming home</pre>
