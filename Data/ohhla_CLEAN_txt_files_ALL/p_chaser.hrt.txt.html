Song:   Paper Chaser
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Mr. Prezident]
I'm a paper chaser, we get that dough
I'm straight on the block like tic-tac-toe
I'm a paper chaser, all my G's ride
We live, 24/7, 365

[Mr. Prezident]
What you think we scramble for, you in the streets better handle yours
I'm in the Benz wit the Lambo' doors
I ain't got to do much, I just press the key
And the doors look like arms on the referee
When the field goal good, I can still go wood
And get gwop on the block cuz I'm still so hood
My life like a motion picture, of the coldest winter
For that bread them toasters split ya
Me, I don't play ya'll, double check up my radar
Like Malcolm at the window in the picture with the 8-R
I don't slack, slip or take a day off
Look I'm balling like Kobe in the playoffs
I keep an eye on my mind, other eye on my plans
After that, supply and demand
It's like I got cheddar disease, I need cheddar to breath
Prezy the Don, who better than me?

[Chorus 2X]

[Fes Taylor]
Listen, see I pull up cars, ain't doing pull-up bars
I'm like Jamaican stars, I'm yelling 'pull up, pull up'
Life ain't promised so I escape to Saint Thomas
Maybe Bahamas, find a new baby mama
Lazy, the ganja, got me wanna cool out
Living like I'm lost in the maze, I took a new route
Honey's they see the ways and ways and knew about
New York clout, still cool in the south
Ouch, hurt a hater's feelings, when I worth my appearance
When you shop, you only copping on clearance
Staring, Soopafly ain't got shit on 2-Fly
The roof recline, I reach for the blue sky
I already told you, I'm like Luke Sky'
Two live, over raw they know me as a cool guy
New rides, crews buy, oh, it's money round here
I be right back with a few pies

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
