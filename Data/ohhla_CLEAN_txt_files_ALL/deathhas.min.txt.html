Song:   Death Has Died
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It was just last week that my grandma died
It's been years since I've seen family on my fathers side
A bitter sweet, moment but tell me why
Nothing less then the sting of death brought us together
I sat and listened to the priest tell lies
To appease loved ones in their seats
When you looking at a face that's weaping
The grim truth wont bring'em no peace
So I put on, all white gloves like Mr. Jackson
Carried the casket to the Cadillac then
I realised this is the first time that me and my brothers ever did something together
Whatever, I'm grown now come on let's just put on the smiles
And take pictures, take pictures
Uh
Eat this humble pie then leave them dishes
For somebody else to clean 'em until I see ya'll again

(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Br-br-Breakin' down, breakin' down)
It's all breaking down down down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
But this wont be forever no

You used to make me cry
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died

But until that day
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh,
This won't be for ever

I hopped off the plane
My God, what a scene that I seen on that TV screen
People huddled round, hands on they mouth
Not again, same problem, it hit a new town
26 dead, 20 of 'em kids
Where do you begin when some lives just ended?
And everybody got the question:
If God's so good how He let this happen?
Is it mental health? Is it gun control?
Is it we make superstars out of animals?
Is it the movies we make? The video games?
I dunno, but God I want an antidote
All I know is this world is broken
Our sin is the reason it ain't like it's supposed to
Words fall short tryna comfort the grieving
But you gotta know that there's hope to believe in
One day my God gon' crack the sky
He gon' bottle up every tear that we ever cried
Bring truth to every lie, justice for ever crime
All our shame will be gone and we'll never have to hide
No more broken hearts, no more broken homes
No more lockin' doors, no more cops patrollin'
No abusive words, or abusive touches
No more cancerous cells that'll take our loved ones
No more hungry kids, no more natual disaster
No child will ever have to ask where his dad is
No funerals where we wear all black
And death will be dead and we'll lock the casket
Yes!

You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right (all things right)
And we'll sing death has died
But until that day
You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died

But until that day
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh,
This won't be forever</pre>
