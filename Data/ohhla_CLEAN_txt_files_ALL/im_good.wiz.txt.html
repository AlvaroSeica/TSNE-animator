[Verse 1]
Yeaa
I'm G - O - O... D Ya Feel Me?
Yea
Fresh fit new chucks (new chucks)
I swear I feel like a million bucks (million bucks)
And dem leather seats feel like plush (uh-huh)
4 twelves make my shit go bump (go bump)
20 carrots got your bitch goin nuts
Livin like a star so dey get so struck
Far as rap got dis shit sowed up
Ridin by myself couple sticks rolled up
Yeaaaa
On dese frames I done spent so much
Niggas wanna nip so the fo fifth on tuck
And jus look don't touch
I know you don't see dis usually but excuse me dese gucci
Got a future so bright u'll see
Man I'm dis young why is life so sweet
In my shoes yea dey might wanna be
Da cameras right here and the lights on me
Let's Go

[Chorus]
I'm good
Livin jus the way I should
Most niggas ain't think I could
Look homie I'm good
Doin wat I said I would
You try but to me it ain't nun to it
Cause lil homie I'm good
Most niggas ain't think I could
But I'm livin jus the way I should
Yea homie I'm good
Yea I'm good
Yea I'm good
Yea I'm good

[Verse 2]
Yea
More cars more clothes
Get money dats the life I chose
Chase money nigga why chase hoes
Dey ain't even want me till my neck got froze
And the price got told
Stories by trips in the nice sized homes
It's a game play the life I kno
On the winnin end wen the dice got rolled
Yea
Tall nigga so my flights got room
Small nigga so I always got goons
Say you get a lil cash dats cool
I prolly spent more than dat on tattoos
I got the formula ya need to find
My city on lock and the keys are mine
So you can gon keep ya piece of mind cause I'm G to O's and a D with mine
Let's Go

[Chorus]</pre>
