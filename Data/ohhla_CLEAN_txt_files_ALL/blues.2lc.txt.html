Verse One: Brother Marquis

I bring home the bacon
Bitch I put it in your hand
But behind my back bitch
You been seen with another man
Oh I just had to shed a tear
Bitch you got to leave here
Is it me or him baby?
So long my motherfuckin' dear

Verse Two: Luke Skywalker

Come lay your black ass down
Right beside me
Hold onto my dick
While I grab a little bit of that pussy
Suck it right
Bitch suck it all night
And if you ask me to eat some pussy
I choke your black ass all night

Verse Three: Fresh Kid Ice

Since my baby left me
I been doin' well on my own
Fucked the neighbour's wife
And broke up a happy home
Now the bitch wanna live with me
This long dick Chinese
Bitch if you can't fry rice
Well get your bald-head ass out tonight

Verse Four: Mr. Mixx

I met this raggedy bitch
Down on southwest eighth street
I fuck that bitch from the top of her head
To the bunyons on her motherfuckin' feet
I said Bitch as long as your pussy is
It's a goddamn sin
I gotta hold an ironing board across your chest
To keep from fallin' in</pre>
