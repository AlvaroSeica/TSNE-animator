Somebody told me, that the only way that I can make it is if I lead
'cause I can never follow, it's the day before tomorrow that's the only thing that I see
I can't stop until I reach the top, I know that's where I'll be
My heart and my mind
It's all in with the flow and the rhymes
And the days I did crime
and I swear in time
You'll feel my world so cold
You'll hear you'll see you'll know
You'll know it comes from my
You'll know it comes from my
You'll know it comes from my

Soul!

Chorus

My heart, my mind, my goals, my dream my story I told
My life, my times, my flow, my rhymes, my music is from
My soul

Verse 1

I heard somebody say "I hate rap music!"
'cause all we talk about is our guns and our cars and our money and our broads
and how wack dudes be and how nice we are
and how much sÂ–t we sold and how we so damn hard
and we throwing up signs and we stay reppin' our squads
we exaggerate, it's aggravating, this is from my heart I
got a flow that is purer than God
These dudes flowin' like security guards
And I aint dissin' your job
But when I do this, there's a different motivation
There's diseases goin' round, fuck a record in rotation
There's people, that be taking life for granted, they're complacent
And there's rappers with no talent, kicking verses in my face
But if you look at them and look at me, my shit is hi-def
for me to like they shit I'd have to be high and deaf

Chorus

Verse 2

I got songs telling people that I'm better than the best
am I the reason that you hate rap music? I say yes
I'm a, pistol promoter, hustled powder and soda for a dollar
right after college, someone should have been told you
that I was comin', comin' with somethin'
so movin', music that touches
your soul, so crazy like the birth of a son
from the earth to the sun is the distance between me and these clowns that flowing
y'all call 'em up and coming I call 'em down and going
I'm the difference between doubting and knowing
believing and seeing, I been broke, but never been broken
you hate rap guys, rap dudes, hippity hip bop
shoot, clap and spit shots, when will this shit stop God?
I'm such a part of it, it sickens me, I'm weak
I mean for real I got a fucking stomach ache as we speak
And I think I feel a fever, "if you hate it Sha then why don't you leave?"
I can't go, I can't chill, it's my temperature get it? I'm too hot
I'm New York, new Big, new Pac
new Kane, new nah, new Sha old dog, new tricks
new flows, new kicks every day, a new chick
"you sick" I know I told you I'm sweatin' my health
is getting' worse it's 'cause I'm sweatin' myself
I should write these rhymes on tablets
like commandments in Hebrew language
'cause y'all don't understand it anyway man
