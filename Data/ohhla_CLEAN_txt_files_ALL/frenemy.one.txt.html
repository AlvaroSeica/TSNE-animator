Album:  The Landmark
Song:   Recognize Your Frenemies
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus 2X: Awol One]
Recognize your frenemies
and they will find their space and time

[Awol One]
Feel the same way, leave me alone
Shifters in that Twilight Zone
I'm so now, to motherfuckin real time
Slip to slide and step to Lucille time
The heels you ride on, the flings you fly on
The sound of 4 A.M. in the Krylon
Stewie like a rugrat
Super dope mixtapes gonna dub that
Sticks in a bundle are harder to break
And we're all here just to ride the quake
Reverse, to zero effect
Sticks in a bundle are harder to break
We're all here just to ride the quake
Reverse, to zero effect
of modest music from modest people

[Chorus]

[Awol One]
Lovin seritonin, so are the people
The humor is dark, just like the comedy
Don't spend your life rehearsin the dramedy
Everything, that's still the same
Livin life and love in the rap game
You livin life and you lovin the rap game
You look at me, always into something
Carve out your motherfuckin face like a pumpkin
Don't listen to this with the lights off
Don't inhale this rap cause you might cough
Listen to this rap with the lights on
Passion to raw datum with the fight tongue
I wish I was The Howling
Now I'm the one in the corner growling
This is the tip of the iceberg
You can't eat a plate of myrrh
Exploit the exploited
You can not have a brush with game

[Chorus]
