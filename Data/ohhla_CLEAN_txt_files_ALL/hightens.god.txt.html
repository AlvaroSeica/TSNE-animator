[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
My ratchet exhales lead, cleaving
My hatchet's leaving a trail of red
Catchin cerebrum from a detached female head
Apache walkin through the cornfield, I was born real
Wieldin a morning star, you're left torn and peeled on the floor, kneeled
Cold aggressor, buck the .35 off at you like Roth in Little Odessa
Guillotine your crown off with a clothes dresser
The Hades gatekeeper, hatebreeder, breakin your face
I'm blatantly crazier, straight razor your trachea
Pulp plops on your shirt, bloody red polka dots
The unfed vulture plots murder, dead your folks while you watch
Assassinated with acid, fascinated with drilling
Lacerated you bastard, masturbated to killing
Your fucking life x'd out, flex an axe like Dexter
Slash you with plexiglas, Blackberry you like a texter
Fuck what you're sellin, you'll get bucked in your melon
Metal pellets stuck in your cerebellum
Once you're abducted like Helen

[ CHORUS ]
Cut your head off (bust the lead off)
Now get off, the dick, money
yo don't know me (keep it movin, homie)
The Godfathers henchmen
Wre drenched in your blood
(Did I mention?)
When G and Nec in the room it's high tension

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
The killer team, guillotines and gallows
40 caliber loaded with Calicos
On barrel and mallet mode
Calluses of malice grow
Molotov-bottle your ballad flow
Death on a pale horse, the gallop slow
Blade of my Excalibur glow like William Wallace
Send your body off to med school for brilliant scholars
We 'bout to stab 'em with seven daggers like Damien
Triple sixes with three biscuits, empty out in your cranium
Dark clouds and rainy wind
We aimin these 10's on dames and they men
Leave 'em with flaming skin on they dainty limbs
Frontline gunners, we dump 9's in the fronters
Son of Sam handguns, the grunt mind of a hunter
Son, we Leatherface, butchers in bloody aprons
Blood he cravin, muddy beige Timbs
Put a rusty blade in that slut he chasin
Toolshed tools embedded inside her dude's head
No Vital Signs - this be the title up in the news spread
