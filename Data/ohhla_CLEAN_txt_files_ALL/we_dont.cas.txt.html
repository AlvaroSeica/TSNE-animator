Chorus
(Repeat twice)
We don't get down like dat
Even though it might look it might sound like dat
Nigga you can fuck around and get down like dat
Fo' real.Fo' real

[First verse]
Sittin' in the backÂ….hella quiet
Eye's hidden with the hat
Silent but violent is how he act's
Only word's said "I'll be back"
Even the fatigues are black
With the tree's n' the gatt
Fifty gee's in the 'lac
Smellin' the sack
Find a nice little rat n' probably never come back
Be circlein' her house like "where-ever her at?"
Other than that a nigga stay, smotherin' rat's
All in her cat even if she motherin' dat
Dis' E.S.O.O.G. sippin' VSOP in the V.I.P
But now he know in the E.S.O
They  doh'wanna seize (see's?) you all in the G.S.four
Heat in the trunk bad bitch n' she in some pump's
While you a hop skip n' a jump from being a punk
Or put his 85 Fleet up on your lawn n' snatch up your first born
Like Elle Anne or Jean Benet n' see you on your way
Everything you love it could be gone today
Eh I'm psycho alpha crazy disco
What, a brother know?
Than again what a bitch know?
Shit's so easy for the schizo get dough flip mo'
------? ------? -----?

Chorus
(Repeat twice)
Eh we don't get down like dat
Even though it might look or might sound like dat
Nigga you can fuck around and get down like dat
Fo' real.Fo' real

[Second verse]
Just because I got my own C.D. n' bitch's be on my lyric's like ecstasy
You can catch me (Uwe?) n' E Fee (check shout out's) in a S.U.V
With bitch's lookin' at us like "rescue me!"
Manipulatin' women, that's my speciality
So that could be me in the Lex two gee
And next to me a stallion talkin' 'bout sex
Nigga I'm a do my thang wit' you if I hang wit you
If I ain't wit chu I'm aimin' for brain tissue
When nigga's who came with you think I'm playin' games wit you
I aimmm n' hit you with the same pistol
I ain't a killer n' premeditated murder undereducated.                                                                                                                              
And don't get away wit it, be pointin', the finger like "Dey did it!"
A nigga snitch went bitch real game wit it
I freak a flow just to play wit it
Just like I play wit ho's intelligence n' tell a bitch I'm celibate
Just for the hell of it
Didn't like smell of it
 She highly upset
I'm highly intelligent
Buildin' on future development
The hardest emcee's out are now delicate
Rap voyeur
 Wit slap for ya
 Tha' warrior Dela Hoya
Swingin' wit no feeling's for ya

Chorus
(Repeat three times)
Eh we don't get down like dat
Even though it might look or might sound like dat
Nigga you can fuck around and get down like dat
Fo' real.Fo' real

Final chorus
(Slightly changed)
Eh Eh we don't fuck around like dat
Even though it might look it might sound like dat
Nigga you can fuck around and get down like dat
Fo' real. Fo' real
