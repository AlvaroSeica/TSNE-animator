Album:  Seventy Two and Sunny
Song:   A Place at My Table
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And you'll always have a place at my table
Hey dinner's ready come on and eat
Get her done

This ain't no Memphis soul songs and Motown rhythm and blues
Or smoky broken soundtracks of my every childhood moves
Soothin' are the cameras lookin' out at my back forty
Lord I don't know where I'd be if not from Berry Gordy
See my story ain't that simple and it don't stop here
Patsy Cline still echos through my younger years
I know you can hear me 'cause the music never stops
George Jones sang me to sleep whether he knows it or not

And I'll always lend a hand if I'm able
And you'll always have a place at my table

I've been this whole world over with Detroit on my mind
But I've got friends in Tennessee, Atlanta and Caroline
We don't need no money and we don't want no grief
But if you came to give some you'll be pickin' up your teeth

And I'll always lend a hand if I'm able
And you'll always have a place at my table

That's your Uncle Kracker sittin' back there on that back porch
And I think sittin' back here I can see, everything I need to see
I think out yonder I see poor old Mr. Bradford fuelin' up the Benz
Everythin' is truly everythin' that's all it can ever be
And that sure is good enough for me

And I'll always give ya help when I'm able
And you'll always have a place at my table

And I'll always lend a hand if I'm able
And you'll always have a place at my table
Get her done</pre>
