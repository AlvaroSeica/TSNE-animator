Typed by: BayAreaGalant@yahoo.com

All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin
Bet she can do it on the dick she poppin
We bottle poppin, you cock blockin
Told ya girl you rap but your CD floppin
Say you gettin money man we ain't seen nothin
Ya girl is persistent, she ain't stoppin

Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
trunk stay bumpin' y'all know we run the town
hood nigga
I keep a bad bitch around
thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
hood nigga
any my chevy's sittin on 24's
flats look like flapjakes, pancakes
you ain't know
hood nigga
I'm a play the game how I know
they can take me out the hood
but I'm a keep it hood folk

And I dont need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you jerk
hatin on me will make your situation worse
you dont wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
all eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
if you scared go to church
man this rap shit is easy, every beat I get I murk

Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
the trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town
hood nigga
and I keep a bad bitch around
thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
hood nigga
and my chevy sittin on 24's
flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
hood nigga
I'm a play the game how it go
they can take me out the hood
but I'm a keep it hood folk

Get like you,naw, get like me
eveesus we dont rock white tees
classic capris, but knicks on my feet
camo bathing apes, 10 pair every week
manasha 3, the gurls suck me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the peak
I C U naw U C me
you'll see ICU fuckin with me

Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
the trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town
hood nigga
and I keep a bad bitch around
thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
hood nigga
and my chevy sittin on 24's
flats look like flapjacks, pancakes you ain't know
hood nigga
I'm a play the game how it go
they can take me out the hood
but I'm a keep it hood folk

Watchin out for goldiggers like kanye
but I will pay beyonce
or ashantay
make kieshia cole say she should've cheated if she eva come my way
get some head from fantasia on the highway
trickin off majic city every monday
it ain't trickin if you got it dats wut I say,U say?
I say and wut I say goes

Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
the trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town
hood nigga
and I keep a bad bitch around
thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
hood nigga
and my chevy sittin on 24's
flats look like flapjacks, pancakes you ain't know
hood nigga
I'm a play the game how it go
they can take me out the hood
but I'm a keep it hood folk

All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin
middle of the stage got the whole club rockin
nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin
bet she cant do it on a dick, she poppin</pre>
