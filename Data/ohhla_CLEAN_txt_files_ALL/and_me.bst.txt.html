Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friends my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Oh my god now take a look at me
My life line's run by AT&amp;T
They got their wires all up in me
Is push and pull the way it's got to be?

Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friends my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Once again I'm all wrapped up in me... (x4)
