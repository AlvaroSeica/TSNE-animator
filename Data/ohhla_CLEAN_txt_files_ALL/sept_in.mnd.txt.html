[Chorus]
41 shots in the summer sky
6 million ways to die
It's been 20 some years since we first set foot on this planet
Take 6 lifetimes to understand it
As 6 turns to 9
Water to wine
Sun starts to shine
We know that we'll be there in due time
There's 8 million stories in the city of crime
Take one look inside of my mind

[Chorus]
It Goes 41 shots in the summer sky
6 million ways to die
It's been 20 some years since we first set foot on this planet
Take 6 life times to understand it
As 6 turns to 9
Water to wine
Sun starts to shine
We know that we'll be there in due time
There's 8 million stories in the city of crime
Take one look inside of my mind

[Verse 1 : Kimani]
Writing from the aftermath, thankful, grateful
Happy to be alive it's been a wild ride lately
6 months until I bring a baby
To a war torn atmospheric explained to her what happened here
Where were you the day the world fell
When you whole sense of security got shot to hell
I was sitting on my couch face drowning in tears
Feeling trapped by the wall in my fears
Made aware of my fragility
I now try with the best of my ability
To never waste a second in life, time is wasting away
I face today count my blessings till the essence
Of my soul will manifest and unfold
A new outlook on life, no longer wasting time
Mulling over all the thinks I don't have I thank God for what he's given me
Life, love and family
Good health, a good mother
And a child that I'm soon gonna love like no other
So baby when you here this and you can comprehend
Know your mom and I will fight for you till the end
We're in a new era together in uncharted time
Filled with terror, war and hatred And apocalypse signs
Every morning now I'm grateful when the morning sun shines
Or I hear my mama's voice on my telephone line
It's the little things that mean the most
The everyday things, I always used to take for granted
But not no more
I'm thinking damn how my ancestors died and cried rivers in vain
Cause we still got no pride
And die niggas, we shuck, jive and bring all I teeth behind figures
Screamin' live from the streets of New York
I wonder, will we ever make it It seemin' now like nothing is sacred
We're as vulnerable as a new born when it comes to earth naked
In a world where so many of you fake it
You see it and if I want it it's out there so I just get it and take it

[Chorus]
It Goes 41 shots in the summer sky
6 million ways to die
It's been 20 some years since we first set foot on this planet
Take 6 life times to understand it
As 6 turns to 9
Water to wine
Sun starts to shine
We know that we'll be there in due time
There's 8 million stories in the city of crime
Take one look inside of my mind

[Verse 2 : Oracle]
Look at this here, World War 3 about to appear
Look at this here, abracadabra magical fear
Look at this here, you saw them Twin Towers disappear
Look at this here, hard to tell the hunter from the deer
Look at this here, so many lives lost that's not fair
Look at this here, now almost everybody's into prayer
Look at this here, can a broken heart be repaired ?
Look at this here, you might need a gas mask to breath air
Look at this here, ain't it weird the future's never clear
Look at this here, it seems like you can never be prepared
Look at this here, life's so fragile yet hard to bare
Look at this here, world peace is the one thing most rear
Look at this here, when times are hardest then we share
Look at this here, no one can see if the end is near
Look at this here, and if you could would you live with no cares ?
Look at this here, I wonder if angels cry and cheer
Look at this here, and if they do when and where ?
Look at this here, all of these thoughts are sincere
Look at this here, when I speak truth do you get scared ?
Look at this here, if not then take one look inside of my minds atmosphere

[Chorus]
It Goes 41 shots in the summer sky
6 million ways to die
It's been 20 some years since we first set foot on this planet
Take 6 life times to understand it
As 6 turns to 9
Water to wine
Sun starts to shine
We know that we'll be there in due time
There's 8 million stories in the city of crime
Take one look inside of my mind</pre>
