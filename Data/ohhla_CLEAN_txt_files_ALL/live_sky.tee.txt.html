[Intro: T.I.]
What's happenin man? This TIP, you know?
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know
what I'm sayin?
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx &amp; TIP]
(Life's ups and downs they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 1]
My cousin Tu ain't have to die, right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin folk
And I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin joke
I can feel my eyes fillin, the Lord is my witness
If I catch him, I'mma kill him, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not wit me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he at his family house, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shootin, judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartment, she still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
Guess ya death was a lesson in life, it taught me that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Know they say a nigga go to jail and sleep til day 2
Well that's how sick I was when J-Ru
Found out the hard way, that when powder that they were tootin
Overdose on heroin, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do
And I got 4 myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Daysia, Demani
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin in the trap, with carryin this here cap
Laughin at the niggaz who serve with no strap
Tell them niggaz, man, y'all trippin with no maps
Get robbed, and thats the part of my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize, you died, that's why they say that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I bet you niggaz think I'm livin it up
Til you see polices laughin as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, feds rushin my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
"But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin wit that?"
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real, niggaz to suffer
And I ain't neva been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin from me
Ol G's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggaz only knew the kind of time I was facin
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked</pre>
