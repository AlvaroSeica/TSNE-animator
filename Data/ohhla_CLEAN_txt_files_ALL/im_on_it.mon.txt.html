Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything is on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitch fuck [?]
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[French Montana]
Got the proposition, with no pot to piss in
We the hardest out, there ain't no competition
And I be's the jungle fever
Get the heart cheaper, lower than a dark caesar
Unbeatable, unbelievable and the drug dealers love me told me I don't need the blow
Here's a half a brick nigga you don't need to show
But I took it easy like I don't see the toe
Jewellery 3 below, niggaz get bureau
Tunnel vision on that money I don't see a hoe
I'm bout the chops, that shawty [?] blew up a body part

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything is on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitch fuck [?]
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
First nigga to put it down, rep the city the way I do it
Got these niggaz rolling they drugs, bitches with they hands out
But we don't feed nothing but champagne and zigzag stuffers
Taking pictures with my campaign stuntin,
Nigga I ain't showin off, them niggaz tuck they wings
I'm the flyest in my course
I always forget the game sittin courtside with my bad bitch as she roll up too
Jessica Bunay you should fear
No wear near tied but had a good year
If bitches still choosing niggaz hating on me
If you ain't talking paper that's another story

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything is on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitch fuck [?]
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[Nipsey Hu$$le]
Slim type of nigga they know not to push
Plus I got them type of choppers leave Osama shook
Real crook, you would think I'm some type of Bush
More bitches open up their legs so I octopus
It's all money yeh, but that's just common sense
I wish that ya'll could see these checks I be depositin
Wiz drives in, Big drives in
Bitch times 10, like fuck who out the fam
We just do us, you just copy them
2 Xs 1 L we the top 10
And I ain't never been to big about what the critics say
Unless the critics say that type of shit they getting paid

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything is on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitch fuck [?]
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[Big Sean]
I just, I just want the money and the power
And I get em both 10 000 miles an hour
That's why your girl will leave with me but you will not allow her
Fuck your lil section bitch I want the entire
My nigga Wiz roll up like cripple respect
Man I bet you call big when I'm little
And she goin call me big when wiggle
Me and 2 hoes and I'm just chillin in the middle
Biiitch, your whole life is fictional
You bitch want to play doctor on my dick she want my physical
Smokin medical marijuana, my shit's medicinal
I love it, love it, love it
Bitch I love it unconditional

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything is on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitch fuck [?]
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it</pre>
