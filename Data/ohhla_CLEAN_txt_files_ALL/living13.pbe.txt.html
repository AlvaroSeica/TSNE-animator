[Intro: 13th Message by Chuck D]
Yo, what's up?!
This is the P.E.S.A. - Public Enemy Service Announcement
Cause I feel this is somethin' that we got to say
You see, they're tryin' to make Hardcore Rap disappear
Tryin' to make it final for the vinyl 
Sayin' at this time for the wax to relax
Black Radio, yes, I said Black Radio
Is puttin' most of us to sleep in the 90s
With too many, I said too many, slow jams
And I wanna know where's the beats 
For the mind and for the feet, not the songs that's puttin' me to sleep
You see, they're tryin' to make Hardcore Rap disappear
By makin' the Rap DJs obsolete, right Kenny Kane? "YOU KNOW IT G"
My man Kenny Kane from Tampra
By makin' the Rap DJs obsolete, while program and music directors gettin' rich
With kick backs and phoney seminars
Your Record companies out there throw rap on the wall
Still know very little about it 
And figure what sticks it, and what don't, won't be it 
And the government, awww yes, the government, they want Hardcore to vanish
ICE-T's COP KILLER wasn't even a Rap record
But you see, ICE-T is a rapper extraordinair
And here in America it don't matter
Rap is an synonymous with black
And even our own don't realize that Rap is even blacker than themselves
And to the whites who consider themselves an establishment
They feel Rap is the beginin' of cultural overthrow 
In their vary own households, between themselves and their kids
Oh oh, and the president, the good old president
Yo, president, wanna see Hardcore go ghost
CUBE is a soldier approved that it raises the roof, with the truth
And the NEW WORLD ORDER, wants to see the Hardcore go the way of the Dinosaur
A sticker here, a sticker there
And now we wear the sticker like a padge, now what?
Some wanna see us sing, because when you sing you can't get to the point quick enough
In the Hardcore points as sharp and blow the whole joint up
Others wanna see the Hardcore dance, and dancin' is enovlved
But not when the problem gotta get solved
Insurance companies and avenues and buildings and cities 
They treat us like thieves, but let me tell you; I'm not a thief
Just because I spell relief; H-A-R-D Row to the Core will never die
If it ain't us, it's somebody else they wanna kill
HardCore will never die
Hard is not a matter of skills but a battle of wills
Remember that!!
 
[Chuck D]
Skills to kill and fill a hole
We roll deep with a frown that's down
Low in the meddle of jeep beats
So I'm makin' a point, not stickin' butts or blunts
But the Terminator X and the rhythm he cuts
Figure this bigger brother gonna trigger the track
You know, I ain't Country and my name ain't Zack
Step back to back, and take a look at the racks
My world is a ghetto full of tapes and wax
The CDs, they only double the tax
And makin' money money, New York city to lax
Tell the suckers sucker never ever relax
I'm kickin' cold facts so true
It feels like I'm livin' in a zoo
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav]
Now, who wanna tell the psycho?
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
These niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
[Chuck D]
Sayin' I'm down like psycho, where's my rifle? 
Right though, I ain't Michael
Yo, I ain't sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time in a crime with a nine
Rather find another brutal rhyme
It's us verses, I put it all in verses
If the sound reverses, I pump it up with curses
Fuck sittin' in the back of the bus
But don't front what we lack
We got it loaded in a back pack
See, they can do it to a man
But with men suckers Semi'
Think that shit before they come again
No science to the wild senile
Slackin' cause he's packin' like a runaway child 
Yeah, would I ever try to sever? 
Hell no, never would work if the rhyme wasn't clever 
Wild, in an Isle stackin' high from the floor tile
Back in the rack, where the rap never seen yet
Gettin' to the corner wanna scream what I gonna wanna do
Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav w/ variations X2]
Who wanna tell the psycho?
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
These niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo --&gt; Chuck D
 
[Chuck D]
I don't know where I'm at
Here's a track, I try to duck duck (*3 Gun Shots*)
Those 3 bullets in the back Top 40
Ignore me
Sooooo, I hit them in the hood
Until it feel good, ugh
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav w/ minor variations]
Niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
These niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
[Chuck D]
It's not a matter of skills but a battle of wills
Pow the stick up go the quicker the picker up
Trigger eenie meanie with the gat that so fat
Brrap bop bop, Cop Killer in a 16 wheeler
They call me over the phone, che-che-checkin' me out
Takin' my time to find a brother droppin' the dimes
And lookin' over the zone of the murder that Hardcore 
Livin' like Cube said: Once again it's on
And while we tell it like CNN 
My friends to end, close by spine, the rhythm tell the bombs
The bigger the Bam bam, damn the whole squad is mine 
But the Hardcore fans who am I give them slammin'
In the paint, and I ain't givin' up no props to the game
And it stops in the name of the Hip-Hop Reign 
And the pain got me goin'
Goddamn, won't they even pull a bullet on a pop jam
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav w/ minor variations X2]
Niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though, come on!!
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
These niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo --&gt; Chuck D
 
[Chuck D]
This time, the hard rhymer, won't get no bullet
Even if the fan him pull willin'
Be on '95 chillin, be up on fly superstar true fullin'
Livin' in my shack with a how to get a hard time livin'
With the level, I'm survivin' on the rhyme and skills
With the wheel of the killer gets banned and geared
From the shelfs of the All American Store
Ms. Gore got sticker
The only way you hear it if we wanna hit the kicker
If it's not dum didditty dum, didditty didditty dum
You wouldn't know she's in the house when the president come
What I gotta do if the Rap and the love turnin' so crap? (*Gun Shot*)
Makes feel like I'm livin' in a zoo
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav w/ minor variations X2]
Now who wanna tell the psycho?
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
 
These niggaz wanna tell the psycho
But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy and dirty
Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo --&gt; Chuck D

Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo --&gt; Chuck D
