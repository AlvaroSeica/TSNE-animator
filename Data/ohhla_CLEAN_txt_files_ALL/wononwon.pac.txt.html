[ CHORUS 2X ]
How you doin, love?
You lookin so fine
What you think about me and you doin us
One on one, yo, I only got you in mine

[ VERSE 1: Pacewon ]
Aiyo what's good, shorty, wanna get naughty?
Light up a blunt and get a forty?
Call up your friends and tell the story
They'll probably hate because they're corny
But I don't need them to make you horny
All I need is courage and a conversation topic
Jump in the whip, let's go shoppin
Yeah, I buy you anything, diamonds and pearls
Hook you up, have you lookin more flier than your girls
Straight lacin you up, just buyin you furs
$3000 shoes that match with your purse
Yeah, alligator boots - when I'm all through
I'll have you shootin fellas down like World War II
Put a rock on that finger, candle light dinners
Steak and champagne, a little sushi and ginger
I'll taste-test your food, make sure it ain't bitter
You take my breath away every day, girl you a winner
Damn

[ CHORUS 2X ]

[ VERSE 2: Pacewon ]
Yeah, you look good as a homecooked meal
I'm talkin string beans, potatos and veal, on the real
You got this little sexy supermodel appeal
You make me feel like I'm high on a pill
I wanna rock with you, I Can't Wait like the Redman song
I'll work you out, throw a headband on
I'll have you sweatin like ( ? )
Heart racin like you playin a sport
Ain't it good to ya
You're more hotter than the 2nd of June
The sun shines when you step in the room
I'm like 'Yo....' I don't wanna sound like a jerk
But you give me butterflies like the first day of work
And the thought of losin you is like a wound, it hurts
Have me feelin more scareder than a hooker in church
Yo, I wanna hold your hand like The Beatles
Come to your crib and meet your peoples

[ CHORUS 2X ]
