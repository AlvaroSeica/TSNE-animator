[Dr. D]
Shego, give me a beat!
Yes.. Shego... give me a beat Shego!
SHEGO!! Fine, mmph
You want a beat done right
{*starts beatboxing*}

[Verse One]
Yo yo yo I used to be Drew
One day I turned blue
As a suede shade of berry it makes me look scary
Then I ponytailed my hair...y
Got me a nasty scar
And a funky fresh flying car
Now Drew be Dr. Drakken so quit that yakkin
Think I'm out? Ha! I'm back in!
My lippy sidekick Shego
She kicks me in my ego
Got some freaky glowing hands, mocks my super genius plans
Makes me do my defeat dance
(Ehh, ooh, c'mon, nahhh, eeh, gah, ACK~!!)

[Verse Two]
Had dreams to rule the world
Or build a better robot girl
All end in rejection so after introspection
I turned my career in another direction
Thanks to one all that teen
Mr. Mean is squeaky clean
Though my face is still blue, tell you what I can do
Sell ya all some freaky shampoo

[Chorus]
Lather rinse and obey!
It's time to wash your hair today!
You may think I'm a villain, yo I'm just chillin
Come on, let me hear you sayyyyyyyyy
Lather, rinse and obey!
I'm a player just playin his play
My product's in a rap song, time to get your wash on
With Dr. D's brainwashing shampoo
and cranium rinnnnnnnnnnnse!

Fo' sheezy, it's off the heezy!</pre>
