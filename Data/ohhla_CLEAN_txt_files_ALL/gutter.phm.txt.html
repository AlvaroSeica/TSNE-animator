[Intro]

*kicking down a door*

(Pooh-Man) Bitch where the motherfuckin son at?
(Too $hort's Bitch) He not here ahhh it hurts!
(Pooh-Man) Old Skool get this bitch eh! where $hort at?
(Too $hort's Bitch) Pooh he's not here I don't know
(Pooh-Man) Give that nigga a message bitch!

*Gunshot*

Ain't No Love $hort
We be takin shit in '94
In the deuce we ain't bullshittin
I want it all
I want your jewelry, your motherfuckin car
I want your whole safe nigga
Yeah take off the motherfuckin Nikes
What are they Fila
Take the motherfuckers off mark

[Verse 1: Pooh-Man]
Grab my coat and my motherfuckin glock
Now I'm headed out the door to the motherfuckin spot
Got a G bundle for the brothers who be slanging
And an extra clip in my coat for foo's who be banging
The town of macks is gettin way hot now
Police be tappin my phone and getting me locked down
But it's an everyday thang if you slang
20 zips gone in a matter of an hour man
But I stay skeptic about fools that I deal with
You slip once you get your cap peeled real quick
Cuz nigga's are shistey as fuck!
Going to drop off some yeh and your ass jacked the fuck up
By some nigga's that you know baby
Cuz most nigga's on your block straight be shady
Out to get a grip no matter what it takes
Make a mistake and find your ass dead in a fuckin lake
With bullet holes in your body
Because you ran into the neighbor hood John Gotte
Faulty as hell ass brother
Yeah just anther damn day in the gutter

[Pooh-Man]
You nigga's got something I want
I'm taken it I give a fuck where your from mark
That's right nigga
Motherfuckers like us be takin shit in '94
7 deuce in the motherfuckin house beyatch
What the deuce look like nigga
Any nigga I tell is a fake ass studio gangsta
Leave the punk ass shit behind ya boy
Come to the deuce and find out what it's all about punk

[Verse 2: Pooh-Man]
Anther jack move anther nigga to get with
Up in Milwaukee with mighty on the mark us
They gotta look with 100K with ease
So we kicked in his door and put him on his knees
Open your safe or loose your face
And turn it to 11 to a motherfucking murder case
He opened the safe and accepted the loss
But the fool seen my face so I had to tear his off
125K made in one motherfuckin day
Back to the house to split the cash
It equaled out to about 41 G's and a half
Money seen money gone brother
Mighty Mone just looked and said just a dead motherfucka
Yeah you punk ass nigga
Don't get into the game if you can't stand the heat killa
Cuz real players know
That there's always a nigga who will jack you for your cash-flo
And you just met the brother
And he's straight  from the motherfuckin gutter

<spoken>
(Pooh-Man)

Yeah you nigga want some motherfucking funk
The bottom line is this you can meet the T *gun cocks*
And after that it's all the fuck over with
What that deuce look like nigga (what it look like)
Yeah we be puttin nigga's on there mothafuckin backsides

[Verse 3: Pooh-Man]
Back in Cali at my mama's
And already got involved in some motherfuckin drama
Mom's said Moe called he needs you to page him
Some foo's in a Mustang GT tried to blaze him
So I hit him up on his pager
He answered me quick
And I'm like so what sup player
The funk is on once again
Break out the Thompsons, the AK's and the Mack 10's
I called up Antoine and Old Skool
Meet me at the spot you know this fools ain't cool
Hopped in the national and got sideways to the curb
Picked up Mellow with Moe Betta on 83rd
They filled me on the way
While Moe Betta slowly loaded up the AK
Told me Moe was at some bitchs house
They came in and damn blew out my partner brains out
But he got off fast
And put 1 outta of 2 on there motherfuckin ass
As we was talkin we spotted the brothers
Cut off the lights
*Gunshots*
Just anther day in the gutter</spoken></pre>
