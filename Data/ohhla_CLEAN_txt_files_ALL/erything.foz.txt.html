Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Do you know what it's like
Getting up every morning
Feeling hopeless
Feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man
But at the same time
Hoping that she still finds happiness
Even if it's never gonna be with you
Sorry
don't, love means never having to say you're sorry

I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed

Yeah, whats the point to this
Baby whats the point to this
how can this be a fairytale if you don't even
wanna help me write this script
I thought that we'd last forever
but it's overdone
You'll fuck those feeling, you couldn't
overcome

But why cheat, why cheat
Tell me why'd you fucking cheat
Why'd you go and fuck another guy right after
fucking me
Like didn't I do it, didn't I do it
all the more shit, yeah
we've been through it
still I'm here, still I care
still believe in this love so rare

My first love, my first love
probably my worst love
I still remember how she said I promise I wont
hurt ya
but, but, but, you did, and I'm gone
and know that, just know that

I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed

She says I'm pushing her away
but I know she loves me so she stays
now shes crying, and I'm lying
don't know how we got to this
Yeah, shes cussing and we're fighting
and I'm trying but I miss

How we used to be
back then when everybody made fun of me
you tell 'em get lost, you tell 'em get stuffed
he'll be the one to come and break your heart
but she loves me, girl I know you love me
so I wont have to look back and say

I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed
I could've given you everything you wanted
everything you needed</pre>
