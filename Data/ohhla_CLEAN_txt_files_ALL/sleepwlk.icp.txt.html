Welcome everyone
Nate it's good to see you back
People we have a new member today
I'd like you to meet him
He's gonna stand up and tell us
What's going on with him and
What he wants to change about himself
If you will
Ummm hello everybody
My name is Violent J
and I'm an axe murderer
(Hi Violent J)
Ok now remember we all have similar problems
And that's why we're all here 
To help each other work them out
Well I just hope you guys don't think I'm crazy but uh
(Tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us)
Ok I will tell you if you don't tell no one else
Think I have a problem and I probably could use help
You know the midnight killer that's been all over TV
I'm not totally sure but I think it could be me
Something happens to me when I'm sleeping in the night
Wake up in my backyard with a shovel and a knife
Filling up a hole again I've dug up 32
I know all my dreams of murder probably all are true
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I walk around my neighborhood in my slippers and my sweats
Snoring loud and mumbling steady squeezin necks
Never have to worry about traffic or the cops
All I have to do is stay away from donut shops
I remember napping time in kindegarten class
Wasn't quite a killer yet, I'd only beat some ass
Never very popular most kids would point and stare
That's why I bring the Nyquill and drink that shit right there
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I think, well I hope it's like
All bigots and richies that I'm killing but
Probably an occasional innocent bystander every now and then
That's ok we all make mistakes
But are you absoutely sure that 
It's even you doing these killings?
The more I think about it all I see that it could be
Everytime I meet a girl and bring her home with me
Wake up in the morning there's no sign of my sweetheart
Yet I see another hole is dug up in my yard
Denny's all night murders, and the Kinko's killing spree
Missing Sunday paper boys I can't believe it's me
I'm the only one from summer camp that made it home
Could this really be what's goin on?
Let me sleep on it
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
Ride around on possum back and eat with the racoons
Chirpin with the crickets naked underneath the moon
Every morning I wake up and check if I've been gone
Muddy boots, and Steak 'n Shake food wrappers on my lawn
I cannot imagine just to think what I have done
Sat there eating chili fries and slaughtered everyone
Tried to see a hypnotist to get inside my head
But woke up and found that bitch dead because
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
Stab 'em (stab 'em)
Right
Choke 'em (choke 'em)
Kill 'em (kill 'em)
And sleep right through the night
I choke em (choke 'em)</pre>
