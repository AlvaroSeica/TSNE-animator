Typed by: Whatsyfsm@aol.com

damn, these hard times be more vicious
makin me feel like the liquidation of the ghetto

chorus
it's hot around my way 
lookin for a better day  X4

[Prime Suspect #1]
good and bad, right and wrong lurking the land
you choose your fate gracefully
save your soul if you can
life is shorter everyday my nigga make the right moves
choose your hustle spots wisely police give you the blues
lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper
see the white boy be on every money and your paper
put the weed down now cause we face incarceration
stipulations of probation strike two is what you're facin
in the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce
short timin round them lifers hopin that you touch down
if I see the free world again, I'm a ball
put my back up on the wall hopin blessins from the lord
3rd strike twenty to life nigga I choose death
leave a coppers scar wet I ain't aimin for the chest
44 chrome to the dome, uzi man did it
once again Prime Suspect guilty til proven innocent

chorus

[Mystikal]
I'm sweatin cause it's hot and humid outside
the spot where we lay it down
I amplify the city streets and terrorize the underground
nigga respect gangsta and run in the streets they walk on
FBI might finish listenin to the car phone I talk on
waitin on me, wantin me to mess up, put my hands in some dirt
but I'm a legitimate businessman, I sell light green t-shirts
go on officer leave me alone, I ain't be got no weapon
I don't even know what you talkin bout, I be makin records
hits size I'm too busy for this bull and kicks
was it tinted when you pulled this six
over to the side of the road
got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes
let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes
but I bet I make it home cause you gotta let me go
I'm too cold for an iron box
I need city lights, the projects, and the boondocks

chorus

[Prime Suspect #2]
I'm lookin for that wall
so I can put my back up against it
cause it ain't no love from the beginnin to the endin
they got me pledgin the flag that wanna see me doin 10 in
see it's vicious out chea on these 3rd world streets
them people tryin to stop the hustle 
but yet they survivor just like me
makin liquidate runnin in them hater streets
so I tell my brother get the cake for me if need be

[Prime Suspect #3]
look let me run into ya'll cause the pilots burnin over
I've been doin the same thing since lil 
but now I'm called a soldier
and I'm older and watch fake soldiers transform cause they own
see them same soldiers upstate and they ain't bout no home
why it's already a livin hell for the average thick soldiers
survival of the fittest watch yourself
is what poppa always told me
why we already misled, bustin hot metals
I just need to step back and take a look
cause they liquidatin the ghetto

chorus until end</pre>
