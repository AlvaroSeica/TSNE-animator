Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Black cat come visit me, I don't care what people say
I saw your hazel eyes, sparkling in the moonlight

Black cat one day things will change, I'm gonna wipe away your bad name
my friend tells me you're no good, and I say hey I'm not afraid

Black cat you're beautiful, why does everybody run away
has anybody told you, I care
has anybody told you, I love you

Black cat come visit me, I don't care what people say
I saw your hazel eyes, sparkling in the moonlight
black cat things will change, I'm gonna wipe away your bad name
black cat you're beautiful, black cat, black cat</pre>
