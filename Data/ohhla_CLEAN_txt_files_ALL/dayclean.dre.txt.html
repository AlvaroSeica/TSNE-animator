{*inhale*}

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Mista Busta
Where ya at?
Can't scrap a lick
So I know you got ya gat
You stay on hard
From gankin' ya raw dawgs
The hood you threw up with
Homies you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
So now it's time for the doctor to check your ass
Fool
Used to be my homey
Used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste
Out your mouth
Make you bow down to the Row
Gankin' me, now I'm gankin' you, little hoe
Oh
Don't think I forgot
Let you slide
Let me ride
Just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'm a talk on
Stompin' on the easiest/+Eazy+est streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, you locs
And watch your back, cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud
And stay low-key
B.G., cause you lost all your homey's love
Now call it what you want to
You trip with me
Now it's a must that I trip with you

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah
You know what I'm sayin'
We now have your record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go...
Yeah

Pre-Verse: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Bow wow wow, yippy yo, yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's definitely in the
House
Bow wow wow, yippy yo, yippy yay
Death Row's definitely in the
House

[Verse 2: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Bow wow wow, yippy yo, yippy yay
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day
Play
With my bone, would ya Timmy?
It seems like you're good for making jokes about your jimmy
Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama
That you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But on the rizzeals, I'm talkin' about you and me
Toe to toe
Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud, but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg, oh is he crazy?
With ya mama and your daddy hollin', "Baby"
So won't they let you know
That if you step to Dre, fool, you steppin' to Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs
I'm hollin' 187 with my gat in your mouth, fool (Fool...)

[RBX]
Yeah
Long Beach and Compton together on this track
And just when you thought we were slippin'
BOO-YEAH!
Right back at ya
Now
You wanna step up and get your cranium cracked
Step on up
And remember the name
Mighty
Mighty
D-R.
And we puttin' in work
Yeah

(Verse 3)
[Snoop Dogg] Now understand this
             My homey Dre can't be touched
[Dr. Dre]    Luke's bendin' over
[Snoop Dogg] So Luke's gettin' stuffed, busta
[Dr. Dre]    Must, of thought I was sleazy
             I though I was a mark, cause I used to hang with Eazy
[Snoop Dogg] Animosity
             Made you speak, but you spoke
             Ay yo Dre
[Dr. Dre]    What up
[Snoop Dogg] Break him off somethin', loc
[Dr. Dre]    If it ain't another hoe that I gots to get with
             Gap teeth in your mouth, so my gat's, gots to fit
[Snoop Dogg] With my sack on your tonsils
             While you onstage, rappin' at your wack-ass concerts
[Dr. Dre]    And I'm a snatch your ass from the backside
             To show you how Death Row pull off that whoo-ride
[Snoop Dogg] Now you might not understand me
[Dr. Dre]    Cause I'm a rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
[Snoop Dogg] Then we gon creep to South, Central
             On a Street Knowledge mission
[Dr. Dre]    As I steps in the temple
             Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
             Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
[Snoop Dogg] You tryin' to check my homey, you best check yourself
             Cause when you diss Dre, you diss yourself

[Dr. Dre]
Hell yeah
So all you mark-ass busters need to raise up
Really doe
Death Row is runnin' the nine-trey
And you know we can't be faded (faded...)
