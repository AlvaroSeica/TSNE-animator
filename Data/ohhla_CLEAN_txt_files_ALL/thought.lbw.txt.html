Song:   Thought U Was the One
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
thought you was the one
thought it was love but I was just infatuated
sorry things ain't work out out
I I thought you was the one
took my life for granted
leaving wasn't the easy way out out
I I thought you was the one
and even though girl you had your bad ways
You just wasn't happy with yourself self
I I thought you was the one
baby this is for the best
I think I'm better off by myself self

[Verse 1]
got a nigga thinking different
thought you really loved me girl
spent most of my time with ya
Introduced you to my world
had you to moving to miami
you bout to break your lease
told you you ain't have to pay for nothing
you can just stay with me
cause I really cared for ya
told ya id be there for ya
shit I even thought bout putting a ring on ya
I know you think about me I wonder what on your mind
I guess I'll never know cause I'm leaving you behind

[Chorus]
thought you was the one
thought it was love but I was just infatuated
sorry things ain't work out out
I I thought you was the one
took my life for granted
leaving wasn't the easy way out out
I I thought you was the one
and even though girl you had your bad ways
You just wasn't happy with yourself self
I I thought you was the one
baby this is for the best
I think I'm better off by myself self

[Verse 2]
man we would argue all ther time
then wed do something to make it up
playing a dangerous game and I'm reppin up
homies think I'm stupid but I got hit by cupid
I know what you're doing girl so don't act like I'm stupid
only want the best for you I'll put you on game
and those couple months you were with me I made your life change
and whom you ever talk to girl it ain't gonna feel the same
why don't you do do I'm a do the same thing

[Chorus]
thought you was the one
thought it was love but I was just infatuated
sorry things ain't work out out
I I thought you was the one
took my life for granted
leaving wasn't the easy way out out
I I thought you was the one
and even though girl you had your bad ways
You just wasn't happy with yourself self
I I thought you was the one
baby this is for the best
I think I'm better off by myself self

[Bridge]
I know you want me girl girl girl
I know you want me girl girl girl
I know you need me girl girl girl
I know you need me girl girl girl

[Chorus]
thought you was the one
thought it was love but I was just infatuated
sorry things ain't work out out
I I thought you was the one
took my life for granted
leaving wasn't the easy way out out
I I thought you was the one
and even though girl you had your bad ways
You just wasn't happy with yourself self
I I thought you was the one
baby this is for the best
I think I'm better off by myself self</pre>
