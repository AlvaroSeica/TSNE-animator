[Intro/Sample] {Vocals}
If I thouht you'd ever change, you're wrong
You're wrong
You're wrong

[Bridge/Hook]
This isn't some hidden mystery - this is recent history
This isn't some hidden mystery - this is recent history

[Verse 1]
This white fella drops topics at the top of his esophagus
About issues of prominence across this stolen continent
A consequence of considering endless sentiments
Expressing discontent has turned me into a dissadent
But this event isn't necissarily negative
I'll take these things and flip em', turn them into a positive
That's why I feel we need to try and heal this wounded space
This landscape aches from what's taken place
This isn't some hidden mystery, this is recent history
Listen you can hear its echo lingering
And it'll remain when little has changed
All we do is pass the blame for these indelible stains
Like "It wasn't me", "I didn't do it", "It's not my problem"
"I've had it hard, I've made it far, it's up to them to solve it"
True in a sense but whose institutions who we live in?
Who's schools? Who's legal system? And who's clinic?
Who educates, who legislates and evaluates
Who desicrates, who appropriates and dominates
Colonisation isn't finished with, it's just so imbedded we're missing it
One of many white privilege's

[Chorus]
I've got a million words, if you could feel the hurt
If I could change (YOUR MIND...)
I'd shout everyone a round, yeah everyone in town
If I could change (YOUR MIND...)
I'd throw a speech at all I meet, like a preacher in the street
If I could change (YOUR MIND...)
I'd be down the backyard waving round a placard
If I could change (YOUR MIND...)

[Verse 2]
I'll be the first to say this country is a great place
But if we call it 'home' there's a few things we must face
This is a nation made from murder, the theft of land 
And the denial of rights we must understand
Yeah, they call it "Black Armband" but these things are facts and it's time to
acknowledge what's happened
Cos tomorrow songs are made from today's sounds
Today's cacophony - of course it has a background
in savage massacres, protection acts and dispossession
Missions and reserves, cultural repression 
The colonial legacy - a cycle of violence
The political strategy - denial and silence
And it's a white wash that works wonders on sane citizens
It wipes away what our hearts have been whispering
But more are giving in, hearing and listening
It's time to realise who's country it is we're living in

[Chorus]

[Bridge/Hook]
This isn't some hidden mystery - this is recent history
This isn't some hidden mystery - this is recent history
This isn't some hidden mystery - this is recent history
This isn't some hidden mystery
Listen... You can hear its echo lingering...</pre>
