Song:   Everyday Thing
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My name's Johnny
This ain't a Sunday thing, a once in a while thing
Maybe if my emotions get high enough thing, it's
Everyday Thing

God don't owe me anything, I owe Him everything
They try to put Him in a box like a wedding ring
He came out, oh dear, no venison
Our sin is disease, Jesus is still the medicine
That's why these bars hard to explain,
So I calculate my rhymes, sorta like a chess game
I'm tryna balance all my art and theology
So when it comes out of me, I represent properly
Three persons, one God, no apostrophe S's
Progressing with caution, slow talkin'
Quick to listen, with sick precision Jesus fix my vision
Man I don't care if you Christian, you're wack with what you're spittin'
I ain't writin' you no mediocre pass, pimpin'
This is art, it don't have a religion, they try to pigeon-hole me
Say I'm too holy to show face
I don't come around 'cause y'all just wanna see my old ways
I'm on a new path, I'm chuckin' up the peace sign
They throw it back without the index, what could I expect
Hate my master, then they gon' hate me too
Wish death upon me, well I'm just prayin' for you

We walk it out, we gettin' it,
Ain't no days off, man we livin' it
Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
Yo it's an Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
We walk it out, we gettin' it,
Ain't no days off, man we livin' it
Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
Yo it's an Everyday thing, every-everyday thing

I'm tryna die hard, I Bruce Willis on 'em
Got living waters like rivers, so I fill up on 'em
Ladies go to the club, let dudes feel up on 'em
You do that anywhere else and that's a real problem
They violating they own codes of ethics
I'm leavin' the studio, while you're fixing your breakfast
Then I Waco and read the Texas, you know
Spurgeon, Oswald, and both testaments
I'm feelin' excellent, came home from Cali
Where I hit a BMW and even left a dent
It kept from a show out in San Diego
But God knows it coulda been worse, so I'm grateful
I escaped without injury, missing a few pesos
There goes what I just made at my show, shoot
But with the Savior I got favor like playin' rock, paper
With Edward Scissorhands, man I could never lose
I'm winning, he won one in the beginning, God
Stopped the sentence, isn't it so evident
It's all about him from the first verse of Genesis
He The Beginning and The End and the Present tense

We walk it out, we gettin' it,
Ain't no days off, man we livin' it
Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
Yo it's an Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
We walk it out, we gettin' it,
Ain't no days off, man we livin' it
Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
Yo it's an Everyday thing, every-everyday thing</pre>
