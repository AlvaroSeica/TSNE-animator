[Intro]
Number two! We gon' get this done on time
Zinger, ha ha ha ha ha...

[Mad Child]
I was mentally frozen, thawed and eventually chosen
by God, it's a mental explosion
Bloodstream full of poisonous potion
Spit pain, acid rain and corrosion
Heart full of rage, tears fill the ocean
Complex thoughts and my acts are ferocious
I have cracked, I'll attack these vultures
They say that the end of the world is approaching
I am in a troubled spot, but I don't care
I am swamped with the thoughts of me conquering like Juggernaut
Made of rock, I will stomp with these rugged thoughts
And I will no longer act out the Devil's plot

[Chorus]
When I die, I hope to go to Heaven an hour before the Devil finds out
I know I'm dope, I'm on another level afraid that they gonna never find out
When I die, I hope to go to Heaven an hour before the Devil finds out
I know I'm dope, I'm on another level afraid that they gonna never find out, out

[Mad Child]
Mad Child rocks mohawk and a tomahawk
I'm a little maniac, armed with atomic bomb
Nobody can help you, I will fuckin catch you
and scalp you, torch you, burn you and melt you
It's torture, I will burn down your fortress
With torches the magic of warlock and sorcerers
Send a messenger by horse to the castle
I will send him back with his head in a basket
Split personality, depends on the mood I'm in
Put em all together then it's lunacy in unison
Extra-terrestrial barbaric mind state
"Banned From America," very bad character

[Chorus]
When I die, I hope to go to Heaven an hour before the Devil finds out
I know I'm dope, I'm on another level afraid that they gonna never find out
(God forgive 'em)

[Verse 3]
Thought I was mischievous and clever (nope!)
My devious endeavours enslave your soul
I've emerged from the darkness
Reborn like Hellspawn, back underground like Deltron
Daily dosage of Red Bull, Suboxone
and nicotine installments, ripping through this goblin
Sickening involvement, bastards that feed
off my dastardly deeds they are masters of greed
From being General of Hell's army to God's servant
Not perfect, but now observant
I slash demons, and slay serpents
I am the bad guy, boy are they nervous
Thought that I would self-destruct, but was reluctant
Back to fill their bathtubs up with blood
Face responsibility and replace the tasteless
And unplug the Matrix these dumb-dumbs are basic

[Chorus]
When I die, I hope to go to Heaven an hour before the Devil finds out
I know I'm dope, I'm on another level afraid that they gonna never find out
(Pay attention)
When I die, I hope to go to Heaven an hour before the Devil finds out
(I'm a fucking diamond in the rough man)
I know I'm dope, I'm on another level afraid that they gonna never find out
(I'm the greatest new thing out!)</pre>
