[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen (yeah, yeah)
I'm here to tell you (here to tell you)
That this, is a brand new sound (sound)
This, this will change your lives
All you gotta do is turn the shit up (do it turn the shit up)
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS TURN THE SHIT UP MAN!
This what you want? ... This what you need
This what you get? ... This what you like
This that Dirty Money!

[Grace Jones]
Coulda been yo' everythang, coulda been your shootin star
Coulda been your backbone, but now I'm too far away
You won't be there alone, my love wouldn't be wrong
We wouldn't be starin out the window, guessin which way the wind blows

[Chorus: Grace Jones]
You would be lovin me, holdin me, treatin me better
Boy yeah yeah yeah yeah you would - yeah yeah yeah yeah you would
You're just so damn selfish, careless and jealous
You would be loving me yeah you would - yeah yeah yeah yeah you would

[Diddy]
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah you would) Yeah, c'mon, UHH~!
Who was your number one?
Who had niggaz at the altar wearin fuscia gators and cumberbunds?
(C'mon) Got my hand on my gun
As I'm sittin drinkin and thinkin I love you you should have had my son
Got me losin my mind
All alone in my room, starin at your picture like I'm doin time
(Like I'm doin time) I know loving is hard (loving is hard)
But the further you are away got me closer to God

[Grace Jones]
Sex would have been greater, if I was the only one
Wouldn't be your mistress, but now I'm too far to play (too far to play)
Now you take the blame alone (can't take the blame alone)
Love wouldn't be free to roam (love wouldn't be free to roam)
We would be prisoners of the sheets
Baby I'll be a-captured (I'll be a-captured)

[Chorus]

[Grace Jones]
I just wanted you to be here
I lay it all on the line
Diddy you're far too blind
Yeah you know you would
You woulda had woulda had love
Now you sense it's over - so what?
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah you would
You would be loving me yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you would
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you would
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you would
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you would</pre>
