Song:   Hello World
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Hello world
I heard you've been looking for me
I heard you've been waiting on me
Well I'm here and I'm here to stay
Hello world
Sometimes your love turns to ugly
But this world it ain't gotta love me
Well it's cool cause I'll be okay

[Diggy Simmons]
Uhh, I said hello world, meet the man of the century
The man of the hour, I'm usually late on my entry
I'm well worth the wait cause you just won't wanna miss me
I'm not destined for greatness, you could never convince me
That I'm not from the bottom, I grew up so-so
When I rise to the top-top, I'm a tell you I told so
I'm a have the world sick like I'm a comic holder
When 'Bron made the call, to tell the Cavs he's gone
Diggy's home and big it I'm married to two things
I said my vows to money, my other honeys the stage
There's nothing you can say cause I possess the power
They said to tone it down, so I'm a turn it up louder
There's no time to waste, no pit stops, this is a race
And I'm so far ahead of y'all that there's a delay
I'm trying to get me a ring, more than 5 in a row
And the song goes "Hello World"

[Chorus]

[Diggy Simmons]
Conquer the world, that's my goal and I plan to
It's already been written, referenced the Book of Daniel
And you lose and they love you, when you win they can't stand you
Like they sit in a pool of lies, there's few that'll stand true
They think that I'll think no, cause I've got a afro
And I'm outta space gone, cause I got an astro-
-nomical, rap flow, out in commas to cash rolls
Wanna swim with the big fish, I'll piranha you tadpoles
They say that I'm cocky, but I reply that not me
See me rollin' on blades uh, but I don't play hockey
I don't play games much, cause I'm about paper
Recreational past-times, won't help me gain such
They were reluctant, til' I showed 'em substance
Now they caught in my whirlwind, cause I got 'em sucked in
Then I show 'em toughness, I show a lot of heart
Now they all on my side, I call it alucard

[Chorus]</pre>
