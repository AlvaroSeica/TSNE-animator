[ HOOK 2X ]
(I was born and raised in the slums...)
Coney Island, Coney Island
(...of every city)

Yo
It ain't gon get more hood or get more slum
Than 23rd and Mermaid, that's where I'm from
And even though the beach and board walk is fun
Come seven blocks past Nathan's, you're done
Neptune and Surf, murder made the worst
Niggas came in Benzes, left in a hearse
And if they spare your life, your jewels and your cash
You're dispersed, biz know CI niggas thirst
You prolly think it's all beach and amusement park
You would be a fool to peruse after dark
You will see the tool comin through Kaiser Park
Cause late night niggas dig graves, and it's comp then
Blazin is nothin, niggas came through beefin
Got clapped and left at the precint
Now I ain't sayin it is right or is decent
But what it is is real and that's why I speak it

[ HOOK 4X ]

Nigga, I'm a native New Yorker
Coney Isle made me the greatest of authors
The greatest shit talkers
The beachcombin, boardwalkin stalkers
Y'all niggas gased by The Warriors
Well, it ain't no Cyrus here
Niggas do crimes, it ain't no sirens there
Niggas do time and don't nobody care
How we gon cry, that's a no sign affair, nobody tears
We heartless, nigga, raised in the pits
Where you will catch charges before you catch with a mitt
Where you catch bodies or react from a hit
And catch the nigga who did it and clap at his wis'
Niggas more prone to get clapped from a chick
Than get a good job and look after his kids
I know it's foul but reality is
That I'm from Coney Isle and that's what it is

[ HOOK 4X ]

They say it's all good in the hood - nah, misconception
Niggas in the hood suffer from a misdirection
They care more how a nigga rims reflectin
Than care about who gon win the election
If QU is hectic, then CI on some next shit
Prodigy and Hav got the message
The kids is reckless, projects, homes infested
And no, can't shit correct it
