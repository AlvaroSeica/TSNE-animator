(*talking*)
Aw man, they gon' say I'm capping on this one
Huh but guess what though, I am whoa
 
[Chorus]
Smoking dro po'ing fo's, riding on 24's
I'm the nigga in the city, all the bitches wanna know
You like it I love it, don't think nothing of it
If ya see me with a bad bitch, balling out in public
 
[Lil' O]
You boys new to it, me I'm true to it
Hit the club, gone off drank dro and goose fluid
I might po' some Patron, and put some juice to it
Or pop some champagne, so hoes could get loose to it
Mr. Fat Rat, with the Cheese
Her ass black, eyes Vietnamese
Her titties right, her 'fit is tight
And she saying, she gon' let a nigga hit tonight
Me I'm looking like the one, when I hit the light
Black as hell, but these diamonds make you think I'm bright
If I tell you I'm a boss, you gon' think I'm right
Fire up a square, in the air watch it stink tonight
These haters hating, it doesn't matter
On a nigga dick, to tell the truth I'm flattered
Just know that I keep some'ing, that'll make you splatter
Hey, it'll make you splatter
 
[Chorus]
Smoking dro po'ing fo's, riding on 24's
I'm the nigga in the city, all the bitches wanna know
You like it I love it, don't think nothing of it
If ya see me with a bad bitch, balling out in public
Shopping bags popping tags, all my bitches love to brag
They be like, there go baby daddy hopping out the Jag
You like it I love it, don't think nothing of it
If ya see me breaking haters off, balling out in public
 
[Lil' O]
I grind hard, I pray harder
I move fast, I think smarter
I crush haters, I wreck daughters
I'll put it in ya face, like some cold water
They be like OMG, the shoes Louis V
Louis glasses Louis belt, with the Louis tee
Ay all the parties take a snap, of Louis me
Got the broads crazy, hopping out the newest V
Boys always ask me O, how you get a grip
I tell em stay away from haters bro, and never quit
Understand they gon' hate you, when you getting rich
So keep your bidness to yourself, never tell em shit
Be your own man, top roll man
Move late sometimes, you gotta stand alone man
Now I'm talking big money, on my phone man
Plus I'm on drank, in my big styrofoam man
 
[Chorus]
Smoking dro po'ing fo's, riding on 24's
I'm the nigga in the city, all the bitches wanna know
You like it I love it, don't think nothing of it
If ya see me with a bad bitch, balling out in public
Shopping bags popping tags, all my bitches love to brag
They be like, there go baby daddy hopping out the Jag
You like it I love it, don't think nothing of it
If ya see me breaking haters off, balling out in public</pre>
