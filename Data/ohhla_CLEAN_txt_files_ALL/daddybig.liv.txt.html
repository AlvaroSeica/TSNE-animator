[Intro: Stretch]
Back again, back again
Tell a friend, tell a friend
Back again, back again
Uh, tell a friend nigga
Yeah...

[Hook: Stretch](repeat 4x)
It's the Daddy Bigtimers
We're livin' big time

(Willie D sample)(repeat 3x)
I make big money

[Verse 1: Live Squad]
[Majesty]
Check it, bomb droppers
Pistol poppers, fuck them coppers
We got lawyer money
check the stead, it's the Benz hoppers
Cash getters, you can tell by the sweaters
A couple of hundred, and many more so we don't run out
Strictly flavour, jealous niggas show they ass now
Get us vexed, and make us run and lay your ass down

[Stretch]
Try to get wit
The Imperialistic
Wit the biscuits
If you're soft don't risk it
It's the generals, moving with the rough of the world
Stay drinkin' Hennessey til a nigga call Earl

[Majesty]
And uh, I'm nowhere near soft
You better check the grapevine
Ain't nuttin ch-danged, we still carry the nis nines
Stay freshly dipped, k k
Grabbin minds, gettin' busy
Wreck in stages, niggas front they'll joint blazes
Jet through the back door, must avoid cases
Switch places

[Stretch]
I'ma take it from here
I got forty rugged niggas coming in from the rear

[Majesty]
Steppin through, diamonds shining
step into the bars superstar stylin'
and big timing

[Stretch]
Pack the 9's in, get the drink from the bar
you wish you were subliminal with top criminal
superstar is the status
and cops is the maddest
wishing they could catch us alone with no chrome

[Majesty]
but them is dreams cuz we stay with the red beams on top of the steel
cuz that's real where we're from in Queens
Ready for whatever, that's under the water - never
taking no shorts, got your wife in the resort

[Stretch]
Thoughts are thoughts, niggas get played like a sport
Cops get baught, wannabe bustas on the fort
You get taught
Big time shakin' the fools
poppin' and rockin' them niggas
and we live by the rules of the streets
Yeah...

[Hook: Stretch](repeat 4x)
It's the Daddy Bigtimers
We're livin' big time

(Willie D sample)(repeat 4x)
I make big money

(Willie D sample)(repeat 3x with cutting and scratching)
I make big money

[Verse 2: Stretch]
It's the dondada's, we're gettin' cash in big stacks
when enemies trip, niggas flip with glock maks
The savior, We're running up the level Mafia style
Ain't no time for them knuckleheads runnin' wild
Top dogs be weak, the epitome of violence
livin by the raw code of the silence
G's make a nigga believe he can do it all
So we can't take the stress, wait when his plate fall
Start flippin' on him, puttin pistol whippin's on him
Fighting nose to nose, there's no trickin' on him
Money stackin' is the plan, live life grand and all of that
Runnin' at your home with the chrome gat
Runnin' round in the hundred thousand dollar cars
Certified YG, ghetto superstars
No doubt, we goin out to my nigga Han
We're representin' for the fam, gotta drop bombs
No doubt we'd rather hype for the cash
We're runnin' up the spot just steppin' right to the stash
then glock blast, only if you give a hard time it's drastic
When you see them plastic nines, so gimme mine
It's used to be yours but it's took now
Bad enough your ass is broke but you're shook now
Who's the crook now with the clown on the te-down
We're doing all the sticking, yo you know how we're getting de-down
Come around the back streets with the thugs well
When you hear the gunshots then the drugs sell
Once you smell the weed smoke then you know you're near
Count your cash, you can't wait to get out of there
Yo...

[Hook: Stretch](repeat 4x)
It's the Daddy Bigtimers
We're livin' big time

(Willie D sample)(repeat 4x)
I make big money

(Willie D sample)(repeat 7x with cutting and scratching)
I make big money

[Talking while fading out]
Put em up now, Put em up!
Put em up now, Put em up!
Queens
Jamaica Town
Fade it out to the black, to my niggas selling crack</pre>
