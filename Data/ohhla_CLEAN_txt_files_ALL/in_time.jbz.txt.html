Do you believe?
[ Mike G ]
I believe

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
In time
In time

[ Mike G ]
In time this rhyme will be more than just a fantasy
A black man will be the man to claim presidency
Is it hard to see? So try to see as I see
In time I see a better black reality
It took one man to open the door
He let in one million more
And I don't think that this country knows
What the hell that it's in for
A black reign too tough to tame
Enough to blow the other man's brain
Things just won't be the same
It's gonna be a whole new game
New lessons will be taught
Meaningless fights will not be fought
In attempt to save some lives
Spreadin out more peaceful vibes
See, the less drugs will be sold
So a man can live to grow old
Instead of left in the cold to rot
Cause he got stopped by a small white rock
I hope in time things change
And that I'm around to see that stage

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
In time, my brother
In time, my brother
In time, my brother
In time

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Bible in the closet collectin dust
Mama on crack, now who you gon' trust?
Daddy daddy drinkin that vodka rum
Guzzlin down that 151
Churches people are running to
Preparing themselves for the second coming
Sign of the times, I see some
Angels in the sky, I wanna be one
Livin in darkness, find the light
Afraid to play this record cause they fear the truth
I know that you know you ain't livin right
My Holy Scriptures provide the proof
Below the heavens and above sea level
In time, my brother, I'm tryina tell ya

[ Q-Tip ]
In time, my brother, in time
In time, my brother, in time

[ Q-Tip ]
Everybody thinks Q-Tip is odd
Cause holy, holy Q-Tip speaks of God
The changin of the time arranges a rhyme
( ? ) Moses like Aaron's rod
You could are less about what I'm sayin
So I pray for you when I start playin
I'm a sinner, you're a sinner
Get off the bandwagon and repent yo sins
I don't wanna push my beliefs on you
But you think about it and see if it's true
I'm tellin you, do what you do
See if you last for the broadcast
Cause it's on the way
Preachers preach about it almost every day
These vagabond [/bagabond] shoes are longin to stray
But I'ma bag a vagabond [/bagabond] cause I won't pay
Clock that clock, I'm clockin mine
Better watch out - it's comin in time

In time
(In time)
In time, my brother, in time
(In time)
In time, my brother, in time

In time, my brother, in time

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
I said
In time, my brother, in time
(In time)
In time, my brother, in time
(In time)
In time, my brother, in time
(In time)
In time, my brother, in time
