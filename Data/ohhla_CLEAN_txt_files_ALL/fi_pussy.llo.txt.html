[Lounge Lo]
I'm in the mix, with this chick, that I bagged at 40-40
I told my man, that, I'mma get shorty
She right there at the bar, I walked over
Can we conversate, my whip fit two in the car
And by the way, I'm a nice dude, and if everything
Goes according to plan, I'll buy you the right foods
Make it to wife, I buy you the right jewels
But for now, no jeans and no Nike shoes
Catch me vexed, and I'll show you what the pipe'll do
Viagra ecst', Lil' Kim'll start liking you
Hoes up, hoes down and, shaking that ass
Like Beyonce, enjoying the crown, crown
I wanna fuck only, I wanna bone monie
Hit it from the back at the beach, right next to Toney
And it's all good, cuz it's all hood
We can get it popping, if not, I see your girlfriend

[Chorus: ?]
I wanna bite the pussy, never wife the pussy
Cuz I like the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy
I wanna poke the pussy, I might choke the pussy
Almost broke the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy
I wanna feel the pussy, I wanna steal the pussy
Try to kill the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy
I wanna trick the pussy, can't lick the pussy
Straight dick the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy

[Lounge Lo]
We in the crib after clubbing, she ain't worry bout it
She all with it just to give me some loving
Feeling good on some straight fucking, put ya legs up
Open the pussy let me press the button
King Kong playing ping pong, with his ding dong
I sing song from the time that her screams gone
Everything Yao, and her Ming was on
And for a one night style, man, her thing was on
She got pussy like my favorite bitch, girl's a champ
She know where a nigga want his favorite lick
Hop and a skip, I live for the wop and shit
Come here girl, put ya crotch right on top of my dick
I wanna skeet like the Twins, you ain't my friends
You a one night lense, on the high ends
And it's not that real, it's not that serious
Us Staten Island niggas wanna be curious

[Hook: Lounge Lo]
Friday night, we just got paid
Time to hit the spot, try to get laid
Shorty's drinking, her body's banging
And the tail is stinking, that's what I'm thinking

[Lounge Lo]
Now that my night is over, I send shorty home
She call me back, like, answer the phone
I let it ring out, she left a message, talking reckless
Like it was the wiz or one of my ex's
"Where you at, Lo? I'm looking for you, I just called to let you know
Tonight, that I'mma gonna cook for you"
I don't really need it shorty, send an e-mail
Play with ya self, then write it out in detail
My mind is good, I don't see nothing wrong
Being in the grind with a dime on the hood
Fascinating, break you off, fast my patience
I got a whip, no cab, and no time for waiting
Now I'm back on the block, and I'm stashing my rocks
Fuck you bitch, but I thank you just for blasting my cock
(And Stizzy said) Just put blacks on my cock
(Kweli said) Fuck you bitch, I thank you just for blasting my cock

[Chorus: ?]
I wanna taste the pussy, then lace the pussy
Straight up disgrace the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy
I wanna drug the pussy, then rub the pussy
Louisville Slug' the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy
I wanna drag the pussy, after I bag the pussy
And once I had the pussy, I'm gon' fight the pussy
I wanna pipe the pussy, I might knife the pussy
Shit, snipe the pussy, I wanna fight the pussy</pre>
