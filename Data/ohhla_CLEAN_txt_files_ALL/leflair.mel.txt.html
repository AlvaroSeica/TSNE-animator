[Hodgy Beats]
Ask Clancy if we're hard to manage
From a huddle to a scramble in an omelette sandwich
Your man does damage, for the fuck of it I go on a rampage
I be smokin trees hangin in the fuckin branches
Rasta koala, higher than a Prada
I father these animals across the safari
Desert Sahara my cheese so ricotta
Composing m-musical movement sonora
I'm hotter than lava bitch I need a bottle
of oxygen water out back of Tacoma
Ask me 'bout Tyler I give him a coma
Start runnin game I just pass it to +Domo+
+Genesis+, and +Left Brain+ in this bitch
+Wolf Gang+ nigga fuck a membership
You can ask about Mike G, he'll burn you like a chai tea
That was directed to all the haters bitch I'm Spike Lee

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
We, don't, fuck, with, no-bo-dy
But, you, you, fuck, with, er'-bo-dy, see

[2Left Brain]
We don't fuck with y'all, but y'all fuck with us
Wolf Gang nigga in Odd we trust
Rollin hash, rollin kush
MellowHype bitch, nigga hold up

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm bringin the problems, double entendre
Triple the drama kill your bitch and your momma
Nigga this is an honor, Left produces like a farmer
I'm the guy in the armor armed and ready to harm ya
All these magazines think we fuckin want their cover?
Critics and bloggers fuck and swallow and fuck each other
Get out my face screw your questions now ask another
Me and Left are gettin bread hoe, pass the butter
Corn popped, game's on door locked
Pure crop, smoke up it's a sure drop
I don't play that, flagrant for the playback
You fall back and lay back and stay back you stray rat

[Chorus]</pre>
