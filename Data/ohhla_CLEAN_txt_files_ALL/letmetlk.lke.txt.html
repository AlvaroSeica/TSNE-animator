Hey...hey...

[Timbaland]
(My love...) I love the way you're standin
Lips look so sweet, like cotton candy, whoa!

[Justin Timberlake]
(My love...) That don't mean you gotta stop, dancin
'cause the way that you move is so demanding

[Timbaland]
(My love...) Let's put it on cruise control
Let me take you to the crib, let me ease your soul

[Justin Timberlake]
(My love...) Uh, I gonna take it really nice and slow
{*both*} But first lemme, lemme, lemme talk to her

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
(My love...) Walk into my great place, cozy
I'm glad you came, let's make a toast-a

[Justin Timberlake]
(My love...) Lemme make an indecent proposal
Let me take you to the back and do what we, SUPPOSE to

[Timbaland]
(My love...) Let's take a trip to the bayou
You can be the investigator, I'm your private I/eye

[Justin Timberlake]
(My love...)You know I want a piece of that pie
{*both*} But first lemme, lemme, lemme talk to her

[Chorus 'til next song "My Love" plays]</pre>
