[Chorus X8]
I came I saw I conquered

[Verse 1]
Flawless image of imperfection a living legend
While yall were spitting that garbage I was just busy repping
The truth is inconvenient no intervening enter the booth
Leave your medulla leaking, roogars is squeezing huh
I'm dropping jewels for the people in scientific manner
Fire specific cannons shitting on your propaganda
The chief commander never moving in deceitful manner
Squeeze the blamers if the beef demands it huh
I ain't an actor I don't follow a script
I got hollows for tips that'll make models swallow the dick, shit
No longer chasing thongs they come over here to see me
Shorty better get in line It'll take about a year to see me
A higher level of standards call this the rebel's anthem
Getting you amped like metal hammers mixed with the devil's dandruff
My whole fam's liable amped to fire at you
Dropping you knowledge throwing the Koran and Bible at you

[Verse 2]
Bringing my whole armada the money monopolizer
There's 48 laws of power call me the forty niner
But not from Frisco my nigga don't let the pistol hit you
Just let it bump in your system feel the official hit you
Like an atomic missile hit you I deliver vivid descriptions of my
Reality so you can get the picture
Like pure cocaine, son you can get addicted
No triple beams to measure me you need to get a Richter
Born sinner than meditated to higher levels
Invincibility can't hurt me when you fire metal
Can stop bullets with the palm of my hand
And I speak with strong words cause that's the bond of a man
Multi-faceted they say I'm Voltron in a man
Gohan Super Sayan turn blond when he man
We take it all back fuck it just counting my duckets
Napoleon Da Legend is nothing to fuck with

[Verse 3]
Last of a dying breed fire breathing with iron heaters
Even the Dalai Lama's 3rd eye couldn't perceive him
Even your girl can get it, she sees me she lose control
I'm out to gain the world even risking losing my soul
Armageddon with an army to set it armors and weapons won't stop
Till we palming this cheddar the Legend
Walk like a warrior Wars! Fought like a warrior
Raw! Thoughts of a warrior coming nigga NAPOLEON</pre>
