Here we go again
That's liiiife
Ooh, ooh, ooh, alright
Can't you see that it's rainin? (hol' up)
Can't you see that it's pourin?
They just wanna see rainfall (hol' up)
They just hope that it's stormin
They, always gonna tell you when it rains it pours
Mother Nature's cryin inside
I know I didn't tell you the entire story
But let me finish what happened that night

I was chillin with Frank Thomas the baseball player
You know the the one that played for the White Sox
Uncle Ro and Hurt-M-Badd is how I hooked up with him
Thought he could put us in the right spots
Let me connect the dots, on the Chi block
Had two Cartier rings that was iced out
A secretary named Lorraine that was quite hot
Told me meet him at the studio, 5 o'clock
Tryin to get to the studio
Picked up in a limo, I recorded a demo
And you know my M.O.
H-Town slow it way down, here I picked up the tempo
Thought it was a Benz-o, but he wasn't in a Benz-o
I hopped out the car and Frank saw me
In a parking lot in his Ferrari
He opened the door and the leather was lookin Godly
Real talk, could've cost a mil'
He was back from New York, he had shopped a deal
He met with 'em, talked about my appeal
All the labels were talkin but not for real
Well I think you're wise, and at least ya tried
At least we know that they'll see you rise
At least you're floatin on decent tires
I'm headed home but don't be surprised
That's where I'll be if they want me
They probably don't but just call me
Gave me a couple of stacks because he knew I was headed right back 
to the hood, I think it scarred me
Then I got on the plane
Headed back to Houston like it's part of the game
Gave the money to my mother and she couldn't complain
Then I headed to the Swishahouse and started a flame
Everything started movin up
After high school we was cool enough
I'm like this ain't got nothin to do with luck
I watched Slim and Braceface candy blue a truck
The 3-1-2 what I got to dial
I called Hurt-M-Badd like, "We got a lot to smile
about Hurt, we can make a profit now
I need beats cause we 'bout to put an album out"
That conversation wasn't friendly
Thought he had some beats that he could lend me
But he told me that they have a price tag
And a beat from him would cost 10 G's
That's when my heart turned empty
"I wasn't tryin to get 'em free but didn't think that you would rob me
I recorded all them songs for you and never asked you for a dollar
Now you gonna try to charge me?!"
Click! {*dial tone*}
On the window pane we can all see the rain
Somebody gotta let me know what part of the game
is this, wait, now I got a call from Lorraine
"Hello?" {*phone rings*} "What's up?"
She's no longer workin with Frank at all
And told me the reason she made the call
is to tell what really happened with the major talk
"They liked you Cham and they said you're raw
They liked your music but hated all
the rest of the artist, he told them 'Nah
You wanna sign him? Gotta pay us all'"
I knew that I wasn't ever signed to Hurt
I knew that I wasn't ever signed to Frank
And Frank, he already had a lot of bank
I'm never lettin anyone decide my fate
Who knew that I would do what I do?
Who knew that Michael Watts tried to screw what he screw
Who knew that Ron C was good at screwin it too?
And how can anybody act like they had a clue? True
We wasn't sittin by a stewardess
You wasn't ridin on the tour bus, and it was more than a few of us
I couldn't tell you where the jeweler was
But I could tell you where the sewer was
Labels was pursuin us, switch back to Chicago
Where everybody duck five-oh
And pimps ride fly though
They say "In God we trust" but keep a weapon in the Bible
He said "What it look like Joe?" He was puffin on a green leaf
In the foreign with the cream seats
Matter of fact it was black, he was in the streets knee-deep
Now he the manager for Chief Keef
... Wait, that's Uncle Ro!
The one who used to take me to the studio
The one that used to tag everything we drove
We both somehow made some major dough, whoa
Fast-forward, the man with the curry
We could've sold out to the change in a hurry
I wouldn't have an AMG Benz at 30
I probably woulda never ever made "Ridin' Dirty"
And now they wanna see my +Reign Fall+?
And now they wanna see my name fall?
And now they tell me that I can't ball?
Tell me what is you a lame dawg? Don't you realize I MADE Y'ALL?
Promise I'ma take off, all they do is pretend!
They never really care how many times that you win
Can't do it nine times if you ain't doin it ten
"Chamillionaire, where have you been?"
Here we go again...

Came from the gutter but I made it out
The young CEO with major clout, it's like a major bout
They try to tell me that I'm fadin out
Until I uppercut swing and POW! Bet that erase the doubt
I can hear you haters talkin slick
But why'd you pick the Houston +2Pacalypse+?
Get off my tip, but let me give you all a tip
I never liked y'all, I think you all should quit~!
You're not as rich and plus you the type of prick
to send a girl a text message with a topless pic
You're talkin slick but really you ain't copped them whips
The only time you shop is when you PhotoShop your dick
I park my whip, I might let you cop a flick
See I can spit, you rap but you're not as sick
She's not as thick, your girlfriend is not a chick
Your whole life's a catfish and you do not exist!
Haha</pre>
