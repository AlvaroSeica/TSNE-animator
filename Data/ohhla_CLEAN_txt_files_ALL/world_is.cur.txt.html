Song:   The World Is Yours
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Where haven't we been yet
I'm burnin zig zags watchin scarface til I'm charged to write
in my book of rhymes bout my ridgemont high, fast times
livin in the society of the fly
in gated communities where we now reside
and reminisce on the times when we stood knee high
and the innocence was still in our eyes
Murders wasn't witnessed yet no scandalous bitches yet
niggas wasn't servin life sentences in prison yet
we was barely writin in complete sentences yet
it wasn't all about the benjamins yet
fast forward years later funerals and graduations
subtract a couple of close friends from my equation
now the only thing I got left is the planes man
its gulf strings spitta I reps the planes man
and all the world class bitches love the planes man
but all the jive ass niggas hate the planes man
Fuck em

I said it I meant it I get it I spend it comfortable
livin til the motha fuckin finish
No hand outs cuz niggas don't owe you nothing gotta do it for dolo
flashbacks of the conversation that took place between face and Manolo...
the world chico and everything in it

To calliope dope god bless ya life and to the fallen
soulja slim god bless ya life and to my homie saint Bernard ace
my heart goes out to ya mom that's why I try to call her every mothers day
Shit crazy round my way believe it new Orleans a different club
get shot up every weekend and then come the police men wanna know if somebody seen it
New Orleans crime lab red and blue lights flash
say a prayer for the lost life as I ride pass
but life goes on take a snap from the bong smoke
until we put another hole in the ozone
could ya pass me a lighter set the kush on fire
as I get higher the world seems nicer envisioning a scarface mansion with the tiger
Life is a bitch that's true but sad but you could fuck a freak good if you gotchu some cash now I know why tony wanted it that bad yeeeaaauh

I said it I meant it I get it I spend it comfortable
livin til the motha fuckin finish
No hand outs cuz niggas don't owe you nothing gotta do it for dolo
flashbacks of the conversation that took place between face and Manolo..
the world chico and everything in it

Where haven't we been yet
Fs jets
Welcome to tha winner circle nigga

It's the crescent city bandit hold myself down single handed
when times get hard ya fare weathered friends panic
BORN ALONE DIE ALONE NO OTHER NIGGAS PUT ME ON
I DID THIS ON MY OWN WHAT DIDN'T KILL ME ONLY MADE ME STRONG
critics stop lookin at spitta through hate goggles
cuz what you ignoring is the flow that could save tomorrow
I just live what I spit ride nice stay dipped
picturing me with wack sneaks to make my heartbeat skip
and I'm amped up tryna get my grands up and avoid the handcuffs
caprice classic play the rear cabin like a phantom
I keep it fly airplane style
check the crooked tooth smile plus my wardrobe wild
club round manchild usin dollars to light my stove
ride tha black in tha drop sans top to face the sunrays
plus tha problems of the world today

I said it I meant it I get it I spend it comfortable
livin til the motha fuckin finish
No hand outs cuz niggas don't owe you nothing gotta do it for dolo
flashbacks of the conversation that took place between face and Manolo..
the world chico and everything in it</pre>
