[Saul Williams - singing]
You live, once
You die, once
You work, hard
You hit, hard
And you suffer {*2X*}

You pray, to
Pro-vide, through
The rea-sons
The sea-sons
And you suffer
Is it too much to ask?

All I am saying, is that it's a new day
And I'm gonna live my life, in a new way

You pray, to
Pro-vide through
The seas-ons
The rea-sons
And you suffer
Is it too much to ask?

All I am saying, is that it's a new day
And I'm gonna lift my voice in a new way
It's a new day {*8X*}</pre>
