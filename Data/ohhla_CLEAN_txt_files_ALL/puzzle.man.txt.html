Hook

Cause if it don't feed me I don't need that shit
(I..I came with this puzzle but my piece don't fit)
Born and raised sellin caine and the game don't quit
(I..I came with this puzzle but my piece don't fit)
Its been embedded in my blood since my days as a jit
(I..I came with this puzzle but my piece don't fit)
Been addicted to getting cash since my first lick
(I..I came with this puzzle but my piece don't fit)

Verse 1

I'm only as real as the lies that I tell or the truth that I live 
When I'm talking, I don't say much unless I'm straight with the kids
You wanna see what it is then spend a day with the kid 
But bring your pistol and a dutch and burn a jay with the kid
See where we going its love but niggas get chopped up 
When problems pop up, they lighting the block up
See real niggas dying and the rest getting locked up 
Find yourself in some shit like your toilet done stopped up
But me I gotta plan to catch a bird in the hand 
And stash money in the bush while I'm cheifing on the kush
I need a couple hunnit grand to cop a lil land 
And all the records that I push gone make you pussies douche
And every thing I want ima get it in a minute 
I done had a dirty start, I can't let it be my finish 
I'ma dirty ass nigga, but my dreams legit 
Cause I came with this puzzle, but my piece don't fit

Verse 2

You see I move in small circles and encompass the globe 
'Bout to make money a weapon, plus I'm bout to reload
The other side side of love life is what I got to expose 
I'm tryna unfold your fabric and fill it with holes
Got the mind state of a menace, I'll murder ya shows 
Floss hard without rhyming bout rims or clothes 
That's a given, given a rhythm I'm a kill it with flows 
Then bring back to life with my murderous prose
See I'm a... rapper a man a gee when I gotta be 
Tryna find some harmony with this monster inside of me
Money made me a mad man, music made me a prodigy 
Struggle made me strong and I'm armed without apology
If its not about progress you need to quit...
Cause what you mother fuckers munching on don't make me shit 
Plus I don't really give a fuck, I got to feed my jits
Besides I came with this puzzle, but my piece don't fit

Verse 3

You see my life is composed of good books and cartoons 
Cocaine in the closet and cash in the storeroom
A killer smile lying eyes a tatt and some war wounds
A bid two kids and a road to fortune
See in my mind I was born in a different time 
Where snitching will get you killed and cowardice is a crime
Original was original , that's what made you a criminal 
The world was only a problem until you flip what its given you
And you aint got to take it, but you got to make it 
Its only a cycle til the day you decide to break it
But that aint telling you nothing the truth remains naked 
Real recognize real always will so you cant fake it
And I'm the most hated, but I don't give a shit 
And don't carry on about cause I'm livin' it 
And I aint asking you for nothing while I'm getting it 
And I don't give a fuck about your puzzle if I don't fit in it !!
