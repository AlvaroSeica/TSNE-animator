[Dirt Gritie]   
You know the usual down ass chick and all she'll do for you 
Defuse a few fights before you bruise a dude 
Intelligent and keep the plan on track
She could calm the hulk with her eye contact
When her and I contact it's like, sky rockets in fight afternoon delight 
Perceived to be the best time of our lives 
Interdependent individual minds
Depending on the weather we ride
Together we achieve cause together we strive 
Compromise, telling no lies
But this is not your usual my boo she be so beautiful
Comparing you is like comparing offices to cubicles 
I know that this is new to you a shorty that be truly true 
Other dudes be catching moods when shorty cop an attitude
They holla try to offer her dick 
She shut them down so they call her a bitch, I guess it's
 
[Chorus 1X - K-Riz] 
In this life of sin, where we trust a few
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
Ride for me, I'm a ride for you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend
More than love that I feel for you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
When they turn they backs I can come to you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
 
[Bigga Nolte]            
Body was banging, cocoa butter played her body armor
She was down with honor, anytime I put it on her
Like the marijuana, sweet scents of potpourri 
She holding me, slow jams, so get the Jodeci
She what supposed to be, a girl who never fronts
Quick to hold it down, plus she roll perfect blunts
Smoking the cheeba, we gettin' high off the reefa
My brown skin diva, when it's cold she bring the heater
Lips like Mona Lisa, get cash like she was Visa
Then I light your wrist my princess cause I'm your Caesar 
You know I need yuh, I tell you what I want
We both living luxurious and this is how we flaunt
Me, I push the G5, you could push the coup
The bridge line in the winter time, we both get the loot
I got a boo, I found something true
The nice wife, big life, this is how we do 
 
[Chorus 1X - K-Riz]
In this life of sin, where we trust a few
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
Ride for me, I'm a ride for you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend
More than love that I feel for you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
When they turn they backs I can come to you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
 
[Bridge 1X - Arlo Maverick]           
Me &amp; My, Me &amp; My,
Me &amp; My, Me &amp; My.
Me &amp; My, Me &amp; My,
Me &amp; My, 
Just Me &amp; My Chick.
 
[Arlo Maverick]
Picture if you will, perfection personified
A down ass chick, who will ride or die
Every rapper claim his chick is the realest one
But all I need is a chick who will feel me son
All I need is a chick who will soldier through
And keep her man focused like foldgers do
Mind and body, make the soul complete
You saw a rose, when wanted to bury the concrete
In return I won't abuse yuh, be your producer
Father our seeds, prepare for their future 
You make a soldier wanna (Uh), when we (Uh)
Gimme a second let a brother adjust
Mother of my unborn, and should they come for'im
Mami is a beast ready to hold the pump for'im
Lost in the world wind, me and girlfriend
Never offer honesty unless it's a sure thing
 
[Chorus 1X - K-Riz] 
In this life of sin, where we trust a few
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
Ride for me, I'm a ride for you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend
More than love that I feel for you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend 
When they turn they backs I can come to you
It's just me, Me &amp; My Girlfriend
Me &amp; My Girlfriend</pre>
