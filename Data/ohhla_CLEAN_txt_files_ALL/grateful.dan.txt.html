[Verse 1]
The rewards of praising the Lord
My faith is too strong for y'all to ever ignore
I think about all the things that I've been through
And all of my friends who, smile up in my face and pretend to
Like me, but I get the feeling that they're all sheisty
I'm never mad, He's the best friend I ever had
My Jesus is the only reason I'm forever glad
Even when the weather's bad I give Him the praise
'Cause Lord knows I've had my fair share of rainy days
But He's been with me every step of the way
He's got a set of footprints to the left of me
Without saying a word, I know He's there and that He will never leave
Even when the cops had arrested me
He stood next to me, and what perplexes me
Is that He knows about how much I've sinned, and still I'm blessed
So I'ma sing his praises 'til my death, I'm so grateful y'all

[Chorus: Danny! talking]
I'm so grateful y'all
Can't even get mad at this one y'all
I'm telling you man
I'm just so happy to be here, He's done so much for me
Without Him I wouldn't be anywhere, y'know
Lord I love you

[Verse 2]
I never felt more alive than watching Top Gun
At age 5, I used to fill my pockets with crumbs
By the age of 13 I had pockets full of dreams
To do music, blow up and move units
And I could sell a mil' but still won't come close
To the love I get from You because I need it the most
And I'm just a lad, addicted to the blessings
Especially when I think about the rough times I've had
By any means necessary, I'll let it be known
That with You, I'm never alone
And when I can't explain why, I'll just look to the sky
A couple of raindrops'll fall in my eye, I blink twice
Don't have to swallow my pride, I've got no shame
And I'm always gonna speak Your name
No matter what, if I fail or succeed in this game
I know one thing'll remain the same: and that I'm so grateful

[Chorus]</pre>
