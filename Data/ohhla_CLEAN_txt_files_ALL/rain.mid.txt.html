Typed by: @MidaZ

pay close attention to the rain
that's symbolic of the pain
embrace what its saying as it strikes (as it strikes)
see all my life I was amazed
by the difference in the days
and how the sunshine represents life
the rains a cleansing mechanism
that most protected vision cant escape
do the knowledge to the system that's in place
peep
the water actually rises from below our feet
from off our skin
from out of the ocean to ascend
that's when the sky plays Hercules
and holds that water up
and when its too much to bear that's when it finally erupts
and races back to earth in a rage or a burst
and sometimes
you hardly notice it on ya shirt
but I acknowledge rain as a substitute for pain
so
every time it rains I figure somethings gotta change
but
to acquire change
we must put a plan in motion
keep a hurricane at bay and let it terrorize the ocean
but
if it has to rain
let it wash away whats broken
so the sun can have it rays
start its healing and atonement
please remember when it rains if you get caught up the moment
its OK
that's the way that god tugs at your emotions
when its grey
we can analyze whats standing in our way
while knowing each sunrise will start another day
cause
truth be told sometime you gotta let it rain
some people don't feel they pain till after the first drop
you'll start to feel a change soon after the worst stops
but each particles an article
so it effects lots
its another allegory of the cave
its hard to understand my story when you see me on the stage
but for people to ignore me
or adore me isn't for me
thats my version of pain
thats when I notice the rain</pre>
