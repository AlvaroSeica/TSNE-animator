Typed by: DaSun Akbar

[Gumz]
Yo, uh, yo
Word's visual, open up your eyes for my lyrical
Off beat slang bow down, it's a miracle
A rap verse leave the cat in a hurst
Yo, seeing is believing like you up in a church
Enter the mind of a sick individual
Mental capability, way beyond the physical
Tight casket murderous bastard
6-6-6 on your ass, I ain't asking
Grasping life, hell tight in my clutch yo
Up throw the track and I'm fighting the rush
My heart keeps pounding and I'm hearing the sound
Of a lethal combination lifted up off the ground
This rap shit to me is the illest of drugs
Every time I write it down, yo I write it in blood

[Mista Chorus]
Yo I just found out I'm not the center of the Earth
I'm not worth shit, no purpose, send blues to beast
My feet hit the streets rhythmatic
Old shoes worn down 'cause my story's so graphic
I write classics like Magic, they end tragic
My mind's fragile; don't damage it when you open this package
Underneath the bubble wrap under the Styrofoam
An Al Capone clone; sewed on the microphone
Vision, passion and the wisdom, lost inside the system
Calling my boys 'cause I missed 'em
I'm never ever coming home
I walk these same streets on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I walk alone, yo I walk alone

(Chorus) X2
Metamorph's melting everything in our path
Never last when you clash wit the triple threat
Better recognize when you step, mos def lyrically
Buried outta fucking six foot depth

[Versatile]
Ayo, stop the presses, this kid's cracked to being reckless
Ripping the part of track dispensing the wickedness with
From bobbing their fucking heads to the banging the filthy beat
Decapitating the cats who comprehend how I speak
I'm not your average, ordinary day flow
The goal is to capture the masses
Hold 'em for ransom and off to Mexico
Needle and a haystack shop, never look back
Zoned in and I plan to get me straight to the top
In times we only fold, the weight is over
For the next generation to take it over
So I'ma snatch it and go, roll with the punchers
Take what I can get, forget about the money
Hungry for nothing more, nothing less then the respect
But as it turns out everything is working for this burnout
If you don't like this flow then I'll switch and teach to learn how
And if you didn't notice I got the soul to be known
So it's only right that I go against all the Kings for their throne right?
I'm only joking but I'm so sincere
That I'm kinda serious in a sense that I wanna be clear
That I'm not just here to be in it one minute
Dying the next, 'cause I'm a lab rat
Always will be is on to my death
Music in the blood, flowing like the Red Sea
In creativity is a result of destruction you see
Had a pen and pad with a heart and a soul that is torn
but its goal is to tip minus his finger, that's me
Watch me unfold as I perceive to break it down like a veteran
Yet a rookie who's better then half of these cheddar drive and phony gentlemen
SHIT! Yeah, Versatile, what?

(Chorus) X2</pre>
