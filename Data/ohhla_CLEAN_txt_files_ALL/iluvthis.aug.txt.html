[Intro: August Alsina] + (Trinidad James)
(James, hah, hah) 
Man I love this shit, man I love this shit (okay)
Man I love this shit, man I love this shit
Man I love this shit, man I love this shit (okay)
Man I love this shit, man I love this shit
(Love it, love it, love it - HAH!)

[August Alsina]
It's 2 o'clock and I'm faded, this kush feeling amazin'
Got a voicemail on my phone from a lil' breezy feelin' X-rated
She told a nigga she hurtin', I'm in the car and I'm swervin
I walked into her bedroom, I put it down that's certain
Man I stay on that Ciroc, man I stay takin' shots
May your girl be on my jock, maybe because I'm everything your not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
I'mma real nigga, that's real nigga - I'm just tryin' to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talkin' like this
I'm way too high to be trippin like this
I'm way too young to be livin like this
Ask me why I do it? I'ma put it like this

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Goddammit I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
Goddammit I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
So I'ma keep on drinkin' cause I love this shit
And Ima keep on smokin' cause I love this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin' cause I love this shit
She tell me keep fuckin' cause she love this shit; and I love it

[August Alsina]
Rollin through my hood, rollin' up some good
Shorty lips be rollin' on the wood - damn she rode it good
Rollin over I ain't sleepin over, now she, rollin the eye
Rollin on the floor laughin' cause she, looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block, and I been on that Ciroc
Got your man circlin' your block, maybe because I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no stitch nigga
I'mma real nigga, that's real nigga - I'm just tryin' to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talkin' like this
I'm way too high to be trippin' like this
I'm way too young to be livin' like this
Ask me why I do it? I'mma put it like this

[Chorus]

[Trinidad James]
James, uh...
What you know about love? (Hah) well love know about you
When I try something new, you refuse to believe that my love is true (goddamn)
So I use all I got to prove to you but the proof ain't enough so you move on
to the next dude li-li-li-like "What he gon do?" (Ha)
I don't understand these girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
I don't understand these girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
Lookin' for a real nigga, like in all the wrong places (stupid)
and all the wrong ways; they don't care, they don't change, cause
She gon do what she want and that is okay (okay)
And he gon do what he want and that is okay (okay)
I said I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
He don't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' about it
Love bitch!
