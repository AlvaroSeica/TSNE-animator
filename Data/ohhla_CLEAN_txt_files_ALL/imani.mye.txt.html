[Kam Moye]
It was a summer time thang
Can't believe what happened y'all
I can't believe what happened y'all
It was crazy man
Y'all not gonna believe it man, for real

I met her in the summer of '03 from someone who knows me
Your homie, your OG, your mutual friend
So I pull up in the blue Benz coupe with a friend
One look had me lusting with a Lucifer grin
She was a beautiful jim
Had me suddenly thinking what I could do to two of you if baby you had a twin
And get the sheets wet, now that's some freak shit
I'm thinking triple X and we ain't even speak yet
My homeboy introduced us and then we got acquainted
She said her name was Imani, her momma was a native
of the West Indies, where the best women be
I'm staring up and down thinking yes indeed
She ain't never been back since they relocated
I'm thinking to myself "It's a small world, ain't it?"
She that said she was out in Raleigh three days, bored
Until her best friend took her out and she payed for it
Then the beat came on, they proceeded to get down
to the underground sound of DJ Forge
I'm like "word?", oh that's my homeboy
If I ever get a chance I'ma take him on tour
Then we clicked from that point, I gave her my number
and my email address, call me whenever's best
We can cupcake all day or love make all night
Either way, to set it off it takes one call right?
Everything was alright, perfect combination
with the killer conversation, we can talk like two teenagers
Dazed in a junior high crush
But I'm no schoolboy, girl it's you that I lust
I just started trying all type of cool stunts
Sick of dry humping, I'll be damned it's been two months
What you want, a man or a minister?
I don't want to plan nothing sinister
I don't want to ram nothing into you cause you know plenty simpletons 
I want to get busy to some Minnie Riperton
I ain't impotent, a brother got sex temptations
All I want is an explanation, complex or basic
She looked me in the eyes and immediately I could see the hesitation
She said "Two and a half months before I met you
I was sleeping with an NBA player's nephew
He treated me wrong and cheated repeatedly
Said he never needed me and then you came to the rescue
You was so special, I ain't wanna miss out
I'm sorry Kam but I'm three months with child"
I'm thinking Lord I know this ain't a Maury Povich
daytime soap opera and the shit's wild
My perfect woman was gonna be accompanied
by a baby in her stomach, I need to sit down

Damn, what would you do?
She's pregnant by another man before you even met her
I feel shallow if I just leave her like that
But my family would tell me I'm a damn fool if I stay with her too
Wow, what would you do man?</pre>
