[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wildin'
He look to God but can't find him
So he demands silence from the glarin' sirens
The sympathy symphony
Only thing playin' is the mad violence
No lyin' niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn ya molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye em' they get the wrong message
Wrong methods put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me "more dress-up" I'm givin' too many lectures
And I'm puttin' in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like they gon' catch up fuck what you must heard
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listenin' to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressin' and shine, it's fine

[Hook: Joey BADA$$]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and what not
The motto never changed it's still fuck cops
We went from havin' lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs is hot whenever we puff pot
We touch blocks and end up havin to duck shots
But fuck that, ain't tryna live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can't be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest's opinion
Knock the hinges off of Heaven's gates
Tryna share my cells with' my mate
Not share a cell with' mates
Wreckin' shit with' my recklessness
The L get lit that's when I start second guessin' shit
Thinkin' 'bout Tot and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could've fucked me over
Never nigga guess again
I'm street so cross me like pedestrians
And that's gon be your end of it
Straight revokin' your membership

[Hook: CJ Fly]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kid
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna know what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the golden chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]
Niggas wanna know what I'm about
I'm bout blowin' loud on the block sporty
GLOCK 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out
Commission with' my composition
Who the kid spittin' behind the bars
Like a con position
Gotta give 'em time to listen
They'll soon bump to it they'll like me
I kick it like Nike they'll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain't mad at you I keep my attitude on
"screw it, million bucks should do it"
I'm out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me
Who the bestest MC?
They be mentioning me; too hot, I be molestin' the beat
Fuck math, teachers should teach us to get Smith &amp; Wessons off the street
So first class be a lesson from me
Fuck what you teachin' for some regents, I'm flyin' over regions, reachin'
All time highs where Jesus can't reach us
Step to me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers
Hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot
GLOCK cocked watchin' out for cops
All about they cheddar
Young guns know nothin' that's better
Like fuck a prison letter
Those Berettas led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces
Want the senator's percentages
If you ain't prejudiced you still a nemesis
Smokin' on the Clematis
Get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linkin terrorists from the Stuy then Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit
They leave you left for the dead
Kids don't play they'll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slingin' some reds
Poppin' some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasin' the feds
I be back stage grippin' haze breakin' my leg
My folks was makin' the best
When they was naked in bed, muthafucka

[Hook: Joey BADA$$]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids

But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this </pre>
