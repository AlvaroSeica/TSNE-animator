[dialogue from the movie "12 Monkeys"]
"Look, have any of you heard of The Army of the 12 Monkeys?
 They, they paint this.
 They, stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere.
 Have you seen this?"
"Mr. Cole?"
"Have you seen this?"
"Why don't you just take your time,
 and try to explain this whole thing from the beginning."

[GMS]
I'm tired of hearin about your theoretical skills
Like underground was a miracle pill like you lyrically ill
You could get offered a deal for three quarters a mil'
and still suck like you underwater breathin through gills
You enter every battle tryna get a few kills
Get a few thrills and can't write a song that'll sell a few mil's
You could join Cypress Hill and NEVER +B-Real+, better to chill
The Plague spread and will increase your medical bills
You worthless (hey) we above the clouds and beneath the surface
in each state, city, borough, town where CD's get purchased
Even if we re-word this these words'll leave you nervous
Don't ask, don't tell faggot or you'll be asked to leave the circus

[Pumpkinhead]
It's The Plague man, beatin us is dead like a graveyard
Don't get your head chopped off like "Braveheart"
The 12 Monkey Army, move like a bunch of zombies on Harleys
We the +Angels+ of apocalypse, not Charlie's
I'm the type to beat down a car thief
with my son's car seat, and stop his heartbeat (b-boom, b-boom)
Y'all don't want beef, y'all all weak, we twelve deep
Night of the creeps, we patrol your streets
Don't make me blam your team up - you ain't tough!
You a +Warrior Princess+ like Xena with C-cups
R&amp;B diva on this beat I back clean up
And got black kids jumpin like the cast of "Sarafina!"
12 Monkeys is the clique, biohazard's the symbol
Y'all fools ain't nimble, your rhymes is simple
Don't Erick Sermon your career, it's flyin out the window
How many ways to end you, offend you?
Quadruple, six million, reptilian
Cold-blooded chameleons hangin from the ceilin
I paralyze myself, just to kill you with no feelin
Eel skin scaly, move like Hailey's Comet
through the projects, flying objects
In a cockpit with Davy Crockett rockets
Cock and bust it, double-barrel musket
That could cut down a grizzly to the size of a Teddy Ruxpin

[Blitzkrieg]
Uhh, Blitz, yo
Lightin in, I strike in the wind, I strike and I win
I might get some Henn' and I'll strike on a whim
Ya hype man hypin at you and I'm hypin at him
Brooklyn belongs to us, I got a RIGHT to defend
I'm terrific with the freestyle in spite of the pen
You hear a freestyle, go home and write it again
So when I go right past the writin and go right to your chin
Those odds swell up, develop, bruise and then tighten the skin
You might be a Mighty Mouse but fightin mightier men
We ride in custom choppers with twins, you bikin on Schwinns
We got custom twin choppers that could chop off your limbs
This the beginnin for us, for you a frightenin end
Blitz!

[Kameel-Yen]
It's the, beat's perfection I'm speech injectin
With inflection to make men reach erection
Put a tec to them wanna-bes, haters and yes-men
Spread quick dead shit, kill 'em off from infection
It's not just an expression sayin we're +Lethal Weapon+
Plus it's still packed, don't stink, seed insection
Give your man drugs, get cops to arrest me
Gangrene boys in blue is your only protection, c'mon

[Wild Child]
Watch out now!
It's so tragic how I add another cadaver quick
You think I'm on some magic abracadabra shit?
Half of you scatter, half of you rappers attract to it like mag-nets
Don't have to straight up smash my elaborate lab
within my labyrinth - The Plague
Collaborative narratives assassinate you characters
Even the baddest kids disbarage when I carry 'em
like Passion of Nazareth, it's so embarrassin
So amateur, low caliber, no stamina
Too often awful off and on camera
Before my primates get irate
You better peel cause we hungry like seven plus five apes

[Pumpkinhead - singing]
Rosario Dawson, you know you're my boo (my boo)
I saw "Alexander" and "Kids", I'm fallin for youuuu
And I know tomorrow, you'll still be the same
Cause you got some big ass jugs, girl don't even change cause
Eeeee-veryyyyy day, I think of your boobs in my face
Put 'em on the glass and make 'em shake, with a smile
Take time to tell me (to tell me) you'll really care
And we can sip this bottle, togetherrrrrr

Foreeeeeeeeeeeeverrrrr... touchin your boobs {*laughs*}</pre>
