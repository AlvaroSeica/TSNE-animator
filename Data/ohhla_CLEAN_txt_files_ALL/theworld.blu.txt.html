[Verse 1]
I'm tryna get to this place that my grandpa told me bout as a child
Told me only a few could make it and the fakest aint allowed
Be a star out your game and aim above the clouds
and if you miss, youll at least be amongst your own crowd
I smiled cause now I see what he meant
I see it in the eyes of mothers when they uncover there sins and repent
Gettin closer to Jehovah on their own knees bent
Praying our mindframes switch and these times change quick
But I hate to say it brother
Youre just too stubborn, to stuck on them selves to ever think about others
They must uncover the scales on their eyes called lies
Leading to deaf them and blind like my mom told me bout
Where their sins get cleansed...Cause they bathe in flames
And the only route out is to shout out his name
I was trained to be a soldier for god
But as soon as I used my own thoughts I kinda got lost
In this smog called reality
Where hell is a fallacy and Heaven is a fantasy created by man 
so don't believe in it
Came in here with nothing then your leaving with
nothing so retreat from this
world of deceit
but for my people it's time to rise
realize theres a heaven whether you think it's inside or in the sky
we gotta reach for it before it's gone eternally
and you stuck here below the heavens for eternity

*CHORUS* X5
Whos world is this
The...woooo-ooorld 

[Verse 2]
Yo, somebody once told me that I'm already in hell
Freedom's a state of mind it's just a heart of me's in hell
I freed my slaved mind so the part of me's in hell
So even when it's hard to breathe a part of me inhales
So pardon me...
you gotta try hard to be yourself...
cause you cant go to heaven being anybody else
I was raised by a reverand yet the lessons didnt help
had to get em for myself
I was told hell is hot I had to fell it for myself
so I left home 
as a young child smiling as I stepped on
facin a world butt naked without my wea-pon
I lost my smile and exchange put a vest on
now that my premature stress is gone 
I got problems to face as a man
I was told either you stand or you fall
long as you know that when you walk yo holding hands as a god
that alone can turn the dark 
into a walk in the park
I only talk from my heart 
so open yours when your listening
every man has his own heaven
the difference is the way that he envisions it so....
if you make your heaven pictureless
by the time you die youll be drifting in an imageless field
so fill your heaven full of blessing thoughts 
thats real 
you could stress it or just let it walk
I got a question if a man can make his own heaven
then can he make his path to get to it too
I only spit fluid truth
and I spit it for the listenas so Im spittin to you
you say it's hell I say it's bullshit were getting through
just think about it any man has his own heaven
but you gotta go through hell to be a man first
and understand 1st hell is what you choose to call the present
thats why youre going through what I just choose to call a stressin
to tell you fools the truth
I don't feel it's what I'm destined
you can call it hell but brah...
I can say Im below the heavens

*the Woooo-oooooooorld* (X 10)
