(*talking*)
You on deadly ground, Boss Hogg Corleone
Alias the Black Osama, Mike D nigga
They don't like that naw-naw, they don't like that
Check game nigga uh, say uh uh 

[Mike D]
I give you dap with my right hand, never with my left hand
S.U.Cizzle, I'ma rep till the death and
Holla at my folks and, get em with my locs and
I'm a Boss Hogg man, rolling with top down
Up in the cockpit, dropping my shit
Got sixteen switches, so I'm hopping my shit
I'm a old school nigga, folding new tops down
Pulling up on the block, and knocking it to the ground
They see me balling out here, throw me a bet
Don't worry about it, you'll up it once I show you the tech
I'll either blow off your neck, fingers in your bitches
Don't sweat it lil' homie, I'll snatch it out your teeth-es
It's Don Dada, Michael Corleon
A problem you dealing with, nigga head on nigga

(*talking*)
Get at me nigga, yeah it's whatever
It's the Don Corleon, I'm crazy then a motherfucker
Look close around nigga, it's the tre way or no way huh

[H.A.W.K.]
This ain't D-Block it's me block, where niggaz got heat cocked
See cops in treetops, and put our sweets out
Hustle so vigorous, we carnivorous
And still we pray to God, to deliver us
That's why I'm thankful, although my life is painful
No matter what has happened, I will never be shameful
3rd Ward born, Dead End raised
Glocks and K's, done led to many early graves
That's why these blunts are blazed, take me back to better days
Afros and leather days, most niggaz had waves
Niggaz had better ways, hustle for new J's
But the new J's, got a few catch phrase
And when the laws raid, niggaz'll hide for days
It's like a line moment, where the cattle breeze
Up at Breeze Ways, on the lookout
And go to Blue's house, Blue pulled the bible out
Here's a survival route, that can change your life
Lose the street life, and find Jesus Christ
Before you lose your life, I know Blue was right
So I changed, and now I see the light
And now I bite mics, to satisfy my appetite
I'm gonna win this fight, and bring the hood back to life
From boys to men, to my niggaz in the Penn
I'm all in, with my niggaz from the Dead End</pre>
