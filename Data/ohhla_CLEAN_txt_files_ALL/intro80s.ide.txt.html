[Freeway Ricky Ross]
Yeah, you know who it is
It's yo' man Rick Ross
Freeway Rick
Givin a shoutout to my nephews, Identical
Y'all keep doin your thing man
We about to take this game over just like we did in the 80's
This time it's gon' be the movies, the records
FreewayEnterprise.com for life
Get on board
In 1982, Identical was born
Destiny, to take over this rap game
Rick Ross I'm out

[Identical]
Identical in this bitch got 'em sick like the bird flu
Got rick quick you would think that the birds flew
Must be out your mind if you think I won't shoot
Roll with so many Bo's, they call me Luke Duke
It's a +Hazzard+, you cool with that, I'm goin to the county
Niggaz be snitchin I don't need that around me
I'm a W-E-E, D-Boy
Cain't slang if I don't know you, feds send decoys
They say property of Mexico, you really coppin bags
Bust that bitch open, now that's poppin tags
With connects on lawyers, drugs and weapons
Hustle so hard you'd think we taught dance lessons
