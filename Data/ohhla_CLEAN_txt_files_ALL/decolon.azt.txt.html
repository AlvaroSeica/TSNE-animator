AUG's on the scene with a vengeance
No man or law can end this
Power, in a true sense of the word
Now it's time that my people be heard
Some feel this oppression no longer exists
Well here's something they missed
Self D means self determination
To put a stop to colonization
We begin with a historical analysis
To illustrate a Mexican paralysis
See Mexico's been occupied since 1848
Which left the mexicano at a constant 2nd rate
Now learn the word called colonization
Stranger in your own land under exploitation
This is the state of the indigena today

Under the oppression of the settlers way (2x)

WE DIDN'T CROSS THE BORDERS, THE BORDERS CROSSED US! (3x)
YET THE SETTLER NATION LIVES IN DISGUST!
The American dream only for some
Play the role and forget where you came from
Now check it, this is their reality
And just because its wasp holds no validity
WASP-White Anglo Saxon Protestant
The frame of mind that keeps our oppression constant
You try to be white and its very respectable
But be Xicano and its highly unacceptable
Then we're termed hispanic as if we were from Spain
Trying to insert us in the American game
And we're called wetbacks like we've never been here
When our existence on this continent is thousands of years
This is the state of the indigena today

Under the oppression of the settlers way (2x)

WE DIDN'T CROSS THE BORDERS, THE BORDERS CROSSED US (3x)
YET THE SETTLER NATION LIVES IN DISGUST Â­ repeat
To the earth, to the air, to the fire, and to the water....
The eagle and condor have met
We must realize
Our connection to this land
Till a Hopi and a Mexica can really understand
That invaders divided indigenous people
Under english, french, or spanish it make us all feeble
Unable to recognize each other
From Xicano to Lakota all sisters and brothers
In the spirit of Pontiac, all the red keepers of the earth mother
From the top of Alaska to the tip of South America
Abya Yala, Anahuak, Turtle Island
506 years of indigenous resistance
The prophecies are coming true
The redemption of the red people has come!
The 6th sun now arises
The 7th fire has arrived
Cihuatl is reclaiming
We have returned to Aztlan
We have returned to Aztlan!!!!
WE DIDN'T CROSS THE BORDERS, THE BORDERS CROSSED US (3x)
YET THE SETTLER NATION LIVES IN DISGUST!!
GET THE FUCK OUT, GET THE FUCK OUT, GET THE FUCK , FUCK, FUCK OUT
GET THE FUCK OUT
WASICHU EATER OF THE FAT WASTER OF EARTH MOTHER
AND PEOPLE
COLONIZER OF AZTLAN AND THE WORLD
GET THE FUCK OUT!!!!</pre>
