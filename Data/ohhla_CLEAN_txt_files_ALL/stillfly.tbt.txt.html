[Baby] Whassup Fresh? It's our turn, baby

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits (With the Gucci suits)
Ain't got no job, but I stay suave (Ehh-Ehh Ehh-Ehh, I stay suave)
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent (I can't pay my rent)
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly (Uh, Uh, Damn! Cause I'm so fly)

Got a quarter tank of gas - in my new E class (In my E-Class Benz)
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride (mmm-hmm)
Got everythang - in my momma name (We got everythang, in my momma name)
But I'm Hood Rich - dadah-dadah da-dah da-dah da-dah (Uh-Huh!)

[Baby]
Get your k-uh, k-uh-car, play gems gone shine
And tell momma get a mink - baby girl let's ride (let's ride)
You a number one stunna, and we gon' glide
and go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
Do that Prada, Gucci, full length leather
Bourbon's cool or Coogi sweater (sweater)
Twenty-inches pop my feather
The Birdman daddy I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is So Fly
Number one don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that nigga
The k-uh, k-uh-Coogi with the matchin interior
Three wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunna, and we like brothers
We shine like paint daddy; it's our summer

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly

Got a quarter tank of gas - in my new E class
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride
Got everythang - in my momma name
But I'm Hood Rich - dadah-dadah da-dah da-dah da-dah

[Mannie Fresh]
Have you ever seen a crocodile seats in the truck
Turn around sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma - player, is where you can find me?
Cruisin through the parking lot on twenty fours
(Coming Through The Hood On 'Em Twenty Fo's)
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot 
Put the Caddy up, start the three wheel Benz (Skiiiiiirt!)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Suma-tuma tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go (uh-uhhh), "Boy can you top that?"
I'ma show you some shit - rookie press that button
The trunk went (Ehh-Ehh) and all of a sudden
Four fifteen's - didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom!) from the amplifiers

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly

Got a quarter tank of gas - in my new E class
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride
Got everythang - in my momma name
But I'm Hood Rich - dadah-dadah da-dah da-dah da-dah

[Baby]
(ay, ay, ay, ay)
Lemme slide in the Benz (Shit!) with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes -- Drinkin the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man - I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck 24's with 10's

[Mannie Fresh]
Looking at my Gucci - it's about that time
Six bad broads flying in at nine
New Suburban Truck with the porno showing
Up and down {*orgasm*} and up they go and..

[Baby]
Bodies on the Roadster - Lexus you know what?
That hard-top beamer (ay, ay) yo Ma', that's your truck
I'm comin up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly (bubbly)

[Mannie Fresh]
Four-thirty Lex with the convertable top
And the rims keeps spinning everytime I stop
Got a superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a ol' school Caddy with a "diamond in the back"

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly

Got a quarter tank of gas - In my new E class
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride
Got everythang - in my momma name
But I'm Hood Rich - dadah-dadah da-dah da-dah da-dah

{*Scratches*}
The Number One Stunna Pimp
