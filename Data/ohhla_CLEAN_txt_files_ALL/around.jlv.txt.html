[J-Live]
Yeah... Uh... 
Yo, it went from Africa to Port-au-Prince to Knoxville, then I come in
Manhattan, South Bend, Albany, BROOKLYN!
Philly, back to Harlem and, now we in the ATL
Where it stops, don't nobody know, +It Ain't Hard to Tell+ (Word to Nas)
Underall, around the sun ain't nothing new
You take yourself wherever you go 
and I get +Nuttin' But LOVE+ when I'm comin through
And like, Heavy D, heavily, classics, but +You Ain't Heard Nuttin Yet+
Don't open the oven yet, boiling cheese, let the dough rise up
Please size up emcees like lumberjacks do
trees and states where they legalize weed - OH WHEE~!
Peace to the family with relative ease
From blood seed to 120 degrees
Bachelor's, Master's, knowing what's faster
The speed of sound or the speed of light
The speed of mind or the speed of life
The key to life, opening doors like hot water opens your pores
And swift wisdom giving your pause
Something change the roof or applause, yeah
Rearrange the bull like the draws in your dressing drawers
I juggle the flow, easy as you walk and chew gum but jaws won't stop
Don't even try to front like your jaws won't drop
By the time you press pause, we done hit fast-forward
Bandwagon making express stops, all aboard, let's go!</pre>
