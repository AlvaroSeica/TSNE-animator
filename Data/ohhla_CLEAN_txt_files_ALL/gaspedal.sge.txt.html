[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
Slow down, grab, the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass, fall off (ass, fall off)
Hella thick, I wanna smash, 'em all
Now, speed up -- gas pedal 
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Now, speed up -- gas pedal 
Gas pedal, gas pedal

[Sage the Gemini]
Ay you already know me; S-A-G-E
Look, uh...

Black money let them hoes say "amen"
I'm just tryna make it clear boy, Ray-Bans
I'm a great man, woah, say a friend
I play a hole every night DJ - amen
Room full of boppers, tell them give me topper
Beat it, beat it up, 9-1-1, hit the coppers
I'm S-A-G-E, you would like to know
Fee-fi-fo-fum, large meat in your throat, heh
West-side baby do what you do
And you got tail, what that shit do?
Its, pretty nigga mob, thats the way that I grew
I be steppin' up in the club they make 'em drop to my shoe
And her dude mad cause I spooned, but I don't give a fork
Silverware a nigga out if he actin' a poor spork
You's a dork; grab a girl and get a yank-in'
Got a booty like coupes I'm tryna make-it, woah

[Chorus]

[IamSu!]
Uh, she a trick for a dolla bill
And her boyfriend a bitch, call him Tyler Perry
Eugh, I'm in the black bat lookin' scary
On my way to the cake, no bake-ery
Oops, bakery, never been no fakery 
Lead her to the bathroom, she askin' where you takin' me
Uh, tell her slow down baby
I'm too turned up it's finna go down baby
When you hit the stage the people do a 180
When I hit the stage man the club wanna pay me
Uh, you niggas so fugazi
Got a white bitch with me call that ho Slim Shady, uh
Nigga 'Su so crazy
Got two hoes with me make my old bitch hate me, uh
All about my payment
You say we gettin' money that's an understatement uh

[Chorus]

[Sage the Gemini]
Lil' mama got sex appeal (sex appeal)
I make her sing if she wanna get a record deal (record deal)
What the shit do? (Do) it's finna get real
She got a booty so big it's like a ferris wheel (yo)
Lil' mama got sex appeal (where's that at?)
I make her sing if she wanna get a record deal (you, can't do it with your boyfriend?)
What the shit do, it's finna get real
She got a booty so big it's like a ferris wheel (you know what I am)
