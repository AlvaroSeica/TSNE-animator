Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
I'm home for good
'll be a shootout, they try to summon me back
Take a hint, strive for what you wanna get
Cuz if it's blood, that they want
Then it's blood, what they gotta get

[Solomon Childs]
The year of '88, Special Ed &amp; Big Daddy Kane
Momma had two jobs, and got there whether snow, sleet or rain
Thank you for sending me to church, with my cousins Glendall &amp; Dame
Who ever thought, I'd give you so much pain
From on the blocks styling, to in &amp; out of Riker's Island
Where I stay in the box, it wasn't more than an idea
I had to cheat my options, at the same time
The penal changed my life
Taught me how your wife can turn crooked
Puerto Ricans taught me how the coke sizzle when you cook it
First bid, all the way upstate, pressure from the gate
Inmates, scheaming on my thirty five pounds
Police looking to put one in your back
And to catch you out of bounds, man, man, come on

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
The year is '96
Back on the block hood, looking to get rich
You bitch ass police told all by snitch
Younger words went to the feds
This year, we lost alotta track heads
And as time went on
I'm taught to teach when the dark read
Man, listen, can tell you about some hard times
I'll tell you about some hard crimes
My first daughter already three
And on my second felony, I was being found guilty
Back up north, stressed out on the yard
On lowback, cuz I had an asshole foot on the back
But this time it was a lot different
No sweatsuits or Reebok classics
I had to rob and poke these bastards
Muthafucka...

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
The year of 20-04
And I ain't been back in a minute, hoe
Bitch ass slow down on crime
Some say I got a more positive mind
But that ain't what it is
Learned how to do the crime the quiet way
The ski-mask way, this dedicated
To the memories of Cooper, Damian Faye
K-Barge, Jamaican Shawn
Tank, and the god Inf
And the moral of the story is this
Though we all gon' plead the fifth
But you can be whatever you is
You live it, but nobody take none from you
If you work so hard to gain it

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
