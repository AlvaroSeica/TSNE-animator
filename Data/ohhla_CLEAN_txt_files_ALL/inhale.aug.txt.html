Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Baby take it in slow
Don't rush you don't wanna choke
I know you say that it's your first time
But I wanna see how far this goes
Let it fill you
Hold it in, take it down
I'm tryin take you to another level
Baby till you feel it come down

Don't it feel so good
Took it like a G, like I knew you would
Didn't really freaking go again
I know you can go and blow again
So baby inhale
Baby inhale

[Chorus]
There really ain't a limit
To where you have to go
So you can take it deeper
Girl all you need to know
Is how to inhale

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and lick the swisher
Don't be scared to let it hit you
What's the flavor when you kiss it
'Cause you're sayin so delicious
Now you take it to the head like a pro
And you just go and get it till you feel it in your throat
I'm a light it for you ball it when you put it on your looks
Cross a lot when you hold it baby girl you got a grip

Don't it feel so good
Took it like a G, like I knew you would
In a minute we can go again
I know you gon wanna blow again
So baby inhale
Baby inhale

[Chorus]
There really ain't a limit
To where you have to go
So you can take it deeper
Girl all you need to know
Is how to inhale</pre>
