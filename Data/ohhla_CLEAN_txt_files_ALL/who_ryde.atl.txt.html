[Intro: Km.G Whispering on the Mic ]
Here it is y'all, right here
Lyrics let the nigga join that demon shit
So I guess.. I just have to join that game
Damn I've admired every touch of that shit
Come on with me

[Km.G]
Tack me baby, get me up, H-Nigga in the front
Me trade and me packed and me stay strapped
Bail and hangin, doin' a little gang with my niggaz
While we flirt with some skirts, you know, some herpes
But we stay with it, yeah, we flip it
We find us, a motherfuckin' Chevy then we dip it
Then they asked me: why you're in the game?
Rollin' S-class, helpin' Kokane

[Kokane]
Yeah, see you're lookin' at my hoochie it's about that time
That me rollin' with my clique
Pimp Clinic hittin' Dolo sticks
Cause bitches be sayin: Aiy, Mr. Gold Wire player
Won't come out to be my whore layer
Nah bitch, I be sittin' at the Dr. Coffee
Hatin' for the snow to roll in or split in
It's Kokane A.K.A. the black hopper
Surrounded by the black gangsters with triple beamers
Cause sometimes it gets so hard to slang your style
What you said Km.G?

[Km.G]   Chocolate Nuts
[Kokane] What you got Km.G?
[Km.G]   Big brown Chocolate Nuts
[Kokane] What we got Km.G?

[Km.G]
Chocolate Nuts
And I'm lookin' for them hookers with them big Chocolate butts
Take up get naked while we laugh about my jail record
Diggin' the drawers girl, so check it
As I flow watch my bottom drop
And I be fillin' my tap, hittin' you up on your block

[Chorus: Kokane Chanting X2]
Hard hard hard, hard hard hard, hard hard hard
Everyday there's a change

[Cold 187Um]
They wanna stop Gangster Rap but they're kind of late
Cause I've been kickin' Gangster shit for seven years straight
And best believe makin' the end
Ugh, puttin' in work for my niggaz in the Pen'
Cause see, once upon a time I had a cabin sack
I start flossin' and flossin' and never got tracked
Smokin' weed everyday
And make the funky beats for my niggaz around the way
Yeah, now I think I'm worked millions
And your white folks mad cause I'm sellin' to your childrens
By the house and by the key
They don't wanna be like Mike, they wanna be like me
What's happenin' in the ghetto ain't happenin' anywhere
And upon California not any where
So boo yaa, boo yaa, boo yaa, what's happenin' partner?
Ugh, I'm all in this track and I'ma break you off somethin' proper
Cause I'm the C-O-L-D, original 187 in the place to be
So when you see me, you better give me my props
Or get popped by the .44 and land out in Shot sippin'
And for me, see that's a promise, I ain't trippin'
Boy, I'm just honost, ugh

[Chorus: Kokane Chanting X2]
Hard hard hard, hard hard hard, hard hard hard
Everyday there's a change

[Tone Loc]
I kick back, relax, cause I'm fat and all that
When I attack, it's like a swing of the Baseball bat
Known to force me, cause I live my life coastly
If I had a ringer I'll be around rosily
Lived my early years straight like a Hoodlum
No time for women cause I've never understood that
They wanted to hold me, stretch me in Coupe De
Rather have my forties than just prove at my Hoopty
Comin' down your block, your street, comin' down your avenue
Check that gratitude, check my attitude
You wanna run up, you got your gun up
Fool, what's up? - Shit, your bet not even hick up
Cause if you do, I'm break your jaw
Loc, Kokane and Above the Law
Puttin' in work like some more Vietnam vets
What we set, gettin' more more respects
But residentials as individuals sad as pitiful
That you can get a hook
Of Tone Loc kickin' that raw shit for your life
West Side Swap Meet, and Black Mafia Life

[Chorus: Kokane Chanting X2]
Hard hard hard, hard hard hard, hard hard hard
Everyday there's a change</pre>
