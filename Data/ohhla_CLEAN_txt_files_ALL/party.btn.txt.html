Heard ye yo, on the motherfuckin' mix
Aight...

Yo !
Beatnuts...

I'm like Conan dusted in a Cadillac raw hand
Makin'an assault with detail program
Aggravated the party a little
Leave the whole place full of riddle,
Hardcore to the middle
Big Jus, Psycho Les &amp; Skribble
A nigga really stars fallout
And leave the rap game cripple.
Beatnuts forever, die hard, you know the model,
Shut the hell up then and buy another bottle.
Get the party started correct-
ly the whole place breaking their neck
It's the beatnuts, what you expect ?
Like tu-tu-du and all that shit,
Summer splash it's beatnuts with a smash hit.

Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !
(after the) Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !

Beatnuts, a.k.a. the Trackmasters
Sit at the table like fat mobsters,
We bang our ??? that make you jump like grasshoppers,
We blast cupboards (blaw !)
Tryin' to shut down the grass rosters,
We stack posters like bank robbers
It's the real 3, Ju Les and Willy
Straight from the Q, U, Double E
N, S, 
Once again it's
The man it's
The society you all keep eyin'me,
Buyin'me drinks,
Like she wants me to do her grand opening.
I'm hoping she's a pit fighter
Imaginin' Big Cyke inside her
Bangin'it out like a rhinoceros
Yo who got the trees I wanna light up for us
Who want test Les get left in a mess
Take this to the head, fuck the vest
Tryin'a duck less, screaming for your grandmother
Hook the phone like "I know what you did last summer"	

Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !
(after the) Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !

I tear it up when I head it up 
Like hurricane stuff,
Keep it smooth like pearl jam bugs,
Make you fiend like drugs.
Scheme like thugs with  tight mobs
We pitfight all bitches that call us scrubs
Triple one's on my back
??? guns on my chest
Beatnuts stay hot to death
Fool for the chef
Who do the best ? Call me your highness
Cause when you find this I'm probably blinder than the smoke	
Chillin'in miami drinkin heinys on the ???
Yo the streets are wild, I never let'em see me smile
Love this hip hop shit since I was a child, juvenile
Tryin'a make money by the p???

Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !
(after the) Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !
Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !
(after the) Paaaaarty !
We're gonna have a oooorgy !

Check it, check it, check what I say
I'm so great, I'm so great
Check it, check it, check what I say
I'm so great, I'm so great

Don't let'em see you smile...</pre>
