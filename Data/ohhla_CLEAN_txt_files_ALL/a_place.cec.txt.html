[Intro]
Let's go
Welcome to paradise
I know you want a place like this
You want a place like this
Come on, that's right
Grits and CeCe let's go
We want a place like this
Do you wanna go yeah
Come on
 
[Verse 1: Cece Winans]
I had to get away
Find some time to pray and assess my life
As good as it can be it's sadly incomplete with all this pain inside
Now its so beautiful hereany time of year
All the waterfalls and streets of gold
Are those angels I hear singing I want a

[Chorus: Cece Winans]
I want a place like this that I can call my own
I want a place like this where I will never be alone
I want a place like this where I can finally be free
I want a place like this made especially for me
Heaven is where I want to be

[Verse 2: Cece Winans]
IT'S PARADISE I KNOW I WANNA PLACE LIKE THIS
Where all your dreams come true do you wanna go
There way upon a hill That's where joy lives with happiness
And down milk and honey way
Lives a brighter day next to love overflowing
A picture perfect scence so calm and serene
Where paradise begins life will never end Are those angels I hear singing

[Chorus: Cece Winans]
I want a place like this that I can call my own
I want a place like this where I will never be alone
I want a place like this where I can finally be free
I want a place like this yeah this is where I wanna be
I want a place like this that I can call my own
I want a place like this where I will never be alone
I want a place like this where I can finally be free
I want a place like this made especially for me
I wanna place like this for you and me
 
[Verse 3: Cece Winans]
Where we can be free
I can't wait to dance through waterfalls and skate through the streets of gold oh yeah
I wanna place like this for you and me
Where we can be free
Can't wait to sing laugh and play
Hear the bells ring let's go ring

[Coffee]
Hope you're open to focusing on the afterlife
I am don't have to ask me twice
Getting in though I paid half the price
Stayed til my way was made, Learned the facts of life
Play it cool in here never be alone
Place you can call a home
Spot thats all your own
And be free Grits and CeCe on point again It's all bliss my friend
In a place like this again

[Cece Winans]
It's where I wanna be I wanna be
It's where I wanna be I wanna be
I wanna place for you and me yeah
La la la la la
Free free free ah get my singin on
I wanna place for you and me where we can be free la la la la la
Free free free free yeah
 
[Chorus: Cece Winans]
I wanna place like this I want a
I want a place like this that I can call my own
I want a place like this where I will never be alone
I want a place like this where I can finally be free
I want a place like this I wanna place like this</pre>
