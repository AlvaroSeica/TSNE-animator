[Intro]
Yeah, uhh, Lost Cauze
Maylay Sparks, you know what it is
Elite Fleet get the fuck up
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, check it out

[Maylay Sparks]
Fuck a moment of clarity, intensity varies from this cavity
And lifestyle wild bitch smack to your face smile
Profile is infinite, the climate in rap is inclement
I weather the storm, reform penmanship
Ill scripts scattered rounds like full clips
Dutch, two lengths, absinthe, Russian roulette
One shot left in a game, try to pull that
Pull that before I pate my attache
Get the laptop, duck when the chords pop
This is hip-hop big gold chains, like my name drops
Songs keep you boppin your head, 'til the music stop
Here's a proposition, for all the opposition
Turn and walk out slow before you end up missin
You ain't got a fuckin pot to piss in
Open window and throw it out, it's true what you read about
My dick beater's out, insane, know we straight
Blood on my gear and wet paint
My rep cain't fall in the hands of man's fate
with beat breaks, new sound landscapes, I'll reap papes
Rep cain't fall in the hands of man's fate
with beat breaks, new sound landscapes, I'll reap papes

[Chorus 2X: scratches]
"No doubt, you don't know what it's about"
(Maylay Sparks) "Bring the fuckin roof down"
"Kaboom, blowin your block just like a mine"
"That's what I speak, understand that?"

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Lost Cauze... shut the fuck up, it's Maylay and Lost Cauze
The black face with the minister stare, vision is glared
Trigger is hair, this is the year, the nigga you hear
Get digits to spare listen I dare
anyone of you chumps to duck you got some business to spare
And yeah, oh I thought so, I body beat your torso
Reef rockin B Hopkins body beat your torso
I'm hyped like a white jock who snort coke
Yeah, Maylay whattup baby? Y'knahmsayin?

[Maylay Sparks]
I've been provoked by the lyrics and hemp smoke
Spit lines, we epitomized in our youth, what you visualize
Fly the Philly skies, Eurorail to scan the lines
Cognac, blood with house wines
We'd have to kill 'em in the jungle like Uruguay
Mic device live on stage when you hear it fly

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
{*BRRRAP BRRAP BRRAP*} Blaow, nigga hold that
Once your head pops off nah it won't grow back
Salute, soldier!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Lost Cauze... shut the fuck up, it's Maylay and Lost Cauze</pre>
