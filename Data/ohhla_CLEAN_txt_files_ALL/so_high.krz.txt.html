[Intro]
Greetings earthlings I am your new leader follow me up in the sky I am oh oh so high

Watch him he goin clown you I'm so fly I'm so fly and I can fly around you'll never
Coming down true kinga let em crown you

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Coming in for landing when he touch down people actin like
They can't stand him but they can't handle him bare foot and you can't sandle him
Even if I was outta my shell baby you could'ntscramble him tend them even with
A tan I'm brighter than ya'll bladed and hated slayed him and never did I fall
Your a belly I'm an oscar your emmy I'm oscar slow moving I munatch ya
And mature enough to not tra were the realist super ify imitation and your
An imposta when I tell you I'm high I'm skyscraping observin this vertical
while you watching elavate and think what if you was up in the atmosphere
you could see the whole atlas
Here is a record just incase of my absence so when I say I'm getting high
I don't need no lighter of matches

[Chorus]
I'm so high I'm so high and I ain't coming down to keep him come around you'll
Watch him he goin clown you I'm so fly I'm so fly and I can fly around you'll never
Coming down true kinga let em crown you

Ta-hahaha Ayo Kalli watch this

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I control the doplar reading it's mr rain man and his aqua feening
High I'm too high above you hobbits meaning I'm way too big for you to interveen
Or see me
Kutts cocky and arrogant
Yes like the american government you in trouble when it's involved in a terrorist threat
Show up and blow up but never seen the smitherings
from tore up my clothes are the same thing as grenadine
Kutty the bloody machete equal to sarengetty
From BLEVE to feature you muthafuckas ain't still ready
Wicked indifferent on the tip you don't qualify
for for those that I mention I'm gonna take you ya don't qualify
for boom shaka ahhh shaka khan
Bringin the triggers you niggas didn't stop the non-sense
Since I was a kid I been advised and tried to stay fly

[Chorus]
I'm so high I'm so high and I ain't coming down to keep him come around you'll
Watch him he goin clown you I'm so fly I'm so fly and I can fly around you'll never
Coming down true kinga let em crown you I'm so high

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
My ears are poppin everytime I wake up
I'm off in a beezy baby wanna get the nookie wait for my penis
High as a comet I put the rock all up on it
I get supersonic and I never shoot it up into venus
I be the space invader haters ain't mattering haters in heaven I cannot get all the chattering
You wanna see me, ya better bring gods ladder and
I run a ring around all over like saturn n
They call me conceeded and they get mad at me
But they know that ain't nobody as bad as he
You can't get on my level with pawn strategy
Cause I'm gonna continue to defy gravity
Look up in the sky baby I came up flamed up and ready ain't nobody can tame us
Try to come and get us with something that's hainus
Man I'm puttin my foot in uranus I'm so high

[Chorus]
I'm so high I'm so high and I ain't coming down to keep him come around you'll
Watch him he goin clown you I'm so fly I'm so fly and I can fly around you'll never
Coming down true kinga let em crown you I'm so high I'm so high I'm so high

[Outro]
Follow my afterburna the wick close it might burn ya stay on the ground let ya learn ya
Extraterestreoul away up in the sky I'm so high</pre>
