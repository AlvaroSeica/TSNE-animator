Yeah yeah, uh-huh, ha ha
Check it out yo

[A.G.]
Aiyyo who dat? Show &amp; A, nigga yeah we back
I'm hot, you used to have that magic like T Mack
And you can keep that beef, we don't need that
So fuck a rap, nigga show up where you sleep at
Delete that beef, creep where the freaks at
And she want it in the Jeep, where my keys at?
Fuck her number I'ma hit it in the Hummer
And, even in the winter I was hotter than the summer yup~!
They runnin up, but is they gon' come or what
Some'll front, some'll fuck, get some or what
None of that, we don't ACT like we gangsters
But we them niggaz that'll go and stick a bank up
Naughty girl, come to daddy, let me spank ya
Let me thank ya, we done came up
Stayed the same what, never change up
Show &amp; A hold it down, we the anchor

[Chorus: scratched big L samples]
"Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond"
"When I'm gone I leave mics torn"

[A.G.]
Aiyyo diss who you want but PLEASE don't say me
Cause A.G. run with Wolves like K.G.
Like Show, you don't know that nigga crazy?
I'm lightin 'dro in the light gold Mercedes
Drop top, pop pop if you play me
Did it for the 90's, did it for the 80's
And we don't make music just for the ladies
Do it for our homies, and the paroles
Them couldn't hold me, mad David Banner
Got the livid muscle in you and you frontin for the camera
20 years young but she got stamina
Yo she was open when she asked am I the man or what?
She got a weed habit, I got a freak habit
Throw the feet by my ears, let 'em see the rabbit
They say we, on the next level like
Showbiz, and A.G.

[Chorus]

[A.G.]
Uh-huh, in the buildin
It's that nigga A.G. baby, yeah
Yeah</pre>
