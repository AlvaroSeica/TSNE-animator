Billy built a robot in his parents' garage
Because he had a list of problems that he needed to solve
He said I'm sick of The Hills, Laguna Beach is fake and whack
Let's party like it's '96 and bring the horn section back
Back before Gwen Stefani started rapping with Pharrell
Gas cost $1.15 and Goldfinger could sell
When reality TV wasn't scripted or contrived
The brass was fat and bumping and the beats were all played live
See Billy was obsessed with third wave ska
Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, Less than Jake (? Â– Less than Jake twice?) he'd seen them all
He longed for a time when Bill played the sax
On the White House lawn and kids wore shades and checkered slacks
So Billy sits back in the class and laughs
With a notepad on his lap as he plans his task
To make a giant robot, how's that
And bring the real Orange County back!

[Chorus]
This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block he's going to fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy make the city understand

The robot was completed and it opened up its eyes
Weighing 700 pounds and standing 8 foot 5
With his black coat, black shoes, black hat, set to attack
He headed to the hills to give those spoiled kids a smack!
Kristin Cavallari got knocked flat as Billy bumped the Aquabats
He ripped out Mischa Barton's spine as he cranked Save Ferris and Sublime
He burned down Heidi Montag's home as he bumped the O.C. Supertones
He screamed while smashing L.C.'s head, "SKA IS NOT DEAD!"

[Chorus]
This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block he's going to fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy take the OC by surprise

He'll make you do the Macarena as you rock your Tamagotchi
With his Newton down in Woodstock playing Sega la-di-da-di
He brought the 90?s back and then he freed Tibet
If you can't find this jam on Napster then the Wherehouse sells cassettes (old school)

Gigantic (he was)
Gigantic (this robot)
Gigantic (so very)
Gigantic (ska robot!!)

[Chorus]
This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block he's going to fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy make the city understand

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block he's going to fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy take the whole world by surprise

Robot: Ska is not dead</pre>
