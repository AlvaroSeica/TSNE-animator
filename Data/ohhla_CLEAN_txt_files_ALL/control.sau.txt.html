[Saul Williams]
I know that you've woken up and found yourself within a world a questions
where the answers come and go
And I know you don't want sit around and hear no asinine suggestions
when the truth just can't be told
But if I may, I got a thing or two to say
Although the answers are not clear
there's not a thing that you should fear
because the answers to it all whether things rise or when they fall
you'll find the truth remains the same and that truth is that God is change
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
but you can't control your destiny
I think that God is testing me
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
but you can't control your destiny
You just might fail successfully...
I'm alone..
And I thought God created you for me
How could it be that it can't be?
So alone...
And I don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what I would do
Hey you!
I thought that you were my destiny
Girl, I thought we were meant to be
Can't I choose what is best for me?
Hey you!
I thought that you were my destiny
Girl, I thought we were meant to be
Don't I know what is best for me?
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
but you can't control your destiny
I think that God is testing me
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
but you can't control your destiny
You just might fail successfully...
You can't control your destiny
You can't control your destiny
You can't control..
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
but you can't control your destiny
I think that God is testing me
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
but you can't control your destiny
You just might fail successfully
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
You can talk about it talk about it
You can talk about it talk about it
Hey you!
You can talk about it talk about it
You can talk about it talk about it
You can talk about it talk about it</pre>
