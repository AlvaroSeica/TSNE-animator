Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You see it's so hard to tell you the truth
I'd rather die than to be without you
And I'm dying baby, don't be so cruel

[Verse 1]
Still sitting in the kitchen where you left me
Rain drops beating on the glass, window pain
My phones still in pieces, but still more intact than me
I try to stay up but my legs won't let me
Try to call your name but my lips taped shut
Tears all on my polo, I'm hopeless girl no more please
Why does pride make it so hard to

[Chorus]
Tell you the truth
I'd rather die than to be without you
And I'm dying baby, don't be so cruel
Took a life time to let down my guard
Still I'm left here alone in the dark
And I'm broken please don't leave me with scars

[Verse 2]
Flashback to the 3rd of December
Told me that your pops broke your heart I will always remember
You said I'm just like him turns out you were right again
Night after night I swear it's so hard
I reach to the side of the bed to caress your hair
Your ghost still remains and, it kills me but you don't care
And that's what makes it so hard to

[Chorus]
Tell you the truth
I'd rather die than to be without you
And I'm dying baby, don't be so cruel
Took a life time to let down my guard
Still I'm left here alone in the dark
And I'm broken please don't leave me with scars</pre>
