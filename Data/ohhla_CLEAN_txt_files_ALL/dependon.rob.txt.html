[Lil' Rob]
As I look around...
At all these smiling faces...
I don't trust them...
I've got no one to depend on...

Chorus B: Lil' Rob
Ain't got nobody to depend on
No tengo a nade
Don't need nobody but myself
Can't trust nobody
Cause everybody that I've trusted, has done me wrong
No tengo a nade
Ain't got nobody to depend on

(Verse 1)
Some people have made up lies to read down and shed your name
Smiling faces
Smile in my face, but all this time, they wanna take my place
Give me the pat on the back
Then give me the stab in the back, tryin' to hold me back, now I'm back
All these fools talkin' smack
Figure that (I figure that)
It's been this way
Since junior high, everybody whisperin' shit
But like I said before
Jealousy was never cool, not even a little bit
(???), you're phony
But who's the one who hit the scene when I was sixteen
With the bullet
I was this close to do it, I know it, then I blew it, I was foolish (That's right)
Kickin' back on the corner
Smokin' a jay everyday
Some things never change
I'm still that way, in fact, today
I got so blazed
It was so magnificent
First you saw it, then you didn't, I disappear like a magic trick, didn't have my magic sticks
Then I
Disappear in the smoke as you soak
In your lies
Lil' Rob lightin' up the sky like Fourth Of July (Like Fourth Of July)
I can't believe myself
How I could subdue and just deceive myself

Chorus A: Lil' Rob
Ain't got nobody to depend on
No tengo nade
Don't need nobody but myself
Can't trust nobody
Cause everybody that I've trusted, has done me wrong
That's why this nice guy, has turned to wise guy

Repeat Chorus B

(Verse 2)
Mistakes
I know I made a few
But I'm only human
You made mistakes, too, I crease my Levis one leg at a time, just like you
But you wanna keep talkin' shit
Tellin' stories that are not true, it's ghetto
Like a fossil, tryin' to cover your tracks, cause you'll be a rat like Donny Brosco (Rata)
Now and then
I lose my way, feeling like I never knew my way
Thinking all them times that blew away, opportunities that I threw away
If I had wings, I'd fly away
And I would do this night and day
Oh, by the way
I like to play
From Saturday
Til Saturday
It doesn't matter, ay
What you say
I was told
"Don't let no one get you down and turn that frown
Upside down" (Turn that frown upside down)
Seems you can depend on me
But I can never seem to depend on you
I try and look you in the face
But then again, it's the same, I can't see two
What do I do?
I'm so confused
Til when someone's got to lose, I'd hate to be in your shoes
I'd probably be dressed up in the county blues, singing the blues to the things that I choose
Didn't I blow your mind this time, it was probably already blown
Ain't got no one to depend on, homie
Lil' Rob, what am I on?

Repeat Chorus A &amp; B

(Verse 3)
Everybody is somebody's fool, there's no exception to the rule (There's no expection to the rule)
If there was a guarentee that the one you love (That you love)
Is gonna love you
But I refuse to be, like I used to be
Everybody usin' me
Watchin' over, that's cool with me
I know what they want to do to me
Only out to make a fool of me
Don't try to be schoolin' me, please, cause I don't need to retire
Throwin' dust at my eyes with speed, and making me feel like they were the ones that were dealing
Appealin' to many, cause I'm the one that rocks steady
If you're not ready, get ready, think this is it, I've got plenty 
And I won't stop (Stop...)
Til I see that pretty penny (That's heavy)
Just like a Chevy on 20"s, hittin' switches
I'm hittin' thirty-nine inches and leavin' you bitches in twitches
While all you snitches be snitchin' and wanna be burning down bridges
I got you twisted like robes, while I'm breakin' down on your hoes
You make me laugh just like jokes, you fade away just like Ghost (Ha ha)
You wanna turn you back on me, pero
Esta bien (Ponle)
Ain't got no one to depend on, homie
No tengo a nade (Orale)

Repeat Chorus A &amp; B</pre>
