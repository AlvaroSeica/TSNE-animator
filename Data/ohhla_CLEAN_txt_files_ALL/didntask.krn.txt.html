(Couples arguing)

[K-Rino]
Man, I wish that y'all would of stop fussing
Speak to each other without cussing
And have a grown up discussion
Cuz every since the first moment that I got here
The plot turned chaotic and the true reason was not clear
Daddy's gon' off daily, mommy starting to nag
I felt more comfortable when I was floating in that water bag
Just laying as serenity
Now anytime y'all in the same vicinity
You go to war like enemies
But the night I was conceived and both of y'all was embracing
I couldn't wait to leave and seek placement
Racing with billions more chasing
Just anxiously waiting to be placed in that sacred destination
And once I came into fruition and witnessed y'all crying and kissing
I never envisioned being in this position
Proper attention I've been missing
Even though I can't talk yet I'm still wishing somebody would listen

(Chorus)
I just wish that y'all could see clear
Man, I just wish that y'all could see clear
Cuz I didn't ask to be here
Straight up, I ain't even ask to be here
Why can't you understand me?
Seems like nobody understand me
I just wish we was a family
Straight up

[K-Rino]
I don't think it's right for us to be
Thrusted deep in a hateful battle over custody because of me
Sometimes I wonder man, am I the blame?
I overheard my mama claim she had me too early and wish I never came
A little later on in the game
She talks about regretting ever meeting my daddy and giving me his name
And while they arguing over all types of things
I'm crying for my pacifier plus I need my diaper changed
My daddy left without kissing me, do he hate me?
And ever since that day he left I really haven't seen 'em lately
And mama is on the phone every night talking to my auntie
About how much money she gon' get monthly
And I've been sick all this week I ain't been breathing right
And now we riding around with some new dude that I don't even like
He tryna treat me like I'm his but that's too much to swallow
He ain't my daddy when he tried to pick me up I holla

(Chorus)

[K-Rino]
I'm witnessing the dispassion of this relationship
Now my time with dad is only weekend visitation
No love in the car, just struggles and wars
And next couple of odds, look at this trouble I caused
I speak perfect in my mind, I can think without saying
But when I try to say it out-loud, it just comes out like "Whaaa"
The beef showing no signs of squashing
Can't y'all see I'm watching
Y'all should of just put me up for adoption
And what the hell was daddy thinking
When he sent his new girlfriend over to my mama's house to get me for the weekend
While they was on the front porch cussing and loud talking
I'm standing up wobbling "Look mama I'm walking"
I look at 'em and praying plea
See I'm hoping one day they agree
That main purpose from A to Z was raising me
And even if y'all relationship burn out
Think about how y'all hatred is gon' make me turn out

(Chorus)
