[Kane]
See this here, this is somethin' serious right chea
I want all y'all ignorant niggas to listen to this
Not preachin' or teachin', but somethin' that y'all need to know

[Chorus]
Only God knows the truth
Only God knows
Only God knows the truth
Only God knows
Whisper in my ear when my casket close
When it's my time to go, take my soul out the ghetto

[Kane]
Nowadays niggas kill, at the drop of a dime
There be wars and Pulitzer Awards in the last time
Killuminati comin', I read it in Revelations
A one world goverment, United Nations
Penetentaries like concentration camps
Visa Cards and food stamps turn the microchips in ya hand
I don't understand in this land I'm from
It's like the rich get richer, the poor fightin' for crumbs
We some killas of our own kind wit nines
The white man pimp us everyday and we don't mind
Crack kills the mind, but life kills the soul
And your time to go, is somthin' you can't control
The government designed a system, keep 'em mentally inslaved
Control the population, outbreak, and AIDS
The media keep niggas divided and confused
Poison us with the food, and give us drugs ta use
Keep you in the county, used niggas actin' like fools
Runnin' 'round like y'all ain't got nuthin' ta lose

[Chorus] x2

[Abel]
I know what you sayin' Kane

[Kane]
What?

[Abel]
Feel my pain
Test of time, put stress on the brain
I learnt ta do my hussle at the age of fourteen
How ta stack that triple beam, servin' stones ta fiends
And it was only for tha style, all I got ta slangin' dope
I was broke, ask my boy for weed
He said he only had coke
Ever since they been husslin', always went ta find a car
When I die put my name up on the wall
On my casket write, "fuck all of y'all"
Remember Kane, those ladies used ta beat us, at tha foster home
Since the age of sixteen, we been livin' on our own
My momma pregnant wit us, shootin' up tha heroin
Nigga from ya zone, grab that dirty Chrome, it's on
Got two rocks left, prayin' that I make it home
Cause only God knows tha truth, only God knows

[Chorus] 'till fade</pre>
