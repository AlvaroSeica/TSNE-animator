[ VERSE 1: Skoob ]
Diggedy eff you, guess who's back with a new catalog
Nuts still big and black like two cannonballs
And no, I won't play follow the leader
Dog, I'm leanin on the game like the Tower of Pisa
Ain't nothin pretty, still a grimey dude
That's why they love me in the hood like Chinese food
Beats and rhymes, dog, I keeps it tight on all sides
For hardcore tats I'm a sight for sore eyes
And I'm ahead of my time
Off-beat specialist, the tracks stay ahead of my rhyme
I'm one of a kind, rare like a raw prime steak
My raw mindstate made me a all-time great
I got road dogs wild like O-Dog
The fuck you think we usin slang and code for?
Bet against me on the mic, you bastard
You probably better off shootin dice in traffic

Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(I get down)
(You better act like you know) --&gt; KRS-One
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(No way you can get up when I get down) --&gt; Jay-Z

[ VERSE 2: Skoob ]
The niggedy ( ? ), rugged and shocky
Who gon' stop me? When I'm out in Japan I'm sippin on sake
Or you can see me out in Santiago
With a broke bitch lookin like a fancy model
Yo, fuck that bubbly, pass that Olde English
Guess I never was and ain't never gon' be shit
Hood valedictorian, my thesis:
I can't fuck with a broad if she don't eat dick
Dog, I still be on some Chong and Cheech shit
Put niggas under my wing like Suave or SpeedStick
I blow trees, no raw, no x
I want it all, no more, no less
So don't be a stupid bastard
If I gotta I'ma shoot, plus I'm nice with my Dukes of Hazzard
Flip on yo ass like I do gymnastics
My whole team exclusive draft picks
Classic

Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(I get down)
(Yo, you better act like you know) --&gt; KRS-One
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down and boogie oogie oogie) --&gt; Das EFX

[ VERSE 3: Skoob ]
Now I ask y'all, do I got to squeeze my cannon
To be head of the class like Eli Manning
They say life's like a box of chocolate
That's why I mix the chocolate with haze and spark it
A little Henny with a lot of the sticky
Make broads kiss each other like Madonna and Britney
But I rap, don't confuse me with no other cat
I be where the struggle at, tryina hustle rap
Chest full of heart and a hand full of nuts
Heard money make a ugly nigga handsome as fuck
I stay true to my nuts and all my black brothers
Who do I trust? None of y'all cocksuckers
My people do a redrum war dance
Get money, when the feds come haul ass
I'm from the part of the hood where folks hustle
Dog, this is pitbull rap with no muzzle

Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(I get down)
(You better act like you know) --&gt; KRS-One
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(Get down)
Y'all niggas know how I get down
(No way you can get up when I get down) --&gt; Jay-Z</pre>
