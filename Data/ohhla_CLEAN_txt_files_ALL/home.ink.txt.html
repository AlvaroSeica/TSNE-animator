[Bei Maejor - Chorus]
I've been drivinly down this road I swear its just takin to long man
it feels like I'll never get home it feels like I'll never get home
so when everythings movin slow I just turn up my radio man
it feels like I'll never get home
I'll never get home
I'll never get home
ooh oh ooh ooh it feels like I'll never get home
ooh oh ooh ooh it feels like I'll never get home

[Kid Ink]
I said I'm so far gone sun in my eyes
but I'm ridin in the storm its a cold world
you need more then a sweater trynna make it through the weather
I gotta get it together man feel a little bit of pressure
but its my callin if you didn't get the message
I'm ridin through the death and I'm puttin in the afterlife
if they mentsion my name like a add reply
couldn't walk in my shoes stand lear of my lane
so fly each steps like landin a plane
one hand in wheel other hands in my brain
one foot to the gas and a trunk of propane fuel the fire in veins

[Chorus]

[Kid Ink]
Couldn't be long now ridin high hopin I don't fall down
I was MVP of little a team when I make it home its goin down
like a base string huh I got my feet to the pavement
heard success taste sweet like pastries
but look around all I see is bitter faces fakeness
actors shoulda been a agent
now tell me is it really worth it no suit and tie
but I work this big fish in the sea
ya erchinds until they tap out no mercy

[Chorus</pre>
