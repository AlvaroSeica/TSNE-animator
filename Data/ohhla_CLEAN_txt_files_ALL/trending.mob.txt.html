And I put that on my lil boy Bam and my niece (WOOP WOOP!)
Hundred five-fifty ki's in my Versaci fleece
Just a nigga from the street, tryin to smoke a joint
The shawty got a squad, brick squad, give all them
Bring boys, every squad nigga you so fuckin square (WOOP WOOP!)
Everywhere I go, least a hundred cash
Touch ya boys close by so I can show my ass (WOOP WOOP!)
Hundred on your head, it might make ya mama flip ya

Every night I go outside and play

(Verse 3, Alley Boy)
What they talkin bout? Weed and blow, we the trending topic
Kidnappin, rappin and robbin niggas, we the trending topic
When it come to a bad bitch, I switch it up playboy game silent
Come through with the top back, button and do it so we can motor shine it
All the mall got no ice, with the stone price say sack right
It's hard to tell my ears bright
Ten golds shinin when it hit the lights
You blowin on loud; gay two gram blunt, this a whole half
Bad bitch we can all smash
This a young ho with a gameplan
All reppin gang flags
But I'm bout that, we gon' all blast
And then after dog ass, these outsiders need to all blast
If you talkin bout Louie V Mob, nigga talkin bout my partnas
Duct tape comin with the choppers
Gon put these pussies on crimestoppers

(Hook, Master P)
I'm trending boy
I can smell the money (Smell the money)
We run the streets
No Limit keep coming (WOOP WOOP!)
I'm the boss (WOOP WOOP!)
We top models (WOOP WOOP!)
We flex on haters
We pop bottles</pre>
