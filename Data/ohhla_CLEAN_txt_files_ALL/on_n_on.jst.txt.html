[Chorus: D'Zyre (King Just)]
All you need, if you can feed us
We gon' keep it moving, on and on and on
(On and on and on, on and on and on
Check it, check it out, to the break of, break of, dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Check it, check it out, to the break of, break of, dawn)

[King Just]
Yo, we gon' step to this, we gon' rep to this
N.Y.C., nigga, done bled for this
On the last to miss, they gon' blast my hits
Taking forty duece splits, buying chicks KICKS!
Gorillas in the myst, boy, planets of the ape
Superman of rap, all I need is a cape
Top eight at eight, hot five at nine
Playa hater niggas don't wanna see me shine
Time after time, I'mma tell you again
Go against KJ, you ain't got no wins
Battle you in a holding pen with all your men
Dance on you like the bottom of my Timbs
Skins when I want 'em, trees when I need 'em
Ain't no nigga out there could defeat 'em
If you can't beat 'em, well you might as well join 'em
Niggas need work, well you might as well employ 'em

[Chorus]

[King Just]
I done did these raps, you can check my stats
I'm the one that spit darts on a limited track
Contact, just to let you know I'm back
What the fuck you think, I ain't help Shaolin on the map?
The proof is in the batter, but it really doesn't matter
When I kick rhymes all MC's scatter
Shatter like glass when I'm in your ass
Taking you out, man, that's a simple task
Ask and you shall receive, man, pass the weed
Chokemon, don't smoke with me
Casualties of memories left torn
Like who been on, who been warned
List goes on, Choke Armstrong
X-X-X-X, rated like porn
So on, and so on, Just, you dead wrong
Cuz you need to pay attention to the chorus on the song

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Who been doing it, who been putting ya'll through it
Half of ya'll don't know how to use it
Fucking up the music, lose it, before you get chewed like juice sticks
Come to your studio, and brought your acoustics
I threw this, way before Dre's time at Ruthless
Way before Old Man Jimmy was toothless
Abuse it, every time I put it down
They re-used it, everybody taking my sound
What now? Niggas ain't got no where to go
But you passed go, so ya'll niggas owe me dough
I ain't lost my flow, cuz I'm on the low
I ain't my glow, niggas know who seen show
Casper like Astro, when I release like the blow
Want my grass to grow where my fucking lawn got potholes
Shocked those who didn't believe
My cousin don't play cards, but still he had an ace up his sleeve

[Cozmo D]
Jam-On, two to break the dawn, check it
Pass me the mic, step aside and observe
While I wreck it, go upside your dome with that old school flavor
The kind that gets the cars boom-bamming through your neighborhood
Even get your grandmas feeling good
What you ain't never heard? Then somebody should of told ya
About Brooklyn's first hip hop soldier
Jam-On set it off, and we supplied the closure
Back in the days when I was young, well I wasn't
We was rocking the parks, killing DJ's and MC's by the dozen
And though we never got love from the media
My name should be up in every hip hop enclyopedia
Jammin' in the parks, that was me
The very first hip hop band, that was me
Jam On It, Wikki Wikki, Automan, Push The Button, that was me
So don't front, cuz you know you bumped Cozmo D

[Chorus]

[Outro: King Just]
To the break of, break of, dawn (4X)</pre>
