[Madd Kapp]
I came, I saw, I conquered 'em all
I experienced life in the rawest of raw
And I'm not gon' be another name on the flyer
Fuck a free show, that ain't even worth my while
You a shitty sixteen, I'm a album killer
I'm the hottest, I put that on my Grandma Willa
You need a bite of some onion and a shot of some hot sauce
If you're speakin in a feminine voice then FUCK OFF~!
I'm Kapp man, all by myself on the hill
You a image, and I'm the real deal with skills
And I can smell them millions waitin for daddy
And I'll gladly, start a forest fire, get at me
This is, style rippin like you never heard kids
So don't be actin like you never heard my shit
It's Madd Kapp in the building bitch - ooh ooh!
And you an undercover fan, go on admit that shit

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm makin moves, cause I ain't got nuttin to lose
Down to my last t-shirt, last pair of shoes
And I'm starvin like a muh'fucker out on the grind
I'm the first one to wake, first out to get mine

[Madd Kapp]
Respect the methods of minds that's greater
True gangsters, be the ones that get that weightup
Squeaky clean, even though the dirt's in route
I never touched it, I never even left my house
I was recordin when that particular shit transpired
I was drunk, celebratin that I was still alive
Unbelievable what all you motherfuckers will test
You never seen a motherfucker backflip in a vest
Then step, and get the hell up out of my aura
before I floor ya, welcome to the new rap order
It's the sciency Southwest faculty
Makin moves, all of y'all bow on bend knees
We lockin the game up, cuttin off your rep
You disrespect, get your deuce pencil to neck
It's not a game nephew, from the burbs to the projects
It's the truth, and I'm lookin to sign prospects

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp]
Hate man to man, D got my back yo
Guns blazin, pipe bombs blast the dough
Real street shit, muh'fuckers scrapin the curb
Hangin out of car windows, called fiendin to burbs
Steel nerves, ice all in they veins and shit
We ain't fuckin wit ch'all, this is live or die bitch
I hear the rumors 'bout settin me up
A bunch of gay motherfuckers tryin to talk so tough
You ain't shit without 8 men standin behind you
Try to fuck with me too much and they won't find you man
I don't know if you heard or not
A lot of assholes speakin soft done got shot
Fuck a fantasy, if anybody seen your face
you won't make it, disappear without any trace
We can act like adults up under the same roof
If not, allakazaam, alakaPOOF

[Chorus]
