[The-Dream - Intro]
Shawty rock to the beat for yo boy
Shaaaaw-ty, doooo it

[Fabolous overlaps intro]
Ay, it's LoSo in case you ain't know so
Ay, Dream lemme tell you bout shawty..
(AY!!!)
 
[Fabolous]
Shawty is the sh-sh-sha-sha, sugar honey iced tea
Prettiest one I see, lilttle mama icy
They say she a Pisces, I heard they are fiesty
You know how to treat her, she'll be sweeter than a Hi-C
Clean up very nicely, shoes a kinda pricey
Match 'em up precisely, good jeans nice tee
Like her food spicy, and she is the same
Hotter than a flame, but I do not know her name
Is it Keisha? (AY!!!) Is it Teisha? (AY!!!)
Maybe Lisa? (AY!!!) Or Taurisa? (AY!!!)
Could it be Teeyah? (AY!!!) Maybe Aaliyah? (AY!!!)
I guess I'll find out one day, 'fore that I'ma say  - ay(AY!!)
 
[The-Dream - Verse One]
Shawty fly (ay), shawty tight (ay)
Shoulda stayed there, all night (ay)

I missed ya (ay!), picked ya (ay)
Now it's time I (ay), get back up
with yooooooou...
Girl, with yooooooou...
Oh yeah! We used to kick it up at the park
now she's all grown UP... (UP, UP, UP)
Rockin them stilettos, jumpin up out that Mercedes truck (TRUCK)
Ooooooohhh... 
 
[Bridge]
It was Keisha (ohh-ooh), it was Sonia (ohh-ooh) 
It was Tanya (ohh-ooh), it was Monique (ohh-ho)
It was Niecy (ohh-ooh), it was Keke (ohh-ooh)
Ay, now that I see you at twenty-three, all I can say is...
 
[Chorus]
Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhh....... (AY)
Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhh....... 
Man, I don't need no hook for this shit..
Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhh.......

The sheeit, (AY!!) yeah, shawty is the sheeit (AY!!)
The sheeit, (AY!!) shawty you da sheeit (AY!!)
You the sheeit (AY!!), oh yeah (oh yeah)
 
[The-Dream - Verse Two]
Dior jeans, her walk so mean
Burberry fragrance on my shirt from when she (AHH!), me
Hard as a rock when she TOUCHED, me
Thinkin now if she would've loved me
What it is, what it ain't, tell me what to do (ay)
I know I'm late, but destiny bought me back to you (ay)
Time went by, turned you into a butterfly
I'm here to say, hello, tell yo nigga, good-bye
 
[Bridge]
It was Keisha (ohh-ooh), it was Sonia (ohh-ooh) 
It was Tanya (ohh-ooh), it was Monique (ohh-ho)
It was Niecy (ohh-ooh), it was Keke (ohh-ooh)
Ay, now that I see you at twenty-three, all I can say is...
 
[Chorus]
 
[The-Dream]
If she fiiiiine, if shawty a dime
You should tip her, you should tip her
If she GO, and you love her
You should tip her, you should tip her
If she fix you eggs, and grits in the morning
Man you should tip her, you should tip her
Pancakes wit the bacon on the side
(You should tip me, you should tip me)
 
Shawty rock to the beat for yo boy... (ay)
(Ohh-ooh, ohh-ho)
Yeah, yeah, yeah...rock to the beat for yo boy
Now that I see you at twenty-three, all I can say is...
