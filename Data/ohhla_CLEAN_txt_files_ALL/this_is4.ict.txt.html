[Intro: DJ Evil E]
COME ON!! JUMP!! JUMP!! YEAH!!
JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! YEAH!!
JUMP!! JUMP!! YEAH!! JUMP!! JUMP!! YEAH!!
JUMP!! JUMP!! YEAH!! COME ON!!

[Verse One: DJ Evil E]
A scholar, with the main ingredient
Uhh.. the evil one, I keep the suckers obedient
Discipline, because I meditate the dope rhyme
The super magna-later whores knew the time
I spit the lyric, and it funk you to the max
While the sucker, begin to tax with wax
They call me teacher because I'm teaching them; Never fall ashore
Cause Evil E is preaching them (UHH!)
Microphone Fiend fanatic of the Rap scene
I kick the flows, and bust a drag to your queen
I'm co-operstetic, laid back, piece of the Belly Mack
No time to waste on the case of the silly jack
Biter Lyric hell know, it ain't my style
No need to jock suckers, the course has formed a file
I'm no man's led, I'm chilling like a snowman
The king of cool can't get dissed, by no man

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Now, this is for the niggaz that be stocking you E (COME ON, KEEP JUMPING
SWITZERLAND!)
And all them fly haste whores that be clocking you E (YEAH!! UHHA!)
And buster ass niggaz that be jocking you E
[Evil E] Yo, fuck the punk niggaz, they don't wanna see me
And this is for them niggaz that be stopping you E
For all them fly haste whores that be jocking you E
For all them buster ass niggaz that be jocking you E
[Evil E] Yo, fuck the punk niggaz, they don't wanna see me

[Verse Two: DJ Evil E]
I got the cymbal, to make you symbol
Of Rap and rhyme, and explodes like the bomb whore
Uhh.. they clock my tip, I'm making a flip
Whole strip, do I slip? (No E, you got a grip)
War drove, Armageddon, for any occasion
Mortally making, for a sucker invasion
I spit the real, and never fall off track
Guard for the Ice-T's.. (The Mega Mack)
I shake them and break them then shake them like the tip of my dick
If they get hectic then I squeeze the trigg'
I make them sing along, and bring along
An entourage set by the crib, the E's no mirage

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Now, this is for the niggaz that be stocking you E (COME ON! YEAH!!)
For all them fly haste whores that be clocking you E (JUMP!! JUMP!!)
For all them buster ass niggaz that be jocking you E (JUMP!! JUMP!!)
[Evil E] Yo, fuck the punk niggaz, they don't wanna see me
And this is for them niggaz that be stopping you E (SING THAT SHIT YALL!!)
And all them fly haste whores that be clocking you E (YEAH!! JUMP!!)
And all them buster ass niggaz that be jocking you E (YEAH!! JUMP!!)
[Evil E] Yo, fuck the punk niggaz, they don't wanna see me

[Verse Three: DJ Evil E]
It's the real E, nobody is imitating
Just the funk shot, dope rhymes and fenestrating
Kicking the funky stuff, can't get enough suckers at stock
And hang them up to flock
Where I'm from, I'm the soul survivor
Gets liver, cause I'm the rapping MacGyver
Evil E, and my nigga in the background
Shooting up shit, shaking down for the frown

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Now, this is for the niggaz that be stopping you E (SING THAT SHIT BABY!!)
For all them fly haste whores that be clocking you E (YEAH!! YEAH!!)
For all them buster motherfuckers that be jocking you E
[Evil E] Yo, fuck the punk niggaz, they don't wanna see me
And this is for them niggaz that be stocking you E
For all them fly haste whores that be clocking you E (YEAH!! SWITZERLAND IN THE House)
For all them buster ass niggaz that be jocking you E
[Evil E] Yo, fuck the punk niggaz, they don't wanna see me

[Evil E] Me, and the Mic, how you like that Switzerland?
