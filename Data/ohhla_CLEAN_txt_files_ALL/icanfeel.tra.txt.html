It's somethin goin on and I don't know if it's my fire from the block
off the top I know it's somethin wrong
and I don't know who to trust so I gotta keep my glock
that'll flock tellin everybody move along
shit everything ain't what it seem
even the niggaz that I love to death shiest cause they playin for they own team
and I be wantin to try and do 'em some harm
instead of leavin 'em to suffer, I extended my arm
yeah I'm still runnin with the same ol'gang
no matter where a nigga run it's still the same ol'pain
same cloud, same night, with the same ol'rain
same heart still standin like I'm hard as a train and that's game
I thought this shit was too good to be true
Niggaz hate the fact that I made it and still come back through
but either way they still know where it's at
Niggaz hate it cause they hate me, and I'm showin it back

[Chorus - Dallas]
[I can feel it in the air]
I can feel it in the air
[I can feel it in the air]
Oooooh Oooh-I can feel it in the air
Ahhhhh yeah
[I can feel it in the air]

[Trae]
And I don't know what it is but if I'm patient for somethin
them niggaz not they two time me they bound to show what it is
I swear they hate like a ounce of dro
too strong with a stence so I'm bout to blow
but if they want me then it's fine
I gotta baby brother that's still around that's gon be representin mine (Fuh real)
I know my son gon be okay T Jones, and Boss
And the rest of the click they gon see okay
and I can feel it in the air
Like my niggaz feelin plex and I can see it in they stare
but they don't step in the square
So I assume they wanna stick me in my back
that ain't G them niggaz need to get it how they pack (they sheist)
don't even bother cause I'm deaf when it come to y'all
don't even act like we cool-don't try to speak at all
I should've seen it when my auntie said slow it down
cause it's a year later with too many fakers around

[Chorus - Dallas]
[I can feel it in the air]
you don't have to say a word....I can feel it in the air
no matter what you try to tell me...I can feel it in the air
[I can feel it in the air]

[Trae)]
I guess they mad at me who'da ever thought
my life I'd have 'em lookin bad at me
nothin but love and that's a damn shame that's why I click
cause ain't nobody got a nigga back
Matter of fact if I lose I bet they move quick
the same ones who accept my help
don't give a damn about the pain I felt unless it boost they wealth
but I'm a true solider quiet is kept
You know it's death before even if I get swept
damn why the hood ain't made of G's
because if it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to breathe
if it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to leave
haters worse then a disease that's what I believe
I know my real niggaz feel my tone
if you ain't ninety-nine plus you ain't in my zone
better feel a nigga vibe if I'm flippin alone
cause I'm aware of my surroundings even if I'm at home

[Chorus] - Dallas singing to the end </pre>
