Water doesnt stick to tape
And if I join the air force I can legally rape
Eeee-motions can't be held together by glue
If I learned to fly today I'd be gone without a clue

Your stereotypes aint true
If I learned to fly I wouldn't teach you

One less ally to deal with
People aint no friend to me
Cause bodies all evolve into enemies
I need to get my vaccination
For this biggie small Pac invasion
Egos are hilarious, they're like pushup bras or tupays
Fake shit to make you feel better physical affirmations for blue days
Who stays? 
Talcum in the middle or younger brother
Oedipus complex on an orphan child with no mother
Branches dangle, heroes from an Achilles tendon that'll push fallen angels
With parachutes
Cowboys are full of courage
But with their eyes shot out they can't stare at you
Chiefs riot with spirits who didn't share the flute
Don't freeze tell an officer I dare you to shoot
Find bullet holes in place of button clips
I don't want to live, epitaph, mutton monolith
So I fly away
Watch your manslaughter case in court as an apparition
Hearing allegations of how the finger slipped
As persuading as the cleavage in-between her tits
Tell your attorney to pay the bystanders to heckle
Cause I'll be busy writing things that make me excited
While nursing home occupants count their freckles

Water doesn't stick to tape
And if I join the air force I can legally rape
E-motions can't be held together by glue
If I learned to fly today I'd be gone without a clue

The sad thing is I believe most of these lies inside my head
Like big brother spies
With nineteen hundred and eighty four eyes watching over me till I'm dead
When I go to sleep I have dreams of hanging from the gallows
Most cowboy poets get about as deep as a stream gets shallow
(What)
Just joking
I was only playing
But I am serious when I tell you you're not abstract just because
I can't understand what the fuck you're saying
Sorry if I sneeze around you, I'm allergic to assholes
Jetpack bounty hunter defying gravity catching clouds with my lasso
Digging the spurs in, spaghetti western
Bar fights opponents with whiskey breath
Say what you will, I'm not listening, my ears are blind and my eyes are deaf
Throwing bar stools, he hit me with a right hook and missed me with his left
Turbo thrusters on burnt to a crispy death
Broom in the holster who's going to clean up this mess
I'm a custodian not a janitor
I'm the last of a dying breed, I don't smoke and never been drunk
I'm a straight edge with blood shot eyes I keep a green tea filled canister
Cause I'm from the state where kids kill each other at school
And I'm from the race where humans kill each other like fools
Play with fire and you'll get acquainted
Play with monarchies and find your wine tainted
Love the rituals but laugh at change
Cause tradition is the only repetition making me feel sane

Water doesn't stick to tape
And if I join the air force I can legally rape
Eeee-motions can't be held together by glue
if I learned to fly today I'd be gone without a clue

Your stereotypes aint true
If I learn to fly today I wouldn't teach you 

Cowboys go to airports cause they can't fly with capes x2
Cowboys go to airports 

Six barrels take
Ten paces and turn around flying cowboys nowhere to be found
Tumbleweeds obsolete
Safeway sacks blow down main street</pre>
