[Bizzy Bone]
And we are at the end of this {*echoes*}
Extension {*echoes*}
And I'd like to leave my family members {*echo*}
With something {*echoes*}
Trust and believe {*echo*}

(Bizzy Bone! Bone Thugs-N-Harmony!)
(Yeah! So ride to this!)

Trust and believe {*echo*}
Trust and believe {*echo*}
Bizzy Bone! Bone Thugs-N-Harmony!
Ride to this! Ride to this!
(Ride to this!)</pre>
