[Intro]
(Men talking as pager goes off)

[Chorus]
Baller Baller, We don't want no Ballers (3X)
Baller Baller, We don't want no motherfucking Ballers

[Verse 1]
Baller Baller, get off of my tip
Punk motherfucker, you better not slip
'Cause if you do, you'll get stuck like a truck
And you know what, I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'll keep going, and flowing, and showing
H.W.A. has got to keep hoeing
For thousand, keeping the crowd arousing
While they're smiling, and my pussy profiling
I know what you want, but hoes get cash
You guessing that you're getting a piece of this ass?
Your bank was short, rolling down San Pedro
You cold made a jack on a man with a kilo
Thinking that you're balling, yet you're falling
When you go to jail, it's me that you're calling
But I don't want do brawl a baller
I need a brother that's taller

Chorus:

[Verse 2]
5.0, on the road, on the go
As you go serve another kilo
L.A.P.D. on your ass, moving fast
On the other side, what they gave us for
Looking for a drive by, in a low ride
But you get away, see me rolling, pull up beside me
Knowing that I'm hoeing, coming with a rap
Looking for a fly girl, but I don't want a Jerry Curl
Fucking blue lights shining in the mirror
I swerve to the right, so I can stay clear
A  punk ass nigga, thinking that he's bigger
If the Feds don't smoke him, Jazz pull the trigger
'Cause we'll go to jail, do well in the cell
We don't give a fuck when it comes to tell
Another bitch who tries to stand taller
Never fuck around with a nigga that's a baller

[Chorus]
(2X)

[Verse 3]
Fuck a baller in a straight out diss
If you're with one, you're a dumb ass bitch
I'm on the go, here to dish another kilo
Serving, curving, but to me, you're burning wood
In the neighborhood, if you could, I know you would
Try to screw me
But your dick is too short to catch up to me
Keep that shit in your goddam pants
'Cause with a real fly hoe you don't stand a chance
Get a little money, is what you need to do
And stick with that beast that's been rolling with you
'Cause you're faking, shaking, I ain't got no time
With a nigga that's a baller, with playing on his mind
Living like you do, your ass is getting smaller
Take that, you motherfucking baller!

[Chorus]
