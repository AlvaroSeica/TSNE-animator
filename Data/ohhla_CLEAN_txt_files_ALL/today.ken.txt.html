Today *9X*
I feel like *3X*

[Kendrick Lamar]
Twisted up in cold heat
But courtesy of the homie Whoo Kid, chronic features
Hennessy by the two-litre, fuck a fifth
Today I'm feeling like a nigga that worry don't exist
I need some alone time, cut off my phone, get in the zone
Within my own mind, I'm gone, be back in a minute
Cruise till I hit the beach of Venice, parlay
Play the strip like an arcade while bumping some Sade
'Sweetest Taboo', my brain is a castle
built from the hands of God, oh God
I'm a free soul staring in the belly of an eagle
That's not a metaphor, that's just me hoe
They say I'm an activist rapper
I'm just a regular nigga, Jigga and Pac playing John Madden
Now picture that while I finish rolling this Bubba Kush
Reading scriptures from the good book
That's not considered a sin is it?

[Chorus: JaVonte]
As I move
I feel way better doing me, I can only do me
I hope that you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn if she, if he, if them
or they say I'm uncool
Nothing would change how I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar]
What I compose be so potent
that if the Earth dried, I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet ski and start west coasting
I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon taking action in the heat of the night
So if the Devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can O.D.
Walk outside, then sniff a whole ki'
Old lady, don't call the police, it's just lil' Kendrick
walking with his heart on his 'pendix, don't be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all Midget Mac swinging on Shaq, now have a seat
You can never coexist with my mama's oldest, recognise my name
I got my mind right, my niggas locked in the pen
That's why my mind write ink over my brain, what's up?!

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So let me start off the third verse
bigging up y'all favorites as I curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
and the ass looked like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossiping bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight, so pull triggers
Fuck the new broke ass price, the cost of living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck, you can keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'ma keep it K. Dot
This is me every day, Jay-Z didn't lie, fucker

[Chorus]

[Alori Joh]
Today *9X*</pre>
