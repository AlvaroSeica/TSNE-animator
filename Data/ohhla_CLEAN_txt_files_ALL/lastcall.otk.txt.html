[Chorus]
Tell them niggaz that be holdin' the wall: FUCK Y'ALL!!
Hit the flo' start shakin' it all,  YES Y'ALL
What we drinking, no we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call
Tell them mutherfuckers holding the wall: FUCK Y'ALL!!
Hit the Flo' start shaking it all, YES Y'ALL
What we drinking, no we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call

Now look here
I'm gon hit da club man, I'm gon get some love
I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon spend more than a dub
I will tell dem broads and her chicken head friend
No Fahrarri , no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz
Might just play the wall with this meal left on my grill
Act like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hankville
I remember her I like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac, Hoop Deville, and Chicken Head Drillin'

[Chorus] {with Lil' Jon &amp; The East Side Boys}

I'm gon get dat freshed out fade and then I'm gon get laid
Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon get paid
Makin a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirtier dot has em for me for me, The drought has ended today
Wit no delay
And a, four piece grizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place and a ??? to play

{Chorus}

The boy so wild don't crack no smile
Deposit like the wild kingdom, fox makes the crocodile
Popped tops and what we drink, so sit bak for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for em to swallow
Anybody ever told you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook line to follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
They call me Mac-Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow-Trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mac-Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
Its, trouble all up in your ear

{Chorus}

Yes, I know when to excite dem hoes
Me coup, reptili ya feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner on his mind set, he say he loved it
So cope strung I strip a bitch, Why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Bump wit this gritty thang
She ain't yours you wish she was
We don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous
???
Hoki the fuckin ??
And ya crew will slick em out their draws, I'm so infamous
Dead Serious
From da club, to da caddy, to da holiday in
From the dusk til the dawn we gon do it again

{Chorus}</pre>
