Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1)
Catch me if you can
Gingerbread man flying somewhere outta France
All around the world I got em in a frinze
Life is a bitch so I'm fuckin with her friend
Don't get outta line please, gon make it look good like a dime piece
When it say 4: 20 on the time piece, mean 2 blunts at time call it siamese
You know how I get it, no I ain't fulfilling so the work is never finished
Start until the finish, bitch I do it statue bout to go cash you
Cummin right at you, better get a Kleenex
Wipe me down, know I stay I da cleanest
I don't point like a V-Neck, I know that you seen it

[Chorus)
You waited all this time to get it in
We get it in
Who gettin it
Take a couple shots then she giving up
Say she got a man I don't give a fuck
Here we go again a-a-again a-a-again
Baby here we go again a-a-again
With the same old bullshit

[Verse 2)
In the building like a toolkit
Shooting for the stars and she know I got a full clip
I could make you famous quit with all that bullshit
Baby come n chill with a cool kid
Tell me what yo name is I can break it down lamens
Swear to boyfriend is the lamest
Stop tripping on that nigga where yo cane is
Think he shouldve never let you out
One more round we can throw in the towel
Get it wet like I turned on the valve
Not a word all I heard was the vows
Oh's and the ahh's need to get a map got her losing her mind
Naw you ain't gotta be shameful I know what you came for

[Chorus)
You waited all this time to get it in
We get it in
Who gettin it
Take a couple shots then she giving up
Say she got a man I don't give a fuck
Here we go again a-a-again a-a-again
Baby here we go again a-a-again
With the same old bullshit

On that same on bullshit
Just finished the full 5th
Got me standing on the chairs like a poolpit
Hold up. Said it's on when it's on</pre>
