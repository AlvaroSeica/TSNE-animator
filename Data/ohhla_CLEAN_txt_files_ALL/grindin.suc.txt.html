(*talking*)
You know yeah uh-huh, you know
That's right uh-huh, what

[Hook - 2x]
(what you doing), bumping grinding on that Interstate 10
(who you with), pints pounds and a couple chickens
(what we gon do), I'm trying to hustle and stack up some wins
I gotta sell the shit we stole, and then do it again

[Grace]
Compressed pounds sealed pints, and A-1 chickens
Back on the streets on the road again, bleeding down I-10
Syrup cookies and cheese, plus I got bags full of weed
And for you niggaz that want it, I got that lean bopping t's
Taking trips on money flipped, it's like highway robbery
Me and that L.O.S. get gone, chasing our currencies
Hit your town in the hood, them Air Force 1's get to stepping
Cash money brothers break boys, on the grind packing weapons
Score it whip it and ship it, you know go-getters go get it
Buy it low and sell it high, then come back cold with it
Paper chasing pyrex shaking, deadly faces we making
We got it all at wholesale, clientele we taking
Making moves for the cash, thinking first so we last
Fuck with your boy and get it good, I got a deal for your ass
Nina pack for 45, 5-PT left 25
Throw in a pound for fo' hundred, making sho' you satisfied

[Hook - 2x]

[Mike D]
No need to ask, who on that highway booking em
Sunday catch me cowboy hat, with a cowboy look and uh
Duely trucker, yeah Corle' a mo'fucker
Two hands fried up, thirty grand tied up
Ain't taking losses, (for what) I'm too on
Don't play with my money lil' daddy, I'm too grown
Plus that brown trucker, still bring em by the 20's mayn
Reggie by the hundreds mayn, track stars to run it mayn
Y'all ain't talking money mayn, let's talk figgas mayn
Listen when I talk and hear them, tell the difference mayn
Half of em don't know, fifty 20's is a thousand
Or simple shit like don't sleep with dope in your houses
You a 80 baby, I've been on since the 90's
Hugging these blocks, when your mama wouldn't let you round it
Plus I know the, front and back way to I-10
If the whole thang hit the flats, think I ain't gon win shit
