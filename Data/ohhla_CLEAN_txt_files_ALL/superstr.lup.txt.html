[Chorus  Santos Mathews]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's is here
And the microphones
And they wanna' know oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they wanna show oh oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1  Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh
A fresh cool young Lu'
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Wanna' believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do somethin' new?
Well ya' name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
YOU! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me
Standin' outside of heaven waitin' for god to come and get me
I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool/Ankle
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle wit' it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung "Blue"
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven
The devil on me, two ton's too

[Chorus  Santos Mathews]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's is here
And the microphone's
And they wanna' know oh oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 2  Lupe Fiasco]
And ya' better wear ya' shaaades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the staaage
Down to the basement pass the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly misses the airliners
Magnified times five, this its pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaaaze
Now that's important to say
'Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to faaade
We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to staaay
Like the Governor called and he told him to waaait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his caaage
The audience ain't faaazed
And they ain't gon' clap and they ain't gon' praise
They want everything back that they've paid
'Cause they've been waitin' since ten to see the lights get dim

[Chorus  Santos Mathews]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they wanna show oh oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 3  Lupe Fiasco]
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standin' in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting' along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&amp;Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say "You need to go and see that"
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performin' for me
Like, ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha, ha


[Chorus  Santos Mathews]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's is here
And the microphone's
And they wanna' know oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they wanna show oh oh oh oh, yeah

If you are, what you say you are
Then have no fear</pre>
