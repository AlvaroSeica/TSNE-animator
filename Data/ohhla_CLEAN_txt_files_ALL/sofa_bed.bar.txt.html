Aw Naw, Look who just stepped in?
Stilley! Little shot a juice, big cup of gin
Your girl smell my aro with each gust of wind
Plus my team can't lose pick us to wiin
tonight we going in, tomorrow we going hard again
been a 5 week party binge
told my bi-chick to call up some naughty friends
now who ends up with who? it all depends
We on the floor at the hole in the wall
they way her booty clap, make ya hold your applause
exposing her draws, she showed me her thong
kitty cat get wetter than a nose on a dog
get hi like some 'rilla with some hemp tide
broke down a whole pound, enzymes
I'm a pimp, you can tell by how my rims shine
the only time I sweat a bitch is when it's gym time

Yep, we in the club like dubstep
smoking out til there ain't no more bud left
Damn, we outta weed? no need to be upset
we with Michael Barber aka the local drug rep

[Michael Barber]

Shhh! But I got it on the low
whoa to the kush that we about to blow
See I'm on a roll get it popping like X
dudes want fame, taking pictures with my EX
dudes in the batting circle claiming they got next
Just got a text, from the 5-0-2
Buffalo, now tell em what we gonna do

[Buffalo Stille of Nappy Roots]
This is our house and we might let you sublet
naaaw, fuck that,
now a days, everybody got swag, I mean who don't?
but why you wear the cowboy hat? Cause you don't
Ha, am I over dressed?
Snake skin boots with the cobra heads
girl you could be the guest on my sofa bed
I wear rubbers to the club, I am so prepared
Wax on wax it off
my nickname Buffalo Hasselhoff
beer pong, flip cup, fitting to get my dick sucked
passed out at the bar, woke up at the strip club...
