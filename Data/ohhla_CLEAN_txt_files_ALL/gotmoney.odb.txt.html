Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Ohhh baby
I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls
Its on (echo)
All the pretty girls, in the world
And the ugly girls too
Cause to me your pretty anyways baby

[Verse 1]
You give me your number, I call you up
You act like your pussy don't interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fuckin me
But I have a little problem wit you not fuckin me
Baby you know I'ma take care of you
Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No it's bad bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitches, niggaz put away your pist-als
Dirty won't be having it in this house
Cause bitch I'll cripple your style
Now that you heard my charmin voice
You couldn't get another nigga, hoochie won't get moist
If you wana look good and not be bummy
Girl you better give me that money! AOWWW!

[Chorus 2X: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't your worry, I said hey; baby I got your money

[Verse 2]
Yo! so I glanced at the girls, girls glanced at me
I whispered in their ear, wanna be with me?
You wana look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just DANCE if you caught up in the holy ghost trance
If you STOP I'ma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
Every eye, don't you be watchin me
I don't want no problems cause I put you down
in the ground where you can not be found
I'm just Dirt Dog tryin to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey
Radio, yes all day, everyday
Recognize I'm a fool and ya luuuuuuuuuuv me!
None of you NUH better look at me funny
NUH you know my name, now give me my money!

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty over Chorus]
Sing it, sing it girls!
Just shake it right now!
If Dirty want his money, I think y'all should give him his money
That's how I like you giiiiiiiirlllll

[Interlude]
Sexy, sexy, sexy!
Sexy, sexy, sexy!

Sexy, sexy, sexy!
Sexy, sexy, sexy!

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo!
Nigga playin in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out let me hold it tight
You looking at my wrist sayin "It's so nice!"
The price bitch is diamonds, shinin disco light
Well you better help me solve my PROBLEM
Or I'ma get this money and rob them
Lucky dog when I won the lotto
Ran up on my car for carryin Rollo
But hold on, you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt {*clap clap*}
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt and Dirt bust your ass {*clap clap*}
Stop annoyin me, yeah! I play my music loud
It takes the Bastard Ol' Dirty, to move the CROWWWD
They say he had his dick in his mouth
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house
Now give me my money!

[Chorus]
