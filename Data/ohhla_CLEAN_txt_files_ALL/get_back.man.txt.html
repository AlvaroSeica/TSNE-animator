[INTRO]
Ooh Yeah, Macho Man Randy Savage back at ya once again
Warning all you punks to get back (get back)
Yeah, here we go

[VERSE I]
Don't make me mad dude the Macho Man's about to explode
You bad and bold (hugh) you're travelin on a rocky road
Let it be known Randy don't play no games
I'll burn ya like flames I'm kickin' butts and takin' names
Cuz thou shall not mess with nor test Macho
One slap (blooow) to the face and now I got cho
Butt shook oh now ya tryin' ta run
And now you're stunned I'm terrorisin' without a gun
You should've known not to step up cuz I'm in command
You got slammed (damn) by the Macho Man
That's the plan to hit ya and drop the pain on you
So don't try to test the best cuz I'm warnin' you

[CHORUS]
Get Back / Cuz the Macho Man's about to attack
Ya step up with that crap and you're bound to get slapped

Get Back Dude / or I'm a have to bring the pain
Cuz messin' wit Randy Savage you're insane in the brain

Get Back / Cuz the Macho Man's about to attack
Ya step up with that crap and your bound to get slapped

I said Get Back Dude / or I'm a have to bring the pain
Cuz messin' wit Randy Savage you're insane in the brain

[VERSE II]
I've been at it a long time so I'm experienced
With all these B.S. dudes that think I'm fearin' 'em
Yo dude you really think I'm shakin' in my boots?
Hey dude you really think that I'm afraid of you?
Let me tell you Randy Savage don't fear no man
Come to close watch out cuz you're gonna get slammed
When I hit ya with my power your body'll start shiverin'
Hit ya to the head to the gut damage your liver and
Now you wish you never messed with Savage man
You had to learn the hard way, I'm not your average man
You can't stand, Macho Man I'll give you the smack
So if you don't want the pain, then ya better get back

[VERSE III]
They call me gorgeous Blaze when I step in the ring
But I don't play games when I step in the ring
Once that bell go ding watch the hell I bring
You bout to get the worse --- whippin' the world has ever seen
With no sweat cuz ya'll dudes is sweet things
Also known in the ring as weaklings
Who gonna stop this team Blaze and Randy Mach
We known for low blows, elbows and cheap shots so

[CHORUS]

[BREAK]
That's right you must be insane in the brain cuz it's not a game
The Macho Man Randy Savage forever and a day
You punks better pay homage to the original king of the ring
Get Back

[CHORUS] 2X </pre>
