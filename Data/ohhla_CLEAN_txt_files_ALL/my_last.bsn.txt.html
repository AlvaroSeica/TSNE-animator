[Intro/Bridge - Chris Brown]
Hands up in the air
I just want the-I just want the 
Baddest bitch in the world, right here on my lap

[Chorus - Chris Brown] + (Big Sean w/ad-libs)
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma-I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'm-I'ma hit thit ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma-swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
Like I-Like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
Ok, now where that alcohol, you ain't even got to ask
Cause I'ma drink it all, like-like its my last
She a '7' in the face, but a '10' in the ass
She even look better, by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this muthfucka
I'ma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muthafucka (Go!)
I'ma go hard 'til it hurts off in this muthafucka (Go!)
I'ma ball so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
After work, and I can get you anything you want
I could-I could, I could-I could put you on
See you look like Beyoncé so do it like Beyon'...
Do it-do it like Beyoncé and put it on, Sean
Grind hard, but a got a lot to show for it
Always had +drive+ like I had to +chauffeur+ it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around, and make a show for us

[Chorus - Chris Brown] + (Big Sean w/ad-libs)
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma-I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'm-I'ma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma-swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
Like I-like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
Like I-like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Now, I'ma fill this glass up like it's my last
I'ma-I'ma blow this bag up, like its my last
I'ma-I'ma spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'ma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man, when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in space
All-all up in my face like "You remember who I am?"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han-Han eating all the Wonton
Rosé, rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rocking +Sean John+ (Haha!)
Man I just ended up on e'rybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what e'ryone projected
Knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel
I'ma just tell you, its e'rything that I expected - Bitch! (Boi, boi)

[Bridge]
[Brown + Sean]: Hands up in the air
[Big Sean]:     One time for the Westside, Westside, let me see them
[Brown + Sean]: Hands up in the air
[Big Sean]:     D-Town! Two times if you love G.O.O.D. Music
[Brown + Sean]: Hands up in the air
[Big Sean]:     And three times for the baddest chick in the World who got her
[Brown + Sean]: Hands up in the air (Yeah!)

[Chorus - Chris Brown w/ ad-libs] + (Big Sean w/ ad-libs)
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma-I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'm-I'ma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma-swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
Like I-like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all

[Chris Brown]
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
Cause if you don't do it Big bitch, you ain't doing nothing

[Chorus - Chris Brown w/ ad-libs] + (Big Sean w/ ad-libs)
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma-I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'm-I'ma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma-swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
Like I-like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all, all-all-all-all
Like I-like I never had it at all-all-all-all, all-all-all-all</pre>
