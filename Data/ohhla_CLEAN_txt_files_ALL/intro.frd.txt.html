Trapper of the year bitch I can't stop trapping
Trapper of the year bitch I can't stop trapping
Weed so stanky, you can smell it through the pack

Damn son where'd you find this

This your cargo nigga

We mean business

I'm not a hussler
I feel like one of them balls players
Perfect magic or something
A nigga got dough, a nigga got need
Feds still gonna live with it</pre>
