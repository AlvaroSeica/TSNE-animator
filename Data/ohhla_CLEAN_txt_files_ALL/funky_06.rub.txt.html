[Rubbabandz]
One, here come the two, to the three, to the four
Ya'll know them slow motion soldiers hardcore
Get funky on the street, I'm kicking in ya door
And if you want beef, I'mma take a bitch to war

[Mata]
Boy, boy, you talk alotta shit
You fuck around, get hit, by every bullet in this clip
Don't flip too much boy, and ya'll niggas want it
Like Kunta Kinte, but ya'll more like Tobe, homey

[Marcellus]
Dick riders get dismissed, kicked out of big bodies
Ride ass and titties, my shorty got a thick body
All villain, the opposite of a Christian
Hide your mistress, pimping relentless, we getting

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Funky, funky, funky, funky
Funky, funky, funky, funky
It's getting funky, it's getting funky
It's getting funky, it's getting funky
It's getting funky, it's getting funky
It's getting funky

[Rubbabandz]
It's a new order, five star general'll shoot
Not tying my shoe lace when I'm reaching in my boot
I bang, ya'll niggas pussy
Ya'll better retreat, regroup and then push me

[Mata]
Don't touch me, hold up, wait a minute
Let me put tomato, and it folds, pussy niggas
Better get your weight up, and your heat, gangsta
Cuz the street'll sweep you off your feet and turn ya sleep game on

[Marcellus]
Same song, keep working my nerves
Same snitches in the precint, chirping like birds
Same hoes coming to the slow, trynna get down
Same nigga here still holla, fuck all ya'll, and I still make it

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
My heat weight a ton, I stick you for ya riches
I run up in ya crib like I run up in ya bitches
You be swimming with the fishes, getting tooken for ya bridges
I'm in the low rider, laying low with the switches

[Mata]
Now it's one, and here come the two, to the three of ya fours
Bumping ya gun, for that came out the pours
6 foot 5, with the heart of a dog
He say he a hot boy, burn him with the torch

[Marcellus]
Killing shit, when he thought he ignorant
Do it illigiment, no not even a little bit
Say you love ya little bitch, I hit it
(Yo send that bitch out) Cool, I'm wit it</pre>
