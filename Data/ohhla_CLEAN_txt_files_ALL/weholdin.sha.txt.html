Uhh, what, we make it happen baby
(We make it happen) When we come through
We come through, you know how it's goin down
(We make it happen no doubt) S-Double
Look into the eyes, Pablo, Sordear
(We make it happen) Uh-huh, Fluid (we make it happen no doubt)

I'm a winner, trust and believe when I tell you dawg
Success is my bitch and I'ma fuck her raw
And even die from disease, all my kids she'll bore
I spill styles, ill styles, never heard before
I'm sick like a fiend without a hit of that dope
Cough up some ill shit that you wanna quote
Never frettin on no tough-guy shit, but I smack herbs
Extra Diacha linkin leather and Iceberg
Slang superb, spew words, splash nerves
Police cars that hug the turns, with tires burnt
All my BK niggaz - all my NJ niggaz
All day outdoor "dough or die" niggaz
Raw' niggaz give me no pounds, I don't need ya love
I don't need ya fake-ass mounds and ya fake-ass hugs (I don't need it)
All I need is cash to fold, herb to smoke (yeah I need that)
Stocks and bonds, nuff equities and homes

[Hook]
We holdin - we done made it happen (make it happen baby)
We done made it happen (make it happen baby)
We done made it happen (make it happen baby, happen no doubt..)
We holdin - we done made it happen (..baby, we make it happen no doubt)
We done made it happen (..baby, we make it happen no doubt)
We done made it happen (we make it happen baby, we make it happen)
(Come on!)

They wanna shoot ice grills they wanna duck the skill
They wanna sleep on the S till they grill get spilled
They wanna spit they corny raps till they mouth get slapped
They wanna preach to the S like I don't know facts
They wanna, block this man, but can't stop the fam
I ain't wanna bust them niggaz, but they forced my hand
They wanna say it ain't raw (raw) but I know it's real (uh-huh)
Minus the glamour and the glitz, just the cash appeal
They wanna take shots at me, dead me possib-ly
They wanna ride in the whip, spend chips with me
They wanna hit the mall hard and buy kicks with me
They wanna, study my style and bite shit from me
They wanna, roll with me, make dough with me
But when it's drama time, who really back to back with me?
They family, them real niggaz ACT-ually
So when the heat's on, I know who really down with me (down with me)

They wanna, box me in but my style is free (free)
Gotta be me, gotta keep it raunchy and classy
at the same time, intertwined, toyin witcha mind
Pushin the limit, if not, then why would I be in it? (uhh)
If the suit fit, put it on baby and step in it (step in it)
I sleep, when I'm dead and gone - until then it's on
I ain't a killer but don't force me dawg
When my back's against the wall I'ma off ya fa sure
Disappeared from the world, reappear on independent
Lace my kicks up and stomp on the competition
You don't know me duke, believe me, this ain't virtual
Keep, pushin them buttons, I'ma hurt you bro (hurt you bro)
This is real as can be, I ain't no studio nigga
No glass bowl, boxy hole, see-through nigga
Don't test me, your better off takin ya S.A.T.
Fools get dismissed like cash that's counterfeittin
