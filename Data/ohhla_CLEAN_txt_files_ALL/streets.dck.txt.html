[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Is you ready for me, Is you ready for I
Resident Patient, Say shit

[Inspectah Deck]
I grew up gettin it, Crime was a sinch
Till a nigga spent a little time in the pen
Police press me but I won't bend
Right back home and I'm shine'n again
Never could trust, Only got five friends
My right hand Case he let me drive the Benz
Blood in nigga, I'ma ride for him
I'ma kick it wit his seed and provide em ends
Cause the block done caused many lives to end
I said you get shot for just five or ten
You get knocked just for ridin with them
In the end, The ones who survive are men
I played the hallway with the nine double M
Like some up off of them diamond gems
Roll that blunt, We gettin high off him
And aint that long before we ridin again
I said..

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
No matter how hard I try, I find away back inside
No matter how hard I fight, I just can't leave the life
No matter how far I run, Just when I think I'm done
(Streets) The streets keep callin me back
(Streets) The streets keep callin me back
(Streets) The streets keep callin me back
(Streets) The streets keep callin me back

[Inspectah Deck]
I aint really have to spazz out in a while
Yeah a nigga rap but I'm still criminal
And then see a crack is not found in a vial
Move from the gate now, Still chicka-pow
They can't off me I'm on right now
They way they talkin the boy's like "Wow"
I know all yall gone applaud my style
You hate'n now we gettin cake like how
Grit your teeth, Screw your face and frown
Turn about face, Vacate the grounds
And you aint major, Why waste a round
You take it any further then taste the pound
Back up off me don't gaze around
I paid the cost so I'm made in town
And I refuse to be made a clown
I'ma loose everything and just lay you down

[Chorus]</pre>
