Yeah yeah huh
Everybody wanna sip of Bombay
Be coo when the homies slam shit then dip
If he got a strap then he must be ready to trip
If he got his own then he must be ready to flip
If he got yo bitch maybe now she succin his dicc
If he at yo home maybe now he wearin yo shit
I be knowin now, baby I be rollin Eclipse
What ya knowin now ain't you on the run for some shit
Ain't nothin changed in the hood look around
Except we all grown up and don't be givin a fucc
Mr. D-O-C
Ya selfish ass homie take bitches like this
and dump em in a ditch
And ya tape ain't hip
Yo style is a trip
You be slurin and shit
It must be a lisp
I be makin a grip fuckin wit Blacc Market
45 on my hip shushin up in my pocket
It's only me
Say it now "Fucc Doc" wit me
Yo bitch be sayin it when I'm up in the pussy
When I'm makin it bushy it's on me
When you waitin all alone it's on you
What ya wanna do
  
(Chorus)
(Foe Loc)
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What you wan do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What you gon do
  
(Doc)
I took chances and made moves
To be the boss I proved
You can't levatate and fizz if you don't make hits
Like this
Mr. Doc Holiday drinkin Bombay
wit my nigga Slim and Tre
Around the way hoes get fucced
Spend all they loot then ship through the cut
See I don't really about breakin bread
Like my nigga Ced
But I ain't gonna be broke ya dicc head
And realism, Bloccstyle got ya hot
I step bacc and let all these fake niggas lie on they traccs
Yo daddy say that shit so you can know what goes
Now what they about the hood if they ain't did it before
What, they seen it
Ain't you seen it
Swartzanigga ain't shit if he ain't loc 2 da brain bitch
And on the front lawn
Carrying a nine
Like Odysea do that shit all the time
Except me, I keep a 4-5
Cuz if I got hit wit one
They must be the shit and that's on my dicc
See the world's a coo place but ya let it on
Get yo ass involved wit them ones who get you wetted nigga
  
(Chorus)
(Foe Loc)
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What you wan do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What you gon do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What you wan do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What ya wanna do, what ya gonna do
What you gon do
  
(Foe Loc)

Sumpthin ya ought to see
Between you and me

Or approach on your knees
Cuz you can't fucc wit these
