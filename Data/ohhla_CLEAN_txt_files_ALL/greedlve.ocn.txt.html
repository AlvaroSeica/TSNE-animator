[Frank Ocean]
I hate it every time we go out; got everybody complimentin you
You love attention from the big crowd - feels like I'm on the sidelines
Right next to sucker and I am the buster
Girl, who's this other guy thats sending you these flowers?
Oh now you tell me your ex is your best friend

[Chorus]
Call me crazy, but all I want
is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
Oh my, greedy love

[Frank Ocean]
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night
wasn't cause of me, who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always
movie night or girl's night, it feels like I'm ridin the bench
Right next to sucker and I am the buster
Girl - on the dance floor you're showin off your best moves
You see my blown fuse, cause everybody's on you

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Greedy love {*2X*}
Oh my, greedy love
The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm naggin ohhhh
Is wanting only me, too much to ask?
When all I want
is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I call it my greedy love

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Greedy love {*2X*}
Oh my, greedy love</pre>
