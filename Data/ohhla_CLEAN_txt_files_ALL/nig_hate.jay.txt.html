(*talking*)
PJ, the motherfucking Rap Hustler
Boss Hogg Outlawz, you understand
Serve &amp; Collect coming soon, y'all check out them Young Hoggs
They up to bat you know I'm saying, and my boy Slim Thug
The big Boss he coming, you know I'm saying
Boss of All Bosses, y'all gotta go get that shit
Rap Hustling Vol. 1, you know I'm saying
My first mix tape, fuck with a hustler

[PJ]
Niggaz hate to see me on the top, calling shots
I don't give a fuck, if you like me or not
Stay the fuck out my face, I don't entertain hate
I'm a hustler no doubt, I'm controlling my fate
I got God on my side, I'm protected when I ride
Po' some liquor on the curb, for the all soldiers that died
On the mic I'm a beast, from the West to the East
I done been through it all, I was raised by the streets
Coming up shit was hard, in the game with no rules
I got kids to look after, my shorties need shoes
Police on my block, it's another murder scene
Selling crack to the fiends, gotta stack me some green
Keep a gat on my waist, with a clip full of shells
First nigga try to test me, watch I send him to hell
Never stop until it's over, nigga fight to the end
This for all my niggaz dead, or locked up in the Penn what</pre>
