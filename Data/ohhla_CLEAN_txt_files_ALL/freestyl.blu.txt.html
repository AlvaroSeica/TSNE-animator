[Blue Raspberry]
Ooooh... mmmmm.... mmmmm
I've know you've been waiting, for my CD to come out
Baby I will not let you down, no way, no how
Cuz Blue Raspberry, gonna blow up, going strong
Ooooh, go up... oooh... I know you've been waiting
I know you've been waiting, but you don't have to wait for long
Ooooh... I can kick it acapella, with no music behind me
There's no, noise to make my voice better
No, no, no, nothing, this is all raw for you...</pre>
