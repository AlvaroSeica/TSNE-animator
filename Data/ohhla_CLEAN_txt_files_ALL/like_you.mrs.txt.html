[Chorus 2x: MURS &amp; Slug]
I walk like, talk like, sleep like, breathe like, be like people do
Live like, give like, work like, hurt like, end up in the dirt like you

[Slug] + (Murs)
Woke up, overslept
so much for startin' the day with no regrets
Begin with the daily addiction (Routine)
get your machine in position
Gotta go get it, gotta go figure out what it is that you're tryin' to get
Shake, rattle, and roll the dice
on a table full of chips that are dyin' to live

[MURS] + (Slug)
Get up, one leg at a time
Eyes on the prize, mind on the grind
toes on the floor, heart in my chest
Open up the door, start up the stress
(Unless) I lose my blues
erase my mind of the don'ts and the do's
The laws and the rules are meant to be broken
Thought's not pure if the mind's not open
Close the curtains, dim the lights
Back to sleep, I can't win this fight
(In a few minutes, it'll be alright)
You gotta play wit the hand your dealt, cause that's life

[Chorus 1x: MURS &amp; Slug]
I walk like, talk like, sleep like, breathe like, be like people do
Live like, give like, work like, hurt like, end up in the dirt like you

[Slug]
Now they want the messiah to come to town
but when the phoenix flew, somebody shot it down
They found it dead with its head underground
and there wasn't enough bird to go around

[MURS]
Huh, getcha game tight, getcha brain right
You can shine like the stars in the same light
Getcha aim right, insane hype
You ain't shootin for the moon then you ain't tight
(Weakness) Never been a traitor to veteran
Life's not a great big hole you can settle in
Climb up, neck out, take risks
Beware of the hate and the snakes in this shit

[Slug] + (MURS)
You can pop a sheriff, like Bob or Eric
You can get too high and fall off the terrace
You can get embarrassed, but live it careless
And do ya best to never get your merits
We wanna stay content
Fill the belly (And pay the rent)
but the game is bent, they didn't say what they meant
Then the main event came and went, spent

[Chorus 2x: MURS &amp; Slug]
I walk like, talk like, sleep like, breathe like, be like people do
Live like, give like, work like, hurt like, end up in the dirt like you

[MURS]
I got problems, I got issues
I'm not perfect, but I can still diss you
I got a chip on my shoulder
and it's weighin' on my pride like a boulder

[Slug]
So let it loose, what can you do?
What do you hold to show that the soul got?
Somethin' to prove? We know the truth
but tell me why it gotta move like a robot?

[MURS]
Now if ya MMA, or ya liftin weights
it only takes one bullet to twist ya fate
You gotta watch ya step, you gotta watch ya mouth
Cause we all know the way that a punk goes out

[Slug] +(MURS)
I guess (we watch) the same damn channel
Range, free thoughts came with the ammo

[MURS]
You did what you did, now you do what you do
You at where ya at when you walk in them shoes

(Slug) + (MURS)
Did you come to fuck? (Or did you come to fight?)
Well, maybe I'm here just to love my life
Until they cut the price of goin bump in the night
Gotta get up, get out and do somethin', right?

[MURS]
Walk - talk - sleep - breathe - be
Live - give - work - hurt

[MURS + Slug]
...like you!</pre>
