(*talking*)
Huh, Double D, E.S.G., D-Gotti
Wreckshop baby, yeah, come on, yeah

[Double D]
It was a dream, formulating a team with a scheme
Stepping up in the ring, with niggaz who making green
Let's put the past behind, mash on the rhyme
Man surround ourself, with smart niggaz on the grind
Representing the cause, a rebel without a pause
Knowing that running bitches, ain't the way to shot call
And some of y'all be falling face first, when you think
You at the bottom, it can always get worst
So first things first nigga, keep your mind off that gold digger
And don't be giving in the Nol' nigga
I make sho' I get the do' quicker, before I'm done
I bet that ass get the whole picture, the whole picture

[Hook - 2x]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Send this to all my niggaz on the grind
For a million and dealing with these streets
Everyday is a struggle, we steady working muscle
Trying to piece the puzzle

[D-Gotti]
It's been a struggle since birth, out here trying to make it work
Seeing mama on welfare, and daddy steady doing dirt
It hurt feel a nigga, situation I mean
No discipline, plus we hotter since my skin my scene
My team, always a prospect for the Penn
Pray for dividends, corner sto' it's all blood trying to win
And the clock spinning time went, the game gots on
15 on chrome, and mama hate I got condoned
It's on 16 sitting on nine, mama she dying
I could bump and grind, long as the bills on time
By now, I'm capitalizing on a career
Visualize in a mirror, the epidemy of a street mercenteer
Now I'm in real Gucci sweaters, carried nothing but a baretta
Gave the groove back to Stella, and now these times got better
Got the Benz paint got wetter, gotta feel that
Picture perfect in your face, and D-Gotti he painted that

[Hook - 2x]

[E.S.G.]
Trying to paint a perfect picture, but my paint keep dripping
No negotiating with the hatas, nigga we can't be tripping
Skipping school flipping rude, trying to stack me some green
Sick and tired of me and my brother, sharing three pair of jeans
Step daddy dope fiend, biological missing
So now it's a must, I put it down in the kitchen
Palms itching, niggaz bitching and snitching, I ain't switching
Million dolla mission, taking niggaz positions
I'm the new quarterback, you want your starter back
Notorious E.S.G., wrecking shit on harder tracks
Flip flop, drip drop, drop top, Wreckshop
Bleed the block, leave it hot, then we hit the next spot
Over here, over there, playas bouncing everywhere
Album after album, other labels say it ain't fair
Fat Pat, E.S.G., Pimp Tyte, NWO
By the time Ronnie come out, everything is in the sto'
