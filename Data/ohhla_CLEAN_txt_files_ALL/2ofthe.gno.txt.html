G'eah, hey mayn what happen when you put
Two of the thoedest niggaz out of Texas on a track
Let me see what you get, you get fire
Well that's what it is, ok then run the shit nigga hey

[Killa Kyleon]
Southside, that's my hood
Put it in your face, get that shit understood
And uh Boss Hogg, that's my click
If a nigga got plex, I'ma dig in his shit
Kyleon, that's my name
Boss Hogg Outlawz, that's my gang
84's candy paint, gripping my grain
If you don't understand, that's a H-Town thang
Flows like crack-caine, y'alls be wimps
Hating on a hustler, y'all niggaz be a trip
I'ma choke my dro, I'ma sip my sip
Ride behind tint, as I flip my whip
Killa stick to the script, stay on the grind
M-O-B, I keep money on my mind
H-Town find, I'm a 45 flipper
If you niggaz got plex, I'm a 45 gripper
This ain't the Bossman, this his hit man Killa
Ask boys bout me mayn, this man iller nigga

(*talking*)
Yeah, Magno ya heard
Wildlife Records, run it

[Magno]
Do my thang, swang in a dropper
Cutting up the street, I bring beef like a whopper
Half the time, I don't speak to a bopper
I be eating on a lobster, in a meeting with a mobster
Catch me at the church house, with heat up in my Dockers
Y'all niggaz is actors, competing for a Oscar
Your boy bitch, so you know he'll switch ya shit
I customize the snub, to fit my loc ear swivel clip
Yeah, and I'm holding in these streets
I fuck up your vocab, your clothing and your speech
That's right, Magno the coldest
Blimp in the sky, read "Magno the Thoedest"
Fuck the election, I hope y'all quoting
I pop trunk on two Republicans, when they was voting
Fucked up the ballot, the game I might just luck up and grab it
Karats in my chain, like I stuck up a rabbit
Taking broads cash flow, just got a car deal look out for the Dodge Magno
It's kinda hard for you frauds, to dodge Magno
I'm everywhere like the law, golds in my jaw
Sipping on the bar, flipping 4's in the car
Where that kin folk Joe, he ran into a hoe
Who had a tat on her back, that said "New Print in Stores"
That's the promo hoe
Watch your boy, when I swang that fo-do' go

(*talking*)
Yeah that's what that is dog, right there daddy
Magno ya heard, New Print in sto's mayn
You know I'm saying, put it down straight like that
Wildlife Records, yeah</pre>
