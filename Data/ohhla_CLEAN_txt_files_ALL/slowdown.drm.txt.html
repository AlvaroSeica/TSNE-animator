Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
I know they ain't gon play this on top 40 radio
But the white girls still gon' ride it like a rodeo
And I'ma stay ridin' this beat like a rodeo
And keep throwin' money til shorty gon' touch her toes
I'ma keep it real with you baby you bad
Kinda like Michael Jackson you bad
If you was my girl and left me I be sad
And for that let me see that ass

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I'm here to see that thing pop
I'm here to see that thing rock
I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop
She backin' it up on me, DJ you know you wrong
Enough with the mothafuckin dance songs

[Chorus: The-Dream]
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me babe
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me babe
You gotta slow it down down down,
Down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Thats what she likes

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Now she rollin that and whippin' her hair
Slow motion with it while everyone stares
You can see her ass from the side of her like
Back and forth, forth and back
Show me what they do to that
Always with ya baby I'll never sell out
Them other niggaz had to do a dance record
All the label wouldn't put em out
Ill never put a million records before you
Just keep on doing that thing you do

[Bridge]
I'm here to see that thing pop
I'm here to see that thing rock
I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop
She backin' it up on me, DJ you know you wrong
Enough with the mothafuckin dance songs

[Chorus]
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me babe
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me babe
You gotta slow it down down down,
Down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Thats what she likes

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Everybody know slow money way better than no money
Except for those who don't know shit
Don't know woman don't know money
It starts out I'm so cool
We hangin' out and I'm so funny
All of a sudden I'm Winnie the Pooh
All up in your honey
Pants on her slim fit
Lights in the room dim lit
And I'm feelin' on your booty on some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit
Pants on her slim fit
Lights in the room dim lit
And I'm feelin' on your booty on some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit

[Chorus]
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me babe
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me babe
You gotta slow it down down down,
Down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Thats what she likes

[Outro: The-Dream]
I'ma keep it real with you baby you bad
Kinda like Michael Jackson you bad
If you was my girl and left me I be sad
And for that let me see that ass</pre>
