[Chorus]
I'm tired of arguin and fightin girl
Every night you keep callin me with the same shit
I'm goin insane
I swear I love but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way
Its gonna kill me to say but you gotta

Pack your stuff leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
I've told you that I'm moving on
You did it where, you had to know
 
[Verse 1]
To how to shape and mold you I admit was my mission
But everythin went wrong dear 'cause you started acting different
The day you ran up on me I was smokin, chillin
Swore you was tryin to roll aint know what was so appealin'
Fast forward, I'm on the road, you at home callin me back forth
Can't deal with this relationship, but this what you asked for
Ask for them pictures of them bitches, shit
I probably wouldn't be with them , if your ass wasn't trippin'
Not to mention you're acting like a kid ss the fuck shit I gotta deal with
Send a text, leave me a message try not to listen
Bring the rap you was the main player I had to bench you
When I showed your ass how to ball, that Louie I bought it all

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Gone on the road that I'm hardly home on the weekend
You be blowin my phone up tryin to see who I'm seein
But I'm chasin this paper so for this paper I'm reachin
Might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheatin
I consider the fact that we'll break up anyway, anyway
Based on all that shit you don't appreciate
Me switchin states, workin hard, meetin dates
And you were thinkin everythin was sweet piece of cake
Well that all changed, what we had was big
But you're gonna miss the small things
And that little cash I spent that was small change
But above all things I still love you, just gotta do my own thing

[Chorus]

I'll go, I'll never come back
Now when you call, I never call back
'Cause I got a new girl, yeah I got a new girl
Everything was all good, then went all bad
And no I don't think about the times that we had
'Cause I got a new girl, yeah I got a new girl

Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Oh (x8)</pre>
