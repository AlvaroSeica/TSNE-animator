Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
It must have been a dream but it felt so real
Saw the wounds, heard the screams, thought about your last meal
How we ate like kings, how you led us all in grace
How nobody had forseen what would soon take place
And when everything went down
The silence you left was the strangest sound
Dangerous town but we all felt safe
Cause we knew that you slept with the angels now
Rumors keep coming in
A few thousand missing you just like me
People keep running into you
I've got a feeling that you might be alive

(Rata tat tat, bum bum bum bum
It's the sound of a gat and the sound of a drum
But whatever you attach to is what you become
One plus one, double horizontal line one)

[Chorus]
This is not fair, this is not pure, this is not right
Trust me, when it's all over you will see the light
Live by the sword, die by the sword, but Jesus Christ
We shot that motherfucker right between the eyes

I offer these thoughts on loss and having
You're here but you're not, you're near but you're not
I offer these thoughts on loss and having
You're here but you're not, you're near but you're not

[Verse 2]
Staring at the safety sleeve
These tingling feelings just won't leave
I can't sleep, anxiety dreams
I need a repreive, I need caffeine
Set the stage, my lips don't seem, [?]
Walking the streets, haunted by beats
Follow my lead by the loss that I bleed
Scream in the dark, but it's off key
Bow breaks in the powerful breeze
I hold my breath and the hours would freeze
'Til they tomorrows may bring
Squandered time didn't know you would leave
Part of me was lost in the sea
And the cost of these losses I found it in me
Replacing my friends [?]

[Chorus]
This is not fair, this is not pure, this is not right
Trust me, when it's all over you will see the light
Live by the sword, die by the sword, but Jesus Christ
We shot that motherfucker right between the eyes

I offer these thoughts on loss and having
You're here but you're not, you're near but you're not
I offer these thoughts on loss and having
You're here but you're not, you're near but you're not</pre>
