[Intro: Rubbabandz]
Allow me to introduce myself, for ya'll who don't know
I go by the name of Bandz, Rubbabandz, the original Rubbabandz
Staten Island, New York, Stapleton Projects
I'm 'bout to go in this one right here
P.J. 27 Warrant Street, what up New York?

[Rubbabandz]
If the money ain't right, that mean the love ain't right
I'm on a certified gold album, and didn't see a thousand
I'm from the Stapleton Project Housing, Ghostface in the next building
The rest of the Wu right up the street Park Hilling
The project next door, they used to come through knock on my cousin R door
I remember Method Man smacked a ham sandwich out my hand
I stopped eating pork back then, and I ain't God Body
And I ain't Muslim, I did it just because I looked up to him
Sixteen with a dollar and dream, and I can never understand C.R.E.A.M.
Cuz Cash don't Rule shit Around Me, family come first
Until I'm riding out in that long black herse
I remember RZA put that contract in my hand
He told me a hundred and fifty grand, and I ain't playing
Then I listened to my man Shyheim, and didn't sign shit
He said put a bullet in a dead fish mouth, leave it on RZA doorstep
Not too long later, he signed with RZA, some real greaseball ass shit
He ain't wanna see me shine anyway, no love lost, cuz it was never none there
And then I started catching funny vibes in the air
They started treating Bandz like I didn't exist
And Erick Sermon tried to snatch me up so quick
And Irv Gotti hollered at me at the Ice Cream video shoot
Like "Bandz, I'm try'nna fuck with you, fuck with me and let's get money"
Next thing I know I'm in the studio with Kid Capri
But those politics was on me...

[Interlude: Rubbabandz]
I know ya'll listening to this right now, like
Man, who is this nigga, man, this Rubbabandz, man
Just to let ya'll know, man, and it's all real, man
I don't fabricate, I don't cry wolf
Everything I'm telling you is the facts, knawimean?
I speak from the heart, Staten Island, New York, all day
I've done been through a lot, I've done seen a lot of shit
I've done been around the world once, spoke to everybody twice
Hardbod' nigga, knawimean? Yo, let me tell you something
I've done did a lot of shit, in this music game, knawimean
And I'm still paying my muthafucking dues, sixteen, fifteen years later
Shit is real out there, but, I'm determined, nigga
Without a doubt, nigga, I'mma keep it moving, nigga
I ain't gonna give up until I get that muthafucking house on a hill, nigga
And that Rolls-Royce and that Bentley, nigga
You feel me? One hundred, man, I'm out, peace</pre>
