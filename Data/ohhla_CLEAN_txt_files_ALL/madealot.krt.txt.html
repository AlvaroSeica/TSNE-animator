[Chorus: 8Ball &amp; MJG "On Top of the World" sample]
"Made a lot of cheese (cheese), people say I changed
 Made a, made a lot of cheese (cheese), people say I changed
 Made a, made a lot of cheese, people, people say I changed
 But if you thinking that you never knew me from the gate
 Made a, made a lot of cheese (cheese), people say I changed
 Made a, made a lot of cheese (cheese), people say I changed
 Made a, made a lot of cheese, people, people say I changed
 But if you thinking that you never knew me from the gate mayne"

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ay, well fuck it then... cause I'd rather ride bubble Benz
than push a bucket brake, scrubbing paint, bubbling up again
on my hood, gotta get it while the getting good
A chemist with the pimping, mix the leather with the cherry wood
If you could you should, slam doors on hoes
I fifth-wheel my trunk while white-walling my Vogues
I tight-walk on these foes just to flex
Ain't no sense in stepping out if I can't never look my best
Damn, don't stress my bankroll, just know I keep my bank swoll'
Ain't no place I can't go, never trick on no stank hoe
It was like that back when I was in my momma's stomach
A player slid up out the womb and hit the ground running, never stumbling
Always gunning like a popped Glock, keep a hater boxed out
so I could rebound and ball for the top spot
All the same, I'm a staple in the game
Ain't never been no lame, that's why I find it strange when I

[Chorus]

[Big Sant]
Uh, who the fuck are you?
Texting me at 1:46 in the evening, meant the morning, after midnight
While I'm yawning, you were sleeping
Four-door Chevy roll, I'm out there creeping, slamming doors in
heavy things, but I want some more with player pose
Roll up on hoes that say they knew me from high-school
Maybe community college, claim they wanna do some thangs but I can do without it
My momma named "such and such", and we go back like baby powder
Baby I doubt it, it's hard to swallow, you wanna lay up, I want a dollar
for the machine, I'm kinda thirsty
A little parched, she wanna ride, no you cannot
She say I'm mean, I say just to hoes, and dumb niggas
Kind of like you, them bees and does
Reject request on Facebook, daily ducking lames
All you know is my partner and 'nem and my name
Plus you heard that I

[Chorus]

[Big Sant]
You probably see me in the street, but nigga you don't know me
Big Sant bitch, motherfucking O.G.
From the 'Sip, get a grip, wanna visit? Take a trip
Ain't a nigga dead or alive that can say that I done flipped
I'm from the land of the cheese, home of the slave
Don't confuse me with no lame, cause that's just what I ain't
Alumni forever, put that on the nigga next to me
Started out writing rhymes, ended up writing a legacy

[Big K.R.I.T.]
They hollering there he go again, what's his name? Where his folk?
Call him Kurt? Call him K.R.I.T.? Fuck that nigga, I ain't sure
He got beats, heard him flow like a couple years ago
He alright, kinda tight, shawty like him on the low
There he go, too much soul, I wouldn't buy it out the sto'
cause I saw him in the club, he's the one who hollered at my hoe
So because he got some dough from a deal, he think he ill
I bet that's how that motherfucker feel, and on the real, I think he changed</pre>
