[Mr. Shadow]
I'ma ride on you mothafuckas, I dun had it
Bitch I'ma thugs that sells drugs and brings static
Status of a king play your minds like strings
Shoot any mothafucka like it ain't no thing
Blink, enemies against walls I'm an outlaw
Make a punk snitch say my name before I break his jaw
Make him crawl like a snail leavin trails of blood
The only thing you got to witness was the smell of bud
No love for imposters they get assualted
Make a mothafucka bleed out the eye socket
Out smarted any fool that ever tried to come close
The barrel of my snub is pointed right above they nose
Bullet holes cover your close for tryin to act like a hoe
Got you in the basement facin hell with no where else to go [go]
It's Mr. Shadow the mothafucka always chiefin
Flipin off the world sayin fuck what you believe in

[Chorus]
Fuck what you believe in
I'm leavin bodies bleedin
With need of paramedic treatment
911 could resue you if they hurried
They arrived at the scene
And found your body getting burried
[Repeat]

[Mr. Shadow]
Now lay your ass down and don't say a fuckin word
Aim at mothafuckas like a deer in a herd
[Gun shots] Plow, the shot is heard in the distance
Break a fool down from a prince to a princess
God as my witness
I feel the sickness of a monster heart full of rage
That's why I pack a revolver and a switch blade
Bitch made fools get hurt in a brawl
After all your boys are dead who the fuck you gonna call
Don't stall when you talk me
Studderin, I'ma murder that mothafucka for liein
Want me dead then keep tryin
I'm still on the grind back handed fools like ghost
Throwin up the 2-0 and stayin the fuck away from 5-0
Life on Deigo streets we bring nothin but raw scenes
On gangs drugs and guns from the slums of SD
See, I play for keeps and all my people feel the same
So fuck what you believe in, I'ma let the fuckin shot reign

[Chorus]

[Mr. Shadow]
Intimidation's what you feel when I'm walking towards ya
Look you in the eye, give a grin and then ignore ya
Damn ain't that a trip this mothafucka must be tweakin
That's what you were thinkin but you're life is what I'm seakin
Speakin from the domes puffin green types of dubs [dubs]
Kickin it with fuckin felons a family full of thugs
Slugs bein busted no man is being trusted
For those who thought I wasn't I'm blasted you and your cousin
Lovin every second of this mothafuckin rush
If anybody's watching no stopin it from the hush
It was me with the one with guns in my arms bringin harm
Settin to break alarms droppin bombs I'ma con
Gone out my mind when I choke on my leaf
The last man standin fuck a nation under peace
War is now decleared leave your troops all bleedin
Ain't no one leavin so fuck what you believe in

[Chorus]</pre>
