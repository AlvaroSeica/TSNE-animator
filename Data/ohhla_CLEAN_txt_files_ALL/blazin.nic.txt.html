[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin, I'm blazin, feels like I'm blazin
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin, I'm blazin, feels like I'm blazin
Feels like I'm

[Nicki Minaj]
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me
You was hecklin me, now it's monotony when I regularly
Yo, I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
the contract was on but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everythin is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the palms and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
ahh, ha hahahaha ha, I'm the best now
Anybody where's the money? should invest now
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'
Your game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Muh'fuckers aint ready, they neva been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

[Chorus]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin, I'm blazin, feels like I'm blazin
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin, I'm blazin, feels like I'm blazin
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin, I'm blazin, feels like I'm blazin
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin, I'm blazin, feels like I'm blazin

[Kanye West]
Ugh, yea, ugh
This is the moment grab your Kodak while I'm flyin 
With a flow that is the greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been craze and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire?
Where we flyin, they can't find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist then, I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend 
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end
I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, Im crazy I'm sayin
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is a fac, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per' uhh, Prada coloured babes
It obvi' we the ishh and I'm rollin with my bricks
So real you so trill, baby everything legit
How you feel, they say we crazed cause our styles so diff'
They be jail when we in the mag lookin magnif'
As if I aint used Magnums on your favourite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib
Add this, we blazin', Nicki what you think
I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks
ah hahahaha

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'

[Chorus]</pre>
