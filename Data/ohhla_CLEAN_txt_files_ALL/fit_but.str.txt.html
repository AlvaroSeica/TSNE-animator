Excuse me girl
I know its a bit embarrassing
but I just noticed some tan lines..
On your shirt!

See I reckon you're about an 8 or a 9
Maybe even 9 and a half in four beers time
That blue top shop top you've got on IS nice
Bit too much fake tan though - but yeah you score high
But theres just one little thing that really really
Really really annoying me about you you see
Yeah yeah like I said you are really fit
But my gosh don't you just know it

[Chorus]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

So when I looked at you standing there with your hoard
I was waiting in the que looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a Burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction
Your eyes locked onto my course
I couldnt concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which cost me my place in the queue I waited for YEAH

[Chorus]

Whoa! Leave it out
Are you smoking something?
Leave it out
Mike just leave it just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
S'not worth it mike, just leave it
Don't Touch Me, S'not Worth It
Don't Touch Me, D, Look I'm Alright Don't Touch me

For a while there I was thinkin - yeah but what if?
Picturin' myself pullin with bare white hot wit
Snarin you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didnt tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clockin onto you too yeah I had to admit
That yeah yeah you are fit
And yeah I do want it
But I stop sharkin' for a minute to get chips and drinks

[Chorus]

Oy, just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smilin hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty hearty lookin tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that white shirted man

[Chorus]

Oh what do I give .. I've got a girlfirend anyway
(whoa, we've all had a drink mate)
We're all a bit drunk, yeah we've had a few fair play
I got this stella I bombed from that last cafe
This nights not even begun, yes yes oh yay
I did fancy you a bit though yeah I must say
I would rather I hadnt mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
On otherwise a total result of a holiday

[Chorus]</pre>
