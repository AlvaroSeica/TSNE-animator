J Formz: Yeah, J Formz. Yo this me man, it's just the way I am. I don't know
why I made the choices I made. But I did it and that's that. And I accepted
that you know what I'm sayin'? Check this..

[J Formz]
I aint grow up in the gutter, but I'm headed right for it
And I guess my ex girl was the only one who saw it
What you know about growin' up in my shoes?
Yeah I know them cats do the same things I do
But I aint have no excuse
I didn't grow up in the PJ's, I didn't have to shoot
Didn't have to hustle to make loot, I chose to
Now the bottom is the only place I rose to
My parents cared about me, tried to make me do right
But looks like I was wrong and you was right
Just dropped out of college, fuck life
I chose to live my life wrong, somewhere inside I said "Fuck right"
Sittin' up nights
Thinkin' bout how I turned a good situation to a fucked up life
I can feel it, believe me I know exactly where I'm headed
I made mad mistakes but I'll never regret 'em

[Chorus]
I know exactly the choices I made man. I'll never regret nothin' in my life
One day I hope I could look back and say I know why I did the things I did
But until then, I'mma say this...It's my life, real shit

[J Formz]
In my life 20 years passed
But for like the first 15 I was headed for the clear path
Then I seen that green, it was right there
Street life and a team, I could go right there
Started hustlin', I was down for the green
Yeah, I loved my girl, but I was down for my team
She seen where I was goin', knew she couldn't count on me
She loved me but I chose this, she hadda bounce on me
I guess since I didn't have it that bad
Subconsciously, I made myself act bad
Some cats were just put in their situation
They had no choice but I chose to be in the shit I'm facin'
So who wants it more
When you was forced to play the part and I chose to be hardcore?
Made the wrong choices, I know I could still feel it
But the streets is callin', I could still hear it

[Chorus]
I feel it man, I'm fuckin' shit up. This is how I'm doin' me, it's my life
We ready and willing. Hear me out one more time

[J Formz]
Now I could try and go back, but I know it's too late
All my life I never really believed in fate
But now I feel like I was meant to be like this
It's like I got no choice, it's just gon' be like this
No matter what I do, cause the streets is in me
I see a lot of loved ones is reachin' to me
But instead, I turn away and bring myself to this pain
I wasn't born in the hustle, I put myself in this game
And I'm never gon' change, that's a choice I've made
So it's either the street life or me up on the stage
G-Town: you know nuthin' about us
Bein' a thug, sellin' drugs, the only things I got left to be proud of
My words is clear, my actions sincere
I'm still tryin' to figure out really why I'm here
Cause I can't deal with no deal, I wish I could steal it
And I know I fucked up, believe me, I could feel it

J Formz: Every night man, I wonder why I do the things I do. I wonder why I
dropped out and why I started sellin' for. It's just in me man, thug 'til the
day I die son. Ghostown</pre>
