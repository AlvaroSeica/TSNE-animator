[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Baby grind on me, relax your mind take your time on me
Let me deeper shawty, ride on me
Now come and sex me 'til your body gets weak
We slow grinding baby

[VERSE 1]
When I hit 'em I make 'em say (Oh)
Sex be my day (JOB)
I hit 'em in the back of my (CAR)
Make 'em ride like a see (SAW)
I make 'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Suck on the nipple
Lick the whip cream from the middle
Girlfriend I never go (RAW)
I rip off panties and I pop off (BRAS)
B.L.U.E.S.T.A. (R)
Ask around the block how freaky we (ARE)
I drink Red Bull so I keep stamina
Rubbing your belly
Busting your brains
Whats my name (whats my name)
Pretty Rickie, Pretty Boy
doing pretty good thangs
Making pretty good change
Yeah pretty good breaks
From the pretty, pretty chicks
Yeah pretty damn rich
pretty Rickie, Rickie Rickie
and the Mavericks

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2]
Lay on your back let me put this cream on ya baby
Slow motion bout to put this thing on ya baby
Staring in your eyes
Bout to lick them thighs
Got cha Hypnotized
Do you feel the vibe?
(OOOOOOOOOOOOOO)
Staring in your eyes
Bout to lick them thighs
Got cha hypnotized
Do you feel the vibe?
(STEP 1)- ya kissisng on me
(STEP 2)- girl I'm caressing your body
(STEP 3)- now I'm licking off the whip cream
(STEP 4)- and oooh you're grinding on me

[Chorus]

[VERSE 3]
Slick got more game than a little bit
Baby girl 5' 5", brown eyes with them thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar honey, ice tea
Baby girl is the shhhhhhhh
and a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she coming home
Like side with a cherry thong
Eat her up like a sundae cone
But as of morning you got me open
Your tongue is stroking no joking
Coochie swollen, the bedroom smoking
GET SOME AIR UP IN THIS ROOM GIRL
(beathes heavily)
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
So I'ma take my time and do it right
Caz we got all night ..... caz we got all night, baby girl just

[Chorus]</pre>
