Alright it's going down like this right here
You push you pay, nahmsayin, everything counts, the trips you pay double
Keep your back straight and count them out loud

C'mon C'mon

50 in the Clip, get big; get big
50 in the Clip, get big; get big
50 in the Clip, get big; get big
On the palms, on the fingertips, on the wrists, on the fists
50 in the Clip, get big; get big
50 in the Clip, get big; get big
50 in the Clip, get rip; get big
On the palms, on the fingertips, on the wood, on the brick

[Verse 1]
Jump and roll doing kicks, basic drills with the sticks
50 push-ups in the clip, on the fists on the brick
Getting swoll on the block, lifting weights at the gym
Take the kids to the park do some techniques with them
Throw that hook, work that cross, stick and move, tap that jaw
Tiger claw, Lion paw, Iron palm can't be soft
Life is hard on the block, put your heart on the spot
You gon' ride or you're not, bomb first get the drop

[talking]
Pay me, that's head crack boy
That fever ain't got nuthin on that
And stay away from the corners
Tracing burners, you heard me

[Verse 2]
Getting big wit the clique, keep it tight like a fist
Everybody hit the deck nigga four, five, six
Add it up, hit the block, no shirt, tatted up
Skinny niggaz getting cut, since it's two get them knees up
Ain't no girl push-ups, RBG's fifty-fifty
Let me see what you got
Nigga don't just watch me, do 'em with me
You can do it, you look rev'd from your gut not your chest
Push 'em out, make them count go all out, count them out nigga

[talking]
4,5,6 look at that boy, go together just like Red, Black and Green boy
You looking at Fred, Huey and George right there
Word up, time to pay up, put your muscle where your mouth is
Get big, count them out

50,49,48,47	Get big
46,45,44,43	Get big
42,41,40,39	Push 'em out
	38	Get big
	37	Get big
	36	Get big
	35	Get big
34,33,32,31	Get big
30,29,28,27	Get big

	20	Get big
       19 	Get big
18,17,16,15	Get big
