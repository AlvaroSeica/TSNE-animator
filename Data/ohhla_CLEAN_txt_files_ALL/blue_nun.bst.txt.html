Our evening began
in Peter Sichel's comfortable study
in his New York townhouse
Where the candlelight was just right
The hi-fi was in the background
And the wine, was delicious

{*partying and laughter*}

[Woman] What's the secret Peter?
[Peter] Naturally, I'll say it's the wine
[Woman] Mmmm, it does go well with the chicken!

Delicious again Peter</pre>
