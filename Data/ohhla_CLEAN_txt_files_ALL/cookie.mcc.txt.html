Southern belle from the A-T-L
Eyes set on mind melt, she makes my heart swell
I love the way she feels, I love the way she smells
I love the way she talks, I love the stories she tells
There's nothing I don't like, sold hook, line and sinker
She's got this rapper wrapped around her manicured finger
She's dramatic and simple, kinetic and nimble
She's a fickle little riddle and she makes me go mental
I'm in love that's the one thing that I'm sure of
Can't get enough of this stuff, can't get enough of her hugs
She makes me not want to drink or do any drugs
Hold her forever until the sun comes up

[Chorus: mc chris]
Why oh why won't you be mine?
I tried so hard not to cry
Can't contain what lies inside
Could you call me up and just say hi?
Why oh why won't you leave that guy?
Why oh why must I be denied?
When oh when will the time arrive
when you look me in the eyes and say you're mine?

[mc chris]
Southern belle from the bible belt
Together forever, only time will tell
Until I know for sure, now that I'm in hell
When you kiss me deep know that it's deeply felt
My eyes well up when your car pulls up
Feel like a dumb fuck that's shit out of luck
Love bites, love bleeds, love fucking sucks
Feel so stuck in a rut, knowing your love is a must
Are we really just friends, will this night ever end?
I tried to imply that it was all just pretend
But a lie that size makes a man a mess
Oh, when will I see you again?

[Chorus]</pre>
