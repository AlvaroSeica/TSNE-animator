Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus]
Forever is a mighty long time
I do it for the South and them folks that held me down
Forever in the game, forever Multi
Forever gettin mine, forever Underground
(What's a king without a crown hoe?)
...
(What's a car without some sound hoe?)
...
(What's a king without a crown hoe?)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Sometimes all I need is bass
and a little liquor to ease my mind a bit
Cause even when you polished, niggaz won't let you shine for shit
That pot to piss in turned into a house on hill
I'm talkin two stories no fabrication, that's a true story f'REAL
And ain't no ghostwriter, my flow tighter than gorilla fists
Keep it poppin like hot grease, fried up with yo' catfish
Cutthroats with that bucket seats, bust a quiche, I split her peach
Young Krizzle, fruit ninja, +Crouching Tiger, Hidden Freak+
Hoe wassup, I got mo' to tell ya (Let's go!)
Dreams is cheap I got mo' to sell ya (Let's go!)
Crush linen, grain grippin, don't touch my buttons
I hate it when a bitch gets overzealous
SO CHILL HOE! (Let's go!)
I got a point to prove, that's the reason I rhyme fo'
Third coast, I put it down fo'
What's a king without a crown hoe?

[Chorus]
Forever is a mighty long time
I do it for the South and them folks that held me down
Forever in the game, forever Multi
Forever gettin mine, forever Underground
(What's a king without a crown hoe?)
(What's a king without a crown? What's a king with a crown?)
(What's a car without some sound hoe?)
(What's a car without some sound? What's a car without a sound?)
(What's a king without a crown hoe?)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
K-R, I-T, one mo' time for them folk that didn't know
Two mo' time for them folk that didn't listen
Three mo' time for them folk that said growth
was impossible, for a country bo'
Like they could spit, like they could flow
Shawty everybody wanna be a rapper
But err'ybody out cain't do a show (Dats right!)
So I'm slammin doors and work the wheels on her
Pop my bands and pop a bill on her
Shit changed since +K.R.I.T. Wuz Here+
I raise my glass and crack a seal on her
Cause I deserve that, got a old school
Let me swerve that, in my own lane
I make my own beats, I write my own rhymes
I grip my own grind, I grip my own grain
And that's royalty... how else I'm s'posed to live?
I made due with what God gave, I do exactly what I feel
Yeah I play my part and I gave my heart and I represent for my crib
Just like them kaings that came before me, I'ma keep it trill
Let's go! (What's a king without a crown hoe?)
