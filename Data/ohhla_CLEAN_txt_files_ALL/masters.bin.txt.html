[Intro]
(These styles is unknown to)..
The two headed dragon
...(these styles is unknown to)
...the two headed dragon

[Senim]  Yo and it goes on y'all
[Tekniq] uh huh..

(you don't know me and you don't know my style [Method Man])

[Verse 1]
The two headed dragon breathes fire, blows flames, veins pumping octane
blazing plain, same brain
Same ankle that enabled Kain to slew that's a sharp blade
Whether your willing or able I see your stockade
I'm from an age where I just played caption
It's passin' the fact that what you really tougue lashin'
Yo and we strikin' they backs like they card cold the dashin'
Can't escape slavery boy
I'm still the master of natural disaster this rap tougue twister
Emergin' from Waterworld the mightly world wind
Microphone cyclone blowing in your ears like your girlfriend
Till the world ends all these minds puttin' work in
Employ these toys on a job and we'll see what the hell they was thinkin'
Must've been drunk
What the hell was they drinkin'?
Why, are these rules?
Broke as hell in a Lincoln
Head on collisions in these rap competitions
My crew cats record turns their frames into scrape metal
Off to the junk yard
Cuz ain't nobodies on my rap level you can ask the devil
It ain't no way in hell these contenders can hender
Remember, guard your fender, from a friender
Mista so now I'm Silla, sinister swindla
I brought you stigmas when your hides bust in line a temper
This is a warning to you men
We're joining these tournaments of journalists and live by the pen
Now die by the sword
Tears through your gourd, got you through the mic cord
It's fine but explored, but just fine wine is poured
Now toast to this, as we pour a little out for those who..

...be approaching this (7x)

[Verse 2]
Battle vocalist the one man army in a war against a bliss
Rockin' knowledge brings a weaponist
Don't just step to this
I sent Pharoahe messages like Moses takin' my people on an exodus
We on the run, I split the m-i-c open
Kids try to follow but get swallowed in the ocean
Preacher of the truth, I'm believers makin' mockery
It ain't no stoppin' me, I fulfill all prophecy
Similar to David with the rock, I sling shots at your bestest warrior plus
I'm ill with the poetry
You know its me but you still couldn't catch us, manuever on the mic or loss
heads like John the Baptist
When I rap this whack MC's feel the rapture
Others fugitive style your brains couldn't capture
Ever since the beginning of time
Let there be light
That's the first day, I wrote my first rhyme
I'm still writin', I seen you lookin' at 'em, but don't even think about
bitin'
Forbidden poetry is a life
Dig these, your ass couldn't hide from me with fig leaves..

(scratching)

ah..uh..con..trol..my..ah..yo..yo
(you don't know me and you don't know my style [Method Man])

[Verse 3]
We move fast, like quick draw, McGrall, when it's time
We get raw, our crew come together like jigsaws, puzzles
We movin' on the double
A t-r-o-u-b-l-e, we spell trouble
For you cats and dogs without muzzles, barking in my face
That'll carry no weight like space shuttles
We rock the mic like rubble
Binary Star came to rain, drip, drop, rain puddles
Suddle, anonymous, rap hippopatomus, no comogenous
Deeper than a pit, that's bottomless
The knowledge is, to see us, you must meet astrologist
Stars, quasars, cyrus, synonomous..

(scratching)
...(these styles is unknown to)
...(leavin' no limits)
...(we don't forgive or forget)..
(scratching)

yo

(scratching)

...(these styles is unknown to)...(these styles is unknown to)..

we bum rush, there's no envision

whatchu know about this (2x)
