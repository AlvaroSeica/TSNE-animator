JT:  Fuck that shit, let's go to Pac-Jam.

Devastator:
Yeahhhhh, ha ha!  C'mon now!  C'mon!  Yo, yo!  Lemme hear ya say
Shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, SHAKE THAT SHIT, HOE!!!

Verse 1:  JT Money
Hoe, bend over and spread ya butt cheeks
Let a nigga see them guts, freak!
Touch the ground!  Slap that ass,
Make it jump up and down!
You gotta get butt-naked
But if you want my money, hoe, you gotta shake it
What you gon' do?  You gotta shake somethin'
For Madd Ball and Uzi too!
Roll them hips, get this grip
Now let me see them pussy-lips
You know a nigga be lovin' it
Bring that ass too close, I'm up in it!
See, I'ma get my money's worth, bitch,
I ain't tryin' to make yo' ass rich
JT, with a different kind of flavor
Bitch, shake what ya' mama gave ya!

Devastator:
C'mon, c'mon, say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
C'mon, c'mon, shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, WORK THAT SHIT, BITCH!!!

Verse 2:  JT Money
Work for this money, honey, stop fakin'
I wanna see some real booty-shakin'
Slap that ass and make it jiggle
Now shake for a little
Drop to the ground, do a split
Bounce up and down like you're ridin' on a dick
Grab the pole, bendo on over,
Now show that booty hole
Play with ya clit and don't quit
A nigga be lovin' that wild shit
But just don't stop
I give a hoe $5 for a table-top!
'Cause I got the cash flow
But you know, you gotta shake that ass, hoe!
Can't nothin' save ya
Bitch, shake what ya' mama gave ya!

Devastator:
C'mon, c'mon, shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)

[Shit!  You ain't just a woman!  That's a whole lotta cash!  But I gotta
admit, honey, that's a whole lotta ass!! {laughter}]

Verse 3:  JT Money
Bitches, get yo' ass on the dance floor
Show me what you got in store
If you can't holler now, see me later
I gotta say peace to Devastator
For makin' the beat
Now I'ma give a shout-out to all you big-booty freaks
For workin' that ass so smoothly
Peace to Mike Fresh, Madd Ball and Uzi
Say, JT like to diss hoes
Well, how ya like this, hoes:
Get buck-ass wild 
Shake that ass like it's goin' out of style
Don't hide the vibe
Make that ass wiggle side to side
Now you got the flavor!
Bitch, shake what ya' mama gave ya!

Devastator:
Here we go!  Here we go!  
C'mon, c'mon, shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Lemme hear ya say shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Raise it up!  Shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
C'mon, shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)
Shake what ya mama gave yaaa! (Shake what ya mama gave yaaa!)

[sound of the fellas trippin' in the club]
JT:  Hey, y'all get mad 'cause the hoe don't wanna go with y'all! 
C'mon baby, let's dip.</pre>
