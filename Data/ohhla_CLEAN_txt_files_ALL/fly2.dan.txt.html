[Verse 1]
So I've been through these hard times, mentally scarred
Almost lost my sanity but got no sympathy cards
And there's been a couple times when my knees buckled
I'd be in a heap of trouble if I didn't juggle these rhymes
You know these God-forsaken issues make you wish you could fly
Sometimes I wanna put my fist to the sky
And say goodbye to these worldly things
I wish that I could trade these pearls for wings
And give complacency a whirl, it seems
Every time I feel content, it's meant for me to lose
Control of situations, my patience is overused
Confused, my friends are saying I should be glad that I made it
So tell me why I feel so jaded
I'd trade it all for a couple minutes of some peace of mind
And leave behind this stress; if I cease confinement
Of my soul, my soles can finally leave the ground
I ain't never comin' down

[Chorus]
Just fly away now
Just fly away now

[Verse 2]
If we try we can rise above
And fly with doves so high, it's the sky I love
Listen...to the sound of liberation
No bounds, no limitations; no trials and tribulations
The ground's disintegratin', let your problems disappear with 'em
...but it's so hard to let go, I know
It's like so many people want you to fail
And if you ain't the type to raise your voice they want you to yell
Or maybe you got it as bad as me; cats don't wanna see my success
They'd rather see me in a tux and a vest
Laid up in some old coffin being carried away
Carried to some nameless cemetery, buried today
That's why I'm wary today, I pray for clarity but
It's like the energy I put into it's tearin me up
That's when the air lifts me up, the blue abyss is callin'
A shot at peace of mind is greater than the risk of fallin'
So one time for my disillusioned artists, I hear ya
Two times for the kid that air-guitars in the mirror
Three times for the 9-to-5-in' bus ridin' dudes
And four times for my dreamers, yo I'm just like you
That's why I sing for my queens with their own pair of wings
My brothers flyin' beside me, drama behind me
Mama tried to find me, she inquired emphatically
I was in the sky with all these other ghetto kids, defying gravity, uh

[Chorus]

...we all gotta let go someday man</pre>
