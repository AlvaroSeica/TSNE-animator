[Intro]
Yeah! Yeah! Whattup son? Oh word?
Fuckin with her right?! Ehhhhh that bitch is crazy b!
She do ev'rything nigga! That bitch eat cookies in the bed and all that shit man!
Becareful man! Word up man! (Cookie monster hoe that bitch is a cookie monster hoe!)
Aight! Hold it down hold it down one!

[Verse One]
So when it's over we demandin our weapons
Stop, cock, shoot, now I'm in the ghist of perfections
Smooth willy chillin with the spartans 
Fart in front of your bitch, squeeze her tits move aside pardon
Paid niggas don't talk just straight to the bar
Buy the whole shit out, then light up a bar
Colorful kings, wardrobes is different from those
You don't want no beef better take it to Mo's
Put the drink on the side and said what!
My man's with the turban on mouth froze y'all niggas is fucked!
He was my son out of Gun Hill I know him through Tech
If it's the last thing we do we 'gon get at his neck
Bartender gimme the check, keep him right here I'll be back
Now everybody knowin I'm connected
Hopped in the seven, left fifty seven of my wolves
This is personal, niggas don't fret

[Chorus]
Aiyyo! One more man 'gon die tonight (Night)
One more hand 'gon ride tonight (Night)
If there's a m on the table I'm down yo don't be yappin off at the mouth
What niggas don't see do the round
One more man 'gon die tonight (Night)
One more hand 'gon ride tonight (Night)
If there's a m on the table I'm down yo don't be yappin off at the mouth
What niggas don't see do the round

[Verse Two]
He in Kentucky Fried lucky guy him and his kid
Front of first bite a bullet would've flew through his wig
Beast move chill wait for the kids
Oh the nigga not that stupid, I see the gun on his ribs 
Fuck it catch him by the crib yo he live with his wiz
She the bowlegged stripper bitch we fingered at Liv
For a buck she will guzzle your kids
And let you kick a tall boy Heineiken, up in his shit
This wack ass nigga frontin, yappin 'bout bids behind the wall
Niggas pissed on him gave him the biz
Just a tough guy frontin 'cause he famous and shit
Back in '89 baby crimes rape and some shit
We should've killed him then, he dust up look at his bed
I should've milked him right there and then 
Fuck it son yo guzzle the chin
Just let the movie occur then blow up in the spur yellin win

[Chorus]
Aiyyo! One more man 'gon die tonight (Night)
One more hand 'gon ride tonight (Night)
If there's a m on the table I'm down yo don't be yappin off at the mouth
What niggas don't see do the round
One more man 'gon die tonight (Night)
One more hand 'gon ride tonight (Night)
If there's a m on the table I'm down yo don't be yappin off at the mouth
What niggas don't see do the round</pre>
