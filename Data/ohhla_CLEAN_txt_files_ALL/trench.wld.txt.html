[Intro: Excerpts from unknown movies]
That, that, that, that damned nut killed his own parents
No pussy-ass rookie cop can get him and that's for damn sure
They would've locked him up in a Crazy House and throw away the key
That guy is crazy, maybe they just need to counsel him..

[Verse One: Willie D]
I can't keep surrounded by violence
Pimps and hustlers was my only guidance
In a place, where mamas for the other boys play Mobbers 
But I play Cops and Robbers
That was just a game
But it was alone, before I came with the real thing
Hold ups, shoot outs and cocaine
And anything else as you can name, it's all the same
When you're trying to get the nine twos brother
Act like you're me, and go rob a motherfucker
Do the shit by yourself if you can
If you can't take a motherfucking friend
But don't tell a sole, cause one might snitch
You can't even tell your goddamn bitch
Ain't too many niggaz got it like that
But Trench Coats and Gangster Hats are back

[Hook: Excerpts from unknown movies]
That guy is crazy
They would've locked him up in a Crazy House..
No pussy-ass rookie cop can get him and that's for damn sure
That guy is crazy
That damn nut killed his own parents
Maybe they just need to counsel him..

[Verse Two: Willie D]
I've told her get on your broke bro and peep it
Everybody knows, it ain't no secret
I don't give a fuck about that brother shit
I don't discriminate, I just aim and shoot a bitch
If you ain't in it, get your ass out it
Cause the fools I run with are rowdy
And they'll hurt anything from your own lady
To your bitch and your shitty-ass baby
Maybe you can cop a plea, say you're cool with me
Cause Trench Coats and Gangster Hats are Willie D
But if the matter, is too deep to resolve
Get ready for them get-well calves
Or a malt drip on your motherfucking back
Cause you thought this was just another rap act
I drive a Cadillac, I gotta tell you that
Trench Coats and Gangster Hats are back

[Hook: Excerpts from unknown movies]
No pussy-ass rookie cop can get him and that's for damn sure
They would've locked him up in a Crazy House and throw away the key
That guy is crazy
That damn nut killed his own parents
Maybe they just need to counsel him..

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Punk motherfucker let your nuts hang
And I'ma come back on your ass like a boomerang
I maintain, when worse comes to worst
I like pussy, but money come first
These ain't the days of Capone and Elliot Ness
Fucking with me, you're fucking with the best
Oh! I know I can go to, believe me
Your whore, but the task ain't easy
Say, you stick me out in a bloodbath
Are you ready for the motherfucking aftermath?
When you're laying in the bed with your bitch naked
And my boys dropped in unexpected
Adios, to you and your whore 
(What about the kid?) gotta go, gotta go
Do them, face to the carpet, cover your tracks
Trench Coats and Gangster Hats are back

[Hook: Excerpts from unknown movies]
They would've locked him up in a Crazy House
That guy is crazy
No pussy-ass rookie cop can get him and that's for damn sure
That guy is crazy
That damn nut killed his own parents
Maybe they just need to counsel him..

[Verse Four: Willie D]
When you see the T-C-G-H outfit
Don't show off, and try to talk shit
Get your motherfucking ass on business
Or you'll get that kick with the quickness
What you said? you don't fight no more
Well, let the auto and shells from your pop go
I've been a motherfucking villain
So long that babies were born and raised and had children
My Road-dogs live dangerously
Some in the cemetery, some in the penitentiary
How could you impose blows and cause drama?
You're still living with your mama
When Willie D is on your ass
You're truly have somebody on your ass
I used to wear a Jersey and a baseball cap
But Trench Coats and Gangster Hats are back

[Break: Willie D]
Yeah, it's about time for me to give some dap!
To all my niggaz in the bottom, that's been down with me from the beginning 
When I was knocking them whores out, running them out the neighborhood
What's up folks?
Bido, the motherfucking mack, but still find time to lay dope tracks
Crazy C, a born hard nigga that saw his way up, cause he's always ready to roll
A cuff for you, fool 
I'm giving a dap to my nigga, Ice Cube
I want you food-freeze bitch get out his way
To Source Magazine, MTV, pop it up, Rap Masters
I'm going out like a soldier, I told you that last year
My Road-dogs, Mayne, John John, Stalkie, Chop Chop, Dee Dee
Rage, Little Rod, Big Road, Oscar, David, Kevin, Dre 
Craig, Keith, I will see you fool
To the P to the motherfucking goddamn E, Public Enemy, you're my niggaz
MC Breed, and the D-F-C
Nemesis, here's a Texas thing, fuck them
Vinie and Treach, y'all niggaz got the right name, Naughty by Nature
And every time I put some shit out;
I gotta give some dap to my niggaz out of Miami 
The 2 Live motherfucking Crew
To not the peon, but original gangster, Ice-motherfucking-T
And I'ma go ahead and give some dap to a New Orleans-ass nigga named Rollin
Stop paying them whores nigga 
Willie D, in the goddamn house
And I ain't gonna hurt nobody unless they fuck with my boys Kid and Play
I've got dap for the niggaz I pass the Piote' to
Harvard Love, Icy Hott, Rasir X, Sho and Klondike Kat
What the fuck you gotta say? 
Big Mellow, thought I forgot you then you're fool
T-M-T get a little dap
To Trife Design and Ultimate Sound
For making the sound sounds so goddamn funky
And I always get dap to everybody in Houston, that's down with Will
For you jealous-ass whores, and dick-riding niggaz 
Who can't keep my name out your mouth
I'ma run into you one day in them streets
And I'ma kick your motherfucking ass! (*Echoed two times*)

[Outro: Over voice]
Now, flip that shit over bitch!</pre>
