[Chorus]
Take Me to L.A. (x4)
Back to the Bay (x4)

[Verse One: The Grouch]
I grew up in the bay
So I'm down to earth
I live in L.A.
That means I'm down to work
I Got a laid back style
But I like to floss it
Vans and Chucks inside my closet
LA face with an Oakland booty
That's what my wife got
she don't act snooty
Ay that's a Bay thang
So come with that A game
But be on the A list
To see an LA Chick
Los Angeles we all can't handle it
Some call it plastic
That's just the half of it
Like the cows on the 5 when you mash you quit
That's a drive but it flies when you passionate
Yeah... I got family up north
Homies down south man its all home court
We take it back and forth
Some Oakland Raiders
The Bay to LA, like Amoeba player

[Chorus]

[Overdub on the Chorus]
What did you think this was
LA to the Bay, the buzz
The buzz, the buzz
What did you think this was
LA to the Bay, the buzz
The buzz, the buzz
I keep my hustle you know
I make it go
The Bay to La, the Bay to LA

[Verse Two: MURS]
Uh, and all my homies say "Rip!"
When I first got to the Bay, I straight tripped
Blood! blood!
What's that all about?
Tommy's got these broads sayin' blood in his house?
Cuz, but I ain't thugged out
Ignorance off my chest I let it out
(It's all good) now I'm back on my grind
On telegraph with them fat ass dimes
(I got tapes) see the Bay got that lime
And LA we was still smokin brown at the time
Ugg, so when I got back home
Fools wasn't tryin to hear 3-54 zone
Hell naw! that's until they got blown
and they came to my door like cuz its on! Blood!
Now I'm goin back and forth
Greyhound hella green in my green Jansport

(Chorus Extended)

[Verse Three: MURS]
Tajai was the first dude I heard say hyphy
Back in '97 when nobody liked me
Or should I say liked us?
Packed in the RV didn't have a tour bus

[The Grouch]
No! But we had that heart though
Intrigued by that old freestyle LaMerk Part flow
LA, G-Funk and Bay Area slang 
A, W up cause its all the same

[MURS]
1996 was the Hall Of Game
Whole damn summer had the streets on flame
But I'm kind of ashamed
That i stepped on Mac Dre
Godfather of the game

[Grouch]
Wake up, cake up, pilot auto
In Oakland it's taco's 
LA I eat Rascos
Thought you thought
It is what it is
Los Angeles baby, by way of town biz

[Chorus]</pre>
