Oh, Tay Dizm, T-Pain (Ricky Ross)

[Chorus: T-Pain] 
I said my Chevy sit so high up (high up) from the flo'
I feel like I'm an alien in a UFO 
I go oooooo-WEEEOOOH-OOOOOOO - beam me up
I go oooooo-WEEEOOOH-OOOOOOO - beam me up
Because my Chevy sit so high (high) from the flo'
I feel like I'm an alien in a UFO 
I go oooooo-WEEEOOOH-OOOOOOO - beam me up
I go oooooo-WEEEOOOH-OOOOOOO - beam me up

[Tay Dizm] 
Creep through the hood, dark tinted on the box
Comin face-down, 'cause my feet so hot
Naw dog, yee ain't messin with my Chevy (Chevy)
High octane, so come come cash me (VROOOOM~!)
Inches black-on-black
Ever real hard, yeah I open in the back
And they say ooh-whee when I come 'round
Yes, I put it down when I'm in town
I said my Chevy sit so high up (high up) from the flo'
My rims is taller than your nieces and my Chevy da boss
And I got dem do's that pop up like the UFO
Okay, Dizm is tha man and y'all already know, let's goooo...

[Chorus]
 
[Rick Ross]
Triple Cs' baby, Tay Dizm
Big boss (big boss) Big blob (big blob)
Red paint (red paint) flip-flop (flip-flop)
Mo' girls (mo' girls) no top (no top)
Mo' girl (mo' girl) mo' blocks (mo' blocks)
We grind (we grind) I shine (I shine)
See that? (See that!) That's mine (that's me)
Old school cost more than the new school (True)
But my money weigh more than it used to
She wit me, cain't you tell?
Gucci bag, name Chanel (Yea)
Louis this (this), Fendi that (what?)
In my jeans, 20 stacks (Boss!)
Twenty-fo's (fo's) all I know
Send a go, sellin dope
Livin life, get it right
She love my car, she rode me twice
Boss~!
 
[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
oooooo-WEEEOOOH-OOOOOO..</pre>
