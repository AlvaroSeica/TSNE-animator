Welcome to my dream, and howwww are you?

[Ceschi]
Why, wake, up
When such wonderful worlds are created inside of our skulls
Just, stuck
Waiting for pillowcases to wrap faces forever
(Welcome to my dream, it nowwww seems real)
(You're reallllll... you're reallllll)
Why, wake, up
On a planet where death is a scent on everybody's tongue
Just, stuck
Waiting for some solution to come from the heavens above
(Welcome to my dream...)</pre>
