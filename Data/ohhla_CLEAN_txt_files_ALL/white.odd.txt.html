[Frank Ocean]
Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything's, going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talkin like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity... keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness it was lonely, and there was silence
And what is this love? I don't feel the sa-aaame
Don't believe what this is, could it be given a name?
I woke you were there tracing planets, on my forehead
But I forget 23, like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you'll forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
will all fade to grey soon... on the TV station?</pre>
