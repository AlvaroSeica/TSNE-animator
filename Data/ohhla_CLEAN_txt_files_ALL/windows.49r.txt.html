It's a beautiful day to sit back and parlay
I'm a call off of work and we gonna kick with these skirts
Because the girls look so good
In bathing suits that look like lingerie I'm wishing this was everyday
And escape from reality, ain't thinking about the system
Or the pressures of capitalism, man I'm just living
When the sun's shining bright it seems like everything is right
Ain't a cloud in sight, no gun shots or fights
Everybody got their windows down music playing loud
The sounds of basketball and children laughter saturate the background
And all around town it's like a car exhibition
Old folks on the porch with their cups reminiscing
It's a party out on every block
I like the way she got her hair up and her stomach showing damn this girl is hot
And her girls are looking good too
About to call up my crew and we gonna kick before the nights through

Hook (2xs)

We're riding with the windows down
So holla at me when I'm in your town
First I push it to the left, and then I hook a right
Never nothing less tell me what it's looking like

Woke up in the morning had the yearning for verbs
Nouns, metaphors, and the girls with the curves yeah
Spell it write when you signing my check
And I don't worry about thing cause I'm rhyming correct
Put the music in the air flying by high zoning
Dipping through your city in the ride like the Ronin
Or on the countryside zoning
The fresh air out there got a brother wide open
Looking good when I'm going to a gathering
Never spill a drop when the drink starts splattering
Girls start chattering, when we post up
When it comes to scoring points, we put the most up
It ain't Dr. Erv, it ain't Karl Malone
Can't stop swerving in the cars that we own
Last place I went they said that I love your accent
Touching down in a plane like Bo Jackson

Hook (2xs)

We're riding with the windows down
So holla at me when I'm in your town
First I push it to the left, and then I hook a right
Never nothing less tell me what it's looking like

It's like the night ain't even start and I'm already tipsy
Got the Henny, Remi, Paul Mason, it's on
So put the kids to bed we on some grown man ish
Late night barbequing man I know what I'm doing
And I ain't new to this I've been doing this for a minute
And I've been sprinting ever since the line of scrimmage ya heard
Ain't no gimmicks it's more than business that's why we in it
For the love of the music, the money, the women, and children come on

Marchitect

Whether you're a star in a car or you let the motorcycle spin
Keep that paper coming in like a recycle bin
The ocean's looking good and I might go in
And I'm gonna sting 'um with the fashion when the night begins
We'll have a party tell a shorty to invite her friends
Hit the pool, act a fool, and then invite her in
I hope nobody gets me for my lighter when
We light the night up until the next time we ride again

Hook (2xs)

We're riding with the windows down
So holla at me when I'm in your town
First I push it to the left, and then I hook a right
Never nothing less tell me what it's looking like</pre>
